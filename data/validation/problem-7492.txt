“Just spectacular.” Peter shot back, sarcastic. “Five stars, through the roof food.”
“It’s not fancy, just good food.” Steve smiled. “But we don’t have to go if you’d rather stay here.”
“I just love the atmosphere.” The child deadpanned sarcastically, eyeing Clint.
“Peter?” Steve called through his door, the next morning.
“Successful shopping trip?” Bruce asked cheerfully when they bumped into one another down the hallway.
But at least I did it
Peter didn’t respond to Bruce’s greeting, eyes trained in on the new man, who had a stethoscope around his neck and was talking to Tony in hushed tones whilst they both leant over a Stark Tablet.
“But what? What excuse could you possibly have for talking about my personal problems without my consent?”
“Wow what a guy. Pays for my dinner, looks like Hercules
“But I don’t need any help!” Peter cried again, feeling very hot and angry and emotional all at once.
“Peter?” It was from Tony. “Can we come in?” Peter panted, gripping his hair once more as he folded himself over and dug his forehead into the plush carpet. He tried to say no, or argue that it was locked but nothing was coming out except for wheezy breaths.
“No, I’m good thanks.”
“Yeah but we’re asking what you would like to eat, not what you’re fine with.” Steve gently probed, and Peter turned to look at him then sighed.
“I really like studying.” Was his weak excuse.
Be nice :)
“I’m also requesting we get something to eat. I’m starved.” Tony groaned, opening the door for Steve and Peter to walk out into the hallway.
Peter wasn’t looking at the two men, but if he had he would’ve seen two looks of complete care, sympathy and admiration on both of their face’s, so he didn’t look and simply stared at the doors of the elevator he was riding in.
“Yeah, yeah, I’m the worst.” Tony grinned, waving his hand about casually before turning to Peter.
But, Steve sort of reminded him of how aunt May used to soothe him after a nightmare, with a soft voice and soothing touches. And if he closed his eyes for long enough, he could probably pretend he was with aunt May.
“Uh, Jarvis?” He tried; voice quiet.
But it's my birthday on Saturday so have a present :)
Then they were gone, walking back into the elevator discussing new training regimes and whatnot and it was just him and Clint.
"So what? We sit around and play monopoly?" Clint snorted from across the table, legs kicked up on the dark oak table.
“Okay well, that seems doable. We just need to check some basic things and fill out some forms and you should be all good to return next Monday.” She smiled, turned to her computer and clicked a few times before beginning her line of questions.
Peter suddenly sat bolt upright, panting heavily with a thin sheen of sweat covering him and hands shaking in front of his torso.
Steve’s mouth snapped shut, trying to observe every detail of the body that had just fallen through the ceiling of one of the most secure buildings in Manhattan. The boy had dark brown curly hair, long and unkempt, dirt and grease streaking through it as though it hadn’t been washed in a while. His face and body were skinny, unnaturally so, and he could see that by the way that his thin clothes were draping off his body. But the most alarming thing about this boy was that he had a large bruise planted across his jaw, deep purple and yellow standing out against his frightfully pale skin.
“And you fucking should.” Clint nodded. “Popcorn?” He plopped a huge bowl of popcorn in between their bodies and then threw a large blue fluffy blanket across their knees.
He was just about to start a new chapter when Tony calls through his door.
“Oh my god,” Tony sighed dramatically. “You guys actually have
Was he shivering? He wasn’t cold, rarely was anymore, and the tower was usually a pretty nice temperature. He hadn’t been cold for the past few months, he’d had to learn to not be, and he tried to keep himself wrapped up in whatever he had to stop him from getting pneumonia.
The young boy eyes him suspiciously, clutching protectively at the strap of his bag.
“Peter,” Steve said softly. “You need to eat.”
“Or how about how I fell through your ceiling, or what I did today or the fucking meals I’ve had or the words I’ve spoken since I got here?” He asked, stepping off the couch.
“Well, why this guy?” Peter asked again, looking at the new man through the corner of his eye.
I was going to post this tomorrow but I was too excited about it so here you go!
The school hadn’t changed one bit.
Peter squirmed, blushing all the way down his neck.
Again, no one spoke until Tony pushed himself off the wall to speak again.
“The law. So I’d shut it if I’d were you because the adults are talking.” Tony snapped from next to Steve. “Now you’re going to apologise to Sam, Clint, Wanda and Natasha because they wasted valuable time trying to look for you and then you’re gonna listen to us when we say that you’re grounded for the next two weeks,” Tony repeated, calmer.
“I, I-“ Peter stuttered, trying helplessly to explain what had just happened.
“I’m a super soldier!” Steve growled, glaring at Tony playfully. “I could’ve easily carried those bags.”
“I always hurt you, don’t I?” Steve asks. He’s panting, exhaustion lining his features, as well as something that looks like regret.
“I hear you, Maria. They’ll find him.”
On their next mission out, Iron Man behaves perfectly, agreeing to every command on the field. It’s so smooth that Steve thinks something is missing. He realizes it’s their arguments, and he mourns the sass he gets from Tony even as he marvels at the efficiency of their movements. Nat is contemplating him with a savageness that Steve would normally be wary of, if he thought she was any genuine threat. Once again, she can’t say that this isn’t better. Tony is improved, though Steve is worried now about Tony losing himself to some of his Omega instincts.
“Where have you been?”
“Tony,” he bites out. “And I’m fine. Go.” Cap gives him a longing look of regret, before jogging off somewhere in the maze of the helicarrier. If Rogers is the type to have remorse, he should have thought of that before he treated Tony like a stereotype from the 40s.
is there.
Steve tidies up the kitchen and sets the dirty dishes he used to the side. There’s no time to clean them all off now. He sets the pot to soaking, and by the time he’s done, he figures he should go wait in the lobby.
Inside, it’s eerily quiet, the twin headsets tilted and languishing against each other, taunting him. Tony boots up a screen and snatches one of the helmets, donning it as he goes through the routine of turning on the training routines. The neural load is supposed to be unbearable for two people, but more than ever, Tony believes Steve is waiting for Tony to find him, inside of their bond.
Thor confirms his suspicions that messing with powerful objects nets you powerful enemies while Steve states the obvious questions. Nick defends himself with altogether lame-ass excuses about having his hands forced, something, something deterrents. Yup, as if someone personally stuck their hand up Fury’s ass and used him like a puppet to make a weapons program.
He also wishes Extremis didn’t dominate so much of Tony’s biology. He’d like to see the sweat beading on Tony’s neck, the fine flush that Tony gets when he’s unsure.
“What did Bucky do? I know he did something—”
him, Steve’s taut body leaning all the way over Tony’s and rubbing against his back. Hips smacked down into Tony, stretching his ass open and putting pressure on his rim. It has the added effect of aiming Steve’s cock right at Tony’s prostate from his bent position.
Which is occupied.
“That I didn’t do it right. Gave me a whole list on how to do it.”
“I think so. I treated Tony like he wasn’t my equal, and he more than is. If anything, he’s my superior.”
Omega, no. Replays again and again. Tony shivers and endures it, forming a callus against the intrusion. There’s no way to tell if it will hold up in person, but there aren’t any other options. He’s got to have his shit together by the time Steve returns.
“Will you marry me?” Steve’s hand is at his hair, petting, and Tony almost groans again, but he has to answer. He has to make sure Steve knows.
“If you want to help Tony, then be a good husband to him. A good alpha. Don’t hurt him or force him into things he’s not good at. You’ll see underneath all of his bluster, he’s a good man. A man who has done so much for omega rights in this world. He doesn’t deserve to be treated like a second class citizen.”
He releases a barrage of missiles straight into the face of the whale. It roars and makes a hairpin turn towards him while he passes by. Plus one for having some kind of intelligence. It’s not the soldiers who are guiding it then. Perhaps it’s internal. Maybe he can hit it in the hive-mind or something.
“Yours.” This is a promise. It’s the beginning for Steve, of all the things he’s going to have with Tony after this. It makes every action, every second guess, all the waiting on Bucky, his confrontation with Nat, the disappointment of their past, bearable. He can carry these things for Tony, as an act of love. Tony doesn’t have to know the cost of their happiness. That is for Steve and Steve alone. And such is love, Steve thinks.
“Wait, what the fuck does that mean? You can’t just take him. He killed my parents, and he’s going to pay for every second he made them suffer. Don’t you dare go near him!” Tony aims his repulsor at Bucky’s head and quicker than he can think, Steve tosses his shield at Tony’s gauntlet, shattering the focus point of the repulsor. There’s no point in raising his other arm, as Steve will just stop him there too, and he grinds his teeth in anger. Steve is a fucking liar, and he doesn’t know what he’s talking about.
“And you don’t even like her Pep! Look, I kept Iron Man safe, Pepper. And I’d lie again to Christine and Stern if I had to, that’s all that matters.”
“Just try, Tony,” Pepper says.
“It’s because I care for Tony that I did this.” He spreads his arms to drive home his point. He has nothing to hide. There is no ulterior motive than the one he’s given.
“Wanna see you cry. Wanna hear you beg me.” Tony has already given as much as he can possibly give. There isn’t more to say. He just wants Steve to stop. It fucking hurts so badly, and he thinks he’s bleeding. It’s even more humiliating that through the ache and stinging, it feels so good. His body opens up to Steve, taking it and taking it.
“It’s almost over Steve. And honestly, I really don’t want to hear it from you. Can you just come, please?” Tony does not want Steve here, at all. But he doesn’t feel like he has a choice. He feels warm all over, but maybe that’s just nervousness at how stupid this whole situation is. Another thing the Orion woman mentioned was that you just can’t trust anything that came from a completely different evolutionary branch than yourself. STIs were more treatable and easily identified in humanoid to humanoid transferences. You can trust a tentacle as far as you can throw it.
hurt Bucky that way. Bucky seems so stolid, immutable.
“Say yes first. Obey me just this once Tony. Just this time.” Tony swallowed: his pride, his rising desire for this. For Steve.
“Yes.”
“About that. After New York, we can’t give you any more without you going on a scheduled heat, and since I don’t trust you to do so on your own time, I insist you use our heat service.” Fury unlaces his hands and opens a drawer that Tony can’t see, but presumably contains scent bags, since the one-eyed wonder starts pulling plastic baggies of cloth onto his desk.
“Oh Tony, that’s not stupid at all. They hurt you.” Steve’s arms curl around Tony, bracketing him from whatever forces exist in this world that intend him harm.
“Save the rest for the turn, J.” JARVIS only asks whether he should call Ms. Potts, and he figures he might as well. He’s glad in this moment that they’re not together. If they had been, this would have been next to impossible for him to do. But she doesn’t owe him anything. He’s not always done his best by her, but he did, does, love her. And she was right. He’ll tell her that. That Iron Man and Tony are linked, and that he would have lied to her again somewhere along the line and risked his life like this.
“Yeah, I do.” Which is when it starts to get rough. Steve presses Tony’s face to the ground using one strong hand on his neck. The cold of the floor seeps into Tony’s cheek and he can feel the snow settle into his beard.
He’s so sorry. Sorry that he ever laid a hand on Tony. That he ever tried to control his habits, his clothing, his money. Speaking of, he has to tell Tony to do whatever he wants with
“We have to get you back soon. I’ll be having you again next week on your mission to Beruit.” Tony pulls out and shoves two fingers in Steve’s ass, pumping them and scraping over Steve’s prostate.
Natasha runs. Weaving through the hallways, she jumps over carts and sends a few techs spilling against the walls.
Tony does and his breathing begins to even out.
He’s in luck; the device is perched on his tower’s roof, spinning as it spews blue energy the color of the Tesseract.
“It’s just what I said. Tell him this. Ask him to forgive you. And if you are very, very lucky, he will.”
Tony has never taken a knot.
He imagines JARVIS operating the cameras to get a good view for Steve, and he shudders, body undulating in pleasure as it skates down his spine and up to his head before he lets that drop down. His fingers are probing, testing the area and just barely starting to penetrate his sphincter. He wants to tease himself, wants to draw this out, even though his body recognizes all the signs and is open for Steve.
He makes a bowl for Tony with some bread on the side and heads down once more. It seems that Tony hardly ever leaves his workshop these days, and Steve wonders if that’s where he feels the most safe.
“Of course, you pick that out of all of what I said. Yes, I enjoy being fed. Happy?”
“Hmm. Don’t whip the batter too hard now.” She considers him in that unfathomable way she usually does as she stills his hands with her own, before letting go and leaving the room.
“Get out. We want to be alone with him,” Rhodes says, sneering.
“What do you think it is?” He cocks his head, giving Tony what he knows is his most winsome smile.
He should be struggling. It should be harder to accept this.
“Nothing’s ever set in stone, dearest. Just show him you’re the man you are in here,” she taps his chest, “and he’ll be with you, and everything will be right as rain.”
“Yeah, well. Would you like a drink?”
That’s not Tony anymore.
“Oh, doll, I know you do.” It comes out like a purr that shudders and shakes its way down Tony’s spine.
“So why go now, if I am coming?”
They do so, the machine not beeping in the slightest as they go on through. Steve never thought he would see the day that Natasha actually left all her knives off, but he supposes if she wanted to kill someone, she could do it anyway.
“You should get lost. Eavesdropping is for children and the government.” He waved his arm at his best friend who had watched him get shot down.
“Ah, damn, SHIELD didn’t even brief you? Well, welcome to 2011 Cap. It’s been a wild ride, which you’ve missed out on the beginnings of, being frozen in the arctic for 70 years, give or take. So yup, yadda yadda, it’s the future, and we’re in the midst of a zombie tragedy in my tower, which is locked up tighter than a nun’s knickers.”
He thinks he might have liked to meet Edgar, to see a man who treated his omega with care and love. If he could just have one example, one person where he could anchor himself to their actions and know that it was right and good, he wouldn’t feel so confused. It would be nice to see Edith more often, but he didn’t know if that was possible, or if he ought to.
“C’mere Avenger.” Steve’s arms are open and the tiniest of smirks was resting on his face.
The heat is dying down, and with it Steve’s rut. Steve is petting him, and it feels so good, so very good, that Tony starts to hate it. It’s slow at first, the roiling anger that follows every time Steve’s hands glide down Tony’s skin, but it begins to lap at his conscious mind.
“Ask nicely or I’ll do this my way,” Steve says. Tony laughs throatily, his shoulders trembling with even more suppressed giggles. He stops and levels Steve a lascivious smile.
“I should apologize to him, shouldn’t I? He’s a good agent. That’s all that really matters.” Even if Steve thinks deep down that someone should be looking out for Clint.
“It’s coming up in a couple days. I need things for my nest. If I could be on suppressants, I would, but a fresh bond means a strong heat that could burst through the suppressants anyways. Better to just get it over with. We’ll discuss it more as we get closer.”
In any case, he grabs himself a snack and heads back out, taking the train to Brooklyn Heights.
“No, you’re not. But even you can see how well I treat my things. How do you think I’ll treat you?”
“Mm yes, knot me.”
He wouldn’t like what he found, but for his own sake, he’d have to do it.
Steve moves to say something, but Fury cuts him off.
The light around him slowly changes, growing dim with the sunset, and inside, the lights automatically turn on. Steve is suffused with fervor for what he’s been drawing. Tony, over and over. Tony in his workshop. Tony eating dinner. Tony in his suits. He looks back and realizes he has over forty pages of Tony in various stages of completion.
“Not at all, Tony. I’ll just take these ones?” He pulls the silk ones out, thinking it’ll hold the scent a bit longer. The natural fibers should absorb his scent and give Tony the comfort he needs.
Tony sneaks glances at Rogers as Bruce monologues about his terrible depression. Tony can’t blame the guy; Tony’s soon going to know what it feels like to be out of control, to be someone he’s not. His heat will make sure of that.
The transfusion is done in less than 15 minutes, with no time to spare. Clint wakes up once during, and Natasha shushes him as he asks to be put out of his misery. They’re all hoping this works.
“Genius, billionaire, Omega, philanthropist.”
Steve doesn’t disappoint. He sets a punishing pace, knot catching on Tony’s entrance with every pound of his hips. It’s unmaking him. Piece by piece he shatters, his orgasm starting from the base of his cunt and running up through to his own cock. Steve doesn’t stop but rocks him through the orgasm that lasts forever.
When the water starts to heat, he guides Tony to sit down inside the tub, the omega wincing when the water touches his backside.
“Use a spatula.”
“Is everything a joke to you?” It stops him in his tracks, if only for a second. Does Steve not know he’s teasing?
Humping the empty air where the symbiote is working at his covered cock, Steve takes Tony into his mouth again and presses his lips down to the root where Tony’s wiry, coiled hair tickles his mouth. Groaning, Tony reaches down and grasps Steve’s hair, fingers flexing tightly to his scalp.
“Well, my five year plan is to maybe go out for ice cream this afternoon?” He’s baiting Steve now, but it doesn’t seem to be working, and he hears Bruce sigh next to him in the front seat.
“Why haven’t you told him? Since you think I’m somehow responsible.”
“About?”
All of his dreams are spinning out of control, slipping through his grasp. The worst is that Tony isn’t going to be ok, and if it’s anything he wants, it’s Tony’s security and happiness. Steve doesn’t think he can listen at any more doors during Tony’s rut as the man loses temper. He thinks about what could happen, the people Tony could hurt, and how much Tony could injure himself. It kills him.
“Why would I not let you go to that? That sounds like a good thing.”
“He’s not a toy!”
“Is that what you’ve been doing when you’ve gone to that church?”
“I think I might have you anyway.” Steve leans down and over Tony, covering Tony’s cold body with his incredible warmth. Tony is stunned at the admission, and as flattering as it is to be wanted, he can’t help but think about what he would have done if he wasn’t hopelessly in love with Steve. As it stands, he thinks he might be about to get fucked by the man who lied to him, who beat him.
“Then don’t take our stuff,” Tony says.
“You hurt him. That happened a little more than a week ago, now. I have yet to see what changes you’ve wrought in the meantime.”
“If you ever let go of your control enough to come at me, it would be obvious it’s not an accident. You’d do my work for me. But hell, maybe I should let you, so they can lock you up.” It strikes him then that Nat might no longer be a friend. She’s on Tony’s side though. And that’s the side Steve is also on.
“Layover my legs, brace yourself with your arms on the floor.” Tony tentatively does that, draping himself across Steve. The omega is barely able to make eye contact, lashes hiding most of his eyes as he stares at the floor. Tony is in the pants of his suit from the ceremony and the wife-beater underneath, still. The shirt is thick, almost too much so, but it looks modest on Tony and Steve approves of that. When Tony is finally laid out over Steve’s legs, his chest tilted towards the ground and the juncture of his hips seated comfortably over Steve’s leg, exposing his ass to the air, Steve is satisfied.
. By a man with a thicker skull than his metal suit. Speaking of which, the idiot has bent his gauntlet out of shape. Would have ripped it off, but for a quick repulsor in the face.
Tony doesn’t dare move as the two alphas continue to bluster at one another, Bucky slowly slinking to his feet and gazing at Steve with murderous intent.
“No clue. Steve?” They both look at him as if he has the answer.
of you cavorting around like an off-leash omega.”
Forever. That’s how long he’s going to remember this. His eidetic memory is a cinema in which he can replay this indefinitely. And he will.
“I’m not sure she will, ma’am.”
, like someone stroking fingers down his spine and ending with the tips hovering over his entrance, circling the bundle of nerves there.
“Tony, my darling, it’s so good to see you.” She lays a proprietary hand on his shoulder before she drags her claws down the fabric, leaning in for a kiss to his cheek and then his other. Steve says and does nothing. Tony knows he hates when people touch him, but they’re in public, and some things are required.
The door doesn’t open and she can hear voices inside. Impatient, she uses the codes she stole one time from Maria, and forces the door open.
Of course Bruce is already there, set up in his own personal lab, and once he realizes that Nat and Clint are present he starts finding his way up to the penthouse too.
“He needs help.” Nat looked at Steve, and he could feel his lips twitch involuntarily at the grimace on her face. Steve turned to Bucky then, pleading on his face. He had to try.
“Tony?”
“Still his choice. If you think he does know best for himself, then prove it.”
. His own cock is rock hard, and he’s certain when he gets inside Tony, he’s going to explode. So he makes it good for Tony, moving his arm so that his palm faces downward and his two fingers brush directly against Tony’s prostate. He pumps them in just so, tilting his arm up so he can slam them down onto Tony’s hot button. Tony is bucking wildly now, pressing his hips back onto Steve’s ministrations.
“Steve look at this! I’m so stressed my body is producing Omgesterone. Pretty wild, yeah?” Tony’s face is pink and he’s clutching his hair in his hand as he rubs his fingers through the strands. His muscles are tense and he’s tapping his fingers on the counter to the side of him. Steve is reassured that Tony isn’t suspicious, but that doesn’t mean he won’t figure it out. He isn’t sure if synthetic hormones show up the same way as regular ones do. He’d ask Bucky, but he doesn’t think that his friend would be pleased to find out that Steve hadn’t talked to Tony, at all, about this plan.
“Of course, Sir. And good luck.” Steve takes the chip in hand, and peers down at its innocuous form.
“You call it compromise, but I don’t have a choice.” Steve resents that Tony’s defeat is his victory. There’s something disturbing about how the man folds in on himself during these conversations.
“Maybe. Depends on if you follow through with your promises, I suppose.”
“If you would, please.” It’s weird talking to a disembodied voice in the ceiling, but his week has been weirder still. He’s gone from thinking the things he was doing were ok to do to Tony to realizing they weren’t ok to do to anyone. Even if omegas needed minding in a hands-off way. Steve still thinks that Tony shouldn’t have been so promiscuous or free with his body, but there’s nothing he can do about that now.
“First time flyer Stark. You’re lucky I don’t need a puke bag,” Clint remarks as Tony settles the man on his perch.
“I don’t know how to do this.”
“Steve. Yeah ok. Um.” Which is just his luck, because out of all the Avengers, only Steve had a problem with Tony selling himself for parts and information. A really big problem, to where they hadn’t truly spoken to each other in months. Tony didn’t genuinely know what made Steve upset about the whole thing beyond the fact that it was yet one more part of this situation Steve couldn’t control.
In that second, Steve considers telling the truth. But he thinks better of it.
The bandage on his arm is miniscule, and he resents the implication that something so small, an insignificant needle, can upend his plans to find out exactly who he spent his time with. He doesn’t remember driving to the building. Or even leaving his lab. The heat he expected, but the unintended side effects are that his memory from the weeks previous are also spotty. He’d known that would be the case, but experiencing it is something else.
“To continue, Tony is going to want everything to be normal. You may feel the need to pull him aside, assure him that you’ll treat him just the same. Do that. I’m not here to take him away from the team or anyone else,” Steve says.
As fierce as Captain America is considered to be, for some unfathomable reason, it never seems to translate to Steve Rogers, omega. Out of uniform, he might as well be translucent next to Tony when it comes to these hoity-toity parties. Steve never minds. Steve is reliable, patient, enduring. He’s Tony’s anchor when it gets to be too much, and Tony wonders how he ever lived without the man.
“I’m not good. I’m bad. You want to punish me. Punish me, alpha.” Tony is sobbing, great heaving breaths coming out of him, his body trembling and shaking.
“Was it good for you?” Steve whispers quietly into Tony’s hair.
For this reason, Steve has worn his kevlar vest and all of his protective gear. Sooner or later, Rhodes would have accosted him, and he wanted to be ready.
, whispers the Omega.
He loves Tony. His vitality, his indomitable will, the way he always has a comeback, and never backs down. Tony is strong and brave.
.” Steve’s Alpha command is strong, and it shuts him down as he takes a step back away from Loki and tilts his body towards Steve. Fuck, that was powerful. He’s going to need to work on something to moderate his response to Steve specifically.
“They’re not so bad. Maybe a little clumsy, but they look kind of like they belong there in a weird way.” Bruce tried to make things normal, and Tony usually appreciated that, but he’s about ready to tear out all his feathers and leave whatever was left looking like a plucked chicken.
“Oh fuck, please—” It doesn’t stop. The wolf is relentless, and Tony feels a warm swirl in the pit of his stomach that he identifies as arousal. It feels so good. He’s been rimmed before, but the wolf’s tongue is all lean muscle and flicks perfectly in and out of his hole, coaxing the muscle to relax. His hips twitch back into the sensation, and he groans and then hiccups, tears still coating his face.
Lunch is a breath of fresh air, and he forgets all about Tiberius. That is, until the next morning when the newspaper announces the murder of Tiberius Stone, and hints at salacious details pertaining to it.
“Anytime, sweetheart.”
“Steve, yes, I want it, I want you—” That does it for Steve, and he’s coming, the first volley squishing out of him, knot so thick that it all but pops back inside Tony before they’re locked together, the slow but methodical pump of Steve’s cock undulant inside his hyper sensitive channel. Steve collapses over him, wet chest pressing into his back. He kisses the back of Tony’s neck, his spine, licking a fine stripe of sweat off Tony.
He just never saw it coming when it was Tony.
Each time he gets closer and closer to Tony.
Which is when he sees that outside is no better.
Instead he takes a swig of the newly designed shake that JARVIS had researched to help with the poison. It’s a variant of something called the “master cleanse,” and it tastes worse than Dum-E’s usual as he holds it in from spraying the faces of the people around him while he begrudgingly swallows.
“Omega. Sweet, perfect, lovely omega. You want my knot sweetheart? You’re still so tight, want to fill you right up again until it spills over.”
“I assure you, these wings are the furthest thing from angelic.”
In a matter of weeks, Tony gets paler, slower to move. He picks at his terrible meals and generally doesn’t talk back as much. It’s been a month or so, and Steve has been working with SHIELD to take on some missions, but they have no use for him yet. So here he is, watching Tony turn into a shadow of himself. It concerns him, but it’s like the darkness before dawn, it
When it’s all set up, he spends the majority of the time he’s at his apartment in the nest itself, scenting the pillows on his glands as he coats every square inch of fabric in his own smell. Tony will need it when he’s here, the calm from an Alpha’s scent neutralizing the inherent fear of new surroundings.
“As far as you’re concerned, every omega feels like heaven. It never made you stay,” Steve says, his arms wrapping around Tony’s neck and upper chest. Tony feels a nuzzle at his ear, gentle and sweet. He sighs into it, feeling touched,
“This is ridiculous,” Widow says over the coms. Her pig is reacting to her widow’s bites not at all. If anything, it’s making the animal more agitated.
“It’s going to be ok Tony. I promise it will.” Steve’s hands are at Tony’s hips, his thumbs stroking the soft flesh interior to the bones that jut out into Steve’s palms. It feels intimate, and Tony tries to back up, but Steve holds him fast.
“Oh god, it’s so bad Steve, you’re going to break me, fuck, what are you doing?” It’s never been like this before, with anyone. He’s not one for prolonged pain, but there’s something mesmerizing in it. Tony is grounded by Steve’s cock, the cold a distant feeling, the warmth of Steve and his single-minded focus on pounding Tony all he feels. Every grind of his hips against the floor and all the deep ache of Steve’s cock pressing at his prostate from the inside.
“Yes, whatever your finest is,” Natasha replies for him. “Keep it together Rogers. I’d almost think you actually care about what goes into Stark’s nest.”
Steve, who agrees with him, in his own way, is either better at hiding it, or at believing two contradictory things at the same time. That they are both soulmates, and also the victims of a particular mental illness that can only and ever afflict pilots who drift.
“Let’s not talk about it. It was good, wasn’t it? You enjoyed it?” Does it matter that he enjoyed it?
.” Tony squirms and tries to get away, the knot tugging at his body as he twists and claws at the bedding around him. Steve clutches him tight, willing his omega to be calm, to know that Steve isn’t mad at him at all.
“Hey, I’m also right here. I think I deserve to know how this meeting went.” Rhodes is now flopped on a couch, his legs over the edge of the arm, relaxed.
“Then talk. I can’t stop you.”
Captain America’s face is tight with disdain. He’s taken his cowl off, the heat from their respective bodies clogging the air. Tony has set his suit to recycle what air he has, but it’s not working any better to keep him cool. The exhaust from the suit isn’t helping matters either.
There’s no way he can rewind to the moment where Steve was tugged out of Tony’s life, but he relives it again and again, thinking if he could have just been taken with Steve. Or if maybe it hadn’t been raining.
“Distract me. Just, anything, please.” Steve sits down on the floor next to Tony, cross-legged. From there Tony gets a direct view of those tight pants spanning over the bulge of Steve’s dick. His ridiculous and intoxicated brain thinks this is ungodly hot. Tony shudders and turns his head away. He’s got to maintain control.
“Barton, stop squeezing me. This is a quick ride, not a heimlich.”
He’s long since passed the point of asking himself if this is the right thing to do. After he’d seen Tony fall from the sky, watched him carefully stuff Shawarma into his injured body, and avoid treatment after the battle, Steve had decided Tony needed someone. And that person is Steve. If the other man isn’t going to take care of himself, Steve is.
“Then I suppose you’ll have to deal with the consequences.”
, through and through, taking care of the rest of the team to the best of his abilities. It shouldn’t surprise him, but even still, Steve’s thoughtfulness catches Tony off guard sometimes.
“I have an eidetic memory, so.” Tony called him an abuser. He’s like Sean. Rory. Conall. That’s what Tony thinks of him. Steve is abruptly so disgusted with himself, he feels his dinner rush back up. He clutches at his stomach, feeling defensive.
“Bite back, Tony.” His Alpha tone is strong, enhanced by the serum as much as everything else has been. Tony struggles against him, but he rests his tiny fangs on Steve’s neck and ever so slowly, sinks in.
“Relaxed? Me?” Tony cocks his head at Nat, who stares back at him with her usual closed-off expression. The silence stretches, and Steve stops his preparation of pancakes, willing Nat to say something.
“Great work today on making sure that the slime didn’t get near any civilians. Your suit is a marvel. Have you had it long?”
He never suspected that they would go to such lengths to humiliate him, so here Tony is, doing his level best to conceal where he is at all times.
“Take off the suit, what are you?”
“What do you want, Barton? I don’t understand why there’s this much animosity. Yes, what happened was awful, and things have changed at home, but it’s like this is personal for you, and I don’t understand why. And besides, it’s business between Tony and me.”
“Fuck me, soldier boy. I want you inside me.”
Bucky goes in for the same trick as Tony’s arms wrap around his legs. Instead of wiggling out and stepping on Tony, Bucky teeters back and forth as Tony pulls at him, trying to maintain his balance, but Tony has leverage on his side and Bucky falls, hands propped behind him to cushion their descent. Tony scrambles and pounces, jumping past Bucky’s legs as they fall to the ground and times it just right so that Tony lands over Bucky, one hand lashing out to grab the letter from Bucky’s pants.
“Such a good boy for me. Now, you’re going to be so good, and come for your Alpha when I say.” He pulls out his fingers and uses the wet saliva to lubricate Tony’s nipples, leaving them cold points stuck in the air as his hand moves down to Tony’s stiff cock. Once he grips Tony in his hand, he pushes in all the way, the rim of Tony pressed up around the base of Steve’s already puffy knot.
“Thank you.” Then she steals his champagne, which is most definitely his security blanket. He’s going to have to have a
He slams his cock in as hard as he can, delighting in the perfection of Tony’s tight flesh. The V of his hips nestles perfectly with the globes of Tony’s ass and as he looks down, he watches the slide of Tony’s rim as it tries to keep Steve’s cock inside every time he pulls out. The symbiote is gently tugging at Steve’s balls and flicking over Tony’s nipples while it undulates with suppressed energy. Trust Tony to make a suit that helps debauch its owner.
“Yup, I was Iron Man all along, oops. But hey, we did it. All right, yay! Hurray. Good job, guys. Let’s just not come in tomorrow. Let’s just take a day. Have you ever tried Shawarma? There’s a Shawarma joint about two blocks from here. I don’t know what it is, but I want to try it.” Putting on a mask is what Tony does best. Fake happiness beats genuine misery any day. So when Steve smiles ruefully at him, Tony thinks that maybe, just maybe, he’ll escape unscathed. Even if in the end, shrapnel is shrapnel, and he’s going to end up alone with the things he’s done wrong.
“No, yes, no. I don’t know. I can’t imagine him differently, but part of me still thinks that he could come to enjoy some of the softer side of things.” Steve rubs at his neck, ruffling the hair on the back of his head.
“I heard you the first time ass-hat.” Tony’s shoulders are dropped into a curl as he starts to stagger off. Steve stops him on a dime.
“I’m not your friend, so hear me when I say this. I know he’s out there, and we’ll find him. Dead or alive, we’ll find something.”
“I’m not doing this to hurt him. He’s hurting himself, every day.” The truth of this must ring through Steve’s tone, because Bucky looks back at Steve with his lips twisted to the side and his eyes evaluating instead of displaying any kind of solemn dismissal.
But that moment is gone. Eradicated as surely as waves retreat from the shore. The loneliness is immense, throbbing, and it clamps around his organs, twisting and winding them ever tighter. He’s meant to be with his omega. There is very little purpose for him without Tony. This world is filled with new, meaningless things. Even from the beginning, the contract had given him purpose. And then slowly, slowly, it was Tony who became his reason. Steve doesn’t know how to be a person that doesn’t love Tony. Not anymore.
. Steve is going to do it, pull Tony’s hips down on him and rock into that sweet, tight heat. He groans at how tight it actually is. Tony’s muscles are almost a vice on him, and he’s wondering if he should pull out, and starts to do just that before Tony grabs at his shoulders.
But where to start. Steve wants everything. Every sigh and moan, each little squeak of arousal.
“I do. I don’t know where my thoughts are lately. All I want is for Tony to be… a good omega. To be happy being that. But I don’t even know what a good omega
It’s redundant, but Barton warns him about the speeders who are riding his ass, hard. They can’t bank, so he ends up smashing them against walls on a sharp turn through a tunnel.
No one had ever successfully dodged the law, until Tony, as far as he knew. It was next to impossible to hide the scent of an omega in heat.
Nat is wrong. Steve doesn’t do regrets anymore. Not since Peggy and Bucky taught him to go after what he wants before it’s gone. He’s getting it right this time, with Tony.
that he has. Tony tries to move his hips into the brutal fuck that Steve is giving him, but Steve grips Tony tightly and angles him just so. The slapping flesh as Steve drives into Tony is obscene and hungry, and Steve feels feral, with no thoughts other than Tony, Tony, Tony.
The buildings stream by now, the nuke wiggling uncomfortably in his grip. As he reaches several football fields away from the Tower, he turns on the repulsors on his torso, tipping up the nuke to glance the side of Stark Tower, up and into the portal.
After the ridiculous gala, Tony is exhausted. Frustrated, too. Fury reached out the very next day with cryptic instructions letting him know that they’d tell him where to go the day of. It was a lot of protection for one measly heat. Tony would have been suspicious if he didn’t think that some of that protection was for his sake.
Disgusted with himself, this time he gets up for a towel and a wash.
He lets Tony drop, gravity working to push semen up where it will settle pleasingly in his ass.
is here. He can’t just be getting himself aroused with Steve around. Steve will smell it, and what will he think of Tony then?
Tony was not a camper. He was not an outdoorsman. In fact, he loathes all those things.
There’s dead silence between Nat and Steve, and she mimics his posture, her arms wrapping around her torso in judgement.
“Tony. You have something to do with the changes that have been occurring with him.” And so she does know something. This is bad. Steve feels a shiver overtake him that he hides from Nat by stiffening just so. Swallowing, he tries to steady his voice.
Right now, he’s glaring morosely down at the breakfast he’s made. There’s too much of it, because in hoping beyond hope, he thought Tony would come up this morning and he could at least feed him. His chest feels tight with sorrow, his arms slack at his sides in defeat.
In the makeshift cafeteria, he sees the haggard faces of a few hundred people. It’s hard to look at it all in the face. The worn clothes, dead-eyed stares follow him even after he finishes his food. The guilt weighs on him; he doesn’t want to spend time with these people, even as they’re the ones he’s supposed to be saving. He doesn’t want their misery to rub off on him, and how selfish of him, he thinks.
The armor is pounding at him, metal panels slapping deep onto his cheeks as the metal cock plunges hard into his ass. He’s tearing, he knows it, but it’s no matter. It will heal.
And that was just the beginning.
Bucky barks out a laugh. “Ah-ah, Stark. You’ve got to take it from me. No suit allowed.”
“Maybe I don’t want to be on the Avengers anymore. Not if I have to sit next to the Captain.”
“You can do better than that.”
The only thing that interrupts their life is Tony’s work on producing more of Steve’s antibodies and monitoring Clint. It’s a small price to pay.
“Sir.”
“Ok, Tony.” Steve shuffles in closer, pressing himself against Tony’s backside. He can’t help but jerk into it, his cock finding Tony’s ass a perfect slot for itself. Tony groans and pushes back, leaving Steve feeling helpless with want. He brings his hand up to touch Tony’s gland, but Tony smacks it away.
But when the animal fully leaves the shelter of the leaves, he can see that it’s much bigger than a coyote, and he knows full well from the guide that wolves shouldn't be here.
Steve’s only met with soft little whimpers of need as he touches Tony, and Steve reaches down again, petting Tony’s hair, drawing his hands down Tony’s face to his neck and shoulder. The olive-toned skin is sweaty to the touch, hot and silken. It feels intimate, like Steve is a thief, stealing something precious for himself that doesn’t belong to him. But he can’t stop himself, with how much he wants to touch Tony, to feel his skin and cries as though they’re one endless stream of sensation.
“Shh, that’s right, you’re so good, my perfect omega, so perfect.” Tony keens, and Steve watches tears leak out of the corner of his eyes. “It’s ok, I’ll take care of you. I’ve got you.” Steve doesn’t want to remove his hands from Tony’s shoulders, so he leans down and kisses the tears away, one and then the other.
“Why are omegas weak? Think back. What omega did you know that was weak?” He thinks of Edit, Brenna, Colleen. He thinks of the other nameless omegas he saw and all of their names, faces, lives. Once, he had been—no. But, yes. He had been an omega. An asthmatic omega with scoliosis and other ailments. Weak. Needing help. With Bucky always looking out for him. Was it…? Did he hate himself? No, he was always meant to be alpha. But he
“No, Tony. You did things the way you wanted to, and that’s all that matters.”
The lobby is blissfully empty as he exits the stairwell sans one figure. Sam stands off to the side, Redwing flitting around his head, and a trill of noise from Redwing has Sam looking up to meet Tony’s gaze.
“Ma’am.”
“If you had an ounce of respect, it would change.” Steve’s eyes are a dark blue, and he looms above Tony now, arms crossed in a defensive position. If anyone needs defending, it’s Tony.
“Hi, Steve. Come hang out with Bucky and me!”
Tony had always expected that finding the right scent would feel like Spanish Inquisition. He’d feel attacked, trapped by some aggressive scent that reminded him of home, of Howard.
So he lets it out, his face twisting and crumpling up, his lips pinched with grief over his life, his lack of choices, over every hard thing he’s ever had to endure or overcome. Images of Pepper, Obie, Rhodey, his father float up as he closes his eyes against reality. And lastly, comes Steve. The man who tentatively walked into this room and gave Tony objectively the best sex of his life. Steve broke him into caring, into wanting.
"I spy with my little eye..." Happy's sentence drifted off as he was trying to find something that would work. "Something... blue."
There was something different in Tony's eyes that Steve haven't noticed before, it looked like happiness that he never had before. It certainly wasn't there when Steve first moved in, but the point was that it was there now and it was a good feeling.
"What's the matter?" Although Steve knew what Tony was trying to get across he didn't want to let him know that he knew what was going on. He could tell that Tony was nervous enough and didn't want to make it worse. "You know you can tell me anything, right?"
Three days. It had been three days since Tony has come out of his room at all for any reason. Steve had tried to get him to come out, whether it be to watch a movie or a TV show, to eat, or just go outside in general, but nothing was working. Tony just refused to go anywhere, he was so close to finishing the armor and didn’t want to stop now. The only reason he ate at all was if Steve forced him to eat, and the only reason he slept was if he passed out from exhaustion. During the summer he did go out with the rest of their friends, but now he was isolating himself again and it wasn’t healthy at all.
"Oh, no, no. I think I'm goo-" Steve put Tony's hand in the bowl of cold water forcibly, causing him to yelp loudly. "Goddammit, Rogers! That hurts!"
"It's a hangover, what do you think?" He snapped but not meaning too. "Have you even had a hangover before? I can't see you being the type of person to drink- well, maybe, but probably just one or two beers so you're tipsy-"
He supposes he can just let Tony’s budget go back to what it was and just… monitor it. He should see what these events that Tony goes to are like. Whether they are or aren’t appropriate for Tony.
“I can’t stop you. But just remember this country is a democracy, Tony. If Stern has enough people in his pocket for a vote, which I don’t think he does, but if he does, you could be looking at being forced to give them possession of the suit!” Stern’s pockets were big, but not that big. There was only so much money in the world, and Tony had a lot of it. It wasn’t a sure thing, legally keeping the suit, but he had better than Vegas odds. Illegally? If it came down to it, he’d make his tech useless before they stole it.
Filled with confidence and determination, he swipes at a piece of toast and shoves half of it into his mouth, biting off a large chunk and chewing it quickly. If he hurries, the scent will last for long enough for Tony to race after Steve and find him early. Gorging himself on coffee, over-easy eggs, and toast, he makes sure to wipe the yolk off his face and down the last of his drink. It’s always so good, and Tony smiles into his mug.
“We know you’re trying. It’s hard to change. We had to give up our lives to get out. As long as you don’t make him give up his, you’re doing the best you can,” Tracy says.
with pleasure and Steve can feel Tony clamp down on his cock, his omega coming hard. Steve doesn’t pause in his fierce, powerful rhythm. He rides out Tony’s clenching and clutching at his cock.
“You seem relaxed Tony. What’s new?” Nat choses that moment to enter the kitchen, and Steve tenses up, wondering if she’s noticed his behavior. Of all the wild cards at play, Nat is the one Steve has real unfeigned fears of. If she finds out, which she may well do, he doesn’t know what her reaction will be. He suspects it would be to interfere, or stop him.
An Omega’s tears will drag all of this to a halt, unless they’re from pleasure. The scent of sadness is an automatic turnoff for most Alphas, including Steve. And he can already scent the fear in Tony, which is almost too much, to begin with.
They don’t have time to knock boots before Bruce is having Tony ramp up the aerosolization of the cure. The plan is that Tony takes the stairs and sprays the spare people that have been wandering there as though they’re pernicious weeds. Clint will take to the vents, leaving nebulizers to rain mist down onto the groups on the floor itself, but not before making an unholy racket in order to drive the masses towards the cure.
He very much dislikes feeling wrong-footed. He thought he was done with that after his realignment, yet there’s something about Rogers that makes him off balance every time. Pesky, useless
He’s done with Nat’s new toys within a day before moving onto providing Clint with endless practice arrows. Then he spends time working on making a decent pair of pants for Bruce when he hulks out. He does not think about how the same fabric could have good implications for the Captain’s uniform. No, he saves that for last, like the procrastinator perfectionist he is. His identity has always been wrapped up in the things he creates for others. He’s not sure he could stand the rejection, so he’s got to make anything for the Captain look impeccable.
“I do. I’ll be looking forward to your knot in the next couple of days.”
“I want to ride you.” Tony’s body jerks forward, his cock bumping into Steve’s, and just like that, all his focus drops into his cock, and reveals his own desperation to be used. With it comes a certain pride; Tony trusts him for this. Trusts him to be the alpha he needs to see him through this heat. He’s denied the other man affection, care, all in the name of correcting behavior, when that was never how it was supposed to be. Steve is a protector, an instrument of Tony’s pleasure, the truth of which now comes down on him like a lash, driving him to
“You can’t be serious. You cannot be fucking serious. This is—no. You’re not staying married to me. We’re not doing this at all, ever. And who are you to say I need a keeper? I’ve been just fine all my life.” Anthony rolls up his sleeves, holds his chin high, and glowers. It looks far too appealing on his features. Steve is going to have to watch for Anthony trying to get him to indulge whatever vices he’s picked up.
“We’ll see. For now, let’s get out of here.”
“It’s premature, but I think Tony’s brain thought it was drifting with a second person… all the time. So naturally, his brain wouldn’t take the full neural load until his partner dialed in. This is
The two alphas look between each other, and the sparks that used to be the friendship Tony had seen initially start to shine through the cracks.
“No time for Tonys in this world, Steve,” he chokes out a laugh. Because there really isn’t room for Tony in Tony’s life. He doesn’t have Pepper anymore, and that’s for the best because she couldn’t stand his other job, Iron Man. And the world needs Iron Man, just as SI needs Tony Stark, the mask in front of the man.
She takes in the two of them, her hand tightening around Clint’s as Steve’s expression
“Really? You really want to ask that question?”
“Here’s the letter that was meant to be for our run.” Sam hands it over, holding onto the edge of it until Tony looks up and meets his eyes. The air feels heavy around them, like this moment is important, the words carrying monumental weight. “I’m glad it’s you, Tony.”
The show has begun.
“Let’s play a little game. Tell me one time where you’ve done amazing things in regards to Tony. Then tell me something he has done that you didn’t like or made you angry. Next, tell me about some of the bad things you’ve done to Tony.”
It’s this moment that Steve gets to see what he’s been looking for.
Steve looks as the alpha gazes down at him, he suspects the latter.
“Technically, Steve has the authority to speak for you.” Hill offers, unwanted.
He’s dressed in a suit that wouldn’t look out of place on an alpha, and Steve thinks something must have gone awry for Anthony to think he can walk around with an exposed neck and incorrectly gendered clothes. Maybe things have changed, but it still looks out of place to Steve.
“Is there anything I can do?” Steve asks.
“What is it? Did something happen?” Steve asks.
It’s just so hard though, to think about Tony defiling himself. But he shouldn’t say anything, because he knows Tony will come down hard on him.
“Symbiote liquid metal armor. It’s cool as fuck.” The shiny metal reaches for him, its slippery limbs outstretched to wrap around his arm and then his entire body. It’s fucking hot, to be honest. He turns himself on just by wearing it. Which, he hasn’t had sex in the suit—yet—but he’s going to.
“So I have to marry this omega? You’re certain?” It’s been a surprise to everyone, including Steve, that Captain America is alive and kicking and able to fulfill contractual obligations.
Their arms automatically move to protect their head, but it’s too late as the glass crunches, then caves in, claws reaching for the both of them.
Steve extends his hand out as Tony takes it, pliant and suggestible. Just like Fury explained he would be. He leads Tony out the door, to the elevator, down to the garage where a car that has no GPS tracking waits. It’s SHIELD issued, and it’ll take longer to find than it will to bond Tony. By the time anyone looks, there won’t be a chance in hell that Tony isn’t Steve’s already.
ways to go out.
“I should be dead.” Clint’s first words are rough, and the man coughs briefly. Bruce holds up a cup of water with a straw, which Clint drinks, grateful.
“I suppose I have to try. I’ll think about what you said.”
“I don’t see your husband. Just a drink Tony. He won’t care if you’re late.” That’s not wrong. Steve is indulgent. He’s kind when it comes to these little things that happen to Tony.
“Hi, we’ve met,” he ignored Natalie in favor of going for Fury’s jugular. “So, what Fury, are you going to come Mike Wazowski me in my own home from under my bed if I don’t go public with Iron Man and join your little team? Or maybe you’re more of a closet monster.” It almost didn’t hurt seeing his assistant betray Pepper and him like that. He should have known that any woman who could knock another person flat on their back in a second was never going to be defined as normal. He would have to take a look at how they were able to compile her identity in such an organic fashion. But mostly, he was reminded of Stane. Which was something he kept buried with lack of sleep, copious amounts of alcohol, work, sex, and now, dying. Stane had company in this little mental dungeon; Howard and Afghanistan were not, and maybe not ever, ready for any kind of emotional processing. Natalie he had already processed into category “Alpha dickhead.”
“Look, I’ll be honest with you too, since we’re friends, but you seem to have this opinion of omegas where they’re inferior to you. How can your omega want to be with you as an equal if you can never see him that way?” Steve had never thought of it that way before, but he realizes that Iron Man is right. He’s always seen Tony as someone who needed caring for, but not someone who can be responsible for the caring of himself. He’s questioned Tony’s decisions, his life, everything about him. It isn’t possible to easily apologize for that. For woefully underestimating and undervaluing someone’s faculties.
“Oh, it must have been when you were both young. It’s illegal now, but for those contracts that have been grandfathered in. Well, that’s good of you to not force him. Though you, the alpha, can just plead infidelity? That’s how people usually get out.”
—before Steve, Tony had never felt as if he was the first priority, the thing that makes life’s difficulties worth it. Not his parents, not Pepper, not
His heart aches. He’s so confused and twisted up. The idea that all this was going on in his neighborhood, on his doorstep, the entire time. It almost defies comprehension. But Edith has no reason to lie. No reason to know him or tell him what Fury and Nat want him to hear. She’s just this harmless old omega. Sweet tempered, even if her dreams of being a singer are not ones he’d condone. Even so, her alpha spanked her, just like he had with Tony, and he feels something ugly curdle in his gut.
At the peak of his climax, Steve breaks his pace, stuttering, before he presses in deep and comes. Tony can feel the man’s balls spasming tight against him, tightening and releasing as he steadily pumps heated liquid into Tony. The knot tugs at his cunt, and Steve pushes it in deeper, the head hitting the back of Tony’s cervix.
Natasha tightens and grabs onto Clint, who is gazing darkly at the machine in front of them.
Right now he knows that Tony is just play-acting at accepting the deal. Tony wants to hear the rest of it before he decides his plan of action. They’ve been opponents before, and it’s given Steve a new and better perspective on Tony’s strategies. Not that he hasn’t always known Tony’s play.
Tony sits at the island counter, new fork in hand as he cuts into the food. He starts eating as quickly as possible, making Steve want to slow him down. But he’s learned at this point it’s better to pick his battles.
“So good. Beautiful, the way you take me all the way in. Going to knot you, breed you, and keep you full. So full of me. Ride me, sweet omega. Be a good boy.” Tony groans at Steve’s words, and his face relaxes into a delicate expression of longing, as fragile as new ice. Tony rides him then, bouncing himself up and down on Steve’s cock like he was made for it. Steve reaches for Tony’s erection, helping his omega along so that his own orgasm, which is sneaking up on him rapidly, is timed with Tony’s.
“No you don’t, Steve. Sit down and wait.” After not being the one in charge, Tony is well and tired of it. He has ultimatums to deliver, stress to alleviate.
Tony feels a moment of dread—what day
“Look at you. So fucking messy. JARVIS, take a picture.” Hot shame rushes through Steve. He knows his face looks like a disaster. Tony will clean it up later, a hot cloth dragging across his stubble, prepping him to be found by SHIELD just in time, but for now, he looks as broken down as he feels. Wet, humiliated putty in Tony’s hands.
But why does that feel so good? His provider instincts must be confused. Steve is alpha. Alphas protect the home. It has to be an instinctual spillover from Tony being ill and needy. Steve isn’t going to be cooking forever. That’s for omegas.
“I ended up in South Williamsburg. Not far enough away from Conall, not really. But he never came looking. I lucked out there. Some of the other girls not so much. The church provided everything for us, which wasn’t much, but it was ours. I took up work as a seamstress, and eventually, I became the head of the group that housed us omegas. Some of them got out of much worse situations than myself. Sometimes–sometimes we couldn’t get them away completely. They’d come to us broken, too broken. And those times… We did what we could. There were no laws to protect us and no repercussions for using corporal punishment on omegas. Say, hey, have you seen that new bill that they’re going to ban the use of any physical punishment on omegas? Why I never thought I’d see the day. About time too. Now well, there are hardly any alphas that spank anymore, but there’s a few out there. That’ll take care of that.” Edith visibly shudders.
“He’s safe with me,” Steve promises.
The sheer sensation of getting what he wants overwhelms him, and as he walks over, he finds himself drawn to Steve’s lips like a magnet, latching on as he made it to kissing distance. Steve doesn’t rebuke him but lets him suck on the plumpness there, wetting and kneading it with his teeth before he moved up for the main course.
“I’m yours.”
Tony would never have to conceal himself again. Not with Steve. Steve would always be there to protect him from the way the world seems to ravage Tony’s sensitivities.
“We’ll see.”
Tony isn’t looking at him. Instead, his eyes are fixed on some far off point, and he seems folded in on himself in embarrassment. Steve puts a hand on Tony’s shoulder, but the omega shrugs it off, stepping away from Steve and looking wide-eyed at him as if he just realized Steve was there.
“So Tony can choose to run rampant with drinking and promiscuity.”
“Ah but darling, I can smell that he hasn’t touched you. You’re as fresh as you were the first time you came to me. We had some good times, didn’t we baby.”
Pepper has a hair extension in from where he got a hold of a large tuft of her hair. She also has an entirely new set of heels for every day of the month. Steve thinks it’s vulgar to buy someone’s forgiveness, but he understands that Tony doesn’t know how to be emotionally available and he can’t promise he won’t do it again. Now that Bucky is on board, Tony won’t have to deal with these erratic mood swings in rut. His heat will make him tractable. Steve imagines that Tony will be sweet, the kind of Omega who wants to cuddle and be touched. Tony hasn’t had enough of that in his life.
Thor and Loki stand across from one another and activate the power of the Tesseract to go to their Realm. In a haze of blue light the brothers disappear into the aether.
“Where are we on the cure?” He asks.
“He didn’t ask for any of those things?” At this point, Steve would be with Tony in that way if that’s what it took. But Tony doesn’t want that. That pricks at his pride, that Tony doesn’t
“I’d ask where you’ve been, but we don’t have time for that. Tony is looking for you.” She glares at Steve.
“No! Just. Let’s wait out the symptoms, ok? Please. And maybe get Bruce?” Steve abruptly stops and lets Tony slink back to the ground, and Tony is so grateful, because if Steve saw his erection, surely he’d think so poorly of him. Though another part of him desperately wants to know if Steve is at all interested. Plenty of aliens have enjoyed fucking him. He’s eminently fuckable. If Steve asked, he’d bang him like a screen door in a hurricane. Maybe he should let Steve get a look.
Only Rhodey knew his secret because it was Rhodey’s alpha hormones he’d first extracted to use for the suppressant.
He had. He was that man. He was Rory, Sean, Connall, Angela’s husband. He was all those men and when he saw himself reflected back, he shinks back from it.
“Do you kiss Fury’s ass with that mouth? Of the people in this room, which one is A. wearing a spangly outfit, and B. not of use?” Tony hits the man where it hurts. Soldiers are one and the same. He’s had Rhodey figured out for a long time, and he uses that as a template to understand what makes Rogers tick. Little Army boys despise the insinuation that they can’t do a whit of good in the present situation.
“I tried to protect you, even with the suit, all I’ve ever wanted was to protect you. And I know you deserve better—”
“The new thing now is that omegas can be traded between families. As long as you have another omega to replace the one, you can trade. It used to be an uncommon thing, but it’s coming back now that betrothals have been outlawed. There’s entire markets built on trading omegas for marriage. Can you imagine someone doing that to their daughter? I’m lucky I got out without being pregnant. Not everyone is so lucky, sorry Angela.”
“I held Sunset’s hand to her own neck and choked her with it. She recorded everything, Tony. I took it for you.” Tony groans and presses himself up against Steve, hard. The long planes of their bodies rub together like a washboard, each lean piece playing a tune of love as the muscles roll and shift together like a bow and its violin.
“So I ran. I’m still running. David can’t find me and Madison here. I’m working on divorce proceedings now, but David, he keeps trying to find me. I don’t know why I agreed to this meeting today. I think I did because I didn’t want to be scared anymore. David can’t walk in here and get me. He can’t take my money again. He can’t take my daughter. She’s an omega, and this isn’t the life I’d want her to live. I’m doing this so she doesn’t have to live this way.”
“Fine, but don’t interfere.” Steve places a knee on the bed, and Tony startles, not quite ready for what he thinks might happen.
Creatures are not inherently evil, but this one, with its razor fangs and bellowing screech, might be. Tony considers whether they bred these creatures, and thinks they must have.
He lets Steve pull him up and away for breakfast.
Fury stays silent again, waiting.
Steve’s eyes widen and his military parade rest crumbles. Steve brushes her aside and leaps towards the training centers.
“So the moral of the story is that I won’t ever do something like that again, and you won’t keep it from me when you find Steve the next time a giant monster tears him out of our suit.”
The truth is more complex, in that Steve’s Alpha nature is not something Tony knows at all. Steve hasn’t shown him. Usually his morality would stop him, but he’s wanted for so long now, and he knows, knows that Tony would be happy with him, that it’s easy to be selfish, just this once.
“You are precious, to be taken care of. I’m taking care of you, and I know you don’t see that right now, but I need you to understand that this is going to be hard at first, but when we’re done, you’ll be much happier.”
“No, I’m going to carry it, it’s mine anyway.” The omega is holding a large bag that looks heavy.
Conditions. Tony had conditions.
“Oh no darling, it’ll just turn you into one of
His hand comes down and thwacks loudly onto Tony’s bottom. Tony flinches and whines once, saying nothing.
“Steve, Steve please,” Tony mumbles. Steve instinctively lifts Tony up and off him and places him on his hands and knees. “Steve, please, I’ve been so good,” Tony cries.
“Oh, I see, so you want me playing in the Pink Sheets. I’m not on the fucking Exchange, Steve. My company is privately held by myself and a handful of investors. Most of whom I bought out over the years. Do you know what it cost me to get that kind of control? Millions. I don’t have nearly as much money as you think, because I tied it up in making sure no one could take SI away from an omega. It’s mine. My money I make on the stock market is mine. And you may think you own me, but you don’t. SI will still be mine even after you’ve exited my life stage fucking left. As will my stocks. So kindly, fuck off.” Tony is sputtering by the end of his speech, hands smashed on the counter as he leans over and hisses out his disagreement to him. Steve doesn’t think he’s ever seen an omega act so upset before. It’s like Steve is trying to hurt him, Tony is so vociferous in his manner of speaking. Steve is just here, trying to help, and Tony takes it as though he’s done something awful.
The lighting in the workshop matches the sound, and he comes upon DUM-E and U swaying to the beat, dunce caps on either of their support struts and mini spinning noisemakers in their claws.
That’s not what’s happening here, however, and he steels himself before biting down on the firm piece of flesh. He feels it pierce and a rush of copper stains the inside of his mouth. Tony doesn’t make so much as a whimper.
. It drips down the side of the couch and coils about his legs and reaches up to press against his scrotum and perineum. It’s a soft hum there, pulsating against him, and Steve smiles wickedly at Tony. Tony bites his lip and manages to pull his under armor off the rest of the way, leaving him entirely in the nude but for his symbiote.
He opens the letter.
“Well, maybe you should have had Captain America call.” Tony levels a wink at the grim-looking man beside Maria, “I’ll always have time for him.”
“Brenna Clarke, née Burke and Colleen Byrne, née Smith, mid to late 30s, both omegas. Not sure if they made it through the system the church had going here at the time, but they’d be in the birth, marriage, and death records. I’m just trying to see what happened to them.”
“Come on Steve, Tony’s a jerk, but he’s not wrong. Tell me this doesn’t smell a little funky to you?” Oh it’s Steve is it? He has a momentary flare of judgment for Banner, but he reasons that the other scientist is on his side and is just doing his best to relieve the tension.
Vanko, whose father, fairly or unfairly, his own father had deported.
“Tony, we’ve been calling you repeatedly. He escaped SHIELD custody and caused immense amounts of damage.” Maybe she has a point on the ‘being angry’ thing. It wasn’t the greatest when the kid destroyed a part of his home either, but SHIELD’s problems weren’t his, and now that the kid has served one purpose, he’s thought of a few more.
Every time Steve went to the workshop, which was often, Tony welcomed him with a singular glee and burst of arousal. Those initial moments were hard; Tony’s body wasn’t ready to be taken. His slick hadn’t settled in and Steve wanted his first time with Tony to be when he was fully Omega. He knew with singular purpose that there would be nothing else in this world like sinking into Tony’s wet heat, and if it meant waiting a week, and ensuring that no one interfered, he would do anything to ensure that.
“Yeah, Tony,” Steve says as he reaches Tony’s half-hard cock. With that, Tony can feel every pump of blood into his dick that makes him harder within seconds of Steve’s touch.
Cap gives out the orders and Tony snatches up Barton as he’s told to monitor the perimeter. He’s not the only flyer, but it makes the most sense having him be the whale-wrangler.
That’s when the sky groans with something like the sound of a whale on sonor.
“This has nothing to do with Tony and everything to do with your actions. The responsibility is on you. You did this. You suffer the consequences. Not Tony. Play it again with me. My little game. One more time.”
“Ah, I see your value to Fury now. Are you always his mouthpiece or do you take breaks to eat? Yeah, so, following is not really my style. I’ll let you take that one Captain Sparkles.” Tony has had it with this guy. His body still wants him, inexplicably. But that’s overwhelmed by the sheer amount of desire he has to punch the man in his beautiful fucking face. The man is logical to the point of irrationality, in that he can’t even think for himself. He’s been sucking on SHIELD’s tit for far too long.
Killian withdraws, calculation flitting over his face. Whatever he reasons out, he doesn’t like the odds on, and he nods at Steve and then Tony.
Steve wonders if the reeducation will include ways to get Tony to comply. That’s what he hopes.
He thinks that Tony might be right, that Tony isn’t fitting the mold of a regular omega, but for the life of him, Steve can’t figure out why. He’s tried everything but holding Tony’s hand through all of it. Which he shouldn’t have to do.
“Thank you for sharing Angela,” Natasha says, breaking him from his thoughts. He can smell the fear in Angela, but the determination as well. Trevor sits silent at her side, his hand on her shoulder.
“Please. Don’t,” Steve chokes out, begging.
“I didn’t want to hurt you.” Steve’s eyes are boring into him, the blood on his face accentuating the hollowed-out stare that he’s giving Tony.
“What is this going to do to help teach Tony to be an omega?”
Tony is above all that.
Steve looks like he wants to snarl at Bucky and say more, but instead he reaches for Tony’s leg, getting a good grip around his ankle and yanking Tony down. Tony tries to claw at the sheets and pillows, but there’s no hold on anything, and he finds himself squirming under Steve.
He pays cash for the blankets and pillows. He doesn’t want any trail leading to these purchases. Bottled water, other snacks, and ample towels join the mix of soft things Steve buys for his Omega’s nest. Other than that, Steve meticulously washes each item, using the least scented laundry detergent he can find that’s designed for Omegas and their sensitive skin and nose.
“Steve,” Tony says, and Steve focuses on every facet of Tony then, using his spoken name to draw him into Tony’s curves, the divots of his spine where sweat has collected, the heart shaped frame where Tony’s ass meets Steve’s body. Giving it one last glimpse, he rolls them over to their sides, Tony tucked in front of him, a treasure.
“Is there anything else you need?” Aisling is back to her upbeat smile and helpful attitude, leaving behind Brenna and Colleen’s lives as easy as pie. Steve can’t shake it off though. Can’t imagine that while he was in the war, these women were enduring the unendurable in their homes. Things that Steve would have done to them had he stayed in that time as an alpha. Hell, he doesn’t even know anymore what a proper omega is supposed to look like in this day and age.
“So are they fire proof and bullet proof?” Steve asks.
“Ok, it’s going to be ok. We’ll get through this. We have to. Oh god.” He tenses up with feeling, gazing into Steve’s beautiful blue eyes. Have they ever been so crystalline? Whatever this is, it’s turning Tony into a bad poet. He needs to rein it in, but whatever this is, insists on running up and down his spine like little pinpricks over his skin, and spurring his ever-rising libido into action.
“That’s all I need then.” And Bucky is on him, lips and teeth clacking against Tony’s, his hands roving around Tony’s frame, pressing into his skin. Tony groans, his nails biting into his palms as he clenches his fists, trying to resist. These alphas, they take what they want, and they don’t care about the consequences for any omega. Tony is so tired. He’s barely even relieved that it’s not a game, but the thought crosses his mind that it’s more frightening now that he knows this isn’t for fun.
Which is how he found himself sitting in a giant fiberglass doughnut, scheming how to eat doughnuts in public as Iron Man.
“I just went out for a second.” Fear flits across Tony’s face. Steve’s anger softens a little at it. When did Tony have any reason to fear him? It twists uncomfortably in his gut. It’s not a look he ever expected to see. He doesn’t know what he’s done to earn Tony’s fear, but he wants it gone.
“What—”
him. Steve can tell that Tony wants him to fill Tony up with his big alpha cock, that’s so thick and hard, there’s no room for any thought that isn’t
The betrothal had been done in specific to keep Stark Industries, SI, from becoming someone else’s property. Circumstances had allowed Howard, who was previously in control of Steve’s meager estate, to arrange a marriage between his son and the MIA Captain America.
It’s easy, drifting off like that as he listens to the soft grunts and huffs of breath of the man behind him. Tony is looking off to the right, towards the door when he shifts position to the left to get more comfortable.
Tony looks thoroughly debauched, and his gaze is heated on Steve, eyes following his every move. There’s the push-pull of Tony’s muscles under his symbiote suit that draws Steve’s eye, and he brings his hand up to run his fingers down Tony’s pectoral muscles, dragging ever so gently with his nails while he still clutches at Tony’s face. The symbiote shudders, liquid wrapping around Steve’s hands and trailing up his arms, coming to rest over his chest as it starts to tweak his nipples. Steve pants, bringing his mouth back to Tony’s as they meet in a clash of teeth and tongue.
Tony lives in a tower, where everything he needs is catered to him and all of his extraneous household duties are done for him.
“You won’t get a scent, because I wear the best suppressors on the market. Though I have half a mind to not wear them at all, see how long you last in the field when your prejudices are up your nose and around the corner.”
“Oh, you’re sorry now? I should be hospitalized more often.”
“Tony wants to be with me. And we can’t be together if he’s an Alpha. That’s consent enough to do this,” Steve insists.
“No, let me go grab a piece for you. One moment,” the salesperson says.
He screams, kicking more, scrabbling at the ground with his hands, elbows digging into the dirt beneath him.
Fury had said he would be thirty minutes earlier than the Alpha, to get his bearings. Tony also shouldn’t bother trying to get in sooner; his code wouldn’t work. Tony didn’t want to admit that half an hour was on the lower end of calming the panic attack he could feel just under his skin. Which could also be his heat. Or both.
Steve’s fat Alpha knot was puffing in preparation now and Steve’s thighs started to tremble. Tony knows what’s about to happen. He feels his channel like a furnace, gripping Steve’s cock like it was meant to be filled all the time.
What are they going to do? Whoever that was will be coming for them. Maybe not soon, but Tony can’t fathom how they wouldn’t want revenge for what just happened.
The mug clattered to the floor, handle cracking off and tumbling towards toe-kick of the island. There wasn’t much coffee left, but what was remaining had Jackson Pollack’d the entire side of the cabinetry, brown little streaks racing their way down to the bottom.
“Oh, this is nice. This must have been expensive.” Tony holds the blanket up to the air and examines it, rubbing his thumbs along the seams at the top where he’s gripping the fabric.
“How–what? Tony, I have to–” Steve choked on his last sentence before turning away and walking at a brisk pace to the far wall. With Steve out of his range, Tony snatched up the helmet and yanked it back on.
And Steve said it back.
Colleen and Sean Byrne.
The doors open to the workshop and the upbeat but mellow sounds of a 30s dance band filters through the air. Jack Hylton croons through the speakers, and Tony cracks a smile remembering how he’d poked fun at Steve for his musical tastes being the exact same as Fallout 3, a game which Steve would never go within a million miles of. So Tony had
“Oh yeah, well, don’t tell anyone, but Tony Stark made it. It’s not a secret, but he doesn’t like to have it spread around so much. No idea why, the man’s been a godsend for our charity work. He donated the whole thing to us for free and he donates a ton of money each year.”
“Fuck.” Tony grabs his lab coat, and his shoes and runs barefoot out of the room, leaving Steve behind.
Sleep is calling him, and he answers in the immediate, trudging off to try and sleep the day off.
Finally, the wolf stops and huffs again, and steps forward. Its hot breath is back on his neck, and he whimpers plaintively.
Tony is incredible, skin so soft and firm, so warm and yielding. It’s then that Tony starts to come, cock jerking in Steve’s hand, threads of spend spitting their way out. Tony is gripping his cock now, and it feels electrifying, which is when Steve surrenders to the sensation and comes with Tony, letting go of everything.
“I can share with Stevie. No one else though. You’re,” Bucky pauses, ruminating, “ours.”
Steve now has Tony bouncing on his cock, suspended in mid-air, chest to chest as Steve hauls him up and down. Their bodies slide together, sweat slicking their skin as Tony listens to the lewd slap of his body slamming down on Steve. Tony’s arms and torso are cinched tight against Steve, and he feels secure in a way he hasn’t been in so long. Steve will never drop him, never let him go without making sure he’s safe. For once, after everything that’s happened before, Tony believes that Steve is there for him this time. That there aren’t lies between them or petty battles to be fought.
“Now, moving on, you’ve been playing on the stock exchange with large amounts of money for some time.”
“What are your sins, my son?”
As he does so, a few of the creatures get a good bite in, piercing his bicep and the back of his neck. It stings, and he thinks about how filthy the wound would be with their mouths being full of other people’s blood. In any case, he’s not going to get the chance to die of infection.
They hug
“It’s not just you anymore that’s at stake. SHIELD can’t abide by a scandal, and you are scandal-prone. If you—” Fury starts.
“What just happened? Please tell me nobody kissed me.” He can’t look away from Steve, whose eyes are piercing into Tony’s now. He wants to crawl and hide from the Alpha who looks like a cross between angry and shocked.
“I know you, and I know that’s not as true as you want it to be Tony. Please, just try.” She was going to be so disappointed in Tony when she found out about everything. Tony was already disappointed in Tony. Not Howard Stark levels of disappointed, but getting there with every failed effort he’d made thus far to replace the palladium in the arc reactor that resulted in a tantrum Tony couldn’t explain to her. He couldn’t tell her why he acted out. He couldn’t tell her he was dying. He couldn’t tell her that his genius, the only thing that felt like his, and not his designation, had failed him.
He wakes up at six and goes for a quick run, something he hasn’t done all week. He tries hard not to check on Tony, but he gives in and goes down to the workshop to peer through the window and see the omega still working in the same outfit as last night. Steve doesn’t think he’s gone to sleep, and the idea is aggravating, but he remembers what the medical personnel said and doesn’t interrupt.
He’s moving back and forth above them, firing at will against the Chitauri speeders that keep attempting to interrupt their conversation.
Oh. Oh, she was serious.
“Let’s go somewhere private,” Natasha says. He follows them to an empty conference room and settles into a chair. Both of them are wearing SHIELD issued relaxing clothes, though Hawkeye clearly has something against sleeves, and has ripped his off the t-shirt.
“So you’re going to take his choice away?” Bucky’s voice is flat, and Steve knows he’s treading on unsteady ground. What Hydra did to Bucky was awful, but at the end of it, Bucky has come out stronger and more balanced than the man he once knew in the 40s. It’s more than a silver lining; Bucky is free. Like Steve was made free when Erskine used the formula on him.
Steve rotates his hips just so, catching against the rim of Tony’s ass before glancing up to find Tony’s wide eyes dancing back. The heat calls to him and captures him like water in oil, Steve struggling for sanity when all he wishes to do is bury himself to the hilt. Tony’s lips are incredibly appealing, and he makes for them, fleeing his own mind for the refuge of Tony’s mouth.
“All that matters now, is what Tony wants–” He knew Natasha would make the best of an uncomfortable situation, and he’s grateful for her discretion in the matter. It’ll go a long way towards bringing Bruce around, who, besides Pepper and Rhodes, is the one member of the team he feared alienating most. Bruce is a beta, but the Hulk is an Alpha.
“Were you even going to go?”
“Captain—” Steve pulls out and settles behind Tony, lean legs smearing into the slick that covers Tony’s thighs. He lines up his cock, meticulous. Presses the head in to dip at Tony’s lush entrance.
This is the hardest thing he’ll ever do. He doesn’t know what is going to happen, and if Tony agrees to what he’s proposing, where he’ll end up. Knowing the right thing to do and acting on it is beyond difficult; it seizes his body up in paroxysms of fear and want. He wants to turn back, leave, pretend as if he’s not going to do this. He wants to unravel history, go back to the first moment he saw Tony and stick out his hand in greeting instead of what he’s done.
“Omega.” Cap says it like a prayer, like he’s grateful Tony is ok, after all the time they spent insulting each other. Condescending prick of an Alpha.
His morose thoughts are interrupted by the beeping of their homemade, All-American Tesseract finder. As the majority of the group follows Bruce over to the terminal, Tony makes to leave, hoping to get to his suit.
Certain people named Steve.
“Uh, raise the mid-mast,” he points at one side of the room, and then the other, “ship the topsails. That man is playing Galaga! Thought we wouldn’t notice. But we did.” Damn it they’re still looking at him. Time for some sleight of hand.
“No. There was a cellist, I think.” He knows. Tony plays pensive nonchalance, unwilling to engage with Cap more than necessary.
Things are going so well that he has time to imagine other pursuits. He taps into the cameras around SHIELD and looks for a particular blond as he slips from stream to stream. There’s good reasons for this, he knows. Captain America could put a damper on his plans, and he doesn’t want that. But the even better reason is that maybe it’s time to do something about his crush.
“Ok Tony, whatever you say.” Tony shuffles away back to his room, dragging his blanket with him.
It’s seconds later that Rogers is there. He snatches him up, and runs his hands over Tony’s arms and then torso. It’s almost clinical, and Tony suspects it’s standard for soldiers to check over each other. Tony is still distressed at the proprietary way Rogers is touching him, fingertips pressing into his skin.
“Look, how can you have a peaceful military industrial complex? Well, it may be difficult if you can’t trust anything the military does and the entire concept of weapons buying peace is a lie created by unseen overlords of endless deceptive power. Usually I never have to say the last part, but everybody understands what’s happening.” Tony wondered if Obie would have been charged for kidnapping, with all the contracts he ensured were fulfilled. They’d probably treat him the way the catholic church treats pedophiles: pay everyone to shut up and shuffle onto the next company where he can underhandedly sell guns to terrorists again, justifying the use of extreme force and superior weaponry from, you guessed it, the military.
“Yes, fine, I will take it.” Tony shuffles out of the kitchen, and Steve is left with cleanup. Yes, it’s best to pick his battles.
Tony remembers the feel of the cloth down his back, his chest, and most especially the gentle swipes at his wet and gaping hole. Dollops of cum seeped out of him in the water, the trail of white dispersed by Steve’s dip of his hands into the tub. Another way of claiming, as Steve gently kissed him. Breathless, open-mouthed kisses, with Steve’s hot tongue swirling around his own, licking at his teeth and gums.
“You heard, I see. Was he married?” Without the HUD, Cap looks human, touchable. Tony wishes he still had his mask. Rogers looks unruffled from the fight, leaned up against the wall with his arms crossed, his flexor muscles taut. Tony doesn’t like what it says about him that he notices. Tony doesn’t notice people, but he notices Steve Rogers.
He gets a nose straight into his crack for his impertinence, and he yelps, wiggling forward and pulling at the ground with his hands.
“Sounds good.” That was a dismissal if he ever heard one. He did as Tony said and found the credit card, but he didn’t know where to go or what to buy. Taking a risk, he dialed Natasha, who had been programmed into his phone.
Next was a brine-y flavor with a tinge of dead fish; the Alpha probably thought he smelled like the ocean. Then rotting wood in the forest. Fruit Loops. My god, an Alpha was out there, right now, walking around smelling like a cereal box.
He wants the right to towel off the blood from Tony’s battles, to gentle the Omega with firm hands at his hips and Tony keening with need for Steve, his Alpha.
When Steve flips him over, casually manhandling Tony with the ease of a super soldier, Tony thrusts his ass back to Steve, presenting his now-used hole for his alpha.
“Is this where you tell me you’ve murdered someone and need help moving the body? Because we aren’t that close.” Iron Man chuckles at his own joke and kicks at the ground, dislodging some gravel.
“I guess that’s all I can ask.” They end lunch then, without eating. Steve isn’t hungry anyway. He wanders up to SI, looking at the tall building that’s all Tony’s. One of many, if the reports are to be believed. Tony has been managing this on his own with the help of Pepper and others, but Steve still thinks that Tony’s life would be better served not having to deal with all of this. Tony will be happy, eventually, with the rules that Steve is putting into place.
The battle means nothing when it comes to Pepper. Nothing. As the drones count down, Tony pushes the limits of the suit to reach the woman he’s come to think of as a partner, more than a friend.
“Yes, but I don’t see how that has anything to do with what happened to Tony.”
We are terrible for one another, and yes we are a disaster. But tell me your heart doesn’t race for a hurricane, or a burning building. I’d rather die terrified, than live forever. - A Softer World
After he’s done drinking his fill of the suffering of the Bay Area’s citizens, he returns home to host a party for those wealthy enough to purchase Extremis on the daily. It’s a party to end all parties. And with a champagne glass in hand, he has a grand time as he tosses Daredevil into the water for having a shitty attitude.
“Are you serious right now? You put me in the hospital. I’m not going to be chummy with a person who does that.”
The needle slides in without resistance into Tony’s neck, his face slackening as his eyes take on a sheen of wetness, their depths darkening as the pupils distend and the irises shrink. Tony doesn’t topple, but his limbs fall off the sides of the chair, his head lolling back as he looks at Steve.
Steve had always been too sickly for heats and those sorts of things. It had protected him from having to marry, though omega males were not always expected to. Half the reason he thought Erskine took him was because he didn’t have heats or an alpha to bother them while they worked to make him better.
“I would never let them use you, or hurt you. Didn’t I say you were mine?” Steve looked down, blue eyes possessive and encompassing, pulling Tony in. It made him feel that maybe, just maybe, this could work.
Tony thinks it’s nothing less than soulmates. To believe otherwise is to court the idea that there’s no good place in this world for them. No use for their state of being besides being jaeger pilots. And if that’s all they are, Tony isn’t sure he wants to exist like that.
“The sad thing is, Steve, if you had asked Tony to change to an Omega for you, he would have. He’s always loved you,” she says softly.
He whites out in a haze of feeling, the tidal wave of it crashing over him, burying him deep into his pleasure. He collapses over Tony, cold sweat prickling at his skin and sliding his chest across Tony’s back.
“How generous of you,” Tony says. “So, when are we on the field next?”
“What I want is for you to make. Me.”
“Bucky,” Steve snaps. “Knock it off. It’s not your time and he’s not your toy. Or have you told him how you’re the kind of alpha who leaves an omega right after he’s had his way? Tony doesn’t want that. He deserves commitment, and all you offer is debasement.”
He wanted Steve to touch him, to fill him up.
“Boys,” Natasha says, and Tony pulls away to see her tapping her food expectantly, ears twitching as they usually are.
“I want to slake myself in you. I want to drown. I want to carve you out and put myself there,” Steve whispers into the crook of Tony’s neck as he skates his lips along the unbearably sensitive skin there. His hand plays with the plug in Tony’s ass, pushing it in and out, a wicked grin lighting up his face as he pulls it out from Tony.
Together, they’re everything.
“Of course.” He almost regrets the words as soon as he says them. Does he really want to know?
Even as an alpha, he’d had fantasies.
“Oh no. He owed me a favor. You know the one.” Tony grins conspiratorially at her. His body is vibrating and he’s so close to Nat that Steve wants to step in between them.
When Steve returns, Tony will be in heat. He’ll want and need Steve. He goes to his room, sits on the edge of the bed, and keeps his phone on ring, looking at the screen for what feels like every other second.
“It felt too good, the changes, to stop them. Did I make the wrong decision Steve?” His Tony is open and vulnerable as he looks at Steve. What’s unspoken is heavy in the air between them: Steve’s hand in Tony’s transition.
“Well, he’s not taking care of himself! You can’t just eat out all the time.”
“Fine, we’ll compromise. You can spend your time in the lab, but you will come up for lunch, and if you vomit again, you’ll go to your room.”
“Thirteen thousand Shi’ar credits.”
“Thank you,” he rasps.
“Steve!” He gasps as Steve breaches him, pulling out of his shallow thrust before pressing back in. His tempo is off, but starts to steady into languorous fucking. Steve fucks him deep and hard, his balls and thighs against Tony’s. He fucks Tony until he’s moved inches up on the bed from the power of it. And then he fucks harder, hips pistoning into Tony, Steve’s hands upon his bare hips as he laves at Tony’s neck.
“Within the week.”
Bucky growls and pulls Tony tighter to him.
In all the times he’d known Steve, he’d dreamed of this, but he never in his wildest imaginings thought that Steve wanted the same, or that he’d go through with it. And because he can never keep quiet, he opens his mouth to taunt Steve.
“Mm? Rhodey-bear. Hey–”
He starts to feel nauseous, his body rejecting the food he’s just eaten. Rejecting reality.
“I think it’s almost time. Come to the nest with me?” Tony asks him like Steve is going to say no. He could never say no to Tony.
it. Wants to see his fair skin go pink while Steve’s widened eyes get bluer. Tony’s not sure what’s gotten into him, but no Alpha’s throat ever looked so good to bite down on.
“I need decaf.” Tony’s composure breaks at this, and he looks apoplectic for a second before it smooths over into his usual smug expression.
. He needs Steve. The realization sends him spinning because while he knows he’s always had a crush, this isn’t like that. It’s a desire that feels like his brain is manacled to it, pulling him to grab Steve into his arms and press as close as he can get. To try and get under his skin and make a home there.
Steve tries not to listen in, but with his hearing, he can’t really help it.
Yes, Steve has just given him a massage, but he’s sore from it now, and Bucky’s soft rubbing feels like aftercare.
him. For all he knows, Tony could be, because the sweet, slow drag of it, the way every inch of him is sensitized, attuned to Tony, overwhelms him even more. He’s raw, alive, as Tony pulls up and slides back down. Up again, and an excruciating glide down to his base. He can’t last like this. He’s not sure he needs to.
“But is it normal for him to go into a coma?” Natasha is exuding quiet nervousness, and Steve recognizes the fine-tuned control she must have to keep her pain off her face.
Okay, he can admit he wants Tony. But he won’t take advantage of him or otherwise let the omega know any more than he already thinks he does. Steve has a sinking feeling that Tony’s keen powers of observation are in play here, and that he knows Steve’s sick mind as well as Steve does. God, Tony offered to
“Let me make this clear. The more you disobey, the more privileges you lose. I will find the things you like, and I will take them away. I will find what you love, and it will belong to me. You will come to me for everything you need, including discipline. And while you may never learn to like it, you will learn to appreciate what I give you, as your alpha.”
A $150 budget for clothing was no better than what David had done to stop Angela from living the life she wanted. Her job was respectable, like Tony’s.
“Come on Steve. Come on baby.” Tony dives in, the sting from his cock in Steve’s ass a background sensation to Tony’s pleas. Steve can’t give in. If he does, he feels as though there might be nothing left.
“No sweetheart, she shouldn’t have.” Tony’s hair is mussed like he’s flown the suit without a face mask, and it’s endearing as it is attractive. It’s quiet but for the distant roar of the fires billowing out the broken windows, and Steve feels like the world is being reborn right in front of them.
“Not in the kitchen,” Nat barks. Tony’s wings are shocked and they extend, flying up to hit the ceiling in a giant plume.
. We don’t even know if the antibodies work on the fully infected.” Bruce was working quickly, tubes detangled and needles jammed into Steve’s arms at an uncomfortable angle.
“There, just click that, and then type the last name. Now click this,” she points, “And type the first name. And lastly right here, the omega’s original surname.”
It doesn’t stop Tony from envisioning the very moment, so long ago, that he realized Sunset wasn’t going to let him go.
“Steve—ah—gonna, I’m gonna come on your cock, please— please,
“No, you went headlong without thinking about the consequences for him! For this team! Do you realize that his company won’t allow an Omega to lead it? That Tony could–” Steve cuts Nat off.
Steve carefully picks up his uniform and slides it back on. He knows he’s a liar, but he hates being reminded. Tony knows that too. Tony knows everything.
on Steve, his body twitching and jerking, Tony’s cock spurting and drooling come.
A sudden chill takes Tony. There’s a small, infinitesimal piece of him that doesn’t believe it. That whispers that Steve isn’t coming back. That maybe he’s hearing things like they’re always saying he is. No one has ever tested their bond. No one has ever believed them.
When the day arrives, Tony showers and puts on some loose fitting clothes. He usually shows up in style to this sort of thing. But no, SHIELD, Pepper, and even Rhodey suggested he park a Subaru just out of town and have Happy take him there, whilst shaking the paparazzi.
The suppressants help keep him stable, but without them, his eyes blur with emotion, and the tight little feeling behind his nose makes his eyes wet. He tries to catch it, but the tears slip past his fingers.
“Oh, that looks good. You getting tired of providing for me yet?”
“I’m Steve. Steve Rogers.”
It takes Tony too long to compose himself before Bucky slips out of the kitchen, leaving Tony with a desperate hard-on along with so much confusion.
In the morning sun, Steve is glowing. Today is going to be a good day. And who knows, perhaps they’ll run into Ezekial Stane.
“No, but—”
“Ok.” Tony drags the plate across the counter closer to him before picking it up. He swipes his finger through the mashed potatoes before licking it and peers at Steve cautiously. “It’s good.”
“I don’t think I’ll get the chance. He wants nothing to do with me right now.”
“I put some ice in it, just to make sure it cools down. It’s not too full either.”
He does not like what he finds anymore than he did at first glance. There’s so much media showing Tony in compromising positions, so much gossip, and speculation. If even half of it is true, Tony is completely feral. Steve knows this is what happens when you let an omega have their way. They get into trouble. They get taken advantage of.
If it was only Tony, he might have been able to walk away. But a rut is as dangerous to an Alpha’s mind as not going into heat is to an Omega’s body. Without suppressants, or an Omega, an Alpha could get easily locked into a feral state.
“With the serum…” Steve trailed off, and Tony whined in despair.
“And you need to leave religion out of it and focus on the problem, Mr. Stark.” What Tony wouldn’t give to take that Catholic guilt and stick it where the sun don’t shine.
Tony looks up and his expression is hopeful, the kind of sweetness that closes a hand around Steve’s heart and squeezes, and as Steve repeats his endearments, Tony melts onto him, laying flat across Steve’s chest and tucking his head underneath Steve’s chin. The new position tugs gently at his knot, but it feels so, so good as it pulsates inside Tony.
“Meeting my husband for lunch. Maybe some other time.” Tony needed to get away from here.
It’s not enough to slow the pace of the fight, and they each dive head-on at the other, their trajectory taking them up into the air. Tony slides the man into a mountain, breaking off bits of rubble and scraping at his own suit while Mr. Muscles struggles and punches at him as if he can’t feel a damn thing from being dragged across solid stone.
