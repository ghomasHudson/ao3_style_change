"...What?"
"Why?"
But there wasn't much speculation about Peter. There were a few articles wishing for the innocent kid's wellbeing, but not much else.
"By facial recognition one is a Vanessa Williams, the other is hard to identify. He is covered in scar tissue."
"I do. And I don't like that you're limited. You are limiting yourself. You don't have to."
"Thanks...for bringing her here. Ness...she's usually the only one who can calm her back down."
Wade shook his head. "You've gotta be kidding me."
"Like pop up ads?"
"No hard feelings, kid?" Clint asked.
"You alright, Peter?"
Attached was a picture of Peter's suit. Gray and burgundy, as he and Ned had decided. One with a black tie, one with a white tie, one with a grey tie, and one was tie-less, two buttons undone.
Maggie was on the floor in the corner, her head hidden against her knees. She was curled into a tiny ball, her arms over her head as if to protect it. Strange flicked on the lights. The room was empty.
Beck sighed. "This is delicate. He's a teenage boy, a genius, and a nerd. He's naïve, not stupid."
He knew that look on her face. He'd seen it on his own when he'd finally found Tony and Steve. She'd found her home, her place to be, whether or not she knew it. He'd been without a home for only a couple months and being with Tony and Steve felt...like he belonged there. Like he was meant to be there. It didn't diminish his parents or his aunt or uncle. He loved them all, missed them all. But it didn't make Tony and Steve any less 'home' either. He had a feeling, even if May and Ben were alive, and he'd somehow managed to get the internship... Tony would have still ended up Dad. Steve would have still ended up Papa. Peter would just also have Aunt May and Uncle Ben. They were all family. Patchworked together in Peter's heart.
"Low income housing and the like." Peter answered. "It'll be easier for people who need it to afford what they really need if they can save the money from their usual utility bills."
The stage went black. Light piano music began to play and the lights came up. Peter and Maggie began to dance together, not quite ballet, more freeform a little less professional. It was a slow, comfortable dace. They looked like they'd been dancing for years. Then, that's when Tony noticed the details. Green. Maggie was wearing green and glasses. Tony'd never met Peter's Aunt May, but Peter had told him her favorite color was green and Tony was pretty sure Maggie was wearing glasses very similar to the ones May wore in the photo next to Peter's bed.
"I can fight." Tony protested. "I've sparred with you guys before. I'm good."
"I died...a couple million times...I lost count after a while." His jaw clenched for a moment, then relaxed.
Peter's stubs ached. It was raining outside. And when it rained, the ends of the fingers Beck had cut off always hurt. An ache that annoyed more than anything else. He rubbed them. He didn't want the prosthetics on. They hurt more during storms and taking off the prosthetics made them feel better. Peter settled for rubbing them.
"Thanks. We're doing a review of Hamlet and Animal Farm. Those should be what the last test is over. Hopefully I'll nail the test."
"Yeah, you can have it." She promised.
"Awesome." Ned grinned.
"Then we'll try to find a way to keep you from going there." Strange said.
"I can find her, give me a moment." Steve moved his hands, mimicking the spell he'd put on her necklace. His eyes opened wide. "I need images of the docks at these coordinates." He rattled off the numbers and, instantly, JARVIS gave Strange the images he needed. "Got it." He opened a portal and stepped through. Tony and Steve followed him.
Ness narrowed her eyes. "Looks like it."
It was Peter.
"What?" Tony asked, his eyes red-rimmed from crying, his jaw set as he looked through another set of cameras.
Strange closed Harry Potter and took her hand gently. "It was pretty bad, but we've done lots of tests. You're going to heal alright. It's going to take some time though. It's going to be a bit scary. I'll walk you through it, I'll be here. You'll be okay." He couldn't promise that last bit of course. Physically though, she'd heal. Any impact on her mind though...that was less predictable. Would her moods be different? Her ability to focus? Her mobility? All that was at stake, given where her head had been bashed in. It would be jumbled for a while, but with time she'd heal and once the healing was done they'd have a better idea of what they'd have to deal with. Her trouble speaking was normal, he expected that to linger for a while. And he expected her memories to be a bit hazy.
Vanessa laughed. 'Solitary confinement. Or if you want to be more cruel, embarrassment.'
"Okay." Strange answered, drawing out medicine and frowned. "You burn through meds pretty quick, Peter. Even ones made for you." He put the needle in the IV and slowly began to push it. "Let me know if you feel pain. Right now...you should be getting pretty quick relief, but if you ever feel pain, you need to let me know."
"Huh? Why?"
"I'm sorta adopted too, you know?" Maggie sighed. "My dad was an officer, he was killed in the line of duty. My mom...she was murdered. I grew up abused and then a certain merc found me. He may have saved my life and eviscerated the guy who hurt me. I thought I'd never be happy again without my family, but here I am...living with my found family. It doesn't make the pain or loss any easier, but Wade and Vanessa and--well they are my family now. And yeah we're weird. But we're family. I know what this dance is and what it means to you. They deserve to see it, so that's why I wanted to help."
His Papa stepped up and put his hand on the Iron Man suit. "Go, get out of here. There are already enough cameras. Go, Tony, please. We'll handle it. Take our kid home, make sure he's okay. We'll take Stane in. I promise he won't hurt anyone else."
"Make sure he gets out." The older boy gagged on the air.
Maybe he could go there.
A young woman took the stage. Auburn hair and gloves, and oddly a watch. Tony knew her vaguely as the young woman who'd stepped up to be Peter's partner when Lizzy hurt her leg. He was excited to see if she was as good a dancer as Peter bragged her up to be.
"Hey, Captain Fine-Ass." Tony breezed into the room, patting the mentioned ass as he walked by. "Hello, Roo."
Here you go. Hope everyone's doing well. My brain's being mean at the moment, but I'm still trucking along. Hopefully the updating won't be slowed too much.
"My aunt and uncle were weird too at first...when I lost my parents. They never felt like parents to me either, even with rules and boundaries. But Tony and Steve...it felt different. It didn't mean anyone was lesser or bad...it's just that they naturally met the role better." Peter frowned. "You ever tell Strange that he...helps?"
"Traitor."
"LALALALALA!" Peter plugged his ears and ran to the elevator. "JARVIS, please save me."
"They do too much for me already. I'm just some orphan off the street. They do enough."
"The evidence against Stane will be explanation enough. Let's get him, Tony."
"Okay. As long as she's alright. She just seemed a bit...cagey."
"NO!"
He just...couldn't do it.
His care for Peter would be that weakness. And, thanks to a clever friend. If Steve Rogers happened to intervene, they had a tranq good enough to keep him down. It'd be easy enough. Really.
"Meet you up there, when you're ready."
Peter put his plate in the sink and gingerly walked up to Tony. "Are you feeling alright?" He expected Tony's face to harden, for him to be angry, but his face softened instead.
"I don't like doing this in silence. Could you turn on some music?" He asked, his eyes not straying at all from the task.
"You're doing great though." Cho said. "I'm surprised you haven't managed to reinjure anything."
"Brown hair. 'all. Beard neat." Maggie said, raising her voice.
"You complained less when you were stabbed then you do when I change bandages."
"Go ahead, kid."
She saw Strange and wanted to yell at him. Tell him to turn. That the real danger was behind him, not in front of him.
Like old times? Had he met fish-bowl guy before?
"Like it? Peter, it was beautiful." Tony whispered.
"Smoosh it down real flat, yeah, Peter, I know." Delmar waved him off. "Getting ready for school again?"
She wasn't there. Neither was Wade or Vanessa.
Enjoy.
The door opened. The man in gold, with a fish-bowl on his head walked in, red cape flowing behind him. "Hello, Peter."
"Again, it's easier when seen performed."
"GOD NO!" Tony shouted. "Anything but that."
He shook himself. "What was that?"
"Your approach doesn't work, Obadiah. You can't just bully him into giving you what you want. The kid won't know the difference, of course, but Stark will. And, I know from my little experiment, that the boy talks to Stark outside of his internship. That means that Stark cares for the kid, for one, and for another, it means that Stark is watching him. So, if we try to force the kid into something, Stark'll notice. But...become friends with him, play the longer game, maybe even make him angry at Stark a little. It doesn't matter. Once the kid trusts me, I'll get what you need out of him. You can have what you want and then I'll get what I want."
Maggie took a deep breath. She didn't mind the smell of incense. It was calming, pleasant. Everything here was serene. Not to hot or cold. The cushion had just enough support. The calming tick of her watch was steady, reassuring. And she could tell Dr. Strange was there, sense his presence. There was nothing else. Dr. Strange had sealed everything away so she couldn't sense danger. It was just her and him, so there was no danger for her to see.
Two baddies and all the plot.
Peter turned his head and looked at the people behind them. There was casual...and then there was too casual. The guy in the ballcap was too casual. He looked like he was trying not to be obvious. And he was holding something in his pocket. He might as well have been singing the 'don't be suspicious' song in his head. Maybe he was. Peter turned back forward.
"Is she okay?"
Maggie nodded. "He invented some sort of power source. Kinda like a mini-arc reactor. He sent me some of the specs. The numbers looked promising. Just hope he does alright during the presentation. I'm not sure I could do that."
Clint seemed to process that for a minute, then sighed. "Okay, fair enough. The guy who half-raised him did send him off to get tortured and murdered. I understand. I forget how much people use the poor guy... Right, well, next time we've got his back. Make sure he knows that."
"Is she okay?" Tony asked when Peter came back to the lab.
School Sucks - Peter Stark-Rogers Addition
Maggie spluttered, pink coloring her cheeks.
"I feel like I'm out of place." Peter admitted tugging on his suit.
Peter took a couple moments to breathe, then looked around. Doctor Strange was picking up medical equipment, grabbing new ones. Vanessa was there too. Why were they there? Peter's eyes turned to the left and he saw Maggie in an inclined hospital bed next to him. Her head bandaged, her thumbs were wrapped up, her fingers weren't, but there were scraps on them and her nails looked broken. Angry bruises lined her neck.
"Thanks."
"Same." Tony said.
On the other hand it was scary. It meant that she somehow...did work. It meant that her body wasn't broken. It meant that she could be vulnerable and...like things like sex. That was scary. And it was Peter. Her friend. Would he hate her if he knew she'd felt this...flutter of arousal? He'd never expressed anything more than friendship. Had she done something awful by feeling like that? Had her feelings...violated him? She flinched. She hadn't right? She hadn't even known what she felt at the time or why... She'd never felt that before. Hell, she couldn't even really tell if people were cute or not...not until long after she knew them well. It...it didn't make sense.
Peter relaxed and went to sleep.
"That's low, Peter." Happy said, raising an eyebrow in the rearview mirror. "But I surrender."
"How we feeling?" Dr. Strange asked and stood next to her bed.
Maggie could see the lights through the walls, the lights hurt, but she had to watch. People were moving. It...almost looked like they were packing. Had they been found out? They were moving somewhere. Did they find Peter? Her chest squeezed tight. She hoped not. She didn't tell them. She wouldn't. But...if they were moving, leaving. Why hadn't they tried to move her?
"She texted me and asked me last night if I'd dance with you. Something about you being too shy or polite to ask yourself."
"Help me?" Peter asked with wide eyes.
"Not badly, I'm pretty lucky." She gripped her staff tighter.
She looked confused. Another tear ran down her face as she seemed to focus. "Is i'...Harry Po'er?"
He didn't need to say it. Peter caught the notepad Tony threw at him with ease.
"Me too. It's bad enough one kid is out there running around in underroos."
"That's definitely unfair." Tony sighed, but took a sip of the tea. "Okay, one hour."
"Don't mention it." Strange shrugged. "Okay, you're good. Shirt on, last but not least, the leg. Has it been bothering you?"
"Of course."
"I just don't want to bother him." She whispered.
The door opened. Tony stepped in. "Kid, I heard you were in the med-bay... Oh, hi. Who's this and why are you...unmasked, Spiderman?"
"Strange..." Christine asked, her voice sounding concerned.
"Let's get inside, it's a bit chilly up here."
Peter blinked, then nodded. "Okay. Drop the needle, J."
Maggie's eyes watered.
"It's okay." Tony kissed his temple. "We're all a little haywire right now. But we're a team, we're going to make this work. Okay?"
"I'm not leaving school. There isn't much left, anyway. I'm not going to just hide. It's the same risk no matter what, I might as well go to school." Peter protested. As much as Stane made him uneasy, Peter wasn't going to give up his life over it. He just got his life back.
Steve looked at the sweater and shook his head. Tony'd been looking for his MIT sweater and...of course, it was in one of Peter's 'nests' as Steve liked to call them. He was glad the kid was getting more comfortable in the house, but it was a little weird to find stuff crammed in weird places. Steve found his build-a-bear Captain America plushie (given to him by Tony) up on top of the fridge because Peter used it as a pillow. Really, it was harmless. The kid slept in weird places and, as JARVIS had pointed out, slept walk. Peter'd go to sleep in his room and sometimes wake up on the living room ceiling. Steve found it endearing. He'd also found some of his and Tony's things going missing a few months after adopting the kid. Steve didn't know if Peter realized he'd taken them or if he'd just took them while he slept. It was kinda cute...but strange, finding stuff all over the penthouse.
Peter crept into an apartment window and stole clothes from a dresser, a pair of sweats and a t-shirt. He felt bad, but he couldn't keep wearing his clothes, they were covered in blood and grime. The bullet wound had stopped bleeding, but he couldn't keep wearing these clothes, someone would take notice. He made a mental note of the address as best as his traumatized mind could. He would pay them back. He left the apartment and tossed his clothes down the garbage shoot. Then he found another window and climbed out.
"I'll work on catching him up." Peter promised. "Speaking of." Peter said, nudging his papa with his elbow.
"We've all got each other. Speaking of, where's Papa?" Peter asked, finding leftovers in the fridge and reheating them.
"Yeah." Peter hoped she could tell he was grinning at her.
"Or I could just be in the crowd so ya'll can quite fighting over it." Peter laughed.
She reached up blindly to flush the toilet.
Dr. Strange gestured down a hall and she walked a step behind him. He never tried to reach out for her, but the cloak occasionally stretched out and brushed her gloved hand in a friendly way. She liked that cloak. "What do you think I can do about it?"
"So seriously tell me. You see him every weekend."
"And you two. You're going to have rules too."
Peter nodded.
"Got a problem with the skyline, kid?"
"I think you're adorable, Roo." Tony ruffled his hair. "I ran the tests on that new fabric. You missed out on the Edna Mode test run and everything. Totally passed the stress tests."
"Okay." Peter grinned and headed for the cabin. He glanced back at Tony and Steve. The two were leaning against each other, supportive. Yeah, they'd be okay.
Did Peter know that voice? He'd heard it in the lab before.
"Okay." Peter nodded.
Peter shrugged. "Years of dance. You learn to both lead and follow. I know both now like second nature."
"Dr. Stephen Strange, I have a few concerns about the way this school is run."
Peter took in the knowledge. He knew what she meant. He'd worked with Reset a few times now. She was very open with him about her abilities. She could speed up and slow down time around people pretty much consistently. She could always sense danger. She could only jump backwards in time once a day. She said she could only jump back twelve minutes at max, she'd done it twice in one day, once, but had passed out in the effort. Doing so tired her, but not so much that she couldn't function. Flying drained her too. Not physically. But if she used too much of her powers at once, it would exhaust her to the point where she wouldn't be able to get away safely if things went south. He didn't want her to run that low on strength. If she was getting too tired to fly, that wasn't good. She did good, quietly explaining her vulnerability without letting the baddie know.
Peter buried his head against his knees and sobbed, listening to his dad's voice and waiting.
Clint pointed down. "You can see in the dirt and grime. Imprints. Someone was laying here. Someone small by the looks of it. A kid...they were dragged to the middle there." There were drag marks leading to the center of the alley.
"Shut up, Flash." Peter rolled his eyes.
"See, I studied you. All your powers are defensive. Really, you're kind of useless. I mean...good team player, but on your own...well...you're so vulnerable." He ruffled her hair.
Peter scoffed and shook his head. "NOW you want to talk?" His jaw tightened and he looked like he wanted to say something, but then he didn't. Instead he turned. "You know what? I don't want to have this argument. I don't need this lecture, not from YOU. I'm going to go to bed."
Vanessa looked down at her phone and shook her head. "No. I'll try again." She wiped her face and stepped out of the room.
"Yes, sir." Wade answered.
Strange felt furious. He'd remembered from Maggie's earlier vision. She'd been afraid of the man with her, insistent that he'd hurt her sexually. "We...did not check on that." He'd been more worried about bone fragments in her brain. He hadn't even considered... "Was there any..." He swallowed hard. "Any evidence in the videos or photos?"
"They got the hands wrong." Maggie said.
Maggie was silent for a moment. "That...doesn't feel right. Alright though. I'm glad everything's cool."
"I think I can do it." Peter bobbed his head. "Are you sure I look okay?"
"I got him. You just...reboot or whatever." Maggie stood near the suit, hoping maybe she could protect it from a potential blast if something happened. Her eyes looked up.
"Oh, please don't. My heart can't take it." Peter said tears in his eyes as... Yup. She stopped on her right foot, then did the 'bring it around town'. "If you weren't already grounded, you'd be grounded again. That was ridiculous."
Ned sighed when his phone went off. He'd move the delicate part of the Hogwarts Castle gently to his desk from the floor, then he grabbed his phone and looked at his texts. A group text.
(See the end of the chapter for
Peter screamed and try to back away. His hands were bound. He yanked on them, hard, but the cuffs didn't budge.
"Did you just dance Swan Lake in tennis shoes?!"
She nodded her head. "Even something as stupid as someone getting a papercut...I sort of get that feeling, that visual. It was a lot when I first started adjusting."
Peter flipped them off.
She rolled with the hit and threw a taser disk.
Vanessa nodded and leaned forward, gently stroking Maggie's arm. "Hey, my girl. You wanna wake up?"
"That's okay. People are frightening. You did good though." Tony kissed his forehead. "Okay. You are free to go mingle. Lots of cool projects out there to explore. You probably know some of the people presenting. They'd be happy to see a friendly face. I gotta go schmooze the press. Steve, Happy, and Rhodey are all here if you want a break from anything. Pepper's here too...but she's...occupied today. Lots of press on her recently, so stick to the others if possible. If you ever need to escape or anything Happy's ready to get you out at any time. Also, I made sure there was no mint in any of the food, so eat to your heart's content, okay?"
"What?"
"Gray. Gray all the way." Ned said. "Now we got to figure out which color."
"Unless Mads is an inter-dimensional being with the ability to replicate himself, I'm pretty sure you're safe."
"Yay!" She grinned. She flung her arms around him in a happy hug, then pulled back, pulling her gloves off without a second thought. She turned and waved to Peter. "See ya, thanks for the lift."
"It's actually funny and adorable."
Peter sighed. While he got annoyed at how strict Happy could be about some things...it really was because he cared. "Okay."
I almost called this chapter Irony. Then I considered Best Boi. I'm a little scatter brained.
Peter nodded and turned his head toward his papa and dad. "You won't leave me, right?"
"This is the girl you spoke of. Lovely to meet you, Margaret."
Yeah. It's almost out. You in Brooklyn?
"Almost done." Helen soothed. "Just a couple more. Do you need a break?"
"You're grinding your teeth, you're not okay." Strange rolled his eyes. "Come on."
"You do pretty good already." Maggie shrugged. "I don't like being treated like glass. It makes me feel broken. I'm not broken. Most people don't know what I've been through. Seven, actually." Wade, Vanessa, Charles, Strange, Peter, Tony, and Steve. "And only four of those people know details or even my original name." Wade, Charles, Strange, and presumably Tony, given his access to the internet. "I don't tell people. Usually they find out. But I don't want their pity. I don't want anyone to tiptoe around anything. If I need something, I ask for it. Steve Rogers looks like him...looks like him at first glance. He tries to wear a hat when I'm around. He talks so I hear his voice before I see him." Maggie looked down. "I don't want special treatment or people to be afraid to tell jokes or whatever. Just respect. You already do that. You knock before you open doors. You ask questions. You give me space. If I'm hurt you give me options. You didn't tell me I needed a shower last night, you just told me where the bathroom was and said if I needed bandages changed, you'd help. That's all I need. Don't tiptoe. It doesn't help. If you say something I don't like, I'll tell you. Or I'll freak out and that'll be pretty self-explanatory."
"Peter?!" Tony snapped. But the kid was already slamming his bedroom door.
"Something wrong?"
Dr. Strange taped down the gauze. "You're good, Margaret." Strange's hands trembled as he let her go. He put on his sling ring and opened a portal.
"Yup."
"Papa?"
Steve put his phone in his pocket and walked forward. "I got a list for you, but it's shorter than normal. Is it okay?"
"Okay."
"Wanna try to find something?" Peter asked.
"Of course." Tony grinned. "Any time you need a hand, consider us a resource. I know you have your own resources."
"Yeah. I pull a Joker on people and always tell a different story. Leaves them wondering."
Peter watched as his dad was taken away. Tony looked bruised up and a little scratched here and there. But he didn't look too bad.
"Wade and Vanessa have carpet on their floors."
"Thanks." She said and stood up. The he saw how her head twisted. His ears caught a shout in the same direction.
Maggie screamed.
"You're right." Maggie flew forward. She closed her eyes, took a deep breath and raised her hands slowly. Green light glowed at her gloved fingertips. The building glowed green as she held her right hand up, slowly twisting it counter-clockwise. The cracks and broken pieces of the building leapt back up, slowly going back together. The damage being undone.
"Me too." Steve agreed. "Clint, you need to head to the tower. That looks like it needs stitches." He nodded down to his leg.
"Everything set up?"
"I'm not an idiot, Peter. Plus, I live with an anti-hero who says and I quote 'I've read this story before' and he fawns over Iron Man. You're dad fights bad guys. Wade gets paid to kill worse guys. I'm not even remotely capable of judging. I mean, have you met Wade?" She laughed. "I'm pretty sure your dad isn't the villain he wants everyone to think he is." She stood with a stretch. "I'm not telling anyone, by the way. I'm pretty damn good at keeping secrets. I have to be, because Wade never shuts the hell up and I think he's always a page ahead of everyone else." She smiled.
Peter's face grew hot. "Wh-what? She's not my girlfriend. She's a friend."
Tony made a 'come here' gesture. Peter slid closer to Tony and Tony wrapped his arm around him, holding tight. "I love you, kid. Don't listen to a damn thing that fake says to you, got it? It isn't true. I love you and I will always listen to you." Tony promised in a voice that held no lies.
"That's what I'm trying to do." Strange huffed and folded his arms over his chest.
"Thanks, Karen."
"Okay, that I do feel." She frowned as she felt her skin rebel at the pressure.
"You wipe the floor with him, Steve."
Maggie shifted slightly as Vanessa sat her bed most of the way up. Then Peter caught her eyes. She blinked twice. "P-Peter?"
Strange opened his eyes and smiled. "Was I?"
"Deal."
Dr. Strange tilted his head down in response. "Try again?"
Strange raised an eyebrow at Wade. "And the one I dropped off?"
"We're never powerless, Margaret."
"Better." Peter nodded.
"SHIT! How'd you figure me out?" Peter asked.
Maggie hid her face against Strange's chest and shook violently with a sob, maybe in pain, maybe in fear, either way it made Strange's heart seize.
"My smart girl." Vanessa smiled sadly.
(See the end of the chapter for
Peter forced himself up and stood on the edge of the building. "Come to the dark side, Reese, I won't tell. Superhero's promise. Queen's never goes back on its promises. Plus, we have sandwiches. Come to the dark side and we can rid the streets of bike thieves or...I dunno. Something."
"Mr. Stane here was just asking about power output. You've been working on a clean high-output power, Peter, you could totally help. The kid's a genius, sir. We call him Mini-Stark behind his back." Tracy giggled. "His prototype for the contest could power this whole lab for a day and he used dumpster dive tech to do it. And his work just keeps getting better. Mr. Stark thinks Peter here's going to make the next big break in clean energy. Peter's awesome, but we don't usually get to see him. Mr. Stark hogs him for the big-league stuff upstairs."
"I have taken into consideration some of the preferences that you had JARVIS set up. Is this okay?"
"Dad and I got into a fight. He got hurt. He was supposed to be on bedrest. I went to go do my internship and there he was, working. I told him he should be upstairs resting and that Papa would probably be pissed if he found out."
Tony frowned. "I read about this. Sometimes kids test parents, you know, breaking rules, just to see what they'll do. Especially kids in new situations. If I were in his shoes I'd be testing boundaries too. Maybe this is one of those times."
"A gift?"
The reporter put the box down, ran to a garbage can and threw up.
She let out a breath and relaxed. She wasn't worried about him, her own body was the traitor. She felt it tensing and wobbling.
"Well, why don't we try to find something?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Thwip! The wind felt amazing as Peter swung through the city. He heard a shout. Strangely he...felt like he'd heard it before. "Karen, what's happening?"
"He did!" Maggie laughed. "Partying, partying, yeah!" She really liked Wong. He was funny.
"Keeping Hong Kong from burning down..." He responded, rubbing his face. "Where's...?" His eyes widened at the noise in the room. "Margaret? What's that?"
"Pasta?" Tony offered.
(See the end of the chapter for
"She's been off lately. I think she'll be fine though. She'll be better when her...mentor comes back. I think she's worried about him." Peter shrugged. "She'll come around. I get it. It's...nerve-wracking. I mean, if I couldn't get ahold of you or Papa during a fight, I'd be pretty nervous too."
“I can’t!” Tony ran a hand through his hair. Boy did he want this day to be over, the stress of it was starting to make him feel like pulling every piece of hair out of his head. “I can’t, Steve. If I do that then there’ll be mass panic, every single person here will get scared and run like hell, someone could get hurt or worse. We need to do it carefully, get each person out of here safely and calmly if we’re unable to kill the Foniassaurus.”
Steve had to think of something, and quick. He could just about make out her gigantic feet heading towards him, so he gave the underneath of the car a quick scan, hoping to find an item that could hide his smell. Then his eyes landed on the petrol cord. Without a second thought Steve stuffed a hand into the back pocket of his jeans, yanking out a pocket knife that Tony had gotten him a long time ago for, as he’d put it, dinosaur emergencies. He was more than thankful that Tony’s little joke of a gift was possibly about to save his life.
“You can’t!” Steve said hard-heartedly, the room going silent and all eyes turning to listen to the dinosaur expert. “Did you not see what that thing did?”
Luke and Jessica stood there, agitatedly jabbing the code into the lock mechanism to go inside.
Thor had told him Steve was alive. He hadn’t said anything about Jessica and Luke.
technology,” Tony said as a matter of fact. “I know
“Natasha’s in charge of the security team, Schmidt, what she says goes.” Steve felt himself get angrier, the German could have a go at him all he wanted, but he didn’t like it when he brought his friends into it. “You’ll never be in charge of Shield Security whilst she’s around.”
“Their footprints stopped not long back,” Steve said, checking his phone signal again, which was still not working. “Maybe we should have brought the radio to get a hold of Thor.”
“Well,” Wade hummed. “Your uncle seems like a fun guy, Petey.”
“Hey.” Tony said quietly as he joined Steve by the wall. “We’ll kill that thing, no matter what, okay? We’ll do it for our friends.”
That is until Steve said something that caught his attention.
“You’re in charge,” Tony began, waving a hand as Bruce was about to protest. “I’ve put you in charge before Bruce, you do a good job.” he said, as they entered the armoury, Steve going straight to the rifles they’d need. “Get Thor to keep track of the employees and the guests, make sure every single one of them are safely on Main Street and send them straight onto the boats when they arrive. Get Carol and her crew to keep an eye on the Foniassaurus, call us if it’s too close for comfort. And…” Tony sighed, feeling the stress build. “If you can find Peter on there that would a damn good help, send me his location.”
“Steve?” he breathed out, voice shaky. “P-please tell me he’s… he’s alright.”
“Stark,” the man called in his deep voice. “Your ride’s waiting.”
“Do not enter, staff only.” Wade read as he strolled up to his boyfriend. “Sounds like an invitation, let’s go inside.”
Clint looked over at Steve who came bolting to his side. “He fell in the fucking enclosure!” the other man said angrily. “Pig got loose.”
“Stark.” Natasha said as a greeting.
“Peter!”
get down there?”
Peter rolled his eyes, swinging his bag onto his shoulder. “Red, okay? Just take the red!”
“Boss Tony!”
“It’s an ankylosaurs!” Peter grinned, watching as the gigantic creature wrenched a large chunk of grass into its mouth.
“TONY!... HELP!... WE… DON… TON… DINOSA-“
“I wish it was,” Carol said. “Schmidt has taken over Shield Security.”
“What do you think, Rogers?”
In a split second Natasha was on her feet, yanking the gun up and pointing it straight at the Foniassaurus who stood right behind her. Before the dinosaur could even get its jaws open, Natasha had pulled the trigger. She cried out in anger, Matt’s face fixed in her mind as she set off bullet after bullet, hitting the dinosaur square in its chest as it gave out an exasperated growl. The shots didn’t even seem to be making a scratch on the creature’s skin, the being roaring in anger not pain.
Steve heard Thor take a deep breath on the other side of the phone, barely audible through the loud, aggressive sound of the engine of the jeep, the snapping of branches and tyres on stony ground. He couldn’t imagine what Thor was trying to sort out as it was, so he felt a tad guilty bringing him some more bad news.
“How goes my brother?” Thor asked, taking a loud sip of his energy drink.
Peter chuckled quietly, taking a peek over at Loki to make sure he wasn’t looking. “Deal.”
“Nothing’s going to jump out and eat us, right?” Wade whispered, as if someone were listening in on them. “What if this is the big, creepy dinosaur’s layout and he’s here waiting for us?” he said, looking around frantically.
Tony nodded back, watching as Steve tucked his rifle safely behind the seat, and smiled knowingly at Peter and Wade who were still in an embrace. Tony, without even thinking, reached his arm over the seat, putting his hand on Steve’s shoulder.
“Turn it off.”
Tony gave him a punch on the arm before throwing his riffle in the back seat. “You ain’t driving, you’re shit. Move to the back.”
“Checked for what?” Tony frowned, he knew the plans had been tested over a few times since they’d started building it, everything had seemed fine from the get go.
Everyone froze. From somewhere nearby a tree fell to the ground, followed by branches snapping, leaves rustling. There soon came a resounding bang once more, one after the other, trembling the ground underneath their feet like an earthquake. They didn’t need to see what it was, they knew exactly what it was, and they weren’t going to wait around to find out.
“We got a map!”
Wade clapped his hands together and howled loudly. Passengers turned to look at him, Peter hid his face behind his hands whilst Wade gave them all a little wave and a big grin.
sorry for the late updates guys! I've been busy with work and going here and there (including to see infinity war... anyone else want to throw a punch at Thanos?)
“One!” Peter let out, as the two took off running.
“Hi, how’s it going?” he asked the couple in front. “If you could get eaten by a dinosaur which one would it be?”
Peter laughed as they ran over a bridge. “Tony’s going to kill us for running away from him, Wade!”
“We will.” Tony said confidently, looking Steve straight in the eyes. “We’ll not give up until that thing is dead, there’s no way I’m letting it get away with killing our friends, no way.”
“Jess!” Steve bellowed at the screaming woman, trying desperately to get her to look at him. “We have to run, now!”
“Wade, shut up!” Peter warned, as he strolled towards him, keeping an eye on the Ankylosaurs. “I swear to God if we get trampled on because of your stupid idea I’m going to kill you!”
“Uh, Wade?”
“I never said you were a terrible boyfriend.” Steve confirmed. “I would never say that.”
“We have to do this, Steve.” Natasha spoke up first. “We have no choice.”
The group laughed. “Not yet anyway.” Said Scott.
“It’s just outside the Omnivore’s terrain.” Steve whispered beside the engineer. “Tony, one of the emergency exit gates has been opened, she’s gotten through the electric fence!”
“You too, Hawkeye!” Steve grinned at his friend.
“Nice hat.” Tony said, sounding highly sarcastic.
“Yeah,” Tony fiddled with his phone in his hand, not knowing what to say in such a situation. He’d never lost a friend before, let alone two. “I uh… I’m sorry, Matt.”
All of a sudden there were resounding gunshots echoing around the woods, hitting their target, some bouncing off tree trunks, some splitting the leaves. The Foniassaurus gave out a thunderous roar, dropping Matt’s lifeless body onto the sloppy ground, before she took giant steps straight towards the soldiers.
“What if it’s a him?” Wade asked as he stuck his head over the top of the jeep.
“Wow!” Wade stared up at the gigantic hologram of a longneck. “I wonder how long it would take to knit him a scarf.”
“We have to get those people off this island.” Steve added, regarding Tony in all seriousness. The engineer looking like he was about to rip his hair out in annoyance.
“What?” he feigned innocence. “Just asking.”
Steve looked down at his hands, practically whispering his next words. “Your work always comes before anyone, Tony. Not just me.”
“Yeah, there used to be two.”
Tony sent him a small smile. “Yeah, I know.” He turned to Thor whose typing had come to a halt. “Turn them up to their highest level, Thor.”
we find her and kill her.”
Tony was so surprised at first he didn’t know what to do, but the feeling of having Steve’s lips on his again had him shut his eyes and take it all in. He pulled the younger man closer in his arms, and poured as much love as he could into the kiss, showing him just how much he meant what he said.
Tony felt his stomach drop. He suddenly felt awfully sick, his heart was virtually beating out of his chest by now. How the hell did the dinosaur make those marks? It must have tricked them, but, could dinosaurs be that smart? She made them think it had escaped, when in reality she was still inside. And then it hit him. Luke and Jessica were going inside.
“You love Stark Industries.” Bruce said with a knowing smile.
Tony’s face turned as white as a sheet of paper in that instant, Steve holding his breath, as ear-piercing screams blared from the phone.
*****
Tony frowned. “Touché.” he mumbled, slinging his rifle over his shoulder. “So, if they jumped, where the hell would they go to down there? That’s the old part of the island. It’s literally split in half by this damn river.”
“A long neck,” he said, feeling another shake from the earth. “You know, the one’s you said could make a pretty bow with their necks.”
“There’s no way the trackers off,” Natasha piped in. “Those things are brand new, they’ve not once been wrong.”
“So what?”
Tony sighed, running a hand through his hair. He shared a look with Bruce who gave him a nod, obviously agreeing with everything Steve had just said.
And lo and behold, his phone began to ring. Loki picked it out of his pocket and read his brother’s name on the screen, rolling his eyes at the thought of him.
Wade visibly flinched. Peter chuckled to himself as he pulled out their flight tickets from his pocket, giving Aunt May one last smile. “Well, we’d better go, their announcing our flight.”
Tony hurriedly followed, trying his best to keep up. They could hear the engine more and more the further they ran in a straight path, it’s sputtering and droning echoing around them. It didn’t take long for the two to reach a building they both hadn’t seen in such a long time, the old information centre that had been the first on the island, its front door slightly ajar.
Bruce swallowed the lump in his throat, and just went for it. “There’s uh… there’s snake DNA in her, which explains her large jaw… uh… cuttlefish… she had cuttlefish DNA…”
Wade snorted. “These are all veggie dinos remember?” he poked the side of Peter’s head. “They wouldn’t let us go anywhere near those steak loving big boys, you said it yourself.
Peter didn’t say it out loud, but damn, he was impressed. “Well done.” Was all he could say, as Wade chirpily swung the map around in his hand as he got into the driver’s side of the jeep.
“I’d say a T-rex is pretty big, wouldn’t you?”
“Front seat, Wilson.” She said calmly as she got into the driver’s seat.
“Where is it?” one soldier murmured down the coms in apprehension.
“Yes, sir!” Charles said without thought, and was quickly getting the job done.
“Flashy entrance?” Tony chuckled, patting Bruce on the shoulder. “Not like you, Brucey.”
Steve shouted, practically begging by now. “
Tony could see the clogs turning in Steve’s head as he tried to work out how exactly the genes of a tree frog fit into the Foniassaurus’s DNA. The blonde wasn’t too familiar with the cold-blooded animal, but he had an inkling of some of its traits. He put the puzzle pieces together within seconds once he’d listed the tree frog’s abilities in his head, dread washing over him like a cascade of freezing cold water.
Steve let out a small laugh. “Says the guy who left the island just to be away from me.”
“Of course.” Steve grunted. He watched as Tony’s expression turned from stern, to sad, to nervous, knowing he hated being in these situations. “Tony.” Steve said softly, the engineer looking up at him. “You need to stop this, you need to start putting your work to the back of your mind, or it’s not just me you’re going to lose.”
“I know, I know.” She sniffed, grabbing a hold of his arms to take a good look at him. “But I’m going to miss you, the house will be so quiet without you.”
But what they didn’t know was, the Pterodactyls were heading towards Main Street anyway.
Tony hummed, looking over at Peter who knew exactly what he was about to do. “Bit old for you isn’t he Peter?”
Tony looked up. “Oh, no. Sorry, I’ve got a lot on Pete, I’ll have to catch up with you later on if that’s alright?”
“GO TO HELL, YOU SON OF A BITCH!” Natasha screamed, as she dug her knife into the monster’s skin, stabbing holes right along its top jaw.
“You haven’t even given them a chance.” Schmidt smirked, crossing his arms over his chest. “One field test, that’s all they need, prove how brilliant they could be against our enemies.”
“Bite me, Stark.”
“Not the time!” Peter yelled as he took a glimpse behind them, wishing he hadn’t as the dinosaur was so close he could smell the stench of its breath.
Peter snorted, grabbing the big handle and pushing the door as hard as he could muster. With one shove it gave way and Peter opened it wide enough so that they could both fit through. The younger of the two made his way inside first, closely followed by Wade, who clung to Peter’s arm like his life depended on it.
Peter and Wade spend the day exploring Jurassic Island with a not so welcoming tour guide. Meanwhile, the boss of the park, Tony Stark, is having some dinosaur issues.
Peter laughed. “Is there a bush nearby?”
Wade laughed loudly, gaining Loki’s attention. The two grinned at him innocently, which must have worked as he went back to typing away on his device.
“I’m calling Tony!” Peter breathed out, digging in his trouser pocket to get his phone.
“A rock building?”
“I’d rather dive bomb into a pond than be dinosaur chow!” Was Wade’s simple answer.
Tony stared at the screen that still had the cameras connected, Natasha’s bleeding hand just about in view. Other soldier’s dead bodies were strewn across different screens from different cameras on their clothing, all mangled and bloodied from the massacre.
Tony and Peter spent what seemed like hours just standing there having a stare-down, before Tony finally caved and let out a defeated growl.
If Natasha said that she wasn’t nervous getting out of the company’s van, she’d be downright lying. She’d done plenty of missions like this, retrieving humongous dinosaurs, having to kill some wild ones, running through a herd that could have easily crushed her underneath their ginormous feet. But this, this felt a whole lot different. Not only was she clueless as to what was to come with this newly created dinosaur, but she also had Steve’s words replaying in her head. She knew he was right, of course she did, he was a professional when it came to dinosaurs. But she also knew the creature had to be stopped.
“Uncle Tony?” Peter stared in wonderment.
“Yeah,” Carol snorted, huffing once more. “Don’t know why Natasha didn’t fire that asshole years ago.”
“There’s no other dinosaurs to count.” Wade said looking around as if some would magically appear. “Maybe I should start counting people.”
Turns out the glass building they’d seen earlier was where their next place of transport would be. They followed Loki onto the railway train, and took a seat halfway down the cabin a few rows in front of the man, Peter getting way too eager for his own good as the train shot off and took them closer to his first ever dinosaur encounter.
And now, now he had to go and drive straight up to Steve’s doorstep and ask him for some help. Six months of side-stepping him and it takes an escape artist of a dinosaur and an anxious Luke Cage to push him right back into Steve’s space. He didn’t even know how Steve would react, and that’s what made his heart beat faster than what was normal.
“What’s your orders?” Bruce asked as they walked back inside.
The engineer would have loved to spend the rest of his day there but knew that behind the closed doors he had a lot to deal with. Emails from his business, Stark Industries, were constantly flowing in, and the CEO wouldn’t stop calling him about the new phone that they were about to release. Tony was halfway through a call discussing the phone’s glitches when a large, bulky man came stammering through the room’s main doors.
“This animal is strong, pretty powerful,” Luke said, looking out at the dome. “I made sure we used the thickest steel and strongest cement we could to build it, not to mention the toughest glass imaginable, but I’m still not sure it’ll stop her.”
And that’s what Thor did. There was a few beeps over the line, then a loud buzz before the infrared map popped up on the control room’s screen, showing the area where Natasha and her team stood amongst the trees. Red figures stood out amongst the blue and the green of the scenery around them, showing exactly where the team were standing.
!” May said in all seriousness. “
“BOYS!”
“Tony, behind you!” Steve yelled, as one headed for the engineer.
“Well he’s pretty busy, Aunt May.” Peter shrugged. “Didn’t expect him to take time off work to spend time with his nephew that he hardly knows.”
“Halfway there.” Tony hummed, wondering why a group of flying dinosaurs were harder to take down than he’d imagined. He snorted, giving the offending creature a kick to the stomach.
“Oh, uh yeah.” Peter turned his attention to the phone call, blocking out the sounds of Loki’s shouting. “Uh, it’s going good it’s a great place, we’re having lots of fun, as you can from my earlier comment Wade is behaving as he normally does, and we’ve seen Tony for about five minutes a couple of hours ago. Anything else?”
Tony, Steve and Peter moved their gaze at the other man, and looked at him like he’d grown a second head. And without another word, they sat back, and Tony drove the jeep down the dirt path, heading for the next right turning.
She didn’t take no notice of their shouts on the line, the soldiers scrambling noisily for cover, shots still firing uncontrollably. Natasha held up her own gun once again, pointing it straight at the creature that was coming her way, jaws open, eyes wide in hunger, and she pulled the trigger.
“Exactly,” Aunt May nodded, beginning to push the two towards the gate. “Now go.”
So Steve rolled out from under the jeep, pushing past a few employers that had ran to him asking all sorts of questions, and demanded one of them take him to the laboratory. He was not going to take this laying down, he was going to get into that damn laboratory and find out what the hell that creature was made of, because frankly it had to be stopped before it reached the park. It had to be stopped before any more innocent lives were taken.
Natasha froze. The sudden eerie silence around her making the hairs on the back of her neck stand up, goose bumps crawling over her skin. Then she heard it again,
Peter snorted. “It’s only loud when Wade stays over.”
“Nope!” he said through the headsets in his usual merry voice. “I’ve taught Cage here long enough, thought I’d give him his final lesson today.”
“It’ll be distracted, Wade!” Peter growled in frustration as the dinosaur ripped away some more of the sapling. “You ready?”
Steve sighed, his heart breaking for the older man. He knew Tony never showed how much he cared for his family, but he knew he loved them more than anything in the world. “He’s alive, Tony. He’s a smart kid, he’ll get them out of trouble.” Steve said confidently, resting a hand on his cheek gently. “Tony, we need to go get weapons, find out where exactly Peter is and go from there. I’ll come with you, I’m not letting you do this alone.”
Bruce’s eyebrows shot into his hairline. “I’m surprised you even know what that is.”
“A Braciowhatapuss?”
“Father would be so proud.” Tony said sarcastically.
Peter snorted. “You are so weird.”
us into thinking she had escaped, no dinosaur has
” Thor butted in, having a lightbulb idea by the sounds of it. “
“Peter, we’re going for a swim!”
“Yeah, me too.” Steve smiled.
Thor almost jumped as Carol appeared to his right, looking not so good. “Fine, all park-goers are on Main Street and seem to be keeping busy, the boats are minutes away.”
“This isn’t exactly how I pictured my day.” Tony mumbled, as he trotted along the forest grounds, sopping shoes squelching with each step he took. “Remind me never to take you camping.”
Peter sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. “Just keep quiet, and follow me.”
Wade grinned.
The team split up, four heading around the stream, three walking through the stream, and Matt with two others crept along the edge of the trees. Taking small footsteps forward, guns raised at the ready, the soldiers closed in on the dinosaur who was supposed to be right in front of them, right where a cluster of trees stood.
.” Thor told him, voice sounding worried. “
The group turned to the latest person in the room. Tony’s eyes widening in revelation at the sight of Steve standing by the doors, looking exhausted and covered in dirt and grime.
“Steve,” Natasha spoke up, giving him a one armed hug. “I’m glad you’re alright, I’m so sorry for what happened to Jess and Luke.” She said, keeping a hand on his arm. “But I promise you, we’re going to take that thing down.”
As the jeep sped off down the clear pathway, at an alarming speed, Peter and Steve took a look behind them. The Foniassaurus was following, practically running after its prey, its enormous feet stomping aggressively on the ground, as it snapped its hungry jaws at them.
“I think I shit myself.” Wade said, breaking the eerie silence as the skies cleared.
“Look after your wife, Matt.” Tony said playfully, trying to brighten their moods but only earned an eye roll from Natasha.
“You’re going out there?”
Bruce nodded slowly, wiping at his cheeks. “Yes… yes, of course.” He said softly. “I-I will help in any way I can… anything you need.”
“What? I just… I don’t know…” Tony ran a hand through his messy hair. “I guess being with you… we haven’t spent this much time together since… since forever and I just… I’ve missed this I guess.”
“That’ll take more time,” Luke answered, irritated by the mere thought of having to do more work on the same arena. “We haven’t even finished the outer walls yet!”
“FUCK!” Peter screamed, which gained Tony’s attention.
, it stared me down like she was studying me, not to mention I’ve heard of her attempt to break out through the glass at this new place. They haven’t done enough research or testing on her, not even Bruce and Hank knew her traits when I asked them.”
“You coming in or what?”
“Good idea.” Tony returned the smile. “Let’s get back before those Pterodactyls decide to visit Main Street.”
“I just don’t understand how it could have just jumped the wall without us noticing.”
Tony smiled back. “She’ll be glad we’re carrying on, you know. Glad that we’re not giving up.”
“Is that any way to address your boss?”
“Hey,” Peter stopped all of a sudden, Wade almost walking right into him. “Wade, do you see that?” he asked, pointing down the road, through the tall trees.
Peter smiled, shaking his head at her determination. “Okay, I’ll talk to you later.”
“I knew it was a bad idea!” Bruce huffed, threading his hands through his hair in frustration. “I
Carol was the first to react, wasting no time in pulling the switch that completely shut down the link to Shields cameras. The screens went black, only the one television to the left showing the park’s map, thousands of red dots scrambling across it. Nobody said a word, too shocked and confused at what had just happened, Tony could practically feel the discomfort in the air and he felt sick, sick to his stomach. He’d just lost two more of his close friends.
The two stared at one another, smiling a little. In the moment Tony just wanted to take Steve in his arms and not let go, he needed it, and Steve probably did to. It had been so long since he’d been this close to the younger man, he started to think that maybe Steve might forgive him after all.
“I see you, Monty.” Steve turned to his left, following the raptor as he took a step forward. “Stay right where you are.”
“Follow me,” Loki ushered, pushing past a few straying visitors. “We’ll be going to your rooms first.”
“Why not?”
Steve frowned, someone clapped behind him and laughed. “You really are the dinosaur man.”
“We could tell them there’s been an electric fault with the rides.” Bruce suggested, shrugging his shoulders and looking away shyly as everyone stared at him. “Just a thought.”
“We have to get that Foniassaurus, Tony.” Steve said seriously, just as Tony was getting off the ground and helping him to stand. “It has to die, it’ll kill all the dinosaurs on this island, and it’s too dangerous.”
“Touché.” Tony said with a cough to hide his awkwardness. “Anyway, I uh… see you’ve met Loki.”
Peter shook his head, laughing as Wade stood behind a lamppost and tried his hardest to look discrete. If Loki wasn’t so wedged onto his phone then he’d say Wade would have positively been found out by now. Just as his boyfriend was moving along to the next item to hide behind, which was a garbage bin, Peter’s phone began vibrating in his pocket. He pulled it out in confusion wondering who would be calling him at three in the afternoon, and wasn’t surprised to see his Aunt May’s name flash on the screen.
“The dinosaur?” Tony asked in hope, knowing it was a silly question.
It all happened in a split second. As soon as Steve shouted three he was pushing a shaky Bobby towards the closing gate, the raptors giving out a piercing shriek as they chased after them. Steve could feel his chest sting as they ran for their lives, hearing the dinosaurs get closer, their heavy feet falling noisily against the dirt. His eyes glued to the gate that was slowly shutting, Steve pushed them forward with everything he had.
“Peter?” Tony stilled, cursing the technology gods for not inventing good phone signals. “Peter? Listen to me, listen you have to get yourselves to the information centre okay? You need to get here, right now!”
“Oh, about how this company is dedicated to pleasing the customers? How we have expert geneticists working daily to find new species to create a bigger and better park? How that science guy Wong steals all the tea from the cupboard and constantly plays Beyonce songs whilst working?”
“You’re not… joking?” Bruce asked, merely a whisper. Tony shook his head. “T-The Foniassaurus… it’s escaped?” Steve nodded. “Nat, Matt… Jess and Luke… they’re…” The two men nodded.
“Pretty damn dangerous.” Luke said with confidence. “I’m not a dinosaur expert but, she ate her own sibling so, I’d say she’s worse than a T-Rex.”
“Did I forget your birthday?”
Tony nodded slowly. “But that would kill the other dinosaurs if they touch the fences.”
Tony wanted to spew out the truth. He wanted to tell Steve that yes, he did come down there to ask for help but deep down he’d wanted to see him since the day he left. He wanted to tell him that he’d missed him, he was an idiot before for not being there for him, and that he just wanted a second chance to be the man Steve needed. He almost blurted it out until he caught himself and all that came out was half the truth.
“Not fast enough!” Wade screeched.
“I’m eighteen, Uncle Tony.” Peter said with a roll of his eyes.
Tony was undeniably panicking.
Steve grinned. “I’m sure she would have spat it back out, considering she’s vegetarian.”
Tony sighed. He was starting to feel a headache coming on.
The Foniassaurus dove in once again, ripping the bark apart.
“You’re right,” Tony nodded, putting a supportive arm around Steve to keep him steady. “Yeah, you’re right. It has to go.”
“That Loki’s funny as shit!” Wade whispered beside Peter, laughing to himself as he fiddled with his cap. “Man, I totally want to jump out of a bush and scare the guy.”
.” Steve whispered in their ears, before his voice got brasher and panic stricken as another deeper grumble sounded. “
Thor moved from camera to camera, everyone keeping their eyes peeled for a different kind of red figure amongst the people. But there was nothing. No sign at all of the gigantic dinosaur who had left behind her tracker.
“Thor!” Steve started shouting down the phone, as Tony wasted no time and drove the jeep off, the tyres skidding loudly as he turned it around and shot down the trail. “Thor, there’s been a breach, I repeat there’s been a breach!”
“Guys, code red, we have a breakout!” He could hear the abrupt racket of commotion on the other end of the line. “The Foniassaurus has escaped, get her up on the screen and find out where the hell she is, now!”
Loki could feel his heart beat rapidly in his chest as he sprinted up Main Street, bumping past a small crowd of people that were ducking for cover, trying to stay on his feet as he felt his entire body shake and go weak in fright. He eyed the information centre yards down the road, breath catching as he realised it was further than it looked. And as he took another step, he heard a noise that made his blood go cold.
Peter gulped, feeling goosebumps decorate his entire body as more trees cracked, the earth moved and whatever it was was getting nearer and nearer, as if it knew they were there. “Um Wade… You’re not the only one,” he whispered back. “I think now’s a good time to get the hell out of here.”
Came Thor’s quiet voice in their ears. “
Not only had he lost them but so had Thor, who was holding his head in his hands, knuckles turning white from digging his fingers hard into his skull. Carol had lost her best friend, being Natasha’s maid of honour at her wedding was one of the highlights of her life, the wedding that happened only months ago. And Tony didn’t even want to imagine how Danny would feel when he found out, first Luke and Jessica, and now Matt, Danny’s three friends from childhood all gone in one day.
Before Peter could utter another word, the jeeps window was open and his boyfriend was leaping out of the moving vehicle like he was starring in the great escape.
He knew Steve was no good with emotions, he hated letting people see him upset or angry, he’d always been one to hide himself away instead of letting the tears flow or shouting out loud what he was feeling. It’s one thing they both have in common. Tony was close with Natasha and Matt, but Steve was even more so, Natasha and Matt were like close family to him, so he couldn’t even imagine how he must have been feeling seeing what he did minutes ago. After yanking out his phone and typing a quick text, Tony ambled on over to the younger man.
Tony groaned, tapping his phone against his leg. “I guess we’ll just have to add that if the fences go down then dinosaurs will be set free.”
Peter looked behind him to frown over at his boyfriend, who was trudging through the damp, slimy dirt like it was the most difficult task he’d ever taken on. “Having fun?” Peter smirked, just as Wade stepped in a deep, muddy puddle.
Peter was rudely interrupted as the Foniassaurus decided in that moment to have another try in breaking the trunk. The creature swung its long jaw down onto the bark for a second time, only it didn’t just sink its teeth in as it had seconds before, instead the full force of its bite broke through the tree and sent bits and pieces of the trunk flying everywhere. The couple wailed out in horror, Wade jumping on top of Peter to protect him.
Taking long strides Tony followed the builder into the entrance of the dinosaur’s exhibit, being careful not to touch anything besides the doors as it wasn’t even finished yet. Walking through a small hallway filled with information on the walls about the Jurassic creature, Tony turned a corner and found Luke talking to a builder in a hard hat, right next to a thick, secure screen of glass that stretched from one side of the room to the other.
Bruce turned to him with a frown. “He would be proud of you, you know? He’d be happy with everything you’ve done for this place.”
“But you’re his nephew.”
Peter watched in amusement as he skipped about, failing perfectly. “At least I’m not bored.” He mumbled to himself.
Within seconds it went from silence to utter chaos.
Of course, Wade totally regretted persuading Peter to go in there a few minutes later.
“I’m not that crazy.” Steve said with a shake of his head. “Maybe I should send you in, Logan. I’m sure you could take on four small dinosaurs.”
“WADE!” Peter growled, leaning out of the open door as Wade did some stretches on the grass. “Get back in here now!”
Luke smiled. “I wanted to ask you about the enclosure.” He said, catching Tony’s attention who was close to running as far away as possible. “We need to have it checked, we’re not finished yet but almost there.”
That earned him a smack to the back of the head.
Steve grinned, the two going silent as they crept along the soggy ground. Minutes later, Steve suddenly stopped and frowned. “Tony,” he said quietly, raising his riffle. The damp, dark, silent of the forest was unnerving, sending shivers down his spine. “I’m pretty sure this is where we saw them on the map, it’s near where Thor said he saw them too.”
“Well, you two are.” Tony said, pointing between the two. “You can get on the boats before they leave, go, now.”
“Tony,” Steve sighed, hating the way Tony seemed so nervous and miserable. “You weren’t a terrible boyfriend!”
Without hesitation Steve shoved Clint aside and slammed his hand down on the red button that opened the thick, metal gate, and in a second he was rolling into the enclosure and running to Bobby’s side. He could hear the others yelling behind him to take cover, Clint shouting in utter shock at the man’s actions as he stood to the side, waiting to shut the gate if necessary.
“Then why does it say…” Matt began, but something made him stop mid-sentence.
“She won’t let you.” Steve said confidently. “She’s nothing like you, she takes her job seriously, and actually cares about the employees.”
“Thor,” Steve felt his hand shake as he held the phone to his ear. “We need to get these people off the island,
“Tony,” Steve began, just as the dinosaur took one last deep breath, and closed its eyes. “It’s not your fault.”
“What shall we do next, Mr. Stark?” she asked, willing to do anything that would have made Natasha proud.
You’d have sworn he was going to a big, important business meeting, or starting on a new project that was going to change the world, but no, he was going to meet his ex-boyfriend that he was still completely and utterly in love with. And to make matters worse, he hadn’t seen the guy since they’d broken up, and that had been six months ago. Tony had spent three of those months afterwards at his home in New York, paying more attention to Stark Industries whilst Bruce took over at the park. In the last three months he’d returned to the park, getting stuck into anything he could get his hands on, almost taking an interest in the new dinosaur thing, and building new tech for the innovation centre. All the while avoiding his ex like the plague.
Bruce sighed. “Just trust me, Tony. Creating this dinosaur will bring this park to a whole other level.”
But he looked away, took a well needed breath, and thought about Aunt May cutting his tongue out if he didn’t get his butt out of the car. With one swift movement Tony opened his door and practically dived out, straightening his tie and rubbing down his suit encase there were creases. Steve still hadn’t noticed his presence since the radio was on, but as soon as Tony accidentally slammed the car door shut with a loud thud the blonde looked up and caught his eye.
“Steve!” Peter screamed, just as a shout sounded from where they pointed.
“Peter,” Wade spoke as quietly as possible. “Please tell me that’s not the big dude.”
Wade put a hand to his heart and fake gasped as he plonked himself next to her, as Peter let out a groan in embarrassment. “Why, Mrs May, I would never inappropriately touch your barely legal blood relative!”
Natasha and Matt locked eyes before just behind him something moved, rustling the trees and leaves. Matt, slowly turning on the spot, came face to face with the Foniassaurus who crept out from between the greenery as if disguised amongst it, its humongous jaws just inches from him, revealing its filthy, sharp teeth.
“Well,” Wade breathed out, coming to lay beside his boyfriend, and tangling his fingers through his hair. “That’ll teach us to jump out of a moving vehicle, huh?”
“I’m sorry.” Tony whispered, feeling guilty once again for all that was happening. “I’m so sorry.”
“You do know that making that thing was a stupid idea right?” Steve said. “And that name, Foniassaurus, who the hell named it?”
Thankfully Wade did just that. Seconds later the two were trailing after the omnivore, ducking as low as they could, and freezing like a couple of statues when the dinosaur’s eyes glanced their way.
“In the damn car, now!” Tony shouted in panic.
“I don’t!” Wade grinned, as he followed his boyfriend.
Wade looked over not so discretely. “Mr. don’t touch my hair is currently talking on the phone, I wonder if it’s his boss from the robot clang.”
The three shared the same look of dread, thinking of the thousands of people on the island that were already, possibly feeling uneasy about being in the situation they were in as it was. And to make things worse, they were all being rounded into one place.
“This is the first information centre my grandfather built on the island.” Peter said, picking up a poster of a velociraptor. “Only stayed open for a year before he built the new one. Think it was because he wanted to build one closer to the water.”
The employers in the room all nodded, some piping up in agreement. Tony suddenly felt a whole lot better than he had seconds ago as his eyes travelled across the room, his workers looking at him with pure determination on their faces, Carol standing by her station with brows furrowed and hands fisted by her side like she was ready for war.
“No, you think?” Tony grunted, taking a long swig of the water.
With that said Luke sauntered off into the enclosure’s viewing area, leaving the two once again alone. Before Tony could even think about what he wanted to say next, Steve had opened his door and was stepping out, carefully shutting it behind him as the engineer sat and stared at the spot he’d been occupying.
Tony snorted. “I think it fits perfectly well Bruce, I should have it debuted.”
“There he is, our born leader!” Tony grinned, firing at another Pterodactyl, and ducking as one flew right over him. “Bastard!”
*****
“Fuck.” Tony breathed.
Tony, the son of the founder of Jurassic World turned to his friend, who also happened to be the park’s head scientist.
The Foniassaurus roared once more, bullets hitting her from head to feet, bouncing off her skin as if she were bulletproof. Natasha didn’t stop, she screamed until her throat hurt, crashing bullet after bullet at the monster, standing her ground. It took seconds before the Foniassaurus reached her, its teeth baring as it flung itself forward to grab her. Natasha dodged the creature’s jaws, yanking a knife out of her pocket she swung for the dinosaur’s eye, instead slicing it across its nose. The Foniassaurus let out a loud yelp, shaking its head like it would make the pain disappear.
“You do what you have to do.” Tony piped in, not wanting to waste any time and start an argument. He sneaked a quick glance at Steve, who kept his gaze on the carpet, before continuing. “We just have to keep this thing away from the public, no matter what.”
that gets in her way, you won’t be able to stop her.”
Steve bit his bottom lip and looked down, making Tony wonder if his word vomit had once again messed everything up. Thankfully, it seemed to have done the complete opposite this time.
“Run!” Steve shouted, as Luke pushed him and Jessica towards the gate.
“Tony, I think you need to slow down.”
“Why not?” Wade smirked, turning to Peter with a wicked glint in his eyes. “I say we go pet it and spring this joint.”
“We did, Steve,” Matt answered. “We can bring it down, we’re taking our strongest weapons-,”
“Sure,” Tony hummed, checking his phone for any new emails from his company. “And you think kids don’t like the good ole t-rex anymore?”
“Luke.”
“My god…” Bruce whimpered, as his two friends lowered him onto the seat. “My god… my god…” he stuttered. “What have we done… it’s my fault… oh god…”
“I heard it alright.”
Natasha rolled her eyes.
“Nerd.” Wade poked him in the side.
Steve snickered, shaking his head. “Just shoot the damn birds, Tony.”
His mood lifted quite a bit when they got into the visitor’s hall for the Foniassaurus’s lair,
Luke didn’t even seem affected at all, he’d hopped out of the craft with a satisfied grin on his face and stuck his thumb up in Tony’s direction before he sauntered into the dinosaur’s new enclosure. Tony glared at the man’s retreating back, wanting to throw the water bottle in his direction. He thought better of it when Danny helped him up and told him he’d better get inside before Luke’s patience wears off.
“Yeah,” Steve could imagine Natasha now, yelling at them to get their asses into gear and get a move on. “I don’t… I don’t want her and Matt’s death to be for nothing, Tony. Nor Luke and Jessicas. We need to get that dinosaur, and we need to keep those visitors safe, for them.”
“Whatever.” Loki murmured, going straight back to his phone.
“Stark, don’t you start! You don’t know anything about her!”
Peter and Wade wouldn’t admit it out loud to anyone, but they were having the time of their lives. Since leaving their hotel room, Loki tottering behind them like an old dog, the two had spent the last three hours running around the place like a couple of school children. The first dinosaurs they’d seen were the Gallimimus, about five of the carnivorous creatures had a nice, green patch all to themselves, they’d watched them for ages as the dinosaurs jumped over their rocks and picked at the trees for grub.
Ten minutes later the two were seated in a glass top jeep that was so brightly painted with dinosaurs that it made their eyes hurt, Peter sat himself down in the passenger’s side, and Wade excitedly got behind the wheel. He was just a tad disappointed when he found that the steering wheel was being controlled and he had no way of moving it by himself.
“Pray this’ll work!” He yelled, as he drove them into the thick cluster of trees.
“What’s the matter?” Steve asked beside him, leaning over to see what the other man was so worried about. “Is that…”
Steve chuckled. “You know what, I wouldn’t be surprised if he tried.”
Tony’s foot slammed down hard on the break, the car coming to an abrupt stop right around the corner from the control room building.
Steve unexpectedly smiled, shaking his head in disbelief. “You came down here to say hi?”
“That’s the problem,” Steve said, lowering his voice. “She’s been cooped up behind walls since the day she was born, now she’s free, she’s out there exploring and hunting and nothing’s stopping her from doing what she wants.” Steve looked between Matt and Natasha, a pleading look in his eyes. “She will kill
Steve turned back and gave him a confused look. “I’m pretty sure we weren’t looking for your lost nephew and running from a dinosaur.”
Tony and Steve stopped then, facing the two, as Clint couldn’t help smirk to himself as he carried on into the building. “Peter,” Steve said, a lot calmer than Tony. “It’s dangerous, you’ve seen what the Foniassaurus can do, you have to get on a boat.”
Jessica crossed her arms over her chest, annoyed as hell at what had happened. The three had checked out the scuffs on the wall up close, surely enough it was unquestionably the Foniassaurus’s claw marks, dug deep into the stone.
“The Foniassaurus has turned right.”
“No, you don’t understand.” Steve said, starting to sound panicked. “Tony, you need to turn up here, the next right.”
” The control room had obviously put the security cameras on screen and seen it for themselves.
“Language, Peter.” Aunt May said as she drove off. “And yes you would, Wade. I may be old but I’m not blind.”
Peter stuck his tongue out, turning to Loki who’d gotten his nose stuck in his phone again. “Loki?” the man looked up unamused. “Any chance we could come back later for the lab tour?”
“Yeah!” Peter smirked.
“Steve…” but before Tony could say no more, Steve had leaned in and was kissing him.
“So?” Peter shrugged. “Do we go to the boats?”
Steve nodded, giving the dinosaur one last pat before he stood, following Tony back to the car. But he didn’t get far before he bumped right into the other man who was stock still in the middle of the field, staring out at the distance. Steve followed his gaze, and his heart skipped a beat.
Tony whipped his head around so fast he felt it click. Thankfully he wasn’t met with a ginormous, scary looking lizard with sharp teeth and red eyes, but what he saw was just as bad. There, amongst the trees, he could just about see two big, black eyes staring right at him. Tony froze as the dinosaur blinked, its eyes not leaving him as it stood there stock still, probably imagining how tasty he’d look on a platter with French dressing and a salad.
Peter hummed. “You do that, I’m sure he’ll appreciate it.”
“Peter,” Tony scoffed, only now noticing the Shield employees gathered nearby, and trying very hard not to look awkward whilst looking at anything but them. “Watch your fucking language.”
“BOYS! LET’S GO!”
That’s precisely what the engineer did. Slamming his foot down on the gas, Tony swung the wheel to the right and had the jeep skidding through the mud, bits of dirt and dust flying into the air. Peter and Wade screamed as the car almost fell to its side from the sheer force.
A grey haired woman named Aunt May yelled from the front door of a two storey house, fiddling through her bottomless handbag to try and find her car keys. Meanwhile, as she stepped down onto her drive, in the front bedroom of the house said boys were busy scattering about the room in a mad dash. More like: one was scattering whilst the other decided on what to wear.
“What?” Tony asked, worry washing over him again.
When they pulled apart they were breathless, still clutching to each other like a lifeline, but smiling happily at one another.
Peter chuckled as they made their way to the middle of the room, stopping to look at the touch screen information board. “Look, they’ve got a lab tour every four hours!”
The engineer just about saw the Pterodactyl that flew at them with an ear-splitting squawk, and he didn’t have time to do anything before the deafening sound of a gun shot went off behind him and sent the dinosaur tumbling to the ground. He took a glimpse in the side mirror, seeing Steve in the backseat, rifle pointed up into the sky. Tony couldn’t help the smirk that grew on his lips, knowing there’s nobody they could rely on more than Steve Rogers to keep them safe.
Wade gave his dinosaur hat a good tap. “Why thank you, Starky.”
“Because it’s too strong, and shouldn’t be here.”
Tony sighed, easing up on the gas. “He also said the dinosaur disappeared off the radar!”
“But she’s not here now,” Natasha tried to reassure him, tucking her camera back into its pouch and pulling her gun back up in defence. “Look, if it makes you feel better we won’t go searching for her, not yet anyway, we’ll just go back the way we came, we’ll go back to the van and you lot get some damn infrared cameras across the park and find that bitch and
Did you really think I was gonna kill our boy Loki? Never!
“I’ve always thought he was a nice guy myself.” Steve said sarcastically, earning a laugh from Clint as he held out his arms to take one of the buckets.
“Don’t.” Steve said firmly. “It’s not your fault.”
“You can’t help unless you have a bloody gun in your pocket!” Tony said impatiently, pushing Peter away. “Now go!”
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*****
Tony just grunted in response before looking for Loki’s name and trying him too. To no avail not even Thor’s brother who loved his phone more than life itself was answering, and Tony wanted to throw his own against a wall. With one last attempt he tried his nephew again.
“You’re
Wade leaned over the side of the car to address Steve, who was watching the two family members in amusement. “So, Steve-o, how’d you get such shiny hair?”
“Ready when you are,” Natasha told them, yanking the small camera that was stuck to her suit, holding it outwards. “Scan through all of them, we’ll each hold the cameras up at different angles.”
Bruce merrily nodded, letting Tony lead him out into the brightly lit hallway, Steve following behind. Once they were there Bruce could tell something bad had happened by the serious look on Tony’s face, and he was shocked to find that Steve was trying his hardest to hold back tears. He’d never seen his friends in this state before.
“Come on!” Wade grinned excitedly, grabbing a hold of Peter’s hand and yanking him off the ground. “Let’s go!”
“Steve is in there too!”
“Watch your mouth!” Tony shouted at him. “And yes, I agree. Thank fuck.” He sighed, not slowing down in the slightest.
“Not much of a talker.” Wade whispered. “We think he might be a robot.”
Wade smirked. “Anything?”
“Wade!” Peter groaned, the two getting some serious looks from the pair in front of them. “Sometimes I wonder why I take you out in public.”
Steve smiled amusedly at Tony who was looking not so pleased at his nephew’s boyfriend’s comment, which, he hoped, was a lie. Peter ignored his comment, and instead grabbed Wade’s shirt and pulled him into a hug, needing it after what they’d just been through.
“Gee, that was depressing of you.”
“Jess and Luke?”
Tony sighed, rubbing a sore spot on his forehead. “Right… yeah um…”
“Mr. Bubblebutt will be thanking me one day, he has a nice, new fence now.” Wade said proudly, going from pulling on Peter’s sleeve to hugging his arm. “So can I sit in the driver’s seat? I promise not to fart in bed anymore if you let me!”
Tony didn’t need to be reminded, and raised his gun, finger on the trigger and ready to fire.
“I’m sure they will,” Bruce said confidently. “Creating a new dinosaur will get them to listen and be interested in the park enough to sponsor us, they’ll be begging to be a part of this.”
“I’ll think about that later.” Tony sighed. “For now, I just hope Shield has this in the bag.”
Sorry for the stupidly late update guys! I can't update very often due to work and what not but I'll try my best :)
Steve looked like he’d been kicked in the gut, and Tony wanted to take him in his arms and hug him and tell him he was sorry. “Okay,” Steve’s dejected look changed so quick you could have missed it. “What enclosure?”
“Clint!” Steve huffed, as he shot another pterodactyl.
So, being the sensible one of the two, Peter had found a ride that didn’t include a speed of over twenty miles per hour. They were currently in the queue for said ride, which included a dirt track, a jeep, and a lot of wandering dinosaurs. Peter was already having second thoughts the nearer they got to the front.
“URGH!” Tony growled, rubbing a hand down his face. Kids. He was never having them. “That doesn’t matter now anyway, listen Peter…” a loud crackling suddenly shot through the phone. “Peter?”
.” Peter mumbled.
“You wait until I get my hands on Hank!” Tony growled. “When he gets back from vacation I’ll ring his freaking-,”
Tony smiled. “Nah, feels like only yesterday you were bossing me about, telling me how to hand feed those baby dinosaurs with the horn thingies.”
Clint snorted. “Like Shield will allow that, they’d have to be pretty desperate to test out the raptor’s abilities outside of that cage.”
Tony laughed at his own joke, waiting for a hint of a smile on Steve’s face. The blonde stood there, face still inexpressive, making Tony fidget with uncomfortableness.
The tedious eight hour flight to Costa Rica felt more like twenty hours to Peter. As their plane landed safely on the tarmac he was more than happy to disembark and get on the mini bus, where they’d then be driven to the boat that would take them to the island. He’d always hated flying because of the constant humming from the engines which drove him insane, and the hours of sitting on his butt without stretching his legs or arms, and on this flight Wade and himself had been stuck behind a screaming baby who had an infuriating way of knowing when Peter wanted to fall asleep.
The three walked towards the blonde and the closer they got the wider their eyes grew. All three felt a sudden surge of panic, Luke cursing loudly as Jessica grabbed him by the arm and tugged him out of the hall.
“Thor.” Loki chocked out, wishing his big brother was there. Wishing he’d taken him seriously not minutes ago, and listened to what he’d said. “Thor.” He choked.
“She didn’t want them for food?”
Tony snorted. “Nope, not in the slightest. But Peter can be a little shit sometimes, and I really can’t be bothered to argue.”
“Monty, Frenchie, Gabe!” Steve called to each Raptor as he threw them all a rat in turn, every single one gobbling down the treat like it was their last. “Good boys.” Steve smiled, watching as the four animals gazed up at him as they finished.
Tony kept on grinning, and in his most flirtatious voice said, “Well, hello handsome.”
Steve dumped his tool box on the porch as he reached for his jacket hanging over the rail, standing on the step he slipped it on and noticed Tony’s eyes quickly avert to look at the ground.
“Sir?”
Peter couldn’t argue with that. And before he knew it they were mere inches away from jumping off of the rock face. They had seconds before they could decide whether to chicken out and stop, but when the Foniassaurus let another roar tear out of its throat they didn’t have to decide anything. Peter and Wade squeezed each other’s hands tight, and with a giant leap they fell from the cliff top, the Foniassaurus skidding to a halt as it tried in a last attempt to reach out with its jaws to catch them.
“I’m fine, Tony.” Steve hummed, cringing as he touched his cheek. He looked up at the older man, who seemed more worried than he’d ever seen him. “I’m okay.” He whispered, placing a hand on Tony’s neck.
“Love you too, Aunt May.” Peter said as he hung up the phone.
“We’re at a theme park.” Wade said happily, as he chose the door to the left to try.
Thor nodded, running a hand through his unruly hair. “Steve said there’s been a breach, but according to the security systems and the cameras every cage is in tack. Well, except for the obvious.”
“Don’t know why I didn’t just sell this place.” Tony sighed, thinking back to the time his father had told him he’d left the entire park in his will to Tony. It wasn’t easy running two businesses at the same time, even though he had a lot of help from both ends. “Maybe I could sell some dinosaurs to Manhattan Zoo, they’d love a Spinosaurus as a main attraction.”
Tony slumped in his chair and looked at his watch. “Shit,” he mumbled. “Look Pep, I’ll have to call you back.” He said down the phone and shoved it in his pocket.
“Hey! He’s moving!” Peter perked up, shaking his boyfriend’s arm to get his attention. “Look! He’s going through that gap in the fence.”
Hi everyone!
Geared up in bullet proof vests, hard leather shoes, and rock solid helmets, each member of the ten soldier team stepped out cautiously into the forest. Matt lead the way in front, as his wife took the back, their most deadly guns held up at the ready. Some of the soldiers had Tasers as back up, some had brought their sharpest knives, some even had grenades strapped to their packs, ready for anything after the news of the dinosaur’s escape had reached them.
Peter sighed. “Yeah, fine. Not that I’m surprised or anything.”
“We’re with you!” Thor suddenly said, face contorted in complete rage at what he’d just witnessed, he got up from his chair to stand beside them. “Steve’s right, whatever it is you need us to do, boss, we’ll do it.”
Tony was having a total meltdown. After everything that had happened that morning, to sorting out the parks electrical fences and formulating a plan to capture and kill the Foniassaurus, making sure Peter wasn’t dinosaur bait had quickly pushed to the front of his mind. The engineer virtually trudged a hole into the floor of the hallway of the control room, Steve standing calmly by the wall, as he held his phone to his ear.
It was obvious what the item was when Matt scooped it out of the ground, and held it up for everyone to see. Natasha cursed out loud, the soldiers looking defeated and just a tiny bit terrified at the prospect of now not knowing where this creature could be.
“What?” Steve let out in surprise. “Here? As in here at the park?”
Steve’s eyes widened in shock as the new breed of dinosaur crashed through, roaring once more as if letting the whole park know that she was free, and she was ready to hunt. It was confirmed that those walls indubitably couldn’t hold her. Steve, hoping against all odds that she hadn’t seen him, hurriedly got down in the dirt and rolled under the jeep to lay on his back. And he waited.
Tony swallowed the lump that had formed in his throat, taking small steps over to his friend who stood as he drew closer. He didn’t want to hear it, he didn’t want to hear what had happened, he didn’t want to hear that he’d lost the man who meant everything to him.
Bobby’s eyed widened.
.” May’s voice completely changed then, sounding a lot happier as she laughed lightly. “
“If this is supposed to be one of the thickest pieces of glass in the world,” Steve went on. “Then how come the Foniassaurus can break it with one hit?”
Since the Avengers Endgame release (which was incredible and perfect and I cried happy tears for Cap) I've been on Marvel mode. Sorry if this chapter seems rushed and crappy, I hope you like it anyway!
Steve just sighed, looking down at the spanner in his hand before tossing it into the tool box. “What do you want, Tony?” he questioned, crossing his arms over his chest. He knew the man well enough to know he was trying to avoid the obvious tension between them with those jokes.
“Maybe he was talking about the Foniassaurus?” Clint suggested. “Maybe she’s gotten into somewhere? Through the fences?”
The young man sat back and tried his damn hardest to block out the annoying voices of all the guests, and at least take a five minute nap before he had his shift at the café. But apparently it wasn’t meant to be, as the next thing he knew, a loud, high-pitched hum was resounding across the park.
“Shit!” Tony cursed. “They’ve gone.”
Steve went straight into action, running around to the back of the cage where most of the employees were gathered. The trainer saw his close friend standing near the gate, shouting God only knew what to the others.
“Cuttlefish?” Steve cut across, eyes widening as he put two and two together. “Why on earth… Hank wanted her to have cuttlefish DNA?”
“What the fuck was that?”
“WHAT?” Wade let out in surprise.
The engineer hung up on Thor, not caring what he had to say next, because he needed to hear Steve’s voice for himself, he needed to get them the hell out of there before that thing got anywhere near them. Hands continuing to shake out of control, Tony hurriedly dialled Steve’s number, knowing he’d get a hold of the group a whole lot quicker that way.
At Steve’s words Tony felt a lump in his throat, his mind drifting to the day Steve had said similar words to him before he’d ended their one year relationship. “I know.” He said soundlessly, hating how defeated he sounded. “I wish I had tried harder, I wish I hadn’t lost you.”
The eighteen metre sea dwelling monster was held in a gigantic tank where it hid away in the murky water. As the two sat down alongside Loki (who by this point wanted to cry of boredom) on one of the hundreds of rows of seat in front of the tank, they had no idea what to expect. When a huge great white shark was flown above them on a crate and stopped above the still water, it had the whole audience gasping and clapping in astonishment. Wade had almost weed himself as the Mosasaurus leapt out of the water with a loud wail and snatched the shark in its jaws, landing back into its tank with a thunderous splash that had the entire audience drenched from head to toes.
“WHERE?” Wade yelled, standing straight in a split second to look around with wide eyes. He was not taking on another damn dinosaur.
Loki growled, huffing and puffing as he sat upright and glared at wherever the noise was coming from. “Are you kidding me?” he grumbled, noticing the noise was blasting from the sirens. He scoffed at the things, knowing they’d only go off if something bad had happened. “Let me guess, Thor escaped from his cage.” He snickered at his own joke.
Peter snorted, crossing his arms over his chest. “One, you’re starting to sound like Aunt May,” Tony cringed. “And two, didn’t you date that dinosaur guy called Steve like not so long ago who was, what did Aunt May say again? Oh yeah, twenty years younger than you? Wasn’t he a bit young for you?”
“It’s like watching the discovery channel.” Wade mumbled, his eyes following the Ankylosaur’s tail swish one way then the other. “Hey,” he said suddenly. “Your uncle should really see about getting those jeeps checked out…”
Matt kept the tracker at eye level, taking slow, tentative steps through the wet, mucky woodland, feeling his heart beat rising the closer he got to the spot where the dinosaur was lurking. The device began beeping lightly, the red dot flashing faster and faster as Matt lead the team down a slight ditch, stepping into a shallow stream underneath tall, dark trees.
“Doesn’t help.” Steve said as he began walking down the steps and across the lawn to his bike.
Steve nodded, sticking his phone back into his pocket. He led them a little further through the tall, old trees, across some small, trickling rivers, and fallen logs, all the while Tony watched his ex as he moved with purpose, that determined look in his eyes. Tony couldn’t help but smile.
“Come on!” he said, gasping for breath.
“Yeah,” Peter answered. “Who are you?”
“Ahem.”
Really sorry for the long updates guys! I am trying to finish this fic, but I've got so much on and so many fics on the go it's getting hard to find the time to write it! Thanks for being patient and I know I'm not a great writer haha so thanks for your lovely comments you've been posting! <3
“Knock, knock.” Wade beat his knuckles against the metal, before flinging it open.
Aunt May growled. “
, let alone the kids.”
Tony really hadn’t liked the idea of jumping over an extremely tall cliff into the not so enticing looking pond, but after a bit of coaching from Steve, and knowing it would be a heck of a lot quicker that way, Tony had taken the plunge. Literally. Steve had leapt off the cliff first, throwing his riffle and phone over the side and onto the ground below just before his feet hit the water. He’d come up for air seconds later, floating around and yelling up at Tony to come down. Safe to say, the engineer would not be flying off any cliffs anytime soon, or ever again for that matter.
Steve gazed at the ground, and back up. “Yeah, I’ve missed this too.”
Bruce rolled his eyes, tucking said clipboard under his arm. “Anyway, do you remember what you have to tell them?”
Steve gazed at his bike then up at Tony like it was apparent. “I’m going to the Foniassaurus like you asked me.”
“The fonia… thingy’s enclosure.” Tony said, watching as Steve put his tools away into the blue box, acting like nothing was wrong between them at all.
Steve ran a hand through his unruly hair, grabbing onto the door as they ran through a pothole. “You don’t know that, Thor just told us they found two people making their way through the woods.”
Tony wasn’t listening, his mind was tuned into one thing, and that was getting the hell out there to find his nephew. As soon as he’d heard Peter’s cries for help over the phone, he knew he had to do something. Peter and Wade had no idea what was happening, they were out there, God knows how, on their own, with the most dangerous dinosaur in the park on their tail. He couldn’t stand around and wait for the Foniassaurus to kill again.
Just as Peter was about to answer he spotted Wade jump out of a bush right behind Loki, the waiter screamed loudly, spinning around to find Wade laughing his behind off. Peter burst out laughing as Loki suddenly began to chase Wade around with a big stick off the ground.
Peter laughed. If only their trip to Jurassic Island would be that exciting.
“Wouldn’t surprise me.” Tony said, pulling up his phone. “Right, so, I’ve just got an email off Pepper about some Skype meetings I have with Stark Industries in a few hours and I’ve got to go talk dinosaurs with some people, I will make sure Loki shows you the full experience of this place.
“Oh,” Peter pulled a face, he completely forgot to call, too caught up in all the fun he and Wade were having. “I’m sorry Aunt May, the signal’s crap here, was going to call you soon.” He lied.
Peter huffed in annoyance, but couldn’t argue when they were in the middle of being attacked. Besides, Wade was practically dragging him away and towards the nearest table to hide under. Tony and Steve shared a look as they held up their guns, without saying a word they both took their stance, and pointed towards the sky. As the dinosaurs screeched and shrieked around them, Steve and Tony began to shoot, joining in with the Shield employees.
“Bruce, that’s a good and very believable idea.” Tony said with a snap of his fingers. “You heard him Thor, tell them to let the guests know there’s an electrical fault with one of the rides and it’s causing interruptions with the rest of the park, and make up some big lie about Main Street being the only safe place to stay whilst we fix it up.”
“Look,” Steve said, voice quieting as all eyes in the room were on them, everyone waiting for an order. “We can’t stop now.” He began. “Natasha and Matt would want us to fight on. Those people down there, they’re in danger, we have to make sure we get every single one of them to safety. That’s all that matters now. We get those people off this island, then we kill that monster once and for all.”
As if on cue Aunt May’s voice bellowed from downstairs. Peter and Wade rushed down the stairs and through the front door, finding a very peeved Aunt May standing beside her car waiting. Peter sent her a big smile as he locked the front door behind him, noticing how Wade began whistling as he avoided all eye contact with her, practically tip toeing to the other side of the vehicle.
“Good point.” He said, grinning as Wade sauntered up to him and wound his arms around the younger’s waist.
“It doesn’t have to keep going on like that, you know.” Steve said, catching the other man’s gaze. “You even told me yourself that you hardly see your sister anymore, Tony. Not to mention Peter.”
“Erm... in a jungle, on an Island, somewhere in Puerto Rico? Or was it Cuba? Or Liberty Island?”
“Tony.” Bruce deadpanned.
Steve held his hands higher, giving the raptors each a quick look in their eyes before he addressed Bobby. “We’re going to run in three, okay?”
.” Tony answered, feeling kind of relieved. “
Loki was beyond confused as he listened to his brother blab on over the phone, wondering if this was some kind of weird joke, or if the older man had finally lost his mind. He didn’t have to wait long to know that Thor’s state of panic was real, as the next thing he knew all hell was breaking lose.
“He doesn’t care.” Peter said, adjusting his bag on the floor. “Last time I saw him he was more glued to his phone than he was paying any attention to me and aunt May. He even tried to bribe me with a new Ipad if I left him alone.”
“There is that.” Carol smiled a little, before grabbing her phone from her back pocket. “You heard from Tony yet?”
“Peter,” Tony turned to his nephew, as he heard Steve load his riffle. “You and Wade need to find somewhere to hide, stay undercover.”
Steve tried to smile, but failed terribly. “Stay safe.” Was all he could say, knowing nobody would heed his words no matter how hard he tried.

“Well done, Steven.”
Tony nodded rapidly, avoiding the blonde’s gaze.
There was a loud crash of something that sounded like wood breaking, followed by more screams that sounded like Peter and Wade, before the familiar echo of a dinosaur’s resounding roar echoed through the room. And then the line went dead.
“Think we might have found our ticket back.” Peter mumbled as he leaned over to check the mechanics inside. “Wade, can you find a key?”
Tony sighed heavily, he wasn’t sure if what just happened was good or bad, or if he felt better or worse, and it made his brain feel like it was about to explode. But he didn’t have much time to sit there because Steve was making his way slowly to the building Luke had just gone into, Tony undid his belt and got out of the car as swift as he could. He jogged to keep up with Steve and they both walked side by side towards the structure.
Peter looked at him like he was an idiot. Which, really, he wasn’t wrong.
Natasha’s grip on the gun tightened. She thought of her husband, dead on the ground not far away from her, of her soldiers who’d lost their lives mercilessly, of the thousands upon thousands of innocent lives on that island that were oblivious to the danger that was unfolding that very minute. She wasn’t going to run, she was going to do her job and fight for those people, no matter the consequences.
Wade stepped out of the room he was in and skipped into the one Peter stood in, and as soon as he entered he grinned from ear to ear at what he saw.
"Yeah." Peter nodded and pulled away.
"I was on floor sixteen. Why couldn't you find me?" Peter asked.
"King of the lab?" Peter asked hopefully.
The kid was one annoyingly upbeat and naïve kid.
"It's okay, I like stubborn girls." Wade grinned. He stepped up and wrapped his arms around Maggie, pulling her into a hug. "Alright love, come back a bona fide badass, alright?"
Cool thing, one of my stories got nominated for the Irondad Creative awards. Just saw that today. Thank you for whoever nominated, I'm touched. <3
Maggie sat down across from him. "Now, you're going to tell me why you're avoiding me. Because I can't leave until this is fixed."
"Yeah, true." Vanessa agreed. "Wade and I saw her file, her medical file." She leaned forward. "She was surrounded by female nurses and a female doctor...but she let you stitch her ribs, shoulder, and thigh. YOU. Now, I know how Maggie thinks, because I'm a woman who's been abused too. I size everyone up. I look at everyone I meet and categorize them. 'Who could I beat in a fight? Which corner of the room is safest? Could I take out enough people to get out of the room? Which person is least intimidating? Who gives off the wrong vibes? Will this person hurt me?'" Vanessa shook her head. "So the fact that Maggie picked a tall, broad-shouldered, strong man with magic fucking powers to take care of her as opposed to a smaller, slimmer, powerless by comparison, female, it tells me something."
"She's spunky!" Tony heard Clint call from the background.
Tock.
Two Avengers on one little girl though seemed really unfair.
"Considering a hip-hop ballet fusion, probably to dubstep. Wade wanted dubstep. Though, I am considering a few other songs. You?"
"It's vibranium, Peter."
Peter laughed. "You're the best, Zio Clint."
"You need rest."
He wasn't sure that was the best idea. Maybe she'd come to her senses and realized just how awful a person he was. They were supposed to be friends. He was supposed to be her friend...and he'd left her. Last he'd heard, from Clint, she was walking, but only with help on either side of her. The guilt made his chest ache. He couldn't see her like that. Couldn't think of her like that...because it was his fault.
Maggie leaned forward. "I can't see danger lines around someone."
"Okay, turn." Peter laughed. "No. Wrong way."
Peter frowned. How had they gotten close to his dad? Close enough to hear his heartbeat? To record it?
The context was clear. They may not start off wanting to hurt the kids too badly, but...if they got bored. If they wanted Tony to have more pain and suffering...then it could get very very bloody. "Fuck, this is my fault." Tony whispered, tears running down his face. He didn't even know what he'd done. Who did he piss off this time? First Stane, now these people? His son had gone through enough and so had Maggie Wilson.
Maggie took his hand and stood up. "I'm okay...just wrung-out." She paused and frowned. She'd never felt his hands before. She wasn't used to physical contact. She didn't want to be used to it. That didn't mean she didn't need it. Maggie was human (mutant, but who cares about technicalities), after all, and humans needed contact with other people. Touch starvation was real, and she felt it on a daily basis. She, however, wanted it on her terms, not anyone else's. She wore gloves so she always had a choice, a choice of who she touched and when and why. She liked having control over that. Very few people had she ever taken her gloves off around. Wade and Vanessa among the only ones, though Professor X had been safe as well.
"Well, this sucks. You know who I am, but all I know is that you're probably an Olympic gymnast."
"May!" Her head swung around, confused again, but she shrugged and kept walking.
"Shit."
Peter's whole body tensed.
"Hello, Peter." She responded again. "Boss and Captain Rogers has dinner ready."
"I feel like you're trying to distract me. I don't like it." Peter narrowed his eyes.
Peter walked from Happy's car towards his school and paused when his phone rang. That wasn't normal. His old phone would get spam calls, but since he'd gotten a Stark Phone that hadn't happened. Who else called? Even Steve texted most the time. Peter picked up his phone and saw Maggie's picture on the screen. That made sense, it was too early for her to text. He answered and put it to his ear. "Hey, Maggie."
"Oh...look at that. An open door." He grinned. He'd never been able to get one of his drones through that door before. "Thank you, Peter Parker."
I got stuck on this one. And I went to work on other things to try to sort of refresh (if you're a fan of Hannibal, I've written a few stories for that). But I've also started writing some of my own stuff for the first time and that's been really fun and distracting. Plus life is just crazy now.
"Okay." Maggie slid out of the seat, Vanessa helped her to her feet with a gentle hand on her forearm.
"No! No! NO! I've got it. I'm going to win this war!" Peter knew this would make her laugh and maybe give up.
When Peter got into the car, his eyes widened. In the front seat, were four bags of Five Guys food. "My God, Pepper's the best."
Peter was glad to have a room with Tony and Steve, because it was easier.
"And I've never seen you out of gloves before. It's weird." He retorted, grabbing a bagel and sitting at the kitchen bar.
"Peter?"
His spidersense flared. "Thought I told you what would happen if you tried to get out." A distorted voice said.
