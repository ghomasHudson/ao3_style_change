, of all places in the Tower. Tony would’ve rather been put back in his very comfortable bed on the penthouse. Which isn’t to say that the couch
“You know what, Wilson,” Steve muttered, sitting up carefully so he didn’t dislodge Dodger, who had started to perk up at the sudden flurry of activity happening around him.
A part of him wanted to go. What was the worst that could happen, right? His pride was at war with that tiny, very irrational part of him that still believed in love and the absolute bullshit drilled into their minds, and Tony honestly was not sure which side was going to win this one.
“Yeah, it is,” Tony mumbles, reaching out to Steve, wrapping his free arm around his neck and pulling him close. “Remember how we met?”
“Hello? Who’s this?” The man asks, his voice just veering on the edge of being too loud. “I’m not interested in purchasing whatever you’re selling, but thanks anyway.”
The kid seems to hesitate but agrees after another pause. Tony can hear the sound of him running through the house, apparently looking for his father.
“Need a ride, Captain?” Iron Man drawls through the voice modulator of the suit as he flies towards Steve.
Steve sighed, looking down at his shoes. For the first time that night, Tony was able to study the man for more than two panicked seconds. Steve had his hands shoved in his pockets, his broad as fuck shoulders hunched in over his chest in that way he did whenever he was feeling vulnerable. He was wearing a navy suit, nothing extraordinary as far as Tony can see. The weirdest part of his appearance was probably the beard. Steve looked like one of those hipster millennial dads and Tony hated that he was intrigued by the new look.
When he arrives, his bots wheel toward him eagerly, probably itching for attention. A smile tugs at the corner of Tony’s lips as DUM-E inches towards him with its claw reaching out. Tony lifts a hand to rub the metallic frame of the ill-formed robot.
“Hey, since you get to go through all my stuff, why can’t I go through your stuff?” Clint asks, crossing his arms over his chest.
“But what if this guy is the one? What if he’s supposed to be your other dad, but you’ll never know because your real dad isn’t going to meet him?” MJ speculates.
“If you apologize for having a panic attack, I will repulsor your ass so hard, Rogers,” he warned, moving his head away to look at Steve. “It was the cold, right?”
As they neared the location that the coordinates had pointed them to, Thor came and sat next to Steve where he had been restlessly sitting on the edge of one of the benches near the bay doors. Thor looked up at where Bruce had called Tony over to discuss something he had found in his readings.
Steve shot yet another weak glare at him, reaching down to scratch between Dodger’s perked up ears and sneak him an appreciatory pepperoni. “It’s been great. Turns out, moping at home is not nearly as fun as moping when you’re on the run from the government,” he said dryly, straightening back up for more pizza.
At the very bottom of the box, there’s a single piece of paper, slightly wrinkled from sitting underneath all the other things in the box and somehow surviving the move from Steve’s old house to college and now to their apartment (their apartment!).
As long as he was working, Tony could put aside the thought that they too would soon join the ranks of the previous missing SHIELD agents, except they had meant to be the last resort and he wasn’t sure there was anyone else SHIELD could send after them. If they even would.
Bruce clears his throat uncomfortably, sort of wishing he’d never asked the question in the first place.
“Surprising absolutely no one: not particularly well,” Sam said with an amused huff. Fury could be a massive control freak when it came to world safety, enough that Steve often wondered if that was why Fury and Tony never got along. They were after the same thing, but using completely different means to achieve it. Fury thought it was the very people on this planet that would bring about its downfall, while Tony had set his sights beyond Earth completely.
“Sure he would. Right, my boy?” Mr. Stone clapped Tony’s shoulder with his meaty hand, nearly sending him flying towards the old lady again. Tony pursed his lips into what he hoped turned out to be a somewhat proper looking smile on the other end, and nodded, almost sensing his parents’ expectant looks from across the room.
Once he was able to see past the hazy red smoke that filled the room, Tony found himself unable to tear his eyes away from the sheer number of writhing bodies in various states of intoxication scattered inside.
Tony began to take days off. He never stayed in bed, although he often had to fight the urge to, he would spend the day messing around with the food or building Buster 2.0, which Steve had helpfully named Arthur after they’d gone through the three seasons of the cartoon that had been included in the stack of DVDs together.
Tony had been the one to propose a series of alterations to the Accords, ones that wouldn’t limit the actions of the Avengers as long as they answered to a team of enhanced individuals that Tony and Professor Xavier were in the process of putting together. The Avengers would be able to operate independently in the event of an emergency, but would otherwise operate under the guidance of this team of both people with the X gene and other enhanced members of the community. They'd gotten rid of the Raft, and in its place designed a specialized rehabilitation program for enhanced individuals who had caused some amount of destruction with malicious intent. Along with that, a training program to ensure that these individuals would be able to properly manipulate their abilities and reduce the amount of public chaos during a mission was also in the works. These amended Accords were the ones that Steve eventually signed in order to return back to the States and have Barnes psychologically treated at home after the cryo and Shuri's deprogramming of the Winter Soldier in Wakanda.
“The calves should be the weakest areas. There’s a glitch in the coding for the boots as well, and I didn’t manage to fix it until the Mark forty-seven and this guy could not have had access to that.” Iron Man replies.
“I’m going to do whatever I can to get us out of here,” Tony assured him with a firm nod, reaching across the table to place his hand over Steve’s.
Steve looks up through the gaps of his cowl as Iron Man flies a loop around the portal before landing steadily on his feet nearby. “Bold of you to assume I won’t drag you there, kicking and screaming be damned.”
Steve leaps up onto the flailing elbow of the suit, aiming to strike the neck with his shield, hoping that it would be a weak spot. “Well, you probably know more about this that the rest of us, Iron Man. How do we take him down?” He flings his shield out, but it merely bounces off the metal producing a shower of sparks before Steve manages to snatch it out of the air. The giant suit shifts as the man inside notices Steve trying to keep his balance on top of it.

“He wanted me to make sure you didn’t try to sneak away to your lab. Something about him wanting to fall back asleep with you when he got back.”
Tony debates his options, as thoroughly as he can manage, and quickly concludes that Steve is bluffing. He has to be. There’s no way that Steve would be willing to subject himself to the ridicule and loss of dignity that would come with running around with Tony hanging from his front. There is
It's not a huge amount of time, but it still gives Tony a little more than six hours to overthink, so it's not like he's complaining all that much.
. Keeping his eyes from sliding shut is an obstacle that Tony did not consider when he decided to wake up and attempt to stop Steve from leaving. He’s already just starting and the mission is practically in shambles.
Tony lets out a growl of frustration, because he doesn’t know how to get Steve to get back into bed, and resists the urge to kick his feet or wiggle his body or bite Steve’s shoulder – all of that goes
. Mainly because he’s very much procrastinating, which is going to annoy Pepper, but also because he kept losing to Natasha so bad that his pride has taken a huge hit and he needs time to recover from that. He decides to go back to sleep just so he can have a viable excuse to tell Pepper when she asks why he didn’t get anything done today – catching up on all the sleep he’s missed this week alone is
"Well, that was just a guess," Steve chuckles, and Tony rolls his eyes. "But it's easy. You think so loud it's pretty much impossible to

He and Steve have so many differences it's ridiculous – maybe that's why they work so well together, both in a colleague and relationship partner sense. They balance each other out.
He'd known, even in the beginning, that it wouldn't work out. It never works out, not for Tony. Tony doesn't get happy endings, not like everyone else. It's like the universe is determined to make sure Tony gets bits and pieces of happiness only to have it ripped away from him.
"Friday," Tony gasps out, wanting to escape from the thoughts that threaten to pull him under the water and hold him there, "play some music. Anything that's loud."
Working past the lump in his throat, Tony manages to choke out a couple of words. "It's just weird."
, and Tony loves it. It's relaxing, especially after a long day of clinging to his last bits of self-restraint in the face of greedy businessmen and board members and the like, or after spending time fighting an Avengers-level threat as Iron Man.
"You," Tony says seriously, without missing a beat or opening his eyes, "are such a little shit. I don't know what I did to deserve you, of all the people in the world."
, and Tony can’t believe he both forgot about the man’s muscle mass and failed to account for the fact that
Tony swallows again, the lump in his throat growing bigger. There's a scar on his chest, one that's there as a result of Steve driving the shield into Tony's chest, and it starts aching as Tony says his next words. "'Cause Steve's not here. Like - normally he'd be here drawing or painting or sketching or something, and. He's not. And it's weird."
A big plus is the fact that Steve always comes back sweating, and Tony can admit that it’s the sexiest thing he’s ever seen – and he’s seen a

. He’s just Steve, and he’s a warm and soft and very lovable Steve, and Tony cannot be held responsible for anything he does while in his company.
Now, he smiles for the cameras, but without Steve or anyone else from the team there with him, they feel empty. Wrong. Different. Now, when he has to go meet with someone important when he'd rather do anything else, he doesn't have anyone to make him give genuine laughs, not that anyone would be able to tell the difference between one of his real laughs and his fake ones.
At some point, fifteen or so minutes before Steve comes back from his run, Tony goes back to his bed with the full intent of sleeping for a

Tony, in spite of all the things he can do, can't sing for shit. He doesn't know why – he just can't. His mind is always five sentences ahead of his mouth, so the words come out tangled together and they stumble over each other; his mind is also always jumping from every song he's ever listened to, so he can't stay focused for long.

Tony should probably go back to sleep, as he knows it’s most likely what Steve expects him to do, but he feels like being petty and staying up just to throw off Steve’s expectations and spite him. Because, seriously.
"What?" Tony spits out, angry even as guilt sits in his throat at the sight of Rhodey struggling to walk, even with the braces he threw himself into making. "I'm sorry, I must've heard you wrong, I thought you said –"
He doesn't go out to bring someone home – he just ignores it. That's the solution to all of his problems, he's well aware, but until another solution that actually
Eventually, with Friday being her persistent self, Tony grew a pair and voiced his fears, and, well – Here they are.
He supposes he could try to figure it out himself. He's certainly smart enough to, and he'd be able to do it without much difficulty, but he'd also probably refuse to one, recognize his problems, or two, not know how to fix said problems.
He tells Pepper. He wasn't going to, not at first, but he asked her to draw up some confidentiality agreements and stuff, and he had to tell her what they were for and. Now she knows. She, predictably, told Rhodey, so now Rhodey knows too, and he's strutting around – as best he can in his newly constructed leg braces – because he
Tony yelps when Steve pinches his side. It was a relatively soft pinch, one that Tony barely even felt, but still. It’s the principle. “Hey!”
Not for the first time, the conversation that he had with Rhodey about seeing a therapist pops up in his head, but he quickly shakes his head from side to side to stop thinking about it.
Blinking groggily, Tony pushes himself up and turns his neck from side to side to relieve the tension. Fucking Steve, leaving him on the couch.
In a way, he's kind of glad about his decision. It's a win-win situation for him. If it works, then, hopefully, Tony will be able to fix himself, and if it doesn't, then he can go about his days like he's been doing and everything will be fine.
He told Tony, repeatedly and with the utmost sincerity, that he would never hurt him. And yet, he did. Captain Rogers left Tony here to die.

She's not sure what else she can do. Keeping Tony awake is futile at this point, and all she can do is watch his vitals and wait for Vision to show up.
Because that's what happened – any mission failures and things along that line were always connected back to Tony Stark, were always the responsibility of Tony Stark and Tony Stark alone, and he just. Got tired of it. He didn't want SI to continue to suffer as a result of the Avengers.
However boring it is, Tony finds ways to distract himself. He gets Pepper to bring him paperwork to read through and sign, and he gets Rhodey to bring him Rubik's cubes and other similar puzzles to keep himself occupied. Tony also talks to Friday. After getting her to delete all recordings of the bunker – only off the main servers, though; he instructed her to keep it backed up in a secure place so he could watch it again and again when he needed something to obsess over and dissect – he didn't talk to her for a while. Mostly out of shame, but also because he was - scared.
Over the past few days, Tony's life has become one big spiral of revelations that he hoped would never prove to be true, and Tony feels like he's spiraling, too.

. Steve risked everything, broke multiple laws and forced Tony into this position, for Barnes. Tony gets it. Barnes is Steve's best friend, a friend that was presumed dead for the past 70 years. Tony would do the same thing if it was Rhodey. The issue he has with this is the way Steve is looking at Barnes, a look that Tony thought was reserved for him (Tony) and him (still Tony) alone.
He looks up at Steve in disbelief, but Steve doesn't even spare him a second glance. With no signs of regret, Steve climbs to his feet and starts to drag Barnes out of the bunker, leaving Tony behind without looking back.
"I've found the recording, Boss, but playing it would divert a substantial amount of power from the heaters. Without the heaters –"
"To go and see a therapist, yes," Rhodey responds patiently, unable to completely mask the underlying strain in his voice as he takes slow step after step. Tony opens his mouth to speak, but Rhodey continues. "You need it, Tones. I'm not going to push you if you're really against it, but. You should consider it, at the very least," he says, shooting Tony a pointed look.
After another kiss to his forehead, Steve pulls back, taking his warmth with him, and Tony doesn’t bother to hold back a whine like he normally would. He forces his eyes open again, not even sure when they closed, and sees Steve standing in front of him. He lifts an arm and reaches for Steve, who he sees hesitate as if he’s debating something.
Well, that was obviously a sign from the universe to not go to therapy, so Tony puts his phone back down on the nightstand, along with the card, and falls back into bed, landing on his stomach.
Apparently, he made a sound that was most likely supposed to represent his overall unhappiness with the situation because Steve, dressed in a tight T-shirt and running shorts, is leaning over him and pressing a kiss to his forehead.
There's been an ache in the pit of Tony's chest for a while, one that hasn't gotten any smaller. If anything, it's grown bigger, all of Tony's doubts and fears and insecurities being poured into it. Tony knows it's not
Tony closes his eyes. His voice sounds small and meek, the same way it did in the bunker, and Tony really does not want to be reminded of that right now.
Tony didn’t think it through, now that he’s actually thinking about it, because Steve, thoroughly caught off guard, lands heavily on top of him, which causes him to let out a soft, “Oof,” as the air is pressed out of his lungs.
how much the death of his parents messed him up, just like Steve knows that Tony doesn't deal with emotions well.
FRIDAY doesn't understand it, and she doesn't attempt to try to. Attempting to understand the motives of Captain Rogers is not something she wants to dwell on.
God, Tony just - really fucking loves Steve, and it's making him choke up to even think about how large that love is. About how much of that love Tony feels pouring out of him on a daily basis.
“Steve hasn’t come back yet?” he asks her, sinking back down into the couch when she shakes her head.
Tony sighs happily and wriggles in place, maybe even pressing his head against Steve's hand in his hair. He's not one to seek out physical comfort – avoids it like it's his
So, he ends up not responding, laying his head down on Steve’s shoulder while he waits for Steve to relent and climb back into bed and hold him for a few more hours.
he would’ve wanted to go back to sleep had Steve not tried to leave and then carried Tony down here, but the fact of the matter is that Tony is tired but he’s not going to give Steve – or Natasha, for that matter – the satisfaction of knowing everything he’s about to or wants to do.
to me," Pepper says after a few seconds of silence, her voice choked and broken into pieces as the look in her eyes goes from anger to hurt and helplessness.
Rhodey, apparently satisfied with Tony's answer, softens a little. "I'm just worried about you, Tones."
"Yeah, baby girl," Tony says, his voice quiet. "Probably. I don't want you to, and I wish you didn't have to but - you will."
Tony doesn’t know why he ever doubted that Steve would go through with it – Steve never says anything he isn’t willing to do; something about honesty and following through with threats – but he did, and now he has to think about what’s more important to him: staying with Steve or preserving his manly reputation.
He sees the smile on the blond man's face and rolls his eyes before closing them again. Asshole. "Yes," he huffs, feigning annoyance even though he feels anything but, "the song. Stop being an ass, you know which one I'm talking about."
different. Not in a good way, never in a good way. It was different because this time, Steve had been one of the nightmares, too.
deserve Steve – because Steve is good, and kind, and everything that Tony is not – but Steve doesn't see it that way. If anything, Steve thinks that it's the other way around and, fuck, if that doesn't mess with Tony's heart a bit.
Rhodey gives him the contact information of a highly renowned – and extremely private – therapist the next day.

The look Pepper is giving him is soft and loving and Tony's not sure he likes it all that much. He feels vulnerable, like he's just given out his greatest weakness – which he actually might have done – and he doesn't like it, so he clears his throat and stands up.
with one of those knives she can pull out at a moment’s notice, and Tony doesn’t want to risk that, either.
Not enough to make him start doing it regularly, of course not, just the thought is ridiculous, but maybe enough to make him kind of reconsider his stance on the therapy thing.
A huff of laughter leaves Steve. “Sure you’re not.” He starts attempting to remove Tony from his body, but Tony just squeezes harder and refuses to let go with a shake of his head. “Tony,” Steve warns. “I have to go on my run now. I’ll be back.”
Vis had fucked off soon after that – presumably to go with Steve or Wanda, because why should Tony have anyone at all anymore?
"Fri?" Tony questions, his voice standing out in the silence of the part of the Medbay he's staying in. His eyes are wide open as he stares at the ceiling, but he can't bring himself to close them, not with his brain running at 60 miles an hour. "You awake?"

He tells Happy to monitor the kid. Not because he doesn't want to be around Parker – using the kid's first name feels, weirdly, too intimate – but because he
Steve shifts again, a happy sound leaving him, and holds Tony a little tighter to his chest, something that makes Tony extremely happy himself.
For a hot minute – meaning for a good, long while – Tony considers going out and finding someone to have sex with. He doesn't even know why, doesn't know why he wants to go party and come back with a one-night-stand. He doesn't do that anymore. He hasn't in a long time, and he doesn't want to break his streak.
Steve is much heavier than Tony, they both know that, but Tony didn’t consider how most of that would come from sheer
The only thing that worked almost as well as working until he passed out was having Steve sing to him, and, well. That's not happening any time soon, not after what happened.
Tony scowls, waiting for a few seconds before responding. "Great, I considered it, answer's still no."
He half expects Steve to mock him, but Steve doesn’t do that because Steve is respectful and nice and not one to act like a literal four-year-old. Instead, Steve calmly replies, “Tony,” and that just serves to make Tony even more determined to never let go.
(Tony quickly shuts that line of thinking down because he can't lay here and talk about Steve like things are normal when they really aren't.)

The point is: Tony is a little scared about this, but his friends are supporting him and are showing that he's not making a huge mistake, so. Can't end too bad, can it?

him, and it's such a difference from the greedy and sexual touches Tony used to get from the endless rotation of women and sometimes men, such a difference from the echoes of Howard's firm grip on his arm and Maria's timid and shaking touch on the small of his back.
But he also doesn't want to give Rhodey the satisfaction of being right, because he's petty like that, and proving Rhodey wrong will always come before doing something that might actually help him.
But that wasn't even the big issue. The big issue was that the Avenges were allowed to freely roam and stomp and indirectly hurt people, and Tony wanted them to answer for that. Tony had already indirectly hurt thousands – maybe millions – of people while he'd been making weapons, and he hadn't been answering for that. Was it really so wrong of him to want things to be different now that he was explicitly on the right side of things?
"The time is two-forty-eight a.m., Boss." Apparently anticipating his next question, Friday continues to speak. "You told me
But Tony can't take that chance, he won't let himself have the opportunity to hurt the kid, so, no. Tony leaves the monitoring to Happy. Tony will help from afar, offer up some half-advice whenever Happy asks for it, but he'll let Happy handle the everyday things.
Looking through footage, FRIDAY watches all of Captain Rogers and Tony's interactions with one another.
But he can't say that. Because, if given the chance, he would absolutely make sure that none of it ever happened, that he never joined the stupid fucking Avengers, which makes Tony realise that Bruce was right – they
Tony wants to ask what that was supposed to be about because he can't remember, but he decides against it because he
Tony is a clingy bastard, but he’s accepted that about himself now and decides not to dwell on it any longer and hug the shit out of Steve instead.
The song starts playing and Tony can immediately feel the difference in temperature as power is taken from the heaters. Tony suspects that he would be crying if he wasn't so cold.
FRIDAY manages to send a signal to Vision as Tony's eyes slip closed, the song playing out into the room, sung in Captain Rogers' voice.
(Though, the coldness is starting to give way to numbness. Tony's not sure how much of a good thing that is.)
And that's when Tony realizes that he lied to himself: if therapy doesn't work, Tony might become even more broken then he already is.
“Sweetheart,” Steve begins, and Tony purrs at the rush of warmth that goes rocketing through him, “c’mon, it’s time to let go.”
"So, what would it take for you to stop going on your runs?" he asks, both joking and seriously wanting to know the answer.
Maybe that was the problem, though. The "right side" of things. Is there a right side to anything? Tony had been selling weapons to the US government, but his weapons had also ended up on the opposing side, and each side believed that they were in the right.
, obviously. He doesn't offer Steve any other reply than the weird huff/laugh sound his throat decided to produce, and it's okay because he doubts that Steve was looking for one, anyway.
Tony waits, waits as Steve clears his throat and settles back into the couch, and then Steve is singing and everything is
at approximately eleven-twenty-four, and there's no reason for you to be out of bed doing anything for the next three hours and twenty-two minutes."
But, yeah, if ever presented with the opportunity, Tony would make sure to not, under any circumstances, fall in love with one Steve Rogers and his particular brand of righteousness.
Tony looks up to see Natasha staring down at him. To anyone else, she’d probably look deadpan and emotionless, but Tony has grown close enough to Natasha to see the way the right corner of her mouth is slightly tilted up and the way her shoulders have lost their usual tense edge to know that she’s amused.
What's pathetic is that the only relationships with people he's managed to keep over the years, and not completely smash to pieces, are his friendships with Pepper and Rhodey – and even those bonds get tested sometimes.
Tony has tried to stay awake for as long as possible so he can pass out without issue, and it kind of works. He doesn't ever remember having a nightmare, but he always wakes up in a cold sweat with a pounding heart, and what other conclusion is there to come to?
and Tony doesn't want him to go. He scrambles for words, something that will hurt Steve or at least shock him into thinking about what he just did to Tony.
Now more than ever, Tony finds himself doubting the extent of Steve's feelings for Barnes. You don't essentially go against multiple countries of the world and become a fugitive, or leave your boyfriend to die, for heterosexual reasons. At least, not in Tony's world. There has to be some romantic feelings that Steve has for Barnes – that thought is easier to entertain then the fact that Steve was willing to become a fugitive for the sole purpose of getting away from Tony.
to have an arm slung around Tony's shoulders like it means nothing when they watch a movie together.
Tony retaliates with a pinch to Steve's side, but Steve just laughs, the sound a warm and fond thing that pushes its way into Tony's chest and curls around his heart.
Tony hates him. But, you know, hates him in a love way. Rhodey is like the brother he never had, and it makes him sort of glad that he's an only child; if he grew up with a brother like Rhodey, he's not sure he would've made it all these years. Rhodey is annoying.
Tony pulls back, his eyes half-lidded but somehow still narrowed. "Okay, seriously," Tony says, voice demanding, ignoring the way his throat clenches up because
He walks back over to his bed and sits down on the edge of it, grabbing his phone from the nightstand.
around. Rhodey comes by, and so does Pepper and Happy, and Friday is always here. But that's different. He had someone, someone who he let see all of him, all of the things he hides from everyone else, and that's gone now.
It sends warmth catapulting through Tony's chest and his stomach, and racing down his arms and legs until every inch of him feels like he's been basking in the sun. Tony supposes it's true, in a way – Steve largely represents the sun, sometimes.
there's lots and lots of time skips that aren't explicitly defined?? but that's just how i do things so.
, Tony is sure of that, and yet Steve is getting closer and closer to the elevator and is showing no signs of slowing down and Tony is definitely not freaking out right now, not even a little bit.
Natasha eyes him for a moment, and then her eyes turn back to amusement laced with a bit of smugness, too.
. He just wants to take a few weeks to himself and sit and do whatever he wants without having to face anybody. He doesn't want to live up to all of his responsibilities, he just wants to disappear for just two weeks, three at most. After that, he'll come back and work his ass off and deal with everything.
Tony hums, his eyes slipping closed as he feels all of the day's tension bleed out of his body, like Steve's hands are sucking it right out of him somehow. "Yeah. Sing. You know. The song?"
,” Tony whines, drawing out Steve’s name an unnecessarily long amount of time and feeling slightly embarrassed by the way Steve rolls his eyes.
"I'm coming to drag you out at midnight," she says as she walks towards the elevator, Tony staring after her.
wrong with Tony, so he's not all that worried. Well, he's a little worried, but everything about him is normal at this point, so he's not
He's memorized the entire thing at this point, after reading it so many times, but there's one phrase in particular that sticks out to Tony:
Tony doesn't exactly know how he ended up with Steve Rogers – and he sure as hell doesn't know how he hasn't done anything to completely ruin it – but right now, in this moment, Tony knows that he's going to try his absolute hardest to keep him.
Still. It’s too early, and Tony wants to sleep and wants Steve to stay, so. No one can blame him if he gets a little bratty about it, can they? And no one can blame him if he, using Steve’s relaxed state, tugs Steve down onto the bed to keep him there, preferably for the rest of the day.
"Of course, Boss." FRIDAY's voice is soft and sympathetic, something Tony has never heard in her before. Her answer is lacking it's usual amount of sass – had Tony not be in the pitiful state he's in, she probably would've said something along the lines of
Rhodey continues to glare, and Tony is the first to break. He looks down with a sigh. "Fine, yeah," he mumbles, "I'll think about it."
But the urge to do it is strong, stronger than it's ever been before, and Tony doesn't know how to handle it.
. What he does know is this: one second Steve is hitting him so hard he's stumbling backwards and suit systems are failing, and the next he's on the ground and a shield is being slammed into his chest and his helmet is off.
Steve, as much as Tony loves the shit out of him, obviously has a ton of faults, one of them being that he
. He's going to want to be a part of the kid's life, and he can't do that, not when there's a possibility that Tony will ruin him like he ruined the Avengers.
It always happens early in the mornings, and Tony gets the answering machine for the therapist's office each time. He's starting to think that the universe is making him have these nightmares and the want for them to stop so he'll call the therapist's office and have no one answer, just so Tony can be reminded that there's nothing he can do.
Tony waits for a minute or two, staring down at the card and the numbers that he can just barely make out in the darkness – which doesn't matter, he memorized the phone number not long after he saw the card; one of the downsides to being a person who doesn't forget numbers easily – before he starts dialing. He puts his phone up to his ear and raises his other hand to play with his bottom lip as the line rings and rings. A machine answers, saying that the office is closed, and Tony hangs up, cursing as he realizes it's only just past one in the morning.
Tony is really fucking glad that no one is around to hear him curse Steve and mornings and runs in rather colorful language.
"D'you think you could turn the heaters on?" His voice is small and scared and broken, and Tony closes his eyes in shame. FRIDAY is like Tony's daughter, and the number one Rule of Parenthood, according to Howard, is to never show weakness in front of your child. Tony can't help it, though – the
, someone who's done so many bad things in his life that he doesn't deserve to be shown any semblance of love, especially not from someone as good as Steve fucking Rogers, aka Captain America, aka the literal main focus of most of Tony's teenage fantasies. Sometimes, Tony finds himself thinking that Steve and the universe are playing one big prank on him, however stupid and silly that idea might be.
A week after he's released from the hospital and taken off of bed rest, Rhodey tells him to see a therapist.
Natasha sees the moment Tony sinks back into the couch and smirks, knowing she’s had her victory. She sits down next to Tony, bringing her legs up to sit criss-cross. Tony has half a mind to tell her to keep her feet off his couch, but then she’d do something scary like - Tony doesn’t know,
Really, on days like this the only thing he can do is lay down in the dark and hope that sleep will consume him, that the pain in his head won’t be so much that he can’t doze off. It’s easier when he’s not alone, though, but he hadn't wanted to bother Steve.
So far though, none of those things had happened, and more often than not, Steve sat in the kitchen alone, with his tea and his books and his thoughts.
“Can we go back to you being happy to see me?” Steve asks, wrapping his arms around Tony’s waist. “I missed you today,” he murmurs into Tony’s neck. He keeps his face buried there for a long minute, and Tony lets himself enjoy the closeness, this rare moment of PDA that Steve’s allowing himself, and hugs him back tightly.
“Good,” Tony sighs into him, still holding him tight, and Steve can’t help but nod his agreement. Good.
But he’s quiet too long, and Tony sits down beside him, close enough that their shoulders touch, and Steve can hear the soft in and out of Tony’s breath. In any other situation, it would be nice.
Now he knows what triggers them, tries to avoid red wine, certain cheeses, and chocolate if he can help it. Some things, like the weather, the air pressure, are, obviously, impossible to control, which is how Tony ends up here, in bed in the middle of the day, cursing the sun and the weather and everything in between as his head throbs in a way that immobilizes him.
Or, well, that’s mostly true. Steve would be glad for any company he might find, but if he's being honest with himself, which, in this midnight silence, he is, he wants it to be Tony who finds him.
It’s harder, too, because he hates the dark, hates being alone for these long silent stretches of time, and finds himself wishing, most nights, that someone would find him out here, discover his well-kept secret and just... sit with him.
“You were gone entirely too long, Steven. I’m going to have to stand here like this for at least twenty-four hours,” Tony warns him. “Hope you didn’t make any plans.”
“Yep,” Tony nods. “Or do you prefer red, white, and blue stars, more on brand…” He contemplates, then tightens his hold on Steve, like he’s trying to eliminate even the tiniest fraction of space between them.
He’d only been sitting there for a few minutes, still trying to relax enough to move, to clean up, to carry himself back to bed, when he hears it. Footsteps first, then—
Tonight, Steve had actually managed to sleep for a few hours before waking up in a sweat, gasping for breath. His mind raced as he tried to get a grip on the nightmare that was already fading. He’d tugged on a sweatshirt over his t-shirt and made his way to the kitchen, ready to settle into his all too familiar routine.
Now, the kettle is boiling and Steve’s reaching for the tin of tea leaves when he realizes he’s left his book in his room. The thought is enough to distract him, and he misses the container of tea by an inch, sending it careening onto the floor with a crash, coating the tile in a fine layer of leaves. It hadn’t looked like very much in the tin, but spread out all over the kitchen, the mess overwhelmed him.
Tony nods. “Sorry,” he says. Steve watches as he makes a careful pile of the tea beside him, raking them up with a finger. “When I got back after Afghanistan, it was months before I could sleep,” he continues. “I built so many unnecessary mods to the suit that I thought Pepper was going to kill me. I mean, I fell asleep in a board meeting before I could admit something was wrong.”
“I just figured you got up at the crack of dawn,” Tony continues, nudging Steve gently, “for your run and your five dozen eggs…”
“Thanks,” Tony manages to mutter as Steve threads his fingers through Tony’s hair, soothing him enough to finally sleep.
Steve stares. Deep down, he’d known Tony was a night owl for a reason, but he’d never heard him talk about it.
It’s nothing new, not really, but knowing what it is doesn’t necessarily make it any better. Tony had gotten his first migraine while he was at MIT. Not incredibly young, but still, it had thrown him for a loop back then, the sudden inability to see or think clearly followed by the pulsing, painful headache that lasted nearly two full days.
They settle on an action movie they’ve both seen before, and Steve feels his eyes getting heavy almost as soon as they sit down. Tony is still sitting close to him, closer than he usually does, Steve notes, but he doesn’t let himself dwell on it. The cracked feeling in his chest feels infinitesimally smaller just now, and he doesn’t want to ruin it.
He isn’t coping entirely well. He isn’t drinking, though, and he counts that as a win in and of itself.
“Yeah, well. Still.” Tony gives him a look so full of worry and sorrow and something else Steve can’t name, that he almost misses it when Tony reaches out and takes Steve’s hand in his, squeezing tightly.
“I…” It would be so easy to say yes. To pretend, like he’s gotten so used to doing, that everything is fine, that he’s
Steve shrugs, smiling at him in the mirror. “Just because. Saying good morning.” He shrugs again as his smile widens, and Tony shakes his head.
Steve lifts his shirt over his head and tugs at Tony’s own shirt. “I have a solution,” Steve says, turning the shower on and pulling Tony along with him, laughing as they stumble into the running water.
. When he’s alone in the dark, he doesn’t have to be Captain America, or the leader of the Avengers. He doesn’t have to be anyone’s particular version of himself, and it’s nice. Quiet.
“Mmm. Did Erskine ever mention you being part koala? I have a theory,” Tony says, setting down a spoon and turning in Steve’s arms.
“That’s awful,” Steve says, because he knows exactly how lonely it is, sitting up night after night, the hours passing like small infinities before you. The splintered feeling in his chest deepens.
Peter waves goodbye to his father and follows MJ further into the house, listening to the low sounds of his dad hurriedly talking to MJ’s mom about emergency contacts and other important things. MJ flops down next to the low coffee table with a bowl of half-finished popcorn and shoves her hand inside to grab at some. There’s a movie that’s been paused on the TV, probably when MJ and her mom had gotten up to let Peter and his dad in.
Tony looks up at him, surprised. No one’s ever asked him to play with them before. He’s nodding before he thinks about it too much, and he’s smiling for the first time since he got to school when the boy smiles wide with all his teeth showing.
When Tony saw her partner, he really felt as if he was witnessing the Second Coming. The guy wasn’t so much leading the woman as he was playing with her, every push answered with an equal pull like a turbulent tied, as they spun circles around each other without managing to topple over somehow. His black shirt was loose and unbuttoned down to the middle of his chest, the rest of it tucked into the waistband of his tight black pants. A few blond locks had started to curl into his forehead from where his golden hair had been neatly pushed back with some pomade. His steps mirrored the erratic beat of Tony’s heart as he watched the two dancers battle it out in each other’s arms.
"Can you sing for me?" he asks, his voice rough as he throws himself onto the couch in the penthouse, landing on his stomach with his head ending up in Steve's lap and his hands down by his sides.
The letter from Steve does two things: one, it reminds Tony that he'll never be good enough, that there's always going to be someone better. Tony will never be
Tony loves Steve. He does, even now, when Steve has done so much to hurt him, whether it was on purpose or not. He still loves the man that took his world by storm and gave him everything he thought he would never have. He
Seriously, at this rate, one would end up thinking that Tony never sleeps. Which. He doesn’t. But that’s
Tony turns to anger. His anger over his parents murder is easier to process than the other emotions concerning Steve, and he lunges.

Tony huffs – but it sounds pretty similar to a laugh – and shakes his head as best he can, shifting closer to Steve. For
He's still a little freaked out by the fact that he's actually doing this, but he figures he can try going once, have his doubts about the practice confirmed, and then get on with his life.
, despite having people he trusts coddling him and making sure he's alright and people who love him, and it's a terrible feeling.
His eyes don't open and he's already shoving himself against Steve's side, contently sighing when Steve turns on his side and pulls him closer, making it so their chests are pressed against each other's and Steve's face is buried in Tony's neck. There's just something comforting about being pressed up against Steve, and Tony can say he does it for warmth all he wants – the fact of the matter is that Tony likes it, and that's all there is to say. Or not say. Honestly, Tony lost track of all the things he can or cannot admit to a long time ago and he doesn't feel rested enough to even
The nightmares about Steve don't stop. They're always about the same thing, with some variation, but they
A grin grows on Tony's face because he knows that Pepper will most definitely do that. That's what he loves about Pepper – she doesn't take any of his bullshit and she calls him out on just about everything he does, and she
For a second, Tony hopes. The hope that Steve didn't know rushes through him, too powerful to stop. If Steve didn't know about the role Barnes had in killing his parents, they can fix this. They can get Barnes help, and Tony can keep Ross off their backs for as long as he can, and Tony and Steve can go back to cuddling on couches and waking each other up with kisses.
Tony considers the threat. Natasha, unlike Steve, is a bluffer – it’s probably a requirement of her job and a big part of her skill set – but that doesn’t mean that Tony can tell her bluffs apart from things she’ll actually do. He ends up grumbling underneath his breath as he gives in, but only because Thor is one heavy guy, and Tony doesn’t want to risk all of that weight on his chest.
Steve, to his credit, doesn't seem to be bothered by the fact that Tony's head almost landed on his favorite book, he just sets it aside, somewhere that Tony can't be bothered to look. He threads one hand through Tony's hair and rests the other on Tony's lower back. "Sing?" he questions quietly, his hand softly untangling the strands of Tony's hair in a slow manner that is just -
Steve is more than well-versed in all things Tony. He knows that Tony will make jokes that sound rude but are really backhanded insults to himself, he knows that, and he takes it in stride. Tony really
He wishes he had seen it earlier. He wishes that he had seen what, looking back, he can now see clearly. He can see the way Steve started shying away from Tony's touches, the way Steve stopped initiating contact, the way Steve started fidgeting any time he was left alone in a room with Tony. He can see how Steve started emotionally pulling away, how Steve had started looking
, not when Tony is hurt and Rhodey will never walk again and his heart feels like it's shredded in his chest and there's a teenager out in Queens – a teenager that never should've been involved – nursing various injuries and everything is a disaster.
Apparently, Natasha is not having any more of this bullshit tonight, because she storms up to Clint her kitten adorned silk pajamas that strangely make her look more frightening. Tonys hisses (quietly) in sympathy as she grabs Clint by the elbow, and drags him up off the couch.
“Mmm, you’re always so very warm. How are you so warm?” Tony mumbles probably half to himself. He blindly sets his mug at the edge of the counter, and Steve abruptly reaches out to push it back further onto the counter.
Steve sits down at the cockpit, far enough away from Stark, but not so far that he was completely out of Steve’s sight either. As they prepare to take off, Steve finds his thoughts gravitating back to Tony Stark. What starts off as a genuine curiosity at how he managed to not only escape his captors but also leave them rendered useless, soon turns into an in depth analysation of their earlier exchange.
Tony turns to ask the blonde boy who’s sitting at the desk next to him. His name card is already peeling off his shirt and Tony thinks he can make out some of his name. S….T...E…. He can’t see the rest. Tony hopes his name is Stella, because Jarvis had read him a story about a bat named Stellaluna and he thinks it’s the best name that he’s ever heard. His Dad would probably say that boys can’t be named Stella because it’s a girl's name, but Tony thinks anyone can have a pretty name.
Tony attempts to return his attention to his schematic, but his thoughts don’t seem to have gotten the memo. His mind takes him back to that night on the freeway, listening to the man who had lost so much, who refused to let it impact his ability to be a good father to his child.
Tony pulls away a little, blinking up at Steve with bleary eyes that somehow still manage to pull of sultry on top of that. “Wanna take this party away from the crazies?”
“I was taking a walk. What’s going on up there?” Tony pointed up at the house, watching with a raised eyebrow as one of the watermelons nearly flopped right out of Bucky’s grasp.
“We’re not going to end up cleaning this up before we leave, are we?” She asked, a hint of amusement creeping into her voice as she looked down at the greasy wrappers scattered all over the table. Their collective inability to pick up after themselves wasn’t what she was here to talk about though, and they both were well aware of it.
“Oh, you didn’t know? I use my senior discount at the movies. Buck says I’m taking advantage of the system, but what’s ten bucks gonna cost a giant corporation I couldn’t give less of a shit about?” Steve replied, wiggling his toes where they stuck out of the blanket along with most of his legs past his knees.
Steve chuckled at the memory, looking up from the case with one of those half smiles that Tony had nearly decided to science because they would consistently make his stomach swoop up into his chest in a way that was very much not a normal bodily sensation. This time was no different.
Steve had led the team in coming up with a plan, even though there was nothing that he disliked more than following a plan. He knew that for a mission like this one, they were going to have to reel in each of their well-practiced reckless tendencies in order to make it out of this with the missing agents and residents of the town, and having found out the source of the anomalies. On top of that fairly ambitious objective, they were meant to come out of this preferably alive.
They knew that the team would have to split up, like the first crew had done, in order to investigate the town and the area where the previous two teams had received as the original source of the anomalies that SHIELD had registered within their systems. One advantage that the Avengers had that neither of the two previous teams hadn’t, was that more than half of them were enhanced in some way. They’d decided that the non-enhanced would be partnered with an enhanced team member so that they would each have a better chance when they inevitably came into contact with whatever had caused members of both of the previous teams to virtually disappear.
He quietly strips down to his boxers and reaches for one of Steve’s shirts he had lately taken to wearing to sleep when it got chilly. Tony slips into bed, pressing quick kisses to Steve’s bare shoulders as he pulls the sheets over them both.
Dodger trotted up to Steve's feet as soon as he stepped out of his bedroom to receive his morning kisses, and let himself be attached to the leash, his tongue lolling out as he patiently waited for Steve to get him clipped and harnessed.
“My dad thinks it’s ridiculous to go all the way to New York to meet a stranger,” Peter laments, fingering the corner of his cards anxiously.
“What do we need to do,” Steve questioned, the firm line of his mouth betraying his displeasure at how SHIELD had handled the issue, but Tony knew he wasn’t at all surprised with the outcome of events.
Thor places his phone back onto the table, and turns on his side, reaching down to lift up the soft fleece duvet over himself. He had just shut his eyes for perhaps five precious minutes, when he hears it.
He knew when he got back there would be about a hundred and seventy four messages from Pepper demanding to know where he was, not to mentioned the disappointed emails from Fury no doubt chastising him for making the Avengers come after him when he could’ve escaped himself with the Iron Man armour. To be fair, Tony did make use of the armour to get away, but he hadn’t been able to get out of the warehouse before the Avengers came storming in all high and mighty. So, technically it was SHIELD’s fault in the first place for sending their shiniest to get him.
“I didn’t even try,” he replied, his voice muffled as he spoke to the table rather than Tony. “I was cold.” He didn’t elaborate but Tony still understood all the things that meant. The bed was too empty, too wide. The alarm clock wasn’t right, there was no fire. Tony didn’t want to think about trying to fall asleep alone.
The diner had yielded similar results, however, there had been plates full of half-eaten food on every table. Some of the food had been fresh, with Rachel commenting on an arrangement of a singular pancake with a few pieces of bacon next to it that had somehow retained their greasy sheen, and upon closer inspection, having wispy curls of steam coming off of them. Other plates had pieces of orange slices that had begun to grow fur, or cups of coffee with a layer of film over their once-liquid brown surfaces.
Bucky frowned, readjusting his grip on the watermelon, stacking one precariously on top of the other two. Tony kind of hoped one would just—fall out onto the ground. “No guests allowed bud. House rules.”
“And next, we have a very special phone call from Peter Parker, a seven year old boy from Seattle,” the host says, her tone obviously coloured with ill-concealed surprise. Intrigued, Tony reaches forward to turn up the volume.
“Oh, hey Brucie bear. Are we still going up to see the showers later?” Tony asks as Bruce moves hesitantly to retrieve his coffee.
He gets a soft snore as his answer. Peter’s fast asleep, his nose still tucked against his toy and his head resting against Steve’s hand. Grinning to himself, Steve swoops down to press a kiss to his son’s forehead before very gingerly lifting his body off the mattress. The bed shifts suspiciously when he gets off and he thrusts both hands out, as if cursing it to stillness. Thankfully, Peter merely stirs in his sleep, but doesn’t awaken.
On the sixth day, Tony was heading into the bedroom to sleep, because Steve, being the big self-sacrificing idiot that he was, had insisted upon sleeping on the couch that at least a quarter of his body hung off of, for the duration of their stay.    Tony aggressively hoped for the sake of SHIELD’s chiropractors that they would get out of here before the damage done to Steve’s back became too much for even the supersoldier serum to fix.
Thor smiles widely as he removes his face from the open cupboard, pointing at Steve’s face enthusiastically. “Yes! The delightful little things. Do we have any?”
The Black Widow leaps nimbly off the back of the bot and crouches down on her haunches in front of the portal. She glances up at Steve through her black mask, red lips twisted into a sly smirk. “Enough chatter, boys. Let’s work on getting rid of this thing so I can get back to my unopened bottle of Chardonnay.”
