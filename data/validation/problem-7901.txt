“Okay, now where were we?” He comes up to Steve and pulls out a little flashlight from the pocket of his lab coat. “Say ‘ah,’ please.”
“You didn’t have to do that,” Tony said, but then he winked. “Not that I don’t appreciate the results. But you look gorgeous, whatever you’re wearing, and I’d much rather have you here as soon as possible than wait while you put on clothes I’m just going to take off a minute later.”
“You can’t
“Tony,” Steve said, his tone already containing a note of pleading, and Tony smiled harder, showing teeth.
He listened as Tony take a deep breath, then another. “Clean this place up,” Tony said levelly. “You can come upstairs when you’re done.”
Annnnnnd he’d spoken too soon.
“Put your hands behind your back,” he says, and Steve obeys easily, just like he always does.
He couldn’t do it. Watch Tony be tortured in front of him? He’d go insane.
I am just so amazed by the response from you guys, and you really have no idea how much it means to me. Seriously, I just floated around for days, all swoony with feelings. Thank you.
He doesn’t think Steve actually wants more inside of him, although maybe he’s wrong. Maybe Steve wants as much as he can get.
,” Tony said, and the look on his face made Steve want to cringe.
He nearly jumped out of his skin when Tony clapped his hands suddenly.
“Tony?” Steve said after a while, and Tony blinked back the half-daze he’d fallen into. He’d actually started resting his chin on Steve’s shoulder, but damn, Steve felt amazing.
Steve has a moment to absorb the fact that there’s nowhere left to hide, and then the sheet, which Steve has managed to keep dry by some miracle up until this point, is clinging like a second skin to his buttocks, and the scent of his slick gets so strong that it pours out from around the drape and
“What?”
to be stretched. He wants to feel every last moment of Tony breaking him open.
He wonders sometimes what it is about Steve that attracts him so much.  He’s not exactly Tony’s usual type after all.  He’s a good man, but Tony’s met a lot—well, he’s met good men before.  He’s handsome, but Tony’s slept with models and movie stars, and they’ve never moved him the way Steve does.
“You okay, Steve? You feel really tense,” Dr. Stark says, pulling out slightly before pressing back in, deeper this time, and Steve sucks in a hissing breath and grabs onto the blankets for something to hold onto, his ass clenching down like he can keep Dr. Stark out. He can’t, not like this. He doesn’t even want to, no matter how intense the stretch is. He doesn’t remember thinking Dr. Stark had exceptionally thick fingers, but he must because it feels like Dr. Stark skipped one finger and went straight to two or even three.
Tony stumbled, nearly falling over his own feet, because even though JARVIS had warned him, he hadn’t been prepared for the sight of Steve so humbled and low.
“Start with your fingers,” Tony said, resting his elbows on his knees and leaning forward, hiding the lower part of his face behind his clasped hands.
“Wow,” Tony says afterward. Even with spacing out, Steve’s at the top of the scoreboard. By a lot.
Nonetheless, Steve wanted to look his best for Tony if they were going to . . .
“Then,” Steve said, taking a deep breath, and Tony found himself matching it, “I want you to punish me.”
like him?
“At ease, Soldier!” Fury said, and Steve sort of rocked back, his mouth settling into a mulish line.  Even with the mixed feelings, Tony enjoyed the sight a little more than he probably should have, but what the hell.  He was only human.
I wrote this...a year ago? two years ago? idk...on tumblr, and I haven't finished it, soooo it gets sent here. >_>
“I hope you don’t mind,” he says, sending a silent apology to his mother, who would be appalled to know he was planning on abandoning a first-time guest to his own devices, “but I’d like to shower—”
Tony. That was Tony outside Steve’s door. And he sounded pissed.
“Maybe I should have you tell me about them.” Tony turned his fingers back down and dragged them up Steve’s chest as the muscles in his torso went rigid, painted now with trails of moisture.
“I don’t think naughty boys get presents,” Steve said, wondering how his life had come to the point that he sounded like a character out of one of those porn movies Tony liked so much.
Also, guys, this is now my most kudos'd fic! \\\o/// *does happy dances all over the place, humping everything*
Steve
“Not now, DUM-E,” Tony said, brushing the plate away.
you? Do you think I’d ever want that?”
Because he had been careless with Tony.
“Then
The memory of lipstick smudged against Tony’s collar flashed through his mind, making Steve feel cold for the first time since he’d taken off his clothes.
“None of that excuses me ignoring you, though,” he said, leather creaking under his grip, keeping his eyes down. Tony had spent the whole conversation avoiding looking at him, but now that Steve had his attention, Steve couldn’t face him. “No one’s worried about me like that for a long time, and I didn’t think about what you’d be going through. I just—I didn’t
Steve didn’t feel right going into too much detail, even if he knew it was entirely possible Tony could hack into SHIELD’s databases and find out for himself. He shared the bits and pieces he could, however, as Tony finished the sandwiches in rapid succession, only slowing down near the end of last one when he started listing gently to the side.
Talk shop? Next time? Steve searches his eyes for mockery or condemnation, but they’re just filled with warmth instead, and it’s all Steve can do not to throw his arms around Tony and hold on for dear life. He can’t believe he’s this lucky, that Tony doesn’t mind they just had to sneak out of a coffee shop because Steve has slick drying on this thighs, and he doesn’t want to question his good fortune, but he can’t help but ask plaintively, “How can you even
Steve gets the mental image of that same tongue enthusiastically eating him out, and then a moment later, there’s the sound of liquid dripping onto something metallic. It takes him a second to figure it out, but when he does, he slams his thighs shut as much as he’s able to with his feet still in the stirrups and sits up, crying, “Oh crap, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry!” because he’s making so much slick that he’s leaking onto the step beneath him.
He waits until Dr. Stark is safely behind the drape before bringing up both hands to cover his face. This is his friends and family’s fault, he decides, because how could they have ever thought it was a good idea to let him be an adult? If they truly loved him like they claimed, they’d keep him locked in his apartment and never give him the opportunity to embarrass himself like this again.
“I couldn’t even do that much, I couldn’t—”
Tony did finally end up sleeping when they were an hour into the flight, slumping down in his chair even though he’d told Steve the seats reclined to a completely horizontal position.  Steve tried to focus on the book he’d brought, but it wasn’t long before he was turning his seat toward him and watching, taking it all in.
What did Tony want? He really . . . he really wanted to know.
“Mr. Stark,” someone said. Steve’s eyebrows went up. That sounded a lot like—
But all he did was smile gently and say, “Thank you,” and it was far from everything he wanted to say or do to show his gratitude for Steve’s submission, but it was all they had the time for, his hands skimming over Steve’s arms, his neck, cupping his jaw as Steve got into place.
When Tony had thought about kissing Steve, and he had, many times, it’d been with a certain detachment, because his focus had always been on Steve, the noises he’d make, the reactions Tony would elicit, his fingers and lips moving over Steve with the mastery of a virtuoso with a violin and bow.
“You say that like I’ve got a choice.”
"And that’s another thing!  I've heard about these,” he says darkly, because for all that he’s a
It was what they
Steve knew that he needed to hurry, but he still hesitated and then leaned down to kiss Tony, once, then twice, wishing for impossible things, before donning the mantle of responsibility.

ETA 6/22/17: Okay, guys, so I was hoping to add one more chapter this week, but it's not going to happen after all. I had to work on my SuperBatBigBang, which I just posted, and I go on vacation next week and won't be around for a couple of weeks. So please be patient with me, and I'll get back to Nostalgia as soon as I get back.
He puttered around the apartment for a while before going to the pool to swim. If Tony happened to come up, he didn’t want to be sweaty, and there was nothing wrong really with reminding Tony of what he looked like half-naked.
“Oh, fuck you too. Get out!”
What if Subs hadn’t left their Dom’s in Steve’s day, and all of this was Steve’s way of trying to force Tony to break things off?
!  I’m spending it on
As if he were a skittish animal that needed calming, Steve thought dully. Or a feral one that would attack at the first opportunity.
Maybe it was too much to ask for, maybe he was sabotaging himself so the knife would sink that much deeper later on, but then, he’d always been the king of bad decisions.
And there are many things that Tony likes about Steve, how passionate he is about everything, his sincerity, his body—
“No, I mean, he might not have responded yet, but if he weren’t interested at all, he’d say something.”
“Tony, you can’t leave a Sub—
“When do I
“Great!”  Tony sprang to his feet.  “You won’t regret this, Steve, you’ll see!”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony laughed.  "Think of it as just one more first time that we got to experience together.  Besides, they didn’t really kick us out, just suggested that if we were finished shopping that we should enjoy the beautiful day outside.”
Like me, Steve thinks and watches his character die on screen again for the third time without killing anyone. His K/D ratio is going all to hell.
Steve finds himself shifting in his chair, his boxer briefs sticking to him a lot more than they were a minute ago—
most of the time. At least, not since he started seeing Dr. Stark.
“So,” Tony says.  He stares at the flowers in Steve’s hand, at the clothes he’s wearing that have spent more time on the floor of his house than on Steve whenever he’s come over, and he doesn’t know what any of it means.
“Steve? Is that okay?”
“Why are you wearing earplugs?” Steve asked in disbelief.
“Oh, Steve,” Tony said, smiling as he slid two fingers into him effortlessly.  “You can take whatever I can dish out and more.”
that,” Steve said, desperately trying not to think about how it’d felt to almost literally hang off of Tony’s cock. He’d never experienced anything like it, not even close, but he didn’t think he could handle getting hard again, and he knew that if he let himself, he would.
“Just like last time, you won’t be able to speak, but you can make appropriate noises, so you can bark, or whine, or whimper, and I would encourage you to do so in order to communicate.”
Life really only came back into focus once they were finally back at SHIELD, Natasha and Clint leading the way in order to avoid reporters, and the quiet moments of savoring a job well done got lost under the barrage of questions as soon as they walked into the building. Where had they been? What had they been doing? Had they come across any living Chitauri? Was anyone hurt?
Steve couldn’t seem to stop staring at Tony, no matter how many times he told himself to turn away. They weren’t contracted anymore? Tony wasn’t—he wasn’t his Dom?
Bucky.
as he stroked down Steve’s back.
“Sure,” he says, and as he gets closer, Tony makes out the “Steve” on the nametag. “This way.”
They’d barely stepped into the penthouse when Tony turned towards him, ready at last to reveal whatever he’d been gearing up for.
by all of it, like he’d never thought anyone would do this for him before, or like he’d just hadn’t realized how good it could feel, and Tony—
Still, it wasn’t as if he hadn’t masturbated in front of Tony before. Of course, it’d always been a way to tease Steve, to make him want Tony all that much more. Steve had never actually come from it in front of Tony, or from ever using a sex toy. The only time he’d ever orgasmed without a hand on his cock had been with Tony. Five days ago. Before everything with Insight had happened.
“Well, I don’t know if they’d do that either, but they’d certainly hope,” Tony said, laughing.  “Come on, Steve, you’re like a mother’s wet dream, polite, handsome, sincere.  Any girl—or guy—would be lucky to take you home to the family.”
“I’m—I’m fine,” he says, his back arching and toes curling in the stirrups, and he tries to relax as much as he can. Even with all the slick he’s producing and how aroused he’s been, the penetration burns, and he doesn’t get how one finger could be so uncomfortable when it usually just feels good.
“What just happened?” Steve asks as he stares at the black kitten sitting in the spot where Tony used to be, the armor lying in pieces around it.  SHIELD agents are running around, shouting about where Loki just disappeared to, but he has more important things to worry about.
to do anything.” Tony’s jaw clenched as he glared at the monitor, the only thing keeping him from exploding the knowledge that for all of his anger at Fury, Tony was the one who should’ve stopped things before they got out of hand. “Is this how all military Subs are treated?”
Steve writes in a last ditch effort to get Bucky to stop.
“It is,” she assured him. “But since it’s your first time in after being contracted, the doctor thought it’d be a good idea to check for any scarring or tearing.”
“Yes,” Steve said, testing the net one more time. There wasn’t as much flex as he’d first thought. He wondered how long it’d take for him to get free.
He can’t, is the answer, and Steve notices the hot line of slick sliding down his thigh as they walk, feels the towel rub against what has to be his blatantly obvious erection with every step, but it’s like he doesn’t care at this point. The whole situation is designed to make him wetter than he’s ever been, and for once, he doesn’t have to fight. He can just give in. Which is such an overwhelming thought that he ends up letting Tony take some of his weight, even though he knows he shouldn’t; he’s taller than Tony and probably outweighs him by over forty pounds.
“I was thinking a little closer,” Tony said, patting his thigh, and Steve eyed him dubiously, because he couldn’t be implying what Steve thought he was implying.
He’d already let almost a year go by without Tony in his life, though. He knew could do it, but as far as wanting to—
Steve knew he could reach back and guide Tony in, but it felt more daunting to touch Tony’s cock with his hand than to let him fuck him. He couldn’t even say why, but it was stupid, whatever the reason, and he could use the opportunity to lube Tony’s cock, which he’d forgotten to do.
He debated calling Tony on the way to New Jersey with one of the many burner phones they’d gotten. Even though he and Tony weren’t contracted, he knew that SHIELD would put Tony on surveillance and bring him in for questioning since they were living together. As much as Steve wanted to talk to him, It’d be better for Tony if he didn’t know any of Steve’s plans and could truthfully claim he had no idea what was going on. Tony wouldn’t like it … but it was better for him to be as far from Steve right now as possible.
“If you have a second, I was—”
“What?” Steve says again, and he might actually be more confused now than he’d been a second ago.  He
It didn’t really matter for what Tony had planned, but it would be interesting to know.
Steve rubbed his thumb against the edge of his shield, back and forth, back and forth.
I am sitting here, writing this letter to you by candlelight, one small candle shared by the three of us in the tent with the light barely enough to see by, and it makes me think how annoying something like this must be for you.  There are so many things we’ve lost since the First, but the lack of reliable electricity probably bothers you the most.
that was looming over their heads, and as soon as Tony gave it to him, it’d be the beginning of the end.
“You’re trying to make it sound dirty.”
“What about him?”
“As in full-on sex?” Clint said, gesturing in a way that made it very clear what he was referring to. “Or like, holding a pillow and letting Tony hump it. What?” he said when everyone looked at him. “It’s a valid question!”
Steve didn’t know about JARVIS, had interrupted Tony before he could announce his presence. Steve wouldn’t realize there were cameras in every room, although Tony only ever accessed the public ones. Steve had believed in the privacy that Tony’s departure had offered, and Tony felt guilt writhe through him that he had somehow broken a trust that wasn’t even there.
Not that he wasn’t red, because he was, but at least he didn’t feel like he was having a heat stroke.
*DIES*
interested, asked questions because he wanted to know the answers.  He didn’t flirt unless he meant it.  And even if he
Tony runs his hands down the sides of Steve’s legs when the muscles start jumping, over and over again, presses his tongue even deeper into Steve to stifle the urge to smile.
“Maybe he’s finally coming around.”
“So you said you need to come once a day,” Tony said, arching an eyebrow. “Just once?”
Tony started snickering, which wasn’t encouraging at all actually.  “Don’t worry, Steve, we’re only going to be there one night.  I’ll protect you from those big, scary workaholics. Ooh, speaking of which, you know they’re going to want to grill you.”
—that Steve needs is to leave here feeling unwanted. And if his first Dom won’t touch him or teach him, then how else is he going to feel?”
?” Happy asked, looking ready to hold him still so Pepper could beat on him further.
Steve would be lying if he says their first date is an unmitigated disaster.
He glanced at the clock. Just a little past seven. It felt like so much later, but then, the whole day had crawled by, and he thought it was going to pass that much slower waiting for Stark to come back.
It was another reason to hate it there, however, although he reluctantly had to give Stark credit for revealing the cameras to him. Since Steve had already given written permission that he could be watched, it’d only been Stark’s sense of decency that had led to the admission. He wondered if all of Stark’s guests were told or only the ones that were going to live with him for any period of time. He was also curious as to why Stark had them at all—but then, Stark had already had attempts on his life. Steve remembered reading about his time in Afghanistan and then near-death at the hands of his business partner, and that had been before he came out as Iron Man and made himself a target. Maybe for Stark, the cameras were a necessary evil.
“You’re . . . you’re Captain America,” gasped Dr. Martin when he walked inside, but she looked more frightened to see him than relieved.
It garnered a quick laugh out of Steve, although he didn’t say anything in response. He did, however, tilt his hips up so his buttocks came to rest perfectly in Tony’s palms, and that was—wow.
he ever done anything for Tony, he wondered, trying to think, his mind stuttering as he struggled to remember something beyond occasionally putting together a meal, which as much about taking care of himself as taking care of Tony. Surely, he’d done—
It’s poor consolation to realize that even if he had managed to keep the noises in, the way his come hits the drape, the shaking of his legs, and the accompanying rattling of the stirrups would’ve given him completely away.
“So what made you decide to become a doctor, Tony?” Steve asks, throwing the question out there in desperation to move the attention away from him, and it’s not until it’s out of his mouth that he really thinks about what he’s just done. Asking about someone’s professions wouldn’t normally be a bad thing. Except for the fact that Steve gets off on Tony’s job, and talking about it probably isn’t the best idea he’s ever had considering he’s trying to not think about anything too exciting.
“Neither does lying here on the ground with you pinning me down, because you’re stronger than I am. I don’t stop being who I am when I choose to submit to someone else, because that’s what my submission is: a choice,” he said, tightening his grip enough that Steve finally had to look up into his eyes. “You being able to force me to the ground doesn’t mean that I submit, and it sure as hell doesn’t mean—”
He turns around expecting Tony to pull him into a kiss—but Tony’s actually a few feet away, looking at some of the photographs on the wall, and that’s … okay. Steve supposes. It’s not like he’s in heat, so there’s no rush.
He couldn’t think of any other reason Tony would ask him to go to his bedroom—although his imagination was suddenly coming up with all sorts of implausible scenarios—but no. After last night, it definitely had to be about sex.
But it was boring.  Fucking
,” Tony snapped, anger filling his voice at the way he was being treated, because maybe he wasn’t the knight in shining armor in this story, but he sure as hell wasn’t the villain either.
“You like that?” Tony asked, pulling back out in order to do it again. “Yeah, of course you do,” he said, satisfaction heavy in his voice. He didn’t mean to sound quite so smug, but Steve’s shivered in response, and oh yeah, Tony could work with that.
-----
He glanced at the worktable, but it was a mess of wires and circuitry that he couldn’t make head or tails of. He’d gotten used to a lot of modern technology, but he didn’t know how much or really any of it worked, and he doubted that Tony’s table was the place for a beginner to try and learn by himself.
But Tony just lays them on the edge of the table so the water stops dripping off.
“True, but if part of the terms were that you lived with Mr. Stark, but then you went your separate ways after—”
What if …?
Steve can’t help taking a quick peek at Tony’s body since they’re talking about it, and although he can’t see everything, from what he can tell, Tony has nothing to be ashamed about.
Although it’s not his tentacles which shove and bully their way inside of Steve, but his hectocotyli, one right after the other, and Tony doesn’t understand what Steve shouts then, the words in his own tongue rather than English, but he clings to Tony’s neck and does more of that rolling of his hips, and there’s a burst of flavor around the tentacle in Steve’s cock that Tony would do anything to get more of.
“So no aftereffects?” Dr. Strange asked Tony, his image projected into the air a few feet away.
He opened his mouth to say something, but . . . he really didn’t know how to respond to that.  It made so much Tony-sense that Steve couldn’t even berate him.
to reproduce," or "shareholders don't like to see Alphas unmarried—too potentially volatile for the company," or
have fallen in love with Tony. He’d always demanded Steve’s attention whenever they’d been in a room together and even when they hadn’t, Steve’s thoughts following after him long after he was gone. Truthfully, Steve had had to put an artificial distance between the two of them more than once when he’d realized just how much he looked forward to seeing Tony.
that he’d purchased from a used book store earlier that week to keep him company.  He’d always meant to read the classic, but for whatever reason, never had, and when he’d seen the battered copy on the shelf for fifty cents, he’d picked it up without hesitation.
Or a week later:
Of course, it’s really hard to follow through with his resolve to get over it when Bucky texts him a little over an hour later.
“I’m not saying it’d never happen, but Stark is a valuable commodity, and it’d be much more likely that someone would ransom him or try to leverage his intelligence than hurt him,” Natasha said delicately, and Steve stared at her. He’d never told her about Tony.
Although, if anything, that seems to prove his point. Here he is, getting lost in daydreams, and Tony’s just … standing there.
-----
So maybe Steve hadn’t introduced hope so much as an element of doubt, but it was more than Tony had had in a long time, and he felt … didn’t know how he felt actually, his emotions jumbled together in a snarl that would take forever to untangle. He did know that he felt more
“And you didn’t stop by?” Tony asked, his mouth curving down.
Nonetheless, he couldn’t stop from tensing up when he caught a glimpse of red and gold beneath and to the left of him. Tony hovered in the air as he looked around, his back to Steve, and it was as good as position as he could’ve hoped for, which automatically made him suspicious. Still, if Tony knew where he was, attacking was his best shot anyway, and if he didn’t know, waiting around for Tony to look up and behind him definitely wasn’t going to help.
“In or out,” Tony said, his voice clipped, using the dregs of his self-restraint to keep from responding to Steve the way he wanted to.  “Make up your mind.”
Tony nodded once, a brief jerk of the head.
Why were they both rolling their eyes at him?
“It changes everything.”
On the tenth anniversary of his death, Tony came back.
“Pepper—”
He rubbed the back of his hand against his forehead, pressing his knuckles in harder and harder.
The first time he drinks is right after he wakes up from a nightmare. He’s dreamed about killing Tony before, but never quite like this, crushing the arc reactor with the edge of his shield, Tony getting paler and paler as he gasps, clawing at his chest, Steve gloating over him, watching him die.
“I can’t help it if you’re not very good,” Steve says, teasing as always, but his heart’s not in it.
He glared at Steve and pointed his finger threateningly at him when Steve tried to get closer.
“Yes,” he said, although he tended to draw more in the blank pages than write, simple doodles mostly, although he sometimes copied the skyline, or sketched an interesting face. Still, he put something down every day and that was really all she’d requested of him.
“Well, I mean, the sooner the better, right?” he says, and it side-steps Dr. Stark’s question, but he’s sure Dr. Stark doesn’t want to be here any longer than he has to be.
It had been so tempting to lie in that moment, to extend the truth just enough to push aside any new doubt … but then he’d come to his senses, shame filling him for even considering that as an option. It had been hard to be completely honest, but it would’ve been unforgiveable if he hadn’t.
He hadn’t thought Tony would get anything out of having Steve act like a dog. In the back of his head, he’d started to assume Tony had chosen it in order to emphasize how Steve needed to listen to Tony’s commands and learn to trust him to take care of his needs, to have faith in Tony period. And all of that might still be true, but if Tony also just liked the way Steve looked like this … if Tony got some sort of enjoyment from seeing Steve in fluffy ears and whatever else he was going to wear …
Tony’s voice whispered in his head again like a fading echo, and he could feel his cheeks burning, which was a ridiculous reaction to an endearment.
change, he thought. If Red Skull had had his way, none of this would’ve been around; but he hadn’t won, and Steve had been part of that. It had to count for something.
good, why would you—you’re the best man I’ve ever known.”
"I . . . suppose," and yeah, that look on Tony's face can't mean anything good.
“Before I go,” Steve said, and that wasn’t distracting at all, having Steve speak right next to his ear, “I want . . .”
“Have you changed your mind? Would you like to stop?”
“Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist,” Tony said calmly enough, but was there an edge to an answer, an emphasis on “philanthropist” that made Steve see red. Like he needed a reminder that Tony had taken him in for all the wrong reasons.
He tries to bury that part, shoves it down as far as it can go. It’s not the time, it won’t ever be the time, and he just—he can’t believe he just—
Steve has to swallow twice, his throat making a clicking noise each time, before he manages to ask, “Y-you want to do … what?”
Tony had said something similar earlier when he’d brought up safewords, right before Steve had humiliated himself: it wasn’t like he wouldn’t respect a stop if Steve had said it. He’d obviously felt the need to be clear about it now, though.
“Tony, wait—”
Thanks to MetaAllu for the encouragement!
“There wouldn’t be anything to fix if I hadn’t—” Steve’s other hand came to curl around Tony’s, joining the first. Tony hadn’t noticed the quiver running through Steve until then, but it was obvious as Steve held onto him. “I’m so

His breath hitched audibly when Tony soaped his neck, and Tony’s mouth quirked, but he didn’t say anything. He rubbed Steve’s shoulders, sure and firm, even with all the slipperiness, and Steve made a sound when Tony found a particularly tight spot, blushing right afterward. It seemed . . . decadent . . . to sit there and let Tony take care of him, and he didn’t know what to do with himself.
Tony had spent a lot of time thinking about Steve when he couldn’t fall asleep the previous night, too wired from imagining all the various ways Fury was going to take advantage of his newfound knowledge. He’d finally gotten fed up with worrying about it and moved on to more important things since one, he’d always faced up to the mistakes he made, and two, while blabbering to Fury might not have been the smartest move on his part, it wasn’t like he could say
Because he’d—
"Ask nicely, and I will."
After thoroughly washing himself, he toweled off, scrubbing at his hair until it was as dry as it was going to get. Why didn’t he own a blow dryer? He obviously wasn’t prepared enough—
Dick was all for Bruce and Clark being together. Bruce wasn’t the type of guy to display a lot of emotions when he wasn’t in character, but Dick had honestly never seen Bruce so at peace with the world around him since the two of them started getting serious. They balanced each other out, with Bruce’s pragmatism and Clark’s optimism, and they were there for each other; they could depend on each other for anything, from lending a supportive ear after a bad day to being at their side when they battled an intergalactic warlord.
One brunch wasn’t the same thing as Steve declaring his love for everyone to hear. Tony knew that, but he’d let a single event overshadow everything that had happened before it.
She shrugged and nodded toward the access panel, letting him know she’d keep working while he took care of the guards.
“You didn’t even ask me!” he burst out, and it was still there: the hurt and impotent rage from discovering his life had been turned upside down once again without any input from him. “I was right there! But you didn’t even give me a choice—”
and then that’s it.
“Don’t remind me.  I don’t know how you convinced me—”

. I promise you are.” Tony ran one hand up and down Steve’s back, trying to comfort him, but Steve remained tense, and Tony could almost feel the misery radiating off of him. “I’ll help you,” he said at last, anything to make Steve feel better, and Steve jerked back just enough to look into Tony’s face. Whatever he saw there had him let out a shuddering breath, and he nodded, his eyes alight with hope.
Before Loki, the only knowledge he’d had of the Jotun were through warriors’ accounts—that ice flowed in their veins; that they drank the blood of their enemies; that they would sooner tear off their own limbs than show mercy or kindness to another—and while he’d realized that embellishment was part of any good story, all the talebearers were in agreement that Jotun were fierce fighters, proud, and monstrous in form and power.
At first, Steve wasn’t quite sure what he meant. Ask him to do what? Put him on his knees? Choke him? The thought of asking made him fidget—because he was uncomfortable with Tony’s request, he told himself—and he didn’t know if he could do it, even as a sharp ache of want started to build in his chest.
“It was a plan to use helicarriers to monitor potential threats in order to keep them from becoming real ones. Nick said you—”
Well. That was easily explained as well.
So he said, “I want to be good for you,” the words just as true, even if they didn’t express the full extent of his feelings.
Steve knew she was asking if he had anyone he would call a friend, and for just a moment, he thought about warm brown eyes and a brash smile, and then he shook his head.
Maybe he was just hesitant because of how exposed it’d leave him, with nowhere to hide his face and all of Tony’s attention on him.
What if he went looking for someone who, months after they started dating, wouldn’t have such a hard time thinking of something he or she had done for Tony?
“I am aware,” the person who could only be Dr Reynolds said stiffly. “As soon as I realized whose chart I had—”
—in the first place, the one that kept insisting Tony couldn’t possibly be the Dom that Steve needed, and look where that had gotten him?)
“Yes, Sir,” JARVIS replied before Steve could gather his thoughts and tell him he’d gotten breakfast ready.
-----
Of course it did. And when had Steve ever given up on anything?
Although that’s probably Steve making things up, because he wants Dr. Stark to like him.
“Are you writing in your journal?”
Maybe he should … give Tony a tour?  Before he drags him to the bedroom? That’s probably only polite.
“No, it’s not. You came back,” Tony said, and Steve squeezed his fingers convulsively, his head ducking down. “You apologized, and you explained
Tony didn’t say anything for a long moment, but he ran his hand along Steve’s hair over and over again in a barely-there caress that Steve didn’t want to ever stop.
He’d known that he’d messed things up. He’d been confrontational, had used Tony to vent his frustrations on, had taken Tony and all his consideration for granted, and had promised to try to trust Tony, only to fail over and over again. He’d known that he’d wronged Tony in a number of different ways.
Tony whined again, nuzzling into him and almost knocking him over in surprise, and Steve let out a huff of laughter. When Tony started licking his face over-enthusiastically, it turned into a real laugh.
Should he interrupt him? No, that’d be rude to expect Tony to drop everything just because he’d gotten back. He’d should wait until Tony was finished.
That morning had been the first time Stark hadn’t wanted to spar. He’d run on the treadmill the entire hour instead and left immediately after, and Steve didn’t know what that meant, just knew that it bothered him more and more the longer he thought about it.
.  He and Steve were just barely
But while Steve had gotten his fair share of appreciative glances and comments and understood that he was considered handsome
But ...
“Lights!” Tony barked upon seeing the darkness ahead, craning his head to see—
Tony had caught him at it one time when he’d come over and woken Steve up with a blow job.  Steve had never let him spend the night or been willing to stay at his place, and Tony had been putting up a fight.  He didn’t know if the blow job had been an apology for the argument the night before or if it’d been a sneaky way of trying to further his case, but Tony had seen him at the mirror afterwards, touching his scars as he got ready for the day, and Tony had never brought up the subject again, something that Steve could only be grateful for.
Tony laughs. “Because of my date Friday night.”
What was he doing? What the
“Thank you,” he whispered hoarsely, accepting the chocolate and blinking back the burning in his eyes, and then before he could convince himself he shouldn’t, he broke off a chunk for himself and held the rest out to Tony. “You should have some too,” he said when Tony didn’t immediately reach for it.
No. There hadn’t been enough time for a doctor to perform anything but the most superficial of tests.
It wouldn’t be any different.
without having to wait for some
Tony slumped back onto the bed, too tired at the realization to keep going. He vaguely remembered heading for his room and Steve touching him or grabbing him or something, and then Tony had … well, he didn’t exactly know what he’d done at the point, but he assumed he’d collapsed, since his memory was a blank from then on.
Steve woke up full of energy, starving, and incredibly aroused. It was an odd combination, and not one that he’d experienced many times in his life. The first two conditions were easily explained away, and the third—
He hesitated for a second before replying, “Tony,” and slapped his hand into Steve’s, giving it a quick shake.  Tony’s fingers spasmed in Steve’s grip for no good reason, and Tony jerked back, curling his hand into a fist that he hid beneath the counter.
Eventually, he’d decided that if Stark had actually noticed how quiet things were, he probably would've been more bothered by it than Steve was. Stark was the type of person who liked to be surrounded by noise, even if it was just the radio or the television in the background, and he wouldn’t have gone out of his way to inconvenience himself for something so inconsequential as having a chattier dinner companion.
“Stark, you know that's a one-way trip?” he asked Tony, his voice still clear by strength of will alone. Steve wanted him to stop, to turn around, to think of another way, even though they all knew there wasn’t one.
Except he’d kept thinking about it, the argument popping up at odd times over the following week.  Intimacy implied exposure, implied being open and vulnerable and that really was only fun during sex, and even then, it was better when he was on the other ends of things.
Word count: 635
“Let me,” he pleaded, his hands sliding up Tony’s thighs, so there could be no mistaking what he was asking. “Please. I want to. Let me do this for you, Tony,” Steve said, shifting back just enough to catch Tony’s eyes so he could see how sincere he was.
He stayed the longest in what was obviously a playroom, looking at the various apparatuses that stood not-so innocently along the room and wondered what was inside the three armoires. He imagined he’d find out soon enough, and after staring at the St. Andrew’s cross for a while, he took a deep breath and closed the door, heading back to Tony.
Flying with Stark was chaos and cold, fear and exhilaration. It was seeing the blur of lights as they raced past and feeling the heavy push of air trying to tear him away. Stark had given him a helmet, saying he’d be grateful for it once they were up in the air. Steve did appreciate the protection from the wind, but he was still tempted to take it off, to feel the biting rush against his face.
“No,” he said, the same as he’d done in every previous check-up, but they insisted on asking.
“Yeah.” He could hear Tony swallow. “Of course.” Steve flinched when he felt Tony’s fingers touch his, but he grabbed onto them before Tony had a chance to draw them away and held onto him like a lifeline. “Okay. It’s okay, Steve.”
It takes a little bit of experimentation to get situated. Tony wishes Angels could breathe underwater, because then at least, he’d be able to swim normally, but he has to turn onto his back in order to make sure the Angel doesn’t drown. It’s a pain, especially since the wings are a lot broader across the shoulders than Tony had expected, and they make it impossible to lay the Angel on his back. He ends up having to use one tentacle to wrap around the bottoms of the wings to keep them together with the Angel facedown on his chest, Tony’s arms loosely wrapped around him.
The thing was that Tony didn’t. He didn’t want Steve gone, and that made him one of the most masochistic Doms to ever walk the face of the earth, because the last time Steve had invaded his life, things hadn’t gone well for him.
He didn’t need a watcher! He’d always looked after himself, and while yes, he’d wanted Tony to take care of him, that hadn’t meant he needed Tony to go easy on him. That he couldn’t handle earning Tony’s forgiveness on his own.
At the time, he hadn’t thought to question whether his mother spoke those words as reassurance or as prophecy, but he wondered now what she had seen of their life together.  He had asked years later, but as with all her visions, she had held the knowledge tight to her bosom and refused to answer.
“I’m sorry, you have to be freezing!” Dr. Stark says, pulling away. “Look, I know you said you don’t want any scrubs, but you might consider taking off your shirt. You’re never going to warm up if you’re all wet like that.” He scrunches his nose apologetically. “I can’t even offer to raise the heat. The office temperature is preprogrammed as a result of the infamous summer of 2018 apparently, and all the thermostats are locked.”
“What other choice did I have, Pepper?” he asked, throwing his hands up in the air.  “No matter what anyone says, I didn’t
It was a huge relief when Tony walked into the living room, so much so that Steve had to steady himself, pressing the fingers of one hand against the wall behind his back. Tony was fine; he looked good even. Resting and showering had done him wonders, and while his hair was still wet, he’d styled it and touched up his goatee. He hadn’t needed Steve after all, and Steve had managed to do what Tony had wanted.
?” Tony demanded, wanting to reach out and shake Fury, although he wasn’t actually stupid enough to try.  “That’s
“‘Next time?’ I know I lead an eventful life, but I don’t exactly plan on being cursed and turning into a wolf regularly.”
“Take everything off, and then get on the bed, face down,” Tony said, stepping back and intending to use the time it took for Steve to undress to dredge up some semblance of control—except Steve took all of ten seconds to get naked and climb on the bed, and there went that idea.
So it’s horrible of him to suddenly wish otherwise, and he tries to stop himself from imagining what it’d be like to walk into Dr. Stark’s office and tell him his heats are giving him problems—
Before Steve found a Dom who suited him better.
“I know I wasn’t your first choice, and I know there were things I could’ve—and should’ve—done differently. These past few days have been—and I acted like a shit, I know that. Although you weren’t entirely blameless yourself!” Tony said, glaring at Steve for a second before looking down. “But even when I fucked it up, I always tried to do what was best for you—”
Alpha pheromones could trigger a heat (and he totally didn't understand the evolutionary cause of that unless they were hoping suddenly going into heat would make an Alpha appear or something, but whatever, not his gig); too many Omegas in close quarters with each other could trigger a heat; the list went on and on.
Why did they pick coffee again? If they’d gone with dinner, he could’ve invited Tony in afterwards, seen how things went, but he can’t really ask Tony if he wants to come in for a drink after he just had a cup of coffee. It’s way too obvious, and the last thing he wants is for Tony to think he’s only interested in getting him into bed as soon as possible. (Even if he’s definitely interested in getting Tony into bed as soon as possible. It’s just not the only thing he’s interested in.)
“Not as much as I missed you,” he told him, the only bit of truth he could give him because if Tony knew just how much Steve meant it, he wouldn’t let him get half that close.
“I am not going to dance on the plane!”
“I’m not trying to excuse him. There

going to do with him, not yet anyway, but he’d figure it out. Somehow.
“He had a carton of leftover lo mein noodles right before his nap.”
Tony had told Steve to try not to come. He hadn’t forbidden it, but he’d asked Steve to resist for as long as he could, and Steve, being the sweet, obedient boy that he was, had said he would do his best.
Had Steve.
used to spend a lot of time in the air with Tony, though admittedly, it was with Tony carrying him, which was . . . which was nice actually, but SHIELD doesn't want the two of them to interact too much—better to be safe than sorry—so Steve's busy doing missions with the rest of the team while Tony keeps his other self company.  They don’t want the younger Steve out in public or doing anything that'll draw attention, but they don't want to make him more agitated than he already is by keeping him isolated either.  He’s been through enough of a traumatic experience already, and if he feels comforted by hanging around with Tony—never mind that he
“Kiss me,” Bruce said, eyes heavy-lidded and inviting, as if he weren’t ordering Clark around in a low, no-nonsense voice that demanded immediate action.
“Just listen,” he begged, but he didn’t know what he could possibly say at that point to get Tony to look at him like he mattered again.
Not to say it couldn’t be better, because Tony apparently hadn’t been expecting that, so the kiss is messy and all over the place and they only manage to avoid knocking heads through a combination of luck and Tony’s quick reflexes.
His tentacles, however, don’t agree.
He didn’t know how long he spent on his knees, but he knew it was less time than he would’ve liked. Tony was still tired, though, and couldn’t be comfortable standing there, and what if he tried to join Steve on the floor like the last time? So Steve forced himself to get up, but he missed it almost immediately, the muscles in his legs flexing as they registered how wrong it felt to be standing.
to go. Not without at least trying to explain.” Tony had always been so careful to make sure Steve had what he needed, even when Steve hadn’t known he needed it himself. He had to believe that Tony would do it one more time. Just once more. “Please, Tony.”
It wasn’t the first time he’d made that decision. And maybe it was foolish of him, maybe it set him up to fall that much further later on, but …
He let out a long breath. “Look, I’m going to—”
Tony grins from ear to ear and tells him.
“Tony?”  Steve knocked on the one-way window.  “Joe’s asking for you.”
The silence was longer this time. “Don’t turn this into a pissing contest, Stark—”
(source: http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000984.htm)
to say his safeword, felt … he didn’t know how he felt about Tony being in that situation actually, too many things to make sense of, but he did know he was glad Tony had stopped, that his Dom at the time had respected it, but it wasn’t the same thing. That had been something Tony had been curious about, not … not this.
It’s only when Steve begins tensing like a spring, his wings fluttering wildly against the water, that Tony starts lashing his hectocotyli as well as thrusting them, something one of his Human partners had told him felt like a vibrator on steroids.
All too quickly, however, Tony seemed to remember himself, and Steve hated the way his features closed off.
By the time they got to the door with Tim and Damian behind them, Clark and his mother had already been let in by Alfred.
Tony pulled the bag closer and unzipped it.
“I didn’t think until I reached the coast that you might live underwater, but by then, it was too late to ask for help. Angels go into heat when they’re close to their Soulmate for the first time. I

“I thought I showed you too,” he said, and maybe Steve didn’t mean it as an accusation, but the words still fell on Tony like a blow, because wth Steve’s revelation ringing in his ears, Tony could begin to see that Steve
“Come here,” Tony said when he saw Steve the next morning. He hadn’t gotten much sleep, thoughts going too fast to ever properly settle, but he felt better than he had in a while. Things between him and Steve weren’t ever going to be what he wanted them to be, but they could still be good. After all the shit that had gone on and all the mistakes, they were finally on the same page, and yeah, Steve was going to leave again—in a few weeks, a few months, soon, whenever it was. In the meantime, however, Tony was going to do his best by him, and he was determined to leave his mark on Steve, just like Steve had left one on him.
Tony had forced Fury to nullify their contract precisely to prevent that from happening, but when Steve had come back to New York, hadn’t some of the first words out of his mouth been about its validity?
His words seem to ring in the silence, and Fury folded his hands together in front of him, looking at Tony consideringly. “You have my word,” he said at last, calm and apparently completely sincere, and the turnabout had Tony floundering.
“I’m fine,” he said, his words slightly muffled, directed as they were into the shield. And he was, even if his pride might take a minute to recover from being trussed into a ball and carried around. It was better than hitting the dirt, and he wasn’t sure how to describe how he felt knowing that Tony stopped his fall, had made sure to watch out for him in the middle of everything.
And yet.
“You apologized. Alright. Fine,” Tony said, rubbing his eyes with his fingers and then pinching the bridge of his nose. The dismissive tone hurt, but Steve reminded himself that it was no less than he deserved. “Now what?”
, and he was going to— “Assuming the two of you are compatible, of course,” Fury added, throwing Tony’s own words in his face, and he’d never liked Fury.  Not even once.
“Put on the suit,” he said, and he was so angry, rage heating his face and making his hands tremble. Steve knew that he shouldn’t let what Tony had get to him—that it wasn’t the time or the place—but it was Tony. And Tony had always been able to get under his skin. “Let's go a few rounds,” he said, and in that instant, he wanted to fight Tony; wanted to beat away his pain.
Tony’s eyes were closed, but he could hear the change in Steve’s voice, hear the sudden and inexplicable interest.  There was something
“I would think that would be obvious.  Your father was instrumental in creating him after all,” Fury said, watching him, although if he was expecting Tony to give something away, then he was going to be disappointed.  Tony had plenty of practice not reacting when anyone mentioned his dad.
” It was too much sensation all at once, and he wasn’t ready for them, for how strong the vibrations were, how fast, and Steve convulsed, yelling—
The water isn’t cold anymore, but it’s still cool against his heated skin, and Steve would like to say that it makes his erection go down, but it really, really doesn’t.
He reached for the lube and dripped some directly on Steve’s hole, just to see to squirm, before lubing up his cock. It wasn’t that he didn’t still have concerns about taking this step with Steve, but they just … they didn’t seem to matter half as much as they used to, seemed foolish in the light of Steve’s willingness to be open about him and their relationship together.
He’d never call himself shy, but he definitely felt self-conscious. Sure, he’d been naked for Tony just a few hours ago, but he hadn’t been the only one with his clothes off, and Tony had been a lot closer. He felt distinctly vulnerable standing up there for—well, for Tony’s viewing pleasure.
We were attacked by a huge number of Them today.  I wasn’t hurt.  No scratches or bites.  Yes, I’m sure.  We look each other over pretty carefully after every fight, with the same level of meticulous care you used on me countless times before we reached the Compound if without the wandering hands.
“I just thought—” He coughed and rubbed his forehead. “I don’t know really. I just wanted to.”
Dr. Stark tugs gently at Steve’s hips, and Steve’s glad for his hands over his face, because he’s just barely able to catch the gasp behind his palm, and he’s leaking worse than ever now. It’s as if hearing the splash against the step has encouraged his body to produce even more slick, needing to show Dr. Stark how much he affects him, rejecting even the possibility of denying it.
He watches as Tony gets closer, butterflies fluttering in his stomach, and it’s funny because Steve’s never had a chance to notice Tony’s shoulder to waist ratio, but … Tony has a really nice shoulder to waist ratio.
“Before,” Steve swallowed. “Before you say anything else, may I tell you something?”
turned on (he might be a little more excited than entirely appropriate right now—those damn thighs—but it’s nowhere near his previous levels), and it’s nice. More than nice.
, and yup, there it was, Steve’s hand in his face. It was gone a second later at Tony’s look, and Steve took a few obliging steps back in order to give him space, his hands up in the air.
“What?” Now Steve looked upset. Frustration turning to anger, and it seemed like the more things changed, the more they stayed the same. “Then how were we ever in a contract in the first place?”
A file, huh?  Well, that explained how he’d known Tony was a Dom at least.
Steve was quiet for a while, bridling at the thought of Tony’s rules, no doubt, but when he spoke, all he said was, “But you

“Now, I know puppies can get pretty rambunctious, so I’ll let you run in the gym and put on your leash for walks outside and play games with you.”
Steve shifted on the bed, the sheets gliding like water over his exposed skin, and he grimaced, his shoulders clenching reflexively. They were just too . . .  too white, too long, too soft. Everything in Stark’s home was
“Hand me that wrench next to the stove, will you?” Tony asks distractedly, and Steve frowns, because what’s a wrench doing next to the stove anyway, but he grabs it, holding it out to Tony without even thinking about it.
understand—”
It was still hard to force himself to eventually get up and go, but Sam swung his arm over his shoulders after Steve said his goodbyes and told him, “C’mon, Steve. I’ve got you,” and so he nodded and only looked back once to see Rhodes shifting closer to Tony on the couch before tearing his eyes away.
“Alright,” Tony said, his shoulders slumping. “Okay.”
That Steve loved him.
So it’d be up to him to whether or not he got fucked. It’d be his fault. Steve thought back on holding the ottoman over his head. He didn’t know how long it’d taken his muscles to fatigue, but eventually even the Serum hadn’t been able to save him, and he knew that it’d happen again. He closed his eyes for a moment.
He was starting to suspect it was because Tony didn’t trust him anymore, not with this at least. Once bitten, twice shy, and had they really done much outside their old routine? They actually saw each other less now since Steve was working at SHIELD, and yes, they hugged, but those were more for comfort than passion.
“You don’t have to do that,” Tony said roughly when Steve knelt at his feet, and he looked up, smiling wryly.
“I guess I’m going to LA,” Steve said to the empty room after a long moment and went to go pack.
“There’s not anyone you want to see?” she asked, pushing, always pushing.
“Tell me what you’re thinking,” Dr. Saunders said. “We can walk through it.”
Steve waited for more, for the real reason Tony had stopped them and not … not this.
Tony tended to avoid Omegas when he could.
Steve glanced at the clock—5:47 am—and got out of bed. He’d get breakfast ready, be able to put it in front of Tony within minutes of him waking up, and then Tony would tell him his punishment, and Steve would do it, whatever it was.
Somewhere in all the mess of Loki’s arrival, though, that had changed. Maybe it’d been Steve looking at him like he couldn’t stand to be around him, or knowing he wasn’t going to see him again, hell, maybe it’d been seeing him walking away for good, but Tony had realized he’d done it. He’d fallen in love with Steve.
hopeless, and Steve does what Dr. Stark wants, spreading himself wide and then wider still because there’s something about obeying, about offering himself up for whatever Dr. Stark intends to do to him that feels so right that he even drops his hands by his sides, not wanting to hide any part of himself.
“Sir,” Captain America said to Fury.  After a pause, he added, “Sir,” in Tony’s direction.
"You're used to following orders, right?" Tony asks, tongue peeking out between his lips to catch a stray drop of water, and that isn't distracting at all.
Tony was witty and kind, was incredibly handsome and used to dating beautiful Subs, and the only thing that made Steve special was the reason he’d left Tony in the first place.
. He knew it was unfair, however. They wouldn’t even be in this situation if it weren’t for him, and he shouldn’t be upset that Tony was taking some time for himself. Steve should just be grateful that he’d gotten what he wanted in the end: Tony was letting him stay.
. He’s allowed to now. He can have as much of Tony as he wants, and the idea of it makes him feel crazy, makes him shudder and arch up towards Tony, a whine building in his throat.
Tony doesn’t mean to slow back down, but two of his tentacles have decided they’re going to wrap around his Angel instead of work, and while technically, yes, Tony could fix that, he doesn’t really want to.
There’s no question about who would win in a contest of strength, and while Tony could--and will--probably put something together that can keep Steve right where he wants him, there’s nothing but Steve’s desire to please keeping him where he is right now.
“No, I have a bit of a wandering streak.  What about you, Steve?  Where are you headed to?” he asked, holding the keys up, flashing the Hertz logo back at him.
Steve’s eyes closed tightly, and he took several slow breaths. But eventually he whispered, “Alright,” and when Tony started to climb to his feet, Steve joined him, staggering and gritting his teeth against the pain of having been in that position for so long.
“You want to what?”
“I’m not here for SHIELD,” Steve said, which just infuriated Tony even more.
“Tony Stark, at your service.  Nice to meet you, Steve.”
“You’ve been behaving yourself and being a good boy for me after all,” Tony said thoughtfully, his fingers working steadily. Steve tried to shake his head, but it was so hard to concentrate on anything that wasn’t Tony and the things he was doing to him. He managed to toss his head back once, but the ears slapped against his cheeks, and the muzzle stretched and pulled, and it was disorienting enough that the tenuous hold on his self-control just slipped further. “I suppose a little treat is in order, don’t you think, Puppy?”
“I’m sorry,” Steve repeats, taking a step closer to Tony’s bed.  “I wanted to tell you the truth—”
“Captain Rogers is at SHIELD headquarters. Shall I contact him, Sir?”
“You’re going to be just fine,” Tony whispered, rocking him.
sure.  Our projects always turn out, Pops, but I had to finish it by myself since—”  He shrugged, looking away.
(Bruce had kept the audio of that first meeting. He still alluded to it every now and then when he wanted to blackmail Dick.)
“I’ll be back late,” Tony said, looking down at his phone, swiping past one screen to the next. “You don’t need to wait up.”
Title from the song “Piece of My Heart” sung by Janis Joplin.
It wouldn’t solve everything. It might not solve … anything actually, because Tony knew that loving someone didn’t guarantee that it’d all work out, knew that guilt could eat away at the best of intentions and that they’d hurt each other to the point that other people might have decided to cut their losses and walk away. That wasn’t an option for Tony, though. Steve wasn’t someone he could just
“The only thing you’re allowed to do in the bathroom by yourself is use the toilet. I’ll brush your teeth, and I’ll give you a bath, and if you need to masturbate, I’ll give you the chance to do that as well.”
Finally Natasha asked hesitantly, “Steve, have you ever … ?”
Of course, the mission was over now.
“Now, if you were ever interested in exploring just how pleasurable pain can be, I’d be more than happy to help,” Tony said, his thumbs stroking Steve’s knuckles, “but for discipline, for
yet, and at this rate, Dr. Stark is going to have to open all the doors and windows of the entire office in order to air it out and not offend all the patients who have appointments the next day.
Tony was giving up on him.
Maybe if he’d stayed at SHIELD longer, he would’ve eventually approached one of the men or women there, although he doubted it. Before Stark had arrived, he’d always preferred to be by himself, needing the solitude to get his thoughts together, and it was unlikely that Nick would’ve let him engage with anyone while he was still unattached.
“That you are a fool?  Yes, there can be no doubt.”
Steve had needed something, though, and heaven help him, Tony had wanted to give it to him.
“Yes, Dr. St-
He just wants.
He shook his head emphatically.
Tony moved his feet out of them, shaking them off, and Steve absently folded the jeans, resting them on top of the shoes.
He’d thought when Tony had told him to take off his clothes that it meant Tony was still attracted to him, but Tony wasn’t even looking at him. He hadn’t touched Steve at all since he’d gotten home, and Steve missed it, his skin tight and aching for the barest brush of Tony’s fingers. What if being naked was just a way to add to Steve’s humiliation rather than out of any real desire on Tony’s part?
There’s a huge part of me that wants to—
“That’s not what I asked.” He gripped the base of the vibrator and pulled slightly so that Steve was squeezing around the knot instead of the thinner part beneath it, forcing the vibrations even faster and making Steve cry out and his knees buckle, so he was completely bent over the table.
How the hell had he messed things up so much?
He raised his hand, letting it hover in the air for a second before touching his lips, feeling the weight of his fingers and wishing they were Tony’s.
“I’m sorry too that I didn’t make us take a break and talk things out. I knew you were upset, but I thought I could manage it better. It was irresponsible of me, and I’m so sorry, Steve, that you had to go through that your first time.”
It’s like some horrible superpower really, and Steve should probably mind more than he does, but he can’t bring himself to be upset.  He likes being useful, and well, Tony puts him to use.  It’s comforting almost.  He’s never been the type of person to have people waiting on him, but there are people and machines to take care of the house, the lawn, the cars, and he likes being able to do something for Tony considering everything Tony does for the team.  Besides, unlike the majority of the rest of the world, Tony doesn’t want anything from
“But this can’t exactly be comfortable for you,” Steve says, finally scrounging up the courage to look Dr. Stark in the face.
His ass flexed, just making everything worse, the line of warmth sliding downward that much faster, and damn it. He stared down at his rapidly hardening cock, feeling hot all over, and he hadn’t ever given much thought to what it’d feel like to have his Dom’s come leaking out of him, but he was pretty certain he’d be thinking about it in excruciating detail in the future.
Steve waited, but Tony didn’t come in, didn’t even say anything to him through the door, and what? Did he think Steve hadn’t heard them?
The corner of her mouth lifted in a half-smirk. “Oh, come on, Steve. There was way too much sexual tension whenever the two of you were in a room back when Loki was a threat, and then you move back to New York after you’d finally started setting down roots in D. C.?”
“Do you really think that matters?
But is it too much to ask that Tony get a little flushed? Or that his eyes wander every so quickly over Steve’s body? Or that he look like he can’t wait get his hands on Steve as soon as possible?
Steve thought he might want that, and he pushed his face harder against the leather.
The kid rolled his eyes.  “Do you
“I would like another hug,” Tony said, keeping his tone easy and wondering if Steve would balk or if he’d be receptive to the idea.
Tony knows fuck-all about flowers. He could point out a rose reliably--he’s given enough of them to his dates--but that’s about it. It wouldn’t normally be a problem since Pepper long ago hired a florist exclusively for Tony who provides tasteful date bouquets, birthday bouquets, get-well-soon bouquets, and of course, the ever popular, we’re-very-sorry-about-him-there’s-nothing-we-can do bouquets, but unfortunately, that’s not an option right now. He’s five minutes out from picking up the lovely Gabriella, and he may have accidentally just crushed her flowers.
“The time machine is set for two hours, and it’s going to take me back whether I’m ready or not.”  Joe smiled, but there was something fragile about it.  “I just wanted a chance to see you before . . .”
Could it even be fixed?
actually steal your corpse, and because you’d been an Infinity Gauntlet wielder, they were able to regrow all the dead cells and reanimate your body with the residual power of the Soul Stone.”
Why yes. Yes, it does.
It hadn’t been five minutes yet, he reminded himself, trying to stay calm and resisting the urge to look at the clock. And Tony was talking to him at least, asking him questions. That had to be a good thing, right?
needs to stop. There’s a time and a place for inappropriately lusting after someone, and it’s in the privacy of his own bedroom, not when he’s lying on his back with his legs spread during a doctor’s exam!
balls, although don’t tell me about any of it. I haven’t seen you this into someone in a long time, and you haven’t even met the guy. Think how good it could be
Steve still felt a rush of relief at the visible proof Tony was okay, which he ignored in favor of grabbing him by the arm and pulling him inside, slamming the door behind him.
“But every morning, we’ll start just like this, with me getting you ready to be my sweet puppy for the day.”
Tony didn’t know why the idea of Clint and Natasha coming for lunch made him so possessive, but it did. It made him completely, irrationally, and ridiculously possessive. He’d tried to ignore it at first and pretend the event wasn’t hanging like a black cloud on the horizon, a sure harbinger of doom. When that hadn’t worked, he’d tried to convince himself that there was nothing they could or would do that’d make Steve leave him any sooner than he was already planning. And when
“I don’t want to hurt you—”
every time he looks at him and that Tony is over
Steve had hoped that Tony’s increasingly frequent visits meant that Tony had begun to feel the same way about him, but apparently, Tony’d had a much darker motive that had nothing to do with Steve.
“You are one kinky motherfucker,” Steve hears dimly as he opens his eyes, and he groans, immediately shutting them again.
“So any exciting plans for the weekend?” Steve asks as they start up a round of 6v6 PVP. “I’m heading towards B,” he says, bypassing A completely. They need to keep control of two zones to win, and it’s easier to get a fresh zone than capture a taken one.
“You look good, that’s good, the colors look nice on you. What about me? Is this better? I took the tie off but I think—”
“Please keep in mind that he didn’t ask for this either, alright?” she said, and he nodded, because there wasn’t any way Steve would let him forget.
“Steve?” Tony says, and Steve lets out a humiliatingly high laugh as he launches himself away from the door, his cheeks burning. He is the. Absolute. Worst.
When he’d woken up that morning, it’d been to a feeling of confusion. Why was the sun coming in from the wrong side of the room? Why did his sheets smell and feel different? The answers had come rushing in immediately after, all of the anger and impotence he’d struggled to deal with—that he was
It doesn’t help, though, not when as soon as Dr. Stark touches one, Steve nearly arches off the table and lets out a choked gasp. He’s always had sensitive nipples, but they’ve never been
The worst thing was that he couldn’t even deny it.
"That's not what I said—"
“Unbelievable, Tones,” Rhodes said, shaking his head. “Only you would save a race of people that had the technology to bring you back and the determination to do whatever it took to accomplish it.”
He knows Dr. Stark is an alpha, has signed the release forms that say he doesn’t need another omega or beta in the room during the examination with him, and he doesn’t understand how Dr. Stark holds himself back when an omega like him comes in, someone who
“Yes. Whenever you want,” Steve said immediately, even though he hated the idea of waiting. But if Tony needed another day to choose something that truly fit Steve’s crime, then wasn’t that better for the both of them in the long-run? Steve didn’t want there to be any lingering resentment, or for Tony to decide later that he should’ve demanded more from him.
He shouted when Tony finally locked inside of him, shouted in pain and shock and pleasure as he came all over himself, much earlier than he’d expected, as if Tony’s enormous knot had forced the come out of him, not enough room for the both of them in Steve’s body. Even then, Tony continued thrusting, harsh, stilted motions that tugged and stretched Steve’s hole as Tony rocked against his prostate and filled him with so much come that Steve could feel the pressure in his gut, and it made Steve’s orgasm last forever, tears welling in his eyes as he cried out from the overstimulation, come spurting from his cock in weak drizzles long after he was done.
More than anything, he realized, it was the idea of Tony purposefully keeping the truth from him that had Steve wondering how they were supposed to go forward—even while the thought of leaving Tony made it feel like something was trying to eat its way out of his chest. What kind of relationship could they have, though, if Tony kept something like this from him?
He closed his eyes, his heart recoiling from the ache that always came with hearing Tony’s name.
he snarled at the voice in his head.
"Just peachy," he drawled, wincing as he adjusted his shoulders a little.  As he’d been doing each time he thought about that first training session, Tony tried to pretend the weird episode hadn’t happened. And just like every time before, he failed miserably.
“And make me some coffee,” Tony said as he walked towards the kitchen. “I need to sober up.”
what you’re calling it these days?” asked Tony in disbelief.
How wroth he’d been with Loki at the time, accusing him of cheating and muttering vile deprecations of his honor, but months after, when he’d thought back to the stripling of a boy that had defeated him, he’d found himself smiling.
Speaking of which, he needed to get up if he—oh. He was in Tony’s room.
“I’m not signing another contract,” he said, as if he had control over any of it.
Steve felt better.
Pepper always told him he had the sensitivity of a gnat, but even Tony could tell from the way Steve was practically vibrating with the effort to stay in place that he really wanted no part of the conversation they were having.  Tony could sympathize.  It wasn’t like he wanted to share sex secrets with
“Stop that!” She glared at him, the both of them standing now, neither willing to back down. “I
“I really am so sorry about being late,” Steve says again as he follows Dr. Stark, because they’d probably be finished by now if Steve had been on time. He wipes at a few drops of water running down his forehead and tries not to think about what Dr. Stark had said about how meeting someone highly compatible could affect his heats. Yes, Steve had been in for his semi-annual exam a few weeks ago, and yes, he’d brushed against Dr. Stark once as they’d been going in opposite directions down the hallway, and
He knows that he’s off-limits to Dr. Stark. But he doesn’t want Dr. Stark to be
, Steve’s shame written across his face.
“Where is he anyway?” Happy said, looking around as if he was expecting Steve to pop out from behind DUM-E.  “Oh crap, don’t tell me we’ve been talking about Captain America while he’s been sleeping on your dinky cot—”
“Alright,” Tony said, pushing down the front of his pants, the material thin and loose, and Tony had been prepared. “Open your mouth,” he ordered, but it was unnecessary, because Steve was already leaning in.
“Crap, I’ve got to take this, Pepper,” he said, sitting up.
He panted against the ottoman, fucking himself hard and fast, no more teasing, everything loud and slick and aching. He’d thought he was safe from arousal, but he’d been wrong, his body thrumming and already shamefully desperate, the vibrations making everything more intense, and no matter how he tried to punish himself with the vibrator, it still felt good. There was just something about knowing Tony was watching—because he had to be, Steve still hadn’t heard any kind of noise behind him that indicated Tony was doing anything else—and even as Steve tried to block out the sensations, he couldn’t block out the awareness of Tony being pleased with him for something.
“Maybe not in so many words, but your actions were clear enough.” He gave him a flat smile. “Sure you don’t want any?” he asked, wiggling the bottle in the air.
“I did warn you,” Tony said and smiled angelically.
“We’re keeping things quiet,” Steve said. Before he’d ever come out to New York, Dr. Saunders had made sure he realized what he’d be getting himself into. He hadn’t thought about the significance of what it meant to be dating a public figure, hadn’t thought about the fact that Tony
“No, I’m fine.”
He hadn’t wanted this bonding. And yes, being with a Dom hadn’t turned out to be as horrible as he’d thought it would, but that was due more to luck than anything else.
“How is that any different than having a Dom?” Captain America asked bitterly, and woah, what?
“JARVIS, where’s Steve right now?”
He’s a bad person, he realizes, but he’s going to have to dwell on that later.)
Many thanks to sabrecmc for their advice. <3
On purpose sometimes, sure, but that was different.
He was so selfish.
He put his hand on the pad next to the elevator doors and kept his eyes open for the retinal scanner.
“Are you?” He’d had Steve stand next to a padded table and told him he could hold onto it, lean against it if he wanted, or bend over it for extra support. Tony could even adjust the legs with a press of a button so Steve could climb on top if his knees couldn’t hold him anymore.
“You don’t have to say a word when you’ve got that look on your face.”
Something … good? But then why—? Steve had to struggle against the urge to open his eyes. He didn’t know why Tony had told him to close them, but he desperately wanted to know what expression Tony was wearing at that moment.
, looking miserable.
“Migraines?  Have you always had those?”
Word count: 530 (I know, it's so short!  It's amazing!  They were all supposed to be this short...)
Steve sits up hurriedly, closing his legs, and once again, Dr. Stark asks, “Are you alright, Steve?” his voice devastatingly kind, and Steve wants—
He’d known that Stark used to manufacture weapons, of course, that both he and Howard had made their fortune off it, but reading about all the million dollar-deals Stark Industries had signed still took him aback. Seeing how much money the company lost when Stark had pulled out of weapons manufacturing, however, made his jaw drop. He’d followed link after link, wondering how Stark Industries had survived all the upheaval, and didn’t even notice when the next few articles started to focus less on Stark the business tycoon and more on Stark the man. Before he knew it, almost two hours had passed, and he knew much more about Stark’s professional and personal life than he would’ve ever thought he cared to find out.
It made another pang of jealousy shoot through Steve because when it came down to it, he and Tony weren’t actually
Steve glanced up from the remnants of his meal and found Stark staring at him; or more accurately
Actually, now that Tony thought about it, it was a little strange that Steve
He found a likely area with seventeen seconds to spare and quickened his steps, jumping up and immediately pushing off with one foot as soon as he landed so he could leap from trunk to trunk. He managed to grab a branch and pulled himself up, going as high as he dared before crouching down with the shield in front of him and the tree against his back, between him and the direction he thought Tony would be approaching.
—but he can’t. It doesn’t matter that Tony’s right there, or that they’re in public, or that Steve’s never even thought about a fucking machine before, because it’s all he can think about now. About Dr. Stark’s hands pulling him to the end of the exam table and leaving him bare and open as he maneuvers the machine to the right height, choosing which size and settings to use on him while Steve lies there, panting with a combination of nervousness and anticipation. Steve feels like he’s drowning in shame and arousal as he grips the bottom of his chair to keep from reaching out, and he clenches his thighs together in a pitiful effort to contain the problem, like he can’t feel the warmth seeping across his seat.
Now he was back, though, acting like no time had passed at all and offering things Tony had made himself forget he’d ever wanted.
It took Steve over three hours to finish. Tony hadn’t given him any direction on what to do with the damaged items, so he tried to sort those that seemed salvageable into one area and those that looked irreparably damaged into another. It was mostly guesswork, but he didn’t have anyone to ask, so he did the best he could with hands that weren’t quite steady and a chest that had seemed to crack open further with every item he cleared away.
“First is the collar.” Tony held up a simple red leather collar with a gold buckle and D-ring.
He’d had enemas before as part of medical procedures, but it’d be the first time he’d ever done it because of ...

makes up for the fact that Steve had been forced to open his eyes—
It meant a lot to him that Steve was willing to give them the time to get back into some kind of groove, but Steve had obligations: a team of his own and deadlines. He had a network outside of Tony, and truthfully, Tony was glad for it. He hadn’t liked the isolation of their previous time together, and the fact that it wasn’t an issue anymore took a load off his mind.
?” she asked, and in hindsight, this was one of those instances where jumping to the punch line hadn’t been in his best interests after all.
Steve explains a little as they recover.
That was a …
He shook his head rapidly, unable to talk, because if he let even so much as one sound past his lips, he wouldn’t be able to stop any of them. He didn’t want that. He didn’t.
If he were in his right mind, he’d probably be humiliated down to his very bones, but at that moment, all he feels is good. Floaty.
He caught sight of the red stain on Tony’s shirt again, and he couldn’t seem to tear his eyes away from it. He knew Tony hadn’t slept with anyone. He knew it, and he wouldn’t let himself believe otherwise. The red was probably from a miscalculated hug.
“You know what? You’re not my Sub anymore,” he said, an echo of what Steve had once said to him, “so you don’t get to ask that question.”
or whatever it is they’re calling him, and then the agents leave. They just get up and go, saying you’ve been absolved of any crime, and still, not one single damn word from you to explain what’s going on? I had to call
he’s thinking about him.
Okay, maybe “promise” was too strong a word. It was more like a guideline. A suggestion really.
A second after that, he was grunting even louder as Steve dropped him onto the ground.
“Steve isn’t your typical military Sub.”
Because of the gym? Because of his reaction? And why now?  Why was Stark—unless something had happened yesterday to lead up to it. Had Pepper said something to Stark after breakfast? Was that why she’d come back? She’d been incredibly kind to him during breakfast, but maybe that had been an act. What if she didn’t approve of Steve? Stark had said she liked him, but that didn’t make it true.
Tony’s eyebrows had curved up, and the expression on his face was surprised and almost . . . hopeful. Although maybe Steve was reading too much into it. Maybe he was seeing what he wanted to see. “Thank you for letting me know,” Tony said quietly.
Tony helped Steve roll on his left side, his insides churning, little shivers starting to run through his body by the time he was finally situated to Tony’s satisfaction.
He glanced down, reassuring himself that he at least didn’t have any stains on his clothes and that he wasn’t too rumpled. He even looked mostly presentable since he’d had to go into work—not that Tony had ever complained about the clothes Steve normally wore, or that worried about his own attire. Tony tended to wear what he wanted, be it a Tshirt and jeans one day, or a bespoke suit the next.
“Not by choice—”
“Are you alright?” Natasha asked softly, and Steve looked at her in surprise. He hadn’t noticed her come up. He’d been trying to give Dr. Martin and her husband what privacy he could in the small jet, but he couldn’t help but overhear them sometimes, and their words to each other made his heart ache with sympathy.
“Alright,” Steve said, looking hopeful enough to break Tony’s heart all over again.
“No!” Steve said, trying to close his legs, almost panicked at the thought that Tony would leave him like this, wracked with desire and unable to do anything about it.
Up on his knees.
“It’s not going to be that bad!  I’ll be there, too, and I’ll field all the difficult questions.  Just . . . be yourself.  It’ll be fine.  And, um, don’t flinch or anything when I kiss you.  Okay, so that’s it then,” Tony said, leaning forward to put his cup into a holder
, I—”
or the
Maybe it would’ve been kinder if Tony had put him on his knees or on his back, tied him down so Steve had something physical to fight against when the desperation became much. But Tony wanted to be able to see every flex of muscle, every shiver of arousal, wanted to be able to touch and tease and hurt Steve as much as he could bear. He wanted to drive Steve past the edge of self-control until he was nearly mad from the barrage of sensations, and how could he do that if half of Steve’s body was unavailable to him?
And maybe, if Tony took his pound of flesh and forgave him, then … then maybe Steve could finally allow himself to listen to the words Tony had been about to say.
Not really, he decided.
“Everything alright?” Tony asked, enough concern in his voice that Steve suspected he needed to work on his acting skills. He’d never been good about hiding that he was upset.
“I am a delight. You know, speaking of lavishing Subs with gifts—”
"You're going to begrudge a man who's gone without sleep for over forty hours one measly cup of coffee?"
“Thank you,” Steve said, even knowing it would make Tony uncomfortable, because he couldn’t not say it, and maybe it really didn’t mean much to Tony—although Steve didn’t believe that was true—but it meant something to him.
“It will. Dr. Strange is worried that being a wolf isn’t good for you, that if he spends too much time looking for an alternate cure, it’ll make things more difficult in the long run.”
He raises his glass in a silent toast to the vacant seat across from him.  It’s the only reason he sees the shape out of the corner of his eye.
“Yeah, well, things in Botswana went a lot faster than expected, so I get to lounge around for a few weeks before I have to go out again,” she said, setting her tray down across from him.
“That’s what I’ve been saying!” he said and took a few whacks at the training dummy since it was there.

say no—but oh, how he wanted to.
“So glad we had this talk, Steve!” Tony said cheerfully, already moving, and he clapped him on the shoulder and ushered him out of his room, and if there was some resistance, well, who could say for sure? He just knew that he didn’t want Steve to have an epiphany about what he’d just divulged any time soon and
Also, OMG, GUYS, THIS HAS 3K KUDOS. How does that even happen? I'm so happy. Thank you.
. He would swear that Dr. Edwards would’ve been done by now, but Dr. Stark rubs against him again and again and again, his fingers trying to get deeper and deeper, so much so that Steve has to push back in order to keep from moving away from the pressure.
“What?” Steve says, and oh jeez, he sounds like a broken record.
“Later,” Steve said, meaning to be self-conscious because they were talking about him masturbating—but flinching instead as Tony brushed over another ticklish area. He saw a flash of amusement in Tony’s expression. He

Tony keeps getting little flashes of what his Angel tastes like through his suckers, and it’s distracting as hell. At first he thought he was just getting hungry, but he quickly realizes that’s not it when he gets stirrings in a place somewhat lower than his stomach.

“You did
“That’s just because I did all the work,” said another voice, and Steve glanced back quickly. He hadn’t even noticed Clint. “What’s up, Steve?”
“Yeeeees,” he said at last.
“Pffft, you think they aren’t used to this by now?  Where do you think I got it from in the first place?”

8/9/14 - I sincerely apologize to everyone who's waiting for me to update Nostalgia. I haven't forgotten it! Nor do I plan to abandon it. I just suffered a bout of insanity and signed up for Avengers RBB and the Cap_Ironman BB, so I'm writing a bunch, just not this. >_> But! As soon as I'm done with those, I will update this first thing! So please be patient with me, and I'll be back as soon as I can.
Tony has to swallow, the saliva pooling in his mouth.
“Honor,” he said, and Tony nodded.
It was hours later before he swung by the living room again, long past the time he would’ve expected Steve to be awake, which was why he was so surprised to find him sitting on the couch, reading.
He erases what he’d been planning to say for,
Tony laughed softly. “Eager?”
“It’s okay, Tony,” Steve said, and he wondered if Tony was smelling the lube Steve had used to get himself ready. His face burned at the thought, and he didn’t mean to clench up, but he could feel some leaking out in response. Fuck. He’d hurried the best he could since time was of the essence, and he probably hadn’t prepped enough for it to be comfortable, but it’d get the job done.
He’d thought that
Why though? Did he want to be part of the Avengers’ Initiative that much? Steve could understand him taking Nick up on the deal in order to secure his place, but Nick had already given him an out. Stark could’ve locked Steve in his room for the next three months and still be guaranteed a position on the team. Instead, other than the hour or so he’d been gone in the morning after their argument—which a small part of Steve was starting to feel slightly uncomfortable about—Stark had been almost glued to his side all day.
He helped Steve climb out.
Later on, most of his physicals had been done in the presence of so many other people—potential enlistees or soldiers or a roomful of doctors eager to poke and prod him for themselves—that it hadn’t mattered he didn’t have someone there specifically for him. But now there was Stark, someone who barely knew him—barely
“You’ll wear the collar I give you, as well as a muzzle, ears, mittens, and a butt-plug tail, but nothing else. Puppies don’t wear clothes, so neither will you.”
Dr. Stark apparently has the same problem, the knuckles of his hand pressing tightly against Steve’s hole as he tries to get deeper.
Better that they should share this, Tony realized, a moment frozen in time, pure and perfect.
.  What else was I supposed to do, let Fury pawn him off on some other Dom who’d probably keep him chained to the bed all the time?”
“What?”
He’s going to suffocate himself. It’s the only option at this point.
Stark was in no condition to handle a weapon, the drugs making him sweat and babble, and Steve had to support him with one arm as Stark’s coordination deteriorated.  He continued to tell Steve where to go, however, and Steve kept following his directions, putting his faith in Stark to get them out as quickly as possible.
“Yeah.”
Someone knocked on his front door, and he shook his head to clear the image, banishing his odd thoughts.
“Yes, ma’am,” he said, tipping his head respectfully in her direction. “We’re here to rescue you and your husband.”
for example).  Tony Stark had impulse problems, which okay, yeah, but this was different!  Captain fucking America was two elevators, seven hallways, and fifteen doors away from him, and if he had to wait one more day, just one more, he’d go batshit insane, would pull a Bruce Banner on them, would—would—he didn’t know what he’d do, but it wouldn’t be pretty.
And Steve hadn’t known, and even if Tony had bothered to tell him, it wouldn’t have mattered. Steve had been dead set on hightailing it out of there, and he hadn’t thought twice about leaving Tony behind.
“What does it look like I’m doing?”
And to add insult to injury—seriously, he was going to have so many bruises tomorrow—Steve made it all look ridiculously easy. Like there was something wrong with

“I’m sorry,” Stark said at last, his voice much softer than it’d been seconds before. He didn’t turn around. “I should’ve been paying more attention.”

sound to mark that he’d been there at all.  Although from all the stories he’d heard, Captain America was supposed to be extremely self-effacing, so maybe he wasn’t thinking Tony was passing up all that and a bag of chips, maybe he was surprised Tony wasn’t looking for a Sub, but whatever, because seriously?  Hot.
Even now, looking back, he could justify each and every action, because he hadn’t known, hadn’t had any way of knowing what would happen, and maybe he could’ve put more trust in Nick and in Tony, but he’d never been one to blindly go along with what he’d been told to do.
“How are things going between you two anyway?” she asked, perching on the side of the bathtub.
No. He couldn’t think of that.
that it turned everything smooth and slick, liquid heat coating Steve’s thighs and sliding down his hips and between his cheeks, Tony’s hot huffs of air making it feel even better. When Tony curled his tongue around Steve’s cock at the same time as he licked, Steve shouted and arched off the floor, even with Tony holding him down.
“Yeah,” he sighed.
bracelets, no matter what Pepper said—to call the MARK VII to him, but then the doors opened.
“Don’t worry about that right now. It can wait for a little while longer. Are you alright?” Tony asked, his eyes searching Steve’s, and Steve nodded uncertainly. Tony wasn’t acting upset, but after seeing how good he was at hiding things, Steve wasn’t sure if that was actually true or just what he wanted to believe. “Thank you for telling me what you needed. It means a lot to me that you would.”
He knew he’d done everything right, and that felt … that felt better than it should’ve, considering how small the task itself was.
It’s not completely honest, he knows, and he imagines it’s going to skew his results, but he can’t bring himself to confess. Right now, Dr. Stark thinks he’s suffering and doesn’t consider him some kind of sexual deviant, and Steve would like to keep it that way for as long as he can.
He didn’t think he’d ever been with someone who enjoyed being rimmed as much as Steve did, and it spurred Tony on to new heights as he fucked Steve on his tongue, as Steve started grinding against his face to get him even deeper.
ETA: I forgot to mention that I took the movie lines from the Avengers script at imsdb.com.
Or maybe it was just that he wanted to be the one taking care of Tony for a change, Steve thought as Tony carefully wiped a trail of water from his forehead before it could reach his eyes. It just always felt like Tony was the one doing things for him and not the other way around. Sure, Steve had known Subs who'd dreamed about being pampered by their Doms, but he’d never been one of them. He’d always worked hard for all the good things in his life, and he couldn’t stop the niggling feeling that if he didn’t
“I didn’t think you wanted me back. I was trying to respect that,” Steve said, all wounded eyes, and bullshit. Bull. Shit.
Just not like this.
“I don’t have a look.”
“Can you explain why, Dr. Strange?” Natasha asked after a pregnant pause where everyone avoided each other’s eyes.
“Tony?”
“Are you
He started with light kisses, soft but quick, along the edges of Steve’s mouth, against parted lips that tried to chase him as he went, and he finally had to grip the hair at the back of Steve’s head to keep him still—something Steve obviously appreciated if the shuddery gasp he gave were anything to go by. But it was when Tony covered Steve’s neck with his other hand, forcing his jaw up, that Steve outright moaned, and Tony gave up the teasing and got serious, relishing the way Steve’s jaw moved against his fingers as their tongues slid together.

-kay.  This wasn’t really what Tony had signed on for.  It was one thing to talk about taking on a new Sub—which wasn’t he’d signed on for either.  Fury had just requested a meeting about one of his dad’s old projects, and he’d stupidly agreed—another thing entirely to watch someone being taken apart right in front of him, and maybe he should go—
There was an alarming crunching sound, and Steve jerked, looking down at his phone. Oh, shit.
Which.
Had Tony finally gotten what he wanted?
The elevator doors opened, and there was Tony, waiting for him just like JARVIS had said.
much attention, in case it gets him in trouble.
“Steve!” he yelled, because Steve was a nice guy, right?  He liked kids and puppies and was liked in return.  He’d know what to do.  “
Tony swallowed, clearing his throat. “So what’s this about food? ‘Cause I’m starving.”
He cupped his hand, bringing it to his mouth and huffed into it, quickly breathing it in. He couldn’t actually tell if he had bad breath or not, but better to be safe than sorry, he thought, and hurried to his room.
He’d wondered if Steve had noticed that neither Pepper nor Happy had been by since Steve had come back, and apparently he had. He was just glad Steve didn’t know that two of the most important people in Tony’s life both hated Steve for what his leaving had done and would do to Tony in the future. That sometimes Tony resented him for it too.
Steve blinked, looking from the rigid line of Stark’s shoulders to the affronted face of Dr. Reynolds. Stark wasn’t exactly blocking him, being smaller and shorter than Steve, but . . .
“Hold onto the headboard,” he said, and fuck, Steve was a thing of beauty as he stretched out his arms over his head, the muscles in his back moving smoothly. Tony thought he could stare at the dip of his waist for hours, the rise and curve of his buttocks, the firm lines of his thighs as he flexed against the bed.
Tony’s eyebrows lifted slightly.  People had a tendency to mistype Tony.  He was on the short side of average, which didn’t mean anything since height had no bearing on being a Dom or a Sub, but Hollywood had messed people up enough that they assumed under six foot tall meant Sub.  Also, he was sarcastic, but in a cheeky way rather than a domineering way, so once again, Sub.  (If he had a dollar for every time a Dom had said they’d planned to beat the disrespect out of him, he’d be a . . . well, let’s just say he’d be even richer than he already was.)  And he was talkative.  And loud.  And he smiled a lot.  And was kind of handsy without even realizing it.  And he pouted when he didn’t get his way.  And he liked to wear stylish clothes when he was out.  And got his hair and nails done and went in for massages.  And maybe if it’d been just one or two things, it would’ve been fine, but when added up all together?
I always like to post something around my birthday, and normally I’d post a chapter of Nostalgia, but I decided to go with Fever this year. Feel free to give me all the kudos and comments as a present … ;)
“I could tell you were deep beneath the surface, and I tried diving, which is how I lost all my things, but I couldn’t get very far, so I just kept flying in circles until I couldn’t anymore.”
Certainly not Steve.
Thankfully, he’s lying on his stomach, so at least he doesn’t have to reveal his inappropriate (appropriate?) reaction.  Considering the draft he can feel from the air conditioner, however, and especially
There was no way in hell Tony would say no.
“Whenever you are,” he said instead and then took a deep breath, following Tony into the elevator.
“That’s all well and good for you, but what’s in it for me?” he asked, like the answer wasn’t obvious.  He’d watched the reels.  No one could watch Captain America in action and not go a little gaga for him.  Even without all the shared (but not really) history they had, Captain America was a prize all on his own.
“Oh. Yeah. Thank you,” Steve says, even though he doesn’t want the drape,
“Yes,” Steve said hoarsely, but he looked tired—peaceful mostly, but like he didn’t have any energy left, and Tony had been there. A really intense orgasm could knock a person out, and Steve had had not one, but two in the span of a short period of time. He looked at the end of his rope.
Damn it.
, overwhelmed and desperate, like the best part of a porno with none of the acting behind it. He kept jerking away with pained whines, like he couldn’t handle it, and then coming right back, opening up under Tony’s tongue and flexing around him. But while Steve’s hole was starting to relax, the tension in the rest of his body just increased, his muscles getting more and more rigid until his thighs were nearly damn well vibrating. But no matter how far gone Steve was, he never moved out of the position Tony had demanded of him, kept his hands right where they were on the wall, and Tony rewarded him for it, reaching up to tug and pinch at Steve’s nipples—doing it even harder when Steve just got louder in response.
Other people might have felt weird about having an ex in the bathroom with them, but he could barely remember a time when Pepper hadn’t been in his life, and even if the romantic feelings between them had faded, it still felt completely natural for her to be there.
Tony sighed before facing him again. “Look, Steve, don’t get me wrong. You’re a … really nice guy.”
“I’m sorry you had to spend so much money,” Steve said, referring to all the furniture Tony had purchased in order to soothe the manager’s anger.
“Oh, Steve,” Tony says, after a short pause, his voice low and reverent, “just look at you, Sweetheart.” Tony’s fingers circle his hole and then slide into him without resistance, playing with him as he lies there, exhausted and vulnerable.
Everything had changed, however, when he’d found out about Peggy.  She was still alive.  She didn’t have a Sub.
“Alright. Let me explain how this thing works. I’m going to strap you in—three times around each leg, three around each arm, and one around each shoulder—but only because I don’t want you to hurt yourself by moving too much. If you safeword, everything stops, although of course, there’s nothing here that you couldn’t break out of by yourself. As I’m sure you noticed, there’s a dildo beneath you. Once I’m finished, I’m going to secure a band around your waist and then stretch you open and put the tip of the dildo inside of you. That won’t come out until we’re finished. It’s attached to the same mechanism that the band is, and wherever you move, the dildo will go with you—assuming you don’t climb out, although I wouldn’t suggest you do that without my help. The band will be
“Yes.”
How would Stark react, though, to Steve refusing a medical check-up? What would he think? How would it affect Steve’s plans?
He knocked and had to control his squeak of excitement when the door opened and Captain America—
It’s just like his glands all over again. “Kind of,” he says weakly, because he knows what comes next, and he grips the sides of the table with his hands.
“We’re getting him as we speak,” he said, because he knew Natasha, and he knew she wouldn’t fail. “But we have to hurry.” He took a few slow steps toward her. “The jet is waiting to take you out of here.” Nine minutes left. “We’re going to take you home.” He held out his hand.
, which isn’t something Tony would do with someone of his own race, but he’s had sex with Humans before, and it just takes him a second to recall what’s worked in the past.
“I’m sorry, Tony,” he manages to rasp out, “but I—”
It made a tentative hope begin to grow in Steve’s chest—
Almost everyone anyway.  Everyone but Peggy.
different, he decides when he’s bare in front of Dr. Stark, the only things preserving his modesty a thin sheet and a pair of socks. He doesn’t normally have an erection when he’s in public, for instance.
Okay, okay, so he’d lied.  It was a sickness, what could he say?
He had no clue how much time had passed by the time he’d finally collected himself and was ready, and he refused to think about it, because he knew if he did, he’d just make himself worse.
He’d gotten undressed in front of doctors in the past. Completely undressed even. This wasn’t so different from any time before.
“Then you don’t know what it’s like—”
It’d been a long time since he’d felt this ashamed of himself, and he found he hadn’t missed the feeling at all.
breaks
He groaned, covering his face with his pillow. Fuck, he was so screwed.
to you, asshole, and I don’t give a flying fuck what Fury said! You’re not touching him again.”
“You . . .” the man whispered.
There was no response.
He just really wants things to go well with Tony.
He enjoyed the way Steve’s chest expanded as he took in a deep breath.
get a full night’s sleep?” he asked and dodged the hand that had been reaching for his forehead. “I’m not sick,
“Nooo … that’s not ...” Tony takes a deep breath. “Some doctors want the option to have um, attachments. To help omegas during heats. There’s a small but still significant number of patients who need to be monitored during a heat, and a lot of doctors would prefer to keep that in-house instead of sending their patients somewhere else, which can be infeasible because of price or distance or what have you.”
“Okay, so I had to build a new suit for this,” Tony told him once they’re on the ground, casually, like wasn’t important that he’d spent millions—billions?—on something specifically for Steve.
“You’re leaving me no choice but to—”
but barely paid attention to the movie, wondering what she’d do if he put his arm around her shoulders and jumping every time his fingers got tangled with hers in the popcorn.  On their third date, she gave him his first kiss, and he didn’t think life could get any better.
He knew, though, that just because Tony had told him eight, it was no guarantee that he’d actually call for him then, knew that more than likely, Tony would make him wait, just like he had yesterday. What else was he supposed to do, though?
, and it’s a distinction that he appreciates.
But if the only alternative was to sit back and watch Steve hunched over in misery, then Tony would bear whatever the hell he had to and ten times more besides as long as there was even a chance of comforting him. So Tony slid off the couch clumsily, falling to his knees next to Steve and clenching his teeth against the resulting pain, and he wrapped his arms around him, desperately hoping his shakiness wasn’t obvious—his heart nearly freezing when Steve tensed.
“Tony,” he began, not knowing what to say, what he
“That was really loud,” Tony said, sounding amused, and the shame pulsed inside of Steve. “What if someone hears you, Steve? What if someone
But a couple of seconds later, he hears, “Steve Rogers?”
For the prompts “Sharing body heat” (cap_ironman bingo) and “huddling for warmth” (avengers_tables).
Oh fuck.
“Trust me, I don’t want to be hurt either,” Tony said cheerfully.
Steve had eaten with Tony frequently enough to know how he liked his sandwiches, and he assembled three of them, putting them on a plate, as well as grabbing a bottle of water. It was quick, which was important, and besides, there was no reason to make Tony suffer because of his cooking.
“How long are you going to be gone?” Tony asked in the garage as Steve loaded his pack and shield on his motorcycle.
When Tony woke up the next day, he stared up at the ceiling, eyes dry and itchy, and he thought,
“Look, I get it, alright? I used to be a playboy too before Pepper.”
Tony was unbinding him. He was going to let him up.
Steve stared down at his lap long enough that Tony began to think that Steve wasn’t going to respond at all. Tony realized that his safewording and Steve discovering the condition of his back had made whatever guilt Steve felt all that much more acute, and that with everything that had happened, Steve wouldn’t be in a good headspace, but if Steve couldn’t even—
His eyes skipped away for just a second, but inwardly he sighed; she’d probably caught that. “Sometimes.”
, but Stark’s expression was too open, not irritated or amused enough to go along with the comment the way Steve was imagining, and he realized he was just referring to the fact that he’d been on the computer twice today.
It was embarrassing how eager he was, but he just . . . he honestly had no idea what to expect, but he wanted all of it. All at once. Immediately. It was ridiculous, but he wanted everything
He was a mess of drool and other fluids by the time Tony finished, and he swore his stomach felt swollen, but even with all of that, he just wanted to sleep, no matter that Tony was still stuck inside of him. He hadn't expected it to be so ... intense, although he probably should have. His muscles felt weak and rubbery, his knees had gone numb at some point, and his ass was raw and throbbing, but as far as he was concerned, those were problems for later, when he could string more than two thoughts together. For right now, he just wanted to savor his soreness and the little flashes of pleasure that shivered through him and rest.
He wasn’t thrilled about the hide-and-seek, but it gave him time to figure out a plan of attack. Repetition would only help Tony, so he was going to have to come up with several different methods to take him by surprise. He’d also have to be mindful of how hard he threw, since unlike Tony, he hadn’t had time to prepare any alternatives. Still, the armor should keep Tony safe as long as Steve was careful.
What if Steve had thought.
“I’ve noticed,” Tony said dryly, but he didn’t look particularly upset.
Tony knew that there were a lot of Doms who preferred mouthy Subs, got off on the whole, "oh, you've been such a bad Sub" thing to use as an excuse to bring out the whips.  He, however, had enough sass for a whole stable of Subs, and he didn’t need a reason to take a Sub over his knee, so the Subs he kept company with tended to be discreet.  Refined.  Obedient.
“What did I say about you worrying so much, Steve?” Dr. Stark says, the gently chiding tone of his voice making Steve’s chest tight, and he has to bite his lip to contain the gasp of relief. “Not even in the running for first place, remember? Now, do you think you can keep going? Or do you need to take a break?”
Except after a few meals and several hours of sleep, after waking up again and again just to see Steve still there across from him, Tony had started to wonder. Why would Steve say something like that if he didn’t mean it? What purpose could it possibly serve? Could Steve really feel so guilty that he’d tell Tony he loved him as an … apology of some sort? Tony knew just how much it could panic a Sub when their Dom was furious with them, but Steve wouldn’t have just thrown that out there with nothing behind it.
He glanced at Natasha, wondering if she’d told Clint about him and Tony, but from the way she raised her eyebrows ever so slightly, he guessed she was giving him the option of telling Clint or not. He cleared his throat. It wasn’t the first time he’d told someone by any means—Dr. Saunders, Nick, Natasha, even Peggy—but it still made his heart speed up a little whenever he announced it, the fact that he and Tony were finally together. “Well, Tony’s here.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Are you planning to go back?”
Okay, so I apologize for the two week wait, but I got really sick last weekend, so I spent a few days being miserable and unable to write.
“Well, what about—”
“Where is he now?” he asked dully, wondering if Steve had barricaded himself in his room or if he’d—
Crap, he didn’t think he would ever

. Comments and kudos (for both fics) are much appreciated. <3
Steve’s eyes popped open when he heard the first ring, and he reached out blindly, swiping at the screen before his phone could make any more noise. “Rogers,” he whispered as he got out of bed, trying to be as quiet and unobtrusive as possible. He could feel several small twinges down on his back as he moved—from Tony’s bites, he realized, a swell of contentment in his chest—but he couldn’t focus on them now.
Not because Steve didn’t want to. He did. He thought about it a lot actually. Probably more than was … reasonable … if he were being completely honest. He still hadn’t done it yet, though.
, Tony.  Why not Pepper?  Or Natasha?  Wouldn’t it make more sense to ask one of them?”
Steve made himself a sandwich while he was waiting, no longer in the mood for breakfast foods or for eating much at all really, but knowing his stomach would complain sooner rather than later if he skipped a meal. He put everything away, hesitating a moment on the pancake batter, before deciding to save it for tomorrow, hating the idea of wasting food but without much hope that they’d eat it the next morning. Not if that morning was anything to go by.
There’s a slight hesitation, as if Dr. Stark is wondering if he should stop anyway, no matter what Steve says, but then he hears him sigh. “All right, then I’ll go ahead and check your prostate now.”
“Take care of yourself,” Tony said, his tone and expression seeming to soften for one fraction of a second, there and gone, and then he was turning away.
“And as I said, when you do as you’re told, you can earn rewards. Nothing too big, but something I think you’d like,” Tony said, a gentle smile growing on his lips, easy and free and without any of the tension of the past several days, and Steve thought he’d do anything to keep Tony smiling like that.
Was Tony … was he sick? Had Steve somehow not noticed he was ill? With everything that had happened, he could believe he’d been that blind, but when he thought furiously back over the past hour, he couldn’t remember Tony sniffling or seeming feverish or unusually cold. Was he just tired? Had he not been sleeping?
“What?” Steve asked, not understanding the sudden change in subject, his stomach muscles jumping under Tony’s touch.
He hadn’t broached the idea of Stark being his Dom in name only yet. He’d been waiting, wanting to give them both more time to interact and to show Stark that he was adjusting to his new life. Not that everything was perfect, because it wasn’t, and not that Steve could pretend he was completely over what had happened to him. He wasn’t that good of an actor, and he doubted Stark would’ve believed him anyway. But he’d wanted to show that he was getting better.
“But don’t be surprised if you see something about us soon,” he said, spur of the moment, but it felt like a weight lifting from his shoulders.
“Like this,” Tony said, catching his wrist and drawing him forward until Steve straddled his legs.
I opened up prompts on my tumblr and got this: “This might be cheating on my part but might as well try XD how about a coda or just a small glimpse a few months or years down the road with steve and tony in
, he thought, even though it was a lie, just like he’d lied every time before that when he’d promised he’d start believing in Tony. It had never happened, and now there were no more chances.
“I know,” Steve gasped, his body trembling as it sought some kind of release from the tension ratcheting almost unbearably inside of it.  Any kind of release.  “I know you would,” he tried to say, but it was lost as he cried out in orgasm, Tony’s hands all that kept him together.
“Don’t worry about it,” Tony said, shrugging.  The movement made Steve realize to his horror that Tony’s buttons didn’t match up to the right holes.  How had he missed that?  No wonder she’d kept staring at Tony’s chest. “It’s an investment anyway.  We’re going to be breaking a lot more couches and tables and beds in the years to come,” he said, reaching out to hold Steve’s hand and giving it a quick squeeze.  “Might as well be prepared.”
The answer came to him, and he had to put his hand down to stabilize himself.
“Tony’s coming?”
“You were just trying to do the right thing,” he said, surprised by the apology, although maybe he shouldn’t have been. Stark wasn’t . . . Stark wasn’t anything like he’d expected. “It’s not your fault,” he said, and this time he believed it.
“He took a two hour nap this morning at approximately five a.m..”
Tony had fucked up enough already. He didn’t want to make things worse between them.
“I’m sure it’s fine,” Steve said flatly, and oh jeez, he was still annoyed with Tony trying to touch Natasha’s breasts.  And possibly propositioning Thor’s body.  Whatever, special circumstances!  It wasn’t like this kind of stuff happened to them every day.
Fuck.
didn’t want anything serious.
Tony tended to avoid Omegas when he could.
Just not this particular Angel apparently. Or at least not well.
Once he looks away.
“I knew I shouldn’t have let you drive yourself this morning,” Happy said, shaking his head.  “This is what happens when I leave you alone.”
When the cinnamon rolls arrived, he asked JARVIS to let Tony know and then set the box on the counter, the sweet smell pervading the room.
He didn’t think of anything beyond what he had to do, getting a mug, pressing the appropriate buttons, wiping down the machine to make sure there weren’t any drips, grabbing a napkin …
“Look, I do feel a little bad about all of this. You probably would’ve met your own Tony one day and been really happy together, if I hadn’t come along. I can’t give him back to you, but I did leave you a bank account with a tidy nest egg—”
Since I haven’t heard from you yet, I’m going to assume you
Steve glanced over to see Dr. Saunders looking at his leg, which had been bouncing and down.
-----
hoping happens now?” Tony said, curt and impatient, and Steve tried not to panic at the expression on his face. He hadn’t looked at Steve like that since the very beginning when they’d first been forced together, like Tony didn’t know why he was even there, like Steve was wasting his time.
The only reason Steve lets go of Tony’s hand is in order to turn around and lock the door. His friends have a habit of walking into his apartment without so much as knocking, and while that normally wouldn’t be a problem, he’d rather everyone had clothes on the first time they met.
Steve smiled, happiness making his face brighten. “If Pepper’s still around, she should come too. I haven’t seen her at all since I’ve been back.”
Get started with wh—?
. And Steve didn’t understand, but he
He was almost tempted to open the door and take Stark up on the offer he’d made after dinner to watch a movie—the images so crisp and clear, it seemed that he could reach out and touch the bark of a tree or the fabric of a person’s sleeve—or go to his gym downstairs, where Stark apparently not only had a full-sized boxing ring but an indoor pool as well.
There’s a slight pause, like Steve’s debating with himself whether or not to actually do this, but then his shoulders loosen, and Tony captures the “whatever, fuck it” moment as Steve whips his towel off, bridging the distance between them with intent.
“Hi, JARVIS.”
“Damn it,” Tony sighed.  “Foiled again.”
“Yeah, thanks, Buck,” he says, distracted, and he doesn’t know. He just doesn’t know.
Tony’s seen a lot of Humans, both from far away on passing ships and up close and personal when they’ve had representatives visit Atlantis, but he’s never spotted so much as a silhouette of a real Angel before.
“I think we should get married,” Tony announced as he let himself into Steve’s apartment, plopping next to him on the couch.
“Good,” she said, and he narrowed his eyes, because she was playing with the edge of her skirt, and the only time Pepper fidgeted was when she knew he wasn’t going to like what she had to say.
There’s a part of him that wishes he could see Dr. Stark’s face instead of the drape, wishes he could watch Dr. Stark staring at how the sheet clings and cups Steve’s most intimate places. Most of Steve, however, is hugely relieved that he can’t because in all likelihood, Dr. Stark isn’t looking, or if he is, it’s not with the kind of thoughts Steve wants him to have, and he thinks it’d be devastating to have proof that Dr. Stark isn’t interested.
. . .
Steve had been so angry when he’d first seen them, his fingers shaking with rage, and his first instinct had been to make sure Tony was okay and then hunt down whoever had done it. That someone would hurt Tony, that someone would
Far from it really.
“Tony?” he gasps and realizes he’s got his arms wrapped around Tony.  He lets go in a hurry and tries to shift away, but that’s when he realizes he’s
So he didn’t bother with a second finger, just covered the vibrator with lube and rested it against his hole for a second as he took another long breath. Then he pushed in just the tip, wincing slightly as he popped it in and out before eventually turning it on.
Steve grabbed onto him, gasping out, “Your back—”
No, no, that was impossible. They had all seen him die, had buried him in Arlington, and had mourned him for the past ten years. There was no way that-that
There was still a hint of skepticism on Captain America’s face, so Tony wasn’t surprised by his vague answer of, “There was an . . . accident.  I’m having a . . . bad reaction to it.”
“We terminated it on the grounds that you didn’t give proper consent and therefore couldn’t be bound by the terms of the contract.” He decided glasses were for pussies. Who needed glasses anyway? He took a long swig of scotch.
know what a computer was. Vaguely. Nick had just begun allowing him to use one under the watchful eye of a SHIELD-issued Dom, and while he thought of them as more a glorified typewriter/calculator, he’d definitely seen the appeal of the Internet.

Unless Tony didn’t think he could do it, in which case it meant something completely different—
“Just what are you thinking about?” Tony asked, curious and amused, and Steve froze. Which made it easier for Tony to run his fingertips through the little puddle of pre-come that was on Steve’s stomach. Steve’s cock flexed, as if offering itself up, but in vain.
Except then the meeting went to hell in a handbasket, and Steve was on the run.
him—”
The first time he’d killed someone up close, slitting a guy’s throat in the middle of the night, he’d kept eye contact the whole time.  He’d seen the fear, the panic, the anger and denial, and he’d let his victim see him, too, the excitement of the hunt, the worry that he was going to be caught, the rush that went through him at the kill, and even the guilt that he was taking a life.  The connection between the two of them had been amazing, profane and profound, and with the body still warm, he’d known that he’d wanted to do it again.  He’d needed to do it again.
Steve twists around carefully, making sure to keep everything in place as much as he can before lying down.  A waft of scent rises up nevertheless, and he has to turn his head to the side, because it feels like his head will explode if he looks at Dr. Stark.
“That sounds good, thank you.” He looked down and then back, took one step away and then stopped. “Just . . . before you go . . . Tony, I—” He let out a huff of air and took off his cowl. This was something that was better done without any masks on his face.
him want you! What, you’ve lost your ability to charm people now?” she asked at his expression, her words laced with challenge. “You’re so used to everyone coming to you that you can’t seduce someone anymore? I’ve seen how much effort you put into one-night stands, Tony, and you don’t even
Steve gasps, his hands tightening around the wood so hard, it creaks.
As soon as the door closes, he gets undressed, hiding the dance belt he specifically bought for this in his jeans and then detaching his heat pad as quietly as possible before wrapping it in paper towels and throwing it into the biohazard waste. He can’t believe he has to wear a pad to his checkup, but he would literally leak through his clothes otherwise.
Steve though, Steve is special, and the fact that he thinks so is enough to make him bury his head in his hands and groan.
Steve searches Dr. Stark’s face, but he doesn’t look like a man who’s trying to avoid breathing, nor does it appear that he’s smeared anything on his upper lip to mask Steve’s smell. Apparently, he really had gone out in order to be helpful, and Steve’s doubts scatter in a rush of flustered pleasure. Dr. Stark had brought him blankets. He’s not in heat, so it’s not a nesting present or anything, but still. The consideration means a lot to Steve, and he blushes the whole time he’s thanking Dr. Stark and settling down.
Steve hadn’t thought much about it at first. It’s a plain, silvery ring, and it sits on the fourth finger of his right hand, just a bit loose. Tony’s worn it from the first day that he’d barged into Steve’s life, bumping into him as Steve was leaving his apartment building and spilling his iced coffee over the both of them.
Tony raised his hands and took a step back.  “I was just trying to—”
Because he was sorry to go? Because he was saying goodbye? What?
into the air.
He hadn’t considered, however, how his sudden revelation would affect Tony. Although if he had, he would’ve hoped Tony’d be happy … except that wasn’t what had happened.
He didn’t like having to let go of one of Tony’s hands in order to walk, but he knew he was being ridiculous. He felt … clingy, which he obviously wasn’t going to mention to Tony, but it was true nonetheless. It was the second time he was going to be punished, and he was anxious about the discipline itself as well as the possibility of screwing it up again. Holding onto Tony and basking in his voice and smile was incredibly comforting, and while Steve knew he didn’t deserve it, he couldn’t help but want it all the same.
But then, Captain America had been buried in ice for the past seventy years, so.
“Tony,” he said, debating whether he should set the items down on a clean spot—except there were no clean spots, or at least, none that didn’t make him nervous. He doubted a little spilled food would cause a problem, but then again, it might.
Not that Steve deserved sensitivity when he was basically an asshole incarnate, but fine, Tony had always wanted to say he’d acted like the better man, and now he could.
It burned going in, but nowhere near as much as he would’ve thought considering the circumstances and how tense he was, and even though there was pain, it didn’t exactly … hurt.
Steve swallowed heavily, his chest hitching, and he turned his face into Tony’s hand. He could feel the tears quivering at the corner of his eyes, and he hated them, more proof of all the promises he’d broken, to himself, to Tony, of all the things he kept doing wrong.
He can feel another surge of wetness, his ass empty and throbbing, and he has to grab the edges of the table before he does something he’ll regret.
He would’ve said as much, brought up once again that he’d intended it to be a reward as well but that that it’d seemed more like suffering from where he’d been standing … but the thought of putting together that many words was overwhelming. “You wanted to stop,” he said instead, forcing himself to make the effort.
an explanation, that he hadn’t taken one look and decided he couldn’t have a Dom who’d let himself be beaten—
“Is that alright?” Tony asked, taking a step towards the living room.
Word count: 1,030
He nodded and sat down in his chair, eyes automatically glancing down at his watch.
“Mr. Stark is waiting for you in the living room.”
He thought about calling Tony then, but his flight was scheduled to leave in two hours, and it wasn’t the type of conversation that he could ask Tony to put on pause so he could finish packing. Besides, at this point, he thought he owed Tony the chance to yell at him face-to-face.
Not that he’d wanted to see Tony again.

It was a struggle to wipe away all the doubts that were clamoring to be heard, but he concentrated on Steve, warm and eager beneath him, on remembering the feelings of surprise and budding joy that had clung to him all day.
make that expression, not for him.
“But I can try,” he added, glancing quickly at Tony and then down. He didn’t want to disappoint him, and it’d been a while since he’d gone without masturbating. Maybe it wouldn’t be that bad now, he thought, even as he remembered the heavy, sickening feeling that had spread through his body before he’d understood what he’d needed to do.
Steve hadn’t meant anything.  Had he?  Because it had sounded like . . .
“I don’t like the pattern,” Tony said dismissively.  “It makes me look fat.”
“What do you expect me to do in order to
“My name’s Steve by the way,” the guy said, sticking his hand out, palm tilted up slightly instead of to the side, like he was expecting Tony to give him something, or like he was asking for something from him.  And he wasn’t looking at him all funny anymore, but he was still
“Iron Man will be there.”
He tried not to get his hopes up just because Tony had let him nap in his bed. It’d obviously made more sense to leave him there than take him all the way to his own room after all, and it wasn’t as if letting him rest there was the same as inviting him to spend the night.
“Steve?”
“Whatever you want, Tony.”
The ride back to New York was much more relaxed then the morning one had been, helped probably by the way they’d sometimes look at each other and start snickering. He wasn’t the only one with paint streaks, and he’d even managed to get his handprint on Tony’s mask. In pink.
Steve shifted on the examination table, the plastic crinkling loudly underneath him, and he glanced at Stark before he could stop himself.
“You want to be part of the Avengers Initiative, Stark, you’ll take Captain Rogers with you.”
,” Steve said, lowering his hands so they hovered over his mouth. He blinked rapidly, and even though Tony’s view was obstructed, he could see Steve’s fragile attempt at a smile. “The very best, Tony.”
She let out what was probably the longest exhale known to man.
“And he hasn’t said anything since then?”
Bucky sighs, long and drawn-out, and nothing Steve’s said hasn’t been true, so he doesn’t know what’s he done to deserve it.
“Just—just any of it,” Steve said hoarsely, slowly bending one leg to make himself that much more accessible to whatever Tony wanted to do to him. “All of it.”
Steve.”
, Steve gets weirdly fascinated by celebrities and can spend hours on IMDb.  “How couples decide to make a—a sex tape, and then suddenly everyone in the world has seen them naked!"
“Cap has gone into worse situations with less intel.  He’ll agree,” Fury said with a level of confidence in his voice that could only come from being a Dom in the military talking about a lower-ranked Sub.  If Tony had ever tried to tell one of the Subs under his employ that he’d be deciding their intimate life for them, they’d have had the National Association for Submissives’ Rights on him faster than the suit could go from zero to one hundred.
Steve’s in the middle of composing a reply when Bucky writes,
And yet. Somehow he’s gotten away with it.
Steve
“Wow. That’s amazing, Tony!” He’d had no idea Tony was so accomplished.
“Okay,” Steve whispered and followed blindly behind him.
It’s obvious that he’s resolutely ignoring the camcorder, and Tony’s totally fine with that, prefers it in fact, because he doesn’t really want Steve to act any differently, doesn’t want to have to cajole and seduce a hesitant and blushing Steve every step of the way like he’s a virgin or something.  Although.  Yeah.  There are . . . that’s kind of tempting actually.
, maybe they hadn’t heard about Tony and Pepper’s breakup, or maybe they worried they’d get back together, but for whatever reason, they modified the spell so the only way to break it is for him to have sex instead.”
“Steve?”
It wasn’t that Tony was trying to
“Just weird.”
him.”
—and he held on longer than he intended.
He went to where Tony was sitting on the bed and tried not to think about it.
Steve was crying, and Tony didn’t know what to do.
“Thank you!” She walked over to her desk and opened a drawer. “I spend most of my free time catching up on psychology articles, so I always feel behind on what’s going on in the world.”
Steve tried to nod, tried to acknowledge Tony’s request, but he didn’t know if he succeeded, orgasm turning everything hazy and white.
Head bowed, body cringing in on itself as Tony rushed in.
“It’s just my luck that I get handcuffed to the epitome of male perfection, and I am too drugged to do anything about it.”
Finally, I just have to say I'm so impressed with myself for how much I've been writing recently. I've posted probably 12-15K in the last few weeks, which is awesome. More impressive, however, is how so many of you guys have stuck with me and this fic through the feast and the famine. Thank you.
Just minutes ago, Tony had told Steve that Doms weren’t perfect, but he’d never felt the pain of that truth as much as when Steve just sat there, hiding from him, defeat etched in every line.
It feels
to hear what you were going to say, but I just—”
“You don’t know my parents, Steve,” Tony said darkly.  “It’s always something with them.  ‘What do you mean it’s going to take you two years to graduate college and three to get your doctorate?  You want to start your own company?  Why would you do that when you could take over after your father?  You’re only bringing in ten million a year; how do you survive?  Do you have to wear sunglasses all the time?  You look like a drug dealer.’”  He sniffed.  “As if I could ever look anything other than amazing.  Seriously, it never ends with them.  When they started hinting about the marriage thing, I thought—I just wanted to get them off my back, you know?”
Well, obviously that was what Tony wanted him to wear, since Tony had packed the bag and was showing it to him.
The smile on Tony’s face was the widest Steve had seen since before he’d left on his mission. It was obvious that Tony knew exactly what he was thinking, which probably should have mattered more to Steve, but how could it when Tony looked that happy? It left him dazed enough that he didn’t react when Tony moved behind him, but the click of what had to presumably be the lube bottle made him jump.
“You’d think SHIELD would—” He stopped, eyes darting to the gown in Steve’s hand, to his face and the door and then back. “You know what, nevermind,” Stark mumbled, hunching over his phone and shifting so his back was more towards him. Steve could hear the music get louder.
He should’ve given up on him a long time ago.
Now, however, he couldn’t manage even that much, couldn’t think about anything other than Tony, on what had happened yesterday and the days before it, on what Tony had been doing last night without him. He was ashamed of himself for being wrapped up in his own problems when Bucky was out there, alone. If Steve were better, he’d have found Bucky before Hydra did, or somehow realized that he was still alive, or done more to make him recognize him. But he hadn’t. He’d failed. Just like he’d failed Tony.
