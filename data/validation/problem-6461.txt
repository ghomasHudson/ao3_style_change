“J, roll the footage,” said the man who was skating on thin ice. Bucky threw a glare his way before turning his attention to the screen, feeling sick at what he saw.
“I’m missing someone,” the brunette grumbled as he tried to sit up more. Joey closed her eyes at that, wondering if not for the first time if she should’ve stayed home for this.
“I’m Dr. Stephen Strange, your mate’s surgeon. Your Omega is okay and will make a full recovery, he’ll just have a few scars on his chest.”
Emerson considered telling the boys about the tiny life jackets in the shed, but decided she’d rather watch them suffer.
“No Howard. There will be no such thing done under my roof. You will not commit such an act against our Lord, Howard. I will not allow it!”
“You pay your legal team the big bucks for a reason, give them a chance to do their job, alright?” He glared at her for a moment, hating how damn smart she was.
“You done milking it?” Rhodey asked after coming to a halt by the bed, eyes scanning for any real injuries.
“No, I called his cock ‘perfect,’ get your facts straight. I thought that’d be easier for a hetero…” Before Rhodey could retaliate, the pair heard tiny footsteps approaching.
So he blames his sleep deprivation when he was startled by a knock on their door late one afternoon.
Peter did a quick eye roll before responding, “Happy is driving the limo, I have the tickets, made the reservation for dinner and have his boutonniere. I promise to be home by one am, won’t touch any alcohol or drugs offered to me, remember my manners and only sip the koolaid of the Satan-worshipping cult –” Steve smacked the back of Peter’s head, eliciting a “my hair!” from the sarcastic teen.
“I hated you. And I’m so sorry for that. The truth is…I hated myself and couldn’t punish myself any further – so I took it out on you. For what I thought you did. I told myself you were a monster like your father. And that’s not true,” she added before looking up at Emerson again.
“Oh Daci what about this one?” Peter asked her, offering her a bow and arrow set - where the arrows have suction cups but wasn’t flimsy like most kid toys. The last thing he saw before making his way to the kitchen was her eyes lighting up brighter than he’d ever seen.
Steve did his best to keep his eyes on the phone, not wanting to see the rejection or disappointed look from the pup.
"You're asking a kid to like a bad guy, it's not going to happen and it's why I decided we'd never tell him." The light bulb went off in the arachnid's mind.
“Jolly Green Giant means Hulk isn’t ready to turn back to Bruce yet, so we come and play with him until he tires out.” She still stood frozen as Tony walked past him to Steve, who was laying down and smiled when he saw his husband.
His husband curled his arms around the brunette, who figured he’d start the conversation since he established earlier – they are both stubborn mules.
Thank god Cap and Tony weren’t here, Peter thought, tossing another piece of kindling on the campfire. The Avengers co-leaders were people he respected greatly—practically fathers to him, really—but they also were kind of everywhere. Especially in New York City, where Tony’s tech meant he could peek at any security or street camera on a whim.
"..." Bruce looked up at him, setting the pants down on top of the vest. He held up a hand. "Come here a second."
“Oh, I, uh…” Peter was dismayed to hear his voice go up in pitch. Honesty seemed like the best policy, here, but Loki seemed to hate Wade like everybody else, so he was pretty sure he’d be judged for wanting a weekend alone with the guy. It was tough to convey why exactly Peter liked Wade to anybody. Sometimes he judged himself over it, even. Other days he really appreciated having somebody to laugh with at the absurdity their lives often threw at them.
"I am," Clint assured him, stepping up to give Bruce a firm pat on the back. "I just think you should go first."
"Friends!" Thor's booming voice sounded just moments before the sky flashed bright with lightning. A deep grumbling roll of thunder sounded not more than a few seconds afterward.
“Are you staying with that man?” She asked quietly, her almond shaped emerald eyes glancing after Thor.
The Hulk, who had been bludgeoning the wall of the mansion into rubble for several minutes now, turned to them and snarled.
"Hey! That reminds me, I've got to grab some buns," Tony added immediately, "yup, buns for the hamburgers. Be right back." He turned and headed straight after Steve, nearly jogging to catch up. Ouch, ouch, jogging while still a little hung over, ouch.
Loki tried to beat a hasty retreat for the mansion door. He nearly made it to the door before Thor landed right in front of him.
She pressed a small remote she pulled from her suit somewhere. Who knew where, considering how form fitting it was. After pressing a few more buttons, a hole opened under her in the shield.
"I hate to break in on this touching reunion, but there's a third me running around—and Thor's alone with him. Doom said he wanted Thor, so...?" Shrugging a shoulder, Clint glanced up at Bruce. "Maybe we should scan him?"
Bruce stood beside the Clint he'd arrived with. He had to admit, the other one looked and sounded exactly like Clint, too. If he was a copy, somebody had outdone themselves. One of them had to be a copy, though—they couldn't both be real.
Rather than go sit back down by Clint, Bruce moved over and sat on Cap's other side, though. When Peter gave him a curious look, Bruce sighed and held out a hand to Cap uncertainly.
“Wait, you’re thousands of years old and you’re reading that for the first time?” Peter made it sound like reading Jane Austen’s books was inevitable if one had that much time. Clint was really learning some weird stuff about the kid today.
Steve would have protested, but his throat...no. It wasn't that. He just didn't mind. Maybe Tony was right. The team took care of one another—that was how they had gotten this far. He stared over at the black haired man, speaking softly to keep from coughing.
"Listen, we've got a situation with the Fantastic Four going on," Tony told the other three in the room. "All of them are missing except for Johnny Storm. He's here now, asking us for some help, but we've gotta focus on curing Cap's poisoning first thing."
“Aww, but there’s plenty of room in there, look—I rode in with Dr. Banner’s tacklebox, I could keep it company on the way home,” he joked. Wait, hadn’t they had a whole talk about giving the tacklebox to Bruce when they’d first arrived? How was it still in the trunk? Come to think of it, Peter hadn’t seen any fishing going on the whole trip…
Bruce quickly got to his feet, placing a hand on the injured Clint's shoulder to steady him—and to keep track of him in the dark.
The train finally arrived, grinding to a halt next to the grimy platform. People boarded in an extremely slow line. It wasn't any mystery why the train was so late. After what seemed like half an hour, Peter had made it to the train's door.
One of the tents opened and Loki ducked out, eying Thor very curiously. A couple of faces peeked out after him, but no one followed him.
After last night, Clint really didn’t want to even LOOK at him. Rejection hurt, but somehow it hurt WAY worse when it was coming from the adorkable freckled physicist.
"I don't wanna get ice-cream," Peter said hastily, holding up both hands. "I really need to be getting home—if Aunt May wakes up and I'm not in my bed, she's gonna have a heart attack."
“I heard a bit of your conversation. You said you were trying to cheer someone up? Is that big blond friend of yours having a bad day?”
"Wow, the power goes out and everybody assumes I died? As much as I like to think the world revolves around me..." Tony said wryly. "Look, stop attacking the shield—Carol can take it down anytime. We need to know the situation first, though. Where's the other you?"
Wade hesitated, thinking the question over very carefully, blue eyes locked on Peter. After a moment, he forced a laugh.
"Hey, don't forget to hold onto me!" Peter realized uncomfortably right after saying this that Deadpool WAS still holding around his waist pretty tight—with his legs.
"No, I'm fine!" Loki insisted. "It looks a lot worse than it is." Or not. He couldn't remember the last time he had actually bled so badly. "Besides, I know you don't have a Ph.D." He snorted, trying to sound amused.
“Yeah, with a twenty,” Clint boasted, collecting the cards and shuffling them back into the deck. As fun as it was to play Blackjack with Bruce, he kind of had other things on his mind.
“He’s certainly…a colorful character,” Steve told him, resting a heavy hand on Peter’s shoulder. “We’re trying to give him a chance. He knows who we are, but we’ve just met him.”
"Oww! What the hell, Tony?" T-shirt Clint gritted his teeth. "I thought you said you wouldn't shove it through my arm!"
Peter wanted to slap his own forehead, but that would’ve made noise. What was Wade even trying to find in the lake, anyway? Did he make something up just to see if Loki would help him look for nothing?
"Hey!" The man across the room yelled, pointing the arrow he had in his hand at Loki. "Keep your hands to yourself!" Hawkeye looked genuinely angry. The fool.
“Peter’s all about responsibility—you’d think he wouldn’t tell Wade unless he could trust him.” Tony frowned, at the conversation or at the distance Steve couldn’t tell. “You know, Cap, I’m surprised you of all people want to swim right after breakfast. Isn’t that supposed to be bad?”
"Wait, we shouldn't split up," Bruce called out after him, his voice fading as Cap hurried back the way he’d come.
"We should all get in one place, figure out who's causing the trouble, and deal with them," Bruce said dully. He made it sound so simple...
“Peter, if he’s someone you’re ashamed of, you need to consider why very carefully.” Tossing the stick he was holding into the fire, Steve leaned closer to put an arm over Peter’s shoulders to comfort him. “Why do you feel uncomfortable in public? Is he rude to service workers? Does he embarrass you?”
They stood there for a moment smiling at each other before Cap realized that he was doing it and hurried to speak.
“I’m taking a break,” Clint announced from behind them. When Peter looked, the Avenger was already settling onto a rock.
"Yeah..." Bruce agreed absently, making a beeline for the bench again. When he reached it, he sat down and leaned back, looking up at the stormy gray sky. Now he was confused. Was Clint the one acting odd, or was it him?
The young woman he'd lifted looked like she was fresh out of college, and through the smoke he could see that she had long brown hair—and what looked like burns all over her side.
Cap stared at the screen, not hearing whatever the report lady had gone on to say. Tony was with Loki. That was all there was to it.
Peter tossed a web out in front of him and dove into another swing, answering conversationally, "Almost gettin' bug-squashed by Wolverine and Deadpool. They were bickering over a motorcycle, followed me around half the night."
“…Really hope the case doesn’t go into next week,” the kid was saying, brushing his hair back from his face with his free hand. He didn’t seem tired from all of this hiking in the slightest—like climbing up the hill was an absent afterthought. “I’m looking forward to having you to myself for a few days.” Wait, who was he talking to about days of alone time? Clint was painfully aware that Peter’s loudmouth boyfriend was right here with them.
“They…Lady hitting on you? Boyfriend?” Absently chucking the lighter into the now lit paper towel, Wade took a long step to stand chest to chest with Spidey. His eyes narrowed and he leaned down to look Peter in the eye suspiciously. No comment, just the look.
Peter glanced back at Cap and Tony, gears turning in his head. Cap's super soldier self was probably immune to onion fumes, but what if Tony started crying in the middle of making the sauce with him? He didn't have his armor, so onion fumes would probably hit HIM like a truck.
"He will not die on my watch," Thor said, frowning and getting to his feet. "Stark, is he correct? Does your life wane as we speak?"
“I worry about you, like anybody else in the team,” Clint told him honestly, bracing his arm up for Bruce. “Besides, Hulk’ll tell you that I bleed all the time. Er…well, I guess you’d know that.”
"I-I'm not sure," the woman admitted, wincing and clinging onto his shirt. "Slow down—ouch." The blond man sat her down a good ten feet away from the building.
Sunglasses would have been a good idea. Then again, if they both wore sunglasses, Clint wouldn’t be able to see Bruce’s eyes if they changed color.
Trying not to show how tired and worried he was, Steve squeezed his friend's hand. "Tony, if you n-need to say something, I'm h-here."
"WOOHOO! Alright!" The merc jumped to his feet, arms above his head. "One 90 year old man, comin' up!" He dashed off up the stairs.
"Deep breath, Bruce. Maybe some tea is a better idea. Do you know if we have any hippie herbal teas laying around?"
"What's so wrong...with men? You're one!" Tony said, waving in his general direction for emphasis. He put his hand over his chest, casting big shadows on the walls as the Arc reactor was half-covered. "And, I don't have 'sensibilities'. 21st century's about doing...doing whatever you...please..."  He closed his eyes and slumped back down. Whatever. He didn't have the energy to follow Steve or even sit up right now. Peeking at Cap, he saw the blond was actually blushing.
“He got up about an hour ago,” Matt told him, hurriedly pulling on his jeans. “I figured I’d let you sleep in.”
"I know, I—we—thank you. It was a bad idea," Cap said nervously, walking with more purpose. "We should just stay focused on what's important, then. Like saving the world," he added a bit sadly.
"He...that is odd," Bruce agreed, a bit taken aback. "Usually he only mentions me to call me puny or something."
Apparently, Steve took that to mean that he really was dying. He stared back sadly, still holding Tony’s hand tightly. The look on his face told Tony that there was a massively sappy or encouraging speech around the corner.
Bruce really was needed for all of this scientific and medical stuff—even if the scientist could talk him through it, the green Avenger could hardly perform any of the delicate procedures or typing necessary.
“Yeah, DAD, I’ve got it RIGHT here!” Clint quipped, hoisting the big bottle up for Captain America to see.
He, Loki, God of Lies, was bleeding. Actually bleeding. Not much could harm him, especially not mortal weapons. Had Stark really found a way to injure him? This was far more serious than Doom's plans. He had to destroy Tony's research before it was used on HIM. Slowly, he turned around back to Bruce. Maybe a bandage wasn’t such a bad idea.
Clint sat back and huddled in his blanket again, watching the babies crawl away with a fake looking arm with a raised eyebrow.
"Even corpses bleed for a while," the Hulk grumbled. The heavy footsteps told Clint he was being followed. "...Banner says PRESSURE stops bleeding."
"I don't need to be in bed!" Clint growled, batting Thor away and completely ignoring poor Spider-Man. "How long has it been since you slept, Bruce?" He added, glaring at the sleepy looking scientist. "YOU should be in bed."
“Speaking of shooting,” Clint muttered, snagging Dr. Banner’s arm and leading him back toward the tree.
He cringed. “Jeez, having an angry Hulk running around targeting your campsite must be terrifying as a normal person, never mind a normal BLIND person. We’ve got to talk to Hulk before anybody actually gets hurt, here.”
“You guys are jerks!” A woman’s voice called shrilly from the shore. When Tony looked, there was a miffed looking blond woman with a camera clutched in her phone like she was recording.
"Actually, I-I think we're gonna go get something to drink," Hank called to Wade and Peter apologetically. "Uh, be back later!" They beat a hasty retreat before Peter could throw the frisbee again.
Bruce unfastened a strap, stepping around to free his other hand as well. He didn't say anything, just went about undoing the ankle straps, too, and then kneeling to gather up the needles and gauze that had been dropped on the floor earlier.
"Oh, yeah? It's just one-sided lust, huh?" He shot back, sitting up with a painful grimace and pointing at Loki. "Th-then I wanna see you...explain...wh-why he asked me to MARRY him."
"R-right." Cap scooted closer, trying to undo the wires as quickly and as carefully as he could manage.
"I-I'm not. Have you s-seen Miss Potts?" Steve slapped a wet hand over Thor's. The demigod’s hand felt warm compared to his own.
"Clint told me they're together the other night," he said, playing it cool and talking about their teammates instead of the fact that they themselves needed to have an honest conversation.
When one put them side by side, Doctor Doom's armor and Tony's Iron Man armor were pretty similar, and Hawkeye heard that the latter had already gotten hostile toward her once or twice.
"You must stay up all night a lot," Peter said, sighing. "I'm beat, though. Sorry, I've got to pass on the ice-cream and go home and collapse."
Peter and Johnny were taking bets now on which of the babies—a snarling blond, a dark-skinned brunette and a curly redhead—would take down their own fathers first.
Cap took a breath. No. He couldn’t stay stranded out here with Tony. Sooner or later, he’d give in to temptation and admit to his feelings. Gambling the most dear friendship he’d ever known wasn’t something he was willing to do.
“Wait!” Thor stopped, one hand hovering over the popcorn in the bowl. Jarvis stopped changing channels.
"Isn't everything in here?" Bruce said quietly, reminding the others that he was there as well. He had to wonder if the shield generator Ms. Marvel had put up had been powered by the mansion, or by its own source. "Do you think somebody did this on purpose, or it's just the weather?" The scientist added, looking around.
"And he loves everybody too. But I'm fake, because—because..." He rubbed his head, thinking hard. "I don't love everybody. I hate everybody. Even Thor!"
"Stay your hand," Thor told the archer, holding a hand out to him as well. He looked at Deadpool and frowned. Since the man in red had obviously come from the mansion's doors, he said, "Come along and we shall speak--I must seek shelter for my friends."
"That'd be, oh, 6 hours give or take." Tony shrugged, leaning back against the wall. "I know, 'so much for infinite'. It takes a lot of power to be this high-tech."
Going back to his push ups, Cap shook his head to dislodge the idea. No matter how quiet today was, the Earth would need saving tomorrow. He couldn’t get distracted by Tony.
Thor was exactly where Steve had left him last night when switching places for his second watch. The lake shore near him had been picked clean of any suitable skipping rocks, and instead he was spinning Mjolnir around a finger idly. As Steve stepped down the trail, Thor threw the magic hammer out above the lake. Rather than fall into the water, it flew in a shining circle and returned to his hand. It was like watching somebody playing with a yo-yo—a yo-yo that could knock trees down.
"No! Us! The Fantastic Four, man! I went home this morning and there's no one there! Herbie's all ripped apart and none of the security cameras got anything!" He let go of Spider-Man's shirt and clasped his hands together. "Come on! I gotta talk to the Avengers! How'd you get out?"
"Okay I have to ashk—is this a shex thing? Because I’m pretty shure Thor has a thing for Jane Foshter..."
Clint couldn’t point fingers. His backpack didn’t even have any food in it. He’d brought along a bunch of different arrowheads, a grappling hook, a hammock and a bunch of other stuff that he obviously wasn’t going to get a chance to use.
The Hulk turned, too, and was already starting in that direction. Clearly whoever had come in could get the door open just fine, which meant that it had to be Cap and Hawkeye, or...that the shield was down.
"Stop worrying about him. Jeez," Hawkeye said brightly, already in a better mood at seeing Thor. Cap would feel better once Tony was safely back in the mansion.
Thor was only just stepping out of the tent, though, and turned around after Tony noticed him. Shrugging on his flannel shirt, he gave the Avengers co-leaders a concerned look. “I assure you, the exploding marshmallow debacle from last night was my own doing. If anyone should be sat down and scolded, it is I!”
"It's not because s-she's your secretary—she t-takes care of you." Steve pushed open the basement door and led them to the bottom of the stairs. "Sort of l-like I do," he added thoughtfully.
Cap sighed and leaned a hand on Tony's arm shoulder for support, watching what the black haired man was doing on the computer.
Turning back to Steve and Tony and licking the cone so it wouldn't drip on his hand, Peter waved vaguely at the row of rented two-person kayaks in bright colors that Thor, Lola and Wade had lined up on the beach. "Teams by color sounds great--we might even be able to match up flags and kayaks. How about if I deal with all that while you guys get moving on the flag planting part? Pick a kayak and head on out, and by the time you get back the teams will be ready to go."
"Over here," the scientist sighed, stepping out of the bushes and half-leaning on the nearest tree. He looked all scratched up, like maybe he'd gone back to himself mid-leap and flung a ways, and was soaked to the skin. Of course, since he wasn't wearing anything else, he had little choice in the matter.
“Civilians, plural?” Peter asked, glancing over at Matt. Clint knew that the kid knew that Cap and Tony DIDN’T know Matt was a super hero, but he wasn’t pointing it out either. Revealing Daredevil’s secret identity would be kind of rude if they didn’t already know, maybe? More likely Peter was trying to put off the inevitable chat about why the hell he was dating Daredevil.
She was taller than him, with an Amazonian build that was barely contained in a strappy dark green bikini.
“You know...” Cap cleared his throat, looking Tony directly in the eye. Try as he might, his face was flushed. He didn’t want to go through that conversation again. They had to at least get a name from Peter before they could try to trace his boyfriend.
"Clint," Steve whispered hoarsely. He cringed at how bad he sounded. Whoever it was, they would most likely assume he was some kind of sewer freak—or maybe a super villain. With a sigh he tried again, but it came out even creepier. "Are you okay?"
Root beer, Clint observed, giving Bruce a quick, pointed glance. That was Cap’s drink of choice when he was having a bad day and wanted to remember better times.
The idea of Hawkeye and Hulk being an item had never occurred to Steve. They seemed to be friends from what he could tell, though they certainly bickered. What couple didn’t on occasion, though? Perhaps it was more that Hawkeye was with Hulk’s softer side, the brilliant Bruce Banner.
“Matt, I’m really surprised to see you here after I mentioned the Avengers camping nearby on the phone. I-I mean, I’m happy to see you, I just… Didn’t Cap and Tony recognize you?”
“Peter takes extra explaining, actually,” Tony whispered to Steve. “Like telling him about the college fund we’ve got for him. Thank god we can save all that for later.”
Cracking open an eye, the blond noticed that it was way past dark, but he and Hulk were still up on their big old boulder. He and Hulk had gone off to sleep where Bruce had camped before. If anyone knew a good spot to camp in, it was Bruce.
Tony hugged Steve with one arm in return, slipping the other under his legs and picking him up. Carrying the blonde princess-style, he started for the hallway.
“I’d go pack my stuff, but I didn’t…actually bring any stuff,” Peter said sheepishly. “Want me to make us some sandwiches for the road, maybe?”
At hearing his fake name, Tony stopped drinking, pushing his sunglasses up with a thumb to stare Loki down.
Tony followed, still lugging the last two suitcases. Whether he liked it or not, Clint needed a break. He was probably going to be a lot more cheerful tomorrow morning when there was fresh coffee.
"Uh huh. Likewise buddy." Shirtless Clint went over and sat down by the other to nab a part of the blanket.
Leaving Bruce for a moment, he hurried to check their room and found it empty. It wasn’t like the cabin was big or anything, so he returned to his…boyfriend?
Peter half-turned, linking arms with him. He felt a little guilty for not asking if the guy still needed help getting around—since Matt had his walking stick now, Peter had guessed he might not want to make a big deal of it. The storm was really messing with him, though, it seemed.
"Yeah, well there's one thing we can agree on," Tony grumbled, rummaging in the cooler. Virgin Bloody Mary was a lame flavor, and since getting drunk while keeping an eye on somebody would be just plain stupid, he wound up taking one of Cap's root beers.
"He jabbed the injured one right in the stitches," Bruce said drolly. How had Clint known he was actually talking about sandwiches back there?
The moment Steve heard the man’s reply, he got up and made his way up the stairs, knowing that Matt would hear him approach. Daredevil kept talking, though.
Swishing the edges of the waves with his toes, Peter shook his head at the mental images this conversation was bringing up.
Well, Tony thought, this was unexpected. He should fake dying more often—it sure got Steve to open up. Drawing a slow, slightly shaky breath (mostly for dramatic intent, but his chest really hurt, too), he squeezed Steve's hand in return and smiled sadly.
“…I’m trying not to impose on Tony’s life anymore.” As the smaller man’s words sank in, he glanced back at Bruce, eyebrow quirked. “Wait, you think Tony’s attracted to another Avenger? Who?”
Tony said that last like it would be really annoying to have to actually admit they needed SHIELD's help. It probably would be for him.
"Alright." Glancing at Tony with a very serious look—as if he'd never see him again—the first avenger pressed the needle against his arm.
"Dallas? I thought you were gonna go to Detroit," Peter said, sitting up as well. He pulled his mask back on.
Seeming a little surprised at being singled out, Bruce raised his hand in a hesitant little wave in return.
"No wonder he brought you outside when I got there. He probably didn't want me to fry his decorating on my way out."
"Emergency kits are in the closets," Pepper and Bruce said in unison. The two looked at each other and blinked. Apparently both knew Tony's tendencies just that well at this point.
"Let me bandage that up," he told Loki, frowning the slightest bit. "If you're the real Hawkeye, bleeding that much is serious."
"I wouldn't mind a castle of my own someday," the blond said, sipping the water. "So, you still want Thor?"
“I believe the son of Odin is in his room, enjoying the company of Miss Lola. Mocha?” T’challa asked suddenly, sitting his books on the kitchen counter and resting a hand on a sauce pan.
"...Thinking maybe we could stargaze," Bruce was saying, scanning the bright sky thoughtfully. "It looks like it'll be clear out tonight. I don't have a telescope, but the constellations are still nice to look at."
"How about no? I've got a test to study for, man. And whoever you stole that wig from is gonna come back and light it on fire while you're wearin' it, and I really don't wanna be around to smell that, so I'm takin' off."
"I don't know, is that something you want people seeing a superhero do? This's New York, somebody's probably filming you and everything."
“He did mention camping apart for the safety of others. I hadn’t thought it was this serious, however.”
“I helped,” Peter corrected. “C’mon, you didn’t see the green glowy magic lifting you out of the water?” He cringed at the memory of how Clint must have looked, adding, “I guess you WERE kinda coated in mud and algae at the time. Bleh.”
"Yeah...I think we should try the heavy object to the head option," Loki heard Hawkeye mumble. It made him chuckle.
Peter stepped out of the cab and leaned close to the window so that it looked like he was paying their taxi fare to Aunt May. She was already making her way up the front steps and readying the house key.
"Tony." Steve placed his other hand on top of the one that still held Tony's. "You know t-that I..." He cringed and stopped himself again.
Thor's expression softened, and he dropped the hammer to the ground, taking Steve's hand in both of his.
“I agree,” Cap told Thor, paddling to face Tony. “We can’t just let him camp here. Who knows what he plans to do!”
"My shoe broke. I-I slipped and...rolled a little. Not too much," she said, seeming strangely calm about it. "Scraped my leg up really bad, and my elbows. My shoulder...really hurts."
With Wade, it was hard to tell what he was going to do. Most of the time even he didn’t seem to know what his plan was.
“I would understand if you or Hulk decided to pick a fight with Spider-Man over something, but destroying his camp was too much,” Cap began. “His friend Matt is blind, Bruce. You destroyed his walking cane and his glasses!”
"Really," Tony said grimly, picking up his drink. He turned and started off down the beach after Peter.
"Nice try, Jarvis—stop making voices and help me balance out the weight ratios on this thing before Steve gets back." Tony was looking like some kind of mad, oil-smeared scientist—as usual when he disappeared to his lab. This time he was working on some little gadget, sitting on the floor with it on his lap and messing with some buttons on the top. He didn't even look up when Thor entered the room.
"Yeah Daddy and Papa, quit being gross!" Harley added, clearly having spent too much time with his Uncle Clint. Tony chuckled as he turned to his Alpha to grab his hand, only to find the sap looking dreamily back at him with one hand extended.
“Hi Ashley, whatcha doin in the closet?” he asked as he crawled in with her. “Are you okay?” he asked after taking a look at her scared face. “What’s the matter? Are you scared?” he asked as Steve moved in to begin to pull him out. Tony quickly reached an arm out to stop him, shaking his head when he looked back at him in confusion.
“Harley…” he said, remembering the list of things he had to do - number one was to pick up their pup from school.
“Just because I’m not responsible doesn’t mean I can’t feel sympathy for you.” She was notably taken aback by that, eyeing him suspiciously. “And for the record, I’d happily rip out her ovaries. All the ovaries and all the balls necessary.” He smiled when she smiled, glad to see her be a child for just a moment.
Bucky watched the blonde’s shirt ride up when he leaned over and took that opportunity to touch the exposed skin. He held the sign for
“I need to go too,” Daci added, looking around and finding restrooms nearby. “Look Peter, they’re right there. Let’s go.”
“We’re just here for the chimichangas, sir.” Wade said innocently, hiding his hands behind his back. The worker threw his hands up in defeat. “Fine! But you three, get out of here, someone should’ve taught you how to treat women.” This earned a cheer from the crowd, stopping the three from causing any more confrontation.
“You’re beautiful, you know that?” Tony had heard that a million times in his life from a million different people. But for some reason, he only blushed when Steve said it.
“Emerson our session is over, I just wanted to tell you how grateful I am that you’ve told me this. It hurts and it’s still raw, but I promise you this is what progress looks like,” Kate said quietly. Emerson nodded before standing up, offering a small smile before leaving to the lobby. Her Dad was waiting for her, sprawled on one of the seats – playing on one of his tablets. He smiled at her when she went to stand in front of him.
He can’t believe he’d forgotten to ask off work. He’d made sure he’d done it the last four years and couldn’t believe he’d forgot this year and was stuck at work as he tried to find someone to cover the rest of his shift.
“You wanna help me pick out a new balcony couch?” he asked suggestively at his husband. Steve looked up at him in confusion, before mock glaring at the brunette. He leaned back against one of his work tables before responding.
He figures buttering them up would instantly look suspicious, but also knew his ridiculous parents enough to know getting them things wouldn't hurt. Not as much as his words, anyway.
His mood picked up about a minute later when he heard the sounds of tiny feet stampeding towards him. The door burst open to reveal his first born, breathless and smiling at the pair. His parents trailed behind, clearly having struggled to keep up with the pup.
"Come on Hel, how bout I fix us some drinks?" he said to their daughter in law, laughing at the pout Jo threw in his direction. Peter followed them with Sam into the kitchen, leaving Steve, Jo and a still naked Jamie behind.
Wade’s head shot up and he locked his eyes with Peter’s. Peter smiled at his love and quickly moved the flowers out of the way as Wade collided their bodies, kissing him fiercely. He laughed when Wade lifted him up, wrapping his arms around his shoulders, flowers tickling his face, as he kissed the love of his life again and again.
"Watch the attitude Thumper," the brunette spoke up only to see his husband cross his arms in disappointment. "Emerson, why did you skip school?" Tony finally asked her as he turned to face his daughter.
Everyone laughed, knowing he wasn’t being serious. Anyone within a hundred mile radius could tell Peter was loved by his dads.
“I should hope so, I did marry you after all.” Tony pulled his left hand out to look at the band. Which made them both chuckle, as it wasn’t his actual wedding ring. They ordered these cute plastic glow in the dark ones that they were currently wearing, not minding if they lost them.
“Alright, I’m apparently picking him up at ten, so be ready by nine forty five, alright punk?” Buck asked, not waiting for an answer as he ushered Steve out of his front door after he stopped by earlier.
Peter immediately followed, ignoring the agents outside demanding he stop. He rounded the corner and steeled himself.
He made his way to the kitchen, trying to decide if he wanted to start breakfast or go for a quick run before they all wake up. He opted to at least get a pot of coffee going, still feeling pretty emotionally exhausted from last night.
The teen took another large gulp of her drink, wondering to herself how many of these she’d need to get at least buzzed.
Peter stormed off in the direction of the lab, Em hot on his heels in curiosity. When they got to the glass door, Emerson could see Tony and Steve off to the left scrambling when they realized they were home. She followed in after Peter punched in his code, smiling as she saw the two adults looking utterly flustered and embarrassed.
“Oh, I have a way to make it up to you…” Tony said with a sing-songy voice. Curiosity getting the better of him, he shifted around to face the man with a quirked brow.
Currently he was scoping out a weapon’s deal, two small parties in a warehouse...one of which he believed belonged to the infamous Kingpin. He got photo evidence and waited for the transaction to be completed before making his presence known.
“It’s not...it’s not you guys. You guys are...creepily perfect,” he said with a laugh when James chuckled next to him before wrapping an arm around him. Clint leaned against him, enjoying his warmth. He had told his boyfriend bits and pieces about his past, but he hadn’t gotten to the deep stuff.
“Hey hey, let me help with that,” an all too familiar voice said as Hawkeye came into view. He smiled down at the superhero whose face mask was half-up his face.
So he smiled brightly as he verbally heard his husband pout behind him when the two heard Joey approach the kitchen.
"So you're definitely not upset that Pop weirded out after seeing his ex?" the young man said with a smug smile. Tony smiled at his oldest as he shook his head fondly, boy was too smart for his own good.
“Sounds good,” Tony said, pulling Peter into one side and reaching his arm out to Daci with the other. She smiled back at him, pulling Morgan along with her to cuddle against Tony’s other side.
“Should be home tomorrow, little cretin refused to have his daddy pick him up from the trip. Like I’m embarrassing or something, can you believe that?”
"Of course Mr. Miles, if you all would follow me," the King said; his smile grew as Miles quickly grabbed his hand to follow. She was thankful for the distraction as an idea popped into her head.
“Hello to you too,” he said sarcastically. His husband had his arms crossed as he walked around to stand in front of the super soldier.
“Hey! I was thinking of having a party tonight, you should come. Back. This evening,” Tony sputtered out, fidgeting in place as he stood by the door.
“Yes Tony. I did. I…I choose you.” The billionaire laughed loudly at that, earning a small smile from the super soldier.
“She’s cute, Coulson, but wanna tell us why you’re really here?” his Dad asked, handing the tablet back to his uncle.
"House arrest would mean he would stay back in your house. This is, actually the opposite of house arrest," Emerson spoke up as she continued flexing her hands in her lap, ignoring her darker haired father's poke to get her to stop. The super soldier noted the god of mischief had trouble holding his laugh at his daughter's point.
“Dad?” he heard Joey ask next to him. He quickly turned the screen to his smart phone off, turning to her with what he hoped was a straight face. “Did you hear what I asked?”
“That’s totally fine,” he said quickly, feeling a bit silly for thinking otherwise. He needed to trust her more.
As he walked off the quinjet, Steve stretched his arms above his head and frowned at the popping sound coming from his joints.
"Still can't believe your ugly mug made something that cute," Steve teased as he saw Joey smile at him. He reached over to gently caress her cheek, smiling when she let out a sleepy giggle at that. Kept smiling as she reached her tiny hand out to grasp his finger.
“No, it didn’t surprise anyone. Except for Harley, who heard his father say he was only here for the money and wanted nothing to do with his son.”
"So, you like me?" Emerson asked again in clarification, bravely taking a step forward to the smiling woman.
The first few clips didn’t have audio, just faces Vivienne made behind his back at Daci. The first one with audio made Bucky’s stomach more upset, as it was Vivienne mocking Daci for having a stuffed animal. It was in a subtle way, but made the connection between babies and toys that had his daughter putting Wolf under her bed.
“Love you too, baby,” she said in a shaky voice, adding a kiss to his cheek before pulling back. “So do you need a minute and want to find out after dinner or do you want to help me with dinner and conspire against your father while also helping your boyfriend?”
“Like Peter Rabbit?” Steve asked, smiling brightly when Harley nodded and giggled in his arms. “What do you think, little puppy? Do you like Peter? Your big brother thinks it suits you and I agree.” Peter just squirmed in his blanket which had the two blondes chuckling.
Peter snuck around the adults to offer his new sister a hug. She smiled hesitantly, before closing the gap and joining his hug. Peter looked up, noticing Mr. Hoggs glaring at him, before offering him his middle finger. Before he could offer any kind of comeback, Peter whirled the pair around, arms around Emerson’s shoulders, leading her out of the government building.
” he croaked out, feeling emotional whiplash as the brunette presented him with a small box. He watched as the man he loved opened it to reveal a silver ring inside. Clint was frozen, felt stuck between a dream and the reality of what was happening.
“I don’t want your money, I’d rather have you,” she said sincerely. Tony felt his chest warm up, kissing the top of her head as his own eyes got misty. Thoughts of his own childhood flashed through his mind, before he made himself focus on making new memories with his girl. And since he was the king of using humor as a defense mechanism…
"This is precious and all, but food's ready whenever you guys are hungry," Sam said with a smile, helping Nat out of the pool when the redheaded Alpha reached for his hand. Harley, immediately forgetting about his brother, jumped up off his Daddy's lap to run to the food.
"Guys, get it together, this is a good day!" she said as she joined their hug once again, laughing as they tried to composed themselves.
“I don’t care that your uncle’s sugar daddy is a celebrity. You’re nothing more than a white-trash dyke,” she paused as the crowd laughed and Joey felt her fists clench. “Your poor dad, what would he think about you living with fags, huh? He was a white-trash carnie himself, right?”
“There, D-a-c-i-a-n-a, that’s how you spell your name, Daciana,” Steve said with a bright smile that Daci found herself easily matching. He pulled the crayons out and let her pick a color, which she chose purple, before grabbing another page to start drawing lines on.
She should really stop teasing her uncle…but he was just so damn hilarious whenever she did! She laughs a moment longer as they ride the elevator down.
“Ty was possessive and manipulative and fucking ruthless. He was smart and his father was powerful. I kept coming back to him because I was convinced I couldn’t do any better. It wasn’t until,” Tony paused, an actual smile spreading across his face. “It wasn’t until Peter was born that I finally woke the fuck up. That and, Rhodey kicked his ass for me. Pepper got a few licks in too, don’t worry, then she helped me slap a restraining order against him,” he said as Steve found himself smiling at the thought.
"Fine, of course you can have a kitten," the blonde said as he smiled at their girl. Said girl immediately moved around to hug the super soldier, much to the dismay of the billionaire.
“Come on Steve, the stars have aligned for this! You have no responsibilities, Sharon offered to take your shift, what actual excuse do you have?” Sam asked as he finished cleaning their station before the next medics came in.
“I know you are but what am I?” his father said with his tongue out, proving his point. Peter rolled his eyes fondly as he heard Leo laugh again at that, before walking over to the closest chair. One of his Dad’s tablets was on a nearby table, so he grabbed that before plopping onto his seat.
Until Lucky made his presence known, desperately trying to get his little body to climb onto the couch with them.
“Hey man,” Rumlow slurred out, keeping the door still mostly closed. Buck didn’t respond as he pushed the door open the rest of the way.
Pete and his gang were coming to the mansion more frequently than they did when they lived in the Tower. Not that she minded, it did help a little with her baby-fever. And even though it was early-October, the twins had easily convinced their grandpas that they needed to swim in their heated indoor pool. So everyone went to change into their swimsuits.
“Steve, you are the most amazing Alpha, mate and father. But if you keep going at this rate you will absolutely lose your mind. Trust me, okay? When Harley was born I tried to do everything myself and I nearly collapsed from the effort. I don’t need you to do every little thing, I need you well rested and at your best. You’ve been cooking, cleaning and taking care of me, Harley and Peter all while still working at the gym. Which - I called your Pappy and he said he doesn’t want to see you for at least a week.”
“No thanks. Seems like you should keep fucking this guy that seems too good to be true. You’re not secretly like some serial killer or anything...right?” Barney asked as he began walking to the bedroom.
It was him again, this time caught mid-laugh. A realization dawned on the genius as he took a quick glance at his artist, noting with satisfaction the blush on his handsome face. He looked back down at the notebook and started flipping through the pages a little more quickly.
Thinking about it for a moment, Steve realized that he’d seen Thor and Bruce speaking the day before. Maybe Thor was the one to ask about WHY in the HELL he’d destroy Peter’s camp.
"Wait for me!" Wade yelled, leaping off of the roof. Dropping past Peter’s window, he landed with a thunk on the ground below. His pocket TV buzzed with static. "Sightings....of...hulk...sandwiches."
"You should take a hot bath." Peter peeked around the edge of the kitchen door, trying to see who was talking.
"You don't have to do that," Clint grumbled, wriggling in his shackles. “Trust me, you don’t want to. He’s got a thing for blonds.” The last was added in a mock whisper. Steve didn’t see the point in antagonizing Doom more, so he turned his focus back to their captor.
"I mean, us New Yorkers, hot dogs are a tradition," Peter added quickly with a nervous smile. "C'mon, Wade, looks like I don't have to shove you back on the train right now after all."
“What we SHOULD’VE done was huddle under the kayak. We managed, though. At least nobody got struck by lightning.”
“I’M concerned,” Tony countered grumpily, glancing at Steve. “Aren’t you? If he was just plain normal-weary there wouldn’t be some deep buried secret involved, right?”
"I'll be by to check on you later," Tony called after her. "You don't seem as bad as Cap, here, but still, you DID get gassed and all."
Wolverine glared up at him. He was holding Peter up so high that the brunette was actually looking down on him. Maybe he was thinking? Or just waiting to throw Spider-Man off the roof. Either way, he didn't say much. Peter decided now was a good time to pull his face mask off and give Logan his best 'what did I ever do to you?' puppy eyes.
It was awesome to hear that Bruce wanted to spend time with him and it actually made Clint blush—which he was ready to claim was a sunburn to save face.
Wade’s voice easily carried to where Peter and Matt were perched in the trees and Peter heard Matt growl as the merc continued his charade.
"Oookay then." He pushed open the large gate and went outside, holding the gate for Bruce to pass through, but keeping his eyes on the ground.
Clint started toward the cabin again. It wasn’t like he was in a hurry to be around everyone else, it was just hard to make love confessions over the roaring storm.
Then there were all the other issues. The public opinion and super villains that might use their relationship against them. The political implications of two well known heroes dating and whether that gained or lost favor. Even one kiss would have people screaming in their faces.
“A growth spurt? You don’t say?” the mercenary asked sarcastically, earning a cheek kiss when the attention turned to his little brother and his ‘journey to being a man’.
“Right?” Tony said still looking down, finally quirking his brow when he saw Steve standing directly in front of him.
“You’re right, I wouldn’t have let you drink alcohol in a back alley because you’re sixteen fucking years old!” he yelled as she hung her head in defeat. He made himself take a breath, calming down to continue.
“No, what happened?” his stubborn love said, making Steve feel that much more shitty about the situation.
“Wait,” Peter asked after he finished his bite. “Does this mean I can’t celebrate my eighteenth birthday?”
“I’m not pretending anything, Leonardo. If I didn’t care, I’d let you go,” he answered with gritted teeth, tears forming in his eyes when the boy started crying for real and just continued with his harmful accusations.
“Yes sir,” she said with another smile. Emerson turned to the closest uncle – who turned out to be Sam – to koala bear hug him. Sam squawked a little as me tried to maintain balance. She may have jumped on him as well. He quickly positioned her more comfortably in his embrace.
She looked at him in betrayal before her eyes grew wide and a huge smile formed. “Dad’s going to be okay!” she shouted in excitement. All thoughts are automatically redirected to Tony, the blonde smiling at her before turning to smile at Peter.
"You wanna hold her? She's super cuddly after her nap," Buck said with a smile as he held her against his chest.
The brunette started to stir, stretching a little in Steve’s embrace before pointedly pushing his ass back into the blonde’s crotch. Steve smiled as he kissed his way down the man’s silky hair to the back of his neck.
“Hey,” Clint said in offense while Harley and Peter cheered and followed the brunette into the kitchen, leaving the blonde with the two girls on the couch. “Well, Daci you’re in charge, what should we do?” he asked as Daci watched Morgan shift around to pat the man’s face.
“Yup. Let me help you to bed” she said wrapping one of his arms around her shoulder, allowing him to put weight on her as they made their way to his bedroom. Tony was quiet the rest of the way, eyes cast down even as she got him close enough to collapse on the bed.
“Okay, I admit this is pretty damn good. And if memory serves me, just as good as Mama Rogers’. Now...that being said…”
“Leaving,” he answered honestly looking his Pop in the eyes. Steve’s heart had been through a LOT in the last twenty four hours. But this was his son, and he could spare a little longer for him. He steeled himself to continue, putting an arm around his boy’s shoulder.
“Stark!” Bucky shouted but couldn’t stop her. Daci moved swiftly, jumping up and placing her hand on the ankle part of his armor before Stark could move, instantly turning off the light of the arc reactor. He watched horrified as the metal suit collapsed with Stark in it, prepared to call for Steve when the Captain suddenly appeared by his husband’s side. An explosive arrow landed by Daci’s feet, knocking her back and allowing Stark some space.
“…you’re both disgusting,” she said before rolling her eyes fondly. She turned her attention to the window again as they pulled up to their home. He took that opportunity to check his phone, pouting at the messages.
“Did we break a mirror or something? What’s with all this shitty luck lately?” Tony mumbled as he reached back to grab Steve’s arms to wrap around himself. The blonde couldn’t help but chuckle behind him, since he had been wondering the same thing.
. No, I don’t see why it took you so long. You’re fucking amazing,” Tony said in disbelief as he rifled through the rest.
“Buh buh!” Morgan added as Daci felt a smile creep on her face, even though her father was looking more and more unhappy as the kids began chanting. Daci moved off his lap to sit next to Clint and could only laugh when her Tati looked at her with betrayal.
It was a small vehicle with dark tinted windows, driving down one of the hundreds of tunnels cascading throughout the Earth. They followed closely behind as it reached the surface, coming to a stop and turning to face the men - who slowly landed upright to walk over to the vehicle.
Said spineless sperm donor decided to grace Tony with his presence the next day. The Omega was hard at work with his latest design in renewable energy, elbows deep in designs when there was a sudden knock on the door.
“They reminded me that I used to sell myself, saying this wasn’t any different. One asked who participated in my orgy and wanted details. I was so shocked and…hurt…that I just grabbed my stuff and left. I called Happy who gave me a ride back here.”
He instead used his thumb and stuck that in his mouth, giving the blonde a taste of where the night was leading. It had the Alpha waving a waitress down for the check, which had the Omega laugh in delight.
Clint still complained about a ‘cheap shot’ from Nat while she drove the three to the mansion. The red head scoffed without verbally responding, throwing a look the man’s way as he poked the bruise on his ribs.
“¿Porque no los dos?” he asked innocently before diving in to his task at hand. The subsequent screaming encouraged him to continue to live up to both roles.
"This the blonde?" Steve asked, stiffening Daci further when she realized her father had talked to Steve about the woman. She also turned and noticed Clint scowling and taking a few more drinks of the alcohol.
“Fuck you!” she said, spitting some of the blood in her mouth at him. He sucked his teeth a few times while he wiped the blood off his face.
“Well hello to you too, puppy. Don’t worry. We love you too. Very much,” Steve murmured with misty eyes that settled on Tony and leaned forward so they could kiss again. After a deep kiss the two settled once more as the Omega found the remote to pick the next movie from their queue.
He heard footsteps a few minutes later, his brother joining them while he wiped his eyes in exhaustion.
“No problemo, Buckaroo,” Tony sang, currently tickling Harley on his lap and making the boy shriek with laughter. Daci smiled at the sight, and at the nickname Tony gave her father, who looked angry at the name.
But before he could register that anything was happening, her brunette father quickly shoved him into the bath with her. She shrieked with laughter and wiped some of the new bubbles from her face. She has never laughed this hard in her life, watching her Daddy sputter up out of the water - fully clothed.
Tony put his hands on her shoulders to turn her to face him. “That doesn’t make it okay for people to say it to you. You are not responsible for the things that were done – to you¬ – in your past. And you sure as shit don’t deserve some prissy little tramps trying to make you feel bad for it either.”
“But it’ll be different. You’ll leave and forget about me and fall in love with someone else…” Clint trailed off, blinking away tears that spilled down his cheeks.
"You can't do this alone, so stop trying to do this alone. Do you think just because you're no longer the youngest that you can't come to us in need of comfort? I know you had a nightmare that night I helped Miles with his," he said as he pulled the teen onto his lap and swaddled her in comfort. She looked a little perplexed before rolling her eyes, able to figure out Jarvis had been the one to rat her out.
Except right now, when said brunette with a prosthetic arm was bugging him about joining them for drinks. Steve was perfectly content sitting on the couch snuggling up with Lucky, but apparently his brother had other ideas.
“At least stay for a few minutes, it’ll be a good distraction.” Emerson’s smiled dropped as she looked confusedly at Steve, before her face turned to anger. She closed her eyes and clenched her fists before continuing.
“Say, Moe Curly and Larry, why don’t you guys go back to whatever shitty music video auditions you just came from, and leave the lady alone, huh? Or should I play some Ting-Tings for you stooges?” The leader scoffed, standing tall but still a good two inches shorter than Wade before looking behind him at Emerson.
Howard released him as he tried to stand up tall, though when Tony finally sat up, he realized just how short his father was in comparison to future his father in law. Steve suddenly appeared by his side, grabbing his arm to help him up as both their fathers had a stare off.
“He’s six,” Tony answered for him. “I was seventeen when I had him. He’s um, the reason I dropped out of school. The pathetic sperm donor fled to Europe when I told him and it’s been us two ever since.” Steve was looking at the cute pup who did indeed jump off the monkey bars but picked up on the tone of Tony’s voice. Turning back, he frowned at both the look and smell coming off the Omega - a combination of sadness and insecurity.
“Jarvis! Champagne please and sparkling grape juice for my first grandpup,” Howard called out, clearly already a little tipsy from the scotch he had with their meal.
“My big sister dated this fuckface a while back, he used to hit her…” he trailed off, thinking of the ass-beating he had the pleasure of watching when their Dad found a bruise on her. Can’t really say he felt back for that punk Nick, though.
“It’s…perfect. I can’t even articulate how much I love what you’ve done; but I promise you…” he said as he took a step closer to the brunette, towering over him with a predatory grin, “…I will show you this evening just how fucking much I love it. And you,” he finished as his hands grabbed the smaller man’s waist to pull them closer.
“Too fast,” Peter said with a pout, sliding into the seat next to her as she only offered him a smug grin in return. She was in too good a mood today to let him guilt her.
The door opened, revealing his Pop and Peter was eternally grateful for that. He figured at this point he was all lectured out…or at least hoped he was – he had made it clear he was very mad and very proud of his son…after several one sided “talks.”
“That’s great Tony! Maybe we can bring up adoption soon?” Tony simply smiled up at the man before grabbing his shirt and pulling him back down to kiss him again. He would never get tired of kissing that man. After a few more minutes of making out, Steve pried himself away, remembering the breakfast promise.
His laugh was infectious as he carried the two to the kitchen, gently placing his son down on the tile floor.
"I'm sorry...who's son is he?" Helen asked as the grandfathers continued laughing - all well aware of the stories of a young and constantly naked Jo.
Sure enough, Steve was in the kitchen dipping some strawberries in melted chocolate. Tony tried to behave himself when he saw the blonde lick some chocolate off his fingers as he turned to greet the two.
“I think we need to call security, Margaret! This unstable iron man fan wants to check on Mr. Stark but doesn’t have any form of ID…” Janet sneered.
“I’ll throw in Steve’s blueberry and peach cobbler,” Tony said to Rhodey with a smile, enjoying the playful scoff from his husband. He also sent his oldest friend a meaningful look, considering the conversation they had earlier.
“G’andaddy!” the boy cried in his cracked-sleepy voice as Peter handed the boy to his Dad, the older brunette squealing in equal excitement.
“You are a spy, something you don’t normally advertise on your resume,” she squinted back at the man, thoroughly enjoying Okoye’s face breaking into a smile.
“You’re wearing makeup on your face,” Tony pointed out quietly, causing the teen to blush furiously at them. Steve looked at his husband first in confusion, before extending the look to their daughter who was looking at anything but the blonde.
“Yay G’anddaddy!” Izzy exclaimed, finally wearing floaties, as he jumped into the pool next to them. Her Dad lifted him up out of the water before tossing him a few feet away.
Emerson smiled before answering, "cause he 'borrows' things, mainly his foster father's tools. Because he wants to build a robot. The parents are concerned because there are two other children under the age of five there and since the father is carpenter and the mother is a teacher, they well, can't afford the
“Daci! Daci did you hear we’re going to paint today?” Peter asked, coming to a halt in front of the table with crepes and eating one.
“I think you should go back to your floor before your Dad finds out you left and gets more upset.” She couldn’t help but glare at him, not even attempting to protest as she quickly made her way back to her floor, a strong grip on Wolf. She couldn’t hear Steve anymore, walking into the kitchen to find her Tati talking on the phone in a quiet voice.
“Pete? Are you okay?” his Pop asked, putting down the tablet the three had been laughing over. He quickly regained his senses as he made his way to join them.
, Joey?” he asked again patiently, unfazed by her anger towards him. She took a breath, redirecting her anger away from the innocent father and turning to the guilty one.
“Breaking and entering, assault of a minor, driving while under the influence…I don’t know…Hill said she’d send me a copy of the police report,” the blonde said.
“Sweetheart, we need you to breathe okay? That was a bad dream. Your Pop and I are safe and bored and absolutely alive,” Tony said. She could hear Steve scoff a little next to him. Her heart eased up a little at that. Chipped a little of the anxiety away.
“You can still read her a story, Mother Goose, I’m sure she’ll be smiling in her sleep from it,” Buck said as he put his shoes and coat on. “Not that I’m jealous, or anything,” he added with a wink before grabbing his keys to leave. “Bye punk.”
Saturday morning rolled around and Steve was just as excited to see Tony, grabbing his backpack before texting him he was on his way. He got a text back after he started his truck, telling him to drive safe and giving him the gate code to get in.
Gently knocking on the door, he let himself in and kept the door open. Harley was under his covers, evident by the lump on his bed.
Their fourth date was a mutual agreement to see a movie. Steve still wanted to be careful and avoid any pictures being taken – reassuring Tony it was an ‘out thing’ rather than a ‘Tony thing.’ And they seemed to get away with it, Tony driving them back to his mansion as the two continued looking around for lurking cameras. Steve of course spent the night, loving the way he gets to wake up with Tony as the little spoon in his arms.
“If I could do it all over again, land the plane safely...I would still choose to submerge it and be in a frozen coma for another seventy years. Because it would bring me to you, and I would choose that every time. You are the love of my life, you incredibly smart, wonderfully kind, beautiful bodied dumbass. And I look forward to spending the rest of our lives proving it to you, if you haven’t figured that out already.”
“Hey Leo,” she said with a smile as he offered a smile back. He looked around, even though they were still the only ones there, and approached her slowly.
The genius found himself responding with a half growl half moan, turning to bite his love’s neck in hopes of giving the bastard a hickey for all of this.
“I’m sure you do,” Tony said as Steve’s face once again burned. “What made you want to do that, by the way?” He took a breath and was thankful for the change in topic.
“So my mommas have what Joey has?” Jose asked with an adorably scrunched up face. Steve nodded again in response, wondering if he should cut them off from asking anything else.
“You know you can tell me anything, right?” Steve asked quietly as Tony waited for him at the door. She looked at those blue eyes, only nodding in response – knowing if she opened her mouth she’d be completely honest with him – before she quickly looked away and lied back on her bed. She ignored the sigh she heard from Steve, but did smile a little as he tucked the blankets back around her.
When the little girl settled against her chest, not without smacking her aunt once with her floatie, the girls watched as the boys alternated between cheering Leo on and dunking each other.
It was literally by the week with this kid, last week Steve was the only one who could make him feel better.
Alright, Tony deserved a little bit of that since he’d been snippy with Steve, but it was also kind of proving the theory that the brunette had developed in his head.
“Can I get two cookies Papa?” Peter asked with a sniffle, mostly past the crying and making Steve suddenly proud in that moment.
“Fair enough. We’ll check on you guys in a few days. Come on Maria, let's check on Peter before we leave,” Howard said warmly, gently grabbing the older Omega’s arm and leading the two out of the room.
“It was actually Cheryl’s idea. A friend of hers found him on the side of the road. Brought him to the vet to get fixed up, but couldn’t keep him. She thought...she thought he’d help you out. He’s been at my house for the last few days. I was going to bring him yesterday but you weren’t at school...and I figured you might need some space. Fair warning, Suzie and Jackson are obsessed with him and threatened my parents with running away to come live with you...and Lucky.”
“You know what? That sounds amazing. Who wants a Disney movie marathon?” Tony asked his kids and sighed in relief as they all cheered happily. Well...Harley still clung to the man but turned his head to face the others with a small smile.
“We should get going, happy to house you whenever you need it JoJo,” Clint offered, smiling at the teen as he and Natasha made their exit.
Yeah he was probably screwed. But, like his dads reminded him months ago - he was an adult now. Old enough to make his own decisions.
They manage to get to Tony’s car without bringing any attention to themselves. There weren’t many people around, but Steve suddenly felt self conscious actually considering what would happen if someone saw him get in the car with THE Tony Stark. Those thoughts quickly slipped from his mind as Tony placed a gentle hand on his knee the ride to his mansion.
“Stop pretending you give a fuck!” Leo suddenly shouted at him while choking back tears. Peter stood frozen for a second, hating the implications behind that statement; because
Eh, maybe this isn’t really about me, she thought to herself. They both looked happy even if they were also talking over one another. She did add her two cents about not allowing any press, which she was thankful the adults agreed with as well. She was also thankful for Peter, who joined the group a moment later, reminding the pair that she’s still a kid and this would all probably be overwhelming to her.
He put his mask back on to start swinging back to the Tower when he heard gunfire. He changed his route, forgetting about the conversation he had with his Pop as he heard screams and could see smoke rising. When he landed on top of a nearby building, he could see several men with guns pointing in the same direction. He couldn’t see what they were pointing at and was about to swing down to help when he suddenly saw what grabbed their attention.
“Uno!” she shouted as she placed her second to last card down, skipping her Uncle Rhodey. Sam smiled realizing it’s his turn before frowning, realizing Em was about to win. He took a long moment to look at the numerous cards in his hand. Glaring at the cards before turning to glare at the three people waiting on him; before again turning to look at his cards.
"Miles, why don't you pick out which scarves will look best with this while I ask Dad something, okay?" his eldest asked an excited kid who ran off to comply. "You okay?" he asked the man after he turned to face him.
The strong but coiled body around her almost instantly relaxed at that. More cuddly bear and less murderous octopus. He rocked the two for a moment as she felt her body mimic his, relaxing more easily into the hug.
“They’re keeping Peter company,” Bruce replied as he helped Rhodey move a side table to display the food more easily.
She looked up at her Pop, who looked like he was considering her words. He looked back at her with a small smirk before responding.
“Uh fellas, everything alright in there?” he heard his husband ask from the other side of the door. He stole a glance at his little brother and ignored the pleading look and high pitched squeak.
The kids still insisted on giving them their present, which is currently hanging up in their bedroom. Wade had apparently helped weld metal picture frames together, making a giant circle out of the various shaped frames. Half of the frames were painted to look like his shield, the other half to look like Tony’s arc reactor. The pictures were of the four, Peter when he was younger, the couple on their wedding day, along with some professionals that Peter and Emerson had gotten done together. There was even a single faded baby picture of Emerson, she had explained to the teary eyed parents she contacted a few of her old case workers to find it, but it was the original. They hugged their kids for about an hour after that.
“Do you think they…” she began quietly, stopping to let a few tears drop. “Do you think they’ll hate me if I tell them?” Watery green eyes looked up at the kind woman, now leaning forward to hear her better.
“Like you were ever the cute one?” Steve chimed in, laughing as he caught the pillow his brother threw at him.
“Oh, it gets crazier. He’s Steve’s friend,” Tony said, clarifying when Rhodey didn’t look impressed. “From
She turned to her left to see Kimberly approaching her from about twenty feet away. She stood frozen as Sam made his way to stand in between the two. She reached up to gently touch her uncle’s shoulder in reassurance. She didn’t consider her a threat, after all.
“Hey I…I owe you an apology,” Steve said. Sam’s eyebrows furrowed in confusion as he waited for Steve to continue.
“Yeah, Smiles, meet anyone interesting?” Miles suddenly felt the desire to face palm, remembering that the suit had cameras on it.
“I called Dr. Strange, he said it should wear off in a few hours,” Bruce spoke up as they breathed a sigh of relief.
“Yeah, I said I went to hang out with friends and I’d be back by dinner, jeez why are you freaking out so much?” she said stumbling along up to him, yelping when he grabbed her arm to ‘help’ walk her back.
“Giraffes?” she pronounced the word carefully, legs moving on their own as she approached the funny looking animal.
He rounded the corner, stopping at the sight before him. The warehouse opened up to a field, which when he walked out into, was lit up with lanterns and revealed his friends and family holding their own lanterns in the background; continuing to sing in a beautifully slow harmony.
"What'd you make, babe?" he asked as he looked through the clear top at some orange liquid. Wade took his backpack off, taking out some hot and fresh bread and setting it on the counter by the soup.
“Focus Wilson,” Steve said playfully as they made their way to the top floor. The elevator doors opened upon a rather extravagant party, minus the music as the crowd broke away for the paramedics to come through. A tall and slim blonde made her way to them, introducing herself as Pepper Potts – the one who made the call.
“Tony? Could we have a movie marathon until they get back?” she asked the genius who looked relieved at the idea.
“You’re ridiculous,” Steve whispered as he gently stood up to bring Peter over to lie back on top of the genius. He smiled without responding, knowing the man was right and preferring to snuggle back up with his son.
“No you don’t!” Clint said more forcefully, shaking from his embrace and pushing himself to stand up. “You don’t know what’s going to happen, and neither will I! Cause I’m just your boyfriend that’ll be stuck in high school and can’t get to you or find out how you’re doing. Or know who you’ll eventually leave me for!”
“I love you too, Thumper,” her Dad said with a chuckle. “And I’ve already told you – I’m not going anywhere. Your Stark-ass is stuck with me.” She laughed a little before finally pulling back, sitting up as she looked down at her father. She felt her Pop shift behind her as she leaned back into him.
They had several hours to kill; and since it seemed like neither could sleep anyway, might as well reminisce about their Bucky.
“Really?” the Alpha asks above him, insecurity in his voice even as Tony could feel the Alpha hardening at the prospect.
“Are you telling me this isn’t you?” the bastard asked in a squeaky voice, fidgeting in place. The super soldier glared at him before looking at the magazine again.
“You guys were freaking cute,” Tony said as he looked at a picture of the two of them on the beach, Joe carrying Sarah piggyback while the two laughed.
“Pancakes?” she asked. Steve smiled and opened his mouth to answer but was interrupted by a familiar voice.
"Food's ready?" a now awake Pappy asked, getting up off his seat and wiping the last of the sleepiness from his eyes. Tony laughed as he stood up, grabbing a towel a passing Sarah handed him to dry both himself and Steve off as everyone else made their way to the burgers.
“Do you need any more help, Ma? Or can Tony and I go up to my room?” Steve asked before Sarah waved her arms at the two.
“You know, you used to be the cool one,” she said as she crossed her arms and pouted. She sunk in her chair, looking like she was actually thinking it over as Steve reminded himself to have patience with her.
Turns out they're not emergency messages - thank god - or at least not what he and his Pop would categorize as emergency. His father on the other hand, being the big baby that he is, was probably writing his eulogy. Miles had apparently brought a cold home from school and he took out their sister and Dad in the process. His Pop got called into an Avengers mission and wasn't able to take care of them, so he called asking Peter to spend a few days with them and help out.
“You already are,” he said as he selfishly relished getting to hold him. And it seemed Tony was able to read his mind again, chuckling a little before squeezing Steve tighter.
“Is Harley okay?” she asked with a smile when Morgan turned to crawl towards her. The toddler was still clinging to his father as the baby curled up next to Daci.
“Thought you could use some cheer. And an ear,” the woman said, chuckling at her own joke which finally put a smile on Buck’s face. The teen also rolled his eyes, because she always thought she was funnier than she really was.
“Of course, bear. Maybe if we both behave tomorrow Daddy will let us get ice cream after,” Steve said with a wink, so happy to hear his son giggle at that.
Daci has only met one animal and that was a street cat. After her Tati rescued her from HYDRA, they had to be constantly vigilant. Always on the run. He had promised to show her the world and teach her about all the different kinds of life when they could finally settle. But on their journey she came across a street cat. It was small and scrawny, but didn’t run when Daci slowly approached it. Just kept staring at her until Daci got within touching distance, then it took off before she could feel it.
Guns were drawn but he was able to evade the bullets, offering a few quips for good measure and stringing up most of the goons.
"Well, is there any chance you can promise you won't be mad? Cause Pop already kinda lectured me and administered fair punishment -"
“Front entrance, I didn’t feel like letting her inside,” Sam said with a smile. Steve returned it, grateful for his friend as he moved to face the woman he’s never even officially met.
One afternoon, Clint had asked him to come over, which the blonde hadn’t done in a few weeks. They made out on his bed and it seemed like things were going to escalate in the good way when Clint suddenly panicked below him. Bucky couldn’t help growling in frustration as he pulled back, hating himself for not letting the blonde take the lead.
“I’ll do my best,” Steve promised him, smiling when his son pouted before following the others out the door. He waved to his three babies and son in law before turning back to his grandbabies.
"I apologize then old friend and allow me to take the axe and give it to him next year when he is closer to manhood," Thor offered. Steve couldn't help but smile at that and even chuckled when he heard his son laugh at the man. Tony returned a moment later without the axe, walking over to Steve to take Miles from him. The boy complied and rested on his other father's hip with a smile as the shorter man addressed the god.
They walked into the living to find Tony already there, apparently with the intention to surprise them. The tables quickly turned when the brunette saw his kids' new haircuts. Tony's eyes widened dramatically at the sight of the them, accepting the hug Miles gave him after climbing onto the genius' lap.
“So are we going to sit out here going over my sexual orientation or do you want to go back inside and dance?” Wade finished his cup, standing up to offer his hand to Peter. Peter grabbed it, standing up next to the guy he’s been in love with for two years. He hesitated a moment longer before quickly kissing Wade on his lips, unbelievably happy.
They all made sure to sing 'happy birthday' obnoxiously loud, Clint and Sam adding "you look like a monkey and smell like one too," to the song. Steve stole a glance at his kid, whose face was lit up with pure glee as her girlfriend stole an adorable kiss on her cheek.
“You are,” Joey confirmed with a smile. May looked at the teen for a moment before wrapping an arm around her shoulder, pulling her into her side. She rested her hand on the top of Joey’s head, gently running her fingers threw her hair. It was such a kind and simple move, but it suddenly felt like everything to the girl.
“Now, Miss Smith, I understand the desire behind living with rich superheroes,” began the DHS official, “but you must understand our hesitation given your…history with men.”
Did Steve say refreshing? He meant disgusting. Cause Buck had Clint up in his arms and was now visibly groping the blonde’s ass.
“Emerson,” Steve croaked out - voice full of emotion. “Baby, you were six years old. All you did was love your sister for the short time she was here before…sending her back to Heaven. You saved her from a fate worse than death, baby girl. So of course you’re not going anywhere; we still love you.” Her cries had begun to taper from exhaustion and comfort.
What did surprise her, was one of the girls walking alongside her. Cara Sams, the gorgeous teenager Joey was head over heels for. They were actually friends once upon a time, back when they were in second grade. The one who recently started dating a jock and apparently was now friends with Staci – the skinny bitch set on making Joey’s life a living hell.
"Well you remember I was sick a while back? And then she was out of town, and then I thought I had been doing pretty great anyway, so I just hadn't...rescheduled," she finished explaining as she felt him grow more rigid around her. She knew she was in deep shit when he pulled his hand out to guide her chin to face him.
“–oh I’m sorry are you the pot or the kettle in this scenario?” Sam asked with a brow raised. Steve looked at him confused as the man rolled his eyes. “Seriously, Steve? Like I would ever
Later that night they ordered in, feeding each other the decadent dessert and ruining the nice couch.
“Steve’s phone. Oh my god...yeah of course, which hospital? Oh...okay we’re on our way. Stevie get up, come on, I’ll drive you.”
“Yeah, it’s probably nothing…” she started to say, noticing Cara was smiling at her from across the cafeteria. She smiled back and stopped when Xavier snapped his fingers in her face to get her attention.
She pulled back to laugh at him, rolling her eyes fondly at the man before she wiped her eyes with her hands. He chuckled along with her as she shifted more comfortably on his lap to rest the back of her head against his shoulder, the genius wrapping his arms around her once again when she settled back against him. She then gently grabbed one of his hands and started tracing the lines on it.
“Drop me off? Why can’t you guys just wait outside for me?” he asked as Tony helped Joey to her feet, leaving the bottle on the ground and walking her back to the car.
“Abso-fucking-lutely I do! I can take the time off work, Pepper would probably prefer me away from work right now anyway – been doing nothing but piss her off lately. But yes! Absolutely, when do I get the little monkey?”
"I don't need a thermometer, I'm not that sick. Deal with the children first," his Dad grumbled as Peter tried to put it in his mouth.
“My Daddy!” the five year old cried painfully. The three adults quickly approached them, Pepper closest and trying to reassure the five year old with quiet whispers.
A few days later, and after several more tests, he decided to put on his big boy pants and tell Ty. What he expected, he wasn’t sure. But it wasn’t for Tiberius Stone, who’d been his boyfriend for almost two years, to up and move to Europe. The fucking coward.
“Right, I get it...so maybe you should get the fuck out,” the blonde spit out, words like acid. Bucky stood there a moment, staring at Clint and taking a deep breath.
They had prepared the kids on the plane ride over by telling them about meeting him, and the results weren't surprising. Peter was excited about seeing his Uncle Bucky, Emerson was weary of meeting her father's ex, whiles Miles was excited to meet any friend of his family's. The kid pointed out that he loved Aunt Pepper who used to date his Dad, so he was sure he'd like Mr. Bucky. Kid's logic never ceased to amaze Steve.
Steve shook his head, and Clint saw him silently pressing his Avenger's card in his pocket. It flashed briefly as the arrows lit up to send the signal. Cap slipped the card between the seat cracks.
“Man, I liked those shorts,” Clint quipped, climbing painfully to his feet and offering Bruce his hands to help him up.
The city was already waking up far below him with honking cars and meandering flocks of morning commuters lining up to get their coffee under the street lamps.
"I think that doof loves everybody. You too, Bruce. He loves you too," Loki told him adamantly. Thor was full of love and was far too willing to throw it at others, even Loki himself.
"Getting into a creepy taxi sounds like a really dumb thing to do. Why'd they go and do that?" Without waiting for an answer, he put the little gadget he'd been working on onto the table and snapped his fingers.
"Well. It's just that, uh." Clint gestured around the room. "Your lab's a mess. My room's just up the hall." He jerked a thumb in the direction—dropping his blanket.
"I don't actually know who did it," Johnny said, leaning over to stare into the card closely. "Everybody's gone and Herbie's trashed."
“Does that sentence worry you?” Tony asked Cap dubiously, his tone clearly saying that it worried HIM. What exactly did Thor and Bruce have to hide from the rest of the team?
“Yeah, Wade mentioned that part,” Tony said, pouring himself a cup of the coffee and looking nonplussed. “Made a mountain of pancakes, too.”
"Really," the husky man growled suspiciously, leaning forward to look down at Peter's face. "Playin' dead ain't going to save yer skinny ass."
“Wow. It’s like you read my mind,” he said, laughing nervously and feeling his face get warmer and warmer. God he hoped Matt had left by now. “Don’t tell anybody, okay? We’re kind of flying under the radar a bit ‘til he realizes dating a guy my age won’t make the rest of the team think he’s a creep.” Was that too real?
Now what was he supposed to do? Bruce actually seemed like he wanted to spend time with him. The scientist had even made it sound like he might skip fishing and hang with Clint by choice. That was nice.
Bruce sat on the rock with his feet hanging off the side into the water. He was facing away from the beach, but looked over at Clint almost immediately, gaze traveling over the big scrape on his cheek.
Tony stared at him, and he swore to God the storm rolled back and the clouds parted at those three words he’d been sure he’d never hear. What was this, a Disney movie?
Peter was kind of flustered and baffled they were just stating themselves as his parents, and stammered a bit as he filled in, "She's just another visitor on the beach, I-I just met her yesterday and invited her to the frisbee game. It's no big deal, really!"
“For the part about Tony and Cap being together, or about us being together? That elephant statue DOES look pretty graphic at that angle,” Bruce joked dryly.
Peter snorted and shook his shoulder to try and dislodge Deadpool like he was an annoying bug or something. This wasn't good—Aunt May couldn't meet Deadpool. She could NOT.
Laughing nervously, only to realize that he WAS laughing nervously, Clint turned and started off down the hallway. What the actual hell, man! He scolded himself mentally.
"Ah...wh—huh?" Bruce stumbled over his words, looking at the blond in obvious surprise. He actually took a step back before holding up his hands, the scanner still in one, and quickly shaking his head. "I-it's not...like that. Really."
The scientist cleared his throat and hastily averted his eyes to the nearest bright point of color—a fire hydrant, as it turned out. He stared at it for an uncomfortably long moment before sighing and slumping in his seat, covering his face with one hand.
“Hallelujah! The power’s been restored! The apocalypse has ended!” Wade pumped a fist in the air (dumping lettuce from his sandwich) and ran to give Peter a hug.
"Bruce, I have a cell phone." The other man said dryly, pulling it from his pocket. He poked at it for a minute and held it to his head. After a really long pause he frowned.
"Our comrades are in peril—this cannot be ignored for idle pursuits!" A few moments passed, a bland tune playing as the numbers above the elevator doors ticked down. The elevator door hissed open at last, revealing the underground hall.
He figured it was probably safer to put some distance between them until he figured out why exactly he was noticing the things about Clint that he was suddenly noticing. Maybe he could pretend to walk over and examine the sandwich shop hours sign...yeah, good idea. He did so.
Watching the two of them move to start another game up, Tony did his very best not to give Cap any side eye. He would just be looking glum, he'd been looking glum for over an hour now. Too bad getting drunk on root beer was not a thing.
“Wowza!” Wade knelt in front of Hawkeye. “Dude, you’re almost as angry as Wolvie! Oh hey! You’re bleeding like him too!”
Groaning in annoyance, Loki got slowly to his feet. His stitches had definitely been ripped clean open. Blood was seeping through the hand that had been held tightly against his wound.
"Whoa, whoa, wait. Is Peter dating this guy, or Spider-Man? SHIELD would only know Spider-Man, and we've got to know which of his lives to poke around in!" He knew for a fact that SHIELD didn't know who Peter was. He'd hacked their database a time or two, and checked on their Spidey files every time just in case they got too close to the truth, but they never had. Probably because SHIELD didn't seem to think Spider-Man was that big-time of a hero, even though he frequently spent time with the Avengers.
"...Nothing better happen to him while I'm gone," Tony said finally, a bit irked about the whole thing. For one, the last thing Doom needed was an infinite power source. For two, he couldn't think of any snarky comebacks for the current situation.
As desperately as he wanted to swig down a bucket of coffee, Bruce had gone up to the cabin. Following after him meant that Clint might have to come up with words and put them into sentences way too soon.
Glancing up and down the sidewalk, Loki frowned. There weren’t that many people around. Most seemed to have retreated to cooler places. The demi-god made sure that he was alone, than he summoned an ice cream cart across the street. Immediately, a trickle of people turned off the main road to surround the imaginary cart. They’d thank him later when the illusionary ice cream didn’t make them fat.
"Don't worry about it." Clint settled on the couch right next to Bruce, scooting intentionally closer to him. He wrapped his blanket around him again, cocooning himself in…and giving Bruce a sly smile.
"This 'news' is to inform, is it not?" Thor was still offended. "To tell anything less than the truth is a failure of his duty! I prefer to watch the nature over this deceit." He shook his head disapprovingly and reached for the popcorn. Ever since Bruce had made a bowl of popcorn during movie night, Thor had it nearby any time the television was turned on.
“Are you serious? Yes. Wade likes you…really likes you. I’m shocked it took you this long to figure it out. Subtlety isn’t his specialty.”
Growling, Clint plucked the book off his lap and stood, aiming for the back of that punk’s blond head.
“Is Hawkeye in some sort of trouble, Stark?” Thor’s voice made Tony flinch, and he practically shoved Cap away from himself. Damn it.
“Tony,” Cap said softly, sitting his root beer bottle aside. “Honest to god, Tony, I thought the same thing—”
Stopping dead at the bottom of the steps, Clint crossed his arms and frowned at the white sandy shoreline.
With that, he pressed the screen and tucked it away and then grinned at Bruce. "Trust me, these sandwiches are worth the wait."
"Yeah. I guess I better go." Deadpool shrugged, sitting up. "It'll take forever to get to Dallas!" He looked over the roof edge casually.
Cap sighed. Getting undressed seemed like a lot of work right now. He bent to untie his shoes, but wobbled—ending up on his butt on the ground. He groaned, running a hand through his hair.
“Makes sense,” Tony said, nodding as he crawled back out from under the kayak and was promptly soaked by the rain again. “There’s plenty of space out here, I guess.”
"Oh yeah? I guess he probably wouldn't admit it if he did, but I've never even SEEN him on a date," he confessed. "So maybe he's on this vacation to get away from things, huh?"
Miss Marvel made a great centerpiece for the medical room—especially since she glowed. After finding Cap dragging Tony up the stairs from the basement, she had insisted that it was better for everyone to be in one place for now.
“THOR? Why would Thor be out…” Deadpool trailed off, hand with the webbed up gun reaching back to rub his neck. “That was totally Thor breaking that tree. Huh. Didn’t recognize him without the cape.”
The archer didn’t reply loudly enough for Tony to hear what he was saying, instead picking up his pace and pushing ahead to walk with Bruce. The scientist looked far more comfortable hiking through the woods than he usually did in the city. Tony had gotten the idea to camp here from Bruce, who liked to go fishing in the nearby lake on his days off.
The image of Clint fell away into a swirl of green magic, finally revealing Loki's true face. He looked exhausted and pale as he sighed deeply. It was hard to tell if it was a sigh of irritation or relief.
"Tell m-me the t-truth." Steve took the water, looking up at Tony. "Is it bad? Will Miss Potts be a-alright?"
From his rooftop vantage, Peter could see that most of the city was still dark from the power outage. School had indeed been canceled and his schedule was open now. His spider senses suddenly made his neck hairs raise.
"We should probably talk to Cap tomorrow, though," he said a bit guiltily. "The last thing I want him to think is that I'm angry at him."
Tony exchanged a glance with Cap and started that way. If some super villain had somehow managed to cram themselves into the damn trunk to get at them, he was gonna...
“Can I talk to you? Please?” Cap asked, frowning at him through the crack Clint had opened in the door.
"Because of the Hulk," he repeated. "If anybody gets in trouble because the other guy had a tantrum, it's going to be me. Don't worry about it."
Somehow, 'lady I just met on the beach wants to have a summer fling with him' seemed like a strange explanation. Peter decided to try and stay a little vague, shrugging and being casual about it.
Bruce busied himself with working on some mixtures, hopefully for Cap's cure. Now that the power was back up, he probably ought to take advantage of it.
"About as well as you trying to power a high tech mansion off your heart," Steve replied dubiously, tugging a wire out.
Tony always had to keep an eye out for tabloid reporters recording things without his permission, and just on the off chance that any Avenger didn’t take the news that great, he’d hatched a plan to take the team somewhere remote where no cameras would be rolling.
"Jane and Thor haven't been close for months. He was away on Asgard and they drifted apart." It wasn't a complete lie. The big demigod had hinted at the same. Thinking better of it, Cap didn't sit on the table, though he did lean on it to stay on his feet.
--and ran right into Bruce, who made a little 'oof' sound and nearly fell over. Unlike his green alter-ego, the guy didn't weigh very much at all.
"Is that true?" She asked Bruce. "No, never mind. Where are Tony and Cap? Deadpool's just here to visit Spider-Man, but I have no idea where he is."
Thor stepped over to the cell door and offered Clint a hand to help him step out, like he'd been imprisoned for days and was finally granted a pardon.
Taking a breath to settle his thoughts, Cap couldn’t help a glance back at the bonfire. Tony and Clint were drinking together right then, joking and chatting away. If they WERE dating and had had problems, hopefully they were all solved with a drink and a smile.
"There it is!" He pointed excitedly at Stark tower before returning his arm around Spidey—only a little bit lower than before. He squeezed Peter, pressing his chin against the web-slinger's neck to speak in his ear. "I think they changed the name though."
"Clint, can you help carry the..." He nodded down at the couch. "The other Clint, to the medical room? I need to redo his stitches."
“Stony sounds like we’re talking about rocks,” Peter said, smiling despite himself. Wade was so weird, but he was fun to be around. His heart was in the right place, too—he really seemed to want Cap and Tony to get together already. Like most everybody else on this vacation…
Peter instantly shot a web to the nearest building and swung to stick to the wall, shoving his mask back on. He looked back the way he had come, trying to see who had attacked Wolverine.
“What?” He coughed, paddling back up to Tony. “No. Tony… No. Peter isn’t… There’s no way he’d…” The blond seemed to be struggling with the idea, barely staying above water as a parade of emotions passed over his face. At last, he scowled. “You’re wrong.”
“Yeah, good idea.” Bracing himself to get smacked in the face by the weather again, he pulled the door open and stepped back into the storm.
“C-can we get married? I know it’s old fashioned, but please.” Abruptly leaving Tony to stand on his own, Cap dropped to one knee. “Please,” he said earnestly, dropping his head to rest on the backs of Tony’s hands.
Shucking the poor onion of its dry skin, Wade slammed it down on the table and chopped it in half with one slice.
The sky didn’t open up and dump rain on them, though. No, the thunder was just announcing the arrival of Thor, who came flying down out of the sky and landed heavily on the ground beside his tent. He had two people with him, one held under each arm. The first was Wade, soaking wet and dripping water in the campfire, and the other…
“Dammit! It’s been three hours!” Hawkeye shouted, cutting off Wade’s story of woe and tacos. “What the hell kind of shortcut is this?”
"Then how a-are we going to get everyone in one place?" Looming or not, Bruce still qualified as a mad scientist. Because...he was angry all the time. The blond repressed a tired laugh. He had been around Tony too much.
It had been nearly an hour since Tony had flown off with the others. Clearly Thor hadn't met him halfway with the Arc reactor or anything strategic like that. Go figure, Steve was the strategist of the Avengers.
Oh right. He hadn’t slept. Bruce had refused to sleep in the tent with Clint and Thor, instead taking his sleeping bag and going off alone into the bear infested forest.
Thor had placed Loki—who still looked like Clint's identical twin at the moment—onto a medical bed, and was binding his wound carefully. Judging by the skill, either Asgardians got hurt a lot in battle, or Thor had had a very long time to master basic first aid.
Thor blinked, his eyes flicking toward the trail back to the Avengers’ camp. He seemed to be choosing his words carefully a moment later when he replied, “Perhaps you should speak with him on the matter, friend. It is true that he was not in the best of spirits yesterday, but our conversation was a private one.”
"It has to be around six by now!" Clint muttered, finally checking his cell phone. Without comment he shoved it away and leaned back again, pouting.
Really? Tony looked at him and was grateful his sunglasses hid his eyes, because a whole bunch of things were probably readable in them right now. He arched an eyebrow.
“Yeah?” Trying not to look as nervous as he was, Clint stopped chewing his lip just as he dumped the cards all over the floor. Rubbing his neck, he sighed and looked at Bruce anyway.
"I plan to deliver him to my ally," Doom said matter of factly. "If he were to be snatched from beneath her nose just after, I will still have fulfilled my end of the bargain."
Oh, no, did they know about him and Wade? A flash of dread hit him before common sense chimed in that if they were that worried, they wouldn’t be camping out doing target practice with Hawkeye’s bow and arrows.
"Where I wanted to be, at the Hulk's side." Loki turned to look at Doom again. "I think you're going about this the wrong way, my good doctor. Bringing my idiot brother to you makes him expect trouble. He'll be more guarded. More alert."
Grabbing the big hand with both of his, Clint grinned up at the Hulk. He was not wearing a sombrero, but he had to be a drunk illusion anyway.
All of them looked like they had been filmed with an old cell phone and most of the dialogue was so wooden, you could build a fence with it.
Peter's head was starting to ache. He couldn't just leave Wade with hero mentor parental units 1 and 2, though, so instead he circled around to try and talk to Cap. Preferably before he used Wade as spare firewood.
“Are you alright?” She asked him, delicately placing a hand on his shoulder as he stopped next to Peter.
Wow, up close Clint's eyes were VERY blue. Was that the streetlights reflecting in them, or were they just that shiny normally? How had he failed to notice it was raining lightly until Clint's hair was damp like that? It actually looked kind of nice damp...
“Just the guy we wanted to see,” Tony said flatly. Clint only noticed Steve standing beside him looking grim because the archer was reaching for the nearest mug he saw. The Avengers co-leaders actually BOTH looked serious for once. Oh, great, what was Cap gonna find to lecture Clint about now? Was his arm bleeding AGAIN?
"Cap?" Pepper looked up at him, shading her eyes with the back of one hand and peering out between her fingers. She was sitting on the floor at the bottom of the first flight of stairs, her legs out in front of her, and looked a little rumpled. Steve was pretty sure he'd never seen her without her hair in a ponytail before.
"We are, and we aren't," Bruce sighed, watching him shuffle the cards. "I mean, we're different forms of the other. The only thing I'm immune to is gamma radiation--otherwise I can get hurt or sunburned or whatever else and it just doesn't seem like it, because turning into Hulk heals up whatever happened." He smiled wryly. "Thanks to this vacation, this will probably be the longest-lived sunburn I've had since the gamma bomb incident."
“I hate lying to them, though. I don’t know, maybe it’d be better if we just told them how it is,” he said, turning to wrap Wade in a hug. “C’mon, it’s not Matt’s fault we bumbled into the Avengers’ campsite.”
Bruce halfway suspected that no call had been made and that Clint faked it because he didn't want to admit the rain had fried the phone, but he only shrugged and stepped back over to slowly sink back down onto the bench with a sigh.
“Wow, this’s getting steep,” Peter commented, stepping up the hiking trail. They had been walking for almost two hours by now, and the path just seemed to slope higher and higher. Wade seemed unfazed, and Clint was keeping up fine (although he was pretty grouchy in general still, even after the coffee.)
"I'm not bad," Peter said cautiously, glancing at him. Leaning in, he whispered, "Do you feel left out because you can't get drunk like Tony and Hawkeye? Don't feel bad, I can't get drunk either."
Bruce looked surprisingly thoughtful about what he was saying. He crossed his arms and looked at Clint for a moment.
"I'm sure the police can handle it from here," Cap wheezed. He stopped a fireman as he was going into the building. "Be careful, it's some kind of chemical smoke." The man nodded and Cap turned back to Clint. "Let's head back to the mansion."
Glancing at Deadpool, Clint suddenly felt bad for the guy. He was so dumb, he’d never see it coming.
Scrolling back up, the green eyed man frowned at the article. It certainly made some outrageous claims about Thor and himself!
“I could always just go out there and turn into Hulk. I bet everybody would come running,” Bruce said. It was delivered so deadpan that only the little smirk along with told Clint he was joking.
A big hand gripped one of his arms and pulled him upright, placing him onto his feet. Peter wiped wet brown hair out of his eyes and looked up to find himself face to face with Thor. The most casually-dressed Thor he'd ever seen--the guy was wearing blue board shorts with yellow lightning bolts up the sides and a white tank top.
“Clint, stay out of this. I’ve had enough out of you this weekend!” Cap snapped, jabbing an accusing finger in Clint’s direction.
They had set up on a grassy ledge just above the lake, surrounded by fluffy trees and bushes. It provided a nice view of the lake and a bit of privacy, which made for a rather romantic sunset setting.
“Peter,” he began, blue eyes flicking Tony’s way. Then he pulled on a weary smile and patted Peter’s back again. “Let’s finish this castle.”
"You can't go out there in that condition," Bruce said, looking very tired suddenly. He rubbed at his forehead, his eyes fading back to soft brown, and he sighed. "Splitting up is the problem. We aren't thinking."
He still didn’t completely buy the ‘a bear startled me’ excuse Bruce had made, but the guy had been so obviously bothered and pissed at the suggestion that he’d been trying to hurt Matt that it had to have been a genuine reaction.
"We're JUST getting food, though," Peter warned. "No messing with the people selling the hot dogs, no scaring the civilians, got it?"
"Pills?" The Jotun sat up on his elbows, taking the glass. "Worth a shot." He took the useless pill and laid back down, stretching an arm over his head and smiling at Bruce. It was worth the sting in his side when Hawkeye growled.
"Sort of the second option," Tony said, arching a brow. "Why, is this too leisurely for you? No tech, no work, no idea what to do with yourself?"
Who else would they hook a heart monitor to...? Groaning a little, the scientist slowly sat up and squinted around the room, trying to get his bearings. That's right...Clint...bedroom...wait, why were they in the BED, though?
“Great, thanks,” he told Thor as nonchalantly as he could, getting the fire set up to light. His mind drifted back to Peter, camping somewhere further up the hill with Deadpool. Unsupervised. If they didn’t hear from him by noon, Tony was going to go check on the kid.
"You hope you DO get pneumonia...?" Bruce asked, taking hold of his side of the vest so that Clint could let go of it. Not that there was anywhere for the archer's arm to rest, with Bruce sitting right up against his side to huddle under the vest. Clint's arm was behind him at the moment.
Squeezing Steve’s hands, he automatically smiled to mask his inner bewilderment. He’d been so sure he was about to get rejected, so ready to try and scrub that hopeful future side by side from his mind, and this…was a lot.
While it wouldn’t bother him to be out in the elements, Tony was a normal man, and if there was any chance that he’d get ill or, heaven forbid, struck by lightning, Steve would rather paddle through the storm.
“Maybe he’s one of those YouTube guys who makes bushcraft houses and livestreams it or something. I don’t know,” he said, shrugging. “All I know is that there’s no Spidey Sense tingling, so I’m not worried. We could go down to the lake and check it out, if that’ll make you feel better.” He hadn’t actually seen the lake yet since they’d arrived. When he’d offered to help Wade get firewood, he’d been hastily assured that his time was better spent making the campfire. Then making lunch. Then roasting marshmallows…
"Doom seemed to make the original to drink, so I made mine the same way." Needles didn't do so well with Steve, anyway.
"A show about weapons?" Bruce blinked. "That could be interesting, although I'm more partial to radiation studies. Any TV shows about that?"
“Welcome, Tony. Sleep tight.” Cap smiled back at him, crossing the room to turn off one of the hanging boat-themed lamps, dropping Tony’s half of the room into warm darkness.
“I still plan on talking to him, don’t worry,” Steve assured him. “Before we all headed off to bed, I guess he went to Peter’s campsite and destroyed it. He smashed the tent under a tree and ruined Matt’s glasses and his cane—which he can’t really manage without. Peter’s been helping him get around.”
“I wouldn’t mind knowing you better than I do,” Peter blurted out, and wow, that actually sounded halfway smooth. Weird. “If, you know, if you’re even interested in that.” ‘In me’ was what he WANTED to say, but that was just too direct a rejection if Matt turned around and said no. This was nerve-wracking enough as it was! They should be going out there and finding Wade and carrying through with the plan, that would be the easy distraction method. Peter didn’t want to be like Cap and Tony about this, though. He wanted to know what Matt thought, not avoid it.
"That's true. At least I got him to come back here." The blond gestured around the room with his eyes, keeping his arms hugged to his sides. "Man, I’m glad Hulk really likes his nap time."
Tony watched him dubiously. Bruce was smart, but this wasn't how Doom made the original cure. Maybe it had to be swallowed for a reason.
"Then that can't be the real Clint," Carol groaned, pressing a hand to her forehead. "It's probably a robot or a clone or something. We need to find Bruce!"
The fact that Tony couldn't tell which it was made the idea of making some painfully honest love confession terrifying, because what if he confessed and he was WRONG? There was no way to take that kind of thing back and leave their friendship intact...
Rain splashed into his eyes, but Steve still made his way around the outside of the mansion. The large shield dome above the mansion, though weakened, provided enough light for him to see. Some of the mansion's lights had come back on too, but they weren't very bright.
Loki took a deep breath, meeting Bruce's eyes with what he hoped was a calm gaze. He hadn't noticed the scientist's stubbly beard before. Then again, he didn't look at him very much. The Hulk should be able to break out of whatever the field was, right? If not, Loki might be stuck in there too. To be fair, he hadn’t actually tried getting out of Ms. Marvel’s dome yet.
"What do you think? Maybe we should be exercising some of this sugar off," he joked. It was a weak one, but he had to cut himself some slack, he was still processing what all of this meant--what it MIGHT mean. He shouldn't get his hopes up yet, maybe Steve had been about to totally shut him down, or... Or something.
Leaning closer, Clint felt HIS heart beat a little faster at the scientist’s touch. Feeling exposed, the archer kept his eyes looking anywhere other than at Bruce. That would just be awkward as hell.
"I'm not dying, I'm sleeping." He had tried to leave several times while they were outside, only to be stopped by an overly concerned Captain America. This day was awful!
Bruce was so used to beeping meaning a heart monitor that he was puzzled for a second when he was dragged off of the bed curled in the blankets and the beeping didn't speed up. Judging by the volume of the 'thunk', it was lucky that he landed on the floor instead of on top of Hawkeye.
“Ah, not to my knowledge,” he said finally, snapping out of his thoughts. “I’m sorry, I didn’t know you were…” For some reason the word caught in his throat. “You…know. I had no idea.”
Bruce blinked a little and glanced off to the side, trying not to look as conflicted as he felt. This was the Clint he thought of, deep down, as the real one. Who knew if that was true, though?
The inside of the cabin was dark. Either nobody bothered with turning the lights on or the power was out. Considering how expensive the resort was, it was much more likely that no one was there.
The inside of the house was stirring. Clint was grumbling under his breath, slapping a package of smoked bacon onto the counter top.
"You okay? Need something?" Tony was over by his side almost before Steve could look for him, offering a glass of water. "Try not to talk TOO much, or your throat's going to be sore later."
Beside him on the adjacent medical bed, Loki looked at Thor, now that the giant rage monster was gone.
“Clint, part of taking a break from your normal routine is slowing down,” Captain America lectured, hopping out of the SUV and turning to haul the cooler with him. “Tony will open the doors. Just help Bruce start unloading the car.”
"T-thank you," Cap called to the open door, looking back at Bruce. "How long until t-this stuff works?" He really didn't want to sound ungrateful, but if Tony was in trouble--he needed it to work now.
"Just pull it out already!" Loki snapped between gritted teeth. He was going to have words with Stark, then Thor, and then Stark again!
“I think we should pretend to be a couple. If Peter’s ashamed of being seen with his boyfriend, maybe we can put his mind at ease by leading by example. I know I’m asking a LOT,” Cap added, holding his hand up in case Tony tried to cut him off. “I don’t mean for us to do anything more than talk. But saying we’re together might help us get Peter and his boyfriend to talk more openly.”
"Okay. How about we all go to that side of the room and my evil clone blows the door with an arrow?" He suggested. Being injured was boring. It hurt and made moving difficult. If only he could get his hands on that bow.
"Oh, no doubt." The cosmic powered Avenger sighed. "We really should figure that out before we go chasing after magic trails," she said pointedly. "He could be a spy—and I don't mean the kind from SHIELD."
"You didn't even need to ask," Tony replied, stepping over to drape one of Steve's arms over his shoulders. "It must be weird actually getting tired like us mere mortals, right?"
Captain America's continuing efforts to escape his shackles were interrupted when the door slammed open and Clint was tossed into the cell on his face. Doom himself was looming in the doorway, his metal mask scowling at Cap.
Bruce had turned around quickly when he heard somebody else talking. He looked at Spider-Man, but said nothing.
“Sure thing bugs!” Wade practically shouted, spinning away from Hawkeye and trotting off like he hadn’t a care in the world.
As they arrived at the door, Matt slipped his arm out of Peter’s and knocked loudly. It was impossible to hear if there was any movement from inside with all the noise from the storm, but after a moment, the door pulled open to reveal T’challa.
Clint was made of snark, Peter was practically their adopted kid, and Bruce’s opinion on two men getting married was a complete mystery to the Avengers since usually he was the Hulk. And Thor said he was keeping secrets from them! What could it be? Thor took sworn oaths very seriously, so there wasn’t much chance of convincing him to tattle…
The thing Clint had spotted wasn't Bruce, but it was familiar. His vest was dropped there in the mud, the zipper side sticking up. There were some rather Hulk-sized footprints leading away from it, too.
"Why ARE you interrupting?" He asked whoever it was drolly. Much as he'd come out here to avoid talking to Steve, it seemed like they could've clarified some things until the new arrival got here. Was ONE private conversation with the man too much to ask for?
The super soldier nodded, but didn't reply. What in the world would Doom want with Thor? Of all the villains Captain America knew of, Loki was one of the few that would ever actually WANT Thor's attention.
"Wow, he actually found you," the billionaire said, chuckling. "C'mon in, you guys, make yourselves at home."
"We're not even officially together, Cap," he said sadly. "And if I'm this wrong about you and Tony, maybe I'm wrong about him too. Maybe we're just bros like he always says." Seeing Tony and Wade approaching with driftwood in hand, he sighed. "I'm just a photojournalist, what do I know."
"Aww, you can smell love? Can you smell tacos, too?"  Deadpool grinned, throwing his arms around Wolverine's neck and rubbing their cheeks together.
“Barton, what are you DOING?” Steve asked, leaning to grab the tackle box. Both blonds stared each other down for a second before Clint relented.
"Do I FRIGHTEN you, Captain? In your pathetic state, it would be trifling for Doom to force you to drink this serum..."
Bruce had already been under the covers, so he'd figured he should lay down. He was already laying down, so he'd figured he could close his eyes, just to rest them for a moment. And then he was asleep, just like that.
Slowly, Steve blinked, trying to gather his thoughts. After everything they’d been through together, he hadn’t been Tony’s choice. Maybe that was why Tony had been so offended by the article? It wasn’t that he was insulted the press assumed he was queer—it was who they thought he was sweet on.
Ahead down the beach, more whispering was happening as Peter leaned close to his boyfriend, waving his hands pointedly. Wade looked confused, but was nodding along with their conversation attentively.
The beach was gorgeous. There were indeed people around, though. Mostly rich fancy types on their folding lounge chairs, with massive colorful umbrellas over their heads while they read on their tablets.
"D-don't, don't...!" Thor shouldn't have let Loki anywhere near him, he thought. He was probably tampering with the reactor to make it explode or something. At least that was kind of what it felt like.
"Heed his words, friends. You appear to have been harmed enough as it is." He was eyeing Clint's bandaged side and Bruce's wrapped hand as he said it.
“Uh, yeah, that makes sense.” Clint turned and hurried back up the steps. Get Bruce out of the cabin, check. All Hawkeye needed to do was sneak the damned tackle box out of the living room and bury it, then he’d get the entire week with Bruce.
Deadpool lay on the roof, curled tightly into a ball. A branch had blown into him and was waving in the wind, not unlike a palm tree on a stormy island at sea. The mercenary didn't move, despite the pouring rain, thunder, lightning and wind.
"Yeah, tell me about it," Tony said over her com. "They went inside and Hulk didn't even rip any big holes in the walls..."
Peter hopped up onto the roof and stepped over to him, a bit cautious about touching him. He grabbed the stick and poked Deadpool's shoulder with it. "Uh...what're you doing up here?"
"Once Tony gets the power back on, Thor's card will work again," he reassured the blonde. "I'll call him up for you—okay?"
"Surprise, surprise," Peter muttered, crawling up to a higher vantage point to watch the two duke it out. "Hey, Deadpool," he hollered, "He says if ya don't give his bike back he'll take it out on me!" Not exactly Logan's words, but he really WAS getting to deal with Wolverine showing up randomly thanks to Deadpool's antics.
"Cap, I-I want to apologize for before. Walking off like that, it wasn't fair." He hugged his arms around himself, looking down at his toes in the sand. "You already definitely have stuff on your mind, and I just made it worse. I'm really sorry."
Swimming after him and easily matching his pace, he could see Cap frowning at him in the dim light reflected off the water.
Moving closer to get a better view of Clint’s arm, he started stitching. Wow, what kind of pills had those been? That hardly even hurt.
This week-long vacation had been in the works for months. Nick Fury himself had suggested it and had been working on it for months, guarding it as closely as any other secret. It took careful planning and dozens of highly encrypted messages, coordinating heroes from all over the place to cover the Avenger’s usual area of operation.
“I dunno, they just seem so married. They have breakfast together and chat about the news. And argue. A lot. Hey, let me get your back,” he said quickly, snagging the bottle and squirting a blob onto his palm.
Peter hadn’t actually spent any time up close to Loki, had only read about the Trickster on the database and seen some pictures. He hadn’t gotten one whiff of danger from Lola this whole vacation, so either Loki wasn’t there to actually cause trouble or the Spidey Sense was just as fooled.
As soon as the loud man spun to go that way, Cap started to sit the plates out on the counter, frowning to himself.
"Tony could have fooled me," Peter pressed, ignoring the change of subject. It wasn't because he really, really didn't want to explain Wade's Deadpool persona, nope, this was to help Steve and Tony... Sitting his plate aside, Peter hopped to his feet and held out his hands. "I know he's famous for being with models and other beautiful women, but listen, Cap, I work at a newspaper. Nobody's reported on Tony being with anybody since the Avengers formed, except the same ol' rumors about him and Pepper. It's part of why the tabloids keep thinking he's with YOU--he spends more time with you than anybody."
"A wall-nut!" Wade exclaimed, giggling hard and covering his mouth with his wrist as he doubled forward. He looked at Spider-Man. "...You know, because you like crawling on walls," the merc clarified, as if Peter wouldn't get it.
"These might work," Bruce commented beside him, picking a package off of the shelf--colored flags on a line, the type car dealerships and beach parties both seemed to love. "We'd have to put them on something for mini flagpoles, but there's plenty of them in here."
“Don’t try to lie to me, Parker. Odin’s filthy beard! You’re dating THAT moron?” Loki jerked a thumb at the water, staring Peter down.
"Now, see, I KNOW you're a night owl. It's only eleven, anyways. What's the hurry?" Coming back over, he snorted. "It's not like your papers are going to run away." He reached out to pat his friend's shoulder, looking Bruce in the eye. "They'll call us if they need us, buddy."
“Wait to what, blow up half the lake in a fight?” Tony raised an eyebrow. “What did he say he was here for again?”
The room was fairly small, leaving Bruce nowhere to sit except for the edge of the bed or the workbench chair. Since the chair was also covered in some kind of oil, he opted for sitting on the VERY edge of the bed, folding his arms on his lap and looking around the room in a fidgety kind of way, struggling to come up with something halfway intelligent to talk about.
"I do know how to meditate, Clint." Bruce sighed, looking at him with a blend of sadness and exhaustion. "I'm worse at it when I'm this tired, though. I-I'm so tired...of all this." He brought a hand up and rubbed at his forehead, covering his eyes.
From somewhere up the hill, the cracking of trees sounded in the distance. Tony sighed, sipping his coffee. It was a toss up whether that was the Hulk or Loki, but his bet was on the Hulk based on the direction.
"Okay, come on buddy." Hawkeye stopped, stepping around Loki to pull him up onto his back. He lifted him up with effort, giving him a piggyback ride. "You're making me feel bad."
“Me too,” Cap told him absently, turning and heading for the frisbee game. Tony was on the opposing team. That was probably for the best or Cap might try to talk to him in the middle of the game.
Well, wasn't that convenient. Ordinarily Peter would've questioned it a little more, but right now he just wanted Aunt May as far from Deadpool as possible. Leading his aunt by the arm, he popped open the door of the cab and gestured for her to get inside.
"No way," Clint growled, stepping up to glare the other him down. "Dude, there's no way you're real! I am. Or the other me. Whichever. But not you!" He sounded so adamant about it. Why did the second Hawkeye get a pass, but not this third one?
Jumping clear off the ground, Loki fell over away from the door—landing on his butt on the floor. The damn mortal was lucky HE didn't turn into a rage monster!
He stepped into the room and led Cap inside as well. It was a lab of some kind, with beakers boiling on burners lining the walls and some sort of examination table in the middle. The straps on it made it look like Doom was trying to play Frankenstein.
"Pepper? Oh, yeah, she'll be back to one hundred percent in no time," Tony said, sounding surprised he was asking such things. "This gas bomb thing was just aimed at you—it affects super soldiers, anybody else just has coughing fits."
Turning to Matt, Peter offered his arm. “If the weather’s still messing with you, hold onto me and c’mon—I had a second part of the plan to send Hawkeye and Dr. Banner out in their kayak for some time alone, and it might not be too late to still pull that off.”
"Yeah but he's looking more and more like his Umma," Tony said as he handed the toddler over to attack his favorite uncle before turning his attention to the baby in the blonde's arms.
“Nature didn’t make you fall on your face,” his husband pointed out obnoxiously. “Trying to grab my ass while not paying attention did that for ya.” Tony huffed in response.
“Harley is at Nanny’s house so he can have as many cookies as he wants,” the older Omega predictably replied, purposefully pushing the plate closer to the pup. Steve stole a glance at Tony, who was smiling fondly at the interaction.
She gave a small nod as she drank, remembering Peter introducing the AI to her in the elevator when she first arrived. It (he?) was unnerving, to say the least.
“Actually,” she teased with a smile, “I’d rather go on Ellen. You know, gay teen with gay dads on a gay woman’s talk show. It’d be
“That was like twenty years ago and you are so much hotter than Brad Pitt now!” Tony said with a small whine. Joey used that opportunity to pick off some chicken to dip in the sauce and taste, humming in happiness before Steve caught her in the act.
“Regardless, it’s not a conversation that’ll happen until Pete’s done being grounded,” his Dad said with finality.
"-I do!" Clint interrupted surprising himself. He had spent the last several Christmases with Nat after she hung out with her aunt and uncle. He couldn't remember the last time he'd been invited to actually celebrate the holiday.
“Cause he wants another kid?” his Pop asked gently, ignoring the offended scoff from his husband and his muttered “
"So have you thought of a name yet or are you waiting until you meet the gremlin?" Tony asked the girl practically dancing on her feet. Before Emerson could answer, his husband spoke up.
“I used to say the same thing,” Tony answered before gently petting the boy by his side. “People change Joey, it doesn’t always happen until…it happens. Doesn’t mean Steve doesn’t want you…”
She didn’t respond to the knock, staying curled in on herself and only bringing the blankets over her head as she heard her bedroom door open.
“Aw, that’s great pudding pop,” Tony said with a genuine smile, proud of his husband. “I’m proud of you,” he vocalized his thoughts, smiling when his husband blushed a little from the statement. A lethargic boy disrupted their conversation.
“You gotta put clothes on, baby,” he said as she started wobbling her bottom lip. “What if you pick out what you’re wearing, how about that?” he suggested as he began walking them in the direction of her dresser.
“I thought you said you’d be Mulan, Lilli-bear! Besides, all of us are dressing up, babygirl. And you gotta dress up to get candy, don’t you want candy?” the brunette asked as Steve felt his eyes roll automatically at his ridiculous love.
This baby – who, Steve was starting to think would grow up to be a nudist, as she stood naked in front of the tall man – then proceeded to cross her arms over her tiny chest.
“Not the point here!” he yelled. He swallowed some anger, but only some after she rolled her eyes at him. “Joey. Why did you punch a girl in the face?”
“You wouldn’t mind if the queen had one dance with her king, would you?” she asked, ever so sweetly. Tony felt a flutter of anxiety in his stomach, wondering if maybe Steve would’ve rather had asked her. He felt his friends gather behind him. Danvers herself, as promised, stepped up out of nowhere and got between the two.
“Why, hello there less attractive Rosie O’Donnell.” The group of five laughed at the joke while Joey stared unimpressed at the queen bitch.
He was walking alongside Emerson, stopping to read the menus posted outside the food carts that stretched for blocks. Their dads were on date night (which for the two usually lasted a full night and a half) so the pair decided to go out to dinner and a movie. They had convinced their dads they didn’t need a babysitter for a night (and a half) and took full advantage of it.
was what the pompous doctor suggested?” he heard Steve ask, now next to Bucky and offering him some tissues.
“Uhh,” he stuttered, looking over at his brother who was only smirking back at him. “I’m going for a run, Jo.”
“Okay, first of all you ridiculous child, Xavier loves you and has been texting me about all of this
“This is cause for celebration!” Thor bellowed once more. “Invite the others, we will drink and feast tonight!”
He luckily didn’t have to when his husband, his Steve, put his hands around the billionaire’s face and brought him in for a quick kiss on his lips. “I want that too,” the blonde whispered before looking into those brown eyes again, “long haul,” he added with a smile before kissing him again.
“We’ll be in touch, Tiberius,” Tony said, grabbing his pup’s hand and leading his family away from his past. Even though he knew deep down this wasn’t the end of that son of a bitch ruining his life.
“Okay,” she began, shifting away from both of them and sitting up against the headboard. “Well…but…” she pulled her knees up to her chest, cursing her watery eyes and shaky voice, “but you’re my…
,” the blonde said with such sincerity and confidence Tony melted into a puddle below him. “Tony...I know we shouldn’t rush things but...I think I already told you I love you. This is everything I’ve ever wanted...with my dream guy.”
“And why couldn’t you come tell me, huh?” he asked as he practically dragged her back to the mansion, ignoring her ludicrous question.
“I never said Papa!” she countered with a laugh, struggling to free herself in his clutching embrace.  Steve ignored her in favor of embarrassing his girl further.
He became friends with Harry Osborn, who was a year younger and looking to make friends. He was actually kind of cool, and Miles sympathized being the son of a rich genius. Both had pretty huge shoes to fill, though Miles also had Captain freaking America as his other parent.
“I do! I love dinosaurs!” the pup cried in excitement, turning to Tony as if needing his final permission. So, being the bigger man, Tony offered his pup a smile and a nod.
“I see how it is, don’t even need me,” he teased as he climbed into bed. They both laughed at that, Joey untangling herself to curl up with the father she was more concerned about tonight.
She dragged herself out of bed and used her adjoined bathroom to get ready, considering just asking JARVIS but honestly a little too tired to care. All she knew was that it wasn’t her wife.
“Where’d your hair go?” she asked, hesitantly reaching her hand out to touch his short hair. Tony couldn’t help but chuckle as he watched their interactions.
“Well,” Steve began as he continued kissing him, “we’d lay out in the sun, rub sun screen on each other…”
“Uh yeah, sounds like fun. I’ll have to rock paper scissors with Bucky to see who’s DD,” he said with a laugh, glad to see a smile from Tony as well. “I’ll see you tonight,” Steve said with a smile.
“Deal,” Steve said with that shit-eating grin. Buck rolled his eyes, knowing that little shit better than that and opted to have fun while on babysitting duty. So, you know, not very different than every other day in his life.
“Apparently you owe Nat $50,” he said with a small smile. Clint’s expression morphed from confusion, to anger before quickly returning the smile.
“Alright kiddo, wanna see if the water is how you want it?” She didn’t answer, just stared at the water as she began to feel herself chickening out. “How about I go get your Tati?” he asked gently after a moment, earning him a smile and a whispered “
“Yeah I was worried it was something like that. She might have faked her own death to get away. She could also maybe be from a different multiverse? I don’t know…why would she leave her behind though? She must’ve known what that would do to her,” he felt his eyes get misty when he looked back down at the angel in his lap. He smiled when he felt his husband reach over to kiss his cheek in comfort. The blonde extracted his arm from around Tony’s shoulder before settling his head on his shoulder, also cuddling into Tony.
He stole a glance at his Pop who was smiling back at him. Peter had told them it wasn’t something he wanted a few years ago, running a business like that. His Dad had explained that it was okay, he would find someone to run the Stark Empire – probably Pepper. And now…he did. And it was an actual Stark, too.
“Of course not,” Clint said with a bright smile, “we’re just getting started.” He couldn’t help laughing as James growled next to him, kept laughing when he saw Nat grab Bruce and drag him away - most likely for interrogation. He considered following her until he looked back at his boyfriend, who was frowning back at him. “What?” Clint asked innocently.
“Alright you two, I’ll be back before the sun comes up,” he said quietly, realizing she was mostly asleep. “Huh, she doesn’t look so riled up to me. Looks like you won’t even have to read her a story tonight, just pj’s and she’ll be lights out.”
,” she groaned, also finding it hard to breathe under his crushing embrace as he realized with a chuckle and loosened his grip. If only slightly.
“You spanked her Buck, there’s a difference,” Steve assured him as he placed a hand on his brother’s shoulder, standing near him for support. “Did you see her? She was barely even crying. Besides, would you tell Ma she’s the same as Carlton?”
“She doesn’t have a job, or volunteer and her only friend at school is Xavier. And I happen to know he’s out sick today cause I texted him about coming over for dinner. How often is she late coming home school? And how often have you seen her go straight to her room and not come greet us?” Steve asked with a pout as he finished making chicken alfredo.
“Buck, don’t get her all riled up. I’m the one who has to put her to bed while you go to work,” Steve said with a small frown, disappearing when his brother turned back; absolutely offended.
She would try to give this woman a chance...but there was just something about her Daci didn’t trust.
“That’s not what I heard,” she said as she hugged him from behind. “I heard about some snot nosed brat picking on my sweet baby brother. Which is not ‘okay,’ Peter Pan.” Steve shot Tony another confused look, though this one had a little ire behind it at hearing the news their boy had been bullied.
“But, where’s the uh…” Steve motioned with his hands, “controller? How are you making him move?” Tony blinked at him a few times before laughing loudly. Steve felt himself blush a little in embarrassment, until the genius quickly waved his arms in reassurance.
“Don’t worry about it. Not like you were the one who did those things,” she tried playing it off with another chuckle. He didn’t return the smile that time.
“No, no sorry – Carolyn’s here. Not psychopath, I would’ve knocked him out myself,” Sam said pointedly.
“Well yeah. I mean he’s my Dad and I love him. But Pop, he’s been your best friend and love of your life for over twenty years. So, don’t feel like you have to hold it together on my account,” she finished with a shrug. He rolled his eyes before bringing her back into a crushing embrace, only pulling back a bit when she yelped.
Joey felt frozen in place as she painfully watched her little brother feel this way because of her. She felt someone bring her into a side hug, recognizing Rhodey and ever thankful for him as she felt her legs suddenly turn to jelly.
His mother burst into tears, catching Tony a little off guard and unable to stop more tears from spilling down his cheeks. His father sat stoically and stared off at a wall, silent.
“We finger-painted earlier too, I have her canvas for you to take later. She’s got a real eye for color,” Steve said with a proud smile on the other side of Clint. “Which is weird...since she supposedly shares a hundred percent of your DNA…” Her Tati unwound one of his arms, reaching over one blonde to jab at the other blonde, which made everyone laugh around them.
of their educations by using what tiny power you have to manipulate their grades? Cause I looked over her essays and exams, you’ve been cheating her of her grades.”
,” she whined in embarrassment. She still felt angry, but it was overpowered by the guilt and shame and mortification and humiliation and self-pity and heartache all currently burning her insides out.
mission?” she asked, suddenly scared of what this all meant. She was happy that he was happy, even if it was scary that he could get hurt. He gently pulled her out of his embrace before sitting her on the kitchen counter, big arms bracketing her sides and bringing his face to her eye level. .
“Please?” she asked, putting her bottom lip out like she had seen the Stark children do to get their way. It worked immediately, the archer conceding with a huff before leading the way to the weapons area.
Steve brought him into a hug as they heard Sarah then simultaneously talk to his godmother while also trying to convince Helen to put the gun away, causing the teens to laugh and tighten themselves around each other.
Tony looked at his mother, going back and forth in his head whether or not to lie to her, but ultimately knowing she’d pick up on his bullshit.
A smile broke across James’ face before the brunette gave him the middle finger. Then, an idea came into the blonde's mind. Clint smiled, stood up a little straighter and signed as quickly as he could: ‘
He was beyond glad the mission ended sooner than expected. He missed his husband fiercely and knew the brunette was probably lacking some very much needed sleep worrying about him. He also knew Peter still had another day left at his camp, so Steve hangs on to the hope Tony and Emerson found a way to support each other with his absence.
However, he immediately rolled his eyes when she pretended to shoot him with her finger guns like the smug little brat she was.
Some time later, his phone rang. Tony silenced it when he noticed the screen name, not wanting anyone to burst their bubble.
“Fine! Whatever you clearly don’t love me,” he tried being manipulative, but Tony was ignoring him now as the two waited for others to join them at lunch. The genius was too busy staring at his massive crush to pay any more attention to his dear friend.
"Pop?" she asked as she pulled on his sleeve, the man stopping to listen. "Is it cool if I take a nap?" The blonde smiled as he nodded, placing his arm around her shoulder as they followed the group. He hugged her at the door to her private guestroom, kissing her on the head as the others looked at where they'd be staying.
She smiled before answering. “Surgery went well – your father will live. He’s got some recovering to do, some physical therapy, but we believe he’ll be back to his old self in no time. The doctor will be out soon to explain in more detail, but with everything Mr. Stark has done for the hospital over the last decade…we figured you guys have been waiting long enough.” Emerson was crying listening to the woman.
“Come on Joey, you can do it,” Bucky repeated as she again toddled a little forward on her two wobbly legs.
Hadn’t noticed she had rested her head on May’s shoulder as the woman continued playing with her hair. When she did, she briefly froze in place. May simply shifted to kiss the teen’s head, not stopping petting her hair.
His love always read with enthusiasm, voice changing for each character. His face would scrunch up adorably when he read a dramatic part, or stretch out to emphasize an excited character. Really it was more fun to just watch Steve’s face while he read, rather than the occasional picture he’d show to Peter to help legitimize the story.
“Oh yeah,” she said with a laugh, “two peas in a pod, partners in crime and all of that.” Peter stirred a little as they waited for the food to arrive, the two focusing on him in silence before Joey spoke in a hushed tone.
“Tony,” he began, waiting for the brunette to finally make eye contact before continuing. “Why didn’t you tell me about him? Especially if you’re not surprised he ambushed me at work?” Tony winced at that, face obviously pained at the questions. Steve kept his hands on the shorter man’s hips, one hand gripping tighter to remind him that he was waiting for an answer.
Also taking Sam's suggestion, he called ahead of time for a guy named Pat and was pleased to hear they would make sure the family would have their privacy. The man sounded nice over the phone and was happy to suggest his niece for Emerson's look - all of which Steve knew she wanted shorter. And maybe with some color.
!” she hissed quietly, not trying to wake Peter. “No, Dad, you see – I am running on no sleep, after a rough night, with an ass that is still on fire, I am not listening to you
Steve could see Sam literally swallow his frustration before turning to the exit to also follow orders.
“I tried telling him,” Howard said, standing up and walking over to the blondes. “See Harley? It was the very dumb, intoxicated man who is to blame for this, not you.” Steve absorbed those words, trying not to let any anger smother his scent as he guided the pup’s face into his neck to calm him. “Steve the doctor, you weren’t here so they asked me...I...I told them to go ahead with the surgery...even if it meant losing the pup…” There was fear in the older Alpha’s voice that Steve had never heard before.
“–couldn’t if you tried, baby brother,” he interrupted him, adding a playful punch to the blonde’s shoulder.
“Yes, the boy’s been hurt. You don’t have to be a witch to see all of his scars, though it helps. What happened this afternoon?” she asked again as he chuckled at her. Knowing resistance was futile, Bucky took a breath, looking down at his lap before telling her.
Steve’s face softened. He gave her a small smile before turning to his unconscious husband. “I understand, thank you for telling me.” He turned back to her with a bigger smile, “why don’t you go get washed up and you can help me make some banana oatmeal pancakes?” She smiled brightly before exiting, glad she didn’t cause any turmoil.
"-And how this whole life you made for yourself - that was all you baby," her Dad said as he kissed her cheek.
"Actually, I'm going to head down to the lab for a bit," Tony replied. "Congrats again Barnes," the genius sent her father a wave before leaving the others. She noticed Steve had a frown on his face but he smiled when he turned to the others and waved farewell as well, heading off to their bedroom.
parts for a reason,” he said with a smile as he saw the two giggle in response. “It’s okay, I understand you guys were just curious. But go to your parents with questions, okay? Don’t just drop your pants like silly little gooses.” He sat down cross legged to sit comfortably, smiling when they continued laughing at him.
"I don't want to wait anymore," Clint said excitedly. "Come on, let's go get hitched," he added, grabbing his fiance's hand and leading them away.
Steve felt himself go rigid, unsure how to explain to a five year old that two men can love each other in this day in age. Emerson nodded with a smile as he once again screamed out.
They heard the gym door open just as she finished reading the fourth book, the two turning as Clint and Natasha made their way over to them.
“You just explained your side, you disobeyed my direct orders to go to May’s after detention – which! Was that even the truth? Or …”
To be fair, Tony had braided Emerson's hair like every other day the last month; once more before he left on his trip as if he anticipated her quote "betrayal." So Steve didn't feel bad about the surprise, sure he'd still love the looks of their two youngest.
“No no, she’s, she’s really sweet. It’s just something Peter told me earlier this week, about rumors about her abusive past. And tonight at dinner, I noticed more bruises along her arm.” Steve had stopped scrubbing dishes to turn to his husband. “Should we be concerned?”
“Oh gotcha, yeah it’s a fu-messed up system,” she corrected herself in front of the seven year old, even though she heard him frequently say the word. “If you ever wanna talk about it, just ask, okay?” she asked as he nodded, embarrassed. Which prompted the woman to want to put a smile on his face.
talk to me,” Steve pointed out, hugging the man a moment later before releasing him. “Now, do you actually want tea?” he asked, frowning when the other man shook his head no.
“Hey, Steve. Question. Have you seen the Godfather?” Before Steve could answer, Tony spoke “AND SHE’S BACK! I knew we kept her around for a reason. Excellent choice, young one.”
It turns out with a quick handful of cash, your 3 year old can fairly easily win a large toy from the impossible games – an adorably giant Winnie the Pooh. Though the cash wasn’t apparently necessary for the 16 year old and the shooting game. She decided on one of those giant inflatable plastic hammers, immediately handing it to the requesting toddler who then loudly declared he was Thor, the god of thunder.
His poor brother looked so exhausted, still getting over being a single parent and losing the mother of his child. The four week old screeching infant didn't make that any easier, and Steve thought to himself - not for the first time - he would
“You know what,” the exhausted billionaire began, “I don’t know what to think right now. I’m exhausted. This is… this is all too much right now.”
“Is it at least double-spaced?” she asked as she trudged her way up the steps where Steve was waiting for her.
“Alright, that’s enough ya heathens, Happy’s waiting downstairs and if you’re late for school I’m eating your desserts.” Both kids quickly sobered up, offering their sorrys before running off to do as told. Steve eternally grateful they did for once…
“So,” Steve began, “Rhodey said you had something to tell me,” he said gently. Tony scoffed out a laugh, grinning while thinking of that rat-bastard of a best friend.
The three were spread out among the large couch under a mass of blankets. There were used tissues scattering the floor next to empty water bottles, Peter carefully walking around the trash to address the diseased.
“Right, sorry that’s what I meant, girlfriend. You think he needs a girlfriend?” Steve reiterated as he finished up the last of the sandwiches and started cutting some fruit.
“Yes, I also told her the paint is edible but I think you’re the only one excited about that,” Steve said with a smirk as he grabbed Morgan to sit on his lap.
“How come wolves are your favorite, Daci?” Peter suddenly asked beside her, no longer on his father’s shoulders.
"Having a kid does something to you. She makes me want to be a better man, not just for her, but for myself. Do I wish the circumstances were different? Sure. But everyday she surprises me, and it's...I don't know. It's a privilege getting to watch her grow."
," the Alpha growled, with the sheer audacity to try and use his Voice on him. At a bonded Omega. Who has long since been able to ignore any other Alpha's Voice but his mate's.
“I’ve thought about taking classes, but no I wouldn’t go back to art school, I love my job too much,” he said as he turned back to put the finishing touches on his picture.
“Leo,” Wade said quietly, still squatting down as he gently grabbed the boy’s hand. “This is my very sweet husband, Peter.” The arachnid took that opportunity to squat down as well, accepting the hug from his girl as he offered the boy a small wave.
“Congratulations Steve,” Clint said, smiling with pain behind his eyes. Luckily Bucky quickly caught on as he approached his mate.
“Then sure, bring in celebrity playboy turned housewife Tony Stark . For not going to class and getting written up for being tardy. Or, how about
“What? I can’t surprise my husband and his hard working employees with some Mexican food?” Tony asked as Joey tried her best not to stare at the god.
He really thinks his dads would be happy with their gift. He couldn’t help feeling a little giddy that Wade had helped them with it too. The three had wondered into a book store after finishing up the final touches, they still had a few minutes before they had to leave to get ready. Wade followed close behind Peter as he weaved throughout the aisles of books. He shook his head as Wade made yet another attempt to grab his ass, swatting his hands away when he saw a little old man staring at them. Emerson came up to them then, holding a book in her hands.
“Love you too,” she called back, feeling motivated to cook herself some breakfast and consider her options.
"You think that's cool? My Pop over there is Captain America," Emerson said with a nod to the man, who easily returned the smile before turning to smile at the astonished little boy. He was surprised she hadn't told him up until this point, then quickly realized how adorable that would be finding out for the first time...clever girl.
“I can only apologize for him so many times, Dad,” Tony said with a smile, aware his Dad was just teasing him at this point. The smile faded from Howard’s face that made Tony’s disappear as well.
He shook himself from his thoughts as he remembered what they were really here to talk about; the man Tony never even mentioned before yesterday.
That’s what he focused on throughout the game, that and the feeling of Steve’s lips again as the Avengers quickly destroyed whatever school they were playing. Tony watched the players walk off to the locker room as he and his friends made their way to the gym amongst the sea of teens.
She’d spent the last half an hour crying in her bed. The first twenty five or so minutes were feeling sorry for herself – and angry at herself for even getting her hopes up – while the last few were remembering her Dad.
. Tell Steve the truth, pig out on some junk food and take comfort in your wonderful family. Or have Steve fuck you silly, I know that usually calms you down,” she smiled as he laughed at her.
Harley had made him a "World's Best Papa" mug, thanks to his Aunt Tasha who had recently taken on pottery. The Alpha had cried and hugged his older pup until Harley was giggling and trying to break away. Tony watched them fondly as the family of four spent the morning cuddling on their king size bed.
“Well, you guys let me know if you need anything. I have an entire art studio and you guys are welcome to use whatever you need, okay?” Peter stood to guide Emerson with him to the art studio before adding a quick “thanks Pop” over his shoulder.
"Oh! Guess what? Last night! Guess what? Daddy and I built robots in his lab!" Her attention immediately turned to her other father, whose eyes were bulging from their sockets as the color slowly drained from his face. She turned to her brother, both realizing their Dad had broke one of Pop's rules.
He was looking at her with a smile, pulling the covers back invitingly as she crawled over to him and under the blankets. She immediately wrapped her arms around the brunette, beyond grateful for these two dorks as parents. He returned the embrace, giving her a tight squeeze before settling the two back comfortably.
The next morning he wasn’t surprised to be the first to wake; what surprised him was the change in positions by the inhabitants of the bed. Emerson was now perpendicular to the rest, her head resting on Steve’s chest while her legs were sprawled over the other two. One of which, he noted, was another pair of legs? Peter had somehow flipped completely, his head covered by the blankets as his feet sprawled up onto their pillow. He sat up a little to see his husband, smiling when he saw him in the same position as last night, curled up on his side, except he also had Emerson’s feet wrapped in a headlock.
"Got it," Steve said quietly, cheeks blushed pink as he smiled at the love of his life. The two were drawn toward each other like magnets, kissing for several minutes before the brunette eventually pulled back.
It was far more satisfying than her dad said it’d be. He gave her the whole “don’t do it unless absolutely necessary” shtick and even said then it would just hurt.
Steve didn’t register he’d even swung his fist until he saw and heard the thud as the man collapsed to the ground. A frantic and hysterical Susan made her way back into view, throwing the pill bottle at his chest and sat down by her husband – shouting at him to leave.
“Oh, yeah, you’re uh...welcome,” Peter said with a weird look on his face. Tony scoffed from behind her before he gently ushered her to sit next to Steve as he passed out the snack bowls to the others.
Four year old Emerson was something else. Big, watery green eyes stared back at the men as her adult clothing shifted on her tiny child body. Her long brown hair hung in her beautiful face as she kept blinking back at the men – looking like she was expecting them to hit her any second...or worse.
“DUM-E, come out of timeout for a second,” Tony grumbled, still looking at Steve. The blonde’s eyebrows somehow furrowed even more until a robot with a large claw-arm of some kind rolled over to them, chirping the whole way. Then his brows shot up in amazement.
“What the actual fuck is wrong with you?!” he shouted at the startled teen. She still looked furious back at him, sitting on the couch in surprise while he tried his best not to loom over her.
"Here, give Peter to Nanny so you guys can eat," George said to Steve, who reluctantly handed the baby over so he could more easily get out of the pool.
“Okay Steeb,” he said, rubbing his eyes adorably and laying his head on his dad’s shoulder. He looked up at Tony, who had a shocked and genuinely offended expression on his face.
“Don’t listen to your brother, why don’t you just come have fun? I’ll even be DD so you won’t have to worry about any of us getting home safe,” Clint offered, acting responsibly for once and making Steve rethink his plans for the evening. “I’ll buy your drinks too,” the other blonde threw in, making Steve cave immediately.
“Tony. Why did you suggest that I should cheat on you? No jokes this time,” he said as he kept his husband’s gaze. The brunette threw his best puppy eyes, but Steve didn’t budge.
She and her Pops shared a smile before making their way to the living room, but not before she gave the man a quick side hug in thanks.
“You love someone in spite of their faults…and I have a lot of them…including drinking. Which is why I haven’t done it in front of you since the first night we met…” Steve hadn’t realized that, frown deepening as he took in Tony’s words.
“I did,” Steve responded with a knowing smile. Peter looked up at his father, realization kicking in. Why Steve had been the one to talk to Peter about Wade.
“We’ll be back guys,” Wade called to the three as he released the man’s hand in favor of copping a feel once they weren’t in eye sight.
Which, he reasoned that any high school would treat him this way, but at least in this school the people were slightly more interesting.
“I’ve already forgiven you for Jarvis, squirt,” the genius said ruffling her hair. He took a moment to share a glance with his husband before continuing.
“Yes, but you’re not freaking out at the prospect of being responsible for not one but TWO kids? Your life is about to change drastically to being a full time parent with two pups. And me!” Tony hadn’t meant to say that last part out loud, but his brain become kind of stupid when he was pregnant.
“Daddy! I got your favorite, mint chocolate chip!” Harley cried out, face covered in chocolate as his godfather trailed behind.
“Go have fun, we’ll meet back here in an hour,” Tony said encouragingly, releasing his pup’s grip with all the strength he could muster. “
“Do you think you could...make me one of your baths?” she asked in a small voice, but feeling brave and confident after how she did today. And the affirmations from the adults that immediately followed only made her feel even better about her decision.
“Shit,” Tony said in sympathy, “are you going to tell Joey that you know?” Steve absently rubbed his thumb over his husband’s cheek before responding.
,” she said nonchalantly as Steve’s entire body froze, swearing he could feel his heart drop to his feet.
“Too late Steve, pretty sure she’s officially a Stark now,” he said as he swayed her back and forth in his arms. And damn, if Steve couldn’t help smiling at that.
“You should…” she began, holding back a hiccup. “…you should probably go back to him,” she said as she pulled herself away from the blonde.
"Tony?" Came a familiar voice through the wind, rain and thunder. It was actually kind of amazing that Carol could be heard at all.
Thor rushed to his friend’s lab. Pausing only once he was inside the lab, he spotted Tony seated on the floor.
"Remember, Thor is on his way to help, too," Bruce said. He sighed, his shoulders slumping a little. "And if anything goes wrong with that antidote you just drank, I need you right here so that I can fix it."
Even with the word ‘dating’ confirming it for sure, Tony couldn’t argue with that kind of blunt honesty. Sighing, he took a seat beside the fire again and looked at the loudly bubbling coffee pot.
“No, no! We should make it WAY worse. Bring in the lightning! Pssh pssh! Zzzt zzzt!” Wade said, jabbing at Matt as he made sound effects. Surprisingly, he caught the redhead off guard and made Matt flinch.
"No, but the world isn't ending--currently--so we're gonna relax and let all of the other heroes take care of the petty criminals for a few days. Just a few days, Cap, c'mon," Tony pleaded, glancing at him a few times. "You've barely stopped fighting long enough to see this timeline since you woke up in it! And it's not like we're going to outer space--again--or anything, so if some world-ending emergency comes up, Jarvis will tell me."
"Who would capture them?" Thor hurried after him. "It is Captain America, so perhaps...the Crimson Head?"
He wrapped his arms around himself and shrugged his shoulders a little. “You can talk to Hulk directly about the tent thing if you still think it was malicious, but I’ll warn you right now, he probably won’t take that talk as well as I did. Peter doesn’t think I have anything against him or his friends, does he?” He looked truly bothered about that possibility.
"I doubt it. When you go missing, they tell the President—when I go missing, they roll over and go back to sleep." He paused next to Bruce, also checking the shop's hours. "Hey."
Puffing out a sigh, Steve sat down heavily just outside of the kayak and propped himself up against the rocks. It was good that the sandy spit had a hill, or the waves would be crashing over their heads right about now.
Pepper's eyes widened a little as she undoubtedly jumped to some conclusions about Doctor Doom's preferences. Apparently they were pretty specific, because whatever had happened to Clint clearly hadn't happened to Cap.
Up ahead, he heard Bruce tell Clint, “The trail splits here. Are we planning to camp in the woods or on the lake?”
Johnny spun and did a dive through the hole, zooming down to the front door. He dropped Spider-Man on his feet and landed.
"I've been too busy trying to keep them from killing each other," Bruce replied tiredly, finishing with dressing Loki's wound. He patted the blond's hand and stood, turning to get a better look at Steve. "How are you? Have your symptoms gotten any worse?"
"Oof! Whadabouthotdogs?" Peter replied, muffled by the man's shoulder. He patted Wade's back gingerly, hoping that would be sufficient reciprocation so that the hug could end.
"Cap, if this's about--" Sighting Daredevil, Peter blinked and stopped in his tracks. "Oh, wow. In the rain you look just like a gargoyle."
He glanced at the blond sidelong, and Loki noted that his eyes were still soft and brown, not green. And...did he have a sprinkle of little freckles on his face? The Jotun had never actually looked at him this closely before—he was usually the Hulk at that point.
“Now that you mention it, when I’m in my armor and Thor uses his lightning…” There was a ‘scientific curiosity’ kind of glint in his eye that Peter was a little worried about.
"What happened?" He tried to get up, but quickly decided against it. Turning to glance at Clint, he raised an eyebrow suspiciously. "D-did you have anything t-to do with this?"
Glancing at Bruce, he couldn’t help thinking about how it might be with him. Hey, they had both never been with a guy and they were alone, Bruce was kinda cute and scruffy…and holy shit, what the hell was he thinking?
Tony coughed and sank down onto his side on the table to curl up. Ugh, what a miserable day. Okay, he admitted it, hooking up to power the whole mansion off of his heart had been stupid—Cap was cured now, though, and that wouldn't have happened otherwise. Hopefully Cap came back sometime soon.
"Just wanted to apologize. You know, for getting drunk last night and making you have to deal with me. And now I guess for shooting down your plan I didn't know I shot down."
"...I guess the world hasn't changed as much as I thought. But next time, you might try an omelet. He seems to like those." It was a really strange comment, but Cap didn't add to it. "I don't suppose you're wearing a hair pin?"
"Ah...I don't really remember much about last night," Bruce admitted, smiling uneasily. He glanced up at the bed and then began to get to his feet. "Why would they think that?"
"The cell is regretfully not equipped to dispense take-out," Jarvis replied, sounding bored. Could he get bored?
Tony glanced at him, sighing and giving up charging off down the beach. He wasn't coordinated enough to right now, anyway.
"Oh, good..." Tony turned and slapped a tracking bracelet on Clint's wrist while he was distracted. It was metal, like a shackle cuff, with a big blinking red light on it.
“So, um, we’re pretty sure the tree through our tent was something Dr. Banner did. Or, you know, the Hulk,” he began awkwardly. “I-I don’t think he did it on purpose, but it still feels kinda personal. Do you think Wade or I did anything to make him angry?” Hey, so far everything he’d said was true. Ridiculous, but true. Not that Peter thought Bruce had anything against them. If anything, he probably just felt bad for accidentally shooting Wade in the lung with an arrow. Awkward first meeting…
