“Huh,--right. Basically, what I’ve been trying to do. Get Steve out of bed cleaned up and looking like America’s Golden Boy and not a hobo. I need you to help me—”
Steve wears a simple baseball cap and glasses. His beard is what really hides him. Tony is dressed down from his usual suits in pair of ripped jeans and a Star Trek t-shirt. Though, he still looks like money because those jeans are designer and his sunglasses are definitely not clearance aisle.
The elevator dings. They enter to a mess of haphazardly arranged furniture and glass shards. Bruce hikes Peter on his hip so he will not step on anything.
Fandral enjoyed women, no secret. Sif had seen him in many an affair and triangle. But the man was uneasy with children. As was her; although Sif hid it better than Fandral.
“Mighty Thor!” Volstagg came barreling in, a small child sobbing in his arms with guards trying to stop him.
Tony and Steve are laid up on the couch, a fuzzy blanket covering them. Steve’s hair is disheveled and there’s drool on his face. Tony is cocooned in Steve’s mass and snores quietly. The TV screen is paused on what looks like Bill Nye screaming. Bruce just nods at the scene and glances at the little boy, in Hulk jammies no less, returning to the TV. The screen comes back and the volume is low so the two on the couch are still sound asleep.
Steve’s eyes widen and Tony pushes forward to mock argue with Rhodes about the benefits of having a son modeled after Tony.
Fury pulled out a small package and smiled charmingly. Peter made a noise and hid his face in Steve’s neck.
Bucky swallows the lump in his throat. Memories of a night weeks’ past returns. He makes a fist and swallows that too.
“—before he moved in with his aunt and uncle. However, you both have heard him speak. I believe the serum may have been a factor in his vocal development, but without tests I cannot confirm. I have seen the boy’s experiences and peaked into his future. Peter will speak when he is ready and his powers will only grow in strength—”
“Peter, you need to understand that not everyone who knows your pops and me is good. Especially the ones who sneak into houses in the dead of night,” his dad said firmly.
Steve is about to leave for his seventeenth visit to Anthony when he is grabbed. There is knife to his back.
The mansion is quieter. Bruce notes this as he enters. There’s no one to greet him in the foyer and he cannot sense any eyes on him. That is good for what he’s about to do, but odd for the atmosphere.
His dad sighed and went to sit on the bed with him. “Because he hurt this family. Before we got you and he’s not such a nice guy.”
“I have damage to repair with him too.” Steve opens his eyes. “I love you. I love you Tony. No one comes close. Please, believe that.”
Anthony rolls his wet eyes. He lifts his hands and suddenly the branches grab on to Steve's waist. Steve inhales sharply as the tree drags him like a doll. Steve lands on the wide branch Anthony is on.
“Why is that? Is it not fortuitous for a family lineage in this world? Surely, the man Fury and Agent Coulson would find it a joyous occasion for their best to have an heir one day,” Thor said, confused.
“Peggy’s great niece. Her name’s Sharon and she’s a real sweetheart. She works with SHIELD. The real one, not HYDRA, and I trust her. Oh, shit!”
Thor’s eyes widened. He had heard of his friends’ trouble in getting a child. He looked at the boy and was gladdened that they found one.
“Yes, but not like this. Not charging back to them; Sam’s been talking to the doctor. They got Tony out of his stupor and Peter’s doing better. They’re both coming down soon.”
“Pretty much. The arachnid DNA was less volatile, but still had its impact,” Bruce says, remembering Peter crawling on the wall. “Parker got the notes and the partial serum, added the spider bits, and had to inject it in small doses, probably less than 0.01ml of serum. I could be wrong, but Peter would need to have an injection-or injections-twice a week for years to ensure he would live.”
“Hang on, kid,” Sam said. He flew up, Peter strapped to his chest, and headed south to D.C. He and Natasha could feel the tension between Steve and Tony. They were going to have “the talk” again, which, if Sam was being honest, was good. Peter should be in school with other kids, not cooped up with a bunch of adults. But….what happened in June had the effect of psyching Tony way out. The man barely slept and the sudden move to the old mansion had really messed up the team’s dynamics. Poor Banner was left alone at the tower since Barton and Natasha decided to move in with the family. Sam got that they were trying to keep the two leaders from locking up the place, but Banner didn’t really get out much. Hell, Sam hardly knew the man. Colonel Rhodes was the same. So, that left Barton to visit the doctor. Natasha stayed at the mansion when she was in town, but like him, she had places to be.
“Be that as it may, there is no denying Peter’s experienced trauma in the past. He has abandonment issues and can, in extreme measures, become mute. Along with his arachnid abilities which give him heightened senses and his intellect at such an age could lead him to having less…savory coping mechanisms in later years.”
here?” Tony asks. He ignores the information because it cannot be true. Then again, a quick sweep of the room-bottles, bottles, and tissues-has Tony shift in his spot on the unkempt bed.
“Sweet. You know Tony, Pepper and I still haven’t gotten your RSVP,” Happy said, making sure Peter was settled in the Benz with Pooh-JARVIS.
"And, this big oaf fell in love with me. As I did." Loki leaned closer to Steve. "I was a runt. Embarrassment of my father and brothers. Left for dead if not for the care of Bestla, my old nan."
By now, he’s heard everything and “borrowed” the contents of the suit case. He also “borrowed” Pepper’s laptop and read the email. Through all this, the only person to notice him was that kid.
Loki must be under a delusion. He is many adjectives; “nice” is the furthest and “damn” begins each one.
Tony purses his lips and Steve closes his for a moment. He tells what he knows and leaves out the parts Tony has to fill.
Tony hands the gift to Peter. He opens it, excited, and it is a picture frame of the three of them on the couch at the Tower.
“You didn’t build yourself a kid, didja Tony?” He asks in jest. Rhodes bends down to Peter’s level and smiles wide. “Because I tell ya, no one’s giving such a polite kid to you.”
“Hey, JARVIS. I came to check on Peter,” Bruce says. He looks around. By now, Clint or Natasha should be spooking him. Usually Clint. Again, fortunate that this might work.
“I can’t put you ahead of my family. No,” Steve said. “Bucky this almost broke it last time. I can’t ask that of Tony and we have Peter now.”
“Wonderful,” Bruce exclaims. “How do I keep this? I can’t lie.” He gestures to his FitBit, which is staying a steady beat so far. “And Barton keeps bugging me. The man literally comes out of the vent just to see me.”
Loki awaits for the end of the festivities. His brother, the oaf, saunters around with Lady Jane on his arm. Loki sniffs in his disguise. To the eye, he is another business woman, showing her support for the CEO getting married. To another eye, he is an old board member not sure where he is. Both guise keep him in the dark of the Avengers and onlookers. Loki walks toward his target. The young Peter stands on the chair as Stark points out who they know and who is just here for booze.
Steve drops his shirt. Bucky finds himself in an embrace. Shock dissipates as he places his arm around Steve.
“Take Peter out for dinner to anywhere. And, if you can,” Steve digs out his wallet and throws it at Sam. “Do anything else you can think of. Get a hotel if you want and we’ll pick up Peter later.”
The kitchen was in its chaos for the conference and the boy hid too well. The cooks halted in respect of Sif and bowed, but she was busy looking for the boy.
The archer had gotten into a heavy explosion with sonic waves, which messed with his ears, but did not damage them beyond repair. He could hear with the aids and had taken up sign language with Peter, even though the boy still used the paper and pen ones.
Thor would have loved to investigate, but he instead sent Fandral and Lady Sif to do so; Hogun had diplomats to settle.
Steve thanks the doctor again; he grabs Tony’s hand and they find Peter with Wong, who is holding a bag.
“I’m not an angel, Tony. I’m not America’s Golden Boy. Never was. That title was given to me and the legend of Captain America. I’m Steve Rogers. I grew up in the slums of Brooklyn and had no father. You know me. You know me better than most.” Steve shifts Tony’s still body in his lap. “Despite everything else, I am a man willing to protect his own. At any cost.”
“He’s not dead,” Bruce says. “Tired. Won’t sleep unless I slip him something and barely eats. The new A.I., FRIDAY, is doing okay. She’s almost as punctual as you and….”
Peter likes thin crust with extra sauce, onions, mushrooms, peperoni, and Italian sausage. Bucky grins and when the delivery boy arrives he holds out the large pizza and a bottle of coke. All Bucky has is vodka and water, so the coke will do for Peter. They eat in silence. Peter takes two pieces and mushes together. He eats it like a sandwich.
“Yes. I know it’s against protocol and probably the law, but I just needed to tell those people what a mistake they were making.” He stops. “I tried to tell the Captain that it wouldn’t work overseas. Sir, I have never hated myself more than that moment.”
The words from the preacher fade in Peter’s mind as he looks at the faces gathered. The Terrace Room is huge, but Peter still spots it-or him. A man in shadows at the back. He wears a tuxedo and a white scarf. His expression is blank and his eyes are looking at Thor, who sits with the other Avengers and Mr. Coulson.
Loki does not fight. He stands and lets the manacles shackle his wrists. The Hulk roars at him, but he does nothing. Thor leads him out. The affair is quiet. Loki glances at Peter, embraced in his fathers’ arms. He thinks about what Peter told him and closes his eyes; it cannot be true.
“This shit goes south, I’m taking Peter to Steve. Don’t tell anyone, but Tony’s coping mechanisms are the same as Howard’s and I don’t want to see a repeat with Peter. Steve’s would be better at this single dad thing,” he says.
Peter is quiet throughout the meeting with the Dean Martin, which makes daddy chuckle, and listens as he is given the rundown of the school. He follows his daddy and the dean to Mr. Franz’s classroom in 305. Peter is introduced alone because daddy does not want the kids to see him. Here he is Peter Parker only because Daddy said the Stark name  is dangerous like James Bond.
Daddy stares. “Excuse me, that’s wrong. She’s teaching in room 301. That’s the same as Harry Osborn.”
Volstagg as he goes to market with his brood sees the oddest thing. A child, obviously not of here, stands on the fountain in the city and looks around the crowd. He seems to search for someone, but his face is red and his features hard. Volstagg hums and his youngest son nudges him to continue for the things they need.
Before Peter could ask, the junior counselor, Skip, called for everyone to line and return to their groups. They separated, Peter in Awesome Ions and Gwen in Powerful Polymers. The day went on as the kids worked on small experiments with some disappointing results.
“I see they do not teach the proper greetings,” muttered Odin. He smiled affectionately anyway as Peter let go and took Jane’s and then Thor’s hand in his tiny ones.
Bruce take three fire breaths. He’s learned the Big Guy can pop out if there’s a threat and to squash it he needs to breathe and not feel threatened. Logically, Rhodes’ anger is at Tony’s A+ parenting on how to handle Peter and whatever the hell happened in D.C.-none of them have the details-and he, like Bruce, is concerned for a friend and the wellbeing of the child. Bruce’s breaths finish.
I forgot to mention that this is a time lapse in this. So, it is about two years later and Peter is eight. Banner has a better relationship with him because of the attempted kidnapping and everything else I hope is clear. Also, I don't do action well and so it is skipped.
Wilson, as stated, remained in the background, mainly the kitchen, and heard small tags of talks from the rooms. Steve would rotate with Barton on keeping him company, but eventually he gave them the permission to go ahead and stay with Peter.
Should he bother getting out of bed today? Sam came by and yelled at him for a good hour the other day; no hang-overs meant he did not suffer a rattling sensation caused by noise, but seeing Sam pity him…Yeah, he’ll get up before Sam arrives.
smart. The kids won’t like that Harry, the popular offspring of Osborn, has a shy friend. They’ll try to break him, Steve.”
Happy cocks his eyebrow and has grin on his face. He had that same look when Pepper said they should be professional.
Loki (Jules) smiles sweetly. “I’m actually here because Ms,er, Mrs. Potts asks me to bring some things we need to sign off on.”
The cute waitress returns and asks, “Can I interests you in dessert?” She looks directly at Bucky. Sam shakes his head at the poor girl’s flirting.
“Your stash, Bucky. You had that habit of sneaking a puff every so often no matter how much it fucked up my asthma,” Steve says.
“I’m leaving you here with him. Have a fucking happily ever after. Mr. Doubtfire,” Tony says. His rocket boots and gloves come back on and meld to him. Tony flies out the hole in the doorway.
"Don't suppose you talk," says the man. "It has been some time since Man came to these parts. The language may have changed. But, I think we can talk in general terms soldier."
“Good. Both Steve and Tony are terrible at communication, which is the back bone of any relationship’s power. There’s a misunderstanding they cannot get passed, mainly Tony, and your other father Steve is unable to voice the real concerns. So, until those are resolved, it is of utmost importance that you, Peter, stay with one of them and visit the other. I have arranged for you to fly down to D.C. for next weekend to see Steve. And you are here to kick Tony into shape. He needs you,” Coulson finishes.
He startles upon a giant willow tree. The trunk of the grand arbor is bigger than his small house. Steve stares around the beautiful wood.
He munched on the saurkraut and egg sandwich until suddenly a girl came up to him. She was Gwen, a new kid this summer.
“Bathe, and then eat. After I will allow a short rest for you, but be reminded we are on a short schedule until I can have a new domain.”
Steve sees his fists are white and he cannot control his rage. But…the serum saved Peter. Saved a baby who did not have a chance; the child who is now Steve’s and Tony’s for good. What can he do?
“You’re getting there. What brings you to the kitchen this early, it’s not lunch yet,” Natasha inquires.
“I am not the director anymore, Coulson. I’m a man with a few good people doing everything to keep the world from burning. James Buchanan Barnes was a good man too before he was messed up. Since his emancipation, there has been no sighting of him beyond harassing a superfamily. I think he’s better off like this.” Fury finishes his cup.
Peter finds Uncle Bruce in the kitchen with Aunt Nat. He sits at the counter with papers littering everywhere while Natasha cuts up an apple.
“I’m sorry, but…we can’t leave Peter alone. Not like this. We’ve been present to all his appointments and this won’t be different.”
Tony scoffs. “That what you and Fury call it. Magnanimity is code for ‘came to see how fucked up you are, Stark,’” he sneers.
Peter stares at the empty seat next to Tony. The man knows what his child wants to ask. He’s grateful Peter’s intuitive and smart enough to stay quiet for the moment. He cannot explain what is happening yet. He needs time to iron out the details and find a lawyer for Steve who can represent him. God knows, the man won’t unless it’s Agent Coulson. Tony is sure Coulson’s qualified to be an attorney. The plane lifts off and soon they’ll be back in Manhattan. Tony will put Peter to bed and read him a story from Aesop’s fables.
“A few years and play dates with Harry. And I think we should let him train with Nat, just basics. Also, no one besides the Avengers can babysit Peter.”
. He guessed the blond brute and slender man had to be Loki and Thor because of the height both had. And that mountain, he'd only seen carvings of it, but it was in the Nordic lands where it appeared those two hailed from by their clothes and tales of frost giants. The visit was quiet and it left Steve uneasy. What could Loki and Thor have to tell?
“Yeah, like it was good for me surrounded by idiots from grades 0 to 12 who just wanted a piece of the Stark name. And let’s remember the wonderful years of your school life bullied when Barnes wasn’t there,” Tony sneered.
“Peter!” Pops pats his back as the piece of meat and bread slides down hard. Peter sips his juice. “You know better than to take big bites like that.” Pops face scrunches up, as if a bad smell came around.
“I will, daddy,” Peter says. Peter squeezes his dad’s hand. Pops has not come back home from his mission in D.C. and it makes dad sad. Peter looks up at his daddy. His sun glasses are blue today, but it makes Peter think of how red his eyes are under them. Daddy’s spending a lot of time in his workshop. He stopped letting Peter in. Peter feels a squeeze from daddy.
“I’m CEO of a Fortune 500 company and I live in a Central Park penthouse with Sarah Jessica Parker as my neighbor, and I’m still his assistant,” Pepper mutters. She looks down at her key card, the only one which opens all the floors and entrusted to her and few others. “I wouldn’t have it any other way.”
“I want you to choose me. I want you to leave Tony and I’ve given you the perfect out. I like Peter.” Bucky inhales the last drags of the cigarette. “I’ve been in love with you since we were kids.”
“Yep, you two go discuss,” he said, hoping Coulson was still stunned in the corner and Fury did not notice the veins in his neck.
By the tenth visit, Anthony has stopped asking about travelers. Well, frankly, he seemed less enthusiastic about them since visit number five and by visit seven did not mention travelers until Steve had to leave.
“My lady, I have never…” he trailed off when Jane gave him an upturned brow. “The House of Waffles was justified. Darcy said so that her Book of Faces and Mine Space thought it “vigilante” of me to bring that rude wrench down.”
“What else can I do,” he says. “I’ve wasted time. I’ve wasted every time I had to…swallow my fucking pride and….I miss them. I miss them. I have to fix this, somehow. Don’t you get that, Bucky?”
“Stop there. I get I’m not father of the year. Not even in the running, but I know what’s really at stake here. Agent made some….revelations I’m ashamed I did not find out before. First things first, eat, and then figure out what to do. It goes without saying Peter won’t be returning to school,” Tony says.
"Uh," Steve swallows. "Pastries. I thought you might like them. I've never seen you eat and these are vitriols you cannot have in the woods." Steve opens the top and holds up the basket.
“Peter! You frightened us,” Steve says. “Spider monkey, you’re not supposed to climb on that chair.”
In the end, it was Natasha with Fury who tracked suspicious purchases of one Tomi Hiddleson that a gruff old ally warned him about. Tony found the name and they sent Barton and Natasha to scout every place in New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. Steve and Sam took Maryland and Washington D.C. because each only had one location.
“I will help him. If for nothing then that he was my friend once and that he’s been stripped of everything. Tony,” Steve said, exhausted. “I can’t abandon him.”
The day of the party arrives and Steve is standing tall. Tony can see the small tremors going through his husband’s body. They invited Fury and Coulson.
Peter watched as the loud family ate the feast. He had learned that word from Pops. The table was filled to the brim with pork, chicken, beef, and something that looked like a ferret or raccoon. He popped small bits into his mouth and listened to the people. Peter rubbed the drawings he held in his lap. He wondered if he was not in another country. The door was in the Tower so it should not have left New York. He was confused and wanted his dads.
Steve burrowed deeper in the covers, stench of his own unwashed body wafting to him. He did not care. Nor about the scratchy sting of his beard. He sighed to allow his morning hell to begin.
“I care, dammit. You…you were all I had. For a long time, it was just the two of us. Then the war. But, it was still you and me.” Steve let go and offered his hand. “I have Tony and Peter to think about. It’s not just me Bucky. I will help you, but I can’t force Tony to accept you. That comes later. Right now, his happiness is first. You need to leave before I call Tony.”
"That side of the story is for Loki and Thor to tell you. We'll be here for a fortnight. You have time. Go visit the Willow Man."
He snatched it and, rocking Peter, began to hush the five year old. Peter’s sobs changed to sniffles as Tony soothed him. Bruce stood amazed. Yes, he never doubted Tony Stark could raise a kid, but witnessing it firsthand was incredible. The man in front of him could not be the same self-centered but lovable ass. Tony was committed to Peter and him alone in this moment.
Peter rubs his eyes and nods at what he says. He looks around the small cabin and sees the open bathing chamber door. He walks to it, halts, and looks at Loki.
"Thanks, but I'm good. I mean I got a banana and graham crackers. My dad always gets me some McDonald's after camp."
“Of course, we are leaving in five” he informed the red clad man who smiled. He probably hoped to make himself known so he had a higher chance for a promotion. Nothing bad about it, that’s how you get promotions but today was a bad day for it.
“Don’t worry, I fix that soon” the AIM scientist promised and let go of Tony. The mechanic had kept totally still but Steve Clint and Jennet had started to struggle against their bonds as soon as Killian had laid a hand on him.
A few second passed until Peter took a deep brith and hit the emergency stop button of the elevator.
„Ok, first o f all chemistry is awesome and second I am not gay, even thought it wouldn‘t matter. No, what I want to tell you is something different. And I might get into trouble because of it so do you swear to never tell anyone?“ Peter wanted to know.
„Thats not Captain Rogers!“ he yelled while tackling the man from behind. They rolled over the floor while Mr. Stark yelled and when Peter managed to stand up again he looked in his own face.
„Jarvis, can you give me Bruce‘s location?“ Tony asked the AI which answered prompt: „Dr. Banner is currently in his lab.“
“I’d love to, as soon as I know the crew is safe” Steve whispered back. Tony nodded and closed his eyes again.
“Stark, no need to locate Ultron, he is on his sway to the oxygen tanks” he yelled, adrenalin pumping through his system.
Tony closed his eyes and braced himself for the pain but it must be much worse than he had imagined for his eyes ripped open and his body tensed as soon as the orange liquid came in contact with his body.
So Tony would go down on the planet and of course Steve himself would go too. Then he just needed someone Tony trusted. Rhodes would be the best choice, but he preferred his best pilot on the ship just in case they needed to leave in a hurry. Pepper also wouldn’t be a wise choice; she wasn’t on for field operations but both Clint and Natasha were close to Tony. Bruce and Janet were also really good friends of his and Tony could talk about science with them.
“What the hack did just happen?” Sam asked when the emergency lights turned one and dimed the bridge with scary blue light.
“Tony, I know you are in there. Please let me in. I brought you a sandwich” Steve said loud enough to be heard on the other site but still no answer. Steve sighted, he didn’t want to do this but he needed to take care of Tony.
“I would prefer to be alone for a bit” he finally answered and left, leaving Steve in the suddenly sold mechanic room. Why did it felt like Tony was leaving him for good?
“If he just wants to excuse himself than I don’t want to hear it” Steve said and tried to leave but Clint griped his arm.
„You kids did enough. You saved us now let us do the rest“ Mr. Stark shook his head and looked at the Captain.
“Ok, but don’t forget to eat and sleep! Peter, Harley, I make it your job to make sure the Commander still functions like a human being” he ordered and the two boys nodded proud. Tony laughed and stood up to whisper something in Steve’s ear.
„Groot, what are you doing there! You aren‘t supposed to touch the computers!“ Harley yelled and run towards the living tree to see if he changed some important settings.
The red light of the alarm system was getting on Steve’s nerves. He was well aware of the attack on his ship, the quakes that shook the bridge and the enemy he could see through the front window kind of gave it away. The Avenger was not meant to withhold such an attack. It was a research ship, most of his crew members scientists.
„No, I am pretty sure your system works fine. So either they have only replaced 25 of us, who are now hold captive on our ship and there are only 25 enemies on the ship, which is unlikely seeing what fake Groot said, or they replaced much more which are held on the other ship“ Peter concluded.
Minutes passed and the screaming stopped but Fassamau was still merciless conscious and obviously in pain.
„That‘s not Peter“ Harley mumbled barley audible and Peter flashed Mr. Stark a sickening smile. The man begun to curse: „If you hurt one of the boys I‘ll make sure you wished you were never born“, he yelled and Peter believed him, that man could be scary.
„Have fun. See you“ Peter said when they reached one of the elevators that Ned and MJ were going to take to their families quarters. Peter one the other hand took an elevator to the mechanic deck that needed a special permission, that he, to his full pride, possessed.
“Nearly where?” Natasha wanted to know. Here entire posture screamed run or fight. Growing up on a harsh planed that put survival of the fittest to a new level like she did made someone more paranoid.
“Harley, chump. We talked about this. I am always glad to have your help but in situation like this you stay with your mom and make sure everyone wears their seat belts” Tony lectured the boy and Steve had a soft smile on his face. Tony had taken Harley and Peter under his wings not so long ago and was now telling everyone how brilliant the boys were.
“So you knowingly threaten everyone on this ship for the sack of science? Because you wanted to play god?” he snarled. Tony’s eyes widened in fear but no one stepped in except Hank.
“Barton, why are you on the bridge and when did you enter?” Steve wanted to know. He was quiet annoyed by the marksman. He was only on the ship to keep the back of the others safe, just in case, and as much as Steve usually enjoyed the company of the man it bothered him how easy he slipped on the bridge.
“Who is on the other site? Tony, what are you talking about?” Janet asked and kneeled down to where Steve had sat Tony on the floor when he wiggled too much to keep him from harming himself or Steve.
Out of nowhere a loud sound was audible and when Ultron fall this time he didn’t get up again. From the other end of the room Rocket started to cheer.
“He plans to kill us all. It’s the fastest method without harming himself. It is what I would do” he whispered the last thing and Steve swallowed hard. Clint was right; he had crashed Tony’s barley existing self-esteem. Still he turned to the archer.
"But at least we know who we're dealing with," Tony replied, coughing again. "Then we’ll have to wait now."
"Oh, good that you ask, Stark," Burkwill explained, gesturing to Tony to get up. Slowly he straightened up and found that he was actually smaller without his suit than the man next to him. "You never told anyone your secret plans from the lab, yes, I know that," he said, playing sadly. He came back uncomfortably close to Tony, but the mechanic did not back down. He could feel the breath on his face, but his eyes looked straight into the cold, blues of Burkwill. The three fingers of his remaining hand slowly stroked Tony's beard and his teeth crunched. Still, he did not move an inch.
My holidays are nearly over, so I'm back with a new chapter. Since this is so short I'll update another one tomorrow or Sunday. I hope you enjoy! Thanks for the kudos!
Tony rolled his eyes inwardly and felt his cold lips start to tremble with rage. Nevertheless, he looked at Burkwill and repeated: "Will you release the prisoners now?"
Steve had first landed on the ship with Bucky. When he finally felt the ground under his feet again, he was glad, but this joy didn’t last long: When he arrived, these huge beings had been distributed all over the ship.
"Watch out. I'm not saying that because I want to persuade you to stay, but because I want you not to go alone, Tony. Yeah, we have a problem, a damn big, to be honest," he said, calmer this time, and kept walking toward Tony. He put his hand on the other's shoulder. "But we will
"Has been in the process of finding out what was nearby that clearing since the conversation. Where the things could come from and where they could have gone. Except for Toms River, of course."
But Clint shook his head. "Not necessarily. Devices can also have failed. Or employees. Or the ship never flew past New York. I just remember the Chitauri that came out of a wormhole."
The open third-floor apartment door blew artificial light into the corridor and Tony hurried to get past the last steps. His ribs pounded and pulled, and he wished he had a few more pills with him.
He also talked to Rhodey, Natasha or Vision, but about trivial things so they could think he was fine. He had put Rhodey in enough difficult situations, he did not want to complicate matters further with his problems. Natasha had already had enough problems to return to the United States and Tony did not believe that the way they had irritated each other, at least for the first few days, was a sign that she could be treated with the burden of his own problems. Often, she went away from the headquarter, to do whatever it was she was doing. But when she was there, she always seriously tried to help Tony, but he did not want to pull her to his side, where it had worked so little last time.
Actually, I just realised that there is only one more chapter after his and an epilogue. So, we are pretty much on the end of the story. Yeah.
I wish you a nice day and to all Americans out there: I'll wish you a nice day after you've been voting.
"I know you can’t forgive me, that wouldn't be right, but I wanted to tell you that I didn’t want it to go down the way it did." Still, Tony just stared at him, apparently making Steve feel uncomfortable.
"At least not what I've achieved. Sit down, please." Tony coughed as his chest tightened and er scratched his neck. He reached out to his chest with his hand, where the Arc reactor used to be. Steve stared at him again in horror and raised his hand to pat him on the back, but Tony shook his head coughing.
For a few minutes, he just sat there, staring at his bare toes over the white carpet and listening to his somehow slowing breathing. Then he looked at the clock. 3:47 am, it indicated.
"If I'd been told that one day, I’d take Tony Stark's shoes off, maybe I'd have considered that with my career." Tony felt his friend take off his shoes nevertheless and let out a relieved breath. It was so pleasant.
The battlefield looked awful. Everywhere laid dead creatures, and now dead or injured soldiers, too, who had intervened in the fight. Debris from the flying ship laid everywhere.
"Too many for us to know anything specific," Fury replied, continuing to speak. "But we were able to exclude the two ports in Florida because of the vegetation. Flights were in every area of the US at the time, but the proximity of the water says the aircraft was probably going down or up in Boston or New York. We also could not rule out Washington, Norfolk, Baltimore, Portland and some smaller airports," he continued.
"They're also building wells in Africa, spotting fields or piling up schools in India, all with donations or money from their own pockets," Clint continued. "Burkwill has been behind the wheel of the organization for about twenty-three years and has really made it big. It’s always discussed if he had entered because of his children and his wife he lost."
Tony was silent. The image of the wormhole spread again. The air that was getting less and less, the feeling when he knew the Arc-Reactor had failed and the huge explosion, like a supernova that he'd never seen before, even though he knew one thing or two about weapons.
Oh, I will also ignore everything after Civil War, so no Spiderman-action here, nothing with Wakanda and stuff.
"Burkwill is said to have an extremely high IQ. He started playing the piano at the age of three and Cello at the age of five. When he was eight he read books that are required in college and could quote from the Bible, the Koran and the Torah. He grew up with his father in London, in Tehran and New York, sometimes they also lived in Sau Paulo or St. Petersburg. As a result, he spoke Farsi, Hebrew, Portuguese, Russian and English fluently, learned French, German and Italian at school and is now also able to speak Mandarin and Armenian as well."
"Are we here to talk about my relationship with Rogers?" Tony snapped back. "We really have better things to do."
"I'm sorry, Tony. Please say something. Please," he finally said, trying to catch a breath in the end. There was a long pause in the room, before Tony moved briefly with a face distorted with pain.
"Unfortunately I do not know it. I've lost contact with both," admitted Friday. "Both left at night to find my boss. I have been expressly ordered by Rhodes not to tell you that they went off. And the security settings of my boss mean that I have to follow instructions from him. He didn’t talk about answers," Friday added, sounding almost relieved to finally be able to tell.
"Mostly five to ten people have the same job. But the ship's latest research says it had a pronounced camouflage mechanism. Maybe the technology wasn’t good enough to spot the ship."
"Bring him up for questioning and then quickly back when everything is clean," Fury said, addressing two agents who immediately took Barnes with them. The man struggled briefly as the two agents grabbed him by the elbow, then let it pass over him.
Rhodey raced through the air at the creature. But as he was about to fire his weapons, the monster slowly raised his hand. Rhodey aimed and shot with various weapons.
. The leaders multiply in large numbers, and if you win one for yourself, the others will, too. As long as the other
"Friendship? He spent three months in fucking where-ever and suddenly came back and said that everything was alright again. And in tow, he has a- "
Tony felt his mouth open. He knew exactly which friend the man meant. The video showed the street where his parents had died. He felt Steve reach for his arm and hold him gently. He did not resist. Barnes sat petrified in the chair, then slowly turned to Tony. He shook his head. He did not want to watch the video again, and he saw that Barnes thought similarly.
Steve nodded. He knew he shouldn’t be so distracted by Tony. That wouldn’t do any good, but he still felt that the mechanic's situation was entirely down to his decisions.
"Mrs. Potts has the authority to turn Stark Industries' production back to weapons as well as re-seek trading partners and renew businesses. If you're with me, Stark, I'll let her go, if you make the announcements first. Mrs. Potts will then work closely with us, after all, she knows what will happen if she does not."
Steve, who said that he had known and suddenly rammed a shield into his chest, almost into his head.
Hey! I didn’t know if “The Person” is still “he” or “it” if I don't want to spoil the gender yet, so I needed to write it this way. I didn’t find out about this on the internet, neither. So, yeah, sorry for that. Maybe somebody can enlighten me?
Tony remembered the moment when he thought that both the Winter Soldier and Steve had heard the sound of his breaking heart. The worst was not the video, his parents were dead anyway. The worst thing was not even that he now knew they could have survived the accident if Barnes had not been there. The worst part was that Steve knew about it, all the time, not even trying to explain himself. The worst part was when he looked Steve in the eye and knew exactly what they were telling him:
"See, don’t blame me”, Tony said. “But to get to the important topics: What do you know about these Aliens?"
Her eyes had become glassy at the memory. Tony had straightened up and Steve and Natasha could not take their eyes off the woman anymore.
Tony nodded and felt Steve breathing exhaustedly behind him. With him, there was an extra procedure because he was considered the leader and has given help at the outbreak. The International Court of Justice had been worried about him for days and came to no conclusion.
Burkwill grinned as he slid his hand down again and reached into his pocket. His stomach touched Tony's as he moved slightly. The younger man tried to hide the shivering from the cold. He could feel exactly the eyes of the others on him as Burkwill pulled a pocket knife from his pants and opened it. Slowly he put it between the neck and shoulder of Tony but did not press yet. Almost as if he did not want to hurt him. He grinned and then shrugged, then squeezed the spikes in Tony's skin and removed the knife. It was red, but Tony did not flinch a bit.
He shouted to his people. Slowly, he walked to Tony. "General Astif, water please," he said to the man who had just gotten up from Pepper. Immediately, the man ran to fulfil the task. Almost caring, Burkwill tapped Tony on the back with his remaining fingers. He flinched for a moment as the man struck the spot where he just got kicked, but then he tried to calm down again. If the others were going to turn up, it had to happen now, he knew that, because if those crazy people could really see what he was doing, then they'd certainly watched the drop of the GPS transmitter from earlier. General Astif came running with water that Tony drank thirstily. "Dragenbach and Lang need some, too," Tony squeezed out, drinking about half of the bottle. He desperately tried to win time. It had been a mistake to drop the transmitter, he knew that now. He was too far away from Pepper and the other two to protect her in any way, and at any moment Burkwill would find out what he had done. And then the other three were dead.
Annoyed, Tony accepted the opinion of his friend. He thought it was terrible when others made decisions and he couldn’t interfere. And when other people also announced those decisions he liked it even less. He also wanted to show people that he was fine. He wanted to be seen, and not just be the bit of misery that was talked about.
"We're going to lose all our lives!" Bucky pronounced his thoughts, waving his arms wildly. “And the civilians down there, too!”
"He'll wake up again," he finally tried to reassure Steve. "I have to clarify a few things with him. And besides, he has not watched all of the Star Wars movies yet. So ... he can’t go. "
Then Steve turned around. Tony had already seen his blond hair from the elevator. He had his lips pressed together and stared at Tony. It was a mixture of determination, grief, and self-assurance. And something else that Tony could not decipher. His eyes were on Steve a little longer. He studied the soldier. His eyes looked tired, like those of others. But unlike the others, he had no scratches or stains on his face drawing the previous fight.
"The picture was uploaded just hours after the attack. She could have done it, yes, but it looks too good, too accurate, to paint with the few television images that existed at the time."
He had to admit that once one of his friends started to paint such pictures, he would take a closer look at them, too. "No chance that she had painted this subsequently?"
"What kind of trigger?", someone else asked. The mechanic raised his eyebrows as Steve looked down. Fury spoke up and the camera pointed quickly at him.
"It's interesting, but in the room where you, Stark, sleep, Jamie Handerson spent his last night in the US, almost a hundred years ago. The next day he was deported to Europe, where he died after only four weeks in the war. Splinter of a bomb that had been ignited inside of him. A painful end, which hit his parents and siblings strongly. But they knew what their boy was doing." Burkwill's voice darkened. "They knew something could happen to him. They had not been in the car with him on the way to the zoo to look at the new-born elephant without ever arriving there."
Images of his shield striking something Steve couldn’t see came over him. A scream and the pain that the creature that was hit by his shield must have felt.
"Tony had needed you all the last fucking three months, and now that he's maybe fucking dead, you start worrying about him?" Rhodey had become louder and ran toward Steve. The weapon in his hand swung menacingly in the direction of the soldier, but when the smaller came close, Steve realized his eyes were red.
Tony flew toward the creature at high speed and grabbed it with a loud crash. The repulsors ran harder as Tony grabbed the heavy creature and flew it up into the air. It roared loudly, but even louder were the screams of the other creatures and the army commands.
Tony couldn’t hear an answer, but then he clearly heard that several chairs were moving and people were slowly leaving the room.
"How?" he asked him. "We damn well have a babbler among us who knows a lot. And if that's not the case, then it was Friday's fault that the psychopath knew pretty much
"Really, Friday?” Tony asked annoyed. “First you offer me coffee, and then try to moralize? By the way, you weren’t even created for that shit,” he added quietly.
Tony could see Burkwill pressing his jaw together before turning to his people. "Good," he called. "General Astif!"
"Yes, but I didn’t say at what time. You were here earlier than I expected," Burkwill admitted. "You are my present for midnight. By then, you four will stay with me and then they can all go one by one until I have just you, Stark, and my son has finally been avenged."
"After I've sent Rogers out of my room, who prefers to play protector in a completely safe area than to take care of an alien army?"
"So, there are people who can communicate with these beings?" Tony summarized. "And you saw one of them. And this thing did not come alone, judging for the footsteps, dozens of them were on the spot. They had an order. Do you know where the creatures came from or what the men looked like?"
Tony looked up, rebuilt the façade. He trusted Pepper, and if Wilson and Khatib had really understood, they would need more time.
He didn’t introduce himself, nor did he greet the new arrivals, but he simply led them down a corridor, past much more civilized camera crews, and opened a door for them. It was a big, old-fashioned room, maybe an employee's office. Books adorned the walls and dark wood furniture made the room look smaller than it actually was. Maps and pictures of the presidents of the United States adorned the walls and a gold-plated clock indicated the time.
Both froze together as the deep voice boomed through the speakers. Slowly, Steve turned to face the screen and Tony could see the amazement in him, as he did not know what the map meant, neither.
Steve looked around. Yes, it was true. Each of the creatures raised his left leg slightly longer than the right, which looked like they were limping. Conversely, the right arm moved forward longer than the left. It looked like they were all the same person.
He took a small piece of his pizza while he dragged himself to the exit. His ribs burned again, the medication he had taken for the pain had to start working in a couple of minutes.
"Lang and Wilson are in Norway right now, they will check the case. You can never investigate enough. But we assume that it is nothing else. We found the other picture a few hours ago, it's only been a few days on the Internet. The woman said she had painted it years ago, the night after the Chitauri attack in New York."
He tried to pull. "It’s grown. Can’t pick it up." The armor made a smacking sound as it fell back onto the body.
Barnes and Steve looked at each other for a moment and then ran to find a bed. Tony thought he had seen a slightly disappointed look from Steve but had to be wrong. There should be two rooms, each with one bed, Van Peeters had said, and Wanda and Tony were running toward it. The narrow corridor had five doors, the two larger rooms left and right in front and behind that, the single rooms, before the last door probably led to the small bathroom. Tony scraped into the room next to Steve's and Bucky's and once again tore to open the window. The wooden door creaked as he closed it behind him. A fur lay on the floor of the chamber, where the thin bed and just a small closet could be found.
Clint nodded quickly and headed for one of the big planes. "I’ll fly. Bucky, Natasha, you stay with me on the plane, the rest goes out as soon as we get to the island and search at the ground."
He inhaled the smell of the bigger one and listened to the reassuring heartbeat. He raised his head and pressed his lips to Steve's, who returned the kiss warmly and familiarly.
Natasha showed her cell phone in the round. It showed a map of Boston with the red road snaking through the city. Steve exhaled audibly and Wanda nodded. "That's the same line that was on the screen," she confirmed.
And even though Tony knew Steve might never have had thought that, but only wanted to protect his friend, it hurt the most.
"A grenade had landed right on the street, just to the right of my son's door,” the man explained and his voice grew dangerously low. “The street was full, and he slept. We had no chance to escape. But do you know what I have seen? At this moment, which seemed to take years? When you know it's over and everything is running in slow motion? I saw the outside mirror and read the engraving on the grenade.
Natasha did not miss that either, and gave Steve and Maximoff a worried look. But finally, she took a breath. "We have just received a video from an unknown source. We were able to decrypt it now and play it," she explained.
"Protected," Tony finished the sentence. "Did you hear?" He asked everyone else. Rhodey agreed and Bucky called out of breath "Just be fast!".
Tony nodded and thought a moment too long. Steve looked at him worriedly. Those blue eyes seemed to pierce him.
Tony pointed to the neck and shoulders, but none of the agents seemed surprised. This information had not left the security wing, but the agents were not stupid. Video footage had shown them where the creatures were vulnerable.
On the big screen in front of Tony, a window appeared in which an elderly lady - in her mid-fifties, Tony guessed - quickly spoke into the camera. The grey hair of the woman whirled around in the strong wind, while in the background people ran in panic across a wide street and pointed to the sky. Something Tony couldn’t yet see was there.
I do not know how it will end. Will you kill me? Will one of your comrades kill me? Will Vision kill me? That would be the most likely scenario. He wants to show you that he can still belong to the team. He'll probably look at you right now and hope you give him a second chance. And you will grant them, for you too are too weak not to."
"So you change your damn mind again and let him go," Burkwill exclaimed angrily. And at the same time, Tony screamed, "You don’t touch me, no!"
It was a mistake to come here, he kept telling himself. In the mirror above the sink, a man looked at him, whom he did not know. His hands clenched on the edge of the sink as he stared down at his sunken cheeks and strong dark circles underneath his eyes. A bad shaved beard and uncombed, in many places already with grey strands intersected hair grew much too long.
He pressed his lips together and tried once more to turn his head, but a stinging pain ran through his whole body. He blew air from his nostrils and tried to remember what had happened. But the only thing that was really safe in his head was the pain that went through him. He tried to move his limbs and groaned.
Pepper had often told Tony that Barnes had been brainwashed, which had helped him accept that the man was still alive, but not to like him more. If she was not in China because of Stark Industries, she would probably stand next to him and say the same thing right now.
They would clarify today all the important changes. The Avengers were again a group and the danger was real.
Thank you, V_cameos for your comment on the last chapter. It's super nice from you to take the time.
Tony rubbed his hand over his forehead. "I let Friday check the environment again. Who saw or heard something? Who knows places where someone could hide? Maybe there is still a weak signal. I'll let her see through everything."
She was the only one who knew what had happened in Siberia, what Tony had seen on the video. She was the only one who knew why Tony had been so hurt by being betrayed by
"Wow," Clint murmured dryly and then, without further ado, ran to the skylight to rip it open. Tony turned away. It was cold, but the air smelled like a zoo, so he'd rather freeze than endure all the time.
Steve raised the shield as a huge, brown fist slammed against his face. He saw Clint shooting many arrows one after the other, while to the right Bucky threw swear words at the monsters that were attacking him.
"Work with us, don’t hide, Tony," the bigger one answered softly. His voice broke at the end of the sentence. "We need you and we want to protect you all, we -"
"Your blood levels aren’t right," she said sharply with a southern accent. "You’ll get medication. And painkillers for the bruised ribs and the arm. The flesh wounds will heal quickly. You can be lucky you’ve got no internal bleeding. This whole thing could’ve been much worse for you, Mr. Stark. The wounds from the splinters will probably be seen on your arm for a long time, but the rest will heal well."
Tony had forgotten the two things and was now glad that the little robot could do such work. Tony found the slime rather quickly. It seemed to be somewhat dry and was deposited directly over a particularly large pimple. The mechanic made a choking sound as he carefully removed the flaky mass from the monster with the tweezers and put it into the test tube. It looked like jelly, he realized. The mucus was slightly yellow, but you could see it. "Take this over there," Tony told his robot who carefully placed the test tube in a machine so that the artificial intelligence could take a closer look at the substance.
"We should leave that to ourselves before the others think you should really hand me over," Tony mumbled, sniffling and smiling at the same time, at Steve.
His skull ached and his throat seemed to let no air through. He closed his eyes for a moment, concentrating on everyday things. The red alarm clock. The big window. The black wardrobe.
Why the Winter Soldier was part of the team again was a mystery to Tony, and he felt pressure again as he thought of what the man had done. Tony's chest rose and fell too much as he tried to regain control.
Tony had heard of this organization many times. It became a big thing less than twenty years ago when he regularly received hate news from them on how he could support the war in the middle east. He had not taken the organization seriously. After all, they did exactly the same as he did. One day, he found his whole house sprayed with graffiti when he came home after a party. He clearly attributed this damage to supporters of the organization, and then had a chat with the CEO of SafetyWorld for press purposes. Nothing came out of it. After all, he had supplied the highest bidder in the war and SafetyWorld had a strong rejection against that, which is why the relationship in the following years progressed rather bad than right. Since leaving the arms industry, Tony had seen little of them, almost ousting the company.
"Exactly. So there were two more comments in other languages on the note, but they don’t seem to be very important, otherwise, they would have noted it differently."
"’Is the End of the World Building Up Across Toms River?’," he instead quoted the headline of a newspaper report. "'Aliens - Weapon of the Enemy, Myth or Propaganda?’”, he waited. The people listened carefully to his British accent he took on when he was seven years old. “’Is it for the Election? – An Alliance could turn the Numbers’, 'Danger nearby Philadelphia - World Powers Must Gear Up.'"
Bucky stared uneasily at the clock on the wall of the living room. "Has anyone seen something of Steve today?" he finally asked what had bothered him since the early morning.
"Good morning to you, too," Tony replied and looked up from his work briefly. Steve had running clothes and wet hair. "Have to stay in shape?"
"Mr. Krum is already on his way back here. He will arrive at any moment," a woman's voice with a strong Scottish accent answered from the other side of the bridge. Burkwill made words in his mouth that looked like he was saying, "She's smart," or something, but Tony could not tell. He was thinking again. They needed a moment more time.
Natasha stood back to back with Clint and hit the monsters incredibly precisely on the neck. Many went down in front of her, and if that was not the case for a while, Clint was often able to rescue her. It looked as if they had fought like this forever, and not found each other again only a few minutes ago, after months of sparing talk, if at all.
Carelessly he threw the sand next to him and kept searching. Suddenly he felt something hard. Steve closed his eyes briefly. The panic vanished when he saw the red rails protecting Tony's legs. Relieved, Steve dropped his head. "Thanks," he mumbled. "At least you don’t do that to us."
But when it was dark, this reflection did not work. Just a little light came from the one used room of this corridor. The monitors, which displayed all the important data right next to the patient, kept shining in the large room. But for The Person, these monitors would only give the necessary light. They would not show any data that were from interest.
"The power didn’t show an accurate system when and where it appeared. That's why we couldn’t identify any causes yet. It was detected mainly by power outages. We can’t even say with certainty whether all power failures were caused by the same thing or not. We have no clues. The only thing we knew was that something was going on."
"Quiet!" Shouted the lunatic now. He stepped closer to Tony and grinned as the mechanic fell silent. "Or you want that not all five, but only four of your comrades to get out of here? Or even less." He looked around. "Vision, are you still mad at me because of our disagreement? We said I forgive you and you forgive me."
Of course, he'd thought about what he could do, calculating everything at his flight from New York to Toms River. But the only way to save the inhabitants of the small city and the nearby metropolis had been to shoot the creature in the air.
For the first time, Tony saw that Barnes was ashamed. He was ashamed of what he had done as Winter Soldier.
Steve wiped the sweat from his forehead. For hours now he was walking across the beach, climbing over rocks, looking into every little cave Tony could be in. He had nothing to drink with him and the sun shone down mercilessly on him. He also couldn’t get in touch with Friday to find out anything about the area; he had no equipment for that. The state of the sun told him that it was already noon. Exhaustedly, Steve dropped to his knees. How should he find Tony? There were far too many possibilities, he could be everywhere, in every cave, on every stretch of beach.
, it had gone through his mind, which had been bothering him for days. Bucky had fought for him and had extreme problems now. It was no longer the Winter Soldier who had been lying in front of Tony, it was no longer a murderer. It was a colleague, a friend who had done everything to protect Tony and, in the end, apologized for something else.
At some point, it also became quiet in the living room and Tony, still sitting on the floor, could hear that the room doors next to him were all slowly closing. It took him half an hour before he could get up. Quietly he stood at the window and rummaged his phone out of his pocket. He tried again to call Pepper, but again the answering machine was the only thing to be heard. He rubbed his hand over his face. He knew he had to do something. His gaze wandered back to the door, then back to the window.
Natasha and Steve both could not help grinning. "I suppose Friday is already analysing?" The soldier asked and Tony nodded in response.
He waved his glasses around to show where the camera was hidden. "So, we have all the images in Ultra-HD ready for analysis."
They were again a team, not teenagers going through a relationship crisis. He quickly passed his hand over his tired eyes and climbed into the elevator.
So, this is the very last chapter of this story. I just brought in this giant metaphor. I hope it's understandable.
Sorry for not posting at the weekend. I kind of didn't realise it was that short. Two days aren't enough.
"If you can think of anything about these creatures, please contact this address," Steve explained, handing her a card. This conversation was over, the woman could not tell them anymore. She nodded as she looked at the map and stood up, Tony doing it to her.
And that was what Tony saw. He was the third to walk up the narrow wooden stairs, and a musty smell came to meet him. Wanda, who was running in front of him, coughed and put her hand over her mouth when she saw the dust. The last rays of sun fell through a skylight and showed clearly that nobody cleaned up here for years.
"Our country was attacked. Hardly anyone dares to do talk about something else than that. It had been aliens. Anyone writing about the election campaign or Korea or something will go down completely."
He turned his eyes away again and he looked at General Astif pervasively. "A city being attacked would bring nothing but innocent people to die, devastated areas and a too-fast death for Stark."
"You're alone," the voice said. Tony could hear the monster's joy. "Do not worry, the other Avengers are not getting any news. I'll tell you where to go now. And make no move to let your comrades know. You have already noticed that you have a security leak with you and I can assure you it's not Friday."
"In the tank," whispered Vision, too weak to speak normally. "I overheard him, he rebuilt the tank. Inside is just enough room for a small
Tony nodded weakly and looked down at himself. His wet T-shirt was soaked with blood, and red hands held him under his armpits. He was glad that he could at least ruin one of Burkwill's people's day, but then he heard the familiar voice behind him. "Take a deep breath, Tony, it'll be better soon."
"We got another important point of the analysis a few minutes ago," he said, without further justifying the delay, let alone welcoming the attendees. The Avengers and agents still standing sat down. The chair next to Tony creaked as Steve sat down and nodded to the inventor. Tony smiled at him for a moment, then turned back to Fury, who did not bother looking for a chair.
"It must have been what the alien said." She paused. "I could not understand it, but then I heard something else. I can remember exactly. Two men came out from behind the thing. One was old, he smoked and called the other a boy. They talked in English, but the younger one had an accent that I could not match. But he apparently understood the monster."
He was silent for a moment, probably thinking of the man who had described how his son had been killed.
Bruce’s astonishment wears off; he gently nudges Steve’s shoulder and waits for the soldier to wake. Steve snorts and mutters, “’ust fovemore minits, son.”
Peter is laid up against Steve as the party ends. Little Harry is out too, and Mr. Osborn bids farewell.
He leaves the room, promising Pepper everything will be taken care of and he will explain further in an email. Pepper does her fire breaths and goes too; she needs to be with some regular people.
Peter swung back and forth in his dads’ arms. They carried him through the streets of the Capital with his parents together in Lincoln Park. He felt like he was flying or jumping in style like when Nat helped him with his skate tricks. They did not talk much, but Peter was happy for that. Talking had too much energy.
“This isn’t’ about that!” Bucky yells. “Steve, you idiot, you can’t waltz and expect all this to blow over. Your kid’s been asking for you for weeks and suddenly you show up out of the blue. You think that’s fair to him. You really think he’ll be okay if this happens again.”
“Asking us our plans for the holidays,” grunted Captain America when he caught his shield. “Tony and I are going to Malibu for the holidays and then some. We’re thinking it may be our last bet to get some alone time with Peter before he starts school next year.”
Stealthily, Clint gets closer and kneels at the bedside. A huge pang in his chest; this makes him think of his own son. Clint closes his eyes. If he were to pretend, he is in his son’s room at their farm, Laura coming in to tell him it is bedtime. His baby girl will be awake in a few hours, crying for attention, food, a changing.
Heimdall in all his millennia is dumbstruck when a Midgardian child appears. The god stares at the boy, losing some concentration of other worlds. He finds his voice eventually, but that is after the boy comes up to him and says in a Wisp’s voice, “Hurt?”
Bruce smiles and leaves with Clint right after. “Tell him to wait for my lessons with that sling. It’s dangerous in the wrong hands.”
They get three dogs. Plain with ketchup for Peter, fully loaded with chilly for Pops, and Dad gets his with extra sauerkraut. A coke, a bottled water, and a small apple juice are added too as they find a shady bench to sit on. Again, Peter is between his parents. He leans closer to Pops because he has been too far away. Pops places his big hand on Peter’s head and ruffles it.
Barnes chews at his meal slowly. His one arm holds the sandwich like it is a snake. Sam sits across at the bistro. After hours of being suffocated by these two, it is a relief to get one of them out. Sam hums at Barnes’ lackluster hunger and bites big on his Philly cheese. They continue in this silent eating for the remainder of the meal.
Peter unhooked his seatbelt, gave a swift wave to Mr. Coulson and follwed his aunt. The car with Happy was a few blocks down. They entered and Aunt Natasha asked if he wanted a snack.
“Alaric, take Rolfe with you to market. I have some unintended business,” he says and gestures to the boy. Alaric follows and agrees, taking Rolfe by the hand.
There’s no evidence of what happened. The armor soaked most of the impacts and Steve held back. A little bruising in his ribs and scraped knuckles from Barnes are all he has from the fight. Peter’s smart. Too smart for his age. Tony hopes he can come up with something to tell Peter. An utter lie sounds right about now.
“Yes,” she said giggling. “There was a young boy at the fountain.” She pointed, showing her free hand, at the center fountain of the city. It was large and high with several spigots of water. “He was so small that I had assumed he was with the delegation. Then I saw this clothes, as is my profession, and I noticed how strange they were. But then, Lord Volstagg came and took the young boy with him. I believe…he said they were going to have an audience with Thor.”
Two plush toys, a cat and a mouse, dressed in the superhero personae’s of Steve and Stark. Their hands are tied by a white layer of string and something else. Bucky takes it in his hand.
Mr.Coulson was staring at him. Peter felt it. It was not like his spidey sense, which tingled often before danger. No, this was something Peter did not understand.
He takes one out and asks for the lighter. Bucky throws it to him. Steve takes both to the open window of Sam’s apartment. He lights it and puffs a few out to let it burn.
His hideout for now is not elaborate or original. It is a small cabin in Virginia with some luxuries and amenities. Loki gets out and opens the door. Peter stirs in his seat and opens his eyes.
“Yes,” Sif said, groaning. “All this time and the child was safe and on his way to the palace. Let’s us return before their supper is done. I am famished.”
So, to explain, there is no straight p.o.v and if the chapter is a bit confusing please tell me. I meant to put as a stream of views into people at a crowded place and to follow them as things happen. Also, the last bit, of course Fury has three agendas. Also, I realized I left out Sam Wilson. I will rectify that later on.
Poor Steve is lost on the reference of Ann Nicole Smith until he asks, “Is she married to an older gentleman?”
So, a few weeks after the party and the doctor visit, Tony and Steve have yet to realize their error.
“I am a son of Odin. A god, you dull child. I am the one who brought this world to its knees and the Mightiest Heroes almost lost their lives because of ME!”
"When my great-grandfather came and took Bestla's immortality, it gave giants another way out. My hammer Mjolnir is one of a set." Thor pulls the heavy thing from his belt. It is an impressive weapon with intricate filigree decoration. "The other was Storm Breaker, which he left for the giants as a parting gift and negotiation of sorts  for Bestla's hand. However, it was not well-received at the time."
Peter stepped back. He had not seen Coulson since Easter and the man had the same look then. He and pops had gotten into a loud argument that Peter did not catch.
"Remember this," Da said. "Peter remember this place. It was where I met Tony and one of the few places your people are connected to." Da came closer and held Peter looking at him. "Your papa's people are still within our world. They're just mortal now walking among us. But, their stories, their presence, will always be felt."
Steve is dutiful to his promise. Everyday he comes to the east woods and follows the path to his Willow Man. Anthony greets him in kind, always in the tree, just out of reach. Steve has shared his history and weapons. Anthony's curiosity shines through with every new item and detail told. Steve notes Anthony never leaves the willow's branches.
"I too saw that this big brute had more brains than he let on. I saw the expectation and disappointment I knew well from my father. But, I also felt this warmth in me. Which is strange for a frost giant. After the storm had broke, I lowered my head for Thor."
Steve lets go first once Anthony calms. The small frown on the man's face disappears quickly. Steve knows that he wanted more.
Bucky waited as Steve slowly removed the car off him. He was bruised and battered, a welcome distraction to the other feelings. Steve grunted as the Mercedes was a bit stuck. Bucky put pity on him and with his free metal arm lifted the bottom half. The destroyed vehicle came off like a Band-Aid and the two walked up the stairs for the rest of the damage.
There is no time for scolding as the hour comes and they are to go to their places for the ceremony. Peter is thrusted behind a little girl with pigtails and a yellow dress. Behind, Miss Potts holds out her arm for pops as he is to give her away.
Stephen leans down to the boy and smiles. Peter has a quietness to him most children do not possess. He brushes the boy’s hair out of his face. Peter glances to his fathers and waves small.
She stepped down from the assembled party and kneeled, much like Jane. Thor decided to copy their stance.
Peter smiled with his impish green eyes. He will understand later in life of his origins and his papa's people. And that, the world is full of others like him. But, for the toddler, now is about the night sky, the shining flowers and the love between his parents.
In the background, JARVIS wishes to roll non-existent eyes. For another error must be fixed and he is not too glad to speak to Agent Carter.
“I don’t have time to shave it all off or go to a barber,” he said. Steve returned to his dresser and started to take out clothes.
„When we came down here Groot talked, he talked but that wasn‘t Groot, he attacked us but I managed to nook him out and then he turned green, but he is not the only one, Rocket was acting weird as well. The fake Groot said most of the crew is taking. We need to do something“ Peter rumbled down in an immense speed.
“Bruce and I helped to built Ultron. Don’t focus your anger on Anthony alone” he yelled at Thor who then let Tony down.
“Please don’t do this. What do you want? Information’s? You can have them!” Steve yelled loud enough to not be drowned in the yelling of the others. Killian turned slowly to him while one of the soldiers ripped of Tony’s shirt.
„What, no, thats disgusting. But I am building some web-shooters in my free time. I decided to swing with the spider theme. Ha, swing, did you see what I did there?“
“It’s not over, father. You can’t kill me. I am not done yet” he laughed, barley understandable with all the mechanic quirks.
„First of all we need to make sure that even if we get separated we can prove  to each other that we are we“ Harley thought and than turned around towards a desk with multiple office materials on it. He fished out a black sharpie and showed it proud to Peter: „We just draw a dot somewhere on our body that a Skrull or what ever they call themself could mistake for a birthmark but when one of us asks if the other person is who they say they are then we show the dot.“
He waited a few minutes until Harley came running around the corner, who barley managed stop in front of him.
Peter jumped and with his new powers stuck to the ceiling while the fake Peter below him got blasted by Harley.
Fast he followed him to the cell with the glass front. Inside Tony sat on the floor, back resting against the wall and one leg pressed against his chest. When he saw Steve he jumped up and sprinted the short way to the glass wall.
In one of the cells Peter saw Mr. Stark sitting on the floor next to Rocket and Groot. He as well sprung up when he saw them.
“Did you know Fassamau?” Steve suddenly asked. He had nearly forgotten about the ensign after everything that happened afterwards but now that the adrenaline left his body it all came back.
“Please, test my security system. I am quite proud of” the psychopath said without sparing the dead body next to him a second glance.
“Not when this talk would include them of accusing me of sleeping my way up. I worked too hard to get where I am now.”
“I think we should leave. We survive until we find another class M planet with the resources we still have on the ship” he said and Bruce visibly relaxed by the thought of leaving this place.
“Thank you” Tony said smiling and jumped up. He pressed a kiss on Steve’s lips before leaving the Holodeck, leaving Steve alone with the reminders of the picnic. It was kind of a habit of Tony to leave in a hurry.
The second bag took a lot longer to empty itself than the first one and Tony stayed unconscious for the entire time. Some of the others drifted off into an unrestful sleep, even when the position was everything but optimal. Steve on the other hand couldn’t close his eyes; they were fixed in his lover.
“I am Groot” the tree agreed when Steve left and even through the closed door he could hear Rocket jell: “There are enough trees as well”
“Tony!” Steve realized and sprinted to the elevator Bruce and Natasha hot on his heal. To their luck the emergency generator supported most elevators with enough electricity, otherwise they would have a problem, were there barley any stair on the ship.
Mr. Stark activated his communicator and started to talk: „Captain, I have two humans …“ but he couldn‘t finish the sentence for he fell down nocked out and turned green. Harley stood behind him the metal pipe still raised just in case he had to hit again.
“He said his next move will be breathtaking. Steve, he goes after the oxygen supplies” Tony informed him.
“Yeah, Tony worked his magic” Steve responded and clapped Tony on the back, who didn’t realize a thing, to engaged in the computer in front of him.
“How? They had been by 70% just a few seconds ago” Carol asked while maneuvering the ship so it would collide with as few laser as possible. Steve let out an angry groan and pressed the button to his right.
Shaking his head Steve left to find Tony in the lab. With a small bing the door opened and Steve entered the white room where he immediately saw Peter and Harley sitting on the floor surrounded by robot parts. Both boys stood up as soon as they saw him, Peter even stumbled over a metal plate.
“So we are stuck at the Avenger for a few years until we reach Terra again” Thor stated with a shrug. For an Asgardien with a life span of 5000 years that was like as uncomfortable summer. For a human, like most of Steve’s crew, a lost decade is a catastrophe.
“I wanted to know what was happening so I came in shortly after the attack. Tasha knew” Clint said with a full mouth. Tony and Natasha snickered.
„Take it slow. MJ, stay with him while I free everyone“ he ordered and MJ nodded. Peter turned and gripped the card the Skrull had dropped.
The two boy looked curious up from where they were sitting on the floor, grease smeared over Harleys face and Peter’s hair pointing in every direction.
„Cool, right? I think I can do some spider things now. I am also stronger and faster“ Peter explained now chilling on the ceiling.
“Left!” Tony whispered only for Steve to hear and for whatever reason Steve decided to trust Tony with this. Maybe all AIM facilities were build the same way and Tony had memorized it. Steve followed Tony’s orders and the others followed him until they reached a big locked door.
“Could you take the needle out of my arm? You know how much I hate them” Tony asked and Steve immediately did so as careful as possible. As soon as he got Tony out of the chair he carried him piggyback  stile to the others, Tony’s head rested on his shoulder.
Steve opened the number pat next to the glass and started to tip numbers until a click sound told him that the door was unlocked. The glass wall disappeared in to the floor and Tony looked up to him with wide eyes.
When he turned around he could see Bruce talking to Tony about some plants he hoped to find on the planet. He expected the earth to be full of ceric ammonium nitrite which turned it the significant orang color and Tony nodded interested. Steve would have liked to come closer just to hear Tony’s voice but he didn’t want to push the other man. Fassamau tried to join the exchange a few times but unlike Janet who through in comments left and right the Ensign didn’t seemed to keep up with the science talk.
Tony’s eyes where wide in shock, his mouth gaping open. Then he closed his now orange eyes and was knocked out cold. His rising chest indicated that he was at least still breathing.
„Ok, I made Ned come out with me. Only for a few minutes. It was the first time the entire ship landed and I wanted to get out of here for a little bit. We might have gotten separated in the really short time we were on the planet and I might have been attacked“ he continued and Harley took in a sharp breath.
“Tony, breath. We are here. You are safe” Steve reassured his lover and let his hand slight through Tony’s thick black hair.
„Better question, is that the real Peter and if so, why does he stuck to the ceiling?“ Mr. Stark wanted to know. Peter dropped down with a somersault and grind sheepishly.
„Hey Mr. Barton, Mr. Wilson, are you looking for someone? I am pretty sure Captain Skrull Rogers is on the bridge “ he yelled to gain their attention and it worked. Both man stopped and turned towards him and Harley.
„I can punch you“ MJ interjected and before one of them could say something she punched Harley hard in the face. His lip burst and blood flood out of the wound. Harley yelled in pain and pressed his hand against his lip. MJ just turned around and left.
“Everyone ok?” he asked quiet and received a bunch of mumbled yes’. Then he stood up and sprinted towards Tony. He could see Tony’s orange eyes in the dim light the now orange arc reactor provided as well as the piece of fabric Tony had spit out.
„I am going to tell you something that I told no one else, not even Ned and you need to promise that you won‘t tell a single living person, ever! Ok?“ Peter asked nervous and Harley raised an eyebrow.
„How am I supposed to know, you are older and you have superpowers. You are responsible“ Harley yelled holding up not much better.
“Does this keep your heart beating? Fascinating! I wonder how it will react with the serum” Killian thought to himself and betted the blue light in Tony’s chest much to everyone’s displeasure.
“Well, no for pretty much the same reason. The people in the crew choose to follow orders so Ultron was supposed to have the same freedom” Tony whispered. Thor gave an enraged jell and stepped forward to grip Tony’s already sore throat. Strong arms raised Tony from the ground.
„That was awesome. I mean you fighting, not that Groot was replaced by some shapeshifting alien. And Rocket probably as well“ Harley said as he stepped next to Peter to get a better look on the Alien.
“You wanted to know what Extremis does with a human in combination with the arc reactor. That’s it” Tony said loud and all the guns started to fire.
“We should postpone this conversation for when we are back on the Avenger. The facility is going to blow up in proximately five minutes” Tony said and immediately all of them run towards the door.
The original Captain raised his weapon but smoke erupted and took Peter and Harley‘s vision. As soon as it was back they saw the team from the bridge laying on the floor unconscious while perfect copies took over their places. Someone came to drag the bodies away.
“Tony and I made an old movie marathon and Conan is out of one of them. Really bulky and strong” Clint explained and throws a handful ships in his mouth.
“So, last bag. Looks good for your friend” Killian informed the team while connecting the new bag to the IV and then left again.
“Exactly! There are nearly thousand people on this ship and I am on first name terms with maybe 15. Everyone else would start questioning my qualification to be in command” Tony said and rested his forehead against Steve’s chest. The Captain pilled him closer.
“You Bastard. You are going to pay for this” Steve promised him and spit in his direction but Killian was out of his reach.
From the ensign was nothing left except the orange fluid and some blood. Steve felt unbelievable guilty for being glad it had hit Fassamau and not one of his friends. He was the Captain, he should care about all his people the same way.
“I need to tell the crew” Steve gulped. That was going to be hard. He thought of the four babies they had on the ship who will see their home planet for the first time when they are already in school.
„Are you that useless that you had to trick this small mammals. You could have just gripped them“ Denvers said with an evil grin that looked so wrong on her face.
“Holodeck. Stark is working on an Ultron proof System. He also found out what Ultron’s plan is, but you know that already, right?” Steve said eyes fixed on the dead bodies.
„Nope, everything fine. We just hit the wrong button“ Peter explained fast and the elevator begun to move again.
Down here everything appeared normal. The ten years weren’t looming over them like the rest of the ship. Down here where they could do science without being disturbed, where they did what they loved most. With Hanks hand smeared in ink from writing down notes the old fashion way and Bruce’s nose stuck in some analyses he was running. With Harley throwing isolating material at Peter and Tony smiling his real smile, the one he didn’t wear around most people. With Dumm-y, who Tony brought with him on every expedition as some kind of good luck charm, peeping happily next to his creator. If Steve had known it was the calm before the storm he would have probably stayed down there longer.
“You don’t happen to have some spare weapons” Natasha asked and T-Challa nodded holding three guns up for them to take. Bruce as always passed and Steve had both hands looked under Tony’s knees to secure him but Natasha, Clint and Janet took the guns gratefully.
“Ok, that’s it. We leave now before Killian finds us. Tony calm down! We find another exit!” Steve said and gripped Tony.
“If that is all, how about we leave so we can go home” Steve offered and stood up followed by Tony who softly groaned by the fast movement.
Suddenly four green figures came around the corner. They stopped when they saw the escaping prisoners and turned around, probably to get support.
“Mighty Thor, My King and Queen, and Lady Jane,” Volstagg began. “I Volstagg the Bear of Asgard have the opportunity, ney, the privilege to introduce the son of the Man of Iron and Captain America.”
“But, ye can speak. Have spoke. Surely…”Volstagg trails off looking at the anguished face of the boy. Peter shakes his head.
Steve walked through the east woods, sword hilted and shield on his back. His path ahead aimless for the sunny day. To him it seemed too sunny. Too much life. Peculiar how one becomes accustomed to death in a few short years.
“I guess you two trashed Sam’s place if you’re panting this much. Swing by your old place, that’s where we are. Peter’s having fun with your record collection you left here,” Tony says.
"The Elders of the Mount, including my father, made a terrible snowstorm. Truly testing Bor's resolve and his love for Bestla. They made it and their happy ending came," Loki finishes with a sneer.
Tony hacked in all the cameras from New York to New Jersey where the distress signal ended. JARVIS calculated all the possible directions Loki could have taken. They were lucky to have a hotel employee remember the corvette with the odd man and the boy. Tony and Bruce spent over thirty hours searching through security footage at gas stations and Steve went out with Sam and Thor to ask highway troopers.
And Coulson is alone. For once, the weight of his job, his duty, and the suffering from his resurrection lifts. He stays to finish his fruity drink and thinks about Peter’s smiling at him when he can tell the boy that he will never be taken away. That is a small blessing.
Steve’s mind halted for a minute. He looked at his son, whose medical records were encrypted, and wondered what in God’s name had been done to keep this child alive.
Loki only hums as he passes the bridge out the island city. His hideout is further away and it helps that the boy is mostly quiet. Once out of the immediate New York sky, Loki talks.
“I see,” says Strange and he places his hands in a prayer-like pose. “Have either of you gentlemen been fans of The Who?”
They are arguing colors when Peter, being the precocious boy he is, goes to the shining circle and walks in; the door is left open on most occasions because only Thor ventures through it and back.
He moves about the apartment, frantic. His fingers shake and objects drop from his hands. Steve finds Bucky’s room. The bed and everything in the room is bleak and utilitarian. Steve cannot pass the threshold. A hand brushes his shoulder. Steve is a rock. Bucky passes him and lifts his neatly folded pillows. In his human hand is a pack of Marlboro.
Tony feels the vibrations thud against his bed frame that hit his skull in painful waves. In his haze, he makes a noise. He thinks he makes a noise. His mouth opens and his larynx does something. A hand shakes him; Tony swats at it.
They had gotten him a telescope and astrological map with handwritten directions to by Heimdall for unclaimed (by Midgardian standards) constellations.
“Yeah,” Steve says. He sniffs and holds Tony tighter. “We can’t let them beat us. You can’t let them hurt you. They can’t hurt you anymore. Peter’s okay. He’ll be okay.”
“Where’ve you been? Sam said you and Barnes had some shit to hash out. Don’t worry, Peter’s in the other room.”
Tony tries but clearly Agent needs him in top shape for the man handles him until he is positioned upright.  A tube is pressed against his lips.
“Steve,” Tony sobs. “I-I…I have nightmares. Every day. I’m awake and I see Peter being taken. Loki, Fury, AIM, someone else. Just a pervert who likes little boys. I see them and I can’t stop them.”
Thor is about to say something and Pepper’s hands tremble, in this, she has not taken Peter’s absence.
“You know I have to tell Tony. You know he’ll come after you. Bucky, answer me, please,” Steve pleads.
In case anyone is confused, Tony did not know Bucky was the one who killed his parents. He only knew some of the terrible things and that Steve (his husband) may have had feelings for Bucky.
Steve felt a spike of jealousy. He stamped it down for this endeavor. Loki looked at him. The slender man appears to assess Steve.
The other thing Tony loved was that Steve could say something so simple and powerful to make him cry again and feel more human.
“I am here for the next 49 minutes 37 seconds because if your marriage does fail Peter won’t be going to neither you nor Rogers. SHIELD has orders to transfer Peter into a foster family under our surveillance.”
That is when he noticed the absence of Peter. Volstagg is not even sure how the boy got away or where. The doors and columns were high and no mere mortal could pass them. He then reminded himself of how Peter was the son of Avengers.
“You’re right. I don’t deserve this life or to be happy.” Bucky looks Stark in the eye. “But, I accept the damage I caused. I did those things without the excuse of mind control. You have every right to be pissed at me. You have every right to never let me near you or your family again.” Bucky sees Stark take a step back. He steps forward. “I want you to know this one bit of knowledge: for all I’ve done to you, I am truly sorry.”
“177A Bleecker Street,” she says. “You’ll find someone there who can help Peter. Director Fury advises extreme consideration before you decide to go. Also,” she stands straight. “I’ve never seen happier parents.”
Steve lied on his stomach. It was noon and he had not left his bed. He groaned. Licked his lips. His mouth had a chalky taste to it, probably from all the beer he’s taken on. Though, also maybe from eating chips for three days straight. Still, he was in tip-top form. Lovely, just lovely.
“Precious little one, do not fear. My King is simply joyous to know such warriors have a young heir interested in Asgard,” Frigga finished and held out her hand.
Steve was up. He had no reason to be up, but, alas, he was and he surveyed the room. All normal since he and Tony’s last visit to the Malibu house. The ocean’s waves hit the beach outside and the alarm was still active, as far as Steve could tell from the signal on his phone. He was about to cuddle with Tony when—
A shadow covers them. Steve looks up. His breath is taken away by the visage of Tony. Tony kneels down and pats Peter’s back.
"Will you come down today?" Steve asks, pretending to ignore the flinch in Anthony. "I brought a blanket and some refreshment for this to be a proper picnic."
Peter choked on his sandwich a bit. He tried holding a laugh. He took out some chips and celery sticks. Gwen had her poor sandwich. It dripped jelly and Peter could not smell much peanut butter. He passed her some of his celery and chips.
Peter held his lunch tin close. Mr. Coulson sighed and turned to look at Peter. The man in black turned onto the bridge.
Clint opens the windows to the kid’s room. The best part of living here is that unless he’s bugging Bruce or sparring with Steve, Tony forgets him completely.
“Pete, how many times have we told you not to go off,” Steve says. He has his full-on Captain Pops voice.
Steve grins and looks down. Peter is clinging to the Captain Americat and Iron Mouse plush like a lifeline.
Steve rubs his temples and sighs. Peter did not ask for powers. Peter was going to die. What did he do? He desperately wished to fight in a war and make a difference, at the cost of a normal life. And Peter is just a boy who does not even know what’s been done to him. He has an unhealthy fear of needles and will not spear more than three words.
He emerges from bed and signs about the rest of his suit. Steve signs back that it can be gotten once Peter is secure.
He sees the punch seconds before Stark, but he lets the man do it. The punch is not the hardest he’s taken certainly not the worst. It leaves a bad taste in his mouth.
A bowl of batter fell from one of the shelves on Sif’s head and she heard a voice, so soft, say “Volstagg.”
It was monotonous. An interesting rumor did spread from the penultimate group; apparently, one of the delegates claimed to have a child in strange clothing appear and disappear at the gates.
“But, you said they made you. Sam said they washed your brain and everything. You didn’t mean to do any of that bad stuff.” Peter looked at him, pleading in his eyes.
If anyone is confused by Ursa's reasoning this is what happened: her birth mother,the Vanderbilt, and her other mother had her through in vitro and then the birth mother's family threatened to cut her off if she stayed with her lover. So, they split up and the birth mother had to marry a man. This messed with Ursa because she loves her other mother and not her step father, so she's been taking it out on other students. She targets Peter because he has two dads and she had to lose one of her moms. In her mind, only two moms can have a baby and two dads cannot. Remember, these are eight-year-olds.
“My daddy likes to bring me to his office so I can be the boss when he’s bored. I have all the pens hidden in my desk at home. The pens are for o’icial stuff like suing people who take money from daddy and try’na screw daddy out of business. There’s too a big chair only daddy and me can sit in ‘cause we’re important and big. My room’s filled with toys is yours?” Peter nodded. “We can play action heroes and villains, like Batman and Joker. I can read real good and I have a lot of comics because daddy gets me them when I finish a book. The books he gives me aren’t always fun. They’re boring,” Harry whispers loudly into Peter’s ear.
“We can’t lock Peter away. He’s not some treasure we hoard from the world because we’re afraid he’ll be taken.”
"It means what is on your mind," Steve clarifies. "You've been happy to see me, but there's always something...."
Steve walks up the familiar stairs to his DC apartment. He sees the door. Dear god, how long has it been? Two, three years perhaps. Steve gulps. He walks toward the polish oak and stares. The brass 4 on it. He stares. Tony’s bound to know he’s here. The man always said Steve’s footfalls are thunder claps outside his uniform. He opens the door to Tony about to open it.
“He’ll have Harry. He’ll make new friends at the camp this summer. And other kids will accept him. Peter’s a hard kid not to love,” Steve said.
Next to them was a stump covered in vines and buds. Papa said that the flowers would bloom this eve.
Steve is blasted on his bed. The repulsors were on stun, but Steve won’t stay down for long. Tony blasts the window and flies out to the Washington sky. He has a man to kill.
Peter eyes are cast down and he nods. He leans up to Steve’s ear and Bruce knows he says “sorry” by the way the blond nods. Tony is next and he takes Peter to the bathroom.
“He didn’t see May that day, but he saw her at the funeral. He had this blanket and I guess it was from her because he dropped it in the casket,” Steve rubs his hair back.
“We can also rent a movie tonight if you want,” Mr. Happy says. “I think there’s some new stuff this week.”
"Back to us. Over a  century later, most of the giants have left. The Elders turned to the new stone and I am left alone. Storm Breaker stayed at its post upon the lowest peak, and my fear of mortality as well. And then, one day this bumbling idiot waltzes into my cave," Loki says with such fondness.
The elevator stops and Bruce huffs. It was Natasha’s insistence that the married couple add a doorbell of some kind to their home; of course, Bruce is one of the few who has not seen them making whoopee.
Jane rolled her eyes, but smiled. Dr. Selvig shrugged and brought a bag to the table. Thor cleared his throat and the room was on him.
Peter squeezes his hand. Bruce looks down at the little boy. He’s grown no longer the malnourished kid Steve brought home. Bruce squeezes back as reassurance. Peter looks up brown eyes still so innocent yet soulful.
“I know you care,” Jane said, smiling sweetly. “However, Fury and Coulson, maybe Natasha, have to come and trust those two with a child first before anything gets out.”
However, he did not explore it much because the car screeched to a stop as a loud thump hit the hood. Peter looked up to see Uncle Clint posed with his arrows at the driver. Next the door was opened by his Aunt Natasha.
At the end of this Anthony had tears pooling in his eyes. Steve takes a beat, and then, embraces his beloved. Anthony breaks and holds Steve so tightly. The Willow Man shakes. He nuzzles against the warrior's neck. Steve messages circles into the man's back.
Wong is next to him as he enters the room. The Orb of Agamotto stands in the center of a room unfurnished, hidden in a glass dome. Stephen lifts it and looks into the orb for any signs in Peter’s future.
"Tomorrow I will come visit you and everyday until I have news of the travelers," he declares. It is not a complete lie.
Before he presses the button to alert the residence, Bruce swears he hears a different voice from JARVIS.
Tony was a bit under until it dawned on him; Steve with shield in hand brought a light of panic in Tony’s eyes.
“Yes.” His dad embraced Peter and held tight. “He’s not a good man, Peter. Bucky’s been through some hell, so not everything is his fault. However, he is not the same guy he was when Cap knew him. I want you to know, and I hate to do this, but there are people out there who say the right things and make you feel safe,” his dad said. His voice got a little thick. “In reality, they are only after something. Something precious and worthwhile, which, if taken, will never be restored properly. It comes back mended.” His dad stopped.
The second day of having the Stark child is uneventful as the day before. Peter has remained compliant and shown Loki his powers. They are arachnid in nature and a bit of that serum the Good Captain had taken. Nothing else is to be done until Loki can find a practical training place. This cabin is nice to hide, but he has neighbors none too far off.
(I have reread the chapter and made a slight change I thought I had done earlier. The part where they take a swab of spit I change to a small needle of blood. I don't know how that got passed me.) Jan. 23, 2017
"Peter, moy malen'kiy pauk, please come with me. Mr. Coulson and Barton have some important things to discuss."
“You don’t get to be sorry,” Stark says. He leans in closer. Bucky smells the expensive cologne this man has. “I may be the biggest screw up, but you almost fucked up Steve and Peter’s life. You don’t deserve forgiveness or to be seen again.”
“You’re welcome,” Peter says. He goes to hug Bucky around the legs. Bucky stiffens for a moment. With his arm he holds the toys in his elbow while he pats Peter’s brown hair.
“Okay, I get it. The answer is yes….HYDRA did this to me. Made me crazy and forget my friends. Made me….hurt people.”
“Well, kid, that’s not true. You see, I’ve done some terrible things to good people. You shouldn’t even be here.”
Once, he thinks, there was a time Anthony had been content in his lot. He was the Willow Man; providing wisdom and herbs for passing man. His friends a constant rotation in his singular orbit. He's been alone with squirrels, hedgehogs, and the occasional hawk. It's a life. It's a life he regrets daily.
This is the second to last chapter, which I have half-way done. But, it is blocking me for the moment so hopefully I will have it done by the end of the week.
SO, I have not realized this until now but I called Dr. Strange "Vincent" as in Vincent Price. I have finally corrected that mistake but cannot believe no one said anything :(
“We should make a play date with that Osborn kid,” Steve says. “Peter’s missing him and I know he wants someone besides Pooh-JARVIS to play with, Tony.”
“Yeah, but…”Bruce bites his lower lip. “Erskine’s serum was never replicated. At least, not like it worked with Steve. However, from the grapevine, others have attempted to recreate it using their own…methods. I looked up Dr. Parker. His work at OSCORP involved the regeneration of cells. He was invested with not only arachnids, but certain types of reptiles, like lizards, in how they could help with the human cellular repair. Of course, the testing was cancelled after it did not show the desired results…”
Even though he can talk, Peter still forgot to speak on most occasions. He still had his notepad and various pencils. Sometimes, Peter went a week without a word. His dads had yet to get used to his voice. JARVIS too seem daunted by him asking for something out loud. Peter wondered if he would become mute again.
Peter was born three months before his due date. He was less than a pound and five inches. And blind with possible deafness. The records end there until a year later where Peter is noted as a healthy, normal baby with near sightedness and asthma. The rest are marked classified, until Peter is under Ben Parker’s care.
baby cousins. I’ll meet the kid and talk to him if he wants. I can’t be called in to babysit or anything,” Wilson finishes his confession.
Peter crawled down the column and surveyed the large room. He then heard voices coming. Peter sprinted the other way in hopes of find his friend and getting home.
They were silent and then Steve did that thing Tony loved. He made a noise, a huff of air, and Tony knew he was smiling. It made Tony smile a little.
Bruce’s heart monitor peaks a bit in the black SUV. He glances at Peter’s red face in the mirror. The boy has not stopped crying. He also chances a look at Agent Coulson. The man agreed to help, but Bruce like with Natasha cannot be sure if he has an ulterior reason. The agent seems too blasé to be stuck in a car in Manhattan with a mutated spider kid and the Hulk. Bruce takes his fire breaths to let it go.
The boy looked up from his drawing and Clint knew he was discovered. The boy then held up a sign that read
Steve balls his fist. No matter, more information is required. For now, an olive branch must be given.
Tony agrees as he checks where Peter is; Pooh-JARVIS and him are playing hide-n-seek while Steve sits at a desk and looks ready to give up all hope.
Steve embraces his husband. He kisses Tony. Kisses like he should have the first time they. Kisses him like he should have when he found Tony alive in the desert with Rhodey. Kisses him like on their wedding day. Kisses him for it just may be the last time he can.
"Yes," and here Steve makes his sacrifice. "Being with you, talking, sharing my village's food, I feel light. That the weight of my past lifted the day I came to your willow."
“We need to talk about Tony,” Bucky begins. That was for later in the plan, but he needs to get a rise out of Steve first. And, sure enough, Bucky is facing the wall, his one arm gripped tightly behind his back and Steve breathing heavily.
“Happy, your wedding's not until June, can’t you ball up and tell my CEO that I’m going without a stupid invite.”
Tony and Steve went all out on the Halloween theme. Pumpkins with spooky-silly faces sat on each table as a centerpiece. The normally white clothes were switched with black ones and the crystal flutes were exchanged for plastic goblets varying in color and design. Steve held one with an old fashioned green witch and her familiar on it flying over the moon on a broomstick. Tony’s was a mummy in pharaoh’s robes.
They did and he went straight to his room and closed the door as his dads told him to do not too long ago.
Strange has led them to a large, ornate office library. An oak desk sits in the middle with a leather chair Steve’s seen in retro-fit stores. A globe stands off to the side with a needle moving it, like a gramophone, and the room is well lit despite only having a fire place.
“Sshh, I’m trying to say that bad people do good things for the wrong reasons. Bucky may seem okay now, but he is not trustworthy.” His dad sniffed and laid Peter on the bed. His eyes were red. “Enough of this grown-up stuff. Go to sleep and dream of the beach.”
The portal to Midgard was always strange. The man, Tony, had said it only could be opened at certain times of their day. It was closed now and Heimdall could not open it without causing a rift in the Bifrost. He prayed that it would open again soon, because young Peter was lost in Odin’s palace.
“I’m afraid to get close to him,” Coulson said. “Like, if I did so, all their fears and disappointments from last year would return. It broke them, sir.”
“no the toaster oven was made in China…..It’s not a freakin’ spy…..damn it, just read the instructions…..No, no, no…..come one man I’m at a wedding……”
Waiting outside the Hall of Science for Happy to arrive, Peter saw Gwen get in a car with a light on it. He waved goodbye to her as they drove pass. Peter stood with his backpack and lunch watching the sky and the clouds form swirls.
Tony huffs and says, “We also discovered some unusual things in him. From what I found, Peter has a replicated version of the super-soldier serum that changed Steve mixed with arachnid DNA.”
"That is..well,uh,...oh I can't. I want nothing  more in this life than to come on the ground and join you!" Anthony yells.
"Well, we may have taken all the cookies and icecream once." She smiled wickedly, like Daddy sometimes. "Or three times."
“I knew HYDRA had a hand in their death. I looked at the files from SHIELD, but there was a lot of data missing. It doesn’t even you are the Winter Soldier. It just says asset something or codename Winter Soldier. Nat and I assumed some of the missions were kept under wraps from less secure bases.”
The toddler bounced in his papa's lap. He liked how Papa made kissy faces. They sat at a picnic in an enclosed grove. Da was taking out the food for them and Peter saw some tarts.
have told us he was coming. We’re gonna let them get reacquainted while you and I go for late night burgers,” Tony finishes and starts down the hall to the garage, where his car keys are and he can leave immediately. He also has a wad of cash hidden in each car, so Steve believes his loved ones will find a hotel for the rest of the night as he takes care of their guest.
“Sorry man. I don’t mean to offend, but me and kids never got along. Hell, my aunts never let me alone with my
Bucky ignores his fighter instincts and relaxes. Eventually, Steve lets go. Bucky looks at him. There is life in that miserable face, but it is muted. Hollow almost.
Peter sat alone in the atrium as the other kids gathered in groups for lunch. He did not mind. This being his second science camp the sting did not hurt so much of being outted. Peter took out his Captain America tin box with his food. Mr. Coulson had given it to him for Christmas.
“—,which means he must be trained in them to learn to control and use wisely. I cannot define exactly what his abilities include, but I do know they will be spiderlike.”
The cooks had a collective shrug and the head chef, Walentyna, came and said, “Lady Sif, there has been no such child to enter these kitchens for weeks. Surely, y—”
Both parents prayed he was not contemplating crawling up there; one chandelier alone would cost Tony an arm and leg. It was early in the afternoon still and the natural light from the bay windows helped with the setting.
Peter does so without protest. He climbs in with his 80’s robot pajamas. Steve tucks him in, but Peter is out.
Captain America dodged incoming bullets as another rogue came barreling toward him. He waited until just in time and threw the man off to the side. Just then, Black Widow chimed in: “I’m proud of moy malen'kiy pauk, but don’t you and Tony think you should wait?”
“I’m normal size for a preemie,” he says. “That’s what my pops told me. And daddy says I’ll grow normal once I hit puberty.”
“I can’t….the thought of people going after him because of what he can’t control…frightens me. If sending him to school with Harry next year will help in any way, then I’d argue with Tony in his Hulk-Buster in Times Square; that almost happened. So, next school year, Peter’s going. We haven’t told him yet, but hopefully our long winter holiday will help break Tony out of his reluctance.”
Peter’s things are grabbed and he is holding out his hand. Mr. Sam takes it and grumbles all the way back, running into Rhodey and his pops.
Peter sniffs and gets down. He holds his right hand out and makes a sign with it. It takes Volstagg a minute to understand. Peter is writing in the air.
He looked in the direction Volstagg ran. “The man is natural with children, I should go and warn Thor and Lady Jane of this.”
Peter follows him, yawning on the way to the cabin. Loki opens it and the boy heads for the small lounge chair. He climbs up and falls fast asleep. Loki sniffs.
Pepper snorts a laugh. “He’s not the “Avengers” kid.” She uses air quotes. “Peter is Tony and Steve’s kid.”
“I saw me…and you…a bunch of crazy shit. I’ve been watching you. Researching. You resurfaced in 1989, two years before the end of the Cold War. You sought out the rest of the Commandoes; most were dead, but some had lived, like that Carter girl, and had kids. Stark lived too, and you met him…his son. It’s seems like stalking at this point, but I had years of espionage to use. From what I gathered, you and Stark Junior were reluctant friends at first. You took a shine to him at some point, him the same, and between the whole kidnapping thing and the Iron Man reveal, you two shacked up. You got married not two months later, and then the perfect fairy tale life, until you realize you’re missing a kid. And I know that from Peter.”
“Whatever comes just remember your pops and I love you. We love you so much,” Tony says. He hugs Peter tight against him. Peter hugs back with the same strength.
The house opens and reveals itself to be a mansion. The men go off with a Dr. Strange. Pepper stays back; it has been a long day. Happy stays back with her as Jane follows them. A man appears and offers the two some oolong tea.
Volstagg straightened and nudged the child to let go. The boy came off him and wiped at his eyes. Thor looked down at Jane who had a worrisome expression.
The boy, unhindered by the stairs, jumps off in perfect landing and runs to him. Steve runs to him and they meet in a crash with Steve’s arms full of Peter. The boy is giggling and nuzzling against his beard.
“Daddy said I’m not allowed to use the oven without him or pops,” Peter responds. No arrogance or anger.
They strutted out of OSCORP, Peter looking up and skipping to the car where Happy had the door open.
“Peter’s a smart kid. Darcy says he’ll be like his daddy when he gets older and rule the world,” Jane says. That gets a tiny smile out of Pepper, but she still has a terrible sense of dread.
The next day, Peter squirmed in his seat as Bruce came up with the cotton swab. Steve was there too, rubbing circles on Peter’s back. Bruce wondered if he was labeled as the “Bad doctor” in the poor boy’s mind.
Bucky orders pizza because apparently people are lazy to get their own food. Although, it helps when most nights he can’t drown out the voices in his head telling him to
"That's not healthy," Peter said, but covered his mouth. His voice got better with time and practice, however he had tended to blurt out the things on his mind. Daddy said he was honest. Pops said he had to be diplomatic in his speech. Daddy smiled and told him he'd help him.
Tony gets up and runs to Peter. He stops as the boy looks up worried. Tony bends down and picks him up, taking him away and whispering insistently. It sounds, “remember, don’t open the door without me or your pops.”
Loki places the fake files on the table, aware of Stark’s aversion to being handed things. The boy looks at him and Loki wonders what secret powers this child holds. No magic is present in the child, for he would feel it, but there is a power there. Loki glances back as Stark begins to sign the endless papers. This spell is simple enough, a distraction for the both of them. The Captain watches entranced also by the pen and papers.
Harry held on in the hug as if it would be the last of Peter. The boy in turn, starting to sniffle a bit. Tony would chuckle at the best friends’ dramatics if Norman Osborn did not loom over them. It may just well be the last time the two saw each other, what with Osborn threatening to steal Harry away if they he and Steve are ever together in front of the boys.
“Duh. He practically planned your side of he wedding. Guy would go stone cold crazy if you said “wanna babysit my kid.”’
“I suppose you are wondering what will happen. Rest assured, child, I do not wish to harm you. Nor do I plan on letting you go. This is not a kidnapping, however crass that word is. You will become my new tool to victory. I will strengthen your power and gain control of his miserable planet.” He stops and looks at the boy. There is no fear and a curious gaze. Loki smiles for an instant. “One day, I may call you brother.”
“No, just stop there Cap. I have a lot of bile to get out at you,” Tony says. He stands and starts pacing. “And by any heavenly body I am going to do it.”
A few hours later, with coffee in hand, Steve has finished a story worthy for Hallmark. Bruce is skeptical, but Tony squashes it with the digitized documents of Peter’s adoption and obituaries.
They follow them because they do not have anything else; Steve looks around the house and is happy Tony does not fight it. They would get lost in here for days.
“Someone shoot me, he actually did it,” said a scathing voice. The room turned to the door to see a man with greying hair and red shades. Next to him was a teenaged girl in a strict corduroy and pinned back hair. She, like the man, had a sour face and each held a bag of candy.
Steve follows wondering how such a delicate woman grasps him hard and the knife feels thin enough to slice his spine. He is corralled to the last tent. It is dark inside with one candle flaring. There is a small round table and sitting at the chair is a man in a scarlet cape with a crystal eye on the table's center.
“Getting rid of a pest,” Tony says. He activates the sensors in his watch and immmediatley the Iron Man armor clings to his body like a second skin. “I won’t kill him, Steve,” Tony sneers. “I’m just gonna rip off his other arm.”
Peter was bored just sitting. Happy nodded to all being said, but even pops could tell nothing went through. Peter looked to Mr. Sam. Mr. Sam was talking to someone on the phone in hushed tones.
) stared at Steve. This man whose voice acted as a balm to his erratic thoughts. Bucky’s nightmares involved snow, a train, and this man. This man who appeared to be a friend in the nightmares. Some dreams happened too; a rusty apartment. Smiles and laughter. Drawings nothing but drawings. Bucky stared at Steve. He attacked.
Loki swallows hard. He can still hear his ersatz father’s name on his tongue. He looks at Peter now; the child has no fear, but great despair. Loki shakes him slightly, not hard, but still there is only that burning sadness. Loki laughs dryly and brings Peter onto the bed. He sits between his legs and holds the boy.
The building is….wrecked. That is what Steve sees in front of him. He looks down at Peter who is staring awed and Steve believes he is missing something. Tony and him share a worried glance then step forward.
"It was ill-planned and improvised. But, Bestla had been the only giant to love me...and I was scared. Ashamed. To everyone, she was a traitor. Even Bor's offer almost got them both killed."
did not show up. She looks at Tony, who is still in his sleepwear and navy robe. The boy, Peter, has not appeared.
“We have reservations at the Capitol Hill.” Tony looks at the Tiffany watch on his wrist. “We should’ve headed there earlier.”
The noise is louder now and Steve says, “Just gonna check on Sam.” He enters the kitchen with a paper stuck to his head that reads “Anna Nicole Smith” and Wilson holds in his laugh.
“I’m aware it’s a bit early and cliché but you can’t wait for scientific intrigue. And the lady at Toys’R’Us said it has the latest kid friendly experiments,” he says smiling shyly.
“Barnes, you asshole. You should be an asshole.” Stark picks up the brief case. Bucky notices it is metal. “I can’t stop Peter from seeing you if I tried. He trusts you. That’s enough for now. But, you can’t ever come back here alone and if you are alone with Steve for a minute I will rip off your other arm.”
Back in the cabin, Loki remains on the floor. Thor comes to him first and holds out manacles that only the dwarves can make.
“Yeah,” Peter says. “My daddy said you were the first supervillain he fought and that you weren’t all that bad. Mostly show-offy.”
Jane manhandled Thor out of the room into the second one and said, “Okay, so this my fault for not telling you sooner, but Fury and Coulson need to be in the dark about anything involving and his powers,” she whispered the last part.
"He's afraid. I've kept him alive for centuries and unharmed. With that axe you not only kill the tree but my attachment to him." Anthony said all this with a deadpan voice as if he was reading a tome.
They continue the journey, Loki unaware of the tiny com on Peter. Unaware of JARVIS sending distress signals to the still enchanted Iron Man and Captain America.
Steve thinks of it as he again attempts to send the e-vites for Peter’s party. Tony was not happy with that bit of information and the two realized they did not know Peter’s birthdate by heart. They do now, October 15th, and Tony has Steve handling all the party details.
“Daddy, pops, this is Bucky. He’s eccentric and his metal arm is amazing. I like him. Can he stay with us, please? He can bunk with me and you and daddy can get out for fondue more,” Peter says. The words are a bit slow coming, but not slurred. His voice does not crack, but it is still misused.
“Never, Pete. You’re the best thing to happen to me since Steve,” Tony says. This is all so sappy, but he is glad for it.
“I know who killed your parents.” Steve turns to Tony. His husband’s mouth hangs open. Tears pool in Tony’s eyes. “And you can’t kill him.”
The boy stares. He tweeds his thumbs and Volstagg takes a closer look at the clothing. It is of Midgard, he realizes. The boy looks up at him.
Later, after coming back, finding Peter nodding off, taking care of night time rituals, Tony had the little lump of cuteness holding to his arc reactor and sound asleep. Steve was propped on one shoulder and he reached out a hand to grab Tony’s hand and squeeze it gently.
“Child, wake up. The clothes you wear are soiled and I believe even mortals do not smell heavy of sweat all the time,” Loki says. He jostles the lounge chair. Peter shoots out alert and stares at Loki.
Wilson finds himself sitting next to Rhodes with Peter next to the lieutenant. His person was chosen by Peter, who is grinning with a missing tooth.
However, he fears what will happen in the morning. Sam had mentioned that Peter should be in school on a Wednesday. Tony said Rhodes was giving him a few worried glances.
I was hoping to have this whole fic finished before Christmas, but I only got these two chapters. I wanted to post them before I get too busy again. Please don't think I am taking another hiatus.
Peter climbed the walls after that knight started yelling. He knew it was silly, but he did not want to hear it. He climbed really high too, and lost his way in the dark. Peter did not fear the dark; he could see in it. He feared monsters. Peter shook at the fact he was lost and his friend was looking for him.
Phil Coulson sat down in front of Director Fury. SHIELD had taken on a more cloak and dagger operation since the HYDRA discovery, but it was still an agency meant for good. That is why even as they both sat in a nondescript student coffee shop out near Columbia University Phil still saw Fury as the director.
Peter gazed at the people running around the suite. Happy was sweating. He had his tux unbuttoned and cummerbund out. Peter sat in the lounge chair across from the groom as his daddy tried to calm the sweaty man.
Fortunately, the rest of the day went quite well. Peter and Rhodes had an intimate discussion of Tony’s beard and even followed with some pictures Rhodes had saved up on his phone.
“No. I mean no one is aware of my current location and some of them believe I am in Kentucky or California. My tracker’s signals will converge soon and they’ll find me, until then I have only 51 minutes and 22 seconds to get you out of bed and reunited with your son.”
“Aye. However, Thor will not be pleased to know one of his Midgardian brethren have lost a child. Thus, I will tonight, ask for an audience after the festivities. And you.” He points to Peter. “Young Peter, must be our guests till then.”
“Thor, I have something uh, um, oh this to discuss with you in the next room. We can go there right?” asked Jane to Tony.
"Thank you," Anthony says. There is a reverence to it. Steve sees the deep want and hope in his Willow Man. For Anthony, this is not just a nice treat. It is an offering of friendship and hope for the future where he is not alone, where others like him will come. Steve sees this all in the man's face and as he takes his first bite jam sticking to his sumptuous lips.
“Call me every day; have your dads read the signs. And don’t forget, I’m gonna bring you back something from our trip to the Caymens and then something cooler from Brazil. And-and we can go to the skate park and see who wins at speeds and if you can do your new trick,” Harry continued in this monologue as Peter nodded to it.
Steve is stone again. Bucky takes out a cigarette. He grabs the lighter still in Steve’s hand and puffs a few times.
The elevator doors ping and Pepper steps out. At this hour, Steve should be in the gym or a run, and Tony’s in bed. She removes her stilettos to walk quietly down the hall. Before entering the “chamber of hot and ready love” as Tony so lovingly proclaimed it, Pepper pauses and glances at the door across the hall. A heavy weight settles in her; how badly these two wanted a child. Pepper sighs and enters.
“I don’t fucking believe this!” Tony yells. The files and videos were open and he demanded JARVIS take them off the screens surrounding him. Steve was pale next to Tony in the workshop.
He steps in, careful to avoid the skateboard. He’s been teaching Peter the basics and it helps that the parks are empty. Steve stands to kiss his husband and then hold him.
The man, Strange if he recalls, tilts his head. "You are in love with a Fae. That is a doomed love unless the Fae forsake their immortality."
“Daddy’s gonna put you down, okay?” Peter nodded. “Good, and then he’s gonna shout at your Unki Brucie ‘til he cries like a b.”
Peter runs to the car where Mr. Happy holds the door open. Peter ducks in and the door shuts. Mr. Happy stares at the kids for a moment and they disperse. Today, Mr. Happy sees them.  Peter shucks off his Superman backpack. He sniffs snot dripping down his nose. Mr. Happy yells at the kids outside of the car with the leader, Ursa, sticking her tongue at Mr. Happy.
“Yeah, I know Arachno-kid. Just wear it for a couple of days and the collar will loosen on its own,” Daddy says.
"I'll lose all my powers and become mortal completely," Anthony said. "The frantic look for a mate won't be needed, I can wait. Not to worry about a fate worse than death."
“Stop! Don’t touch me again. You can have the murderer. But I’d rather die than let you or him!” Tony points to Barnes who stares unblinking. “Near my son.”
“I know it’s a big day and all, but Hap, you can’t be a run-away groom. Trust me, that movie will never be made,” his dad went on in that manner.
His longtime friend and manservant bows his head. Since leaving Kamar-Taj in the wake of the Ancient One’s death, Wong had vowed silence and servitude to him, but for the man he had not taken to strangers well. It seems the meeting with Peter had broken some of the wall Wong had built around him. Stephen places a hand on Wong.
A normal life? Who wants that? Steve returns to his computer and sighs. The email still has not sent.
"Wrong, soldier. Thor whined at the size of Loki who was no taller than him. An inch or two shorter to be fair. Loki, angered and insulted, lashed out with not weapon but a quick tongue. And then, a dagger. The two sparred verbally for hours until the snowfall stopped. It was at this juncture Loki told Thor the harrowing news: there were no frost giants. At least not the big ones. He was to be the last true giant since all the others turned mortal. Thor scoffed at this. Said it was preposterous; Loki simply said it was Thor's great grandfather who started that when he stripped the giantess Bestla of her horns and made her his wife. You can imagine, Thor was flabbergasted. However, the stories add up. Bor went into the mountains and returned weeks later with the horns of a frost giant and a rather tall maiden whom he married upon his return."
Strange stands there and hums. He is not mad or surprised at Tony’s outburst and he seemed to expect Tony’s short temper.
If I ever mentioned anything different about their wedding, please tell me. I reread this one and the first one, but I could have missed something. Please and thank you.
Lost in his drawings, the shadow watching over Peter did not faze him; for Peter’s spidey-sense (as daddy trademarked it) did not ring out. He did notice something there, but it gave no move as to get near him. Peter did not ponder long on this because the next thing he saw was Mr. Sam jogging to him.
“Parker, right?” she says. When Peter does not speak, she smiles wide. It is like the Cheshire cat. “Puny Parker,” she whispers. “Puny Parker,” she says louder. “Puny Parker!” she screams.
Their friends do notice they are happier. Tony thinks it is because they believe he and Steve have gotten over their “mourning period.”
The two stop outside the door. Steve inhales softly, hearing Peter’s full voice. Tony, he knows, shakes behind him.
The two men sit opposite on the giant sofa. The plush of the cushions sink in under Steve’s weight. He glances at Tony who rocks back and forth in rhythm with his tapping foot.
He can see the parents: an older man who is flustered and scared and a younger woman who has great sadness in her eyes. The man is carrying Peter and gently places him on the doorstep. The woman kneels and begins to kiss Peter on his head.
Tony, who’s usually composed and suave, is now rumpled and anxiety is clear on his face. Pepper stands, fists clenched and waits again.
The three of them spend the rest of the day exploring Capitol Hill and the tourist traps. Peter loving every moment of it as he calls for ‘Pops’ or ‘Dad’ every time the boy saw something exciting.
Happy rushes onto the dance floor where Thor and Jane do a dangerous rendition of the Chicken Dance.
“I hear my dads talking about them, Aunt Nat too. They sound bad. And I think they did a lot of bad stuff. So, if you know my pops and something bad happened to you, it means HYDRA did something. Or the new villains, AIM. They attacked us back in spring, but it wasn’t so bad. Daddy found them quick and he with Rhodey saved the day. And if it wasn’t HYDRA than you gotta tell my dads so they can find them and save the day. They said they’ve been saving people who have evil stuff done to them, like experiments, and rescue them from HYDRA and others—”
“Peter,” Steve says. “Go with your daddy. I need to talk to these two. Later, we have some stuff to talk about.”
He looked around the room and saw the eyepatch glaring at him. Norman gave him a fake smile and returned to watching the kids.
Soon his Willow Man will not have to settle for this small reprieve. Steve has won his first battle.
Bruce was informed on all pertinent details and cringes at what he recalls. The silence lapses when JARVIS, in Pooh’s voice yells,
“-hic-my parents are gone, -hic-but Aunt May and Uncle Ben took care of me. Until Uncle Ben died-hic-Aunt May was really unhappy. I miss-hic- them, but my dads are good. I don’t ever feel scared around –hic-them or Uncle Bruce, even though he pokes me with needles,” Peter hiccups. “Sorry.”
“You shouldn’t say those things,” Tony says. “That’s not right for you to do that. You’re supposed to be the good one.” He grabs a fist full of Steve’s shirt.
I'll be honest and say I know nothing of Dr. Strange but what Wikipedia tells me. So, just imagine him as any version you want, however, I do think of him as like a Vincent Price character, like in "The Raven", which I reference. So, hopefully I got the characterization, his powers, and magical things correct and that he sounds like he should in the comics.
“Oh God,” she says. Pepper grabs at the papers and throws them on the floor and takes the pen out of Tony’s hand. It is to no avail as he and Steve follow the paper. Tony begins signing his name on the scattered papers.
Sif walked for a bit, until she felt eyes on her. They were above her. With practice and ease, Sif jumped up and brought her rapier forth—
They go, Pepper a bit giddy. She has never been able to get out of her old grandmother’s marriage speech since she was nine. The giddiness fades upon seeing the deep concentration Tony and Steve have on blank pages. Tony keeps signing his name and skipping to another page.
“Yes,” Tony says, tightly. “I believe all that was obvious. Also, we’re talking who made the sickest rock musicals, it was Queen’s
Peter nodded. He hoped his dads were not worried. Aunt May was always worried and Peter did not want his dads to be like that; Peter did not want to be alone.
The door’s open and a light is on; Steve readies his stance as the familiar heat of Tony’s repulsor is felt from behind.
“Peter,” he says. He stops and breathes. “We’re not mad. Your pops and I just don’t like when you go off. But….Sam was with you and someone knew where you were. If Sam,” he points. Steve squeezes a bit in the headlock. “Hadn’t taken out your GPS, then we could have found you earlier.”
On his tenth visit, Steve sat up with Anthony in the tree's shade. It truly was a magnificent willow. Steve would feel shame when it had to die for his love to come home.
Peter is quiet for the rest of the walk. They reach the dean’s office. A woman greets them and tells them to sit in the bench. She tries to hand Daddy something. Peter holds out his small hands.
Anthony fidgeted. He had been doing so all day. His warrior had yet to come again. Last Anthony saw of Steve, the man was distracted. Anthony talked for the most part about the discoveries he made in the last decade. Mostly of the stars and how they have changed. Not impressive, but he did grab Steve's attention.
“You don’t have to. You owe me nothing for this. I should’ve come up with a better plan to tell you. I should’ve talked to you more. I hurt you, Tony.”
“All I’m saying is that Peter can handle his own, with Nat as his teacher, and that JARVIS had him if Loki did not notice the device. All I’m saying is that Peter was not scared and his spidey-sense did not go off.”
He sighs and gets out another juice box. Wilson realizes the alcohol and sodas are stashed behind the bar where Peter cannot get to them. He sips the apple-mango and plays
Bucky stared the door down. Never in his brainwashed career would a door be such a threat. Behind this one…Steve was on his bed possibly unbathed and unshaven. Bucky had taken on troops of soldiers and special ops. He had shot men and women unseen from incredibly hidden vantage points. So, it should be easy to knock on this door and force his old friend to get off the man’s ass.
Tony knows this is something SHIELD or whatever they call themselves would want to know (probably already have a file) and he shows it to Steve.
Hiding Peter was not intentional; in fact the decision was never vocalized. However, it became a necessary after Tony finally got Peter’s medical records and found some oddities.
Fury observed as it brought him closer to Peter. Coulson placed the gift down and returned promptly.
“Do not fear, young one. Am I Volstagg, the Bear of Asgard, and one of the Warriors Three, protégé of the Mighty Thor. And you, young child?”
Loki will admit that he has been waiting for the fear, even ambivalence, but Peter has been calm, almost as if he is with someone he trusts.
Bucky turns his head as Sam makes a “well” gesture. Bucky closes his eyes and breathes. He needs to think of nothing. Nothing in his head except the mission. He knocks.
“I know we’re behind a few days,” he says to the woman, “but can we hurry up. I gotta get this little guy to Mrs. Sellers class.”
The two scientist read through the notes and coded words of one Arthur Parker, everything there, including photos of Peter as an infant. The data is incredible and not much is left to discover besides how Parker got his hands on an unfinished vial of the serum.
Bucky again looks defeated. “Where else can I go? I wanted to find you. I don’t remember anything….you-you’re familiar somehow and I-I need that, God dammit, I…I’m fucking lost.”
"It would make me a fine chair or table from this sturdy stuff," he mutters. Steve feels the wood. It grates against his hard hand and suddenly joy comes to him. He has not felt this in ages.
Tony squeezes Peter tight in his arms. It does not bother Peter. Tony stinks from lack of hygiene and Peter’s sobbing all over with snot coming out. He does not care. Coulson left with a curt nod to Bruce who stays watching them.
They get in the car, where Happy smiles at them. They drive and on the way Happy pulls down the partition. He looks back at them and hands Tony a small box.
“I apologize. What I mean to say is that perhaps Peter’s parents had given him similar instructions as a last request. Most children would not withstand weekly injections from premature birth to when they ended. This is not guarantee, but a theory. I must speak to Peter and ascertain what has been done. This will take some time and I will need your explicit consent.”
"I am happy. I've been alone for ages and the animals are fine company but not too keen on conversation nor the discovery of new flora," he said. "Most days I wished I had chosen a different path. A tree is so sturdy and unmoving." He stopped and squeezed his hand on Steve's shoulder. Steve placed his over the smooth skin. "I hate it. I hate that I'm bound to this. That I can't leave without fear of...you know...and that I don't know where any of my kin are. I had so many friends. Virginia who would follow the growth of red toadstools, James who was a will-o-wisp and flew around to tell me stories. Bruce, oh dear Bruce. He was the only other who understood the cycle of life and its many distinctions. He was a moss man."
Above him, within the tree, a man lies among one of the branches. He is beauty incarnate. Soft raven locks with a small sparrow beard. Ruby red lips and tender brown eyes. Flawless ivory skin with pink nipples. The man's supple legs are folded but Steve can make out a small patch of hair below the abdomen where the man's sex will be.
His dad looked confused for a second. He turned to Peter and his eyes widened. Peter did not know why his dad still looked at him like that.
Thor shifts first. "I know it may sound odd and a bit far fetched, but what the wizard said is true. My lovely Loki is a former giant."
Steve should not be here. He knows he is pushing for more when he and Tony have a lot of damage to repair. But, he’s always been that way. Pushing the boundaries and hoping for the best. The jet has landed and as the stairs are propped to the door, Steve stands at rest.
Pepper attempts to coax Steve, but he is seemingly transfixed by what Tony is doing. She finally notices that the papers have begun to pile up on the floor.
The next couple of guests were Bruce, Jane and Thor plus entourage, and Clint, who said he did not need an invite because he would just follow Bruce.
I never wrote about their love life and how they got together. I figured it might be a good intermission before more heavy stuff.  Reminder: I don't do smut.
The scene falls to Peter and Loki on the floor, shocked. Peter recovers first and runs to Hulk. He jumps into the giant’s arms and says everything is okay. Next is Steve who removes his cowl and almost wails at finding Peter unscathed.
“We’ll find him,” Happy says. “Whatever that Loki guy’s done, he’ll know soon enough not to shit with the Avengers’ kid.”
“Bruce, hide it! Throw it away. Do something,” the man said, as Peter’s screams turned to body wracking sobs.
Tony does not go to them. Instead, he gestures Steve to follow him to the master bedroom. He still holds Peter in his arms who has fallen asleep.
Peter shuffled on his feet. The smile Mr. Coulson gave Peter was the one his dad told him to be wary of; it was tight and his brow was furrowed. Peter gripped his lunch tin. Mr. Coulson stepped out of the car and kneeled down to Peter's height.
Steve tenses. He calms as tires screech outside. The man of his former friend sags. He seems so old when in truth both of them have barely aged in decades.
The portal to Midgard opened to Heimdall’s relief…until one Captain America burst through and asked, “Where’s my son?”
has to go to, she’s still up earlier than she wants to be and holding Tony’s favorite Starbucks crap.
“You left, even though pops didn’t want you to and it was for my daddy because he doesn’t like you.” Peter said this with a straight face and old eyes. “And you’re trying to make me feel better. At least, that’s what Sam said you were supposed to do.”
Pepper yawned. It was barely eight and she had a meeting Tony needed to get to; she huffed. He gave her the power after getting married, and yet for the board meeting
Sam’s not a fan of Barnes in fact he would rather through this guy on his ass then pity him. No amount of brainwash can excuse half the shit this man pulled when he was the Winter Soldier. Sam may not get the same intel as Steve, but he knows the rumors. However, for the sake of his friend and for that kid…he hopes Banner’s plan works.
Pepper never shows up. Steve squeezes Tony’s hand as they sit down to eat. The menus contain three items on each list. Steve knows Peter and Harry Osborn will order everything. Steve leans over and whispers in Tony’s ear, “Peter’s made a friend.”
"I've not heard of you or your ilk. Perhaps, some of the travelers who come through my village may have. They're the ones who tell stories of the Fae." The man stares in hope, breath elevated. A little nudge in the right direction. "There aren't' any travelers today. If you come with me and wait a few days they'll be more in a few days time." Though, Steve leaves out the fact that the war ravaged roads have stilled travelers. They will not be fixed for months.
“Dr. Bruce Banner called me the other day. Told me this ridiculous plan to get at least one of our ‘leaders,’” he air quotes, “out of his slump. I didn’t go along with it at first, but I got another call from Rhodes today. He says their side worked.”
I've returned. This chapter was meant as one, but I realized it would have been better as a two parter because it was getting to be over five thousand in the first draft.
Natasha hums. She rummages in the drawers of the large kitchen, passing by Bruce, who awakens from his diligent reading. Peter steps closer to poke him in the ribs.
The boy lets go and runs to his parents. Stark kneels on the ground to catch Peter. Bucky feels the sting evaporate completely. This was worth it. Coming back from the dead to see this. He has his new life ahead of him now and a new purpose to find. Bucky feels a smile on his face.
“Quit smiling. I plan to see if he’s an asset before anything else. Send Romanov to test him and don’t let her slide it to Rogers like she did with our sorcerer informant,” Fury says. He gets up and leaves the shop. “I’ll be seeing you, Coulson.”
“We’re here as civilians, Coulson, and I can’t help but see every vantage point a sniper or kidnapper could take,” he said.
Peter is sitting up in bed, a smile on his face, and standing on the side of the door is Bucky. Peter squeals and runs to his dads.
“That is too simple of a notion, child. I have taken you from your home and your fathers will not find you. I plan to make you one of my soldiers and to seek others similar to you.”
Peter watched his dad mutter between pacing in the hotel bedroom. His dad had a worried look, which frightened Peter a bit. Dad was never really worried, unless there was a crisis, like when those men tried to take Peter and Uncle Bruce turned into the Green Man. Peter bit his lip. That experience was not as scary because the Green Man had been nice to him and his dad, whose leg was broken. The Green Man helped them and smiled at Peter. Later, Uncle Bruce had been ashamed, but Peter told him he liked the Green Man.
Bucky sways on the hammock. The weather’s getting to be chilly outside with fall in full swing for now though the midday is warm enough for an old man lie down in the breeze. He opens his eyes to the slightest sound. Bucky bolts up. Standing a few feet away is Stark. Behind Stark is Steve.
“Nice try. Peter said his aunt gave him to you two,” Jane snorted. She held out several papers with Peter’s signs.
Stephen reentered his parlor-one of them-to find Wong staring wistfully out the window. Being sorcerers, it became tedious to keep track of time in one plane and though it only felt like months to Stephen, he knew it had been two years since that Peter boy had come. Thus, Wong’s wistful look.
Steve does not make any movement. He glances quickly at the gloved hand, knowing it has the metal appendage which almost killed him and his friends.
“Yep. Oskid’s gonna miss his little buddy and Peter’s got JARVIS on his phone for reading his signs.”
That is where JARVIS welcomes James Rhodes and Sam Wilson into the building on a brisk first day of November. Master Tony smiles tightly because he did not have information until this morning and Steve has just returned from a run. Peter holds up his sign to welcome the new guests as Dr. Banner and Barton chuckle quietly from the couch.
When Sam had arrived with the small boy Bucky almost sent him back. However, seeing Peter’s worried face (such old eyes) he knew he had to help. Drawing used to ease Steve into spilling his guts…unlike the others Bucky in—
Peter nods. He wipes his wet hands on his uniform pants. So far, school is terrible and he hates it, but pops wanted him to go and daddy agreed when they returned home. Peter bites his lip. Pops has not been back in weeks. Daddy’s always in the tower now. Peter looks at Mr. Happy.
“I will allow it and you must promise not to interfere. Otherwise, I cannot be sure of the results.”
“She says my dads aren’t supposed to have a kid. She says they’ll get divorced like her moms did and that daddy’ll marry a girl like her mom married a boy,” he stops. He thinks of how Ursa only smiles when she taunts him. “And…is that going to happen to me. Do I have to be a bully too when dads are divorced?”
The man closed the door and came out again to Bucky’s relief dressed fully. And shining as Captain America did.
Sam peaked down at the small helmet head tucked in his chest. He knew Tony was going to kill him (and Bucky, maybe Steve), but the kid needed to talk to someone. Sam was not that someone. He flew faster, hoping Rhodes kept his end of the bargain to keep the skies scarce.
Tony’s been in the lab when he is not up here and he barely lets Bruce close to him. Honestly, Bruce has little idea of what is going with Tony than Pepper who’s only been close enough to tell the genius he stinks. Bruce knows why now, and then the shards of alcohol. The bar is empty as Bruce timidly walks closer with Peter clutching him along with the stuffed toys.
“Ah,” Fandral exclaimed. “Volstagg would be finished with supper and on his way there,” he muttered.
They had Pooh-JARVIS  watching Peter and Tony wanted to run up there and tell his son that nothing would ever hurt him again.
“What the hell is going through your head? Bucky, this is Tony’s family. His mother. You killed her under control of HYDRA, but Tony won’t give a shit. He’ll come after you unless you leave now and never come back,” Steve says.
“I can’t get Peter to eat a lot. I’ve been making him small meals, like these, and the others don’t cook much either.”
“My theory about a traumatizing experience was correct, but it goes back further. Peter has never spoken once—”
A honk alerted Peter to Happy--It was not his daddy's car. The door opened to reveal Mr. Coulson and another man in all black with the SHIELD logo.
“Anyone else, but Bucky, Tony. I would do everything to ensure you had some peace at night. That I could take this one ghost from you,” Steve says.
The boy twirls the roll in his hands and shuffles nervously. He looks both ways in the kitchen exits and up to the ceiling. Peter motions for Bruce and Natasha to come closer.
By the end, Pepper is calmer. The meeting has started and they are both late. The board will not question or accuse if
Pops looks at him. He smiles but it is not a real one. Peter takes a big bite from his hot dog and almost chokes.
“Mr. Stark-Rogers,” Strange begins. “I am neither a con man nor an agent of SHIELD. I also have no real affiliations with government or ulterior organizations. Simply, I am a man with talents that have ensured the safety of this world and others.” He pauses. “I also have a doctorate in neurosurgery from Sinai and am still licensed.”
“From what I can gather, Dr. Parker was able to get the notebook of Dr. Erskine, from a private vault. And he took all the spiders because they did not have any adverse effects. The lizards,” Bruce says, putting his glasses in place. “That strand of DNA could have mutated the subject further, making the cells exactly like that of a reptile.”
“With powers. Some which are still coming; did you see how much pressure he handled when the weights fell. And his healing factor’s up to par with mine.”
Bucky’s eyebrows shot into his hairline. He was not in the game today; he did not notice that Peter had finished the still-life and started another paper.
She stopped and shrieked upon seeing a small boy hanging upside down from the column. Sif sat frozen, her bottom had hit the floor, staring up at the small boy clinging on the column. From what Sif could see, there were no ropes holding him there. The boy crawled (CRAWLED!) down the column.
During this, Peter had left his playmates and stood in front of the two. He held up his signs that introduced him and Pym grinned good-naturedly. Hope nodded and handed the bags to Peter.
“Yeah,” Bruce says. “We’ll have to find him a new one, but for now I think its best he’s tutored by me and JARVIS. And there’s more, but it can wait.”
Peter smiles nervously. Volstagg understands, the boy wishes to return, but only Thor is allowed through the portal unless given permission by one Leader Fury.
Captain America’s eyes widened within his cowl and he sprinted to Thor at the end of the gate. Heimdall breathed easy again.
“I apologize Mr. Stark, but….Harry Osborn is no longer a student of ours. I know because I did his transfer script. And Mrs. Sellers retired when she got her Winnebago.”
“Well, that for most cases, but you’re cute. The cutest little boy I’ve ever met,” Bucky teases, a remnant not stolen from HYDRA.
Peter has little time before he is told to bring the rings. He searches again, but the man in shadows is gone.
"Yes, I do." He leans forward a self-satisfied look on his face. "Permit me to tell you a story. There was a family so revered in their status that no wrong could be seen with them. That is until their eldest daughter, Hela, tried to rule the land with an iron blade. She was defeated by a Valkyrie and hung. But the blame went to her father, Odin, who was cast out with his second young wife bearing a child. The child was named Thor. Years later, Thor attempted to reclaim his family's honor. It had been his great grandfather Bor who killed the first frost giant with a hammer made from dwarf metal. That was where the family legacy began. Thor, idiot he was, thought if he could kill one giant then the deeds of his elder sister would be forgotten."
Loki should scream, should throw him across the room, should burn this cabin and the boy in it, should gut him and lay him on his fathers’ tower.
“I see them too. I see them and I want to rip the world apart. I saw them when you became Iron Man.”
