Steve laughed, his smile widening while his eyes crinkled at the corners. Tony smiled back, his chest filling with a kind of warmth that he couldn’t quite place. For the briefest a moment, he worried something was wrong with the Arc Reactor again.

.” Tony leaned forward, sliding the folder closer, and then he flipped the parchment over to reveal the neat scrawl on the back of the drawn portrait of him. After nearly a handful of centuries, it was easy for him to recognize Steve’s handwriting. His eyes flickered back up to catch Steve’s gaze, who was standing there mortified.
“You know how, uh, Bucky, he fell and I—” Steve cleared his throat, tongue darting out to wet his lips “—well, didn’t. Catch him. It’s been sort of… Sometimes it’s a lot harder to cope with it, which is unfair to
They very nearly fell into their room in their haste to get inside, arms winding around each other and fingers twisting into each other’s hair and lips slotting together as if they were pieces of a puzzle. And that’s what they were, really, fragments of a jigsaw with all jagged edges that somehow aligned perfectly together.
Tony only shrugged, hiding a grimace as Hammer’s words floated back in their direction: “See, Thor, Tony and I… we are more similar than you think. Brothers in arms dealing… bosom buddies, dare I say, intimate friends…”
“I said, okay!”

Tony fell onto the mat in the boxing ring with a loud
“I’m fine,” he said, trying to reassure Steve, reaching up to smooth the worry out of his brows. “I promise, I’m fine.”

Tony sniffed and opened his mouth to reply, but their wedding officiant cleared his throat loudly, pointedly, mouth pursed like he’d just bitten straight into a lemon. “
Hammer’s face lit up, and Tony immediately wanted to strangle the guy. “Oh, me and Tony? We go way back! Two peas in a pod! Titans of industry! Men of vision!”

Above all, Steve genuinely loved the way Tony fell apart around him, opening up so sweetly in bed. There were nights where the sex was fast and rough and carnal, but tonight, it was slow and languid and sensual. Tony was expressive in more ways than one, and Steve discovered a satisfying delight in listening to every sound and watching every facial expression that he made. Steve enjoyed pulling Tony apart, before piecing him back together; slowly, methodically, and then all at once.
“I’m not done with you, mister!” Tony called after him. He set down his coffee before running after Steve.
“Sir, yes, sir,” Steve teased, detaching himself from Tony and giving a half-hearted salute. Tony leaned forward to smack Steve’s ass as he retreated, giggling to himself as they both bolted in a run to their bedroom.
Hammer rolled his eyes, waving a hand as he hopped over the sectional couch and planted his butt onto one of the cushions. “Eh, well, Banner over there sort of broke Harlem and
“Steve…”
“I know we’ve had our squabbles in the past, with the StarkExpo and all. No hard feelings, though. Water under the bridge, am I right?”

Sheepishly, Steve picked up his mug of coffee, taking a long sip. “Yeah, what a mystery,” he said casually. “Whoever did that definitely wasn’t functioning on two hours of sleep this morning.”
Steve pulled away with a smack, looking Tony directly in the eyes as he said in a firm tone, “Shut up.”
They didn’t sleep in the same bed that night. Or the next. It wasn’t until the third night when Tony asked Steve if he was coming to bed that they’d even been within the same space.

Back on the field, one of the visiting team’s players came up behind Morgan and shoved her to the ground forcefully. Steve and Tony both shot up to their feet, watching to see if their daughter would roll to stand. She sat up in the dirt, patches of fresh mud staining her uniform after skidding, but after a shake of the head and a hand from one of her teammates, Morgan was back up and running down the field again.
Tony didn’t hesitate; he all but fell into Steve’s embrace and tucked his head underneath Steve’s chin. “I’m sorry for waking you,” he muttered quietly, breath hot against Steve’s skin.

His bottom lip started to quiver as the tears sprung to his eyes. “You almost died, and I wouldn’t have…” Voice wrought with emotion, he managed a weak, “I couldn’t protect you, just like I couldn’t protect Bucky.”

of everything. Every laugh, every kiss, every song sung off-key in the shower, every lazy-morning cuddle in bed, every near-death injury on missions, every slammed door, every heated argument – every memory, both good and bad. Tony loved Steve, and Steve loved him too. Win or lose, they would always do that together, and sometimes that was enough.
“Do I even need to ask?” Steve inquired breathlessly, his eyes shining with tears.
“You’ve been staring at Steve for – I’m not even joking – twelve minutes straight.”

Steve’s grin was so wide by the time the Avengers finished singing in mismatched harmonies that Tony thought his cheeks were going to burst. (After everything that went down in Sokovia, and Bruce going AWOL, it was a welcome change of mood in the New Avengers Facility.) His boyfriend shook his head in amusement, looking down at the round red-white-and-blue cake that resembled the iconic Captain America shield, and blew out the ‘97’ on top of it.

Tony grabbed Steve’s face between his hands. They looked at each other for a few heartbeats, sharing a silent conversation. He was warm, alive, breathing right in front of him. He was safe, safer now with Steve beside him.
“Yeah, been there. Got boring.”
So, Steve is tripping over everything and nothing as they walk over the grounds, with a hole in his heart the shape of Tony Stark.

“No promises!” Tony shouted over his shoulder. He threw a smirk in his boyfriend’s direction, catching the subtle shake of his head.
“What? The kid’s hilarious.”
Steve leaned his forehead against Tony’s, with tears collecting at the corners of his eyes. “I love you, too.”

Tony shushed him quietly, kissing away the tears at the corners of Steve’s eyes and cheeks. He caught himself, barely, when Steve’s knees buckled, landing roughly on the ground as he continued to cry. Tony sat on the step with Steve between his legs, holding him to his chest as he pressed a kiss to his hair. As hard as he tried, Tony couldn’t help the hot tears that burned the back of his eyes either.

for him when he was in Tony’s body. He understood why Tony would disappear for hours on end in his workshop because the passage of time felt like a blink of an eye. He understood why Tony would leave empty mugs and half-eaten snacks behind or find rotting food in the produce drawers because his object permanence was shit. He understood why Tony would politely decline team movie nights and dinners sometimes because Steve noticed his social battery draining so much quicker.
Tony had been gone for a whole month promoting some new StarkTech in Oslo and Seoul and Singapore, and Steve and Morgan had spent those four weeks on near-daily trips to Central Park and nightly calls with Tony before she went to bed. As nice as it was to have Morgan all to himself, they both missed the third side of their family triangle to no end.
“Don’t make me fight you, Mr. Rogers-Stark.” Tony adjusted his stance, wrapping his arms tightly around Steve’s waist and pulling his head back slightly in order to get a good look at his husband. Their eyes met, ocean blues to honey browns, and Tony’s broad grin matched Steve’s own.
~*~*~*~
Steve was leaning against the rails of the staircase, two flights down. He had his head in his hands, shoulders visibly tense. Tony stopped a few steps up from him, clearing his throat to signal his presence. Shoving his hands into his pockets, he started, “I… I can leave you alone if you want, really, but I just want to make sure you were alright.”
“I’ll call you when we land,” Steve had promised once, pressing a chaste kiss to Tony’s lips before boarding the Quinjet. Tony stayed out on the platform to watch them take off.
Tony hummed to himself, mouth twisting in the way it did when he tried to hide a smirk. Steve followed his movements, watching as he stepped forward and raised a hand. He couldn’t help himself from leaning into Tony’s touch when he carded his fingers through his hair. Teasingly, Tony joked, “Makes me feel like I’m cheating on you, or doing something illegal.” His fingers trailed down Steve’s cheek until Tony was able to hold his chin, scratching lightly at the beard. “Or both. I like both.”
“What? No, I’m not.” Tony grazed the corners of his mouth with the pad of his thumb, just in case. In response to the muted snicker beside him, he snapped under his breath, “Fuck you, Barton.”
Steve squirmed under the scrutiny. He let out a long breath before plopping into the grass beside Sam, scrubbing at his face. “Don’t laugh at me,” he pleaded lightly.
Steve felt heat creep up his neck, embarrassed. “No, it’s not that… Are you sure it’s safe to be going out in the middle of this pan-Demi Lovato?” Tony gave Steve an incredulous look, so he continued: “Panorama? Pandemonium? Panda sanctuary? C’mon, aren’t you sick of hearing the word ‘pandemic’ all the damn time?”
Steve’s mouth went dry as he tried to rest a hand on the other man’s arm. “Tony, it’s not that easy to –”

The waiter had come by twice already to refill his glass of water, asking if he was ready to order. Steve had looked around the restaurant one more time before sighing and choosing a random appetizer on the incredibly fancy menu – which, in his opinion, was greatly lacking photos. If he shrunk further down into his seat afterwards, that was nobody’s business.
There better not be explicit shit happening in my zoom room. I got my eye on you.

All over social media, people continue to share yearbook photos of Storm and Prince Peter, who had once attended the same elementary school in New York, Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters, when Duchess Mary had for a short time resided in the state prior to her untimely passing.
Ever since Steve had agreed to live with him, the days-long benders Tony spent down in his workshop had lessened significantly, replaced with a healthier routine of falling asleep beside his boyfriend in a more respectable time. However, the recent weeks of Steve closing himself off, avoiding quality time with the rest of the Avengers, and hardly looking in Tony’s direction was... It made Tony worry. Made him second-guess himself. Planted those seeds of doubt in his head.

Find attached the appropriate zip file. So sorry about the mix-up. Late night.
So, Steve figured he’d do something about it. It was the reason how Tony found himself sitting on his knees, kneeling on the floor of his private elevator. Steve stood over him, eyes so dark with his own lust that they resembled obsidian pools, and the only thought swimming through Tony’s cloudy mind was that he wanted to
Very funny, Hill

“Just, you’re never late for a run. Thought it was a weird is all.” Sam continued to look up at Steve, who looked right back at him and hoped for all it was worth that Sam wouldn’t read into the silence.
Tony shrugged noncommittally. “I dunno. Why’d you spend almost a month bothering the exhibit curator at MoMA for a dumb letter?”
Hey, wanna grab lunch at the Triskelion when class finishes? I can scoop you
Tony had both hands splayed out flat on the kitchen counter as he leaned forward, staring blankly at the straining dark liquid that gave him life. He was half-awake, teetering on the edge of exhaustion with a maddening headache pounding through his brain. R&D project deadlines had crept up on him and DUM-E had sprayed him with a fire extinguisher when he’d nodded off and accidentally set one of the circuit boards on fire at three in the morning. At this point, his sole personality trait was crankiness.
“Deal. Next time there’s a threat of a giant purple people-eater, I’ll drag you with me.” Tony kissed Steve back just as fiercely, wincing when he shifted on his feet. He grasped at Steve’s arms, leaning his weight against his husband. He groaned, “Maybe just — yeah, let’s… medical?”
In his defense, even if things felt out of place, nothing felt
Tony fell hard for the blond in that first year they were together.

“Holy
He’d decided on his order some twenty minutes ago, but he continued to peruse the menu in his hands because he felt awkward sitting alone at the table. Of course, he knew that Tony was late to things all the time – board meetings, tech conventions, and public hearings in front of the Senate, to name a few – but he’d never been late to meet Steve on a date before. A date that
“No, Papa.” Morgan’s little fingers tightened in Steve’s hair as she stretched upwards, rocking forward as she sat on his broad shoulders. He winced, hissing out a complaint as his four-year-old daughter tugged even harder at his hair for leverage. “Oh, oh! I think — oh, no. That’s not Daddy.”
“No. Never with this. I’m serious.” Tony looked up at Steve, smiling encouragingly. “I know you have your qualms about passing on your old illnesses and are still scared about how the serum would affect everything, but… yeah. Yeah, I want to have a mini version of us running circles around the living room. I want messy birthday cakes and sneaking around on Christmas morning planting gifts and driving the kid around in a soccer mom van for practice across town — but I swear to God, Steve, if you make me buy a gross van, I’ll vomit—”
“What’s he doing?” Steve whispered, leaning closer to Tony. “There’s nothing out there.”
Tony had it all planned out: a nice dinner out, a stroll through the park to get to their favorite gelato place, and then he’d pop the question. Easy. Except the weather had turned sour on them on a flip of the dime, and their walk through the park turned into sprinting in the rain to find some shelter from the heavy downpour. They found themselves under an awning outside of a closed shop, laughing to themselves as they shook off what they could of the rain.
“Coming! Ha. Sorry, sweetheart, maybe later.”
Peggy giggled into her cup of tea, the corners of her eyes creasing with a smile. She took a sip before replacing the cup on the small coffee table between them, tugging the thick knit blanket on her lap closer.
“I love you more,” Steve teased, kissing Tony on the nose and lips in succession.

The taste of coconut and dark chocolate lingered on Tony’s tongue.

“Now, Tony.”
Steve’s hips stuttered when Tony clenched around his length, back arching off the bed with hands grasping at Steve’s shoulders. Dipping his head down, Steve captured Tony in a kiss, biting his lips red and licking into his mouth as the waves of pleasure crested. They stayed together in a tight embrace, Steve continuing to fuck into Tony with slow, shallow thrusts, exchanging kisses until their lungs were filled with the smell of each other.
It was surprisingly dark in the room, the only source of light coming from the movie being projected onto the wall in front of him. Tony’s eyes took a moment to adjust to the darkness, registering the silhouettes of about six other museumgoers before finding Steve sitting at the very back, face illuminated slightly.
It was one week before Rocket the Raccoon was able to get in contact again with his team, one week before Steve had confirmation that Tony and Peter and that wizard doctor were still alive. When a new spaceship broke into Earth’s atmosphere, confirmed friendlies this time, Steve felt like flying — and that’s practically what he did once Rocket’s friends touched down outside of the Avengers compound. Strange and a handful of what Steve assumed were Rocket and Groot’s teammates exited the ship, none the worse for wear.
Tony broke out in a hearty laugh, throwing out a hand to grab one of Steve’s arms. He doubled over, snickering into his other hand. “I love you, man.”

Suddenly, Steve’s hand was at the nape of his neck. Tony’s brain abruptly short-circuited when Steve kissed him.

“How old were you two when you met?” Peter asked with a soft, inquisitive smile.
“Bye kids see you” Phil said giving each boy a hug
"Let's play with your brother, Sweetheart." said Steve encouragingly.
“Yeah I understand at least Peter already knows him that makes things a little bit better” Steve smile “Still Thank you for coming I hope we can do this in other occasion. Bucky please apologize an said goodbye it’s been a long 30 minutes”
“We are gonna stay here for a while” phil said
-Here steve take this one- said Bruce giving him some Tylenol to Steve
-that sound lien a good idea. Bruce would you help me asking Thor?- Steve ask
“Yes And im sorry i was so focus on the food” Thro sight
Bucky was about to ask him to shut again but at that moment the lights decide to turn on and Steve silhouette with messy blond hair, pijamas and sleepy face appears in the kitchen door.
"What happened here?" Steve asked, patting Bucky's head.
“Why don’t we let them play a little so when the others arrive they can get along more easier” Steve suggest. Anne and Dan nodded in agreement.
"Yeah, I see Baby. A cute duck." Tony just giggled and continued playing, splashing it in the water.
“Oh course baby, all the toys you want”
Steve signs
“Can I come in?”
The family of three ate their dinner in peace for the rest of the day.
-No. are you mad at me- Tony ask
"Bucky, you up, come play with Loki! Up! Up! Up!" Ecstatic, Loki started to scream.
Hope you like it and sorry for being gone
Steve then took his baby to the changing table and began to change the diaper.
-Hey Bruce don’t worry I understand. But I have to said I don’t have no one to take care of my two little monsters- Steve laugh
-Tony be nice your brother is playing with that one just wait a little so you can Okay later okay ?-
“Loki baby, como on let’s go to the potty”
-Thanks Bruce- Steve took the pill to then fall on his pillow
"TALE TELL"
Steve putting diapers in the two babies and Phil putting a pull up in Clint. Then some pajamas.
“Where’s Steve” she ask putting Loki on Thor’s lap, the boy got himself comfortable on his daddy and start watching TV with him. Jane smile at his baby boy and his man.
Anne smile she was so lucky to have this two wonderful boys in his life.
“So you forgot?” Jane ask
ENJOY !!!
Bucky bum was big red, the wooden spoon really did a good job in Steve opinion.
“No problem”
"Alright then. Tell me when you need it, goodbye, Baby."
They watch how Phil leave with Clint.
"Daddy stop I don't want!" Tony was crying hard and Steve had to stop too give his baby a moment to calm down
-Tony did it!- Bucky accuse form nowhere
“Oh oh” Steve thought mentally.
Loki just smile at his Daddy happy with him.
Here another chapter and now that I'm on vacation i will update more often now
“Yes we would love to”
Tony just nodded as he let his daddy clean it. Once the change was over, Steve reloaded Tony in his arms.
“I’m gonna go give these two a bath. What about you?” Steve ask
Tony did not say anything, just laughed at his daddy before putting his thumb in his mouth.
-Wow I have to smelly babies in my hands haha- Steve say with a smile on his face
"IT WAS BUCKY'S IDEA!"
Steve then came back with two bottles of milk. Tony and Bucky start drinking te milk until their eyes start getting closed.
“He is, Guys say Hi” Dan said picking up Eddie on his hip, but Eddie was quick to hide in Dan’s neck.
He put him in a nappy also getting sure about the rash cream and in some white pajamas with stars all over it. And a red dummy in his mouth. He then put Bucky in the same crib as tony. Both babies were surprised.
-how are you feeling ?- Bruce ask
-I will steve. Rest well-
“I woke up with a rash so dad say It needed some air” Loki said grabbing some pillows
-Tell my babies I said love you-
Those days the brothers didn’t talk at all. Bucky was still mad at Tony and Tony was sad Bucky would get mad if he talk. So these two days had been a torture for Steve.
“V are you in there”...nothing...”I juts wanted to say I’m sorry about what I said earlier, I didn’t mean it your not a parasite Daddy told we are unique, I like that word now. I love you V can we be friends again?” Eddie ask playing with his fingers.
“Mom have you seen my teddy” Loki ask tugging at jane’s pants
Thor smile “He woke up this morning more older than usual we think maybe thirteen years old”
SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK!
It was a bright morning at the Strak Tower.
“There all good now” Jane said happy
“But Daddy Tony wasn’t letting me play with him” tears start appearing in Bucky’s eyes
Steve clean Bucky taking off his clothes and putting them in the bin of dirty laundry.  Then he proceed to change Bucky and put the squirming boy next to his brother in the playpen.
“Yes the park!” Bucky said happily
“Should we give this little boy a bath?”
“I’m gonna go and bring some clothes for Clint” Phil said while going to the other floor.
“Yes he did I don’t wanna play with a freak like him”
Thanks for reading sorry for the long wait
The feeling of someone tugging his hair caused Bucky to slowly open his eyes. He found some mischievous green
Steve put Tony first in the changing table while Bucky was put in the floor for a moment.
Steve did not understand at first until he saw one of Tony's hands traveling to his diaper.
Steve sighed and saw the clock, it was barely seven o'clock in the morning, so Steve found it unusual for Tony to be awake, when normally Tony gets up at nine in the morning just like Bucky.
“Daddyyy whyyy I was watching” Loki protests
Steve was tired. It was the middle of the night and Steve was Like really tired. Having two over tired and cranky babies wasn’t a easy task. And all could be avoided if Steve would not have said “yes” to Bucky.
"I was picking up a green block and Bucky tumble my tower." Tony began.
Thor put Loki in the bed and when the TV was On he went to the bathroom to take a shower.
They were in the park for almost an hour until Steve saw it was time for lunch. and probably Tony and Bucky needed a change too.
“With Toys?” Tony ask walking beside his Daddy grabbing his hand while Steve carried Bucky.
“Good to see you too Steve how are the little ones doing?” She ask happily
"Loki has to go?" Bucky asked, a pout forming on his lips.
Steve enter the nursery with a smile on his face, happy to expend the day with his two Little’s. They were going to have so much fun. But first he needed to wake up his babies.
"Yes daddy, In sorry daddy"
“Goodnight my beautiful prince” Thor and Jane said
“Bucky time to go” steve calls
Jane went over the living room and start playing with the two boys.
Thor put Loki in the changing table and opened the nappy only to find Loki’s balls and penis all red.
When dinner was eaten and dishes washed Eddie went to his room to have a talk with Venom before his bath.
Steve took Tony into the room where Bucky had already started entertaining himself alone. All his blocks scattered the floor while he destroyed his towers. Tony made his hands toward the blocks and Steve slowly put him on the floor where he immediately starts crawling towards them. But before his grabby hands reached the toys he was stopped by Bucky.
Steve went over the changing table and start taking off Bucky’s diaper “wow baby you did pee a lot” Bucky just smile
Once the bath was done he carries both  babies to the changing table were he change them in some thick nappies and some cozy pajamas. And after a bottle and a good bedtime story all of them were fully pass out.
“It’s milk silly”
“Hey, don’t be like that” Jane said, she then kiss Thor one more time before going after Loki to his room to play
Steve really hoped that in Anne’s and Dan next visit thing would go smoothly. And also he hoped for the rest of littles to show up. They didn’t this time after Steve inform all the parents about the situation and They all agreed that was better if they didn’t come and reschedule for another day.
-Tony put your toys away is bath time- Steve said to Tony who was in front of the Tv, a movie playing while he played with his toys.
-play nice you three I will see how is steve-
I accept ideas and if anyone have any requests i'm open to anything jajaja thanks for reading
Hope you like it, see you soon!
-you can continue playing after lunch.  and guess what we'll do after- Thor ask
They spend the afternoon watching movies. Steve has to change more that ten diapers that day and has two change three times of shirt because of two upsets tummy’s.
“Sure bud clothes off”
Thor filled the cup to then give it to loki who ran happily to the living room to continue playing with his stuffed animals.
"Oh, don't worry about it. I already wanted to wake him up anyway." Steve looked down to Bucky, patting his shoulder gently. "Hey buddy, you're okay. Look, it's Loki. He just wanted to play
“Funny” Loki said to himself, the cream felt good in his hand. He continue playing with the cream. Grabbing and then letting go.
-Oh baby, I don’t know. It makes me sad that you two still don’t talk-
-Please Daddy- Loki said while making adorable puppy eyes
-Tony is my friend again too-
-Hey there fellow, how are you doing my good friend-
-they are gonna come? I can show them my room it would be fun- Loki said eating some of his chicken
Loki stop  jumping on the moment he saw Jane at the door.
"I'm wet Daddy" Bucky announced
“Ugh Fine!”
Steve rolled his eyes at the statement
Steve was just finished making some sandwiches for dinner, keeping a close eye to Bucky who is in a chair facing a corner in time out while Tony was busy coloring while watching the little mermaid.
Tony sat on his crib looking around a little confused until he spot his Daddy. In that moment he decided he didn’t like the crib anymore, his daddies arms were better.
Steve headed for the change table and carefully placed Tony.
"Please Baby, Bucky doesn't care it's just until we get home." Thor pleaded with Loki.
Steve has just finish with the two bottles when he suddenly hear the cries of some not very happy littles. He quickly ran to the room where Bucky was crying, a reddened mark on his arm. He ran towards his daddy while Tony sadly looked at them from one of the corners.
-Icky Daddy- Tony cry
“Hi Daddy” Tony said with a smile on his face
Bucky just followed his daddy quietly, afraid that maybe he would get even more mad. They arrived at the nursery and Steve put Tony back on his crib, kissing his cheek and wishing him a good night.
-Hey baby, you know what-
Thor smiled at his little to then carry him in his arms and leave the house.
“Mom! Shh im watching Adventure Time”
"Shh, it's okay calm down, Baby. Show Daddy where it hurts." Bucky refused to speak and instead raised his hands to be lifted by his Daddy. Steve complied and walked over to Tony, who still had some tears in his eyes. He lifted Tony and took  both his babies to the sofa where he sat each on one of his legs.
Bucky of course grew anxious about his dad hearing his brother so he was quick to go over Tony and put his hand over his mouth making the younger one scream even louder.
Loki change the bear clothes for some white pijamas.
They start eating Loki concentrate on his food, not paying attention to Jane and Thor conversation.
Tentacles appear from behind Eddie and start surrounding Eddie’s body giving him a hug that Eddie respond right away. They stood there for a couple of minutes until they both heard Anne calling for them to get in the bath.
But Tony doesn't care about that and starts crying at the top of his lungs for Bucky to take him back.
“Please Daddy Just one” Bucky said putting the best puppy’s eyes in the world.
“Daddy let’s go” Bucky said whining
Steve doesn't tolerated any shouting. so giving a slap on Tony's thing he shuts Tony down.
-Okay Uncle Thor- the two boys said
In that moment both babies start crying on the top of his voice, and Steve was getting some stares from people.
“I know baby, and I know this can be a little confused for you and Tony but what you said today really made Eddie really sad.
-what buddy- Bucky said annoyed
"Oh sorry, baby boy. I forgot to bring extra undergarments." Thor said apologetically.
The morning in the tower start like any other. Steve was asleep in his room without a care of the world. That until the baby monitor came to life with the stressful cries of two well awake babies who demanded attention.
-Don’t worry Bruce is not te first time I do this just go-
Both brothers were laughing together, forgetting about why there were mad at each other.
“Baby you weren’t watching” Thor said picking Loki up.
“Love you baby so much”
Loki and Bucky spent the rest of the afternoon playing without any more incidents. When the time came for loki and Thor to leave, both cousins said their goodbyes with tears. Not too many, for they would soon see each other again.
“I know...I’m so sorry Daddy I didn’t mean it”
Steve takes care of his babies
Steve took Bucky to the nursery only to see Tony already up standing in his crib babbling to himself, he immediately start screaming when he saw his daddy and brother.
“Tony you know better” steve sight. Tony looking up at him also ready to cry.
"Everything alright?" Asked Steve from the other side of the room.
"Me daddy" Bucky said, he was the older he should was the one of the idea he should take the punishment first.
Steve made quick work of the job, removing the wet nappy and wiping his bum with ease. He finished by applying some cream and dressing him in a new nappy.
“Hi uncle Steve” Clint said with his face full of spaghetti sauce
“Let’s see what Daddy think THOR!” Jane call
“Steve I think this visit was way to early “ Dan said
Once dinner was over Janes help Thor washing the dishes while Loki went to the sofa searching for his beloved teddy bear, it was a big green teddy with red overalls but he couldn’t find it there.
Eddie blushes at his dad words. And walking towards Dan he hug him
-this afternoon i can’t watch tony and Bucky I have some plans. I’m so sorry-
“No” Loki answer simply
-Noo daddy want up- Bucky continue crying
“It is Daddy” Loki said trying to scratch himself
Steve ended buying two candys for each little. Once the shopping had finished Steve went with his babies to the park as he had promised.
"Sorry, Daddy." Loki whispered, a glimmer still in his eyes.
"Was my tower too." Bucky interrupted stubbornly, his arms crossed.
Thanks if you are still reading This story
"Daddy im sorry" Bucky whispered in the verge of tears "don't be mad" tears start rolling down his cheeks.
-Why don’t we go and play with Loki and Bucky-
Steve signed he looked at the clock and saw that it was 3 in the morning. He was to tired for this.
Thanks for continue reading !!!!
Once the tree Little’s were clean. And Phil came back with Clint’s clothes, they start dressing the boys.
“Mommy he said venom was a monster...HE ISNT” Eddie cry
The baby only nodded his head, still crying and rubbing at his eyes.  Steve stood with Bucky in his arms and made his way through the kitchen. He then started preparing the bottle, fixing up another in case Tony woke up. When he finished he headed back to the room, settling Bucky in his arms and placing the bottle in his mouth. He began to suck, warm milk flowing down his throat. His eyes slowly closed in comfort; in no time he was fully asleep in Steve's arms. Steve slowly stood and took his sleeping baby to the nursery where Tony was still sleeping. He put Bucky in the crib next to Tony and left without making the slightest noise, walking to the living room he needs to do make some calls.
Steve put the two babies in their high chairs and put some  pasta for each baby.
-Wanna play hidden- Bucky ask
“Loki baby do you have something under that shirt” Jane ask lifting Loki’s shirt
Sorry for leaving for soo long, I hope you like tha chapter and I hope to update soon...enjoy
-Boys please, don’t be rude with each other, was an accident- Steve tried to said only to be cut off
Steve was trying to change  Tony as fast as he could.
"It's suppose to just darling please say still"
If you're still reading this Thank u so much and if u wants to see more of this let me know or something that you'll like to see...Also I have a new story it's freaking weird haha
The two boys played for almost three hours nonstop until Thor arrived.
-Okay so let’s wait JARVIS to have the tub filed. Go and choose you pajamas while I put Bucky in the nursery so if he wakes up he can find us in the same room. Agree?-
"S-sorry, D-daddy. I'm a bad boy, Daddy." Loki stumbled his words through his tears.
“Hey Dinner’s ready”
“Is okay don’t worry” Jake smile kissing Thor’s libs, Thor then look at Loki who was looking at them with his mouth full of nuggets and broccoli
Soon they finish eating and Loki fun to his room to pack a backpack full of his toys.
-I’m gonna put you in your crib, after I give Bucky his bath a warm bottle would be waiting for you and your brother-
“Boys what’s happening here” Steve said picking up Bucky bouncing him a little trying to calm him down
-Yeah stupid door- Tony repeat
"No way Tony this is our chance to be the first ones to try the new chocolate cookies uncle Thor brought yesterday"
-Okay Daddy- Tony got relaxed in his crib thinks about that sweet warm bottle.
Bucky start to count while Loki and Tony run to hide, Tony decided to hide behind the door of the bathroom while Loki decide to hide in the babies nursery.
-Daddy out- Bucky said
Today unfortunately Loki has woke up in a older headspace (12 year old) and at that age he gets more complicated to control, always making a fuss and some times clingy to Jane and Thor.
"Daddy where's Tony?" Bucky asked, realizing the crib was empty.
-I wanna go and see daddy, I miss him-
-Did you have fun with uncle Thor and Loki- Bruce ask as he change the two babies in their pijamas after having given them a bath
"Good morning baby what are you doing" Steve ask smiling at his little boy.
“Baby don’t do that you can get hurt and Maybe is because all the rash cream I put on you don’t worry it will pass” Jane kiss Loki’s cheek and pick up the boy tickling his tummy making the younger one laugh.
"Tony come here"
Steve put Toy Story and left both children in only the diaper in the room because of the heat was doing that day. He headed to the kitchen where two sippy cups served apple juice, making sure he sank medicine to help Tony.
"Hey Little guy whats the matter" Steve ask as he held Bucky in his arms as they headed into the room where both boys were playing with blocks
“Come In, come in”
Steve smile at his cute but naughty boy. He just kissed his hair and before falling asleep himself.
Today was a rare day, both Tony and Bucky has woken up in a more bigger headspace. Bucky was eight and Tony was seven. very close ages.
Loki sucked on his bottle happily while playing with his mom’s hair. “Such a beautiful baby” Jane said giving Loki a small kiss on his little nose
“So with what are we gonna play first?” Jane ask
"Okay ready to continue" Steve ask
Both friends enjoyed the warm water after all the crying. And after a pull-up and pijamas were on place Eddie and Venom relaxed on Anne and Dans bed watching a movie while drinking a bottle of sweet milk. (With a little bit of chocolate, venom’s favourite.
"Bucky! Loki is sorry he wake you up!" Loki was almost screaming, he was so loud.
This was a request by: Interupptingmoose218
“I don’t want to play alone”
"Loki, I told you not to disturb the babies!" Thor said admonishingly while embracing Loki.
Thor could heart them from the kitchen with a smile on his face, he was happy his family was all together. After a while he went upstairs to call Jane and Loki and opening the door slowly he made his way in.
“Mom down please”
“Okay dad” the boy murmured looking towards the other two boys
“Hi Steve, Its me Thor! came here to visit”
"Hi daddy"
“Hi there honey bee” Steve said
Bruce just smile and love each baby in a crib before going out the nursery.
-Daddy up up up- both babies scream
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve pick Tony up and put him on the changing table opening the diaper.
After hang up the call Thor went to the living room
And now Steve was starting to feel headaches, pain all over his body and in some occasions he’s been sick.
“Candys” Bucky said
“Sorry Daddy drink too much”
“Loki I told you I was cooking dinner” But Loki only whines more rolling his eyes
"Boys? What are you doing here at this hour...Tony how did you get out of your crib and...Bucky what are you doing?"
Today was a rainy day, and the only thing that meant was that the little family would be stuck inside the tower. For Bucky it meant that his baby brother would be asleep for most of the day.
Bruce has take the two little away form the sick man the moment steve start feeling bad.
They went to the living room were Loki already had taken all his toys out. Thor  placed Tony next to Bucky.
Steve went over the sofa a took Bucky into the nursery where he let him on the floor carpet. It was full of pillows and teddy bears, so it was very comfy.
And now everything make sense. This wasn’t the first time Loki touched things and then with the dirty hand he touched his privates. The first time Thor was confused and took Loki to the doctor, who told him that Loki’s skin was more  sensitive and could get irritated very easily with some products.
-Bucky told me he wasn’t talking to you because he think you are still mad at him. Maybe if you tell him you are not mad he would be okay- Steve tried
-Yes Bucky, tony loves you lots-
"Maybe you don't want to go play with Bucky..." Steve said as he got up and walked towards the door.
After some time, Bucky managed to calm down, asked to be put down to go play with Loki.
Steve was fast asleep in his bed, with a baby at his side. Bucky had refused to go to sleep in his own crib the previous night and to avoid a possible tantrum Steve decided that when Tony was asleep he would take Bucky to his bed.
“And this little cutie over here most be  Tony” Anne said with a smile on her face
After saying good bye to the other family Steve went straight to the nursery to have a talk with his boys.
Steve thought now it would be a good opportunity to ask.
“Daddy wet” Bucky said at the verge of tears, his diaper felt horrible against his bits.
“Okay boys go and have some fun but remember don’t go to far” Steve said letting Tony and Bucky have some fun, while he just sit in one of the chairs and look at his babies running and laughing about silly things.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve laugh with Thor, Loki already asleep.
“It’s cream silly Daddy smell so good” Loki said smiling
Little’s were normal, all the persons knew about them, is just sometimes the crying of two Little’s could get a little annoying and Steve knew it.
“Yes I wanna go out to the park Daddy” Bucky said smiling making grabbing hands for his Daddy
“Maybe a bottle and a nap would be good right now, what do you think” both babies continue crying “I really could use a nap with my two favorite boys” He kiss each baby forehead before going over the table and strap his sons on the high chairs, obviously this only makes they crying louder.
The three adults when to the living room to chat about “Adult Stuff” while Loki was sitting in the kitchen table.
"Please, I will be quick and Bucky is waiting to play with you before bedtime."
-What Daddy-
"Wait here baby, I'm coming"
“Yummy!” Jane said bouncing Loki on her hip, Loki smile at his mom hugging her tight
Steve let Tony play for a while in the tub, taking his time washing his hair and body. Everything looks fine until Tony spoke.
Toby just erupted in giggles while he ran out of the bathroom being chased by Bucky
-No steve, stay calm Im gonna think of someone. You stay calm and layback- Bruce help Steve get back in bed
They went to Loki’s nursery, in one part of the room there was a little closet full of clothes for Loki’s teddy. Courtesy of Steve Bucky and Tony.
"Okay baby we are over, go lay down on the couch while I'm with Tony Okay?" Steve said kissing Buckys cheek taking off his nappy to let his bum get some air.
-Thanks boys love you too- Steve give each baby a kiss in their forehead. And also those two warm bottles.
Once the change was over, Steve took Tony back and laid him down beside Bucky.
Once the two Little’s were ready Steve took them to the kitchen to start breakfasts. He was already ready because of how early he had risen.
Steve finished preparing breakfast and catch both babies and sit them in their high chairs. Breakfast was a mess of honey everywhere and chunks of waffles on the floor, but both kids ate and that's enough for Steve to be satisfied.
“Hello?”
“Sorry,” he said, awkwardly.
Steve sighed. “No, I’m not.”
A face in question was resting on the man's other hand and appeared to be deep in sleep but even so, there were frown lines crinkling his face and for a moment Tony wondered
“What?”
Tony being lucky (or unlucky in this case) managed to be the first one to get through all the doombots and close in on Doom all the while reassuring Steve that he was going to be fine when the other man yelled at him to be safe.
Tony was sure they would have taken away his PHDs if they found out how
But his favorite moment with Tony happened one month after they first met. Tony remembered what they talked about that day at the gala and took Steve to the children’s hospital. Steve could still remember the look on the kids’ faces when they saw Tony. They were so excited. And Tony was so natural with them, like he was finally able to be himself with those children. Steve was surprised how much the kids liked
“SHIELD. They found it.”
Steve brought up a hand to cover his smile. Tony looked indignant but amused, so Steve didn't feel too bad about it.
“The details of the mission are classified but let’s just say that there was this organization we were supposed to stop, right? It was supposed to be pretty straightforward, we had intel on their location, and we had to go in and out, gather more information and report to the base.”
To Steve’s surprise, Natasha was the first one to nod. “Very well, then. If that’s what you think will work, then that is what we should do. But Steve, if I suspect, even for a second, that he might be pulling our leg…”
He also seemed to be the leader of their little group, because as soon as one of the minions saw that Steve was awake, he gestured to the face tattoo guy, who turned around and smiled.
“That’s nice,” Stark said. He took a sip of the coffee Steve didn’t even realize he had in his hand, then continued, “I meant what I said, you’ve got some real talent. I’m not really an art person but even I can tell. I’ll recommend you to Pepper, she’ll appreciate it more.” The casual stream of words seemed so out of place coming from someone like Stark that Steve had to take a second to convince himself he wasn’t imagining things.
“Yes. But is our best enough?”
“This is…” Steve started, and Tony looked up, his face natural but his eyes vulnerable. “Beautiful.”
“No, Tony,” Steve said.
He felt it, sometimes, before the serum. Watching the boys play outside while he was stuck in bed, weak and sickly. He wanted to be more like them. ‘Jealousy,’ his mum would say, getting him away from the window, where he sat for hours watching other kids play, ‘is not a good look on you.’
He would never forgive himself if Tony got hurt.
He was just getting worried, opening his mouth to say something, when Tony kissed him. Steve gasped into the kiss, putting his arm around Tony’s waist to bring him closer. They both kissed like they were starving for it, like after today they didn’t think they would get to do this again. It was messy and fast, but by now they knew each other well enough to make it somewhat coordinated. Steve pushed Tony behind until he reached one of the many tables, then grabbed him by the thighs and lifted him up. Tony spread his legs so that Steve could fit between them, and they were still kissing, barely stopping to breathe. Steve started kissing down Tony’s neck, enjoying Tony’s silent gasps, when a voice suddenly interrupted them.
"No!" Steve said, a touch too loud. At Tony's startled look, he said, "I like the red."
Steve was about to start speaking when Natasha interrupted. “We could have Bruce make a virus. You’d slip it into Stark’s computer and download everything on it.”
Watching the people cope, in those past five years, showed Steve one thing. Thanos was wrong. He left a world where the resources could thrive, perhaps, but that world was broken now. You can’t create a better world when the people suffer. Sure, they will try to move on. It’s in our bones, that need to keep going, to survive. But it’s not the same. People are not the same. The scars left run too deep.
But it was the kiss that sealed the deal. The kiss, that was soft and warm and slow and nothing like the rushed kisses of last night, when Tony was only trying to get through the night, fearing the memories and the pain they would bring him the next morning.
“What is it?” he asked, leaning on the bar and bowing his head so no one could see his lips moving.
Tony laughed.
They somehow stumbled into Tony's bedroom, his bed. Steve didn’t notice much, apart from the fact that the bed was huge and expensive. But nothing about the rest of the room registered in his mind. It was a little disconcerting, because Steve was the guy who noticed everything, knew all the possible exits and items that could be used as weapons, when he was only five seconds into the room. But it was like none of it mattered now, the feel of Tony's hands on his bare skin after getting his shirt off the only thing worth noticing.
One blast from Iron Man's new, improved repulsors and they were dust.
Tony took the card but didn’t seem reassured. He only appeared more frustrated. “Why did you even have to involve them? Couldn’t you just have called Iron Man or something?”
“Well, I’m sure Peggy will handle it, now that she knows about it.”
“I’m an early riser,” Steve responded, finally taking a sip of coffee. He couldn’t help but making a surprised sound at how good it was.
“It should have rebooted by now I think, yeah.” Tony said. “But there is no way I'll be able to extract that bomb from the wall. Not even Thor would have managed that.” Tony looked back at the way the bomb was fused with the wall. “And if I take the wall, the building will collapse,” he turned back to look at Steve's eyes. “Besides, there would be no time, there is no way I can manage to carry the entire wall far away so that it doesn't kill anyone. Best case scenario, I fly it high enough for just the Manhattan to blow... Actually, we're too late for even that now.” A glance back told him they had 2 more minutes.
But Steve didn’t even look disappointed, or mad, didn’t raise his voice, or said anything really. He just took a chair and sat down next to Tony.
“Why not?” Tony asked, irritated, but Steve thought he could see cracks in the carefully constructed mask Tony always wore in public. There was nervousness there, and maybe something else.
Tony didn’t open his eyes at first. Steve held his breath as he waited. And then Tony slowly blinked, adjusting to the light. And the first thing he saw was Steve.
“I swear to God, I thought she was gonna throw her shoes at me. I’m sure that the only reason she didn’t was because they cost more than her rent,” Tony babbled, smiling fondly.
Tony nodded, an acknowledgement passing over the two men. When he looked over at Steve and saw his frown, Tony said jokingly, “Don’t worry, they might pass all of that, but they will never get pass Pepper.”
“You're right, I'm sorry,” he signed and turned sideways so that he was looking at her (and if from the corner of his eye he could still see the two figures pressed together laughing, nobody had to know).
trust Iron Man at the end of the day, maybe even respected him, relied on him during battle, but at times like this it was obvious that Iron Man didn’t feel the same.
“That’s none of your business,” he said, as calmly as possible.
It was obvious why once he checked who the buyer was.
"The point is that someone really close to me betrayed me. Someone I looked up to, someone who was like a father to me. He wasn't the first one, but it hurt more than others. Since then I told myself, I was better alone. Not putting my trust in people was easier than letting them hurt me."
“Fine, whatever,” Iron Man said. “Well, as much as it’s lovely to see you Widow, I’m afraid I’ll have to leave you now. I have something I have to take care of.”
“The bomb. If I manage to short-circuit it...”
Steve frowned but said nothing. Tony cleared his throat. “Right. You didn't have to stay with me you know. You could've gone to talk to Fury, find out exactly what happened. Really, I would have been fine.”
Steve smiled.
“No way, Steve,” Tony said, still looking at his boyfriend (sort of, kind of. They still haven't even had time to discuss it, dammit) with wide eyes.
Steve pulled away. “Was that okay?” he asked and it was such a Steve thing to do that Tony could have laughed. But he was too tired to do much of anything so he just nodded and laid his head back on Steve's chest. Steve's arms came around him instantly and Tony again felt that safety, warmth and... love?
“I think I liked it. That I could rile you up like that when everyone always said you were usually so stoic.”
“I am,” Steve spoke for the first time. “And I’ll tell you everything you want to know. Would you like to sit down first?”
“Okay let’s put teddy on your bed while I change you”
“Bye uncle Phil” the two babies said.
Tony stand up and when crawling towards his daddy who was setting Bucky in one of  the two seats it was a double pushchair.
While Steve was talking with Thor he heard through the baby monitors that his two boys were up. He went running to his room only to find his two babies making grabby hands for his Daddy.
“Bucky stop your being mean Daddy said didn’t say that”
And for the first time since they arrive Tony realize the little that was holding hands with Dan and Anne
"I wanna go back" Tony whimper playing with his fingers and biting his lip.
The tree Little’s ended playing the rest of the afternoon without more inconveniences. And while Thor feed the babies with the warm bottles while Loki nap next to him Bruce arrive. And after he checked on Steve the kids says there good byes.
“Say hi baby” Anne said patting the boy hair softly
-Wait baby I have to get you two some bottles- Steve said smirking while goin out. This was his last change to make thing better again.
contents in Steve shirt.
Bucky heard the alarm meaning his time was up.
“We do not jump on the beds Okay mister”
"We wanted some of the cookies" he whispered
Steve took Bucky and with a big effort he managed to clean him. The little ended smelling to strawberries.
After the two angels were asleep, Steve went to his room to rest. Tony and Bucky wanting to sleep in the same crib. Grabbing each other hands.
Thank yoy fro reading
-We also love Daddy- Bucky said a little shy
-Shh baby boy calm down you’re gonna make yourself sick sweetie- but it was to late because the moment steve pick up Bucky the baby’s tummy expelled all his
“Okay we can go, but first we have to put you and you brother in the pushchair so we can go to the park”
"No!" Tony's favorite word.
-good morning my babies how are you ?- said Steve entering the nursery with a smile on his face but it seems that neither Bucky or Tony were in the mood this morning.
-No Daddy- Loki said annoyed- I’m still playing-
“Yes sir”
-So little man what you wanna do now- Thor ask
(See the end of the chapter for
His daddy sounded exasperated, Tony could tell so with a small voice he answered before things could get worse.
-Is Bucky still mad at me?- Some tears going down his eyes
Bucky went to take a look but at the moment bucky saw on top of the crib loki jump giving a big scare to both babies who immediately started crying also they wet themselves.
Steve came back with something that look like a wooden spoon hidden behind his back. He went to the kitchen to her everything ready for breakfast while keeping a close eye to the little ones.
The little obediently took his toys away while Steve turn off the TV and then tony  walk back to Steve arms. This one picking his little up giving kisses on his cheek.
“Yes babe” Thor appears at the door seconds later
Eddie just looked down at his dinner not making a move to eat, while Anne and Dan just looking at each other not knowing what to say.
Both boys followed Steve with rosy cheeks.
“Now come on I have to shower, you can continue playing in my room and watching some tv okay” Thor ask
“What monster baby” Steve ask looking at Anne and Dan who had an also crying little in his arms. And now it all clicked to Steve, Bucky had meet Venom.
"Baby, please. We do this every night."
“Oh steve don’t worry I’m just glad he took a bath. Thanks Steve”
-Maybe after I give Bucky his bath and put you two in their cribs you can talk to him- Steve said grabbing a towel to clean tony up.
“Okay boys is almost bed time what you wanna do?” Steve ask the two babies who were sitting in the room with toys around them.
“We are not friends” Bucky said rising a little his voice. “You are weird Daddy told us you have a monster inside you”
They enjoy the company for a while until the babies start demanding food, they all eat some pasta Steve made and after dinner Jane Thor and Loki went home.
-and Phil and Clint I’m sure Bucky would be happy to spend some time with Clint-
-sowwy Daddy- Bucky cry again
"Tony shut up your gonna wake up Daddy don't be a baby"
(See the end of the chapter for
“Okay” Loki went over his bed and put Teddy very carefully on his bed.
“Thank you Daddy”
Tony just looked at Bucky with an unsure face, he knew how this was going to end. Probably daddy would hear them and he'll come downstairs to check where the noises were coming only on to find him and his brother.
“With my dinosaurs!”
Just then a knock in the door was heard.
-I hope Steve recovers and of course, Loki would be happy to spend some time with the Little’s. we'll be there in an hour- Thor Answered
“Watch the attitude young man let’s take a break and then you can continue” Jane pick up Loki and took him to the bathroom.
-BOYS WHAT HAPPENED!- Steve said a little angry but at the same time very worried.
"Not feeling good" said Tony
Loki in the meantime was getting bored. He start looking at his sorrows until he spot a big jar of cream. He got curious about what was In that jar. So crawling into the jar direction Loki took the jar and opened putting on his hands inside.
Jane put Loki a pair of blue pijamas and a Spider-Man theme nappy with white socks and a also blue dummy.
-Tony wait I still need to find Loki come and help me- Bucky said
-Fine just a little and then lunch okay?-
The baths were individual because the two boys didn’t want to be together. Meals were pass in silence. And each baby playwith his own toys not even looking at themselves.
Loki thought on this for a moment. He really needed to go, but he was having fun with Bucky so he simply shook his head.
(See the end of the chapter for
Father and son ended sleeping until the next day.
Steve take the playpen to the kitchen and while the two babies cry steve in lees than five minutes have two bottles with medicine. Steve took his two babies in his arms and put one In each knee.  He gave each baby a bottle and they start sucking with hungry. Steve press kisses on each cheek of their children.
-No Tony stop- Bucky whine as Tony attempts to “Help” Bucky playing with some cars
That was enough to make Bucky shut his mouth.
“Okay buy it looks better now so how about I put you in some undies”
“Yummy?” Thor ask Loki nodded happily drinking form his sippy cup
“Hi Steve” Anne and Dan said at the same time
“Let’s go play! Dad doesn’t want to play with me”
Bruce rush to the kitchen to prepare to bottles of milk in lest that 10 minuets he was back with the bottles. He put each baby in the playpen, put a Disney movie and give each baby the bottle. The two of them start sucking the warm milk until they fell sleep Hugging each other.
“Night night” Loki whispers sleepy
-Daddy up please- Bucky cry
“Do you think We are a freak” Eddie spoke up.
A loud scream was heard, Steve emerged from the bathroom In some jeans and a shirt, his hair still damp.
“Okay baby wait here remember the cream the doctor give us for This things, I’m going to bring it” Thor went to were the cream was and then he put some on Loki’s genitals.
-what Daddy- Loki ask while Thor put him in his High chair-
eyes watching him.
Once the two little were set Steve made his way out of the tower and start the ride to they first stop. The mall. Steve was getting out of diapers and food so they need to do some shopping, then he would take the two Little’s to the park.
After some minutes the alarm went off, indicating that it was time for the spanking. Steve went over the boys.
“One moment boys” Steve got both bottles with milk for then Putting them on the microwave.
Some days are not good days
"Okay Bucky over my lap"
“Daddy said it was an alien that lives inside you and...and...he says...”
Arriving to their apartment Eddie was quick to run straight to him room slamming the door.
SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK!
-Thank you Bruce, thank you so much I will make up yo you. Really.-
“Tony come here”
“Yes mom” Loki look at his bear on his hands “look mom I found my teddy!”
Bruce left the room and go directly to the living room where he left the two babies in the playpen.
“Daddy!” Both babies scream making grabby hands over Steve
-Dada- Tony said
"Hey do not cry angel, shhh everything will be fine love calm down" Steve Lifted Tony in his arms, the baby hiding his head in Steve's neck
“I’m sorry Daddy I didn’t meant to be disrespectful”
-Steve go to sleep, I would take care of everything. You don’t have to worry just relax-
SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK!
"Hey, boys." Thor said warmly.
Steve proceeded to remove Tony's diaper, and seeing the gift that Tony had left for Steve understood why his baby's crying and displeasure. He was sick of his little tummy.
"No Daddy!" Steve sighed.
“Loki that’s something you shouldn’t be doing you could have gotten hurt” Jane exclaim going over to Loki helping him getting out of the bed.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve smile down at his little boy
Oh they were gonna get in so much trouble.
“Tony baby is time to go, come here”
Tony watched as Steve went to his crib and from there he took Tony's pacifier who immediately began to move asking for the pacifier that then Steve put in his mouth. Tony stood still and sucked the object in his mouth happily.
Present time
I'll try to updated again soon :p
"Daddy want off" Tony cry in Steve neck
Bucky was happy playing with some other Little’s while Tony was catching some bugs. It was cute to see.

“Yes my Dear friend”
-Buddy want my car- Bucky said
“Okay babies time to go” he said while going over tony and picking up the little baby.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yesss” Tony said while putting other pancake in his mouth.
They enter to the nursery and Tony went directly to his teddies. But when he was grabbing his teddy he saw something moving inside one of the cribs.
(See the end of the chapter for
-Love you too Tony-
He went immediately to Bucky’s side and pick up his baby. Putting a hand under Bucky’s butt.
“Did Daddy forgot?” Jane ask confused
-That’s what I thought. How about I make some warm bottles for you two. Okay then wait here in the sofa watch some TV and I will back in no time-
“Why don’t you go play with you vídeo games” Jane and Thor had toys for both of Loki’s headspace so he doesn’t get bored no matter what age.
"Of course you are. Now, let Daddy change you." Thor said, putting Loki on the changing table. He cleaned him well
Eddie covered his ears closing his eyes
“Baby is time to wake up we have some things to do today, we are gonna have fun and go to the park!” Steve said excited
“Okay babies time to eat” Steve said, he usually would help the boys to eat but because he made pancakes he could let them eat by themselves.
-Okay- Tony said with a little sniffle
"Fine, Daddy but I'm still a big boy." Loki said grumpily, crossing his arms.
"Bye, Daddy." Loki waved as Thor left the room.
thanks for reading it
-Bucky baby is time for your bad then you can continue sleeping-
Bucky just continue crying raising his hands wanting his daddy more than ever.
“Love you too baby boy” Steve said smiling to his boy
"But Daddyyy, I'm bored!" Frustrated tears fell from Bucky's eyes and slid down his cheeks.
-calm down baby’s I’m on my way, there you are- Steve pick up Tony first and immediately the baby cries die now that he was in his Daddy arms.
-Yes baby-
Steve finished bathing Tony and wrapped him in a light blue towel, taking him to the nursery. There he changed him, first dressing him in his diaper and pajamas, then putting a pacifier into Tony's lips. He started sucking happily, smiling at the comfort. Steve held him in his arms and took him to the living room where Bucky was patiently waiting for them.
“That’s great baby come on let’s get teddy and you ready for bed”
-It wasn’t me!-
"Let's get you changed" he said in a serious tone, Bucky whimpered. He had pee back there in the kitchen, he was so afraid Daddy was gonna spanking right there.
“Not im not” Eddie said also starting to cry “it wasn’t me it was Venom...I’m not naughty”
Thor soon finish making dinner and before he could place the plates with chicken and French fries on the table the phone rang.
“I’m sorry Steve they get very shy around new people” Anne said taking Eddie from Dan’s hands
“Hi Jane good to see you it’s been a while” Steve said hugging Jane
-Hey Thor is me Bruce-
The two of them spend the rest of the afternoon watching movies and cuddling each other.
-I don’t want Dada to feel sad-
"I'm gonna start baby"
-Wow baby are you sick ?- Steve said in the moment he saw the mess in Tony’s diaper.
"I'm sorry daddy didn't mean too" Bucky cry harder
“Hey Guys is me and mommy can we come in we really like to talk with you both”
“Is okay they deserve some time apart from me” Steve smiled he could have his baby’s anytime they deserve some time with their aunts and uncles too.
"I see that sweet heart"
"Boys enough, both of you know better than to fight and get out of your cribs I'm really disappointed at both for breaking the rules"
“Again I’m sorry”
-Boys what happens now- Bruce said while entering to the living room
“Love you Daddy” Tony said giving a kiss in Steve cheek
When Thor came out of the bathroom already dressed he saw Loki with one hand inside his nappy.
“Yummy Daddy” Bucky said happily with his face covered in honey he put in the pancakes.
and secured a new nappy around his waist.
everything went silence off a moment.
Steve pass a hand through his hair, now he had two babies crying his lungs out. He went over and pick up the boys in each arm.
-Yes Daddy- Tony said exited going over the nursery to choose his pajamas.
“Uncle Steve” he ask
"Bucky please do not be rude with your brother." Steve said using his special daddy voice.
"Okay boys let's talk" steve said also bringing Bucky besides him.
“That’s correct and I suppose the shadow behind Dan must be Eddie and Venom ”
“Itchy” Loki said covering his crotch
"Okay boys let's get something to eat"
"Wook Tony, put this one here."  Bucky said happily. They were building a big block tower. "Yeah, very good." He encouraged with a smile.
-Bucky are you...- Tony was cut
-Are you still my friend Bucky?- Tony ask
“There they are” Jane said going over Steve to steal his baby boys
“I am smelling spaghetti?” Jane ask going over te kitchen
The two brothers start searching all over the floor. When they decided Loki wasn’t in the same floor they decided to use the elevator to go to other floors. without permission from Thor.
-Loki you just finished your third cup. And lunch is almost ready-
Steve start cleaning him slowly before Tony speaks up.
“I think we should let them have a little space let’s go and start dinner” Anne suggests giving Dan a small smile, Dan in return kiss Anne’s cheek.
“Hell’s Kitchen?” asked Clint. “I’m almost impressed, didn’t think Hammer had enough balls for that place.”
pissed.
“Anything,” Tony said. “Everything.”
The tattoo guy frowned. “No, no. That wouldn’t do. I can’t even see your face properly. That’s just bad manners.”
“Hey, Tony.”
Steve was pulled to too many different sides. His shoulder and knee were bleeding. He had a broken nose.
It was Morgan. She was trying to feed an alpaca, somewhat successfully. The alpaca seemed unimpressed with all the food she was trying to give him, but he ate some anyway, almost as if he just wanted to make her smile. And smile she did, that big, bright, brilliant smile Steve knew all too well.
A fact that did kind of put him in his current predicament, true, but he was also pretty sure it saved a whole city and millions of people so Tony was not going to complain.
Steve was confused. Steve just needed to get Tony out of his system.
Tony just smiled. “We'll see.”
But Steve knew him well enough to recognize when Tony was hiding behind his public persona. He was always impressed with Tony’s ability to turn on the charm when the situation called for it.
“Do you think this one was stupid?”
It was easier than he thought it would be, in the end. He told them he was right behind them. He told them to meet up with Sam.
“That’s not the worse part. They had weapons. Our weapons. They were in league with this big corporation that we thought was on our side. We were way outnumbered and outgunned. Barely got out of it alive. Only reason we managed was…”
When he walked through the briefing room doors, Natasha, Clint, Bruce, Thor and Sam were already there, and they turned to look at him expectedly.
JARVIS, however, had other plans, “Sir, should I…”
“So, how are we going to get Tony Stark to come here?” asked Clint.
“Becomes serious,” he repeated, dully. “God, I don’t even know if he likes me. Or if he’s not only after a one night stand. I’m getting ahead of myself, Peggy. But I can’t stop thinking about him. He’s like a mystery I want to unravel, a case I want to solve. I can’t remember the last time I felt like that.”
Tony's eyes were shining with unshed tears and when he laughed it was broken and bitter and sad and everything Steve wanted to erase from Tony's voice. “I'm nothing more than broken, Steve,” he said, self-hatred in his voice cutting deep into Steve's heart.
“It’s not that,” Steve interrupted. “I mean, to a degree, but you certainly weren’t the only one who ever disagreed with me or didn’t follow my orders. I think… I think, looking back, maybe there was more to it.”
, and somebody could have hurt you. Or worse.” Steve was breathing hard, and even from his position kneeling next to Tony on the floor, his whole presence felt like it could melt gold just by looking at it.
“It will be in 5 minutes,” Natasha said pointedly.
“No, but fortunately for me you weren't doing anything...” he glanced in the direction the other guy went before looking back at Tony. “...interesting.”
Now here they were, in front of Steve’s small but loyal team. Steve knew that Tony probably connected Steve’s storied about his friends to Captain’s teammates, but he didn’t mention it, so Steve would wait until his team was caught up to bring it up.
“I would be enjoying it much more if I didn't have to look at your moping face.”
Steve was nervous for the whole three days since they send the message and got the confirmation. He didn’t like that his two lives were mixing up. It felt like he was at a crossroad, and whatever decision he made today will affect his life going forward.
Steve stole one of the henchman’s guns, and it was a quick work after that. Tony’s gauntlet gave him an edge, even when he wasn’t firing from it, and Steve was itching for a fight, which made him more ruthless than usual.
Before he could just settle for a random dish and hope for the best, Tony chimed in, “How about I order for you?”
"I thought we needed to talk."
It all started with a fight with Doctor Doom. The guy was brilliant if mad and Tony had to respect at least that. Didn't mean he didn't want to bring him down though.
Natasha once again, took the initiative to speak first. “Do you know who the Mandarin is?” Her voice was clipped and to the point. It was always effective.
"It is pretty badass," Steve said. "Not very stealthy, but definitely badass."
Steve smiled. “Thank you for coming.”
And then, without warning, a knife appeared at the other guy's hand, and it was all Steve could do to block it from plunging into his ribs. But then the second knife was in the other hand, going toward his side, and Steve braced himself for the pain.
Tony took the unfinished Iron Man gauntlet that was sitting on the desk. He tinkered with it a couple of days ago, trying to put more power in the laser beams, but he never finished it.
“That doesn’t change the fact that you didn’t like me very much as Iron Man.”
It was the last thing Steve wanted. Those last seven years without Tony have been torture. Sure, in the last five, since Thanos, he had seen him here and there. But it was rare, and they didn’t talk much, Tony’s words from after he came back to Earth ringing clearly in Steve’s head.
“What, Steve, you can’t just text him?” Bruce joked.
Tony’s lips pulled in a small, soft smile. “Of course.”
“Tony, I was flirting with you and everything.”
Tony shook his head. He knew what Steve meant. Of course the gauntlet was dangerous, it was an Iron Man weapon after all. But it wasn’t dangerous in a way that would stop Tony from letting Steve into the workshop.
“That’s quite a talent you’ve got there,” an amused voice said, just over his shoulder.
It made sense, in hindsight. If anyone were to create an Iron Man armor, it would be Tony. It was exactly like him, to make something brilliant and use it to help people, without taking any of the credit. And the way Tony talked about Iron Man, like it was something bigger than him, even when Steve didn’t know they were one and the same. The painting he bought from Steve and placed it right in the middle of his entry hall.
“But you never know what's going to happen while we're there,” he insisted
If he had, what would have happened? Would Tony have returned those feelings? Would they try to make it work, somehow, against all odds? Would Steve have Tony by his side all those years instead of having to look from afar, full of regrets?
“Yeah, I guess… We do still sell weapons, but it’s way less nowadays.” He bit his lip, debating whether to continue. Then said, “I’m thinking about shutting down the whole division actually. Well, not just thinking about it. We’re doing it. It’s just taking us a while.”
He chuckled. She
Steve didn't want to think about what they were doing back at Tony's penthouse, but it didn't take a genius to figure it out. Especially when Tony came down to breakfast the next morning all ruffled and with a loopy smile.
“Well, you can wait for SHIELD to come get you. They should be here soon enough,” he turned to look at Steve. It was a striking visual, Tony in the suit. Like two pieces of puzzle you couldn’t imagine fit together until you tried to place them next to each other, and then you couldn’t believe you didn’t see it sooner. “Or,” Tony continued, voice hopeful, “I can give you a ride.”
The mission, in the end, wasn’t a complete failure even it if wasn’t a success either.
“Because you’re only going to slow me down. You can’t cover enough ground on foot and if you get caught, it’s over, we’re back at zero.”
Tony turned back to the TV. Not for the first time, Steve wanted to know what he was thinking about.
“I'm not going to sit here and do nothing while you guys are fighting,” Tony insisted.
“He’s dead,” Natasha said. Steve knew she was thinking the exact same thing.
The thing was... nobody was supposed to know about their arrival. It was top secret and everyone involved in welcoming them worked for the Japanese government and were thereby sworn to secrecy.
Then a few days later he showed up, bringing some equipment to Bruce. It was just Steve’s luck he was in the hangar at that time, working on the Quinjet.
“Dude, those are his weapons,” Clint said.
It’s not like he had never been in a restaurant before. He’d been to plenty, thank you very much.
But there was no time for questions. Later. They would talk about it later. They just had to get out of there first.
So Natasha and Clint were inside, doing their magic, more secure than on any other SHIELD missions before, knowing that their team was having their backs.
Steve did not stay emotionless. He glared with a burning hatred.
"Talking is overrated," said Steve, his eyes on a beautiful distraction that were Tony's bitten red lips.
“Sometimes I miss the times when I didn’t have so much to lose.”
Steve nodded. “Well, I guess, it all started on our last mission. Not that we knew it would be the last one at the time.”
“Steve...” Natasha said in a soft voice. Steve didn't like it at all. “Steve,” she hesitated then, as if unsure whether she should tell him something or not. It was another thing she usually didn't show and Steve was glad to see her be so open with him. “I'm not sure I'm the right person to tell you this but I have a feeling Tony won't and you need to know.”
and he
Steve shook his head. “Mind if I join you?”
“It's not like any bomb I've ever seen,” said Natasha. She looked at Tony.
“It has to be.”
Tony huffed a laugh. He raised his head to look at Steve and they stared at each other for a long moment, lost in thought.
“The Mandarin? That doesn’t sound familiar,” Steve noted.
But not everything was done yet, as the ones not yet subdued put up quite a fight, not willing to go down that easily.
If anything, Tony looked even more baffled. “What do you think he would have done?”
Tony looked at them. “That’s it?”
It was true. They all knew it. But… “Well, maybe he’s different.”
Stark frowned. “Yes. The donations go to the hospital for disabled kids here in New York.”
Steve halted their steps before they managed to walk inside. “You sure you don't want to stay outside? We don’t know what’s in there.”
Then he remembered something. It was risky, but he didn’t have much choice. “I… I was actually a plus one to my friends. She didn’t want to go alone so she asked me if I’ll go with her. It’s not usually my scene but I didn’t want her to go alone, so…” Steve trailed off. He took a sip from his own coffee to hide his nerves. It was cold and Steve wondered how long he had been sitting there when Tony found him.
Tony rolled his eyes. Steve noticed he didn’t do well with compliments. “Still, I’d like to hear you too. Come on, tell me more about your life. Were you always an artist?”
"I don't know, probably not," Steve dragged a hand over his face.
Steve blinked. “No, I don’t,” he said in a strangled voice.
Steve shrugged. He didn’t want to risk saying anything wrong. It was bad enough Tony knew her. “So, do you talk to Janet often?” Steve asked, having to know.
“No, Steve,” Tony interrupted. “It’s not your fault.” Then he looked back at him. “I’m here because I want to be here.”
Natasha’s smirk was answer enough.
But before he could say anything, Tony was moving away from him. “Tony,” Steve called, trying to get him to stay, but Tony shook his head and walked away, almost breaking into a run but just barely containing his steps.
Tony finally looked up and it was like something inside him broke. He looked so vulnerable and there was so much pain and self-loathing in his eyes that Steve had to fight the urge to look away. Because there was something else in his eyes. Something Steve was ready to fight for.
The next half hour they spent in companionable silence, TV showing a boring, mind-numbing commercial that Natasha liked to watch to help her sleep. And soon she was saying goodnight, and as she stood up she put a hand on his shoulder, a passing touch. As she let go, he caught her hand. She paused and looked at him, eyes curious, but he did not notice. Her nails were painted red.
Steve huffed. “Anything else?”
“Tony Stark. He’s on his way to the restroom.”
Once she was done, they all sat in silence.
One of the things that made Steve a good leader was his ability to leave his personal feelings aside when he was in the uniform. When he was the Captain, Steve Rogers took a backseat.
“You think you guys can be ready by tonight?”
“It’s just me,” said Peggy, stepping out into the clearing.
Clint and Natasha shared a look.
The guy clutched his hand (and Tony distantly noticed it bleeding more than it should, but that was what vibranium would do to you after all) and Tony looked down at his burning arm. Steve managed to divert the gun but the bullet still grazed Tony's bicep and Tony winced. He covered the injury with his hand but wasn't too bothered by it (after all, he experienced pain much worse than that and besides, he almost died so grazed arm was nothing).
“Are you going to say something?” Steve asked quietly.
“Steve Rogers, have you drawn me?”
He left the sentence unfinished but Tony knew what he meant. “Fine. You’re here now. So talk.”
“No,” he said, calmly. He was anything but calm, but he refused to show it.
He had to move from his position, but he made sure to stay near the walls. He wasn't sure how much time had passed and he wasn't sure how much shots he fired but soon the room cleared and he saw that besides Steve and Natasha (and a pair of guards who also managed to cover their mouths on time) they were joined by a back-up and were on a great path in securing all the terrorists.
Their job didn't usually involve this kind of espionage, and it made Steve even more aware of his surroundings. Wealthy, entitled businessmen conversing over expensive champagne, discussing their million-dollar businesses.
“Was?” Steve asked. As far as he knew, Stark Industries was still selling weapons. They did expand in the last year or so, in the green energy mostly, as Tony himself was just talking about. But still, the weapon manufacturing was their primary income, always has been.
' as Cap so eloquently put it, they all found themselves situated at various places at the gala, where the intel exchange was supposed to happen. Tony and Steve, being the two most recognizable and thus obvious members of the team had to stay and patrol just outside, hidden in the shadows. Bruce waited in the van, nobody wanting to risk his stress level rising if the mission went awry (in a room full of people no less). Thor was with him, as he was the one with zero stealth capability (he would just break into the gala and demand that the intel be given to him).
,” his voice broke. He looked so sad, so devastated, it broke Tony's heart.
Especially lately, when it just wouldn't go away.
From the corner of his eye, Steve noticed Tony raise an arm above them. He tilted his chin up, following the slope of Tony’s limb and stopping at the bit of foliage hanging between his fingertips. A small smile started to paint itself across Steve’s lips.
After pulling some all-nighters to finish a college project, Steve accidentally sends his cute grad student professor Tony the wrong portfolio.
Steve couldn’t help the broad smile splitting his face as he watched his husband and daughter. He caught Tony’s gaze, and they just looked at each other in the middle of the busy airport before Steve bent down to kiss Tony one more time.
“What’s this about?” Tony whispered, leaning closer to the super-soldier.

Clint’s jaw dropped. “Did he just—”
around him, the very tip of it teasing at his weeping slit.
The team’s holiday celebrations were in full swing. The communal floor of Avengers Tower was decked out in festive décor, with reds, greens, and golds strung up all over. A comically large Christmas tree was sitting in the middle of the living room, covered in tinsel and garlands and multicolored lights and some hand-made ornaments that kids had given the team over the years. There was a blanket of fresh snow over the whole of Manhattan, providing the picturesque backdrop of a winter wonderland that Tony always loved about the season. With the entire team together for Christmas, Tony felt like it was going to turn out to be the most perfect one yet.
He needed to be alone with Tony, now.
A freaking bomb that was not quite nuclear yet it could still clearly level an entire city. It should not have been possible, the components inside that bomb not compatible to create such a thing yet there it was. Ticking. Melted to a wall. Fucking Doom and his fucking magic, because that was magic all right, nobody can tell Tony otherwise. He was a genius when it came to that stuff, after all.
Tony sighed, looked around and when he saw that there was no one there, he turned towards Steve fully and kissed him.
But that didn’t mean Steve had to like it.
Tony opened his eyes and looked at Steve, sheepish. "I might have... upgraded the code a little bit."
And he was gonna prove it dammit!
“Of course you did,” Tony said, fondly. “Still. Better safe than sorry.”
Steve had Tony in his arms, and he knew going forward that Tony would always be his friend. After spending years without him, this was enough. It might not be all he wanted, but it was enough.
“What? But I lied to you.”
“Hey, what a pleasant surprise,” he said. “If I knew you were coming, I’d prepare better.”
When he got to the Tower, he was unsure on what to do. The one elevator he knew would take him to Tony was the one that didn’t have a button. But before he could call Tony and ask him, the elevators opened on its own, right in front of him.
Once he was done he put the brush gently down. It was time. He was going to look at the canvas. He was going to answer the question he hadn't even known he had asked.
He cleared his throat after a few moments. “I’m not exactly sure where to start.”
“I do.”
Steve hated it, really.
So, it was only natural that the idea of Iron Man working so closely with his team did not make him happy.
"Everything okay?"
But Tony, as clouded as his mind was, didn't think about any of that. What he was thinking about was the need to prove himself, to show Steve that he was not useless without the suit, to erase all the times his dad told him he was not good enough, that he
Sometimes Steve had to deal with two cranky babies.
Steve headed quickly to see why he had Tony awake at this hour of the morning. Upon entering the nursery Steve was struck with a strong smell coming from Tony's diaper who was standing in his cradle holding the bars with one hand and the other Wanting his dad to lift him.
-Yes Daddy I’m ready, let’s go let’s go I want to play with Bucky-
Bucky and Tony play for a while before bedtime
then he put them in front of the TV with the bottles while he went to pack a bag with all the things they babies would need.
We are always gonna be friends. Forever.
"Yes dada"
The smile  in Loki face soon disappeared the moment he saw his daddy entering the nursery.
-Okay Tony lets get you ready-
-No!- Bucky yelled back
After the movie Eddie was sound asleep, Venom not that much he didn’t need it anyway so the symbiont with two tentacles start putting up the bed sheets over Eddie small body.
