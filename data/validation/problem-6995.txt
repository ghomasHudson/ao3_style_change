“Yeah, well, I hate yours, and you’ve been teasing me along for a week,” Steve said, the words almost a growl.  He pulled back, just far enough to see Tony’s face.  “A bit of payback, Mr. Stark.”
After a few seconds of squinting helplessly at it, he gave up and took a step back.  There was a small, white haired man behind the front counter, bent over an old fashioned ledger that he had spread out in front of him on the glass topped display case.  Tony tapped one finger on the window.  "Hi, you open?" he asked, when the man at the counter looked up.
“You’re cruel when you have reason,” Rhodey said.  “You don’t have any reason here, you’re just tormenting the man, and there’s no reason for it.”
“I hope you’re looking forward to that.” Harris loaded his tray up with a sandwich and a cup of cut vegetables.
They’d been slowed, just before a bridge crossing, by a herd of sheep, milling in and around the riverbanks.  Okoye, Bucky, Sam and Steve had plunged in, dragging panicked ewes back to the flock while Shuri had sat on the bridge, tossing pebbles to keep them out of deep water.  The shepherd, a shy, brawny girl of no more than fifteen or sixteen, had offered her a gift of soft, yielding cheese in thanks.
Steve reached for his water glass, his fingers just hovering over the surface of the crystal.  It wasn't right.  But he didn't know why.  He picked up his glass.  "Merry Christmas," he said, tapping the rim of his glass against Tony's.
He rested his elbow on the edge of the window, bracing his hand against his forehead.  “I don’t forgive him.  He was a lousy father, and I don’t want to do to my kid what he did to his.  But that’s harder than you’d think.  It’s harder than you think to disengage, and recognize the pattern and stop it.  Because to do that, you have to really understand that what happened to you was shitty, and I can say he’s a lousy father, but some part of me still wonders why I couldn’t be the perfect kid he could actually have loved.”
For a long, painful moment, Tony fantasized about just that.  About lifting his head just that inch, that fraction of an inch, and kissing him.  Kissing him until they both forgot where they were, forgot who they were, forgot all the reasons why this wasn't going to work, why they couldn't work together.
“Uh-huh.”  Steve opened up one of the storage bins above the seats.  “I’m not sure you’re going to be able to collect on that.”
There was a beat of silence, so complete that he could hear the girl breathing against his chest. And then the whole team started yelling at him at once.
“Grounded,” Rogers said, holding out a hand.  Furbro made the jump to DJ's shoulder, and DJ sighed, shrugging the backpack off of his shoulders.   He held it out to Rogers, who wrapped a hand around the back of his head and pulled him in, pressing a gentle kiss to his hair.  “Thank you.”
"Good try," Steve said, making another grab for his shirt, and Billy ducked under his hand, popping back up on the far side of Pepper. Steve gave him a look. "Billy."
“You have a fiance, and you’d murder me in under a month,” Tony told her.  He was fairly certain Jarvis was laughing as he left the room.  Tony took a seat at the workbench, his arms crossed over his chest.  “I’m not marrying you simply to annoy Obie.”
“It’s possible,” Steve agreed.  The grounds sped by, and he could see human forms there, creeping through the darkness.  “And the theater management knew who was coming, even if the low level staff didn’t know.  But the majority of the people who could place Tony Stark on that sidewalk tonight are his own people.”
Peter stared at him with haunted eyes, and there were tears pouring down his cheeks.  Tony took a breath, and another, trying to steady his racing pulse.  “What do you think, that I would prefer you have been, what, killed, trying to keep him safe?”  Peter’s mouth worked, and Tony leaned in.  “Is that what you think?”
“Well, I’d say that’s his problem, isn’t it?” Isaiah said with a puckish grin.  “Steve, maybe you should-”
The boy groaned, but he headed for the kitchen with a heavy tread.  “We're here to pick up bread, Gramps.”
Tony sucked in a long, slow breath. “First of all,” he said, his voice vibrating with something DJ didn’t understand, “why did no one see fit to tell me this?”
“You picked.  His pocket,” Hank said, his voice dire.  Tony stopped, and gave a broad, theatrical shrug.  Hank groaned.  “Tony.  He was leaving.  He was actively trying to leave.  And you not only stopped him from doing the thing we wanted him to do, which is leaving, but you stole from him!”
"Yeah, I'm weird like that."  Steve wandered forward, his hands tucked in his pockets, his body canted forward, relaxed and easy.  But there was a threat in each step, a hard, vicious intent.  "So what you're really getting at is this idea that bisexual people are predisposed to cheat, which seems to be built on the idea that they just have more choices in people to cheat with?"  He paused, his head tipped to the side.  "Which seems a sad way to think about it."  He leaned in, smooth and controlled.  "Don't you think?"
Tony didn’t bother with the lights, making his way to the grand hall by memory.  His footsteps echoed across the cavernous space as he sidestepped piles of boxes and past a rolled up rug.  It was a mess he didn’t want to deal with right now.
“Keep an eye on them,” he said, waving a hand towards the two unconscious men.  “The police’ll be here soon to pick them up.”
Franklin picked at the seam of his pant leg.  “I didn't know that was why,” he said.  His fingernail scraped against the thread, digging into the fabric.  He sat up and looked at his sister.  “How do you know that?”
Sam leaned back against a tree, his arms crossed over his chest.  “Feel free,” he said, his eyebrows arching.  “My orders were to bring him back.  You were never part of the deal.”
“Seriously.  I’ve been there.  I’ve learned about menu items from a Super Bowl commercial.  I’ve had some asshole in marketing decide that 2.5 million dollars in signage had to be discarded because ‘cheese stuffed’ didn’t play as well to focus groups as ‘mozzarella morsels.’  I’ve cooked some hellish stuff because the home office said that everyone was ‘doing’ kale despite the fact that, you know, fuck, no one wants ‘Krispy Kale Pizza.’”
“Don’t try me, I’ll do it,” Tony said, over the general cries of distress  There was a shuffling sound of the phone being handed over.  “Shut up, all of you!  It’s my car, I’ll talk about my dick if I want to!”
“What?”  Steve looked up.  “Oh.  Yes.”  He cleared his throat, once, and then again, before he forced the next words out.  “The Friends of the Brooklyn Public Library,” he read, “would like to thank you for your gift of a year long membership to the Brooklyn Children’s Museum.  This membership will be available to borrow on a rotating basis to anyone with a valid New York Library Card, and will be listed in the catalog as the James B. Barnes Memorial Membership.”
"Was that the 'don't punch a head of state' one or the 'mocking of others tech is only allowed when they're actively breaking one or more laws or international statutes' one?" Tony asked.
Tony slid onto the bike behind him, settling down onto the seat before pulling the helmet on.  He snapped it into place, his fingers steady on the strap.  Steve looked over his shoulder, his profile sharp against the setting sun.  “Ready?” he asked.
“No.  Something-”  DJ’s face scrunched up.  “There’s something hidden.”  His thumb smoothed against the paper, wrinkling it.  “Something-”
Steve took a deep breath.  “No.” His head tipped up, his eyes meeting Tony’s.  “But I felt I should give you the option.”
Steve looked at Bucky, who’d gone back to filling the bottles.  With a sigh, he turned back to Sam.  “We’re on our way.”
“Yes, ma’am,” Steve said, scrubbing the table down with quick, methodical movements.  She moved away, and he scowled down at the gleaming surface.  “I’ll be fine in a minute.”
"The point is, you are a clever man who will adapt.  I have a great deal of confidence in you," Jarvis said.
“I sense I've hit a nerve,” Bucky said, and Tony was laughing against Steve's shoulder, his fingers clinging to Steve's shirt.
Steve realized he was smiling down at his shoes.  "It was ONE TIME," he managed, and Sam punched him in the shoulder.
"Fine," Tony said. "We'll send you a nice thank you card, but one of my bots is doing my signatures.  Probably Dummy.  He's gotten pretty good at faking my signature for the FedEx guys."
“Way I see it, Tony,” he said, tapping his pencil against the pad, “it’s gonna cost you the same if you make one little boy happy, or a whole room full of people happy.”  He arched his eyebrows.  “So, which’ll it be?”
“We could go to the theater,” Jan said, interrupting him, and Tony was grateful for the excuse to stop talking.  She leaned over, meeting DJ’s eyes.  “Would you like to see the ballet?  Or go to the opera?”
“I’m sure,” Steve agreed.  He turned his attention back to the basket of apples.  “It was…  Quite the story.”
“Not necessary, but always appreciated,” Tony said.  Steve’s hands were creeping up under his shirt again, and Tony arched back.  “Leave it-  I’ve got-”
Something whipped through the air, a tendril of nothing lashing out, swallowing the last hint of DJ’s loosed power, and DJ scrambled back, his chair tipping as the back legs caught on the carpet.  For an instant, he hung in midair, his hands up in front of him, trying to ward it off, trying to hold it back, and whatever he wanted to say caught in his throat.
“Wait,” Tony said, squinting at Isaiah.  “You can control him.  You-”  He stabbed a finger at Isaiah.  “You can make him STOP.”
“All the best places do have a dress code,” Obie agreed.  He paused.  “Tony.  Have you considered what will happen if you do keep this child, and you can’t handle him?”
Tony waved him off.  “Fine,” he managed, but his head fell back against Steve's shoulder.  “I might not be  well, but I'm well medicated.”  He took a deep breath.  “Seriously.  Hipster porn.  This whole thing is like catnip to your people.  I'm going to take pictures of the kitchen and make an absolute killing.”
“Thank you,” Tony said, because Peter needed that, too.  He gave Mrs. Parker a lopsided smile.  “And you’ll keep an eye on both of them?”
It seemed wrong to ask, so wrong that he couldn’t even finish the thought, but Tony answered him anyway.  “A lot of nonsense,” he said, tapping the folded pages against his palm.  “That they’ve rooted out the vile nest of anarchists, that I’m safe at last, and all is well thanks to the heroic efforts of the New York Metropolitan Police.”
Jarvis was already moving, lifting one of the long lengths of wrought iron that were leaning against the wall next to the door.  "Yes, sir."
“I hope everyone's getting hazard pay for this,” Jess said.  She was wrapped in a pale teal silk that made her skin glow and her hair look like ebony.  “Especially for trying to make a move on Jessica.”
Ellen gave her a look.  Jesse grinned and took a seat on the end of the bed, crossing her legs under her.  “So after we finished at town hall and you came back here to write your story, I went down to talk to my source at the airport.”
“Acceptable,” the old lady said, reaching for the wooden bowl on the top of her stack.  She piled rice into it before reaching for her ladle.
There was a beat of silence, and then Sam settled down next to him on the bench, close enough that they were almost touching.  When Steve took a breath, his shoulder flexed against Sam's.  “Did you know that the man was a real priest?” Sam asked.  Steve shook his head.  “Or that it was a real license?”
They turned, and it was smooth and easy.  “Only you,” Steve breathed, and Tony laughed, soft and warm.
Steve couldn’t meet his eyes.  “Nothing,” he gritted out.  “I-”  He shoved a hand through his hair, frustrated beyond belief.  “I just made an ass of myself, so-” He thrust his hands out on either side of him, a sharp, hard gesture.  “Nothing new, Sam.”
Darcy stared at him.  “Well, that’s a choice you’ve made there,” she said, as every single person at all the tables around them stood as one and collected their trays.
She shrugged, and her shirt rippled with the movement of her shoulders.  “No one’s using it,” she said.  She reached up, pushing her hair back behind one pointed ear.  “Your hearing’s good.  Mine’s better.  I knew no one was in here.” She looked around.  “Besides, it’s just a locker room, right?”
“God, I hate this holiday,” Tony said, just to hear Steve laugh,  He arched up, his mouth catching Steve’s, letting the kiss linger.  “I’m closing for February next year.”
"You're a traitor, Queens," Tony muttered into Steve's shoulder.  "Back in the day, I could've had you killed for this."
"Also tea is horrible," Tony said.  He shifted in the seat, curling into the heavy weight of his jacket.  His eyes blinked, his gaze unfocused.  "Leaf juice."
Carol pulled up, her hands in glowing fists at her sides.  “Call it, Cap,” she said.  The wind ruffled her short blonde hair, but her gaze never wavered from the top of the warehouse.
"You can love someone, with your whole heart, and not be sexually attracted to them."  He smiled, just a little, a wry twitch of his lips.  "Sometimes, you love someone so much you think you can be something..."  He took a deep breath.  "Something that you're not, but something that you want to be."  He looked at the boy.  “Something you know you're supposed to be.”
Steve stood up, helping her pile the books up, and Miss Potts tried to wave him off.  “Finish your soup,” she said.  “Mr. Rhodes will be happy to help me bring everything up.”
Bucky’s shoulder rose in a shrug.  “One place is the same as any other,” he said, and Steve looked at him.  His face was expressionless, his mouth a tight line.  But his posture was relaxed, or as relaxed as he seemed to get, nowadays.
“Xavier's takes students as young as thirteen,” Franklin said.  He picked up one of DJ's tools, turning it over idly between his hands.  “I mean, earlier, sometimes.”
He turned towards the door.  “I’ll bring up breakfast soon.  Do try to get some rest while you can.  If we have any contact from the kidnappers, we will let you know.”
“All the better.” Happy straightened up. “Mr. Hammer! So you're my ticket to pretty girls and good times!” He thrust out a hand, catching Hammer's and pumping it up and down with a great deal of enthusiasm. Startled, Hammer just tried to hold on. “Knew you were a lucky fella, when I first saw you, I knew it.”
Ellen yawned, holding the photo back out to her.  "Nice work.  Good.  You should submit it somewhere.”
“I'd say Whitman might object to that, but-”  Steve made a humming noise. “Actually?  Probably not.”
“I don't see why not, a lot of people have, and their lives are probably better because of it,” Tony said.  He reached for a tray of fresh herbs.  “This was a good talk, this was good for us, I think we both understand everything that's happening, so-”  He gave her a bright, toothy smile.  “Good talk.  Let's never do it again.”
DJ nodded.  “No.  I like it.  It’s…”  He tried to line the nametag up on his chest.  “It’s me.”  He looked up.  “I’m an AI.  Or, I was.  Tony-” He took a breath.  “Tony Stark made me.  In Cambridge.  And then I was cursed by a witch, and that made me a person.”
“I told you that showing it to anyone else would probably be a bad idea?  Yeah,” Sam said, grinning.
DJ glanced up at him,, his eyes huge, dark holes in his pale face.  Tony waited, letting him process, until he finally shook his head.  Tony nodded, leaning forward in his seat.  “The things we make, the machines, they’re big and complex,” he said, bracing his elbows on his knees.  “Engines.  Generators.  Things like that.  And complex things fail in complex ways.”
“Put your feet down,” Jarvis said, not looking up from his work.   “I can’t keep you from gossiping, I can keep you from destroying the furniture.”  He smoothed the cloth along the curves of the teapot.  “I believe we should to take comfort from the fact that we are no longer working at cross purposes.”
DJ stopped.  Held the pamphlet in front of him, and then opened it.  “No.  It was right.  It was...”  He pulled the coupon out and held it up to the light.  Without looking up from his careful consideration, he held the pamphlet out to Tony, who took it.  DJ brought the page up, sniffing at it.
“But the guy I talked to last night said they'd managed to pay for the marriage licenses for eighty-nine couples yesterday, and yeah.”  She flopped over to the side to point at the picture.  “If you look in the background, you can see the priest?  So these two got married.  I mean.  Pretty sure they did.  The licenses that the couples signed will be official record today, so we'd have to check with the town hall to check and see.”
“Right,” Tony said.  “That’s.. Probably for the best.  And that was the way the night started.”  He took a deep breath.  “Is…  Is that the YouTube video?”
Harris nodded back.  “Okay. Okay.”  He bit his lip.  “Look, DJ.  When we’re scared, a lot of things go through our heads.  A lot of people do and say and think things, when they’re scared, that they wouldn’t, otherwise.  And when you were scared, you just wanted to be safe.”
“Get your own, Barton.” She opened up the packing box, pulling out chia pet after chia pet.  “Some of these are…”
“Excuse me,” Pepper said, on Rhodey's other side, “the promise of pastry is the only thing keeping any of us here.”  She smiled behind the rim of her champagne glass.  “Jan's been talking sweets with us for a week.”
“Yes, darling, he’s…  We’re donating freely to his opponent in the next election,” Tony said.  “He’s a soft touch, Ms. Blair.”
“Yes.”  Tony smiled.  “Do you want to marry me right now, Steve?  Because I like to think I know you pretty well, and you’re-”  His smile flickered and died.  “What’s wrong?”
Clea was reassembling the armor, the pieces floating in midair in front of her, her face as focused as if she was a child with a particularly clever jigsaw puzzle.  She raised one hand, a pale glow swirling around her fingertips as she rotated a gauntlet back into place.
Tony bit back a curse.  It was a stupid thing to say.  Childish.  Needy.  And he was too old, and too smart, to let it go any further, to get into a stupid discussion about the stupid things his head came up with.  If he had any sense, he’d end this now.  He could end this now, it wouldn’t even be hard.  A kiss.  The stroke of a hand.  A few whispered words.  He knew Steve, and Steve looked as wary as he felt, his expression guarded, his posture tense.
The word echoed inside the helmet, and a cursor flashed on the HUD.  No contact.  DJ took a deep breath, and another.  “No Jarvis.”  The words were jittery, uneven.  He nodded.  “Scan.  Find anything familiar, anything-”  The table he was under jolted as someone bumped it, and DJ jerked sideways, drawing his legs up and out of the way.  “Get me a network.”
“I wouldn’t put it past you,” Tony said.  He rolled to his feet, all feline grace and easy strength, and Steve’s shirt was just a bit too big on him, draping low around his hips and hands.  He didn’t seem to notice, or maybe he just didn’t care.  “I was cold, and it was convenient.”
“Drinking subpar coffee,” Tony said.  “In a desperate attempt at normality.  Before you ask, it didn’t work.”
Stark grinned at him.  "You meant what you said, my God, you really have no filter, do you?"  But he was still smiling when he went back to the file.  "And I meant, did the man you arrested have anything useful to say?"
“I suspect we won’t find a listing in the financial pages,” Jarvis said.  “But I also suspect that Miss Potts has ways around such a trifling problem.”  He leaned forward, picking up the decanter from the corner of Tony’s desk.  He flipped over two tumblers and filled each one with a hefty dose of amber liquid.  He offered one to Tony.  “But I don’t think that buying any number of orphanages will solve your problem, sir.”
"I'm sorry, ma'am," Steve said, his brow furrowing. "How old are you?" She blinked at him, and he tipped his head forward. "Because you're talking like you've been around for a hundred years, and you're confused by the rapid change to social norms." He stopped. "Wait, that'd be me."
Tony glanced at him.  Stark was staring at Rogers’ back, his jaw set in tight lines.  Tony gave a quick shake of his head.  “Yeah, you fucked up my robot, Stark.”
She winced.  "Well, he wasn't.  Didn't.  But he kind of-" She stopped, took a deep breath.  "He kind of thought they were dating?"
“It’s hard to separate the rumors from the facts, but I’m used to that,” Bobbi said.  “Men who trade in bad behavior like to inflate their victories, and their enemies’ misfortune.” She pulled a sheet of newsprint from the folder.  She held it up in front of her, her chin tipped a curious angle.  “And it’s hard to find anyone who’s willing to talk, outside of the bad elements.
Shuri peeked at her from under her fingers.  “I should find it easier to bear the grief if there was-”
“Only ones made by Nazis, I think yours is safe,” Steve said, with an easy going smile.  Tony caught himself smiling back, despite his headache.  “But your phone is starting to annoy me, so I might be tempted.”
"You have a medical check today, right?" Jan asked, her hands on her hips.  Steve nodded.  "Good.  Tonight.  Put those on.  Find a book.  Relax.  Wait."
“Also not the first time I’ve heard that,” Steve said.  He rubbed his hands against his legs, trying to get feeling back into his fingertips.  “I don’t think I will be, though.  And you don’t, either, do you?”
Tony started to laugh, the sound muffled against Steve’s shoulder.  “Did I mention I was barefoot and not wearing any underwear?” Steve added.
There was a loud crash from the general direction of the bathroom.  There was a long pause.  “Where the fuck am I?” Clint yelled.
Steve stared at him, his eyebrows arched.  “I wouldn't have taken you for a fella who likes musical theater,” he said.
“What-”  That was as much as he got out before the form crashed towards him, hitting him hard, knocking him backwards.  Peter stumbled, his shoulder smacking against the bannister, and he grabbed for it, pushing himself back to his feet as the man rushed out of DJ’s room, heavy feet making the floor underneath them both shake.
Steve exhaled.  “No,” he said, and the way that Tony had looked around his flat made sense now.  He waited for the door to be shut behind Tony before he moved to the other side of the car, sliding into the back seat next to Tony.  He glanced over as Happy started the car.  “I would’ve gotten word to you, if he’d shown up here.”
Which is why he kept it up, despite its horrible design.  He hated the fountain, all those finicky little pipes and delicate findings, all the pieces that had to be cleaned and maintained, and replaced with alarming frequency.  But when he turned it on, watching the marble basin fill with water, he could almost hear his mother's voice, the soft, sweet sound of her Italian lullabies and the even sweeter sound of her laughter.  So he fixed it, every time it failed, every time it clogged, every time it overflowed.
“Glad I can help,” Steve said, his hands on Tony’s ass.  Laughing, Tony gave a little hop, wrapping his legs around Steve’s waist.  Steve took his weight without even seeming to notice it, kicking the front door shut behind them as he stormed towards the bedroom.
“Tony?”  Rhodey's voice cut into his thoughts, and that was enough to shake some of the tension out of his shoulders.  “What time is it?  Are you all right?  Is there-”
Steve was starting to suspect Stark Manor had it's own hidden currents, just below the calm surface, and all of them were dangerous.
“Gimbels was a bit overwhelming,” Jarvis said.  “And we agreed that perhaps an early dinner was in order.”  He pulled his watch from his vest pocket, flicking it open with a brisk movement of his wrist.  “Perhaps at six pm, if Mrs. Parker and Chef can manage it.”
"Okay, right, now we know that was a good idea, brilliant, really, but, wanna tell me why?"  Tony could feel the rhythm of Steve's breathing, his chest flexing against Tony's back.  It was comforting in a way he didn't really want to examine.  “You've never refused to honor an active code before, it's rather counter to your programming, so why-”
Tony nodded.  “Right,” he said.  He took a breath, and his ribs ached.  He let his eyes fall shut.  “I can’t-”  His throat closed around the words.
"Or he's a mortal man and your life is beyond his comprehension," Steve said, just to make him laugh again. It worked, and he stifled an irrational sense of pride. “Why did you even bother humoring him?” he asked. “You don't seem the sort to suffer fools gladly.”
Obie nodded, tucking his hands in his pockets.  “Well.  When you figure it out, do let me know what your plans will be.”
Steve stared up at him, his mouth working helplessly.  Tony grabbed him by the front of the sweater.  “Did you-  You gave me roses.”  He leaned in, urgent about it.  “Those were my roses.”
“It would also explain how the kidnappers got into the house,” Steve said.  “I’m assuming Stane has a key.”
“Not that I know of, but he’s been a fixture in that house longer than any of us, and I got no idea the last time the locks were changed,” Happy said.  His hands flexed on the steering wheel, his knuckles going white.  “And he sure as hell has something to lose if the boss’s will changes.”
Steve pinched the bridge of his nose, wondering if this is what insanity felt like.  “Carol, can you please-”
“Maybe better.”  Tony reached up with his free hand, hooking a finger in the neck of Steve’s t-shirt.  Steve came willingly, until his lips were hovering just a breath from Tony’s.  “You didn’t hear it from me, though.”
“Didn't you?”  He didn't even think, it was just instinct, his hand reaching out, his fingers stroking over DJ's hair.  But DJ leaned into the contact, his eyes closing for an instant.  “Well, that's disappointing.”
"It's a lie that most drunk people tell themselves," Tony said.  "I, meanwhile, am actually just as charming as I think I am."
“No,” Fury and Tony said at once, and they looked at each other with identical expressions of confusion.
Steve took a sip of his coffee.  “Thing I’ve learned about easy money,” he said, “is that the two words don’t go together as often as we think.”
“I helped him get you into the bathroom and got your shoes and shirt off and kept you from trying to drink Steve’s shampoo, because you said anything that smelled that good couldn’t REALLY be poisonous,” Peter babbled.  “And I was like, no, bad idea, but you’re a lot stronger than you look-”
“Yeah, I have zero time for my Tony’s bullshit, and you’re going to be gone in like 48 hours, so I sure as hell don’t have time for yours,” Harris said.  He stopped, his stomach sinking.  “Oh, God.  I claimed a Tony Stark.”
“In that case, please send her my apologies,” Steve said, with a faint smile.  “I've got other plans.”  With a brisk nod in their direction, he headed for the door.
Pepper straightened back up, hovering a fingertip over the gleaming surface of her tablet.  “Check the database.”
Steve watched him go, and when the door shut behind him, he relaxed back against the headboard, his hand stretching out to cover Tony’s.
And Steve was happy now, but sooner or later, he was going to find someone, someone he wanted, someone he loved, and Tony was too old to just sit back and enjoy the ride.  He knew too much about the crash landing waiting for him to just live in the day, live in the moment.
“I have not,” Steve said, smiling down at the screen.  “I went down to the gym for a few hours to…” He struck the enter key with a little too much force.  “Work off some aggression.”
“I know.  That's why I'm not doing that right now,” Pepper said.  “It's just a charity thing, please, Tony?”
Steve struggled to find something to say to that, but she didn’t seem to be interested in a response.  She leaned a hand on his bicep and brushed a light kiss across his cheek, and both Luke and Danny  fell silent.  Jessica took a step back.  She patted Steve lightly on the chest.  “Beat that, boys,” she said.
“That won’t be necessary.” Tony picked up the envelope, catching a glimpse of her understated name tag.  “Monique, is it?”
“I can open it on Tony's phone, I think, I-” He grabbed Tony's phone, checking if the password Tony had given him still worked.  It did, and he let out a relieved breath.  “Yes.  I can open it up.  Have him call again?”
Tony straightened up, letting the water roll down his neck and over his chest.  He braced his hands on the sides of the sink, holding on like it was the last lifeline he possessed.  “And it's easier to drown myself in the sink,” he gritted out.  He blinked at his reflection in the mirror, all huge, dark eyes and chalk white skin.  “Jay, how badly did I embarrass myself?”
Her eyes went wide for a moment, a look of pure pleasure sweeping over her face, and for an instant, he could see how young she really was, beneath the weight of her life.  Her smile was bright as she took the box from him.  She braced her baby on one hip, weighing the tin with her others.  “Are you sure?” she asked, looking up at him.  “Gingerbread’ll keep, if you make sure it’s sealed tight.”
Jarvis blinked at him.  "With all due respect, Officer, I prefer to focus on whatever is most comfortable for you.  After all-"
“I didn’t bring him,” Strange said, reaching for the scroll.  She swept it out of his reach.  “He jumped into the portal after me.”
“It's a good weapon,” he said, going back to his soup.  It was silken and creamy in his mouth, warm and salty, richer than the potato soups he'd known as a boy, but somehow, still the same. He glanced up at Miss Potts.  “Familiar.”
There was a small lamp on the bedside table, one he'd picked up at a street fair a few years back.  Steve flicked it on, and crouched down beside the bed, aiming the phone in Tony's direction.  He was snoring quietly now, his face flushed, his damp hair flopped over his forehead and his arms wrapped tight around a pillow.  Steve smiled at him, his chest aching.  He reached down, tugging the blankets up over Tony's shoulder, and Tony mumbled into his pillow, his nose wrinkling.
“Well, fuck,” Harris said aloud.  Neither of them seemed to hear.  Or care.  He pulled his phone out.  Opened up his texts, and stared down at a selfie of Darcy, Wanda, Clint and DJ in wildly overblown flower crowns.
"Shouldn't you be at a factory or office somewhere?" he asked, tucking his hands in his pockets before he strolled down the stairs.  "I'm fairly certain that you should be-"
“Fine, you can tag in your replacement,” Jan said, waving at Tony.  “Despite his usual diet, he does actually have a very refined palette.”
By the time he returned to the laundry yard, he’d gotten a good idea of where the guards had been posted, where they patrolled, and which ones were actually paying attention.  The man by the kitchn door was tall and broad, with a nose that had been broken a few times, and a sharp look in his eye.  The first time he’d seen Steve emerge from the house, he’d straightened up, hand going to the nightstick hanging from his belt.  Unlike some of the men posted out by the walls, it was clear this one took his task seriously.
“He wanted me lost,” DJ said, and neither of them asked who 'he' was.  DJ was glad.  He wasn't sure he could explain without losing track of the words.  He didn't have words for most of this.  He was making it up as he went along.  “He wanted me gone.  So he lost me.  Dad found me.  It's okay.  Creat-” He stopped, his nose wrinkling.  “My dad found me.”
“Want to put money on that?  Because I’m willing to put money on it.”  Tony ducked under the counter, digging out his toolkit from behind a pile of ruined clockworks.  “Five’ll get you ten that the next time you see him, he’ll be in uniform, and that’s a whole other mess for us to deal with.”
"Yes.  You are.  Good.  For you.  I've heard good things.  That said?  I am not part of this conversation," she said.  "You two better finish this up fast, Natasha lays traps when she's bored."
The door opened, and Jarvis stepped aside, letting DJ come bouncing past him.  “We are ready for swimming time,” Jarvis said, his voice calm.
“I’m TRYING,” Happy said, his voice indignant.  He took an awkward sidestep and Clint had to scramble to keep his feet intact.
A lone man was seated at the table in the rear of the room, his booted feet outstretched towards the hearth.  The fireplace cast heavy shadows across the worn wooden floor and equally worn furniture.  A heavy tankard sat, seemingly forgotten, next to the man’s elbow, but his plate was bare, except for a few crusts of bread and a bit of cheese.
“That was the prevailing theory, yes?” Rhodey asked, setting his cap on top of the car.  He was getting real sick of running the gauntlet of guards between the street and the house.  “Don’t tell me-”
Marcy appeared just behind him.  "We have guests incoming," she said, one eyebrow arching.  "Ready for the receiving line?"
“Fine,” Tony said.  He pushed himself upright.  “Jarvis, please inform the parasites that live in my tower that their presence is expected, otherwise, they will disappoint the child, and I will have no choice but to murder them.”
He couldn’t see her face, but he got the feeling she was smiling.  “What do you know,” she said.  “Bobbi works just fine, no matter if people are expecting a man or a woman.  Follow my lead.  That’ll be fine.”
A little hand crept out from under the workbench, fingers tugging on the paper, dragging in the pencil towards the edge.  Struggling not to laugh, Tony ducked down.  “Got you,” he said, meeting DJ’s eyes from the other side of the workbench.  “Where are my tools, you little urchin?”
“First of all, no one wants yout corn dogs, Barton, and second of all, there’s a whole buffet out there, you can get more.”
"I know," Sam said.  He crossed the room and lowered himself into the chair next to the bed, facing Tony.  He folded his hands on his lap.  "I know you don't.  I know you're stressed, and I know you're not comfortable with dealing with this kind of shit."
Steve shook his head  “Nothing.  I just-” He managed a smile.  “It was just nice.  The sandwich offer, I mean.”  He looked back at the webpage.  “Can I have a ham and cheese?”
Steve kissed his neck again.  “I love you,” he said, and Tony's shoulders twitched.  Steve smiled against his skin.  “I love you.”
“I don’t want to,” Tony said.  “As soon as I open this box, Christmas is over forever.  There will be no more Christmas.”
“Maybe don't go to jail?” Natasha suggested.  Her hands were still on her weapon, her fingers just ghosting over the gleaming surface of the metal.  She looked up, and her eyes were locked on Gyrich, not Clint.  “Have you considered maybe not going to jail?”
He tapped the surface of his phone with a flick of his thumb.  “Did you tell her you were dying?” he yelled.
Natasha didn’t look up from her phone.  “I choose my alliances based on who’s offering me the better samosas,” she said, her voice bored.
DJ blinked at him, slow and deliberate, like a camera shutter flicking shut.  He didn't say anything, barely breathed, but some of the strain bled out of his shoulders.
Steve made a thin, strangled sound, and then he was moving, fast, almost running down the stairs, carrying Tony with him. Tony buried his face in Steve's shoulder and enjoyed the ride. It was hard and rough, just the way he liked it.
“Too late,” Clint said, swinging the car into a wide turn and heading them off the strip.  “Magicon time, everyone!”
Tony leaned over, peering past the couch.  Peter was curled into a ball under a too-small throw blanket, half under the coffee table.  Tony braced both hands on the back of the couch, leaning his weight into them.  “What…  What is he doing?  I have…  I have other furniture, Parker.  I have other BEDROOMS, why are you-”  His head fell forward, and he took a deep breath.  “Rhodes.  Why is the child on the floor?”
“Gotcha,” Darcy said, and Harris got the idea that she did, in fact understand.  Even stranger, he kind of understood as well.
Sam didn't break eye contact with Steve, even as he set his running shoes down on the edge of the bench.  "Pretty good.  You know.  Secret Agent love lives, never a dull moment."  He paused, one eyebrow arching.  "In that Abby's a secret agent."
He wasn't sure what he was feeling.  Numb, mostly.  Like none of this was happening, or if it was, that none of it mattered.  Which was wrong, of course, it was happening.  And it definitely mattered.  He knew that, on some level.  But that level seemed far off, a purely intellectual exercise of knowing.  Of realizing.
The man was huge, towering over Jarvis, and almost twice as wide at the shoulder.  His blond hair was tied back at the name of his neck, leaving strands trailing over his forehead and around his face, and his beautifully tailored suit was just as disordered, the shirt open at the neck and the jacket unbuttoned.  But he as grinning, wide and real, his eyes dancing.  "Ah!"  He clapped Jarvis on the shoulder.  "My friend, how I've missed you and your wit."
“I don't want to die,” she said, and the words were thin and small.  But her hands clung to his, her grip painful.
But where ever the damn Sentinels were today, they were not hovering above Avengers Tower.  They weren't waiting at the edge of the property, looming over the street like grotesque, modern gargoyles.  The world went on, as it always did, cars creeping along through the congested streets and people hustling along the sidewalks, often outpacing the vehicle traffic.
Natasha looked up, and realized that the cop was staring right at them, his eyes narrowed against the afternoon sunlight.  She nodded.  “I think it's time to tell Coulson.”
Clint grumbled a random string of syllables, and Tony waited patiently for Natasha to translate absolutely nothing.  “Do we have something to share with the class?” he asked, and his French wasn’t particularly good, but at least it was Goddamn French.
“I'm afraid she had a meeting this morning,” Jarvis said.  There was a faint smile hovering around the corners of his mouth.  He held out a hand.  “But I'm sure that Mr. Stark will be pleased to hear what you've discovered.”
“Twelve, actually, the parking garage is under the building,” Steve said. He glanced over his shoulder at Tony, and his smile was wicked and hot and worth everything. “I love you.”
Steve bit his lip to keep from smiling. "That's... A fairly common opinion, actually," he said. Tony gave him a look, and he shrugged, unrepentant. "You get used to him."
“Why would I let him do-” Steve started, realizing his error only when Tony snagged a box from the shelf.  “Actually, now that you mention it, I’m sure he did.”
“My car rental, I’m going to,” Tony said, and that didn’t make sense to DJ, but Tony had a look on his face, a look almost like the ones his father got, when things weren’t right, and weren’t wrong, and DJ was having trouble keeping things separate in his head and he hated it.
Steve smiled at him. "You know, you're right," he said, relaxed and easy. "I'm the last one who should be complaining about oppression. As things go, I get off light." He shook his head. "The other day, someone said something..." He paused. "Is 'horrifically homophobic' the right turn of phrase?" he asked Victor.
Darcy propped her hands on her hips with a grin, her chin up and her shoulders back.  It was a pose that did good things for her figure.  “What do you think?”
Laughing, Steve let her push him along, doing his best not to trip over his own feet.  “Help,” he said to Clint as they passed.
This time, he held up a coffee mug that said, ‘You don’t have to be crazy to work here, but you will be soon enough.’  “It’s true, but but I think that HR would frown on me adapting it as our new recruitment strategy.
Tony rolled hard, cutting between two buildings, finding a space so narrow that he could if he'd rolled flat, his shoulder would've clipped the masonry.  “Coulson, tell me you've found out something about this.  Please.  You can make me happy very easily here, just tell me-”
Clint pointed a finger at her.  “Right.  I accept this mission.”  He disappeared back into the kitchen.
“Right,” Harris said.  He gave the cat another cautious scritch between its shoulder blades and it hunkered down again, paws flexing on the arm of the couch.  DJ tried not to look at its claws.   “So…  You sent him the money to finish his game.”
“Every damn chance I get.” Tony glanced up, meeting Steve’s eyes, and he went still.  “Oh,” he said, and the single word was soft, hanging in the air between them.  “That was…  That was a real question.”  He set his coffee cup down on the counter.  “Yes.  I suppose I was.”  He looked at Steve, his brows drawn up tight.  “Is…  Is that a problem?”
“Daaaaarling.” Jan swept into the workshop, a napkin covered basket thrown over her arm and her long silk scarf floating through the air behind her.  “Tony, light of my life, how are you?”  She braced a hand on Tony’s chest, going onto her toes to brush a kiss against each of his cheeks.  “Sorry to keep you waiting, I just had to have a chat with Bobbi about that last bottle she sent home with me.  Potent stuff, I must have more.”
“Which is why I think he should do it, not me,” Darcy pointed out.  “And you find trouble faster than anyone I know, Harris.”
The wave of relief that rolled over him was enough to leave him gasping for breath.  He nodded, his head still supported by Steve’s fingers.  “If we…  Go far enough.”
He’d drawn Peter and DJ in the act of collecting pears from one of the trees down in the orchard.  Peter was perched on a branch, a basket propped on his hip, a bare foot braced against the tree trunk.  Above him, DJ was tangled in the limbs, his suspenders hanging down around his hips, pears piled high in fabric of his shirt.  It was a rough sketch, more for composition and placement, but there was a warmth to it, a feeling of youthful freedom that shone through, even in the simple, straightforward lines.
“If you don't mind,” Jarvis said, his voice amused. “The garage floor is currently empty. When you are ready to move, I can seal the doors to make sure there is no further access. Escort sir to the elevator, and I will make it an express straight to the penthouse.”
“I know,” Sue said, smiling to take the sting out of the words, “that's why I stop paying attention, Tony, it takes you a while to get around to your point.”
“So this was our last ditch attempt to keep him from trying to find out what was happening for himself,” Bobbi said.  “If we come back empty handed tonight, he’ll be the one following you next time, and I don’t think you want that.”  She was so close that he could feel the heat of her body.  “Do you?”
Nebula opened her desk drawer. “I got half a bag of off brand Bugles,” she said, holding them up.  “Expiration date unknown.”
“Know what I’m going to do?” Tony pointed the fork at him.  “I’m going to go down to that butler’s pantry of yours and take a prybar to every single dish you have squirreled away down there.  You’ll get up tomorrow morning and it’ll just be a pile of china shards.  See what you do then.”
“I'm fine.”  The words floated out of the kitchen, and Steve sprinted in that direction, the laundry basket tumbling from suddenly numb fingers.
Harris leaned back against his kitchen counter.  “Well, he walked into my apartment, took his shoes off, asked if he could take a shower and borrow a shirt.  Now he’s lying on the floor of my living room, eating Trix directly out of the box, and letting my cat lick water out of his hair.”
“I mean, I considered it, but I was assured you had your shit together,” Steve said, ducking around a table.  “Why would you need-”
“A story.  Well.  Let’s see.  An old one, from the old country.  My ma told me, and her Ma told her, to stick to the paths,” Steve said, a hint of a brogue coloring the words.  “Hold fast your name.  Eat only the food you carry with you, and never take from a hand you do not know.  Never step into a ring of mushrooms.  Carry a bit of cold iron with you at all times, held close to your heart.”
“Consider it a side hustle,” Pepper said.  “Fifty dollars cash now, fifty more if you get him back to his apartment tonight without he or Rhodey causing any major disasters.”
Steve was already shaking his head, pacing along the length of the sidewalk.  “Keep it.  Your boys need it more than I do,” he said.
Bobbi shook her head.  “I could use one myself.”  She looked at Steve.  “Let’s go, Officer.  Looks like you’re being offered the good stuff.”  She headed across the foyer, long-legged and easy, her hands tucked in her pants pockets, leaving Steve scrambling to catch up.
He looked up, and he was smiling, his face relaxed, his eyes dancing.  “If it went missing, everyone knew where to check.”  He held the bowl of tortellini out to Tony. “What's yours?”
“How-”  Ellen took a deep breath.  “We know that Rogers and Stark left the US; they're listed on a government envoy release.  We know that there's a flight plan filed that shows them en route to Latveria.  We know that as of last night, Latveria's borders are closed, though no one knows why-”
Luke’s teeth flashed, and he snapped the stick in half with one hand.  “Put your money where your mouth should be.”
“I absolutely told him that,” Bobbi said.  “In short, not so polite words.  But I had him on one side of me, and Happy on the other, and Rhodey watching me in the rearview mirror with the sort of expression that made it clear that even if I did get out of the car, he’d be more than happy to back up over me.” She braced a hand on the doorframe, her thumb stroking over the silky wood.  “And where could I go, even if I got out?  My mother made it clear I wasn’t welcome in her home.  And I never had any illusions about Fisk and his people.  They wouldn’t have dropped a dime to spring me.”
Steve pushed himself to his feet, dusting his hands against his thighs.  “There’s a river not far from here,” he said, and he was pretty sure he believed it.  “Give me the flasks, I’ll fill them.”
Together, they emerged from the space below the stairs, Rogers leading the way with DJ cradled in his arms.  Pepper was coming down the stairs, and she stopped dead, her hands flying to her mouth.  “Oh, thank God,” she said.
“Relationship,” Steve said, because there was no point in pretending otherwise, not now.  He fiddled with the glasses.  “I don't think these suit me, Jan.”
"And he's a right wing, homophobic twit," Tony said, ignoring the spike of panic that shot through him. He stared at his phone. "Marcy, what the hell-"
Bobbi shrugged, the spoon still tucked between her lips.  “Finding bread seemed like too much trouble.”  She set the jar down on the top of the wall and boosted herself up to sit next to Natasha, her long legs dangling down the other side.  “What is he doing?” she repeated, digging the spoon back into the jar.
“I am going to throw a slice of cheese at your head, I swear,” Steve said.  He squared his shoulders and focused on his notes.  He was not going to be defeated by a damn bakery website.  “Hey Tony?”
“I can't, I have a thing, Pepper-”  Steve arched an eyebrow at him, his head tipping forward, and the other shoe dropped with a resounding thud in Tony's head.  “She set me up.”
“I love engineering, and numbers are an unfortunate part of engineering,” Tony told him.  “And really-”
The folded piece of paper from his inner jacket pocket was different, a higher quality of paper, heavy and stiff.  He unfolded it, awareness sweeping over him as he smoothed it flat again.  Their 'marriage license.'
“Okay,” he said, holding up his hands.  “Okay.  Let’s just-” He huffed out a breath.  “Let’s just get some rest, it’s been-  It’s been a hell of a day.”
He shook his head.  “Right,” he muttered under his breath.  “Silence.  That’s what you’re after, Rogers.  Right. Pull the other one.”
Laughing, Steve headed to the door.  He paused, hand on the doorknob, staring down at himself for just a second.  Barefoot, wearing what was clearly yesterday's pants and a white undershirt, he was wasn't exactly presentable, but he was pretty sure the room service waiter had seen worse.
“Let's just say that we had a problem holding onto gear,” he said, his eyes dancing.  “And you can eat a lotta stuff with two relatively straight sticks.”  He tapped the tips of his chopsticks together with a grin.  “Who taught you?”
Tony grabbed another crab rangoon.  “Don't really remember,” he admitted.  “Probably just one of those things I had to know before I was allowed to join my parents at the really fun restaurants.”  He took a bite, savoring the combination of crisp shell and creamy filling.  “But I really got good at it when I was at MIT.”  He popped the other half into his mouth.  “Boston had some very nice dim sum places.  If you could behave yourself, you might get someone who spoke the language to take you along.”
DJ lunged forward, his arms going around Steve’s waist in a death grip.  Caught off guard, Steve steadied him, his free hand going to DJ’s head.  “Hey,” he whispered, ignoring the way the simple word broke.  “Deej.  It’s okay.  It’s going to be okay, Deej, I promise, it’s going to be fine.”  He stroked DJ’s hair back from his face.  “I can get your dad.”
“Before it was fifty percent your problem,” Tony said, taking the jar from Fury and stabbing an egg with a tiny plastic cocktail sword.  “But you’re an idiot, and now it’s one hundred percent your problem.”
Steve clapped a hand over his face. “You're both ridiculous,” he said, tossing his sketchbook to the side. “You are both the most ridiculous people, and I'm giving you a run for your money.” He leaned back. “Okay. I fucked this up, didn't I?”
But when Tony pulled away, he was breathing hard, his pulse throbbing in his ears like he'd just done ten rounds in the suit.  Steve blinked at him, his long lashes fluttering, and Tony caught himself grinning.  "Sorry," he said, the words almost lost in the cheering of the crowd.  "I've got a reputation to maintain."
Tony shivered, his hair falling over his forehead, and Steve stepped in front of him, blocking the wind.  “You can still do that,” he said.  “I can help.  Pepper’s…”  He paused, and smiled.  “Pepper knows her way around a bureaucracy, let’s put it that way.  We might be able to make it legal.”
Ellen waited.  It was futile, and she knew it, because Jesse could outstare a stone statue.  But she hated giving in so quickly.  “Since when do you have a source at the fucking Symkaria airport?”
“I’m considering crying in public is what I’m considering.”  She braced a hand on the end of the pew.  “I work for a 24 hour wedding chapel in Vegas, you really think I’m not already knee deep in the mystic arts?”
“Does it better?” Steve repeated.  “It’s… Filling a tub with water, isn’t it?  How can he be better than you at turning a tap?”
Laughing, Steve leaned over to brush a kiss on her cheek.  “I never doubted it,” he said, affection sweeping over him.  “Now, stop harassing the team.”
“Yeah, just like Strange, I’m not looking forward to explaining to your father what happened to you, when he inevitably shows up.”  He took a sip of the juice. “Because I know just how stubborn I am when I decide something needs doing, and I know what I’m like when I’m in a bad mood.”
To the man's credit, he didn't even blink.  “Of course.”  He came out from behind the counter, his shoulders hunched forward as he flipped through a massive ring of keys.  “What can I show you?”
There was a chaise inside, far enough from the door to muffle the sounds from the foyer.  Tony headed for it.  “A cup of water, please,” he said.  The boy nodded, and disappeared back through the door.  Left alone, Tony lowered himself down onto the chaise cushions.  “All right,” he said, trying to sound calm.  “All right.  We’re all right.  You’re all right.  You’re safe.”
Darcy took the map away from Clint.  “Because once you left, Georgie mentioned that she really loved your costume.”
Everyone went silent.  As one, every adult in the room turned to look at DJ, who was sitting quietly at the diagnostic station, a screwdriver in his teeth and a drill resting on one upraised knee.  He made a minute adjustment to the shoulderplate he was working on, his eyes narrowed and his fingers steady.
“It’s…  It’s two,” he said.  He paused, his mouth working.  “How… Many have you done at once?”  He stopped.  “Wow. that came out wrong.”
DJ giggled, and Tony unfolded the note, trying to keep a straight face.  'Have to pick up the updated blueprints from corp.  Will tell Jarvis to make sure you eat.  It's sad that I have to have Jarvis handle that.  Try to eat without being reminded.'
Tony stared at him.  “Wow.  You've found a really clever way to cover 'we've built a giant robot and we plan on using it to hunt down mutants.'”  He nodded.  “That's...  That's some excellent PR babble.  Makes you sound almost noble.”
"No, sir, I'm your state assigned guard."  Rogers leaned a palm on the edge of the workbench, the muscles of his arm bunching beneath the thin fabric of his shirt.  "My job, so my Captain tells me, is to keep any harm from coming to you."
“We do try to keep the kicking of puppies and shoving of old ladies on the down low,” Tony said.  “I don't know how much spin we can really do here-”
“His word is worth more than your coin,” she said, filling a second bowl with a healthy serving of rice, and pouring a ladle of chopped meat and vegetables over the top.  She held it out to Steve with a wide grin.  ‘But if you like it, I’ll gladly empty your purse the next time you’re hungry.”
DJ nodded.  “I know.”  He stretched out his legs and wiggled to the edge of the bed.  “Love you, too.”
“Really,” Tony said, staring down at DJ.  DJ grinned up at him, his lips and chin stained red with cherry juice.  “I see we’ve had an unfortunate accident.”
“He’s usually right, that’s the problem,” Clint mused from his side of the bowl.  He poked at the flame in the center with his straw.  “He’d be less annoying if he was less right.”
Rogers' eyes flicked up, then back down to his plate.  “So kind o' you t' say so,” he said, a hint of a stage brogue twisting the words.  “Right kind o' you, gov'ner.”
Tony took a breath, and his chest ached with the force of it.  “No one leaves the grounds until further notice,” he said, his voice quiet.  “Make sure the foreman knows, if he can’t account for his men, he’ll be held responsible in their stead.”
His eyes snapped open, and he found Sam right in front of him, his hands held out, almost, but not quite touching his shoulders.  Sam gave him a reassuring smile.  "I need you to breathe, Steve," he said, his voice gentle.  "Because if you pass out on me, I'm going to have to either let you faceplant or try to catch you, and you're out of my weight class, man.  We do this, you're going to end up on the ground."
His stomach churned.  “Happy and Clint needed to beat us back.” His fingers flexed on his thighs, going into hard fists.  “To tell him what happened.” He shifted in his seat, the need to move almost unbearable.  “I’m surprised you trusted them to do it.”
Tony paused, his smile fading, going thin for an instant.  But it was just for an instant, and then his smile was back, just as wide and not nearly as real.  “Everyone loves him,” he said.  “But yes.  For the record.  I love him.”
Jan gave him a bright smile.  “Thank you,” she said, digging into his contacts.  Without another words, she turned on her heel, heading up the hall at a brisk pace.  In a moment, she was gone.
“I didn’t think so.”  Tony’s eyes opened, and Steve lost his breath again.  “I am…” His shoulders flexed, his hands braced on the back of the couch.  “I’m careful around you.  Because if I’m not-”  He laughed, and it was hard and sharp and held an edge that Steve didn’t understand.  “You kissed me.”
Jan was undeterred.  “Do we liiiiiiiiike him?” she asked, weaving her fingers together under her chin..
“That, he already knows.”  With one last nod, Strange turned, and disappeared into the glowing portal.
“Cool, I’ll tag you on the pics,” she said, settling back in her chair, her arms wrapped around the box.  “Who’s next?”
Carol leaned back against the lockers, her hips canted forward.  “Next time?  Ask us.” She gave a firm nod.  “We have lots of advice.”
“I know you are, it’s just…”  Tony’s voice trailed off as the door to the costume shop opened.  Clint ducked out, a tiara on his head and arms full of bags, and Tony gave him a look.
“I cannot wait for you to get your comeuppance,” Steve said, reaching for his coffee cup. “I cannot wait.”
Clint clapped his hands, startling both of them.  “Focus here, geniuses.”  He leaned a hand on the table.  “Deej.  What are we looking for, here?”
“Right, the Cliff’s Notes version,” Tony said, rubbing his forehead.  “DJ’s apparently apprenticing himself to his universe’s Stephen Strange.  Who came looking for him, but for some reason, DJ wasn’t able to utilize the portal he’d created to bridge our worlds.”  He took a deep breath.  “DJ thinks that our Strange might be able to shed some light on the situation, but he’s AWOL.”
Tony blinked at him.  “It's not that I don't want to get into bed with you,” he said.  “It's more that I do not want him to win, and by letting him have the couch, he wins.”
By the time they reached the kitchen, Tony had drunk DJ’s juice, DJ was clinging to his back like a monkey, and Tony a pencil behind each ear.  He would’ve worried about that, but judging by the hubbub coming from the kitchen, no one was likely to notice.
“Well, I walked over to the sidelines, and I got my phone out of my bag and I texted her, ‘I’m free on Tuesday,’ and I can see her, I can still see her, and she stops.  Pulls out her phone.  Looks at it.  Texts me back.” She nodded, her expression serious.  “And it was a single letter.  ‘K.’”
“Do you think anyone in this household is here because he is paying us?” Jarvis asked.  “Do you think I am?”  His index finger tapped against his other hand, and Steve blinked, recognizing the movement from another set of hands.  “I am…  What you might consider independently wealthy, myself.  I’ve served this household for a long time.  If I’d wanted to retire, if I’d wanted to leave, I could’ve done that years ago.  Decades.
“Mmmm.”  Tony was thinking about pasta now, garlic and onion, the heavy acidic bite of the tomato, mellowed with the earthiness of fresh Parmesan.  Maybe gnocci...
Tony opened his mouth, and DJ raised his chin from his knees.  “Darcy’s coming,” he repeated, and Tony exhaled, slow and pained.
“I see you’re home,” Tony said, ignoring the way that Steve was laughing, the sound muffled against Tony’s shoulder.  He cleared his throat.  “Welcome home.”
Pepper made no effort to hide her smirk.  Tony pointed a finger in her direction.  “Not a word,” he said.  “Fine.  You’re all allergic to fun.  That’s your problem, not mine.”
DJ nodded, and scrambled over to take Pepper's hand.  “You can read other books, too,” she said.  “There are a lot in here.  Enough to keep even a very good reader going for a while.”
“We're fine,” Tony said.  “We're-”  He went to wave them off and realized he was still holding DJ's weapon.  He tossed it in the general direction of the couch.  “By which I mean, I'm fine.  Bruce is having an attack of the vapors-”
“Is that what all this secrecy is about?” Steve asked, a little deflated by the idea.  “You’re telling me that Stark doesn’t bother locking his workshop, he’s got piles of plans and diagrams and blueprints piled up in the library, but this?” He glared at the still.  “This, you keep under lock and key?”
"This is conjecture on my part, of course," Jarvis said.  "Merely my own educated guess, from observation and analysis."
“And I expected you to hold it together and get the job done, that’s what I expected,” Tony said.  He looked down at DJ, his face relaxing into a smile.  “What is this doing back here?”  He rocked forward on his feet, his shoulders canting forward.  “What do you have to say for yourself?”
Clint rubbed his chin.  Steve was almost certain he was trying to hide a smile. “In a manner of speaking.”
“It’s not.”  Tony slipped into the library, trying to close the door before Peter could slip through, but he was remarkably quick.  Sighing, Tony headed for his desk, Peter dogging his heels the entire way.  May, who was tidying Pepper’s desk, gave him a sympathetic look.  “Peter-”
"Well, I'm not okay, but you were always more resilient than me," Tony pointed out.  Steve opened his mouth, and Tony waved him off.  "We don't have to do this."
She waved a hand at him.  “I know it’s stupid, but she really likes it and I have certain…”  Her fingers flexed, nails like claws.  “Instincts.  But we do that, and when Clint and Carol and I watch hockey, he’ll join us.”
"We'd be pleased to open you a store charge account," the man said, a distinct gleam in his eye.  "Provided your credit check goes through, of course."
“Yeah, but once I’m home, that’ll no longer be my problem,” Tony said.  “I mean, technically even while I’m still here, it’s not my problem.”
Sam lead the way down a side street.  “Wait here,” he said.  “I’ll get Danvers, she’ll want to talk to you both before we head back to the cottage.”  Without waiting for a response, he touched his heels to his horse’s side and cantered away.
"Now, he spends little time there.  If he is awake, he is likely elsewhere, and if he is asleep, then the space matters very little.  It remains largely unchanged since the decorators completed it."  He was silent for a moment.  “There is much more of sir in the workshop, than in his bedroom.  That is the space where he is most himself, most comfortable and most content.  It is the place he guards most carefully, and you are welcome there, and always have been.”
The stairs were narrow and winding, and they swayed in front of him, twisting in ways that didn’t make sense.  He blinked hard, trying to make his eyes focus, trying to force things back to normal.  Normal.  He didn’t know what it meant anymore.  He didn’t know how to make things make sense, and it was..
“I hate you so much, Wilson,” Steve said, and Sam was laughing at him, even as he planted a hand on Steve's face and pushed him away.
Jarvis waved him off.  “Fine, fine.  I had just hoped…”  His voice trailed away.  “Was it too much to ask for him to just…  Not try to hire someone?  Just this once?”
Jan winced.  “Okay,” she agreed.  “Gotcha.”  Her teeth worried at her lower lip, her eyes narrowed.  “And this is a problem because you want to dance at the reception?”
It was an order, woven of spun sugar, of warm, delicate tones that sank into his ears, into his skin.  His head, suddenly too heavy for his neck, sagged forward, and he found himself staring down into the depths of his cup.  It was coming up, towards his mouth, and his hand was attached to it, but he didn’t know if he was moving the cup or if the cup was moving him.  It was one thing, an extension of him, the liquid curling along the surface of the cup, licking it’s way towards his skin, the surface shivering in anticipation.
She snorted.  “And no reason he should hide it.  Not as if he’s ever faced a punishment for it.”  She lead the way down the servant’s corridor to the kitchen.  She nudged the door open with her hip.  “Pepper?”  Pepper, who was seated at the small table between the old hearth and the new ovens, looked up from her ledgers.  Mrs. Arbogast set the plates down beside the sink with a sigh.  “Would you help us clear the table tonight, dear?  The boys have made quite a mess.”
"Nah, but I just got on shift a few minutes ago," he said. "Place is going nuts, but I don't know what's up. Why?"
One of the massive bots shifted forward, and the boy's eyes slid in that direction.  A light broke from its moorings, sparks crackling across the feed, and it went out for a second.  The visual gone, there were only the words, continuing on, an unforgiving march of syllables.
“Get three,” Tony said, and he'd never get tired of the sound of Steve's laughter, the way it started soft and rose, bright and warm.  The way he tried to hide it by ducking his head or covering his mouth.  The way his eyes danced.  Tony grinned at him.  “Want something to drink?”
His voice trailed away, and Tony shifted in his seat.  “And you had to accept that,” he said.  “That there were people who wouldn't understand it, or who resented it.  There were people you were absolutely going to lose over this, and you still had to do it, because it was the best thing for you.  It was the only thing for you.”  Steve's eyes shot to his, and Tony gave him a wry smile before taking a sip of coffee.  “For me, it was getting out of pizza town.  I might've gone the other way, but I think I know what you mean.”
“Maybe tomorrow,” Rogers said, even as DJ scrambled down from his stool.  Rogers caught him as he tried to slip by, heading for the door.  “It's too much to set up right now-”
“Another cab,” Tony said, ignoring the way that Steve was clearly trying not to laugh.  Tony glared at him.  “Which I also told you that I’d pay for. Parker.  I told you that five hours ago.”
“You and everyone else on earth, including Rhodey’s mom,” Tony said.  He held up the water bottle in a mock salute.  “I’m nothing if not entertaining.”
DJ’s shoulders relaxed, his lips curling up in a smile.  Tony gave him a wink.  “Why don’t you just stay here and read for a bit?” he asked.  “We’ll come get you before dinner, all right?”
“We'll be right here,” Rhodey said, pushing away from the wall and stroking in Pepper's direction.  “Take your time.”
“And no one believes you.” Greer made a shooing movement with her other hand.  “I promise, I won’t break him.”
Tony staggered towards consciousness, reluctantly, so reluctantly, because everything hurt.  He breathed, and his chest ached, his throat ached, his head ached.  Everything hurt, and he resented it.
“Shame,” Tony said.  Jan stared at him.  He gave her a bright smile.  “So, going to cancel your plans?”
“Don’t be a dick,” Steve said.  “Also, even if we could get married, none of our family or friends are here.”
The kid tapped the envelope against his palm.  "Yeah.  Right."  He nodded, once, and then a second time, stronger this time, and shoved it into.  "Tell...  Tell Mr. Stark thanks."
For a long moment, there was nothing but the echo of the soundtrack, a faint ghost of sound that hung around them, soft and ethereal.  DJ took a deep breath.
“That’s a rock solid certainly,” Jessica said, picking up a baby carrot from her plate.  “I’m fine with it.”  She looked at Steve. “God knows I’m not capable of doing the emotional heavy lifting in this relationship.”
Thor leaned against the bar.  “‘When asked to cede the floor,’” he read aloud from his phone, “‘Chef Rogers responded ‘When history seeks to condemn a government for the treatment of its citizens, the harshest words are, and have always been, they let their people starve.  In times of plenty, when the earth provides, if you let your people starve, history does not forget that, Congressman.  No, I will not cede, no, I will not be silent.’”
“I didn’t,” Steve said, stepping into Hammer’s Home for Wayward Boys.  There was a general sense of dinginess that hung over the entryway and the main stairwell, no matter how many times Hammer had the boys scrub them.  “Everyone get their fair share?”
“No hospital,” Happy said, sliding behind the wheel.  He waited for Steve to pull his door shut before he started the car.  “The doc stitched him up at home.”
“Right.  So the only reason to try to trick us into running is if he wanted to keep the blood off of the carpet.”  Clint paused.  “If we’d had any sense, we would’ve gone.  Hopped a train with the down payment our client gave us to get that vase, moved on.  For a complete failure, it was the best we could’ve hoped for.”
“Well, yes, I'm always saying something,” Tony said, waving a hand through the air.  Sue leaned back against the workbench, her arms crossed over her chest, amused despite herself.  Tony was on a roll, and that was always amusing to her.
“Are you all right?” he asked, his hands on Tony’s face, smoothing through his hair, cradling Tony’s head in his hands.  “Tell me you’re all right, are you-”
She nodded, her cheek rubbing against his shoulder.  “I know.”  Another moment, and she pulled away, her cheeks wet, her nose red.  “I know that.  And more importantly, Franklin knows that.”  She gave him a wobbly smile.  “Thank you, Steve.”
Steve's mouth worked for a painfully long time before he managed to form words.  "How can I help you?"
Against his will, Steve smiled.  "Yeah, it's funny, until I need to sleep in here in the winter."  He tossed the food packages onto the kitchen table and shrugged out of his uniform jacket.  Tossing it over the back of the a chair, he crouched down beside the coal range.  "Then I'll be noticing that you unassembled something that you couldn't manage to assemble again."
That won him a smile, small and quick, but real.  “Worry about yourself,” she said, tapping him on the nose with one little fist, a joking punch.  Still, he staggered back, making a show of grabbing for the wall.  Pepper shook her head.“You’re in so much trouble.”
Tony dropped his hands, looking over to meet Steve's eyes.  His face was pinched, his mouth a set, hard line.  Tony managed a slight smile.  “Asshole who tried to have me killed, then tried to kill me?” he asked, his voice wry.  “Yeah.”
“Pep, are we done?” Tony asked, his signature forming by rote beneath the sweep of his pen.  “Please tell me we’re done.”
The blueprint rolled itself up, bouncing across the patio table and falling off the edge.  Pepper caught it before it could hit the ground, setting it firmly back on the table next to him.  "Excellent, that's exactly what I was trying for," she said, reaching for a chair.  Jarvis got there before she did, pulling it out for her.  She gave him a warm smile, sinking down into the seat.  "Thank you, Jarvis, that's very kind of you."
“No,” DJ said.  He shrugged his backpack off, letting it settle on the floor beside his feet.  Dust swirled over his shoes.  “But I thought you might’ve ordered.”
Tony lowered himself into his chair, and picked up his spoon with fingers that shook.  The covered clay bowl in front of his seat was still warm, and released a cloud of warm air when he opened it.  Mrs. Arbogast did her best, but there was only so much she could do with porridge without Obie noticing and taking her to task for interfering with Tony’s diet.
“Yes, well, Thor likes to exaggerate when it comes to destruction and general chaos,” Tony pointed out.  “There was a bar fight, and some people might tell you I started it, I’d like to make it clear that this is both a lie and a slur on my character, and-”
Steve was already shaking his head.  “Thanks, but not today.” He pushed himself to his feet.  “I’ll get out of the way so you can change and-”
Steve moved to the door.  Natasha’s eyebrow twitched up, a flicker of movement, but she didn’t object when he braced his hands on either side of the doorframe, effectively blocking all escape.  “What happened with Clint and the Pixy Stix?”
“Get a move on, boy!”  Isaiah’s voice echoed through the closed door.  “You planning on sleeping all damn day?”
Tony stared, unseeing, in the general direction of the windows. “This morning, there were sunflowers on my kitchen table,” he said, his voice quiet. “Damaged sunflowers, half of their leaves gone and with crooked stems. I bet he fished them out of the trash and then insisted on paying for them, just because he couldn't bear to see them end up that way.
Rogers grinned, wide and boyish and bright, and Tony lost his breath. "I"m an Irish war hero, and Tammany's still a thing in this city."
The watch in his hand was very familiar.  Steve’s hand shot to his pocket, but even before his fingers closed on the cloth, he knew it was empty.
“Yeah, but he does that to annoy me,” Stark said.  “Thanks for reminding me that he’s still grounded.”
“My grandmother is cherries,” Rhodey said.  “She’d gather them, by the bushel, and sit there, pitting them for pies.”  He peeled a strip of the croissant away, popping it into his mouth.  “I remember her, fingers stained with the juice, red on the tea towels and coating the old glass bowls.  I remember the scent, sweet and heavy and-”  He shook his head.  “Her pies were, they were unbelievable.  She tried to teach me, but I never had the knack.”  He looked at his fingers.  “Still can pit a cherry faster than anyone you ever met, though.”
She straightened up, letting the leaf fall away.  “Until they finally asked him to make something he wouldn’t make.  Something…  Unconscionable.”  She smiled.  “Then, they shot him.”
“And that has been what I’ve done, ever since.  I’ve given you structure, and stimulation, and a sense of purpose.  I’ve given you a home.”  He set his napkin down.  “That was all I could do, Anthony.”
Jan's shoulders slumped, just a tiny bit.  "Well, it's not a lie, Cap," she said.  "In that, well, you ARE married."
“Didn’t even slow him down,” Clint said.  “Especially since Nat just pointed at me, and went, cool as you please, ‘What do you know.  He’s a chef.’  And Stark just stared at her, just, I guess awed is the best way to put it.  That she’s really going with this.  He looked at me and smiled, and said, ‘I just bet you are, but I need a French chef.  They’re the best, and we hire only the best.  It’s a requirement around here.’”
On the tablet, DJ made his choice, holding up a flash card with a broad smile.  Tony paused, leaning in to squint at it.  “What…  What is that?  I don’t know what that is in English, let alone Japanese, what the heck, kid, dial it back.”
Steve just stood there, the sweatshirt hanging from his hand.  “I know.  But this is warm and dry, so...”  He let his voice trail away.
He glanced up, and Steve had stopped laughing.  He was just staring down at his fingers, his face blank.  Tony felt his stomach sink.  "Hey," he said.  "Sorry, it's okay, should've asked you what you wanted, we didn't discuss it or anything, but I saw that one and thought you might-"  He stopped.  "Here, I've got it-"
“I considered it, but no, this is everyone.”  Steve wrapped an arm around Tony’s shoulders.  “You want to open a few presents before breakfast, Deej?”
Carol tapped a finger against her lips.  Her short, spiky blonde hair was tipped with green and red, a festive touch of color despite her black turtleneck and running pants.  “Were you sorority sisters or were your mothers just tennis partners?”
“Far better than I had any right to expect,” Tony said. Because Steve loved him. Steve loved him. He realized, a bit too late, that he was holding onto his phone like it was a lifeline. He forced his fingers to relax.
"They're the 'good enough for Christmas parties with children, but too good for sports parties with Clint,'" Tony said.  Steve emerged from the fridge with a bowl of salad in one hand and a carton of refrigerated tortellini in the other.  He gave Tony a look.  "Do you know how many things got broken last Super Bowl?" Tony asked him.
“Well, he sure is furry,” Peter said.  He reached out, and scratched the cat behind at tuft that might've been an ear.  “So I guess that works.”  The cat bumped against his fingertips, its tail swishing through the air.
“He’s not wearing that,” Tony said.  “He’s not wearing that, because despite what he wants all of us to think, he does actually have standards.”
“Tony.” Steve’s smile never wavered.  “I promise.  I’m-” He spread his hands.  “Healthy as a horse.”
"It does, sir, but it makes no sense that this man-" Steve stabbed the file folder with enough force to make his finger hurt.  "Is a convert to any cause that doesn't put a dollar in his pocket.  He'd sell his own grandmother for enough of a payout, I'd sooner believe Stark of being a communist before him.”
“Based on when May and Jarvis say he left them and when Jarvis found him, it can’t have been very long,” Tony said.  “Half an hour, max, probably less than that.”  He shifted his weight, his hands in fists in his pockets.  “No one was exactly checking their watches.”
“He’s going now,” Happy said. He tipped his head towards the house.  “Jarvis is waiting for you inside, I’m sure he’s got more for you.”
Jan huffed out a breath, crossing her arms over her chest.  "He wasn't really good at reading people.  He also didn't have a lot of stable, healthy relationships to base his expectations on?  So when Rhodey befriended him at school, but didn't have a family or a social reason to do so, he just liked Tony and, well, Tony needed all the help he could get?  But he was kind to Tony, and they were inseparable, and-"  She stopped, her teeth digging into her lower lip.  "Tony read more into it than he should've, that's all."
Tony's breath caught, a spike of heat going straight through him.  Steve's eyes tipped up to meet his, and if he was anyone else, Tony would've thought he was flirting.  “Thanks,” Steve said, his fingers brushing Tony's as he took the last bite of the spring roll.  Tony let him take it, hoping that his face wasn't as red as it felt.
Tony smiled, just a little, but it was apparently enough, because she smiled back.  “I’ll be back to make breakfast,” she said.  She looked over Tony’s shoulder, and he stiffened, reminded of Steve’s presence.  “If you can wait?”
Cautious, careful, Peter reached out.  The second his fingers touched the bill, Pepper dropped it.  “Congratulations,” she said, brushing off a stool and plopping herself down.  “This is now one hundred percent your problem.”
“I still have a hangover,” he said, rubbing a hand up and down the length of Steve’s back.  “I still…”  He shook his head.  “Mother of all hangovers, Steve.”
Tony’s skin iced over.  “Is that what you think?” The words were a whisper, thin and cold and hard, and Peter flinched, his entire body jerking back, away from Tony, and it was like a physical blow.
“Right, right, go weed the garden, and save me some pickles,” Tony said with a grin.  “Say good bye, Steve.”
Nicholas nodded.  “You have no idea how honored I am to hear that.  He was a good man, a good king.  I always trusted the reports I got from Wakanda.”  His gaze slid to the side, catching on Steve and staying there.  Steve realized he’d fallen back into the posture that the army had beaten into him, shoulders back, chin up, eyes straight ahead.  Slowly, deliberately, Nicholas crossed to stand directly in front of him.  “Which is the only reason I gave any credence to this, particular, report.”
Tony considered the array of designs.  Slowly, deliberately, he reached for his coffee cup.  “The clinical term is catastrophic thinking,” he said, with a wry twist to his mouth.  “And I have my coping methods.  This one is less destructive than most, but it’s by far the most expensive.”  He pulled one of the armors out.  Pale blue and silver accents.  He knew its designation, its capabilities.
DJ sat up, rubbing his eyes, and Clint collapsed back against the couch, something like relief flitting over his face.  “Yes.  Okay.  Yes.  We're-”  He looked at Steve for the first time, his eyes meeting Steve's for a second before sliding away. “We're fine.  Right?”  He looked at DJ, who was tugging on the sleeve of his pajama top.  “We're okay?”
Tony studied him. “I suspect him of sleeping his way through the staff,” he said at last.  “Just so you know.  I’m watching you for any sign that you’re succumbing to his charms.”
The workman turned around, and Tony Stark glanced over his shoulder at them.  Steve stared up at him, suddenly achingly aware of how hard his heart was pounding.  Stark grinned at him, and there was a streak of grease along one of his cheekbones, plaster dust sprinkled in his black hair.  "So I do."  He stripped off his gloves, tucking them into his pocket before he hopped down off the table, the motion smooth and easy.  "Good afternoon, Officer Rogers."
“It's not porn, and I thought 'host club' was a, I don't know, a metaphor!” Steve said.  He wadded up his napkin and threw it at Tony.  Tony ducked.
Clint studied the plastic bag holding the costume.  “It doesn’t come with a voice changer,” he said.
“You're the one who tries to ditch the team gatherings, not me,” Steve said, and Tony would've been insulted, but that was pretty much true.
Steve didn’t remember picking up the trash can lid.  He didn’t remember much, between echo of that shot, and the point at which he brute forced his way through the crowd, plowing through them with uncanny instinct.  Knowing that they impulse for any sane man was to get away from someone holding a gun.  To get away, as fast as they could.
“You're TWELVE, which is not a teen, it's a pre-teen,” Val said with a smirk, her foot hitting once, twice, a third time in rapid succession, faster and faster, “and you're covered in Pringle crumbs and floor dirt, so I'm not sure you're ready to be an adult.”
He had no idea what was happening and that wasn’t new and that wasn’t something that even bothered him anymore.  Behind him, he heard Happy singing at the top of his lungs as he laid a man out with a haymaker of a right hook.  “Who’s next?” he howled, just as a man behind him pulled a gun from the pocket of his coat.
A man stepped forward, one hand coming up towards Happy, and Happy brought the bottle up, swinging wildly.  Cursing under his breath, Steve’s hand snapped out, trying to drag the back behind him.
“The soap might have something to do with that,” Tony said, because he loved being helpful.  He especially loved being helpful when it made Steve look like he was considering strangling him.  Tony smiled at him, bright and easy.  “You did remember the soap, didn’t you?”
“You asked Steve for advice,” Carol said, her voice flat.  Greer nodded.  “Dating advice.”  Greer nodded again.  “Baby.  Baby, no.”
The door opened before he could finish speaking, and Steve jerked forward, his heart in his throat.  Jarvis leaned into the room, his brow creased.  “Ah, good,” he said, his voice soft, stepping inside and pulling the door shut behind him.  Steve’s bag was hanging from his other hand, and he held it up.  “I found this in the kitchen, and was hoping you’d managed to get him to rest.”
Steve turned his face, pressing a kiss to Tony’s palm.  “Holidays are hard,” he admitted.  “But yes.  I’m okay.  I’ve got you.  I’ve got Dummy.  I’ve got the, well, for lack of a better term, the family.”
He reached out, touching Tony gently on the breast, a few soft words spilling from his lips.  Tony didn't understand them, but somehow, he didn't have to.  Even he knew a blessing when he heard one, and to his surprise, his eyes burned.  He nodded, just a little.  “Thank you,” he said, and the man smiled up at him, kindness writ large on his face.
“What was I supposed to do?” Peter said, hopping to keep pace with Tony.  “Let her go after him alone?”
Jan’s head came up.  “And what happens when we massively over order and end up with piles of food no one wants?”
DJ’s head tipped back as he considered the full dimensions of the main hall.  “Okay,” he repeated.  He rocked forward.  “Can we make popcorn?”
"Something's new here," he said instead, because he could bullshit with the best of them.  He braced his hands on the back of the couch, narrowing his eyes at Steve, who just smiled up at him, his expression amused.  Tony leaned in.  "New shirt?"
Only after Peter was gone, the door closed firmly behind him, did he relax.  “He’s not allowed to talk to me any more.”
“And then, because we are a people of limitless imagination and almost limitless resources, everyone and their god-forsaken brother started trying to figure out how to get you OUT of it.”  She paused.  “Not me, though.  I want that noted.”  She tapped a finger on the table.  “I was not interested in the prize in the middle of a magical block of ice, in that it was a dead body.”
DJ leaned into his touch, his eyes fluttering shut.  “Thank,” he said, with a sweet little smile.  Steve smiled back at him, loving him so much that it was a physical ache.
Gently, every so gently, Tony pulled his arm free of Steve’s grip, and it took everything Steve had not to grab him again.  “I am not about to become a prisoner in my own home, not even for you,” Tony said.  His lips twitched up, in a mockery of a smile.  “You’re not suited to be a jailer, Steve.”
"The 'dollar short' seems like a pay issue," Marcy said, her arms folded across her chest, her lips kicked up in a slight smile.  "I'm more than happy to renegotiate my salary based on current events, but until then, I'm going to have to insist that you let me do my job and actually be the face of PR for this company."
The car rolled to a stop, and he glanced up from the papers in his hands, catching Happy’s eyes in the rearview mirror. “Your stop, sir,” Happy said with a lopsided smile, and Tony glanced out the window.  The house rose over them, dark and ominous, every window shuttered or empty.
Tony didn't smile, but he didn't scream, either.  He considered that a win.  "Right."  Bruce's arm relaxed as he took a step back, his hand sliding against Tony's chest, bracing him, holding him up.  Tony reached up, grabbing hold of his hand and squeezing.  "Is he-"
“We have an agreement, we do not interfere with each other’s jurisdictions,” Coulson said, his voice flat.
Her lips twitched, then stretched into a smile, puckish and bright.  “‘The Phony King of England?’” she asked.
Miss Potts looked up from filling her cup.  "Yes, thank you."  She held up the tea pot.  "Would you like a cup? Or some soup?"
“Because all women are terrifying,” Jess said.  She was doing something bizarre with her hands and knees; Steve was pretty sure she was attempting the Charleston.  She was also failing, but she sure was trying.  “The ones who don't seem terrifying are just extra good at hiding it.” She did a hopping kick.  “Right Jane?”
“Because DJ wishes to help Dr. Banner with trimming them,” Bobbi said.  She shifted her weight, forward and back, her feet rooted to the ground.  “There’s pruning shears involved. It’s all very exciting.”
“Hey, don't dis punching things,” Jessica said, her eyes narrowed at the punching bag.  “Punching things is great.”
Steve snagged his shield out of midair, swinging it back into place.  “Not now,” he gritted out, as he ducked under a punch, countering with a body blow to the solid center of the mobster’s mass.  He twisted, tossing the limp form aside, and turned to meet the next attack.
“Uh-huh, well, guess what, we're going to-”  His phone vibrated in his pocket, and he fumbled for it with one hand.  “Hold on.” Tony made a grumbling noise, his eyes fluttering shut.  Steve found himself smiling at Tony, even as he answered his phone.  “Hey.”
Bruce took it.  “Well, what’s happening?” he asked, wrapping both hands around the cup.  He made no move to drink it.  His eyes darted around the room.  “Do we…  Do we know what’s happening?  Downstairs, I mean?”
“And should that come to pass, I shall of course be happy to handle the task, sir.”  Jarvis tucked the tray under his arm, leaning over to peer into the face of the clock.  “Hmm.  I take it that it is keeping good time?”
“Look, this is about the worst day in food service, I expected you went home three hours ago,” Tony said as Steve turned on his stool, reaching back for the cooler box he’d been carrying when he walked in.
Rogers paused halfway across the workshop.  “Yes,” he said, exasperated.  “This is where I left you.  Two hours ago.”
Tony reached back, his fingers sliding into Steve's hair.  “You weren't paying attention,” he said.  “You're the one everyone wanted to date.” His throat ached, his head ached, and he wondered if Steve was planning on staying with him on the couch.  “Flowers and poetry and warm Sunday mornings on your couch with eggs and croissants.”
Bruce looked up from his own tablet, his eyes darting to Tony, and then back to Steve.  “Thank you,” he mouthed, and Steve managed a smile for him.
"The difference is,” Steve said, with a grin, “I stopped eating MREs once that was no longer necessary.” He ripped the package of pasta open, dumping the tortellini into the boiling water.  “There's bread, too, over on the-” He waved a hand towards the counter.  “If you want it?”
Tony’s sucked in a breath, and another.  “You, you are both fired,” he said, his voice echoing in his ears.  The world tipped sideways, and he made a grab for the desk, trying to steady himself.  The wood of the desk dissolved under his fingers, and he heard something shatter, glass or bone.
Tony reached up, gently pushing Steve’s arm down.  “Did you think that I wouldn’t notice that no matter what bed we end up in, or where I was when I fell asleep, when I wake up, you’re always on the side of the bed between me and the door.” His jaw went tight.  “The last thing I need is a human shield, Steve.”
"At least tonight," Steve said.  He blinked at Tony, his blue eyes guileless behind the slight magnification of the lenses.  "Want me to take them off?"  There was a faint note of amusement to his voice.
Happy popped out of the car, his face florid.  “WHO JUMPS OUT OF A MOVING CAR?  I COULDA RUN YOU OVER, YOU-”
“And when something fucks with that, something changes that,” he managed, the words tripping out, faster and faster, “when someone else is there and slips under your guard and manages to take on some of that weight, you don't notice that, either. It's like sunflowers on the table, it's a shock at first and then you fucking get USED to it, and that's the problem.
Drew groaned.  Shawn just grinned at him, waiting patiently for him to come to terms with the inevitable.  Finally, Drew nodded.  “Fine.  But I want blue cheese dressing.”
She gave him an arch look, her chin in the air.  “Who is telling this story, you or me?  Because at this point in the story, you-” She pointed her spoon at him. “Were frozen in a giant block of ice.  Which is bad enough, but it was a magical block of ice, so....”  Her voice trailed away.
“Why do you say that?” he asked, and Tony could see the trap at his feet, gaping like a canyon in front of him.
“Yeah.”  Steve kissed him again.  “I might've noticed.”  He put the tablet on the bedside table, right next to a very large poinsettia and a vase full of white roses.  “Want to go open presents?”
She gave him a look.  “Everyone’s going,” she said, “Or they’re skipping town before Jan finds them.”  She bit her lip.  “But maybe that’s the problem, everyone’s going to be there.”
“He likes to be tall,” Sam said, his arms crossed over his chest.  Without even looking up, he took a step to the side, right before the remains of a sack of some sort hit the floor where he’d been standing.  Sam smiled at nothing in particular.  “Missed.”
“Tony,” she said, catching his attention.  Tony looked at her, blinking.  Sue took a deep breath.  “There's a child.  In your workshop.”
The question was like a splash of cold water, straight to the face.  Tony gave his head a shake.  "Is that sass?" he asked, reaching for the pliers again.  Rogers got there first, fingers curling around the grip as he handed them over.  "Is that working class sass I hear in your voice?"
Tony exhaled.  “Holding steady, for now.”  He shook his head.  “For now.  I’m glad to be home.” He held his hands out towards the fire.  “I might thaw out by the New Year, and we’ll have time to worry about what’s coming.”
DJ’s chin came down, and he blinked at Tony, his expression blank for a moment.  He tipped to the side and looked at the signs that were plastered all over the side hallway, covered in cardboard witch’s hats and cheap costume shop wands.  He looked back at Tony.  “Yes.”
“Ooo, I like this one,” Jess said, peeking over his shoulder.  She reached past him, making grabby fingers at the painting, a simple landscape he'd done from turn of the century photos of Central Park.  “Can I have it?”
Clint nicked another piece of Bobbi’s peel.  “Still not sure we made the right choice.”  His head rolled in Bruce’s direction.  “How about you?”
Harris glanced back at him.  “I don’t attract trouble,” he said, digging his wallet out of his pocket.
Jan nodded.  “Definitely, that is…  That’s a good plan, better too much than too little, it’s just-”
“I'm not saying that they traveled halfway around the world to get married at a Pride celebration,” Ellen said, doggedly determined.  “I'm saying that once they WERE halfway around the world, they DID get married at a Pride Celebration.”
Thanks for sticking with me, everyone!  And thanks so much for the winner of my auction, who provided such a wonderful idea for me to play with.
“Sit down before you fall down,” she said, shoving him towards one of the chairs.  He went, too tired, too broken to care.  “You know, one of these days, you’re going to figure out that deliberately alienating the people who are trying to help you, who are capable of helping you, is not the best move.”
“The rumors are spreading.  It’s all tangled up,” Nicholas said, bracing his hands on the table.  “There’s an old legend, you know.  That when the times are dark, when hope is faltering, a lost king will come down from the mountains to reclaim his throne.”
Tony’s head jerked up.  “What-  I-” Darcy was looking around, her head jerking from one side to the other.  “What do you-”  He spun around.  “Harris?”
“Right,” Steve said, with a wry smile. “That-”  He shook his head.  “That's horrible.”  He glanced at Tony, his hands braced on his thighs.  “And the women?”
Allison looked past him.  “Come on my show,” she said to Steve, her eyes huge and pleading.  “You can reveal all the embarrassing things he never wants the world to know.”
“But this?” Steve flicked the lock with one finger, letting it swing against the glass.  “This looks like the work of a small, clever boy with plenty of time and a few tools he’s managed to pocket.”
“Can you really tell the difference anymore?” Steve asked.  He waved at the containers scattered over every square inch of the kitchen.  “I’ve gone sugar numb.  Nothing tastes like anything.”
“Because my ma raised me right,” Steve said, bouncing his sketchpad against his thigh.  “Can I hide down here for a bit?”
“Oddly, I’m okay with this,” Tony said.  His tongue flicked out, tracing the seam of his lips, and Steve shifted in his chair, heat curling in the pit of his stomach.  Tony’s nose wrinkled.  “Lacks the airy snap I’d expect.”
She made a slight humming noise under her breath.  “Right,” she said, spreading the pages out.  “You see, there’s been a man causing a great deal of problems for the various crime families lately.  It’s been a real topic of conversation, obviously, in the back rooms and the back alleys.  Because they’ve been playing the game the way it’s always been played.  They’ve been paying off the right men.  Politicians.  Ward bosses.  Beat cops.  A little cash in the right hands, and everyone’s supposed to look the other way.”
Jan had DJ in her lap now, blowing gently on his hair.  Flour floated through the air like snow, making him giggle.  “Have you anything fun planned for Sunday?”
"It's an 'I will have you murdered,'" Tony said, because he was very close and very wet and very, very hot, "which I think implies a certain level of-"
Understanding dawned, and behind it a rush of excitement.  “The greenhouse,” Steve said, almost gleeful.  “The damn greenhouse.’
“Cat,” Harris said, a little too loud and a little too sharp, and everyone looked up, just in time to see the cat jump onto the podium in the center of the altar.  It paused there, caught in the light from the high windows, the tip of its tail twitching back and forth as it settled down.
She turned the skeletal remains of the armor, her gaze fascinated.  “How many of these have you built?” she asked, an idle, disinterested question.  “And how many of them were built to face a particular threat?  A threat only you could see?  A threat only you even know is a threat?”
Tony leaned a shoulder against the doorframe, his hands tucked in his pockets.  "Honey, I'm home," he said, and he didn't know he was going to say it until the words were already out, hanging in the air between them, the stupidest thing he'd ever said.
Tony grabbed DJ's head between his palms and leaned forward, pressing a loud kiss to the top of DJ's head.  “You,” he said, “are ungrounded.”
"Wonderful.  I'm not married, who am I supposed to be married to this time?" Tony asked.  "I haven't even been on a second date for more than six months, so who-”
The whole thing took less than fifteen minutes. The benefit, Tony supposed, to having a very efficient legal team.
“I don’t know the row, but almost smack dab in the center of the orchestra seating,” Tony said, “there’s a fella riding herd on a bunch of boys.”  He held a hand over his head at roughly Steve’s height.  “Big, blond.  Looks like he should be in the pictures, not watching them.”
Jarvis lead him out of the kitchen and up the stairs towards the grand hall.  Once they were out of earshot, Steve glanced back at the kitchen door.  "May I ask you a question?"
Steve's eyes darted towards her driver, who hid a smile behind one broad palm.  "Back seat," he said, shutting Miss Pott's door.  "I'll get the door for you."
Steve head snapped up, surprised, and she smiled at him.  “Everyone had gone home.  Even the priest.  It was just Peter and I, standing there.  With, perhaps, no where else to go.  We had a flat still, of course, paid for through the end of the month, but I knew I couldn’t long afford that, not on my own.  So in a way, we’d already lost it.
“The first group of traders goes out a few days later.  And before sunset of the next day, they have returned to the city, right back to the council chambers.  And they say to my brother, ‘he will not go.’”  She twisted in her seat, one leg swinging under her.  “Which.  Fine.  We had not waited long enough, we miscalculated, he was probably too weak to think of a trip like that.  Simple miscalculation.  So several days later, another group of soldiers goes off to try again.
“No, this is my favorite spot in the penthouse,” Steve said. He looked down at his sketchbook. “Thought I'd enjoy it while I could.”
“And what do you want?” Tony wanted anger, he wanted rage, he grasped desperately for that.  Anger like a heavy coat that he could wrap around himself, rage that could shelter him, that could be a shield.  But his voice sounded broken, empty.
The girl was standing there, directly in front of him, red light swirling around one upraised hand.  “Your phone’s ringing.”
“Glad to see I’ve still got you fooled,” Tony said, trying to straighten up.  “As that’s one of the bedrock tenets of this relationship.” Steve let him go, his hands sliding free, and Tony stumbled.
“‘He’s French,’ was her exact words, and Stark was laughing by now, just laughing out loud, and he said to me, ‘Really.  You’re French,’ and it wasn’t really a question, but now I had four options,” Clint explained.
