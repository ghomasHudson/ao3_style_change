"They’ve changed a lot," Tony says as he leads Steve to his workshop. He's bouncing, full of energy, which is great. Hell, the bags under his eyes are all but gone, so caring for the kittens clearly hasn't been too hard on him. It's a bit callous, but it's almost a disappointment, since Steve saw himself arriving like a savior to give relief. On the other hand, it's even better to see Tony looking so happy.
The cats are more interested in inspecting the plants and furniture on the patio than in greeting the humans, but it's not a problem because everyone goes to them.
Steve doesn't answer, too busy chewing, and for a few minutes they eat in silence. After his third cheeseburger, Steve points at Tony's project with a French fry.
He wonders once more what the right move is in regards to Steve's crush. They have a complicated history, and Tony doesn't remember all of it. Tony likes Steve back, that's the thing. A lot. But he doesn't know if he has something brewing on Earth, no official significant other notwithstanding. What if Tony's on a break with Pepper, but there’s a chance that it’ll work again? Granted, that's not the impression he got from the texts and emails he found on the phone. Tony's probably single. And so is Steve.
He's seen many beautiful people in the centuries he's roamed the Earth, and brought several of them in bed, but never anyone quite this perfect inside out. Maybe that's why Tony has survived this long, to finally find The One.
"What are you sorry for?" Tony's voice is rough as he wipes come and spit from the corner of his mouth with the back of his hand.
"Yeah, me too," Tony adds. The Kree want that light-speed engine more than anything, they'll at least risk it.
"I didn't mind. They showed me material that was recently rediscovered. It was nice." Bittersweet, really, especially seeing Bucky smirk and joke with him and the others, but he's glad to have seen those tapes. And the journalists
"Ah, sorry," Tony says awkwardly. He is hyper-aware that at this very moment Lilly is stretched in the crease at the juncture of his and Steve's thigh, touching them both.
Steve huffs because of course he'd catch that with his super hearing. "Yeah, well, I wasn't convinced it was a good thing, not after seeing how Hydra infiltrated SHIELD and the WSC. We had two camps and fought about it. Then you found out about your parents in the worst possible way."
Steve nods, turning his back on their counterparts. "Yeah, let's get out of here too. We're on a ship of some kind."
That J.A.R.V.I.S. doesn't seem in rescue mode—and now that Steve thinks about it, the AI would have called a doctor if there was something life-threatening—helps Steve breathe a bit easier.
He's just gotten to his knees, reluctantly throwing the pistol a few feet forward—hopefully close enough to dive on it if needed—when the growl rises again. It's now five times louder than before and absolutely terrifying. In response, the Hydra soldiers lose interest in Tony and all point their rifles towards the sound… that is moving, circling the camp.
There's no other way to describe the bounce of DUM-E’s camera than excited. It's incredible what the helper bot can convey, but then again, he is Tony's creation. Everything that Tony does is extraordinary (Ultron too, even though it was on the bad side of the Force.)
"Thought I'd just-" WIM-Tony sniffles, still holding Other-Steve. "Thought I'd just… I mean, I thought that-"
"Fuck, enough already! I know. I know that. Barnes isn’t directly responsible, fine. Hydra is. But he still killed my parents. That doesn't change. And what I can't—" He can't even say he doesn't understand. He does. Barnes above everything, but he still asks anyway, even knowing the answer. "Why did you lie?"
"Steve," Tony says, extending the black kitten towards him. Her little eyes are closed again, as she's fast asleep. "Meet Snowball."
"I'm sure you'll find a way," Steve says with confidence. "Jarvis said you didn’t go to medical? Whatever Vapor made you breathe could--"
"Hush," Tony says, then kisses Steve to interrupt him. "It's the perfect time. JARVIS and/or the Spy Twins will warn us when they get here."
Tony tilts his head at his screen, but it's not a mirage. There are no red items on his to do list. Hell, there are no orange ones either.
Steve, who is both arrogant in his self-righteousness and infinitely selfless. The wonder on his face when Tony gave him back his shield. The fondness that swelled in Tony's heart over Steve's speech just before they left for the Time Heist. Steve being the first to reach him when the Benatar landed. Everything clicking into place when they fought together. Realizing Steve was interested in being more than friends by how he kept looking at Tony after the snap.  Pepper and Rhodey coming to Tony about it too, like the gossips they are.
"You saved the universe, Tony." Steve moves his hand up to Tony's neck and he squeezes gently. "Take a moment, and when you're feeling better, I'll tell you all about it. I promise."
"And that we were talking about how last night was amazing, and you said you had an idea. My brain was already in the gutter, that's all," Tony says.
Instead of replying, Tony hummed and nodded before caressing Lilly. Her softness was a constant delight. Tony couldn't help but grin when it woke the stoat, who stretched all of her legs simultaneously before yawning. She might have been small, but Lilly sure had teeth that looked wicked sharp and pointy.
"Is there a problem?" Steve asks, looking ready to punch somebody in the face. Whether it's the actual threat—Kol—or Tal is hard to say.
"Are you kidding me?" Nat answers. "Cats: a classic. Superheroes: it gets the hits going. Now cats and superheroes? If I monetize it, I'll be rich in no time."
The babies are small, but they're fiercely determined to live, of that Steve is sure. In between meals, they sleep contentedly.
"No, Miss Viv," Tony says with a grin, catching the ball on the rebound. "Is the doctor ready to see them?"
"You retired, married Pepper, had Morgan. You were out. After the Decimation, we tried to get on with our lives. Then five years later, Scott—another Avenger—got unstuck from the quantum realm where he'd been all this time and had an idea."
Could it be? God. So much is happening, and Anthony's usual coping mechanisms rear up. With no control over the situation, he reverts to humor.
"Why would I do that?" Tony said, laughing, as Cora desperately tried to get away. She was stronger than he'd thought.
Tony feels stupid for not taking the chance. "I didn't want to look too clingy, if all you wanted was a fuckbuddy."
He's feeling a lot better when he rejoins Tony in his workshop. It doesn’t surprise Steve to find him observing the kittens sleeping in their box.
"Good things, I hope!" Carol says with a grin that’s a bit too aggressive for Tony's comfort. She doesn't appreciate being condescended at, which Tony gets, but the situation needs to be handled with care.
It's always a risk, flirting openly with a man. But technically Steve started it, and Tony's all for rewarding anyone bold enough to try, especially when they’re this handsome. But now that Tony has clearly stated his interest, Steve seems pleased but unsure of what to do. He's very young, and Tony would bet he's mostly inexperienced, at least for now. A gorgeous man like that will rapidly figure out the signals and codes of hooking up with other men. Tony wishes he could show him the ropes, in a manner of speaking, and the idea of just how pleasurable that could be curls hot in his gut. But the middle of a Hydra camp and surrounded by corpses isn't the place for it.
The black kitten is crawling towards the back of the lab and DUM-E slowly follows, leash in his pincer. Steve's stomach lurches; what if DUM-E rolls over her by accident? He'd never mean to hurt the baby, but he
Nebula steps in close and grabs Tony's chin, peering into his eyes. She's frowning, definitely not happy he got hurt once again.
God, Tony loves this man so much, and it's such a shame that they lost two years because of the stupid Krees. It makes him look down at Yon-Rogg with resentment.
"Happily." Steve looks very pleased at that, which is great, but Tony is careful to relativize his expectations (he's learned a thing or two from previous experiences). "I'll return as soon as I can, but it might take a few days, especially if Victor is smart enough to hide."
"Of course," Tony says. It's hard to let go of Steve when he takes a few steps back. By now even Tony can hear men walking towards them.
"So, I noticed that you didn't mention Asgard on the tour list," Tony says, peeling off the wrapper of his oat, nuts, and apple bar. "I suppose Thor is taking care of it?"
It makes Steve's heart flip, and hope grows in his chest. Maybe Tony likes him more than a friend, too.
"For sure," Tony says as they reach the living room's couch. Steve lies down and opens his arms, pleased when Tony snuggles close. He's still completely dressed but his clothes are soft and Steve embraces him tightly.
"All right," Tony says, making Steve grin. He eagerly reaches for Tony's belt, who stops him once more. "Only the zip. Don't undo the belt."
Carol's face lights up. "Oh, Tony doesn't know about Rocket!" He wonders what’s exciting about that. "Does anyone have a picture? Or better, a video?"
The next morning Tony, dressed in his own clothes and practically ready to go, stops by the bathroom and almost has a heart attack. The man in the mirror is
It takes a few minutes to wrap things up after that. Richards promises that he'll add security measures, so that the portal doesn't let anyone through unless they are wearing a homing device. Tony fully intends to come back and talk more about the tech and what they can learn from it, too. Reed uses it to study the Civil War events, but maybe it could be useful for the menace that Tony saw through the wormhole during the Battle of New York. It might also be a good means to discover more superheroes for the team.
Steve was babbling, and Tony had gripped his arm in what he hoped was a reassuring hold. If Tony's armor failed one day, it wouldn’t be anyone's fault other than his. Or that the enemy had bested him in battle, and that's the risk of the job.
As suggested by both Carol and Nebula, they'll all be in uniform or in Tony's case, carrying the arc reactor to suit up later. They plan to stir things up enough for him to deploy the armor, in any case, since it's an impressive calling card. Make a show of it, not to hurt anyone but to make a statement. Tony spent the last two days of traveling to Knowhere playing with the armor, fascinated by the versatility of the nanites. From his perspective, it's a prodigious technological leap. Playing with the suit and its possibilities has been a godsend in distracting himself from his current stilted interactions with Steve.
"Gimme." Tony takes Steve's hard cock in hand and gives him a slow stroke from bottom to tip. Tony's fingers can't circle the girth, and it's hot as hell.
"Yeah, so you two," Jim says, pointing at Tony and Steve, "would have a better chance against Morgan and Pete."
Instead of being sad about it—it's not been easy; he had truly hoped they would work—Tony feels a bone-deep relief. This fresh development deserves a pause: he's actually getting over his heartbreak, then. This is good, very good.
"I know of your progress in training." The Supreme Intelligence scrutinizes him and takes a moment to finish his thought. "It's very impressive."
It's curiosity, now, as he's definitely interested in learning about what Tony likes. His boyfriend smiles, wicked.
Steve welcomes them with a smile, and a wave of love and fondness washes over Tony. Upon touching ground by his side, Tony squeezes Steve's arm, who bends in for a quick kiss.
"Of course, Captain," she says. The way she stops zooming out once Tony is in the frame is proof of how transparent Steve is.
"I don't like not understanding," Steve says, annoyance stirring in his gut. He'll never be able to catch up on everything he missed while in the ice, and it's frustrating that he trips up all the time on simple stuff.
"Come on," he says when he releases Tony, though he keeps an arm around his shoulders. Now that he's got permission to touch, Steve plans on taking advantage of it every moment he can. "Let's go see how the children are doing."
His mother and the Jarvises drilled him from a very young age with the rules of etiquette in high society. It's highly cultural; who knows if he'll make a faux pas with an alien civilization. But there are basic rules that he figures he can't go wrong with. Throughout the meal, which has several courses, Tony always waits until they serve High Priestess Ayesha before imitating her and reaching for the correct utensils. He also never eats before her. Tony could be smoother but is intentionally a little clumsy, like a child at the adults’ table. He's certain that they’ve noticed his efforts when he catches the high priestess's right-hand man scoffing at him. Good. Let him take them for backwater hicks. He doesn't know if the others realized the game he's playing, but Tony is pleased to see that Carol and Steve are following his lead.
"He won't." Steve confidently steps onto the left boot when it’s his turn, arm thrown over the suit's shoulders as Tony embraces his waist in return.
"Or we were," he amends, thinking out loud. "I mean, we had given up on finding that secret Hydra bunker, concluding we had bad intel. But clearly they're nearby."
"In Berlin, the man who interrogated Bucky wasn't the right doctor. He interrogated him about Hydra's super soldier's program and triggered Bucky with command codes so that the Winter Soldier came out. Bucky wasn't even in Vienna for the bombing, he was in Romania." For a moment he looks away from Tony to look at T'Challa. "I'm sorry about your father, I really am. But Bucky didn't do it."
"I second that." Clint lowers his bow. "You found a way to come back from the dead? I can't say I'm surprised."
He's not surprised when one of Steve's eyebrows rises in disbelieving amusement. That didn't work with Pepper either.
Not to toot his own horn, but Tony knows that he's a key factor to win this battle. As is Carol, who pipes up.
"Did you experience unsatisfied urges lately, Mister Rogers?" Tony teases, leaning down for a closed-mouthed peck.
Tony is glad he doesn't have to slink into the penthouse to find Pepper at the kitchen table with her first cup of coffee, bottling up her resentment. Hell, instead of disappointment in him she'll be happy in a couple of days when he brings her a finished project ahead of schedule.
"Yes." Steve kisses Tony again, pouring in all of his hopes, to know and cherish all of him. It revs up to deep and wet in no time, Steve's blood now rushing in his ears. God, he wants and wants, so much.
The infant grins around his fist as he watches Tony, shaking his leg playfully. When the movement makes his tiny sock slip off his foot, Tony carefully pushes it back up. The boy looks healthy, happy even, and not hurt or in danger at all.
"I didn't like it much either," Steve says. "But what I'm trying to say is that going in the ice was supposed to happen to me. It happened, over and over again." Is it a comfort? It seems so. "And I think it happens for a reason." At this point Steve stops and swallows as he scrutinizes Tony's face, who is frankly pretty lost.
But there is another blond who has been throwing Tony lingering looks ever since he got to the Ball: the one and only Steve Rogers. Tony admits that it has thrown him for a loop. To be honest, at first he assumed Steve had been checking out Cherie (and who wouldn't, she's delightful in her tight red dress). But right now Tony's at the bar to fetch drinks, and Steve keeps on looking at
He feels drained of all tension and wonders if he will slip down on the floor in a puddle. But no, Tony's there to prop him up, solid and smelling so good. He has circled an arm around Steve's shoulders and is caressing his back up and down with gentle humming sounds. Steve wishes they were on a soft surface; he would happily pass out for a bit. Hell, he might try it even standing up.
"Tony—" Steve starts, but Tony, not even looking at Steve, raises a hand and his index finger in warning.
After taking a couple of steps in the driveway, Tony isn't surprised to see a version of himself in a well organized garage with lots of shelves. There's also an Indian motorcycle in the back. This Tony Stark, in a blue t-shirt and jeans, is sitting on a bench on wheels, welding goggles on and soldering iron in hand. What throws Tony for a loop is that he's working on Bucky Frigging Barnes' metal arm, seated shirtless—and shoeless—on a table beside him. Nice abs, though Tony hates himself a little for checking the guy out.
Hugging Peter on the battlefield, reveling in the fact that he's solid and back and they really, really made it happen. Peter who is so good—the best—and somehow looks up to Tony, which means he must have done something right. Seeing Peter play with Morgan like a big brother.
Nebula lands the Blaze on a rundown platform that already hosts a dozen ships that vary from shiny and new to the alien equivalent of being held together by duct tape and a prayer. There's curiosity from the few onlookers on the docks when they unboard, but Carol pays no mind to the staring and strolls confidently to what seems to be an airport hanger. Two huge bouncers are flanking the door: one is purple and the other honestly looks like Chewbacca. Tony is trying very hard not to stare and geek out.
Tony wants to ask which captain—he knew this would get confusing—but her eyes slide to the left and there's Steve, maybe forty feet away, sitting on the Capitol's steps and leaning against a column. Steve was looking their way but canted his head up to look at the moons and stars when caught.
"Hey, no, that's not fair to you. None of it is your fault." Steve doesn't seem to want to let go of him, which is lovely. But they do need to talk, as much as he hates it. "Come on, let's sit down."
"What research?" Tony asks. He's of the opinion that the Avengers should have known about tech that can open portals to alternate realities.
Steve hasn't said a word, and Tony has a hand between his shoulder blades where he can sense him coiled to attack.
Tony finally stops pacing to look at Steve. His eyes and nose are red as he wipes below his eyes with the back of his hand. It's a weird time for Tony to note that Steve is an ugly crier.
"The umbilical cords are dry, which puts them at two or three days old. They seem in relatively good health, especially this little gal," he says, pointing at the black one. She doesn't even have full control of her head, but is bobbing it and crying.
He rocks her for a few more seconds before looking at Thor, who’s sitting cross-legged on the floor. He has an arm looped around his lioness, seated tall and proud by his side.
"I know. Still disturbing. That was quick thinking, earlier," Tony says. "Bringing Loki here and tricking him into admitting he's jealous of the Avengers live on TV. I watched the tapes: it was perfect. Nothing like shaming a god to make him go poof."
"Hey, look!" Johnny Storm has spotted them and excitedly shakes his brother-in-law's arm. He's grinning widely, and not for the first time it strikes Tony how much Johnny looks like a young Steve sometimes. "They've found us!"
"I love you," he says back—or anew, it's not important—and it's likely a good start because Steve looks soft, loved and content.
"Yes, that’s wonderful." He accepts the water gratefully, as does Nebula, distancing herself once more.
She taps her lower lip with her index finger as if she needs to think about it. "I'd say Danvers comes up the most."
Wanda seems envious when Steve picks Callie up, and yeah, he's smug. He's learned that there's no better feeling than being deemed worthy by a cat.
In and out of his relationship with Pepper, especially once it was over for good, Tony was perfectly content to nurse a silent crush on Steve that he assumed was one-sided. After an incident involving an EMP that had Iron Man drop a few stories to the ground during a battle, Steve had appeared in his workshop with a determined expression and a purposeful stride.
"Sassy. But back to the initial question: do you have the last configuration of the armor stored in memory?"
It's clearly a diss based on the coldness of her tone, and it stumps Tony. She and Steve don't get along? This is all so confusing, and Tony knows that if he tries to ask questions now, without more insight on the problem, it’ll make her clam up. Distraction time it is, then.
"I don't know what you're referring to," Tonys says. There's the sound of the blender turning on, crushing ice. He must be making frozen smoothies. The noise almost masks Rhodes' next remark.
"Ooops, did I offend you? Sorry." Steve doesn't look contrite at all. "I've never seen a vampire before. I don't think so, at least."
Tony deliberated if he should start the battle in the Iron Man armor or not, but decided against it. If he needs to go binary, better not have the suit in the way. Anyway, for now he has to wait until the scout team reaches them.
Well, the asshole is welcome to try again, because Tony is convinced of one thing. With him and Steve united and backed by their friends like today? They can do anything. They'll be ready.
"Jeez," Tony says, hand on his sternum. "One day I'll put a bell on you! You almost gave me a heart attack."
It's a video that was shot in a lab, judging by the workstations and various holograms. There are several people in the periphery including Rhodey—it's immensely reassuring to see him—but what Steve focused on while filming is Tony arguing with… is that a dressed-up racoon? That talks?
Tony takes a step forward and puts a hand in the middle of Steve's chest, which shuts him up instantly. His heart is pounding under Tony's palm.
"Problem?" Maybe Tony has a business meeting that he forgot to tell Steve about. "It's okay if you-"
Tony is so relieved he's on the verge of tears again, but happy ones this time. He knew he could count on Steve. He looks on as Steve runs out of his bedroom and by the sound of it jumps down the set of stairs. It's fainter after that, but Tony's sensitive hearing picks up lots of muttering, page-turning, and declarations about how Steve has got this.
He’d understand if he'd bought whipped cream or something like that, but the ingredients for Thai food?
Tony could protest that he's fine, but it would be a lie, which he avoids doing as much as possible with people he likes. But Steve is new on the scene, and if the file Nat has helped build is true, he always focused on healing spells and potions. It's a talent he inherited from his mother, and might have also used as an Army medic. Steve looks capable enough, his magic is strong, but bringing him along would be a liability as Tony wouldn't totally focus on the fight.
"She said that you both tried to make it work, especially for Morgan, but you two have always been better as friends. Co-parenting was what you'd do from now on. I think she has a boyfriend, but I haven't met him."
Steve blinks up at him, surprised. "Good, as much as he can be. He had the Hydra trigger words removed, so he's officially free of them, but he also remembers the full seventy years where he was the Winter Soldier. He's a mess, and sorry about everything too."
Instead of tipping the glass and bringing it close for Tony to lean into, he dips his free index finger in the water and then brings next to Tony's face.
"Why so angry, Kol?" Tony asks, because he's attempting to hit Tony again, now aiming at Tony’s head. As it often happens with an emotional fighter, Kol is predictable. It's easy to block every blow, and for the moment Tony isn't trying to end the fight and just pushes him around a little. It's clearly insulting to Kol so win-win. "If you wanted to dance, you just had to ask nicely. No need to say lies about me."
He should have played dead, but their eyes meet before Tony thinks of it. He quickly closes his eyes anyway, but when he cracks one open again, the wolf is still looking straight at him.
"Yeah, it's hotter in there, 75 degrees as recommended by the vet," Tony says. "They like to sleep in it, without this big weirdo looming right over their heads." DUM-E droops at that.
Tony watches a few turns and asks Nebula to clarify what are good and also less interesting symbols and what they’re worth. His questions have caught the attention of a friend of the player right next to Tony. It's a young man with an easy grin, a contrast to his pal who keeps scowling at the other players, especially when they take from his hidden tiles. After throwing Tony and Nebula increasingly frequent, curious glances, the onlooker chimes in with his own comments on the game.
Barnes slightly raises his chin, and his shoulders have relaxed a bit. Good. "Lots of assholes looking for weapons?"
Well shit indeed. Anthony doesn't know what is going on. If what he just saw is a genuine memory, then Yon-Rogg lied to him for years. Anthony goes through what he remembers being told, the speech about how Yon-Rogg saved his life, gave his own blood-
The boy sounds amazing. Tony already has a soft spot and he wonders if he became attached as quickly the first time he met Peter.
He grabs Tony's face with both hands and tilts it up, wipes a tear that has rolled on Tony's cheek with his thumb and brings him in a deep kiss. He makes it as life affirming as he can, strong and sure.
"You're saying that if Lilly dies, I die?" Steve asks, appalled. The stoat makes a distressed sound and runs back to him.
"Awesome." Tony caresses the hull when they climb aboard the ramp leading into a small cargo bay. The door that leads to the habitable part of the spacecraft opens to reveal a woman. She's blond, fit, and in a uniform in blue and red with gold highlights and a star on her chest.
Steve would appreciate it if the universe could give him a break, just for once. He glares at the phone that is vibrating on the table and wishes he could throw it at the wall.
Near Tony, Carol is now shimmying in a more traditional dance style instead of waving her hands up. A young woman by her side looks delighted, and soon several dancers are cheering Carol on. Some imitate her with mixed success, which is hilarious. Tony can't resist and follows suit, and they immediately start dancing together. They're not even touching, but they’re focusing on each other and on having a blast. Carol's an excellent dancer, silly moves exaggerated for effect, and they’re quickly challenging each other. Tony's twist gets answered with disco moves, the vogue by Carol doing the hand jive, the chicken by swimming motions and Carol pinching her nose and simulating going under water. It grabs the other dancers’ attention, the Iantusians plus Steve and Nebula now forming a loose circle around them.
In the ensuite, Tony finds light linen-like pants with drawstrings that will do well as pajamas. There’s a sonic shower like the one in the ship—too bad, actual water would have been great—and in ten minutes he's cleaned up and ready for bed. After another glass of water, Tony reenters the bedroom to find Steve closing the room's curtains.
From the moment the portal began to pull Tony in, he's cursed that he was too far from the console to attempt to stop it. Steve hit several buttons to no avail and even suggested ripping off the power source. Tony stopped him, afraid the window would shut down with his limb still trapped. That's when Steve tried pulling him out, with no result. Probably too late, Tony spots what looks like a remote control.
"Noooooo!" Tony exclaims, hands on his hat, while everyone laughs, Steve included. Tony is so good when performing for an audience.
A few minutes and a flight of stairs might not be a bother, after all. The first thing that Tony does when they reach Steve's bedroom is to light the oil lamp.
He puts his hand on the center of Steve's chest and pushes him gently so he steps back. Confused, Steve goes with the movement, which allows Tony to enter the room and shut the door behind himself. Tony is brimming with nerves when he closes his fingers, trapping Steve's soft T-shirt in his fist.
Steve raises his arms—finally—and Tony starts pulling off the T-shirt while pushing down Steve’s pants with the other hand. He can multitask if it means Steve is naked faster.
It's fortunate that Tony was holding Steve down because he strains to bow off the bed, crying out in a mixture of pain and pleasure. He's strong, so strong, but that's the only thing that Tony processes before he swallows his first mouthful and groans at his turn. Steve tastes incredible, his magic potent, and it seamlessly transfers to Tony in a way he's never felt before. The rush of it makes Tony's head spin, and he sucks in more delicious blood, drinking eagerly.
It wasn't meant to maim, just warn, and Tony admires his restraint under the circumstances. A close encounter with vibranium is a shock to the Starforce.
The confession pleases Tonys, judging by the groan he makes, another layer of sensation reverberating in Steve's cock. His eyes shoot open when Tony uses the grip he has on Steve's hips to pull him deeper, right down his throat.
It's said with affection, but Tony can't help but bristle, showing his teeth. Very pointy teeth. He had no choice about this form at all, and he's not
"Well, he asked," Steve says while smiling in return. He's still thrilled that it came from Tony and that he didn't have to awkwardly ask to go back.
"Very creepy," Nebula agrees, nose scrunching in disgust. "They're genetically engineered to be their version of perfection, but it doesn't even make up for their lack of personality." She pauses and her mouth lifts in a small smirk. "They despised Rocket."
He's wiggling his fingers at Callie, who can't be bothered to bat at them. She just reaches out and pushes Jim's hand away with a hint of claws. Those things are sharp, and Rhodes gets the message and leaves her be.
Steve puts ground roasted beans in his tinned iron pot on the stove and mixes in water. It will take a few minutes to boil, and meanwhile Steve pours himself another whiskey.
Which… yeah. It isn't just the cats, but he's not going to say that, is he? Steve feels Sam's gaze on the side of his face and silently wills him to stay quiet.
"Please do," Steve says, heart melting anew when he sees Calliope peek out of the house. The sisters are a lot fluffier than they used to be, and she looks like a small cloud. "Hey, princess," Steve says, "Come out so I can see you too."
"Thank you, by the way," Tony says, "For rescuing them. I still cannot believe someone threw these precious babies in the trash."
Tony's not convinced fate is a thing, not to meet someone and fall for them. But he believes that Steve and him have a spark, and probably always do if they cross paths, whatever comes out of it. Steve's declaration gives very little space for a misunderstanding about his current feelings.
"I'm certain you would, but it's a lot of—" the doctor trails off when he sees, just like Steve does, how Tony is digging his heels in. He's so fierce and has so much love to give.
"I know," Steve says with a brightness and excitement in his eyes that Tony has seen a thousand times. Tony has a werewolf for a fan! Wonders never cease.
Tony turns to the other customer, his PR smile in full force. "Sorry to barge in, sir. May I cut the line? I'll pay for your visit
"I wouldn't call it an absurd amount of money," Tony replies, safely back in his cocky persona as he rolls his eyes for show. "In fact, the Doc refused to let me compensate him. Insisted on it over and over."
"No. Are you ready?" Tony asks, kissing Snowball's head but talking to Steve, a smile curling his mouth. Goddamn. He's so gorgeous, it overwhelms Steve sometimes.
It's Tony's first visit in months. Maybe he'll start to come by the Compound more often now. It's one of Steve's many hopes.
"If you think they're cute in pictures, you won’t believe how hard it is to resist them in person," Steve says.
Steve puts his hands on the wall above the bed and obeys, shuddering when Tony traces the veins of his cock with his tongue, then circles the head. It feels so, so good already and he's not even entered Tony's mouth.
Tony has pushed around some of his equipment in the lab to build the sisters a play area surrounded by knee-high Plexiglass, about six by six feet. There is a shallow litter box in one corner, right next to a lacquered wooden crate that has a small opening which serves as a door. That's where the kittens must be hiding at the moment; DUM-E is hovering over the box and chirps excitedly upon seeing Steve, then points at it.
The captain rapidly covers his fear with an eye roll. "You're supposed to be in the training room. Yon-Rogg is pissed you're late again."
Whatever happens or doesn’t happen between him and Tony, though, Steve is confident it won't be in the next few days. He's not ready for it, at least; there is still some soul searching to do. But he can absolutely go enjoy some time with Tony and the babies as he does so.
"Do we know each other, from Earth?" And now Anthony's talking as if he believes her. Wanted or not, it
Right, Steve would worry about the sex footage, which is fair. But Tony now realized that the proposal was recorded, which is awesome. He loves his tech, and can't believe he lived without it for two whole years.
He's started walking, and Steve follows his lead. Steve must smell terrible, but for the moment it isn't much of an issue.
Steve is whistling as he takes out the groceries he just bought when Tony shuffles into the kitchen. He's adorably rumpled and the marks on his face tell an obvious story.
"Yeah, yeah," Tony interrupts, annoyance flashing bright for a second. "Same song, different verse."
Then one year in, give or take, Washington and finding out that Hydra was weaved throughout SHIELD happened. Tony noticed Steve wasn't quite the same after that, which he put on the trauma of making SHIELD fall and being faced by an enemy he had died to vanquish. Steve held him a little tighter when they were together, kissed him with surprising urgency, but he took his distances too. He'd go on unscheduled missions about Hydra something or other on the drop of a hat, always Hydra, alone or with his new friend Sam Wilson. He always came back agitated and reluctant to accept comfort, even if he said that the mission went fine. Tony did his best to help; he also put JARVIS on the case to find anything that could assist, which somehow made Steve twitchy instead of grateful.
Tony smiles back at him and for long seconds they just stand there like idiots, watching each other. It's a charged moment, and Steve entertains for the first time that his crush might not be as one-sided as he's always thought. Then Steve's phone vibrates in his pocket and breaks the tension.
Tony opens the image folder, and the girl is everywhere. Sometimes on her own, either posing or playing or just caught in a moment, but mostly with Pepper, Happy, Rhodey, or Nebula. And him. There are a lot of selfies where Tony is making silly faces with her or kissing her cheek or vice versa. His heart grows three sizes just seeing them so comfortable together. Who knew he could interact with a child like this?
Steve had considered Salt and Pepper, but he won't suggest it for obvious reasons. "I don't know. Famous sisters?"
Tony and JARVIS sent the information on the now-dead super soldiers and Zemo to Rhodey and Pepper on their way back. Hopefully there's enough to smooth things out with the UN and the lesser-Ross.
"Shit." Tony's lightheaded with revulsion. How disgusting do you have to be to sacrifice your own child for power? Just thinking about it makes him feel sick, and Tony doesn't even have a kid. But then he feels uneasy for a completely different reason. He turns to Steve. "But… if someone needs to be sacrificed to get that stone..."
Steve realizes that he's been grinning like a fool at his phone. More from the text than from the picture, but no one needs to know that.
Morgan's birth. Morgan's first toothless smile, first steps, first time humming a tune—“Iron Man” by Black Sabbath, which he was elated about—everything Morgan and how he found proof that unconditional love exists because he'd do anything for Morgan.
"Of course," Tony says. He's delicately caressing the white kitten now, as if reluctant to stop touching them.
They zig zag on the lake for long minutes, but eventually Tony aims for the house where they easily climb the hill and stop at the top of the slope. A few feet away, Rhodes has started a fire that is crackling merrily, and there's a pan near the flames that suffuses the air with a deep chocolaty smell.
"No, no you didn't. It's true the name doesn't seem to fit. It's the ginger root," Tony says, turning to grab it.
Tony would gladly go on living like this if it wasn't for the constant sense of impending doom. It's a lot more tangible than the anticipation that has buzzed at the back of Tony's head since New York, and it brings its own stress. Tony considered continuing to appear dead to the rest of the world; the lack of expectation is pretty freeing, but it's counter-productive for the Lure-the-Kree plan. There is a very high chance that Kree sleeper cell agents are already on Earth, and that they'll report Tony's return to the Supreme Intelligence. And there are the Avengers to think of as well, so even if the assholes don't come back immediately, something big will happen at one point that will require Tony's help.
"Well, I'm sorry to burst your bubble, but we have to move now. We have a hit on a time and location for a transaction in Portland. It might be our best shot to catch both the people making the weapon, or their broker, and a client."
Just before he leaves the compound, his backpack filled with gifts for the kittens and a few changes of clothes, Steve runs into Sam and Rhodes in the rec room.
It's as if dominoes fall into place one after another in Tony's mind, and it's hard to mask his surprise. Dugan called Steve 'Cap', which has to be because he's the elusive Captain America. The Army's secret weapon, an extraordinarily strong soldier who fights like a demon.
Is that a little smile? It's barely there, a light upward tilt of one corner of her mouth, but somehow Tony guesses that Nebula rarely allows her guard to come down. It fills him with warm joy that he amuses her.
He tries to be gentle, but Steve rears back as he wakes up, immediately alert. He almost falls out of the chair, but the moment he locks eyes with Tony, he relaxes his shoulders and smiles.
"Was Bruce with you?" It's a petty question, childish even, but he needs to know. The mere thought of it hurts.
He raises an arm and cups Tony's cheek; this close to such a satisfying feeding, Tony must sport a healthy-looking blush instead of his usual pallor.
"What?" Shocked, Steve goes from staring at Tony to checking their doubles interactions with his jaw almost unhinged, which is frankly pretty funny.
Doctor Martin shakes his head. "We don't have the staff to care for them around the clock, and they'll be better with a foster family, anyway. They might even have a nursing mother at the shelter."
That isn't foreboding at all. She makes it sound as if there's something big he hasn't been told yet, which must mean bad news. And if it's bad compared to the Decimation, which they've discussed...
After another long look over her shoulder at Rumlow on first, Natasha winds up and throws a good curveball. Unfortunately, Ward connects hard, turning it into a line drive heading straight between second and third. Steve judges the angle and starts running at a gallop, in hope to limit the damages. He curses inwardly because this is bad, very bad. Hopefully they can keep Rumlow from reaching third base or score.
They don’t cross through the portal, so there's no sound for the scene before them. An Iron Man armor appears and starts fighting the robot too. All the 'villain' beans start flying together and attack the suit, punching him back. Clearly, Iron Man is overwhelmed by the many evil beans… until a sudden assist by Mjolnir, and soon after the Avengers arrive. But it's not quite the line up as Tony knows it.
"I'm not surprised," Tony finally manages to say. "She always acted as if she had something to prove or atone for, even if she’d done it a hundred times over. Damn. Anyone else?" He's afraid to hear the answer, but knows it's better to know now rather than later.
There's a story there, the way she said it so knowingly, but Tony doesn't know her well enough yet to broach the topic and it isn't the time or place for it.
"Yeah, that's it, closer baby," Tony says, his other hand guiding Steve's hip to urge him towards his mouth.
Or, to be honest, Tony thought he was the expert, but he just learned about Wakanda yesterday. He hopes to visit soon; it sounds amazing.
They face the now-quiet guests, two hundred people or so by Tony's quick count, most in rich attire or partial armor. It's an impressive-looking crowd, but Tony was expecting it.
"What about her? Is she afraid of him?" Callie doesn't strike Steve as a nervous kitten at all, although she is more guarded than Snowball.
"Incoming," Steve relays on the comm link as Tony gets off his lap. "Seventeen for now. Hold your positions, follow the plan. Comms off unless emergency. Rogers, over."
Steve scans Tony's face and somehow his smile widens. He gets off the bench to kneel on the Quinjet floor and fishes out the dog tags from under his uniform. Tony fixates on the gold ring that's on the chain and his mouth is suddenly dry. Steve thought Tony was dead and he kept the ring he'd bought around his neck for two years? After deftly opening the chain, Steve lets it and the tag fall to the ground, keeping the ring. When Steve looks up at Tony, his expression is that mix of nervous and determined that always announces a leap of faith (or that he's going to do something incredibly stupid). He takes Tony's left hand in his, rearranges his pose to be on one knee, and goes for it, blue eyes so bright that Tony can't look away, entranced.
"Of course! God, Tony," he says, soft and careful in the way that Tony missed so much (the Supreme Intelligence never got it right).
"Eventually. But not right then; he escaped. He hid for a few years, trying to make sense of everything."
Steve places three beeswax candles on the floor shaping a triangle around Tony, then traces sigils on each side directly on the kitchen tiles with a piece of chalk. He's meticulous about it, triple checking the grimoire for each symbol even though they look perfect on his first attempt. If he could, Tony would tell him to relax as it will be fine even with variations, as long as the meaning is there.
"Tony," the Steve waking up says, voice rough. He seems disoriented, which is to be expected in a situation like this. "What?"
"You've heard my man. Get out of here before we make you," Tony says, letting the cosmic energy charge his hands.
Steve is pinking up, but he nods, seeming convinced. "I bought the ring a month in." He makes an amused but self-deprecating smile when Tony can only blink, shocked. "Even I know that's too quick. But I just want you to understand that I've always been serious about us."
“I’m a scientist, Your Majesty. By nature I am skeptical of things I don’t understand or can’t explain.”
"All right," Steve says as Jim leaves them for the moment. He can't stop smiling; this is going to be fun.
"What do you want?" Steve asks, hands running up and down his back in long caresses that are lighting Tony up inside.
That being said, having Tony back at the Compound would be great. For one, Tony wouldn't be by himself in this big tower and the team could make sure he's fine. And maybe, when the time is right, Steve can grow a pair and ask him out.
Orange Lady on his left picks a tile from Kol, who without surprise steals Tony's newest one. It's exactly what Tony hoped for, and he takes a mid-level yellow tile from the dealer and puts it facedown. He's perfected his poker face a long time ago, and he hopes that it's as effective as it used to be because he's got a fantastic hidden deck right now. And there's only one hand to go.
"Huh, so it wasn't a joke," Viv blurts out, before putting her hand in front of her mouth and blushing.
It's true that, just like Tony, everyone in Timely is still calling him by the title, on a break or not. Red Wolf offered him the badge back, but Steve didn't want it. Not now, at least. He's feeling almost back to full strength, but some days are still rough. He wishes for a bit of time before taking back the responsibility.
Bucky is just as hyper as Tony is, and that means trouble. Which he proves when he hollers at Tony. "Hey, short stuff!"
"Tony. When you left, when you died, my world collapsed again. I am so, so grateful that you are back in my life to make it worth living once more, just like when we met and grew to know each other the first time. I love you, and you would make me the happiest man on Earth, in the Universe, if you agreed to share your future with mine, to make it ours. Tony Stark, love of my life, would you do me the honor of becoming my husband?"
Anthony is trying to shake off the memories, or at least open his eyes to see who's analyzing them in real time, but he's too weak. Power dampeners, he realizes, different from the implant in his back. He'll need a minute. Especially since the images he sees are moving as if someone is prompting his mind to go faster, to something significant. Memory-Anthony is now working on a device, the core for an exquisite and advanced light-speed engine, and checking out plans and a notebook. There's also a screen that is split in two, one half in Kree and the other in another language.
Steve goes straight to bed when he reaches his floor, but then spends several long minutes staring at his ceiling. He
"We? There are more like you?" Somehow Steve seems safe; he didn't hurt Tony after all. But the idea of a pack of werewolves roaming around the forest sends a chill down Tony's spine.
"Thanks." Steve is already trying to extend his stay as much as possible. He'll grab everything he can get. "I'll pack my bag and hit the road, then. See you later!"
Talk about what? Those other realities? Tony doesn't know what good could come of that. It's not as if they can control how other versions of themselves made different choices than they did. He almost refuses out of self preservation.
"Involuntarily for me, but yes." Tony extends his right hand to shake. Fury quickly assesses the handholding with Steve, stopping on the golden ring on Tony's finger. His eyebrow hikes a bit on his forehead but he doesn't comment, only grabs Tony's hand to pull him close and tap his shoulder in a brief hug.
"I agree the Krees are the bigger threat, but I don't think they'll arrive just now. Maybe we should look into that super soldiers thing. I've seen the tapes and the damage Barnes can do. It's best not to have that kind of power times five in a bad guy's hands."
"The clinic received a generous anonymous donation to support their new program offering low-cost vet services for qualifying low income pet owners," FRIDAY pipes up.
"Thanks Cap!" he quips, throwing his arms around Steve's torso and rubbing his jaw against Steve's affectionately.
They still alternate when feeding the babies, but in his head, Steve can't help thinking of the black kitten as Tony's. They have clearly bonded, and Steve's been extra attentive to the white in return. But it feels wrong to say they have favorites. Is this how parents feel with actual human children, too? Probably.
Steve and Tony look at each other, surprised. This is news for them both, and clearly for their daemons too. Steve's ears are pinking in embarrassment, but he doesn't protest. Tony is perfectly aware he's been carrying a torch for the good captain for months now, and he suspects Cora knows it. But is Lilly being touchy-feely and affectionate with Tony in return a sign that Steve likes him back? It's an intriguing and exciting possibility.
The doctor shows Tony and Steve how to wash her little face with a wet wipe, and then how to stimulate for ejections. It's not complicated, but Steve wouldn't have known how to do it on his own. By the time the vet has gathered the supplies needed, including the heating pad in a box, Tony has finished feeding and cleaning up the black kitten. She's finally calm and drowsy.
"I am hurt that you miss me so little, you do not even speak of me to your friends," the winged lioness tells Thor. Because of course she talks too.
Tony emphatically agrees, hard and aching in his breeches and more turned on than he's been in forever. Steve's lips are pinker from the kiss—making him even more irresistible, which should be illegal—and his eyes are now almost all pupils.
"Shit, oh my God. Okay, okay." Steve puts a hand over his mouth for a moment, eyes scanning Tony. "I suppose something happened and you're stuck like this."
Tony perks up. "Oh, right! So I'll keep this devilish good look for a while then?" He makes happy crowd noises. "And the world rejoiced."
Thor isn’t on the contact list. Tony thought he would have solved the electricity surge problem by now, or maybe he did and Thor just doesn't want a phone. What is strange, though, is that Tony has to do a search to find Clint's thread: they haven't texted since 2015. He's shocked that his conversation with Steve stopped about a year later, in June 2016. Steve isn't a big texter from what he still remembers, but the last thing Tony said to him was "Come on, please call me. It's important!" and then nothing. What did Tony do for Steve to not want to talk to him? For seven years? And Clint too! Something happened, it must have, and Tony almost gets up to go ask questions, but he's not in the mood to learn how badly he fucked up.
"I enjoy singing to you the most, though," Drunk-Tony says, leaning in but talking a bit too loud. The son of a gun is definitely flirting, and Tony can't help but admire the move.
Steve has a hand on Tony's arm, too, and Tony wishes that he wasn't in the armor to feel the weight and heat of it. On the other hand, he's about to use the fact he's suited up to take flight himself and search for his daemon when there's finally good news.
There's a blackened wound on her abdomen, just off-center enough to not have been a killing shot. Anthony came so close. Vers is unsteady on her feet, and Anthony knows that if he is to survive, he needs to take advantage of her current weakness. He spits out the dirt that got into his mouth during his tumble as he gathers power.
"You fucking bet I am!" Vers exclaims, not ashamed at all. "The Krees kidnapped me on Earth, turned me into a human-Kree hybrid with Yon-Rogg's blood, and convinced me the Skrulls killed my family to fight an unjust war. Sound familiar?"
"Can I just say that you two are very cute, and if this story didn't include a boyfriend, I'd be certain you two are a thing," Carol says.
"Probably because she noticed my mooning over you. She told me you might be single, but she'd always be in your life, and close at that. If I couldn't accept that, then I should forget even making my interest known."
He's fantasized about having sex with Steve a thousand times, but something reared up to the top earlier, pun intended.
He's surprised that the lock screen, when it appears, is a picture of a small girl. She doesn’t look older than four years old, though Tony's always been bad at judging ages. Incredibly cute, for sure, and something very strong and fond stirs in his gut just from seeing her.
Unsurprisingly, Snowball responds, making everyone laugh. Being completely wet showcases even more how tiny she is, still.
"We did. Okay, so here it is." Steve takes a deep steadying breath. "In 2014, I discovered that Hydra was alive and well, weaved into SHIELD, our government, and the World Security Council. Among other entities."
He'd almost forgotten about Tal, who is growing impatient at Nebula's constant interference with his flirting.
He let her put him in bed without complaint because of the glint in her eye that Tony recognized from Rhodey in his most intense Papa Bear moods. Tony doesn't know if he and Nebula are close, but his injury worried her—that he got hurt to protect her must factor in too. She needed to make sure he was okay, which is sweet. It had been only slightly awkward.
Tony silences him with another kiss even though it's hard to do it right as they're both smiling, giddy to know their feelings are returned. Here, on Tony's porch and kissing with cold noses and the taste of chocolate on their tongues, Steve marvels that he's truly happy, without reservations.
He's probably saying too much, but he can't be bothered. For a moment, he wonders if the Iantusians intoxicated them on purpose and if it's a way to vet them too. Sort of a lie detector.
"But you did anyway," Steve affirms. What isn't a ludicrous sum for Tony probably fits that same definition for regular, or even rich people. And definitely for Doctor Martin.
"Still, it really looked that way. No one wanted to accept it, but Thor took us all to the scene… and shit, man, I don't know how you survived that blast. It destroyed the lab completely, especially where the experiment had been."
Rhodes smiles. "See, I knew you'd be for it too. But yeah. Thaddeus Ross, who is Secretary of State now—" Tony scrunches his nose. Ugh, he hates that guy, "—led a group that drafted what they call the Sokovia Accords. 117 nations are asking for ground rules. Not everyone agrees with the sentiment though."
“It was your choice not to divulge it before, of course!” Thor adds jovially. He’s making little sense. Is he talking about the form that their daemons took?
of schedule on several projects by the end of the day. But apart from his impromptu Lord of the Rings marathon two weeks back, Tony hasn't really taken any time off in a while.
Steve sits by Tony’s side, and the contact is reassuring in its familiarity. The couch is thankfully sturdy and doesn’t protest their combined weight even with the armor.
Naked grief is all over Steve's face. "We didn't know that a death was what it took. It's how we lost Nat. She jumped to save Clint."
"Oh, yes, please," Tony says, burrowing his fingers in Steve's hair. It makes him slow down a tad. They just exchanged almost promises of seeing this through, of exploring where they could go together, but he still wants to savor the instant.
He'd do anything for Tony, and by now, he’s very attached to the babies too. Steve is as invested in their well-being as Tony is.
"It's fine. I'm glad you'll be with me from now on. With us, where you belong, even without Iron Man. I've missed you. We all did."
He doesn't have to tell Steve twice. Instead of letting go of Tony, though, he brings one of their joined hands down between them. Tony jumps on the opportunity to make a fist around his own cock, and Steve's big hand closes over it as they start pumping together.
"Oh, right, the kittens," Sam replies with a smirk that rubs Steve the wrong way. As if the kitties are just an excuse, which they are
Tony relaxes a bit at the news. He rubs at his temples, a headache brewing that promises to be a doozie. His heart hurts too.
Tony tilts his head, zoning on the slip. Of course. "And not—? You've got your sights on someone, my dear Captain? Tell me more."
"Hey," Tony says, as gently as he can. He can't resist putting a hand on Steve's chest, right over the white star. Immediately, Steve raises his own hands to put them over Tony's, keeping it there. His heart is hammering under Tony's palm. "What happened on Asgard is not your fault. That's on the Krees, okay?"
That's definitely friendly banter, and Tony can't help but pause. Steve is still smiling like a loon.
"I think so too, maybe friends and family," Steve says. Some rogues didn't wear their old uniforms without patches, and since they looked like any other citizen, it made it even harder to ferret them out.
"Thank you," Steve says with a grateful smile. "And no, it's not a problem. Well, I don't think so. I hope not."
Steve grins when there's immediate meowing from the box. He's absolutely certain that it's Snowball, even if it's a lot louder and affirmative than the last time Steve heard her. And lo and behold, after a few seconds, a small black head with round blue eyes pops out of the house, yelling still.
Clearly, Rhodey isn't immune to them, as he sighs. "Fine. As long as you stay back and only web from afar, if needed, as we discussed."
"Yeah, she's a third heavier than her sister. In fact, Doc Martin said they're on opposite ends of a regular growth curve," Tony says as he calls Snowball over, who continues meowing with insistence. "By the way, he hates when I call him that and says it's neither funny nor original."
I realize I messed up as Kree blood is blue, not green... but Tony is special and I am leaving it that way because it comes up again. Sorry!
"That's it, good boy," Tony says, caressing his strut. "I know you're just curious, buddy, but they are very, very fragile. If they break, I can’t repair them." DUM-E makes a distressed noise at that. It must sound terrifying to him, that Tony admits to not being able to fix something. "I know, it's scary. So only Steve and I can touch them, OK?" This time DUM-E clearly assents. "No touching, no water, no food, no foam, no toy, no nothing. Only me or Steve, no one else comes close."
Anthony does his best to cling to the conversation, to keep a grasp on consciousness, but the sounds ebb in and out. There's a sharp pain in his head that ends up throbbing below his temples, and a sudden image of a golden city takes over his mind. It's beautiful.
A charming, long-haired brunette alien with a bikini made of a cascade of delicate golden chains sashays to their table with painted lips and huge green eyes.
Things are starting to come back independently from the visions in the machine, as if summoned by what has been unlocked. The bald man was Obie, which comes with the duality of remembering him both as an almost-uncle, a rock he depended on, but also as the guy who tried to have him killed. It leads to a very strong series of flashbacks that Tony knows aren't in the correct order. Being thrust head down in a bucket of water, sitting in a military vehicle when all hell breaks loose, being operated on without anesthetic, fighting an Obie clad in a bastardized Mark-I suit, Yinsen dying—
"What?" Tony asks, stunned. He scoots to the side of the mattress to see Steve lying on the floor, stiff as a board and panic written all over his face.
Cowboy-Steve—who is insanely sexy and Tony will cherish the visual for years to come—clearly doesn't see the intruders in his little dusty town. As he reaches them, Tony lifts his hands in protection by reflex, but Cowboy-Steve walks right through him. It doesn't hurt or feel like anything in particular, but hair rises on Tony's arms, anyway. Now that he looks at Steve, his own Steve, and at himself, he notes they are slightly translucent.
"Oh my God," Steve breathes out, clutching at Tony's waist. He's short of breath and cross-eyed at this simple praise. Also hard enough to pound nails.
Showing a surprising amount of sentiment, Reed doesn't immediately use the remote. Tony wants to scream, and maybe run away as the wedding progresses, but he can't bring himself to do it. At the same time, he's mesmerized by how his destiny changed just because he has no Y chromosome here. Respecting his Steve's wishes, he endures this reality's happy couple ceremony, where Thor ruminates on the sacred bond shared by battle companions, and then they exchange their vows.
Nebula follows Tony to the edge of the table where he sets out to observe first. It's a game played with metal tiles about as big as dominos. The engraved symbols on one side of the tiles aren't familiar to Tony, unsurprisingly, and there are at least six colors he can see right now. At first glance, the game looks similar to poker. A series of tiles are on the table near the croupier, and more are in front of the players, some faceup and the rest facedown. Six players are observing each other, in competition.
"Life's a bitch," Tony says, laughing, then fires at a Kree right around the corner of the casino. He doesn't think it's necessary to say that if Tal had wished to end up in Tony's pants, he would have been disappointed even without the Krees showing up. "Hey Jarons, you okay?"
Steve squeezes his eyes shut in relief, taking in a shuddering breath and kissing Tony's knuckles again.
Steve wouldn't say he can read Tony's moods and quirks correctly all the time, but he's getting really good at it. He thinks Tony understands him more too. Maybe, if they'd made more of an effort in the first few years of the Avengers’ existence, it would have been easier to work together without incessant squabbling and misunderstandings. It could have given Steve clues on how to better break the news of the Winter Soldier and Tony's parents. Or maybe there was just no proper way to do that, since it's so fucked up. But Steve is convinced they would have trusted each other more with important information and worries, and avoided Ultron. Heck, it's possible Tony wouldn't have quit.
Tony wonders what he did that’s so bad that Captain America didn’t want to talk to him for so long. Does he really want to know right now?
"Iron Man times five at a minimum, probably way more. No suit needed. I can fly, shoot photon blasts, manipulate cosmic energy, even enter binary mode, which is crazy cool. Also, superhuman strength, speed, endurance, and reflexes. Plus long lasting youth, it seems. It's amazing."
"Welcome to Asgard, my dear brothers-in-arms. I hope you feel as esteemed here as I do when I am in your company on Midgard. Skol!"
"Good!" She fixes Tony's hair as she's done a million times. Pepper then looks at Steve, who hasn't been further than ten feet from Tony since the Quinjet, and tilts her head. "Hi Steve, it's wonderful to see you too. And it's lovely to see you smile again!"
It's the wait that's the worst, now that the Krees are close. The core is humming in the vault, and Tony feels as if he's vibrating at the same frequency. What is not helping is that Steve is so tense, Tony's own jaw hurts. Wanda looks mostly unconcerned, busy on her phone while sitting on a chair in the corner.
"And then we didn't talk for two years," Steve says. "Until Thanos, when he was collecting the stones."
There's a long pause, but at least they aren't shot at. For a moment, Tony worries that something happened to JARVIS, but the AI finally speaks up.
Looking for a distraction from the somber mood, Tony asks another question. "What do the Guardians of the Galaxy—I haven’t decided how I feel about that name, by the way—have to do with the golden people, and why will Nebula stay on the ship?"
Very few details of the two fights against Thanos, the one pre-Decimation and the one they won, have surfaced. The purpose of their current victory tour is to spin the final battle to their advantage, and they keep pretty mum on the defeat that came first. Tony read a compilation of the most far-fetched theories Carol has heard and it was damn entertaining. His favorite was how it wasn't the humans who defeated Thanos but Earth's terrifying fauna; stories about Australia must have circulated far and wide. Once Thanos was dead, the Avengers just had to grab the gauntlet and snap people back.
They need to destroy the Accuser Warship before the Krees realize they are losing—hopefully!—the battle, or they might fire ballistic missiles to pulverize them all, light-speed engine included.
"Callie, come on," Steve says, pulling a bit harder on the leash – which only drags the kitten along the floor about an inch.
It turns out that Tony's phone is in a compartment that slides out from the space beside his cot when you press on the wall. A bedside table drawer of sorts that he wouldn't have thought to look for.
"Rhodey didn't put anyone else in the suit, it's me. I'm the good news." He pauses and looks at Nat. "That's what you meant by good news, right?"
"Shut up. But back in New York, I didn't want to take the chance of facing Steve either, so I went to see Fury. I asked him if he had a mission for me, as making stuff blow up would have been a fantastic way to pass my excess aggression."
"Five Accuser Warships near Jupiter, one jump away. Another is coming closer," Carol is relaying from Talos' ship. "I'd guess a dozen fighter ships too, at a minimum. Are you still certain you want to go with direct confrontation?"
Well, that's not exactly right as most of them don't regret anything anymore. The two that fled surely do, though.
He then bends to kiss the bald little head in front of him, following it with a loud raspberry on the baby’s neck, which makes him laugh heartily. Tony grins in return, delighted, and it's the most beautiful thing that Steve has ever seen.
"I thought about nothing else for over a year. I studied you. I followed you. But now that you're standing here, I just realized... there's a bit of green in the blue of your eyes. How nice to find a flaw."
"Ha." Tony's not sure he wants to rehash the whole Accords fiasco, but he's still curious. "Is there something special with these guys?"
Carol has joined the fray, not using her powers at the moment as far as Tony can see. The Avengers are back to back and fighting those who dare come for them. Kol has decided to vent his frustration onto Nebula, maybe thinking she helped Tony cheat, which won't end up well for him.
"Oh!" Steve perks up. "Yeah, of course, I'll show you. Do you think you can stand up for one minute?"
"Told you to come any time," Tony says. More and more, Steve believes it. They're on a video call at the moment, and Tony's smile is as sincere as it can be. It's absolutely fantastic. Tony grabs Callie and makes her look at the camera. "Please, Steve, think of the children!"
"I really have no idea at the moment," Tony says. "How about you name one, and I'll name the other?"
"That's it, use your tongue. So good," Tony praises, petting Steve's head. "That pretty mouth looks amazing around my cock. Hell, you're gorgeous all over."
Still not letting go, Steve stretches long, fingers grazing the remote. It's absolutely infuriating.
"He did," Nebula confirms. Tony can't see her face as she's behind his left shoulder, but there's pride in her tone.
Steve grins. "Let’s just say that Ma wasn't impressed when, a month later, there were dozens of caterpillars in my window sill."
True. They had a sex marathon that lasted well into the night, leaving them both sated and exhausted. Steve can't help it, he wants Tony so much... Tony who was totally on board with going round after round, too. It was spectacular. Steve hates that he can feel a blush rising just from talking about it. Hell, he's hardening, too, that's how trigger-happy his libido is.
General Fury refused to disclose to Tony any information about the mysterious Captain America. If the rumors are to be believed, the man consistently pulls off extraordinary feats of courage for the Allies. Tony only found hints about the soldier in a few reports that are generally confidential or heavily redacted. The scraps of intelligence even contradict themselves. Captain America is either tall or scrappy, charming or a beast, acts alone or with an elite combat unit, etc. But what is consistent across the board is that the soldier is extraordinarily strong and fights like a demon out of hell for the good cause.
"God! You're killing me." Tony licks his lips, eyes searching Steve's face. "There's so much, if you're willing. I want your mouth, your fingers in me, your cock eventually—"
In no time at all the elevator has reached the platform, and Steve exits it with residual apprehension, scanning the space for Tony. He spots him sitting on the ground a few paces away, his back to Steve. Why is he on the floor? Worry spikes again and Steve cries out.
Fine, Tony should have had the "actually, I'm a vampire" conversation with Steve months ago, before he found himself stuck in bat form like this. But it had been fun to play the slow reveal with the seduction game. Tony hasn't been this attracted to anyone since the sixties, and he wanted to savor it. But he now needs Steve's help, and there's no more time for obfuscation or being mysterious.
A cool hand captures Tony's chin, and he's forced to look up at Frigga. The queen is serious but calm, which helps Tony relax. He feels as if her blue eyes see right through his soul. After a second, she smiles reassuringly and gently pats his cheek.
Clint and Natasha are their lookouts at the main entrance, on top of the regular Air Force personnel. They'll let the advanced Kree scout team in, purposefully, while making it semi-difficult. They stationed the rest of the Avengers and allies in the canyon next to the facility, cloaked by Wakandan tech, waiting for the bulk of the Kree force.
"Beautiful," Steve says, breath catching when the pants drop and he gets his first glance at Tony's dick and strong thighs.
Okay, so that is cause for a little preening and makes Tony perk up as he catches Steve’s eye in the mirror. He seems totally honest, and Tony's heart might be beating faster because of that. In the six months since the Battle of New York, especially after he separated from Pepper, Tony's teenage crush on Captain America has revived.
She sighs. "We are in very good health and therefore live very long lives. Several generations ago, the council implemented population control to keep the balance of resources. There is a lottery system for couples who want children. There are special neighborhoods, where young ones can grow up with friends, go to school, all of that. Just not in the capital."
Tony is indeed in the Meeting Room, halfway out of his armor as he often is if not fighting, and still wearing that blue tank top that showcases his arms so well. He's typing on his computer, so absorbed by the information on the screen that he doesn't even hear Steve walk to him.
They have nothing to lose, after all. If it's this universe's F4, then they won't be able to interact, and Tony will open a new window from there, no biggie. He offers his hand to Steve again, and they step through without a glance back.
“I get it, I know you. It’s fine. Magic has us all turned around, huh?” She rubs her beak on Tony’s cheek, as if giving a kiss. It makes Tony chuckle.
"Look over there, in the back, near the brick wall!" Steve points, while making very sure not to touch the portal.
. Tony wondered once or twice if one day they'd end up kissing instead of fighting. But there was Pepper, until there recently wasn't, so it went nowhere.
"We fought him together?" If they at least were able to put aside their differences when the world was about to end...
Steve's eyes are brimming with tears. "She was at the wrong place at the wrong time, a witness. They disguised it as an accident."
"Look at you," Tony croons, pumping him a few times but letting his other hand roam over defined abs and bulging pectorals. "You're gorgeous
A happy rumble is the wolf's response as he crawls a little closer to Tony, who dares to reach out to touch the blond head. Its fur is very soft, and Tony pets it gently. The wolf sighs with satisfaction, and Tony notes how its eyes are closing. There are two darts on the back of its neck that the wolf either didn't notice or couldn't reach. Tony hurries to take them out, wondering what they were loaded with. If Hydra knew what they were up against, and all signs point that way, it must have been a hard sedative. Judging by how the wolf was hit with at least ten darts without even wavering, the chemical clearly wasn't strong enough. Until now that is, because the wolf is definitely currently fighting for consciousness.
He pitches it as humor and banter, and it thankfully gets the intended result. Steve stops checking the interior of a tent to look over his—wide and perfectly muscled—shoulder, smiling again. Boy, he's so pretty, it's insane.
Her entire demeanor is a weird combination of eager, shy, and a little too blunt. But if it can make her relax, why not?
"Yeah? Well, Pep—" he starts and immediately his face falls. As if for a moment he'd forgotten his break up and it came back all at once. Shit, that was not the plan at all. He looks so lost that Steve wishes they had the kind of friendship where he could gather Tony in a hug without a word.
People are moving to rhythmic music, though it looks more like swaying from side to side, both feet planted in place on the ground and hands in the air. It reminds Tony of those inflatable arm-flailing tube men used as advertisements, but it seems as if the Iantusians are having a blast.
"Hard to say with newborns, but yes, it seems to be two girls. Give me a second," the doc says, reaching for the phone. "Sandra?"
"Yes." She looks around until she finds a piece of paper and folds it into a small triangle. She then sits across the table from him. "Get in position," she says, holding the paper triangle up with a mechanical finger, ready to flick it his way. Huh. Tony had no idea paper football was common throughout the galaxy.
On the small stage, Thor is beaming at the crowd. For an instant Tony thinks he's the one getting married, until he realizes he must be officiating, and that it's actually Steve who's the groom. He's fully costumed in the Captain America uniform, with Barnes by his side in black and dark blue leather, metal arm on display. Witnessing that Steve is marrying Bucky is a punch directly to Tony's gut, though not a surprise.
"So we came back to Earth. Since your wish was for the Avengers to continue to operate as before with the money you set aside for us, we did just that."
"Surely you wouldn't forget a face like mine," Anthony says with a wink. Okay, so if he's flirting on top of everything else, it's a sign that he's sliding towards her side of the story.
"They made it a bigger deal than it had to be, it was just a basic motherboard. Don't get me wrong, though, it was fun."
For at least the tenth time since he left the Compound, Steve wonders if visiting Tony at the former Avengers Tower without prior warning is a good idea. Steve wasn't lying when he said that he'd miss Tony when he quit the Avengers after Ultron; he does fiercely. Tony had kept sporadic contact since, but it’s not enough for Steve's taste. It’s not something he can control, though, apart from initiating a few text conversations or hoping to catch Tony when he visited upstate. Tony has been gone for months, but he's been isolating more than usual for three weeks now.
Tony raises his eyebrows. "You'd prefer it if I freaked out? Like when I thought you were about to eat me?"
No, it doesn't. It's a room with machinery, very industrial, dark and gloomy. They shouldn't be in any danger, though, as they're not in phase with this Wild West town and Tony's hypothesis is that they'll only be corporeal in their own reality.
"Don't act like a puppy with me," Tony says, though he admits it could be cute in a different context. "I just saw you kill five men."
"Wow. You're always gorgeous, but like this?" Tony takes a few steps and touches Steve's shoulder, then drags his hand to Steve's chest, then his abdomen, finger tracing the edge of his muscles. It feels so good and Steve wants more, needs Tony to grab his cock, which he doesn't, not yet. "You're spectacular."
Tony cranes his neck to look at the sky and he understands why anyone with a brain who isn’t  with them would bail. Carol is done destroying enemy aircraft and is suspended in the air, lit up on fire, arms extended. Everything in her body language is pure confidence with an underlying dare to any stragglers still around to challenge her next.
"How the fuck did it come to that? I told you what I'd seen in the wormhole!" He's getting agitated, and his anxiety is flaring up just thinking of it. The worst is that it became a reality, didn't it? "And look what happened. Thanos came back, as I said." It's so ridiculous. He can't believe they split the Avengers. "Over oversight? That's not even a bad idea," he mutters the last bit to himself.
From what Steve learned—gossip or otherwise—Tony's more of a ladies' man. He followed a few working girls upstairs at the casino, in the early days, with a noted preference for the red-haired. The Madam said Tony was a model customer, too. She's quick to tell Steve about the violent ones, which he appreciates since he aims to run them out of town before something bad happens. It's been a while since Tony indulged, though, not that Steve has been keeping tabs (okay, fine, he's been keeping tabs).
Unsurprisingly, most of the questions had been for Rhodey, T'Challa, but especially Steve. He'd been very honest about his reservations about the current document and why he hadn't signed. But Steve also said that he believed they could be improved, and that the most important thing was for the Avengers, and other superheroes, to work together.
"Eh," Steve says with a shrug. "Come on, eat up." He unwraps one of his own burgers and takes a big bite.
The atmosphere is festive in the garden where they end up. What they couldn't see on the portal itself is that there's a string quartet plus a piano that are playing some Rachmaninoff. Tony's always loved him, and the group is talented. There's also a lot of chairs set up in perfect rows, complete with bouquets and a little stage up front. It is clearly a set up for a wedding, overhead flowery garlands included. In fact, a pretty brunette with a yellow summer has taken a microphone from the band's set up.
"That's what you do for a friend who's innocent, asshat!" Tony says as he reaches the wall of the control room. "I knew about it. Rhodey didn't, though, so yeah, maybe he would have taken offense. But that was a truly stupid, stupid plan. Get out of here, right now. We're bringing you in."
"There we go! Okay, so that's not my usual type of magic, so I hope you don't mind if I take my time making sure that I get it right."
It makes Tony snort. "Exactly. I'm pissed to know that Hydra had my parents killed. I am not thrilled to be face to face with the man who did it. But I don't blame you, I blame them. Okay?"
Tony catches him staring, and in a fit of courage Steve holds his gaze instead of averting his eyes. Acting normal might not be the best move right now. Steve doesn't know if he's broadcasting his feelings as strongly as he thinks he is, but letting them show could be a good thing. Tony can do whatever he wants with the knowledge, if he can decipher it. He's not looking away either, chin tucked on the top of Morgan's head, and Steve dares to hope it means something good.
"Alright." So Tony eventually earns Steve's forgiveness; that's great. It comes to reason that Steve will want to give it again. Hell, he wants to. It's clear as day. Tony drums his fingers on his sternum. "Okay. So it can wait until tomorrow."
Tony was holding her loosely, so Lilly could easily have gotten away. Instead, she kept wiggling while he poked her some more, and she attacked his fingers in return, all the while not hurting him at all, just tiny scratches and nibbles, as predicted.
Tony has the kittens on the leashes with him. Both girls have made a lot of progress since that first time Steve saw them trying out the harnesses, and are walking in front of Tony like queens.
Tony's eyes widen in surprise as Jim laughs. Steve can't break eye contact though, nervousness knotting his stomach. But then Tony starts smiling. The relief that follows is staggering and Steve helplessly smiles back. Oh God. His not-so-well-kept secret, except to Tony, is out in the open. And he's not being immediately turned down.
Tony didn’t think Thor would call him out like this. He’s aware that Frigga is very powerful and taught Loki most of what he knows.
Steve is breathing faster than normal, and he finally looks Tony in the eyes again, still holding onto his hand. "I won't let them."
As fantastic as the armor is, it can't protect his squishy brain from bouncing against his own skull. The next thing he's aware of, Tony is flat on his back and blinking to get the world— currently pretty blurry—back in focus. Shit, his ears are even ringing.
Which of course it did. You don't hear the adventures of the Howling Commando by your old man ad nauseam without knowing about James Buchanan "Bucky" Barnes, Steve's oldest friend and sharpshooter extraordinaire.
Responsible or not, Barnes killed his mom. And dad. Whom he actually knew, back in the forties, so that must have been another mind fuck for the guy.
Jim is probably not even out of the kitchen when Steve reaches for Tony's hand, thrilled when he interlocks their fingers. Steve's heart is racing and fluttering in his chest.
Rhodey continues his story. "They brought in a psychiatrist to evaluate Barnes. But he broke out of his bonds and began a rampage. Too bad, because I think I was just about to convince Steve to work with me on the Accords, from within. But when Barnes escaped, Steve and Sam followed. That was 12 hours ago, and Ross gave me 36 to bring them in or he puts out a shoot to kill order."
Tony does too. "And when they do recognize us, your brilliant plan is to convince the outlaws not to mess with us? Won't that paint a target on our back instead? Issue a challenge?"
The goal is to catch the Kree force in a pincer movement. At the front is Nat, Clint, Steve, and Tony, but also Ant Man, who suddenly turns gigantic. Tony knows that the Wasp is there too, but too small for him to see. On the sides are T'Challa with his warriors and the Dora Milaje, plus Spider-Man, who swings through the canyon webbing Kree after Kree. The kid is gifted, for sure. Two platoons of Asgardians warriors who came with Thor are also very enthusiastically kicking ass. Barnes is on the other side of the battle with Pietro, and the both of them are without a doubt thorns in the Kree's backside at the moment.
Steve cups his hands with the towel and Tony gently places the kittens on it. They barely weigh anything. After carefully folding the fabric in a nest around and over the kittens, Tony takes the bundle back. He's fully in protective mode, talking softly.
"What do you want?" Steve asks, as when they started. He thoroughly enjoyed Tony's guidance until now, and it seems a safe bet to continue on that path.
Tony lets his fingers trail down Steve's neck. He can feel his pulse, fast but strong, and he's never wanted to bite someone this much.
"Happy to be here." He didn't dare drop by unannounced, as much as they talked often on video chat, and Steve was delighted when Tony explicitly asked him to come over. "Thanks for the invitation," Steve replies. He points to the tube. "Hop in, I'll push you up."
It feels good, that's the thing. As far as Tony knows, Steve doesn't have a lot of experience at relationships. He would probably be a fun and attentive partner, too, and of course he's gorgeous. So even though Tony doesn't pursue Steve, he does nothing to close the door either, which is admittedly selfish. There is a nebulous possibility that is not unpleasant to toy with, and Tony just can’t bring himself to put an end to it entirely.
He's not surprised that the Krees knock off the base's camera, though the ones Tony installed himself resist so he can watch the Starforce team’s progress. He recognizes a few faces, unsurprised that his ex-team is at the forefront, but Yon-Rogg isn't there for the moment, if he even made the trip. After all, he spectacularly failed the mission to kill Carol on Xoria, and lost Tony in the process. Maybe the Supreme Intelligence put him in time out or completely disgraced him.
Tony wished as much, but sadly he doesn't think so. "I didn't see Dugan, Falsworth, or any of the others I suspect would be in Captain America's unit."
"True," Steve admits, planting his hands on the tube. It's been astonishing to do strength tests with Spider Man and realize that he can lift roughly twenty-five tons. Steve can't even lift one ton, though 1200 pounds is nothing to sneeze at. "But it's not like you can go full force, or you'll hurt her."
Before Tony can react, Steve leans down and touches their lips together in a careful kiss. It's very sweet, and Steve's face is cautiously hopeful when he pulls back to scan Tony's expression.
"Right behind you." Steve replies, and when Tony looks at him with a smile, Steve winks, which makes him laugh.
"I'm Will. I didn't know 'bout the cats, Captain. Honest," he says. Steve believes him; he seemed just as surprised as Tony when Steve fished the bag out. "There are a lot of strays around here."
Frigga nods. “Yes. They are Holy birds and bring information from all over the world to Odin. Huginn means ‘thought’, and Muninn ‘memory’ or ‘mind’. For some, crows also represent change or transformation, destiny, intelligence, higher perspective, being fearless and audacious, flexibility, adaptability—“
"I asked… I asked because I hoped you'd tell me what I want to hear." Steve's never been good with words for personal matters. He knows he's making this harder than it should be.
Steve stretches his neck and shoulders until a vertebra pops and then lets his head fall back. He's still tired too, even after a full night of sleep.
"Skol!" they all repeat in unison. Whistling and clapping follows. Tony takes a sip of his drink, which tastes great but will surely pack a punch, and glances at Steve. He nods lightly in return, giving Tony the go-ahead to answer first.
Most of the nanites have been used to form Tony's street clothes: a zipped, lightly weaved red sweater under a black leather jacket, jeans, and boots. He left enough in the reactor to make it glow blue, though.
True. That takes precedence by far. Tony hopes that his nervousness at seeing Steve again, and Barnes in person, doesn't show too much.
But now… it's a totally different ball game. Tony's single, mostly retired, and Steve is definitely not straight and interested right back. God, that kiss on Iantus had been perfect, until it ended abruptly. And most important of all: they might not have interacted much, but Morgan warmed up to Steve fast. She's Tony's priority now and probably forever, and Steve would be good with her—he's certain.
"Come here, sweetheart, it's okay now," Tony says, gently picking up the dark kitten. It fits in the palm of his hand and Steve melts at the way Tony immediately brings it to place a kiss on its head. "Shhh, shhh, I've got you."
With all the heart-churning revelations of the last twenty minutes, Tony had almost forgotten about Steve's crush. It seems inconceivable now that they were kissing earlier. As Steve said, they had a huge rift for years... but they eventually made up. Tony doesn't want to experience deep resentment twice; it's already hard enough as it is. He needs to trust that he'd let go for a reason, and do that again as fast as possible. But he's not sure that he's ready to lock lips with the man again, as gorgeous as he is.
"Oh, no, of course not!" Steve looks crestfallen. "I assumed it was going well! Tony, I'd never been with someone before. I didn’t know—especially not how it is now! I thought you'd tell me… Why didn't you ask me to stay? I would have loved to."
"No, we're all good. We'll round the Krees up, jail them for a bit. It's still the plan to send them back?"
Okay, so Steve's smart, so smart, but also a little dumb. Tony raises a wing and, slowly and pointedly, hits the magical barrier that prevents him from going in. Steve flushes red.
For example, when he flies Iron Man, he focuses on the mission, sure. That's his primary task, where he listens to Steve's orders and fights accordingly. But in parallel, he's running his own odds on the best actions to take, with the information he observes in relation to the mission's parameters and known intel. On top of that, he can also assimilate and use the data JARVIS streams on the HUD about environmental conditions, his teammates' positions, et cetera.
The night is very calm, almost eerily so. There's a fat, full moon hanging high in a cloud-free sky that lights up Tony's surroundings clear as day. The last intel on the enemy they have—brought in by himself and Rhodes, you are welcome, U.S. Army—is that the surrounding 25 miles are mostly secure. Tony came here to investigate the rumor of a secret Hydra base nearby, on Fury's demand. Unfortunately, he has found nothing, even after three days of flying over the mountains with Rhodes. The lack of results is why they're going back to London tomorrow.
