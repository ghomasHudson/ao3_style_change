Tony silenced him with another kiss, reaching under the water to line their cocks up so he could stroke them together. They both moaned at the contact, and Steve desperately rutted up into Tony’s hand. Tony clicked his tongue in annoyance and pulled away, only to roughly grab the base of Steve’s cock.
“You get hair down there?” Steve whispered to Tony, looking a little mortified at the thought, “Isn’t—isn’t that
Heat flushed his face and Tony snapped his eyes over to Rhodey, who was intently watching them while listening to Thor translate. His eyes widened and then dropped to slits as he smirked, clearly enjoying Tony’s embarrassment.
Growling low in his throat, Tony trudged back to the mattress, collapsing down onto it with a groan of pain. He moved until he was somewhat comfortable, staring at the empty bed across the room. A wave of nausea rolled through him as he thought of what Zola could possibly be doing to PJ—images of Afghanistan flashed through his mind, causing Tony to start shaking, despite the cell being fairly warm. Knowing he was hyperventilating, he forced himself onto his knees, curling up into a turtle formation even though new pain ripped through his ribcage and over his back.
“Maybe you can do some art magic, Cappuccino. Make something new out of the old, yeah?” Tony said, clapping a hand on Steve’s shoulder and giving it a small squeeze, “Good luck. Let me know how it goes.”
“I apologize. You must have been deep in thought,” Thor said, sitting down on Tony’s right, “I was sure you heard me--Nevermind. I will make sure to approach you from the front as to not startle you again.”
Steve’s quivering voice had all of them turn to look at their intrepid leader. Bucky still had him in a sort of chokehold, but Natasha stood by his side with a knife tentatively pressed up against his groin, easily giving him a reason to stay in place.
Bruce was the one to break the silence. “We should try to sleep in shifts. Then we can keep going at first light.”
“Becoming feral is a biological response to a bondmate being threatened…. or, at least, perceiving a threat,” she continued, “He needs to feel that his bondmate is safe. The problem is, he already
Steve slowly walked over from the forest line with his shield in front of him, wincing every time a liquid in the basin of the shield sloshed over. By the time Clint had set up a metal sheet over the fire, Steve had reached them, and with a tired smile, starting to pour the liquid out into circles on the metal sheet.
He wasn’t particularly used to sleeping through the night without waking up in a cold sweat, so when grunting woke him up instead of a nightmare, Tony groaned and buried himself under the covers, scooting back into the warm body behind him in an attempt to savor the moment. Steve made a noise and his arm tightened a fraction around his waist, but another grunt came from
“You are unlike any Alpha I have ever met,” Tony whispered, gently stroking Steve’s cheek with the back of his hand.
Looking back, the pain of Jarvis wrapping his broken rib still felt better than the dagger Steve had thrust into his back. He began to seek out the pain, no longer caring about keeping a low profile around Howard and staying out of his way. It was easy to jimmy the liquor cabinet open, and by the time he had drunk through a bottle of Howard’s favorite bourbon, his skin was too hot and clammy to really feel the fists and feet beating against it.
, and Tony couldn’t deny it. He almost felt bad that she wasn’t his type, but after seeing how flushed Steve’s face became the first day she clacked into the room in her red stilettos, he felt nothing for her but jealous contempt.
“He likes you, he just likes Natasha better,” Tony teased back, wrapping his arms around PJ, “Still. I think we should tell the team this. Then, if the others need to watch him because one of us is unavailable, they should have two people keeping watch.”
“He barely managed a five-minute nap because he had a nightmare! He’s not going to sleep!” Tony hissed, throwing his hands up, “I’m going to be up all night holding him because he can’t sleep and—”
Steve winced as he shuffled into the bathroom and attempted to strip off his shield and dirty garments. He groaned quietly and leaned against the sink, looking more pitiful by the second.
“How about that walk?” Steve murmured with a kiss to Tony’s temple, “Do you think you are up for it? Or do you still ache?”
“Wrong wording, beloved,” he sighed, looking up to watch Clint whoop and Bucky try to move toward him again.
Steve nodded once Thor translated, then suddenly looked over at him and waved his hand. Immediately, all of the people in the room dispersed, leaving him alone with Tony and Peter. Confused, Tony looked around, not understanding what Steve wanted, especially since he sent away the few people that allowed them to communicate effectively.
Steve’s cold nose pressed into his wrist and he gasped, shivering as the Alpha started to scent him, gently nuzzling and licking at the spot. He tried to pull away, but Steve was considerably stronger and held him in place, nipping one of his fingers in retaliation.
“It’s alright, I just wanted to make sure you didn’t fall or anything,” Steve said gently, an amused twinkle in his eyes, “You okay to sleep a bit?”
“I think you being scared will scare him more,” the Captain said calmly, attempting to be a solid presence, “Think you can keep it in just a little more? We can go…talk, once he’s asleep.”
“I’ve been here since you walked in, I was in the stall,” Bruce snorted, rolling his eyes, “But I know what that look on your face is, and it isn’t worth it. I already checked with Loki today, and he’s clean this week. Something about his mom being in town.”
“Then he doesn’t deserve you, Tones,” He was saying over the commotion, his mouth right by Tony’s ear, “You’re brilliant, funny, charismatic, charming—you’ve survived so much, and if he can’t see that because of some lousy girl, then he isn’t worth your time.”
His Mother’s voice caught through the noise, causing Tony to turn. She was smiling at him as she bent down to his level, pressing a kiss to his forehead.
? Jesus, Rogers, I leave for one goddamn minute, what did you do?” He sighed, hurrying over to PJ’s side, “Hey, baby, what’s wrong, huh? What’re the tears for?”
He looked up and smiled weakly at Steve, who had peeked his head out of the kitchen to give him a concerned look.
“Sam’s affectionate, but not like that,” he admitted, fiddling with the cap to his drink, “I try to be…romantic…but its definitely not my forte. I keep trying, though.”
,” Steve sobbed into his neck, attempting to grind his poor neglected cock up against Tony’s belly, “I
stupid,” Steve mumbled into Tony’s neck as he settled from his giggle fit, breathing hot air onto the skin and making Tony shiver, “We—we could have had this, or at least tried this,
Without hesitation, Steve leaned forward and took the piece from Tony’s fingers with his mouth, licking his fingers to clean off the lingering spices. Tony tried to suppress the shiver that ran down his spine and gently pulled his hand away, pretending that he was not watching Steve lick his lips. He finished off his food and occasionally shared more bits with Steve, even letting him have the last piece on the plate.
. He needed a wife, and I can be that to keep Peter safe. And, after the first few days, I… I am okay with it. Really. He tries, he really tries, and he is not your typical Alpha.”
“I could have told you that,” Tony muttered under his breath, slipping on his clothes once the nurse turned to grab an empty chart to start making notes.
He chose not to answer. Instead, he brought up Tony’s hand to rest the back of it against his cheek, stroking his arm with his free hand. Guilt wormed deeper into his brain as he felt how thin Tony had become, even in just his forearms. He had no doubt that if he were to see Tony nude, he would be a whisper of the bodily strength he once had. Starvation would do that to any man, something that Steve was well acquainted with. He closed his eyes and tilted his face in toward Tony’s hand, pressing a soft kiss to his wrist as if he could abate even a bit of Tony’s suffering with the affection. He continued his kisses down Tony’s arm, only to pull back when a soft noise from Tony made him freeze.
Tony blinked, then threw his arms around Steve’s neck, hugging him tightly. He ducked his head and nosed at Steve’s scent glands as he pushed all thoughts from his head. The pain was too much to bear.
“What? I—Bucky, stop trying to get at Tony,” Steve scolded, “I’m just saying, we don’t need to explain ourselves. What we do in Tony’s bed is our business.”
“Wait,” Tony said weakly, barely able to pick up a hand as Rhodey rode up and plucked Peter up to put in his own lap.
“He…we had a moment,” he decided on, only to quickly switch topics, “Anyway. Do you think you could help with PJ’s draw and examination? He’s a …a bit wary of the SHIELD docs. Not that I blame him.”
“Sorry,” he called, tipping his head forward to let the hot water roll down his neck and back, “Just throw that in a corner somewhere. I’ll deal with it later.”
“We have shit friends,” Tony said, frowning as Steve unbuckled him and helped him into his wheelchair.
“I think I’d say the same about Tony,” he joked before becoming serious, gently nudging Bucky’s ankle, “Hey. You and Sam are like that too, y’know. Maybe not as ridiculously sappy, but the affection is genuine. Given that you’re both military, it’s obvious in how relaxed you both are once you’re around each other. If you ask Sam to be a goopy romantic, he’ll probably do it better than Steve until they’re both fighting over who’s a sappier partner.”
Steve whimpered and shifted to spread his knees more, then bowed his back for a better angle. They both groaned once Tony was fully seated inside of him with his balls tucked up against Steve’s ass. He desperately wanted to move, but he first reached under to place a hand on Steve’s lower belly and pressed down.
“I--I know. I just do not want to keep him from you,” Steve mumbled as he attempted to give Peter back.
“Hey,” Steve said gently, causing Tony to crack open his suspiciously wet eyes, “You with me, Iron Man? Or do you need a minute?”
. I want you, Steve, I do. But we both know that that is a risk and I do not know if we can take it, my love.”
“Jesus, Tony, no. I know you can’t have that,” Steve interrupted, looking a bit horrified himself, “Besides, I wouldn’t even know where—”
will not be that way with me,” Tony said, to which Bruce laughed again, “What? I have no time for bottled-up emotions and brooding. If he wants to be that kind of Alpha to me, he can do that by himself.”
“Alright, is everything okay in here?” he asked as he walked into PJ’s bedroom, seeing Bruce press an electric thermometer to the child’s forehead.
“Oops,” he said, sighing in relief when Tony let out a small giggle, “Alright, new plan. Let’s try a sponge bath. If that’s still not working, we’ll just do spot cleaning, okay? Okay.”
“Sorry, I do not mean to disturb your rest,” Bruce said, hurrying over with a jar in his hand, “I made up your medicine for you—are you done with that?”
“Thanks, Cap. I appreciate it,” he murmured, ignoring how feeble he sounded, “Really. It means—it means a lot to me.”
Steve’s only acknowledgment was a sharp exhale through his nose. Tony ignored it and took his hand to pull him into the bathroom, pretending as though he could not feel how heavy their bond was with his mate’s guilt. He left Steve standing by the counter so he could grab the medical supplies he needed to re-disinfect and rebandage the wound.
“Well, technically it was Sam and James’ idea, not mine. I was merely the message relay-er since apparently, they had words with Steve earlier and are both in the doghouse,” He said, shrugging, “He was only bringing you guys the stuff in case PJ needed an overnight. Why? Did he say something?”
“I know. I know he is trying. This is new, for us both,” he said, looking down at Peter to watch the baby contently gum on his doll, “He had been so kind to us today, and I had to go and ruin it by fighting with him.”
“Natasha, you and Sam are up first. I want a clean fight; no knives, no arrows. And this is a tap session, so you should not be bruising each other. This is supposed to be a training in recognizing openings during a fight…”
“Captain, we’re taking him back for an examination,” a doctor was saying to him, “You need to let go of him. You’re not helping by crushing his fingers—”
Tony nodded and felt heat gather in his cheeks, so he quickly ushered Bruce out with the baby and closed the door behind him. Finally able to get a breath into himself, Tony kicked off his shoes and peeled off his shirt and bra, collapsing belly-down onto the bed with a sigh. The day’s emotions exhausted him, and all he wanted to do was curl up with Steve, but thinking about the Prime only turned his stomach.
“Hey, hey, everything’s okay, pumpkin,” Tony soothed, reaching over to pet PJ’s hair, “You can’t come up yet, I’m sorry, but I’m right here. I’m okay, darling. Where’s Papa, hm? You chase him off?”
Looking back at his friend, Bruce nodded at him, giving Tony a small sliver of relief. With an inward sigh, he followed Natasha to the next room over, setting PJ down on a small chaise lounge. He carefully unwrapped the boy from the blanket, tossing it into a nearby trashcan before taking the shirt from Natasha.
“My dove, I did not mean to antagonize you,” he said softly, “I was merely taken aback by your words, is all. I know how you feel about having a bigger family and I agreed that we should wait until the war has settled and your father is no longer after your head.”
“Bonds strengthen when you use them,” Steve explained, spreading some sort of cream on his fingertips, “My ma… my mother taught me that with enough concentration and with good intention, you can push feelings into your bondmate. I always thought it was for emotional comfort, but using it to relax your muscles so you are not in as much pain also works.”
His face immediately dropped, and he could see that Pepper was about to say something, so he scooted to the front of the group to find his butler exiting the family limo.
“Why do you not want me to?” Tony asked in return, raising an eyebrow when Steve’s face colored pink, “It is not like it is something I have not seen before.”
“Covers the vehicles around the area,” T’Challa confirmed with a nod, “But Sergeant Barnes is correct. We’d be funneled in.”
“He doesn’t even like me, so how would that work?” Bucky grunted, raising an eyebrow as PJ crawled out of the bed to situate himself onto Tony’s lap.
He laughed and Tony smiled, turning his head to nose at Steve’s temple. Not everything was said that needed to be said, yet it was enough for them to be able to relax without constant worry. It made Tony want to get up to bring Peter over for cuddles even though the babe was happily sleeping on his own on the other side of the room. Steve seemed to feel the same since their bond swelled with affection as he leaned up slightly so he could peek down at the crib.
He reached over to grab the cup of water to offer to him, from which Tony happily took a small drink to ease his throat. Leaning back with a sigh, Tony sadly rustled his cuffs, turning a pleading look to Rhodey. He pouted ever so slightly, only to grin when Rhodey relented.
, and he’d slept so well in it for once that he didn’t feel like leaving. With a nod, Tony flopped over and tucked himself further under the sheets, groaning as he felt the bed rise when Steve stood.
Surprisingly, he found most of the other Avengers all pitching in to put PJ’s room together. Noticing him first, Clint waved in a hello, made sure Sam was still steady putting up string lights, then headed over.
“Not really,” Rhodey hummed, “I think you and Steve would be good together. A bit explosive, but it would work.”
PJ blinked, but seemed to understand with a small nod of his head. Looking past Tony, he saw Steve, making a confused noise.
“What the actual fuck?” Bucky exclaimed, leaping off the couch to run over to Tony, “Are you okay? Lemme see—oh jeez, Tony, at least it didn’t get your eye, but that’s gonna be red—”
“For the serious things, yes. He feels a lot of weight from leading the colony and believes he needs to shoulder it all himself,” Bruce said with a sigh, “Occasionally, Lieutenant Barnes can pry some sort of feelings out of him, but he mostly likes to stew. It can be heartbreaking sometimes, to watch him hold it all in when he knows we would all be there for him if he were to only ask.”
“I thought I’d lost you again,” Steve managed through his tears, rubbing his face against Tony’s neck, “When I pulled that helmet off—my world fell apart. I thought—”
Ignoring the nearly unbearable squeeze of anxiety in his chest, Tony leaned down to press a brief kiss to PJ’s temple before standing, giving the boy one last look as he turned to head over to his own room. Closing the door behind him, he threw his mind into getting-ready-for-bed mode, getting lost in his routine to avoid thinking. Once he was in his silk pajamas and standing in his room, Tony closed his eyes, feeling his heart beating erratically behind his reactor. Slowly, he backed up to the wall and slid down to the floor, drawing up his knees to his chest.
Tony squirmed at that and stepped closer to Steve, letting him put a hand on his hip. He offered a sheepish smile, and after a second, realization smacked into Rhodey’s face and he gasped.
“I never said I was good with emotions, but for your information, it feels… heavy. Thick. I am swallowed up by my anger and I do not know which way the surface is to allow me to break for air. Like I cannot be anything else
The illness had left him shaking from root to toe, which included his hands. Every time he tried to tip the wineskin down, the milk would slosh and he would pull back, afraid that he would accidentally pour it all over Peter and himself. Frustrated, tears pricked his eyes and Tony thrust the wineskin into Steve’s hands, motioning toward Peter.
, still—still some left, makes me sore,” Steve begged, leaning back as he cupped one of his pecs, “I can’t—”
“Shh, shh, my love,” Tony tried, taking a wobbly step back while lowering Peter into his arms, “Come now, sh-she was only concerned, not angry, not angry at
Steve nodded, offering a watery smile. He looked around at the team, took one deep breath, and stood, pulling Tony up with him without letting go of his hand.
“Hey. Hey you. Can you come out of there? Please?” He cooed to PJ, gently tapping the boy’s shoulder, “You’re going to get snot all over me, and as much as I enjoy holding you, the snot is a deal breaker. Will you let us clean up your face a bit? Huh?”
Looking up, Steve noticed for the first time that Tony’s brown eyes had a little ring of gold on the very outside of the iris.
“Perhaps you should retire for the evening, yes?” Bruce said, interrupting him, “Maybe some, ah, alone time together will help. I will have Thor send for someone to bring you both supper later.”
“I was tortured. They wanted me to build the new missile for them. Eventually, I agreed, but Yinsen and I came up with a plan. However, I had to fix up the reactor first. The battery was a liability we couldn’t afford.”
Tony sighed and turned around on his lap, ignoring Rhodey’s grunts of discomfort. He opened his mouth to explain what they said, but he was immediately assaulted with the scent of jealousy, coughing and moving his shirt above his nose to try and block it.
. Sighing, he traced his fingers over Steve’s robot drawing taped to his side of the cubby. He took a quick look around before bending down, kissing the picture shyly.
Tony answered him with a kiss as he pulled his hands away, then went to kiss Peter’s forehead as well. Satisfied that they could survive without him for a while, he left the bedroom for the infirmary, immediately hearing loud voices once he turned the corner. Thor’s voice was unmistakable, then came Bucky’s low tones and combined laughter. Once Tony walked into the room, he smiled, because Rhodey was sitting up in a bed between the two men, chatting with them while Thor translated despite looking worse for wear.
“Daddy’s sorry he left you for your first night alone,” he said quietly, pretending as though he did not want to yell from how much pain his body was in, “I missed hearing your tiny breaths when I tried to sleep. The Prime is warm, but not as comforting as you, my love. Perhaps we can cuddle tonight, yeah? Would you like that? More time with Daddy?”
“He—He said that you must truly be a broken soul, to mistake kindness for unkindness,” He said sadly, “He says he intends to show you a whole life, one where you are not afraid anymore. He cannot understand your reasoning, but he can understand your spirit and your need to protect yourself and your child. He wants to see you happy, friend. And he believes that you and Peter will be happy with him.”
Fumbling with his phone, Tony hit his speed dial, impatiently tapping the composition book as he waited for the line to connect.
He held his free hand out, wiggling his fingers. Steve sighed, but relented, moving to pick up and toss the keys from a small dish on a nearby table. Tony caught them out of the air, humming tunelessly as he moved to exit the cabin. Rounding the corner of the building, he sighed in relief at the sight of the car in front of him.
“He’s jealous of you, darling,” Tony said to Rhodey, keeping his voice down, “He’s… possessive. Especially when he cannot understand us.”
“How is he?” was the first thing out of Bucky’s mouth once both men entered the room, prompting a hush from Rhodey and a smack upside the head, “Ow!”
Tony laughed gently, knocking his forehead against hers. Despite breaking up the year before, he still felt an enormous amount of love for Pepper and was glad for her calming words.
,” Steve rasped, trembling as he reached up to grab Tony’s hands and hold them, “You did, Tony, oh god, you wanted to kill yourself, you wanted to
“She isn’t coming, Tony,” Sarah said, holding Tony’s hand a little tighter, “She’s sending Edwin to pick you up.”
“Okay. We can stay here for a little longer,” Steve acquiesced, “But once Peter is full, we go. Deal?”
“Shoot,” the engineer sighed, “Well, that didn’t work for long. Alright. C’mon you, let’s go for a walk.”
He only realized he was crying when Tony started to wipe the tears off his face. There was more to read, but his hands were shaking enough to make the paper rattle, and Tony took it from him anyway. Horrified, Steve looked over at his husband, twitching with unspoken apologies and worries and concern and oh, god—
He could feel his face heat up into what he assumed was a very prominent blush. Steve raised an eyebrow at him and he started to squirm, not liking the judgment stamped onto the Alpha’s face.
“Yeah, yeah, smartass, just help,” Tony sighed, investigating the screws on the bottom of the tube, “Okay, so it looks like if I just get a large enough wrench, I could—”
He had to bite his lip to keep from laughing at Steve’s wide eyes. Peter must have noticed that he was distracted, as the babe grabbed his shirt and tugged, either for attention or for food.
“Can you believe that? The Prime Alpha, the King of the Warlords, shy about his knot?” He whispered, checking Peter’s undergarments to make sure he was still clean, “I have seen him, and let me say, he has no need for any sort of timidity.”
Steve coughed and waved his hand, trying to clear the cloud as he started to creep closer to the wreckage. He could feel Bucky a few steps behind him, but once he was upon the object, he drew a sharp breath.
“I am glad you think up ways to get us out of bad situations. I just wish you saw how you threw others under the bus to get us
“Hey!” Clint yelled, grinning like an idiot as he continued to shoot despite not even turning his head, “We heard you got into some trouble!”
“Okay, so what were they doing? Making Avengers copies?” He asked, looking at the child, “Don’t tell me we have another Tony Stark on our hands.”
“I know, I’m such an uglier crier,” He sighed, smiling when Tony finally turned to give him a look, “What? I am.”
He put it down and removed the last drawing, pleasantly surprised to see that it was fully colored, shaded and inked. It was him, but in the Iron Man suit, laughing up at Steve, his cowl off and his face sweaty but happy, looking down with love and adoration, his wedding ring standing out on his un-gloved hand that rested on Tony’s waist.
A sharp scream surprised them both as PJ ripped his hand away from Tony’s hold, clutching it to his chest. Tears easily formed in his eyes and he screamed again when Tony tried to reach out for him.
Unbeta'd. Comments, kudos, and art really appreciated. You can ask me questions over at @avengersasssemble on tumblr.com.
“Cute, Tasha,” Bucky said, making himself comfortable on Steve’s lap despite the Captain’s grunt, “You’d look good with kids.”
“Steve? You okay?” He asked slowly, catching movement out of the corner of his eye, “Hey, should I get a nurse? Are you—”
“You sure you are alright?” Steve asked again, which made Tony bristle a bit as he started to pick at his hot oats and berries, “The bond feels...strange.”
“I would have liked to meet her. From what I hear, she was much like my own mother. Strong. Beautiful. A hell of a cook.”
Without waiting for an answer, Tony left, leaving Steve alone in the middle of his room, staring at the wet shoe-marks on his carpet.
Tony let out the breath he hadn’t been aware he was holding, crossing his arms before nodding to let Bruce continue. Once Bruce opened PJ’s right eyelids, they both gasped, staring at the boy before slowly looking up at each other.
“The chair stops part way. It won’t move down anymore,” Tony explained, stuffing down the desire to scoop the boy up and show him the world he missed out on, “See? You’re safe, pumpkin pie. I won’t let you fall.”
The two men continued to talk, but their voices became background noise as Steve stared down at Tony, tracking his eyes twitching under his lids. It was a good sign, a sign that Tony was
He trailed off as an idea came to him, his eyes widening as the plan slowly formed. He beamed and sat up, ignoring that he’d startled Rhodey.
“It does not help him to put clothing on if you are just going to take it back off of him,” Sam groaned, “Can we get on with the meeting?”
“Not tonight, sweetheart,” She answered quietly, “There’s some other…stuff…to be worked out, first. Don’t worry, honey. We’re not going anywhere.”
Tony stared at Steve for a moment before hopping off the counter, nearly jogging down to PJ’s room to get away from the situation. Not that it was necessarily
“Sorry, peaches. Some of us don’t exactly heal as quickly as you do,” he said, sighing softly at the fresh aches that kept up that reminder.
Shame crawled up his neck. Unable to look at Steve any longer, Tony turned his head and looked away, as he knew he was in the wrong. He heard Steve’s quiet sigh and winced, then whimpered when the Alpha let out a small growl.
He was laid on something soft and a coldness came over his forehead and eyes: a cloth? It was soothing for the moment but did nothing to alleviate the curdling fire in his belly. Annoyed, he tried to strip himself in a desperate attempt to get cool. Disembodied hands took over and he laid bare on what he assumed was a bed, panting and shaking as he waited for the chill of the room to soak into his bones.
Steve laughed wetly and sniffled into Tony’s neck, comforted by his husband’s sure and steady arms. He gave himself a few moments to relish in the warmth before pulling away, wiping the rest of the snot and tears off of his face. He smiled at Tony, ignoring his look of disgust when he grabbed his hands again.
“Afraid of a little raccoon?” Natasha scoffed, ducking in front of Tony to trudge forward into the room, “It’s just a—oh, hell. Tony, you’re going to want to see this.”
This… was less than ideal. Really, it was terrible, awful, and all kinds of bad, but Tony wasn’t about to admit that to the team, and
“That’s it, big boy, nice and easy,” Tony crooned, purring once he felt the head of Steve’s cock brush up against his rim.
“Beautiful, love,” he whispered, bending down to kiss the baby’s forehead, “Be good, yeah? We need to take care of your nice things now.”
The next moment he could remember was a horrified gasp and Bruce’s eerily calm voice, then he was dragged off the horse into someone’s arms. Surely Bruce could not carry his weight, but he did not open his eyes to check since the light had become too much to bear. Loud voices threatened to explode his head and he groaned pitifully, wanting all the noise and pain to just
“I do not mean to be,” he apologized, leading them to the bedroom so he could set Peter down in his bassinet, “I have had fear beaten into my bones. I do not trust many regular Alphas as it is, but a Prime? Especially one with such a backstory? Even if I do not feel afraid, I think my subconscious is. I am working on it, though. I have found that not having you here these past weeks was more than stressful.”
“When you go to lunch, yes. You need to pay attention to Health since that’s the one class that involves talking and not much textbook material,” he answered, folding the paper into quarters and tucking it into his breast pocket.
Tony laughed, and Steve felt his worry melt away.  He squeezed Tony’s hand to let him know it was okay.
Peter babbled a response and Tony nodded, then scooted off of the bed so he could pick him up and set him on his hip while Steve stood and opened the bedroom door for them. As they passed, Tony tried to ignore Steve’s smitten look, but it was difficult when he could feel the love burning their bond.
Tony stared as the crowd dispersed, completely bewildered by what had just occurred. He caught Bruce’s eye and quickly waved him over, meeting the doctor halfway.
“You don’t have to be strong anymore,” Steve was whispering to him his voice wavering despite his arms remaining strong around his waist, “I’m here. I’m not gonna let him hurt you anymore. I promise, Tony. I
“I’m awake, you can come in,” Tony called over Rhodey’s response, grinning at the other’s clearly displeased look.
“He looked pretty frazzled and asked if there was anything he could do to help PJ’s transition into Tower life,” She confirmed, “Some boxes had already arrived, so he’s been doing that for the past twenty minutes or so. However long you were in the kitchen with PJ.”
“Uh—I don’t know, gosh. Probably that I’m quieter than him,” the scientist snorted, “I know he doesn’t exactly like silence.”
Natasha looked at the standoff before carefully turning to the last card, nodding at Thor and Bruce so they could skedaddle before the conversation escalated.
“Nothing! I read PJ a book, we napped, Steve came over and we talked, then the little one had a nightmare, we comforted him, and that’s all,” Tony answered, narrowing his eyes.
“You wanna help me decorate?” He asked, looking down at the child, “Like, put stuff up? Wait, hell, you don’t know what any of this is. You were an actual tube baby for, like, a year. Okay, Stark, get it together—”
. Your tummy just didn’t like what you ate. We’ll get something nice and warm for you for dinner and you’ll feel a lot better, alright?” he soothed, re-tucking the blankets around PJ and his elephant, “Don’t worry, darling. You tired? Want to sleep a little?”
“Oh?” Rhodey asked, passing Bucky a drink before getting one for himself, “Granted, I’ve only been here since Tony started college, and he never really talks about his childhood.”
“We don’t fucking know that,” He answered bitterly, taking his hand away from his face to show her how red his eyes were from the tears that refused to fall, “I let—I got us captured, I don’t know what they did to him—”
Standing, Tony grunted at how his back cracked, rolling his eyes at Steve’s familiar laughter in the next room. He followed PJ out to the bedroom, smirking at Steve’s sharp breath.
Usually, he tried to escape medical at all costs, but drainage was never fun, and he was still recuperating from his other injuries, so staying in place was a-okay. That, and it meant Steve would have to seek
“Mm. Darling, we should have breakfast ourselves before we get in on the fun. Can you go make us plates?” Tony asked when he pulled away, “And cut up the fruit into small pieces. You-know-who will most likely try to steal them from us and I do not want him to choke on anything.”
Steve did not look very convinced. Determined to prove him wrong, Tony stood and transferred Peter to Steve’s arms, ignoring the man’s protests.
She sighed with a smile and moved forward to pick up PJ, cocking a hip so the boy could rest on it. He quickly snuggled up to her, putting his thumb in his mouth before ducking his face into her neck.
“Be careful,” the second added, pressing his forehead into the huddle, “Stick to the shadows. I’ll send for you as soon as I can.”
“Sir, Doctor Banner, Miss Romanov requests both of your presences in the main common lounge,” JARVIS interrupted.
“Try not to worry, Anthony,” Natasha said, squeezing his arm, “Maybe you could reach out through the bond? Give yourself something to focus on.”
“I’m not getting PJ’s blood drawn by myself,” he corrected, pulling over a table on wheels to begin setting up for the phlebotomy, “Take that ratty thing off him and keep it on the table so he doesn’t have to rest against the cold metal. I’d also recommend you send for clothes for him once we do his measurements. For now, he should be able to wear spare t-shirts and the like. JARVIS, could you ask Natasha if she has any spare shirts?”
so you two can play Kings and Queens,” Natasha interrupted firmly, “Tony and his James can come separately with Peter once we have secured--”
that he was hiding and using crafting weaponry as an excuse for his absence. No, he was only pulling his weight in the kingdom, and if that meant he missed a dinner here or there, then so be it. Steve was capable enough of taking care of Peter for a night.
Snack passed, and so did Science and Social Studies, the latter making Tony nearly fall asleep against Steve’s arm. Miss Hill then called for recess and lunch, instructing the class to grab their lunchboxes; it was warm enough that they could eat outside today. The kids cheered and rushed to grab their lunchboxes, except for Tony. He waited for the masses to clear before grabbing his own, still uncomfortable with the prospect of unruly crowds. With his robot lunchbox clutched to his chest, he made his way outside, seeing his classmates spread out on the picnic tables and grass, all eating and talking animatedly. He swallowed nervously and headed over to a shady tree, slumping down against the bark of the strong oak before pulling out a ham sandwich.
Tony blinked, hand in the air as he stared at the one drop rolling down Steve’s chest, quickly drying from the fire against his abs. He slowly reached out to touch it, watching Steve’s muscles jerk under his touch.
“You already have a baby to look after--that is, unless you are telling me you do not want Peter since he is not yours?” Tony said icily.
Steve nodded and sat back in his seat, coughing once more for good measure. He sniffled and grunted, rolling his eyes when Tony giggled next to him.
“If its any help, his vomit was disgustingly orange. I’d say its something with the sweet potatoes,” Tony said.
“Hey, honey bear, good of you to drop in,” he slurred, reaching over to put a hand on Rhodey’s knee, “How’d ya get here?”
“The Lieutenant says he is aware of the fault. We are a small, but mighty, group. There are only so many of us to give to the cause,” Thor explained, “We do not have the men for defense. He wants to know your solution.”
A soft moan slipped out, startling Tony and jolting his foot in Steve’s hands. Steve did not let go, instead applying more pressure and moving down the arch to his heel, tugging on Tony a bit to pull his foot into his lap. Looking down at Steve in disbelief, the Alpha merely batted his eyes back, features innocent.
“Guys, can you give us a moment? Nat, you and Bruce stay close,” Tony asked, not looking away from the boy.
“Ah ah, back down, Alpha,” he teased, scraping nails over Steve’s shoulders and down to his pecs, “I am supposed to be
, titled it. Tony choked back his tears as he shakily peeled the photograph up from the paper, remembering the day like it was yesterday, back when things were easy and free, and Steve liked it when he gave him dandelions.
Oddly silent, Steve merely stared at Tony and PJ, his fist curled under his chin. After a beat, he rose from his chair, taking the few short strides across the room to stand next to them. Feeling Steve’s hot gaze just above him, Tony nearly bolted, ignoring every fiber in his body as he forced himself to look up at the Captain.
He smiled gently as the child nodded and scooted over, allowing him to slip under the covers. Once PJ nearly attached himself to Tony’s side, he wrapped his arms around the boy, rubbing circles on his back to try and help him go back to sleep. After a minute, PJ pulled back, shaking his head with a soft whine.
Once PJ was settled, Tony made sure the cloth was soaked before carefully scrubbing the boy’s curls by wrapping them up in the cloth and twisting it back and forth. After a few goes, PJ’s hair was decently cleaned, but it still left the trickiest part.
PJ seemed to consider this, then nodded, tossing his book in favor of picking up the next. He handed it to Tony, snuggling back down into him and repositioning his elephant to look at the book.
“I’d say,” Steve said quietly, propping his arms up on the side of the bed, “He needs a proper bath. But sleep is more important than that right now.”
Steve only hummed and sunk into the water, hissing at the heat on his bruises. Tony shook his head and sighed, sitting down on the outside of the tub so he could idly start washing him down.
Clint merely turning to grin and send finger-guns at Steve as he stood from his desk and moved, under-handedly fist-bumping Bucky and Sam on his way out of the door behind Fury. As soon as they left, Mr. Coulson took up his reign at the front of the room, launching into the assignments due that week. Tony sighed and scribbled down the work before turning his attention to Steve; it's not that he was a large worrywart, but when it came to Steve being stubborn, he tended to let his mind fret. It had been enough of an ordeal to convince him to take his inhaler when he was running laps for soccer, so a back brace was out of the question.
“Alright, you’re doing really well, kiddo, okay? Almost halfway done,” Tony encouraged, handing the shirt up to Natasha, “Now I have to pick you up. It’ll take two seconds. If you get uncomfortable, don’t worry. It’ll be over really soon.”
He gently eased the baby’s fist out of his mouth and tucked it into the wrap, as he could see that Peter was beginning to droop and fall back asleep. Pleased, Tony kissed Peter’s head again and hugged the boy tightly, if only to give himself some comfort. It did not last very long, though, for the pathetic whimpers and small growls started up again behind him.
“There is cake and other goodies in the kitchen. Tony, why don’t you show them where it is?” Mother said overtop of the arguing, taking her knitting back up, “Your Father should be home soon. If he’s in a good mood, he might let you all look into the lab.”
“Really, Tones. Everything is okay,” he said gently, “Take him and Peter and play Mama Bear for a while. Thor and the others are plenty of company while you keep house for once.”
He was barely understandable through his sobs at that point, but Steve’s arms drew him in and held him close to Steve’s chest, as warm and as solid as he had always been. He let himself cry, soaking up Steve’s comforting whispers and the gentle scratches on his scalp until he suddenly remembered their newest plans for the day.
Steve sighed and got up, moving over to the bed. He looked down at the two of them and shook his head, giving them both a fond smile.
He cut the connection and sat up, hanging the headset back up and propping his feet on the dash before leaning back in his chair with his arms behind his head. Listening to the calm chatter and laughter behind him, Steve closed his eyes, a warm smile coming to his lips as he let sleep take him for the rest of the ride home.
Washcloth in hand, Steve held it up to the showerhead and got it wet, lathering it up with soap before carefully approaching Tony. Tony’s fearful eyes flickered between him and the cloth, but Steve knew better than to start with his face; he knelt down on the tile and picked up a foot, starting to scrub him down from the bottom up. It was a slow, tedious process, but he knew better than most what trauma could do to a man, and besides, it was
“It’s not just broken. I think the muscle is torn as well,” she sighed, ignoring his complaint, “There’s not much to do but ice it. I’ll have the guards regularly bring you ice packs.”
“Barnes said he would have liked to keep you,” Thor explained, rolling his eyes at the antics, “He is lying, of course, he is
“Yes, we are all well. Merely talking to him--talking to babies is important for their development,” he explained, stuffing down his nerves into a bottle, “He is always calmer when he hears my voice.”
Peter blinked up at him and began to gum his fingers, so Tony hushed him and gently pulled the digits away, only to have the baby screw up his face and cry. No doubt the hunger he felt exasperated his fussiness, and his cry soon turned into a full-blown wail with large tears rolling down his cheeks to soak the top of his dress. Tony tried to console him, bounce him, cuddle him, whatever he could think of, but to no avail—thankfully, Steve soon returned with a wineskin in his hand, looking concerned. He handed over the wineskin to Tony once he had rejoined them, watching as Tony took a sip of the milk first to make sure it was safe. Satisfied, Tony tipped the wineskin down and shushed Peter, sighing in relief when the babe began to drink and settle.
“Shh, don’t cry,” Tony tried to soothe, shuffling forward, “Let me help, okay? I have to touch, though. You’re too small to get up there right now and we don’t have any step stools or anything. Is it okay if I touch?”
Shame washed over him and he turned around, intent on scurrying out of the room to hide somewhere else. He was used to causing Alphas to snap, but feeling such anger and despair from a fellow Omega broke his heart in a way that it never had before. If he had felt it, he was sure that Peter had also felt it and was screaming because of it. He got one foot out of the door when an arm came around his shoulders and turned him back in, carefully pulling him into a familiar chest.
Having sat and gathered PJ into his lap while Bruce talked, Tony nodded, cradling the boy to his chest, like he had done in the compound. Looking down at the boy, he gently tucked his loose curls behind his ears.
“Take it easy, pumpkin. You can always have more, I promise,” Tony soothed fondly, poking in another spoonful of rice, “You’ll always have food, okay? You don’t have to be like your Papa and squirrel away extras when you think no one is looking.”
“Are you sure? I don’t—I can’t wake up again and have you not be here,” Tony confessed, fisting his hands into Steve’s tactical suit.
Tony laughed and sighed warmly, turning to kiss the top of Peter’s head and rub the baby’s back. He whimpered and clutched at Tony’s shirt, tucking his head into his father’s neck.
As they approached the market, various noises filled his ears: children laughing and playing, people talking, music, and occasional shouts of glee. It was another world all on its own, and as Steve guided him deeper, Tony had to stop, slowly turning in a circle to take everything in. Stalls selling various wares were packed in together, trying to fit in as many as possible in the given space. Cones of spices and kabobs of various meat and produce made the market smell like a warm curry, homely and inviting.
“He did not use to be like that,” he said quietly, hammering the steel down, “He changed after I was born. He wanted an heir, yes, but not an Omega. To him, I was less-than, unworthy of being his successor. No matter who I bonded with, I was not going to continue the Stark line. I was going to be bonded to an Alpha, and then they would continue to rule in my stead. It broke him to know that our generational reign would end.”
“They wish to hear what you have to say,” Thor said to him, turning around and putting a hand on his shoulder, “Speak freely. I will translate as you talk.”
, and he would do everything in his power to keep the boy safe. That meant he had to keep Peter away from his father, in a place where he would not dare to go. The babe yawned and startled Tony out of his thoughts; he smiled and curled the babe up against his chest, content to rock him back and forth as they waited out the storm. Once the rain outside dwindled to a soft patter, he swaddled Peter back up and kissed the tip of his nose.
“We can only have one dramatic one in the kingdom,” Clint said, patting Steve’s shoulder, “Do not tell him I said that.”
Grinning at Steve’s frown, Tony settled down in his bed, holding PJ close until Steve could crawl in and settle. Carefully, he moved the boy to be cradled between them, smiling once PJ’s sniffles started to subside.
Tony was nearly inconsolable as he frantically yelled, his arms held back by Steve to keep from shaking the boy any more. He watched as PJ’s eyes finally snapped open, consciousness and fear evident on his small face. His tiny body was shivering, despite the mountains of blankets covering him. Turning his head, PJ made eye contact with Tony, only to burst into howling tears, scrambling back until he hit the wall.
Rhodey sat back in his chair, and after a second, began to giggle. He bowed his head forward to try and suppress it, but eventually, he gave way to the laughter, his legs kicking as he wiped away the tears that formed in his eyes. Bucky and Steve stared at each other, having a silent conversation about the mental stability of their friend.
He groaned and shifted himself out of the bed, steadying himself on various pieces of furniture as he hobbled back to the bathroom. Thankfully, it was easy to clean himself up and drain the tub, but by the time he got a warm, wet rag to clean Steve off with his legs were starting to give out. It was only by sheer willpower alone that he managed to get back to the bed to wipe down Steve’s face and chest before carefully cleaning his groin, his face falling when the Alpha whimpered in his sleep.
“I’m not done with you all yet, so no, I’m here as War Machine until further notice,” Rhodey replied, clapping a hand on Steve’s shoulder to keep the Captain seated as the others moved to leave, “I figured you’d want some help, and you never
bad. Really, he knew he was just going to miss having him by his side on the field to pass fancy footwork back and forth.
Finally, Steve turned to look at him, and Tony inwardly cursed as he saw the shift in Steve’s emotions from his Captain’s determination to pure Steve concern.
“Can’t sleep either?” Steve said sleepily, looking up at Tony and showing off the dark bags that had somehow appeared under his eyes.
He opened the door and turned the light on, watching PJ slowly survey the room. He nervously took a step back, shaking his head. Tony sighed softly, a pang of sympathy echoing through his chest as he knelt down to the boy’s level.
“It’s very possible, and despite HYDRA’s evil intentions, they do have good resources to accomplish the impossible. I’m afraid it’s accurate, Tony,” Natasha answered, looking at the young boy in the tube, “He’s a genetically modified child, built from splicing your DNA with Rogers’.”
“Bruce sent me down with stuff,” Steve replied, barely motioning to a bag that rested by the far wall, “He told me to, quote, work out whatever the hell is going on, end-quote.”
“If I have to watch you two start scenting each other in this hallway, I am going to throw up,” Natasha commented flatly.
Tony looked down at Peter and frowned, bouncing the tot on his knee as he thought. Consequently, he missed the knowing looks the others were sharing. Bucky stood and clapped a hand on his back, then began to corral the others away.
Tony blinked at that, staring down at his costume. It was just a wooly shirt and matching pants, with wool armbands and ears glued to a headband perched on his fluffy hair. He blushed as he met Steve’s smile, shrugging slightly.
“Don’t you fucking dare stop,” Tony said shakily, rolling his hips as a test, “I-I think you can go, I think--”
Tony gathered up his lunchbox and hightailed it from the bathroom, missing the look of concern and shame on Natasha’s face. Instead, he dropped off his lunchbox at his locker and grabbed his soccer things, racing to the boys’ locker room to change into his gear and head out to the field. Some of the others were already out and kicking the ball around; from where he stood, Tony could see Steve’s slumped figure sitting on the sidelines. It broke his heart that Steve was being made to sit out, but he knew Steve needed to be coddled and babied a bit more than he usually allowed, so he didn’t feel
Steve lifted his head again, watching as PJ shifted closer. Awkwardly, the child stood and toddled over completely, wrapping his arms around Steve’s neck.
As the chair began to tilt backward, PJ looked around frantically, scared by the sudden movement. He whimpered lightly, starting to shake as fear gathered in his wide eyes.
“See if there’s an aerated cast in the kit,” he called, forcing his eyes open to prevent himself from falling asleep, “That’ll hold it until we can get to medical.”
Before he could finish the suggestion, Steve had unbuckled him and tugged him into his arms, holding Tony up by his thighs as he stumbled them both into the elevator. They both had a thought about the potential repercussions about getting down and dirty right away, but addiction has a habit of pushing away rational thought, which meant that Tony was too busy sucking on Steve’s tongue for him to hold back. The elevator took too damn long to get up to the penthouse, but eventually the doors opened, and they managed to force themselves out, both already untucked from their pants to provide a little relief.
“Work in my laboratory. Keep house with the others. If you would like, I can show you the rest of the castle. I heard through the vine that you might like to see our forge and armory--and, if you are interested, I thought we could start language lessons?” Bruce said, “Perhaps some basics to practice so you and the Prime can communicate outside of gesturing.”
Hearing it out loud, it sounded wrong, but Steve rolled onto his side anyway, pulling down a pillow to prop under his head. He sighed softly and figured he could use advice, but the one person he wanted to talk to was the one person he wanted to talk
“Right. Of course. Okay. You need to take the kid—J, call Bruce and have him meet us in the kid’s bedroom,” he said, pouting at Steve as he continued to giggle, “Asshole, take the
“Sorry if I upset ya, Tony. Miss Hill might get mad, but I don’ care,” Steve whispered, hugging Tony tight.
“Exactly. He’s a toddler. He really shouldn’t have been able to do that, let alone toss the guy into the back to knock him out.”
Feeling Steve bristle at the name usage, Tony swallowed his momentary guilt, more focused on pocketing his phone and shushing PJ before the boy could whine. Realizing the device wasn’t coming back, the boy opened his mouth as if to cry, but quickly snapped it shut, looking up at Steve with wary eyes.
“Natasha knows,” Tony continued, following Bruce over to one of the examination tables, “She’s given me a month to figure something out before she tells him. I hope you’ll grant me the same.”
Steve nodded, a fond smile on his face as he watched PJ curl up to Tony’s chest, reaching up with one hand to pat at the silhouette of the arc reactor shining through his shirt.
Slowly, Tony put his arm around the tot, letting out a relieved breath when he didn’t fuss. With one hand, he managed to open the book, displaying it so PJ could see the pictures, despite laying sideways. He opened his mouth to start reading when he heard a small giggle, causing him to swivel his head. Seeing Clint have a hand clapped over his mouth, Tony flushed, having temporarily forgotten the others were still in the room.
Nearly two years had passed since he’d fallen off the roof of the auditorium and he’d only recently gotten his full motor function back. The physical therapy was paying off, considering his hands no longer shook when they were by his sides, but simple actions still gave him a little trouble. This time, he’d triumphed, which caused a warm knot to form in his belly when his boyfriend came down the stairs to see his handiwork.
“Sorry, sorry,” Tony apologized, wincing as poured alcohol over the gash, “Have to clean it properly. Infection can kill you, you know.”
“He thought you were responsible for my nipples being so red and raw,” Tony said, managing a smile when Steve’s face turned red, “I told him the truth.”
“I’ve saved this since you arrived, Sir,” he explained, offering a gentle smile to him, “I was saving it to give to you upon your graduation, but I think it may serve you better now than then. Perhaps it can give you the answers you are looking for.”
“Oh, sweetheart, it is alright,” Tony soothed, patting his backside, “After our tour, we can have something to eat and a small nap, yeah? I bet the early morning has you about ready for sleep.”
Watching Steve interact with PJ, Tony felt a warmth blossom through his chest, reaching so that the tips of his fingers tingled with electricity. The fire behind the ice blue stare caught him off guard enough that it took a few snaps for Tony to realize that Steve was attempting to get his attention.
“Bucky is another friend who lives with us,” Tony explained, watching PJ be entranced by Natasha, “He has a metal arm that I built. He’s alright. He’s one of Natasha’s significant others. I can explain what that is later: you don’t have to get that now.”
“He wishes to know if you are afraid of him, Tony,” Thor translated quietly, “We can smell your fear, friend.”
“Daddy’s sorry, Petey. He never meant to hurt you or make you feel scared or alone,” Tony murmured, “I will always be there to hold you and comfort you. I promise. You are my first priority, little one.”
Steve stood up and crossed behind Thor so he could stand in front of Tony, only to drop to his knees with a sharp
Standing, Tony re-entered his suit, flipping down the faceplate to hide his expression. Carefully, he took the boy from Natasha and cradled him in the suit’s arms, trying not to seem awkward.
“A few more hours and then we can stop. The deeper we are in the forest, the easier it is for us to stay hidden,” Clint said.
He shook PJ’s shoulder lightly, but at the motion, he jerked away from Tony’s hold, thrashing in his sleep as the nightmare held onto him. Just as suddenly, he sat straight up and screamed; Tony had to throw an arm over Steve’s chest to keep the blond from surging forward. In front of them, PJ panted for a moment before bursting into tears, wailing as he drew his knees up to his chest and wrapped his arms around himself.
“Oh, no. Don’t pull the Rhodey card,” Tony interrupted, moving to get out of the bed as well, “I think the child’s safety is a little bit more important than mine right now.”
The Captain blushed slightly, shrugging at the nickname. He merely hummed in response, continuing to trace lines and shapes over Tony’s back as they watched PJ start to slow down and settle in Tony’s arms. It didn’t take long for the child to nearly drift off, at which Tony stood, pressing a kiss to the boy’s head and setting him on his feet.
“Still! I can’t believe he’s shacking up with Stark and telling him shit and doesn’t even have the balls to admit it!” Bucky shouted, turning to face Natasha.
Tony punctuated his words by bringing down the hammer, then shoved the half-flattened steel back into the coals to heat up again. He only realized his scent had grown sour when Peter began to wail loudly, taking both men by surprise. Tony swore and dumped the hot steel into a bucket of water so he could run back over to the baby, scooping him up into his arms to comfort him.
“We’ll see you Monday, Tony,” he said softly, “If you need anything, just call, okay? Mom can come get you—"
“You never do,” Pepper answered with a smile, running her manicured hand through his hair, “Bye, Tony. Please get that paperwork done.”
He took his seat on the throne and Tony followed, plopping himself down sideways onto Steve’s lap and draping his legs over the arm of the chair. Gently, he laid Peter down on his thighs, smiling when the baby cooed and reached up for the strings hanging off of the collar of Steve’s shirt.
If there was an emotion beyond shameful embarrassment, Tony was feeling it down to his toes. He ever so carefully lifted his hips so Steve could pull off his pants and underwear, then slowly opened his legs up.
“Go on,” Tony said to PJ, nudging him as he looked at Steve’s outstretched arms, “He won’t hurt you. I’ll come see you once I’m done here, okay?”
Unbeta'd. Comments and encouragements are appreciated. I follow the tag #avengersasssemble on tumblr.com.
Wanting to snap back, Tony sucked back his words as pain nearly made his knees buckle when two of the guards yanked him up out of his seat. He managed to get his feet under him as they walked the same path back toward their cell, with PJ still tucked into his shoulder. He followed the guards into the medical wing, extremely reluctant to let any of the staff come near him. Eventually, he was corralled back toward what looked like a decontamination shower with six guards standing watch.
“He has endured hundreds of microfractures,” a different doctor began, pointing out small smudges on the scan, “We believe that these were able to heal somewhat properly due to the serum in his system. The larger breaks, though—”
Glad for the distraction, Tony walked out, trying to calm the thousands of thoughts knocking in his brain.
Tony nodded back, looking down at the packet in his hands; he already knew the content inside and out, too damaging to even attempt to scrub from his psyche. Looking back up to Clint, he saw the usually steady archer’s hands shake, and he knew it was enough.
“Bruce will most likely bring Peter around at first light for breakfast. Now, I am no prude, but I would rather not scar him with our nudity.”
He stepped out to find Steve standing over Peter, a smitten look on his face as he let the baby play with one of his fingers. Tony smiled and sidled up to him, giggling softly when Steve jumped.
“Right. We need to be diligent. I’m going to upload FRIDAY and JOCASTA into the mainframe to add another two layers of security, just in case,” Tony said, nodding, “I’ll have Pepper run more thorough background checks and have my current employees go through re-checks.”
“He goes by Rhodey. He is one of my closest friends in the whole world. He helped me escape,” Tony explained, elbowing Rhodey when he started to make comments under his breath, “The problem is, he is
“Rhodey could also take care of him, but necessary time could be wasted in attempted translation. Since you can speak both languages, if something goes wrong, you will be able to keep everyone in the loop,” he explained, “Plus, I have seen you with Peter already. He is comfortable in your arms.”
wearing it. Now, unless you want to have a meaningless fight over this, leave it on the bed,” Tony growled, inwardly hoping that Peter would not wake, “Otherwise, you can stay here and pout like a child while I go see Rhodey with Peter.”
need to bathe,” he murmured, gently patting Peter’s back as he stood to pad over to the big bed, “How does that sound, hm? A long, hot bath should be good for both of us. Then we can put on new clothes and have a little nap.”
Now came the dilemma: in order to dry himself, he needed to put Peter down, but there was no place in the bathroom where he would be safe while Tony dried and dressed. He could move to the bedroom, but that meant moving past Steve, and he was still unsure as to his boundaries in the unfamiliar environment. Steve noticed his hesitation and tilted his head, looking between Tony and Peter.
“I did, but don’t count on it. You need to eat basic staples until your stomach can adjust. You know this.”
“You want me to come up? Buddy, I don’t think I can fit up there,” Steve said gently, making a face at Tony’s smirk, “Tony, no. Get your mind out of the gutter.”
PJ nodded, happily taking the sippy cup from Steve. He put it up to his lips and took a long swig as the trio made their way back to the bedroom, now vacant of any Avengers. Wriggling in Tony’s arms, PJ bounced down onto his bed, only to stare at the new decorations covering his room: twinkling lights hung on the ceiling with a large net full of stuffed animals, various Avengers posters littered the walls, and even a framed photo of Steve and Tony from the Holiday party of the year after the Battle of New York rested on the nightstand. Taking note of the boy’s staring, Tony sat down next to him on the bed, slowly waving a hand in front of his face to get his attention without frightening him.
“Just making sure you are not bleeding or tearing,” Steve soothed, “Are you okay? Comfortable? Do you want me t--”
!” Bucky shouted, keeping them from arguing, “Not why I brought you two in here. Tony, tell them what you told me right before I left.”
“You should have told me that I hurt you,” Steve said quietly from behind him, “You should have woken me up and let me take care of you.”
Nobody moved. Tony could feel the tension rising in the room, and even Clint was shooting him worried looks. It did not bother him though, for he knew if Steve was to try and argue with him now, the others would chastise him for getting so riled up right after his feral episode.
The sigh Tony made was probably heard halfway around the world. He put in the effort to try to get them to reconcile, so no one can say that he did otherwise. Still, he could try one more tactic.
“He does not appreciate that we are talking in front of him without my translations,” Thor explained, grinning while Steve pouted.
“M’comin’,” he tried to say, but his throat was swollen and rough, causing him to cough as he stumbled over to the crib.
“Hey. You with me?” Tony asked quietly, crouching down, “Steve? Can you pick your head up for me, baby doll?”
“You also don’t have to worry about poisonings if his meals are coming from your body,” Bruce continued, raising an eyebrow at Tony’s stare, “The Prime asked us why you would drink your son’s meal before him. Thor and I explained that you were most likely making sure we had not put anything else in the wineskin, yes?”
So, when pterodactyls attacked the quinjet and downed them in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by dinosaurs and other hazards, the thought occurred to Tony that he’d never packed food and water, considering it was supposed to be a one-day outing.
“She is perfect, is she not, my love?” Tony whispered, giggling to himself when the baby tried to gum on the doll.
Tony rolled his eyes and tucked himself up into Steve’s chest, not-so-subtly grinding their hips together as he settled. He smirked at Steve’s whimper and gently pulled him down into a kiss as he slipped his arms over Steve’s shoulders.
“What?” He said, spreading his hands out, “It’s close to Pietro, but isn’t Pietro, and it’s a classic name. Nothing too…outlandish, like some celebrity baby names. It’s a good, strong name. Maybe you’d want Pietro, though. It’s Italian. Peter is Greek. They mean the same thing, though. To be strong, or to be a rock.”
Steve, who had somehow managed to stay completely still and mute, finally moved, getting down on the floor to sit on his legs.
“Oh, no, honey, you drink that,” Tony laughed softly, unable to help his fond smile, “They’ll bring me stuff later. You need to eat, too. I’m hoping Papa didn’t bring you just juice.”
He closed his eyes as he was fretted over, still hearing PJ’s screaming from somewhere down the hall. The sound made his gut curl in on itself, ramping up to the point of nausea. Feeling sick, Tony had to force his eyes open, realizing that the nausea was probably due to the foul antiseptic smell that permeated the room.
Looking between the two of them in confusion, PJ put a hand on his own face, already starting to sniffle. He burst into tears before Tony could explain, collapsing on the floor with his hands over his face.
Tony laughed and leaned in to kiss him. The Prime eagerly returned his affection, content to lazily swap kisses as they dried in the sun. They laid together for the better part of the afternoon, and they only bothered to move once the chill of the quickly setting sun began to set into their bones. It took a great deal of effort to re-dress, but soon they were on their way back to town with only one noticeable limp between them. Once they reached the market people began to stare, some with knowing looks and some with interest. Tony ignored them for the most part and finally got Steve back into the castle, giggling at his mate’s quiet groans.
“—I thought that maybe we could have this. Y’know. A kid. A family. White picket fence, apple-pie lifestyle. I’d go on to be, I don’t know, a police officer or a firefighter, she’d be a secretary, and then a homemaker when we had our own pack. But, of course, that wasn’t in the cards. Never was. I see that now. Perhaps it was better that way. Her husband was an excellent man, and with him, she never lost her spark. Went on to be a great woman, friend, founder—”
“I need to ask Bruce what he puts in that awful concoction,” he grumbled to Pete, smiling at the baby’s soft coos, “I do not think you would find it very pleasant, sweet thing. Let’s go bathe, yeah? Wash off the day’s sick and perhaps we can go find something to fill our bellies.”
“Tell me if it hurts, okay? I am not here to hurt you,” Steve murmured, leaning up for one more kiss.
It was quiet in the room for a second, causing Tony to look up. Seeing the other three staring at him, he shrugged, putting his cards down.
“The scan room is ready,” one of them announced, “We’re going to take him down. You’re welcome to come with us.”
“I never was good with kids. Even during touring with the USO,” He replied, a distant look glazing over his eyes, “Holding babies got awkward and tiring. They screamed a lot, and with the enhanced hearing and all…”
Looking up, a beaming grin broke out over Tony’s face at seeing Bruce walk in, a lab coat fitted snugly over his shoulders.
“The Prime… can be strange about these things,” Bruce said, “Deaths weigh heavy on him. He feels responsible for the safety of the entire army, even though it is impossible for him to protect everyone at once. I have also never seen them come back this beaten up. Something must have gone wrong. Come, let us go meet them.”
“Looks like we have to wait, love,” Tony murmured to Peter, gently swaying in place to try and keep the baby entertained, “Maybe he’ll bring you back your own furs, hm? Something nice and warm?”
“James, you need to take Peter. Let me run ahead with him--he needs medical attention and we cannot afford to keep going like this,” Bruce said, stopping his horse.
Tony smiled down at the baby and gently stroked his fine hair, letting Peter have his fill before helping him unlatch and moving him to his shoulder to pat his back.
Before Peter could screech--or get out of the tub-- Tony cupped water up and washed down his hair, tilting him back so the water would not fall down his face. As soon as he finished, Peter made a disgruntled noise and attempted to escape, only to be grabbed around the waist and plunked back down into the water.
“What, are you ashamed? Will you turn red like the clay if you knew someone saw me take you here, under the hot sun?”
“Y-yes, Omega, I mean--I will not doubt you, not ever,” Steve said quickly, losing all concentration as blood was dragged from his brain and down into his gut.
He looked at Bucky for confirmation, but the man had already fallen asleep, mouth open against his window. Shaking his head fondly, Rhodey stretched himself out and settled down, easily falling asleep as they moved on toward New York.
Steve nodded, sleepily nuzzling Tony’s neck as they stumbled back to camp, chilled to the bone. Tony had to peel him off a few times so he could put on new logs, but eventually he settled on having a super soldier leech until the fire was roaring enough to start to dry them both.
“No, I’ve seen your off days. That’s eating eight peanut butter and honey sandwiches at lunch. You only eat ice cream by yourself to either celebrate a day off or to mope,” Tony snorted back, “And considering we don’t really have days off anymore…”
Forcing himself forward, Tony exited the room and closed the door behind him, choosing that moment to realize how hard his heart was thumping in his chest. Sensing the panic that was rising in his chest, he scanned the area before ducking into the room over, quietly closing and locking the door so he was alone. Knowing that SHIELD liked to soundproof things, Tony opened up a call, sitting down heavily on the empty bed.
He ignored Steve’s half-hearted attempt to give Peter back and stepped aside, only leaning in to make minor adjustments to his hold when he needed it. Thankfully, Steve seemed to adapt to holding the baby and slowly relaxed, even going so far as to hold him one-handed so he could pet the baby’s hair.
“Okay Mr. Stark, you can roll back over,” one of the nurses said, helping Tony to get adjusted, “Now, could you lean forward?”
Embarrassed, Tony clapped a hand over his bruised bondmark and winced, inwardly hating that his body betrayed his emotions.
“Alright, one sandwich coming up,” Steve said, breaking his train of thought as he placed the plate in front of Tony, “And you, young man, need to be cleaned up, and probably put down for a nap.”
He watched Steve’s eyes dilate as the Alpha distractedly hummed in agreement. Slowly, he took his hand away from Steve’s cock and slipped it lower, gently running his fingers down his balls and over his hole. Steve gasped and leaned onto Tony for support, giving him as much room as he could by widening his stance.
Brightening up, the boy pushed himself up to his feet, his sniffling gone as he ran over to Nat. Watching him look up at her with a shy smile, Tony felt his heart lighten, a twinge of pride striking him.
He picked PJ up and held him up to the sink, walking the boy through washing and drying his hands before setting him on his feet again.
“With the amount of money that goes through SHIELD, you’d think I wouldn’t have to keep paying for cleanup damages.”
Steve nodded and patted his chest again, finally noticing that he had ruined his paint. He grunted and stood, waving at Tony to move back. He slowly inched back in the tub, only to suck in a breath when Steve stripped off his boots and skirt and climbed in. Tony pointedly looked away and handed the soap over when it was requested, busying himself with balancing Peter on his chest so he could have both hands free to wash himself down. All he wanted to do was get out of the water and get changed into a more protective barrier of clothing, but once he stood to get out, Steve waved at him and held both hands out, then stood up himself. Tony tucked Peter’s head into his chest and dared to take a quick glance. He could not deny the rush of arousal he felt when looking at Steve; without the warpaint to distract his eyes, the curves and sharp lines of his body stood out on pale skin, giving way to the rippling muscle underneath. His eyes began to drift lower before he caught himself and looked away. The man was, supposedly, going to become his Alpha, so he was curious as to what he was going to have to…
Tony bit the inside of his cheek and winced, not wanting to leave the baby after the whole ordeal. However, if having him nearby would help Steve recover…
“That’s because it’s a given,” Natasha said smoothly, “We figured we didn’t need to announce ourselves to the world.”
. However, with an exasperated grunt from Steve, his backpack was tugged off, causing Tony to gasp and grab for it.
Steve helped Tony up and over to his chair before shaking the other two men awake and sitting in his own seat. He fastened Tony’s seatbelt before doing his own, gently patting his husband’s sprained arm.
Tony moved his head to look at the ceiling, but before he could focus on something to distract him, gentle fingers rubbed over his hole and he gasped, unable to tell what was worse: the pain or the mortification.
, Natasha. Just--just for a minute or two. I need to make sure I did not break him any more than he already was when he got here. I could not live with myself if I hurt him.”
Tony grinned when Steve laughed and smacked his knee, leaning up to kiss him again. He put a hand on Steve’s chest, only to pull back when he hissed.
“Leave him alone. I was about to suggest we go look for Steve,” She said, looking at Tony, “Give him a little time. If he’s doing what he said he was, then it may take him a while. If he's not back by nightfall, we can make some torches and go out.”
“That’s it, you’re okay, I got you. Maybe St—maybe Papa will even come with us and help keep you toasty warm, okay?” Tony soothed, making a face at Steve’s hesitant look, “You’re okay, honey. I got you.”
PJ huffed and shook his head, making his hair fall into his face. He pushed it back with a grunt, tugging on Tony’s pants again. Feeling his heart pull a little, Tony slowly reached down to card his fingers through the boy’s hair, shaking his head.
“—who told me that a devil in hell had accidentally sent me upstairs and that he had a particularly nice torturer for me.”
. His voice was gravelly and low as if he were ill with the winter’s warmth. It was no doubt from growling all damn morning, and if it were not so terrifying, Tony might have laughed. Instead, he laid perfectly still and breathed evenly, hoping that the other Warlords could convince Steve to walk away.
The growl that erupted from Steve’s throat sent tingles down Tony’s spine. He shifted on the bed to bring his legs together, forcing himself to remain calm.
“American civilian was captured by Afghani terrorists, not far from our location. They wouldn’t tell us who, but its someone with enough money to send us in,” Bucky sighed, “They said it looked like an easy in-and-out, and it’d be good press for the Army.”
“And Mom and Dad as the last pair. Fitting,” Natasha said, putting the hat at her feet, “Now, everyone decide who is going first and who is second. Those going second will leave the room.”
“Let me go find Thor and Bruce to help with translation, and we can move upstairs for food and talk,” Natasha said, “I think the boys will enjoy having a new person around to annoy.”
“I am well, Thor. Perhaps I ate too much too fast,” Tony lied, hiding his gaze from Steve, “Is—Is there a bed and a crib where Peter and I could lie down?”
“Do you not want to share your heat with me?” Steve asked, making no attempt to hide the devastation in his voice.
let you fuck me again,” Tony managed to threaten, grabbing his cock by the base to stave off his release, “And I mean
Steve shook his head and rubbed his eyes, groaning softly. Trying to interpret twelve-year-old Tony’s phonetic German accent was starting to make his eyes and brain hurt, but that seemed to be the least of his problems. Sure, Tony tended to be a little self-destructive, but writing himself getting pummeled by Skull? He knew what that felt like firsthand, and the thought of Tony having to endure that, especially as a child, made him more than uncomfortable. Still, Tony trusted him with it, and he was determined to finish it. Blinking, Steve returned his attention to where he’d left off:
“Wait, was that the Jersey incident?” Rhodey asked, clearly overwhelmed by the information, “Why the fuck would two Brooklyn boys even
Thankfully, Peter stayed quiet, sated by his meal and Tony’s warm arms. By the time he was being lowered into his bassinet, he was asleep again, not even twitching when Tony covered his legs with furs and bent down to kiss his forehead.
Once Sam had turned on his heel and left, Tony sat down on the mattress, the fight gone out of him for the moment. PJ put his hands on Tony’s knee, brown and blue concern staring up at him with wide eyes. With a sad smile, Tony murmured soft reassurances to him, carefully brushing his floppy curls behind his ear without spooking him.
