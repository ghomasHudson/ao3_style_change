"Tony Stark and Iron Man are not one and the same. Tony Stark is just a normal human; Iron Man is a superhero. Most of the time I'm just Tony Stark."
"Sort of. I used to adore him. I adored him blindly. But I don't really know him. Even though, afterward, he and I were very, very... Familiar. He is too old. It's hard to understand, you know, and I don't have much patience."
"Unfortunately, the number is so popular that it's already been taken. How about 0629? I'll take a look at the records. Oh, there are so many earths. It's occupied too."
"All right, all right. Don't come! No! Ohmy! I'm so scared!" Steve shivered. Then he started running around the shelves. Bucky was running after him.
"Can the X-Men still send out powerful mind controllers? Cyclops." Steve switched to the contact channel with the X-men.
The puzzled Tony watched carefully as the mask slowly lifted. For the moment, he saw a boy with tawny hair and tawny eyes. It was exactly what Tony had expected.
"She is out of danger and needs to be hospitalized for a few more days. You can go and see her now, but don't stay too long. She needs a rest.”
"It's actually Tony Stark's mission. I have a date with a girl today. I don't want to be late for my first date."
Yes, there she was, slumped in a corner. Tony ran at her. The armor system diagnosed her immediately. Her signs were normal, just a few bruises. She was briefly unconscious.
"Also, I want to add a little heat. If I win, you need to learn how to operate armor from me, and put on the armor I made for you to fight".
"Ha-ha......" Steve looked down at Tony and laughed. "Tasha, you heard Iron Man. He and I are dealing with a personal affair and we can't attend. Happy New Year."
Tony felt as if Jarvis had winked at him and smiled. But the housekeeper's professionalism soon restored his deadpan expression.
"Turbulence will be fixed as you planned. As for Doom? He still exists. He to destroy, you to build. As I said, the universe must balance. If there is a Tony Stark on that planet, there must also be a Victor von Doom."
"Here you are, Meg. I've told you many times, it's dangerous here. Don't go near here. With this new job, we'll have more money. I’ll find a wife to take care of you as soon as I can. You've been out in the wild for too long. Now, get in the truck, we're moving today. I don’t want to be late for work tomorrow."
Tony felt the man in his arms shocked, his T-shirt was also pulled up by him. He felt the rough callus of his fingers brushing his exposed skin. Got you, Tony thought with a smile.
Steve waited quietly. After about two hours, he heard the door of the armor storage open and Tony's footsteps coming closer to the door of his room. Steve's mouth turned up. Then the door was slammed open, the corridor light burst through the darkness as usual, and he used to shade his eyes with his hand. Before he could get used to it, Tony had jumped on top of him, pinching his ribs, and then his passionate, hurried kiss fell.
As Tony flew toward the Pennines, more violent earthquakes followed. The combination of the earthquake and heavy rains triggered flash floods, raising river levels and sending boulders tumbling down with mud and sand. Tony turned on the Avengers contact device built into the armor.
"You have been sitting on it for so long, your feet are numb, right? This stair must be ten metres high. I don't want to sign your cast."
"Hey! Would you two guys please consider a serious fight with me?" Ignored for a long time, Frostbite raged. An ice storm swept them.
"Because you deny it, am I supposed to believe you? You're not on any list of paladins." Tony challenged.
"My friend Pete is shy. Where do you two want to go next?" Tony said. "I have a full tank of gas and free tonight."
Tony didn't have the strength to talk back this time. He left a series of gasps. As his clothes peeled off one by one, his body gave the answer. As Tony was carried naked to bed, his dim eyes were only on the blond man in front of him.
Tony held a strange pike of various kinds of kitchenware assembled machine rushed out of the restaurant.
"And what else? What happened then? I don't remember anything. Maybe you hit me too hard, broke my head."
"My fault, it's all my fault. Oh, my God, Iron Man and Captain America, the heavyweight gossip of the heavyweight. Why would I want to be the first to know?  I'm just a little spiderman, stressed out. Oh, my god, my heart. By the way, is the pressure on me to keep this big secret going to get me the spider-armor any closer?"
"Yes, I've got it ready for you. You'd better take a quick shower and shave that beard off your chin. That's not going to impress you in front of a jury. It was too late to go by car, so I sent a helicopter. Are you satisfied with these arrangements, Mr. Stark?"
"But like I said, Tony and I go way back, and I admire the Avengers." She put her hands lightly around the man's neck, leaned back, stared at the eyes that peeped out from under the mask. Her perfume, with a fleshy smell, made Tony faint and restless. But he continued to act calm.
"Yeah, that's it. It was just an accidental small fire, no big deal. Iron Man happened to be nearby, saved everyone. "Kris clutched at the straw. "It's late. I'm tired, I want to sleep."
"I thought you fancy men. It's just, you know, you're... Of course, it's nothing, it's really nothing, whatever, as your friend I will support you. I am your good friend Spiderman. All right?"
Tony hung his head for a moment. Then he continued, "Well, I apologize. I'm sorry that I'm not a holy man with the Avengers Charter in my Bible, and that I can't play by your and his rules. I am sorry to be a stain on this sacred organization and on your perfect leadership. Do you want me to put this apology on the record, Cap?"
What Steve was trying to say was that the Quinjet was parked on the roof of a building next to the hospital. Now if he flew back in Tony's armor, he would come back later to retrieve the plane. But better go back in his armor, isn’t it? See him arrogantly flying in circles, drawing red flames.
Steve fell into that dream again. There was moonlight and starlight in the dream, but there was no red figure leading him in front. He ran through the jungle. He was fatigued. He could no longer run. He walked, stopped, and walked. At the end of the winding path, he glimpsed an old castle, a black medieval castle. He did not know why, but he knew that Tony was there. So, he tried with his last strength to move towards the castle.
When they got back to the mansion, it was already morning. Tony flew into Steve's room through the open window. Pressing button on the chest, the armor retracted the pack. Take off the armor, he is just Tony Stark. Exhausted. Tony leaned on Steve's shoulder, listened to his gabbling.
"Iron man, are you coming here to die? Your shell is the best conductor. I’ll make you into an electric skewer. Ha-ha." Electro roared with laughter.
Tony left Doom's castle with a full stomach of questions. Although Tony was full of doubts, once again he was inspired by hope, the hope of staying in this era.
"The permanent staff are out on duty. Besides, this is a business for Stark Enterprises. It's a private matter. It's not for them to meddle in."
"That's nonsense. So, by your logic, Zodiac has been sublimated from a criminal group to some kind of cult, dedicated to creating chaos, through terrorist activities to balance the universe? Don't glorify your crime. I've heard too many excuses. Every year, there are several lunatics that hurt innocent people in the name of saving most people in the world."
He knows when to provoke me, when to make me laugh, when to lose patience, when to be aroused... Even when I fell asleep last night, it was because he wanted me to.
"There's no time to explain now. I can fix this, trust me." Tony gave Steve a little kiss, then activated the armor, became Iron Man, flew out of the window.
“I don't know if Tony Stark's henchmen are protecting me or hurting me. They treated me like a little kid, trying to protect me from That-Tony's world, from his enemies, from his network, from his empire, from everything he stood for. But belong to his past constantly looking for me.
"Maybe you should count on us. Because you're all a bunch of headstrong idiots." Doctor Octopus scolded.
“Whoever is the lucky man will not let a beautiful girl like you down." Tony narrowed his eyes and bent his head to kiss Kris as he slowly pulled down her skirt...
Tony is muttering the name now, rubbing his desire. He didn't want the process to end too soon. Because he'd never let him get it too soon. He would slowly let his desire accumulate, slowly let it harden... He would brush the tip of his tongue from its base to its tip, repeating the process over and over again, adding a little more force each time... Until he grabbed the folds of the sheets underneath himself, breathed helplessly again, and kept calling his name.
"Sound identified, glide deployed." Confirmation came from the system, and the transparent steel wire mesh wings were unfurled under the armpits of the spider's armor. Iron Spider-Man skated through the night sky in New York.
“It's a bit dark here, isn't it?" Bain said as she approached Iron Man. The moment she reached him, she slipped out of his sight with a sideways smile, sat down on the next sofa. Her hand that didn't hold the glass smoothed the wrinkles out of the skirt.
"My infrared thermal energy is becoming less and less effective at defusing his attacks. Just like he really has unlimited energy reserves, but I don't. Wait a minute... I think I've found something... Are you getting colder and colder?"
"I witan se in beadu in New York City. Lin and Mod, gast and sawol ne gedaledlice. Thou mortals be megan. Butan wit Gods alibban for fela gears, cunnan be mann, cunnan be wif, cunnan be eald, can be geong, eall for ansien, butan midd a man.(I already know that in the battle of New York City. Body and mind, spirit and soul are not separated. You mortals are confused. But we Gods survive for a thousand years, can be male, can be female, can be old, can be young, all on its surface, but inside eventually one.)"
"Are you being too hard on him? We don't need him to take so many missions. We have plenty of hands now. He is still young. His experience can be accumulated in battles. None of us knew how to fight on the first day." Jane said a little sadly. Tony shambled from the training room back to his room that day. The house wasn't that big, and the news was always spreading fast.
"I surrender! Because my stomach hurts, ha-ha." The boy with dark curly hair was holding his stomach and laughing. "It was so funny! My stomach hurt with laughter."
The light was strong enough to illuminate the narrow corridor. There were several bloody tracks on the floor of the corridor, leading towards the door. It was clear that the person who had left the tracks had left the house. Krats went further into the living room. Joseph Rogers lay motionless on his back on the living room floor, his eyes wide open, his face smeared with blood. Krats crouched down and felt his breath. He was no longer breathing. He touched his wrist. His pulse stopped. He was indeed dead. The body was surrounded by shards of glass. Beside it was a round shield of red, white and blue, still stained with blood.
"I habbe be feorr fram Midgard for fela months, butan how cunnan mine froend's geþohtas be hydan fram me? Se nuances cunnan be secgan to me. I wille lufige to hyran. Jarvis, folgap se win!(Although I have been away from Midgard for several months, how can my friend's thoughts be hidden from me? The nuances can be said to me. I would like to hear its details. Jarvis, serve the wine!)"
"It's urgent and I can't wait for you to put on your armor again. But since you remember the causes and effects of the creation of this earth, I don't need to explain them to you all over again."
Driving sports cars, chasing girls, the only occasional troubles are homework and girls' minds, and there is no need to be on call to save the earth. This is a university life that Tony has not experienced for a long time, so he feels very relaxed tonight. Kris talked about modern art and contemporary philosophy; Tony talked about space and Silicon Valley technology. Completely different fields, but they easily merged into common ground. They also discovered shared interests in electronic music and car racing, which led Tony to learn that Kris had been the lead singer in an underground band in London and had taken part in local underground car racing. This is information that Tony does not have.
"Don't you forget it? I was Tony Stark before I was Iron Man, a young genius. None of that is a big deal. Do you want to hear good news or bad news first?
It was dark, the canyon was colder, the campfire was smaller, Tony was a little cold, he leaned over to Steve. The difference between ordinary people and superhumans, much less resistant to cold. Steve had folded his arms under his head, and looked up at the stars. But he was obviously careful to notice Tony's little movements, pulled up the blanket they were covering. The long-stored field survival kit in the Quinjet finally came into use.
"How much work should I do in earthing, watering, fertilizing, sunning, catching insects and so on?"
Tony was dragged away by her. She turned a few corners and pushed open the door of Rush's Fraternity house.
"How can that be? I'm an expert at video games." Tony was calculating: His armor is equipped with a sensor, he can defuse the object if it detects the location of the attack. "But I need to do some scans first."
"I should say I have a good memory. I remember the bodies of all the men I've slept with, and you are so unforgettable. After all, there is only one Tony Stark in the world, isn't it? Don't stop. Don't worry about it. The secret of your identity is safe with me."
"Yes, that's what you think. You sent me here thirty minutes ago, I don't remember. But you sent me here months ago, I do remember. The difference is that I was wearing armor. My armor is recording all the time. I just watched the video afterwards. So what you're telling me now, I won't remember when I get back to Earth 20200629-TS, because I'm not wearing armor at all. And damn it, I'm not wearing anything at all!"
Tony played the message on a loop. In the quiet night, Steve's voice covered the sound of rain outside. With magnetism and magic, the sound penetrated Tony's every cell and thrilled Tony's blood. Tony closed his eyes slowly. His body remembered his rough caresses, his heavy and light kisses, the tingling of his breath, the heat and the leaping glow of the tingling. Tony reached out and touched himself, from his lip to his ear, from his neck to his Adam's apple, and then his chest, ribs, abdomen, navel... downwards. This was the way he had kissed him, the way his kiss had landed on him and aroused his desire. At that time, he tended to go around the core of his desire, to the inside of his thigh where he nibbled gently at the skin. Each bite made Tony shiver, shivering to the rhythm of his gnawing. He raised his legs, straightened his toes, and gathered round his broad back. At that time, he would often stop, come to his ear, and say to him with a kind of gentle. The deep voice can crush all his willpower. "If you want, beg me, Tony.”
Another flash of lightning struck. Tony hit back with sound waves. Electro was knocked back a few steps, but quickly came back.
Well done, well done, Tony smiled pompously, no one died, no one was seriously hurt, and I did... And so on... Hang on... Oxygen... Spark... Air flow...
Steve pulled Tony around the corridor. Though they did it very gently, they bumped into Jarvis just before they reached the door of Steve's room. Jarvis strutted along, holding the tray firmly in his hand. Tony wished he was wearing invisible armor.
Spiderman sat down next to Tony, half opened his mask, drank coke through a straw, swung his legs out of the building.
What Tony concealed was that he had to use earth technology energy to integrate and activate it. The only Earthly technology around to provide enough power is Tony's chest implant backup power.
“I think you're mistaken, Mr. Carbonell. I know it's a family business, and I have no intention of changing its name. I'm not here to buy your steel plant. And I don't have any money."
"I once forgot the code at that time, triggered the whole mansion to be locked down. He had to fly back from California overnight. The next day, because I insisted, he took the combination lock off. You know, the mansion was not very large. When Avengers have an urgent mission, one or two may break into my room, like Hawkeye."
"No. You're not a coward. You're the bravest one I've ever met. Remember the last time we met, you challenged six or seven boys twice as strong as you to protect your mother's reputation?"
"There's no hurry to start a fight. I've prepared a long speech. I haven't finished speaking yet." Tony smiled relaxed, not at all nervous about facing the enemy.
"Heavy snow has hit 32 states in the United States, and... Dr. McCoy is making weather controllers... Zzzzz.. We agreed after deliberation... Zzzz... He needs help..." Said the Black Widow.
Tony looked up, a little embarrassed. He sat up, took a little distance from Steve. The man's face blurred in the heavy rain. Taking off his uniform, he looked less solemn.
"Well, I think so, sometimes. But there is still a long way off. We need to make some adjustments..."
With a thin moon, a can of chickpeas, a pot of coffee and an acoustic guitar, it's like jumping into the West in 1872. Everything was so calm; It would have been a vacation if he hadn't thought of Hawkeye and Spider-Man getting lost.
But the consolation didn't work. Against the brilliance of Captain America, Tony felt more and more gloomy and small.
"Because the key to saving the planet isn't the meeting inside at all. You're the one holding the key."
Steve looked up in disbelief and opened his eyes wide. Then his face flushed again, and his tongue was once more tied.
Then Tony went back to Steve's room as if he had never left. But of two spaces joined, and his head was a bit dizzy. Steve also noticed Tony's absent-minded.
Garth, professor Eldon's assistant, asked when the scientific paper he had been putting off for a week would be due. Tony adds in the memo: Call Garth, explain that "Fired, arm injury, paper submission will be delayed by two weeks." priority 2.
"Forget the damn shift, it's early morning, they're all back, so you're off." He left another row of teeth mark on Steve's neck. After a pause, he lowered his voice, whispered in Steve's ear, "Now you just need to think of me... Only think of me..."
"How come? I didn't know about it. I never took it. Wait a minute, if you say so, Captain America is on the island. That's great! I don't have to try, I don't have to worry, I just need to wait to be rescued."
“Yes. Her name is Kris. She's an exchange student from London. She's very pretty. I remember telling you about her." Tony said.
The pigeons flying and falling on the square, the children running with balloons, the street artists playing performances, the teenagers skateboarding... Everything is so calm, such is the life of ordinary people. This kind of life can be fun to watch for a while, but then it gets boring. Tony got bored.
Peter didn't answer. Tony thought Peter was asleep, but Peter was not. He just didn't want to answer. He just didn't want to remind Tony that he had been talking about Cap for an hour. He told him he didn't want to know the details, did he? Why can't he remember?
"What did Victor say in his college dorm room? It was like, 'Fool, being so close to the screen will ruin your eyeballs. 'So now he says it again."
"Not much. I'm not a good party organizer. I don't know how to go around talking, how to heat up the atmosphere."
He did not dry his hair, the water dripped down his forehead, down his cheek, down his ears, down his neck, and onto the collar of his baseball shirt.
"Yep, here I am, just in time to save your life. It's a rookie mistake to handle such a dangerous super criminal alone without help, Cap."
"I can't believe it. He's a robot. It looks just like a real person." Paige said, standing next to Steve.
"So, I was wrong. I shouldn't have mentioned it in the first place. I sometimes forget how much you like to fuss over such details."
Tony stood up and followed Steve to the emergency room next door. During the doctor's treatment of the wound, apart from answering the doctor's questions, Tony didn't say a word. Steve didn't break the ice.
The man in the mirror had unkempt hair, stubble on his chin, and bloodshot eyes. You can't go to Mrs. Rogers like this. She'll panic even more. He straightened out his messy hair, washed his face and used the nearby razor to shave his chin.
Bang! The sound of his mother hitting the table. Crash! The sound of the table toppling over. He hit her. He hit her again. His mother's cry pierced Steve's heart and his hands clenched into fists. His heart ached, he was angry, but he was also afraid. His father is invincible, tall, strong. He has tusks. He is a monster, a demon, the incarnation of all his nightmares together.
The night color is thick before dawn. New York, a noisy city, was also a little quiet, only drunks and stray cats crossing the streets now. A motorbike was speeding along, smoothly skirting the yellow taxi on the main road, weaving into the lane. Although there were few vehicles and no traffic jams at this time, Steve still took a short cut, rushed to get back to the mansion.
On that weekend, Paige was alone at the Magic Toy shop. Tomorrow they were moving to a new apartment in Manhattan because of her brother's new job. She had always wanted to get out of the neighborhood, but she didn't think this day would come so suddenly. The thought of not seeing Steve every day at school filled her with sadness, which took off her joy at leaving. She regretted what she had said to Steve. The friends she considered important did not bring her the same happiness as when Steve was with her. She had been thinking about him all these days, and about the Magic Toy Shop. So she wanted to see him again before she left, to say she was sorry, and hope that he would forgive her. When she arrived at Magic Toy Shop, she found a sign of "Close" on the door. She sat in the doorway and waited for a long time until her brother appeared.
"You don't have to do this, Doom. As long as you stop doing things that try to conquer the world, the Avengers will definitely give you a second chance, and I'll definitely give you a second chance."
"Well... All right." He unbuckled his cravat, unbuttoned his overalls, and his shirt, one by one. He took off his shoes, tucked the socks neatly into them. He put out one foot, probed the water with his toes, then drew it back.
"And I spent the whole night thinking about making a machine that would erase all of your memories of this event."
"You are the one whose life is shattered. You are the one who hides yourself. You buried your true self under all those fine words you said to your students, and now it's out."
Steve's speech landed, the crowd below was in an uproar, many with horrified looks, and reporters began asking questions.
"Or we should rush out, look him in the eyes and say. ‘We are not at all wrong’. If he hits you, we'll fight back. There are two of us." Bucky said, shaking his fist.
"Aha, you see? What did I tell you?" Wanda said with a smile. "Tasha has always known how to make a team work best. So, you're on my team today."
“Besides, we're not all lost tonight, and I think I found something very funny, very-very funny." Bain said with a narrowed smile.
Easier than I thought. The flower giver chuckled. He pulled out a syringe from the flowers, and approached the bed softly. He poured the liquid into the hanging flask, and turned off the nearby monitoring device.
"When I was a kid, I lived in a really, really big house, and at night, in the dead of night, there would often be a strange noise coming from downstairs, whoo, whoo, buzz, buzz... Some things like this. Like crying, or like a song."
The data showed that the neutralizing still requires a significant amount of energy. What about the rest? Looking around, Tony understood. Central Park was full of weeping couples saying goodbye. Giant Man and Wasp, Quicksilver and Crystal, Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Woman... Tony felt the urge to lift his mask and rub his eyebrows again.
"The money is in your pocket. All you have to do is get there, buy a bat, quietly leave it at his house and let him think it is a birthday present from his father. Don't let him find you. If he does, don't draw too much attention to yourself. Make an excuse and leave."
"Not this time. My cousin saw Iron Man and Captain America had a fight in Central Park about an hour ago." Said another.
"You know, I just want to be a good neighbor, but those of the world's mightiest heroes invited me again and again. I also refused them again and again. Later, I couldn’t bear to break their hearts again and again. I just hung a name on the list. And why would you fight yourself?!"
He had run out of words made up in advance. His answer was to hand the picture to the girl. His face went red to his ears. Just as the girl reached for the painting...
"Tony... Are you sure you want to do this? I don't think it's a good idea. So many people were here, the matter could be discussed at a better time, maybe next time." Whispered Spiderman.
“That doesn't mean we need your help. We Yorkshiremen can look after ourselves. Get out of here!" Seth punched Spider-Man.
"He's gone." Tasha said. "He has important matters to attend to. Let's continue our meeting. Where were we..."
You know, on campus, there's always one party after another. By the time I start drinking my 10th beer, I can't remember how much I've had. Then I think I can do anything. I took the frat boys on a prank. I went to jail. Got bailed out, I didn't learn my lesson. I kept drinking and clowning around with them, forgetting that I am the Iron Man, not just a dumb college kid.
He knew that he was dreaming. Then he fell into complete darkness. He was opening his eyes in a dream. A hazy face appeared before him. He dreamed that he knew the person's name, but no matter how much he shook his vocal chords, he could not pronounce it. He dreamed that he knew the vague face, but that no matter how hard he opened his eyes he could not see it. He felt bound, though he did not feel the ropes to which he was bound. He struggled, but all the struggle touched was the air.
The party at The Mansion was not lively. It was impromptu, not many people were present, except for the resident staff of the Mansion. Jane and Hank were still on their way from Southampton with the Quicksilver family. Black Widow, the organizer of the party, is a cold fish. She was dressed as usual, sitting gracefully on the sofa with a glass of wine in her hand.
I'm not an irresponsible playboy, I'm not him. So, Tony cut out almost everything, stayed in the lab. With Dr. Pym's help, they finally broke through. Professor Elden woke up. Tony cheered, hugged Dr. Pym.
"So, with Iron Man under investigation for murder, I’m without a bodyguard. Fair game for kidnappers, terrorists, anyone. If you could possibly...?"
"Umm if you say so, it was the beautiful first love that made Captain America, that gave him the inner drive, the great heart, blah, blah... Well, now I know how important the blonde girl is."
"Just call me Tony." Tony held out his hand enthusiastically to shake, but found that both Sebastian's hands were full. Tony had to pull his hand back.
"I want to kiss you all the time, but let's get back to work. Let me see how many super criminals we still need to catch." Tony shrugged when he saw the figures. "Wow, surprises! It looks like we'll all be busy till dawn tomorrow."
Thor threw the hammer. Steve threw the shield. The agent operating the airship was shot down. Before the airship overbalanced and fell, Thor jumped on it. Steve jumped on it. Then they pulled Tony up. While Steve piloted the airship and Thor took charge of the airborne enemies, Tony took apart the panels and studied the airship's system. By this time, the streets of New York were already in a melee, full of panicked crowds and looting criminals.
"She would have sneaked back in afterwards, helped him up, and taken the portrait. She should be his first love, one of his best childhood memories, one of the most important reasons for him to believe in the bright side of human nature at an early age."
Doom laughed. Tony thought his laugh was horrible, like a pile of metal clashing. And he called him by his first name this time, which was also strange.
"I think what he taught me about fighting could come in handy." Imagining that picture, Tony's lips began to curl. "But not so fast. I'm attracted to Kris and I want to continue with her. I mean we're the same age. We have a lot in common. We have mutual friends on campus. I'm really comfortable with her. We're on the same page in bed..."
"Is that why he's been spending all day in his lab underground, trying to find a way to get him back?"
Crystal tried to pick up her little girl, but the little girl still had her arm around Spiderman's neck.
"Yep, here I am, just in time to save your life. It's a rookie mistake to handle such a dangerous super criminal alone without help, Cap."
"Handsome, are you alone today?" A little brown-haired boy came up the side road and walked beside Steve.
Steve's smile stopped. He saw the sparks in Tony's eyes. His voice grew deep, with a hint of defiance in it.
"Jarvis, if my memory serves me, I gave you explicit instructions not to disturb me. Looks like I need to tweak your program again."
"I know now that it was more than a simple compliment. It was enough to add to my ego. Wait a minute, let me see, if you can use this perverse thing, then you can send me back to that timeline. I can reprogram my space-time energy converter to stop Doom's plot."
"Okay, I'll do it for you." Steve pulled out the razor and shaving fluid behind the mirror, and stopped Tony from fidgeting. "Don't move, it will scratch."
"They are indeed astonishing! These probably have made a lot of money before The Great Depression, but no one cares about Life Build Invention anymore. TVs, air conditioners, and refrigerators can't sell out. Who needs these high-tech luxury products?"
Clint couldn't help but wonder, does this guy really have superpowers? No matter how, he looks so easy to die.
"Doom, you know precisely what is going on. The only way to fix the timeline is that I go back without the memory of this year."
Investment? The financial market has collapsed, securities dealers have run away, entrepreneurs have jumped off buildings, and there are only people who have nowhere to collect debts. Will anyone invest at this time? The Carbonell Steel had been in his hands for the third generation, and he was already heavily in debt. Despite several layoffs, it was still hard to keep going. All that was left of the Carbonell family was an empty shell.
"It's a kind of barrier coating. I have this ingredient in my armor. After my analysis of his cells, I believed that his cells had mutated. He acquired an ability to convert the heat energy of surrounding human bodies into a cold current. He relies on people around him to power him. By blocking his energy sources, he gradually loses momentum. I have transferred the ingredient formula to S.H.I.E.L.D. They are spraying everyone around. Another moment and the guy will break down."
"It's only version 1.0, but I think that's enough for today. All I need to do is dive in, destroy the backups on their mainframe, dive out, and everything will be fine. No fighting."
"I did. I believed every word you said, till I found out you are a slicker and a liar." Tony whispered 'liar' into Steve's ear, his tongue tip brushed over his ear drum.
As he put the note down, Tony felt a sense of desolation. He stretched out on the bed again, stared at the ceiling. Then he rolled over to the other side. Although the temperature had been lost for a long time, Tony was still unconsciously burying his head in the pillow, smelling it, looking for traces of his presence.
Victor helped Tony out of the field, the heavy alloy doors closing behind them. The armor disassembled into pieces by the robotic arms, floating in the center of the field.
"You're the one who needs to sleep now." Tony pulled the syringe from under the pillow and stuck it in Steve's arm.
The streets of New York City were empty in the wee hours of morning. Kris drove Tony in a cabriolet. The night wind ruffled his hair. He felt very comfortable.
"Spider sense... Spider is not a bug. Are you sure this is a good plan? With your dazzling red and yellow swaggering in there? At least I can climb the walls quietly."
Spider-Man, Level S Contact: Tony, I did a preliminary analysis of the minerals you gave me. It contains quartz, feldspar, plagioclase, pyrite... and traces of an unidentified crystalline substance, suspected to be non-earth material, that required further analysis against the Avengers' database.
"Some other day, Dr. Octopus is locked up, and can't run away. Besides, earth won't be destroyed for a while. Today we have another battle to fight."
"Well, we have to entirely neutralize Dr. Banner's personality in Hulk for a while, in order to bring out the best in Hulk."
"I feel like the DJ is giving me a hard time tonight, playing modern pop all the time. The old man doesn’t know how to dance and they can keep taking you away." Steve said.
Time passed imperceptibly by them. By the time Tony noticed it was nearly midnight, they were the last two people in the restaurant. Tony pulled out her chair, put a coat around her.
"I had a nagging teacher who liked to make speeches and often told me a lot of life lessons. At that time, I couldn't wait to interrupt him every time, but I can still memorize a few sentences."
"Believe it or not, the reason I'm here so late today is because I received feedback from the security services. Bain's mainframe system had been hacked in the early hours of yesterday morning. The intruder was very careful, an expert, coming and going without a trace, the camera had no record, and our alarm system did not detect any malicious programs. Until you tampered with it tonight, they realized there was a trace of the program being implanted. The program is harmless to the system itself, but it emits a signal of a certain frequency. Because the signal was blocked by the building's interference, it was not immediately noticed. I also hurried over after being told of this. And would I leave it in an unprotected drawer so obviously?"
"I... er... You're the one who told me not to mess with the timeline because it would cause a paradox..."
"The thing in today, it can be big or small. If I call the police or press now, the headlines tomorrow will be about the Avengers break-in Bain illegal. And Stark Enterprises will be sued."
"Take off your shoes before you come in, don’t make the floor dirty. Mother will be angry." Seth urged.
"All you guessed is right, but you're still not going to trap me. I can't kill you, but that doesn't mean I can't touch you, as long as you're alive. Or are you confident in your fighting?" The Spymaster positioned for battle, stared at Tony, prepared to fight.
"You really need to upgrade your superhero library. Do you think my name is iron-man, which means my armor is made of iron?" As he said, Iron Man fell slowly to the roar of his jet boots. When he landed, he rushed to the unconscious Steve, holding his head.
"I see. It's just like transplanting plants. They need to make earth, water, fertilize, sunbathe and catch insects. Could you be more specific? What the hell am I doing now? I'm still naked and the planet is about to be destroyed, so can you skip the theory section quickly? By the way, how soon will the earth be destroyed?"
"I'm sure, Tasha." Steve glanced back at the Black Widow and walked out the gate, quickly surrounded by a group of reporters.
"You're a time travel enthusiast. You've got a lot of space-time energy stored in your body. Now you're showing off, waiting for me to ask you for help."
"I admit it. I enjoyed it." Bain gave a seductive smile. "His body, as strong as I remembered it, is even better than that."
"You made a worse mistake by teasing me." Steve gave Tony a hot look and Tony gave him an emotional smile in return.
Kris's brother has a thick Yorkshire accent. Kris jumped out of the carriage and gave him a big hug.
"Cap, it’s really hard for me to understand you. You're a terrible ascetic. I'll take the opportunity to go out and have fun with girls." Clint interposed.
"Tony Stark?!" The giver started, then he calmed and said: "You see. All I want to know is' why didn't the poison work on you?’"
"It doesn't really make a difference whether I tell you or not, especially now, I don't have an answer myself. Besides, didn't you say I was the one to make the plan?" Tony said.
"Tony Stark, you said you wanted proof, huh? This is the evidence. Although you don't have high-end knowledge of the universe, if you are really the smartest human being in this era, you can still figure out the function of this device, right? See for yourself."
"That's why I told you eat something before you rush out. We can't catch them all at once." Steve said.
"You dropped this bomb out of thin air, and I'm in a mess. All kinds of news media, all kinds of bureaucracies are pointing at S.H.I.E.L.D. and asking me when is the earth going to be destroyed?" Fury bellowed through his cigar.
"Where is the good captain? I haven't seen him. I only saw a man who wanted to do some dirty things with you again."
It's late November. There's an extraordinary tornado in Colorado, which is not in the hurricane belt. Seriously? Tony immediately put on his armor, rushed out.
"If you want me to follow, just say it directly. I'm not you, I'm so honest. If I were serious, didn't follow, what would you do now?" Steve punched the Spymaster’s face. The Spymaster wiped the blood from his own mouth, and stared hard at Steve. But Steve was clearly not paying much attention to him.
"Don't you want to go to Stark's ball? I think a lot of people would like to get to know you as a genius inventor. Now that the Depression is over, your other inventions will attract a lot of investors, but of course I want you to give Carbonell Industries priority."
Tony opened his helmet, raised his arms, folded his hands under his nose, and stared silently at the line on the screen for a long time. He did not know where it came from, or from whom, but it was the answer, the answer to everything. Although Tony had speculated many times before. He was a scientist, and he only believed in evidence. He would not reach a conclusion until he had concrete evidence. Deep down, he did not want to reach the conclusion. But now that he had all the evidence in front of him, he had to face it. Tony was running out of time and his options were nearly gone.
"My name is Kris DeGann, I'm here to bail Tony Stark." A girl with short brown hair, shiny brown eyes, wearing a jacket, jeans and sneakers, said to the police.
"Ha, ha," Tony said, making his laugh sound as natural as possible. "It seems so. Someone else is behind this. I won't bother you, Ms. Bain.”
The next day, the Krats Magic Toys was as it had been before, grey and eerie, strange and horrible, with no customers.
"No need. It's all water under the bridge. I came from Los Angeles to New York to join my cousin, but he died, too."
Tony paused. "He had plenty of chances to kill me. How hard could it be to kill an unarmed student at Columbia? But he went to a lot of trouble to hire Whiplash, Spymaster such as the top killer, but so far has not succeeded.
Before taking the kid, Mrs. Rogers smoothed her hair awkwardly, carefully covering a bruise at the corner of her eye with her fringes.
A flush came to Steve's face, and so did Paige. Then they rolled up their sleeves and began to sweep the shelves.
"I can pick numbers! It's really convenient to have access to multiverse management systems. Let me see... What about 0529?"
Armor depletes energy quickly, while Electro's energy is endless. He can absorb the electrostatic particles around him and convert any energy into electricity for his own use. He is like a transformer.
"Cap, are you sure you wouldn't consider changing to a laser shield? I can build one for you, or add some remote control to your old one, so that it can point and hit anywhere without having to practice a thousand times. Build you an armor that provides more reliable protection than your flag suit. Of course, after I have more money, I am relatively poor now. He died and left me nothing, but I have a few ideas that would solve my financial problems."
Hand in hand, they entered the house, took off their shirts, dyeing them red and blue, and hung them on the clothesline in the backyard. They laid side by side under the drying shirts and watched them fluttering in the breeze.
Steve continued to walk slowly along the long wall, his hands fluttering over the names on the monument, but his thoughts turned to the future, some kind of strange future...
"So, which one of you is my sister's boyfriend?" Seth spoke as he sat in his rocking chair by the fire.
"You're so stupid! I knew that! I can’t count on useless heroes like you." Doctor Octopus beat the wall angrily.
The cold of the window and the heat of the man's body in front of him alternately stimulated Tony's desire. Halfway through the unbuttoning, Tony's eyes hazed over. He put his legs together, hooked the man's back in front of him, and shouted his name over and over again.
Tony cleared all relevant data from the mainframe, closed his helmet, and prepared to leave the Bain Tower. Before he got up, he noticed another trail of water under the champagne on the mainframe table. It's been moved. That means someone came here after he left. Tony was quick to react. Is that the line he/she left for me? But the mainframe security protection set by myself has no trace of intrusion. Tony had buried the doubt. Whoever it is, it is not someone I need to know urgently. He had more important things to do now, and he hoped it was not too late. He didn't want to give up. He didn't want to give up yet.
"Iron Man?! How did you come to England? How did you get into this channel? Mudslide? What the hell is that? Is this a prank?" Said the driver in a thick Yorkshire accent.
"Today a bunch of thieves broke into the art museum in your area, stole Picasso's painting. I thought it would never happen again." Said a policeman.
"Didn’t you use the same banner you used to celebrate Thor’s birthday last time to save money? It's almost like whitewashing the two zeros at the end of 2000 and putting a grinning shell head in that place." Tony said.
Steve said, throwing the shield out and heading for the weak spot where Iron Man's elbow was connected. Tony leaned out of the way. But Steve's trick was a sham. The shield was just trying to get his opponent's attention, which was his usual tactic. In fact, he had already gone around the back of Iron Man, kicked hard at the right knee of the armor. This time Iron Man didn't get out of the way and was kicked straight. Tony lost balance, lurched forward two steps. Before he could control his balance, Steve, who had caught the shield, raised it and hit the Iron Man's left knee. The joint is always the weak point of the armor, and if hit this time, the armor will be damaged at least 30% more. It was too late for Tony to duck, so he fired his jet boots. The armor crashed into the trees. Trees were smashed into each other, but the impact of the armor was lessened; Iron Man fell to the ground hard.
"You refused to forget him, you refused to be That-Tony, you wanted this you to continue, to exist, and that place happened to be a place full of space-time energy, and you gathered that energy and created this universe."
Meanwhile, you made another mistake. The fake florist called me to pry into Kris' hospital room. It was this call that allowed me to determine when and how you would carry out the plan. I tracked you back, enticed you and trapped you." Tony finished his deduction slowly, smiled triumphantly.
Steve stroked Tony's hip through the jeans, tracing the shape over and over again, sliding down to the inside of his thigh, and up, and forward, and deep...
"That's why I told you to eat something before you rush out. We can't catch them all at once." Steve said.
"You know, I really understand you. They don't trust me either." Tony said. "Black Widow deliberately grounded me. Hawkeye treats me like a wicked seed.”
"It was only when he was a little older than me, Kang put an evil blot on his heart. It gradually eroded. One day, he lost his mind, became Kang's dog, helped him to conquer earth, tried to enslave all mankind!" Tony was repressed for a long time.
"I don't think this is the result of the prolonged winter. It looks like our job has come. Fortunately, I didn't leave. Avengers Assemble!" Tony was suddenly in high spirits.
After dodging another attack from Electro, Tony told the system, "Concentrate all the energy on Uni-Beam. Fire!"
"Well, if you refuse the proposal, it’s not my fault. "Tony took off his backpack, threw it at Steve.
Thunder in the middle of the night woke Tony from a light sleep. He went to the window to look out. Outside, the wind and hail were falling from the sky. The ground shook under Tony's feet. He heard a distant roar and the sound of falling rubble. A terrible idea entered his mind. He ran back to the bed and shook Peter awake from his sleep.
"A playboy? It sounds dangerous and attractive. Since you're not interested, next time I see him, won't you mind if I talk to him a little more?"
"Now I can go back to bed. Happy New Year everyone." Hawkeye got up and left, smashing into Spider-Man as he hurried through the door.
Steve felt the tears and calluses in his mother's hands. He felt a surge of guilt and powerlessness.
"Hulk is completely out of control now, how are you going to get him to hit the right spot?" Steve said.
"ZiZi... Wanda... ZiZI... I..." Vision closed his eyes. His circuit board continued to sizzle. Wanda's tears rolled down her face. She had lost him again.
"Do you think a shake of your dark hair, a sunny smile, and a little sweet compliment would make whole world girls throw themselves into your arms? Maybe the previous owner of this mask will, but I won't!”
"Three, two, one, zero... One minute is up. Don’t blame me. You guys don't run. Now, let us start playing." The boy with brown hair struck a fighting pose.
Five minutes later, Spymaster was knocked to the floor. He stumbled to his feet, wiped the blood of his mouth, and looked angrily at Tony.
Avengers are not an official body run by the government. We are more like a family; Everyone is a family member. We might have arguments, misunderstandings and lies, but we also have understanding, protection and forgiveness.
"This is... Iron Man, I'm an Avenger. I'm here to help you. Please don't panic. The heavy rain and earthquake have caused mudslides. It is very dangerous to stay at the bottom of the valley. Please evacuate to the following position..."
So Steve followed his lead and didn't resist. He felt Tony's kiss on his lips again, and he opened his lips slightly to accept the entrance of his tongue. When the kiss was over, his lust for Tony intensified. He squinted at the familiar and somewhat unfamiliar man. Mature and childlike in Tony's face, giving Steve a more hazy sense of unreality.
From a shadowy corner, Doom stepped out in silver armor and a dark green cloak. Without saying a word, he fired a laser directly at the Iron Man. Alarmed, Tony deftly ducked out of the way and hid behind a nearby knight's armor, raising his gauntlet to fire a repulsor. Doom came straight up and smashed the armor with ease, sending shards of steel flying across the Iron Man. The Iron Man was quick to react and hid behind a statue again. Doom continued to attack Iron Man's new shelter, and more laser attacks came. The Iron Man ran to the next. And soon, the hall was filled with shards of steel and rubble. Iron scraps and stone powder were floating in the air, effectively reducing the visibility of the hall and obstructing the route, which obviously disturbed Doom. The Iron Man had come up behind him, and hit him in the back with a repulsor. Doom fell forward. Wires fluttered from the destroyed armor. Tony walked over to the fallen Doom, looked down, unsurprisingly, a Doom robot.
"Now you should be glad I have this little hobby. They came to me, asked me to analyze the black circle and trace the source. Of course, they paid a lot of money. But it's not about money. It interests me, as a scientist.”
"Well done, you're smart enough, Tony Stark. I am now interested to hear how you discovered my disguise."
"Go down the alley around the corner and change your flag suit. I don’t want to stand out by eating at a fast-food restaurant with Captain America."
"Geniuses have to show up for classes and hand in papers. God knows how many classes I have missed and how long the papers have been delayed. I don’t even dare to open the memo and voicemail."
"But you are going to come back with me. The Quinjet you had piloted, I let Clint drive back. He had an unhappy day with Spider-man, just to give them some time to be alone on the way back. I'm also thinking of getting Spider-Man to participate in more missions, train to become a register member. Of course, vote at the founder's meeting. But he's got two votes now, hasn't he?" Said Black Widow, laughing.
Steve's father had already left. Steve didn't notice when he was leaving. He wasn't listening, he wasn't scared.
"There's no button, I pre-programmed your voice. All you have to say is, 'Computer, open the glide.'"
Steve's right hand slowly raised, swept Tony’s hair lightly, slid along his face angle to ear, then supported his face with palm. His blue eyes were fixed on Tony's. His other hand’s thumb gently wiped the tears from Tony's eye, ran across his cheek, ran across his labial angle, stopped between his lips, rubbing them around.
"At that time, he was being beaten up, and he was too stubborn to beg for mercy. You know, in case he got killed in an accident... Er, protecting rare species is everyone's responsibility."
"That's exactly what's happening now. As you know, this universe is a parallel universe that was created at the point where the pocket universe met your original earth, before your memory was overwritten.
But she lost all her memories. In her eyes, Tony was just a stranger. Tony didn't know whether to be happy or disappointed. After all, she is his first love. With the loss of her memory, Tony lost an important link to his past, and his past self was drifting away.
"I believe you." Peter murmured, his head resting on Tony's shoulder. "Kris doesn't mean love to you, does she?"
Tony's body was naked under the blanket, but there were remnants of the previous passion memories, unconscious responses to the familiar touch. As they do this thing more and more, it takes on a will of its own. It doesn't follow Tony's logic, it doesn't have Tony's thoughts, it doesn't hesitate, it doesn't want all the answers. It just falls into joy, not asking about the past, not caring about the future.
Hawkeye's expression was still cold, talkative Spiddy chose to shut his mouth, so that neither of them spoke all the way. The two men in the front didn't pay any attention to what was going on in the back. They were all focused on each other. They exchanged glances and whispered all the way. The contact on the Jet lighted up, Steve turned it on, and the voice of Black Widow came out.
"That's impossible. Otherwise, he couldn't have ambushed us at the exact time and place. Baseball tickets. Did you buy them with your name?"
It's my fault. I was so careless. All I wanted to do was run out of the house. I knocked over the last bottle of wine on the table. It's hard to get wine now. He is forced to stay at home to take care of me, and I’m always annoying him. It's my fault. It's all my fault. I deserve it. I deserve it. I deserve the whip.
Tony knew it was a sign that a girl was craving a kiss. He never wanted to disappoint a girl, especially the one he would throb with. So, Tony leaned down, and gave Kris a gentle kiss on her pale lips.
Kris was fast asleep in her bed, the little bed of the dormitory where the passion had been. Tony actually booked a room at the hotel at first, but he suddenly changed his mind, canceled the room just before he met Kris. After the kiss downstairs, Tony regretted the decision a little, but now it seemed that the small space, the thin walls, the roommate who might open the door and walk in at any moment, and the feeling of cheating made them want more. These made Tony really enjoy the sex. Lately he had almost forgotten the sense of conquest, the sense of control, the sense of security. These feelings gave Tony a lot of confidence, and even made him regain a little conceit. But these feelings won't bring him more sleep.
Tony didn’t know what to do with a pile of bottles and cans. He took blood samples from Spiderman and the golden mask girl. But cell biology is not his area of expertise. Dr. Pym and Dr. Banner are, and it's a little difficult for him to come up with an antidote in such a short time. But he's immune... Not by neutralizing the poison, but by an implant in the chest. Whatever, he took apart his chest implant to find out why he was immune to the poison.
"I am the new life form, I am the force of nature, I am Frostbite, you pathetic mortals are utterly vulnerable to the force of nature. Your weapon for me, but is children playing toys." A human frost monster fires icicles at New York police officers surrounding him, and the bullets they fire back crumble in the cold.
Usually crowded lively houses now seem a little empty, the others have not come back, a rare holiday, they are enjoying a day outside like ordinary people. He and Jarvis were left alone in the house. By this time Jarvis had gone to bed. Works every day for the Avengers. He needs a vacation, too. So, Steve tiptoed across the hall to the kitchen, and got himself a drink. He sat down on a chair in the living room, looked around at the pictures of the past, his mind drifting away again. And just as he was half-asleep, the phone rang wildly. The living room clock struck two. This is a daily contact phone, and the only person who answers it is Jarvis. The Avengers has a special contact channel, so it's not an emergency. Steve really couldn’t think of anyone who needed Jarvis at 2 am, but he didn't want to wake him up, so he answered the phone.
"Oh? So let's not talk about Spider-Man or the weather in England. Let's talk about something else..." Tony looked up again and kissed the man he was holding.
Tony wasn't sure if Steve had said those words. He just lost himself in his blue eyes. He wasn't sure if what was happening was really happening, or if it was just an illusion. But he was still expecting, some kind of expectation he could not define, expecting the illusion to go on, and he felt as though he had closed his eyes.
If it was the refraction of light that made Spymaster invisible, it was impossible to make him lose solid form. But he just vanished. Steve looked at Tony, and saw that Tony was not surprised by what had happened. He asked incredulously.
Does she have a special relationship with me? I haven't seen her before. Looks like That-Tony’s bad debt. But she was an attractive woman. Tony could imagine his future himself falling into such a woman like her.
Once again, Steve was on his motorcycle, searching the streets of New York, this time totally aimlessly... Finally, he stopped in Central Park, parked his motorcycle in the same spot. Then he sat on a bench, staring at the lawn. The lawn they had battered was now restored, but lifeless in the bleak wind. A feeling of powerlessness came over Steve.
"Ha-ha, I witan se Tony is gedon thy heorte. Ne sorh hit. I witan Tony for gears, fela beadus. He is na an nearu wac mann.(Ha-ha, I already know that Tony is holding your heart. Don't worry about it. I have known Tony for years, many battles on the battlefield. He is not a narrow- weak-minded man.)"
Tony Stark is dead. He died like a hero, but he didn’t get a hero’s funeral. Before his death, his mind had been corroded by Kang, he only woke up at the last moment. And the one who defeated him was himself 10 years ago. 19-year-old Tony Stark became the Iron Man, the only Iron Man.
"We're still young, aren't we? You can still go through this horrible growth, going through it with me. We can grow up together, grow old together, not too old. And one day I'll be the great Iron Man, you'll be the great Spider-Man."
"You definitely will! But I... I'll just be a little spiderman of the neighborhood, "said Peter, with a grin.
After seeing the moustachioed man's magic suitcase, Carbonell was ready to take a gamble. He took out a revolver from a drawer and fired a shot into the chest of the man in front of him.
It's late November. There's an extraordinary tornado in Colorado, which is not in the hurricane belt. Seriously? Tony immediately put on his armor, and rushed out.
"Thank God, Iron Man being around, everyone got out of there. And thank you, Tony, for being injured but staying out of the SICU room all night." Kris touched Tony's hand on her sickbed. A little blush came over her face.
The story of Tony 19 begins with "Crossing", ends with "Onslaught," which was my original writing plan. It also followed the history of Earth 616. But the 19-year-old Tony was coming alive. He was alive, conscious, thinking, and he was communicating his wishes to me. He didn't want to be just an echo and a memory of the 616-Earth-Tony. He infected me. So there was Epilogue 2. He led me into this whole new universe.
"Mine froend, thou habbe afre snotor, butan dysig in se leoht ping, eall for in lufu. Ha-ha.(My friend, you have always been wise, but fatuous and unresolved in this obvious thing, all because of the involvement. Ha-ha.)" Thor laughed, patted Steve on the shoulder.
“The doctor told me not to stay long. I'll come back to see you. I promise." Tony tried not to look too eager as he left the ward.
About 10 feet tall, Onslaught was clad in black and red armor, with only glowing red eyes visible from behind a black metal mask. It had no language, it had no sound, it was a monster that combined the dark mind with the chaotic energies of time and space. It was surrounded by heroes in the middle of Central Park. The two sides were so deadlocked.
"It doesn't have to be every day. After the main parts are repaired, time can heal some bits on its own."
Steve had that dream again. He was running in it. It's a similar scene, but it seemed a little different. This time his uniform was not torn, his shield was in his hand, and his heart was not frightened, but full of anger. There was a red figure in front of him. The red figure was not walking fast, as if to lead him forward. He was almost catching up with him by a hair's breadth. Steve began to see him clearly. It was a knight in red and gold armor.
Tony leaned on Victor's shoulders and tried to straighten up. His feet slowly regaining consciousness were like being pricked by countless needles.
Then the door of the room was flung open, a bright light came in, waking him from the nightmare. He rubbed his eyes, sat up half asleep. After about 30 seconds, his eyes adapted to the change in light, seeing the intruder.
But all these only in Peter's imagination, stayed in Peter's desire. He finally didn't do anything, because he clearly heard the name he murmured was not his name. At this time, any action he took will destroy his trust in him, will destroy everything they built up between them. So, Peter tried to suppress his lust. He curled up.
"I'll introduce you formally next time. What's even better is that she has a beautiful red-headed roommate, Melony, who is recently single. I asked her to introduce you so we can go on a double date. Forget Mary Jane. It's been a long time. It's time you moved on."
This is the second time Spider-man has been locked up in a cell at a secret Zodiac base. He was a little worried the last time, but this time he took it easy. He was lying on the bed in the cell, his hands crossed under his head, tapping his legs idly. A blade of grass in his mouth, he hummed a song.
In the Avengers family, Peter himself was a bit of a fish out of water. The idea of joining Avengers seems to have started out with a lot of enthusiasm from Tony, and then he announced it tonight in a very high-profile way. I never really think about whether I really want to join Avengers. I just didn't want to spoil his fun, so I obeyed him. But then Peter asked himself, do I really belong here?
Hopefully, after he destroyed the tower's perimeter defenses, the signal would pass through, or hope that Pete's spider sense won’t fail as well as his armor.
"Stark Enterprises... Ha-ha, my bad, it should be called Fujika Enterprises by now, and the Avengers, can't give you what you need?"
"Boys and girls, I know you love each other very much, but can you say the eternal love words quickly? You've heard the words of Cyclops. They won't last long. Again, this is not a parting, well, I hope not... Please hurry, thank you for your cooperation."
You lunatic, Tony, you lunatic." Steve said. When he leaned over, kissed Tony, he could taste himself in his mouth.
But something unexpected happened. When they arrived at the local police station, the chief of police came out, whispered a few words to the policeman escorting them. Surprise appeared on the policeman's face.
“My name is Annn... Oh, I mean, my middle name is so long, I have to think about it... James Buchanan Barnes?"
The morning meeting at the Avengers' mansion finally started on time. Tasha's brief introduction, each team's debriefing, and then Cap’s lengthy analysis and summary... Spiderman struggled to keep his eyes from falling asleep. Next to him, Iron Man was covered by a helmet, so no one could tell when he was asleep.
"Mr. Carbonell, there's a Mr. Krats at the door who wants to see you. He said he has an investment plan for your steel plant."
What difference does it make whether you move your things back or not? You are all right in my arms. Steve wasn't going to tell the truth to silly Tony.
"Wait a minute." Tasha thought again and called out to him. "You contact all the heroes who can come to New York right now. Gambit, you tell me the story again, don't omit any detail..."
"My armor's built-in communication system is broken now. Pay attention to the Quinjet, quickly switch to pure manual!"
At the dawn of the day, Peter, breathless as he ran, led the last group to the rendezvous. Tony flew over with the last of the wounded. By this time, the mudslide had already submerged the village of Dent.
What is the topic of that paper? Tony had completely forgotten about it. He added to the memo: Paper due by the end of the week, priority 5.
"Uh... That year he was set up by Stane. He took away his company. Avengers also have suffered setbacks. He had a problem with alcohol for a long time; He was drinking more and more after that. He was drunk in armor, almost causing a catastrophe. When I tracked him down, I tried to dissuade him. He talked about my father's alcoholism. I raged, hit him."
Steve was attracted by Tony most of the time. His combat effectiveness was significantly reduced. Without armor protection, relying only on the repulsors emitted by the gauntlets, Tony was a living target. Fortunately, he is flexible.
Spider-Man is near California beach. He should be able to provide backup. I have recently teamed up with him. He has proved to be a very reliable team-mate. I hope you will consider putting him on the official register. This is an opportunity." Tony fiddled with his watch to locate Spider-Man.
After finishing his message, Tony got dressed, put on his backpack, went downstairs, got into his sports car and headed for Dr. Octopus's lab.
Damn you, old man. Reflexes. He means training to his level. Tony had a picture in his head of Steve laughing and easily beating down Spymaster.
Remembering the day, Tony thought he would be a little embarrassed to see Tasha next time. He turned his attention back to the search for the missing members.
"That was your plan, wasn't it? I was the bait. After swinging for so long, have you shaved enough skin?"
"Did I beg you? If I remember correctly, before I went out, I made a point of telling you not to follow."
"Ah..." Tony blurted out the cries he had been suppressing. The implant in his chest flickered with the master's strong quiver.
Tony Stark had become Iron Man, and the sense of helplessness had gone. Tony was feeling like things were in control. Iron Man can handle this mess. It's just a little fire, isn't it? It's just a little fire...
"Save it, Doom. You're not fooling anyone. You don't mean to kill me. Whiplash, Spymaster, don't you have enough dogs sent to play with me? You are trying to get my attention and begging me to come along. Now I am here. Why are you bashful in the shadows like a little girl? Maybe I should leave." Tony made a gesture and turned away.
"We just didn't talk about it in depth, or had no time to think about it, or didn't want to define it. The life of a superhero is like this. Every time out of the task you don’t know if you can come back or not, don't know if today is the last day of your life, don't know if this is the last time we met... So we valued the present more. I didn't want these preciously established relationships to just fall apart."
"Well, the beginning is in Grand Canyon Libra’s thing. Hawkeye has already told you about that, right?" Tony said.
"That's it. Don't relax too much. It's a big favor, you'll have to pay it back someday." Bain smiled sweetly again. "You're the Iron Man. I know you're not going to default. Now, you can go."
Tony strode past the fallen Electro toward Steve. He walked over to Steve, took off his helmet. The spray instantly wet his hair.
Tony was taken into the bathroom. When the hot water from the sprinkler hit him, he began to feel groggy. In fact, the days that he didn't sleep were longer than the days without bathing. The only time he's had a shut-eye lately was in prison. But he didn't want to sleep yet. He put his hands around Steve's neck, felt his hands unwrap his clothes, brushed the exposed skin, set off the sweltering heat. The hissing pain of gashes on his arms intensified the feeling, bringing a tingling pleasure. So, Tony buried his head in Steve's neck, bit it, lightly and heavily.
In the corner, Steve was holding Tony for a slow dance. Before this dance, Tony danced three times with Jane, two times with Wanda and two times with Crystal. He even danced with Tasha once. Finally, Steve couldn't hold up, went to the DJ and asked him to play an old tune.
Steve didn't think it was that easy, but he knew he couldn't get the truth out of Tony now, so he stopped asking and joked:
No, he's back early. He thought of the shirt he dyed blue... His heart beat in a beat. I'm gonna get punished, and I'm gonna get Bucky involved.
"He and I don't have anything in common. If anything, it's wearing a uniform and beating up some bad guys." Tony's smile widened as he remembered those times.
Tony warily walked over to the device and ran the test. Libra is telling the truth. This device is used to adjust the magnetic chaos in this area.
As everyone watched, Vision flew toward Onslaught. He pierced through the shield, but as he was halfway through, the density of the shield changed. The Vision's body was cut in half. Half of his body was thrown out.
"You should hold on a little bit more, believe in yourself a little bit more, maybe next time it will be you leading the Avengers through." Tasha said.
As the hours grew later, almost all the chaperones sneaked away. Rarely enjoy only the two of them at the moment, Quicksilver and Crystal, but the last exit. They came to Peter.
"Very different. Because that universe was created temporarily by Franklin, it's not perfect, it's not stable, and a lot of what exists in our universe doesn't exist there. It's a compressed version of our universe, so time there is compressed as well. Time there moves much faster than it does in our universe. Maybe it's 1:10 or more. So our one day is equal to 10 days or more over there. We don't know how vast Franklin made of it. We have to wait for Hank's calculations. In the meantime, I have been entrusted by Dr. Richards with the care of Franklin." Said Charles, fondly touching the little boy who sat in his arms.
"I'm asking you and him, how did you come to light? For all I know, you are very good at concealment. He was very good at disguise."
Tony tapped at high speed. Lines of code were passing in front of him. Yes, he did. He left the back door. The armor designs also hide a secondary security code that automatically sends out a specific frequency signal once the data is off the mainframe. Just track that signal, I can find the missing designs.
"It's about Tony Stark. I need time, I need space, I need inspiration... I thought it might be a good idea to go to outer space."
"I'm not asking you that. I've already read this in the Avengers database. I want to know what the database doesn't have. How did you two get hooked up?" Tony cut to the chase this time.
"I've thought of that." Tony was a little dismayed at the answer. "But there has to be a space-time medium to transform that energy, and that medium has to be a primordial cosmic matter that transcends the existing multiverse. I think the earth will be destroyed before I can find the proper materials to make such a medium."
"Oh, your old ways! If it weren't for your old ways, we wouldn't be stranded on this island at all. Who confiscated my armor? Who confiscated my ID card? If I hadn’t left a piece of technology you dislike, we'd be cooked into Octopus soup by Dr. Octopus!"
One day Paige didn't show up. Steve waited until it was almost dark, but she still didn't show up. Finally, he walked back alone. The next day it was the same. And the third day. Steve knew she wasn't sick because he had seen her at school. She sat among her friends, and talked with them with smiles. On the fourth day, Paige showed up at the Magic Toy Shop.
“That means you don't know me well enough. I also thought the little genius only cried, 'Oh, I came into the future alone, no friends, no family, lonely me. boohoo....'"
Over the noise, Thor laughed and came forward. He stepped between them and put his arm round their shoulders.
There's no need for an agreement. I'll listen to everything he says at this point. At this time, I even have the urge to give everything in exchange for staying with him for a more moment.
Steve cried out in pain, but his look gave him away, and he laughed. Tony straddled him and leaned over to give him a long kiss. Then he parted from him at a distance and watched him squint at him, the tiny wrinkles at the corners of his eyes filled with unconcealed delight. It's been a long time since I left him, and there are so many things I want to tell him. Then Tony launched into a whimsical conversation.
Tony got in his flashy red sports car, bought a bunch of flowers, prepared to pick Kris up for the art exhibition. When he parked the car downstairs in Kris's dormitory, took off his sunglasses, it caused sighs and onlookers. Lots of girls walked up to his car and gave him their phone numbers.
"The will was all about people he thought he had a duty to take care of, and I wasn't. "Steve paused, then he changed the subject.
As a scientist, of course, he knew that shouting wasn't going to solve anything. It was just some human instinct that gave him an unconscious fear of the dark, and it seemed that shouting would dispel the fear.
"It seems you have been objecting to my plans, like to always be, like to be opposition for the sake of opposition."
At this point, Steve, who had been corona earlier, woke up. He opened his eyes to see Iron Man and smiled.
"Isn’t it logical that you want to get something from Starks in order to complete the contract?" Tony demanded.
Tony still couldn't sleep. He had forgotten the last time he slept soundly. So, he got up and sat down at Gatlin's little desk. He opened his wristwatch, put on his headphones, and listened to the messages inside. Every sleepless night recently he's been listening to it, once again making sure he's not missing any new messages.
So, Steve, suppressing the smile, made a gesture, reaching for Iron man with one hand. "Take me back to the castle, my knight."
"Wow, you're scared of me again. There's only one person I know who had it. It was Tony Stark. But he is dead. And I saw him. He is definitely not your age."
