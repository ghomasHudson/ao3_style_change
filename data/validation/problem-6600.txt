"No, I'm sorry Steve." Tony's hand moved, leaving his arm to run through his hair and Steve missed the warmth. "JARVIS is running through everything we can find, searching for keywords but it's not turning anything up."
He was met with a metal elbow in the face. The blow had him see white for a moment and he was pushed off, only to be met with punch after punch after punch to the face. His breath caught in his throat, his mind reeling as he found himself back in 2014
Steve's eyes narrowed in on the roomba in the corner of the room. It wasn't on but it was vibrating. It stopped. Then started again. Curious, he picked it up and turned it over, finding the part he could pry it open. Tony's phone hit the ground with a soft thud, showing that Bruce calling. Nat scooped it up and answered.
"He's alright. A little bruised here and there. There's no sign of the cold affecting him though so for being in Hydra's care, he's fine."
Concerned, Tony disabled his glove and set his phone down before he reached out to touch his shoulder gently, giving it a little shake. Steve's eyes snapped open at the contact and Tony flailed back into the coffee table when the soldier surged up, blue eyes wide and wild as he looked around the room.
They waited until the lights went out a few hours later. He waited for the first passing of the guards before stirring Loki into action.
He sucked in a breath and waited for Steve's speech to end. Steve was here. They were taking their plan into action now. This was it. He needed to act now. Once Steve's speech was over, he watched the guard fidget, like he didn't know what to do. The secret was out and no orders were coming in. Once he was sure the other wasn't paying attention, he struck. Jumping to his feet, he struck the guard in the back of his head and watched him crumple to the ground.
"Tony's right. We need you two to send us more files whenever; if ever you get the chance. You both have higher clearance than Steve so you can get more."
Steve chuckled as both of their calls ended and he picked up his phone. Camp Lehigh was a good place to arrive at after weeks of waiting. He could confront Zola tomorrow with less risk of being blown up this time and push them even closer to their desired result.
"He's in trouble." At this his voice wobbled and it was stupid. He was doing fine before. Sure he'd been scared but not once did he cry! He could tell Thor that too! He didn't cry and he was brave! But now it was cold and dark and he didn't know where he was and Tony, the nice man in the cell that made him escape was still back there and needed help. Why didn't he stay to help?
Tony pulled up his tablet and let out a soft hum. He didn't look at all surprised. Then he turned it towards Steve so he could see. "These AIM employees left shortly after the incident with the Mandarin. Notice where they all went?"
Steve blinked, shaking his head and blinking back the moisture in his eyes. He'd been so wrong about Tony before. The words he'd said to Stark on the helicarrier-- to Tony they were only months ago but to Steve they were years ago. Had he ever really even apologized for that?
Sam tried to make for the doors before they closed but his A.I. was faster and Tony watched it go up before a fist connected with his face and he fell over.
"Part of a long story and why we called you." Natasha started. The group of them filled him in on the situation with SHIELD and Hydra, the kidnapping of Tony and finally, the fact that someone had stolen the scepter.
Stepping around a holographic blueprint, he moved towards the telltale sound of Tony muttering under his breath as he worked and slowed to a stop. He thought, after being unprepared to see Natasha again, he would be more prepared to see Tony. On his short flight he brushed up on the news again, looked at pictures, steeled himself for this moment.
The time he chose was just shy of a year after the battle of New York. February 2013. He chose a cheap little motel to crash and make plans in and luckily hadn't been recognized when he checked in. He was certain that when his head hit the pillow, he was in that motel. Now though, standing in the bathroom of his little apartment, he realized what must have happened. The serum didn't age him. Not by much as far as he could tell but the body he was in was definitely ten years younger then the one he'd fallen asleep in. He could see it in his face, mostly, but he could feel it. His body wasn't as worn and tired. This one was still young and not yet hardened by what was to come. He must have...merged with his other self somehow. The Ancient One's work? Or perhaps the universe putting things in place all on it's own.
"Alright." Her jaw set, a small tic that let him know she was preparing herself to tell him bad news. "When Clint and I finished with Pierce, we went through the halls to help diffuse the fighting between SHIELD and HYDRA before coming to help you. Before we could get down there, the elevator opened with Wilson, Hill, a couple Hydra agents, you and Barnes. Tony wasn't with them. According to them, Rumlow grabbed him off the elevator and fired at them so Tony ordered JARVIS to bring up the elevator without him."
They listened in silence as the phone rang, staring at each other in the dark. Tony's fingers stilled, massaging his scalp gently even as the line connected.
and we both know it. How am I supposed to see if you're using it properly if I can't physically see them?"
Strucker stepped aside and Tony's eyes widened. There, strapped to the contraption that erased his memories, was Loki's scepter. Loki's
"Where's--" His head lolled a little and he tried to sit up only for Natasha to gently press him back into the bed.
Driving to New Jersey from DC was a good handful of hours and Steve was glad to drive it, keeping his mind occupied on the road while piping in here and there on the conversations Nat and Clint were having.
"No." There was the kind yet stern tone again and Steve was crouching down in front of him. "You've been very brave so far Loki but we'll take it from here alright? It'll be too dangerous for you. You've already done your job, now it's our turn to do ours."
His phone finished turning on. As it did, his driver cursed out loud about the 'idiot standing in the middle of the road' which caught his attention so he initially missed the warning Jarvis had on his screen in big letters that just said '
When he woke up from his first initial passing out, his hands were bound behind his back and his head was pounding. He was sitting in a chair but not bound to it and there weren't any guards in the room with him. He would find out later, that he was in a small office that belonged to someone in SHIELD. He'd gotten up and looked at the desk and laughed to himself when he saw the paper clips. He was able to turn himself around to grab it off the desk before Rumlow graced his presence. Every time he sassed, he got smacked but it kept Rumlow distracted enough not to pay attention to what he was hiding in his hands.
Clint and Natasha found their way to the kitchen and Steve slowly followed. They had plates made up for everyone and were picking spots to sit down when footsteps came down the hall and Tony's voice filtered in.
Steve caught up to Tony while he was getting settled on the guest bed. Laptop opened in front of him, Sam stepped out of the room to make sure Clint and Natasha weren't breaking any of his dishes. Steve watched as Tony rubbed his hands together and wiggled his fingers, ready to dive into the work ahead of him. Tony looked in his element, ready to conquer anything. The fact he was attacked earlier that day didn't seem to bother him all that much. He hated that he was going to damper that mood.
He was carted from the office early in the morning and dragged down to where the helicarriers were. He had to admit, they were impressive. Beautiful. He would have been proud to have been a part of that if they weren't going to be used to slaughter millions at a time. Then he was left on one of the helicarriers, in the main command room with one guard while Rumlow took off to do something dastardly.
Fury narrowed an eye and his gaze flicked between the two of them suspiciously. Tony met the gaze with unwavering confidence and a grin he knew was probably maddeningly annoying. There was a long silence, just Fury and Tony staring at each other before the Director of SHIELD finally clicked his tongue off the roof of his mouth.
To Tony's surprise, Steve, instead of just answering and thanking him for his wise help, leaned up and pressed chapped lips to his own. It was briefest, faintest of touches but it still made Tony's heart do flips in his chest and his brain to short circuit.
"What do you mean SHIELD's compromised? I'm pretty sure we would have noticed. Right Nat?" Clint was frowning and when his partner didn't answer, he looked at her. Natasha's attention was turned to the information laid out in front of them, both thoughtful and doubtful. "Nat?"
"Okay. Okay yeah. Hydra. We think it's Hydra." Tony jumped on the bandwagon, sending a quick look Steve's way before drawing the attention to himself. "They disappeared when Red Skull and Steve did. Shortly after, SHIELD was formed."
The boy rubbed at his cheeks and jaw, scooting back to his place at the wall with a quiet thank-you.
When Steve woke this time, he felt the familiar dull throb of pain. There was the steady sound of the heart monitor beeping somewhere off to the side that he was barely able to hear over the sound of Sam's music. This was all familiar. The pain. The music. Sam. The only difference was the scientist sitting off to Sam's side with a clipboard and the two spies sitting at his other side.
Steve nodded, fiddling around with the phone. It was brand new. Tony just replaced his old one hours ago when he lost it in the attack. For now he'd hold onto it just in case. He would hate for Tony to have to replace the phone twice in less than two days.
"Look. We have a plan. Can you just...promise that you won't alert Fury. I don't think he's a part of this but I also don't want him to go pushing the wrong buttons if he agrees with us. The less people that get dragged into this, the better."
"Then I'll draw their fire and you two take the other way in while they're distracted." Pressing a finger to his ear he waited for his com to connect. "Romanoff, Barton. How are things on your end?"
thing about them when I mentioned helping on new helicarriers. Have you heard what Project Insight is?"
"You're Steve right?" He asked, ignoring the others. "The man with the shield that stopped the hydra?"
The next morning Loki watched as they dragged the man out of his cell, off to do whatever it was they wanted. Before they closed it, they made Loki move, making him stay in the same cell as the man. He didn't mind. At least he wasn't alone anymore.
Tony reared his head back into Rumlow's face to throw off the mans aim, feeling him stagger back but instead of making a break for the elevator, he turned to slam into the bigger man like Steve had done to Bucky earlier.
"Night Natasha." Tony offered another smile as the line died and leaned back just a fraction. "See? What'd I tell you?"
The jet was similar to their flying transports on Asgard. The archer man carried him to the jet he mentioned and sat Loki down on a table. His hands stayed tight around Tony's watch and he refused to let it go, even as the archer draped a blanket over his shoulders and another man came over to look at him.
Steve's blood went cold and he slowed to a stop. Behind him, Rumlow came jogging up and both he and Tony shared a look before turning around. Tony, for all his genius quickly held the briefcase behind his back, holding the handle with both hands, looking quite respectful when the Strike team member caught up to them. The thumb drive was no where in sight.
In the three days since he's woken up, several things had happened. SHIELD was in the middle of clean up. They were dealing with the members of HYDRA in their ranks, figuring out the mess under the building and the media fall out. From what he heard from Natasha, they still had plenty of good, honest agents in their midst so they didn't lose too much after shining light on HYDRA. However, he did learn that in all of the confusion, Loki's scepter went missing.
"When Loki took the Tesseract and escaped that day, you know, when I went into mild cardiac arrest?"
"Well that could have gone worse." Tony chuckled, picking up the pace to catch up to Steve as he briskly walked down the hall. That part was done, now all they needed to do was get Tony to a computer so he could get JARVIS uploaded.
Getting his ass into gear, he took off into a run, dodging around the crowd that had formed and ducking into a nearby alley. He didn't need to turn around to know that the other was following him but he looked back anyways. Well that was a mistake. Because modern day terminator was on him in seconds with a speed he wasn't expecting. Metal fingers grabbed him by the throat and Tony choked out a gasp as he was slammed into the brick wall. His head bounced off the bricks and it left him seeing stars. He made a desperate grab at the metal arm pinning him to the wall and he wheezed when the fingers tightened.
" For a second he paused. How close to Siberia was Tony? Was it another base or the one he already knew of?
"Tony, I...Thank-you, again. For this. You didn't need to help me with this, or believe me at all but you did."
Steve got to his feet, heart thudding in his chest. Tony got out. Or was this a trap? He wouldn't put it past Hydra to use it against them; to lure them in when they figured out what it could do. He had hope though. Tony could get out of any situation if he put his mind to it.
SHIELD? Was anyone going to tell me this?" Clint asked bewildered, flailing his arms towards the pictures even as Steve and Natasha moved on. "Am I the only one who thinks this is sort of a big deal?"
"I'm...I'm sorry Steve. I know you don't want to hear it but I think...I think Hydra got to him some how but the silver lining is that he's alive. He's alive Steve and if we can get him away from their hold, we can help him."
The Hydra infiltrated SHIELD was funding organizations like AIM and The Ten Rings so it made sense to him now that SHIELD just wasn't given the right details. Knowing what he did now, he had to move forward to weed them out. This time, he was hoping to save what he could of SHIELD and get to Bucky as soon as he could. He had time. He knew when the tipping point would be. This time he could get help. Help he knew he wasn't owed but would go looking for.
"Tight lipped. Wouldn't give me anything to work with. I get the distinct feeling he didn't even know."
"New prototype for your gloves. Bigger charge." He beamed and when he caught Clint's pout, he reached over to pat the archers cheeks. "There's a gift for you too darling, don't worry. New quiver. The glove that goes with it can rotate the arrows and provide you with what you need based on how you move your fingers."
"Alright. Ya'll wanna explain what's going on? Cause, not that I'm not flattered getting a call to save Tony Stark from the terminator or anything but you didn't really explain anything about what was going on when we were on the phone Steve."
He slammed into the first Hydra agent before swinging his arm up and slamming the shield into another. Twisting, he kicked hard at a third and before the last of them could lift their gun again, Sam came swooping in with a hard kick of his own.
With a choked gasp, his hand shot out and he grabbed at Bucky's fist, staring up at surprised blue eyes.
"So those helicarriers can't afford to get off the ground. From the information we have, there is months to go before they're ready but getting rid of them as soon as possible is the best idea. Where are the helicarriers located?"
He had enough time to look down at his phone before a loud bang launched the car in the air. Tony was jostled as the car flipped twice and he found himself upside down when it finally stopped. His head was spinning and there was a ringing in his ears, making everything muffled. There was screaming? He was vaguely aware of the muffled groan coming from the driver which meant the man was alive, thankfully. That also meant he had to get the hell away from the car if he wanted his driver to remain alive.
because of Steve pride-of-America Rogers. Thinking about being all tucked up and cuddly with the bigger blond made him feel like a teenager with a crush; giddy, flushed and giggly.
"Attention, all SHIELD agents. This is Steve Rogers. A lot of you may know me as Captain America and I've been working here along side you for several months. I think it's time you know the truth though. I've been here undercover, working with my team. SHIELD is not what we thought it was, it's been taken over by Hydra. Alexander Pierce is their leader. The Strike team is Hydra as well. I don't know how many more, but I know they're in the building and we plan on putting an end to this. I request that those of you who are SHIELD, honest and true, get out of the building as soon as you can. We don't want casualties we can prevent. For Strike and those of you who are Hydra, we are coming and we won't stop until this is over."
" Natasha's voice came through and the genius could feel the tension leave Steve's body. She sounded alive. Groggy and pissed, but alive.
There was just one person missing right now and Tony's absence now just reminded him of a future where Iron Man had saved the universe but wasn't given the chance to see it. He didn't like that future.
"Correct. When our original plans failed and humanity failed to surrender it's freedom, I was recruited into SHIELD after it was founded. From there, Hydra grew, secretly feeding crisis, reaping war. And when history did not cooperate, history was changed."
Tony fixed him with a little frown before tentatively nodding. He shot a look towards to Bucky before running towards the elevator behind him. He kept running even when Bucky moved to grab him but Steve was there, slamming into him bodily before he could even touch the billionaire.
"Wouldn't it be beneficial to provide for everyone on a larger scale? You could provide all of SHIELD with the most advanced weapons this world has ever seen, instead of repulsor tech that you purposely left vital information out of so we can't weaponize it like you do."
Steve let out a shaky sigh, tapping his forehead against the phone. Tony sounded manic. The tone was that of someone who was scared but still in control. He managed to leave a message and hide the phone before he was taken. It was like Natasha said. He was Tony Stark. He'd be okay.
The car veered violently and Barnes was thrown off after Sam's second try. The last Tony saw of him, he was getting back up in the middle of the road and then Sam turned the corner.
He hoped that where ever the scepter was, Tony was with it because there was still no word on where he was. In three days they could have gotten anywhere in the confusion and there was no surveillance that captured what happened leaving them completely in the dark on where to begin.
He wanted to laugh. He really just wanted to laugh. They wanted an Iron Man suit? Of course they did. Why wouldn't they. It was Hammer, all over again, and the government. Well no. The government officials that had been trying to get their grummy mitts on his armor were Hydra so he was just making circles. He wanted to tell the man to stick it. He wasn't going to make them a suit but--
Loki let out a shaky sigh at that. This man Tony was sure would save them, thought Tony was strong. That meant Tony would be okay, right?
Tony fixed him with a small, gentle smile, pausing as he packed his things. There was a moment of hesitation before he sat back down next to Steve.
"Oh Tony." Steve let out a sigh, rubbing at his face. He couldn't look at those brown eyes, wide and honest and so caring. Rip it off like a band aid. "Hydra killed your parents."
Still nothing and Steve sighed, moving into an empty chair next to the bed, easing himself down slowly. Crossing his arms, he chose this time to think.
"Sam, unlike the rest of you heathens, understands the importance of having a good relationship with his technology. Dot is his roomba and she's a good little bot. Just tried to clean up something she couldn't handle. I fixed her over as a thank-you."
taking no for an answer. When Loki took off and I came to? He gave a lot of threats, none that I took to heart and neither did Thor but there was something about him... It didn't sit well with me. And have you seen that strike force? Red flags." Steve watched Tony rub at his chest, probably out of habit before he shook his head. "It isn't just that either. The weapons on the helicarrier? The--the fact that I didn't even get a call when this was going down? The president was at risk and they didn't even bat an eye at it. Why?"
"Steve?" Natasha stepped into the room cautiously. "It looks like they grabbed him from the back yard when he made a run for it. Other than that we haven't found anything. Are you okay?"
"I'm okay." He reassured quietly and when Steve tilted his head up to look at him, he enforced it with the softest smile he could muster. Suddenly the world seemed quieter, Steve's eyes seemed so much brighter and something just
scepter. How the hell did they get that? It was in SHIELD's custody wasn't it? What had happened after he was grabbed?
"It's a joke, from a Batman-- never mind. In the movie he's listening in to phones and whatnot to find the bad guy. I'm not doing that but I am having JARVIS keep an eye on our list. If any of them tweet, text, email or call with that word, he'll notify us."
Special thanks to Hostbusters, deadgloves, roseandthorns28, pxrplegrxpe, Larrys_Consulting_Avenger and the_writer1988 for all of your comments! You are wonderful!
Speaking of the All America hero, Tony pulled his phone out to turn it back on. He wanted to give those kids all of his attention with no distraction and maybe ignore all other responsibilities for a couple of hours so he turned it off. Now he was curious though. What had the others found out? Was there anything even at the location Jarvis dug out? Thinking about it now, turning his phone off was probably into the smartest idea. What if something happened to them and they tried to get a hold of him?
"So this was where you came from Cap?" Clint asked once they were through the fence and wandering the compound. Nat and Clint were prepared to split up but Steve knew where he was going and wasn't planning to wait for them to figure it out on their own so he took charge, briskly walking past the buildings.
"Something I was really hoping against Rumlow! You're really not my type." He launched himself across the living room and into the kitchen, sliding across the floor to the back door. He pulled it open quickly and ducked into the backyard. He knew he didn't have a chance. Rumlow was at the front door which left Barnes in the back and he barely took five steps before he was grabbed.
for the man but anger and hate for what he did to his parents but he didn't. He felt sad. He felt pity. Steve shouldn't have been forced into the position he was in right now. He shouldn't be fighting his best friend. What if that had been Rhodey? His chest constricted at the thought. Sure they fought, once on a large scale where he lost a suit but this? Steve would try his damnedest to stop Bucky, not caring about the shape he'd be in at the end of it. He'd die before he killed Bucky or let him be taken by Hydra again. He knew this because he would do the same for his closest friends.
"Rumlow." He nodded once, politely. Once, he'd thought the man a comrade. Not quite a friend but not far off. They ran ops together, had each others back and in the end Rumlow had turned on him without hesitation. The man was a good actor.
And he took the mouth thing off. His jaw hurt from being stuck that way for so long and he rubbed at his face. He was letting Loki call him Tony even though he said his friends called him that and he shared his food. Loki liked this man even if he did lie about being friends with Thor. Thor was only a little older than Loki was. He wasn't friends with this man. But Loki liked having a friend. He didn't have many friends back home. He had Thor but Thor had always been the more like able one. He ran his mouth, talked back to others. That didn't make friends.
"So--" Sam and Natasha joined him a little while later, Nat dropping a duffel bag of his things with his shield in the corner of the room. "--How'd your talk with Fury go?"
"If what you're saying is true, there are a few things I need to make sure are secure." Clint didn't specify but it was another secret Steve was already in the know about. His family. The little family on the farm waiting for him to come home. Of course he had to make sure they were going to be safe. "After that, I'll be back in DC to work with you."
The thumb drive itself was plugged into Tony's laptop, the files on screen being flicked through at an inhuman pace while JARVIS sorted through it all.
When the door dinged open, he impatiently smacked his fingers on the closed buttons and ordered the elevator to bring him back down to the helicarriers. He waited for the elevator to deny him access but was relieved when the soft, caring voice of his A.I. came through the intercom.
Steve was still chuckling when JARVIS stopped the elevator on the workshop floor. Stepping out into the expansive room, he realized that the workshop wasn't a floor he'd ever really visited before. The labs he remembered. The communal floor. The floor with all of their rooms on it. The training room, the gyms. He remembered all those but the workshop he never bothered to come see. Tony always brought his upgrades to him, never the other way around. He pictured something more chaotic, messy, like in the movies but Tony's workshop was surprisingly neat with the exception of a couple desks where he had parts strewn all over.
Rumlow's attention turned to Tony, like he just noticed the billionaire standing there. There was a shift in his attitude, minuscule change of tension. If he hadn't been looking for it, Steve wouldn't have even noticed. He felt a sudden protective urge, wanting to step in between Rumlow and Tony because he knew what this man was. There was something off, something else, but he couldn't pinpoint what it was. Tony though, didn't seem bothered. The genius was wearing his best for-the-camera smile as he extended a hand.
A shot rang out and they both froze. At first Tony looked down at himself on instinct, to make sure he hadn't been shot before looking at Sam. He seemed fine which meant--
"We're going to get him back Steve." It was Clint, new glove on his hand with the new quiver he remembered Tony talking about a couple days ago. It looked good and knowing Tony, he put a lot of thought behind it. He remembered Clint's advanced one, that Tony would make in a couple years. "No man left behind right?"
A fight here wouldn't benefit either of them though, no matter how much Steve wanted to punch Rumlow in the face. Instead he brought a hand up to gently press at Tony's lower back, reminding him that he wasn't there alone.
"It'll be easier for both of us, okay? Whatever you were dreaming of had you pretty freaked out and that freaks me out. This way, you'll know I'm alright and I'll know you're getting some decent sleep in."
"It's exactly that." He let his legs dangle over the edge, hands resting against the mattress as he met Fury's stare. He had plenty of time to think this over in the last few days and even started getting work on his new plans.
"It's this building right here." Steve nodded to the building off to the side. The one he was making a single minded trek to. It was deja vu upon deja vu and Steve was getting that unsettling disoriented feeling from last night again. He made this walk with Natasha. He made this walk with Tony and now he was making this walk with Natasha and Clint.
Since it was the middle of the work day and Hydra's entire spiel was working covertly from the shadows, things at SHIELD were business as usual. Fury drove in with Natasha and Clint and their job would be underway as soon as they got there. Steve went with Hill and Sam through the same back way that they went in the first timeline so Steve was already acquainted with it.
"Tony." Steve cut in, giving him a pointed look; reminding him that they weren't here to argue. Part of the plan was to get turned away so they could go snooping without worrying about Fury looking for him in the building. As long as he thought Tony was on his way out of the building, he wouldn't bother them.
"Tony." He hadn't taken his eyes off Bucky who had stopped walking a few feet in front of them. It wasn't until Tony gave Steve his attention that he looked away, digging into one of his belt pouches. He reached out and took Tony's hand, slipping his watch over his wrist.
"Where am I? What year is it--- T-Tony?" That look was back on his face. Tony remembered seeing it months ago, when Steve first showed up in his workshop asking for his help. He was looking at Tony like he was surprised he was alive, like he was awed by his presence here or was looking at a ghost. Sometimes he wore the same expression when looking at Natasha.
The images were still unsettling. Scenes of himself in the war, the founding images of Peggy and Howard when they first started SHIELD, Red Skull, Hydra. Natasha and Clint were seeing it for the first time. This here was everything they knew and believed in falling apart around them.
He was scooped up  and held close by another pair of arms. An archer? They had an archer! It was a team of warriors! Like in the stories Thor loved to listen to! He couldn't wait to tell his brother all about this!
Fury was losing his patience so Steve decided that he would give it a try. He himself was feeling better. The state his face had been cleared up and the gun shot wounds were more achy then they were painful. He'd be completely fine by the end of week.
They let themselves into the security control room and was met with no resistance because this time around, he wasn't branded an enemy of SHIELD. This time, he was still on friendly terms with a lot of the staff there. Those he knew weren't Hydra. He sent the employees working out, telling them to get away from the building as quickly as possible. He wasn't expecting explosions like the last time but he was expecting a lot of fighting. He didn't want anyone who wasn't involved caught in the crossfire.
Honestly the thought had slipped his mind. When the guard was on his mouth, he assumed these people took the necessary actions to keep him from doing any magic. Not that he knew much. He'd gotten as far as shape shifting. He could turn into things and his illusions were getting better. His mother was proud of how quickly he was learning. He liked how proud his mother looked and he wanted Tony to give him the same look.
"Alright. We're going in blind without much information. We'll hit hard, we'll hit fast. We know Tony's still inside so our mission is to get him out. Once we find him, we extract and we leave. We can take care of the ones in charge after we know he's alright."
The entire drive to Sam's house was stressful and when they arrived, he immediately went looking for Tony.
He stumbled after a little while, starting to feel tired, but he had to keep going. There was nothing but an expanse of snow but off in the distance, he could see trees. Trees would give him cover if they started to look for him.
"Tony gave it to me." He sniffled a little, sparing a glance back the way he'd came. Had they figured out he was gone now? Was Tony okay? He knew the man was taking a risk letting him escape. "He told me to get out and run until someone found me. Are you Steve? He said Steve would find me."
"You need to try. You need to succeed. That watch can get us help if you can get us out of here. After lights out, turn into something that can get through those bars, find a way out and just
Sam seemed to be taking the information given pretty well. He asked questions when he needed to know more and nodded in understanding.
He found himself met by the deadest pair of blue eyes watching him from the other side. There was no life to them and Tony's heart jumped into his throat at being caught. His brain was a little fuzzy but he was quickly putting together that the information they had on this man and the man they were looking for, Sergeant Barnes were of the same person. Then it clicked. He really shouldn't be standing there.
Tony jerked awake from the sleep he was in. Blinking sleep out of his eyes, he sat up and looked around in the dark. The digital alarm clock Steve had on the nightstand told him it was just after three in the morning and he rubbed a hand over his face. What pulled him out of his sleep? He was nightmare free and before he'd gone to bed, he'd actually felt a little exhausted. This should have a been an eight hour uninterrupted sleep sort of night.
"Check those screens over there. Let me know if anything happens. I'm erasing all of their operating systems and--"
The next room they found themselves in was just as eerie and dark as Steve remembered it to be until the lights came up on their own. Clint's guard was now up, bow in hand, arrow notched just in case and Natasha stepped forward towards the old computers curiously. Even knowing what he did and what was coming, Steve couldn't shake that feeling in the pit of his stomach like something was bad or wrong here. Nothing seemed out of place, nothing was different so why couldn't he shake the feeling?
Steve felt like a bucket of cold water had been poured over his head and he suddenly had a hard time breathing. Bucky was called in. Bucky was called in to get Tony. Dead or alive? Zola did say they wanted Tony but were willing to cut their losses if he died. This wasn't right. This wasn't how this was supposed to play out. They were here, hours away and Tony was...god forty minutes? He could be dead already.
Then there was a thump in the other room and Tony froze. That must have been why. Was someone here? Was Steve and his paranoia right? If someone was willing to break into Captain America's apartment he would accept the fact he was paying for a hotel room he wasn't even using and not complain about it in the morning.
He could use this to his advantage. If they let him near tech, he could do something to get them help. To get Steve word where he was or to make something to get them out of there. As long as he could get his hands on something he could build, they had a chance.
"Did you really think I wouldn't notice him peeking around our systems after the last time? I knew after the first few times. Since then I've been given him ins and he caught on. I've been giving him hints on what to look for, for months now. He just decided to clue me into why he was sniffing around our secret systems recently."
"That isn't Tony's style. He helps those that need it and looks past the things they've done. Once we find him, you can talk to him yourself about it. You're coming with us when we go back to New York tomorrow"
Steve turned his attention to the two spies occupying the couch and they both gave him a nonchalant shrug.
Slowly, tentatively, the boy nodded, tousled hair bouncing with the movement. He watched Tony warily before he scooted a little closer. Tony in turn, carefully moved his hands to the device. He remembered Thor showing it to him before after he slapped it on his brothers face. Turning it on and off with a laugh because he knew it would annoy Loki. At the time Tony thought it was funny but he was glad the Asguardian had showed him. How did Hydra get a piece of Asguardian tech in the first place?
Cradling the watch up in his hands, he curled up in the snow. The yells were louder. The men were closer and he could hear the pounding of their footsteps in the snow. Then they fired. They fired over and over and over but...not at him?
He hadn't even closed the door when Sam pulled away from the curb, peeling out into traffic without hesitation. Tony sat up and turned into his seat to look back. For a moment, he felt relief. The would be assassin was no where to be seen until he was suddenly dropping onto the trunk of the car.
Sam was getting the upper-hand on Rumlow but Tony, being Tony, had to butt in. He used the high frequency setting he'd used on Barnes before to disorient Rumlow, letting Sam get that last punch to send him to the ground.
Tony eyed him from his over his coffee, his expression thoughtful; critical. After Steve's initial plea and explanation they moved up into the communal kitchen where Tony made them both a coffee. It wasn't until after they were seated and drinking that Tony started grilling him on the subject. Sipping his own coffee, he waited for Tony's next question.
At the others insistence, he sat up, wrapping the blanket around his smaller form. The mans eyes went wide, not expecting a child and it looked like he wanted to say something when another man; the man in charge came forward. This man Loki hadn't seen very much of. Maybe once or twice. The bald man seemed to know this new prisoner and the muscle-y guy next to him seemed to as well. He was scarier then the bald one. He looked like he was enjoying himself, especially as he held his weapon and pointed it at him.
"Cap?" The wide look turned into a frown and he stopped what he was doing to face Steve fully. "I thought JARVIS was kidding when he said you were in the elevator. Imagine my surprise."
He pressed a hand to Steve's wound when Sam ran over, his expression probably mirroring his own. When he looked back down at Steve, his eyes were closed.
But when Tony stopped working, sitting up a little straighter before turning to look at him, Steve was floored again. His surgery was just over a month ago and from what he'd read, it was a difficult and long procedure. Tony showed no signs of having been in surgery. He looked in good health, if a little tired no doubt from working himself too hard.
"Yes." Steve's expression became serious. His eyes were bright and clear and Loki could see no lie in them.
me told me something. When I was fighting him for the scepter. I nearly had him but what he said made me lose my hold."
"We have reason to suspect that SHIELD is compromised. Tony's been helping me comb through everything we can get our hands on."
Steve's fingers paused, tapping thoughtfully on the star in the center. Right. He let himself get distracted. He was here for a reason. Sucking in a breath, he turned to face Tony fully. His expression hardened and his smile faded. A slight tug of guilt settled in his stomach knowing he had to ruin the small moment they just had.
"Sam's just offered his services." Nat mused, passing him the folder. "Looks like he's handing in his resume to be an Avenger."
Nat made a grabbing motion for it and Steve passed her the little Iron Man head. She clicked her tongue off the roof of her mouth and slid it into one of the empty slots. "Might as well get what we can for Stark right? JARVIS can download whatever is on this old thing in minutes."
The team had managed to collect the infinity stones. He remembered Hulk's first snap, the battle that ensued, the pain and struggle and the sheer joy he felt when everyone came through in the end. He remembered wielding Mjolnir to fight Thanos alongside Thor. He remembered Banners snap. The second snap that wasn't Thanos but instead Tony. He remembered Peters and Peppers goodbyes before Iron Man took his last breath. Then there was the clean-up, the catching up, the funerals, the world trying to patch itself up back together after a five year return of everyone who had disappeared. He remembered his last mission; to return the stones back to their places in time.
"Tony, we don't...It's okay." Even as he protested, Tony was tugging him to his feet and toward the hall. Steve's protests weren't going to stop him. He's made the decision for him already.
The last thing he remembered was lunch with mother and Thor. Father was too busy to join them but they always saw him for dinner so it wasn't much of a loss. He was supposed to have more lessons with his mother after lunch but he'd been feeling tired after a morning running after Thor. Thor was far more energetic than he was but he did always try to keep up. He was going to have a nap and then have lessons with his mother but now he was here.
He repeated it to himself several times, wanting to remember that much at least because to him, those were the important bits. The most important bits, actually.
"That's not for me to say but there's a big blond with a heart of gold that wouldn't forgive me if I left you down here. Don't care if you believe it or not, he does so shut up."
Sitting up, he looked around. It was...well pretty bare. Three of the walls were smooth metal, with a room off to the side and no windows. It looked like a bathroom with a simple toilet, sink and a shower head were in the little room so that wasn't entirely bad. The last wall was a series of metal bars and outside he could see a similar type of cell across the hall. There wasn't even a bed. He got a pillow at least but one blanket which meant he got to sleep on a cold metal floor.
There was a bit of movement and he let out a relieved sigh. He wasn't sure he could get through this alone. He wouldn't have lasted in Afghanistan if it wasn't for Yinsin. The other prisoner moved and sat up, wrapping a blanket around their small form and Tony's heart stopped. It was a child. Just a kid. Probably no more than ten years old. The clothes he was in were ratty and torn, dark hair tousled with sleep. He looked pale from where Tony sat. It looked like they had some sort of device strapped to his mouth to keep him from talking. It was metal, blocky in the front and extended over his chin and across his jaw.
"Hey, kid." He offered but the boy stayed in his corner. Tony let out a little sigh and gestured to his mouth. "That thing, must be pretty annoying to have it in all the time huh?" How were they even feeding this kid?
Stepping into the elevator next to her, he let out a stiff sigh and shouldered his bag. Still staring at him, her attention turned to the bag.
Waking up that morning had been a little disappointing. He was so comfortable that he didn't even feel Steve leave the bed let alone the apartment and wasn't that just incredible? Him,
"Are you doubting something of Starks? If JARVIS says something is here, somethings here. We just have to figure out where it is."
Took me a little longer to get this up but here we are. One more chapter left for this part and I already have the second part mostly planned out so woo! Ready to go!
"The little bits of information you guys are sending us is just fine and dandy but I can get more done if I can get into the system myself. If I can directly link JARVIS to one of the computers, he can get what we need in minutes."
He was caught off guard by Bucky's other fist connecting with his jaw and he used all his weight to roll them over. He didn't like doing it but he finally started punching back, hard enough to at least daze him.
"I wanted to come see how my repulsor technology is being used. I figured that if I called, you'd grunt, say it was working fine and hang up on me."
"You're not asking. I'm offering. It's you guys against an entire organisation. From the way I see it, you can use all the help you can get."
"Hydra has him Bruce. They were here not even an hour ago. Can you send me those files? I'll call you back in a couple minutes."
Tony groaned as he slowly came back to the world of the living. His mouth felt dry and thick like he'd eaten cotton and his head was pounding. He would have chalked it up to a hangover if he was still drinking like he was a couple years prior but it wasn't that. He knew enough from being in and out of it the past few days, that he was drugged after Rumlow carted him out of SHIELD's headquarters. His face was sore, his back hurt. He was getting too old to be tossed around like a sack of potatoes. Looking down at himself he made a face. He was still in the clothes, minus one watch, that he was wearing back at Wilson's when Rumlow first took him. He probably smelled. This was just
"Fury wants to talk to you." He stepped into the room and he gestured towards the door. "Sounded pretty urgent. I'll be on babysitting duty while you're talking."
Tony a heart attack with Scott's help, Loki took the Teserract and booked it. So far they'd had zero word on where he was. That was something that shouldn't have happened and he wondered briefly, how that would play into this new future.
"I am not a recording. I may not be the man I was when the captain took me prisoner in 1945 but I am." The image to the side flickered to life and Steve stared in disgust at the little weasel shown there.
"Not dead Captain. Merely advanced. I received a terminal diagnosis in 1972 and while my body could not be saved, my mind could. I survive in two hundred thousand feet of data banks."
"Must be nice--" Rumlow cut in and honestly, Steve had forgotten he was even there. The Hydra agent was talking to Steve but was eyeing Tony again and this time the look was even more unsettling. He could feel Tony shift next to him, his fight or flight instinct kicking in. "--having someone make all your high tech toys for you."
"No." Tony grunted as he pulled him into the elevator, carefully dropping him to the floor. He let out a little breathless laugh, letting himself stumble back by the doors when he stood back up. Words that had been spoken to him years ago echoed back to him and he felt, in similar context that they would work well here.
"My name is Anthony Edward Stark. My friends call me Tony. My mothers name is Maria. My fathers name is Howard. I have people who care about me. Pepper. Rhodey. Happy. Steve. Natasha. Clint. Bruce. Thor. Sam. Fury. Harley. I am Iron Man."
"We're going to start hitting Hydra bases after we get settled in the tower, starting with any here in the states. We don't think they'd risk taking him out of the country yet, not with everything out in the open and every one on edge. Once you get agents cleared, we'll be happy to have any back up you might want to provide."
Pursing his lips together, Steve could see the determination in Bucky's eyes. He wasn't afraid to face those who had harmed him. He wanted revenge. He wanted to something as much as Steve did. They fought Hydra together in the war and they could fight it together now. He couldn't deprive him of this.
Steve slowly nodded. There were two sets of memories for that day. The events as he knew them and the events they caused by a mild hiccup in plans. When his Tony had given
"I'm going to keep him distracted. Take this. Get to the elevator and get out of here. Clint and Natasha are upstairs dealing with Pierce."
Her gaze was piercing. Thoughtful. Like she knew he was lying but couldn't figure out why he would. It was a look he found himself missing. Then she let out a soft laugh and shook her head.
He was in the living room, papers spread out with their notes when Tony brought the other up. He was quick to shake the mans hand and exchange pleasantries as if he hadn't seen him in a while.
There was a screen that popped up in front of the group and Loki watched the path he took from the building that was shown on the screen. Steve stared at it intently.
"It's where I trained for the military before I took the serum. It looks like they turned it into a SHIELD base."
Running up to a tree, he jumped and turned into squirrel, Tony's watch clutched in his mouth. He darted up the trunk and ran along a thin branch, hopping from that tree to another and kept moving along the branches until he couldn't hold the form any longer. He dropped back down to the snow and started running again. Once the men figured it out, if they ever did, he would be a little farther. He hoped it was enough to help.
"Kinda nice. Mind if I call you Steve? Only fair." And there was that all too familiar smile, where Tony's lips pulled up more to one side with an uncertain glint to his eyes.
Ending the recording, he grabbed the roomba he had been fixing earlier and pried it open to stick the phone in before setting it back down. Then he hid Sam's laptop just in case between the mattress before slipping out into the hall. By the time he'd made it to the living room, Rumlow was breaking through the front door.
He needed Tony. He needed Nat and Clint. Bruce if he was available and of course Sam. Thor, in the original timeline should have been off world but with Loki's escape, he was probably looking for his wayward brother. He needed what he could of his original team.
"I made this watch....I made it...defensive. It's to protect me." He frowned, squinting at it. "It should track me. Why isn't tracking me? They must have something jamming it. If I can get it outside--"
The Ancient One didn't seem at all surprised by his appearance on the rooftop. She appeared to have just been waiting, whether for Bruce or not, he didn't know and she didn't say but she did take the stone back with the barest hint of a smile. That should have been the end of it. He was done, he returned the stones to where he needed to. All that was left was to go home.
Steve stepped past the two of them and walked down the row of desks. It was easy to remember the rows of people here, diligently working at their desks as he and Tony slipped by them without notice. Now it was dusty, old and rundown, left to rot after SHIELD moved to bigger and better things.
Huh. Steve hadn't thought about it that way. He and Tony did have that in common, didn't they? It put things into perspective, back during the Accords. Would Tony have done the same thing he did if it were Rhodes put in Bucky's position? And seeing Bucky fall like Rhodey had, would he have been as kind as Tony to come and help in Siberia? He would have been devastated, angry and betrayed. In all honesty, Tony might have been a better man than he was.
"Remember kid. Get out. Keep running. Don't stop until they find you okay. Captain America, Steve. He'll find you."
The few days they'd been there, Bucky was making strides. Steve himself hadn't done much other than be a comforting presence when he needed it. Bucky had the world at his fingertips there at the tower so he left him to his own devices. He let Bucky read about Steve and himself and the world he'd once been a part of. Anything else he had questions about Steve tried his best to answer or Bruce tried to help him.
That earned a laugh and Sam nodded to Clint. "Yeah, go ahead and make a plate. I'll go get Stark and ya'll can explain what's going on."
"Yeah I know. Don't think there's anyone who doesn't know who you are Stark." The hand shake was one of the stiffest things Steve had ever seen and Tony quickly resumed holding the briefcase behind him. Rumlow's attention turned to that for the briefest of moments. "What sort of business?"
He ran back, dragging two more unconscious bodies into the elevator, sitting them up against the wall.
This went on for a few days and on day four of Steve being there, Bruce returned from his trip. He remembered that after the Battle of New York, Bruce left to both lay low from the prying eyes of General Ross (a guess) and to get a little piece of mind after letting the big guy out. Tony was kind enough to extend an invitation to the scientist to stay in the tower because where else would he be safe in the city? JARVIS ran the tower and no one could get past the AI.
' What was he supposed to do? Barnes was being controlled. He knew he was. The stories he heard about the man, he wouldn't have done something like that. It was all Hydra. He wouldn't place the blame on another one of Hydra's victims. They would get Barnes back for Steve and then help him fight against Hydra.
Where did he start? Did he choose to stay here? In 2012? The team was just formed. The battle of New York bringing them together only for them to barely speak to each other for another two years. Perhaps he jumped later, to Ultron or the Accords but it might be too late to stop either if he chose wrong. He had to prioritize. Now was just a little too early but he did have an idea in mind.
"I'm sorry. About what I said. When we first met. You're a good man Tony, better than anyone I know."
"It's fine Tony. I promise." Steve got up, ushering Tony down the hall to where his little room was. He helped get him set up with the shower and found some clothes that would relatively fit him for the night before letting Tony get settled. He lied out on the couch as best as he could, tucking his arms against his chest. He'd be sore in the morning but it was worth it for the peace of mind; knowing that Tony was safe in the next room.
It was almost a month now that he'd been in DC. Now April, it was thankfully warmer and Steve was falling into his old patterns. Running in the mornings lead to him meeting Sam again. This time he spent more mornings racing him, showing him up and chatting with him, grabbing bites to eat when time permitted. He asked about things he already knew the answers to but needed to hear all over again to keep the role of 2013 him up. Like before, talking to Sam was easy. He was easy to get along with. Always had been. After the first fall of Hydra, Sam had been a constant and having him in his life again, no matter how repetitive, helped him breath a little easier.
Steve shrugged his shoulders, looking through the hospital door window at Bucky who was lying in the hospital bed motionless. Like Steve's own serum, it let him heal quickly and he hadn't been as injured in the fight as Steve was so he was already in near perfect health. He could have broken out of there anytime in the last three days but he hadn't. Hadn't tried. Hadn't threatened it. He hadn't done
Clint patted the empty spot next to him, passing him a bag of food when he sank his entire weight into the couch. He took the bag without question and started eating.
It was almost frustrating that Steve had to play this safe. That he had to sit through all of this information and play at not really knowing anything when he in fact, knew everything. Part of him wished he could just say it; list everything that was wrong and who was Hydra. He didn't want to sit here and waste time. The only saving grace was that since he did remember everything from before, he could make it quicker by picking everything that was suspicious and weed out everything that was safe so they didn't waste time on unnecessary things.
Ducking off to the side, he let himself through the door, the other two following close behind. His eyes flicked to the photo's of Peggy and Howard, hung up proudly on the wall once you walk in and he felt his heart squeeze in his chest looking at the faces of old friends.
"I think Hydra's asset, the Winter Soldier? I think he's your friend. The-the one you told me about. Sergeant Barnes."
That earned him a snort from all parties and the rest of the meal was filled with pleasant conversation, light jokes and laughter.
"Who do I talk to about the accommodations?" He asked, scooting back to sit against the one wall. "This is probably the worst place I've ever stayed in and you wouldn't
"How do you think we're going to get you inside one of the biggest, most secure buildings in DC without anyone noticing?"
So here he sat. The guard wasn't paying him any mind so he was able to fiddle with the paper clip and use it to pick the cuffs. Very slowly, he freed his hands, keeping his movement minimal so it wouldn't catch the guards attention. He pressed the cuffs together, gripping it in his fist, over his knuckles like brass knuckles. He was trying to brace himself for attacking the armed guard; put himself back in that state of mind from Christmas when he was suit-less and on his own when Steve's voice broke over the PA.
"Good night Tony" He heard Steve whisper. Feather light and sweet, he was sure he felt lips pressed to his forehead.
"He said that Bucky was still alive." Tony's eyebrows went up but Steve trucked on before Tony could dismiss the idea. He knew that Bucky was still alive but the Steve that was supposed to be there wouldn't have known with absolute certainty. He had to sell this. "I know I know. It was probably just Loki pretending to be me but how would he have known Tony? Buck was my best friend growing up, my best friend in the war and I
Tony visibly deflated and raised his hands in defeat before getting up and grabbing his briefcase. Steve walked out of the room first, missing Tony reaching out to shake Fury's hand and Fury in turn, slipping a piece of paper into the mechanics before they parted ways.
A little over a week in, Natasha and Clint were sent to come and get him. Apparently Fury was tired of waiting for Steve to come back and angry about him not returning his calls. At least that was what he was getting from Nat's messages.
"Impossible." Clint breathed out. "SHIELD would have stopped you. Starks dad wouldn't have let this happen."
Then the third day came and like normal, he watched Tony get taken from the cell and returned later in the day. Tony couldn't remember his mantra anymore but that was alright. Loki remembered it and he helped Tony remember. Then the fear was gone and there was this brightness to his eyes. He remembered something important and slipped a watch over Loki's wrist.
Steve shared a look with Tony and Bruce before regarding Natasha and Clint. "We're supposed to be a team. That was Fury's intention. I want us to handle this as a team. Separate from SHIELD or the government. We'll work with them but not for them but I can't work with an organization that's corrupted. Right now we don't have anything substantial which is why we haven't gone running to Fury but when we do, we'll act."
"I'm sure SHIELD's gotten rid of the little back door I created through the helicarrier but I do still have all of the information I took from them. I might have lied when they asked what I did with it." Tony gave a nonchalant little shrug but the grin he had on his face was shit eating. "I almost completely forgot about until right now. We can go through that, categorize everything as safe, maybe, and suspicious. I can try to get back into the system from here while we do that."
When Natasha, Clint and Sam returned to the tower they brought dinner and the group of them sat around the living eating while the three of them went over the hideouts they checked out. There hadn't been anything left behind in any of them. No technology. No paperwork. Nothing. They were spotless, though some of the cleared SHIELD agents were going to go through and do a second check. It was disheartening to say the least knowing that they were able to get out of the States with Tony in tow and no one even saw them.
Tony watched them walk off and let his head rest against the cold wall with a shaky sigh. What a mess. His eyes moved to look at the kid across from him who was watching him warily and he mustered a little smile.
He wondered how long he'd been here for. He didn't know these people or why they took him. They looked like midgardians but more advanced then the ones he'd seen when their father last took him here and they didn't look at all like the ones in his readings. They weren't primitive or clueless. They were mean looking and made snide remarks. If it weren't for his all-speak, he would have been lost but he understood everything they said. The comments were unkind and cruel. They mocked his predicament and they refused to give him food. He was starving. They never once said how they took him from his home or why he was there. Sometimes they threatened to hurt him, slammed their sticks and weapons against the bar to drive him into the corner.
"Awesome." Tony clapped his hands together. "I'll send you all phones. Stark phones, of course. I don't trust sending this information over anything that might get seen by outside forces. And since Hansel and Gretel are in, that means we can get more information."
Steve just sighed as he left, making his way back to his own hospital room. Fury was sitting in one of the chairs, tapping his fingers together as he waited. Hill was off to side, leaning back in another chair and she sat up when he stepped into the room. Passing Fury, he took a seat back on the vacant bed.
What did he know about Loki? He had to remember. He was a trickster god but not...but not completely like the mythology. He didn't know much mythology anyways. He could turn himself into things! That's right. He'd seen it! He knows he's seen it.
"Until you can get everything with SHIELD under control and you're certain you're Hydra free, I'm not leaving Bucky in your custody. There's too much risk that someone can get him and he's safer in our hands."
He almost laughed. His fingers reached out to touch it gently, afraid it would slip out of his grasp. He hadn't deserved it back then and even now, to this day, he didn't deserve it. They were barely on speaking terms and yet Tony's first priority had been to upgrade him. Not just him but the others too. Nat, Clint, Thor, Bruce. All of them.
"He has proven difficult to acquire, escaping our hold without realizing on many occasions. His security was unrivaled in the fortress he calls his tower and he
All eyes turned on him and if he'd been a younger, more uncertain leader, he would have shrank under the scrutiny. In the last week they'd done research, he never once mentioned who it was and for good reason. He didn't want any of them worried he was digging up some past vendetta against a group that no one had heard word of since he went into the ice. He didn't need them worried that he was looking for a war that wasn't there. Steve could see it on all their faces.
He wanted to hold on, stay awake like Tony wanted but he didn't have the strength to and found himself drifting into the dark.
Steve hadn't been lying. About Hydra. About SHIELD. About his parents. The weight of knowing that his father and mother hadn't died in some random car accident was heavy. And the fact that it was a brainwashed version of Steve's friend? A man his father also knew? How was someone supposed to process that? Once he skimmed over the snippets, he hadn't been able to focus on anything else, letting JARVIS take the reigns since.
Steve's eyes lit up at the suit. His stealth suit. Fury mentioned before that Stark had designed it but he never put much thought into it. If he was honest? This suit had always been his favorite. It fit well. It was armored but still light enough to move in. The darker color suited him better too.
Tony couldn't help the smug little grin that graced his features when he was hauled to his feet and Rumlow came stalking into his room.
"Yeah. Yeah of course she is Steve. JARVIS. Confirm the year and call Romanoff. Set phone to speaker."
Both he and Sam took off into a run at the sight of the Winter Soldier pinning Steve down. Even from where they were it was easy to see that Steve was losing. Sam was faster and Tony watched as he picked up the shield in one fluid motion as he passed it, using it to slam into Bucky's head. A move he would have applauded Sam for if it were under better circumstances.
The front door was busted, the living room in disarray but he pushed his way down the hall towards the guest room. The last place he saw Tony. He knew it was dumb to hope for Tony to maybe be hiding in the house still but he just wanted to believe for a moment that Tony was okay.
. The car passed the so called idiot and Tony stared. Messy dark hair, mask covering the lower half of his face, metal arm. He almost didn't see the gun slung over his shoulder and he missed entirely the small explosive that had been tossed under the car.
"No I do. We need more information. We'll be faster at this, JARVIS and I. I have to work. Thank-you Steve, really but I'm fine."
The cold didn't bother him too much, neither did the dark. He was a little chilled but that was always the extent of it. He never had to bundle up much when they went somewhere cold, not like Thor who whined and griped about, telling him that he was lucky the cold didn't bother him as much as it did others.
"Loki." It was Bruce now, still calm and gentle. "What's the last thing you remember before you woke up in the cell. Think very carefully."
"None. The place in DC was abandoned and the chair you mentioned was gone. They must have had a plan in place in case of something like this."
Bucky looked at the door when he stepped in, a look of disappointment flickered across his features before it was masked behind one of disinterest. He turned his head to look away from Steve and stared out the window. Steve tried not to let that hurt. He reminded himself that this wasn't the Bucky of the past nor was it the friend he regained in another future. He had to start over again and that was okay. He just had to take things slow.
It was a smooth voice, coming from the watch. Calm and collected. In a way it reminded him Heimdall. Heimdall was always calm, even when everyone else wasn't.
"Are.You.Getting.In." A slender eyebrow went up and she just stared him like he'd gone senile. "Did you forget where you were old man?"
"Tony! Steve!" Steve jerked forward when Clint slapped him on the shoulder from behind while Nat expertly slipped behind Tony, taking the briefcase and the thumb drive in one easy movement.
"It's alright Tony." He smiled softly, reassuringly and it seemed to make Tony relax more, that worry or guilt fading from his expression. "I know it's going to take a while. It means a lot that you're even giving it a try."
"Howard." Piped Loki from where he sat. "You have people who care about you. Pepper. Rhodey. Happy. Steve--"
does is make a suit of armor that has an artillery the military would be jealous of. Arrows and weaponized gloves--"
"I don't trust Rumlow. There was something off about the conversation today. Like you being here benefited him for some reason. I'm worried they're going to try something if you go back to the hotel."
Sure he could do the missions themselves just fine but it took every inch of his self control not punch Rumlow and his strike team in the faces whenever left in a room with them. It was hard not to dangle Sitwell out of a window whenever their paths crossed. Every fiber of his being wanted to take apart everything there with his bare hands but he couldn't. He knew he couldn't. He didn't have enough evidence against them yet. He would soon though, he could feel it.
A black SUV now sat in the drive way. Three of the Strike members stepped out, one he recognized as Rumlow. A glint of silver told him that Barnes was there too. Tony sucked in a sharp breath, eyes wide. How did they know they were there? Did they know the others weren't here?
Bucky went in fast and Steve anticipated it, ducking and blocking every potential hit. He felt a rib break when a metal arm hit him too hard and knew that there were a few well placed kicks that returned the favor. He avoided the knife as much as he could until he saw an opening to knock it out of his grip, spinning a little to elbow Bucky in the stomach before sweeping his feet out from under him. He then dove for his shield, rolling to the side and ducking behind it just as he heard three shots ring out and bounce off his shield. He risked getting to his feet, feeling a bullet enter his leg as he threw his shield with precision. Bucky blocked and knocked his shield aside with a metal arm before Steve tackled into him again, wrestling for the pistol when it went off.
So Steve stayed in the tower, Tony letting him pick a room on the communal floor. He said since Steve was there first, he got first dibs so he chose the room that would have been his anyways. Tony had other things to work on aside from their snooping so while Tony worked on his things, Steve poured through the files JARVIS collected. Around dinner, Steve would take a break to cook something and drag Tony up to join him and then they'd spend the entire evening going through each of the things that Steve flagged as suspicious.
"I just want to make sure that a member of this team we're supposed to have is in good health. Why is that so surprising?"
Loki sniffed a little and he nodded at the watch before realizing that the voice probably couldn't see him. "Alright." He muttered softly. Once he reached the treeline, he hunkered down against the trunk of one and pulled his knees to his chest.
"So this is the plan." Steve crossed his arms, looking down at the paper laid out over Sam's dining room table. Standing around the table with him was Sam, Clint and Natasha as well as Fury with of course, Hill because where Fury went, she went. Fury arrived not long after their call and by then, Steve had managed to focus but chose to regroup in the morning. He cleared his head and after talking with Bruce and looking over the information they had, he was able to come up with the plan by that next morning.
"What year is it?" Steve's question was mumbled into his shirt, his face now pressed into his side but Tony could hear how shaky his voice was. "Nat? Nat's okay right?"
There was a moment of silence, Tony tapping on the side of the glass while Steve stewed on the information. Getting Tony to come around to the idea was going more smoothly then he thought it would. He was worried that it would have taken him longer to get him to agree and worried that he would have to resort to divulging more information but Tony was piecing it together all on his own and pretty quickly too. He admired how quick his brain worked.
"Steve--" Hill wore a frown on her face, waving him over to one of the monitors. "This just popped up. I think it's intended for you."
Steve works on getting help to expose Hydra. Little by little his plan starts to come together and he sees a glimpse of what his team could have been.
Stumbling he made it to the other side of the alley, aware of the sirens approaching. He looked around wildly, trying to figure out the best route to run that didn't involve people. He didn't want someone to get caught in the crossfire. There was a noise behind him and he looked back to see the asset already recovered and turning his attention his way.
There was another look shared between the spies before they tentatively nodded. The others let out a collective sigh of relief seeing that Natasha and Clint were in and Steve felt better knowing that another part of his plan was in motion. If the five of them worked together (6 once they eventually figured out where Thor was.) they could stop Hydra and still save SHIELD in the process.
"Rogers, Steven, born 1918. Romanoff, Natalia Alianovna, Born 1984. Barton, Clinton Francis. Born 1979. "
"Sam, go with Hill and sabotage the third helicarrier. Take out anyone firing at you. I'm going to help Tony. Keep an eye out for Rumlow and Winter Soldier. Take Rumlow out but do no engage the soldier."
He was so in awe that he didn't see the man with the strange weapon approach him. His arm was grabbed and he let out a cry as he was hauled up only for the man to suddenly still. He started falling back, an arrow sticking out of his chest and Loki fell back.
He didn't wait to hear what Steve would say next. His small legs moved and he took off into the line of trees. He'd been running in snow. He wasn't stupid. The bad men must have seen his foot prints and followed. He had to keep moving. They were bigger and probably faster.
Tony let out a breath at that and Steve sighed. The other man was re-reading the files JARVIS had pulled up, rubbing at his face.
Convincing Fury hadn't been as hard as he thought it would be. He seemed a little put off but told him to take all the time he needed. Steve wondered if Fury was already working out that SHIELD wasn't everything he thought it was and that was why he was letting him leave. He had to admit that he was glad there was little resistance and hadn't needed to argue to make his point. Whether Fury okay'd it or not, he would have gone any way.
"You're okay. You're okay." Tony watched Steve let out a shaky breath, repeating the mantra to himself softly. Hesitantly, he reached out to run his fingers through the blonds hair, damp with sweat. Pepper had done it for him a couple times when he was still suffering with night terrors after New York. He remembered how comforting it was just having someone there to keep him grounded and with how easily Steve relaxed into the touch, it seemed to have the same effect on Steve.
"Your name is James Buchanan Barnes! You were taken by Hydra and used for their purpose." Using his full weight he tried to keep Bucky pinned down. "You know it's true. There's a part of you that knows it's true."
"Before you agree as a way to get your hands on something that can help you, you will be monitored at all times. If it looks like you're making something other than a suit of armor, we will kill the child."
Once again, shout out to Bunnyc, Uko_chan, Hostbusters, ThoughtfulBreadPolice, tsk, slightly_salty_ace, zinny and Ink-Raven (k505) for your wonderful comments! The next chapter will have a little more action and it will start jumping POV's between Steve and Tony. Hope you all enjoyed and thank you for keeping me motivated to keep this trucking along! I've also been debating making a tumblr account to post this there and maybe take requests or something. I'll think on it. Maybe when this first part is done. Anywho, see you in chapter 4!
When Steve opened his eyes, he found that he was no longer in the small, run down motel room that he'd fallen asleep in the night before. It was still dark, the sun barely peeking in through his window but it was enough for him to see and what he saw caused him to frown in his half asleep state. It wasn't the motel he fell asleep in because this was his apartment. Not the one he had after Thanos snapped away a half of the population but the one he had in DC.
There was a loud boom, like thunder and Loki watched wide-eyed as thunder rained down from the sky with a taller man wearing a red cape. An Asgardian! His father must have sent someone!
And like that, Bruce was pulled into their researching. They went back over the files Steve chose and he actually added more insight to plenty of other things. The eagerness he had in helping them tear apart a top secret spy organization from the inside out was a little surprising. He could see the feeling was mutual when he glanced over at Tony and they both just shook their heads and dove in with him.
The others looked over the plans, nodding at the information before getting geared up. He was already suited up, fixing the gloves of his suit. The suit Tony made for him months ago, before they'd become friends.
It was a detail he'd forgotten about. HYDRA slipped it out the last time at some point and they'd gotten it again this time.
He took off running, sprinting across the floor to the next helicarrier. He damaged the one, he would work his way through as fast as he could. He flinched and ducked a little when he heard gun fire, running for the open helicarrier hanger door. He didn't stop running, despite his feet being as sore as they were, his body aching. He slid around corners, making his way to to the command room again. He immediately went to work on this one as well. The three of them were being built at the same time, but this one was further along than the other one. He wondered how the third one would be.
"Well...We need to get a hold of Thor. So we need to figure out how to do that. He's going to want to know about Loki's scepter missing. Anything you might be able to tell me?"
It was days after they'd returned to New York. The team got settled and Steve let Bucky pick a room of his own. He was certain that Tony wouldn't have minded, as it had been the same thing he'd done for all of them. The following day, Nat and the other two left to hit the bases and were nearly done the list. Bruce stayed behind, on call in case they came across trouble while Steve paced.
And like that, the little mouse was out of the bars and gone. The guards hadn't noticed for an hour or so. He tried to rearrange the blankets they had to make it look like Loki was sleeping but someone must have been checking the video surveillance. All hell broke loose after that, guards checking each cell before he heard someone ordering to start looking outside. If they were lucky, Loki was far enough away by now and his friends were coming.
"I'd go--" Tony cut in. "But I actually have a charity function to attend to. I wasn't originally going to go but since I was in town, I figured why not. It doubled as my cover for coming to DC in the first place."
Pushing himself even harder, his foot hit a root and he fell forward, Tony's watch flying from his hand. He let out a little cry as he hit the ground, the snow doing little to break the fall and he scurried across the cold to get to the watch. He couldn't lose the watch! It was Tony's! Tony's friends could help him! If he lost the watch how would they get rescued?
By the end of dinner, facts were exchanged and everything was laid out on the table, so to speak. The thumb drive was slid across the table from Nat to Tony as Clint collected the dishes.
The sounds of footsteps approaching had Loki scooting closer to him out of fear over anything. A guard stopped at his cell, holding a plate of actually decent looking food. He looked at Loki, his mouth guard off, then at Tony before looking at the one plate. There was a shrug before he slid it through the bars and walked off. Lovely. Walking over, he grabbed it and sat down.
"What...is this place?" He heard Clint murmur as they came down the stairs. Natasha located the lights and flicked them on, a low hum of electricity filling the room as she did. Even now, Steve was mildly surprised by the SHIELD logo bright on the wall. "SHIELD?"
Was it because Tony was using him as a pillow still, the side of his face smashed against his chest while snored? Yes. Would he admit it? Not to anyone who wasn't Tony, and even then, very reluctantly. Tony had been sweet, offering to help him through his nightmare. The other knew exactly how to calm his fears and put him at ease and he was grateful Tony had been there. He couldn't remember much of the nightmare. It was too disorienting and he felt like he was spiraling downwards. Natasha and Tony were dead and he was lost. That was all he could recall of what terrorized him the night before. Having Tony there to remind him that he was okay, that Nat was okay, had been everything to Steve.
Tony took the seat next to him and Steve couldn't help but give him a look of worry. "Are you okay?"
Ahead of them at the end of the hall, he could see Natasha and Clint exit a room. That would be the room they could duck into and Tony could get to work in. Them leaving meant it was secure. Tony patted his breast pocket, pulling out the little thumb drive that Steve almost laughed at. A tiny Iron Man head sat in his palm and Tony grinned at the look Steve gave him.
"This was everything we could get while Zola was talking. If there's anything on there that could help us--"
"Shit--" He gasped as he unbuckled and landed on his arm. Slow, careful steps in the glass outside told him that Hydra's little attack dog was coming around to his door and he scrambled to the other side, pulling himself out of the broken window. Adrenaline was the only thing pushing him to his feet and he popped his head over the bottom of the car to see where his attacker went.
But this man, in the time they shared their cell, he was nice. He didn't talk to Loki like he was a child. He listened to Loki's stories on the second day after he came back later than the first and in turn, shared some of his own. He listened, to be polite because it was a way for Tony to remember what he could but he could still see the fear present there every time it took longer for Tony to remember something or when he forgot a detail in total.
"Mhm. I was working with Coulson, guarding the hammer when it arrived before him. Saw him in action before he just gave up. We had him in our custody when someone got him out. I can get the paperwork out of SHIELD tonight and we can get a hold of him by morning."
"He is. I do not know how this happened but I would know my brother anywhere, no matter what age he is. This is Loki."
Just gone. He traded SHIELD for Tony and this wasn't how it was supposed to go. They were all supposed to get out of this but they didn't. In a sense, he'd failed.
Opening his laptop, he did a quick search of the day and recent news until he found what he wanted. News about Tony Stark's most recent dilemma. He remembered at the time the incident with Killian had taken place, he was just returning to the States having visited a few places in Europe. He'd seen the news after it all happened. The threat to the president. The terrorist bombings. Tony's house in Malibu and the billionaire being declared dead. He remembered asking-- demanding to know why SHIELD hadn't put more man power on the situation but all he was given was a flimsy excuse.
Ending the transmission, he let out a little sigh, turning his attention to the monitors. The three of them watched as people, confused, started to evacuate. As much as he wanted this to end peacefully, he could already see everything descending into chaos. Most tried to leave but others, who noticed the change in those called out, thought it was their job to engage.
As always, a big big thank you to Larrys_Consulting_Avenger, TheCalmDisco, pxrplegrxpe, baka_yu, travelfan1346, SofiaMichelle, Chrsfrthwckd and levana84  for all of your comments. I liked reading the speculations from the first chapter!
keeping people here. There was someone else! That was good. Other people meant he could get information. See if they knew the layout of the building, who was in charge and what they were doing here.
"Fury's going to have to do a culling of his staff after this. Get better background checks going." Tony shook his head. "JARVIS, send the other files to Bruce to look at and then activate the 'Dark Knight' protocol with the members of SHIELD on our watch list. Code word Asset."
"How about I talk to you first. There's something I came to the conclusion of." That made Steve hesitate and before he could speak, Tony cut him off. "It's about my attacker today."
That got Tony's attention and he could see the gears working in his mind. He was trying to work this out in his head. To Tony, this was a new problem to be solved and Steve knew that the genius loved solving problems. Even though Tony was just sitting there and thinking, it was still fascinating to see him work. He couldn't possibly imagine how his mind worked, how he came to different conclusions. Things that didn't even seem connected became connected once Tony put his mind to it.
He watched as Natasha and Clint shared a look. Not one word was spoken verbally but Steve knew, after seeing them work together countless times, that they could be having an entire conversation without needing to say a thing. There was a frown from Clint and Natasha's eyebrow quirked before they both nodded.
. Fell into place. He didn't protest when he felt an arm hook around his waist, pulling him in closer. His fingers were still brushing through Steve's hair, thumbs rubbing at his temples gently.
When the doors to the elevator opened and she was standing with her arms crossed and an amused little smile on her face, he was sure his heart stopped. For a moment he'd forgotten where he was because suddenly he was back on the compound, suited up and ready to make the trip to get the stones. Each of them having their own mission. She was going with Clint. She was getting the Soul Stone. She gave him a little smile--
"Tony?" He heard about how Tony had dragged Bucky into the elevator before he got nabbed and it made his chest hurt. Not only could he have had a Tony that wanted to help Bucky in the other time-line if he hadn't been too cowardly to tell him about his parents but now the Tony here, that was willing to help, was the one that was missing.
"Think you're funny huh?" Rumlow asked, grabbing him by the arm and dragging him out of the room. "We only needed him to motivate you to work but we don't need that now."
"They know we're coming. We're not going to assume that we have the element of surprise. So we're going in hard. We have three goals. Upload what we have against Pierce and Hydra and release it to the public. Stop work on those helicarriers and find Tony. Natasha and Clint, you'll go with Fury to Pierce's office to get the information uploaded. Hill is going to bring myself and Sam to communications before taking us down to the helicarriers to stop work on them. Along the way, we'll try to find out where they have Tony. Bruce will be waiting at the tower with JARVIS at the ready. Once we get connected, they will be too so if Pierce tries to pull something, they'll take over and keep things going. We know for a fact that Strike is Hydra. If any of the others are, we'll find out after I make the announcement."
Slumping in the back seat of his car, he told the driver to head to the nearest fast food place. He needed food and probably another coffee.
Big thanks to Madlenita, Ceisya (also aww, you're a sweetie! <3), SofiaMichelle, Zoran1390, matomato, MarvelSteveTony, eh (great name anonymous, btw lol), slightly_salty_ace (well hello again!) and Daydreamer_Nightthinker for all your comments! Only a couple more chapters for the first part of this series left guys! Things are going to get crazy!
Tony didn't know how true that was, pacing back and forth in front of the couch while Steve leaned back and watched him. The moment they were safely out of SHIELD with the thumb drive back in their hands, Tony had been ranting about Rumlow. He didn't stop him. There was no point. Rumlow was unsettling. Something else that Steve hadn't noticed the first time around. He couldn't shake the others parting words either. They were ominous and he was hoping that he was just reading too much into it.
Before he could recover from the feeling, Bucky rolled them again, pinning him to the ground as the metal hand grabbed his neck. He choked, grasping at the hand desperately as he fought for air. He wheezed, gasped and continued to beat a fist against the hand gripping him until he was too weak to.
He didn't know what he was expecting but he knew it wasn't the nice yet still somewhat covert black car that was creeping up behind him that had Clint half way hanging out the back seat passenger window. Natasha was sitting up front next to a driver with a hat pulled low over his face, though the very well trimmed and unique styled goatee was a dead give away anyways. Steve grinned.
Tony was astounded. Just amazed. These Hydra guys were not the smartest. He heard stories. His father told him stories, he read about them. He knew some of what Steve told him too. Anyone willing to follow the weird, red skulled bad guy couldn't have been that bright but this was just another level of stupidity.
The clapping of thunder on a relatively sunny day announced the arrival of Thor midway through dinner and he stormed through the glass doors of the balcony, pausing briefly at the group of them sitting around the living room.
Tony jerked his head towards where Barnes was sprawled out on the ground, shield left next to him. He wasn't going to leave Bucky down here to die or get caught by anyone else left from Hydra. He could see the look of understanding on Sam's face even before he said it, the man already moving to carefully drag Steve towards the elevator.
So he dressed, packed a bag and caught a ride to SHIELD headquarters. He was supposed to start missions with the strike team and Natasha that week but he was going to tell Fury to give him more time. His reasoning was sound even though he knew it would raise a few eyebrows. Wanting to check on the well being of his teammate should be a good enough reason to let him off for some extra time.
He asked him questions calmly, pushing his spectacles up his nose as he looked his feet over and checked him for any injuries.
"From staying? No. My job is to protect the Time Stone. It is here. It is protected. I will not need to interfere however--" Steve tensed as she held her hand out to him, calmly with an expectant gaze. "--this will be a one time deal. If you decide to stay, the Pym Particles you are using will stay here under safe keeping to keep you from using them to fix every little thing that goes wrong. You can choose a time, a place and go there one last time so I suggest you choose wisely."
Steve paused before following. "Taking a break?" This wasn't right was it? Pepper and Tony were together up until the Accords. He wasn't remembering that wrong was he? He bit back the small fear and swallowed thickly. Was his mere presence here changing things already?
Loki nodded before there was a look of concentration on the boys face, a finger tracing over the face of the watch. As much as Tony had loathed the older Loki, watching him turn into Cap for that moment had been amazing to see. Just the sheer ease of it. It was no difference now as the boy in front of him turned into a mouse. Tony wanted to jump up and down with a laugh but kept composed, fitting the watch over the little body like a mouse sized belt.
"Steve?" He whispered again, taking further steps until he could poke his head around the corner. The lights were out but even in the dark he could tell there was no fighting happening. The room was empty save for Steve's bulky form on the couch. Still, when he stepped out into the living room he kept his hand raised, ready to fire if he had to. Quietly, he walked over to where Steve was sleeping. Being such a big guy on a tiny couch couldn't be that comfortable and Tony felt a little bad for not taking the couch himself. It wasn't until he got closer that he noticed Steve was twitching. His fingers were curled into fists and his brows were drawn together.
He checked his watch. By now the other three should have been in the elevator so he nodded and leaned into the microphone for the building's PA system.
"The way I see it, Barnes is your Rhodey. If I was in your position and there was a chance Rhodey was out there and still alive? I'd stop at nothing to find him and it would kill me to have no one believe me."
There were short conversations; Clint joking about their recent assignment, Tony talking about something he and Bruce blew up, the local news and it wasn't until they had their food in front of them, did Tony get down to business.
"Yeah yeah. You guys can crash here. Bruce and Steve already have a room picked out so if the doors not locked, it's yours."
That earned a laugh and he sent Tony a look, asking if he wanted to explain it further. It was met with a lazy shrug.
He knew. Of course he knew. It was Hydra and it was killing Steve that he couldn't just come out and say it. If he came right off the bat with Hydra, he'd make Tony suspicious and less likely to believe him. He had to play his cards right and if he wanted help, he had to play a little dumb here.
The next morning, after his run, he met up with Tony for coffee before they drove in to SHIELD. Tony had a decent sized metal briefcase with him and he shushed Steve when he inquired, claiming it was a plan B. He also
Against his better judgement, he left Tony to get to work and went back to where the others were sitting, now in the living room. On the coffee table, there was a folder sitting open that Natasha and Clint were looking over.
"Hey-- Hey--" He whispered harshly. "You, in the other cell, are you alive? Tell me you're alive. I really don't want to make friends with a corpse. They make for crummy conversation."
"Why not...?" His attention turned to her, frown in place. He had to remind himself that they weren't a team. Not yet. They would be but right now they had no attachments. "His house was destroyed. He went missing and didn't he just have the reactor taken out?"
"Pierce. He's blowing the helicarriers. He's activated some sort of self destruct sequence. Bruce and JARVIS aren't having any luck. You need to get everyone out of there."
"I gave them the offer. They can either be SHIELD, Avengers or both. You'll have to talk to them about their decisions."
The most he had to do was call a woman named Jane in search of Thor and leave a message for him to come back to the tower. He also had JARVIS pass on the news to Pepper and Rhodes about Tony. Rhodes said he would see what he could do where he was and get in touch with some people while Pepper asked them to keep it quiet for now, not wanting to upset those on the Industry side of things. For now all he could do was wait.
Either way, he was on the next flight out of DC and in New York staring up at the tower he once called home a couple hours later. He breathed out a nervous sigh (and it was weird to feel nervous after what he'd seen already) and shouldered his bag, stepping into the building. He greeted the receptionist, who was so star struck that she happily lead him to the private elevator that lead up to the floors the team would one day call home.
Once again he found himself  grabbed by the neck and held in place, Barnes eyes staring at him with little interest but clear intent. When he moved, Barnes held him tighter and he choked.
Tony tapped his fingers against his chest out of habit as the elevator went up. The last thing he saw when the doors closed was Steve tackling his best friend into the ground. Bucky Barnes. James Barnes. He should feel
Also still thinking on that tumblr account or something. Unsure if I should make a writing account or not. I'll post it if I do make on!
"A nice memory but not helpful to the current situation. Do you remember a blue cube at all? Glowed a little?" Another shake of his head and Tony scooted back to sit against the wall. "That's alright too. I'll figure something out. My friends are going to come and get us out of here but they tend to be a little late. I might have to step in and get the ball rolling a little."
"Hey, it's alright. I'm a friend of Thors. He's your brother right?" Finally a nod and Tony offered the faintest of smiles. "I'm Tony."
Sitting on the pillow was Tony's watch. Tony was wearing that watch the last time he saw him which meant that Rumlow put that there on purpose. Picking it up, Steve rubbed his thumb over the screen before sitting on the bed with a defeated sigh.
"He could be enhanced. Hey kiddo." The calm man smiled softly, now that he was done doing his looking. "My name is Bruce. This here is Clint. We're friends of Tony's"
Steve was out of the car with his shield before Sam even stopped in the driveway, feet taking him to the house. JARVIS contacted them the moment the Strike team arrived on scene but they'd been too far away. He was too far away. Again.
Steve watched, amazed at the ease in which Clint made himself feel at home. The archer all but dove over the back of the couch while Natasha followed at her own slower pace, head shaking. Bruce was close behind, asking the both of them how things were and other social pleasantries they'd skipped over initially. Steve was going to join them, wanting to get back into that familiar feeling of having his old team back when Tony's gentle touch to his arm stopped him.
"Army regulations forbids storing munitions within 500 yards of the barracks. This buildings in the wrong place." The lock was made quick work of, the shield slamming into it like it had before and they pulled the doors open.
Another look and one by one, they filtered out. Bruce first, telling him that he was glad he was awake, followed by a relieved looking Sam. Clint though. Clint paused and he looked angry. It wasn't directed at him, that much he could tell but if they'd won, why was he angry? Natasha gently sent him on his way before pulling her chair up.
" when the sound of a something hard smacking into side of Bucky's head reached his ears and suddenly he could breathe. The weight was off him and his neck had been freed. He heard it again as he sucked in a ragged breath and then Tony was in his field of vision. There were hands on his face, warm brown eyes looking into his with concern.
The first time in the chair was excruciating and terrifying. Strapped down with the guard in his mouth to keep him from biting off his own tongue, Tony had tried his damnedest not to scream. It felt like something was taking a knife to his brain and methodically removing what made him, him. Fingers gripped the chair until his knuckles were white and his eyes stayed closed during the whole procedure until he was finally released. They didn't even make him work on anything that first day. Instead they dragged him back to his cell and dropped him on the floor where his blanket was.
"Stark, Howard was in the way of Hydra and needed to be removed. Stark, Anthony has proven to be a much bigger thorn in Hydra's side. He has interrupted our plans not twice, but thrice and even now, plots with you to disrupt us yet again. He would have been a grand asset to Hydra, given his intellect however we are prepared to cut our losses if he cannot be acquired."
"Are these our presents Stark?" She asked, fixing them both with a calming smile. Tony grinned back just as easily to Steve's amazement.
Several hours and a handful of car games later, they were pulling up to the old camp. Steve couldn't help the wave of nostalgia he felt coming here, even on the fourth time around between timelines. He hadn't spent much time here but what little he did was an experience he would never forget, whether it was training to be a soldier in the war or sneaking around with Tony to steal the tesseract.
walk past, they talked about what was happening. Something about a hydra and shield. Were they in charge of such a beast? He read about them once, none had been seen in a long time but what if they had one and this shield? A man with a shield maybe? Had taken it down. He must have been a strong warrior to do so and maybe this was why they were so scattered. Their beast was gone and now they had no creature to protect them.
Then he pulled back and the bastard was wearing the most breathtakingly sweetest smile that Tony had ever seen and the genius was rendered speechless.
The entire drive back from New Jersey to DC, Nat had to drive. Steve couldn't focus or he would start driving too fast and too reckless to get back as soon as he can. Nat switched him and he sat in the passengers seat tapping his foot and checking his phone. Tony wasn't answering his phone and he hadn't heard anything from Sam since he asked the man to go look for him so he had no idea what was going on or if Tony was even okay.
There was whistling noise, the sound of something bouncing off a tree and hitting someone. Loki lifted his head in time to watch a man in a dark uniform, star bright on his chest; run past him, catching a shield as he did. A shield?
He was running as fast as his feet could take him. Once he'd made it out of the little building, he darted into a field of snow but his little mouse body couldn't make it too far and he had to change back. The watch secure to his wrist, he'd taken off running. Just like Tony said. He didn't stop, he didn't dare look back, he just ran until he couldn't anymore. And once it was too hard to breath, he slowed his pace to walk to catch his breath. He had to of been far enough now, right?
These should have been reasons to visit the first time but Steve hadn't and for the life of him, he couldn't remember why. Why hadn't he reached out to Tony at all after leaving? They'd parted on good terms but he never thought to make sure he was okay.
So Bucky could remember the incident on the street which meant they hadn't wiped his mind in the time between then and now. It was reassuring to know.
"Just go Cap." Clint offered a small nod towards Bucky who was eyeing them. "I know a bit about brainwashing. Nothing as traumatic as your friends but it gives us something to talk about."
Standing there staring at the watch, the chill started to get to him so he walked on, trudging through the snow.
More files were pulled up. A lot of the information was redacted and blacked out but Steve hyper focused on the words he could see. In particular 'Asset'.
"Is it about Hydra and the fact that they, you know--" Clint's voice dropped. "--killed his parents. Probably with the guy that attacked him?"
Steve rubbed at his forehead, staring at the papers of his most recent report with disdain. He remembered writing, word for word, this exact mission report and at this point, it was starting to get tiring. Deeming it done, he sent it off to get filed and decided to leave for the day, hands stuffed inside his pockets as he chose to walk back to his place. It took longer, of course it did but it gave him time to clear his head and he could stop to pick up a few things on his way home if he wanted.
"The Avengers. We started out as your pet project but I plan for us to be independent from SHIELD and any government. We'll be willing to work with you, once things are settled and we won't risk operations in a country without the right authorities knowing." Something they overlooked the last time they worked as a team and the worlds countries were not happy with some of the outcomes. If they could work with governments, not for them, he was hoping that they could avoid anything like the Sokovia Accords. "But ultimately we'll be working on our own and I'm taking Sergeant Barnes into our protective custody."
"Dig up a list of AIM employees. Before and after Killian's downfall. Separate the ones that jumped ship and see where they went."
Tony stared at him, wide eyed, letting the information process. It was different this time around. He remembered, vividly, even now, the look on Tony's face. The focus Tony had on that little monitor. The way he flinched when watching Howard's assassination, the way his eyes narrowed when Maria's life was taken from her. It had been violent and it wasn't fair that Tony had to find out that way. If he could help it, this time? Tony would never see that tape.
"Do it. We'll all meet on the quinjet tomorrow morning at 0800. If you're late, you'll have to buy a ticket back to New York."
"My name... is Anthony Edward Stark. My friends call me Tony? My...my mothers name is Maria. My fathers name is..is.."
Tony hung up and turned to the computer as he got the recording ready on his phone. "Jarvis you need to delete everything we uploaded onto this computer. Don't let them get a thing. Hey, Steve, listen. This wasn't your fault okay? I'm going to be fine. Bruce has everything. You need to call Fury when you find this. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I did this behind your back but you can trust him. Don't leave me waiting too long? Okay. Okay. Yeah. I'll be fine."
They hit the ground, sprawled out as the gun Bucky had been using flew across the floor with Steve's shield. He scrambled to his feet and tackled into Bucky before he could get back up. He remembered the beating he received the last they fought. He remembered every punch and sting of pain. He wasn't going to let that happen again. Or he was going to try. He needed to knock Bucky out as soon as he could and just drag him out of there.
The shouts were getting a little closer now and he started running faster now. His legs were tired and he was out of breath but he didn't want to go back there!
This is it. The end of part one! I wanted to post it earlier but fighting scenes are not my forte so yeah--
"You're Loki, right?" It wasn't hard to piece together. The mouth guard was the biggest give away, he'd seen it on Loki the day he escaped with the tesseract from the tower. Given his looks, it was easy to put this child to the older Asguardian. How he ended up like that and where the tesseract was, was another thing altogether. The kid looked at him in surprise but didn't give him an answer.
He was well aware of the doors sliding open but he didn't stop working. Not when they were yelling at him to stop. Not when they were threatening to shoot him. Because a moment later he heard the now familiar hum of the shield flying through the air. It bounced off the wall and into one of the guards, knocking him down. A second later, Steve barreled into the room and into the next guard, slamming him into the wall.
"C'mon Barnes." He muttered, scrambling over to the other man. He grabbed the shield and hooked it onto Bucky's arm before grabbing him under the arms and hauling him up as best as he could. He thought he should feel worried when Bucky let out a pained groan but his sole focus was getting Barnes dragged to the elevator.
They spun around at sudden sound of gunfire. Further down they could see Hydra agents opening fire at someone sprinting from one helicarrier to the next.
Tony's gaze flicked to him with an eyebrow raised, looking at him curiously. Right. With everything that had happened, he forgot about his nightmare and about how nice it was to sleep next to Tony and their kiss. As much as he wanted to change the topic and talk about that, he shook his head. This time he wasn't going to take the cowards way out. He wasn't going to avoid telling Tony the truth to protect Bucky or himself. Or to spare Tony's feelings. Which was the lie he told himself the first time, when he didn't tell Tony the truth. His mistake was never trusting Tony with the truth, worried he would react the way he did in Siberia and he wouldn't repeat that mistake.
Slipping out of bed, he grabbed his phone and silently stepped into the hall. He tapped his watched and pulled his glove over hand, letting the armor slide into place. "Steve?" He hissed, slowly approaching the living room. There was another thud, the sound of something hitting the carpet from the table and Tony paused, weighing his options. If Steve was getting his super powered ass kicked in the next room what good would he be with just one little glove and no suit?
"I know, there won't be much to save of SHIELD. But you and Bruce and JARVIS have weeded out almost everything that Hydra's done behind the scenes. We can use that, narrow in on those who were involved. It might help."
"Hey, we need him alive." Rumlow said, sounding rather bored at the situation. He could hear the sounds of something breaking inside, the rest of the team searching for what they might have in the house. In the back of his head, he made a mental note to pay Sam for the damages.
When the man was brought back, he was muttering to himself, eyes wild as he tried to remember things. He learned his name was Tony. He learned that Tony had a family and people that were missing him. Did he say Thor--? Were they erasing his memory? It sounded like they were. The man looked scared and that didn't feel right to Loki. Adults weren't supposed to be scared. They were supposed to be strong and brave.
Steve ignored them both, stopping in front of the shelf that hid the elevator. He shifted the grip on his shield and pulled it aside, listening to it squeal across the floor until the doors were uncovered.
Tony, Steve noted, not Stark. He hadn't realized that Fury and Tony were that close. Actually, now that he was thinking about it, he vaguely recalled Tony calling Fury by his first name. He put a pin in that for now, deciding to look more into that later as he sighed.
"Hm? Oh you're leaving?" Steve paused, Rumlow's words coming back to him. It didn't sit well with him, the way Rumlow had welcomed Tony to DC. It might be a little irrational but he couldn't risk Tony's safety like that. Briefly, he recalled what Zola told him and Nat in the other timeline. Hydra took out the Starks. What if they were tying that up in a neat little bow? Reaching out, he took Tony's wrist gently. "Stay here."
"Aside from the fact that I hate that I'm lying to Steve and the others about your lack of knowledge on what we've been doing? We're going to need your help." Tony heard a car pull up and he rolled to his feet, stepping over to the window to peek out, expecting to see Sams car and the others getting out.
"Lunch. With my mother and my brother." It was the exact same thing he told Tony. "I was supposed to have lessons with my mother in the afternoon but I was tired. I napped and then I was in the cell."
"Let me guess, you want me to build you something." It was Afghanistan all over again. Hell, it was Killian all over again. What would it be this time? Another weapon? An Extremis like virus?
(In a way that was true. Professor Hulk, dubbed so by Banner himself, had been a good part of the last five years so seeing one or the other was now the new odd for Steve.)
"Fine. We'll be in touch Captain. Good luck with this team of yours. I'll see what we can find on our end regarding Stark."
"--Natasha. Clint. Bruce. Thor. Sam. Fury. Harley. I am Iron Man." He gave the kid a small grateful smile before repeating it another few times without fail. Then he was pulling the watch out. He turned it over in his hands, looking it over curiously. He knew there was something important about this watch.
"Loki's right. We can figured this out after we get Tony. JARVIS, pull up the area. Loki couldn't have come from too far."
Tony in turn, slid at Steve's side, listening to him suck in a breath. His hands moved, gently brushing over his bruised and beaten face before he caught sight of the blood coming through his suit. Blue eyes fluttered, staring up at him dazed.
"I understand that Stark is a billionaire but I don't think he's going to be happy if he comes back to worn out floors Steve."
"There is Heimdall but with the bifrost still in repair it is harder to get word back home. I swore not to return without Loki and I--"
Tony helped him to his feet and he happened to look up just in time to bring his shield up and protect them both from another shot. They both turned and he could hear Tony suck in a sharp breath. Standing between them and the elevator, gun in hand, mask covering the lower half of his face, was the Winter Soldier.
As for his team, he had them going over the information they'd gathered to find bases that HYDRA could be using to hide in. With the staff gone again, he at least had an idea of where to look. The last time they found it, it was in Sokovia but that was in 2015. They weren't supposed to come across it for another
