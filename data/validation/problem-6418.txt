Tony climbs onto the chair straddling him, his thumbs running along his jaw. “Never. You hear me Steve? I will never be bored with you.” Then he kisses him slowly and softly. “You are the love of my life and best friend Steve and your happiness means more than my own so if you want to teach again you should do that.” He whispers against Steve’s lips
David yanked him up by his shirt and throws him onto the floor, making Tony hit the back of his head. Then the kick to his side came. “Why do you always ruin our good time?!” He shouts kicking Tony again.
“Take it off whenever you are ready.” Tony assures him and ruffles his hair softly and lets his thumb and index finger traces the shell of his ear and return to the tub of lotion. Tony start to rub the lotion into his back starting at his shoulders and working down to his mid back and lower back in circular motions and Steve moans softly by the gentle motions. Tony takes some more and put some on his butt and thighs. “So you got what you wanted tonight?” Tony wonders softly.
“Up.” Tony orders him and lets go of the hair and Steve gets up on stiff legs and feels the blood rushing down to his legs again as he awaits the next order from Tony. It quiet between them and Steve take a moment to admire his boyfriend. Black slacks, the leather belt holding them up, the black shoes and his black shirt unbuttoned at the top showing of the tan skin there and the sleeves rolled up to his elbows, his facial hair trimmed to perfection and his hair the right amount of messy and a look he knew Steve loved on him and it just oozed power and control from him. “Hands.” The orders were short and direct. Something they figured out that they both liked. Without hesitation he holds them out and the handcuffs were around his wrists, the metal ones with the longer chain between them he noted. They hurt more he added as an afterthought exactly what he wanted for tonight.
“Yes sir. I love it. Thank you.” Tony ruffles his hair and sits down on the chair beside him, his fingers still touching the collar. He belonged to Tony and nothing could change that. No-one could take him away from Tony. He feels Tony’s lips on the top of his head. He tilts his head up and their eye’s meet for a moment before Tony leans in and kisses him slowly. He tasted like coffee and chocolate he notes as he lets Tony’s tongue discover his mouth. When they break apart Steve whimpers softly missing the touch of Tony.
“Yeah but David didn’t like that… He felt ignored and he thought I lied… I mean I knew he was insecure because people had cheated on him in the past…” Tony explains as if he was defending David, like what had happened between them was a normal relationship and everyone went through it. God did he want to get up and kick David’s ass and make sure he never took a breath again.
Steve could feel Tony’s mouth on the inside of his legs leaving a trail of wet kisses in its wake he skipped his rear and continued the trail up his back to his neck letting a hand sneak in between his legs and touch the perineum with soft fingers making Steve groan in pleasure and his erection standing straight up. There was no hiding that he liked this. He felt Tony’s chuckles vibrate through him before he stops abruptly. “What is your safe word sweetheart?” Tony questions. Like he always did before they got into the main act of their play.
Steve shakes his head trying to think of something. “The hamper is in the corner so you don’t have to put your dirty clothes on the floor, you can just take four steps and put it in there.” Steve suggests with a small laugh and Tony just hums before they meet in a soft kiss.
Tony focused on the floor not meeting his eyes. “David…” He whispers. “We fought and it got out of hand.” He ads.
As he was showering away all his feeling David went to the living room and saw Tony’s phone laying on the floor along with his wallet. He place the wallet on the coffee table and is about to do the same with the phone but he sees that he had texts from both Steve and Pepper. He slides the phone open and reads the text.
“Take these...” Steve hands him the clothing before picking things out for himself. “Like I said take the bed and I’ll be on the couch. If you need anything just wake me up alright?” Steve informs Tony who just nods before Steve moves out of the room and close the door behind him and he barley moves from the door until he hear the click of the door locking. Unlike before they would share a bed before without any trouble. Fighting about who stole the cover and who took up the most space. But that was long gone now. He moved slowly to the couch and got comfortable there trying to fall asleep.
“Y-yyes.. I-I oh--- can.. d-do ooh that…” He moans out. This was going to be hard but he would do everything in his power to follow orders. Tony chuckles and pulls his fingers out of Steve and he doesn’t know how he feels about it, happy so that he could follow orders or sad because of the lost touch. He feels a hand on his hip pushing him slightly forward or as much as possible in this position, before he feels something being pushed into him again.
“Sorry about that.” Tony says as his arms wrap around Steve’s waist and Tony rests his head between the shoulder blades.
His breath got caught in his throat. How could he possibly choose? “Can I have both?” He asks quietly and Tony just chuckles.
“Almost done sweetheart.” Tony promised him. He just nods because he was not allowed to speak unless he was an asked a question. He focuses all his attention on sitting completely straight while Tony completed his work and played with his hair. He wanted to do good for Tony. That’s why they did this. So he for a few hours could focus on Tony completely and just making sure he makes Tony happy, so for a few hours he could forget that he was Captain America and the world counted on him to save it whenever it was in danger, so he could forget that the Avengers counted on him to make every decision and it was his responsibility whatever the outcome was. It was nice to just take orders for once and forget the responsibility he has. He was never scared or worried, Tony would never hurt him more then he wanted or put him in harm’s way besides Tony never did anything to him he hadn’t consented to beforehand even if Steve wanted to be surprised he knew Tony would never go outside his limits. And today he wanted to hurt.
“I’m gonna go change since you already did. Can you watch him?” Tony nodded and Steve hurried back down the hall. Tony showed Indy each of the balloons and tried a party hat on him but he kept pulling it off to look at it.
They entered Indy’s room and could see him curled up in the middle of the bed, thumb in his mouth and arm wrapped around his teddy bear. Steve walked up to the bed and gently pulled the blanket back off of the small body. He reached his hands under his sons armpits and slowly lifted him up. The bear fell back to the bed and Steve brought Indy to his chest, one arm under his bottom and the other around his back, holding him close. The boys eyes stayed closed but he instinctively curled into Steve’s warmth. Steve kissed the top of his head. He walked back to Tony who was lingering at the foot of the bed.
“He told me what happened this morning and I agree with his assessment of the situation and what he told you. Your body is basically confused from four days of doing something different, bathroom wise, on top of losing the effects of the serum. You’ll be fine in no time, I have no doubts about that,” he said, smiling kindly.
“We had a moment trying to get here. I yelled at him, he bit me. We both apologized to each other. It’s fine now,” Bucky waved Steve off.
“Okay, Indy.” Steve said. “No bath right now. We’re just going to have breakfast, okay?” He’d have that fight after when they had no choice. He got and grabbed a box of cereal, milk and bowls for him and Tony, hoping to distract Indy. “Eat up,” he said to his son as he slid a bowl to Tony. They poured their own cereal and ate while helping Indy get oatmeal into his mouth.
Tony sighed. “I know.” Steve fidgeted with the drawstring of Tony’s pajama pants. “He can stay for now.” Steve’s head snapped up. “In your old rooms. And I don’t want to talk to him,” Tony continued. “I don’t even want to see him and I don’t care if that sounds childish. I can’t. I just can’t right now. We’ll just see what happens, go from there,” Tony trailed off.
Steve, Peter and Natasha were now sitting in the living room with cups of coffee, watching the livestream and waiting for the message that they hoped came through soon. Steve paced.
“Sorry,” Tony said weakly as Steve removed the towel to dry him thoroughly. “I’m just so tired,” he whimpered.
“Yeah, I got you a birthday present,” Bucky said, readjusting him in his arms so he was sitting on the mans hip. “You might not know what that is but it’s for you.” He slid the bag closer so Indy could reach. Indy looked up at him.
“Looks worse than it is,” Bucky said quickly. “You’ll be fine.” Tony didn’t seem convinced. Bucky sat up all the way this time and removed Tony’s hand from his shirt. “Hold on a sec, I’m not leaving.” He reached over to the discarded clothes grabbing one of adult Tony’s socks and then turned back to the boy. “I’m going to tie this around your cut okay? To keep the dirt out.” Tony nodded. Bucky tied the sock around the kids leg, he was able to knot it without any issue because the boy was so small. The bleeding had mostly stopped so he didn’t need a tourniquet, just a loose pressure to keep it from opening again.  “There.”
“I told you I wouldn’t lecture you but you should rest for awhile. If it helps I can offer you a baby to cuddle?” Bucky smirked as he picked Poppy up from her mat and held her out for Tony to see. Tony laughed then groaned as the pain in side surged. Bucky winced but Tony held his arm out on his uninjured side and beckoned for him to put Poppy there.
“Uh, okay,” he took the wooden board puzzle and ripped the plastic covering off of it then dumped the large wooden shapes off the board onto the table, then put the board down in front of the boy. “You gotta match the animals to their shape on the board to put them back.” Indy picked up a dog shape and held it out to Bucky.
Indy popped the ‘P’ sound with his mouth but just made a smacking noise. Both men laughed. “Pa pa,” Tony said again slower.
“Thank you,” Tony mumbled against his shoulder. “Thank you for saving him, thank you, thank you,” he kept repeating.
Bucky nodded quickly but the stopped abruptly to look at Steve. “No. I can’t. She should- um, I’m sorry,” he stuttered out. “I have to,” he gestured to the elevator and started to walk away.
“Tony da,” Indy replied simply with his limited vocabulary. He grabbed Tony’s finger in his small hand and held on to it.
“Says his name is Liam,” Steve read. “Oh my god,” he exclaimed with a laugh. “His middle name is Anthony.” Steve shoved the paper at Tony who took it with an annoyed look shot at Steve. Tony gave the paper a cursory glance and then turned his attention to Indy, pulling the boy into his lap.
Tony wanted to argue but knew he was right. “At least let me come to your command center. I’ll wait til they find him but I wanna be there when it happens to help.” Fury sighed. He knew he couldn’t stop Tony Stark once he made up his mind.
“I don’t know, I just.. I came across someone years ago, as the soldier, and her name was Poppy. It was just in passing but the name stuck with me,” he answered.
“Poppy. Her names Poppy.” Bucky looked up at his friend with a lopsided smile. “I’ve been thinking about what to name her since we found out she was mine. I wasn’t even sure I’d be best to keep her but I couldn’t stop thinking of names.”
After a few minutes JARVIS announced that Steve had finished his story so they went to join him in Indy’s room. The little boy was tucked into his toddler bed with the new reindeer on one side and his llama on the other. His teddy bear up next to his pillow keeping watch.
“I love you too, Tater Tot. So much.” Tony pressed a kiss into the boys blonde hair. Steve let them have their moment and then put his hand on Indy’s back.
“Now, Indy. You remember what Daddy and I talked to you about last night? You’re going to talk to a new friend today.” The young boy was sitting on the bed in his parents bedroom while Steve finished up the buttons on his new button up shirt. Indy nodded in response. Steve looked at his son who sat there in his new shirt with his hair parted on the side, still slightly damp, looking like a little man. Steve smiled and blinked back the tears that had sprung to his eyes. “You look good, sweetheart,” Steve told him, cupping his cheek. Indy smiled up at him.
Tony was a harmless flirt, Natasha had said. He flirted with everything that breathed because it was safe, never meaning anything by it or expecting anything to come from it. He always got flustered when it was reciprocated.
Tony remembered his face contorted beyond recognition, the silver edge of the shield swinging down like a guillotine. A tremor ran far underground, through his heart and his words.
This was not going the way Steve had expected. He had seen Tony flustered before, but he was always able to cover it up quickly, either by appearing cool and collected or by managing to divert everyone’s attention while he tried to recover. He had never seen Tony like this.
“That was him, wasn’t it?” Bucky asked, and Steve didn’t have to ask him how he knew. He had been there when his words came in after all, and whatever Bucky said about not being the same person anymore, he knew Steve, would always know him no matter how much things changed.
He was feeble, half-liquid, half-solid; his skin had turned gelatinous, and he pushed through the barrier with ease, spilling out everywhere, spreading thinly across the floor like he exerted himself too much just by talking to Steve.
His fingers slipped on the clasps. He paused, his palms sticky and clammy with sweat, until he heard the unmistakable clang of vibranium hitting metal and the dying gurgle of a Chitauri soldier. He was hyperaware of his surroundings, staying as motionless as possible to pick up on the most minute of sounds coming from outside. More scuffling, more blows traded. But he could hear screeches and nothing else, no shout of pain from Steve, and that meant that Steve was holding down the fort as well as he could. The noise had died down significantly; there were fewer Chitauri out there.
“You’re going to eat a good meal,” Steve told him slowly. “You’re going to relax with me and you’re going to do what I say. Okay?”  Tony nodded against Steve’s chest. “Good boy,” Steve whispered into Tony’s hair and the other man shivered. Steve pet Tony’s hair for a few minutes allowing the other man to fully give in to his sub mindset. When he felt the pressure of Tony melting further into him he figured he could bring him upstairs. “Can you sit up for me, sweetheart?”
“I help,” Indy said loudly, bouncing on his knees on the sofa, renewed with energy after his short nap. Steve laughed, walking forward and scooping Indy up into his arms, knowing the baby would rather stay with Tony anyway.
“Yeah. We’re all safe. Why don’t you close your eyes and rest, sweetheart. We’ll be right here with you.” Indy nodded but then sat up. He held the llama out toward Bucky.
“I need you to, you need to leave,” Tony replied as he rocked back and forth with Luca tightly in his grip.
A nurse came in a few minutes later and took the forms. She disconnected the machines and took out the IV. She gave a few last minute instructions and then left them to assist Steve.
Tony paused to really look at Steve and smiled. “I love you too.” He clapped his hands together breaking the moment. “Okay, come on. Time to get out.” He helped Steve dry off, wrap the towel around his waist, and walk to their bedroom. He found the coziest pajamas he could find and got him dressed. “All right, in you go,” he gestured to the bed.
“Across the way here is diapers and stuff,” Tony pointed and Steve followed him. Steve grabbed 3 large packages of diapers, wipes and baby powder and then found Tony further down the aisle looking at the potty training seats. “This one looks good,” he told Steve once he reached him. Steve nodded. Tony picked the box off the shelf and piled it in their cart as well. Indy whined a little and looked at Tony.
Steve pet Tony’s head and Tony melted into him. “It’s just loud noise and bright light, it’s not going to hurt you.” Tony didn’t look so sure. “You wanna sleep here with me tonight?” Tony nodded so quickly it was obvious that’s what he was waiting for. Steve smiled and got comfortable. “Close your eyes, I’ve got you,” he whispered over the top of Tony’s head. “Good night, Tony. You’re safe here, don’t worry.”
Steve picked up his son and they took the elevator to their floor and Steve went straight to the corner to put Indy in his time out chair. “You’re gonna stay here until one of us comes and get you,” Steve said and ignored the little hand reaching to grab him before he walked away.
“Sorry, Mr. Rogers, but your phone buzzed and I saw that it was Tony so I figured I’d answer,” Peter rambled. Steve smiled.
“Sergeant Barnes,” FRIDAY interrupted. “Happy is going to meet you in the car downstairs in 3 minutes. He said he’ll drop you off and then come back here with the kids.”
“Perfect, Tony,” Steve smiled and Tony beamed at the praise. Steve took the peppers and put them in the salad bowl he had prepared before. “Drink your tea,” he ordered kindly as he sat next to him. Tony took a small sip but winced at the temperature. Steve chuckled. “Maybe when it cools a bit.” He took his own mug and blew on it carefully. “I made us lasagna,” Steve added. “It’ll be done soon.”
“Before we left the hospital when you were changing your clothes in the bathroom. The nurse came in and he hadn’t burped for me yet and she showed me a different way to hold him.” Steve brought Luca up into the cradle of his arms and kissed his forehead.
“Have you met you when there are kids nearby?” Steve asks with a gentle laugh. “You are so good with them hell you got all our friends kids interested in science, do you know how mush Clint hates you for it? Nat’s and Bruce’s daughter is attending college to become an engineer because you spent hours with her down in your lab.” Tony shrugs like it was no big deal. And to him it wasn’t he was just sharing his knowledge that was his passion and if rubbed off on the kids he was happy.
“You are not crazy though it was him that tricked and played with your thoughts and emotions.” Steve offers softly. “And now when he is out of your life you can begin to heal and recover.” Tony is quiet and looks straight ahead as the sun was rising outside the window. A new day rising Steve thought to himself. A new day with promises of something better coming along. Which was exactly what Tony needed after these years of hell.
Tony nods. Steve lets out a breath. Good he knows he means well and is only looking out for his best friend. “I know Steve. But I have a good feeling about him.” And Tony was smiling that goofy smile again he was certain he had when he talked about Tony with Bucky. “I am actually seeing him tonight again. He is taking me out to an Italian place.” Steve is informed.
Reluctantly he gets out of the bed and into the shower. Letting the water run over his body and wash away some of the sorrow and pain, it still clung to his body like a second skin but it felt a bit easier. When he was done he looked over the sink where Tony’s things were still in the same place as he left them. He should put that into boxes and give away he thinks but moves his eyes away from the sink and took a towel before moving back into the bedroom and to his dresser and takes out clean clothes for the first time in months it feels like.
“Can I take you to the hospital? I would like for someone to look at your ribs.” Steve asks gently and Tony just looks at him expecting something to happen. But Steve stays on his edge and waits for Tony’s decision but he just shakes his head, Steve isn’t surprised. “Can I look at them? I just want to make sure nothing is damaged.” He assures the brunette. Again he shakes his head. Okay then. “You want anything to drink? I can make coffee if you want.” He offers again and Tony seems to think long and hard about it. He was probably wondering what the consequences would be if he said yes. Or no for that matter.
When he enters the kitchen he sees Tony making breakfast and as usual when they have had a scene he makes a lot of food. Bacon, scrambled eggs, toast, pancakes, fresh squeezed juice and coffee. Without saying a word he goes up to Tony and hugs him from the side and hides his face into his shoulder breathing him in. “Hey there…” Tony greets and places an awkward angled kiss on his head.
Tony moves away for a moment and is back with the spreader bar. “On all four, on the table.” He orders and Steve obeys. Tony spreads his legs wider before wrapping the leather cuff around his ankles, putting a finger in between the cuff and his ankle making sure they weren’t too tight. “You have to rest on your shoulders so I can tie up your hands.” Steve does as he told and rests his head on the table and puts his arms between his legs so Tony could tie him up completely. He was completely on display for Tony, who could do whatever he wanted with him. The feeling of complete helplessness made his cock twitch to life again. “Color sweetheart?” Tony asks and drags a hand over his spine as he moves to the front.
“I am ready sir!” It was all Tony needed the leather hit him at once. The burning was almost unbearable, he wants to get away but he can’t his entire backside was at Tony’s mercy. The leather hits again but this time on the other side. Only 28 to go he thinks distantly trying to encourage himself.. He cries out when Tony smacks him twice in a row on the same place. His butt must be a new shade of red he thinks. Tony’s rough hand touches where he have hit Steve with the leather and lets the heat sink in for a moment.
When he arrived at the cemetery he saw his friends waiting for him. “You didn’t all have to come…” He says as he comes closer to them.
“Of course! I would like to meet him to!” Oh god what a complete lie, but he would do just about anything to see Tony smile even if it meant meeting his new boyfriend. Steve is almost surprised when Tony lit up and leans to the side to wave someone over. He turns around and sees the older man.
His name was Steve Grant Rogers he was 24 doing his last year in law school and he was absolute perfection. He was kind and sweet making sure Tony always made it home safely and texted and called whenever his tight schedule allowed him to, supported him when he decided to set up his own company focusing on green energy. Tony never understood why a great guy like Steve would want to hang around a screw up like Tony but he would keep him around as long as he wanted to stay which seemed to be for a long time because he met his parents. His mother who was as sweet as his own mother had been; she had loved him from the first moment they met and told stories about Steve when he was younger making the blonde blush and the brunette chuckle. His father asked him about the company and about his childhood. His brother Clint made sure to make a fool of Steve making everyone laugh. He was welcomed into the family he always wanted.
It was just a few of the voicemails David had deleted from Tony’s phone over the last few months, he usually hid Tony's phone so he coudln't take it to work or he simply took it with him to work and just placing it back on the bed side table when Tony was looking for it.
“I’ll be right here, buddy. Just like every other time. I’m not going to leave. I’m going to clean you while you play with your duckies and then I’ll take you out.” Steve knelt down beside the tub and put Indy’s feet in the water and then gently pried his arms from around his neck and helped him sit. He dropped the ducks into the water in front of Indy but he was too upset to care at the moment. “Calm down, you’re okay.”
Steve placed the tray down on the coffee table near the sofa and scooped a large helping into one bowl and brought it over to Bucky, placing the bowl on the table and putting the fork in his good hand.
“You can do it, I’m just making it easier. There,” Steve said once it was laying down with the opening facing the boy. Indy pulled out a a piece of tissue paper and then tried to grab the stack of gifts all at once. “One at a time, buddy.” Indy pulled out a flat wooden square with colorful pieces on the front and looked up at his Papa for an explanation. “That’s a puzzle, sweetheart. So you can learn your colors. You take all these pieces out then put them back in the right spots and each one has a different color on it. That’ll be fun,” Steve told him and while Indy was distracted he took the rest of the puzzle stack out of the bag so Indy could look through them.
The boy snuffled in his sleep as he napped against Bucky, temporarily drawing everyone’s attention.  Bucky patted the boys bottom where his hand was resting absently and the boy quieted but his eyes blinked open slowly.
Bucky was sitting on the sofa with Indy on his lap, the boys back against Bucky’s chest and his legs spread on either side of the mans thighs. Bucky had his hands resting around Indy’s waist and the boy had the llama still gripped in his hand and he looked like he was telling a story about it, waving it back and forth and making excited noises. Bucky nodded along agreeably as if he understood what the little boy was saying.
“Sure,” Tony smiled. Indy had one arm wrapped around Tony’s thigh and he was sucking his thumb on the other with his head tilted against Tony.
“I don’t remember all the details of everything I’ve done as the Winter Soldier. I will usually remember something if I’m reminded of what happened but there’s a lot of shit that I did and I’ve been wiped clean so many times,” he trailed off. “Anyway, before I went to that Hydra base I didn’t remember the info that’s in that folder but once I read it it all came back to me.” He took a deep breath, letting it out slowly. “I was going to tell you about it, Tony, the next morning after I got here but you were upset then and I didn’t want to add to that. And then its just been so much with Indy I didn’t want to ruin all this for you guys. And honestly I didn’t want to leave him yet. But then Steve asked me to move in and I just, I want that. I do. But that can’t happen.”
“Wow, that’s the coolest shirt I’ve ever seen, Peanut,” he exclaimed. “And look at you speaking full sentences.” He kissed his cheek. Steve smiled at the pair of them and then gently pulled Indy’s pants off quickly swapping them for a new pair in a size 2T.
“I know. How about you walk me up to Papa and we drop a few petals on the way, huh?” Indy looked unsure but sort of shrugged so Tony took that as good enough and picked him up. He adjusted him so he was sitting on his hip and he could hold the basket up for the boy with his other hand. “Okay, let’s do this. Go on, drop some flowers quick,” Tony said as he started walking and Indy grabbed 2 hands worth and started sprinkling them in front of Tony’s feet as he slowly moved forward.
“They got separated. Natasha made it back to the meet up and Steve hasn’t.” He pushed past Bucky and crouched down next to Indy’s seat.
Steve smirked then leaned down and kissed the top of his head. “You’re gonna be okay,” he told him. “Indy has a gift for you. You wanna say hi to daddy and give him his present?”
“I got him,” he said as soon as Tony answered his cell. He couldn’t help his sigh of relief and he all but fell back into the sofa cushions.
“With no product,” Steve clarified. “It’s soft. And fluffy.” He fixed a stray piece behind Tony’s ear and then leaned in to kiss him softly on the lips.
“I get that this is a difficult situation,” Steve said carefully. “But maybe you can start slow. Spend some time with her. Even if it’s with me or Tony.”
“Get out,” Tony yelled this time. Luca whimpered. “I need space and you just won’t stop. Please. Please just go,” Tony cried, his face still pressed to the side of his sons. Tony heard a rustling sound, Steve had moved, so Tony opened his eyes to see if he left. Steve had dropped down to his knees in front of Tony’s chair.
“I’m sorry I broke things and yelled.” Tony sniffled and let out a small sob. Steve scooped him up in a big hug.
“That’s not very nice.” And then it clicked. Something triggered Tony into worrying that Steve would take the boy away. “Indy, what did you say to Daddy before I got down here?” Indy rolled himself over so he was face down on the sofa but kept a hand on Steve’s leg, pushing against it. “Tony, come here.” Tony’s head snapped up but whatever he’d been feeling he shut down to hide from his boyfriend.
“Tony, I’m not mad that Indy called you da, if that’s what you’re worried about. God, who knows the horror that kid has been through so far in his short life and this is only his second day with us. If he likes you and trusts you enough already to want to call you da then that makes me happy, Tony.” Steve ran his hand through Tony’s hair. “If you just don’t want to be his dad, with me, then that’s another story. Obviously, I’m not trying to force this on you. This was sudden and unexpected and we do need to have a discussion about us in relation to him,” Steve trailed off. Tony’s breathing had returned to normal and he was slumped against Steve.
Tony stopped in the middle of the storm to watch Steve from a distance. With no one paying him any attention and Steve deep in concentration as he conversed with Wilson and Natasha, he allowed himself the luxury to scan every inch of Steve, to memorize his face and preserve him exactly the way he was in his mind. This was how he wanted to remember Steve—in his element, seeming to thrum with more energy than he had had in days now that he could actively try to stop Thanos, alert, focused, and unhurt.
“You know as much as I do that it’s not about knowing what words the other person has,” Rhodey said pointedly. “Even if your word was something completely different, what it comes down to is the work and meeting your soulmate halfway. You kept your end of the bargain. He hasn’t.” He nodded at the letter. “Although maybe he’s trying. Too late and in some obtuse way, knowing him, but it’s up to you to decide whether it’s enough.”
Howard hadn’t said anything then, just thinned his lips in sour distaste as he saw Tony’s wrist, but he didn’t need to; his disdain had been palpable, thick and overbearing like the stench of whiskey that remained long after he had left the room. And then he had spit it out later, when he could let loose because Tony's mother wasn’t there to intervene, to shame him into behaving.
Time stopped. Reality stopped. He was on the battlefield and somewhere else altogether. Somewhere no one else existed but him. There and everywhere. Everywhere and nowhere.
He tore his gaze away from the throw. “Yeah, everything’s okay. Other than some space titan trying to wipe out half the universe, but you know.”
“Never understood how you could’ve,” Steve said, putting those thoughts aside to focus on the here and now, on Tony. “Bucky, I get, but you...”
He had hated how Tony looked, his megawatt smile flickering before turning bright again, but awkward and pasted on this time.
“Because Patsy and Kate were ready to murder Brian for it! And it got all weird when Otto joined!” Jan’s eyes grew as big as saucers. “Oh my God,” she said breathlessly, “did you think he was auctioning himself off?”
There were distortions in the fabric of the memory, the indistinct outlines of the lab bench bleeding through, the murmurs of the Avengers rustling behind him in the snow three decades before they had been voiced.
Briefly, Tony considered lying, of veering the conversation away from Steve, but there wasn’t any point of doing so. He was at Steve’s desk, the phone in plain sight and the letter open on his lap.
It wasn’t like they were at each other’s throats either. No one could complain about their behavior. He made sure to be civil. There wasn’t any room for fighting when Thanos loomed on the horizon, threatening to rain down punishment any day now. More Outriders had popped up, higher-ranked ones. It was only a matter of time.
They were the only ones who stayed up this late or woke up this early this often, but somehow Tony hadn’t thought of that when he headed to the gym.
“I don’t need you,” he wanted to say, but he smiled and said nothing, and maybe that was answer enough.
If he couldn’t extract Tony from himself, he would sow himself in Tony, growing and killing and eventually consuming him whole. What he had for Tony would bloom like tumors in him, a constant reminder that never let him forget what he had done to Steve.
Tony washed the mug, dried it, and shoved it to the back of a cabinet. Tossed the throw into Steve’s room and didn’t pay attention to the colored pencils Steve had laid out on the desk, the sketchbook he had always been so curious about but never brought up, the first edition copy of
And yet his body responded not to logic but to the primitive part of his brain—the part that had only enough disk space to collect sensations and register pain, to store muscle memory.
He could see it too, that universe. It was one where no one made mistakes, where everyone was alive, happy, and whole.
“You could’ve just asked me for a date, you know,” Tony continued, completely unaware of Steve’s internal crisis. He was still smiling—but there had been a subtle undercurrent of nervousness below the surface of his words too, taut as invisible wire, making him sound less flirty than shy and making Steve recall a conversation that he had overheard some time ago.
“The serum amplifies everything inside,” he had explained, “So good becomes great; bad becomes worse.”
“I’m glad you’re not hurt,” Steve said, and Tony was stuck between replying in kind and wanting to punch him.
Steve sought Tony in the aftermath, bright and happy as though reborn. She had never seen him like that before in all the years she had known him.
It was so easy to pretend it was a normal lazy Saturday afternoon from bygone days. There were no clouds in the sky and back then, they would have taken advantage of the balmy weather to cook outdoors, content to sit back and relax for once. No world to save, their biggest worry Vision burning patties on the grill.
“You made it through,” he says shakily. Carol powers down, dimming their surroundings, but his eyes are still bright, wet with moonlight and unshed emotion.
But they welcomed them back, and just like Jim didn’t hesitate to embrace her, Pepper doesn’t as she places her hand over Natasha’s on her shoulder and holds onto her. It’s invaluable, this level of forgiveness and acceptance into their circle and Tony’s, this trust. Natasha doesn’t know if it’s earned, but she’ll do everything she can so that it is and that she can keep it regardless.
Steve had propped himself up against rubble, only a few feet to his right. His eyes were shut, and he was too pale, almost waxy, as if all of his blood had drained out of him.
He looked at Bucky, who held his gaze steadily, cautiously, and remembered the day his words had appeared. He remembered the way he had been so excited to show them to his mother, the way he had asked her what she thought they meant and she had told him, happier than he had ever seen her be, that someone loved him very much.
“No one would have minded. Everyone knows you give the best gifts. Sometimes when we don’t ask for any and you don’t need to.” He paused. “A lot of times, actually,” he added.
Tony glanced over his shoulder. Through the entrance, he could see Steve taking out four opponents, five. Six. Steve was fine. Whereas he had been starting to flag before they had seized the Gauntlet, he was a man made anew by hope and fury.
He watched as everyone around him refused to stay down, as they did what they always did, no matter if there didn’t seem to be any way out, no matter if it seemed that all hope was lost. They kept fighting.
“Upset?” Tony smiled, and Steve was relieved to see that it was genuine, absent of anything Tony would try to hide when it wasn’t.
He would never dare to imagine this anyway, to let go like this even when he was asleep. It would destroy him more completely than anything else could.
Winter thawed. He was a frozen river finally shattered, everything pouring out of him through the cracks of the icy surface, overflowing.
“I do have a thing for older men. But I mean it.” Tony’s voice sounded faded now, an echo of a memory. “Make a life for yourself here. For me.”
“I’ve had nothing to do but think about this for the past few years. Kind of dulls the fear a bit when you’re like this for so long.”
The question landed between Tony’s shoulder blades, a fragile whisper of gossamer silk connecting him to Steve. One sudden move, he knew, and it would rip. It would slide down his back like water and float to the ground, leaving Steve unmoored.
“Just like old times,” Tony almost said, but they were too aware of the way it wasn’t, too sad about that for him to say it, and he didn’t want Steve to know that he couldn’t sleep anyway.
The last thought he had in the hazy interim before unconsciousness was that he had gotten it wrong in the end. He never got to meet his soulmate.
, for this breathtaking commission! I’m stunned at how you captured the emotions of this moment so perfectly that I’m a little verklempt (also a little verklempt seeing “So was I” in Tony’s handwriting on Steve’s wrist after thinking about it for so long; thank you for putting up with all the details I threw your way and for all the research you put in to make this. It’s incredible). I had this scene in my head for months while working on LPAYS, and this is exactly how I imagined it. Thank you, thank you, thank you.<3
Speaking of cyborg BFFs, he should get to T’Challa and his impressive wunderkind sister. Shuri was only feet away from him, torn between being not as enamored with his tech as he would have assumed she would be—and he wasn’t sure whether he was more delighted or affronted by that—and excited by all the superheroes gathered in the room like any kid. Barnes was, thankfully, nowhere near them; what bafflingly seemed to be an irascible talking raccoon was accosting him near the bar.
In the radiant glow of Carol’s light as she descends to Earth a few feet away like a falling star, Natasha can see that he’s been crying silently this entire time.
His muscles were tensed as though he anticipated a fight, his breathing erratic. He hated the way that Steve always got under his skin and made him act like this, much as he tried not to show Steve how much he got to him. He wondered if this was what Steve came for, if that was the only way Steve remembered how to act around him. He didn’t want to deal with this.
“So good sweetheart. Such a good boy for me.” Tony praises and he soaks it all in and he can feel Tony’s mouth leaving a trail of  wet kisses up to his neck and softly start touching his perineum again. “Now I am going to fuck you.”
“Of course I am happy Steve. I have the life I always wanted but never dared to dream about.” He takes a pause before asking. “Are you happy?” Steve nods.
“Tony..” He groans. Neither of them cared that he had said his name instead of sir, they were so wrapped up in the pleasure of finally having sex after an entire night of being pushed closer and closer to the edge.
Steve looked at his family and felt as happy as one could be, he had an amazing husband who was wearing his usual ripped jeans, black long-sleeved shirt and a t-shirt with a band Steve had never heard of and a wonderful son who was in his pajamas. Charlie wiggles out of Tony’s lap and runs over to Steve who easily picks him up; he is a super soldier after all. “Hey buddy! You missed me?” He questions the boy nods to Steve who just smiles and place a kiss on the chubby cheek. “And I missed you to!”
“And as far as I am concerned I have not allowed you to go to Japan! How long will you be gone?! Who are you going with and who are you seeing? I can’t let you leave for another country without some warning. You know that I don’t handle you leaving well!” David calms down to a whisper and sits down on a chair.
“Yeah great…” Tony echoes in a empty voice. “I am just going to take a shower alright?” He doesn’t wait for an answer he just slips into the bathroom and locks the door behind him as he starts the shower with scolding hot water that he hoped would wash away the feelings of shame and guilt.
Tony bites his lower lip before answering. “Had some prototypes for RD.” He whispers. Before he couldn’t make Tony shut up about his prototypes and his future ideas now he had to drag the answers out of the brunette.
“Uh-huh and you were right, I think it made him feel better.” Bucky looked back at Steve with a glare but shook his head, biting back the smile.
“We can’t have you running around half naked,” Steve replied kindly but Tony still got a look like he had done something wrong. Bucky unbuckled himself now that they were in the air and took off his hoodie.
“You were behaving badly, but there’s a difference between being bad and doing something bad.” Steve tilted Tony’s face until he was making eye contact again. “You are good, Tony. You’re my good boy. I promise,” he added when Tony seemed reluctant to believe it.
“I’m sorry you had to go through that, that’s awful,” Tony answered kindly. He started wiping down Steve’s chest.
Steve stepped over to his friend. “Buck, she’s good. She’s gonna get better in no time.” He rubbed circles on Bucky’s back, hoping to provide some comfort because Bucky looked beyond stressed at the moment. Steve waited for a response so Bucky finally nodded. “Why don’t you go give her the bath you were about to do, let her relax a little and calm down, huh?”
"Thank you for saying it, but, I get that you were controlled by Hydra. Doesn't make it okay, but..." Tony trailed off and shrugged. Bucky felt a mixture of relief for finally apologizing and confusion at Tonys understanding. Tony picked up a screwdriver and pried a small piece of metal back to get a better look at the damage. Bucky winced.
They ate their dinner in comfortable silence and after Steve led them to the sofa. “We’re going to watch some TV and relax,” Steve told him as he turned the TV on. “Sit next to me.”  Steve sat and Tony followed, snuggling up to Steve as soon as he lifted his arm to allow space for Tony to crawl into. Steve smiled. “Can you pull the blanket over us?” He asked, giving Tony short, easy commands to follow. Tony reached and pulled a throw blanket off the back of the sofa and spread it over his and Steve’s laps. “Good, thank you.” Steve brought the arm he had around Tony up so that he could wind his fingers through the soft curls on the back of his head. Tony moaned at the feeling, putting his head down further to allow Steve more access. “That’s it,” Steve praised. “Just relax.”
“You are okay. I promise. You’re safe. I’m right here and Daddy’s right down the hall. We’ll do this quick.” He picked up a purple duck and placed it in Indy’s hand then got some baby body wash on a washcloth and started to clean Indy’s face and neck. “Can you show me how he swims in the water?” Steve asked when Indy didn’t move to play with the toy. Indy sniffled and gasped in a breath but he put the duck onto the surface of the water and moved it back and forth. Steve smiled. “Wow, he’s a good swimmer. He must really like the water,” Steve added. Indy whimpered.
"Tony," Steve started, expecting to be shut down but Tony stayed quiet. Bucky put his hand on Tony's shoulder and rubbed his thumb there for a second before dropping it back to his own lap. "I'm so sorry. I hate myself for how I treated you. Everything I did, none of that should have happened and I certainly should never have physically hurt you." Steve took a deep breath and continued. "I could have killed you. Almost did, and there's no excuse for that. I can't...I don't even know how it came to that, Tony. I'm so fucking sorry, I miss you so much." Steve's voice broke as he finished that sentence. "You might not ever want to see me again after you finish with his arm, and I wouldn't blame you for that. But, regardless of what happens from now on I promise I will never hurt you again. And I really am truly sorry." Steve swiped the back of his hand against the tears that threatened to spill from his own eyes.
“Well, I don’t mind but what bad behavior? Wait. Tony do you mind if Bucky buys Indy a doll?” Bucky heard some mumbling in the background. “He says why would he care? So, it’s fine.”
“Let’s get you dressed, kiddo.” He kept Indy standing on the bed and took off his t-shirt and shorts. Indy bounced on his toes as Bucky pulled the short sleeve white button-up shirt onto him. “Excited, huh?” He asked the boy.
“I just went downstairs to ask Pepper something. That’s all. And now I’m back to cuddle with you if you want that?” Tony nodded and moved closer to Steve and Steve pulled him close once he could wrap his arm around him.
Bucky huffed a small laugh. “I have no idea. They knocked me out and I woke up on the floor here with little Tony. Wanna grab his stuff?” Bucky nodded to the pile of clothes and pair of shoes. Steve gathered it up and led the way out of the room. They made it to the Quinjet quickly, meeting up with Clint and Natasha on the way. Steve whispered a brief explanation if the looks on their faces were anything to go by but they said nothing. Clint fell back a little to fall into step with Bucky and he wiggled a finger at Tony to say hi and made a funny face at him. He turned his head to hide in Bucky’s shoulder but they didn’t miss the giggle he let out first.
“You are a very good boy.” Bucky kissed his cheek. “Why don’t you cuddle Steve for awhile, he looks like he needs it.” Steve held his arms out right away like he was waiting for that so Tony let himself be taken back. He arranged him so he was cradled in his arms like a baby and rocked him a little and within minutes Tony was sound asleep.
“Well, he’s been pretty upset that you aren’t back yet so we cuddled on the sofa for awhile with the llama and the blanket Pepper gave him and watched a movie. He won’t let either of them go, literally. I think it’s a comfort thing. Pepper brought us lunch because she probably assumed I wasn’t eating anything so she brought me a burger and fries and Indy got his first taste of McDonald’s. If you were feeling better you’d probably be horrified by that but he just had nuggets and a few fries. We did a few of his puzzles and he counted up to three all by himself with the number puzzle board so I think he’ll be reaching his milestones in no time.” Tony continued to ramble, all the while keeping an eye on Steve. He wasn’t sure Steve believed he was alive yet but if nothing else it was proving to be a distraction that calmed him slightly.
Tony took one step toward Steve but Clint yelled quickly. “Tony don’t move!” Tony stopped but he cried harder. Steve still has his boots on so he made his way over to Tony, crunching on a lot of glass to get there, and swept him into his arms.
“Happy birthday, Munchkin,” he said as he stepped into he room, coming to a stop in front of them. “First surprise of the day,” Tony announced. He pulled a balloon out from behind his back and let it go so it floated up a foot or so as he kept hold of the string. Indy gasped. It was an Avengers ballon that had cartoon versions of them and said Happy Birthday in big letters. “For you,” Tony added and put the string in Indy’s hand. “Look, it’s me and Papa,” he pointed at each of their likenesses. Indy smiled, tugging at the string and making the balloon bounce in the air.
Steve stepped forward. “So, I have his diaper bag packed with everything you might need. Diapers, change of clothes, pacifier, blanket, a toy,” he trailed off. She slung it on her shoulder.
“We just wanna help, Munchkin,” Tony said, leaning back to catch Indy’s eye over Steve’s shoulder. “If there’s a baby out there who needs help, we can find them. Like Bucky found you and took you someplace safe.”
“Please. I’ve been online since Steve just asked where she should sleep and I already have a bassinet and some essentials on the way here. You can get anything delivered at any time if you pay enough.” He waggled his phone at them with a smile. “Should be here within the hour.” Tony stood and clapped him in the shoulder. “You live here. I want this to be a home for you and your daughter. Plus, she kinda loves me already so,” Tony shrugged, smiling wide.
“Steve,” Tony called to him. “Ask me anything. If this was a recording you couldn’t ask me questions.” Steve looked unconvinced but he seemed to be thinking.
They re-entered the main room and Tony had the mess cleared up and they were back to chatting and watching TV. Tony jumped up immediately upon seeing Indy.
“Then you can be ‘da,’” Steve smiled. “I can be a different name. He can call me whatever he want’s as long as he’s happy.”
He left the room briefly to grab some supplies then returned, sitting on the edge of the sofa next to Tony’s knees. Bucky removed the bandage from his side and saw that, while the stitches were still intact, there was some blood around the edges.
This wasn’t any kind of life he wanted for Tony, utterly alone in a town where nothing ever happened except when he visited. Tony was movement and color, was life itself, and all Steve ever wanted was for him to be himself completely again, not a half-shade of who he was.
The last time they spoke, he had lashed out at her, an ancient distrust that she had worked so hard to break down rising up to the surface in an instant.
Sam nodded and Steve ushered the rest out before he closed the door and turned to face Tony. Tony hadn’t moved from his spot, and Steve was much closer to him than he had expected.
It was an early morning in Manhattan, and everyone was back to their daily routines, going to work, cursing the MTA, lining up at food carts. Cranes filled the sky and clean-up crews shifted detritus away, a constant drilling, banging, and beeping polluting the air.
Natasha thinks it must have dawned on him like a muted sunrise, imperceptible until the accumulated knowledge became too big and bright to miss. A process, not a singular moment.
There were going to be bad days for a while, ones that would take them by surprise, would saddle him with doubt and anger, with grief and pain. There would be days when Steve would reach out and hold him in his arms, and he wouldn’t be able to answer back. He wasn’t sure when they would stop, when that day would come. But he had to believe it would and that there would be good days in between and ever after too. Days when they would be in bed together, kissing promises against each other’s skin, leaving marks of love to accompany their scars. Days when they would be so intertwined with each other that they wouldn’t know where one of them ended and the other began. Days when they would just lie there, holding hands, making new meanings for the words on their wrists.
He needed to see for himself physical, tangible proof that Tony loved him because Tony had betrayed him. Had hurt him and had loved him back and hadn’t intervened as he had been violated.
He should be angrier at Steve. He had a right to be, and anger was acceptable, useful unlike moping around like this. But he was never capable of holding onto anger for too long and the times he did, the times he let it take over him, he always regretted it. He thought of Barnes trying to escape, of Barnes lying dazed on the floor, his arm a jagged stump. Of Steve struggling to defend himself.
Regret echoed inside his chest with nowhere to go, the force behind every reverberation growing with every rebound. Regret for what, he didn’t know. For everything that happened, he supposed, and everything that didn’t and maybe never would.
All that remains of them now is a team half-gone, a compound silent in death, and the man who gave him everything, who had been the foundation of his home, its bones and its core, lost to him in every way possible.
He didn’t even need to speak. It was there on his face, the rigidity of his body, as soon as she entered the room.
This must be what it was like then, to be loved and to be made aware of that love. Yearning roped itself around Tony’s heart, tugging at it. He could take a step forward. He could slot a leg between Steve’s, lean in and run his hands through Steve’s long hair down to the nape of his neck, hold him there where he was vulnerable, where he would be at his mercy. He could choose to heal instead of hurt, pull Steve to him and hold him to his chest.
Bucky looked over to Indy and smiled warmly. “I think I could manage the occasional puzzle.” He looked up and met Tony’s gaze. “But, um, I can go now,” he added nervously. Steve looked between the two sadly. Bucky stood up and Steve did as well.
“Jesus Steve,” Tony whispered frantically with just enough awareness to keep his voice down to not wake the baby.
“Well, I got him to agree to try and pump tomorrow so we can make a better schedule so maybe this won’t be an issue much longer.” Luca’s cries picked up in volume and Tony snuffled and his eyes shot open, lifting his head.
“I know that,” Tony snapped, albeit quietly. He leaned forward suddenly, and quickly but carefully, placed Luca in Steve’s arms then sat back with a huff. Steve ignored that for a moment.
“I’m sorry, Steve. So sorry.” Tony looked like he was about to cry and Steve ached to hold him. “I love you. We love you. Whatever happens, just know that. And I’m sorry,” he choked out. The woman stepped back into frame.
“You can do it, you’re okay, huh?” Tony continued, and Steve could hear the anxiousness creeping into his voice more and more. He was sure that the baby could pick up on that and it probably wasn’t helping. Steve sat on the edge of the rocking chairs cushioned ottoman, next to Tony’s feet.
“I’m here, sweetheart.”  Steve sobbed. And then he couldn’t stop. Bucky must have been  startled because he dropped the phone on Steve’s lap. Tony waited. Bucky pulled Steve against him, bringing Steve’s head down to his shoulder and pulling him tight with an arm around his back. With his other hand he picked up the phone again and now Tony could see them both. “Here, look.” Steve looked back to the screen and Tony went into their bedroom where Indy was napping. Tony turned the camera toward the bed and though he couldn’t see Steve’s face he heard his gasp. Indy was curled up in the middle of the bed, blanket tucked around him and his llama, and a pacifier in his mouth moving rhythmically as he suckled it in his sleep. Tony moved the phone so he was in the frame as well. “There’s your boy, Steve. Safe and sound.” Steve nodded, still crying, but Tony thought they might have been slightly happier tears this time.
“What’s gotten into you, huh?” Steve asked the boy, glancing back to see that Tony was still standing in the same spot avoiding eye contact.
“No, please.”  Steve smiled sadly. He stood Indy on the floor and kissed his forehead then put his diaper and pants back on.
“I’ll be back soon. Be good for Bucky,” Steve ruffled the boys hair. Indy waved at him and then reached back for the soup.
“See you in a few, munchkin. You be good for Papa. I don’t wanna hear you causing a raucous around the store.” Steve laughed at Tony but Indy had no idea what he was saying. Steve walked back to the main aisle and then headed deeper in to the store. They bypassed the kids bedroom section and Steve made a mental note of things they might want to order online. He passed a section with plates, bowls and sippy cups for kids so he sent a quick text to Tony advising him to grab some things from that area too.
“I know this isn’t my business, but, I love the three of you like family. Steve doesn’t want to leave. I think he was just trying to take care of you and Luca.” Tony nodded in agreement but didn’t seem to be able to answer otherwise.
“Pa pa,” he said as he reached his arms out, still saying it as if it were two words. Steve sat on the bed and pulled Indy onto his lap.
“Pa, want Pa!” Steve hurried over and scooped him up and Indy wrapped his arms and legs tightly around Steve. Bucky looked to Tony and Tony opened his mouth to speak but Indy beat him to it, unfortunately. “Da mad,” he cried.
“Poppy,” Indy exclaimed excitedly, bouncing a little and both Steve and Bucky’s hands shot out in case the baby slipped, but Indy held tight and she was fine. “Baby safe,” he whispered close to her face.
“I know, Tony, I know,” Steve said softly, stroking his thumb against the back of Tony’s hand. “You’ve been great through all of this. I don’t know what I would have done without you. And I know that you said first morning that you wanted to do this with me. But, now that things have calmed down a little and I’ve had a minute to think, I just wanted you to know that I’m not forcing this on you. Just because we’re together and I find out I have a kid doesn’t mean you’re life has to be disrupted too, that’s all. I can tell something’s bothering you and since you won’t tell me what it isI have to assume that you’re having second thoughts.”
“I think that means it’s time for us to get out of your hair,” Natasha said, as she stood up. She gave Steve a quick hug. “Thanks for having us, it was nice. You’ve got a good kid.”
In the end it actually took four days. They hadn’t moved Steve at all, they had held him in a hidden underground base at the original location, but by the time Bucky figured that out, three days had passed.
Bucky walked over to Indy. “Hey kid, you done thinking?” Indy nodded. “Yeah? And what are you not gonna do again?”
Tony brought Indy back out to the table so he could place the llama in his seat. “JARVIS, ask Barnes if he’s busy and if he’s not have him come up.” A moment later JARVIS announced that Bucky was on his way. He heard a tentative knock on the door so he went to get it, leaving Indy with his llama for a moment. He opened the door and Bucky looked surprised even though JARVIS must have told him it was Tony who called on him.
“Listen, Tony,” Steve sighed. “I got Indy ready for bed and brought him to our room to watch a movie for awhile but he seemed nervous or something so I asked him if he was okay.”
That night, after putting Indy to bed, they lay side by side in their bed with Tony cuddled in to Steve’s side.
“Good,” Tony admitted reluctantly. He pushed the blanket off and sat up so he was sitting next to Steve instead but he made sure their shoulders were still touching. “It was nice, thank you.”
When he reached the door to the guest room Bucky was in he debated what to do. “JARVIS, is Bucky asleep?”
Bucky rolled his eyes. “I don’t know why,” he replied, but aimed at Poppy as he looked down at her, “You had your bottle, huh?” He rubbed her tummy gently and her bouncing stopped as she leaned back into Bucky’s chest. “Oh, is that all it takes?” He chuckled. He leaned back into the sofa, reclined slightly, and adjusted her so she was laying out a little more and he could rub her tummy easier. Tony took his hand back when she let go and she grabbed on to Bucky’s T-shirt near her hip instead.
