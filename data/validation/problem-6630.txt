“Oh, come on,” Tony said looking at the hole in the wall before turning back to the Thor who had just let out a smile.
Even with Steve’s brothers talking and roasting marshmallows, their parents joining in, because his mother was hot all of the time, she was carrying twins for heaven’s sake, all the while Steve’s father was wearing more clothes than any of them were, according to Steve his father got cold easily, especially with his mother being pregnant and constantly having the windows wide open. He wondered if his family would be like this when they eventually met Steve and Bucky. It was something to think about, especially when the introductions were happening at a very public party.
weren’t there on that stupid planet galaxies away after some madman all but threw a moon at me and took everything away from me. But that’s what we do, right? Our best work after-the-fact? We’re the Avengers? We’re the A-vengers?! Not the Pre-vengers? Right?”
“Thank my mom, she got us out of there and made Thor drive us up here,” Natasha said smiling at them.
“Have you seen Steve,” Bucky asked someone near the door, but Tony didn’t hear the answer. “He’s in the kitchen,” Bucky told him before pushing him towards the kitchen at the other end of the house, he watched as Bucky turned back towards Natasha and kissed her before motioning for Tony to go and talk to Steve.
Tony looked up at him, those big brown doe eyes that Steve loved stared back, he was honestly afraid that Tony was going to reject him, except there was something in those eyes, something that Steve hoped was a good sign. Tony gave him a shy smile before putting his head next to Steve’s beating heart, he really wasn’t sure if Tony was checking to see if it was genuine or not, and if he could he would kiss the brunette.
“It’s held two days before Christmas, so a week after the end of the semester,” Tony told him, the end of the semester wasn’t that far away, he still had to finish all of his projects, and at some point, write a story for his fiction writing class.
Natasha huffed at him before rolling her eyes, “Fine I’ll go get it, but head towards the bathroom on the far side of the ballroom, mom won’t go over there, the thing is closed, they had a problem with the pipes or something for it’s under construction.”
“That our Nebula got taken before they all returned and what came back was the version of her that was still trying to please her father,” Tony said wanting to scream, they had all been grieving to notice. “Life just takes and takes and takes, and just when we’re getting something good it decides to fuck with us all the same.”
All he had wanted was a few minutes... was that too much to ask for, because apparently it was. He rolled over on the bed, wondering how long it would take for them to think that he wasn’t there, but he had made the mistake of answering the text messages from Natasha, so she knew that he was in the room. Getting up and moving off the bed was a task, one that he honestly didn’t care for, before walking towards the door.
Now though, Tony was going to use it to punish Steve for taking that hit for him, and since the medication would have Steve out long enough for Tony to put it in him and restrain him, he was really going to do it. He wasn’t as pissed off as he had been the other day, blame too much time on paperwork, hell at this point he just want relief himself. Before the fight, they hadn’t had sex in nearly a month. Steve had SHIELD things to do, Tony had a conference, they had several battles in between, and of course Tony had to finish the specs for the next generation of Stark phones. It wasn’t that he didn’t do his S.I. work, it’s just that he ignored the paperwork.
“You know I wouldn’t have said anything if I had known someone would have heard about it,” Tony told him before they sat down at the table.
“Are we really going to try this?” Bruce said skepticism in his voice. “Because honestly it sounds crazy, hell when I told Thor where I was going and what we were thinking of doing he just laughed in my face.”
Pepper nodded and then walked over to Steve, when the two of them were left alone, he knew he was in for something. “You’re going to travel through time,” she said as a fact and not a question.
She looked different than Tony remembered, but he really didn’t remember much from the time, he had just started running Stark Industries and was dealing with so much loss. He was lucky he remembered anything that happened in the early nineties, he was sure that there had been some kind of explosion on the highway or something, but he really couldn’t remember. Something about a huge fight happening between an old lady and some woman, but it was before cell phones were really a thing, so no one really knew what had happened. Tony had just brushed it off, he had had bigger things to worry about.
“You’ve got that doofy grin on your face,” Sam said as Steve walked into the house. “You only get like that when you like someone, or when you get a really good grade, and since we already got our midterm grades.”
“I got the scepter,” he said as he walked away from the elevator, the scepter in his hand, he knew he had to move fast before someone realized that he wasn’t their Steve Rogers.
Steve didn’t tell Bucky about it, he didn’t want Bucky overreacting over Tony being uncomfortable, because if there was one thing that Steve knew was that his best friend had always been overprotective of him. Not so much anymore, but when they were kids and Steve had been sick a lot, Bucky had always protected him, even when Steve got into fights with bullies three times his size. It wouldn’t matter that Tony was his roommate, if Steve was offended Bucky would fight anyone. And this wasn’t what he wanted to happen because it wasn’t Tony’s fault that it had happened, if he thought about it, well it was mostly Bucky’s fault but, in the end, Steve could only blame himself.
“Air Force, we trained at the same base a long time ago,” Rhodes answered, a hint of something more there, but Steve knew that it wasn’t his place to ask, instead he nodded his head and motioning for them to follow, Nebula walking towards the far end of the conference room that they had been working out of until Tony had come back, Sharon and Nat were working on finding out who lived amongst the heroes that they knew. Behind him Rhodes and their newest arrival talked in hushed tones, before putting quieting as they approached the table.
“You’re pretty,” he said and he knew at that moment that he was doomed but it felt nice just to say that to Steve so it didn’t really matter. “I liked you ever since I was twelve... did you know that you’re two years older than I am... everyone is older than me.”
“I currently don’t have her whereabouts, my systems for the compound are down Boss,” she said and he could feel his heart breaking. He found Steve but without FRIDAY, finding everyone else is going to take a little work.
If there was one thing that Steve wasn’t expecting it was Bucky telling him and Tony was on his way, he worried that Tony would get into an accident on the way there. He had almost told Bucky to tell them not to worry
A car drove pass them as they gathered the courage to keep going, “Hey man, make love not war!” an old man said as it drove off.
“I'm sorry. No offense, but you're a very earthly being. Okay? We're talking about space magic. And "can't" seems very definitive don't you think?” Thor said with a slight glee as if they couldn’t understand the severity of what kind of magic was at play.
Grabbing Rhodey’s hoodie from his backpack, it had been the only thing that he had taken with him other than his laptop and his notebook which now had the sleeve from the first cup of coffee that Steve had brought him, Tony went to the media room and sat down to write his story. As it got closer to the last issue of the series, Tony started to ramp up his writing, planning on revealing Iron Man’s identity to Captain America. He had been thinking about it for a while, especially since Steve had told him about his father being the creator of the series. The big reveal would be that Tony himself was Iron Man, because it would mean that he would be that much closer to Steve in a way, at least in a way he wasn’t sure would be possible in real life.
“We can find out more at the end of the semester when we get home,” Tony said not wanting to think about the whole thing, he had enough problems as it was.
“Damn it,” he said, knowing just how many of his former students were going to intern for the rest of the semester.
The garage was actually cleaner than he would have imagined, maybe because FRIDAY had been directing the bots while Tony cleaned up Morgan, so all that they really had to do was gather up the TV, or at least what was left of it, and throw it out. FRIDAY already putting an order in for a new one, even though he was sure the lecture from Steve was going to drive him insane. He loved the man, but he hated the lectures, even though they usually ended in fantastic sex, but honestly, it’s like being scolded by your high school principal, which shouldn’t sound as hot as it did at the moment.
“Let get to work,” he said getting up as Bruce and Shuri began to move towards the door, the two of them talking in hushed tones about the calculations that Tony had been working on the night before. There was no stopping Steve from remembering what his husband had said, the conflict in his eyes, they were risking more than their own lives here, they were risking everything that they had spent five years working towards.
“I should be the one who’s sorry, I distracted you,” Stark said to him and Steve really wasn’t sure whether or not he was hallucinating, because after weeks of Instagram posts on the store he was sure that he had someone stalking him. Although Stark could just be there trying to verify why someone was using his name to post pictures of a New York bookstore.
“Is there anything we can do to speed this along?” he asked wondering if what Vision really needed was the stone, or a variation on the stone itself.
Tony’s first few weeks of school are more or less him hiding in the robotics lab from Natasha, or writing in the library, usually fueled by whatever snacks he had hidden away in his room and all the coffee he could get. On the nights he did get some sleep, he would usually get woken up by Bucky coming in from work, and it would take him hours before he was passed out in the robotics lab or wherever he could find, or a hiding place he had found.
And with that, Winghead Bookstore was finally reopened on a rainy late September day, and of course the weather played a role in people coming in, some for coffee others to get out of the horrible weather. Some people were happy that the store had been reopened and that it hadn’t been taken over by some chain, others loved the fact that the coffee shop was now a part of it, though Bucky said that only paying customers could stay there for more than a half an hour. Steve knew that it was his way of making more money for the store.
“You know you two should just kiss and make up already, it’s bad for team moral if you keep fighting because you want to get into each other’s pants,” Natasha said walking in past Rhodey, which only made Tony laugh before he finally let go of Steve, only to see the other man blush. That was a new development.
“Like I would still be War Machine in a different universe,” Rhodey said looking at her, Tony was fascinated by this just as much as anyone else. “Or Tony could have been a woman.”
Natasha cleared her throat reminding Steve of what they now had to do, “We have to go,” he said to Tony.
“I know what you’re thinking Tony,” Steve said as they all started to get into position. “The answer is no.”
Steve couldn’t help but smile, he had never seen Bucky try so hard to impress a girl, usually anyone he was interested in would fall all over themselves to get his attention. It was weird to think of Bucky having to work on getting someone’s attention.
“I’ve never seen anyone like it, I mean a character like it, so I found it a little interesting,” Steve told him and Tony smiled, it was different to have someone ask about Iron Man who didn’t know a single thing about the character himself.
"Nat, it's an earthquake under the ocean. We handle it by not handling it,” Okoye answered clearly irritated by the whole thing, but they all trusted Natasha enough to keep trying, but all were worried about her and often called Steve or Tony to take her out of the compound for a while.
“I’m not sure, the stone on my head is not the Mind Stone, but it has similar properties to it, though I know the original stone no longer exists,” Vision said and Tony knew that there had been a real connection to the mind stone. “I know that a lot of things are amiss.”
“Okay,” he said knowing that in a way Bucky was right, plus they needed to sort out their lives a little. Tony actually wanted to know where they stood in all of this, he wanted to know that there was something to look forward to.
Thor grunted and used both the hammer and the axe to bring down his lighting on Tony’s suit, using the suit’s back panels he absored the blast and sent it right at Thanos. The blast was huge, but he wasn’t sure if it was big enough to take Thanos down. Just as he thinks it’s working, he sees Mjölnir fly by, the distraction had been enough for Tony’s fire power to faulter, enough for Thanos to grab him and use him as a shield against the hammer and it hit him and sent him flying.
“So,” Scott said looking at the group. “Does that mean that Back to the Future’s a bunch of bullshit?”
“Oh, you know, Jane and I aren't even dating anymore, these things happen though you know, nothing last forever,” he said as a way to move away from thinking about his mother’s death. As Bruce makes sure that he stays seated. “I'm not done yet, the only thing permanent in life is impermanence,” Thor finished but Bruce just stayed put, making sure that the god would be alright.
“You know,” Barnes said as the medics started putting Steve on a stretcher, “He would have done it regardless, whether it had been you, or me, or Nat, or even Barton.”
“It’s... stop it, just let me,” he said tearing up. “Just let me do it. Just let me do something good. Something great.”
Clint showed up a few minutes later, popping open the ice bag and shaking it before handing it to Tony, “Clint can you wait here with him so I can check in with Thor,” Steve said even though he didn’t want to leave Tony’s side.
“Who’s going to go and who’s going to stay,” Clint said addressing the elephant in the room, there were too many of them to pick from.
“Buck, if you don’t stop, I won’t be held accountable for what Tony does to you in your sleep,” Steve said and Tony automatically thought about shaving his roommate’s hair off, so he guessed that Steve would be correct in his assumptions.
The chairs were already set up when he walked into the room, Miles was in the corner setting up the drinks table, usually filled with whatever coffee beans that Tony had given them at the beginning of the month.
“What do you mean,” Steve asked genuinely curious to learn anything about Tony but hearing this from someone else’s perspective wasn’t something he expected.
“Is it really you,” she said and he nodded just as she rushed across the room and put her arms around him. Steve could only keep his eyes on Tony, and the sadness he saw was more painful than anything he could have imagined. “But how?”
Getting out of the car and walking over to where Tony was seated, Steve could only hope that this whole thing was a good idea, he opened the door and just kneeled down next to the man’s still form.
Before he could answer, the man put him in a chokehold as if he were trying to get the answer out of him by rendering him unconscious. He had to think fast, before he couldn’t breathe anymore and Hydra ended up with a second Captain America.
“I’m sorry,” Tony said to Bruce, knowing that he was intruding on their date. “It’s just that my boyfriend was supposed to come here today, and Natasha’s boyfriend as well, but they had to go to the hospital on a family emergency.”
“Don’t leave,” Tony whispered, and it tugged at Steve’s heart especially when Tony reached out for him.
“It looks like we have another visitor,” Tony motioned to Carol who looked at them warily. “I honestly don’t know where she came from because last, I heard she had died in the nineties, but if Fury can find you then, I guess anything is possible.”
All of a sudden Clint’s phone started ringing, pulling them out of their conversation and making them all turn towards the thing as it vibrated on the table. Clint looked at them before looking at the phone rushing to pick it up, almost dropping it as he saw the name on the screen. His face lit up with joy, “Honey,” he said into the receiver. “Honey.”
Why couldn’t he stop talking, he couldn’t understand this, but he kept going, “I didn’t have grandparents either, so it was nice, and then she tells me stories about what it was like growing up, and we started the book club, it’s not really a club when there’s two of us but she wanted me to have something that wasn’t tied to me being well who I am.”
“I know Tony, once we’re finished, we’ll take them home okay,” Steve told him before kissing him, the two of them a sight in full battle armor, like the gauntlet would have attacked them for using the stones the wrong way.
He didn’t ask for anyone to be dusted, he didn’t ask for anything other than more time with his loved ones, and a second chance, he wanted Natasha to have her second chance, he wanted Peter and his friends to grow up normal, he wanted his kids to have never lost their families, and he just wanted Steve to be there with him for the rest of their lives, happy and healthy. Just as the power took over, and the pain set in, he could feel as the blinding light took him, and settled over him. This was his end, and there was nothing to stop it.
“The bee is in the hive,” Tony said into his com, as he watched the Avengers get into the elevator, only to laugh when he saw the Hulk try to get in there as well. That same elevator would be upgraded for when the Avengers moved into the tower a few months later, mainly because of what had happened that day.
The waitress sat them in a corner booth all the way in the back, but Steve liked watching Tony take the whole place in, his eyes lighting up as he saw the wall of pictures with the Pride flag right in the middle.
“Yeah well you get that look on your face too,” Steve said trying to move past his friend. “Come on Sam I had a long day and I need to get some sleep tonight I have class in the morning,” he knew that he was whining, and he didn’t care at all mainly because as happy as he was that Tony had agreed, he was still tired from being on his feet all day.
“No problem, when you’re both ready, it would be good to know who it is,” he said smiling. It was rare to get the girl to open up, she was smart and Steve liked that Miles had found a friend that he was comfortable with. “I’ll see you both later, I’m going to stop by and see Nat before I go home.”
It wasn’t difficult to get into the underground bunker that held the SHIELD headquarters, for one Steve remembered the facility, and Tony knew how to get through their rudimentary systems like they were nothing but Morgan’s marshmallow sandwiches, which she only had when they had tea parties. Mainly because she thought tea was bitter and tastes weird, and marshmallows were the best thing to remedy it.
They watched as Hulk snapped his fingers, the gauntlet lighting up the room, Tony couldn’t help but watch as something that looked so harmless burned through the Hulk’s arm. They watched as the big guy slumps down and passes out, the gauntled sliding off and falling away as Hulk turned back into Bruce. Clint kicking it away from the man as they all walked over.
“So, let’s get him and the stones, we use them to bring everyone back,” Carol added to the plan that was now forming in front of them.
“Alright children,” Tony said feeling weird that he was all of a sudden being an adult over the guy with literal fucking children and a walking talking racoon, but then there’s also a walking tree so his life was just going to be that weird and he was just too tired to really care. “Let’s get to the matter at hand, because I’m supposed to be on bed rest, and not refereeing your bickering.”
“I did,” Scott said to him and Tony wanted to scream out at the man, the whole thing had been a fluke.
“Deal,” Bucky said with a smile. “Second, double dates are allowed, but you and Steve can’t pick, he has terrible tastes in dates.”
The store was busy the whole day as more and more students realized that they were open, so they came for coffee and to order school books that they didn’t carry. He hadn’t seen Tony all day and Steve wondered if he had thought too much about their so-called dinner. Instead of dwelling on what could have been, he watched his staff help the customers. He also watched Clint ask Darcy out in Clint’s own special way, which was a little over the top, and involved the guy shooting Darcy with what looked like an arrow with a heart on it. The whole thing was cute and weird at the same time, but Darcy loved it so Steve was just going to let the whole thing go.
“Tony, this is Bruce,” Thor said proudly, his chest puffed out, like he’s was showing off. “Bruce, my darling, this is my baby brother Tony.”
They moved from their spaces and gathered snacks, Tony went to the fridge in search of some blueberries, because if Steve was going to force the healthy stuff on him, then he was going to have something he liked. Shuri set up the next stone on the screen, a bag of treats already in front of her. Tony walked over and sat down next to her, placing some fruits in front of her as well.
Steve smiled at him before opening the door, “Yeah well this room is special,” he said as they walked in, the moon light washing the room in a slight glow, “There’s a skylight up here, plus everyone else complained because it was so high up, but I loved it the moment I saw it.”
“Are you sure? - Cap. Captain. Steve, sorry, America. Rogers. Look, if you do this, and this doesn't work, you're not coming back,” Scott said reminding them of the real risk they were taking by deviating from the plan.
Before he could chicken out, he put his hands on Tony’s face feeling a small bubble of happiness form in his heart, only the moon and the stars lighting up those beautiful brown eyes that have haunted him from the moment they met, the same ones that always looked at him with glee whenever he got a question right on one of Tony’s study sheets. He could feel the slight roughness on Tony’s face, that little bit of stubble that had grown because Tony hadn’t shaved. He felt Tony’s breath hitch, but there was no turning back for Steve, he couldn’t keep pining for Tony and second guessing himself, not when he was so close to what he wanted the most. He could see a future in Tony’s eyes, it was crazy and stupid, considering how different they were, but there was something more that he would get from it.
“Mom’s in labor,” Steve said, and Bucky just nodded before jumping in the backseat. “Can you call Bruce, I know he’s in the city, his boyfriend lives in Manhattan, so he can make it in time, and Peter call Hank and tell him where we’re off too.”
“Plus, she’s angry that she lost a bet,” Rhodey said smiling at them from the door. “And I plan on collecting on that bet when we get back, but before I go,” he walked over and smacked the back of Steve’s head before bending down and hugging Tony.
The mention of Clint made Steve tense and Tony knew it was because Clint out of all of them was having an even harder time moving forward. “I wish there was more we could do for him,” Steve said as he rested his head against Tony’s. “It’s not fair that we can have all of this and he’s still struggling.”
“Yeah, I noticed, and I don’t mean by tutoring Steve, I saw your class schedule, and I know you go to the library and spend hours in the robotics lab. How you haven’t fallen apart is beyond me.”
To his surprise, Steve was actually sitting near the library, a sad look on his face almost like someone had kicked a puppy in front of him. Tony wasn’t sure that he was ready for this conversation, he wasn’t ready for any of this. The whole weekend had been a disaster, and he was still nursing a hangover from his weekend inventing binge.
“You can give it to him when Steve gets back, that way we can give him the same speech,” she said before kissing him on his head. “Get some sleep Tony, you need it.”
“Yeah,” Tony said smiling as he put the finishing touches on the draft before sending it to Ty’s email so that he could read it. “It’s interesting to see how it develops, but for now all you have to do is read it and make sure that everything you had before is still in there.”
When May and Pepper showed up twenty minutes later with several bags of food, from their favorite Chinese food place, Tony felt happy. Yes, he was alone, his family all but abandoned him for the weekend, but he had his friends, these were the people who were always there for him no matter what. He learned that Pepper and May had gotten an apartment together, they were both using their work study money for it, though he knew that they weren’t struggling, not when the both of them usually spent the summer working at S.I. for Thor or Loki, which ever one wanted an assistant. Rhodey told him about what it was like at M.I.T. and about the girl from his Air Force unit that he was trying to get with. He spent the summer at basic training, and luckily got time off to go to school.
“I wasn’t sure if I should have told you,” Tony continued his voice muffled by Steve’s chest, “I think I’ve been trying to keep myself from feeling it, but then you kissed me and I thought, well this is it, this is what I’ve been waiting for.”
A knock on the door, was all the warning he had before Natasha walked into the small space, “I’m sorry Steve,” she said to him.
They didn’t talk about if for the rest of the night, Steve saw the look on Riri’s face when they had gone into the family room and sat down to watch the movie, the worried look in Kamala’s eyes as they ate dinner. The only one out of the loop was Miles who had gotten there just as dinner was being served, but Steve knew that his sister would tell him about what was happening. Secrets rarely stayed secret in their house, it was a rule for them, something that Steve had learned after Siberia, secrets weren’t allowed for any of them.
“Oh, he’s going to answer to us,” Pierce said as if Tony’s mind wasn’t thinking about a million ways to replusor the man. “Odin can have what’s left. And I’m going to need that case, that’s been SHIELD property for over 70 years.”
“Good to know,” she said before pushing a button in the revealing a secret tunnel. The two of them looked over at her shocked at what they were seeing. “What, do you think that I would trust anyone here when they brought in Zola and had him work for us. I don’t trust that rodent to save my life.”
The two flew off leaving him to stand there for a moment and wonder just what they were getting themselves into, there was so much they were willing to do to help the world heal, but for him he knew just how much he was going to lose. If it meant that the kids would have their family back, it would be worth it, but what would it mean for him and Tony, for the Avengers, for the future. There were too many what ifs to ask himself, too many problems that could come from what they were thinking of doing. If they messed up just a little the fate of the world would crumble.
The lake house had somehow turned into a place where people would come and go, Thor came with Bruce and Valkyrie, most of the time when Nebula was there, the four of them having a weird bond that Tony didn’t want to speculate about, but it worked. Each one of them housed a mountain of issues, either from family or the tragedy of their lives, but they were close. Nebula would bring them things that she found while traveling with Rocket, who because of Thor was Rabbit to Morgan. It was their own weird little family, one that Steve never thought he would have, even with the missing people in their lives, he knew that he had hope for their future.
Yet, he missed the times when the house was filled with them all, even with just him, Steve and Morgan, there were times when it felt too empty. He knew that Riri was on her way home for the weekend, and she would probably pick up her sister on the way home as well. Steve was with Miles at their monthly group therapy session, and he would probably convince their son to come home as well. It made him happy that they would be there all together for the weekend.
“Doesn’t matter if I’m dumb you love me anyway,” James said to her before leaning over and kissing her. “You only really like me for my good looks.”
“Let me please because if I know anything, it’s that this whole thing is one giant misunderstanding.”
“No worries,” Steve said wiping his head with his sweater. “I didn’t want to leave you standing there.... so... where’s your date?”
“Yeah good luck with that theory, it’s weird and unnatural, I love your sister.... wait that sounds weird.”
“So,” Ty sat down in front of him a huge smile on his face his little leather-bound notebook in front of him. “I hope this isn’t too much, but I wrote all of the dialogue, I’m horrible at exposition, it’s why I got a B- on the last story, but I’m great at dialogue, so I hope that you can write something around this and we could edit from that.”
The Army/Airforce thing between Steve and Carol is more of a reference to their Avengers Assemble counterparts.
“You’re the one that picked the class,” Steve said picking up his backpack. “I don’t even know why I agreed to it, I could have taken an extra history class.”
They didn’t waste any time after that, Steve could see the determination in Tony’s eyes, the need to fix something that was broken, it was something he loved about the man. They were in the lab as Tony and Rocket worked on the glove, they needed to make sure that this would work, because they couldn’t have one more failure on their hands. He knew that they wouldn’t be able to take another one especially after the last three big ones.
“Yeah sure,” Tony pulled the story towards him, still in the notebook which meant that to fix it he would have to type it into his computer, which meant more work for Tony. “What do you think is wrong with it?”
Thor stopped for a moment, he hadn’t broken down when the image of Jane appeared, but the moment his mother had been mentioned, Tony could see the hurt in the man’s eyes. Bruce gently rubbed Thor’s back trying to make certain that the god didn’t break down before he finished.
“Yes, you do,” he answered back as DUM-E rushed in front of U to bring the ball back to the Princess.
“It’s just a grilled cheese sandwich Morgan,” he said to her while she still had her hand up, holding him hostage.
“How much do you want me to spill everything inside of you,” Steve whispered in his ear, Tony hadn’t even realized that he had closed his eyes, he wasn’t even sure that he could talk. “Tell me Tony, how much do you want to come?”
He headed to the library for his weekly meeting with Ty, who had started writing a new story and giving it to Tony to edit for him, this had become their new routine, because it was nice to have someone to talk about fictional characters with. Tony kept fixing a lot of the story that Ty had started writing, as well adding to it so that it had felt like their first collaboration. Tony had been thinking about their next assignment and he couldn’t figure out what to write, he had thought about submitting one of his fanfiction stories, but changing as much of the character’s names as possible. The thing was that Tony had been so busy writing his fic and helping Ty while also working on the coding that he hadn’t given much thought to actually writing anything original, though if he thought about it, Iron Man was original, even though for Tony he existed within his Captain America stories.
Before Loki could say anymore Thor slapped a device on his brother’s mouth effectively rendering him silent. “Shut up,” Thor said and Tony could swear he saw the god smile at his brother as if this was something they had done before.
At those words Steve felt his heart burst, it meant that Tony looked at him in the same way that he looked at Tony. He had been afraid, mostly because he thought that Tony was dating whoever it was that he met up with at the library, but if Tony was looking at their conversation as if a rejection from Steve would hurt the most, then that meant that Tony felt the same about him as he did about Tony.
“Well he’s still alive,” was all Bruce said before Steve sighed and walked off, he needed some air, and a moment away from whatever craziness had just happened.
Natasha looked at Scott like this wasn’t the strangest thing in the world for her. “I get e-mails from a raccoon, so nothing sounds crazy anymore.”
Steve knew that Natasha was a natural leader, more so then he felt most days, he could lead the Avengers until he was blue in the face, but look where it got them, and he didn’t know if he had it in him to try again. “You work together and figure out the next steps in whatever it is we’re doing, I’m going to check in with Tony and Bruce and see if there’s anything we can do to find out where Thanos had gone off too.”
“Okay,” Steve said, and Tony couldn’t help but feel hopeful about just having Steve for even just a little while.
“You’re crazy, your fucking nuts,” Scott said and Tony could see the worried look in Steve’s eyes, but it was the only way and they both knew it. It was the perfect distraction, and no one would notice someone who looked a lot like Tony walking off with the stone, mainly because he would also be in SHIELD gear.
“Alright, let's get to work,” he said pulling Nebula and Steve along, Nebula had grabbed onto Rhodey and started pulling him along. She was more, well human in the years since they met, she still didn’t show a lot of emotion, but she held the people she cared about most very close to her. Tony knew some of the reasons why, even after they had all lost everything, the ones left behind needed one another more than anything. Hopefully doing this will give her something more than what she already has.
“Anyway, let’s get some snacks in here,” Tony said trying to keep the moment that Bruce and Thor were having between the two of them.
“Because he prefers his bots, and his workshop over human interaction, so he tends to forget to introduce people to his… boyfriend,” she said looking at him as if she were analyzing his worthiness.
“He’s kidding,” Hope said as she stood next to Bruce helping him with the machine. “You can’t say things like that!” she told Bruce, Steve’s super soldier hearing picking it up, which only made him want to laugh.
Tony couldn’t help but look at Steve, wondering just how much he was about to lose, “Tony, after everything you've seen, is anything really impossible?” Steve tells him, and in that moment he knew where Steve stood on the whole thing.
“Well the one we have at the factory powers the whole building, it’s basically clean energy, the only downside is that if it’s overloaded it can explode like a nuclear bomb and wipe out a good portion of the city, but for Iron Man or at least his backstory, the reactor is in his chest, not just the armor. It works like an electromagnet, and it’s used to keep pieces of shrapnel out of his heart.”
“It’s a matter of life and death,” Tony told her, and honestly it was the truth, they could bring everyone back, save so many lives.
“Yeah, my phone was with my coat, Nat just left hers behind because we don’t like upsetting our mom... anyway, she knew we wouldn’t have done it if it weren’t for the fact that we were worried to death, so she got Thor to drive us.”
“My Aunt Peggy is Tony’s Godmother, we grew up together,” Sharon said before walking over and pulling Tony into her arms. “And if I had known that you were the one that Steve had a crush on, I wouldn’t have tried to take him away from you,” she told Tony. “But I guess it’s more your fault since I didn’t even know that you were going to this school.”
“We don't. But the radiation's mostly gamma,” Bruce said looking at the gauntlet the stones resting in their places. “It's like...uh... We were made for this.”
There was a moment after Rhodes mentioned Pepper Potts where Tony stiffened, Steve remembering their break up and his own feelings of jealousy when he hadn’t been the one to comfort the man, but that’s something he probably won’t mention to Tony, at least not at that moment. He still wondered how the two made their friendship work after the break-up, because he still couldn’t get the image of Tony sad and despondent out of his mind.
It felt weird, bringing Tony somewhere that him and Bucky had always gone, but he was trying to replace the bad memories with something good. Yes, him and Tony hadn’t known one another for long, have dated for even less time, but there was something there, something that he wanted to hold on to, something special. It was different then his relationship with Bucky, and he saw that now, even as his friendship with Bucky returned to what it had been. They had just been two small town kids, nothing more, but now that they’ve grown up a little, he realized that it would have never lasted. It wasn’t like his parents who had known from day one that they would be together forever, Steve hadn’t had that with Bucky, but for some reason in his heart he had felt that with Tony, and he wanted to cherish it.
“I’m trying Steve, but it’s a little difficult right now,” he told him. “Everything is a little hard, because we screwed up once and look at what happened, and now if we don’t succeed in this, we might not make it back home.”
Tony told them about his writing class, his future bot son, Ty writing with him, and about Steve, he knew he had gushed about Steve the most, he also told them that he liked his roommate, even though he was dating Natasha. They all knew that Natasha would kill Bucky if he tried anything, so they weren’t too worried about her. Though they worried about Tony constantly, mainly because of his sleeping habits, his coffee obsession and his perfectionist attitude.
“Uh.... Howard,” he said and almost wanted to smack himself, he couldn’t think of anything else, his father was standing in front of him, the man who hadn’t paid any attention to him growing up, who loved Steve more than his own son.
“I’m not going to be, not as long as you’re there Tony, and it’s not going to be our first date.... wait when is the gala?”
“And don't worry if it doesn't pan out. I'm just kinda -” he watched the image change, as everything started coming together.
“I went in the ice in ‘45 right after I met the woman, I thought was the love of my life. Woke up 70 years later. It took a long time for me to move on from that from losing everything that I knew,” Steve couldn’t help but look at Miles, his son, the boy who had grown up in front of him and made both of his parents proud. “I found love again, I found a family again, even after all of this. You got to move on. Got to move on. The world is in our hands. It’s left to us guys, and we have to do something with it. Otherwise... Thanos should have killed us all.”
Clint’s kids lived on the land, Clint oftentimes taking missions to work off his anger, leaving the kids with Steve and Tony, which they were okay with. Their weekends filled with sleepovers, and friends stopping by. Shuri joining them, which Steve knew was the best thing for her, because she needed moments where the weight of an entire country was not riding on her shoulders. Nebula oftentimes came with Duranna who saw Tony as an Uncle who gave her interesting things, Nebula always looked at peace when she was around Tony and the kids, like she had found her place after everything.
“Good luck on your mission, Captain,” he said with a nod, trying not to smile at the fact that Captain America was dressed in Army fatigues, and looked very good in them.
“Oh really? Well thank Thor I’m here. Regardless, I fixed it,” he said holding up his right hand, the device had been ready when he had gotten back to the house, so he knew all he needed was a couple of things, including his suit which was now nestled in its little device. “It’s a fully functioning Time-Space GPS. FRIDAY hadn’t had it ready when we left this morning, plus I needed to go back to the house for somethings.”
“Because I kind of overheard the whole conversation you guys had with Nat, Bruce, Scott and Hope,” Kamala said which meant that they’ve known the whole. “Pops we want to help.”
“Nothing, it’s just been a long day,” Steve answered, never turning to greet the person, it had really been one of those days, but it wasn’t his fault, he hadn’t gotten enough sleep, and not he was wondering if he actually had a stalker posing as Tony Stark.
“Steve,” he groaned as he added a second fingers and started scissoring himself open, Steve groaned, and it was enough to send sparks up Tony’s spine. Steve’s eyes opened as Tony started using his hair for leverage with his other hand, Tony knew that the small bite of pain from his scalp was worth it for Steve, especially when he was in charge of Tony’s pleasure.
“We’ve talked, and I talked to Tony about taking some time off,” she said smiling. “Who knows maybe after you guys come back we can talk about it more.”
“I can feel a great disturbance in the universe, my connection to the stone has evolved, while the stone itself no longer exists, I feel as though the entity that had been within it still does, and they’re searching for something,” Vision’s words were like a punch in the gut, if the stones didn’t exist physically what would that mean for the universe itself?
“I’ll hold you to that,” Tony said, neither of them making the move to let go. It was a comfort that he was willing to take.
Tony nodded, before getting up and walking out of the room towards the bathroom, he needed a moment, and this was the only way that he was going to get it. He needed to think about this clearly, he wasn’t sure that anything had happened, but it had, it wasn’t a dream at all, and as excited as he was, he was also scared. He couldn’t risk getting in between Bucky and Steve, it would harm Natasha’s relationship, and that was something that he wasn’t willing to risk. They all deserved happiness, even if Tony would have to give his up in the end.
“Yes, but no one has ever given me one where I’m Iron Man, because no one knows that I’m the author, the only people who know are my mom and Natasha, and well you,” he felt his face burn at the words but it felt nice to have someone who knows that it’s him, who took the time and effort for him.
“I know you want your brother back, your family, and all of those from Wakanda that perished, to come back, I want the same for those I’ve lost, but we’re all on uncharted territory here, so for now we just keep trying to revive Vision, we try our best so that when our little band of Thanos hunters come back we’ll be ready.”
“You want to have this fight then have at it Rogers,” Tony said not having the urge to call the man Steve because he couldn’t bring himself to remember the night before. The flair of hope for something more. “We’ve been brewing towards it for how long now,” Tony couldn’t help but feel the push of his ribs against his chest, the Hulk had done a number on him and he knew he was bruising at that moment. Hoping his ribs weren’t broken he looked up at the eyes of the man who had been a part of his life, whether dead or alive.
“Tony, I get it. And I'm happy for you, I really am,” Natasha said as Steve walked over to him without saying another word. “But this is a second chance.”
“I would love to hear more about it, maybe we could collaborate, I’ve been working on projects that would help third world countries get better medical care,” Bruce said with Thor beaming next to him. “It’s actually how I met your brother, he was at a fundraiser that my company had put together, I work for a nonprofit, and Thor was there as Stark Industries liaison, we started talking about a town in New Mexico that had been hit pretty badly by some gas explosion and how he wanted to help.”
“Sharon goes to those parties,” Tony said reminding himself that someone he didn’t know who was also friends with Steve, was now dating his cousin.
It opened before he even got his keys out as two teenagers rushed out of the house tackling Steve and nearly toppling Tony over the porch steps. The two of them started talking a mile a minute and Steve couldn’t really keep up with them.
As everyone says their goodbyes, Steve is getting ready to move forward, except Rhodey’s still there and Steve’s worried as he hears them talking about Clint leave a pile of bodies in Mexico, Steve had seen the man with his kids not too long ago, but he hadn’t seen them since and now he was worried.
“Somewhere under all this. All I know is he doesn't have them, and he won’t get them either if I have a say in this,” Tony told them, he wasn’t going to let Thanos destroy their lives again.
When he had told Bucky that he was moving back to the city, well Buck was happy to hear that he had finally decided to leave the army. Bucky had left when he had been twenty-five, after losing his arm in active combat, though now he sported a prototype arm from Stark Industries. Bucky swore that it was better than having a real hand, though he had it tattooed with all kinds of things, so no one actually thought it was fake at all. Bucky had taken over his parents’ café, which was next door to Steve’s Nana’s bookstore, and so the two of them thought that they could combine the two stores and create a staple bookstore in the heart of the city. Both were close to several nearby colleges and they constantly had students in the store, so why not have one store altogether.
“Anyway,” Tony said stopping Clint from going on a rant about how there’s an actor that looked almost exactly like all of them.
“Did anything happen while you were all on that planet? Anything that would have alerted you to something coming after you all?”
“I figured it out, by the way,” he said before Steve could finish. He felt his husband stiffening under him.
“Let me think about it,” he said instead of what his mind was telling him, because he needed a moment to get his head on straight.
They needed a plan, which was something Steve was good at, Tony knew this, but trying to make the plan work was an entirely different thing, they needed to figure out where the six stones were, and what time would be the best time to go and get them. They needed to make sure the teams that were going would have someone here to make sure that they would come back. They also needed to make sure that Earth was protected while they were all gone, these were all the variables that Tony was working through in his head. All the while he was thinking about his kids, his life, and just how much was going to change in such a short amount of time.
Steve wasn’t sure if they were going on a suicide mission, it made his former life seem like a cake walk compared to what they were going to walk into. He didn’t regret becoming Captain America, he didn’t regret ending up in the ice if it meant that he had these people in his life, this family they’ve created, then it was worth all of the pain and heartache that he has suffered over the years. It made having Tony in his life worth it.
It didn’t take long for them to sit there in silence, just watching the stars in the sky, Tony often wondered what it would be like to see them up close, but he wasn’t going to be an astronaut, he didn’t have it in him to leave his life behind like that. Plus, he wouldn’t have met Steve if he had actually tried, and that on its own was worth it. He wanted to change the world, but on his own merit. Those were things to think about after he from graduated college, in the future, which wasn’t going to happen for a long time. He wanted to cherish what he had before responsibilities plagued him at every turn.
“I am... inevitable,” Thanos said as he snapped his fingers, but nothing happened, the Titan shocked as he watched the stones light up in Tony’s hands.
“Touché,” Steve said with a smile. They had reached the dorm, and while Tony wasn’t ready to call it a night, he knew he had too.
That was another thing about his life, his family, as crazy as they were, they took care of him, made sure he went to the best schools in New York, made sure he smiled and had fun, even when he had blown up his workshop in the garage and had gotten a three hour lecture from his father about safety protocols and making sure not to mix chemicals. That was the thing about being a Stark, you had to be the best of the best, and when you messed up, well you got lectured for it.
Tony was about to say something, but Bucky shook his head. “It’s even weirder because I’m dating your sister, and you’re okay with that, but I feel stupid because I didn’t see this coming.”
“No,” Bucky said and Steve knew that he was trying to save the conversation from going downhill. “It’s just that my friend over here shares his name, and people used to make fun of him for it.”
“The guards are looking for the two of you, and I’m taking a guess that whatever it was that you came looking for was something important enough for you to break into a heavily guarded facility.”
“That's a good point. That's a good point,” Rocket said, they had all been stretched thin over the last couple of years after the snap happened.
“She said her last name was Romanoff,” Bucky said and Tony wasn’t sure what to think, she was too good at hiding who she was when she didn’t want people to associate her with her own family, hell hadn’t that been what he had been doing all semester.
“All right, you’re up, little buddy,” Tony said as he watched the briefcase that was holding the Tesseract. “There’s our stone.”
“I’ll tell Thor everything I know about you and then some if you start with me Banner,” Tony said before turning back towards his project.
“Thor and Rocket are going to get the Aether, Nat and Clint are going to get the soul stone, and Nebula, Rhodey, and Carol are going to get the power stone.”
Sitting outside of Bucky and Tony’s room was the only surefire way of not having an angry Tony yelling at him again, or at least one that hopefully wouldn’t run away at the sight of him. Of course, he was surprised to see Tony and Bucky laughing as they walked towards him, he couldn’t help but feel a little bit of jealousy bubble up at the sight of the two of them together, but he squashed it. They barely knew one another so there was no reason to be jealous at all they barely knew each other, Steve couldn’t claim Tony’s affections, hell he hadn’t had a decent conversation with the guy. But from the times that he’s been in their room he’s become obsessed with the character that Tony had on the wall and wondered why he’d become so infatuated with its creator.
Steve stood there watching as Tony walked off, he wanted to follow the other man, but instead he opted to greet their new visitor, Rhodes and Nebula next to him, Nebula looking at Tony’s retreating figure like she wanted to follow him as well. There had been something in Tony’s eyes just before he walked away, and Steve couldn’t bring himself to ask what was wrong. It was still all too fresh in their minds, and he was sure that somewhere he still wasn’t forgiven for all the wrongs that had happened between them. That morning had been a surprise, the fact that Tony had felt comfortable enough to relax around him after Siberia, after the decimation around them, but it was still a fragile bond and one he didn’t want to push too far.
“Everyone get ready for a wild ride,” Tony said trying to make himself feel a little better about what they were about to do.
“Yes, I would love to hear the rest of the story,” Steve said, and Tony could feel Steve breathe in front of him. They were so close, all Tony would have to do is lean in and take the one thing that he had been craving for weeks, but he chickened out at the last minute and pulled back. His face was flushed, and he knew it, but he also knew that he couldn’t ruin what they had as friends.
“She’s going to be fine you know,” Steve said walking into the room. “I’m not going to let anything happen to anyone.”
“Did we get them all?” Bruce said from the platform, forcing Tony to pay attention to what they were actually doing and not throwing up again. He couldn’t wait to brush his teeth, maybe take a bath, before he actually did what he promised himself and climb Steve like a tree, because they did it, they got the stones.
“I’m alright, the suit took most of the force of a building falling on top of me, I was more worried about you, and everyone else.”
The café that the meetings were held in had been abandoned long ago, no one used the machines, but Steve made sure to upkeep the place for them. That poster on the wall was the only reminder of the fact that they had to keep moving forward.
Soon after, Peter started questioning Tony about his projects at school, Steve watching him with a fond expression, and it was nice to talk about his work. Steve had told him that one of his favorite things to do is listen to him talk about his bots, his stories, or just anything that he was working on.
“I was doing a thing,” Tony said as he slowly rose from the ground, the queasy feeling slowly abating, but he wished he had a mint or something because his mouth felt horrible. “The tale of Jonah.”
“Sorry I didn’t get the chance to meet your parents,” Steve said as Tony snuggled into him, yawning as he did. “I wish I could have been there, if anything to see the look on Bruce’s face when he realized that we’re both dating Starks.”
“Don’t move him,” Tony told him worried about what kind of damage the gauntlet had done if it was already manifesting on the scientist.
“It's definitely Barton. What he's done here, what he's been doing for the last few years... I mean, the scene that he left...,” he heard Rhodes say and seeing how Natasha was reacting, Steve realized that he had missed a lot of things over the years. “I gotta tell you, there's a part of me that doesn't even want to find him.”
Grabbing him and pulling him into his arms, Steve knew that this was why he survived being in the ice for seventy years, this life right here, “I love you,” he said kissing Tony’s temple.
“But...” he tried to argue but Steve turned the frothier on high and acted like he couldn’t hear Tony at all, was this what it felt like when a little kid is in love for the first time, because his heart was beating a little too quickly over just talking to Steve for a few minutes.
I have a head canon that Lila Barton, in the future secretly fights under an alias, as in to hide it from her dad she becomes Kate Bishop, hence America and Kate are very much a couple in this story.
Slowly he brought his head down to meet Tony’s, feeling the warmth of Tony’s breath against his mouth, knowing just how close he was to the softness of his lips, he didn’t want to turn away from it. He closed his eyes and slowly kissed him, savoring the smoothness of his mouth as Steve swiped his tongue over those perfect pink lips. When Tony opened up for him everything in his world changed, and he knew that there was no going back from this. He was sad when Tony pulled away from him and looked up at him as if questioning whether or not this was really happening.
“In all my years of conquest...violence...slaughter... It was never personal,” Thanos said as Steve looked up at him. “But I'll tell you now... what I'm about to do to your stubborn, annoying little planet... I'm gonna enjoy it. Very, very much.”
“Maybe we can just go somewhere for a while, you and me,” Steve knew it was crazy but he also felt the same way Tony was feeling.
“You know,” Steve said as he walked over. “If you want you can invite your date to one of these meetings, it might help you get to know her better, or even give you both people to talk with that you’re comfortable around.”
That was enough to startle the other man into letting go, “What?” he said before Steve took the chance and knocked him out with the shield. He knew that it was going to hurt when his other self woke up, but Steve was already tired of fighting.
“Get those stones as far away as possible!” Steve called out, and as much as he wanted to get them away, he wasn’t sure it was safe to do so.
That got Tony’s attention, the one thing that he had tried to do was keep his kids out of everything, but if they had shown up and this had all gone south, he wouldn’t know what to do with himself. “Shit,” he said pulling away. “Shit.”
“What I'm saying is, time works differently in the Quantum Realm. The only problem is right now, we don't have a way to navigate it. But what if we did? I can't stop thinking about it. What if, we could somehow control the chaos, and we could navigate it? What if there was a way to enter the Quantum Realm at a certain point in time but then exit at another point in time? Like... Like before Thanos.”
“The multiverse theory,” Shuri said looking at them. “The theory that there are an infinite number of universes out there, but even in those universes we all exist in different ways, but we still exist within our circumstances.”
“Let’s end this here for today,” he said to the group. “Thank you for sharing today, and I hope to see you all again next month.”
Before any of them could react to what could have been a world ending attack, Carol flew up and took them down one by one, Tony could hear Rhodey whistling out at his girlfriend, he was proud of his girl and he wasn’t afraid to show it. Tony was glad that his friend had found her after all of these years, even happier that they had found each other. Tony worked to make sure the debris didn’t hit anyone, even with the fighting, something like that falling on them would still take them out.
“He walked in on what he thought, hell what I thought, was you and Sharon kissing,” Bucky said, and Steve knew that his eyes were wide, he knew that somehow the one thing he had been excited about he had somehow messed up, even if was because of misunderstanding.
Tony hadn’t ever really thought of that, but what child thinks of their parents in that way either, they’re just there for you, they protect you, they work and annoy, he guess that in the end all of that hard work they’ve done over the years was to protect him and his siblings, but also to keep them safe. After Tony had been kidnapped, his parents had just fussed over him, his father paid more attention to him, even when he was critiquing his work, but he hadn’t thought about that being his father’s way of showing love.
“I know, it’s just... well I was thinking that we could actually talk about it. I know that last year you were getting over that whole thing with Bucky, so you were within your right to take some time for yourself, but Bucky’s moved on... several times. And now maybe you can too.”
“Wait, are you talking about a time machine?” Steve continued to ask questions, living with Tony for five years turns you into someone who questions everything, because if you don’t Tony would blow something up without thinking.
“I’m not a baby anymore,” he grumbled, his head was killing him, and he was glad that his students had a long weekend, because he wasn’t ready to deal with them just yet.
“Pops is going to kill you,” Riri said once she stopped laughing. “There was that rule, especially after that incident with the microwave, and you broke it.”
“That’s just you being you, honestly, I think you will change the world in a few years, but I’ll go, and if Natasha hasn’t kill Bucky by then he should go too.”
“I’ll answer it in the future, when we’re better friends,” Steve told him, rubbing the back of his neck as if he were struggling with the answer.
Please tell me if any of this makes sense? Also... what do you think of me introducing America into the story? Because I actually have this weird head canon, that will probably make its way into the story, but it involves another character that already exists in the story universe and America. But you'll find out about it later on don't worry. Hopefully, I won't be doing the chapters like this anymore, who knows.
Tony knew that it was a joke but they needed that stone, they needed Vision, and mostly he needed to hear that something was going right for once, “Think we could make one,” he said knowing that it was a long shot, but he had been thinking about finding a way to synthesize something for Vision. “I mean, I did create an element in the basement of my Malibu house so who knows what we’re capable of right now.”
“Listen fur-face, I'm covering a lot of territory. The things that are happening on Earth, are happening everywhere, on thousands of planets,” Carol was clearly irritated over it, especially if she wasn’t going to see her boyfriend in that time. Which had been a surprise to them all, but Steve and Tony took it in stride, even making the couple Kamala’s godparents.
Steve couldn’t help but laugh, seeing the hopeless look on his father’s face as he trailed behind his mother. “No laughing Steve, please, this is very stressful,” his father said to him.
Bucky came back, freshly showered and dressed, before dragging Natasha out the door, he was taking her to dinner, nothing fancy, which she liked. “It’s nice to not have to worry about a guy trying to impress me too much,” she told him as they made their way out the door. “I’ll see you later,” she called out as Bucky took her outside.
On Sunday he had driven home in a mad rush, to get his collection out of the basement, only to find that his father had been keeping them stored in a trunk, all hardcovers dating back to when Steve had just been a baby. He had stopped reading them a long time ago, but Tony’s version of the story had reignited something that he never thought would come.
“Yeah, they just don’t like that you two dated,” Peter added, and Tony couldn’t help but laugh at how blunt the boys were.
“Not really,” Steve said as the lights from what looked like a boxcar diner lit up the road in front of them. “I just wanted to take you somewhere I really liked going growing up.”
“Night Steve, and thanks for walking me home,” Tony told him as Steve gave him one of those megawatt smiles.
“Is this where Iron Man came from,” Steve was amazed that something his father had made had changed so much in someone else's life. “You wanted Cap to have a sidekick or something.”
“It’s because you do too much sometimes, but right now it’s more about where do we go from here,” Bruce looked over at him with a small sad smile. “We lost Tony, we really lost and in the only reason nothing we did worked was because we were all trying so hard to keep everything together that in the end, we were so broken that it couldn’t be fixed.”
“We're on it, Cap,” Hope said as her and Scott rushed off towards where Valkyrie pointed out the van.
“The villain thing only happened because we broke up, so don’t blame anyone but me about that,” Steve remembered being heartbroken at first, they had been weeks away from prom when Bucky had ended it, this was after one trip to the school because they wanted the incoming freshmen to get to know the campus, and it had taken all summer and the first half of their first semester before Steve had been comfortable enough to be Bucky’s friend again. His father had taken his heartbreak and used it in the story by killing off Bucky’s character and having him come back as the Winter Soldier.
“Good,” Tony said with a smile, under this protocol JARVIS is automatically muted in the room, but the cameras recorded everything they did, mostly for their own pleasure, or on those rare occasions when Steve liked to fuck him while watching their home movies. “Let’s play.”
“Yeah we did,” Tony said as he wrapped his arms around him. “We found out that there are three stones in New York during the invasion back in 2012.”
“Hey Tony,” he said and only got another hum as an answer. “So, I gave my dad some sketches along with some of your stories, and... well he was wondering if we wanted to create it as a comic run.”
Before they could answer someone knocked on the door, making Peggy push them into a closet in the corner of the room so that she could open the door and speak to the soldiers on the other side of the room.
“Which means she saves lives, and that’s something important, plus if it weren’t for her you wouldn’t be here, and I know you’re a great person, so that means she gave you the best parts of herself.”
The first person that was hired was Bucky’s girlfriend, and their childhood friend Natasha, she promptly said that she would take care of the children’s section, which only made Steve wary of her command. The second person to come in was Thor, who had wanted a more relaxed job than the one he had as a bodyguard, so Steve made him the head of security, because he didn’t have the money to install more than three cameras and the store was now three times the size it had once been. The third was Phil Coulson, who his Nana loved, but had gone to work at some chain store because he had needed more money and didn’t want to take it from the sweet old woman. Steve had given him an Assistant Manager position, the man was good with organization and Steve needed someone like that because he wanted to actually be in the store and not stuck in the back. The last person had been their old army friend Sam, who had just gotten out of his service because of an accident involving his wingman, but Steve knew that Sam and Riley had had something going on, they had kept it quiet but losing him had broken something inside of Sam.
They all smiled at him, as if they had won a battle, in reality it was just the beginning because they knew Tony’s stubborn streak when it came to their protection. America and Lila walked off holding hands, while Kamala and Miles jumped for joy at winning this small battle.
“I’m glad you like it so much,” Steve said to him and Tony just wanted to reach out even for just a moment and kiss him, but instead walked over to his desk and grabbed his tablet.
“Tony, there’s always something that we miss, and you know this,” Steve said to him before closing the book. “It’s just...”
“Yeah well, I had a lot of competition as a kid, three brothers would do that to you, but there were things that they excelled at and I didn’t, all I did was find ways for them to be even better at what they like to do, it’s why they’re good at their jobs now.”
“Okay.... cool... cool... cool,” Tony answered, feeling a little weird about the whole thing, he only ever interacted with people online, Steve is the first person to tell him something like that in person.
“Maybe, maybe not, we’ll never know unless we try,” Tony said to him, knowing full well that even some theories were meant to be changed.
“I don’t want anything to do with this, honestly I washed my hands of this the moment he told me that he was going to use it as his final project,” Tony said standing up not wanting to be in the room any longer. “If you want my opinion, yes, he did write at least half of the story, and you can grade him on that, my half of the story doesn’t need to reflect that grade.”
“I don’t think I can deal with losing them,” he said to Steve, “I already lost on kid, I don’t know what would happen if I lost all of them.”
“So, now that I’ve told you my part, you have to tell me yours,” he said trying to change his thought pattern just enough, at least to steer away from the fact that he might never get his chance with Tony if the other guy was someone Tony really liked.
He paced the room twice before noticing a picture of himself sitting on the desk, it was a picture that had been taken when he had been at Camp Leigh, and it was a strange sight to see. It was before the serum, before Captain America, before everything that had happened, but he realized in that moment just how much his life had changed. That Steve still existed, he drew with Miles, he danced with his daughters, and he smiled more whenever his husband was around. He wondered if everything had been different just how much this one photo would affect him. He couldn’t help but pick up the frame and look at his former self, someone who he hadn’t been in decades.
“But it’s nice to give something to your boyfriend’s parents,” Tony looked around when they drove down Main Street. “At least a flower shop, please, I want to make a good impression.”
“Don’t worry, I’m having dinner with my sister tonight, we have a tradition, but thanks,” Tony said before turning to his bed, and facing away from him before speaking to Bucky. “Oh, um is it James or Bucky?” Steve watched as Bucky talked to his roommate, not knowing why he already a little jealous that Bucky had Tony as a roommate.
He didn’t really want to let go of Tony’s hand, but he wanted Tony to see what he had done, mainly because for the longest time, Steve hadn’t wanted to create anything like the superheroes he had grown up with. Pulling Tony towards the bed, he sat him down before going to his drafting table and grabbing the sketchbook he had been using all weekend and handing it to Tony.
“Like hell you do,” he said letting his own mind wander to the bulge that was on the verge of breaking through Steve’s pants.
“Oh... okay, and if you get cold you and your guest can sleep inside,” she said before he could hear her muffled voice, which meant she covered the receiver on the phone. “Anyway, is this person special to you or is it one of your rowdy baseball buddies?”
There was a moment when Steve had handed him the sketchbook, where Tony wasn’t sure how to feel, he knew that Steve was an art major, he knew that Steve was the inspiration for his father when it came to Captain America. But there was also the fact that he had never seen anything that Steve had drawn up until now, with the exception of the Captain America and Iron Man drawing he had given Tony the week before.... before the whole misunderstanding. He was scared of how Steve saw him, it felt too intimate in so many ways, but he didn’t know if Steve saw him in a way that Tony would hate.
Now they were alone in the backyard, a tent set up, and a fire going so that they would be warm, the fire pit was actually at the other end of the very huge yard, so they weren’t too close to the house, which meant that they wouldn’t burn the place down if they fell asleep at any point, which was nice. Out there it almost felt like they were alone, even when Peter and Harley tried to go out and sit with them, only to be dragged back into the house by their father, because apparently the two had been grounded and needed to finish their homework before they were going to be allowed anywhere near the tent.
she wrote leaving him alone with his thoughts and his bed now very soft and comfortable bed. He set his phone to go off fifteen minutes before she would get there, so that he could at least get a few minutes of sleep if anything, all the while letting the bed take him forever.
“Can I read one of the stories one day?” he asked, amazed that he could want anything to do with something he had hated for so long.
Before they could keep talking, and probably freeze to death where they stood, Steve took Tony’s hand and walked him into the diner. When he had first come out to his parents as bisexual, his parents worried that the town wouldn’t approve of him in any way, when he had started dating Bucky, the woman who owned the diner had welcomed them like they were her own. Steve had later found out that she was married to one of the school teachers, but they had kept it secret for a long time at least before marriage was legal, but at the time she had found that she needed to embrace the kids who were afraid of coming out. Now the diner had a Pride flag hanging on its walls, and pictures of couples all over, though his and Bucky’s picture was on the wall, the break-up had been something that she had helped Steve through. He owed her a lot, and he couldn’t pay her back enough for being that one person who let him be who he wanted to be without any questions.
“Let them have a moment,” Tony said as everyone gathered inside. “We’ll reconvene in an hour, FRIDAY, order some food for everyone here,” he called out to his AI before pulling Steve along with him. “Chinese would be good, and maybe Pizza if people don’t want that.”
“What’s on your mind?” Steve said trying to stop the train of thought going through his mind right at that moment. He didn’t want to live through another misunderstanding like the one they had had the week before.
“No, just you,” Tony said which only made Steve blush, it wasn’t what he was expecting to hear at all.
“You can take what you need for the trip,” Tony said knowing that he wasn’t going to be on that mission. He looked up from where he was to see the resignation in Steve’s eyes, they were going to be separated for this, but this wasn’t a mission for a large group of people, they needed stealth and that was more Steve’s expertise, not Tony’s.
“That’s okay, as long as it’s just you and me and the stars in the sky nothing else matters, this is what I wanted to tell you the other night before everything went to shit.”
“There’s this kid, he’s about your age in fact, he’s really smart and a little hyper, and if you and him ever got together you’d be a terror to us all,” he said thinking about Peter and the whole incident with the Vulture, and how guilty Tony felt for taking the suit away from Peter when he so quickly put himself in danger. “He’s also Spiderman.”
“They’ve been gone less than five minutes and now you bring up cookies,” Tony held Morgan close, shrugging his shoulders. “Yeah sure why not. Morguna what kind of cookies do you want to make with your dad and your pops?”
“You think,” his mother called out. “You try carrying around two watermelons, and then squeezing them out of your body through a hole smaller than my fist, forget it, there’s no use in explaining this… anyway, where’s this boy?”
Pulling up to his childhood home, made him more nervous, mainly because he hasn’t introduced his parents to anyone that he’s been interested in, not since Bucky and him had broken up. There hadn’t really been anyone that had stuck, not like Tony who had just stormed into his life and changed everything he ever knew. All it took was one look at Tony’s wall, seeing Iron Man and Captain America together, and everything changed from that moment. Tony made his heart race, he talked a mile a minute sometimes, Steve couldn’t understand half of what he was saying but it didn’t matter to him. He liked hearing Tony talk about things that he was passionate about, it’s good to see that kind of fire in a person.
“Tony, I’ll go anywhere as long as I’m there standing next to you,” he said before opening the car door. “Now come on, I have something to show you.”
“I would do it, but I’m honestly not ready for it,” Scott said looking out at the group. “I don’t know if I can do it without messing something up.”
“I may not know you that well, but I’m almost certain that you don’t actually eat, hell you usually sneak out right after I get home, though I’m never sure where the hell you go, so I doubt you sleep a lot too, since I can see those dark circles around your eyes.”
“Yeah, they’re on one of the screens,” Bruce said pointing towards the mixture of screens all around them, “but I’ve been looking at everything for so long and nothing makes any sense, so I really don’t know where to start.”
“Bruce, how did you get here,” Steve said first in surprise, seeing his older brother walking towards them, he knew that Bruce was working somewhere though they didn’t know where, because he had transferred recently.
“They’re going to need to know they’re strong,” his father had told him when Steve gave him a look. “It’s my gift to my kids, sue me.”
He had gotten to the other side of the kids' section when he saw something that was not right, and apparently, he hadn’t been the only one to have seen it because there was one of Steve’s co-workers watching from the side where she was shelving books. He knew that her name was Natasha, he had come into the store enough to know the names of all of the people who worked there. Anyone would wonder why some old man was sitting in the children’s section with a magazine, yes there was a chair there, but mostly it was for the parents to wait in as the kids looked through the books.
Unfortunately, when Scott came back the second them, he was an old man “Ow! My back!” Scott said which only made Hope laugh even harder than she had before. Shuri snorted next to her causing Bruce to start laughing too.
“So, what does this mean, that he’s going to use his family’s name and money to get a better grade just because he helped me, what the hell,” Ty’s voice started getting higher and higher. “Where’s the fairness in that Professor, I’ve worked just as hard as he has, so he can’t take this from me.”
“Sam likes you Sharon, he’s asked me a million things about you, but for some reason when it comes to even trying to ask you out, he starts to talk about everything but,” Steve was almost certain that when it came to Sam actually saying something, it was more along the lines of how Steve couldn’t really say anything to Tony for a long time, well until he found the one thing that Tony could help him with.
“Clint, where’s Nat?” Bruce said pulling Tony out of his thoughts and forcing him to notice a very empty spot next to Clint, but it couldn’t be, Nat would have come back, Steve had told him that she had wanted someone back from the snap.
“If I had to guess, we messed with time, and it decided to mess with us,” he said as he started checking Steve for injuries. “As for the kids, I haven’t heard anything yet, FRIDAY is working on getting in contact with everyone.”
“Yeah, what kind of doctor was he?” she asked them and while Tony knew the answer was buried somewhere in his brain he wasn’t entirely sure.
“Maybe that’s just what we all really need,” Tony hadn’t realized that healing themselves involved becoming a real family. “We all need a family, though it’ll be hard some days, I still don’t think I’m completely ready to be Iron Man again.”
“Because before, you didn’t have me,” Carol said looking Bruce in the eye, almost like she was willing the Hulk to challenge her. Tony was still uncertain about what she was, she wasn’t air force, not anymore anyway.
There was nothing better than the feeling he had at the moment, with Tony by his side, his family there, he was happy. Hours later, after his parents had kicked them all out of the hospital, Steve sat in the living room with Tony at his side. They had all changed into more comfortable clothes, Tony in one of Steve’s hoodies, his contacts out and his glasses back on. He looked comfortable, but Steve wished that they had had the chance to dance at the party, hell he wished that he had been able to go to the party.
“I am actually, it’s new but I know that he won’t hurt me,” Tony said, and he knew in his heart that it was true. “And before you ask why I’m so sure of this, well look at Bucky, who even after their break-up Steve would still want to be friends with him.”
There was a moment where his eyes met Steve’s and the blackness that stared back at him was enough to swallow him whole, he was never sure where this relationship was going, but he was sure that the way Steve looked at him during these intimate moments were genuine. Without taking his eyes off of Steve’s he slowly moved one finger in and started moving it in and out while feeding his boyfriend his dick at the same time. Even without the vibrator on, he knew that Steve was enjoying this as much as Tony was, and it was only the start.
“You can go back,” he said pulling away from Bucky and turning towards Tony. “And... Tony I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have been in there alone,” he felt bad for running Tony off, especially since Tony had been right about it also being his room. Bucky waiting outside looking around for him before spotting him, Steve held out his hand telling Bucky to give him a minute.
“I like yours too,” Peter said before his eyes widened. “Oh my god you’re like me,” he said and Miles just smiled.
He couldn’t help but beam at the smile that Steve gave him, “It’s a surprise,” Steve told him, “I hope you finished everything you needed to finish for your classes, I don’t want to keep you from your work.”
“So... those were your parents,” Tony said as Steve sat down and drew him closer, Tony’s back to Steve’s front, it was nice and very warm. There was something about having Steve hold onto him that made him happy, now he understood what if felt like to actually fall for someone without the extra baggage of him being a Stark kid.
“Look, we go back, we get the stones before Thanos gets them... Thanos doesn't have the stones. Problem solved,” Scott said to them.
“How do you two know each other,” Sam asked, knowing full well who Tony was, there was no denying that Tony himself was a presence no matter how much he tried hiding himself at the school.
Steve looked to see that Clint and Bruce had joined Natasha and Rhodes, which he hadn’t realized how public that little kiss had become.
“Yeah, well I’ve been a little busy,” Tony was rubbing his head and now Steve worried that there was something there that he had missed, it felt like everything reversed itself all of a sudden. “How’s Aunt Peggy? I haven’t called her in a while.”
“Don’t think about it too much,” Steve told him as they set themselves up in the conference room, they were going to brainstorm until the kids arrived for dinner.
So, yes part of this actually happened while I worked at Borders, but we weren't allowed to do anything, security was responsible for dealing with it. The amount of perverts that came into my store was astonishing and really scary.
“Who picked their names,” Bucky said and when Tony just rolled his eyes at him, he continued. “Sorry but they sound more like Norse gods than regular rich kids.”
“Uh yeah, we just came here to tell you that she arrived,” Clint said a small smile on his face. “So, we’re going to go now and deal with some stuff,” Steve was sure that he had never seen Clint smirk like that before running off to do something else. It was good that after losing his wife he would be able to smile like that.
“Plus, the twins on the way,” Steve said, his parents weren’t old, but they worked harder for their family than anyone Steve has ever known.
“Ish, no’ booken,” Tony said and while it was cute to hear him say it, and nice to see him there trying to help Natasha, but now Steve was just worried, and wasn’t sure if the store’s insurance would cover a customer getting injured to this point.
“Nat,” he called out to her as she reached him. “I’m going to go with Mr. Stark to the hospital now, you and Bucky are in charge until I get back.”
“Yeah because complaining about whether I should have told the world that I was getting my Ph. D when I was eighteen would have been better, you would have just teased me from the moment we met,” Tony said before throwing a broccoli at James, the whole scene made her smile, this was something she had never thought that she would get, but they were happy and it was the best thing she could have asked for. Their lives hadn’t been easy growing up, but she wouldn’t change at thing if it meant that she would have met James, or that Tony would have met Steve. This was destiny’s way of making up for the things that Tony had gone through, just by having him fall in love with someone who was close to the person she fell for.
“We’ll work on whatever we can here,” Tony said trying to show a little bit of confidence to his friends. “I’ll see about reviving Vision with Shuri, who knows maybe she’ll have some ideas about what to do with the notes we have from the scepter of doom.”
“Not entirely,” he smiled back. “I just figured that maybe we needed some time away, do something that didn’t involve being Captain America and Iron Man, to find our way after losing so much.”
“Nice to know that you understand my plans,” Steve smiled at him, and Tony couldn’t be happier with how they were with one another.
“Wasn’t there a guy in Hot Tub Time Machine that looked like the Winter Soldier,” Clint said making everyone stop and look at him. “What, you know I’m right, hell I’m sure if we gave the guy Barnes’ haircut it would be an exact replica.”
“What’s on your mind,” she said, and he knew that it had everything to do with the fact that he had been sleeping and looked near death with exhaustion. This time it wasn’t the equations running through his head, but the story that he couldn’t write. He did every other project but that one, because he wasn’t sure of whether it would be good enough. Ty had really done a number on him, hell the failure from Professor Coulson had rattled him as well.
“No one blamed you Bruce,” Natasha said looking at him with something in her eyes, their relationship hadn’t worked out, but their friendship still stood there in the ashes. They were a family, one that that stuck together.
As he finished saying this, he could see the blue of Steve’s eyes get swallowed up by nothing but blackness, he could have blamed it on the darkness of the room but then Steve licked his lips and gave him a quick smile and Tony automatically knew that his boyfriend was game for whatever Tony had planned.
They sat back on his bed, leaning against the wall, just sitting there in the quiet, it was weird for him to be able to sit still for even a moment, but with Natasha they would always have these moments together. She used those moments to get his mind to calm down mostly, especially on days when he was running on too little sleep, when the equations in his head wouldn’t stop coming and kept him up at all hours of the night. That’s how he started writing, when they were sitting around talking about what it would have been like to fight alongside Captain America.
“As long as there’s someone to love and care for her, I won’t deny it to her, or any of these kids,” she said, they had all lost something, so even one kid gaining a family was something that they cherished. “I’ll get the paperwork.”
“Not really, I mean your dad inspires kids every day, your mom probably does her own thing too, we’re the same, the only difference is that my last name means something to the world at large, I don’t really care about that,” he said and Steve understood what Tony was saying, they could be the same and different at the same time. “What does your mom do anyway?”
“Cheez Whiz?” Rhodey said and Tony gave him a nasty look, it wasn’t the time to antagonize a Norse God, and Rhodey should have known better.
“You don’t even know what I need help with, for all you know it could be the most mundane topic in the world.”
“He’s been... well he’s been everywhere,” she sat at the edge of the table. “There were rumors at first, of an assassin named Ronin going around, killing those who he thought shouldn’t have survived the decimation, mostly mobsters, gang members, and the cartel.”
“Shouldn’t she tell you her last name while you’re getting to know each other,” Steve asked and Tony was curious why she hadn’t told him, it was one thing for Natasha to not say something, but another one if she lied about who she was.
“No. No, of course not. No, not a time machine. It's more like a...,” Scott stopped before saying “Yeah, a time machine. I know it's crazy. But I can't stop thinking about it. There's gotta be some way... No, it's crazy.”
“Right,” he said looking at the same place that Steve was looking at. “Well, imagine you’re SHIELD, running a quasi-fascistic intelligence organization. Where do you hide it?”
“See,” Tony said pulling away, and honestly Steve missed the weight of him on his chest. “All you really did was just look for an excuse to be near me because you wanted to be, I’m pretty certain that if you had just studied on your own you would have passed that class regardless.”
“Can you take a look at this,” Ty said as soon as Tony sat down at his regular table. “I feel like it doesn’t look right for some reason.”
Riri, shared Tony’s love for technology and had secretly, well she thought it had been a secret, began to build Iron Heart. It was her own armor and while Tony was scared of her using it, he wasn’t going to stop her from creating it, but he was going to make sure that it was safe for her to use. Kamala, had been a surprise, she had developed powers and no one understood why it had happened, neither did she, but they worked on making sure that she was alright, Bruce stopped by to check on them and collected samples from her and Miles to make sure that nothing was going to be detrimental to their futures. So, since Riri had her armor, Tony worked on stuff for Miles and Kamala as well, because Tony wanted them all to be safe. Miles and Steve giving him designs for Miles’ suit, and then having Miles paint on the material before. Tony put KAREN into the suit, so that she would have someone to talk to. He wanted someone to have Peter’s legacy with them, and she was a part of Peter as much as FRIDAY and JARVIS had been a part of his.
“Why can’t we help?” Kamala was the first to speak after the three oldest kids talked in hushed voices. “We want to help.”
“That would be alright Young Miss,” he said giving Tony a small smile and a wink. Tony knew that smile, it was his pity smile, because it meant that Tony would be completely alone, and Tony wouldn’t want to take away the small amount of quiet time that Jarvis would have with his wife, not the way his family normally worked the couple.
“You won’t be there for long, for us it’ll be seconds, for you probably a few minutes,” Bruce explained as he started adjusting the console, Shuri standing next to him, while Scott gave Clint a thumbs up. “Don’t change anything, you’re only going to be there to observe, may grab something to see if you can bring it back with you.”
“So, I’m guessing this is your revenge for what I did,” Steve said to him as he slowly pulled at the thing that was now holding him to the bed. “I didn’t think you had it in you.”
In that moment Steve cried as well, they had been friends once upon a time, even with everything that had happened, he still wished for more, but he didn’t want to push the boundaries on their fragile bond. “This time,” he said whispering into Tony’s ear, “When I say together, I mean we’re in this together, even if we fix everything, I won’t leave your side, I promise.”
Taking a deep breath, he opened the book and saw picture after picture of the Iron Man armor, the way he had described it in his stories, or a variation of the drafts that had been up on his wall in his room. Some of them with the faceplate turned up, and what could be Tony in ten years, with a goatee and a smile. He kept turning the pages, just to see how Steve saw him and how he saw Iron Man. Then he got towards the final pages, and saw himself, his glasses sliding down his face his own arms up in the air, probably talking about something Steve didn’t understand, but that was how Steve saw him, as a passionate person.
“He gave you a key, to our room, why???” Tony wasn’t sure why he was angry, maybe it’s because his roommate let his ex-boyfriend or boyfriend or whatever, have a key to their room, where Tony kept all of his stuff, or it could have been the crush he already had on the blonde in front of him, and he wasn’t sure if he was dating someone, or single. He didn’t know what to do or where to go, gathering his laptop and his writing notebook and throwing it in his backpack, before rushing towards the door probably hadn’t been the best idea in the world.
Tony pulled out of Steve’s mouth before Steve could push him over the edge completely, seeing the hooded look in Steve’s eyes as Tony’s ass bumped against Steve’s own stiff erection was enough to throw both of them over the edge. If it weren’t for the ring on Steve’s dick, and Tony’s willpower at the moment, then this would have been over a long time ago. Grabbing the last toy, he had hidden away, a cock ring for Tony, colored in Steve’s blues, with a little star on the center, Tony slipped it on before activating it. He loved technology so much, especially when he could create things like this.
The door swung open again and his roommate stood there looking at him, “We need to talk,” Bucky said, and Tony knew that this was the moment where he would lose his first college friend, all because he fell for their ex-boyfriend.
“I hope you brought one for me you punk,” Bucky says to Steve eyeing the coffee in Steve’s hand. Causing Tony to turn back towards his computer trying to hide the size of the cup in his hand, and he knows he’s doing a bad job of it too, because it’s a little hard to hide something that smells as good as that coffee.
“According to what I overheard it’s was Nat, so I’m guessing it’s short for Natasha or Natalie or something,” Bucky answered a grin on his face. “She’s perfect Steve, I swear it, but I’ve never had to work this hard to get someone’s attention, so I’m afraid that all this work would go to waste and she won’t like me at all.”
Steve knew that she wasn’t fine, but she still had Clint and his kids to keep her company, as well as the new team that had somehow formed, even though they had gone off towards other planets. So, Steve put them in Tony’s Audi and drove off, their first stop on their journey to find somewhere to settle ended up being a few hours north of the compound. Steve in his search to find a place for them had found an old abandoned property nestled deep in the woods, a huge lake next to the house. He had contacted the real estate company handling the sale and brought it dirt cheap, it had been abandoned for over ten years, mostly because people complained that it was too far away from any kind of civilization for them to live in it long term. People in the town south of the lake had called it a cursed location, but in reality, it just hadn’t had the right owner.
“If it’s life and death, then it’s a Steve Rogers mission,” she said to them before placing her hands on her hips. “I guess I need to help you out of here then.”
Tony nodded, giving Ty a smile before going through the pages and pages of dialogue, quickly typing it into his laptop, every once and a while he adjusted the whole thing to better fit what he was writing. It was second nature for him to fix and adjust things, he did it with his stories and he did it with whatever he was inventing, his own phone had been created by him, there’s only one in the world, because he had hated what his mother had given him. The only thing in there was the chip for the phone company, everything else came from his need to fix and adjust, so he used the same on the dialogue that Ty had given him.
“If you don’t get to sleep after this well it’s your own fault for it,” Bucky told him while pointing at the coffee, before sighing and digging into a plate of mac and cheese. “So, if you don’t mind me asking, but what’s a Stark doing at this school anyway?”
“Yeah, I know, I know,” he said trying to find a weak spot, but his other self landed a hit and his compass fell out. The picture inside was different, because it was one of Tony and the kids, he kept it close to his heart at all times. But he didn’t think that it would jar his other self so much.
“I though she went home with Tony,” he said, but somehow, he knew that it wasn’t the case. “I would have thought that they would have been at home most of the week.”
“Again, science had something to do with it,” Steve told Tony with a smile on his face, it was one of the only things that really connected him with Captain America. “I did have some experimental stuff done growing up, and some of it had helped, I got stronger and I could play baseball and I go out on dates and all.”
“There’s that too,” Steve said as he parked at the diner. “The town is small, but we’re not too far from Main Street, this is just the best diner in my little corner of the world.”
With a wave, Steve joined Tony as they walked down the long underground path, holding his hand, they were going back home. They knew that when the stones went back to their own times, they would have to avoid bumping into themselves. It was a long hard journey they were on, but it was worth it if it meant that their family would be whole again.
“I thought you couldn’t come,” Peter added as he rushed to meet his brother throwing his arms around Bruce.
It was warm and his pillow was hard, but it felt comforting for some reason and smelled like coffee, so he burrowed himself deeper into the feeling. It felt nice, until the door slammed against the wall and his pillow jumped before falling off the bed with a thump. That was when he knew that it hadn’t been a pillow, but it had been a very real Steve and his hard muscles that Tony had been snuggling into. Tony had almost forgotten that they had climbed into the bed together, he had been so tired that he had gotten into bed without realizing it and fallen asleep, he thought that he had been dreaming the whole thing and that he was still working on his project.
“Shit, this isn’t good,” Bucky said just as Natasha groaned, which meant he was missing something, something huge. “Tony was here.”
“As you wish,” Steve said, but he didn’t let go of Tony’s dick, instead he kissed him hard on the mouth, slipping his tongue in and slowly playing with Tony’s tongue as he slowly rubbed circles on Tony’s cock. All Tony could do was moan into the kiss and adjust his hips to make it easier for Steve to plow into him.
“Joseph Rogers, so help me I will throw something at you if you don’t stop hovering, I want to meet Steve’s boyfriend and you’re not going to stop me from doing that, I’ve been sitting around all day, I can walk for a little while.”
Bucky let out a frustrated huff after a few minutes, “I’m getting nothing,” he said dialing the phone again. “I’d never expected any of them to be without their phones.”
“Good, cause if we blow the grid, I don’t wanna lose tiny here in the 1950s,” he said wiping his forehead. Steve saw as they alll turned to look at Bruce, they weren’t sure if he was joking or if he was telling the truth.
There’s a visible change in their relationship after that, Tony knows this, he understands this, but it’s still a little strange. Especially since he opened his eyes and saw a beardless Steve Rogers in front of him, chiseled to perfection. Steve had always been good at giving speeches, especially when things were going south fast, he hadn’t said much when Tony was yelling at him, but he made up for it in spades at that moment. Now, he was just Steve Rogers, that guy he got to know over the years, his friend, and while Tony wished for more he was just going to take what he could get.
“Okay, well I’m going to go get ready, and I’ll be back in a bit, no maiming while I’m gone,” Bucky said before grabbing his stuff and heading to the bathroom.
“Yeah it seems that your brother is dating my brother,” Tony said as he came to a stop next to Steve. “Hi.”
“No, we won’t, come on,” he couldn’t help but smile as he got Tony into the car. Rushing off to the other side as fast as he could. “You see, well... the second part of this date is that I want to take you to my house.”
“I’m sorry,” Clint whispered as he pulled his daughter into his arms, “I’m sorry,” he continued as the tears fell.
It was a reminder that Steve still had work to do, even when he was sure that he would never be able to hold onto that shield again. The weight of what it represents hurts him more than anything, the fact that he had hurt the man he loved with it made it even worse. He sometimes wondered if he were fit to be a hero after everything that had happened, but it wasn’t a concern that he voiced out loud to anyone. But Tony understood, Tony who had gone through the worse of his depression with Steve anchoring him had told him that he was worthy of the shield, that he should forgive himself because Tony had forgiven him. So that one of the biggest reasons why he ran the meetings, he was learning to forgive himself for what had happened.
“You’re right, I do,” he said hopeful, he said before saluting to Steve. “Because if Captain America is telling me good luck then nothing can go wrong.”
“Yes Professor,” Tony answered picking up his laptop and putting it in his bag, “Is there something you need?”
It was the one moment where he was willing to flick Scott across the room, because if Scott looked at his husband’s ass one more time, Tony was surely going to find a way to squash the little bugger. Scott hit Tony’s other self on the beard, which only caused the man to scratch it as if it itched, which worked well for Ant-man. Who slid down onto the arc reactor.
It took two weeks before everything in Tony’s life went to hell, he should have known that nothing good would last forever. The thing was that... the first thing that happened… well it happened during his fiction writing class, as his professor pulled him over and explained to him that his story sounded too much like the Captain America comics.
Jarvis had gone home after that, why would he stay to watch him and Tony, and secretly Steve was glad that they were alone, especially when Tony fell asleep halfway through the first movie, his head on Steve’s chest. It felt warm, and it had made him happy, even to the point that he had fallen asleep soon after. If this was what his life would be like with Tony around, he wouldn’t trade it for the world.
“Yeah well it would have been fine if we had a longer ignition line running farther from the fence,” Peter called out in his defense.
He was too shocked to noticed that he hadn’t fully put the shelf back on correctly and the thing fell down and hit his foot, “Fuck,” he yelled out, jumping up and down.
“Steve when I broke it off with you, you were at my door an hour later trying to fix things, I know I had been the one to break it off, but I hadn’t expected you to try to fix it so quickly, and then I had to break your heart even more. I sometimes wish we had never dated because even now you don’t treat me like you did when we had just been friends, you act like you’re going to lose our friendship all over again if you say or do the wrong thing.”
“Yeah well they didn’t have any singles left and they told me that if I roomed with a freshman, they would lower the cost of the dorm, which means I would have to work less to pay for everything this year, so it’s a win-win.”
Hey! The door's this way, pal,” Howard said as Tony had tried to sneak out the room without being seen.
When Tony started traveling for work again, never too far because he needed to get back to the lake house, it was home, and sometimes being too far made him panic because he was afraid Steve would vanish, so the business trips were confined to the tri-state area. It was on one of these trips, to Jersey of all places, where Tony found himself helping a young girl who was crying on the side of the road near a pile of dead flowers. Someone else who had lost everything because they hadn’t done enough. Though she told him constantly that it wasn’t his fault, the first person outside of the Avengers to do so, he noticed that she looked a little malnourished.
She nodded at him, he knew she thought the same thing, but he also knew that like with any of the survivors around them, they all wished to change everything, to bring back those they lost, but they had to contend with the very real possibility that they might not have the option to go back to save them.
“That’s nice of you Steve, but I don’t even have your number, and I heard Bucky, you guys are going to a party tonight.”
“What was it like? Meeting Bucky’s parents?” Steve asked and Tony was actually curious about this, because Natasha hadn’t met anyone’s parents before.
“Thank you,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper as he to the picture and put it on his wall next to all of the others ones, careful not to ruin it. “No one has ever given me one like that.”
Tony hummed into his chest, and Steve knew that he was losing him, they were tired, all of them were, especially after all of the excitement from the whole day. But he knew that there was one more thing that he needed to tell Tony, something important, because Tony would love the news.
With a smirk on his face, Thanos calls forth an army larger than the one Steve had seen in Wakanda five years before. He wants to run at him, if it meant protecting the ones he loved, he’d take down the world.
“I’ll run the Avengers,” she said looking at Tony’s vacant stare. “Just take care of him, Rhodes and I can run this place, plus we have new friends. We’ll be fine.”
Steve could only sigh as Tony mumbled something next to him, but he couldn’t hear him, and Steve was sure that his nose was broken. “Darcy,” he called out only to have Clint come to him instead.
The next morning as his students walked into class, he saw that his phone had a million notifications from Instagram, he couldn’t check his account, not when he had a classroom filled with students, but he would look at it later.
The group convened around the table, as food was handed out but no one said a thing about what they had been discussing, Steve and Tony shared a look with one another about the whole situation, but they didn’t know how to bring it up until Thor opened a bottle of liquor in front of them.
“Daddy,” she yelled as her screeching sneakers came looking for them, “Papa,” she called out and Tony groaned.
“Use you’re words my love,” Steve said, but all Tony could do was mumble in coherent words, the word love would have been enough to send him over the edge if it weren’t for that fucking ring, he was going to melt it down to nothing after this.
“She must be angry at me about that whole thing,” he said remembering the feeling of Peter fading in his arms. “I’m angry about the whole thing.”
“You know, you two are made for each other,” Rhodey said as stepped out of the War Machine suit. “They’re two idiots that’s what they are.”
Steve just mumbled to him before dozing off, which shouldn’t have been as cute as it was but honestly it was the best thing in the world. “J, put a timer on my watch for forty-five minutes please,” he said as he stood up from the bed and rushed off towards his workshop.
“I may have, they may have been there all along all it took was getting over what I had with you,” she was smiling at him, a little blush to match her red hair. He wasn’t sure who it could be, since his real friends are a group of superheroes, and her and Happy, a few others in between.
Sharon instead walked over to one other the other workstations and pulled out a machine that he hadn’t ever seen, “This was where we found Fury’s car, when we found it, well it was on and there was a symbol on it, the same one that’s on her outfit.”
I actually rewrote a good chunk of the movie into this, why? Because I'm mad with power, plus it was an interesting thing to do, to make it a real Steve/Tony event.
“Cool, we could even get a jump start on that midterm assignment, if you want to be partners,” Ty said to him, giving him the biggest smile Tony was sure the guy could have, it was disarming for some reason.
“I think we should go somewhere together for Spring Break,” Rhodey said to the group as they sat around the coffee table trading food cartons and fighting over the dumplings.
“So, I was thinking,” Ty said as they all started to pack up after class. “That you could come over to the Library today and we could work on the midterm project. Get an early start on it and everything.”
“Later,” Steve said not wanting his date to fall apart just because Tony wanted to invent something. “I’m going to introduce him to Mom and Dad and then we’re going to the yard and that’s it.”
“Yeah,” Steve answered, not as cranky as before. “Natasha and I talked while we ate, and she gave them to me. I’m sorry for being a brat the other day.”
Anyways, back to his first writing class, he was the youngest person in the class, and he was alright with it, he had to get special permission to be in the class too, even with him skipping everything else, because the professor was very adamant that the student weren’t encumbered with a heavy course load. But it was also one of the school’s most prestigious professors, a New York Times bestselling author named Phil Coulson, he had written several books about a team of agents within a government agency, most of the novels diving deep into the corruption of government and the fragility of human relationships. Never knowing who to trust, Tony had loved the books, because he knew that you couldn’t trust everyone you met, there was always someone who had an ulterior motive. Sometimes he thought about Natasha as one of the agents, but that was only because she was very sneaky and shared one particular characteristic with one of the main characters, and that was her love of knives.
“FRIDAY,” Tony called out. “Tell the kids to suit up because I’m going to go kill them in a minute, right after I take care of Bruce.”
Steve couldn’t help but feel embarrassed, not only for himself, because he didn’t recognize the guy for being a Stark, but also for Tony who was now turning a slight shade of red. “Buck, please be nice to him.”
“Really smarter than Shuri?” he said joking but only because he knew that Steve was trying to cheer him up.
“We had been a little busy,” Tony said feeling tired already. “You know you’re small, but you’re talking loud.”
“Rumlow,” he says watching as the men around him all started getting suspicious of him. “I just got a call from the Secretary. I’m going to be running point on the scepter.”
“So, what would it mean if he used the stones a second time,” Steve said as everyone in the room looked around, none of them sure about the implications of what would happen if Thanos continued to use the infinity stones.
“He’s a little depressed Steve,” Bruce said the last time he had seen him. “He lost a lot before Thanos showed up, and lost even more since that first fight.”
“I... um... I don’t want to forget,” Steve continued when Tony hadn’t relaxed. “I think this is going really fast, but the last few months have made me happier than I ever been, and I just wanted to let you know.”
The birthplace of Captain America was something to behold, mainly because the bunker hadn’t existed when Steve had been there, but it was still a place that would change their future in more ways than they could have thought of. He wished at that moment that he could tell them that Hydra had infiltrated SHIELD but with everything that happened when they had gone to 2012, Tony wasn’t very keen on changing anymore of the past than was possible.
They all got ready for the day, eating breakfast, talking like they weren’t about to do something incredibly stupid, before they ended up sitting in the conference room, Tony watched the holographic displays, the stones displayed along with their times and locations, each team under a stone. The biggest team going out there was Tony and Steve’s because they needed to get three of the stones, and one screw up would end this mission before it began. They couldn’t fault themselves if something went wrong, they had to get in and get out, and when the stones needed to get back to their time, that person was responsible for it landing in the right place at the right time.
“Let me go deal with all of this, and then I’m taking Mr. Stark to the hospital,” he said to Thor, not wanting to let the customer know about his relationship with Tony.
Tony could feel hope bloom in his chest at hearing this, “But I heard that Sharon and Steve had a thing going on since last semester or something,” she finished and with it killing all the hope he had for anything, this is why he didn’t want to get attached to anyone, he didn’t want that hope to linger. He had tried in high school, dated around, got together with two different girls, one used him and the other had been an exchange student who had moved back to Japan after the semester had been over. Both had broken his heart, and he couldn’t deal with that, he was supposed to be the future of Stark Industries’ Research and Development, not falling in love and getting his heart broken.
“Alright, so five years ago, right before Thanos, Hope’s mother sent me a message though a connection we formed while I was subatomic, she was in a place called the Quantum Realm. The Quantum Realm is like its own microscopic universe,” Scott started, and he had that look in his eyes that Tony got right before he started saying a million things. “To get in there, you have to be incredibly small. So, anyway the last few months we’ve been going over all of the data from when her mother had been trapped inside of the Quantum Realm, and where she had been missing in our time for decades, for her it had been much longer for some reason. So, we tested somethings out, first I went into the machine while Hope took in the data.”
“But,” she started but he just looked at her, she knew that she was in trouble and there was no getting out of that. “Fine... geez, I hate that look.”
“Should I keep going?” Tony asked feeling almost out of breath for a moment, because Steve was so close to him, and Tony hadn’t realized just how pink Steve’s lips were, or how blue his eyes had been. Were they always that color or was it just because they had never gotten this close to one another?
Every so often Ty would show up and read what he had done, amazed that he had gotten it so quickly, “This is really good,” Ty would tell him before someone from the library staff came around the corner and told him to get back to work.
“We’ll get back to Morgan learning that word from you later... wow... That's amazing, and... terrifying,” he said to Tony, and honestly it was terrifying to think about.
“We start at the beginning... well without accidentally creating a murderbot,” he said heading over to the holoscreen that held all of their notes that they had collected about the mind stone, from before Vision came to be, even some that Tony had gotten from him after he had come to life. He wondered if there was a way to make everything work. Pulling up the notes from the element that had once powered his heart and working on calculations about the powers of the stone, Tony and Bruce worked on every calculation they could think about. Nothing was working, and Tony knew that Bruce was a little frayed at that point. The battle of New York felt like a million years ago, that first conversation in the lab when they were on the helicarrier, everything felt like a horrible dream that led to this.
“I’m afraid of what would happen if someone took advantage of his generosity, it’s happened before and he retreated so far into himself afterwards, I honestly don’t want that happening again.”
The city seemed as though the world stopped moving forward, it was a dreary scene to behold every time that Steve drove towards his weekly group meeting. The fact that a city that always seemed so alive with people, even in the darkest of times, now seemed as though it stopped moving at all. Whenever he drove in with Tony, he always made sure to keep the conversation going, to keep Tony especially from looking out at what the city looked like. For them, home was an isolated place, where only a few came near, there was nowhere around that would remind them of their one failure, it was a place for them to be able to move on from what had happened.
By the end of the night the story was done, and Tony felt like he had accomplished something that had nothing to do with his father’s plan for him. It felt good, but as they were leaving the library, he had noticed just how dark it was outside, and he was alone because Ty had lived in the opposite direction. Tony wasn’t huge on walking alone in the dark, blame it on being kidnapped when he had been little, sometimes all he remembered was the darkness and nothing else.
