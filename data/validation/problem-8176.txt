It’s peculiar and a little concerning and Steve wants to get to the bottom of it. If Tony doesn’t like the mirror, the solution is simple: they’ll just get rid of it and replace it with some other giant piece of decor. No big deal. But why does Tony hate this mirror?
It’s minutes to midnight on New Year’s Eve and Tony is still working, eyeballs deep in fine tuning the lines of his latest code while Queen blares from his speakers. He’s deep in concentration staring at his screen, arranging and rearranging what he already has, but the damn thing still won’t work properly. He’s nodding along to the music, staring critically at a line that simply will not cooperate when he feels the hairs on the back of his neck prickle up, and before he can turn, huge arms wind around his waist and pull him snug against a broad chest behind him.
“You know,” Loki drawls from across the enormous kitchen island. “It would've been a lot easier to make brownies.”
She understands him differently than his best friend Rhodey does. Where Rhodey sees him as a bright fire that needs containment and soothing, a liquid cool counterpart to where Tony burns out of control, Janet burns just as bright as he does, blazing hot and destructive.
Steve looks gobsmacked, but he regains himself quickly just as another snowball hits him on the side of his face. His head snaps to the side to see Thor grinning gleefully from a few yards away, another handful of snow at the ready. Tony watched as Steve’s look of betrayal melts into one of determination as Steve launches snow back at Thor. Everything devolves into a snowball fight after that, and soon, everyone abandons their skis to participate in all out war.
Tony laughs awkwardly and has to remind himself that his friends don’t know their relationship is fake. He can’t just blurt it out that Steve is too perfect and he’s too good for Tony even as a pretend boyfriend and Tony is in way too deep with this mess. Steve is too good for him, and that realization hurts like a bitch.
“No I don’t,” Tony protests, his words tapering off into a wide yawn.
“Ma was so happy when Buck and I got into our school,” Steve continues. “The testing program paid our tuition and she was so relieved knowing I got into a good school. She thinks there's a better chance of me getting into a good college with our prestige, but if you ask me, it just makes it harder with smartypants like you and Jane Foster always topping the dean's list,” he says. There's no hint of resentment in his voice, but rather something that sounds a lot like pride. “Now we just have to get one of those fancy football scholarships. I think maybe my chances are pretty good after we won state. The Boston College scout was watching the game and he only had good things to say, but there’s that pesky little AP Lit grade I need to bring up.”
, that’s enough, Steve. Just
“Contrary to what people might think, Howard didn’t keep anything of yours in the house,” Tony continues. “His mission to find you was always top secret, but he would tell me about it. About how his greatest failure was never having been able to find you. He left it in his will that there would be a trust set aside to continue funding the search for your body, so you could be brought home. Howard wanted to at least give you that last service, so you could be buried in the country you fought so hard to protect.”
Tony’s hands tremble as he reaches up for the arc reactor in his chest. His fingers press against familiar warm metal, and his nails clatter against the casing, the familiar staccato beat a small comfort.
Tony barks a laugh, his gut clenching. “Yeah I really fucking do,” he agrees, and Pepper doesn't even know the half of it.
"Because you're the reason."
Rhodey and Pepper had both ignore him. “Besides, I'll come back for winter break,” Rhodey says. “You'll see me again in just a couple of months. They'll fly by in no time.” He grins widely, looking very proud of himself. “Get it?
“I'm smart and logical and great at everything, with an asshole dad like Spock,” Tony says quietly, ignoring the way Steve snorts softly. “And you. You're like Kirk. You're reckless and fearless and people are naturally drawn to you because you were a born leader.”
“Only old people like the original series,” Tony retorts.
Steve listens with rapt attention, not interrupting once, but once Tony is done pointing out the different projects, he says with a sorrowful tone, “you hate doing this.”
weren't
“I love you too,” Tony replies, peering up to look back at Steve. Steve’s eyes are so blue in the midmorning sun.
“I wouldn't have known that about you now,” Tony reassures him. “Couldn't even say that about you then.”
Sarah laughs. “Fine, fine, I'll leave you both to it. Holler if you boys need anything,” she says, the smile stretching across her face and crinkling the corners of her pretty blue eyes. “Condoms? Snacks? Let me know,” she chortles as she leaves.
Tony swallows heavily.
,” and drives him home. He doesn't need be taken care of, not really, but he's grateful all the same.
“Hey honeybun,” Tony calls out as he lifts the lid of the box. “Please come help me with my bracelet—
“Oh?” Steve says with a raised brow. “What do you have going on that night?”
real Steve, how are you here? How did you even get into my house?”
Steve ignores him and adds a third finger, thrusting them slowly in and out of Tony as his other hand supports Tony’s back. He dips his head further to lave his tongue around one of Tony’s nipples, adding a hint of teeth as he licks the little bud to hardness before doing the same to the other side. Tony feels overwhelmed on sensation as he’s torn between rocking back on Steve’s fingers in his ass and Steve’s tongue on his chest. He reaches down to stroke his neglected cock, the touch taking a little bit of the edge off but he gasps when Steve’s fingers graze against the spot inside of him that starbursts his vision white. Everything is too much and not quite enough.
Tony spends all his time building one armor after the next. He pulls up the schematics for the Mark L and he almost cries the first time he sees her again. He reuses that same nanotech and builds armor after armor, trying to get it just right. Soon he has twenty nine new suits. None of them are right. He starts over again.
Tony inexplicably wants to cry. No one has ever really cared enough to ask what he's working on before. Everyone always assumes it’s Important Classified SI Business, leave Tony to it, it's going to take a while, he’s going to hole up in his lab doing who knows what.
But it also means Steve will be there.
Tony jolts. He almost wants to shy away, but his hips buck up of their own accord when Steve licks him again. Steve flattens his tongue to swipe a broad stripe against him before switching to smaller little licks that leave Tony a boneless heap melting into the chair.
He should’ve done more. He should’ve protected them. He should’ve saved them. He should’ve saved Peter.
“Definitely bad porno,” Tony decides.
“Well then,” Tony says. “Guess I'm leading.”
“Okay,” Steve says, not making any move to leave the kitchen.
They’re staring at each other in a long stretch of silence while the monitors and machines beep and hiss around them when Bruce walks in.
And Tony knows, the memory washing over him in a cold wave. Steve must notice because he puts a hand over Sarah's but she continues.
The flurries pick up speed outside, and the snow piles up higher and higher through the day. They spend the first afternoon lounging in the common room with their friends, hot cocoa in hand and board games spread out on the rug by the fire.
That night feels like a lifetime ago, and Tony feels numb now as he rips the newsprint to shreds. It doesn’t make him feel any better for having destroyed it. Tony rubs his hand over his chest and he can feel the emptiness echoing as though everything's been torn out of him and all he has left is the familiar agony of heartbreak.
It's so very different from the Stark mansion even after the huge house was filled with cheer from his friends. The Rogers house isn't oppressively large and empty, bright where it's cold and drafty, and not inhabited by ghosts that won’t leave. It's cozy and warm and filled with love, and Tony is so grateful to be invited to be there.
Tony had never expected Steve to say any of these things to him, had never expected Steve to even
“I wanna suck you off,” Tony murmurs where he’s panting against Steve’s cheek. He can feel the shivering response before Steve tips his head back against the chair with a loud groan. “Let me, let me, let me,” Tony begs, his mouth feeling swollen ripe.
Steve’s lips curve up into a slow smirk that makes Tony’s mouth run dry. He shifts on the chaise, and has to bite back a soft gasp to see Steve staring back just as intently. His blue eyes are dark with purpose as he moves through the water quickly, his muscles bunching and shifting underneath sun-alchemized skin as his prowl turns predatory. Tony is reminded of a lion stalking down its prey, all coiled power and deep intensity, golden and huge.
“Clint, I’ve got a plan –“
Steve didn’t answer because Nat was rubbing her hands and each time she did that, he felt a little more choked up because
“You…yah new around here, boy?”
The voice was strained, screaming, desperate and hurting. Steve’s soldier persona tells him to be wary:
“Did you say you were going to set fire to my –“
It was as if these days his mind and body were detached into two completely separate things. There was always a sort of inkling of scorn berating him for not being there for the funeral of his lover and yet he couldn’t understand that there was a sense of innate emptiness that had curled its way into his heart, digging so deep within that he would wake up every night shrieking and clawing at his chest, trying to get that hollow itch out of his possessed body. Other days, he would reminisce back to the time at the shed when he had buried his cock deep into his lover and made love to him until the sun came up. Those days he woke up screaming his lungs out whilst he came into his bedsheets, tears and sweat running down his taut aching body and pooling into the ridges of his wounds. He was a mess. A nerve – like Bruce once said – exposed, defective, insane for his craving of Tony. For Tony to be warm and breathing and nuzzled up next to him again.
All the while, a broken sob and gut-wrenching scream shook the sky.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony. Dead.
They have been wasting time. Steve straightened his shoulder and spoke sternly. He didn’t mean to sound harsh or patronizing, but if it meant saving the team and even so, saving the world, he would take patronizing any day.
Tony tilting his head to the side to look at Steve one last time as a teardrop slipped its way done the slope of his olive nose.
He was hoping to find a motel that he could at least afford – not too shabby, maybe with a few local grocers here and there but he wasn’t particularly fussed. He lived in worse conditions before.
Or that’s what Steve heard since he didn’t go when they lowered his casket down into the earth.
Turning to walk back out the door, he couldn’t fathom as to who she was or why she said such things. He might not have spider senses like Peter that Tony liked to talk about. But he couldn’t ignore the strange coiling in the pit of his belly as he settled back on his motorbike and rode off North.
Steve felt a small tug on the corner of his lips.
He probably needed to move out.
Didn’t fail to snap the last string of all logic and reason from his mind, of which Steve had never experienced such loss of control, as he witnessed the smooth glide of metal that pierced the armour, imagining Tony’s body, limp with unbearable pain.
“The wine glass,” Tony hisses.
He turns around.
you for sex, used you for your skill and expertise, when in reality, I fucking broke my own heart at the same time I broke yours. You didn’t just lose me; I lost you too.”
Tony’s smile shows a hint of teeth too sharp to remain genuine. “A guy
The elevator doors open, and Tony steps out, and at first, Steve doesn’t hear him, not until his boots come clacking closer to him. Finally, Steve turns, and the cagey expression fades, before replaced with one more irritated.
“Technically, Stark Manor isn’t in the city, and I’m an engineer by trade, so I resent that.”
“Don’t worry about it,” Tony says, sternly. “But to answer your question, Abraham is a gifted, intelligent man; his intellect is quite incomparable, but there are certain areas where his intellect can be compared, and it is me who eclipses him. So, he came to me, and I asked my sire, who absolutely did not want me to come, but my bearer is quite confident that I might find an officer or two here that might be willing to bond with me.”
Peter just looks at him, like he’s terrified of what Tony’s about to say next.
“I hate them, Hitler, the Reich, the Nazis, all of them,” Tony says, so venomously, so hatefully that it surprises him. “But that doesn’t that we’re ready for this kind of power either. You didn’t see it, Colonel Fury. You didn’t see what it did. It was not made for us, and frankly, I object on a purely selfish basis. If this gem is going somewhere, it’s going back to Dvārakā, where it belongs. It doesn’t belong anywhere else. Too much has been taken from us. The Nazis took a symbol that meant
himself on you. He is twice the offender. You were right to take justice against him. But now, we will have to dispose of the body. If the rest of my people were to find out about what happened in this room, they would doubt you; they would consider you to be the equal sinner in all of this. I would spare you that.”
“Oh, I’m sorry, am I annoying you with all my worrying?” Tony demands, his voice rising high and thin. “Because of your
“How many times do I have to tell you?” Tony demands. “I don’t know anything, okay? And I’m not trying to protect Rogers or anything. I don’t have any loyalty to him at all. He’s brought me only trouble.”
“This is… this is all your fault. I wouldn’t be… I wouldn’t be in this mess if it weren’t for you,” he says, his voice turning hateful, venomous, a tone that he never thought he’d ever take with Steve.
Tony folds his hands in his lap and resists the urge to stare elsewhere.
Steve sighs. “Tony, Tony, I’m sorry.”
to understand that, because you are a chorus girl.”
Grant keeps going, keeps thrusting; in fact, the movements of his hips become harsher, rougher, and the boy whines low in his throat, louder and louder.
“There’s a redhead that’s been following me.”
on people, Steve. I know, I know I grew up in that life, Steve. I grew up in the world where people have affairs, they fuck other people who aren’t their husbands or their wives, and everyone’s okay with the arrangement. Everyone gets by, because they’re all on the same side with the arrangement. And I could’ve been okay with it, Steve. I really could’ve been okay with it, if you wanted her.”
Maushmi’s nails dig into his shoulders. “Tony, please, just trust me for once. You'll feel better as soon as you sleep!”
A commotion builds outside, distracting them, drawing their attention.
At the base of the box, there’s a photo, with a certain layer of dust.
“You know, he’s going to need therapy,” Sam points out.
“Yes,” Tony hisses, pumping his fist in the air.
“You wouldn’t have done that?”
“So, this guy has a picture of us. Is that why you came back, because-”
“What do you mean?”
“I’m sorry?”
“He killed my friend,” Steve repeats, his voice sharpening at the edges. “Phil. He killed my friend, Phil; did you know that? Do you have any idea how many people he’s killed over the short course of his career?”
a failure. Not you; somehow, the alphas never get stuck with the blame.”
James closes his eyes for a moment, as if he wants to linger in this moment, linger in the weight of their small bodies in his arms, and he knows that look, that feeling, because he’s done it half a thousand times before.
“There he is,” he says, quietly, his throat flexing. “That’s him. Obadiah. Obie, from the song.”
James sighs. “I wasn’t spying on you. It’d been years since I saw you, Tony, and I wasn’t sure what circumstances were your current circumstances. I just wanted to make sure that everything was okay in your life before I threw myself into the mix.” He worries his teeth on his lower lip. “You had kids, that was the first thing that I saw.”
Tony absentmindedly pokes at Steve’s bicep. “When did you get these muscles?”
“Ready?” Tony says, eyes over-bright.
“She did, actually,” Steve says, coldly, his eyes turning flinty. “She’s the one that gave me the pictures; she’s the one who was following your friend. She told me that you met him at a park that day, and apparently, you looked very cosy.”
“I think there are others much more capable and much more honest than me,” Steve says, firmly, “because if I go, I won’t come back, not like this, Natasha. If I go, I will find Tony and I will stay with him and I won’t let him go, and I don’t think that’ll end the way you want it to.”
“How long have you been cuckolding me with the Winter Soldier?”
Peter walks her down the aisle, and the collective
He curls his hand around the shield pendant, wanting some reassurance, but his hand closes around nothing, empty space.
He picks up his robe, wraps his body inside it, as though it can protect him when it had just failed several minutes ago.
“Herr Stark, this is the second time I have seen you looking very foolish.”
Tony stares at him.
He pulls off Tony’s cock with a wet sound.
Steve pulls back with a scowl. “You know, that isn’t helping moving this night along,” he says, darkly.
a question?” she asks, suddenly.
The armour creaks, and Steve determinedly doesn’t think about how it feels like he’s holding Tony’s coffin.
“But he was still your brother. You loved him.”
“Us too,” Tony says, dryly.
“Take it easy. I’m looking for your father.”
“Peter, Maushmi?”
She reaches for him, but Tony dodges her, cracking his jaw. Jarvis is there, thankfully, still having his back even in this moment, and Tony reaches for the box that he’d dropped on the coffee table.
“It wasn’t me, but it was SHIELD, and they were working fine until you got your hands on it,” Steve grumbles.
? Can you believe that?”
The street is absolutely deserted.
“Sir, sir, please, get back in your car,” he says, importantly, as if that bright yellow sign in his hand gives him some measure of significance in this world.
“I was, wasn’t I?”
Tony curls a hand around the nape of Steve’s neck, sidling closer to him, as he nudges his nose against Steve’s cheekbone.
“You’re also full of yourself,” James drawls.
“The three of us, you, me, James, in a relationship,” Tony explains.
Steve nods, vehemently. “It has Nazis and underground cities and-”
Sighing, Steve flung his shield to attach to his back. He felt defeated again - it was a normal mood these days. He felt the soft touch of Natasha’s hand on the warmth of his shoulder and gave a sombre nod in response.
to know at least once in his lifetime, if this is the only life he gets.
Why was everyone telling him that? Can’t he just hold Tony in silence.
“What are you doing?!”, Tony shouted in his face.
“Steve –“
Tony’s body tossed over to one side like some mechanic junk.
“Fuck – didn’t know I sought refuge from a
“Just wanted to know”
“That’s it?”
It didn’t matter if he achieved it. He just needed to die trying.
“Guys, over here!”
“Chill, Goldilocks”, his collar was getting too tight around his neck, “lay off the choking, will you? Save it for the bedroom”, Tony muttered.
“Aren’t ya the Captain?”
The door was rattling so hard from the loud banging and he could hear screams echoing throughout the entire hallway.
And there it was again – that tension. The ugly silence that filled only after each time when Tony and Steve had butt heads on yet again another decision.
“Tony! I need you to take one body and chuck him down the – “
“You good, soldier?”
“TELL ME HOW THIS IS POSSIBLE!”
“Yes ma’am”
He didn’t fail to drive him insane when he disobeyed orders for the last time and flew to drive a stake right into the middle of Thanos’ heart.
“Tony”, Steve looked over at Tony, eyes emotionless and void of any emotion, “he’s right.”
He made his way over to the bed, gently placing his shaking form onto the soft white sheets, clutching his chest as he felt the rapid beating of anxiety and nervous shock.
Laughter and giggles filled the early morning breeze like the dance of sing-song melodies ringing through the cobbled plaza. The sun was just starting to peep through the cobalt blue murky swamp of clouds that huddled over the town. The weather seemed to have been quite temperamental these days, indecisive of whether it should brighten up the world with its warmth or remain cold and distant in the middle of the year. With the floral scent of roses and chrysanthemum drifting over garden beds of millions of multi-coloured tulips rearing their heads to the sky, it was almost a beautiful day – if not for Tony feeling like utter shit, running on less than two hours of sleep and a bad drinking habit he couldn’t seem to shake off.
Shower towels?
It was testing Steve’s patience really, because if he wasn’t allowed to answer the calls from whom it must be either a roulette possibility of Natasha or Fury (he almost missed that motherfucker after they ashed him away), he damn well wanted to chuck it into the blur of bushes rushing by on either side of him as he took his trip to god-knows-where on his motorbike.
Not before long he would twist the handles of his vehicle, veering a turn into a local station. Steve kicked his motorbike into place and plugged it to quench the thirst of a dehydrated engine.
His uniform?
“Did you owe them money or something?”
So he settled for the in-between; lukewarm and modest like the small tug of a smile.
Steve fumbled with the hem of his white shirt.
Steve shut his eyes tight. No. He did not want to think about how it would look.
And he didn't meant it. But the way it sounded, the memories tagging along – it was all too much for him that he went into a state of catatonia.
Tony’s coffee cup. Silk bedsheets of Tony. Tony’s waft of cologne each time he opens their old wardrobe. His teammates that only served to exist to mirror the tragedy that they lost Tony. Tony’s workshop when he decided to finally pick up some drawing pencils and canvases he accidentally left there years ago, buried in a cardboard box in the corner that he thought maybe Tony never managed to abandon.
And then Steve was heaving again, clutching his cold body as he sobbed quietly into his ash-brown hair, kissing his forehead, cheek, any skin that he could touch to warm him up. Natasha buried her face in Steve’s neck, clutching them both, before hitching Steve by his armpits, softly pulling him away from the one dear thing he couldn’t live without.
What the actual fuck was going on?
They buried him a week later.
“Well? Are you Captain America?”
“Off you go now, boy”
His eyes twinkled like the stars of this other new-wordly constellation - glistening, like he seen all the tears and pain and was buried underneath it all - rotting like a corpse would when they deterioriate under flesh-eating worms on this barren wasteland.
It was Natasha. Natasha and her soft voice and softer heart. She stepped forward into the sliver of light that filtered through the blinds of the dusty motel window, rubbing her hands to salvage some warmth from the fiction.
“I… I left all my stuff back at the motel. Shouldn’t you…”
Steve thought he saw Tony clench his fists, turning to face Clint directly.
“Hit up one of the chicks”
Tony was here. Breathing. Living. Swearing. Calling him honeyboo.
Rushing, he threw himself against the wall, willing himself to stay completely still as he turned the doorknob in one swift moment before tactfully maneuvering the body in front of him as he shut the door. Pinning the figure down by the wall, he tore down the leather hood soaked wet from the rain that must’ve come down during the night.
He was rummaging around in his pockets, tugging out a few stray cigarettes and a lighter.
There was a sense of urgency in Romanoff’s voice. She wasn’t one to break, ever, from the time he got to know her but she did now.
Natasha’s voice pulled him out of his catatonic state a bit.
She chuckled, lightly patting his forearm.
She gave a light chuckle, green eyes brightening up.
Her voice croaked in broken syllables, so Steve had to patiently wait and string the sentences together to fully understand her. Her lip wobbled, like she required every push of her strength to speak, looking as though she might collapse at any moment.
Behaviorally, it didn’t seem to phase the blonde man.
“If I could just get maybe a clear shot to attach this detonator on him, maybe we could distract him and then ambush-“
Tony going limp.
Steve stood up in a panic, wide eyes like a couple of saucer plates as he grabbed Tony by the collar. His super soldier defense instinct never really left him. The banging on the door rose to a crescendo, and the muffled husky voices of men hushed outside the door. Not only a second later, the door burst open and two men in dirty corduroy jackets rushed in, hands bare and ready for a kill.
"Do you trust me?"
A man with a scraggly beard adorned with few rotting yellow teeth quirked his lips into an odd smile. The man picked at his tattered red cap with his dirt-crusted nails, rolling a paper cigarette in another.
“Tony, there is no use to just attack blindly – “
Gripping the leather brown belt, he strapped down his shield with the last remaining muster of strength and all rage he had in his fear-rattled body and headed straight for his one and only mission.
“- but if you let me set fire to your room, I will gladly pay you in –“
“LET ME THE FUCK IN”
There was a knotted frown etched onto Steve’s face as he worried his bottom lip. Tony tried not to pay attention to that.
"I do."
“Uh yeah… I guess so”, Steve narrowed his eyes, “why?”
Being right and being in love. In a kinder world, he would have both in his hands. In this world, he would be stuck in between the two, never quite catching the other and so long as he ran towards one, the other would collapse in and of itself, making him stripped bare and left with nothing in the end.
“I like that,” Tony moans. “I
Tony watches Steve drive off down towards the gate, the gate opening at his presence unaided, and Tony raises a hesitant hand in goodbye, wondering if this is the last time he’ll see Steve, whether he might just stay with his mistress this time, never bothering to return to his old and boring husband, his kids that have outlived their novelty.
Tony wonders if Steve will ever tell SHIELD that he knows the Winter Soldier and that he and his husband are planning on having a threesome with the Winter Soldier – somehow, he thinks that a confession like that gets a bag placed over his husband’s head and his immediate transport to some off-the-books, underground prison where they can beat him black and blue and attack him with a cattle prod all in the name of American patriotism.
“Sir,” Tony whines, making a soft, desperate noise at the back of his throat. “I don’t want to wait anymore. I’m stretched, I’m good for it, I know I am.”
“Not yet, baby,” Tony muses, brushing his mouth over her hair and then, Peter’s. “We got to get out of here, first.”
,” she says, dramatically.
After the babies, there are children clamouring for Steve’s autographs.
Steve shrugs. “Maybe I wanted to impress you,” he points out.
“I have the same problem,” Tony tells him, after a moment’s pause.
Phillips looks like he wants to keep protesting.
“You won’t let me down, will you?” he asks, quietly, leaning in close so that he can press his brow against Steve’s. “I mean, a whole lot might depend on it.”
Oh, how could Tony have ever thought that anything would end between them? How could he have ever thought that Steve had stopped loving him, wanting him?
“Okay, everything that you just said is total
The knife-edge of suspicion digs its way like some dark, awful parasite that wants to eat him whole.
“Don’t worry about that. I’m perfectly capable of handling anything they throw at me,” Tony tells him, softly. “Remember, I’m Tony Stark. It’s not that easy to touch me.”
“Thanks for that,” Steve mutters.
God, it takes the air right out of his lungs and makes it hard to breathe.
Toni climbs off Rhodey’s lap, and the only
Tony knees him hard in the stomach; the man grunts, and Tony scrambles away, scrambles backward. The man’s hand closes around Tony’s ankle, hauling him back. Tony flips back onto his back, and the knives come down again.
“I am searching for qualities beyond the physical.”
He pauses, and Tony can’t help but think what a graduation ceremony for an academy of assassin would be.
“That wasn’t the dream,” he says, dully, his throat flexing. “That wasn’t the dream I had. It wasn’t about Pepper, not really. It was… I saw her body bag in the hall.”
Rhodey is Tony’s best man, and Pepper and Happy are his groomspeople. There’s a gaping hole where he might have asked Peter, but he doesn’t allow himself to linger on that thought.
Tony pours himself a glass of port from the decanter sitting on the table. “I definitely would. There are some things you can recapture in this life, but that isn’t one of them.”
He stalks back over, and Steve’s there, taking the kids into his arms as well, and Tony’s loathed to lose their warmth, but he lets them go, nonetheless. Steve holds them tight too, holds them like he couldn’t breathe until he was holding them in his arms, and Tony knows what that feels like, knows what it feels like to miss that part of himself.
The other nail is, of course, the fact that Steve and Tony are seemingly incapable of communicating with each other.
“Why, thank you,” Tony says, dryly, and picks Peter right off Steve’s shoulders, throwing him over his.
“You were
or how much I want you to come all over my face or my filthy slut hole because that’s the only way I could ever come, with you inside me, that was all about you wanting to feel more like a man, because you think you’re losing your grip on me, handsome. That doesn’t sound like a
Tony smiles despite himself.
“Steve,” Tony replies, with the faintest hint of a smile. “That was quite a performance.”
James crosses the space between him and Steve and cups his jaw in his broad hands, kissing him slow and sweet on the mouth. When he pulls back, Steve just stares at him, bug-eyed and surprised, and then, he makes a soft, high noise at the back of his throat, sinking into a chair at the breakfast table.
Peter doesn’t say anything; he just throws his thin little arms around Tony’s shoulders, hugging him close.
Dr. Zola wipes the spit off his face with a look of disdain, and with a surprising amount of strength in his small hand, he punches Tony in the gut, causing him to grunt and double over, the only thing keeping him on his feet being the Nazis holding onto him.
“Fine, I’m sickly.”
That look is like a blow to Tony’s face, as he realises what those dreams were about, and the pained, hopeful look mirrored on Steve’s face has the added effect of twisting a knife in his gut and pulling his insides out.
“Ask me out,” he says, suddenly.
“So, what, you’re just designating me as the candygram while you two go and do the real crimefighting?” Tony snorts. “Fuck that. They’re
“He called you
“Please,” Maushmi begs, “can you help him?”
“And you remember what we did that night?” Steve asks, pointedly. “With my phone?”
The sudden urge to forget his plan, to lunge across this space and strangle the bastard until he dies in Steve’s arms, rears its ugly head, but somehow, he manages to stifle it.
Steve looks uncertain, reluctant, and he squeezes his shoulder. “Okay, you’re sure?” he confirms.
“I reversed the connection,” Tony tells him. “I made it so that the bugs showed SHIELD’s feeds, not the other way around.”
The small man clucks his tongue. “The same thing your friend Captain Rogers wanted. Surely, he told you there would be other interested parties.”
!” Peter shouts. “
“Steve!” Tony shouts, standing in the entrance hall
close to my heart,” Tony teases, even as he feels wrung out on the inside.
Toni runs her tongue under her teeth. “Well, it means… we would be family, all four of us, more than just the three of us getting married; it would mean that you would be their son too. When you were born, there was this certificate that we had to fill out, your father and I, and I had to put it down that I’m your mother, and that Ty, your father was your father, and we had to file it with the government, which means that legally, completely, more than just the fact that I had you in my belly, you are mine. If Steve and Bucky adopted you, that would mean that you would legally be theirs too.” She pauses. “Do you understand what I’m saying?”
Steve scowls absolute murder. “You don’t know what the fuck you’re talking about, pal.”
It’s not the same, but it sure as hell isn’t less.
He closes his eyes and surprisingly, even with the Adderall, he falls asleep quite quickly.
And then, he lunges for Thanos, grapples with the gauntlet for a good sixty seconds, as Thanos’ fist beats down on him from above, until finally the Titan’s strength is too much, and Thanos manages to bat him away like he’s nothing more than an annoying insect.
Picking up his duffel bag, he heaved his way out of the tower – but not before turning around on his heels and grasping a grey tie for keepsake.
Even the wall was vibrating and Steve thought maybe the door would come unhinge in no time.
So, it was over. They won. He should know this because right after whatever happened, he was met with the weary sighs of his team, pain, grief, and yet a hint of relief and hope that maybe this would be the last war ever.
The stubborn, headstrong persona he was used to was watered down to something more quiet, sad. Those ocean blue eyes glimmered a dark navy, carrying that familiarity - like your favourite old blue coat nuzzled in the back of your closet that smells like coming home.
So, it's been a pretty slow-burn sort of fic but I swear something is going to happen soon! :')
It was his body that reacted first, shooting up from his covers and freezing momentarily, before his mind could really catch up.
Steve dug his boot on the hardened soil, sprinkled with soot. He imagined his body lying there lifeless before him, those callous fingers unmoving - no more of the beautiful way they would dance and tinker with robot parts and screws in the workshop.
The man gave him a shrug, like just a minute ago he wasn’t pissed.
“Better get on with it, Clint. Don’t think Hulk can handle him much longer.”
Steve lay idly by, his body heaving with difficulty breathing and it awfully reminded him of that Brooklyn boy centuries ago. The crumby ground dug into his scratched uniform and the smell of ash and fire burned his throat, nostrils, singed the edges of his gold hair until they were a musky brown. Eyes watering, he winced as he felt a sharp jab in his right leg. A gash opened its gaping wound up at him as the flesh around the edges burnt an ugly black.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony’s tower that he was fucking living in.
He thought of the many differences in Tony. His bright eyes and brighter mind when he talked on and on about his project, his soft slump of his shoulder when he finally came to bed, his muscles and limbs slipping into the warmth of his arms as he thought to himself how he could ever have been the Steve before the war, before HYDRA and the ice and still end up here, a century later, in the crystallized moment and enigmatic ways of life and time. He thought of his hair ruffled in the many shades of brown in the morning back when it was still Summer and his honey-brown eyes and olive skin would glow like a flame that would eventually lick and burn it’s way into his heart and mind – a scar that you would run your fingers over and over again, mapping out the tiny etches and crevices and smile because it reminded you of happier days when you felt bold and dared to cup the world into the tiny palms of your hands.
He made it on perfect time as he hit up an old local motel and dumped his belongings onto the rugged floor. The sun was just setting over the horizon as he watched the orange-red beams bleed into each other on the cramped balcony, spilling their glow over the sparse rooftops of homes and shopfronts. Few locals milled about, pulling down the binds or locking their stores as they got ready to rush home for dinner. There were no shouts of play from kids so it must’ve been in the middle of the week. Steve used to come out onto the streets to play ball on a Friday evening anyway. Not that he was any good at it since he would have to catch his breath every few seconds, but it was nice to see Bucky. Sighing, he flopped onto the bed and gazed up at the ceiling crackled with paint.
He watched Nat walk over, scooting over so Nat could gently settle down on the edge of his bed.
He rushed over, trying to pull the stubborn man back to safety but he wrenched his arm away.
He reached for Natasha’s outstretched hand, grasping the leather glove as he heaved his own lead-laden body from the uncomfortable heap of rubble and ash.
Physically, he smirked at the light blush that had already begun to crawl up the side of his neck and cheek – or maybe he was just aroused by the possibility of bashing Tony’s head in.
He shook. Shook until he felt like his bones were rattling and crumbling beneath his very flesh. Shook like he never had before – not even when he came out of the ice.
But perhaps he knew the answer already back in Siberia.
“Steve!”
There were spots of ember flames snaking through the debris, and the sky loomed with the iron tanginess of rotting flesh and blood all mixed together.
Steve should’ve known that Tony was already making his way down the escape route.
Yet, they never failed to swim with a sort of familiarity - of hot mugs of coffee in the early chilled mornings, bedsheets warm and cozy or the soft glow of yellow from dancing in the kitchen on late-night Saturdays or even the shine of the arc reactor that demanded from life something grander, brighter and more magnificent than the ordinary of Steve Rogers.
“Good to…know someone got manners”
Igniting his thrusters, the suit hovered a few seconds before skyrocketing towards the sky.
Steve whose smile shines the brightest in his eyes, his laughter warm, and his affection freeflowing. Tony has never known anyone as tactile as Steve, who's always eager to sling an arm around his shoulders and press a kiss to his lips.
Tony swallows. He feels like an absolute prick when he tells her, “He’s m-my butler. Jarvis.”
the dramatic one?
“The first five pages are a contract I had my lawyers draw up to include all the clauses of our agreement. And the very last page is an NDA. That’s the most important one.”
and stupid
“Pepper gave me the keycode when you didn’t answer her calls,” Steve says, ignoring Tony’s mutters about betrayal. He pushes a brown paper bag into Tony's hands. “And what do you mean you haven’t slept in
Steve glances into the lab and his eyes alight on Tony briefly as he shuts his locker, getting ready to head to his first class. His eyes quickly flick away, expression flattening into something blank and dismissive. Tony scowls, even as he swallows down the uncomfortable feeling of sharp regret he feels every time Steve looks at him like that.
“God, you're so fucking hot when you do that, you fucking smartass,” Tony breathes, finally managing to pull Steve close for a searing kiss. “I fucking hate it,” he says against Steve's lips.
Before Tony can formulate an answer, his butt vibrates and his phone
a nerd. The nerve.
Clint and Bucky sign back and forth with quick fluttering hands, arguing over the proper way to string popcorn together and Sam looks like he's a minute away from knocking their heads together. Natasha watches them with no small amount of amusement curling the edges of her lips as she sneaks handfuls of popcorn, and Bucky still hasn't realized why the bowl is emptying at such a rapid rate while Loki is arranging the other ornaments by color and bickering with Thor. Tony feels warm and comfortable and filled to the brim with contentment.
Tony can’t help but find the faint blush dusting Steve’s cheeks absolutely adorable. “Aww gee, thanks,” Steve says, fidgeting where he stands. “He must be what? A sophomore now? I see he’s still taking those amazing photos. Peter is Ben’s nephew,” he tells Tony. “He’s really talented. He takes pictures for the school paper.”
“My first memory of you,” Tony says one night, “is not of you. Not really.”
“It’s not,” Steve agrees. “But I would’ve still protected my friend. Just like I would’ve protected you if it was you on that end of the battle.”
“Yeah, we did,” Tony sighs. “We could've been
“Wow, I'm so proud of you,” Steve tells him, the corner of his lip is tugged up in a grin, his face barely visible from behind the stack of parcels.
“Flatterer,” Tony mutters, unable to help the smile that tugs at his lips.
“Anything else?” Tony asks, rolling his eyes to cover up the way he’s suddenly much more excited and far more terrified of this whole idea as he adds the ridiculous requests to the document.
Natasha just smiles sadly and shakes her head. “I’m sure you’ll be okay,” she says gently, carding her fingers through his hair. “Take it one day at a time. Steve really likes you. Just keep being yourself. You’ll be fine.”
“And I hate to be so cheesy about this,” Tony continues, “but it feels a lot like everything’s been leading up to this. Our decade as teammates and partners, as friends. And now, as the love of my life. God, I’m so lucky.”
- I started writing the fic last year (around September, a little after
“Well,” Steve begins. “I certainly wouldn’t leave you all alone in the morning. I would take good care of you, wake you up in the morning with kisses all over. ”
Tony laughs but he doesn't quite feel the humor behind it. “If anyone works too hard, it's you Pepper,” he retorts. “You have so much going on with the yearbook, and student council, and Model UN. Pepper, you're actually a superwoman.”
“Loki is mad at me,” Tony says dismissively, pocketing his phone. “He's not going to come help me clean when he's still angry about the brother thing.”
They had fought monsters and titans and the whole world and each other to be together. After everything, how can Tony possibly think there may come a day when Steve will not love him anymore, because of something as trivial as the transient state of a physical body?
Tony laughs, and Steve is gratified to see some of the tension easing from his shoulders and mirth returning to his bright eyes. “Silver fox
Steve drops his wrist as though he’s been shocked by lightning and he looks like
Later, Rhodey finds Tony on the football field underneath the bleachers. He takes one look at him and doesn't say anything, simply crawls down to sit next to him on the damp grass. He takes Tony in his arms as he shakes, gulping wet sobs and streaming snot. Tony cries all the tears he hadn’t been able to shed at his mother's funeral. He cries for his mom.
Then three.
“I’ll hold you to it,” Pepper replies drily. “You're going to have to remember your own stuff this year. I have to juggle Student Council, Yearbook, Model UN. Tony—”
“The two of you were sitting together outside Principal Fury’s office, awaiting your fates, after the fight with that Osborn kid and his little gang. I walked in there to have the parent talk with him and I met your—uncle?”
Everyday, he sits high in the bleachers overlooking the field with a hot coffee cupped in his hands and the scarf he stole from Steve wrapped snug around his neck. He settles down to watch the drills and practice games Coach Coulson makes the team play as the night settles early around them, his breath pluming in white smoke that curls from his mouth.
“I think you're wrong,” Jarvis says mildly. “I am entirely of the belief that Steve has great affection for you. I'm most certain he loves you.”
“You keep saying that,” Steve grumbles, but he catches Tony’s hand in one of his own to press a kiss to his palm. His other arm wraps around Tony’s waist and holds him tight against Steve’s chest. “We made a mess of ourselves, didn't we?”
Tony spent a lot of dark nights in space with the universe crushing down on him while he drowned amongst the stars thinking about that day. Would he have regretted killing Barnes? At first, he had thought he wouldn’t, because he had thought it would’ve been justified vengeance for his parents. But the more time he spent with Nebula, the more his feelings on the matter shifted.
“I’ve got you, sweetheart,” Steve murmurs, dipping his head to mouth along the column of Tony’s throat, his beard tickling the sensitive skin of Tony’s neck. He sucks gently at his collarbone, tongue sweeping along the numbers Tony has inked there, commemorating all the places where he’d been reborn before kissing the scars he finds at the shoulder joint as skin gives way to body warmed alloy.
The kit doesn't have enough to build beyond the arm, but he figures it out on his own. He has to scavenge parts from his father’s workshop to make the little robot functional but he is careful to only take the pieces and wires he needs from the recycling bin, making sure not to disturb any of his dad’s work.
Tony sees Peggy dancing with someone from the corner of his eye and ignores the sour taste that bubbles up behind his throat. He turns slightly so he no longer sees her and reaches up to pull Steve closer, letting the coconut ocean smell wash over him.
One day soon after camp ends, Janet skypes to tell him she met Hank Pym, and Tony knows he'll never have her.
Tony trembles and shakes in Jarvis's arms. He has it wrong. He has it all wrong. They're just silly drawings, meaningless and certainly not evidence that Steve ever gave a shit about him.
but the sound is on mute. He sits up as he yawns, tugging at Steve’s hand. His brain feeling like it's drowning in molasses and he struggles to stay awake. “There’s no way I’m making it back uptown tonight. Let’s go to bed.”
James leans forward, his hands in his lap. “What would you like to call me?” he asks in a soft, patient way.
, even when she fucking taunted me with what was going on between the two of you, even when she fucking introduced herself to our kids,
“You will have to be prepared for that eventuality. Polyamory is a difficult bone to swallow for a lot of people,” Eshe warns, gently. “It’s… it goes against preconceived notions of what relationships look like, and a lot of people take time to come to terms with whether they’re okay with such a relationship, whether they’re prepared to split their feelings and their responsibilities like that, whether they’re capable of the kind of extensive communication these relationships require. James might be one of those people that baulks at the idea of three men being in a relationship. It might take him time, and it isn’t helped by the fact that he doesn’t remember much from his life before HYDRA took him. He has those things to sort out, the abuse, the torture, the brainwashing, the conditioning, the things they forced him into. Has he started seeing someone to talk these things out?”
“Okay, come on,” Tony says, urgently, beckoning him so that they can sneak around the corner towards the garage.
“It is possible, Tony,” Wanda says, kindly. “Therapists, counsellors, they are not bad words, not dirty words.”
“Stop thanking me.” Wanda rolls her eyes. She flings a soft smile at the children, who have managed to get distracted by Dora again. “They remind me of Pietro and me. To be a twin is a special thing,” she murmurs, her eyes glazing over.
“I just…” he sighs. “I don’t feel... ready to sleep yet. Please, do I have to?”
Tony shrugs, mouth pinched into a taut line. “I have a pretty shitty view of myself,” he says, honestly. “It wasn’t just… I mean, my father contributed to that. An abusive ex contributed to that, and I was like that, I had that bad view of myself, even when I met Steve. It wasn’t something that just sort of happened in the last few years or anything. So, I imagine, if Steve had told me about Bucky, I probably would have reacted badly.”
“Oh fuck off, prince charming!”
He winced, rolling his shoulder to hopefully ease the pain without having the luxury to rub it with his palm.
(See the end of the chapter for
And then he trailed off past the station back to his truck, rolling and unrolling the cigarette papers like he just did things for fun.
Tony’s voice muffled with pain as Thanos’ palm clamped over his mouth – those lips that he spent kissing the whole of yesterday night – while he dug the shard deep into his ribcage.
“Wouldn’t they throw us out?” Steve points out, a smile playing along his lips.
And then, Steve had growled, a fearsome, terrifying thing, and he’d punched the frat boy in the face, and then, his friends jumped Steve, and then, Steve’s friend, Sam, was getting involved, and suddenly, before he even knew what he was doing, Tony was breaking a beer bottle on the edge of the bar counter and jumping into the fray.
Tony’s brow furrows. “Why are you asking?”
“Pepper was my friend. Natasha’s one of my
But the Nazis are somehow moving faster and gaining on them.
“Enough to get you back to the States. Where are his things?”
“Tony, I was honestly just trying to apologise,” Steve insists.
“There wasn’t,” Tony insists.
“–in the worst break-up ever, the media describing the resulting fallout as
“What the hell, Tony?” he asks, the words coming out as a yelp, when Tony’s fingers encircle the width of his cock.
go for each other’s throats, and it’s easy as breathing, and they both know that it’s unhealthy, but more often than not, when they get like this, when they get really fucking into it, they end up in bed together, and it’s angry sex with biting and clawing and there are bruises on both of them the next day, but it’s a system that works.
“You saved my life,” Steve points out.
“You fucking… did you think I’d be okay with it?” he demands. “Did you think I’d just smile and bear it, like the poor, put-upon house husband, you fucking prick? Did you think I’d just be
Rumlow backhands him so hard that he tastes blood and his head rings. Tony blinks, and in the distance, he hears a shout coming from Steve.
“For fuck’s sake, Steve!” Tony says, her mouth pulled back in a snarl, jumping out of the bed and glaring down at him. “What the fuck is your problem?”
He writes Steve a note.
“If it makes you feel better, I’m still not welcome here,” Tony drawls.
That’s how James comes, and he pulls off just in time to have streaks of come hit his cheek, his nose, his lips. Tony pauses, and the come sliding down his cheek in a filthy line. Some of it, he can taste on his tongue, and James tastes exactly how Tony remembers from that one blissfully hot night they shared together, tasting of salt, warm and full, and he fastens his mouth around James’ cock to catch the last few dregs of his orgasm, as James pulses in his mouth, thick and slow.
Tony colours in response, but he doesn’t hide his face like he might have before; he stares his alpha down, bravely.
“Yeah,” he says, derisively. “And then, you were seventeen. Wow, big age difference.”
“Besides, the kids think it looks like intestines, so, you know, dinner should be fun.”
The world would forgive him for it.
It starts with a dream.
“I do recall saying that, yes.”
Jarvis closes the door.
“I was quiet,” he finishes, lamely. “And I was a genius. So… I knew a hundred times what people my own age knew, and then, I was skipping through grades at warp speed. Oh, and I was in boarding school, and my cohort didn’t like the fact that I was smarter than them. So, by fourteen, I was in college-”
“Darling, it’s two in the morning, you’ve only just come home right now, and the first thing you said to me was whether I thought it was a really good idea to be drinking a single glass of wine in the dark,” Tony drawls. “Look who’s calling the kettle black over here.”
“So, tell me
Steve is a widower.
“You’ve never helped me,” Tony says, savagely.
“Shut up,” Tony mutters. “Anyway, the next morning, I woke up, the bed was cold, like you hadn’t been in it for hours, and there was a note:
. You broke my heart. That is all I know. You broke my heart, and you gave my father all he needed to break it further, and you have the nerve to come back to my door, after all of these years, after I have attempted to move on from the raging whirlwind that is Steve Rogers, get me caught up in some Nazi plot, destroy the home that I had built for myself, and drag me into all of this, and then, after we’ve fucked as a way of me putting you away for
you in that fucking apartment, and when you came out, you were smiling, you were touching him, and I know you,” he says, savagely, showing the pearly-white shine of his teeth. “I know you, Tony, I know how you look when you’re trying to fool someone, pretending to flirt with them so they do what you want and give you what you want. You lean in real close, and you flutter your eyelashes, and you chew on your lip a little, and you drag your fingers over their collar. And I also know what you look like when you genuinely care about someone, when you’re interested in what they have to say, when you
Tony shakes his head. “I’m pretty sure that gun was either for me, for him, for both of us, or for James, and I still don’t know which it was,” he says, slowly. “But no, he didn’t. He… he just sort of stopped breathing when James walked in.”
“Daddy,” Maushmi hums, resting her head against his shoulder.
Steve stirs at that, his eyes widening. “The 107
Natasha looks over her shoulder, her eyes narrowed. “Okay, what is it with you and ballet schools?”
“You don’t know me. We’re not fucking friends. And what, you think that just because you work with my husband that gives you any fucking right to do experiments on my fucking marriage?” Tony demands.
It’s a quiet wedding – Steve doesn’t have a lot of friends in this time, and Tony doesn’t really like
Both of them look at him, expectantly.
“I… he refuses to introduce himself,” JARVIS says after a moment.
“Yeah, fuck,” Steve says, equally short of breath.
The first shot gets the Nazi in the throat, and he goes down in a well of blood.
“Let’s go!”
He looks over his shoulder, unlatching the lock on the door that Steve had so responsibly attached when he’d closed the door behind him.
“Okay, okay,” Tony soothes, just as Steve topples both of them onto the couch.
Steve’s throat flexes. He nods to himself, looks away. “Are you sleeping with him?”
“Yeah, the kids were saying,” Sam says, quietly.
that kind of guy,” James says to him, almost amused.
The soldiers look ready to protest; he’s on the smaller side, and leanly made, but he brandishes the poker with easy, unthinking confidence, and he’s never been afraid to use it.
Tony manages to look up, through the half-dark of his lidded eyes. “Yours hits me in all the right places, makes me feel things I’ve never felt before,” he says, lasciviously. “Takes me to heights that I never thought possible.”
Some would have said that she eloped – the gossip magazines actually did say that.
James looks down at his lap. “After I left, I had to get HYDRA off my tail. The guys that followed our antics to Massachusetts followed me; they wanted to get their hands on their asset. I led them away from you, but that doesn’t mean they weren’t interested in getting me back.”
It seems strange to him, that he’s actually considering the nuclear option, when a month ago, he was swearing that Steve could have fucked Natasha Romanoff right in front of him and he wouldn’t have thrown him out of the house.
He doesn’t have any tears left in him though.
,” he says the last word like a taunt.
Steve looks up at him, sharply. “You think I’m lying about this?” he asks, horrified.
, if I’m worrying about you, if I’m worried that they’re going to hurt you too.”
Steve looks up at him, totally miserable. “Tony, honey, I’m so sorry. I really fucked this up, didn’t I?”
He thinks about Steve's drawings and notes. He thinks about what Jarvis said. He thinks about what Natasha has done. He only cries harder.
“Yes, but we are hosting at my house this weekend,” Thor says stubbornly. “And my brother wants to join our party.”
Rhodey is standing next to him, a soft smile on his face as he looks back at Tony. He’s dressed in his sharp Air Force blues, his many medals decorating his chest. He reaches out and smooths down the line of Tony’s jacket, and Tony nearly sobs at seeing Rhodey’s misty eyed expression mirroring his own.
!” his father—
Sometimes he runs up to Steve on the field after practice, and ignoring the ribbing and good natured teasing from Steve's teammates, presses his cold nose against Steve's warm cheek. Steve is usually a furnace after practice, and there's no better way to warm up from the cold than to walk back to the school with Steve's arm draped snug around his shoulders.
“Why not?” Steve says.
He doesn't even realize the animal sound that echoes in the hall had come from his throat until Steve and Peggy turn their heads and their eyes land on him standing at the end of the corridor. Peggy immediately steps away from Steve and murmurs something to him Tony can’t hear, but her eyes are wide.
dangerous and it’s not like he’s going to have to take the subway for an hour and a half to get home because he refuses to let Happy drive him back—“
Tony works until he forgets about his friends’ worries. He doesn’t want to think about Steve at all, because he knows, feels it bone deep that this thing, this fantasy with Steve is ending soon. They’ve been doing this for so long, he sometimes forgets it’s not real, until something sharply reminds him that he’s only on borrowed time. Today, it’s a particular shade of red on the wire he’s tooling into a motherboard that reminds him of Peggy’s lipstick.
“Probably the best one on the list,” Loki says. “I suppose your taste isn’t
Years ago, they could have probably been more than what they are now: distant acquaintances at most, and perfect strangers on the best of days. But that time has long passed. Yet, Steve still sneaks Tony all of these strange looks when he doesn’t think Tony is looking that make the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end.
“Something I might regret later,” Tony intones mockingly. “Are you making choices for me too now?” He knows he’s being petty, but he’s always pushing things when it comes to Steve. He’s always pushing, pushing, pushing, trying to find the weak spot, trying to get Steve to crack. Even now he can’t help himself.
“I've always meant it,” Steve says earnestly. “I've always liked you, Tony.”
“He’s too much,” Tony says. “He even walked me home. Who does that? Granted it was like ten blocks from that section of the park but still, Steve was all ‘it’s getting late. I want to make sure you get home okay,’ like yeah the Upper East Side is
