”Hurts.”
"Parker? Are you talking about the baby you saved during the accident in Oscorp?" Toni nodded. "Oh goodness, that's so sweet of you! I'm so happy for you!"
Nick Fucking Fury was not giving her a break. The bastard sent files on the upcoming team he had formed. There was a meeting today with some of the team at her home. To say she was pissed off would be an understatement.
guess I have a type.”
And finished!!! A happy ending for Steve ❤️
Dad looked smug and Pops rolled his eyes, swatting at him gently. “Alright, how about we go grab some lunch, and grab the last few things on your list from the store?”
Steve leaned in to give him one last kiss before hightailing it to the bathroom.
He flipped the shift up, revealing the plump cheeks Stíofán had known were hidden away and the bright fluffy tail that wagged as he looked his fill. Stíofán’s cock was throbbing as he felt below the tail for the hot, wet entrance he knew would be there. It was tight, virgin tight, but so slippery with slick, and he shoved two fingers in, enjoying the squeeze of the internal walls, as the doe clenched around them. He was big, he knew that, had seen plenty of the other satyrs when they trained and fought. It would be a lot to take. That thought made his cock twitch.
Steve didn’t pay much attention to proceedings after that. He clung to Tony, letting himself be led, and it wasn’t long before he realised they were back in the tower, Tony taking him through to his room and pushing him gently onto the bed.
Tony stared. “You really think so?”
“Are you going to press your luck with me?” Tony asked, voice going low. “Smells like you need it.”
He went for it, mounting Tony hard and deep, the satisfaction running through him. He ducked down so he could speak into Tony’s ear. “I miss having you like this. Remember, when you were big, round with my kids, and I would take you in the woods just. Like. This?” he punctuated the words with thrusts and Tony whined into the bedding making Stíofán grin.
Tony snorted. “Yours is short enough, you little monster. And you hated when Papa gave you a haircut.”
“Yes please. And a cronut.”
The soft, fluffy tail began to move, tickling him beneath his cock like feathers. He groaned at the sensation, making him thrust harder.
“The lines have snapped!” The reporter yelped, clearly taken by surprise. The wind is taking the dirigible up into the air. Oh! There’s one rope still in place!”
Tony glared. “It’s revolting. And now all anyone’s going to be talking about is how Sheriff Rogers’ omega can’t cook for anything and how he should have picked one of the good cooks in the town like Miss Carter!”
“I don’t know!”
away.
Bucky scowled, tossing a handful of mud Stíofán’s way. “I’m going to treat my doe like a queen. And I’m going to get fat on his cooking, you’ll see. All does are good at it and his Buck said so when I asked to make the match.”
“He seems to know a lot about her given they never met,” Mr Rogers said, looking over to where Rhodes was swinging the boy around, making him laugh. “He mentions her fondly often.”
“Perfect,” Tony breathed, his grin wide. “And I mean, since I’m already ahead, why quit now?” And he leaned up and pressed his lips to Steve’s.
How could he kill the manticore, when all it wanted was what he desired most?
He let Steve lead him through the crowd and to the road that would leave to Steve’s house, breathing in the now-familiar sea breeze.
“That’s fucking gold. I’ll use it at your wedding.”
Tony didn’t answer.
Tony huffed. Steve was so unfortunately elbow height. “Well, this looks nasty. We should go talk to the paramedics - get them to clean it out.”
Steve beamed, opening the gate and inviting him in. Tony stepped through, finding a well kept garden and cottage, along with a shed nestled in the corner. It was very pretty, and Tony found himself relaxing at the sight of a herb garden, filled with all the sorts his mother liked to use in her potions.
He was wet through, and tired from trying to walk back, his ankle starting to swell. There was nothing he could do but stay there, hoping the bone-tired feeling might pass and he could try again.
“You don’t need to be embarrassed. Heats happen.”
“Yeah, you like that?” The hands tightened adding more delicious pressure and Stíofán gasped. “You want my mouth?”
Steve shook his head in surprise. “Should you not inform Mr Rhodes of the theft of his possessions?”
“You don’t know that. You could feel fine, but the sickness could be inside you. We must be vigilant.”
Tony hefted himself up onto a barstool. “So far? Prosthetics and pacemakers. I design them.”
Tony snorted. “You didn’t have to. I’ve seen the looks you give some of the bigger families in town.”
“You haven’t even heard what it is yet,” Bucky said gleefully, but Steve was already shaking his head.
Tony chuckled. “Kissing seems simple enough.” He tipped his head expectantly, letting his eyes slip closed in invitation.
He put his hands behind his head and gave Tony a cheeky look. “Come on, show me what you’ve got.”
Steve’s thrusts were going wild now, and Tony knew he’d hit a mark. “Come on, Steve, knot me. I want it, please.” His own pleasure was nearly at its peak and he needed it, just a little more-
He felt lighter than he had in months, and giddy, but he was also still in shock, unable to believe it after so long.
“Come on,” he tilted his hips to hit the spot inside that Tony liked so much. “Come on.”
Tony laughed. “No I suppose it doesn’t. That was an accident.” He relaxed into his chair and took a sip of his coffee. “I found Jemison in an alley one day not long after I took over this place. I’d just formalised the deal with Rhodey to combine our businesses and I was taking out some trash when I heard her.”
He didn’t know what would.
He shoved it into its case before he could think about it any more, swinging it onto his back. He’d just be careful.
Ok, no, it was a lot stranger. But that’s fine. People were in danger. They needed his help, and he was going to provide. And then he guessed he’d give in, and agree to live at the SHIELD compound.
He was...cute. Very cute. The aforementioned blue eyes, blond hair, a slim frame that was shorter than Tony’s own, and a pretty blush covering the sharp cheekbones. He was lovely.
“That. Was. Amazing.” Tony breathed, and Steve smiled hopefully. “You just saved that girl. With a peanut!”
“You think you’re the only one who ever had doubts? I used to worry about it all the time until I met Pepper, and then…” He sighed happily and Tony could practically see the hearts in his eyes.
Tony was returning from the train station where he’d picked up a care package from Ana and Jarvis, along with several letters. It was heavy enough that he knew it carried at least one of his books, and the sweet, sugary smell told him it contained some of Ana’s homemade candy. He breathed in deeply, the scent reminding him of home, and for a moment there was a wave of homesickness.
“Oi, Aengus, quit thinking with your cock and come watch your spawn. They’ll be digging up the wheat next.”
“Take that grin off your face,” Tony said with a glare. “You can be happy when this passes. Until then, you can rub my back and bring me some of that spicy root the other does chew on for the sickness.”
But there had been a moment, just a single moment, when he’d hugged Pepper and then she’d turned and been scooped up by Rhodey, and they’d been so in love it had felt like an actual punch in the gut.
“Course,” the Sheriff followed him out, telling the deputies he’d return shortly, and they stepped onto the porch of the saloon, Tony placing the lamp on the railing with a thud.
“Welcome to Chez Rogers,” Steve announced, and then cringed. “Sorry that was cringe. Um, let me go get a blanket, we can eat out here.”
The man in question wiped tears from his eyes and snorted. “Like hell, I didn’t. Trust Stevie to finally get with his omega and not be able to control himself. What would you have done if the Pastor had come in here? He’d never look at you again without clutching his rosary.” He looked to Tony. “No disrespect meant to you, of course, Mr Rogers.”
Tony’s jaw dropped. “Oh my god, that is not--”
He was just sketching out the metal feathers, when a shadow fell over his table.
“No, no, I’m sorry if I-”
“Uh huh.”
Peadar looked back at him. “It didn’t work this time!”
“Sorry.”
Perhaps he had been a little hasty.
right? And then he outsmarts everyone, and he works harder than anyone else, and not only is he the only one who works out how to reach the flag like he’s Mulan or something, he literally throws himself on a grenade. A LITERAL GRENADE. Sure it was a dud, but he didn’t know that! And he wanted to help other people so much he agreed to an experimental treatment that was more likely to kill him than work. He’s a hero, and that’s before he got the superpower steroids.” Tony was pacing and gesturing wildly by this point but he couldn’t bring himself to care. “And then he wakes up in the future, which not everyone knows but there are a few benefits to being the grandson and son of the guys who funded the searches, and even though it has to be tough, he gets back out there to save the world. Captain America is the best.”
He looked through the stores. Much of the food he had no idea what to do with, but there was a recipe for soup that seemed easy and that told him he could use whatever vegetables he could find and a bone for the stock. There was a bone in the icebox with some meat still attached, and so he boiled it, salting the water diligently. Then he cut up and tossed a fair amount of the vegetables he could find, cooking them until they were soft. When the broth was done, it smelled good, though for some reason it was awfully bland. He poured the soup from the pot into a large serving dish anyway, since he worried adding much more salt would just make it even worse. He was just picking it up to place it on the table when the door swung open, and the sudden movement gave Tony a fright, making him jump.
“What, like a relic gathering dust on a shelf?”
“Helping?”
“Quit it,” She said, giving him a nudge.
“Shit, really? We still have rolls to do for the evening rush. What are we going to do?”
Tony flapped a dismissive hand. “Everyone’s got a few secrets.”
“Steve? It’s me, got time to chat?”
She huffed. “Yes, you do, because I know you, and I factored that in.”
“Alright, now what was so important that you had to rush over here?”
Rhodey shook his head. “It’ll keep. ‘Sides seems to me your buck’s been lying to me about you not eating enough so he damn well owes me something.”
The man in blue’s expression hardened. “I thought your boss wanted him to make weapons. He can’t do that if he’s dead.”
He lowered the shotgun. “Fine.”
“Oh, Mr Rogers,” a familiar voice behind them said, and Tony just about groaned. “I think you dropped something.”
The superhero had popped back up a few months back, joining the Avengers team in a very publicised move. The details were a little hazy, but apparently he was the real McCoy, flash frozen in the 40s and thawed to fight crime. He was a natural leader, spoke out on social justice, and could pack a punch. Tony had to admit, he watched the fight longer than he meant to, fascinated by the way the Captain moved, his tall, strong form still somehow so graceful.
Stíofán paid careful attention to both nipples watching Tony’s reactions with interest. He wished he had more time to get to know them, but it was getting late, he would need to sleep soon, as much as he’d like to stay in this moment forever.
Perhaps Tony would take a walk tomorrow. Go and see this airship for himself.
“No,” Tony managed, moving swiftly from anger to distress. “Stíofán you can’t.”
“It’s no trouble. My husband’s an old softy. There was no way he was letting you leave here without making sure you had somewhere to go.” He smiled, and Tony felt himself return it.
Peter nodded, his face alight with responsibility.  “I can Papa, I can. Can I make Mr Rogers something to make him feel better? I have been practicing my sketches.”
“It’s nothing,” Steve said, fingers circling Tony’s wrist and holding on. “Just got caught in the rush. Some guy caught me with his elbow, and I took a tumble.”
Hodge growled. “I’m getting damn sick of you interfering any time we try to have some fun. You got your omega. What gives you the right to interfere with me finding mine?” He smirked at the basket on Steve’s arm. “Maybe it’s just that you're jealous I can get one of these, while yours seems to have you under his thumb.”
“What?” Steve asked, still clinging to the bike, his face a mix of terror and excitement.
“Come here often?”
“Saw your words when your sleeve rode up. You’re just the same as all the rest of them.”
But it had still taken more than a year and a half and five heats for Peter to come, and Tony wasn't too proud to say that he'd been getting worried.
“Oh yeah? Alright, let’s take a look,” he smiled at Steve. “I’m Sam by the way.”
When they got back from lunch, they dropped off the last few things and did one last tidy.
She shrugged. “Pops is fine. He’s the one curbing all of Dad’s…tendencies.”
“Tony!”
“Alright, alright,” Rhodey laughed. “Guess I’m just trying to get the practice in.” He looked over at Sam who nodded. “We heard back from the adoption agency and they have a kid for us.”
“Shhh, shhhh,” Steve hushed, even as he kissed back fiercely. “You were perfect. Strong and brave just like always. He’s safe, and you're safe, and I’m here. Let me carry the burden for a while.”
! I can’t believe you made me wait to find out what happened after they became trapped by the iceberg.”
“Captain,” Tony corrected with a tone that sounded like he couldn’t care less, but somehow carried such a threat of danger that it made heat burst in Steve’s belly.
“How can I help?”
For all he’d decided to win a bride purely out of lust, that was no longer the case, he could admit that.
Steve slid off the couch and walked over to him, taking his hand. “Tony, I promise, it’s just work.”
“Right,” Tony agreed. “And you performed first aid, and once I was stable, I told you to go and get help. They were closing in, and no one on
Tony shook his head. He tossed the now-nearly-empty bowl to the floor, ignoring the thunk it made and clambered into Steve’s lap, letting him take his weight.
“I ask to pat.”
He flicked through the notes, eyes scanning over the damage being done. He’d have to wait till he was on the ground to really come up with a strategy.
“Come on, up you get.” Tony was pulled to his feet and guided to the couch. Sam brought him some water, and he sipped it slowly, trying to piece together what happened.
“Thanks for not doing it on the couch?”
Dad leaned in. “Do you need me to buy you some more suppressants? I’d hate for you to run out.”
He knocked his shoulder on the doorframe in his rush to try and make it to the car, hoping to get a second chance at maybe striking up a conversation and getting his number, but the car pulled away before he reached it and he sighed. He was never going to get to sleep with sexy Picasso at this rate.
“I want a story,” Peter said, as Tony lifted him onto his hip.
His phone buzzed in his pocket and he pulled it out, unsurprised to see a message from Sam.
Tony’s jaw dropped. “Oh we don’t have to - horses cost a lot. I’m sure I can learn on Daisy.”
His mother was known for her magic chemistry, and the whole village appreciated her apothecary. But Tony… well Tony was different. He had no real talent at potions, fortune-telling or communicating with loved ones who had passed on. Instead, he worked with machines.
“It looks like some big grown-up omega lives here,” Pops said, looking around exaggeratedly. “That can’t be right, what happened to the little pup who wanted to sell all her stuff and go live in the woods?”
Tony straightened, defiance radiating off him. “It’s not my fault. Your deputy asked to see, and I could hardly refuse.”
Sam snorted. “And Steve?”
“Again!”
“Uh huh.”
So no, he wouldn’t be fooled. He’d fight as he needed, and he’d take the money on offer, add it to his pot. He wasn’t the kind to have his head turned by some faun. He had a plan, and he was sticking to it.
“Well everyone knows a sire will lie about their kid, everyone’s trying to show off.” Stíofán picked up the spade to keep mixing. “Tony couldn’t cook at all when he got here. Ma had to teach him and I still do a lot of it when he’s at the forge.”
“You’ll never get a date like that, son,” John said, and Steve’s head whipped around to look at him.
Bucky looked disappointed. “Damn. I was sick of eating mush for all my meals.” Then he perked up. “He’s still beautiful though. So I guess that’s something.”
“No, I need-- Steve? Please? I can’t, my head’s so loud, and I need to stop thinking, just for a minute.” Tony kissed him again, and Steve let him, thumbs rubbing circles around his hipbones.
Tony rested his head against the wall as he waited outside Mr Roger’s room.
“Not everyone does, history’s biased against women, and women of colour especially. But she was rad as hell.” He ran a hand down the cat’s back and she trilled. “Now, can I help you at all? Maybe find you a book?”
Steve flushed at that. “Not entirely. I told her in my last letter I’d met someone but didn’t give all the details. She was excited by the news though, so I don’t imagine she’ll take any offence to the idea once she meets you.”
Bucky stared down at him, shocked. Steve looked up at him, face and chest covered in feathers stuck to the leftover champagne, looking like he’d just been slapped in the face.
Steve huffed. “Well, I can’t blame you for liking Cap’s muscles I guess,” Steve said with a self-deprecating smile and Tony felt his heart clench.
Hmmm.
“Indeed.”
Tony rolled his eyes. “Haha. Yes. Are you going to--”
It was sweet, Tony thought, that he wasn’t the only one who was nervous.
Tony rubbed a hand over his beard. “Not in a long time, no. I was somewhat of a rake in my youth, though that all stopped once I met my dearly departed wife.”
He strode across to the window and looked out over the grounds. It looked like it might rain.
“Yeah, and that was before I realised you were a pool shark, and that you’d use your stupidly good aim to save people from creeps, and actually swear like the soldier you are.”
Tony gaped at him. “He has a
“The pie,” Tony rasped, his throat dry.
“It’s a great machine. I can usually do repairs myself, but I haven’t really got anything with me on the road.”
The gentleman was insufferable.
As the seasons changed, training got harder. They needed to be ready to put on a good show and Fury was putting them through their paces. Stíofán wandered back after a long day of training to the kitchens for dinner but frowned when he didn’t find Tony there. He ate his portion quickly, before heading to their room. He opened the door to find Tony curled up on their pallet, looking pale.
Of all the days for him not to be punctual.
“Can’t complain. You?”
When the dishes were done, Tony moved to put Peter to bed but was met with some resistance.
“And those are the magic words.” He grabbed his phone, slipping it into his pocket, and took his suit jacket off the back of his chair. “I’ll meet you there. You want one?”
“Yeah?”
Mr Barton walked him over to a shed where the tractor sat, big and unmoving. Tony could almost feel the thing suffering, his magic already stretching out, wanting to help. He let the tendrils flow out, inspecting the gears and tapping parts that needed the most love.
Tony wanted to reply but the signal turned green and he and Steve crossed different ways until they were opposite again.
He was travelling through Nevada when he managed to be in the right place at the right time.
Jarvis nodded. “Yes, that sounds like just the ticket. Now, where is the town square?”
Steve smiled, shifting so Peter could sit alongside him and show him the drawing. Tony took in the picture they made, feeling the warmth of knowing this would be their future, the three of them together. And as Steve took his hand, entwining their fingers together with a wink, Tony felt utterly content.
“It’s fine. I’ll leave them to soak,” Steve said, with a smile. “It’s our wedding day after all.” He looked almost boyish at the idea of skipping chores and Tony couldn’t help but smile back. “Come on. Sit yourself down.”
Tony gave one last flick of his fan before taking his leave, waving to the deputies on his way out.
Minor warning: unwanted touching/suggestion
She beamed and then made her way back over to Vision, who was being treated by the Doctor who had clearly been called.
“We would, of course, ask you Commander Stark,” the Chancellor said, looking apologetic. “But we wouldn’t want to disrespect Commander S’Teve.”
He saw the alpha dip his head, and suddenly there was a hot, wet suction on his nipple, and he hissed at the sensation.
“Had to pick up some things over the years.”
“Was it hard?” Steve couldn’t help but ask. “Stepping away from something you’d always thought you were
He went first to the Sheriff’s office, heart still pounding in his chest, but it was dark inside. He growled, unsure where else to go. It was late, he didn’t know where to find the doctor, and he couldn’t wander the streets all night. There was a loud roar of laughter from down the street, and Tony gritted his teeth. It wasn’t proper for him to be in the saloon, especially at this time of night, and he hated to do anything that might embarrass the Sheriff, but there was no other option.
“I came to invite you to a party,” Steve said, peeking up at him over the rims of his glasses. “My friend Bucky is having a get together and I thought you might like to come.”
As he snuck a glance back, he could see Rogers getting smaller and smaller as he rose, his face lit with awe.
The man huffed amused. “She has no concept of boundaries. What are you doing, cat? Getting your paws on him before we even know his name.”
“Here, let me--” He brushed it away, watching the heat rise in Steve’s cheeks again. “You ah, go red a lot huh?”
“Look out!”
He waited.
“What would they even study? A degree in housework?”
“Explain what?” Tony asked. “How you’re this good of an artist? These are incredible.”
Peter shook his head, brown curls tumbling into his eyes. He’d need his hair cut soon. “Mr Rogers isn’t here. How would I know what to learn?”
“Oh fuck,” Tony said, feeling a little sick, “Did you-- is he--”
“Stay on the ground from now on please?” Stíofán told him, giving him a nuzzle. “If you faint while you’re high up you could hurt yourself.”
“Really? That would be great.” Dodger’s sweet nature had put Tony at ease, and he was reluctant to let Peter spend time with just any dog. The thought made him feel a little anxious. “He’s a good boy.” Dodger clearly knew the magic words because he loped over pushing his head into Tony’s hand. Tony laughed. Stroking over his head and back. “He knows when he’s being talked about huh?”
“Yes. Just needed some time away.”
the food as quickly as possible. You’ve seen me at my worst a hundred times over, a bit of skin ain’t going to drive you away.”
Of course he knew some of his friends would roll their eyes when they heard that. But it felt that way to him.
He gave Rhodey and Darcy a weak smile as he headed towards the door, following Coulson out. The sound of the blades grew louder as he stepped onto the street.
Mr Rogers looked a little shamefaced. “I never meant to cause any alarm. I only intended a short walk for my luncheon.”
He wandered the backstreets of the town, letting himself actually look. He’d been so harried lately that he’d forgotten to really stop and get to know the city.
“As sure as I can be,” Dr Banner said, going over to the basin to wash his hands. “Congratulations.”
Tony swallowed, his eyes caught on the way the guy’s muscles shifted beneath his too-tight shirt. He cleared his throat. “Steve. Right. Yes, as long as you ask Steve if it’s ok to pet Dodger.”
Tony tried to push them back onto the bed, but Steve stayed upright, pulling him more firmly into his lap. “Take what you need, sweet thing. I’ll keep you steady.” Because that, if nothing else, was Steve’s job. Keeping their ship afloat, while Tony chartered their course. He lifted Tony up, just far enough to allow him to slip inside, and Tony moaned in relief.
“Yes sir,” Steve repeated, his heart sinking in his chest. “Let me get my things.”
might faint when he saw you. You looked like you might tear him apart.”
Steve almost choked on his tongue. “Oh yeah? I’d love to hear that one.”
Just like yesterday. And the day before.
Tony grumbled for a minute but then shot up, looking over at Peter in a panic. “Is he--”
Pepper clapped her hands together. “A cat! We’re saved.”
As he stepped outside into the bright sun he heard someone say, “A delightful orange gourd for the lady?” at nearly the same time as “No thanks, I don’t like pumpkin,” and then twin gasps and a loud
When he returned, he found the kids had come in from play and were curled up next to the doe. They’d obviously realised he was unwell, as their usual excited chatter was absent.
Then Steve took off down the street, his brain already formulating a plan of attack. This was what he was made for, this was his job and his responsibility. He was here to fight bullies and look out for the little guy.
He pulled on his boots, then his jacket, tying the belt to keep out the chill.
They ended up sitting close together at the workbench, Steve holding the broomstick steady as Tony made his adjustments. He could feel the warmth along his side and couldn’t help but lean into it.
Steve’s hand came up to cup his face. “No, you feel warm. You might’ve caught Peter’s fever.”
This was what he needed. This was where he needed to be. He just needed to put the plan into action.
“You can say that again,’” Tony agreed. He pushed himself up, the mud squelching beneath him. He was filthy, and cold, and soaked to his skin and his broom was…
Tony smiled. “The Doctor knows best. I assure you Jarvis will make sure you follow his orders to the letter.”
“Steve!”
“I think that’s a talk for another time,” Tony interjected smoothly, and Steve looked relieved. “How about you worry more about how much food you’re dropping on the floor?”
“The meeting with Comms and design. They’re hiring a new designer for the StarkScan launch, part of the new medical line? We’ve got less than twelve months to finalise everything and you said you wanted a say.”
“Morning,” Steve said, tipping his hat. He walked along the station platform, trying not to look too antsy.
“Yes, well, you wouldn’t have much cause to. And it only happens sometimes, when I’m stressed or surprised. But forget it, it’s not a big deal, I’m used to it. Now, where were we?”
He was so gone, and that was so very dangerous.
“Well no matter. I think I can assist nonetheless.” And that was all the warning Steve got before he was scooped up like a babe, his head coming to rest against the warmth of Mr Stark’s shoulder, securely held in his arms.
The house was starting to take shape though it’d be some time before it was finished. Bucky was walking around like cock of the walk as they prepared, talking about how fine his doe was and how he was going to fill his house with kids.
She got a napkin to the face for her trouble. “Cheeky brat.”
“Thank you. Really, when I say you’ve helped I mean it. It feels safe when Peter’s with you. I feel like I can relax outside my own house for once.”
“Mhmm,” Tony hummed, giving the little head a stroke.
Tony walked over to the desk he gestured to, taking a seat and placing the basket carefully on the top.
“Yeah but I know. And I'm sure Tony knows too, he was just real het up over the situation, quite rightly, and if you guys had had a chance to talk before we left, then I'm sure it would have blown over by now. But I mean he's had four days to cool off, so I'm sure he's not mad anymore”
Tony didn’t even think. It was as if he and the broom were one, swan diving down, faster and faster, his hand reaching out and his heart pounding in his ears. He could hear Steve’s scream, and he closed his eyes, letting his magic focus until it found the watch on Steve’s wrist. His hand snapped out, curling around the thin arm and holding tight, as he pulled up, trying to save them both from the ground rushing up to meet them and--
S’Teve was trying to process what Tony had just said, even as his brain pulled the memory forward. “You were injured by one of the Zenran weapons when they mistook us for spies.”
He grabbed for Tony, clearly forgetting for a moment where they were and leaned too far, making Tony jump forward to grab him, his hands twisted in Steve’s leather jacket. “Be careful!”
“To join me?” Tony asked, and the Sheriff nodded, seeming grateful Tony had made the suggestion.
When he came back upstairs, it was silent. Steve’s art supplies were gone from the coffee table, his clothes missing from his drawer, his round art case no longer leaning against the wall. The only sign of him was a loose leaf of paper on the counter. It was a sketch: one of Tony sleeping on the couch. It was so lovingly drawn, and for a moment Tony’s heart clenched. He took it, reading the inscription in the corner.
“I should’ve caught you, but I was too focused on reading the briefing packet, so I’m sorry about that,” he looked frustrated, but Tony’s eyebrows nearly shot off his forehead. Caught him? The guy was like a foot shorter and half his weight: Tony probably would’ve crushed him.
When the rain finally stopped, they headed out again, making for the sea. Tony had only ever seen the sea once on a holiday as a kid, so he’d known that when he picked his town it would have to be on the coast. The idea of waking up every day to the beautiful blue water was high on his list.
“Oh,” Tony’s voice was soft as he looked over it, eyes wide. “It’s just like you said.”
Wait what? “He’s been what?”
But the GQ list? Flaunting it like this felt very much like a lie.
“And to think one of these animals gets to keep one free of charge...” the voices faded as they drifted down the corridor.
Antonius flushed red, his face as though aflame. “I haven’t ever--”
“And you haven’t?” she said challengingly. “Talking about searching for adventure and fighting bears and god knows what, instead of thinking about settling down with someone sensible?”
He felt a sob rise up in his chest, but he pushed it back. Jarvis hadn’t raised him to be a quitter after all. Maybe he wasn’t any good at...that, but he could certainly be an asset to the house.
Stíofán frowned. “Do you want me to fetch you something to eat?”
Steve smiled sheepishly. “Some guy didn’t like the cut of my jib.”
“Sounds good to me. Hell, you beat me to the punch, I had a whole plan where I was going to show you the sketches I’d done of you at the fair.”
Tony snorted. “Hardly. I’m just lucky Sam and Rhodey were so nice--”
That was a good question. Tony thought for a moment and then snapped his fingers. “Don’t worry, Cap. I have a cunning plan.”
Because there really wasn’t any way to come back from ‘shirtless poster from your experimental transformation in 1943’ with any kind of dignity. He swallowed nervously. “A technically classified image of project rebirth.”
He brushed the idea aside though it wasn’t as if it wasn’t an option. The
“Yeah, if you want to come? It’ll be fun.”
“Why? You’re ill. You’ve been ill for two weeks.” Already his cheeks were getting more prominent, the weight he’d been putting on starting to slip away.
He pulled his shield from his back and threw it, slicing into the side of it before it looped back around for him to catch. He squinted at the mark - it remained, but didn’t seem to slow it at all. He looked up trying to gauge its height. At least three stories. This was going to be difficult. He watched as the blob absorbed a car. Very difficult.
“Which one are you looking for?”
“This don’t concern you Sheriff,” Hodge spat, and the omega whose arm he held whimpered. Her friend tugged at her arm trying to get her free.
She threw up her hands. “I can buy my own suppressants! I’m not a kid!”
Tony could feel the echo of pain in those words and he hugged Steve tighter. It felt nice, and Steve was warm and kind, and Tony let himself enjoy the hug for a long moment until he pulled away. He pointed at the sketches on the wall. “Seems to me like you’re getting there. It’s just taking more time than expected. And with fewer people shooting at you.”
“We don’t have a bearskin rug.”
“Cute kid,” Steve said and Tony blinked, trying to pay attention.
Tony stayed close, seemingly glued to his side, and Stíofán wasn’t complaining. He was still sipping his wine when Fury came over.
Tony began to explain, taking more bread as Rhodey put it in front of him. He started with witch tradition, told him about their flight over, and then it wasn’t long before the words spilled out, telling them about how he’d lost their money and he wasn’t sure what to do.
Clint brandished the magazine at him and Tony raised an eyebrow. “Wow Cap, guess you beat me out this year.” The machine beeped and he grabbed his mug. “I better up my game next time.” He gave Steve a wink, and it took everything in him not to blush.
“Got it. What would I do without you?”
Steve was tucked up in their bed, and Tony sat beside him, holding his hand once he’d seen the deputy on his way.
Tony feigned disappointment. “I’m sorry, it seems you missed the memo. Stark Industries doesn’t do weapons, and we don’t do IOUs. So you’ve stormed our Christmas party for nothing.”
Steve coughed.
“Night, Tony.”
“I’m coming!” He slung his duffel over his shoulder and picked up his shield case. “I’ve got to go.”
Tony reached out to take the pup, the little body warm on his hands. “What’s his name?”
“I have to go,” Steve choked out, backing up towards the chopper. He grabbed the handhold and stepped up into the carriage, his eyes never leaving Tony’s.
A warm wet mouth dragged along his cock, the heat and soft slide almost indescribable. It felt as though all the sensation in his body was locked onto one single point, and as the doe bobbed his head, the pressure moved along every inch.
Steve huffed. Then his shoulders slumped. “...by taking some boudoir photos.”
“Sorry, I just needed--” And then his lips were on Tony’s. Tony smiled into it, even as he had to tilt the broom to stop them both from falling.
“You just shaved ten years off my life kid, and I need those.”
Steve kept it up for a moment, and then relaxed, letting the grin spread over his face. “Can you do it backwards?”
“Steve?!” Tony’s jaw dropped, taking in the familiar, dirt-streaked face. “What the fuck?”
“Wow. What other tricks can he do?”
Perhaps it was bad form to spend the afternoon knocking down targets instead of working, but well. No alpha could resist the opportunity to put their arms around their pretty omega to teach them a few new tricks. Steve held Tony against him as he muttered a few instructions in his ear, helping him get the timing right to hit more than one target in the air, shamelessly taking advantage of being able to breathe in his scent.
As they reached the steps of the townhouse, Steve swung Peter down and let him hug Dodger goodbye. Steve looked at Tony. “So I guess I’ll see you guys at the park?”
The alpha swung again, the noise echoing in the room. Loud enough to be heard outside, Tony realised.
Tony didn’t push anymore, for which he was grateful, but did hand him the black kitten when his coffee arrived so the little guy wouldn’t stick his face in it. Steve laughed as he tried to prevent one kitten getting onto the table, while keeping an eye on a little ginger one who seemed to be on some sort of scouting mission.
Tony laughed, unable to stop the flush from creeping into his cheeks. “Flattery will get you everywhere Sheriff.”
Tony watched as he slipped under the covers. “Mind if I try something?”
He gave Steve’s hand a squeeze and Steve felt a small thrill at the feeling of Tony’s hand against his. It was warm, and he could feel the light thump of Tony’s pulse. The heat rose in his face, and he tried to clamp down on it, not wanting Tony to see him having such a strong reaction to what was nothing more than a casual touch. It just...felt like more.
“Be honest with me.”
Tony huffed a laugh and wriggled further till he was close enough.
“You put that hand back, sir,” Tony ordered. “Or you’ll get cold oats in the morning.”
been and precious to boot. And here he was being brave and ready to make a fool of himself just to dance with Tony.
He sucked in air, feeling oddly breathless but when he looked over at Steve, the guy was smiling.
Steve got through another few pages before there were telltale twin snores, and he closed
Steve huffed. “Maybe.”
Steve was looking at him with a slight frown on his face and, now Tony could see him clearly, an undercurrent of hurt. “How do you have that?”
It all happened in slow motion, Steve smiled back at him, and then the table jolted as the man knocked against it and the coffee slipped from his hand and splashed onto the table in a wave as it spanned the small table and dripped into Tony’s lap.
“It’s alright. I’m worried too.” He wrapped an arm around Tony’s shoulders. “I’m proud of you.”
He stepped forward, planning to take it out on Hodge, but Tony put a hand to his chest. “Leave him. He’s tied up and he can face the judge.”
Tony and Peter sat by the stove, eating pie and custard, while Steve read aloud.
“Umm, hello?” The sound had changed direction slightly, and this time, Steve realised there was a man
There was a flash of Tony, curled up on his couch back at the apartment gesturing at the TV as he got more and more worked up, and Steve felt the curve of a smile before he pushed it back down. Focus. He needed to focus.
Tony yelped, falling backwards, the pain sharp as the snake retreated. Ow, that hurt!
Tony felt a smile spread over his face. “Well Sheriff Rogers, if you insist.”
He turned to the manticore.
“But I can’t stop now,” Tony protested, almost dropping his glass. “I’m finally starting to build up clients!”
He reached out, taking the slicer from the side of the dish, and cut a large slice of the pie, sliding it onto a plate.
Tony stepped into the room and frowned. “Peter?”
“Coffee? Or do you need to head off?” Tony asked, feeling hopeful.
“That was...really something, Mr Rogers,” Wilson said, putting his empty plate on the table.
Steve’s heart was pounding like crazy as he rode Nomad out to the canyon he knew Hodge’s gang liked to frequent.
Tony let go of his shoulder, and S’Teve missed the clarity it provided him, of what Tony was feeling. Then Tony reached out, curling in his thumb and the back two fingers, leaving the index and middle extended.
--be totally ignored by everyone in the square. No one even gave him more than a glance as he stood there, grinning like an idiot, holding a broom aloft. He waited a moment to see if it was just surprise holding them back, but it soon became clear it was not awe. It was disinterest, pure and simple.
“Yeah, super sexy. Seriously, sometimes I cry when I see your abs.”
But it seemed Tony had been a kind of slave long before he was sold.
It was nice. Some nights they worked late into the night, spending more time messing around than working, and Tony found himself noticing
He was beautiful: flushed, and gorgeous, and so obviously exhausted, but all the more striking for it. Steve encouraged him, using his hands to increase the sensations, brushing over hot sensitive skin, until Tony was almost feral with it, chasing his release with wild abandon as Steve focused on keeping him safely cradled against him.
More than two months late, Tony fretted as he walked towards the doctor’s office. He’d been fairly regular since he and Steve had bonded. He was pretty sure their last heat hadn’t been successful. It was almost four months ago, and he’d have noticed a change by now.
“Not like that,” Tony murmured.
“Oooh, can we get pizza? All this daydreaming about luring a pizza guy to his death in the woods is making me crave ham and pineapple.”
He made a confused sound, louder than he intended, and Steve shot up, looking around for a threat before his worried eyes landed on Tony.
“You want access to him,” Stíofán surmised and Fury nodded.
“The food ok?” Steve asked, looking concerned. He’d nearly finished his own by the time Tony was barely a third of the way through.
He put on his corset beneath a lace shift. It was tight, flattering his figure, but not too restrictive since he knew he’d be walking. He hated to wear them, but he’d been told many a time how well it made him look, so now was not a day to skimp. Atop it he chose a long sleeved shirt and a flowing pair of trousers to suit. It was already very warm, so he forewent his jacket and instead grabbed his parasol. He didn’t want to get an unsightly tan or freckles. Lastly he tugged on his hat, leaving only a curl or two of hair about his face visible.
“Dad! The extras bag is now four bags! It was meant to be for a few items we weren’t sure if I needed, not half the store!”
Tony watched him leave with a sigh of relief. “Thank you, sir. I wasn’t sure how to get him to leave.”
Eventually they swung by the Sheriff’s Office so Steve could show Tony where he worked. He pushed open the door, and then there was a low whistle.
“Coffee would be great.”
“It’s ok.”
He stared up at the man in a panic, whose expression turned concerned. “Are you ok?”
It would’ve been weird for one, and also he was actually pretty busy a lot of the time.
“Goodnight my treasures.” Stíofán leaned down, kissing each horn and nose before tucking the furs beneath their chins as their eyes fluttered closed.
He thrust his hips up making the doe groan. They moved together, the pleasure building as they shifted, the feeling in his belly pulling tighter and together. He knew what he wanted to hear.
Steve finished tying the hands of the man on the ground, deftly securing the knot. He was bursting with energy now, the adrenaline of the fight racing through his body, and the knowledge that now they could be on their way home.
“Felt personal,” Tony said, around a forkful of pasta.
(See the end of the chapter for
Wilson gave a low whistle. “Some alphas get all the luck. I’m still cooking for myself while my omega’s away, and I can tell you I’ve got a whole new respect for her skills.” He moved aside to let Tony enter, and Tony walked inside to see an empty office.
Tony caught sight of the omegas he’d overheard gossiping watching closely from the sidelines. He realised they wouldn’t have seen the alpha dance before, and they certainly wouldn’t have gotten to dance with him.
Tony raised a confused brow but moved closer to see. Oh, he understood what the guy meant. The dirigible was caught in the strong winds, thrashing against its ropes. There were scores of people trying to hold it in place. There were also a lot of stressed-looking higher-ups pointing up at it, and Tony could sympathise. Launch Day was tomorrow - something Tony knew because Steve wouldn’t shut up about it - so having it go wrong this close must be a nightmare.
The alpha drew himself up. “I did not come here to be disrespected like this!”
The group turned to face them, and Tony felt his grin stretch as they took in the new scent. “Sheriff, Mr Rogers, how nice to see you,” Murphy said, mouth twisting in irritation. Tony wondered if he’d been interested in Steve once upon a time before bonding with the Pastor.
Steve sighed, opting not to correct the name, and picked the boy up to rest on his hip. He guessed he was going to have a helper at the office for the remainder of the day. “He sure did. How did it look?”
,” Stíofán said dryly and Antonius flicked back to him. He became aware of a hot, heady perfume coming off the doe, made to entice a buck. He was starting to feel drunk on it.
Tony was… gorgeous. He looked like he walked right off the silver screen half the time, and scruffy and ridiculous the other, and Steve couldn’t get enough of him either way. He hadn’t expected it, but their first meeting in the helicarrier had stirred Steve up in all kinds of ways, his instincts reacting to the powerful, hot alpha in front of him in a way he knew meant they were compatible.
For a moment, Steve looked like he might actually try. But then his shoulders slumped and he sighed. “Where are you even going to keep it?”
around his waist and then wandered back towards the sleeping quarters.
“So will you help?”
“I can’t pay for dinner eith--”
And Tony would be forever heartbroken.
Stíofán nodded with a smile which Tony returned. They sat staring for a moment before Tony shivered, and Stíofán realised he was probably not as warm as he’d been. He grabbed the blanket from his pallet and wrapped it around the faun, pleased when it got him a grateful smile.
Sam waved a hand. “We’ve kept it quiet. Didn’t want it to be a whole thing if we didn’t succeed, you know?
He let Stíofán set him to rights, tidying his shift and making him look presentable. “We can do it whenever you want.”
Tony took in the pretty pink blush once more before he nodded. “Definitely.” He’d make sure of it.
“Nice to meet you both. I don’t recall seeing you around?”
Steve seemed to like the touch, leaning into Tony’s hands and Tony rewarded his enthusiasm. He trailed kisses over his neck and chest, feeling the twitches beneath the skin each time he uncovered a new spot. “Ticklish?”
The hand drifted higher, dragging up his thigh, until a tentative finger brushed against his opening and he gasped.
Steve didn’t say anything more, just pushed back inside, and Tony sighed at the change in angle. The room filled with moans as Steve picked up the pace, balancing one hand on the headboard, the other on Tony’s waist to hold him in place.
“I know, I just need a shower – five minutes.” He didn’t look like he usually did post-run. Hardly sweaty at all. But whatever, she just needed him to get ready.
“Tell me about the deal.”
“When I scare him, he falls!” Hugh crowed and Stíofán blinked.
Bucky. Hardly the grand name a rival suitor should have but nonetheless. “Yes. I’m sure he’ll wish to check on you himself. Men in love do not wish to see their beloveds hurt after all.”
using any spells. He’d just finished, cleaning off oil he’d gotten on his hands when he’d had to reach in and actually physically remove a loose part so his magic could do its thing in the Colonel’s kitchen, when there was a shout from the living room.
“Yeah.” Tony shrugged. “If you almost die for a plant that makes you its foster parent. I’m pretty sure that’s how it works.”
Tony’s stiffened, the happy expression gone in an instant. “No.”
“Actually, he made it,” Bucky chimed in, ignoring the death-promising glare Steve was giving him. “Come on, open it.”
“Thanks Dad.”
Steve paused then, turning back to him with a thoughtful look before he came around the side of the bed and dusted a kiss to Tony’s knuckles. “I’ll see you soon. Lock the door once I’m gone.”
“Well don’t let them bother you. Plenty of good folks here, you’ll see.” She put a few jars on the table. “Now let’s get started, hmm?”
He grinned down at the shield on his arm, and armour on his chest. It was every bit as good as Tony had said, and he felt a swell of pride. He was wearing armour handmade by his doe, who cared for him enough to make him near invincible. He had no plans of losing now.
Tony dutifully turned to the last page and his jaw dropped. “Holy fuck.”
Tony hummed. “Sure. It always is. I grew up thinking I’d take over the company, I’d always liked engineering and I’m damn good at it. But then I realised, that just wasn’t what I
Had what he had done been enough? He scrambled over, his hands passing over Steve’s body as he checked for injuries. “Steve, are you--”
“Peter.”
This is the final chapter of the main story, but worry not gentle readers, there are THREE bonus chapters/mini sequels in production and on their way - the first will be out in a week or two so make sure you're subscribed to
“I told you to stop taking my damn horse. Use your own.”
“I wouldn’t say no to a piece of pie,” Barnes offered. And Steve nodded, cutting the last of the pie in half, and offering the two absurdly large pieces to his men.
He expected to feel sad, but instead, he felt bold. Like a pioneer.
“It’s alright Steve, you’ll be safe here. There’s food and drink in the bags there, and heat aids in the drawer. You need anything, just ask JARVIS, he’ll sort it out.”
Tony smiled, expression soft. “You cared about me enough to stay, and I started to notice how different you were around me compared to everyone else. And I wanted more. I wanted to be the person you opened up to, who touched you when you needed it, but I didn’t know how to ask. I wanted to be on the receiving end of those cute blushes of yours, and I spend a lot of hours remembering being held by you and wondering what it would be like to experience those muscles of yours in the privacy of my quarters.” His smile turned self-deprecating. “I wanted to be with you, but I was willing to accept just being your friend.”
“I’m so sorry, oh my god, I told you to open it later, but you insisted -”
The moonlight shone through the living room windows, bathing the apartment in a silver glow.
“No need to fret, Ms Maximoff, we’ll get him out.” Then Bucky caught sight of Tony. “Mr Rogers, what are you--”
Steve pressed a kiss to his head. “We didn’t exactly part on good terms.”
Then he had the torturous experience of watching a huge, handsome buff man read to his kid and wow, Tony thought he was too old for the butterflies-in-his-stomach kind of crush, but apparently not.
“I’m not being rude! People travel there to settle it. That means there’s nothing there!” She crossed her arms, looking worried. “How do you know he’s telling the truth? He says he’s young and respectable, but he could be some drunken gambler, out fixing to trick some city omega into becoming his soiled dove.”
He could hear their footsteps approaching and he knew he should stop before they got there. But as he started to pull away, Tony reached back and grabbed his tunic holding him in place. “Harder, please!”
He handed the ginger to Hugh who knee walked back up the bed to present it to Tony who smiled gratefully. Stíofán removed the clay pot and cleaned it out, before coming back to lie at the head of the bed, pulling Tony up to lie against him.
“Did you see what the prize was for the gladiatorial contest tomorrow?” One of the guards asked another, as they walked past Stíofán’s room.
“Military?” Tony asked, and Steve’s head shot up, wondering if he’d given too much away. “My best friend Rhodey was the same when he got his medical discharge. It takes time to readjust.”
He was being presented as the Sheriff’s new omega, in his new home, and he would look his best damnit.
Sam plated up another two burgers, and J.J let the prince slide down his back and take a plate.
Tony hid his face in Steve’s chest, torn between embarrassment and laughter, listening to Steve’s heart race at the burst of adrenaline. It also meant he heard the rumble of a growl when Bucky didn’t
The first time he’d made that discovery, Tony had been left stared at the ceiling, still trying to get his breath back. “I don’t know how you did that. But we’re doing it again. Lots.”
“I have,” Tony replied, trying to hide his surprise. “I enjoyed it immensely. His thoughts on the possibility of space travel were fascinating, though I’m not so sure I agree with him about some of his more...
“Friday?”
The reporter continued their commentary, but all Tony could focus on was the huge group of people trying to hold the last rope. The ship was hit by another gust, and it was clearly too much, the ship pulling free, and the rope slipping the grip of all the ground crew.
“Hey now,” Steve’s voice said, coming from somewhere above the wound, but Tony couldn’t stop staring at it. “It’s alright.”
“‘Beloved’ he says. You are the reason I can no longer walk and you mock me.”
They gathered the gear together and Steve managed to find a reason to send them both inside, feeling a little guilty for lying, before he checked for observers. He moved to the leaning side, and digging his feet in gave it a heavy shove with his shoulder. The sign post groaned as it straightened, the sign standing proudly again and Steve felt a small thrill at doing something useful. He quickly tied a rope between his bike and the post, revved his engine for effect, and when the two men came out, held out his arms in a ‘voila’ motion.
Tony felt a stone settle in his stomach. “What.”
“Well you know,” Tony said, twirling a hand in the air. “I’m sort of a genius, no big deal.”
He was still holding it when two arms wrapped around his waist and he was hoisted into the air.
Bucky felt a rumble in his chest and for a moment he wasn’t sure what it was. But then it burst forward, a laugh erupting from his whole body, and he struggled to breathe as he doubled over, bracing his arms on his thighs to stop him from joining Steve on the floor.
“Good,” Tony still looked smug and Stíofán decided that was enough.
“Fair enough. We can even print hers in the same colour if you like?”
“Can’t sleep in this chair all night.” He wanted to get Tony lying down and comfortable, maybe get some food in him. He still looked exhausted.
All Tony had was a sore eye, a life-or-death situation, and no idea if Steve would even care or not when he heard the news.
Peadar yawned. “Yes Da.”
He wasn’t sure how the alpha managed it, but he kept his face clear of any disgust. He chewed and swallowed. Then he gave Tony a smile. “Delicious as always, sweetheart,” he said, raising his voice to be heard a little over the chatter.
Steve couldn’t imagine it. Couldn’t make it fit together in his head. “I’m just not sure that’s in the cards for me.”
“I just don’t want you to make the mistakes I made. I got pregnant because I got betrayed by someone I trusted. And while now I can’t say I regret it - I got two amazing, talented kids and an alpha that respects and loves me and I got to do more with my career than I ever would have on my own – I got lucky. I got so, so lucky. If your grandmother hadn’t left me this place, or some other omega had realised how great your pops was before I got here, my life, your life, would’ve been very different. So while it worked out for me, and I’m so happy it did, I just want to be sure you’re going to be careful and that you get to make your own decisions with your life and not have it decided for you.”
There was a loud bang against the door. “Hurry up! I have to have a shower.”
“Thank you.” There was a depth of gratitude there, and Steve had the feeling that Rhodey had spent a lot of time dealing with his slightly reckless best friend.
“Yeah, that must suck.”
The answering smile he got in return was well worth it.
He wandered the streets, eyes trying to take everything in. He was so distracted, he knocked shoulders with someone. “Oh, I’m sorry, I--”
“Oh right,” the guy said, shoulders slumping. “I shouldn’t have done that. Just because I saved you doesn't mean I’m forgiven.”
Curious, Tony thought. He dressed, pulling on his robes and styling his hair, before heading down the stairs and into the big house. He was enveloped by the familiar smell of freshly baked bread and sugar as he stepped inside, trailing through to the sitting room before coming to a stop.
“Where’d you hear that one?”
It was a nice dream.
“Bucky then,” Tony agreed. “And who have you brought with you?”
Steve flushed and for a moment Tony thought he’d made a mistake, but then he smiled. “I’d love to.”
She hadn’t told them. Easier to ask forgiveness than permission as her dad always said. She bet he was regretting that
“But if I don’t--”
“Yes I know!” Tony snapped, and then immediately felt guilty. “I’m sorry Jarvis. I don’t mean to be a dick.”
“When did I say that?”
“No.”
Bucky pulled a small knife from his belt. “Sure, you need me to jimmy something?”
His deductions were confirmed when the two embraced and Tony felt his heart sink.
Those weren’t their curtains.
Tony felt a twinge in his heart. Dammit. He hated when Rhodey was right. “Yeah. Me too.”
“So what’s your secret? Is it protein shakes or do you just have a jaw that would make an omega swoon?” Clint asked teasingly.
“I’ve got work tomorrow till 4pm but if you want to come by after to work on your broom, I’ll be around,” Steve offered, rubbing the back of his neck.
All of which had let to this moment, where Steve had gone on a fool’s errand to try and forget his feelings, so that he might behave himself and act like the respectable teacher he was instead of losing all sense of propriety every time he heard Mr Stark say--
“I bet you thought you’d be getting someone more skilled in keeping house when you answered my advertisement,” Tony mumbled as he helped himself to the bread.
“Quit it!” Steve laughed, and Tony grinned, letting a hand drift down to tug on Steve’s jeans.
The last one in particular hurt since he had woken up post-heat alone, with no signs Tony had been anywhere near his room since he’d left him there.
Steve chuckled. “Usually a good sign.”
, Tony thought, and then mentally shook himself. That was a ridiculous thing to say, and totally creepy. They were friends, just friends, and they’d only know each other for a short while. Instead, he managed the much toned down. “Well, you’re welcome anytime. We'd be happy to have you.”
Stíofán’s eyebrows rose to his hairline. “Tony, you can’t just take up metalwork with no training, that’s insane.”
Tony managed a smile, still feeling a little raw. He was glad the oil lamps were low so his puffy face was less obvious. He took the bread Steve offered, layering it generously with the jam. He nibbled at it delicately, enjoying the sweet, sharp taste of the preserves.
An image filled his head of some pretty omega in lacey things, reclining on the bed and crooking their finger to the Sheriff. The kind of omega who knew how to seduce and keep an alpha interested for a pretty penny: why wouldn’t he take the opportunity? Tony felt sick.
Tony was sure he’d only been trying to be polite. He looked over at his wet clothes. He was in no state to go to a party anyway, so there was no point wallowing. Instead, he let his exhaustion take over as the room warmed up and fell asleep.
the cat. Oh. He tried not to blush.
“I had rather hoped that perhaps you might make an offer.” It was quiet, barely above a murmur but it sounded so loud in Tony’s ears. “But that...that is ridiculous. You have been kind to me, a good friend and employer, and I mistake your affection for more than it is, I understand that. I walked the grounds today to try and distance myself from my reactions to your presence, but instead I caused you great trouble, and missed Peter’s lessons,” he sniffled a little. “I hope my inappropriate feelings towards you won’t impact your decision to keep me as Peter’s tutor. He is a sweet boy and I would miss him greatly. As would I you, if I had to leave.”
“Someone has to,” Maria said, ignoring the offended ‘Hey!’ from her dad.
Tony burst out laughing. “He’s going to get you back when he finds out, you know.”
Because Tony was...well. Tony had been GQ’s hottest alpha three times for a good reason and he didn’t need to do a thing. Steve was just gaming the system.
He finally had everything he wanted, and he had never been more happy to have placed his ad in that catalogue.
.” He stretched, a glint in his eyes and Stíofán had the distinct feeling he was being teased. “Apparently I must labour in the kitchens.” He looked at his silks upon the floor. “These will be hell to clean.”
“Sure, unless you’re busy. Guy like you, you must be out on the town every night.”
But before Peter could get near it, a flash of gold fur jumped in front of him, growling and barking.
The manager greeted Tony warmly, leading them through to a room filled with older people camped out in chairs. The tv was playing softly and there were a few board games taking place in the corner.
, when Mr Stark had come in, fresh from a meeting with his banker - which Steve only knew about because the man had spent breakfast whining about the inconvenience - and perched himself on the bench beside them.
, Steve. I couldn’t keep doing it after that.” He tugged at his sleeve. “And I found out he planned to have me killed. The man was more of a father to me than Howard, and he-- Well, he’s in prison now. Nothing more to be done.”
“Oh wow.” That hadn’t come up in the lessons from SHIELD. Too much focus on military history. “I didn’t know that.”
“Oh right. Well, that sounds great. And hey, just saying: you’re an adult. Whatever you and Steve get up to in that workshop is your business.”
Stíofán didn’t manage to stifle his grin, he was too excited but he did lean down to give Tony a long kiss on the forehead and a nuzzle. He got a nuzzle in return so he figured he wasn’t in too much trouble. “Waiting on you hand and hoof, we agreed. I’ll go fetch some.”
“Everything ok?” Tony asked, sounding concerned.
Maria snorted, almost inhaling the fry she was eating. “Oh my god, don’t.”
“Tony!” His mother called, looking proud. They might not always have gotten along as Tony wished, but witchcraft was the one thing that had allowed them to bond, that his mother understood about him in its entirety, and the times spent learning the craft from her were his favourite memories. “I can’t believe it’s time for you to go! It’s only yesterday you were charming flowers to grow in the back garden.”
It was so quiet, Tony thought. There were birds chirping of course, and the faintest sound of trickling water that Tony assumed must be a stream of some sort, but it was so silent compared to back East. Tony didn’t think he’d ever had so much quiet just to hear every thought he had, and he felt a tenseness he didn’t even know he was carrying just fall away.
Tony let a smile uncurl on his face. It felt rather apt, after so much time of he and Steve missing each other like ships in the night for them to finally meet now.
Tony was just glad they hadn’t decided to stick wholly to tradition. Back when his mother has done hers, it was done when a witch turned thirteen. But well, people had more concerns about child safety now than they had in the eighties, so it had become the norm to leave at the first full moon after your eighteenth birthday. To say Tony was ready to leave the nest was an understatement.
“Let him go!”
“No thank you. I’m waiting for my fiancé.” It felt odd to say the words out loud, but that’s what Mr Rogers was.
Tony gestured to how happy Peter was. “Kid loves dogs. I figured he was old enough that we could get one, but I wanted him to get used to one first and learn the do’s and don’ts before we bring one into the house.”
Tony flushed, unsure what to do. “No no, it’s very good. I’m just a slow eater is all.” His stomach rumbled in protest.
Tony cursed that they hadn’t  just held the event at the tower. They never would’ve gotten past JARVIS.
Another sigh. God, she didn’t want to leave them. Up there were all of the Avengers plus some new additions. Tensions were high. Especially after Steve and the others (not including Thor and Bruce because they were still MIA) adopted Wanda into their team.
"I'm sorry."
Hope you liked it!
"Uhhh... Okay.. I'm not expecting because I already... have??? A baby?? Ehhh.. heh.."
"I just want to know one thing. Why? Why did you choose Bucky over me?" Her voice was cold, and she stared right into Steve's eyes.
With terror in her eyes to turned towards Peter. Toni's entire world shattered.
Looking at the woman, she saw how pale and tired she was. Her eyes started to flutter.
Life isn't fair. It never was and never will be. Things were given to people that they never wanted. Things that happened to people who never deserved it.
“Wilson, it’s late. I want to go to sleep. There’s no need for a fight.”
It was Richard, May, Benjamin, and Mary Parker all huddled together. They all were surrounding a very pregnant Mary. Fuck. She was giving birth.
He did.
"I know that, White. Shut up." Both men looked in horror at the child, each thinking that he was insane.
" Venom finally slithered out and looked at his son teasingly. Carnage just rolled his eyes.
”If anyone of us will survive, it will be him. Please, Toni.” Mary’s voice was so faint, the woman almost couldn’t hear it. She turned towards the woman and bent down.
It was Deadpool. The teen had a black slime around him,
But Eddie couldn't ever be the wonderful mother she wanted to be.
”19.”
I just hope that the Avengers don't make things so much worse :D
I’m so sorry for how horrible this chapter is. And the long wait. School has taken all my time. I started losing inspiration for this Fic. Being the idiot that I am, I began more fics based on the random ideas I got.
"Mhm. Now, it looks like you..." Toni paused for dramatic effect. "Want some pets??" The engineer tried her best to look as confused as possible.
”Hah! We were. Not anymore though. Well, it’s been nice talking to you-“ Just then the engineer got up and tried to walk away. A strong hand held her back.
"Oh, darling. I know you will. My amazing parasite." Eddie caught Venom's mouth in a loving kiss. She draped an arm over their shoulder and used her other arm to cup their face softly. The woman was still trembling as she did so and her body had already begun to vanish. Eddie gave Venom one last smile and whispered, "My darling symbiote," before vanishing away in her Other's arms.
Fruity and sweet. Just like Peter. He really loved his ice cream and ate it everyday. The scent of his ice cream always lingered, and it became a trademark of Peter. Her hands shook as she looked at the glass bottle. She stilled them and put the substance on her hair.
Things only got worse when they saw a certain Spider-kid. Because FRIDAY was offline, Rhodey gathered the rest of the footage from KAREN.
“Your shower is already ready, miss. You have about ten minutes to get ready.” The calm voice of JARVIS only reminded her that she needed to hurry.
"Hey V?"
"Your shower is ready Miss."
The other doctors and nurses, even Dr. Strange, said today would be his last day.
“Sorry. Toni, there have been sightings of Thor in New York. Director Fury wants us to go on a mission to find him. His brother, Loki, has also been seen. We’re actually leaving tomorrow.”
”Fuck off. I’m glad she’s not going to marry you. She’s probably incinerated that garbage ring a long time ago. Toni doesn’t deserve to be with someone that always makes her second guess herself, insults her, won’t trust her, possibly hit her, and all that shitty stuff. Good thing that Thor will take her off of your gloved hands. At least that guy won’t be too arrogant to admit wrong doing. Stay away from Toni, I mean it.” He purposely knocked himself against Steve’s shoulder as he stormed off.
”Of course, Miss. This is the Oscorp building, and it has been set aflame. It is also evident that the chemicals and other materials in the building have caused the fire to be even more severe and give chemical burns to the victims.”
"Put me doooown!!! I'm going to puke!" It was an empty threat, but Toni complied. Peter was still on the bed, dead asleep. That was until Wade yelled at the top of his lungs.
The fight in her had died out. She didn’t try to refute.
All he could do was wait for his mother to arrive.
“Push! I see his head!”
All around him were spiders, spinning webs without a care in the world. Peter carefully walked through the enclosure, not wanting to disturb the spiders. As friendly and affectionate as Webby was, spiders were not to be messed with. Just appreciate them and treat them with respect. The entire room was coated in a blue light that made the entire space seem creepy and futuristic. It was peaceful, and Peter managed to slow the rapid beat of his heart. Eventually, he reached the end of the room, where the last spider rested. This one seemed special. It had red and blue splotches all over it and carried a mysterious aura to it. Tempting. Maybe if he could just touch it.
All the students and parents paused their conversation to stare at the one and only, Antonia Stark. Even though she came for every student-parent meeting, PTA grouping, open house, school play, or field trip, it was still a shock to them that she appeared. It was flattering, of course, having people be beyond shocked at your presence. At least, one person didn't have the same expression. Eddie, five months pregnant with twins, was beaming at her friend while holding a sleepy Carnage. The woman smiled in response and walked toward her, Wade following.
.” The Russian woman turned sharply at him. Steve sighed.
“No! It’s-it’s fine. I’m a big boy-I mean- an adult. I can handle it.”
Being in Wakanda has its perks. Including a huge stock of vibranium and advanced technology. It was 6 A.M. when she started since everyone couldn’t sleep and had breakfast as an ungodly hour. Better for her. For over ten hours, Toni worked worked. She put in everything that Peter had said he wanted. Same design, colors, and powers. Her shirt was torn and stain terribly, so was her pants. Oh well. She had a new suit to wears. The mother carefully put the other suit in a case she created and went to her room to change.
"Loud and clear, sis. Loud and clear." Toni smiled warmly, her eyes watery. "Thank you."
" He laughed wetly. "
“Great job, Toni! I’ll go inform the other Avengers.”
“You got the little cunt?”
“H-HELLO? IS ANYONE HERE?” Her suit lit up to provide light in the dark floor. The fire was easily extinguished by her foam blasters. Thank goodness the fire didn’t start up to here.

“Now, let’s discuss how we’re going to kill that grape of an alien.”
"W-wait. What about the Arc Reactor?! It might poison him.. Ican'tdothis!" She said rapidly. In the back of her mind, she knew her body had been changing at the knowledge of having Peter live with her. Her breasts felt more tender and needed a larger sized bra. It was like it thought Toni was actually pregnant and was preparing for a baby. In a way, it was. Peter was a little over a
”Yes!”
It was easy to find where Clint was and set up a Quinjet. In minutes, Natasha was ready to go. She didn’t pack anything, knowing that it wasn’t necessary. Barton would come back, knowing he finally had a chance of getting his family back.
God, how she loved this boy. Her little spider.
After she was done with the shampoo, she looked for a shaver and found a sharp objects with a purple cream. Bingo.
”That’s the point, we save people but also kill people. We brought unnecessary damage to hundred of cities. Don’t worry about it though I always got us out of it. It’s my thing to do that.”
Child abuse, Cancer-implication, self hatred, bombing, cursing, spiders
Her thoughts stopped when she felt a tug on her nipple. Toni gasped at the sensation and looked down. It was Peter, suckling to his heart's delight. She couldn't conceal a soft coo at the adorable sight. Her baby son in her arms.
His torturer touched the veins, arteries, and muscles and plucked them like a violin. To his horror, the skin already began to heal.
Peter was struggling in school, having panic attacks and lashing out at teachers and students every day. He was suspended for a month when he punched a boy named Flash Thompson so hard that he slammed into the lockers and bent them. However, Toni couldn’t find herself to be mad. She was worried at Peter’s raw strength.
"Toni, God, I trust you with my life. I always will-"
Like old times, everyone was actually working together in this. They all had one thing in common:
Peter. Oh god, Peter. More recordings passed, and Toni broke more and more. He was her son and she was his mother. Never in her life had she imagined such a thing, but it happened. She remembered how overjoyed and giddy she was when Peter called her Mom for the first time. Tears fell freely from her face as she basked in her old memories.
Thank you so much for reading! Stay awesome!
”Excuse me? Do you know where we are?” The boy tried to keep his voice calm as he asked an old lady he remembered. How could he forget? She had given him churros!
"Amen to that. Let's go, platypus, they're probably waiting for us."
"Love!" "Venom!!??" They each yelled at him. Peter was still whining and, to make things worst, was pursing his lips. Instinctively the baby was looking for a nipple to suckle on, like all mammals do. Toni rocked her adopted son soothingly as she hesitantly unbuttoned her blouse and bra. To her right was Eddie and Venom, radiating support.
Just born into the world, and this boy had already lost everything. Toni looked into the Peter’s beautiful doe eyes. He grabbed onto her nose and giggled.
"The model is fully completed, Boss. 100% Success. I do not sense anything wrong with it. I suggest you go out for a few hours. You haven’t rested in 37 hours. Last time you ate was 23 hours ago.”
"See it wasn't that hard!" Eddie wrapped an arm around Toni's shoulder's, the other on her stomach. "You truly are a great mother. " She put her head on the shorter woman's shoulder as she looked at Peter. The baby looked up at both of them and his eyes lit up with content. He even smiled a bit, spilling some milk on his onesie. Tears started to form in Toni's eyes. Whenever she looked at Peter, a hole in her filled. She thought she didn't have a heart.
No one dared to speak in the room. Except for Toni.
Wade realized what he was going to do. “NO! STOP! PLEASE! PLEASE!”
“Now you know. Lies and doubt corrupted this team and if we are going to move forward, we are going to need to change that. Understood. You are the Avengers, goddammit. You hear me?!” A calphony Of broken yells followed.
(See the end of the chapter for
”Toni, there is still a lot of questions that need to be answered.”
Oh. Oh, he did. Very much so. His father used one of these all the time. On him. On strangers. On his mother. A sickening smile that should never have been on a child's face appeared on his own. He giggled. It was kinda funny. These guys took him away, hurt him, and BROKE him and now they are laughing.
"Yes?" Eddie yelped in surprise as Venom scooped her up bridal style and began to carry her into their bedroom.
Her right hand rose up toward the back of her head. She sliced a portion of hair. She did this around the sides, but left some sections longer than the other. After almost an hour of hacking away at the speed of a snail, Toni was done.
In her Iron Man suit, she lead all the employees and children out of the building. It was an air attack from some Hydra Bombers or some shit. She was too worried on her boys to really care. Her heart soared when she saw Eddie with Wade and Peter on each hand. They were all safe, but Wade looked a little worse for wear. Scratch that, he looked like he needed a hospital. Probably everyone did, they were suffering from shock no doubt. Oh, wait, the paramedics, police, and fire fighters were already there. Man, she really needed to be more aware of her surroundings. Still, she ran over to Eddie and gave all of them a huge hug.
More days passed. Then weeks. Now months.
That's right. Eddie wanted children so badly, and Venom became more and more excited with the idea. They even began talking about baby names, settling on having them named based on how Clintar's do. Venom almost cried on how much Eddie wanted their future kids to have some relation to their home planet.
"It's okay, hon, don't worry. I'm here." He continued to whisper soothing things into her ears as she began to break down. Suddenly, a voice broke her from her millionth spiral.
”Fine. ‘KAY BYE!” With that, Toni summoned her suit with a press of her special bracelet and flew off.
“Are you alright, Starky?” The familiar nickname brought a faint smile to her face. Sitting back up, she looked at Wade. He was pale, his eyes were red, there were bags under his eyes, and he looked like he hadn’t eaten anything for days. An emptiness that Toni wasn’t prepared to see was in his eyes.
Even if Toni attacked them, she would cool down and think things through properly. She was the type of person to react, calm down, and find the best solution. Toni would have still helped Bucky, she knew it wasn't actually his fault. Oh God.
"Auntie, have you seen Pete? We want some revenge after last night!" Carnage said, determination blazing in his crimson eyes. He had flaming red hair that matched his eyes, but most of him resembled his mother. He had her nose, smile, hair type, and other hints. On the other hand, he had a strong jaw and slightly pointier teeth from his father's side. In addition to having more pointy teeth, Carnage was able to become a symbiote himself if he wanted to. It was not uncommon to see Carnage have a lengthened limb get a cookie from a high shelf or become a red animal to scare wade and Peter. He may look scary and act it too, yet the boy was such a sweetheart.
“Alright, Steve.”
Toni chuckled at the their banter. Her heart warmed at the sight of their young love. When she looked over from her spot on the counter, she saw that Wade was giving Peter a noogie. Next to her, Eddie rolled her eyes.
“Toni?”
A weird look came from Steve as he stared at Thor hug Toni and thank her profusely.
She never thought she had maternal instincts, but it turns out that she most certainly did. All that Toni could think of was protect Peter and kill that monster.
Italian Translations:
"Oh gosh. Petey Pie you are going to replace me, " Toni gasped between her bouts of laughter, "I can't handle all of your power!"
No one took it seriously.
”Thor, I’m fine. I better go, you should to. Tomorrow will be filled with... stuff... so...yeah— bye.” Before she could get away, Thor pulled her into a hug. His chest shook as the god started to weep. Hesitantly, Toni wrapped her arms and patted him on the shoulder.
Venom tried to shout. Yes, their other must have gone to prank them or something. She didn't just turn to dust in their arms.
"You're sick? What do you want me to do about it?" The dark eyes of Wade's father bored into him. There was no ounce of sympathy in them.
"You don't know what that thing does!"
AAAAS I HAVE BEEN GONE FOR WAY TOO LONG! Also, OVER TWO THOUSAND HITS???!! Thank you all so much! I’ve never thought I would get anything more than ten hits.
“Sure, why not. The Avengers turned One Direction and split up. We had a fight. Literally. It was over something called The Accords. The thing was meant to put us in check, but I was going to change a shit of things though. We have killed and destroyed thousands of people during our battles. Not to mention to millions of dollars spent of repairing the city.”
The room went quiet. Bruce glared at Steve and dragged them to the elevator.
"Dr. Stark-"
And she definitely wouldn't trust just anyone to be around him. Especially that annoying guy with the eye-patch.
"Don't mention it. Also, you better prepare for all the shopping we're going to do for you." Eddie gave a wicked grin at Toni's shocked expression, "No buts. Alright, see you later nerd!"
"I'm sorry, Eddie. I completely forgot that you would be coming over. It flew over my head completely. This little guy has kept my mind occupied 24/7." She looked at Peter again and rubbed his back soothingly.
”Hang in there, love. Help is on the way.”
*ONE MONTH AGO*
" Colin Donnell's charming voice wafted through their home. Both of them absolutely adored the loving song and swayed to the song. Eddie was decked out in a black cocktail dress and black heels. Her medium length hair was curled beautifully and her eyes could be mistaken for sapphires. She looked amazing and the normally barefaced woman had put on some makeup. Dark red lipstick that were screaming to be kissed, dark eye-shadow to make her eyes pop even more, and other things that Venom didn't know of.
“Wait, what does this have to do with finding Thanos?” There was an army of glares aimed at Rogers. However, Toni just sighed.
“Okay!”
"NO! NO! PETER!!" Toni broke down and began to shake on the dirty ground. Her sobs were loud and heavy and she screamed in agony.
The beeps were few and far between. It just kept getting slower. Until, they stopped. Wade had flatlined. His organs had failed a few days ago.
Carnage was next to Peter, talking about their own adventures. How they would prank Peter or get revenge on him.
Mio figlio...”
Toni smiled sheepishly. "I-I couldn't leave him. But, I still feel like I've made a mistake. I'm a billionare, genius, philanthropist, playgirl, and, not to mention, a
She lead them to an open area where the device was held. A few computers surrounded the area. “Today, we start our test run. We only have two Pym Particles to use. Bruce and I will be monitoring whoever volunteers.”
" Venom wailed and wailed until their voice broke. They looked back at the kitchen and tears fell from their face at the sight. There was a messy pile of dust where Eddie was supposed to be siting. Pure rage filled them. Whoever did this was going to pay in blood. For now, they would just kill anyone in their way.
“Sí, yo estoy...uh...fine!” The boy scrambled from his bed in a hurry. “But, why’s Wade here? I thought he went home?”
“I can try to build a machine that will locate different dimensions. We’ll probably have to go through a multitude of dimensions in order to get to the right one. Once there, Wong can summon a portal for us, and, boom, we got Thanos.” The engineer tried to have a cheeriness in her voice, yet there was still some underlying doubt.
"Yup that's me. What do you want." Toni had a nonchalant expression on her face as she looked at the man in front of her. He had a stern expression on his face and quite the eyepatch. The man chuckled and went to sit next to her.
”Yeah, and Cap knew about it for years. Never even bothers to tell me. Like any person, I was angry and attacked Bucky. It lead into a two on one fight. L-let’s     j-just say I was given the cold shoulder in Siberia.”
"You know what's even better? This idiot has been working her ass off to make you guys legal again. To have you guys back in the tower. All debts paid and crimes forgiven. I didn't want her to do such a thing for
It smelled like lavender and vanilla, much like her own shaving cream at home. The Razer was sharp and left her skin extremely smooth. After she shaved her whole body, she grabbed the another clear object that had a white lotion inside and put that on. She rubbed and rubbed the cream into her skin, rubbing it raw. It felt good though. The engineer felt too dirty after entering Wakanda. Finally, she reached for the last bottle, hopefully conditioner. Then she stopped. The smell.
"AAAHHHH"
"Buh?"
“P-P-Please...”
At the sound of her gasp, they snapped their heads towards her. Getting a closer look, Toni saw with horror that they were stuck. All of them having
Peter, of course, named it himself. It was an album filled with pictures of the mother and son duo. Pictures of them in Disneyland, New York, even Peter’ School. Toni smiled at one where Peter had her red lipstick on and kissed her on the cheek as a prank. The two were smiling in the pictures, Peter having his eyes closed as he tried to stifle his laughter. On his right was Toni, his victim, who also had her eyes closed but had a big smile on her face. Toni made that photo her lock screen and sighed.
”Alrighty, I got several hours before I have to meet with the others. Let’s do this.” Off to work she went.
"Toni! Oh my god!" It was Rhodey. The moment she stepped out of the vehicle, her beloved friend sprinted towards her. Toni followed suit. She ignored the pain and exhaustion she felt and kept running. Soon enough, she was pulled into a familiar embrace and began to shake again. A warm hand rubbed her back as she trembled.
"Of course I would. Who do you think allowed you guys to be taken in by T'Challa? To have Bucky be taken care of without percussions? Those were on my orders." She actually laughed a bit at Steve's utter incompetence.
It only got worse as Wade began to cough up blood. “PETER GO TO THE KITCHEN. THERE SHOULD BE SOME BOWLS. GET THE LARGEST ONE.” Toni grew frantic in trying to get Wade to breathe.
She led them to the kitchen, looking around to make sure Peter was out of sight. Steve looked at her questioningly. “Have a seat, everyone. Any drinks? Brucey, want your usual?”
to miss.
"Mom, Wade is really sick." Her son's voice broke her from her overjoyed stupor. She pulled back and knelt down at Wade's level. Even though she wasn't the kind of doctor Bruce was, she knew her share bit of medical practices. He was pale, trembling, eyes dilated, breathing heavily, and all other signs of sickness.
Dread filled them. With that came the finality that Eddie was gone.
"V-Venom! What's happening!!" Their mind went blank as they saw Eddie's arm turn to dust. It seemed to be disintegrating gradually. Like slow torture. "V. I-I think I'm fading away."
Realizing this, Thor stood up and punched Steve.
It looked better. Her brown, slightly curly hair seemed to glow, as if saying 'thank you' for finally fixing it.
“Wait what! Mary, no, I can’t. P-please th-there has t-to be somebody else. Wh-why me?!” Toni’s face plate had been off for a while now, showing the tears streaming down her face.
“Oh, please! You learned Earth customs pretty quickly!”
"Whatever it takes."
Rhodey smiled at her, seeing how she showed happiness at someone besides himself and Banner. Again, the moment of tranquility was broken by a certain patriot.
(Awww... He’s just like dear old Dad.)
He just didn't want anyone to know that.
"What has happened to her?" Thor asked sullenly. The god was confused by her actions but also concerned. She looked worse than everyone. Dust was on her, she had blood oozing slightly out of her many wounds, there was a worryingly large gash in her torso, and she looked like she would crumble to pieces any second. He knew he had missed out on quite a bit. Probably too much. The atmosphere was too tense, not at all like the familiar one he had grown so used to.
Wade walked in with Venom around his neck. The teen looked pissed off and so did the Symbiote. It took everything he had not to punch everyone.
Quietly, she left her room and headed towards the open dining hall. Her eyes scanned the cabinets until she found a machine that looks like a Keurig. Getting what she presumed was a large mug, Toni waited for the liquid fuel to come.
“HELLO! IS ANYONE THERE?! I’M HERE TO HELP! PLEASE!” Her suit amplified her voice tenfold. Still, it sounded like a whisper because of the roaring flames.
That was when she cried.
"Alrighty! Let's go see some spiders!"
“I....Okay. Just hurry.”
Still, it will be more than worth the many sleepless nights spent for Toni. It was a lot of work, but she had to do it. There was no turning back now.
Wade smiled gratefully and began to ran ahead of the group. Unfortunately, they were caught by an employee. "What are you two rascals doing. Running like that?" A woman with mousy hair asked, smirking.
It hurt. It hurt so much. And it wasn’t stopping.
It was awkward in the dining hall. The breakfast from yesterday stood out in everyone's mind. Still, they were hungry and food was always good. The team sat in the same pairs as yesterday and they even tried to have a conversation.
Toni tossed the pillow on the floor and aggressively wiped her eyes. Tears still streamed down her face and she couldn’t make them stop. She curled into a ball and wrapped her hands around her middle. Her breath was erratic, but she wasn’t hyperventilating anymore. Thank fuck for that.
“And you look as professional as ever, Ms. Potts.”
“I’M COMING, CLINT! JESUS CHRIST.”
Happiness came off of Thor in waves. He looked like a big old puppy. “We will finally get everyone back! I’ll get the rest of my people back, my brother, my friends.” His tone grew quieter. “It was my fault this even happened. My failure caused this, but you have found the solution. I am forever grateful to you, Antonia.”
From the beginning of the day, Eddie and Venom were on edge. There was this tense feeling neither of them could shake off. All that they could do was be on high alert at all times. Eddie couldn't stop shaking her legs or fiddling with his hands. She felt like something was coming.
. His cries were heartbreaking, filled with terror. It was the most saddening thing Toni had ever heard. All she could do was rub Peter's back soothingly and card her fingers through his soft hair. Those were the most efficient ways in calming her young son down.
"Yeah! I says so!"
"Ironman right? Or should I say Toni Stark?"
”Even though all of them were heavily damaged from Obahdia Stane’s attack, they are up and ready now. They just needed more time to charge.”
"I'm doing it for Bucky and Wanda." Steve.
Trembling, Wade took off his mask and reach towards the round object. He pressed the button and a screen shown through. The video started.
Her body out of the way, now Toni can focus on something way more important.
Each of them clicked their ‘watches’ and stood tall. The device around them came to life and powered up. They all looked at one another and remembered,
”And your curse will never be lifted. You don’t deserve happiness after what you’ve done, you monster. It’ll be with you until you die. I hope that will be soon, bitch.”
The engineer chuckled, "Jarvis, call Veddie."
Little did Wade know that this would be the daily routine for years and years to come.
(See the end of the chapter for
Time to fix that.
A knock came from her door.
The boy coughed harshly in his hands. When he looked at them, he sighed, there was blood. Like all the other times.
Voices. Voices were all around him. In his head and surrounding him. God, he was so tired. His head was on fire and felt like it might implode. Wade new he was dying. All he could remember was being in his bed with his true family all around him. They must be so worried.
"Stark?" It was a voice filled with relief, but it only made her blood boil. Of all times, Steve acts concerned and happy to see here?! Her head snapped toward the soldier's direction. Rhodey held her tighter to restrain her, for he knew that Toni wasn't stable. He was careful of her bleeding wounds as he held her.
"Alright, Mommy will stop only because you said so."
“Wade? What are you doing here-“
"Wade, I think we need to talk." Peter leaned away from Wade and looked at the wall.
Her bare room was dark and empty, she didn’t bother to turn the light on. All she could do was sit and stare. It was like her body wasn’t her own. Whatever.
Hello! I hope you all enjoyed it! It was very difficult to write. Next chapter is the training of Wade and about Avengers 1. Please let me know if I should raise the rating. I probably should, but there won't be chapters this horrible in a while.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Is that a dog, cat, and... spider?" She gasped in mock shock. "Well, Pete. I can't decipher what this means! Oh no!" With that, she began to tickle and kiss Peter all over. The young boy squealed and try to get away.
The second Toni stepped out of her room, she was dragged by the arm by Pepper. She could already see Happy waiting for her with a smug smile.
“Antonia Stark, it’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Steve Rogers.” Captain America stood before her and shook her hand first. The old fashioned man was a bit surprised to see such a small woman have such a strong grip.
Most of the time, Bruce would avoid summoning the Hulk at all costs. This was not one of those times. He didn’t know much about what happened, Rhodey was reluctant to rely the details without Toni’s permission and Toni avoided it all together. Now seeing it on camera, Bruce had to clench his fist so tightly his knuckles turned white. The scientist was fully aware that Rogers was not the man everyone saw him as. As he saw his traitorous actions, Bruce just shook his head, ignoring the fact that he was turning green. Maybe he could give Captain America a few good punches.
Riposa la testa vicino al mio cuore
The engineer's breaths turned frantic. Everyone around her was dying and there was nothing she could do to stop it. When she turned towards Quill, Toni's eyes filled with tears as she say his body begin to disintegrate. "S-safe travels, Q-quill." She tried to add some humor to her heavy tone. Said man looked at her, distraught.
"Toni. Truth. Don't make me get Venom, he is getting really excited..."
“Oh, there is! I know I can’t do anything to you right now. But I swear that I will not hesitate to put a bullet in your head if you do anything to Toni. This mission is the only thing preventing me from unaliving you this very second.”
"Oi, Tones, quit trying to blow up the teachers with your stare." Eddie's voice interrupted her thoughts.
“Is testing ready, Toni?”
"Oh, thank god you're all okay."
Each of them were stick figures and different colors. Toni was red, Peter was blue, Eddie was gold, Venom was black, Carnage was orange, Pepper was brown, Happy was grey, Rhodey was green, Jarvis was pink (He was a small happy face in the air), the dog was purple, the cat was magenta, the spider was also black, and Wade was basically a rainbow of colors. Her heart warmed when she saw the arrow pointing at her, Eddie, and Venom that said: 'MOMMY', 'AUNTIE EEDEE', and 'UNCLE VEN'. It was truly adorable. However, the animals made her raise an eyebrow.
Richard had one through his torso, May had on through her chest, Ben had one through his neck, and Mary had one through her left arm. Ben was already dead. The sound of Richard’s raspy voice broke her trance like state.
"Pewer, whu are yoo doin'?" She got a small shrug in return. Peter immediately stopped when he heard a yell somewhere. Quickly, Peter ran behind another couch, giggling like a maniac.
They didn't understand. Where did their other go? Eddie never left them alone. Every second of every day, they were together. Inseparable. But here Venom was, alone and without their beautiful Eddie. Venom felt an enormous hole form inside them. Without Eddie, they were nothing. Hell, Venom had already shrunk themselves down to cope with the lost of their host. No. Not lost. Eddie couldn't be gone.
A shiver ran down her spine. He gestured for everyone to sit at the table. Begrudgingly, Toni sat down at the farthest end of the table. Peter stood at her side.
"Uh-Uh... Sorry! We got too excited. This place is so incredible after all!" Peter gave his best smile at the stout woman. She just laughed and ruffled his hair.
left. In the present, she didn't give a shit about what they had done to her. What
“ON IT.” Peter yelled back.
“Follow me.”
“It’s the EPR paradox. Instead of pushing Lang through time, you wound up pushing time through Lang. It’s dangerous. I should have been there to warn you against it. Sorry.” The genius shrugged her shoulders and walked over to the monitor. She typed some new sequence in and in a flash, Lang was back.
“Good. Is he even alive?”
"Sorry? You should say sorry to Jeffrey. I'm actually proud of that prank you pulled. I should have thought of that sooner!" Wade crossed his arms, bag still in hand.
Baby mine, don't you cry
Enjoy!!
Toni only raised her eyebrow in response. "And?"
“Barton. That is enough. You,” he gestured at Peter, “control yourself. That’s an order.”
“You got it, Cap’n!”
She ran in front of her son and wrapped him in her arms. Peter began to whimper and cry from the scare.
“Yeah, Nat?”
Oh, god. No.
Toni couldn't provide an answer. Nobody had a single clue of what they were going to do. It was going to be impossible. No matter what, she couldn't let Wade's face grow any more grave. "I'm not sure, but, in the end, we will win. We'll bring everyone back. Even Peter." She squeezed his hand.
“Before we start this meeting, I need the Avengers to come with me. Guardians, please stay here for a bit.” Rhodey’s voice immediately boomed throughout the halls. The robot and raccoon only nodded and went to go get some food or test out some weapons.
Something in him told him to snap his wrist at Steve. And he did.
Over the weeks she spent waiting for Peter to come, Toni went full mother hen mode. The woman panicked over which diaper would be safer or what high chairs would be more comfortable. Eventually, she got so worried that she decided that she was going to make everything herself. Only the articles of clothing were safe because they were all gifts from her friends. Granted, she didn't really have that many friends, but Rhodey, Happy, Pepper, and Eddie were more than enough. They really went all out for Peter, specifically Eddie.
The next day they set out for the fair. A cold wind had blown through them as they’d opened the front door, so they’d both wrapped up in their parkas, scarves, and a cute frog beanie that had been a gift from Rhodey for Peter.
“You used to whine about being a short stack, now you’re a tall, blond Adonis - Stark’s words, not mine - and you’re still whining. Shut your yap, and stick your ass out for the camera.”
As he got close to the pen, several of the fauns came to the forefront, leaning on the fencing to better show off their assets. Stíofán could see several pairs of fine furred legs, flashing beneath fine silks, and finely polished hooves and horns. They were all very fine, Stíofán thought. If these were the ones the Stables rejected, he couldn’t imagine what the higher-level ones looked like. Some of the more brazen ones wagged their tails, making it clear they were ready to mate, and Stíofán was forced to breathe through his mouth to keep the desire from shooting south.
“What was that? Down?” He pretended to drop him again, making Tony smack his shoulder.
“You do,” Steve disagreed. “You light up, like a flame, but from the inside. It’s hard to explain.”
“I’m sorry, did I imagine the bullet I dug out of your thigh last year?”
“Why would I be meeting with the dean?”
Tony gave him a smile but didn’t say anything. He appreciated people were always trying to make him feel better, but like he’d said to Rhodey, it was easy when you were already disgustingly happy.
“Peter off there!”
“So Sam told me that maybe we got off on the wrong foot. I’m a bit of a hothead, so I’m sorry I went off on you before you could explain.”
“Tony what-”
He waved over to his deputies, and Barnes and Wilson wandered over. “Everything alright Sheriff?”
“I appreciate you throwing me under the carriage, Mr Rogers,” Sam said cheekily, giving Steve a look that said he wasn’t buying it for a second.
She tutted, led him to the porch, and let him sit down. “You’ve had a bit of a shock, I suspect.” She raised an eyebrow. “And I bet that dunce of a deputy just sent you out here without thought for what you’d be feeling.” She huffed out a breath. “Some alphas, honestly.”
The storage attic was pretty basic. There was an old double bed with an elaborate metal frame, a small table and two chairs, a stool he could use as a bedside table, a little inner stairwell down to an outdoor sink and toilet, and a large old tub that Tony could fill and heat with magic for washing.
No, no, no.
Oh for--
Tony watched curiously as Rhodey walked to the door, unlocking it and letting in— oh! The guy from yesterday, the one who had stormed off when Tony had helped him out. Tony could feel the scowl spreading over his face as the man stepped inside.
The bouncer came in from outside at the bartender’s gesture and grabbed the man by the arm. “Take him down to the station, cops can lock him up.” He turned to Steve. “Thanks. Next round’s on the house.”
Wilson quirked a brow at the size of the portion but thankfully said nothing.
“I can take this,” Steve said and walked over to show Peter how to tell Dodger to drop the ball and what hand gesture to make with the command. When it worked, Peter’s eyes were round.
Antonius sipped his wine with a nod. “Seems like a busy life. You must love being a gladiator.”
“Would you have snuck me upstairs, babe?” Pops asked, bumping Dad’s shoulder.
Steve shook his head. “No. Bucky needed help, it didn’t feel right to leave him. I, uh— I’m an artist now, properly I mean. I haven’t made it big yet but I’m getting pieces displayed in some of the better galleries, doing some commercial work on the side. Just like you said I should.”
“Thanks, Sam.”
His face was hot with shame, and he twisted the end of his tunic in his hands. “I -” His eyes burned and suddenly he couldn’t be standing here, in front of this man. “Please excuse me.” It came out near a sob, but he didn’t wait to see the alpha’s reaction. He took off to the bedroom, closing the door tight behind him.
Tony felt the bottom drop out of his stomach. Pepper!
T’Challa grinned wide. “And miss our favourite twins’ going away party? Never!”
“Um hi,” Steve said with a small wave. He was wearing a warm-looking cardigan, well-fitting jeans, and a thick pair of glasses. He looked, well, he looked nice. And seeing him not scowling at Tony reminded him of how cute he’d thought Steve was when they met.
“No. We’re not pushing the launch back any further. We’ve announced on the website, we’ve booked the hotel, we’re not getting our deposit back. I’ll make it happen, you just make sure the line is ready, got it?”
What should he say? Was it better to lie, lest they think him undefended, or would the truth make them leave?
“Wait, what’s that sound?”
Tony wasn’t allowed a pistol yet, or to do any of the tricks he’d seen in shows back east, much to his displeasure and the Sheriff’s obvious amusement, but he was taught how to keep a gun maintained, how to shoot, and how to keep from hurting himself when the gun recoiled after one pulled the trigger.
“Where did it come from?” Tony asked, taking the carrier and looking inside. A familiar pair of blue eyes peeked out from amongst white fur, and underneath a fuzzy tail, he could see the glint of a red Stark prosthetic. “Alpine!”
Steve flapped a hand, waving it off. He made a gesture that was so clearly,
Steve looked at Tony, and Tony for a moment felt a prick of shame. He had been improper, even if the situation warranted it. “You took it off out here?”
“I knew that damn airship was nothing but trouble,” Phillips grumbled. “What’s wrong with a sensible plane or a damn truck?”
“Because Sheriff, and this may shock you, sometimes an omega doesn’t want their alpha solving every little problem as though they can’t themselves. He’s a letch, and I was dealing with it, but now he knows that if his wandering hands get anywhere near me and mine, he’d better be expecting a fight.”
“Hardened is right,” Steve muttered and Tony laughed.
“Thankfully only a little harm done,” Tony told him kindly. “But since there has been a little harm, perhaps I could persuade you to rest up?”
The alpha cleared his throat. “This is a little strange.”
There was a hot angry fire in his chest, and Steve could barely speak. “Why didn’t you say anything?”
“Well, there was no need for that!” Jarvis hissed, fur standing on end. “Of all the rude, insufferable-”
“I love you,” the doe said again and Stíofán knew he would never tire of it. “But if you do not finish what you started, you’ll sleep alone on the hard floor tonight!”
“Sure. Might take time to get people to trust it, but you just need a few customers to get you started and spread it through word of mouth.”
Tony blinked. “I can’t believe it. You’re Cap. That guy kicks ass!”
Tony had sounded...incredulous.
He raised his sword, slashing it against the buck’s arm, dodging a return strike. He could smell the fight on him, the satyr was not going down without a fight. Ivor was large and Stíofán could use that to his advantage. The next time Ivor went for him, he dashed to the side, jumping up to wrap his arms around the other satyr’s neck. He let himself go limp, his weight dragging the other down to the ground, with a heavy thud.
Alright that was enough. “Let’s leave it there, Mr. Bullski. Tony, Peter, let's go.”
With each jerk, Tiny tightened around him, winding him higher and higher until he shoved in deep spending himself inside. He shuddered through it. “I love you,” he said, unable to help it, and Tony stiffened.
Whatever alphas wanted in an omega, he wasn’t it, and he’d learned to accept that.
“This is Alpine.” Bucky held up a carrier where a white ball of fluff meowed pitifully. “I was hoping you might be able to help her out.”
Deciding he was tired of being on the back foot, he stepped forward, wrapping an arm around Tony’s waist to pull him close, and pressing their lips together.
“OK Tony,” he managed, offering a smile, and Tony winked, leaving him with John.
“Thank you ma’am,” Steve said, taking the gravy boat from her and pouring a generous portion.
“It’s irrational though. I know that. And the spider thing - turns out it’s only this one rare spider that’s bad, and it’s not even American. It hopped a ride in my bag on one of my overseas business trips. So all and all, just bad luck. But I can’t help but see things and worry, you know? What if he gets abducted, or falls down a loose grating or gets sucked up by a street sweeper?!” He looked at Steve who was very kindly trying not to look at him like he was ridiculous. “And it doesn’t help that he’s so adventurous, running this way and that before I can even check it’s safe. It’s...well, I’m glad my drama isn’t making him more nervous but also it would help me a lot if he’d stay in one place just one time.”
reason to - and instead of speaking to me about it, took it upon himself to wrench him by the ear till he cried. So I did what was necessary.”
“You’re home! I knew you’d come home, my baby,” his ma sobbed hugging him tight.
He raised an eyebrow. “Is that how you want to start this?”
“I can do this all day.”
It felt all the more foolish now that he’d walked so far to escape Mr Stark and his kindness and charm. If Steve didn’t already know he was an incredibly unattractive match, Mr Stark’s expression at seeing him weak and sickly would no doubt do the trick. Steve was under no illusions that Mr Stark would ever want him.
Neither he nor Barnes was as good as Steve at hiding their reactions, but politeness was clearly ingrained, as both their faces smoothed out quickly.
He huffed. Just his luck.
Big thank you to Elwen who has gone above and beyond and made this fic what it is 💖💖💖
Because he had to look a mess. He’d planned to clean up before his husband got home, but his hair was sticking to his forehead, and he was hot and sweaty from the heat of the stove. His trouser cuffs were covered in mud, his tunic dusted with flour, meat juice, and starch, and he wasn’t wearing a lick of makeup.
Maria followed J.J out to the truck, pulling open the passenger side and getting in.
He went to Fury in the morning, determined to get it done, in case Tony tried to change his mind. He could be very determined when he wanted to be.
“Remember our deal,” the
“Maybe we might start with kissing? See if we can manage that?”
“Stíofán, please,” the doe whispered. “I have been ready since you fondled me over dinner!
“Remember I mentioned my grandpa? I guess we forgot to exchange last names or you would’ve clocked it pretty fast. I’m Tony Stark.”
Tony frowned. “You
He was twitchy. The itch to get home getting stronger with every passing minute. He was close - once this was dealt with they were only a few hours’ ride.
“Thank you!” Scott said, a wide grin spreading over his face. “You just saved us like a thousand bucks. How can we thank you?”
Thankfully Edwin chose that moment to return with dessert, and the awkward moment passed without further discussion, which Steve was grateful for. He tucked into his dessert, the taste instantly reminding him of sitting around a small table with Gabe, Bucky and Dum Dum, fighting over the extra custard and trying desperately not to spill food on the embroidered tablecloth of the nice yorkshire woman they were staying with, and whose manner suggested to Steve that ruining her things would lead to immediate eviction.
He’d seen Ana do this. It couldn’t be that difficult. He placed the bristles on the floor and swung the handle to brush against the wood. He began to sweep, the dirt and dust collecting in little piles. He gathered it all into the kitchen before he deftly swept it out the front door and out into the garden.
“Thanks Doc.”
As he was carefully placed on the horse, Mr Stark sliding onto the saddle behind him and tugging him back against his chest, an arm around his waist, Steve couldn’t help wishing it were different.
“It’s ok. It’s ok,” he murmured, stroking a hand through the dark hair. “I’m here. I’m sorry I went away, but I'm back now. It’s ok.”
Tony noticed his interest and rolled his eyes. “I thought you said we had to hurry,
Tony’s jaw dropped. “Oh my god! I didn’t know you guys were trying to adopt.”
“How have you been settling in?” Natasha asked coaxingly.
“Tony.” Steve tugged at his hand with a wide grin on his face. “Just come here.”
“Steve, this is—“ Tony hugged it to his chest. “This is going in the workshop where I can look at it every day. And Jarvis is making a copy so he can make it my screensaver. And my phone background. Maybe I could even get a tattoo, you know I bet it would look great as a tramp stamp.” Steve choked on his own spit, and Tony gave him a soft smile. “This is the best thing I’ve ever gotten. Thank you.”
Tony sighed in relief. Saved by the whistle.
He could feel Steve’s cock through the thin breeches he wore and moved his hips invitingly until it coaxed a hearty groan.
He was just...so alone.
Tony was pretty sure they were lying, but whatever.
“Yes! Please!”
He put the keys in the ignition and started the car. He turned and looked out the back window to reverse, and Maria looked up at the living room window, the light inside a bright contrast to the evening dark.
“No, no problem, I just-” The alpha seemed embarrassed, taking off his hat and holding it to his chest. “I’m Sheriff Steve Rogers. I think you’ve been waiting for me.”
They’d tracked the men they were chasing to a campsite on the other side of the ridge and were preparing for an ambush.
Steve nodded, taking off down the street at a run. He didn’t stop till he reached the house, not caring a whit about the dirt coming off him, and he knocked on the door. Mrs Banner answered the door, her face taking on a sympathetic look as she saw who it was. “Sheriff.”
Hodge.
Sam gave him a knowing look. “I’ve been where you are. Don’t let it get you down. It’ll happen when you least expect, and it’ll be perfect, no matter what.”
Tony drew himself up, like a bird ruffling its feathers, and got in Steve’s face. “And if that is not diplomatic enough for you then perhaps next time I’ll just let whoever it is just strike our child, is that what you’d prefer?”
Steve took the basket and peered inside. “Wow, there’s a lot here.”
The door opened and Tony slunk in cautiously. “How are we doing?”
Stíofán cleared his throat. “Hi.”
He’d been on his best behaviour, trying to flirt a little to encourage donations.
“Great,” Tony sighed as the backup generator kicked in, bathing the room in a greenish glow. “JARVIS needs twelve minutes to reboot.”
“Yeah, he wanted… well he wanted me to follow in his footsteps, all the while resenting me for being smarter than he was. It was..tough. Then, when my mom passed away, we had nothing keeping us together. I wanted to do something else. And Jay,-“ he looked up to meet Steve’s eyes, “he was our butler, but he loves me like I’m his kid. He’s always been an amateur collector of books. He loves them, and he showed that to me. He wanted to pass on the passion.” He grinned gesturing to the shop. “It worked. So I sold my company shares and bought this place.”
He went by the healer to get some of the ginger, making sure to fetch some more meat from the trader. Tony would need his strength when he felt better.
He was cut off by the arrival of Mrs Aberforth, a widow herself and one who had long thought herself the next Mrs Stark, despite it being well known Tony had no interest. She claimed him for a dance, and unable to say no without causing offence, all he could do was give Mr Rogers an apologetic smile as he was tugged away. He longed to know the end of the sentence, even though his heart feared what it might be.
He could imagine doing this. Coming every week, watching Tony dance around the room charming people, and then settling in to sit on Steve’s lap, wrapped in his arms while they talked to the residents - a tabby leapt up onto Steve’s lap and he smiled - looking after the cats. Being introduced as
“I’m tired of waiting.”
Tony snorted. “Exactly!
“I’m going to charge in there and beat Hodge to a pulp.”
Tony chewed on the root, the colour slowly coming back to his face and he held out his arms for the kids. “Come here, my babies.”
allows it, but Fury says happy gladiators have more to fight for. Put on a better show.”
“Right. Okay.”
There was something of an afternoon rush, and at one point Steve thought he should go. He didn’t work here and he was just in the way. And really, getting a room sooner rather than later would be sensible.
“Maybe at dinner?”
“As much as you like,” Steve agreed. “I like the way you taste.”
Tony unpacked all he was able to and freshened up using the jug and basin he found in the room. By the time he was done, the sun was starting to dip, and he emerged into the main room to find the Sheriff heating something delicious smelling on the stove.
“Sorry!” The alpha blurted, sounding flustered. “I was running late, and I completely lost my wits. I was so focused on getting to you, I just did my job without it even occurring to me that you might be the omega I was looking for.” He chuckled, his face flushing red and holding out his hand. “It’s nice to meet you.”
“Boss? We have a problem.”
“Yeah!”
“Yes. My Sire’s gone to Washington on business, and my Dame went with him to visit a friend of hers. They’ll be gone a few days, so it’s now or never.”
“Or we could solve this whole problem and get her a nice, new mattress.”
He was in love. He couldn’t deny it.
“Yeah, he’s always talking about what’ll happen when he meets them. Doesn’t take well to people making fun of it.”
It looked like college wouldn’t be so tough after all.
Tony humphed, looking irked, until Stíofán gave his thigh a pat. “Shall we?”
“Maybe that would be ok,” Tony said, still sounding a little unsure. “And you’d come get us if he needed us?”
to take up a post as your gladiator trainer.”
Also, they have a bunch more because Tony always forgets how much he hates morning sickness until it's too late because the kids are too cute.
“You will.”
All hell broke loose, the gang going for him and Rogers swinging desperately. Tony couldn’t do nothing — the guy would get beaten to a pulp. “Hey! Quit it!”
Bucky propped his arms up on his hips as he looked him up and down. “You got a camera?”
Rhodey looked at him. “That’s ok. We’re fine but thanks kid.”
“Yeah?” Tony took his bowl, placing it on the table beside them. “Do you want Papa to read a little more or are you ready for bed?”
The voice was almost familiar. But that must be the adrenaline talking. Because there was no way it could be who it sounded like.
He got to his hooves, wetting the rag once more and offering it to the doe who looked up at him with those dark eyes. “Clean yourself. I’ll fetch our meal.”
“First, you clearly didn't dig far enough into the internet because I just like pretty people, alpha or omega, so that's not a problem. And second, turns out bench-pressing buses turns me on, who knew?”
“How did you and Rhodey meet?”
Tony wiped the sweat from his brow. “It should work now. Better actually.”
“I know, and it’s not guilt, exactly, just - when our pup was sick I realised the most important thing was spending time with my family. And I want more time for that.”
Tony fell asleep on his chest almost as soon as they were horizontal, and Steve wasn’t far behind - even the worry that he might awake to find Tony shivering with his skin aflame unable to resist the pull of sleep. He nuzzled his face into Tony’s hair and drifted off, praying for good news come morning.
Was he supposed to do something? Should he initiate in some way?
The number of dating apps strictly for unbonded wanting to meet was pretty low, though Tony was a member of all the main ones.
And there, gathering berries with a group of satyrs, was a faun with Stíofán’s colouring. She looked up and their eyes met across the field. Stíofán raised his hand in greeting and her hands came up to cover her mouth. He could see the faintest shine of tears, but even before he’d finished realising that fact, she was rushing through the long grass towards him.
Steve didn’t know what he was going to say, but whatever it was, was lost in the sudden sound of helicopter blades. His head shot up, the noise reaching his ears first and the others gave him an odd look before the chopper got close enough that they could hear it too.
Natasha raised an eyebrow. “How is that my fault?”
“I figured as much. I doubted they’d let you fool around with bucks at the Stable, am I right?”
“Soldier? Oh, you mean Bucky?”
“Awww Carol, it wasn’t my fault, the guy--”
“Exactly. Alright, grab your backpack and let’s hit the streets.”
Steve wiggled his eyebrows and Tony’s jaw dropped. “Oh my god. I can’t believe history thought you were some naive virgin.”
He turned Antonius around, so they were chest to back, his hand drifting down to the edge of the shift. “I want to do everything to you, but for now, I need to be in you.”
“Yeah, he does.” Sam took a sip of his beer. “Don’t get me wrong, he’s not a total asshole.  It's usually for a good reason. Steve’s pretty big on fairness, so I imagine that guy was hassling some woman out with her friends, or said something bigoted, or, in this case, since he’s going easy on them, they probably just said shit about soulmates.”
“Very much so,” Stíofán rasped, and he tugged gently at the silks. “I’ll be even more pleased when I can see beneath these.”
“Anthony,” the sheriff, shuffling awkwardly to the side as Tony brushed past him, nose in the air.
His hand drifted up to touch without thought, and he snatched it back before Steve’s head popped free of his clothes.
And Tony.
He rubbed his thumbs over the line where skin met fur, brushing over the whorls there.
At one point another dog had wandered over to meet Dodger. Steve had gotten Peter to ask the owner and then shown him the best way to approach the pug and pet him carefully. Which, alright it was a tad annoying that Peter remembered his rules when it wasn’t his dad telling him, but still, it got the job done so Tony wasn’t complaining.
“Of course,” Tiberius leered, sliding over to leave space beside him. “Such a lovely creature is always welcome.”
Tony nodded, then channeling the magic through him launched the broom into the air and shot off.
Steve was hit by another squall, the wind making him slip until he was left gripping tightly to the very end. Tony could see the strain in his arms, and he swooped in, making another go for Steve’s hand.
Sure enough, the guy bounced back up, tangled in some sort of netting and still screaming his head off as he rose through the air on a cable, out of sight. Tony stared, his brain not really processing the situation properly.
S’Teve’s thumb rubbed circles over his hipbone as he touched their foreheads together. “I believe that would be logical.”
Tony wasn’t a genius for nothing. It was obvious to him why. If Steve were here, he would’ve already noticed Tony was out of sorts. But Steve wasn’t here, and he was just going to have to get used to his absence.
He was still lost in his thoughts when he heard a shout and a crash.
Tony stormed over as the worry and panic melted away leaving only anger, reaching out to tap the man on the shoulder with slightly too much force.
“It’s ok,” Tony told him, patting down the fur. “Life just moves a little faster here I guess. We’ll get used to it.”
“I’m sorry that happened to you,” Stíofán said, placing his hand over Tony’s, and the doe gave him a weak smile.
Tony blinked, seemingly speechless.
“J.J Nana’s on the phone! He’s coming. I’ll talk to you later nana, and I’ll send you photos ASAP.”
“Pet prosthetics? That’s a bit weird isn’t it?”
When he got closer though, he felt his stomach drop and his body tighten in panic as he caught sight of Steve lying on the ground, with a truly distressing amount of blood spilling over his belly.
He darted off into the house, letting Tony take in the space properly. He wandered over to the herb garden, pleased by the range. He saw one plant getting a little limp, so he muttered a favourite spell of his mother’s to make it perk up.
“Have you read that book by Dr Reed Richards, the one about space?” Steve asked. “I prefer novels myself, but I picked up a copy last time I was in San Francisco: interesting stuff.”
He handed over the parcel, which Tony accepted with genuine pleasure. “You and your omega are most kind. Thank you.”
The Colonel waved him over. “Come see. That damn flying ship they got down at port is losing its mind.”
“Out! Gods you two are driving me crazy!” A voice yelled and Stíofán hid his smile. Any moment now…
But he’d set this up awhile back, and the guy was still hot in a kind of dickish way so he hadn’t seen the harm. He was definitely regretting it now.
“I got mine too,” J.J said, sliding an envelope over. “I got it a few days ago, but I wanted to wait till Riri got hers. Didn’t want it to be awkward.”
“You can name him. He’s a fox terrier, or close enough, so at least he’ll stay small.”
With the help of Friday, the blueprints of the machine were downloaded into her personal lab. Toni worked for the rest of the night, making sure every single particle was perfect.
“First.”
"Tones, you always act like you are an unfeeling person, but it's so easy to see how much you care. Who was the person that randomly started paying for my rent and bills when I was at my lowest? When V-Venom was g-gone and I couldn't do anything but sob in bed? Who was that? It was you Toni. You may not believe it, but you have the biggest heart I have ever seen. No doubt about it. You'll be one hell of a mother Stark, and so will I. We'll be on this journey together, you here me?"
“Well, at least it works. Maybe we can go back in time and go see Thanos when he was a baby.” The others looked at Rhodey in confusion. Toni facepalmed.
“What is it, girl?”
”Alright, activate thrusters.”
“Yup. What about you Pointbreak? Something bugging you?” She tried to add her usual snark to her voice, failing miserably.
The Oscorp building stood tall in front of the group. Gasps of awe and wonder could be heard. It truly was an incredible building. However, it held many tragedies that often went unheard. Toni lost count of the accidents and deaths that occurred there. To say she was a bit frustrated at the school for sending
“You don’t give me orders. I only listen to Iron Man. Not you.” Peter purposely didn’t address Steve as ‘sir’. He knew how much the man was used to being called such titles.
Author’s mental health has been horrible as well. I can only apologize again for the wait and how bad this chapter is.
THIS HURT MY HEART TO WRITE BUT I HAD TO DO IT. Yes, it was Weapon X that stole Wade. They were getting paid by someone after all.
“Yes, Dr. Stark.”
"This again? I thought you've passed on from that! How many times can I say how sorry I am."
"Oh, really? You took out my Arc reactor! Y-you... YOU BROKE MY HEART." Silence. She let it out.
"Don't you even speak about him, Steve."
”Thank god you’re here. He’s been crying all morning.” The tired voice of the owner interrupted Toni’s thoughts. She was a tall woman with dirty blonde hair and turquoise eyes with slight bags under them.
“Alright.”
Her once soft and somewhat done hair was knotted and looked worse than a rats nest. The sun-tanned skin the  Italian-Hispanic woman had was a sickly pale color. From being in space with barely any food and water also took a toll on her body. Her cheeks were a bit hollowed out, her arms had lost some muscle mass, her legs were gangly and weak, and she just looked all around terrible. That wouldn't do.
“Toni? Hon, you there?” Rhodey.
We also get to see a certain spider in a stone.
Baby mine, dry your eyes
”Shut it, Cap. You should damn-well know why we’re here. We got the message from Toni and these ladies,” he gestured toward Shuri and Okoye, ”helped us get here as soon as possible.” He never sounded so serious.
“But Fury never said you have a-“
“Have trouble getting ready today, Toni?”
The crazed man took Wade from the young woman and brought him to his lab. His other assistants greeted him respectfully. He placed Wade on a metal table and attached wires and tubes to him.
A cough caught everyone's attention. Toni still stood in the same plave, but was looking at the group with steely eyes. On her face was her trademark smirk, and she walked to the head of the table where Rhodey and Steve where. They were on opposite sides, fitting.
"You're going to be alright."
Toni snapped out of it when she heard the blood curdling scream of Mary as she pushed with all her might. Automatically, Toni had the child in her arms. A soft cry broke out from the small baby.
What she saw was the stuff of nightmares. There was a fire that seemed to be more than one color. People were screaming and running for their lives.
He eventually convinced his mom that he would be alright. It took way to long. Still, Peter knew how Ma was towards him. Besides, he really needed the comfort. What happened at Oscorp was forever ingrained in his mind. Burning buildings. Pieces of debris. Screams and blood. Wade’s cries.
"It seems that you have the qualities of a good member of a team I'm forming."
All that Thor did was look disappointedly at her and shake his head. Lucky for her, his anger was more focused on their supposed ‘leader’.  Said leader was trembling slightly.
”Yes, Mamá.”
After a few minutes passed, Nebula landed and began to exit the ship. She nodded at Toni to follow, which she did. Her body felt like it was working on autopilot. Only doing what is absolutely needed to keep her alive. If she thought about it, she wished that her body would just stop it's efforts in keeping her alive. She was tired of it all. What difference would it make if she died? Probably, nothing.
Oh, how Wade wished the Boxes were right. When he opened the door, his eyes widened in horror. There was a red and blue light coming from his room. No, it was completely impossible.
“I’ll go! I’ve gone through the quantum realm before!” Scott excitedly said. “How far will I be traveling?”
Easily, she lifted the man over her shoulder.
I’m planning to make this part of a collection! I’ll be doing writing prompts on Female Tony Stark’s or anything marvel related. Thank you so much for reading!!
He wondered why he did have it.
He walked away when she let him go and she flipped him off as he turned back at her. She then saw him get into a helicarrier that was apparently waiting for him and sped away. No one saw the event. Accept for her.
”Please Stay. W-Wade.” The smaller boy began to cry. All this stress was too much for him to handle. Toni was quick to wrap an arm around him.
All of the Avengers and Guardians looked panicked at a baby on the ground. Around the child was the suit Toni had made. Looking at Bruce, she sighed as he was trying to settle down Rogers. Rocket, Wade, Venom, Thor, and Rhodey were trying to hide their laughter.
Dad moved away to let Pops hug her and he lifted her off the ground like he used to when she was small. She felt suddenly younger, like a little kid and she just wanted them to stay.
“The magic might need refreshing from time to time, so I’ll make sure I do upkeep though. Don’t worry.”
“That’s the hope.” Sam agreed, though the little pleased smile told Steve he’d appreciated the confidence. His expression went soft. “I find myself anticipating their arrival a little more everyday.” He seemed lost in thought for a moment, but eventually put his foot into the stirrup and mounted in a smooth movement. “Now get on the horse and let’s go. Phillips’ guys said they’ll handle the prisoners.”
Stíofán lowered them down onto their pallet, covering him carefully, his arms holding him up. Tony kept kissing him, slipping his hands under his shift and tugging at the
Steve must have noticed and snorted. “Don’t worry. We have it all planned out. My neighbour has a small patch of land he’s willing to sell to me when the time comes. Ma’ll have her own cottage.”
“And if I stay, I’ll end up married to one of the Stones, or the Stanes or any of the other awful, vacuous families in this neighbourhood. The eldest Stane, he’s twice my age for lord's sake. And he’s been...giving me
“Only an idiot would care about that shit,” Maybe-George huffed and Tony snorted.
The cheering was beginning to outweigh the angry shouts and Stíofán felt a boost of confidence. The two fighters circled him, and Stíofán parried one’s sword strikes, while he fended off the other with the shield. The other satyr caught him off guard with a wild jab, and for a moment Stíofán thought he might strike a lucky blow. But it glanced off his armour, slipping free. In the moment before the other gladiator could lift his again, Stíofán used the handle of his sword against his head, knocking him out deftly.
He didn’t wait for Tony to say anything, just moved past him, even though it felt like he was being torn in half. Cap was needed, so it looked like he’d be leaving Steve Rogers back here in Cedar Grove.
“It’s great,” Tony said, and it was. I mean flying was no big deal, but the mechanics of this thing were fascinating. His magic reached for it, feeling it out, and Tony could sense every thrum of its engine. “Imagine how long they take to build.”
Steve was suddenly acutely aware of the fact they were in his room alone. He licked his lips. “I’d like that.”
Tony winced. “Yes, I know. I know our first night was a disappointment to you, but I really think now I can do better.”
According to Sam, the whole thing had made him terrible company.
Tony raised a brow, looking bored. “Really, that’s all you’ve got? I’ll never work in this town again? Trust me when I say that doesn’t exactly leave me shaking in my Valentinos. You’re a dinosaur, Bradbury, and you wouldn’t even have bothered to come here if you didn’t need to buy respectability.” He looked at the shocked-looking omega. “No disrespect, of course, to the lady.”
He shot a look at the town clock, the big hand ticking past the hour. He couldn’t believe he was running late.
The front door to the apartment opened and her Pops stepped inside.
Tony finished up a meeting with a potential investor in a good mood.
Peter fell silent very quickly. “That’s what I thought. Now, you behave yourself while I see what has befallen Mr Rogers.”
“I’m afraid vacation’s over. We have a situation that requires your...unique skills.”
“Ew Dad, you’re kissing!”
Tony focused on breathing and glared at Stíofán. “
“Are these happy tears or sad ones?” He asked, his tone light, but Stíofán could see it was a serious question.
“What -“ He stumbled at another tremor, only saved from falling by the tight grip Steve suddenly had on his arm. The terracotta pot wobbled dangerously and Tony yelped as he dove forward and wrapped his arms around it, holding it steady. “What the actual
Miss Foster shook her head. “You wouldn’t have. We live out on a farm with our uncle, Dr Selvig, so we only come to town once a month or so for supplies and socialising.”
“Hey!” Her dad grumbled, but he leaned into Pops as they stepped out into the hall. They gave her a final kiss each and then headed off towards the stairs.
“Enough about that though. How about we eat?”
“I’m sorry-”
“Dad’s freaking out,” she admitted. “In a very Dad way. He keeps jumping between impulse buying everything marked ‘for college students’ to getting all misty-eyed when he looks at our baby photos.”
Stíofán didn’t like the sound of that. What if Antonius started eying up other Bucks in the yard? Seducing them with his doe eyes and soft curls, and well-trimmed beard.
It was a little awkward at first, but eventually, they got into a rhythm. Tony would build his broom, Steve would work on his motorbike. They’d talk, listen to music. Sometimes Tony would stay for dinner with Steve and his Ma, other times they’d go into town and Steve would show him the best places to eat. And of course, the place they visited most was the dirigible. It was getting closer and closer to its maiden voyage
He’d heard horror stories of children getting high fevers and rashes. Pups could die from that, he knew.
“Steve?”
“Benefits of living with a fanb--”
This reality was particularly hammered home for Tony as he and Steve walked to get lunch on a cool September afternoon at some small family-owned place Steve had discovered.
“Gotcha,” Tony said, and Steve had no idea what he had worked out, but he led Steve over to an empty chair next to an older man who was patting a large black cat.
“I will destroy you,” Pierce growled as he tried to sweep the man’s leg from under him. “And when I am victorious, I will take Stark, and he will build weapons you can’t even comprehend. Hydra will rise.”
“You better,” Steve huffed, but his arm tightened ever so slightly and Tony couldn’t help but smile. “Now what smells so sweet in this package?”
Steve seemed to perk up at that. He lay his head back, lengthening his spine, and there, that was the kind of thing they were after. “Great, ok, now if you just--”
He reached for Tony only to find his hand blocked as the Sheriff hand snapped around his wrist in an iron grip.
From then on, he knew from Jarvis that the soldier called by the estate to visit with some regularity. Tony never saw him. He found himself taken into town for business, or out inspecting the estate whenever Jarvis informed him of the soldier’s arrival. He may have accepted his heartbreak, but that didn’t mean he was up to the task of basking in it in his own home.
They agreed on a decent rate, with a generous tip should the work be completed to the farmer’s satisfaction. Tony managed to wait until he’d left before hopping around in excitement.
As he started across the street, he saw a flash of movement out of the corner of his eye and turned his head to see Natasha coming down the street at pace. Sam made his way over, and he expected their usual exuberant greeting after time apart, but instead she gave him a quick kiss before taking his arm and making a beeline for Steve.
“Can we go home?”
Her whole family hours away and her on her own in Pasadena.
Tony had no choice but to follow the crowd, losing Steve in the chaos.
“Are you saying I didn’t provide for you on the journey?” Stíofán asked, poking Tony in the side.
He grabbed his dumb overpriced satchel and stormed out, leaving Tony to flop back into his seat.
“It’s ok,” a voice behind him said. “He loves kids.”
“This is a disaster, an absolute disaster!”
No. Those thoughts were dangerous. Steve was his best friend here, and he couldn’t ruin it by pushing for more. Things were good, and he should be happy with what he had. No need for anything to change.
Tony replayed what he said and flushed so hard he felt dizzy. “That wasn’t innuendo!!! He just has a workshop I can use to build a new one.”
He disappeared into the back, as Tony looked at Jarvis. “We have no money.”
The bell above the door rang and Steve looked up to see a man in a thick jacket, torn in several places and Steve could see his hand clenching and unclenching from under the sleeve. It put him on edge, even if he couldn’t immediately tell why. It was just another customer most likely, maybe he was the sort who felt anxious talking to people or was having a rough day but it felt like more than that. The way his eyes flitted around the store as if looking for something kept Steve’s attention even as he pretended not to watch.
– and the big lug had stopped to look at his phone to see a message from Tony. His body was relaxed as he leaned against the fireplace, chest on full display, and on his face was the most besotted expression. It was a good pic. It was a
“I can’t believe you,” Steve told him, and he sounded both horrified and impressed. “Did you just
Tony actually loved the traditional violet witch robes, but if his father thought he was wearing it while trying to fly a broom he was nuts. He had enough to focus on without freezing his ass off. Instead, he’d opted to modify it, wearing dark jeans and a jumper of nearly the same shade beneath the robes, which he wore open. With the hood back, it looked a lot like one of the hoodies he knew commoners his age wore, but much longer, coming down to his knees.
Steve got up, pulling on his clothes. “Is the bathroom actually broken or can I use it?”
“I wish to accept the Emperor’s challenge.”
“Good boy. Hugh?”
Steve watched as the guy checked over the bike thoroughly for a good ten minutes before humming thoughtfully. “Well, nothing obvious. I’ll have to go over her with a fine-toothed comb.” He straightened up. “Why don’t you head on into town, grab a coffee or something, I’ll take your number and give you a text when I’m done.”
Tony tried not to flush. “Dinner. It’ll just be Peter and me on our own again, we’d be happy to have the company and it sounds like our place is warmer than yours at least.”
Rhodey came by the next morning to check on him, dismayed at his broom and checking him over for more serious injuries. Tony accepted the attention, refusing to acknowledge that it felt nice to have someone fussing over him.
“Fine, let me see what I can do.”
And perhaps the man had been the focus of Tony’s visit to the room where Peter took his lessons, if he were honest, and maybe he’d brought with him a book he knew Mr Rogers would enjoy simply to watch his eyes light up in happiness.
Steve grinned. “Maybe you could let me take you to Coney Island, like I’ve been suggesting. And I’ll pay, since I’m meant to be learning a lesson.”
This. This could be enough.
Steve wasn’t sure how to say no, and really what was the harm? He gave Edwin his number, and let the man enter his own.
He slammed his fists into the punching bag again and again, faster and harder until his hands were numb, and only stopping when his knuckles had split, rivulets of blood trickling down his wrists.
Tony froze, his arm still outstretched in mid-air. “What?”
The colour was coming back to Antonius’ cheeks, fortified by the wine. “It is more privacy than we are given at the Stables. You have a solid door for one. And no one to share with.”
Steve looked over both shoulders to check no one was watching, then, forgoing the jack, lifted the car with one hand so he could use the other to undo the bolts, remove the punctured tyre and put on the new one. His super-hearing caught the sound of footsteps from inside the house and he quickly lowered the car down, grabbing the jack like he had just finished with it.
“If you like that sort of thing,” the third omega with short strawberry red hair and a pointed nose said, sounding unimpressed. “There were plenty of pretty blond omegas in this town, but instead he chose some tan, dark-haired minx from out East? Shocking.”
“Well, don’t spend too much time feeling sorry for yourself. When you’re my age you want to be happy with the life you led, not weighed down with regrets.”
There was a hum of agreement. “Tony. It’s nice,” the alpha replied, a pleased tone to his voice. “And in return, would it be too much trouble for you to call me Steve? I may be the Sheriff out here, but at home, I’m just plain old Steve.”
“You’d already sacrificed enough! You had done your job, and you were still going to leave again. Where I would have to wait, praying I didn’t get that phone call, or end up standing next to your mom when she got handed a folded flag. She didn’t want you to go back either, but you were being so stubborn you wouldn’t listen to us.”
“No, you came here so you could say you met Captain America, and you have. Turns out I just don’t like your opinions much.”
“I don’t,” Tony reiterated firmly.
It had been hot as fuck.
Penultimate Chapter! - Some non-graphic ouchy aftermath
“Yeh, yeah, I’ll watch ‘em,” Bucky shot back with a wave. “Go on, you love-sick billygoat.”
Tony rolled his eyes. “You know being a virgin at twenty seven isn’t a big deal.”
He felt too nervous to sleep, looking around in the room he’d had since he was a child. He wouldn’t be back here after this: he'd have to say goodbye, taking only the essentials. Well, the essentials for making him a desirable omega of course. He’d packed a second bag with his remaining keepsakes and valuables that wouldn’t make the first trip. Jarvis took those home to keep safe, promising he would bring them himself one day when Tony was sure he was settled.
“I can see that,” Steve offered, feeling a little overwhelmed. But then the first part of what Tony had said filtered through, and he felt the rage rip through him. “He tried?!”
Tony felt a growl of frustration, and he wished again that Steve was here. Those muscles of his could carry Peter like it was nothing. Or better yet, Tony could pass Peter to him safely on his damn horse!
The sheriff held out a hand to help him into the buggy. “Shall we?”
“I’m looking forward to it.”
farm. Our uncle is a scientist. He uses the space for his experiments and study, and Jane and I help him out.”
“Do you want her to be eaten? Because she’ll get bit all over and puff up like a balloon!”
Another quake rocked the floor and Tony clutched the plant tighter even as Steve pulled him back to his feet.
“Yes Papa,” Peter replied, making one of the dolls walk across the small stage. “If he is not too busy making his eyes all big at you.” He brought his hands up to his face and uncurled them, miming big eyes.
“I will, also I’ll let you know when I’ve set up my gaming stuff and we can try and beat the new level.”
The tractor roared to life, causing a chicken to squawk and flap away, making Mr Barton laugh.
“Where are we going to get a cat with forty five minutes notice?” Tony rubbed a hand down his face in frustration, trying not to lose it.  “You know what? We’ll just go ahead. Cat or no cat.”
He sounded confident, and Tony felt a little fear slip away. Steve was the expert after all.
“Oh, it’s Steve,” he held out his hand, and the other man took it in a firm grip.
