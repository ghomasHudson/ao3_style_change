Because I'm not so much of a jerk that I really wanna leave anyone hanging, keep reading this if you wanna feel a little better.
Clint nodded, feeling relieved. He pressed his head to Phil's shoulder, trying to focus on being with his lover even as flashes of what Creed had done to him flickered through his mind. Clint felt himself shiver a little. Some of it had actually felt good, much as he hadn't wanted it to. He knew Phil had probably heard him moan a few times, and that as much as anything made him burn with guilt. Clint took a deep breath, trying to bring himself back to the moment. "I... I'm sorry. About... I'm sorry you had to hear. I'm sorry," he managed, unable to quite articulate what he was thinking.
Nat had been wet before Clint even started - just the kisses and knowing how hot he'd be after their separation had been enough to get her revved up. Feeling his clever fingers working her open was the icing on the cake. Far from passive, Nat moved against Clint almost as much as he moved himself. Soon she shuddered, her body throbbing with the first flowing waves of climax. Nat cursed in Russian and even gasped Clint's name in a husky groan while her legs tightened around the man's shoulders.
Bucky pursed his lips, a pensive expression shadowing his features. “No,” he answered after a lengthy beat. “You’re right; I’m never going to get better if I don’t face this.” Looking just as lost as he felt, Bucky reached out for Steve’s hand. He found the other man’s strong grip solid and reassuring. “But I don’t want to face it alone,” he said softly. “Can I count on you to be there for me? Please, Steve?”
Phil sighed and nodded slowly. "I don't either. We just have to remember that Nat's stronger than she seems - which is kind of a scary thought." The joke fell flat, but it had helped to attempt the humor. Straightening, he couldn't resist putting a hand on Clint's shoulder. They both needed the comfort. "She's a survivor. Can you really picture Natasha Romanov letting herself get taken down by this?" Dangerous as all their lives were, Clint and Nat were the pair he would put his money on outliving the lot of them. They were both too smart and too determined to do anything else. At least he hoped they were. "Right now we see what Director Fury can find out. If we can find out where whatever Loki's looking for is, we can head him off at the pass. It's our best play right now."
"It's been an education," Scott answered with a smile. Sif wasn't exactly a laid back, relaxed sort of lady. Still, she was undeniably fascinating. Talking to Sif and Thor was like interacting with characters from a book of fairy tales, at once strange and intriguing. "You and Natasha get Creed checked into his brand new temporary home?" Though he knew that Creed was Logan's brother, he mostly just thought of the guy as a crazy pain in the ass, and the idea of him being permanently under lock and key was soothing. One less nutjob in the world was always a good thing.
Scott didn't bother holding back. He wouldn’t have said no anyway, and his filters were more or less gone thanks to the shots. He arched into Logan's body, his lips parting as Logan worked all of his most vulnerable spots in quick succession. Already hard, his cock strained against his tight pants as Logan pushed all the right buttons.
Simmons' eyes went wide. She'd been staring at the code so long she honestly hadn't even thought about mixing things up, had been too caught up in the idea of fixing what was there to think about actually changing it. "Oh! Oh! Fitz," she hissed, waving him over and point at the screen, all but bouncing on her heels despite being exhausted. "Run the simulation again. Please," Simmons added, cheeks going pink as she waited impatiently for Bruce to flip the virtual switch. "This could be it. It could actually work."
Clint trembled a little as Phil seemed to come back to himself. The archer was likely tougher than Phil in a fight, but when it came to holding together emotionally, his handler was the strong one. Phil was the one that kept his cool when missions went to shit. Clint only kept his cool when he absolutely had to. With Phil seemingly having collected himself, Clint buried his face in the man's chest, shaking all over. "Don't. Don't do that again. Not for me. It's not fair, dammit. I don't want him hurting you to be my fault," he said as tears finally spilled over. He knew Phil had meant well, but Clint would have rather been in Phil's place than left tied up to watch it happen to someone so dear to him.
Logan shook his head, sliding his hand to the back of Scott's neck. "You think too much, Scooter," he growled, dragging the man into another kiss, drawing Scott's tongue into his mouth and sucking on it as he ground his hips up against his lover. Maybe it was callous or maybe it wasn't, but Logan wasn't the sort to spend his time mourning too heavily especially when he was pretty sure what activities Stark would encourage in the same situation.
Clint opened his mouth to tell Phil to run, but Victor was headed for him, not his handler. Clint ducked, rolled and dodged, managing to narrowly avoid Victor for several moments before the mutant managed to catch him by the ankle, yanking him off his feet so hard that the air was knocked from his lungs. Clint felt a sort of panic wash over him as he felt Victor's weight settled over him, the mutant's hand closing on the back of his neck, metal claws scraping at his throat. The archer was certain he was about to die.
Clint absently registered the exchange as he settled into his seat between Coulson and Nat, his mind halfway on his anxiety regarding their opponent, the other half focusing on Fury as the man settled into his seat at the head of the table and gestured to Phil. "Agent Coulson. If you'd get us started..."
"So... mind games?" Logan asked, refocusing on things at hand. "I can smell my way through illusions alright," he said, recalling Mystique's attempt to fool him. "Somebody gets inside my head, though..." He trailed off, looking vaguely unsettled by the idea.
Tony stayed tense under Loki's touch, swallowing hard. He registered the god's distraction a moment later, and his gaze followed his captor's, registering the unusual cast of Loki's skin. "I think your complexion begs to differ," he murmured, wondering if that had been what Loki had meant when he'd spoken of the gun's effects on him earlier. "And, y'know, the whole torturing my friends and threatening to kill them. And me."
Clint smirked. "I like the way you think," he said. He forgot sometimes what Loki had done to Coulson. Not so much because he hadn't cared, but because the whole thing had seemed like one horrific nightmare, and now that Coulson was right there with him still, it seemed even less like something that had really happened. "Make sure he researches a way for us to both get to do the honors. I think we both deserve the opportunity to pull the trigger. That is, if his big brother doesn't show up and save him last minute. Again."
Clint was grateful for the other man's grounding presence. Thinking about lost agents, especially knowing he'd killed a few himself - even though it was under someone else's control - hurt in ways he couldn't begin to articulate. The mention of Phil getting the Cap's shield permanently tattooed into him gave him a good chuckle. "I get not being able to decide." It was his turn to squeeze Phil's hand, and he bumped shoulders with the other man. "And I think the shield might've been cool. Just a small one on the shoulder."
Darien gave up on restraint and groaned as he sped up his strokes. It only took a few more before he came hard over his own hand while watching Clint's leather-bound ass slamming forward into Natasha's willing body.
Bruce nodded, started out the door, then paused. He fiddled with his glasses uncomfortably and smiled nervously as Simmons looked at him with curiosity. "Thanks for your help. And for getting me to help you." He smiled with a little more confidence a moment later. "And for not treating me like a powder keg." He glanced briefly at Fitz. He'd have preferred no audience, but the idea that he'd have any chance of that happening again anytime soon was one he wasn't willing to bet on. "Simmons... Jemma. We should have coffee sometime." He saw her start to protest, and held up a hand. "In a coffee shop. With no lab equipment." Already nervous enough, he smiled one more time and then ducked out the door.
Clint's eyes flicked to Coulson. He still hadn't really registered Loki's proximity, and he settled uneasily on the gurney at his back, leaving the hammer on the floor, the toe of his boot hooked through the strap. "Alright. Hurry up."
Tony tilted his head a little. "Maybe he was scared. Mommy and daddy want him to be a prince, marry a girl, rule a kingdom. He just wants a guy who, as far as anyone knows, is his brother. But mom and dad trump that when you're a dumb kid. Or teenager. Or... how fast to Asgardians grow up, anyway?" Tony wondered aloud, brow furrowing. He shook his head a moment later. "Point is, people do stupid shit when they're scared. Trust me; I know."
In which things to very badly when Clint goes to talk to Scott but the team ultimately gets their first win in awhile.
"My son," Frigga broke in, her patience obviously thin, "will be most pleased to see me should you step aside." She glanced behind at the entourage and then back at the guards. "I have new companions to introduce him to and old friends with whom he should be reunited. I also have little patience for waiting."
Xavier sat back in his wheelchair, looking slightly less friendly than a moment before. "The help, we'll gladly give. I'm not sure how I feel about turning over a dossier of a fellow mutants' capabilities to the government. You don't exactly have an outstanding reputation when it comes to dealing with mutants."
Fitz winced. "To put it a bit less nicely, it won't work at all. That section there doesn't go off with a bang, so to speak, and Captain Rogers' cells keep eating themselves. Well, eating the serum-y bits, anyway, and eventually there won't be anything left to wake up."
"I’d like to think you do," Jemme agreed. The truth was that rather than being bothered by the grief, she felt better knowing that Bruce was so comfortable around her. He kept to himself a great deal, and she knew there weren't many people he broke down around in any sense of the word. "Fitz is just a bit jealous - not, I mean... it isn't romantic, but we just... we've been each other's for a long time. He takes it hard when he loses my time." She offered an apologetic smile. "That doesn't mean he doesn't like you, though. He's just a bit of a harder sell is all."
Logan grinned and put his hand out to Scott. "Darlin', I'd love to hold yer hand," he decided, winking at the other man. It was cute, really, Scott's hesitance. He couldn't blame the guy, though. Logan knew he didn't exactly scream 'hug me' to people around him. "My PDA limits mostly involve no fuckin' on the restaurant booth. Unless I'm really drunk." He gave Scott a look that let the man know he was aware of the irony.
"You know, of all the adjectives used to describe me, I think that's a first for 'nice'," Tony observed, leaning in for a chaste kiss. "Wait, just the two of us... Does that mean that the elevator's an option? I mean, I could probably find a way to get it stuck between floors or something." Knowing he was probably pushing it, Tony decided, "Or... we could just do the log cabin. That works, too."
Natasha edged wasn't surprised when she slammed the door open with a single kick. "Get away from him," she snapped while Clint leveled a bow at the man on top of Tony.
"I have a rather nasty scar to attest to that," Coulson agreed grimly. "With most people, I wouldn't ask, but have you encountered anyone like this before?"
"For my part... well, alcohol can convince me to do a *lot* of things," Tony admitted with no apparent shame and actually a little bit of a grin. "So, yeah. I've had a few guys. Sometimes a few all at once."
Bruce shook his head. "I can keep some hold on the big guy, but I don't know I'd necessarily trust him with anything more delicate than a club."
"You do, too," Tony answered softly, amazed by how close the contact felt, how emotionally intimate it was. "Love you," he murmured, the words punctuated with a soft moan. Pushing a little deeper, he angled his hips, searching for that perfect spot inside his lover. He wanted to make Steve see stars.
Tony sagged a little with relief. Hopefully that meant that Steve was out of the woods as far as possibly dying, at least. Getting the serum to work or recreating it might be another story altogether, but if Steve was healing up from the gun's effects on his own - even if it was at a standard human pace - that meant that they had time and didn't have to rush a solution. "I messaged Bruce last night. Our discussion ended in him blocking my phone number, so I'll need yours later. But that can wait," Tony said. He wasn't going to let Banner off the hook that easily. Bruce probably knew that. Tony quickly stuffed a few pastries into his mouth and then settled back into his wheelchair. It was getting easier to move around even without it, but it also amused Tony to make Coulson wheel him around, so he hammed it up a little as he settled back into the chair. "Driver, I'm ready to go!"
Clint smirked and then patted Darien's cheek as he stood. "Don't think I share just anywhere, anytime," he said with a faintly off-kilter smirk. Reaching down, he tangled his fingers into Darien's hair and pulled him into a possessive kiss. "Ready to head back to HQ? Maybe have a couple more beers and a BJ, then hit the sack?"
Steve cursed under his breath and clutched the comforter in his hands. It was better than grabbing onto Tony and risking hurting him. He almost decided to warn the man against pushing himself too hard again but thought better of it. Steve just wanted him not to stop. He stared down at Tony as his lover's cheeks hollowed and the suction became delicious to the point of near pain.
Clint's jaw tightened, and he nodded. It hurt, but it was a relief, too. At least she knew and she wasn't shoving him out of bed and screaming at him in Russian for being an idiot, which was pretty much what his imagination had constructed as the most likely result. Smiling faintly, he pressed his forehead to hers as something else occurred to him. "You know, no one would ever believe that Natasha Romanov likes to snuggle," he teased.
Logan gasped in surprise and then moaned a second later as Scott's nails dug into him. It was a pleasant surprise to find that Scott wasn't afraid to push things a little, and the light tingle of pain just made the pleasure that much sweeter. That combined with his lover's dirty talk and the way Scott moved against him were perfect aphrodisiacs. Logan nipped at Scott's throat and kissed the bruises still lingering there from the night before. All too soon, the sensations overwhelmed the feral mutant, and Logan came hard, exploding inside Scott and crushing him against the wall as he roared his pleasure.
Steve respected the other man enough to think it through before he answered. “I don’t trust everyone, but I trust my team. I trust Coulson. If I’m not close, I’ll make sure he is.” When it came to SHIELD, Coulson was one of the few agents who didn’t make him feel like he was being continually assessed as a threat. “You’re not going anywhere. I don’t want you worrying about that part. Just hang in there for me, okay? We’ll find a way to make this better.”
Looking equally worried, Steve explained, "Clint used it when we found Loki at a SHIELD base. We knew he was looking for it, but we didn't know much about it. At the time... well, at the time, we didn't have a lot of other options. Kind of like now." He felt his stomach twist at the thought. They'd lost Tony because they'd had to move fast, plunge ahead without enough information or time, and now they could very well lose Clint too in just as horrifying a fashion. "Is there a way to break the connection once it's made?"
Steve turned red and ducked his head. “It’s nothing fancy,” he insisted, manners winning out over modesty as he added, “but thank you. I just… I wanted this to be nice.” Of course, Tony had a point. Considering the company, he didn’t think the food could matter enough to make him not enjoy the moment. Steve smiled and nudged Tony’s foot under the table. “It’s not easy to impress a guy that owns the building you live in.”
Scott panted into his lover's mouth. He was already aching for it, wanting Logan to fuck him. No matter how good Natasha's fingers felt, they were nothing compared to that. The bumps and bruises were nothing compared to the pleasure he felt with both of them working him up. "Think I can take you," he pointed out to Logan. "I think it's enough." He knew he sounded like he was asking permission, and he was to some degree. After everything, he understood that it was all a lot to take in, but he wanted Logan to be willing to take the ride with him and fuck him into the mattress.
It had hurt like a bitch being shoved away and then falling to the floor to boot, and it took Darien a moment to catch his breath. "Fuck," he sighed only to realize he was being asked something. The words reverberated slowly through his skull, and he forced himself to look up into Clint's burning gaze. The sight alone drew a groan from him, and his hips shifted in a desperate plea for more. "Fuck me," he requested only to realize that wasn't nearly enough. "I need your cock inside me. I need you to fuck me so hard I can't walk tomorrow."
Logan offered Scott a faint, brief smile, settling on the barstool next to him, leaning back against the bar with his elbows on it. "Well, then... Glad I got ya drunk," he said, though he pointedly kept a fair distance between the two of them, not so much because he was afraid of Scott making a move, but because he was pretty sure if he got too close to Scott again, he'd have the man sprawled over the bar and screaming his name. //Might be a little awkward if someone else decided they wanted a drink to start the day off.// "Maybe we should go watch some television and be useless the rest of the day like we planned?" he suggested.
"To find the pieces? You thought he was dead. You had every right to think that. Risking more lives... that would've been the wrong thing to do. You know that." Bruce sighed and pushed off of the bench. "Go get some sleep if you can. Maybe by tomorrow you'll have two friends to visit."
Steve was actually fond of kids, but he understood the sentiment. They were just getting to know one another, and it was nice to be able to carve out a little time for relaxation. A horde of underaged fans wouldn't exactly be the right way to start that off. When the waitress arrived, Steve ordered one of the larger steaks on the menu medium rare along with a beer. Catching the look Logan gave him, he smiled. "When in Rome..." He passed his menu over and waited for Logan to make his selection. "My image as a Boy Scout may be slightly exaggerated. Nobody's perfect all the time."
Knowing it wouldn't make it easier to wait, Coulson took a moment to divorce himself from it all. He related the rest in a flat tone free of emotion. Fury received the information without batting an eyelash. He stared straight at Coulson and never even blinked. By the time he finished, Phil was clutching Clint's hand tight. It took longer than he would have liked to get the muscles to unclench.
Clint shook his head. "It's not that." Well, maybe a little. Having Nat so close and still miles out of reach in a lot of ways was eating at him, but, "Mostly, just... all the stuff that's going on. I feel like I should be out doing something about Loki, and instead I'm stuck here, waiting for everyone to figure out the next step." It wasn't new. He'd played the 'hurry up and wait' game a thousand times. But Loki being out there, free, creating chaos wherever he could made it hard to deal with staying inside. "I guess really I'm just restless. It's actually kind of nice here. I mean, having you guys around. People to talk to." He still remembered talking to Steve about Tony and Logan. It hadn't been for his benefit, of course, but the opportunity to get to know a teammate better was never something he would scoff at.
"Pretty s-sure that if I do, the doc's just gonna... gonna have to stitch me back up... a few times," Tony replied, shuddering as pleasure slowly overwhelmed his ability to speak coherently. Steve moved against him perfectly, felt perfect inside and out. Unable to hold back anymore, Tony began thrusting more steadily, nipping and licking at Steve's throat, his collarbone, anything he could get his mouth on. As he felt his peak nearing, Tony rested his forehead on the sheets next to Steve's head, hooking his arms under Steve's shoulders as if to get more leverage.
"From you and from Mr. Stark, yes. Uh, Mr... er, Loki, I would like to examine you as well, but there's no hurry. You're welcome to settle into your room right now. I need to tend to Agent Barton if Dr. Banner is willing to stay and help?" Jemma cast Bruce a hopeful smile. Clint looked like death warmed over, and she wanted the back up if nothing else in case Clint lose it entirely. Even as she watched, Coulson was holding on a little tighter to the archer, silently and stoically protecting him from Loki. As if it would help if he really decided to try something.
"Not nearly so good as you feel." He knew he wouldn't get it all right, not every bit of inflection or turn of phrase. Thankfully Stark seemed rather hell bent on making himself believe, and that would make it easier. "Let it go." Loki's fingers dug into the muscles, and he felt Stark giving in and letting the fears wash away. He dared to kiss the bared back of Stark's neck then to see how it would be received. If he was right, Tony wasn't going to be fighting anything much longer.
"Jarvis is pretty handy," Logan had to admit. "And no need for a closet. One pair o' shoes, and if it needs a hanger, it won't survive me usin' it, anyway." He grinned, digging into his hot wings and taking another swig of beer. "All I need's a bed and a drawer. Though I ain't above livin' outta my duffel bag, either. Toilet and microwave's nice to have, too."
Phil had seen Clint naked before, but since he made it a point not to ogle other guys at the gym when he could help it, and they'd hardly taken anything off at the club... He found himself staring openly at the man straddling his lap and enjoying every second of it. Clint was sinfully gorgeous, all long, lean lines and sinewy muscle. Phil honestly couldn't decide what to touch first, so he settled for taking a leisurely tour over the whole of Clint's chest with his fingertips. The touches were light and exploratory, finally settling on a paler line of flesh at the bottom of Clint's ribs. "Where'd you get this one?"
Tony considered a moment, his hands trailing over Loki's body. Finally, as his thumb moved up to circle one of Loki's nipples, Tony looked up into bright blue eyes, his own heavily hooded as he took in the sight of his lover, hard and ready above him. "Fuck me," he decided, shifting anxiously. "I need to feel you inside me."
"Better than that," Steve agreed. He kissed Tony with all the love and desire he felt in that moment. "I really, really do love you." He loved a lot more than the fact that Tony was a spectacular lay, but it didn't exactly hurt his affections. Steve breathed deeply to remind himself to take in enough oxygen to keep his body functioning. "Lay down. We'll shower in a little bit, but right now, I want to take advantage of the fact that I can use you as a pillow without you losing all feeling in your extremities for once."
It had been a long time since Darien found a guy who wasn't all talk. He'd picked up a few over the years who promised they liked things a little rough, that they could push the boundaries. Usually that meant at best a little light bondage. Clint, on the other hand, seemed willing to back up his crazy opening with just as extreme a finish line. He threw his head back and continued to stroke their cocks together while giving Clint obvious access to his chest.
Feeling awkward again, Logan shrugged once more. "You can think about it. Meantime, I'm gonna get some coffee and maybe some breakfast from the kitchen. Want me to show you how to get there?"
They all hurried together to the elevator and then up to Tony's room. They were breathless and eager like a bunch of teenagers about to do something they knew was against the rules, and honestly they probably were. Steve felt sure this fell under the "sexual misconduct" portion of their contract somehow, he just didn't particularly care. Rules were in place for a reason, but they didn't really have any place in the bedroom.
Logan, meanwhile, was busy trying to ignore the guy next to him that was doing a lot of work to get his attention. "You're drunk, kiddo; go home," he finally growled. The very delicate-looking, barely-legal young man flounced off, and Logan turned his attention back to Tony and Steve on the dancefloor. It made his blood boil to see how close Stark was getting to Steve. //Yeah, and is that protective instinct, or jealousy? Stark's got a headstart if you're thinkin' o' takin' a guy home for the first time you can remember.// "Archie? Danny? Whatever... bring me another beer."
Coulson was moderately certain he'd stopped breathing while Clint spoke. He knew it took several beats for the blood rushing in his ears to clear. He didn't know the right thing to say, and that wasn't normal anymore. He'd left most of that uncertainty behind in his youth, and as a grown man, Phil Coulson had found a certain measure of confidence. That did nothing to help him scrape together the right words for Clint, who looked painfully lost and uncertain.
Bruce couldn't help shooting Simmons a mischievous grin before lunging forward and giving Fitz a big bear hug. Stepping back, he clapped Fitz on the shoulder and grinned. "I hear you two are the brilliant ones. Let's see what you've done." He pulled up the files on the work they'd done, putting his glasses on as he looked them over. "This really is amazing." He glanced at Simmons. "You're the biologist, so I'm guessing you did most of this? It's incredible." He smirked. "Few more years, and you're going to make me look like a solid idiot."
"Yeah. It's kind of disappointing that I get winded carrying lunch in," Steve sighed. He wanted to be able to do it all, but it seemed he'd have to get used to being able to do a bare minimum at least for awhile. "But, hey, building that muscle back up." He rolled his eyes and grabbed himself some food before settling into a seat next to Tony. He shared a smile and a quick kiss with his lover before addressing the group more widely. "You guys having any luck?"
"I think I will," Bruce decided. "Maybe after a nap. But I will definitely take you up on that. Especially if it means getting to poke and prod Loki. Particularly the poking part. With sharp things." He meandered back toward the building slowly. He knew that he wouldn't get much sleep that night, and there was no point in rushing back when the company was so nice. "I'd like to get a look at how Steve's vitals are doing after the fight, too. I'm really impressed with his improvement so far."
"That seems dangerous. Or is Stark's reputation as a lush just bad press?" Scott followed just the same. If the team really was getting to know Logan, they already knew better than to steal the man's booze - or would soon. It was a good way to end up with adamantium jammed through your eye socket. As much as he wasn't sure he was ready to fall in with any kind of team again, Scott had to admit that the Avengers had pretty posh digs. The place looked like a million bucks. With Stark's budget, he suspected it had cost a whole lot more than that. "What are they like? Outside all the press, what are the Avengers really like?"
“You don’t have to thank me,” Steve answered earnestly. “Knowing what I do now, I’m just sorry I didn’t do it sooner.” He wondered how much pain he could have saved the both of them by simply barging into the lab a week earlier. While he gathered plates for them both, Steve confessed, “I was worried that you’d be mad at me for moving rooms. I guess it’s stupid, I knew you wanted space, but I… I think I slept better when I was closer to where you were,” he admitted, blushing faintly.
"Is it my birthday already?" The banter was interrupted by a door opening at the back of the room. Natasha straightened as Loki stepped in.
Jemma beamed, relieved that she hadn't pushed too hard or assumed too much. "That," she replied as she took Bruce's hand, "sounds like perfection. Italian is my second favorite actually, right after Thai. Mostly tom kha soup. I have an absolute addiction to the stuff. And to manicotti. And cannoli. Thank God for excellent metabolism, actually, because I love to eat."
Tony seemed to come out of his usual creative haze at that. He'd almost forgotten Steve in a sense. With more urgency than Bruce knew he possessed, the billionaire pushed himself up and took off.
Logan groaned, his fingers digging into the sheets to try and get traction as he savored the contact, groaning and growling for all he was worth. He'd felt the slight hesitation in the blonde as he'd regained his wits, but Steve was as strong as Logan had hoped for, and the animal inside him revelled in meeting an equal. Fucking and fighting were separated by a very thin line for the feral mutant, and having no reason to hold back made the line that much more blurry. That, and it had been a damned long time since Logan had had a good roll.
Loki sat up and broke his gaze away from Stark. There was really no point in trying to talk to a mortal, but he needed to talk to someone. Stark was there, which made him the obvious choice. It was a frustrating conundrum. Once upon a time when he was younger, Loki had thought there was hope that his brother might be an ally, someone to listen to his thoughts and problems. Of course it turned out that women and mead were of far greater interest to Thor. "It's my understanding that your fortune came from selling weapons of destruction, Mr. Stark. You're sure that the leadership of your planet is doing so fine a job?"
Logan crossed his arms over his chest. "I'm used to people not trustin' me. But gettin' treated like a rabid dog that might need to be put down any day ain't my cup o' tea." He snorted. "Not that they'd stand a chance. Don't mean it don't piss me off, though." Coulson wouldn't have lasted half a second. Clint might have been a handful. But still dead in the end. "Thinkin' they might've thought about hurtin' you pisses me off even more."
"I'm fine," Tony replied without looking away from Steve. "It can work." He didn't bat an eye as he said so. "Even if it doesn't, between Thor and the Hulk, I think we can deal with any crap he tries to pull." He turned back to Loki. "Just be ready for no one to trust you for a while. And for Barton to probably want to kill you. I'd probably avoid him if I were you. At least until you've fixed his hammer problem."
"I love you too," Scott answered, unable to keep the smile from his face. He would never have pictured being with Logan as something easy or comfortable. As it turned out, it was both. "I never thought I'd be at a place in my life where so much is changing all at the same time and you of all people would end up being the one who treated me like it was normal. Thank you."
Logan nodded. "Their odds're better, at least," he noted, thinking of the televised stunt that Stark had pulled during that alien invasion not too long ago. Logan wasn't a doctor, but it hadn't looked to him like Tony had been doing so well with the whole being alive thing at first. Logan had seen entirely too many X-Men lost in conflict either to death or to people like Magneto, who saw those around him as a means to an end. "Good news is, I'm apparently mostly indestructible, and Stark's too much of a tool to die."
Internally, Coulson cursed that Logan wasn't more relaxed and couldn't let Scott be for five minutes. Outwardly, he offered the man a sympathetic smile. "You don't have to do anything. We aren't going to. I just want you to be open to the possibility that something is off and be on alert. You're going to spot the holes before anyone else. Don't let yourself be blind to it. Don't explain it away. If you need help, ask for it. I'm not looking to take sides or create friction with you two, but I don't want someone getting hurt because we let it slide."
Logan found himself considering the proposal before he even realized it. He'd be able to look Scott in the eyes whenever he wanted. The man wouldn't have to choose between hiding indoors and worrying about killing someone. Hell, Scott could live as normal a life as he wanted. More than a lot of mutants could say. Hating himself for it, Logan got as close to the bars as he could, looking Loki hard in the eye. He doubted he'd be able to tell if the man were lying. Hell, he couldn't even get a scent off the guy, but that didn't mean he wasn't going to try. "So, what kinda disgusting low do you think I'm gonna stoop to for that kinda favor?" There was no sense pretending it was anything but a profoundly tempting offer. Loki obviously had no trouble reading people.
Bruce had to duck behind a monitor and pretend to analyze something to keep from chuckling at the whole scene. Seeing Clint looking ready to swallow his tongue and Tony looking like he was wrapped around Steve's little finger was definitely making his day.
Phil blushed and decided, "Let's go with some more making out under the tree. I don't think I've had enough beer to think a tattoo is a good idea." He rose and snagged his bottle, gathering the trash and then tossing it into the barrel nearby. He knew without testing the theory that Clint would have left it all on the table. Phil had never been able to divorce himself from thinking about who would have to clean it up after working a stint as a janitor in high school. "Besides," he added as they headed toward the grassy area again, "I'd get an arrow."
That was it, then. The weapon was of Asgard, and at heart, he was not. Somehow it was tearing away the mask he'd worn his whole life, or at least enough of it for Loki to feel uncomfortably exposed. "You may have done yourself a disservice. What I am beneath the face I have shown you all is even less pleasant." He said no more. Soon enough he suspected Stark would see clearly enough. At least he wouldn't be able to say much. He feared for the safety of his friends, and he should fear for it. They were in Creed's hands, and the man was a monster himself. Loki wondered if Thor had ever bothered to tell the Avengers the real story of his life and his parentage, if he'd been disavowed at once or if Thor had carried the burden of his teammates thinking their parentage was truly shared. "What did my brother tell you of me?"
Steve set his glass of champagne - now mostly empty - onto the tray of a passing waiter. "Do you have a plan for our escape? I caught a cab here."
Coulson was glad Clint had the strength to let go like should have already. He gave a shake of his head, not a negation, exactly, but a way of giving himself a moment to get steady. He took a few slow breaths and finally managed, "Yeah. Lucky." He felt lucky to be alive, but he wasn't sure how far that feeling went. It didn't feel right sometimes. The spell cast by the place had been broken. "We should head back. Check and see if Tony and Bruce have found anything." Before they faced Loki again, he wanted Natasha fighting with them. "We're going to fix this, and we're going to beat Loki with Thor's help or without it."
Scott glared at the man. "I don't have performance anxiety, thanks. Just... it's... this is different. The injury happened when I was a kid. The first time I had any control was after the professor found me." It had always been artificial. Scott forced himself to breathe slowly and evenly. He wasn't going to let Logan see him fail completely. He might not be quite as useful in a fight, but Scott knew he could hold his own. //I can hold my own if I can figure this out anyway.// A few more deep breaths and Scott focused on a spot on the wall across from them. He felt the familiar pressure and surge and let the familiarity guide him. His body knew what to do even if he hadn't ever tried it this way. One hand rose as if to control the visor and ended up falling back to his side again as a beam of red, at first wide, too scattered to be effective, shot out toward the wall. The concrete - or whatever it was since Scott knew better than to think Stark would use something so pedestrian - showed little damage until Scott reached down inside himself. He wrapped invisible fingers around the beam, squeezing it, forcing it into something tighter. A small chunk of the wall flew free and then a larger one before Scott blinked a few times and cleared the ruby from his vision. "Well... it works."
"I hope you don't mind if I'm not physically able to stop touching you for awhile," Scott whispered as they walked down the hall. The Tower was eerily quiet. He didn't like the still silence. He didn't like how strained everyone's faces were. He'd been through it before, they both had, and it never stopped being horrific. "I barely met the guy. It's still..." He didn't know how to put it into words. He also knew that Logan would understand anyway. They entered Logan's room in the same silence, and Scott wrapped his arms around Logan and just held him. "Okay, sorry, you probably need sleep. I needed that first."
Bruce tilted his head thoughtfully. "Sounds magical. I could stand to get away for a minute," Bruce decided, trying to ignore the eyefucking going on a few feet away.
A small drone buzzed in behind her, and Fitz proudly proclaimed, "We thought he might be able to get the gun for us without anyone having more contact."
"Mmm... perhaps," Loki allowed with a sigh. Mortals were more confusing than he had expected. More resilient. Stronger. It was actually incredibly frustrating. He let the issue lie for a moment, resolving to see what he could do with what was left of Coulson's mind after Creed was finished. Perhaps he could still find the answer then. Loki finally returned his gaze to Stark. "As for the sleep and sex that you missed out on, I suppose that's something I could make reparations for."
Tony swallowed hard, the twist of guilt and fear he felt at the question enough to kill any remaining arousal. He drew himself up, looking away as he wrapped his arms around his chest, feeling exposed. "I'm sorry." He realized that didn't explain a damn thing, and he took a deep breath as he looked into Steve's eyes. "He... he disguised himself as you. I knew it wasn't you. I saw through it, but... I thought I was dead. Loki had told me he was going to use me for awhile and then kill me. I just wanted a little comfort. And I thought... I thought I'd never see you again, so..." He bit his lower lip and trailed off, taking a deep breath. He started to leave out the rest, but it had hurt enough already to keep the secrets from Steve. "The next time, though, he didn't... didn't bother with the disguise." Tony felt panic as he realized that the revelation might mean Steve would never so much as talk to him again, that he might end up losing the man, anyway. He clenched his jaw as he fought back the urge to cry.
For the first time, Scott felt he'd seen a flash of what Barton was talking about, and the thought of it made his blood run cold. Logan on a good day was dangerous. Logan out of control could mean a whole lot of bodies. He rubbed his wrist and broke eye contact, not sure how much he trusted himself to speak. "Did I act any differently when I was in charge? No matter how pissed off you might've been, I don't think you would have made another call. I don't think you really would here either. If you thought your people were in danger, you'd do what it took to protect them. That's all this is. It would be stupid not to ask questions." //And I've been pretty willfully stupid the past couple days…//
A few minutes' walk had them standing in front of Darien's new quarters. "You'll be staying here. You can use the rec room, gym, etcetera down the hallway," he pointed, "and the full kitchen's the other way. Kitchenette in the suite. Just don't leave this floor, or security will want some answers." He paused, giving Darien another almost awkwardly long look. "Need anything else?"
Clint hooked his arms under the billionaire's armpits as he sagged, gently easing him to the ground. He took Tony's pulse, then cut away the torn fabric, revealing the injuries on Tony's already-well-scarred abdomen. The archer produced some paper-thin bandages from nowhere and pressed them to the wounds, starting some kind of chemical reaction that fused them to the man's skin. He looked up at Steve. "Stopped the bleeding. He'll be fine, but he could use a doc. And maybe some blood." It was easier to focus on what needed to be done at the moment. Every time he thought of Nat, he felt useless.
Phil and Clint weren't meant to feature in this fic as more than background. We happen to be in love with them, though, so things happen. Enjoy our lack of focus!
Clint nodded casually, almost managing to look completely innocent as he glanced around the kitchen. "Yep, all done. Just making sure there aren't any evil bastards in here to get you all worked up and do absolutely nothing about it," he said, the hint of mischief in his clear blue eyes becoming evident. He didn't really care if anyone caught them. The worst it'd earn him was a dressing down. //Wouldn't be a first…//
"And just so you know, you haven't pushed." Scott couldn't help smiling back at Logan as they remained cuddled up closely. "You've been great. I pushed. I pushed myself farther and faster than I should have. I don't want to backtrack with this, I just want to be..." He fell silent and considered the right words. It would be painfully easy to make it sound like he was avoiding Logan when he was trying to give himself breathing room. "I just want to be less desperate. We live dangerous lives, and I don't want to miss things, but right now, if I have to put the hero stuff on hold to have the stuff with you... I think I'd rather do that."
Scott laughed out loud at the image and settled himself in more firmly against Logan. It was like being wrapped in a cocoon, safe and snug and warm. He needed that sense of security even if they weren't likely to have long to enjoy it. "Okay, when you put it that way, I should probably talk to Coulson." Scott paused. "I didn't get a whole lot of what was going on, just what I could figure out from the chatter. Care to paint me a picture of how bad things are going to be around here?" If the gun could knock Logan on his ass after one use, he wondered what the hell had happened to Steve trying the same thing twice.
"You certainly have a way of making a simple search sound rather... grand," Hank observed, tugging at one of the taller shelves to check its stability before he hoisted himself to the top. "I'll start up here."
Tony grinned, gave the press a sort of gloating wave, and dragged Steve out of the room via a side door that let out into another, smaller conference room. Careful to lock the door behind them, Tony then shoved Steve against the nearest wall and pressed another heated kiss to his lips. "Y'know, I figured I had about an eighty percent chance of getting my teeth slapped out of my head back there. Glad statistics failed me that time," Tony murmured even as his fingers started loosening Steve's belt. "You'll have to forgive me," he breathed, "if I don't have the patience to go all the way back to my room. And, y'know... walking through the halls with a boner? Kinda awkward." He leaned up and nipped at Steve's throat, sighing heavily as he pressed close to the blonde and cupped Steve's groin through his jeans.
"I'd have to say that is one of the least lame stories there are to explain it," Clint agreed, his hand tugging the rest of the buttons loose after gaining open permission. He slid his thumb along Phil's collarbone before finally gently tracing the scar with his fingers. "Matter of fact, I hear it's right up there with shark bite scars for getting you laid."
It took less than a minute for Natasha to round the corner and take stock of the situation. "Clint, now's not the time. We need Loki in the plane, and we need him there fast. You're on herding duty, not killing duty. Creed didn't do anything to your brain, right? So you still remember that those two," she gestured to Steve and Tony, "are actually in charge at the moment?"
Fury gave the billionaire one of his iciest glares before looking around the room again. "The reason Thor isn't here is because I can't get in touch with him. Not that he exactly left a phone number behind, but he also didn't exactly take much notice when his brother turned up down here. On his girlfriend's planet. Which he's ridiculously overprotective of." Fury brought up a picture of Magneto. "We all know already the Brotherhood is tied up in all of this. I managed to get my hands on a bit of information, which is admittedly sketchy, that he may actually be on Asgard, making sure that Thor is playing nice under some of Loki's mojo. And possibly holding mama Thor hostage, too."
"And a phobia for flying," Clint noted. The man had spent too much of his career surviving on his ability to read people to not notice Logan's nervousness, subtle though the tells were.
Logan got himself out of bed with far less grace and professionalism. Hair mussed and wearing a set of boxers that he'd obviously just dragged on, he glowered wordlessly at Steve as he stalked toward the coffee pot. When the man opened his mouth to speak, he held up a silencing finger as he poured himself a cup. Once he'd had a sip, he raised an eyebrow and leaned back against the counter. "I'm guessin' you've got somethin' important goin' on to drag yourself away from your playboy and risk talkin' to me before I've had my coffee?"
Logan frowned at the phone. "He's alive. But the serum's out," he said. He didn't know exactly what that meant, but he knew enough about Steve to know that it meant the man had at least temporarily lost his powers. He tapped out an acknowledgment to Coulson, then set the phone aside once more. "Stark's with him." He frowned. He couldn't imagine losing his abilities. It had to be even harder for Steve considering where the man came from. Grabbing the phone again, Logan sent a request to be notified when they'd be allowed to visit Steve. "Feel like I kinda owe 'im a thank you, at least."
Even if Steve hadn't said anything, the way he writhed in the most tantalizing way possible made it clear that Tony had found that perfect angle, and he eagerly took advantage of that knowledge. Still doing his best to heed the blonde's earlier request to take it slow, Tony was careful to only angle his hips just that way with every few thrusts, enjoying the sight of Steve squirming under him entirely too much to end it too soon. He ran a hand through Steve's hair, loving the sounds of pleasure his lover made with every stroke of Tony's cock. "Fuck, you're beautiful," he breathed.
Victor's lips parted, his breath hitching softly as he watched Loki work. He looked perfect there, kneeling before the feral mutant. Victor couldn't help but thrill at the thought that a god was on the floor, sucking him off. And Loki looked like he was enjoying every minute of it. Heeding Loki's earlier words, Victor cradled the back of Loki's head in one rough hand and pulled him forward, watching his hardening shaft disappear under those perfect lips.
Clint quirked an impish smile at Darien before pressing another possessive kiss to his lips. "I can help with that," he purred, looking oddly pleased. It was tempting to shove Darien against the wall and fuck him stupid all over again, but he had plans for the evening. "Let's get cleaned up. We're going out."
Clint grumbled as the gentle touch woke him, and he rolled back into Coulson, draping his arm across the man and burrowing his face between the pillows his handler was propped up on and Phil's body. He dozed back off for a few minutes before reluctantly waking. He turned his head so he could look up at the other man, then forced himself to sit up slightly and leaned heavily against him. Noting the tablet in Phil's hand and the grim look on the man's face, Clint reached up and cupped Phil's cheek, urging him down so he could brush their lips together. "I take it the updates aren't so great." He hadn't really expected them to be, considering what they'd already known. Phil's expression just confirmed it. Clint pressed his head against the man's chest, trying to comfort himself with the sound of Phil's heartbeat. He didn't want to lose physical contact with Coulson, not even for a second. He was pretty sure he was going to have a hard time maintaining any sort of professionalism during the debriefing, because he knew he was going to want to more or less lean against Phil the entire time.
It was better than nice. Phil knew his smile had gone from pleased to slightly goofy, but Clint didn't seem to mind. "This is really, really nice," he agreed dreamily, content to let Clint do or not do pretty much whatever he wanted. The man looked oddly stunning while relaxed and taking his time. Though certainly Clint was capable of great restraint on a mission, Phil wasn't used to seeing him not just restrained but actually relaxed. For once he'd actually slowed down. "I get the feeling you hear it often enough, but you're gorgeous."
Steve's eyes widened in sudden understanding. "Oh. Oh, I... I'm sorry. That must have been... awkward." Which was precisely what he was feeling at the rather intimate touch and proximity. Steve gently moved Logan's hand away and took a step back. "I'd be happy to talk to him if you think it would help. I mean, I'm with Tony. I'm not looking to get in the way of anything."
"Good. Need someone to keep me straight. Especially lately," Clint decided. He took a thoughtful sip of coffee before adding, "and I know just about anyone from the team would've let me crash their couch, but..." He looked up and grinned faintly at Coulson. "If you think I'm admitting to Tony Stark that I need to sleep on his couch because of a nightmare, you're out of your mind."
"Oh, no, I can... I mean..." Utterly flustered, Steve looked carefully at Tony. He was taken completely off guard by the suggestion, both pleased and worried about whether Tony would really keep wanting him there even if he thought he did. "I can get everything - there's not much - but are you sure?" The last thing he wanted was for Tony to start resenting him for being in the way. They'd had a great time together the night before even if the morning after had been a little awkward. He didn't want to mess it up.
"I could say the same to you," Loki answered with a hint of a smile. "Take care, Mr. Stark." He closed the door behind him but left it unlocked as promised. He drew himself up to full height and took a deep breath. It was time to put the walls back up, at least long enough to try to maintain some control over the troops. Coulson and Barton would be on their way with an army of a sort, and he needed to be prepared.
“Bucky? What happened?” Standing in the doorway, Steve looked tense despite having finally gotten through to Tony. Seeing the text from Coulson had sent his pulse racing.
One corner of Clint's mouth twitched upward in a weak impression of a smile. He appreciated the sentiment, even though his insides were all nerves and anxiety. "I swear, I'm gonna kill him this time. I don't know what it takes to kill one of those bastards, but I'm gonna find out," he growled, frustrated beyond words. It was bad enough, what Loki had done to him. What Loki had done to Phil and Nat was just too damn much.
"You can go ahead and fuck me right here." Darien doubted his sanity would hold out as long as Clint's could when it came to real torture. "Unless your friend Agent Coulson is due back, in which case I'd rather retire to your room, just without the lack of resolution."
"You forgot killing Phil." Tony raised an eyebrow at the strange twitch that got out of Fury, but stayed focused on the subject. "I mean, that's pretty much the long version, but I think that's what he's going for," Tony said, earning another glare from Fury, which phased him not at all.
It bothered Coulson to realize that the fact Steve couldn't breathe *wasn't* the thing weighing most heavily on his physician. He swallowed hard. "And?"
Though he wanted less than ever to be apart from Tony, Steve reluctantly agreed, nodding as he trudge over to a too-small, too-hard chair and sat down. He typed a quite note to Pepper to get the files from the top of his desk. Bucky's was at the top of the stack of those that he'd requested from Director Fury after joining the Avengers initiative. He'd wanted to see it all laid out, the lives of the people that he'd left behind and the ones who he'd lost even before that. He felt numb. The day had been too surreal. Tony was in the hospital and somehow Bucky was alive. Bucky, who he'd watched fall to his death decades before.
"I take absolutely no pleasure from people's suffering," Tony said with an expression that made it perfectly unclear as to whether he was serious. "But the waiter's definitely going to get a good tip. Twenty-five percent, maybe more. So you shouldn't call me a bad influence; I'm generous," he declared, taking a sip of wine and a bite of food. "But he probably does deserve it." He gave Steve his trademark grin, the one that had gotten him out of trouble on many, many occasions and into trouble almost as often. "Dessert?"
"You two wouldn't know 'routine' if it slithered up and bit you on the ass," Fury spat, pushing himself up and stalking out of the room.
Tony felt himself beginning to crack. The pressure of keeping everything bottled up inside demanded to be released. Despite Tony's best efforts to the contrary, the words spilled forth, breaking through the emotional dam like an onrush of water. "Okay, we'll talk," he agreed, his shoulder shuddering beneath Steve's touch. "What topic should we tackle first? How I was kidnapped? That's a good one. Or how I screamed out your name when your buddy was fucking me? Because that's what I did. That's what I wanted... for it to be you."
"No, you don't get me just yet," Tony replied, voice quiet but leaving no room for argument. He ran his free hand over Steve's slender back, watching thin muscles shift as the blonde squirmed. Slowly, he stroked a finger over Steve's puckered hole, gradually pressing harder until the digit slipped inside his lover. Tony moved closer to Steve, letting his cock press against Steve's ass as he worked. "Gotta be patient," he murmured, though Tony wanted to be anything but.
Logan took a moment to shrug off his shirt before drawing Scott closer. Fingers slick with lube lightly brushed along Scott's ass crack, slowly finding their way to the man's entrance. Logan stroked the tight ring of muscle gently, at least trying to be considerate of his lover's well-used state. Taking advantage of the angle and Scott's closeness, Logan nipped and licked at the man's chest, suckling at one pert nipple as one of his fingers  sank into Scott's body.
Steve gave up on holding himself back and reached for Bucky’s hand. The feeling of the solid skin beneath his own was more comfort than he could have imagined, and he felt the sting of tears that he tried to fight back. “Right now my job is making sure that you and Tony are okay. I know it’s gonna be a long time before you are, but... you’re not gone. We’re both here and we’re alive, and whatever kind of mess we might be, that means something.”
Darien couldn't really catch his breath, too terrified and excited to even try. He wanted to look behind him to get a better idea of who the hell the stranger rimming him was, but Clint's grip on his hair made it clear that wasn't in the cards. He looked up instead at the man currently pulling the strings. They were all there for Clint, ultimately. The other guys might have a go at every guy that came into the back room, but they were taking all their cues from Clint. And he was Clint's. It was a strangely comforting thought. If Clint wanted him dead, he would already be dead, which meant that most of the existing possibilities were of an equally dark but probably more entertaining variety.
Clint seemed to come back to reality as the two talked around him. Their combined presence was reassuring. The idea of the three of them together in one place and relatively safe even moreso. Clint squeezed Nat's hand, offering her a weak but sincere smile. He hadn't gotten to see the details in Nat's file, but he hadn't needed to. Hadn't wanted to. That was a story that was most definitely hers to tell if she wanted to. He hated the idea, hated that she understood. He used his grip on her hand to pull her onto the couch next to him and tugged her close until he could place a gentle kiss to the woman's forehead. He realize a moment later that Phil might take the gesture the wrong way, and Clint made a point to press himself into their handler's touch more firmly as he drew away. "The three of us are a real mess, y'know that?" he said shakily, forcing a faint smile. "Glad I have the two of you, though. Don't think I could do all this without you guys."
Clint nodded. He hadn't thought of that. The idea was sobering. The likelihood of Loki reversing the damage he'd done seemed low. "Well, there's no getting him to volunteer for that, is there? Except maybe getting his brother to 'convince' him. Wherever he is," he added, glancing out the cafeteria's big glass windows as if he might spot the god descending from the clouds at any moment. Clint tossed his napkin on his tray and leaned back with a sigh. His gaze drifted back to Phil. He kept turning over in his head the way the man had been acting the past two days: more controlling, more protective, more demanding... //He's just stressed. We all are.//
Clint nodded. He didn't want to put more on the woman, but she seemed willing to talk about it at least superficially. "He's back. But... Nat, there's something off about him. It's almost like... like when Loki..." He trailed off and clenched his jaw. "Like when I was compromised. Something about him. I see it in him. He acts mostly normal, but there are these moments. I don't know him that well, but he threatened me. And not just with a fist in the mouth."
"I'll build myself a new one if it falls off," Tony decided, but wiggled a little to get his arm into a position that would allow some blood flow.
Tony blinked uncomprehendingly at the other man. "Our relationship? You didn't have to tie me up and strip me down to ask me that." He swiped his tongue over his bottom lip, his mouth suddenly very dry. The drug was taking effect, and Tony fought to stay lucid even as it lulled him into a dreamlike state. "We're friends... teammates..." he began to slur. "Ever heard of the Avengers? That's us..."
"Hm. Would have liked to have seen that." Natasha sank back down onto the bench in her cell. "Do me a favor and tell Stark to hurry... if he can stop making out with his boyfriend long enough."
Deciding it would be awkward no matter when he made the observation, Steve grabbed his own plate from the tray and sat down next to Tony's bed. "I kind of figured Pepper would be pushing me out of the way by now. I mean, I know she's busy with Stark Industries, I just..." He searched Tony's face for any sign of an explanation. "You don't have to tell me if anything's wrong. It's none of my business, I know, it's just that you're both my friends." Steve couldn't help feeling a twisted sort of hope that Tony and Pepper were amicably separated, and he felt awful for wanting something that would mean unhappiness for two of his friends.
"Not leaving it laying around for them to pick up," Clint countered, grabbing a carabiner clip and securing the hammer to his belt, the weight oddly reassuring as he drew his bow. He glanced at the weapon Coulson was holding, raising an eyebrow. "Not sure you should play with that," he remarked, ducking just in time as something went flying through the space where his head had been. Straightening, he felt his blood run cold as he realized who he'd just dodged. "Claws. Huge. You must be Logan's brother," he deadpanned before firing an arrow straight into Creed's chest.
The words were strained with none of the usual warmth he expected from the man. Steve's mind felt as slow as his shivering body, and he managed to get himself into a seated position with Coulson's help as it finally struck him what was missing. "Tony!" No response came immediately, and panic set in. "Where is he? Where's Tony?" The physical chill was easing off. His body knew how to warm up, but Hydra had known that it would be the best way to take him down too.
The thought had occurred to Coulson too, and he hated it. He hated it with every fiber of his being. "I hope not. Right now we're working on the assumption that only those who have had direct contact with Loki somehow are affected, but it... obviously, it's just a working theory." It was a way to keep from having a breakdown while they figured it all out. "I'll watch you. If something seems wrong, we'll deal it," he assured before rising again. "Let's go talk to Natasha."
Clint smiled. "Thanks. Might take you up on that once in awhile," he said, honestly grateful. The archer was a true loner, preferring to recharge himself with training, reading, and generally hiding from the world in his spare time, but it wasn't rare for him to find himself wishing for a familiar face to talk to, even just a little. "And pretty glad you're not all about hurting me. Think I've had enough blows to the head. Probably get a few more before I retire. Rather not hit my quota too soon."
"Jesus," Clint breathed, looking at the photos. He flushed a little shamefully a moment later. "Sorry. Just..." He shook his head in disbelief, then immediately felt grateful he'd had a heads-up because he was pretty sure he'd have made a complete ass of himself otherwise. He handed the phone back to Nat. "This is definitely not gonna be good." Rogers obviously couldn't lead them in the field like that, which left them leaderless in an already barely-cohesive team. "Just when I thought things were gonna get better."
"Hey," Phil reached for one of Clint's shaking hands while Simmons fluttered around them taking readings. "Hey, look at me. You're fine. You're going to be just fine." He hoped that was true and looked up to see Simmons give him a half shrug that said she had no better an idea than he did.
The last was enough to break the glare Loki had fixed on Stark. It melted into an expression of genuine humor, even if the god was still miles away from looking happy. He chuckled quietly and allowed, "At that, you may have a point." Loki shook his head and then looked back, meeting Stark's gaze since the man seemed so unafraid of doing so. It was interesting to see that Stark's tongue was undulled by fear. He had no apparent terror of saying the wrong thing and bringing about his friends' deaths. Whether that was bravery or foolhardiness, Loki had no idea. "So let's say I decide that I give up all pursuit of Asgard. I abandon my mutant allies. They will still desire to overwhelm you. Your world will not be safe from Magneto and his fellows. I care little for that, but I do wonder... where do you really think I could go?"
"Somebody has to take care of you," Steve protested, trying to ignore the rather lurid mental image of Tony naked and reclining in a tub. "Sit tight, I'll have something in a minute." Though he'd never become a four star chef, Steve was used to taking care of himself. He cooked his own meals, did his own laundry. He was used to not having anyone to do those things for him. Soon enough he returned bearing a tray with eggs, toast, bacon and orange juice. Steve couldn't help but smile as he set the tray down on the bedside table and helped Tony sit up. "If I stop surprising you, you might get sick of me."
Darien shivered at the intensity of Clint's gaze but found himself agreeing, "Yeah... yours. I'm yours," almost immediately. The words spilled forth of their own volition, but Darien didn't regret them. He was pretty sure he wouldn't have regretted anything that kept Clint interested in fucking him. His muscles clenched down hard around Clint's cock in a silent plea for more movement. Darien was smart enough not to demand anything, though. He was far gone, but not so far gone that he was ready to risk pissing Clint off just to cum. Not yet.
Logan's eyes took a moment to adjust to the considerably darker surroundings. He felt his way around. Smooth, concrete walls. Bars on one side. //Vietnam.// He shook himself. //What about Vietnam?// No, he'd just been at a zoo. "Widow? Hawkeye?" Claws still readied, he scented the air. He could tell Nat was near. As his eyes adjusted, he caught sight of the woman and reached out for her. "You alright?"
Logan couldn't resist the urge to steal one more quick kiss. He wanted to ask Scott what Loki had done, what had happened, if Scott had noticed any difference, but that seemed a bit too much like admitting to what he'd done, or at least inviting questions about it that would have forced him to either admit it or lie. He knew Scott wouldn't approve. "Gimme a few minutes," he said, hesitating a moment longer before pulling himself away from the other man.
Phil saw the look in Clint's eye and reached out to put a hand on his shoulder. The contact grounded him, and he hoped it helped Clint at least as much. "Natasha has survived things no one else could. Believe me, it'll take more than Loki to put her out of commission. If he couldn't kill me, do you really think there's any chance he could break her?"
Steve let the action guide him and tried not to think about it too much. Tony wouldn't be doing anything if he didn't want to. Assuming otherwise did his lover an unforgivable disservice. The slow, sensual kisses helped to remind him that were was no rush and no pressure. Steve drew back just enough to see the uncertainty in Tony's eyes. "If anything is too much, I'll tell you. I trust you, Tony. I love you." Steve tangled his fingers in the man's dark hair and kissed him for all he was worth.
Tony felt gooseflesh rise on his arms in response to the touch, the contact seeming to go straight to his groin. He broke the kiss with a soft gasp. It was an incredibly simple touch, delicate and small and unassuming. And it was all it took to make Tony understand that the god could play him like an instrument. It was intriguing. Tony knew he had no way of getting back to his true love, and killing that pain with a little bit - or a lot - of pleasure was starting to not sound so bad.
Resisting the urge to grit his teeth and roll his eyes, Steve agreed, "I can take care of it, Tony. I'm pretty sure it's my blood in the water getting them all excited anyway."
Tony's fingers fell still on Steve's shirt as his lips against Steve's mouth. One hand slid behind the blonde's head, and he moaned softly. The other hand gathered a handful of Steve's shirt and started tugging it upwards, working under shirt and t-shirt alike to slide over smooth skin. "Yeah, then, that shirt may not survive the night," Tony decided, both his hands sliding away and grabbing the offending garment. He yanked once, then twice, sending buttons flying and shoving the fabric away from Steve's shoulders, leaving Tony to yank the blonde's t-shirt off next. "That's better. More naked is always better."
"Oh... fuck, that's it," Clint growled, pressing his hips upward and watching the look on Darien's face. His shaft throbbed as it slowly sank into the nearly painful tightness of his partner's body, and the grip on Darien's hips tightened to the point of bruising. He loved it. Clint loved the power he felt, having that much control, keeping his uniform on as Darien writhed, exposed, on top of him, and enjoyed every second of it. "Mmm... god, look at you. You fucking love this." His hand tangled in Darien's hair once more, tugging until the man's gaze locked with his own. "Tell me you're mine," he ordered.
"I don't think anything but fairy tales cover this one," she returned lightly. Fandral was cute, but she wasn't interested in a long distance flirtation. Then again, something new and different when she was in the neighborhood... well, things happened. Natasha filed it away as a thought to revisit later. They were already close to the throne room. It didn't take knowing the layout to pick up on it. The guards were suddenly thick as flies around every entrance. She hung back, letting Sif and Frigga move to the forefront.
Logan shifted a little and groaned miserably. His mouth tasted like he'd eaten a sack full of old pennies, and the rest of him felt like he'd been hit by a truck. But worse. The feeling was fading quickly, but he still took his time focusing on his surroundings. Weakly, he reached out and dragged Scott toward him, tugging until the man was laying against him. Logan was quiet, still absorbing the moment. He hesitated as certain scents finally hit him. He tensed, reminding himself to avoid leaping to conclusions. "Scott," he asked slowly, trying to keep his tone neutral, "what..." There was nothing he could ask that didn't sound like an accusation in his head. Finally, he settled for stating what he knew, "Barton was here."
"The couch is fine with me," Scott answered. He appreciated that Logan was being nice - new territory for him as far as Scott could tell - but he wasn't ready to throw the man out of his own bed, especially when he could've gotten a room of his own if he wasn't so uneasy about being alone. "Believe me, it's going to be the most comfortable bed I've had in awhile, not counting the hotel. I'll see about a room tomorrow." Scott didn't like the thought, but he knew he needed to learn how to feel safe without a permanent bodyguard, and if he couldn't feel safe in Stark Tower, he would never feel safe anywhere. "Thanks for letting me crash here. Somebody who didn't know you might think we like each other."
The shaky rasp in Phil's voice was enough to drive a deep moan from Clint. He'd taken as much of Phil's cock as he could into his mouth, and he was bobbing his head slowly. He wouldn't be able to move fast for what was next, though. His handler's cock was far too big to shove it down his throat and let the man fuck his mouth like he wanted to. As Clint slid forward on Phil's cock once more, he let the shaft slide into his throat a bit, focusing to relax as the thick shaft pushed him past his usual limits. It felt good, though, and Clint's fingers dug into Phil's thighs as the archer's eyes rolled back and fluttered shut, another low moan rumbling up from his chest.
Natasha almost called Tony on his bullshit, but she decided against it. After everything he’d been through, he needed his friends even if it hurt to talk to them. Instead she nodded and slipped out of the room.
"You look better without 'em, too," Logan remarked before he thought about it. He wasn’t in the habit of holding back what was on his mind, but he hadn't realized that was what was on his mind. When he did think about it for a second, Scott's bright blue eyes were very- //Woah. Wait. Now you're just bein' weird. And the guy just got through gettin' handed around by a bunch of guys who wanted to fuck him stupid. He probably doesn't want anyone hittin' on him//. Not that Scott had ever really struck Logan as likely to be into men, anyway.  Looking as embarrassed as he ever had the decency to get, Logan stared intently at his bottle. "But I get it. Feelin' useful's kinda important."
"Standoffish only works half the time. Other half, girls just think it's cool," he said, taking a deep breath as they entered the restaurant. "Woah... Smells amazin'. Only way it'd be better is if I killed it myself." There were even craft beers. //Nice... real nice.//
Holding himself up against his lover, Tony looked up at him pleadingly. "Just gimme a couple more days? Please, baby," he whispered, looking more scared than he had in a long time.
It was honestly humiliating going through the whole thing, but it was hard to argue with the fact that once he'd showered and changed and had a baggie full of antibiotics and ointment, he actually did feel a little better. Phil made his way out and paused at the sight of Clint passed out in a chair. He should have gone back to his room, should have been getting some real, decent rest. Instead he was propped up in a plastic chair waiting, and Phil couldn't help but be charmed by the visual. He made his way over and put a gentle hand on Clint's shoulder. "Hey, let's get you somewhere a little less awful to sleep."
Logan stared blankly at Steve for longer than was remotely decent. His first impulse was to tell Steve exactly what was going on, but something stopped him. Instead of backing out of Steve's personal space, he shook his head. "Just... had a little argument. With Scott," he lied. "He's pretty stressed."
Steve rose with dignity and walked out side by side with Tony. He felt overwhelmed and grateful and shaky. The adrenaline was wearing off, the effort of the day weighed heavily on his shoulders, and even with his health improved, his stamina wasn't where it should have been. Still Steve curled his fingers around Tony's as they walked. He felt almost shy, wanting to say everything all at the same time, to question and praise and touch and ultimately unsure what to do first. "I feel like I have a million things to say. Then... it's stupid, but I kind of just want to stare at you."
"Having Thor back would be the ideal scenario," Coulson agreed, rubbing his forehead as if it might soothe away his worries. The more time passed, the less he thought Thor would help at all, and the more it scared him. Even with the hammer, could they take down Loki and the Brotherhood without Thor's help? And how did one go about containing a god if they did? It hadn't worked out so well the last time they tried. "Fury either needs to tell us what the hell's going on with Thor or lift the drinking ban. I suddenly feel a distinct urge to be a casual alcoholic for a couple of days."
"You're actually a terrible liar. For a spy, I'm pretty sure that's not good." It warmed his heart the way their thighs rested together and their feet tangled under the table not entirely accidentally. If he hadn't been one of the participants, Phil supposed he would've found it rather disgustingly adorable. As one of the participants, it made him giddy. "So you're saying that if I take you home and have my way with you somewhere around date number three, you aren't going to assume I do that with everyone? We'll just pretend we didn't skip the whole first date part before the first time? I'm worried that this could ruin my reputation for being completely frigid. The newbies are never going to believe I'm a robot."
When Phil's eyes adjusted, he felt his heart sink. Natasha and Logan were missing along with the god they'd come to find. "Base, we have a problem. Loki's gone. Wolverine and Widow are presumably with him. Any eyes on the prize?"
Tony shivered at the feeling of that darkened gaze upon him, the possession there. Part of him bristled at the idea of being used as nothing more than a toy, but that part of him was getting quieter with every graceful shift of Loki's body. The god felt too good to deny. Tony hadn't missed the effect he'd had on his partner, and he tugged lightly at Loki's nipple with his teeth before shifting to the other one, dragging his tongue across the hard nub before covering it with his mouth. His fingers pressed a little deeper into Loki's body, questing for that one perfect spot inside him.
Tony smiled, nudging one of Steve's hands with his face as the man pushed him back under the shower spray to rinse his hair off. "I think you better hold off on that press release. People will think you're delirious. Or that you've finally snapped," he said with a chuckle. He pulled Steve back under the spray with him and kissed him hard, his hands sliding down the blonde's slender back. There was nothing erotic in the kiss; it was all emotion. "I love you, Steve Rogers. Scares me to death I nearly lost you. You're not allowed to pull anything like that again, serum or no." They both knew that if Steve did get the serum back and further got back into the field that there was zero chance that the man wouldn't risk his life again if the situation called for it. That didn't mean Tony couldn't have his fantasy.
Tony smiled. It felt good to know his lover was going to stay close that afternoon. He hated the idea of being separated all day, and quiet companionship was something he could definitely enjoy. "I'm alright with that as long as we're not doing nudes. I don't think I can handle seeing Fitz naked," Tony decided around a mouthful of pizza. "Not to mention, these plastic chairs really stick to bare skin."
Logan helped himself to a good sized pile of eggs and bacon and started wolfing them down like he expected someone to take the plate from him at any moment. "So what now? You guys show me some cleverly disguised secret facility with an airplane under the basketball court? You're gonna have to do a lot if you wanna show Xavier up."
"Don't let the door hit you on the way out. It's a nice door," Tony said, already becoming engrossed in his tablet again.
"Think I'm okay with that. Really, really okay." Scott arched into Logan's touch and reached down to palm Logan through the barrier of cotton. He gave a warm squeeze to the answering hardness that he found there. "How the hell did I never notice that you're so sexy? You're so fucking hot." Scott didn't care that he was babbling, and Logan didn't seem to either. "Once the world is safe again, I suggest we spend all our time here in your room wearing no clothing whatsoever."
J examined the voucher closely, then nodded to his fellow thug. "You want more pretty, you come back," he said with a smile as the burlap was tied over Scott's head once again.
"And why should Bruce be here?" Tony groaned as he began to stir. Every inch of his body hurt, and he moved his fingers reflexively in Steve's grasp. No bones broken as far as he could tell. A few cracked ribs, maybe. He hoped being buried under a mound of crystal hadn't punctured one of his lungs. Tony could already tell he was having difficulty breathing. His vision blurred, but he could just make out Steve's concerned features through fluttering eyelids. "Did the whole damned roof fall down on my head?"
Natasha took to her feet the second she saw them. The bare flicker of unease on her face was akin to full out panic on anyone else. "No! You-"
Scott had actually heard himself whimper in protest when Logan left him, but he was soon gasping at the commanding tone of Logan's voice. It was a hell of a lot hotter than it should have been, but there it was. His cock throbbed at the bruising grip on his thighs and the feeling of Logan pressing against him, so close and still so far from where he wanted the man to be. "Fuck me! Please, Logan... god, please, fuck me... I need you, please!" Scott couldn't remember ever hearing his voice so ragged, so filled with need. In that moment, he was fairly certain he would have done anything that Logan asked him to just to get more. He felt the briefest flash of clarity and found himself wondering if Logan was the only one who'd had one or two of his internal threads unraveled.
"Really good." It felt normal. Since they'd gotten back, nothing else had, but sitting at the counter with Clint pressed against him and a plate of food was a slice of perfection. The silent assurance that eventually things could be normal and okay again soothed Phil's soul. "You're excellent breakfast company." Clint in the morning, he was coming to learn, was different than Clint once he'd had time to wake up and get his brain firing. He was a softer, more subdued version of himself - and every bit as wonderful. A glance at the clock made him frown briefly. "Unfortunately I think reality's going to intrude soon. After that, I suspect we're going to have to check in with the team. Nat's not going to take our word for it that we're alive."
Steve gratefully retrieved his shield but halted at the sight of Tony. "Stay back," he ordered sharply. They couldn't afford to run, but he wasn't about to let Tony get in the mix while injured. The sight of the blood was enough to make Steve want to leave it to the rest of them and get his boyfriend to safety. As a leader, he didn't have that luxury. Instead he stalked toward where the Hulk was growling at Sabretooth. "Now might be a good time to get your friend and bid a hasty retreat." Much as he wanted to keep Mystique as a hostage, Steve wasn't willing to risk the safety of anyone else if Loki decided he needed more hostages of his own.
Logan had to fight to hide a grimace as a memory flashed on the edge of his mind. Stryker, younger than Logan remembered last seeing him flashed before his mind’s eye. //"I'm putting together a special team... with special privileges..."// The mutant shook himself, then stood quickly from the bar. "No more teams. No more government bullshit. If you want someone to make an action figure out of, go find Scott Summers. He's prettier'n me anyway."
"That's exactly what he's doing," Coulson agreed. “Given our earlier exchange, I thought you might not like me being here. I feel safer with back up." Phil looked down at himself and then back up at Logan. "Training aside, I tend to think it might not be precisely a fair fight if it came to that." He spread his hands in a placating gesture. "I'm finished here. If you don't mind, I'll get back to my work, and you and Mr. Summers can relax."
As Logan spoke, the Hulk seemed to shrink back into himself until all that was left was Bruce, clinging to the waistband of what was left of his pants for the sake of modesty. "I should... really learn to wear more elastic," he muttered shakily, still looking faintly greenish but obviously in control of himself once more. He looked around at the still-terrified guards, smirking faintly as he looked back to Logan. "Let's go home. Much fun as playing around on an alien world might be..."
Tony sighed longingly as he turned away from the door. "You three should be aware that I'm missing out on some amazing, acrobatic sex with Captain America while we poke this Ass-gardian mallet with a stick," he sulked, hands jammed in his pockets as he sauntered in, offering Fitz-Simmons a look that said he thought they were a waste of oxygen before giving Bruce a smile that suggested he had absolutely no sense of self-preservation. "Any leads, or were you guys waiting on me to start the party?"
Steve couldn't respond at first because he couldn't catch his breath. It was shockingly hot to have Tony drawing things out. Normally his lover was the impatient one, the one who jumped in feet first and forget about the consequences until they became inconvenient. Instead Tony was the one stroking him and telling him to wait it out. Steve let out a low moan as as Tony's hard cock pressed up against him and promised everything that would come if he could wait long enough. "Tony," he moaned, rocking back against his lover's finger and making it clear that he approved heartily of the treatment.
Logan nodded. "I know what it's like to have relatives that need to be put down," he assured. "It ain't easy." He flicked another glance at Barton and Coulson before he could catch himself. "I guess you and I both have some ugly business to take care of."
Clint, clearly pleased with the praise, stroked Darien steadily. "Like getting me off that much, hm? Could do with more of that later. Love feeling those lips wrapped around my cock, using your throat..." he purred, giving Darien's cock a good squeeze as if to drive the point home.
Any chance at real entertainment in the form of breaking his neck gone, Nat snorted and zipped up her uniform. "Trust me, I haven't been missing anything."
"I've never had one, but I'm gonna guess that hangovers might not be too helpful where we're goin," Logan pointed out.
Coulson couldn't help it. Nevermind that he was a capable, mature agent who really had seen worse. He still blushed and ducked his head as he thought of a tactful way to explain what he'd seen. Ultimately, as usual, he decided on the truth and looked up again to meet Clint's gaze. "I saw things. Not everything, I'm sure, but some things. I've seen you with Natasha, of course, and one or two other... friends who have come by." He had looked the men up, of course. They were mostly military guys, probably all picked up at the same bar. None appeared to be any sort of security risk, none with any records to speak of, so he hadn't dug any deeper. "I assure you, it isn't something I intend to share with anyone else, and it doesn't change the way I think about you." It had, in all honesty, but not in the way Clint probably thought. It had simply made it much more difficult to keep the gorgeous archer out of his masturbatory fantasies.
Fury dodged. "Shit. I'll fill in the other affected parties. You write this shit down in the computer so it's common knowledge." He paused and gave them a significant look. "Before the reunion scene, gentlemen."
Phil's breath was ragged despite his best efforts to control it. It hurt too much for him to relax properly, which only made the pain worse. He prayed that Clint wasn't looking but didn't dare look himself to be sure one way or the other. He just wanted Clint to be okay. He wanted not to hear what Victor was saying and not to be forced to acknowledge that the man had a point. He wouldn't be able to forget it. He couldn't do that. //But I can live. I can live through this, and so can Clint.// Phil clung desperately to that idea and tried to let it be the light in the dark.
Nat followed in a similarly casual style with Phil close behind. Apart from Logan, none of them were strangers to such jumps. Nat considered jumping the easy part. It was what happened after they landed that worried her. Loki wanted them weak, he wanted them distracted, and she wasn't sure how he intended to get them that way. She had herself together a beat after landing. She saw nothing closeby, which was good. It meant they hadn't come in too close, at least. "If our scans are accurate, he's-"
"Fishing's alright," Clint agreed. "As long as there are fish biting. Shooting a pig in the eye is kinda fun when I can pretend it's Loki, though," he added, an odd glint in his eye. It had been rather satisfying watching an arrow blow up in Loki's smug face, but it still hadn't been as satisfying as watching said arrow go through the god's skull would have been. Returning from his reverie, he tilted his head at Coulson. "Maybe we should go camping together sometime. I know a good place for fishing."
"That depends on whether I'd be horrifying my new coworkers by offering," Natasha answered, looking to Scott. "I don't tend to invite myself to things like this - well, with anyone but Clint. He doesn't get a vote."
"I prefer a hands on approach. I'm sure you understand." Loki stepped easily through the forcefield to stand in front of the man. "Ready? Not that it matters."
"Whether you tell me or not... let's just say I'm not giving you enough room to get yourself in trouble for awhile," Natasha answered with a warm smile. She rose and followed the men, noting that they still remained entirely in one another's orbit. It could help. The attachment might be enough to help Clint focus through the task ahead. It might let him hang onto enough of himself to see him through. Once they were in the room, Natasha waited until both men sat down next to one another on the couch before she took a nearby chair.
Outside the door, Clint clenched his jaw, drawing his bow. He didn't like the tone in Logan's voice. The cadence was just the same as when the mutant had threatened Clint earlier.
Without waiting for an answer, Tony moved out to the hallway. Catching Coulson's eye, Tony tilted his head. "So, what're the odds of us getting him out of this place and back to my room? I feel like he'd be less likely to freak out and have an asthma attack someplace he was familiar and comfortable with."
"No," Bucky said with an emphatic shake of his head. "I want to try the injection." If he did not conquer whatever was triggering these episodes, he would remain in his own personal hell forever. "Besides, I doubt pills would have any effect on me." That was an understatement; Bucky was convinced nothing short of an elephant tranquilizer would have any sort of effect on him.
"I'd have to consult my database," Tony fired back, looking as irritated as he ever got. "Probably not more often than you pick up low class hookers."
"It might... if there weren't better ways to make me do it," Steve answered. He kissed Tony just beneath his ear and whispered, "Just think of all the things you could be doing under the table or that I could be doing to you without anybody knowing a thing." Tony enjoyed making him blush. He enjoyed making Tony look like he was on the verge of swallowing his tongue. "But for now, I'm thinking them knowing we're together is plenty." He glanced around the room and then back at Tony. "I always kind of figured if they wanted to watch they already were, I just prefer not to think about Maria Hill eavesdropping on any of this."
Clint cried out painfully as a small shock wave rocked the room, knocking a few devices and jars from their shelves. He sagged a moment later in Loki's grip, sweating and trembling and looking like he'd just gone through withdrawal. "Okay... okay, lemme go," he muttered shakily. He felt himself again, and he sure as hell didn't want all the reminders that having Loki so close and holding his face brought.
"I kinda thought so," Scott agreed, chuckling and wriggling out of his pants while they kissed, sloppy and hungry and kind of perfect. Until recently, he hadn't considered what sex with Logan would be like or how he might kiss. It didn't need a lot of thought in the end. Logan handled sex and kissing with the same sort of brutal instinct he approached everything else with. The surprising part was the realization that underneath all of that, Logan could show true care, true kindness. It was something Jean had seen underneath it all and tried to assure him of. Scott had been too pointedly set on thinking of Logan as a lost cause to take her word. "You could have me right here... up against the wall...."
One would think a large, mystical hammer would stand out. The sheer volume of things crammed into the warehouse meant precisely the opposite. Steve squinted at the shelves, the fluorescent light only dimly illuminating the backs of each one. "It's like the world's least organized library."
It took a half second for Tony to process the question and why he was being asked. "Colorado. We're gonna go to Colorado. Big cabin, far away." He met skeptical blue eyes and smiled faintly. "We were gonna have Nat make sure no one bothered us." He hooked his fingers into the suit's chest plate, trying to tug Steve towards him. "Any more stupid questions, or are you gonna very carefully wrap those arms around me and kiss me now? After," he directed his attention to Clint, "you make sure that your bruiser there doesn't turn his only shot at going back to normal into chunky salsa."
"Remind me to never, ever get on her bad side. She may not be a mutant, but I'm pretty sure she still has scary mind powers," Scott whispered to Logan as he watched Clint and Coulson together.
Clint smiled against Phil's skin, laughing softly. "Careful. I don't think my ego needs to be fed more," he said, nuzzling Phil's neck and kissing his way as far down as he could with the shirt still partially buttoned. He thought about unbuttoning the last few hanging on, but then reconsidered. He wanted things to stay slow, wanted to savor every moment. He couldn't resist running a teasing fingertip around the waistband of Phil's pants.
Loki held his breath too while he waited. He knew that Tony could pass any test. He didn't know whether the others would let him live long enough to see whether that mattered. His fingers curled into fists as he watched them stare, frozen, at the pair of men in the doorway.
"I was thinkin' more about beer and killin' cute forest animals for food," Logan replied, remembering his rude awakening that morning. The fact that Stark had dragged them to a gay bar was starting to seem less surprising. Then again, Steve had mentioned a parade of women, nothing about men. //Unless playboy's into high-priced drag queens.// Logan hesitated. "So..." //I'm gonna regret this...// "...what about the two o' you?"
"What about the kids? Do you think parents will want you to be a role model for their children now?"
"Very true," Phil agreed with a nod. "Fitz put his shoes up on my table once. He didn't ever do it again." It wasn't so much that he was bothered by the act as that he'd enjoyed the look of terror on Fitz face when he made his displeasure clear. Just because he was fond of Fitz-Simmons didn't mean they didn't need to get shaken up from time to time. It was a pretty surface sort of fact, and it felt odd to realize how little Clint probably knew beyond the obvious. Deciding to go for broke, he offered, "My mother died last year. We were in Mexico - that op with the cartel. That's why I was such a dick that week."
Though he still wasn't sure why, he was sure that Stark was giving in. He was relenting willingly and without any artifice or pretense that he was with someone else. Loki wasn't his lover, and Stark knew it, knew that Rogers was hundreds of miles away and might as well have been farther since the man thought him dead. Loki questioned none of it openly. He let his hand curve to the back of Tony's neck and relaxed into the moment. He wanted to use his own tricks of seduction and his own preferences this time, nothing of trying to play at Rogers' dominance and straightforward passion. Loki let the hand not holding Stark's neck slid up beneath his shirt to trail delicately up the man's back.
"Hey, no problem. Um, we have a couple of shirts. They're pretty awful tourist shirts, but..." She shrugged and pointed to the rack. "You're welcome to them. Food and whatever too."
The news was honestly enough to make Natasha weak in the knees, though the only thing that betrayed how she felt was a faint upward twitch of her lips. "It's about time we got some good news. Come on, Thor. Let's drop off our guest and then we can see if they're up for visitors. Logan, can you show Lady Sif around and fill Summers and Rogers in on what's happening? Bruce... get dressed."
Logan nodded, running a hand through Scott's hair and smiling. "Y'know, I tried that a couple o' times. Sayin' no, I mean." He smiled faintly. "It's pretty tough to make it a firm no. 'Specially when Chuck pulls your ass outta the fire." It felt good having Scott in his lap. The man being pressed against him meant that Scott was safe. Logan still remembered how vulnerable Scott had been when he'd found the man, and it was hard to stop feeling protective. "You might have a hard time goin' out into the field without me attached to ya, though." It had been frightening fighting Loki with Scott at his side, but it would have been more frightening for the man to have been out there without him.
Tony's first conscious thought was that his mouth felt like sandpaper. A jolt followed as his eyes flew open, his last solid memory being of the fight that had landed him here. //Here...? Sick bay,// he assessed, relaxing and then smiling a little as his gaze fell on Steve, leaned over some book or magazine or another. "Y'know, smartphones're more entertaining. And make you look less like an old guy," he murmured tiredly. He could tell he'd been given painkillers. His wounds still hurt, though. "Could use a glass of scotch..."
Natasha approached the pair warily. She didn't want to interrupt, but they looked far too grim for her not to want more information. "Have you heard anything?" she finally asked as gently as possible.
Bucky drifted in and out of consciousness. He felt as if he was floating outside of himself, lost in a shadowy mist. Struggling to find something solid and real to hold onto, Bucky reached out and blindly grabbed onto the nearest thing he could find. Unbeknownst to him, he had wrapped his hand around the arm of Agent Coulson. Bucky woke with a start and sat bolt upright in bed. "Where am I?" he asked, his eyes darting from side to side urgently.
Logan raised an amused eyebrow. "I think I like that idea," he said, his voice dropping a notch as he leaned in the nip at the side of Scott's throat. Logan had few qualms about PDA, but he figured Scott would draw the line before he ever would. Letting the other man set the pace seemed like the best approach. "Definitely have no qualms about stickin' my tongue your throat in the park."
Tony glanced up in surprise, commenting, "I didn't know you could cook." He took a grateful sip of water, swallowing and finding his dry throat easing off. "Aren't you just full of surprises? Nurse, babysitter and cook? Next thing I know you'll be giving me a sponge bath." He couldn't help teasing Steve, especially when the other man was behaving like the epitome of a boy scout. Tony wasn't used to being fussed over unless Pepper was present. He took care of himself, and it was an odd feeling allowing someone else to take on that role.
Logan's breath left him in a low groan as he cupped Scott's face, thumb tracing over his lower lip before he leaned in for a kiss. "I'm glad that's what you want, because after ya looked at me that way, you're not gettin' away without it," he rumbled, slamming another, harder kiss to Scott's lips as he slid a hand back to cup the man through his underwear. He needed to forget for a minute. They both did.
Bruce shook his head, pointing at Magneto with the hand that wasn't holding his pants up. "I think we'd better put him in containment first. Back to SHIELD HQ. We can find the cave with satellites now that we know which area to look in."
Logan groaned into the kiss, savoring the taste of Nat's sex on Scott's lips. He briefly dragged his fingers over the woman's sensitized clit before blindly unfastening Scott's fly and shoving denim and underwear away. His fingers wrapped around Scott's exposed cock, slicking precum over the shaft as his other hand cupped Scott's cheek gently in spite of his rising passion. "Definitely... not gonna get tired o' you," he agreed between sloppy, anxious kisses, "but might talk me into sharin' again..."
Victor groaned softly as Loki's cock slid perfectly against his own. He knew that he would only be able to take what he was allowed to, but that didn't mean he wasn't going to enjoy what he could get. Razor claws dragged over Loki's skin, and Victor was surprised at the thin trails of blood left in their wake. He wondered absently if it was an illusion for his benefit, but didn't care enough to ask. He was far more focused on getting getting the god to moan for him. He smirked down at his partner as he started a steady rhythm with his hips, letting their cocks slide together. "Hmm... never made a god scream before. Wonder how my odds are...."
A sharp knock sounded at the door and was followed by Coulson opening it a crack. He averted his eyes but still informed them, "Logan's going on assignment. The head of his old team went AWOL. Figured you'd both want to know. Be sure you zip up before you come out."
Steve felt his heart break for them both even as he smiled. "I'll tell him. Every word." Their goodbyes were only somewhat strained, and Steve promised to come back, to check in, to relay any messages from Scott as soon as he could. He made his way down the line with a heavy heart and found Scott curled in on himself on the bunk at the back of the cell. "Scott?" The man's gaze snapped up, and Steve was struck by how young and vulnerable he looked. On paper they'd been walking the earth the same number of years - the ones spent on ice not precisely counting as far as Steve was concerned - but with his tear-streaked face and the circles under his eyes, Scott looked like he wasn't nearly old enough to have been through so much. "I know we don't know each other very well, but I wanted to check in."
“You okay?” Bucky asked as he rounded the corner. He could see the anxiety bunched in Steve’s muscles through the white T-shirt his friend was wearing. It did not take a rocket scientist to work out what was troubling Steve; Tony Stark seemed to be all the other man could talk or think about. Bucky felt an irrational stab of jealousy whenever the topic had been brought up. Something had happened to Tony, something awful that no one wanted to talk about. It was as if everyone - including Steve - was walking on eggshells around him. It didn’t help that he was starting to remember things. Vague images crept into his mind, brief and blinding like the flash bulb of a camera. Bucky had no idea what they meant or how it connected, but he didn’t care for the implications. “Only reason I ask,” he continued, keeping his tone light despite his dark thoughts, “is because I’m worried you’re gonna mess up that pretty face with all that frowning.”
Over the comms, Scott informed them, "No sign of a return trip or a landing. We don't have eyes on any of them."
Darien had to fight the urge to kiss the frown off of Clint's face. He reminded himself that their relationship wasn't that kind. At best they were friends. He shook it off and poured Clint a cup of coffee. "You look like a man who needs it black right about now."
"Yes, I have noticed that," Loki answered. "Your little group of misfit toys holds a grudge almost as well as I do." Loki smiled faintly at the idea and the growing look of panic on Tony's face. He really hadn't thought it through before, but he obviously was now that he'd been prompted. "Eventually Creed will tire of them, and we'll release them into the wild. Or, if I haven't had my fill of you yet, then I'll keep them for a time as leverage." Loki reached out and ran his fingers over Tony's cheek. The movement halted as he noted the cast of his skin, the faint lines that seemed to be surfacing over it. "As far as the world is concerned, you're already a corpse. All that will be left to do when I've finished with you is make it true."
Logan had to bite back more snark at the sight of the pajamas. They looked like something Beaver Cleaver's dad would have worn. For his part, Logan would've prefered his long pajama pants, but tighty whities would do in a pinch. He shrugged off his motorcycle jacket, peeled off his shirt, undershirt, and beat up jeans and then settled onto the edge of the bed. The mattress gave under his adamantium-laced weight, but held well enough. "Nice," he remarked before crawling under the sheets.
Steve had gone rigid at Tony's side, but the touch of the man's hand eased some of the strain. He forced himself to take a breath and relax as much as possible given the situation. "I intend to keep doing my job and keep protecting people however I can." Obviously pointing out that he was actually bisexual wasn't going to get him anywhere.  "If people supported me before because I love my country and the people in it, then who I date shouldn't change anything. I'm the same person I was yesterday."
//Okay, so at least he knows it's weird,// Logan reflected as Scott compared Nat to Jean in the most uncomfortable way possible. He wondered momentarily if that meant his chances were any better, then remembered that he'd decided Scott was off limits. "Fair 'nuff," he allowed, leaning against the counter and sipping at his beer. "You figured out what you're gonna do different yet?"
The arch expression softened into something warmer. "You weren't figuring it out on your own. Boys are stupid," Natasha answered as though it was the most obvious thing in the world. "This one," she poked behind her at the chest she was leaning against, "hadn't even realized how often he was leering at you. It was time to make a move or end up in HR with a sexual harassment tag on his file. You too, Phil, so stop looking so smug. Honestly, the two of you are ridiculous."
"Most people call them Fitz-Simmons," Coulson clarified. He suspected Clint had heard them referred to jointly. The pair were young even for the pool of talent SHIELD usually mined, but they were also unquestionably brilliant. Some of the best tech they had that wasn’t made by Stark came from the young scientists. "Glad to have you on this."
"Cute." He blushed at the familiar touch but didn't rise to the bait. Phil stood and grabbed Clint's tray as well as his own before leaving them at the counter. "I'd like to change, yes. I do own 'normal' clothes. I never realized normal was so important to you, Barton. After all these years, I'm still learning things..." He threw the man a smile and led the charge to his room. Once inside, Phil scrounged up some jeans and a t-shirt and adjourned to the bathroom to put them on. Normally he didn't wear his t-shirts for much more than sleep or days spent in his own room. It was an odd and pleasant opportunity to be so dressed down. Even on nights when the Avengers got together for casual events and invited him, Phil so often came straight from his office that he rarely came in anything but his suit pants and shirt. He stepped out and held out his arms. "Casual enough?"
Natasha breathed a sigh of relief when the cell closed. Creed wasn't showing any signs of waking, and she frankly didn't care if he ever did, but she wanted him under lock and key when and if it happened. "For the record, no one cares whose brother he is. He's insane, and that's his own problem, not yours." She didn't want Logan thinking that behind his back anyone was saying anything else. She studied him a moment longer. "You know what he did?"
Tony wasn't exactly the best about wearing protection when he should. When he didn't *have* to? He wasn't about to consider it. "Well, since nobody here can catch anything from anyone else here, I'm really all about keeping this from being any more complicated than it has to be," he replied, grabbing the box and heaving it across the room for emphasis. "I think we can do without." He started to lean in for a kiss, but Logan moved first.
Logan crossed his arms and raised an eyebrow. "So... can't wait to meet that guy. He seems like fun."
"I think the fact that he believes I'm a walking time bomb might have something to do with it." Seeing that Jemma was about to apologize, Bruce held up a hand and gave her a reassuring look. "I don't blame him. He's looking out for you, Jemma." He took a sip of cocoa and slouched in his chair, looking a little uncomfortable. "It is a pretty big risk, you know. Spending a lot of time around me."
"Love the way you look all the time," Steve countered with a smirk. Feeling Tony hard and eager against him dissolved the last of his worries. Tony wanted him, was still turned on against all reason. It felt fantastic. He let out a sigh as their bodies melted together. He knew what Tony was feeling, that uncertainty, the desire not to push too far too fast. "I won't break." Steve rolled his hips to remind Tony just how turned on how was. "Promise."
"That's a good idea," Natasha agreed from the doorway. She saw Steve opening his mouth to protest and gave a sharp shake of her head. "Tony is drugged, vulnerable, and he can barely hold his tongue under normal circumstances. Anything you need to hear, he'll tell you himself. For now, suit up. As soon as SHIELD gets a lock on his location, we move in. Now, Cap."
Trying to ignore the sweaty, nervous-looking man in a suit - //Is that a senator...?// - and his downtrodden purchase, Logan raised an eyebrow at the now unpleasantly-familiar man approaching him. "J, I thought you said you were gonna to show me your specials," he said, doing his best to sound affable.
Tony thought about that for a moment. Being alone in a room with Steve qualified as leaping over an enormous hurdle. His former self-assured attitude still seemed long forgotten, and it made the billionaire feel as naked as a newborn. He didn't like it, not one bit. "Dinner's about all I can handle right now," he admitted. Glancing down at his fingers intertwined with Steve's, Tony felt a fluttering in his stomach and the first sign that everything might be okay illuminated itself. "You mind if clean up and make myself a little more presentable?" he asked self-consciously.
