— for a while. He'd been fantasizing about calling him 'Antonia' and telling him 'good girl' when he did something that he approved of. He wanted to treat Tony as a woman, as though he'd actually been born a woman, and that—
, Tony'd been overcome with such an intense need to have Steve inside of him — in places he couldn't even begin to explain — and Steve had felt likewise. He'd hoisted Tony up and tossed him back onto the table, and they'd kissed and grunted and writhed, and Steve had pulled the under armor off and pushed his legs back and, after freeing himself from his pants, pushed inside of Tony. Tony had gasped at a slight pinch of pain — he later assumed Steve had 'taken his virginity' — that subsided soon enough, and then Steve was grunting, panting, thrusting into him, and Tony was trying to pull him closer and closer, trying to feel him, needing Steve to fill him in some place that hadn't even existed for him two hours before.
"Square deal," he said and hopped off the chair. He went back over to the elevator and rode the car the rest of the way up to the penthouse—
Steve had learned the art of a fast shower back when he was in the service, but his fastest shower time in 1943 paled in comparison to now as he undertook what he supposed could be called a 'shower' only in the most technical of terms as he soaped up and rinsed off in anticipation of... of...
So, he told him. As he thrust into him, taking him, pounding him, he spilled out every unholy thing that had crossed his mind from the moment Bucky had put the stupid idea in his head. How he wanted to collar Tony, leash him, bind him, make him kneel before him, fuck his mouth without mercy, make him crawl, keep him loose and wet and pliable and ready for him at all times, make him beg for Steve's cock, make him beg to be taken, make him beg to be used however Steve saw fit. He couldn't tell if Tony was actually into it or not, but he seemed to be doing well enough judging by the moaning and the keening and the precome that was smearing into his belly.
He caught Jane grimacing, and instead of asking her, he instead turned to the just-arriving giant, blonde gossipmonger himself, who smiled a little sheepishly and said, "I did not think there was anything wrong in telling Jane about it."
Steve went over and held the door open for him, and he nodded his thanks and disappeared outside. "Who was that?" Steve asked Tony as the door swung closed.
Barnes grumbled and rolled his eyes, but Wilson said, "I'm trying to prove a point. See, Frosty here—"
Rhodey just shook his head at them in disappointment before he went back to cooing at the baby, and Bruce didn't even bother to make some lame excuse before he was departing for whereabouts unknown. Steve, meanwhile, had gone back to reading over the specs printed on the highchair's box, and Tony, the trinket still weighty in his hand, eyed it over once more before he reached out and carefully set it on the coffee table. He caught Pepper making her way over in the periphery, and he looked up and smiled at her, and he called out, "So, you're a traitor like all the rest of them."
"Whatever," he muttered and put his other hand to his abdomen, rubbing it, protecting it, trying to remember Steve's soothing assurance that nothing was going to get them. He wasn't just being used for a weapon.
He drifted off as he felt something wet and warm sliding down his face, and he laughed a little and reached up to brush the tears away.
"I'm sorry, Tony, it's better that way. Her office closes at five today, so we can go over and do it then."
Steve just shot Tony a look before he went back to the folder, not even deigning to respond with words, and Barton said, "Him wanting to pork one of you is stupid, but him being a vampire is totally legit?"
"Did'ja hear that?" Jim asked with a tease in his voice. "Your cookies are just as good as the store- bought ones."
bit — Natasha was still a gorgeous, red-headed enigma even after that), and they talked about the general goings-on of the world, and as they stood at the street corner and waited for the traffic to clear, the sun catching on Natasha's red hair and making it glisten like polished copper, Tony realized how truly lucky he was to have her — to have all the Avengers — in his life. Natasha was not spending this day out with him to humor him or because he'd promised her something in return. She was there because she wanted to be there. She was there because she was having fun, too.
She just smiled a little at him, the brush twitching some in her hand, before she went back to applying the makeup to his face. Somehow, Tony had a feeling she'd seen the text about the name, and somehow, he had a feeling she had chosen to read tribute into it.
Natasha's lips twitched just the slightest. "He has plans for it. Says he's thinking about investing it."
daughter. Also, three words— I. Hate. Magic. Hate it. Despise it. Want it wiped from existence in all the nine realms. That would wipe a good eight of those from existence, and fucking good for them. There's one exception to that, but again, I can't tell you what that is mostly because, yeah, you're not ready for that." He laughed and shook his head some. "You're so not ready for that."
Stark made some sort of annoyed sound and pushed away from the car, spinning around to face Steve once more. “Yeah? What makes you even think I
And hoping that Steve never, ever found out about it. Fuck, if there was one thing he could say for Natasha, the woman knew how to kiss like she meant it. Of course, that just meant he couldn't lord over Steve that kiss he and Natasha had shared back during that whole mess with SHIELD any longer.
Tony panted a few times to catch his breath, lying back against the pillows as he looked up at the ceiling and put his arms out on either side of him to brace him before he fought to push himself to a sitting position again. He struggled a bit, and Steve finally let go of his ankle and helped him to sit upright once more.
Steve just shrugged again. "I guess people today just have no appreciation for the past and no sense of hometown pride."
"Yeah, that's great, Steve, but all I see is more of my choices being taken away from me. I don't even have fucking autonomy over my body anymore, and you cannot even
"Really?" he muttered to himself and hooked the radio back on his belt before resigning himself to getting back to work.
Because it hurt. It hurt so much. He thought he could trust Steve. He thought Steve would be different. Steve would love him and Steve would take care of him. Steve wasn't just with him to kill some time. And he'd believed it. JARVIS was right in that Steve wasn't so great with the vocalizing how he felt, but he liked to show it, and Tony had thought he'd shown it quite well over the past couple years. Because Tony had believed him when Steve had kissed him and Steve had made love to him and Steve had nagged at him to eat or to get some rest or to not pull so many stupid maneuvers in the field — which was the height of hypocrisy for Steve, whose stupid maneuvers outnumbered the rest of the team's put together.
" and turned to press his face into the crook of Steve's neck. Steve just laughed and rubbed his back in slow, soothing circles and then presumably said to someone that was watching them, "She's just
She smiled and folded her hands atop her desk like she was trying to be as patient and gentle with her comments as possible.
Steve looked at him, pain and a little concern written over his face. "You think that's a good idea?"
, Steve. You cannot keep doing this. In fact, I forbid you from doing it ever again. You get wounded, you pull yourself the fuck out of the field that second, you hear me? You do not keep pushing yourself. You do not fucking
. The things Buck and I could only dream about when we were kids actually coming to life. But I just… I think it's because I didn't… It didn't go by slowly for me, you know? Naturally. It was there one minute and gone the next, and I think… Maybe it's just that I never got to say 'goodbye' to it. Yeah, I thought I was going to die when I put that plane down, but I thought that would be it. I didn't think I'd wake up seventy years in the future and just…be expected to pick up and start living again."
," and the opening notes of a song began to flood the expanse of the lab. It was slow and maybe even a little sultry, and as the lyrics began, Tony said, "OK, this is where we start swaying to the rhythm."
Steve stole a quick glance around the lab before he interrupted Tony's explanation with, "Thanks, but I can figure it out on my own."
Tony dropped his arms and stormed out of the lunchroom, and Steve rolled his eyes and sighed and tossed the melted candy bar onto one of the lunch tables and took off after him. "Tony! Tony, wait!"
"He insisted," Steve said with a slight shrug, and Bruce continued to stare at him in confusion for a moment before he turned to Tony and said, "Tony, you do know this is an
God), but now he knew for certain there was no such thing. No God in his right mind would dare burden anyone with him as their father.
Pepper led him over to the elevators, Natasha right behind them and Steve and Rhodey bringing up the rear. Tony did a headcount then looked at Pepper and said, "Where's your best guy?"
Tony made a face but didn't actually say anything to counter him, and he turned his attention back to the brat, who added, "But they're up the state in the other 'vengers building."
Tony just glared at him and shoved a bite of chicken in his mouth. He chewed in annoyance then said, "Twelve ounces a day, babe. Twelve ounces of coffee a day is A-OK—"
from all the shit we've been saying to each other? Haven't we been busting on each other the entire time?"
"It's none of your business whose it is," Pepper said as she steered Tony in the direction of the car.
"Hmm? Oh, like writing out a check but more instantaneous and without having to stand there and write the whole thing out then waiting for it to go through the system and whatever. Debits your bank account—" he snapped his fingers, or at least he
That included everything that wasn't the squeaky-clean account of the man SHIELD had listed simply as an advisor. Brilliant though this Tony Stark may have been, his equally flippant and narcissistic attitude toward anything he saw as beneath him was not worth his time in the least.
Bruce just stopped in his tracks as he came out of the kitchen with a granola bar in one hand and a mug of tea in the other, and he blinked and looked from Steve to Tony, who was rolling his eyes so hard he almost detached his retinas and said, "I'm knocked up, Steve. I'm not mute."
Barnes took a breath, hesitating and refusing to look at Tony before he continued, "They got him— They found him."
He didn't believe that he'd lost Pepper. They'd be OK. Maybe things were rocky now, but they'd be OK. They'd get through this. They were never meant to be more than friends, anyway.
Were there any support groups for people that had just had a relationship ruined by the appearance of a child from the future that was decidedly
The Red Witch stood from her seat at the table, and she moved over to them with a grace they did not think to be the provenance of such
He could still picture the moment — still see it clear as day as if it were playing out in front of him; that moment he realized his entire world had been stolen clear out from under him.
He stayed slumped against the door of the stall until he was certain he'd gotten control of himself, and then he washed up, soaping his hands up extra good and wishing he had access to a change of clothes because even though he'd been extremely careful about not getting any of his spend on his pants, he couldn't help but wonder if there was something he'd missed—
"Look, Tony," Bruce said, "I need to give you a couple sutures because you tore a little bit, and once I think we're in the clear, we'll get you upstairs to someplace more comfortable. But for right now, you're going to have to hang out here. Is that OK?"
Tony tried to parse through Steve's words, and when he thought he'd finally gotten it, he said, "Oh! This is an old-fashioned superstition thing, right?"
"OK, look, I'm going to clue you in on a little something. That wet stuff that people leak from their eyes? Those are called 'tears.' It means they're crying because they're upset."
"Anyway," he said, "point is, I felt like I knew you from the start. Maybe, if I really think about it, it was like we were picking up where we left off. If there's anything to what that screwball says about soul mates and, if I was listening to her and Thor correctly, reincarnation, then, well… Maybe we're more stuck with each other than we originally thought?"
"Which is not something I ever thought anyone would say about him, so again, I'm very glad he has you. Look, if you're worried that this pissing contest Birdman and I have going on is going to affect things with the rest of you guys, it's not— I don't actually dislike the guy, all right? I don't know how he feels about me, but I don't hate him. It's just— I don't know, it's fun." He exhaled a laugh and said, "Look, Steve— I get it. I'm from his 'old life,' and I'm the last real link he has to that, but I'm not— I'm not
"We've been broken up almost two years, Tony. You've been with Steve over a year. I'm with Happy. I think we're OK talking about that sort of thing."
"I agree," Steve replied. "I've been on my own since I was eighteen. Yeah, I've still got Bucky in my life, but not a day goes by I don't wish I could I could see my ma one more time. I wish she could have met you. I wish she could have seen the baby — and she's going to have at least one of us to drive her nuts until well into her middle age whether she likes it or not."
to know you're telling the truth, right? And, look, any of them start to ask anything nasty, all Steve has to do is give them that look that he has, and it'll shut them up quick."
Steve smiled while shaking his head and took the keys, the key chain was a ring with the same symbol of the pendant he had given Tony days before, the one he hadn’t taken off since he had put it on him.
Oh, and now the cleaning lady and an old man were seeing his penis. He said his apologies and went back into the complex.
“What are you talking about, Steve? I think you may have picked another language when you were away because I don’t understand a single thing.”
Steve had thought of sending Tony a message and tell him that… well, that everything had gone to hell. Like Natasha had told him yesterday when she had found out. But he hadn’t, because they were going to find out anyway and Steve didn’t want to be the one telling all the bad news, apart from being one of the reasons for the bad news.
“Bro! He isn’t the bird one!” he said. Tony jumped the counter and throw himself at the slim man they both knocked the floor, the bad guy first, and Tony knew he had broken the guy’s arm, then the big one took him of the floor as he weighted nothing and throw him at the couch “Bro! This is Iron Man, what the fuck!”
After it both sat at the couch, Tony sat first and Steve sat as far as possible, Tony looked suspicious at him. They were putting barriers between them now? Why?
Steve was helping him with the tie, hands a little too touchy and shaky, still not a straight look between the two of them, still no goodbyes.
Well, well, this was a ride! I hope you liked it and I appreciate every single kudo, bookmark and comment. This was my first time writting such a long work in English, so I'm sorry for the more than possible errors.
“’But’, nothing Tony. Is just as Clint said, sometimes you have to make some sacrifice. It’s our job.”
“But”, the dinner was burning, Tony could smell it, it may be a fire for all he cared, but, still, he stood up and when to the kitchen, turning down the heat and talking again while he went back to Steve.
They tied them to two chairs, one of them a computer chair they found in Kate’s room. They didn’t have to do anything else to them, the slim one started talking.
They ate a little, and talked a lot. Rhodey talked a lot to them really, Steve only stepping in when it was about work. For all he knew Natasha was the only one that knew why Steve was “out of it” as someone has said to him moments ago.
“I know” Kate closed the door “Okay, so here is where Clint and I live. Not on the record of course, but yeah. Okay so. Follow me. You’re lucky, we have two bedrooms. And I’m leaving, so you don’t have to fight over the bed.” They nodded. “Unless you want to, of course. Not jugging.” She looked at Tony “Well, I’m judging you, but because you are bad.”
“I prefer the later” he said, and as educated and petulant he tried it to sound, it only came out as a growl, as an animal finally getting his prey.
His own cock was painfully tight in his pants, he stroked himself through his pants at the same time he wrapped Tony’s cock. Tony moaned and Steve almost came, the sound so painfully sweet, he started stocking it and Tony was all but melting in his grip. Whimpering, moaning, even grunting at the bare touch. It wasn’t just anyone doing it, it was Steve, Steve in his knees for him, touching him, caressing him, and just now kissing his thighs.
And they were moving to Clint’s bedroom. A quick though crossed Steve’s mind, one about Clint not licking them fucking in his bedroom, but he didn’t need to find out, and honestly Steve didn’t care. They were kicking all the walls in their way to the room. Kissing, almost devouring each other at every stop in the way, at some point Tony kicked Steve out of his pants, kissing his tights and liking just once his cock. Going back up without another single touch. Steve was going to kill him. He loved him so much.
“May I have this dance?” said Natasha and Steve took her hand. They started dancing, in a little space near a corner of the room.
“No, Tony” he said, as sweet as if he was talking to a child “, the moment I can say to you that we are going to be together. We just have to wait a little longer. Come on, what’s a year when we have waited so much?”
Steve smiled. He walked to the street and took a cab. The cab driver recognized him and asked if the party was too much for him. He smiled and didn’t say another word for the whole ride. When he arrived home no one was waiting for him.
Taking the newspaper that had slapped him he saw the wedding had made the front page, just like he thought it would. It was yesterday’s newspaper, maybe Pepper had taken it from the buffet. That explained the weird looks and giggles they had gotten at the pool. It also explained that girl slapping him, he had thought she was an ex-lover.
“Oh, fuck, Steve” he whispered and all his muscles tightened as he cummed. And, fuck, Steve was swallowing, a strangle cry escaped Tony, and he couldn’t move for a couple of minutes.
It wasn’t hard. Well, it was easier than other times. He starting caressing Tony’s hair, and tried to think about the movie and nothing else and after half an hour or something like that he finally fell asleep.
But for now he ate, and told Steve how much of a good cooker he was, Steve laughed and said it wasn’t like he had really cooked anything. Tony smiled and didn’t say anything else.
In that little park, all around full of trees, almost looking like a forest, with the rain pouring in the leaves making a precious kind of white noise, and the moon trying to shine through all of it, they almost could forget and forgive. Almost.
“You’re right. You shouldn’t. Go back to your bright bride. This didn’t happen. You didn’t kiss me. You didn’t say you love me.”
Moments later someone was knocking in the door. And Steve was done. Readjusting the towel around his hip he was ready to shout and kick at whoever was at his door.
Oh, that was just fantastic. Spectacular. Just what he needed. Tony didn’t say anything. He thought maybe if he didn’t move Steve would think he was sleeping. But he was vibrating like he was about to collapse, what was possible.
Tony kissed his way down Steve’s body, as if he was dying to touch him. But he didn’t stay there for long “I want to come inside you, Tony”, Tony couldn’t say anything against it. He went back up nipping and biting at Steve neck, leaving a bruise he hoped would stay there the whole year.
“Okay” he said, but he added: “Still, I’d want to go, I just want them to have all the sides of the story.”
Steve looked at Tony, who was happily looking a Pepper, and felt as bad for not being him the one with Tony as for think about it. “No”.
“What?” Steve played dumb even if he knew perfectly what Tony was asking for “Oh… That. I said it back in the park.” He kissed Tony check, Tony turned to try to get more. “I still think this isn’t a good idea, Tony. You’re still married.”
They couldn’t look at each other for the whole hour Tony was getting ready for the conference and Steve for going back to his home, they knew what would happen if they did. And even if the press may take pity on an adult man crying, Tony was sure they wouldn’t take pity on him.
The groom and the bride had already had their waltz. Steve had excused himself and cried in the bathroom for as long as the song was sounding next door. He had to get a hold of himself. For the moment he hadn’t talked to Tony for the whole night, and he’d thought if it kept going like that he wouldn’t cry. Of course it was all a nasty lie, and he was horribly wrong, as he had already proved.
“We lost too.” Peter. His was the first name that always came to his mind while thinking about lost. So young, so brave, and yet… Death doesn’t discriminate.
Three horrible days went by. They couldn’t leave the house, couldn’t even go near the windows. Fortunately, no one was bothering Pepper. And instead of being America most hated couple they were some kind of America new sweethearts, two Avengers falling in love and fighting for the right to being together after so much pain “how brave”, they said in most of the magazines.
“A year and a month?” said Steve, “A year and a month living a lie?” Pepper looked at him as if she was going to kill him, but Steve wasn’t afraid “Are you sure you want to live that life?”
Steve was still panting; (had he ran all the way? Tony saw him capable of doing so), walking towards the conference table where Pepper and Tony where sitting, and the cameras where indecisive between recording him or Tony.
Oh, god, he was so hard he didn’t even realized they were already in the bedroom till he saw the bed. He pushed Tony onto it. Admiring his body against the bed as if it was a work of art, it was at his eyes, and Steve was ready to pin him to the wall, or in this case the bed, as he deserved.
“Then why would it be any different now?” Steve turned away, moving to the open kitchen and opening the fridge, putting the door between himself and Tony.
“I would love to see it” Tony said kissing him again, his tongue finally passing through Steve’s lips.
“You are hurting, yes?” he said, well knowing the answer, while he moved up and down to get some friction to Steve’s cock. He nodded “I could give you back the favor” he said, slowly getting down, licking Steve’s abs “or” he teased, coming back up “you could fuck me”. Steve’s eyes almost run out of his sockets. His mouth opening and his fists closing. “And well?” Tony said, biting at his neck.
They both played dead. As still as they could, waiting for some indication of who was behind the door, and then Steve realized no him nor Tony had asked who was behind the door.
Five minutes after, they kicked them out of the building and scared them just enough to make them never try it again. Then they called Clint and told them what had happened. It wasn’t the first time, but the other time around had been a lot scarier, as Clint was telling them, they asked him why he didn’t call. “It was my job and my problem” he said. And that at Steve’s eyes that honored him.
“After that we go to our respective homes. And we put on a show for a couple of months, maybe a year.” Tony looked at her like he was about to scream her to stop, but he didn’t. “I don’t like it either, it isn’t fair for me having to be the one keeping you apart, being cheated on the day of my wedding, looking at you two sitting together and having to be the ‘bad bitch’, they are going to call me that, that’s keeping you apart.”
“Good morning, Steve” he said and everything started to kick in for Steve, “I think the meds are reacting kind of weird on you.”
It was a long way from there to New York. And he couldn’t even go to his house. “Stark, what are you doing in my farm?” That was Clint answering, and not being concerned with the important part of the message, that was Tony taking his van. “And why are you robbing my van?” Oh, there it was.
They were all over each other, kissing, and nipping, and Steve couldn’t hold it any longer, he cummed inside Tony, who cried as he came seconds later, biting his lip.
They all thought Tony was and egoist that couldn’t get his head out of his ass. That was the last straw. They were going to fed him to the crows.
“No, you made your fucking speech back then. It’s my turn. You may have let your fucking heart frozen back in the ice, Cap. But I still feel. And, even if everyone tries to convince myself it’s only me I think about, that’s absolutely not true. I think of you every single day. I have done it since before I met you. I hated you. I idolized you. I fucking wacked it thinking about you. And that was before meeting you!” Tony paused, Steve was looking at him, his mouth shut, but he was blushing. “You just didn’t open up to me, never. I tried. God knows I tried to get to you. But you just think so badly of me you can forgive me for anything. I’m sorry I married but I love Pepper. I’m sorry I can’t live up to the image you have of my father, I’m my own man, you see? I have done things too!”
Tony hadn’t had much time to think, not only about what to say to Steve at that moment, but about Steve in general. The war, the death, the loss. Steve wasn’t there with him. He wasn’t there when he came back, why would he? Pepper was, Pepper loved him, and he loved Pepper.
He was trying to cook some sausages when he heard the door. Someone was trying to open it. As silently as he could he went towards the door.
“Steve, honey” Tony said, and Pepper almost felt to her knees ‘it’s because the fever’, she told herself, and she was partially right, Tony wouldn’t have said that with Pepper there if he could think totally straight.
Moments later everyone applauded, he too. A kiss, another one, and everyone cheered. Steve too, of course. A hand took him by the arm and escorted him out of the church and into a car, he couldn't tell who had done it, nor the face of anyone attending the ceremony.
“Me?” Tony said sounding angry, and Steve laughed, Tony hit him lightly in the arm “You, old man...”
“Boyfriend?” he could see the fear in Steve’s blue eyes, “it’s more than okay, for now” he said, moving closer to Steve to kiss him.
“I don’t understand Pepper, honey.” He did understand. Oh God, he was starting to understand what was happening.
Tony didn’t want to either. He didn’t pack. He left the hotel as it was, promising he’d pay for everything, and was going back to New York in a private plane. They had told him Pepper had done the same thing. She wasn’t going to answer. And now it seemed like Steve was going to do the same.
“Steve” the anonymous voice behind the door said. “Are you two high? Open the door I have not time for games, or whatever this is.”
“That’s tomorrow”, Pepper nodded, and Tony did the same closing his eyes, he continued. “Okay. Thanks for everything Pepper.”
Steve opened the door just at that moment. A lot of flashes shouting at the exact moment he stepped inside. His face was a poem, all red and undone, and he had just heard Tony saying he loved Pepper. Tony took the pendant in his hand.
“Steve, you-" Tony saw the pendant, for a quick moment he had thought that maybe it was going to be a little charm of the Cap’s shield, it would have been something easy to get and still a really nice and corny present. It was so much worse “Steve…”
“Steve?” he wrote. “You aren’t to blame, I’m so sorry” he wrote. He hadn’t think anything different for a single second. Of course he was the only one to blame. Why had he done it. He was scared it was his only chance to kiss Steve, and it probably was, but why didn’t he think of the consequences.
They were going to die. They were dying. Actually, they were already dead and deep into Hell. That was all Tony could think about.
“I knooooow!” The other said so enthusiastic Tony thought maybe they would stop throwing him or throwing things at him. He tried to get up “Don’t” they told him at gunpoint.
Because he wasn’t about to lie to himself, it was going to end sooner or later, and it was going to be a hell of a torture when the time arrived.
Oh, did he knew who it was. If it was a comprehensible response Steve would have run towards the exit like it was fire touching him. He didn’t.
“I’m joking, you know that, yes?” Steve kissed the same spot he had bit before, and kept kissing, trying to made Tony forget about the apartment, moving together, like, actually moving together scared him a little.
“I love you too” it was just like Tony has imagined, not so much time away it was Steve the one he saw himself marrying. Damn, he could still see it. It broke his heart.
It was the most passionate kiss Steve had ever have. Tony was kissing him like he had waited all his life, and Steve was kissing back just like that. Somethings are meant to be, like the song says.
Steve who had to stop himself, and remind himself that after all he was still a super soldier and had enough strength to tear Tony apart. But, God, it was so hard not to pump him till he was spent. He buried himself to the hilt and then he began to pull out.
“Tell me is not too corny, please” he said getting up and looking into his bag. Tony was all but going to start jumping of the excitement. “It’s just… A little something… To remind you of myself.”
“Yeah, for now.” Tony mocked kissing Steve again and getting up. “I have to get ready”, he said not looking at him.
When Tony knocked on the door he didn’t expect a girl opening it. He had expected Clint. Who was the person living there after all. “Who are you?” He asked.
“Hey now” he started to say, quickly thinking of a response, but he didn’t say anything. “Will you?” he asked instead.
“It’s in the side table” Tony said “don’t ask, Clint told me” Steve laughed and Tony did too. He tried to reach the side table without moving and it went horrible wrong, almost losing balance, Tony caught him “Next time I’d let you fall”
“It’s only a night, whenever you want to go, we go, okay, Steve?” Steve nodded, but both knew it wasn’t only a night.
They went into the hotel’s reception, a lot of flashes shot at them on the short way from the car to the front door. Steve started smiling again, even posed with Natasha for a couple of photos.
“Shut up!” Pepper threw the vase against the wall. “You kissed him on our wedding day! You didn’t think about me? About the company?” she shouted, and without letting Tony answer she continued “You didn’t even think about him.” All said and done Pepper stormed out of the bedroom.  The door resonating all around.
“Tony, what are you doing?” Tony shrugged, not knowing how to answer that question, he wasn’t even sure where he was. “Your wife is there, alone, go back inside”.
Tony recognized the angry voice, he had heard it way angrier than then. Still, he was as scared now as last time he had heard her.
“It’s your wedding day, Tony. In fact, it’s your wedding night, Pepper is going to start looking for you.”
“No” Steve cut him, standing next to him, looking out of the window as Tony was doing. “No, no, Tony, I don’t have a clue what I want. Apart from wanting you. I don’t even think it should be done like this anymore. It’s… It’s really hard.”
He sat up and put his hands out in front of him, turning them over and almost laughing in relief as he spotted the years' worth of nicks and cuts and burns in them. He reached up and felt his chest, flat and muscled and not in any way tender — not in the way he'd grown accustomed to over the last nine months, anyway. He pulled at the collar of his shirt and spotted the scars from the various reactor surgeries, and he laughed again and didn't think he was ever so glad to see so many glaring imperfections on his body.
Tony pulled away a little, trying to keep his voice relatively low in the reverberation and echo of sound that bounced off the old walls of the terminal. "Uh, was
"Sorry," he said as he crossed into the lab and moved over to the desk. "Clint and Sam wanted hot wings or whatever the hell they're called. I know how much the smell bothers you."
"Yeah? And when people start asking questions about where our kid disappeared to? I think the only other kid in the world people are more curious about is Prince George, and, look, I'm clearly not biased or anything, but I'm like a hundred and twenty percent certain our baby is cuter than that kid could ever hope to be."
"Oh," she said with an easy shrug. "Then Unca Bucky musta come home early, too, 'cuz Anna Tasha and Unca Bucky say we're too much to handle alone. They always gots t' back up."
Tony opened his eyes and pulled away from Steve's embrace at that. He licked his lips, tasting the last of Steve on his mouth, before he asked, "What time do you get off? And, no, that was not a bad innuendo."
been a while, and Steve had been so busy with his jobs that he hadn't even taken the time to give himself a quick jerk in the shower in weeks.
His melancholy wasn't helped by the fact that he was sore and bleeding — Bruce swore he wasn't actually hemorrhaging, but you could have fooled him with all the blood and other…weird stuff coming out of him — and tired and achy and that he spent half his waking hours being a drinking fountain for his child, even though, as he understood it, his milk hadn't even come in yet. He'd browsed the literature in the time he'd been stuck down in his lab and had discovered horror stories of nursing from other women, but so far, he hadn't experienced anything of the sort. Olivia — yes, he was keeping the name — latched on and fed without issue and sometimes just latched on for the hell of it, especially if there wasn't a pacifier within reach. Tony didn't know if that was a good thing or not, but it wasn't like he had anything else to do at the moment. The Avengers, last he'd been told, were wrapping up their battle with Hydra, even though no one had actually spoken to any of them since right after Steve had supposedly died. As far as he heard it, communications had gone down, and they were having a hell of a time getting them back up.
Tony turned to the woman that had asked, a woman Tony presumed to be in her early thirties. She smiled softly at Tony while she waited for him to answer, and Tony stared at her a moment, his brain short-circuiting a little at what she'd asked.
"It's part of the whole spell…thing," Tony said breezily, trying for nonchalance and hoping he succeeded. "Done as a protection of some sort. I guess. I don't know."
He wondered only briefly what that had to do with anything before hope suddenly began to overtake what had once been sadness.
"It's milk. It's made to drink," he said and downed the second splash. He smacked his lips again and looked at the glass once more. "Creamy — creamier than I thought it would be, at least."
fucking weight to put on my shoulders, especially considering that if anything happens to this petulant little sea monster I'm growing inside of me I'm shit-out-of-luck."
"I don't know," Bucky said, and Steve realized they were pretty much ignoring his presence at this point. "But I need something to cheer me up. Any of your mom's cookies left?"
He stood in the foyer, a hot chocolate in hand (Tony had said the size was something called 'Venti') and watched as Tony set his own cup of joe (also a 'Venti') on the table beside the stairs then went about unbundling Olivia from her overcoat. He set her on the floor that was covered in what looked like an expensive Persian rug and spun her out of her coat. As soon as she was free, and with that strange little plush toy in hand, she scrambled away from Tony and into the living room, chirping happily as she did so.
"We all remember New York," Steve said, catching Tony's eye to make sure he was OK at the mention of that seminal event. Tony tweaked a smile in return and turned his attention to Olivia, who was sitting quietly in her highchair watching the adults around her, and satisfied that he wasn't about to suffer a panic attack — not that he had in quite a while, but as Steve knew about his time in the ice, the memories and the fears that came with them never fully went away, they just...took a breather — he turned back to Thor and asked, "Has this ever happened before?"
Thor saw the universe in a way that Steve knew he never could — or didn't think he could — because Thor had lived many more years than Steve ever wanted to and had seen more than Steve could even imagine. Or could have imagined before Hydra and New York and the Not-Goddess Esmeralda. To Thor, life on Midgard existed in the blink of an eye, and there was nothing odd to him about just picking up and moving on once the people he knew had shuffled off this mortal coil.
"He thinks it's just because I'm bored with that room — which I am — but no, he doesn't think it's because of
He glanced down and saw that the way he'd folded his arms had both framed and pushed up his breasts, making them much more prominent than they'd been, even with the low-cut, short-sleeved button-down he'd borrowed from Pepper.
"Something like that," Steve murmured in response, the tone of which evidently didn't go unnoticed by Tony, who paused what he was doing and looked up at Steve, mirth having turned to slight confusion.
"I thought the whole point of this was to tell the world 'Natasha Carbonell' has been really been Tony Stark all along?"
"I didn't say you weren't," Rhodey said, quietly, like he was trying to avoid upsetting him. "I just said her real dad— I wasn't even trying to— Look, it was just a bad joke, all right? It was a stupid joke." He motioned at the pot. "Is that even edible?"
"Nice to meet you, Steve. I'm Tony Stark. I'm head of R&D for Stark Industries, which is just a fancy way of saying I get to spend my entire day playing with stuff. I like to build things. I'm really just a glorified mechanic. I like jelly doughnuts a little too much. I once knew this guy that used to tell me one day I'd go into the hospital for chest pains, and they'd find jelly filling instead of plaque in my arteries. I sometimes get a little too lost in my work, and I lose all track of time."
Steve just smiled, a little plaintive, and shook his head. "No," he said, "just… It's nothing I haven't thought about before." He went quiet a moment and shrugged a little. "Just didn't realize anyone else had ever thought about it."
Barton swallowed a mouthful of beer and nodded. "That's actually true," he said and motioned over to Steve.
Tony frowned at him. "Sorry, boo-bear. I know we had our little 'if neither one of us is married by the time we're fifty' pact—"
"Don't worry," he told Steve, "she doesn't hold a candle to you. You're still my favorite fondler." "Thanks," Steve said, flat but amused all the same.
with the child of a super soldier. There was no guarantee that this child would be in any way affected by the serum, but on the off-chance that he was…
"Slightly more presentable," the woman muttered then barked at her assistant to pick up a different swatch of color and material. As the younger woman did so, the designer sighed and muttered, "Miss Potts thinks I'm a
opened up in my workshop, and suddenly she falls out of it? Besides, I don't know if she's even actually my daughter at all."
But Steve just stared at Tony, warily, and the specter of this all being a Hydra plot resurfaced once again in his mind. Had he been stupidly lulled in to a false sense of security? Had he been so desperate to believe this was all on the level — that Tony was on the level — that he'd willingly turned a blind eye to what were glaring inconsistencies?
Steve turned, and sure enough, there was what looked to be a pair of white sweat socks tucked into a pair of tan boots. He grabbed them and put them on, telling Tony a sincere, "Thank you," as he laced them up.
"Eh," Tony replied, "maybe not so much? See, both those times, I was bodily violated and was kinda more focused on freaking out about that."
"Then why did you—?" He stopped short and shook his head. "Never mind. What time is it?" he muttered and looked at his watch.
Once Tony was able to finish getting her dressed (and then the coat and the mittens — she was a tough cookie, that was for sure), they piled into the already-warmed up car — "Remote starter," Tony had explained, whatever that was — and began the drive to the restaurant. Whichever radio station Tony had tuned in was still playing Christmas songs — again, he supposed he'd call it 'music' — and as they drove down the darkened road illuminated by sort of amber-colored streetlamps (and didn't those look…kind of odd), Steve noted the preponderance of bright and colorful lights strung on trees and around the porches and eaves of houses along the way. Only one house had anything remotely like the (expensive) Christmas lights he was accustomed to — those large, soft-colored bulbs. Most of them looked like they must have been those LED lights Tony had talked about or perhaps those tiny incandescents he'd also mentioned. Set against the snow, it made for a pretty and festive picture, and Steve again tamped down that horrible guilty feeling that said he should not be in any way enjoying himself. He should be back at the front. He should be fighting. He should be mourning the ones that were lost. He should not be sitting in a warm, state-of-the-art car and dressed in clothes that quite clearly cost more than he'd ever made in his entire life, anticipating a dinner of Chinese food with a fella that was practically his deepest, darkest fantasy come to life and a little girl this dark fantasy claimed was their child.
So maybe, because of that seemingly innocent confession, it wasn't so surprising that Steve was pretty good about being taken off the team for the time being. Aside from helping New York recover from the mess the power grid breakdown had left behind, the Avengers didn't have that many calls in the several weeks following the birth. Thankfully, the ones they did have were minor, and Steve didn't even feel the need to keep watch over them in the comm center and offer his support from afar. There was still the open business of Loki's glowstick and Baron Strucker, the inaction of both of which stuck in Steve's craw, but being off the team for the time being kept him from doing anything about it, and their trail of leads had run cold for the moment anyway.
"You're not talking about that one from the World's Fair, are you?" Tony asked like it pained him to ask the question.
"Think she's going to like it — you know, after getting the homemade stuff for so long?" Tony asked and crowded close to Steve, putting his hands to Steve's waist as he stared down at the little bundle of trouble in his arms.
Steve hesitated for only a second as he tried to figure out just what Stark was saying there, and he shook his head a little to clear his mind then said, “Someone’s got to bring you into line. As the team’s captain, it’s my responsibility to see that every member understands their role and position in the squad and acts accordingly.”
He took another sip of his drink and shrugged. "Looks good from here," he said, pulling the glass away from his mouth and resting his forearm on the arm of the sofa.
"Tony," Natasha said, low and even, and Tony stopped his thoughts cold and looked at her. She held his gaze for a moment until she was sure she had his attention then continued, "He's not doing what he thinks is 'best' for you — he's not acting outside of his authority or without your approval. But he senses — correctly — that you haven't exactly been giddy about this pregnancy, and he knows how much you were looking forward to going back to the way you were. The 'easy way' was taken away from you, and now Steve's looking into other options for you. Because even though logically he knows that Esmeralda was the one to turn you, he still feels personally responsible for getting you…
Barnes just nodded, caught out and ashamed and refusing to meet Tony's glance. "Does Steve know about this…
"What about you going out on national television and just saying, 'Hi, my name's Captain America, and I'm the lucky bastard that knocked up Iron Man.'"
Tony groaned and rolled his eyes. "Why would you even bother?" he muttered and sat down on his side of the bed. He grumbled and wiggled around as he tried to find a comfortable position.
He shook his head a little and turned back to Tony. "No," he said. "No 'but.' It's... Thank you, Tony. I don't even know what I could even begin to give you in return."
"And use those exact words, J," he said. "It's the only fucking he's going to be getting for a while."
Contrary to the shit Steve had pulled for his birthday, Tony made sure Steve and everyone knew what he was planning for Steve's birthday. Steve had the fortune of being born on one of the absolute best days in the American calendar to celebrate a birthday: July fourth, Independence Day. It was a day made for celebrations: grilling, fireworks, gaudy decorations. Steve wasn't one for making a big deal out of his birthday, but for the shit he pulled back with Tony's, the son-of-a-bitch was lucky if Tony didn't organize a fucking ticker-tape parade in his honor.
Tony flexed his fingers over Steve's shoulders, his eyes closed as he savored the touch. He was wrong. He didn't want Natasha touching him. He didn't want her involved with this. Nope, this was just something for him and Steve to experiment with.
"I'm not—" he started to say but then thought better of it. Tony would just counter him, and he would counter Tony, and there was a very real chance that Tony would wear him down to the point that Steve would just tell him what was on his mind and that...was something he really didn't want to talk to Tony about. Not because he didn't trust Tony—
He tightened his folded arms against his broad chest and nestled his head against his helmet. Yeah, that was a path better left untraveled.
had a penchant for fast cars. Honestly, Steve had grown up dirt-poor — there was no question about that — but when offered the choice, Steve Rogers, as it turned out, had expensive taste, and one of those tastes was for fast sports cars. He could still remember the look of awe that had come over Steve's face the first time he'd taken him out to Malibu (obviously when there was still a house there). Tony's workshop in New York was nothing compared to the setup he had out in California — the machines, the 'bots, the assorted pieces of junk like Howard's jukebox (that Steve, no surprise, had loved; Tony was actually glad he'd had the foresight to ship that to New York before that whole thing with the Mandarin had happened — it currently sat in what he'd dubbed 'Steve's Corner' of his lab), and the cars. Steve had whistled and shoved his hands in his pockets before he'd taken a stroll through the collection, marveling at refurbished hotrods and slick, new speedsters alike, and Tony had offered to give him one for Christmas, but Steve had shook his head and said 'no,' clearly horrified by the idea of someone just
"Yeah, but I didn't think—" he started to say, and Tony's face began to fall like he suddenly realized he'd completely misread the earlier situation, but Steve shook his head and amended, "— nothing. Never mind."
And then, before the guy could retaliate in any way, he ducked away and made his way through the crowd.
"Look, if I in any way thought that this could happen, I would have insisted on so many layers of protection that it would be like we weren't even doing anything at all. I thought if anything I would just get changed back and that would be all there was to it. I didn't think… I didn't think it would carry over."
Cap smiled a little, and Tony tilted his head in thought as he realized it bore some of the hallmarks of that small, intimate one that that other Steve Rogers had given him.
He thought about this a moment. Was she trying to say that Bruce's muesli tasted like the shit they put in drywall? Because she wasn't wrong, in that case.
"Well, you're always calling Jim names like that, but you never really use them on me. I'm just... wondering if there's a reason for that," Steve said and shrugged a little, finding that he wasn't just trying to needle Tony. He really did kind of...wonder...why Tony was so free with his pet names for Jim and even Pepper from time to time but didn't...really didn't have any for Steve beyond the typical 'dear' or 'honey' or 'sweetheart.'
He just nodded, staring at them like he'd blown a fuse, before he said, "Yeah, uh—" He coughed. "Excuse me."
Steve shrugged and watched as Tony set the rolling pin aside and grabbed the cookie cutters. "Here," he said and shoved them at Steve, "make yourself useful. Get them as close to each other as you can without overlapping."
Steve nodded, and he set the bottle down and reached out for a paper bag to his right, pulling out what looked like a couple refrigerated bottles of Coke. Steve handed one over to him, and Tony took it and said, "This is so gauche," but still cracked it open and took a long, savory pull of it, pulling it back and belching rather loudly after he'd downed around half the bottle in one go.
"—to come down here and see how you were doing 'cause your ceiling-guy wasn't being very forthcoming with the information."
Steve was in the middle of serving himself from one of the containers, and he raised an eyebrow at Tony and said, "Can't you do that?"
Come to think of it, they had been the ones to roll their eyes back during the whole meet-and-greet session when Tony had gone through their story and then answered the class's most pressing questions. Evidently, they weren't fans. Also, coincidentally, the ones Tony was convinced were using the pregnancy as a last-ditch effort to save their relationship. Poor kids. Howard might have been an ass to him, but he'd at least been able to take some comfort in the fact that his parents had loved each other. He couldn't even imagine how much worse things might have been if his parents had stupidly conceived him as an attempt to save a failing marriage.
Tony startled and dropped the soldering iron on the table. He looked up to see Natasha strolling oh-so-casually into the lab, dressed like she'd just come straight out of the field.
Steve shot him a look, eyebrow raised and all, and Tony shrugged. If Steve didn't know better, he'd say he looked a little sheepish.
in a monogamous relationship. The only reason we'd use it is to keep down the mess and…if you must know, sometimes that comes into play, no pun intended."
"I don't want to—" He looked down at his hands and flexed them, curling his fingers in like that could somehow absolve him of the frustration now thrumming through his body. "The serum, it... it repairs my cells — keeps them from breaking down, replaces the ones that do. Unless someone takes my head off, I'll probably...live a very long time."
"Steve was like the brother I never had. Had sisters. Think they're dead. I haven't…had the courage to check. But Steve— Steve's my brother, and you're Steve's best…whatever the hell you are. That makes us family, and that means we gotta look out for each other. And besides, I kind of…owe it to you after, uh…"
"Well, it probably would be a good idea. To make sure everything is progressing normally—" Bruce started to say, but Tony whined and pushed his head back into the throw pillow.
"Hmm…well, as I understand it, there is a suite upstairs with our names on it. Well, a fake name on it."
He stared at her, watching as her emerald gaze searched his face before he swallowed and admitted in a low voice, "When I'm home. When it's just me and Tony and the baby. When it's just the three of us, and there's no emergency and there's nothing that needs to be dealt with at that moment — when I can just...pretend I've taken Tony up on his offer."
"No," Sam said, arms folded as he shrugged. "Just saying I don't get why you'd give your kid to an old girlfriend."
"None that we've caught so far," Tony said with a shrug, and he could say that definitively because Doctor Ganford, who had recently made a house call to the Tower to give Tony a quick look-over (and then marveled at how quickly Tony was recovering from childbirth), had brought along a trusted pediatrician friend from her group, who set to examining Olivia while Tony and Steve nervously looked on. At the end of the exam, she announced with no small amount of amazement in her voice, "This is probably the most textbook-perfect baby I have ever examined."
Steve's face went adorably red at that, and Tony grinned at him and all but purred as he went up on his toes and murmured against Steve's jaw, "I think that could be arranged."
Tony scoffed. "Please. She's already heard it all the past couple of days. It's her fault I owe that asshole money. If she'd just been born a
Steve shrugged and shook his head a little at what he no-doubt took to be a waste of money, shoving more useless wrapping paper into the bag. "It's… I'm sure it's been worse."
Steve sighed and dropped his head once more before he looked back up at Tony again and said, "Do you
Steve went to snap back...something...at her slight against him, but before he could, Thor cut in and said, "The Goddess Esmeralda has many powers of which to speak. She can be most helpful in your desire to not be apart from your bonded."
“I know,” Tony agreed and pecked one last kiss against Steve’s lips. He broke the embrace and made to go over to the stairs before he seemingly thought better of it, and he turned back to Steve and said, “Uh, maybe you could go up the stairs and I could, you know,
"The only one she doesn't seem to know is JARVIS, who she keeps saying sounds like someone called 'Vision.' She knows Pepper and the Spy Twins. She's mentioned a bunch of other people I've never heard of. In fact, the
"So," he said when he was able to get control of himself once more, "does Uncle Hawky have a bow and arrow?"
But Steve shook his head some, his gaze focused on the slow-moving traffic ahead of him. "Maybe. But I don't think he'd ever want to deck you."
Steve motioned to his face. "I know that smile. That's the smile you usually reserve for senators you can't be bothered with or journalists you know are going to distort everything you say."
, in the middle of this fight, some crazy magic cosmonaut shows up. Thor and I were supposed to contain her. I thought Thor had her. He didn't. I stepped out of my suit to check on something, she saw me, decided to have a little fun, and next thing I know—" He motioned over himself. "I look like this."
Steve's hold on his hands had gone slack by this point, and so Tony reached out and patted his cheek. "Aw, that's sweet, babe, but I'm still going to fight you on that. The 'mother' of your child is a complete asshole, and he wears it like a badge of honor."
He watched her stab at her eggs and shove them into her mouth, and he thought about how, for as much of a chatterbox as she was, she'd provided no real inklings that this other him and Cap fought on a regular basis or even argued with each other all that much. Clearly they were in each other's pockets, and yet, it didn't sound like they had even begun to irritate each other. At most, it sounded like they nagged each other, which was just more clear proof that she was from an alternate universe. Not that he and the Cap got into screaming matches with each other, but he had a hard time imagining him and this Cap having such an easy, familial...codependent relationship with one another. Yeah, they were totally codependent and didn't even realize it. Poor bastards.
"Seems to have been buried. A few remainders obviously that I don't think will ever completely go away."
And he thought about Steve, too — that other Steve, the one that had kissed him like it was the last time he ever would, the one that had gazed into his eyes with nothing but love and devotion behind his crystalline blue irises. There were times, when he and this Steve were just hanging out chatting or getting coffee or a drink, that he could see elements of that other Steve in his. There were moments that he swore he saw his Steve — OK, not really
If there was one person in his family that was a morning person, it was his little infant girl that was no doubt awake in her crib and gurgling to herself — and there was no question in his mind she'd need a diaper change, too.
, was he? Yes, he knew what RPF was. Yes, he may have read a story or two in his day, one of which was so on-the-nose that he still thought it had to have been written either by Barton or Natasha.
. Steve didn't give a shit about his own life — and there were times in the past that Tony wondered if there was a deeper and more nefarious root cause of that — but had never expected his team to make the same choices.
doing it. I liked doing it for you. I liked the way you would tilt your head back and bear your neck. That's how I know you're gone — really gone. I like seeing that."
"But we'll discuss that later," he said and patted Steve's arm. "Look," he said, deciding to get back to the subject at hand, "I think they've already started their preparations—"
When he opened his eyes, Olivia had the cookie back in her mouth, and Tony was giving him a funny, contemplative look. "What?" he asked, not understanding what he'd done wrong.
Steve let his hand rest atop Olivia's head, and she went back to gumming her hand again. "I just don't think she's going to want to."
—and loved, he knew beyond a shadow of a doubt, smiling as he turned to see Tony coming back into the living room with two flutes filled to the brim. Tony took a sip of his as he held the other out to Steve, and Steve took it from him but then set it down immediately on the table and reached for Tony's as well.
"Yeah," Bruce said and took Tony's arm. He inspected it, turning it over, then frowned and pursed his lips before he set it down and took hold of his other arm. He did the same thing, inspecting and turning it over, before he made a slight face of resignation and set that arm down and went back to the first one. He pressed at the soft area at the inside of Tony's elbow then nodded and grabbed the rubber band.
He considered it a moment, staring at the gleaming gold, and was about to switch hands and slide it onto his left ring finger when he suddenly thought that maybe he wasn't the right person to do that.
Steve shrugged but continued to stare at the coffee table. "If we didn't have a choice. I mean it… It would still be safer for her this way."
"Oh, don't be like that, Tony," Bruce said, not taking his eyes off the screen. "Deep down in that shriveled heart of yours, you know you enjoy it."
But this time was different. He could tell from the way Steve was talking that something was different about his interactions with Barnes this time, like there was a familiarity there, like Barnes maybe — just maybe — knew him. Recognized him. Was aware of who he really was.
Tony just waved at them to shut up so he could concentrate, making a face and a little whine as he did so, and though he was certain that Barton was full of shit and there was no truth to what he was saying, he still… Well, he'd be lying if he didn't admit to himself, gazing over the array of candles that covered the cake, that he wasn't willing to take as much assurance as possible. It was stupid and superstitious and Tony felt himself to be above that, yes, but—
"You 'n' Daddy hafta talk about it, don't you? That's what you said when Unca Hawky let me play with the bow and arrow."
Probably not all that removed from how he had looked to Bucky and Sam that night all those years ago.
Steve groaned and ran a frustrated hand through his hair before he yelled out, "You're pregnant, Tony!"
Tony shot a glance back at the baby, who just stared at him as she rested in the highchair and gummed on her pacifier, and he heaved out a sigh, pulled the box out of the cabinet, and set it down on the counter.
She bit her lip and looked like she was about to cry, and she took off out of the room, leaving him to groan and chase after her again.
And at that, he leaned over to Steve's plate and began to eat his dessert as well, Steve sitting back and allowing him because he was a good husband like that.
Tony nodded. "That's the long and short of it. Now, if you could just process our form, we'll be out of your hair—"
Natasha glanced up at him and offered him a small smile. "Actually, you have no idea how excited they both are."
"Good. God, you're so good, Antonia. So good. You're so beautiful. I wish you could see yourself here. You look so fucking beautiful. The glow. The sheen of sweat. That look of desperation on your face."
He still couldn't hear anything, so he stepped into the hallway and called out, "Steve?" No answer. "Steve?" Still no answer.
we should explore our options and think about a leader that's not so…compromised by…certain entanglements."
He rolled his eyes and drummed his fingers on the table. "Trapped out of my own home. Seriously, remind me again why I put in a common floor that nobody uses?"
"Yeah, you kind of did," she replied before Tony directed his attention away from them and back to his own table. As soon as he had, there was a loud eruption of laughter at the other table, and Barton said, "Huh," and nodded his head toward the other table. "Sounds like that's the 'fun table' over there."
"You'll have to ask Daddy," he finally decided on saying because it seemed like the safest bet. He'd have to assure his alternate self he'd tried his best not to fuck his kid up too much, but it's not like she came with a user's manual or anything.
He held his breath a moment as he waited for the results to display, and it wasn't until he heard Steve murmur a surprised, "
Steve grinned to himself and took the rest of the steps two at a time, the sounds of grumbling and dishes banging together filling the background. Yeah, Tony was going to be pissy with him now over the dishes in the sink, but once they’d gotten the baby settled, he was pretty sure he could think of some pretty filthy ways to make it up to him.
"I know it seems like that, it's just… We care about you. We're concerned about you. I'm not trained for this sort of thing. Sure, I could bullshit my way through it, but I'm not trained for it, and I don't think Steve wants someone that's just going to bullshit their way through taking care of you. Not for something like this. Not for something that's
They could try it. They could disguise themselves and try to sneak around and get to the doctor's office without anyone knowing. But Tony was…tired. He was so tired of that. He'd been pretending his whole life. It had become second-nature to him.
"My mother was Italian," he said by way of explanation, and the others just nodded their understanding.
"Nope," Tony said and put his other hand on Steve's shoulder. "Not good enough," he said and rubbed it gently. "Tell me something I can do to make this better. To make you forget about this."
As he set his hands back on Steve's shoulder to go back to rubbing them, Steve sighed out a groan and shook his head a little.
"I'm sure he'll survive it," Natasha said and patted his arm, "but I do think it's something he should be made aware of," and Barnes looked at her and said, "Do I actually get anything, or is it an honorary thing?"
"Again," Tony said airily, "you're just jealous. It's fine. I can't blame you. Steve's a hot piece of ass that knows his stuff. Actually, he does this thing with his tongue where he kind of flicks—"
Natasha turned the tablet toward him, and he looked down to see a photo posted to one of the gossip sites that had to have been taken not half-an-hour ago of Steve on his post-run bagel-run with the headline, CAPTAIN AMERICA ON DATE WITH MYSTERY WOMAN: WE'RE  JUST  GOOD FRIENDS.
She wiggled her eyebrows at Bruce, and Bruce laughed and said, "Should I be insulted you invited me to the preview and not the opening?"

"I didn't know what worrying was until I became a parent," he mused. "Corny as it sounds, I didn't know what 'love' was either. Not to say I didn't love you, babe, but it's a different kind of love. You feel it in your bones — at least I do. Or maybe that's 'cause I—"
"Ah, don't worry," he said with a wink. "Pocket change. You look like the type of woman that likes to be taken care of, and I could take care of you
He stepped off onto the floor once he'd arrived, surprised to find that the rest of the crew had seemingly disappeared, and Tony was alone restacking unwrapped presents beneath the tree. Steve moved over to him, fumbling for what to do with his hands before he just decided to fold his arms, and he stood just on the other side of a wall of presents and said, "Want some help?"
about things, but Wilson… He's the only one treating me like I'm not something that needs to be fixed." He choked out a laugh and added, "I know I… I know I got stuff in my head that I might never be able to get rid of, but it's nice to not feel broken."
He went over to the elevator, mumbling something Tony couldn't understand, and Tony called after him, "Oh, don't be like that, pumpkin patch! You think we're adorable together!"
It looked like pretty much every gallery Tony had ever been in: white walls; pale hardwood floors; crisp, clean lighting; a very staid and clinical atmosphere. The only real sense of color about the place came from the assortment of plant life scattered here and there — a ficus here, a philodendron there. Even the informational materials presented about the show — the placard at the front, the captions along the way — were devoid of almost anything resembling color. The photographs were, of course, all black-and-white.
have done anything like this to you," she said and rolled her eyes. "It's the only one where you've seen things that would make you in any way open and accepting of it."
Steve blushed a little, but Tony sat back in his chair some and grumbled, "Jeez, when you put it like that, it just sounds stupid."
. This was— There was no competing with that. None. This wasn't a baby dropped on his doorstep, this was his own flesh and blood
"Well? Are you going to come in?" she asked in a heavily-accented voice, not even bothering to look up from what she was writing. "Or are you going to stand in my door and let all my heat out?"
He stepped around the couch and went to carry her over to the door — he probably should see about putting in a changing station down here — but the little results window that had popped up on his computer screen caught his eye. He was too far away to read what it said exactly, and he thought about going over to find out for certain, but he wasn't sure he had the guts or want to do it without Steve, and he looked away from the computer and went over to the door.
Finally, after what seemed like ages that Steve stood there staring at him, evidently weighing various pros and cons in his mind, he heaved out a sigh. "Can you be ready to leave here by six?" he asked, sounding resigned to the fact that he wasn't in any way talking his way out of this one.
"No," Thor said, not seeming to understand Barton's sarcasm. "The feeling of possession. It is part and parcel of the bond they share."
Tony sat forward a little, resting an arm on the desktop. "Wait, so if I'd had all of the same information but just had a different picture on my IDs, all of this could be avoided? You'd give us a marriage license even with the name 'Anthony Stark' on it."
"Oh, and those rather sizeable knockers you've got over there that weren't nearly that big a couple months ago. Girl."
Tony paused in the middle of attempting to unhook the cup. "What?" he said and looked up at Bruce. "I wasn't— You're not
But not this dream. In this dream, he was as he currently found himself, a woman, pregnant, and terrifyingly vulnerable. He lay on a table, his arms bound, his legs bent and spread wide in a set of stirrups, his belly heavy, and some probe stuck inside of him where it had no business being. He was in a lab of some kind. He didn't recognize it, but it was large, gleaming with steel and glass and harsh fluorescent lighting. He had only ever seen pictures of Strucker — never saw the man in person before in his life — but he'd wager that's who the German-accented man with the monocle was supposed to be. He and a handful of assorted others were standing around, talking to each other, looking at a monitor, all nodding their various approvals at one another. And then Strucker turned to him and flashed a toothy-yet-menacing smile and said, "
Sam shook his head. "Yeah. No. I don't think they ever actually made that decision, and no way in hell would they pick you."
Steve squeezed his hand once more, and he bent down and nestled his head against Tony's on the pillow and whispered a quiet, "Thank you," to him.
"Way to be a responsible parent there, Tones," Rhodey muttered, and Tony shot him a glare before he turned his attention back to the kid.
"It's because it is," Tony replied then sighed and waved Steve off. "Go. Read your pregnancy articles, you overgrown boy scout."
Steve cracked his eyes open and squinted up at Tony, and he tilted his head just so and frowned a little. "Tony?"
Steve nudged him over to the window, and he took a breath and steeled himself then went over and said a quiet, "Uh, Natasha S—
"You'd rather be surprised?" he asked then made a face as Bruce pressed down in a certain spot that made him wince and try to squeeze his legs together tighter to keep from having an accident of any kind.
Steve had been watching him like a hawk ever since Esmeralda had vanished into thin air, not letting him get more than three feet away from him as he grilled Thor over any possible exceptions to Esmeralda's hexes. Thor, to his credit, was good-natured about the whole thing, answering Steve's increasingly frustrated questions with patience and good-humor, though he didn't seem to quite comprehend what the issue was.
He also watched Tony take the time to help Olivia with her plate, cutting up the small amount of chicken and fruit and vegetables he'd put on it for her, and he couldn't help the smile that stretched over his face as he thought, once again, that Tony appeared to be a very loving father. He figured Tony had had a good example to follow, which was why he seemed to be such a natural. Steve's father had died in the war, and so he didn't really have any sort of experience with a father like that to build off of. The closest thing he had to an example to follow was Mr. Barnes, but that just wasn't the same.
"Agreed," he said and gave a firm nod as he sprinkled sugar on a Santa. "But I just...I don't think you should get too set on her going to MIT. That might not be what interests her. She might be more interested in law or medicine or music."
“It might be the only thing that gets through to you,” he replied and gave Stark a hard shove in the direction of a worktable.
To be honest, Bruce wasn't sure whether he breathed a sigh of relief or had to swallow his hurt when the little girl, Olivia, cried and ran over to Tony, her 'Papa.'
"But it's true," he said and swallowed again as he blinked the tears out of his eyes. "It's true. Maybe you love me, but you don't love me the way I love you. You're… And I'm the one you had to settle for."
Bruce ignored the implications of that and added, "Gestating and birthing his child probably helped as well."
that's why they left. And you know they're downstairs somewhere gossiping about this like the bunch of old biddies that they are."
"It's OK," Steve said with an exhaled breath. "If you don't want to nurse, I can go get a bottle from the fridge."
Barnes turned surprised and perhaps even revelatory eyes on him, like he'd suddenly realized something or discovered something. He blinked a couple times and said, "Maybe you're right. You know him better now— You know who he is now better than I do."
She nodded at the table, and the Council felt there was little to be done except to follow her command. They each took one of the designated spots while the Red Witch said, "Viz, please serve our guests."
They all turned to see Steve standing there, the large box in his arms, and a wry smirk on his face. Barnes chuckled uneasily and said, "Oh, hey, Steve. You're back."
Leash and collar in hand, he put the trunk back then ran out of the bedroom and down the steps to the living room, and he dropped the leash on the table and thought briefly about trying to pose in his most alluring, but the 'ding' of the elevator signaled Steve's arrival, and he simply stood beside the couch, hand that held the collar behind his back.
the cab with the guy instead of just apologizing to him. Surely, that was something they did back in his day.
Tony turned to Steve and said, "You know we're about three months away from finding them on the couch having really loud hate-sex with each other, right?"
is going to exit my body sometime within the next month, and no matter how it fucking happens, it's going to
"They have good information on them," Steve replied. "You should be reading these more than I should."
Happy pulled into the basement garage not long after that, and as he popped open the door, Pepper put her hand on his arm again and asked if he wanted her to ride up in the elevator with him. He assured her he was a big boy that could get to his penthouse on his own, and she smiled a little at him, teary and nervous and said she would find a way to make this right for him.
Tony snorted out a laugh. "Don't say that around the Cap. He and Howard were like this." He crossed his fingers tight to show Rhodey, and Rhodey made a face of disappointment.
"You shouldn't have to get used to it," Steve said with a curt shake of his head. "This should— It should always be your choice, Tony. It shouldn't be something forced on you."
"I can't fry an egg to save my life," Barnes said and pulled two cartons out of the fridge because evidently they had to have that many on them at all times now.
And above them all were Captain America and Iron Man, both turned to face the other and bumped together like they were kissing each other. Beneath that was a keepsake ornament from the entire gang, one that probably hadn't cost much but was priceless in sentimental value. He felt his face inadvertently break into a small smile as he took in the image of the little cartoonish mouse with the Santa hat sitting atop a child's letter block with the words 'Baby's First Christmas 2014' spelled out in a soft pink.
"I don't know," Wilson said. "Things have gotten really weird over the last few years. They might believe Tony Stark got turned into a woman. Would totally explain your sudden disappearance and the fact that both Cap and Nat were seen around town with the same gorgeous mystery woman."
Bruce smiled a little sadly and nodded, and Steve turned to Ella and said, "Thank you, Ms. Greenburg, for inviting us to the preview."
"I knew what I was doing," he continued. "Do I regret it? Sure. I wish I'd told that bastard and I wish I'd made him stay home with me until it was all over and done with. But I knew what I was doing and I know…for the greater good, it was the right decision."
"Bye, Tony," he said, his voice light. Tony could almost believe the Cap had sort of enjoyed their brief conversation.
"Hey, how do we know this isn't some elaborate joke?" someone else said, and Tony turned in the direction of the voice. "Like, sure,
The narration continued with more footage of the event and speculation as to what Tony's comments meant, but Steve just sat back, floored and speechless.
"What—? Jesus, I swear they put these things in especially for me. That's how I'm going to die. I'm going to get a heel caught in one of those things and fall over and snap my neck."
He tried to murmur, "Tony, no," in response, but sleep had just about won over, and he finally drifted off into dreamland, a soft, "See you in seventy, babe," bidding him his bon voyage.
"Anyway, Bruce, thank you so much for coming," she said, taking hold of his hands as though she was saying her 'goodbyes' to him. "I do hope you'll pass the good word along."
"That. I need you to hold that, OK? It's a very important job. I don't need you to screw it up. Got me?"
The screen flickered off, and Tony snorted a laugh and said, "You really hate that movie, don't you?"
Steve just reached out with his other hand and rested it against Tony's thigh, rubbing circles into the denim-covered flesh with this thumb. "So, how'd you finally get rid of him?"
Steve was quiet a moment, and Tony was enjoying the peace when Steve said, "Uh, so, what was that thing you wanted to talk to me about?"
Bruce heaved a sigh and shook his head. "If you can't figure it out on your own, I'm not going to tell you."
But Tony turned and tried to make his way to the 'jet. Only Bruce and Natasha's hands on his arms stopped him.
"That's even before my time," Steve said with an amused smirk. "And don't exaggerate. Besides, I'm from Brooklyn."
Natasha was there as well, throwing in suggestions every now and then, and Tony was standing off to the side, fiddling with his phone and seemingly not paying any attention to what was going on around him. Steve kept to the shadows so that he could watch Tony in peace — better appreciate what the past several years had done for his former lover.
"What would be the point of that?" Steve asked, but Tony just stared at the guy and asked the only thing that was on his mind.
"I understand," Thor said, jovially and good-naturedly and yet somehow with the kind of authority that spoke to his age and wisdom. "There are a great many things the people of Asgard and Midgard share in common, perhaps the most important of which being the bonds of family."
After washing up and getting his clothing situated again, Tony went back into the bedroom where Steve was just shrugging into his tuxedo jacket, bowtie already fastened. He grabbed his keys and his wallet from the dresser and said, "Guess we should get going."
"Hey," Steve said, and he pulled away from Tony and took a firm hold of Tony's chin in his hand. Steve met his gaze, and then with pursed lips and fire in his eyes said, "Fuck Howard. He was a pathetic excuse for a father, and I ever get the chance to see that son-of-a-bitch again, I'll deck him into next Tuesday."
"I've found that to be the case," he said and settled into a big, overstuffed chair. Tony sat adjacent to him on the side of the couch that wasn't soaked in chocolate.
"My Jane and I do not require the additional assistance that you and the Captain do. I do believe she was there to inquire as to how my Jane and I fare, but—"
Bruce sighed and didn't even bother to acknowledge what he'd said beyond the disappointed sound coming out of his mouth. Instead, he said, "Getting back to what I was saying, if I'm right and you've got some form of the serum in you, then it's metabolizing that sedative faster than normal. Give it a couple hours before you feed her, OK? She could probably handle it better than most babies, but I'd rather not have to find out, and I'm sure you don't, either."
"Besides," Barnes added and nodded his head at Tony, "I can help look after this one. It's the least I can do for you."
Rhodey shot a pointed look at him, eyebrow raised and everything, and Tony sighed was about to push himself to his feet when the table began to buzz. Olivia frowned and sat back a bit as she tried to look for the source of the sound, and Tony grumbled and began to file through the scatter of pictures until he found his phone buried beneath that family portrait Olivia had drawn.
"Wanna stay with you," she added, and Tony nodded his understanding. He wasn't about to chance going back to bed, but he couldn't very well let the kid sleep like this.
He made to wrap a towel around his waist, but he dropped it at the last second when he realized what he was going to do, and he stepped out of the bathroom, hair damp and naked from head-to-toe, and he spotted Tony over by his computer, staring intently at it and, thankfully, also still stark naked.
"Thought my publicity days were over," he muttered before he turned his attention to Pepper and said, "Where is she?"
Steve watched as Jim fought very hard to fight the smile that threatened to spread over his face at Thor's characterization of Tony.
"Decades," she said and rolled her eyes again. "You have a few good years left ahead of you. Trust me on this, Captain."
"I am giving them what all those bonded desire. They seek to create life from their love. Earthen males cannot do that on their own. I mean, quite obviously there are exceptions, but to these two in particular, I've helped them around their pesky biology."
Steve blinked and exchanged a glance with Tony before he said, "We're supposed to get one of those?"
Olivia huffed and folded her arms as she rolled her eyes. "I guess," she muttered like it annoyed her to say so.
She stopped just beside the introductory panel featuring what could only be a self-portrait of a gorgeous blonde with long hair and dark eyes — one of those taken-in-the-mirror photographs that people even in the modern day used for selfies. Beside the photograph was a write-up on the photographer, more gloss than actual fact, and Tony noticed two years in parentheses next to the name: 1944 - 1968.
But Steve just chuckled a little and said, "You'll be fine. I promise. It doesn't last the whole pregnancy, I don't think."
Tony supposed, thanks to the Hulk, it was the closest he would ever let himself come to being a father.
I wouldn't do to get you back," he said, his blue gaze burning into Tony's, their eyes doing a dance together as Steve attempted to drive home the gravity of his words. Tony held his gaze a moment longer then twitched a small smile at him.
"Papa Tony sounds like he's a much nicer person than our Tony," Rhodey mused and grabbed the first slice of pepper and onion from the pie.
anything," Steve said, and Tony read it for exactly what it was: the patented Steve Rogers Talking-His-Way-out-of-Shit-on-a-Technicality. Of course he wasn't
He began to pull up some files on projects he'd been working on for the other Avengers. "So, I presume you heard the good news?"
Rhodey muttered something under his breath then got up to pour himself a cup of coffee, and Tony set his mug down to pull the newly-cooked waffle off the iron. He set it on a plate and then set it at the seat Rhodey had taken just as JARVIS announced Bruce's arrival to the penthouse.
"Whatever. I guess the stench of cheap body spray will come out in the wash," he muttered and padded up the steps, groaning and holding onto the railing for dear life. "How the fuck do women deal with those fucking heels?"
The Councilors exchanged looks with one another, and as they did, the witch said, "If you wish the King to have an heir, then do as I say. Otherwise, the King will die childless, and the kingdom will descend into much turmoil."
Tony exhaled a breath and said, "I think you're worrying over nothing. He shows up the same as the rest of them do — when they want something or when they're hungry. You— You're being too sensitive. I knew you were having some physical sympathy pains, but I didn't think you were dealing with the emotional crap, too."
"Yeah, no," he said and reached out for her again. "My baby, my rules. Either you do it right in front of me, of you don't do it at all."
"No," he said with an exhale of breath, "but it's a hell of a lot safer than going out on the street and getting nabbed by Hydra or AIM or whoever's got their eye set on world domination this week."
have gotten you knocked up since before she was born," he said then frowned at the way Olivia fussed. "What?" he asked and pulled the bottle away. "What's wrong?"
"And already plumping up with the fruit of your bonded's seed!" she added before Tony was able to shove her hand away. She turned to Steve. "You must be such a proud Papa."
Bruce sighed and rubbed a hand over his mouth then said, "Give me five minutes and I'll come check on you, all right?"
going to be a target. Even if we'd just adopted the kid, it would always be a target. Because it's Captain America and Iron Man's kid, and every tin-pot dictator this side of the collapse of SHIELD would want to get their hands on it for any number of reasons. Because those asshats would rightly know that we would be the type of people to do anything to get our kid back."
"Whoa, Stark!" Barton said as the Iron Man armor clomped up the gate. "Uh…Cap know what you're doing?"
"OK, I was just yanking your chain before, but I'm actually kind of hurt now," Bucky said, and even Sam and Nat seemed to be surprised by Steve's possessive turn, both setting stunned looks on him. Jim seemed a little wary while Thor...
"I mean," he said, and there was a funny tone to his voice that was equal parts amusement and frustration, "that you're a goddamned adrenaline junkie, and your entire existence in life now seems to be finding new and unusual ways of trying to give me a stroke by pulling one dumbass move after another. So yes, you jump off of things or out of things or into things because you think you're always going to land on your feet except, you know what? You're made of flesh and blood just like the rest of us. Knock. It. Off."
Barton just made a face and motioned over him like it was obvious, and Tony raised an eyebrow and folded his arms and rested them between his breasts and his belly and said, "Excuse me?"
Wilson went to protest, but Barton said, "Yeah, it's not a boy, so they're not naming it after you, either. And I don't think you get why we keep the Cap around here."
"I don't believe that," Steve said, and Thor stepped forward and said, "Esmeralda, please. The Man of Iron cannot—"
He sat back in his chair and folded his arms as he watched the scene unfold before him — watched as Steve comforted and conspired with DUM-E — and, for not the first time in the last few months, he thought of a little, blonde-haired chatterbox with big, dark eyes. He'd told himself he wasn't going to think about her, and so far as Bruce and Rhodey knew, he hadn't. Bruce had brought her up just the other day, and Tony had been able to bluff his way through a game of 'Olivia
"Buck, I promise—" he tried to say, but Bucky's attention had since gone to something on the other side of the room, and Tony followed his line of sight until he found what shiny object had struck his fancy.
He just swallowed and tried to process everything he'd heard himself say. "That… They didn't arrest me for that? Or drum me out of the service?"
Steve glanced over to him, confusion and astonishment drawn over his face. "Who would ever agree to that?"
that son-of-a-bitch still following him, and fuck, what he wouldn't give to be able to pull a repulsor on the guy. Just one, and not one he would fire, but just one that might give this guy — or any other bastard that was looking to corner him on the way to and from the bathroom — the hint to back off.
" JARVIS intoned, and Tony rolled his eyes and muttered something about his child trying to sleep, "
questions about prior pregnancies. He skipped that stuff then went to the next section, which was all about genetics of both parents and genetic risk factors.
Barton just shoved a spoonful of cereal in his mouth and said around it, "That Trish Walker's pretty hot, though. You should do her show."
He shrugged some and dragged the tip of his spoon through the melting tub of gelato. "Only ever worried about how to prevent it, to be honest."
Tony frowned and went to say he was insulted, but he took a quick look down at himself and realized.
He swallowed but didn't say anything, and he felt a puff of breath hit his chest as though the man in his arms had let out a silent laugh.
He huffed out a breath and turned back to look at both Pepper and Natasha, who were staring at him, Pepper with a perplexed look on her face while Natasha appeared like she was trying not to laugh at something dumb but precious he'd done.
When they arrived at the location, they found a big, old factory up in flames, several presumed Hydra agents running around trying to save themselves, and in the mess of it, a haunted man with a metal arm who looked to be the cause of the destruction. Tony, in the suit save for the helmet, grabbed hold of Steve's arm before he could jump off the jet, and he bored his gaze into Steve's and said, "
Against his better judgment, Tony choked out a laugh at that, but he nodded and pulled away and said, "Fine. I'll lay down for five minutes."
"Oh," Tony said, staring at the portrait that screamed of untold amounts of love and affection poured into it. He noticed Steve was actually pretty far into the book, and so he flipped back through a few pages, Steve sucking in a breath of air as he watched.
His stomach chose that exact moment to make with the light thumping, and Tony glanced down and said, "That's right! You tell 'em!"
He continued to push the spaghetti around his plate, and Tony watched him in quiet consideration a moment before he said, "I always thought it was just the people that you missed, but it's the places, too."
Steve rolled his eyes but didn't do anything with the pile of laundry on the couch. He couldn't dump it on his bed, not if one — or both — of them was going to sleep there tonight.
Steve just blinked and tried not to give anything away. The sooner he got out of here and figured out where he was, the better. However, it seemed inaction was just as bad as any action.
"But I want you to— I want you to take me, you know? Maybe rough — just a little rough and possessive and—"
"Babe?" Tony asked with a knock at the door, and Steve cringed and made a face and said a prayer to God above for Tony not to open that door, which, considering what he'd just done, was a strange thing to ask God's help for, but desperate times called for desperate measures.
"Always?" He folded his arms tight over his body, by now having figured out the trick to accounting for his pronounced breasts. "Tell me, Ms. Rushman, does this imply there was a point in our acquaintance that you had, as the kids say, checked me out?"
Olivia cried out in delight and slid off Tony's lap. She went over to Bruce and grabbed his hand and said, "Come on, Unca Bruce! We'll play fetch!"
Steve just frowned at him, and Tony exhaled a breath and said, "You'll understand eventually." He took another gulp of coffee, and he reached out and grabbed some sort of rectangular instrument, which he pointed at the screen on the wall. The picture and the sound cut out immediately, the screen turning black, and Tony tossed the implement back onto the table and turned his attention to Steve.
"You just think he doesn't love you as much as you love him," Steve said, eyes flat and mouth pursed in a straight line.
Now, Tony had been naked before. Tony had been naked in front of Steve before. But the body he possessed now was not in anywhere near as good a shape as the one he'd woken up with that morning, and as Steve went to explain where he was taking Olivia, Tony ducked behind the door because…  Because…
There was a funny charge of something in the air after that. Something was up, and Tony knew something was up, even if Bruce denied it and Wilson shrugged and said, "No idea, man," and Rhodey shook his head and said he didn't know what he was talking about. Thor just looked puzzled and looked up at the ceiling when Tony made the mistake of literally asking him, "What's up?" He was certain Thor was being deliberately obtuse at that, though he was tempted to tell the guy that 'gullible' was written on the ceiling and see what came of that.
Barnes shrugged. "Used to accuse us of conspiring together — especially with trying to set him up on dates. Steve's ma just wanted him to find someone that would be good to him. I think she worried that he…wouldn't find, well,
" Sam said, and Steve could hear the disgust coming through as though Bucky had drawn up a mental image for him that he just wasn't in the mood to see. Or he thought he could hear it, anyway, as most of his thoughts were elsewhere, and most of his blood had drained from one head down to the other. He closed his eyes and swallowed, feeling himself getting harder by the moment, unable to keep himself from imagining Tony that way, bound, gagged, kneeling before him like some sort of willing slave to Steve's most carnal desires.
Tony just stared at him a moment. "This coming from the group of assholes that thought it would be a good idea to buy me a fucking bra that pops open if it thinks I get aroused— And remind me again why we need a fucking
The rest of the table had gone on the alert as well, all leaning in and murmuring serious-sounding questions to him. All except Barton, who sat there with his glass of liquor in his hand and said, "Hiccups."
"Hydra killed your parents, Tony, not Barnes. Barnes pulled the trigger, but Hydra was the one pulling his strings. They're the enemy here, not Barnes. Deep down, you know that. What you're upset about is even more personal than that. You're afraid if Barnes comes back into Steve's life, you're going to lose Steve to him. You're afraid you won't be the most important person in Steve's life any longer. I can't even say that's probably hormones talking because I think we'd still be having this same problem even without your…current situation. Only, in that case, you'd probably be down in your lab blowing yourself or the building up instead of crying into a tub of gelato."
Bruce stared at him a moment, and Tony got the sense he was already overtired and overworked but was fighting through it because it was his job to do it. "Look, I'm going to wager that you're not really that far along just yet and we have time to worry about that sort of thing. So,
"You know there's literally a handful of us, right?" he grumbled at the screen of bubble-headed nitwits. "Two handfuls if I'm being generous. How thin do you want us to stretch ourselves?"
"For him, that's the only thing I was good for. A science project. I know Howard was your BFF from the war—"
Hill checked her watch. "Just about," she said and looked at Natasha, who looked at Rhodey, who stared at his phone a moment then said, "Yep, they're good," and stood up. He moved to stand beside Tony, and he gave him another glance-over and said, "Lookin' good, Tones."
Sam stared at him a moment longer then said, "Yeah, we gotta put you through the same sort of 'welcome to the twenty-first century' crash course we put Cap through."
He blew out a breath, if only to give himself some time to gather his thoughts. "Uh…he asked me to go out with him, and I said I would."
He sat back in the chair and folded his arms, and Steve literally face-palmed into his hand before he rubbed his hand down his face and looked up at the clerk.
you didn't show them the same adorable bashfulness or the same wonderfully dry sense of humor that you showed me."
"Nothing," he said and sat up, cradling Olivia against him, "I'm babbling. It's late. I'm tired. I'm going to go put this one to bed."
Though even Tony could say the woman was no slouch, as the afternoon of the gala, the woman and her assistant returned with a floor-length black satin and gossamer evening gown with what was described as a having banded empire waist. This time, he allowed them into the penthouse, and while the assistant worked at pulling out the dress and laying it over the couch, the designer looked over the room, and Tony almost felt like she was sniffing at his design choices. While the assistant pulled out some little hand tool that she explained was a 'steamer' to 'steam out' the wrinkles of the dress, the designer stepped over to Tony, her metal bangle bracelets jingling as she tweaked a smile at him.
A grandfather with the appearance of a twenty-five-year-old. He'd be well over a hundred and still look exactly as he did at that moment. Jesus Christ.
"Good," Steve said just as Tony had reached the top of the steps, "I don't find them very attractive. I like my men short and wiry."
He turned his head as the sound of Tony clomping down the stairs caught his attention, and he turned back to Steve and whispered, "I will explain to you later," then smiled and looked back over at Tony. "A merry and joyous festivus to you and your loved ones!" he called to him, and Tony stopped at the bottom of the steps, looking completely sleep-rumpled and like he wasn't quite coherent, and he peered at Thor through narrowed eyes and said, "Yeah, this isn't Festivus, big guy, and under no uncertain terms will there be any Airing of Grievances on my baby girl's first Christmas."
Tony, through the twisting and thumping going on in his abdomen, smiled at Steve, a little teary and said, "Goddamn it!" and pulled his hand away from his drink to reach up and dab at the corners of his eyes. "Why do you always do this to me?"
"It wasn't always illegal. Buck and I would go listen to the bands play. Sometimes we hung out with them afterwards. They always had some on them."
He choked out a few more sobs and tried to wipe the wetness from his face. "I didn't mean to yell at anyone."
He nodded his understanding but stayed quiet. Tony was right, in a way. Bucky wouldn't want him to spend the rest of his life crying over him, no, but it
"Wait, Pep's in town and she didn't even bother to say hello to me?" Tony asked and didn't even try to hide his affront.
Steve winced away from Tony, pulling his hands back from where he'd tried to place them on his shoulders as an act of comfort, and Tony felt like an ass for the words the moment they left his mouth, but fucking hell, they
"You will be needed to nurse the infant until such time as he can be sustained on something other than mother's milk."
Steve's 'mandatory paternity leave' from the team had lasted only up until the point that all hands on deck were needed to deal with some disturbance going on down in Virginia. Tony, content to let the others deal with it, didn't get all the details, but so far as he understood it, it had something to do with human modification and experimentation, and Tony was half-convinced they were going to come back with evidence that Hydra had somehow gotten their hands on some of Steve's
Rhodey made a slightly hesitant face and said, "Nah, I'm good, Tones. Besides, I've actually got to be leaving pretty soon."
"Anyway, so, the point is that no, we wouldn't be getting our everlasting happiness all over you because that's the kind of thing we do behind closed doors now."
Pepper?" she repeated like it was the most offensive thing she'd ever heard, and the little girl looked up at her and said, "C'n we go to the toy store, An' Pepper? Daddy says 'm not allowed t' b'cause he doesn't want me t' be spoiled, but he doesn't hafta know."
"Because I thought Steve cared more about getting you back than he did having a future with me. With you, he gets back part of the life that was stolen from him. With me…" He shrugged but left off what he felt didn't need to be said.
"Huh?" Tony asked rather eloquently as Steve pulled him into his arms. "Oh," he said as he realized, melting into Steve's embrace as soon as his brain had made the connection. "You fucking sap."
Ordinarily, Steve wouldn't think twice about standing and watching as Tony undressed himself for a scan. They'd been together for a year now. They'd slept together countless times. They were officially engaged. But somehow, this felt different, and he averted his gaze as the last of Tony's clothing was peeled from his skin, red briefs that he slid down lean, shapely legs and kicked aside with the under armor.
"What? My ex-girlfriend putting her hands on my stomach to feel the movement of the annoying little creature that's growing inside of me? Nah, nothing weird about that."
He readjusted his arms, tucking his hands into his armpits and said, "You're going to feed our daughter artificial breast milk?"
"And Unca Rhodey and An' Pepper," she added. "They're the only 'ture ones. You 'lways say the rest are crazies, and then Daddy says,
He sighed and rolled his eyes. "Fine," he said and dropped his hands away. "I guess we…" He took another good look over Steve and let out an obnoxious and dramatic sigh.
"Yeah, except he seemed to be just as happy with our lame-ass Nintendo marathons," Sam said. Bucky nodded in agreement, and Steve groaned and sat back in his chair.
Stark swallowed again, and Steve felt something hard pressing against the thigh he had shoved between Stark’s legs, but Stark just fought to keep his composure and said, “I take it you’re the self-appointed  disher-of-desserts?”
"Oh!" Tony said with a broad and knowing nod. "Yeah, right. Avengers. Uh, there's— Our ranks have grown over the years. Started with just the six of us. The number of us that's called ourselves Avengers goes into the double digits now."
"What? No!" Steve said and gave a quick, curt shake of his head. "No, I— You're choosing to do this? You're choosing to stay like this?"
"You're full of shit. Stop worrying, old man. You're not getting rid of me that easily. Plus, pretty sure Nutsy-Cuckoo did this on purpose. The whole making-everything-perfect thing, I mean. Now, is there a bathroom around here? 'Cause evidently, I didn't pee out everything back at the doctor's office."
Thor didn't seem to realize Jim just meant he hadn't used the right word, and instead, he took umbrage at what he thought was Jim's disagreement with the sentiment.
Thor still didn't quite seem to understand the issue, but he let it slide and merely answered Steve's next question about whether or not he had ever seen this particular hex undone.
He'd thought Peggy was his first and last chance at a real family life, and then Tony had happened. Tony and his manic ways and his brilliant mind and his generous heart. He'd agreed to a date with Tony, which had turned into another date and then another, and then before he knew what was happening, they were living together, and he was asking Tony to marry him at two- forty-seven in the morning after Tony had spent the past forty-two hours on an inventing spree. He'd consigned himself to not having children at that point not because of Tony or because of the fact that he was in a relationship with a man but because they were both Avengers and it was a dangerous business they were in. There were no guarantees in life — Steve could definitely attest to that — and there was no guarantee that he or Tony would always come back. Well, more he might not come back. So long as there was breath in his body, Tony would make it back from the field.
"Oh, yeah, this doesn't look suspicious at all," Tony said as the doors slid closed. "You know what's going to be splashed over everything tomorrow, right? Captain America and his little slut spending the night at the Waldorf?"
by his high chancellor. There were some that had suspected, when the King was young, that the rather soft features of his face proved that he was a female his father had dressed up in disguise. His enjoyment at being
He stared at the radio another moment and listened to the stupid thing before he shook his head and went over to the tree. He found the ornaments Tony had talked about earlier — the ones that were made up to look like what he presumed were the Avengers. There was a green one that matched the plush toy Olivia had gotten; another one that had sort of a winged helmet; another one with red hair in a black suit; another one with a quiver on his back; one with auburn hair and dressed in red; another one that was…kind of green and yellow; one that had a black mask and what almost looked like it was supposed to be a metal arm; another one with red wings; and a gray one that kind of looked like that Iron Man he'd seen.
Bruce just shook his head a little and pressed the needle into his skin. Tony made a slight face at the pinch, but again, he'd embedded fucking
Olivia was babbling in his arms, and Tony, his back to them, said, "I know, baby. In a minute. Papa's trying to get everything together so we can go have breakfast and open our presents in the living room like the ridiculously domesticated creatures we are."
He used to do this, back in the day, when he was trying to entice Steve to join him, which worked almost ninety-nine percent of the time (OK, maybe a hundred), and he wasn't sure if this was one of those 'old habits die hard' kind of things
Bruce frowned and went to say something but nothing came out of his mouth, and Wilson nodded and put a hand to his shoulder and murmured, "I got this," to him then said, "I think what the doc is trying to say is that you and Cap, doing your thing, it's kinda like something we can count on, you know? Shit gets too real or fucked up, it's — it's like it's something—"
But she just blinked and said, "Nothing." She smiled at him in a way that was meant to be reassuring but was tinged with something worrisome. She took the espresso-to-go that was handed to her and said, "Come on," as she took a firm hold of his free arm and began to pull him toward the door.
And then, from his other side, Natasha's hand slid over his abdomen, pushing Steve's hand out of the way as she tried to feel the movement as well.
Barnes turned to him. "Is he?" he asked, but there was a clouded distance in his eyes that made it hard to read the intent.
pain, anyway, not having-a-hole- carved-into-your-chest-in-a-cave-in-Afghanistan pain — and he wasn't really sick outside of some light nausea here and there. His husband still found him attractive, and he himself had been able to find the appeal of dabbling in his more stereotypically feminine desires, and there was nothing he could do as a man that he couldn't do as a woman. So really, at this point, it mostly came down to principle: if Tony had chosen this for himself, it would be one thing, and it would be totally and completely welcome. But he hadn't. It had been forced on him, and he wasn't sure that there wouldn't always be some resentment there because of that, no matter how positive an experience it had been overall.
Tony let out a frustrated groan, and he tipped his head back and bared his neck, and Steve could only think Tony was taunting him — exposing the creamy column of flesh to be kissed and sucked and lavished. "Fine. Fuck, Steve. Make love to me!"
Well, it wasn't as though this was actual history. There probably wasn't even anything written on the pages, just empty shells of books. Or maybe they were filled with all sorts of Hydra propaganda. Whoever had come up with this ruse had obviously put some effort into it. Why not go whole-hog?
"And—" Tony said, backing away so he could continue his thought, "if I go out, then you've got to sit your ass back here. And if you can't agree to that then maybe you're not—"
"Yeah, thanks, Stark," Barton said and shared a look with Romanoff. "I think we'll be able to contain ourselves. And hey, Doc, you still didn't answer Nat's question."
Olivia's eyes went wide, and she shrank back at his tone and demeanor, clearly unaccustomed to so much venom being directed at her from someone with such a familiar face.
"Like you're his entire world. Like you hung the sun, the moon, and the stars. It's sweet, but at the same time, it's terrifying."
Bruce just sighed a little but didn't say anything, and Tony shook his head and sat back down at his worktable.
Bruce probably alerted to the disturbance by JARVIS. Tony steeled himself for…something… especially considering how Cap's jaw was set in a firm line, but to his everlasting shock, Cap just reached up and grasped him by the back of the head before he leaned down and crushed their mouths together, showing no mercy as, tasting of peppermint schnapps of all things, he all but plundered Tony's mouth with the most bruising, passionate kiss he'd ever experienced.
Tony shoved a spoonful of the mixture into his mouth. "You know, it's really not that bad," he said around a mouthful of food, and Rhodey rolled his eyes and got to his feet.
"You know, you're gonna get quoted on that," Steve said but did as Tony had suggested, and Tony looked at the man with the camera.
He dabbed at the stain, frowning, and Olivia continued to stuff pieces of chicken and fruit into her mouth. Steve reached out and brushed his hand over the top of her head, the wispy blonde hair sticking up some in its wake.
Oh, yeah. That was… That was something he'd have to do, wasn't it? Unless she was old enough to bathe herself. Was four old enough for that? She clearly could use the toilet without help.
"If you're not careful, Captain, you're going to find yourself thoroughly debauched before you make your way back to the front."
Clint shook his head before he pulled the tablet up and began to swipe at it. "Got some intel on Loki's magic glow stick." He swiped to another screen, and Tony leaned over to see what it was. "Seems to have fallen into the hands of someone called Baron von Strucker."
inside of him that was making him do things like that, wasn't it? Or it was all the come that Steve had pumped into him over the course of the past couple years? That was it. It was— He had too much of
He went over to the parlor and stopped in the doorway, leaning his weight against the molding, arms folded and head tilted as he watched Tony, with his back to him, point something at one of those wall rectangles. Colorful images flashed before his eyes, sound cutting in and out as the images changed. It reminded him of that television transmission he'd seen at the World's Fair several years ago, except this was in color, was clear as a bell, and had a strange aspect ratio.
in that way. He knew it wasn't about that. But it was about getting back a life he felt had been stolen from him, and letting go of a lesser life he'd been given in return. Because that's all this life could ever be. It was a replacement, and a shitty one at that. It was about getting back to the war and his pals and
Steve nodded then stopped short and said, "Uh, are— I mean, are we really going to see you again then?"
"I know, but still." He cleared his throat and met Tony's eyes again. "There was one girl. Gorgeous. Had a beautiful face and just…an amazing figure. Perfectly proportioned and symmetrical. I ended up sketching her a couple times because she was just so—"
And then they wanted to know medical history and surgical history. There was nothing to check for 'palladium poisoning' under medical history, so he left that blank and
Then again, he had seemingly fell in with a rich fella from the city. Of course he'd be able to afford to buy all those sorts of things and live in an area with other rich people that could afford those lights as well. He wasn't sure he'd say it felt like he was betraying his roots, but, well… He did wonder, once again, if he was some perverse form of a kept man.
"Tony, it's nothing to be embarrassed about," Bruce said as he made his way back over. "It's natural. It happens every day."
Bruce just looked at what was on the screen. "Yeah, well, if it's what I'm seeing and what Barton's seeing—"
"No. Nuh uh. Steve's not dead." He turned back to them. "You'd better get in contact with that asshole Barton and
Tony stopped at the door to the bathroom and switched the light on, and standing there only in a pair of red briefs, he turned toward Steve and said, "Well?"
Tony broke the kiss, slowly, like he was forcing himself not to be such a glutton, his eyes closed as his lips hovered by Steve's mouth, and quietly, like a prayer, he said, "Go out with me."
Natasha snorted a quiet laugh but said nothing and instead went back to painting the second coat on his nails.
"Papa!" she cried as she hit the landing and ran over to where Tony stood pouring himself a drink at the bar. "Papa, someone stolded my bedroom!"
"You know what I mean, though. I knew Steve back then. He's… A lot of him's the same, but a lot of him's different now. Not sure I know him any better than he knows me. But I know who he was, and trust me, I've never seen him lose his head over anyone the way he's lost his head over you."
"Oh, but you're so comfortable to sit on," he said but slid off Steve's back to sit on the mat beside him.
He tore his gaze away — now wasn't the time to become turned on by his fiancé, and jeez, he usually had more control over himself — and looked at the red and gold Iron Man armor that had been standing sentry the entire time they'd been there.
"You know they don't believe you for a second, right?" Barton said waving a plastic knife around in the air between smearing the other half of his bagel with the strawberry cream cheese.
"Yeah, great— Hey, question while we're on that subject then. Why me? Why do this to me? You're so convinced that Steve and I are 'soul mates' and need this more than anything, why me instead of Steve? Was it just because you saw me first?"
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry, honey. I didn't mean— I thought you— Oh, god, I didn't force you, did I? Please tell me I didn't just— Oh, god, please tell me I didn't. I'm so sorry, I didn't mean—"
Barnes grimaced a little and rubbed the back of his neck with his metal hand. "Yeah, you and Steve weren't there."
"First of all, what JARVIS failed to mention is the Quack Esmeralda is a fucking lunatic that, according to Thor, goes around blessing couples that are 'bonded' to each other — don't ask; don't know — with shit like this. She thinks Steve and I are 'soul mates,' and, according to her, every soul-mated pair wants to have dozens upon dozens of little Mini-Mes. Not only does she
some of these people beforehand and judged their ability and their character before offering them a spot on the team.
Steve just grinned and reached out for Tony's finger, and he grabbed it and pressed a kiss to the tip of it.
"Fuck you! They're called 'shoe lifts,' and a lot of guys wear them!" Tony yelled back to him. "Not all of us are six-foot super soldiers."
the count for the Hulk in this blunt, matter-of-fact manner: kills, manner of killing, etc. I thought Bruce was going to cry. He's a peaceful guy. Thinks he's a fucking hippy." He laughed at the memory of it. "You should have seen the look on Nat's face. I thought she was going to kill him."
"Oh, a mobile," he said, looking at the picture on the box. "An Avengers mobile," he added, recognizing the baby-fied figures hanging from the strings.
"Honey, I'm going to go out there and tell the world I'm Tony Stark, I'm a woman now and forever, and I'm pregnant with Captain America's child. I'll have every Hydra or AIM or god-knows-what-else faction coming out of the woodwork to try and kidnap me."
tight ass. You could bounce a fucking quarter off that thing. Literally. You can bounce a quarter off of it. I've done it."
Steve stared at him a moment longer, her eyes skirting all over Tony's face like he desperately wanted to believe but was terrified to let himself think it could in any way be true, and he swallowed and said in an even tone, "Could be a coincidence."
But he really had thought it was what Tony wanted. He supposed that said a lot about what he thought about Tony, but he was certain Tony had wanted to break it off with him but was too scared to do it, didn't want to be the bad guy, wanted Steve to be the bad guy. Would he take it back, if given the chance? He didn't know. Maybe. Knowing what he knew now, maybe. The 'drowned rat' made for a hell of an image that had been plaguing the periphery of his mind from the moment he'd heard it, and if there was one thing he had never, ever truly wanted to do it was hurt Tony.
Tony huffed out a breath and stood up to his full height, and he reached a hand out and cupped under Steve's chin to direct his attention to him. Steve looked up and met dark brown eyes lined with inky black lashes, the sparkle therein almost mesmerizing to him.
instead of come home with me — I, um, went to get in the car, and he grabbed me. I think he was trying to stop me, but he forgot his strength."
Pepper just blinked at him, staring at him like she couldn't even fathom the words Tony was speaking, and Tony thought she'd blown a fuse until she said, "So, you got turned into a woman,
can do better?" Olivia, cute though she may have been, wasn't exactly fighting it, but she wasn't making it easy for him, either, struggling to get to her toys the entire time, and Tony finally grumbled out, "
"Joke answer? Because he's Captain America. Real answer? Because this sort of shit keeps happening to us, and it's becoming less of an 'Oh my god! What's going on?' and more of a 'Jesus Christ, what's going on
He pulled open the door and held it open for Tony, goofy, assured grin on his stupid face, and Tony scowled at him and stepped into the waiting room.
person she hasn't actually talked about is golden-boy Cap, who, from what I can gather, is too good to hang out with our little band of heroes."
"That all depends on what you ask for," she replied, smiling up at him in that snide way that she had about her.
"Nope, not happening," Steve cut in before Tony could finish his thought, jolting him just a little to stop his words in their tracks. "No crashing into anything. I can't—" He stopped short and shivered, not allowing himself to finish the thought.
Steve was so good about everything, honestly. He was sure that, deep down, the man was in a constant state of panic and incomprehension, but he never let it show on the surface. No, Steve was always steadfast and sure and confident and commanding. He looked at Tony's predicament the same way he would look at any problem: search for a solution and find a way to make it right, no drama, no theatrics, just plain, old-fashioned gumption and guts. Though he wasn't proud of it, he could admit to himself that he relied on Steve, and he relied on him a lot. He leaned on him, he depended upon him, and he looked to him, honestly, to make it right. He looked to Steve maybe not to change him back — Steve, sadly, did not have that power — but at least make it bearable. He was terrified of doing this, he was terrified of going through it, but he could manage it somehow with Steve by his side. And Steve, well, Steve provided all of that and then some.
He played with his phone, checking headlines and stock prices and any text messages he might have gotten. Only one from Barton that asked «
"We have reason to believe there are several Hydra factions in operation at-current, all of them planning for something within the next few weeks or months," Natasha explained, and Tony only realized then that she had a 'serious business' voice the same way that Steve did.
Jim just nodded, and Bucky sighed and said, "All right, this is the last time I'm gonna ask. Give me that baby."
Steve just stood up to his full height, and Tony glowered a bit as Steve clearly tried to point out the discrepancy in their heights.
Ella laughed and clutched a hand at her chest. "Oh, my goodness," she said, blushing, "never in my wildest dreams did I ever think I'd get a 'thank you' from Captain America of all people!"
"No, you're right, sweet pea. War Machine is totally awesome. I mean, not as awesome as Iron Man, but still awesome. Mostly. I mean, nobody ever asks for a
He stood patiently and waited for JARVIS to complete his scan, and once he had, he threw his clothes back on and sat down at the computer to read over the results just as JARVIS was announcing them.
After they'd left, Steve looked up from where he'd so thoroughly inspected the container of formula, reading every single word printed on the label, and said, "It can't be too bad, right?"
Tony just stood there, kneading his hands together, not daring to look at any of the three that were staring at him. He swallowed and fumbled for something to do with his hands before he finally settled on folding his arms, and he held them tight in that space between his breasts and his belly and took several short breaths, some awful feeling welling up from within. He clenched his jaw and blinked repeatedly to dispel the tears that threatened to fall, and when Bruce tried to say once again how sorry he was, Tony snapped out, "
Steve closed up the cupboard, and he came back into the bedroom, the tin of polish and a rag in-hand, and said, "My mother raised me right."
Tony smiled at him and stroked his face. "Yeah, babe. I'll help him. I'll try to fix it for him. I know how much it would mean to you."
Olivia groaned and looked up at him from where she sat by Rhodey. Evidently, she'd been showing all of her 'pitchers' to him. "Oh, Papa! I don't wanna! 'm not sleepy!"
Steve didn't wander back into the kitchen until Tony had finished the fifth waffle and had also browned some sausage links he'd found for good measure. Steve carefully, and seemingly reluctantly, set Olivia back down in her carrier then turned it so that when he took his usual spot at the island, he could watch her while he ate and she slept. He sat, barely taking his eyes off the baby as he settled in, giving only the barest of glances to the food as he pulled two waffles and half-a-dozen sausage links onto his plate. He drenched everything in maple syrup, haphazardly drizzling the sticky substance from one side of his plate to the other, and Tony watched him a moment before he said, "You know, you can take your eyes off her for a moment. She's not going to go far."
"A fucking killjoy," Bucky cut in as he sat back down at the desk. "One of you go on rounds. I already checked the front by the ATM. Six o'clock and all's well."
"He's a menace and an embarrassment, and I swear to god, one of these days, I'm dumping him on Queens College's doorstep and running the other way."
didn't seem like something he'd been in the middle of doing just twenty minutes before. He'd given birth. Because he was pregnant. Because his childhood hero — Captain America himself — had knocked him up. Because he was physically a woman.
Every single man — his own husband included — sat or stood there looking utterly perplexed and nervous about what was happening. Every man save for Barton, who nodded to Natasha, who nodded in return and got up from her chair.
"Not all of you," she said with a flat smile, but Tony could tell by her tone that she'd been on the receiving end of such comments over the years. She directed a knowing look at Barton and said, "There is a time and a place."
"What? No! Are you kidding? Embarrass the shit out of the guy! He's never had anyone to make a big deal over him like this before. He deserves it. You're good—"
Tony went to protest his use of qualifiers, but Steve cut in before he could and said, "Look, sir, I know how this probably looks, but considering there was an alien wormhole over midtown two years ago, is this really so out of the ordinary?"
"He needs more ammunition for his pen," Tony said and sipped his beverage through the swizzle stick it came with.
He heaved out an exaggerated sigh and sat back up. "I am a clusterfuck of epic proportions," he said and flicked through a few screens on the monitor beside him. He only half-paid attention to what any of them were. "I should come with a warning label. Caution: prolonged exposure may lead to jamming an ice pick in eye socket. Or something like that."
"Honey, it's true. It's very, very true. You still think you're the underdog. You still think you have to prove that you're valuable to the world. Trust me, you're valuable. You're wanted, and you're needed. Look, I like Captain America as much as the next guy. He's awesome. But given a choice between him and Steve Rogers? I pick Steve Rogers every time."
Steve swallowed and nodded, and he broke their gaze to glance down to Tony's crotch, and he picked his hand up and reached down to brush the knuckle of his index finger against the sensitive, but cloth-covered slit of his labia.
She rolled her eyes again and huffed. "Yes, Unca Bruce!" she said with more haughtiness in her voice than any four-year-old had a right to muster. "We all do, 'member?"
"Oh, right. OK, look, I know I probably shouldn't say this given the weirdness of the situation, but, honest to god, Steve. I can't help it. I feel like a goddess. I feel like a goddamned goddess of fertility like this."
the company, Tony. You still own it. The Board…they're anxious. They're afraid the company's actually being overseen by a dead man. It's… It's not sitting well with them."
He bid a hasty retreat, and like the flip of a switch, Natasha had slid off his lap and taken her seat once again, sipping at her cosmo like the last few minutes hadn't happened. Tony just swallowed and tried to fix the clothes Natasha had pulled askew during her little act, and Pepper was blinking and pressing her hands to her pink-tinged cheeks as she said, "I'm suddenly questioning everything I had ever assumed about myself."
"Will you still love me? I mean, when I'm still in this form even after… You'll still be attracted to me, right?"
Natasha took the seat next to Barton while Bruce took the seat on Barton's other side. That left two seats on either side of Tony, one of which was Steve's and the other, if he was remembering Pepper's instructions the right way, was for Rhodey.
They loaded up plates at the buffet and then sat down to dig in, and though it wasn't the usual kind of Christmas fare Steve was used to, it was good all the same. True to what Tony had said earlier, the General Tso's chicken was pretty damned good, and he ended up with seconds and then thirds of that.
"I didn't pee myself," he muttered. "I am now producing milk for the nourishment for our child. Evidently, I'm producing
She arched a perfectly shaped eyebrow. "Is that what it is? You feel even with your bonded that you need to earn your keep?"
And to drive his point home, he snapped his fingers loud and theatrically before sitting back in his chair once more.
, Tony realized last night that, to some degree, nothing beat pleasuring yourself with your own hand.
He supposed that should have been his first red flag. Maybe that Tony had just rounded up, but so far as he understood it, he'd been gone for just over sixty-seven years, not seventy. Still, the moment he'd understood himself to be several decades into the future, he'd thought, perhaps, that it was true, that everything Tony had told him and shown him was true — or would be true. Yes, he'd lost his entire world, but what he would get in return — a love unlike anything he'd ever known, a
So, one by one, the couples went around the room and introduced themselves and their unborn tax exemption (by name — always by name) and told the story of how they'd come to be so blessed to be able to conceive their child. Some had been trying for years, some for months, and then there were the ones that Tony was convinced by their demeanor viewed it as a last-ditch attempt to save a crumbling relationship. Some had done it the old-fashioned way, some had used IVF, and some had even had to use things like thermometers and mucous testers (what in the
“Steve, I love you” it sounded so different from the other one. It sounded real, soft and heartbroken. Steve hated it.
“Then why didn’t you say it back then! Before this!” he gesticulated at everything. “Oh good Lord, Tony. I love you too, don’t you understand? You’re breaking me.”
He sent a message to Clint: “I’m taking your van from the farm. Sorry. A new one will come soon enough.” Clint didn’t answer in time for him not to “make his way” into the van. He was weirdly proud of being able to rob any type of car.
Tony is born with blue flowers covering his skin. Under his right knee, over his left forearm, on the lower part of his stomach… There are too many of them and Tony spends hours memorising them, tracing the patterns they make with the pads of his fingers.
“Even with all that, you just feel it. In your head and chest and heart. You know when you see ‘em for the first time.”
. He gives one last look to his blank hands before closing his eyes; for the first time, he is grateful he has no one to leave behind.
When Steve first gets the chance to look at his body after the serum (when his chest isn’t heaving from running, when he hasn’t just chased a madman, when he hasn’t just seen a good man
also, I think that Steve's father wasn't really a great man...? but for purposes of this fic he will be, pls and thnk u.
At some point when Tony is forty years old, his soulmarks stop feeling ice cold. Tony, currently dying of palladium poisoning, doesn’t notice it.
He has never felt a new one appear, but the flowers he was born with remain: vibrant and colourful and, strangest of all, ice cold to the touch.
To Steve’s surprise, all of them have soulmarks on their skin, and even Dum Dum and Gabe have already met theirs.
“You idiot.” Rhodey shoves him with one shoulder even as he helps him sit upright. “Because I care.”
