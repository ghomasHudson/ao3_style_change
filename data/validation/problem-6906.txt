, Nat’s mind helpfully supplied - and she did indeed have wings, buzzing, fluttering things of beauty. They retracted and disappeared entirely when she turned around, and Nat had a spark of recognition when she saw her face.
The edges of her vision began to blur, a blackness, the darkest black in the universe, began to seep in, and she stumbled, catching herself against a wall.
“Myself, the other AIs and the bots, of course,” FRIDAY replied, then added in a gentler tone, “and a number of humans who would very much like to see her again.”
Sam flicked his gaze to Toni in what she surmised was wariness. Taking pity on him, Toni sighed and rolled her eyes.
Before she could slip into something maudlin Kamala came out in the suit, beaming at all of them. At some point she'd cut up a piece of blue fabric into a domino mask and placed it over her eyes as well and Toni and Hope shared an exasperated and resigned look from across the kitchen. They all offered the necessary oohs and aahs and Kamala preened under all the attention.
“We’ll start administering the sedative on my count. Just as we practiced, Sergeant Barnes. Start counting backwards from ten whenever you’re ready.”
“I like that name a lot,” Laura said warmly. “It’s a strong name. A worthy name for a worthy woman.”
— and Cloak slipped from her shoulders like water, forcing her to turn back around while he did so. Then he swiftly darted behind Stephen and shoved him towards her until she and Stephen were standing there awkwardly, a scant few inches of space between their bodies.
Toni narrowed her eyes, her shoulders tense and Vision was hovering by her side in less than a second while Nat got onto the comms and started murmuring orders about increasing security and double-checking for any more HYDRA threats. Only Coulson looked unaffected,
. “To look at your families. To look at those whom you love.” She thought of Hope and Stephen and wondered what their brilliant minds were thinking. Whether Pepper had that soft smile on her face, whether Happy was clasping his hands tightly in front of him the way he did whenever he was excited about something. She thought of Peter and Harley and Kamala and Shuri wished and wished and wished she had the emotional capacity to show them how much she cared about them, how much she looked forward to seeing them become the people she knew they could be. “And I ask you to ask yourselves. How would you protect them from the what’s to come? Whether it falls out of the sky or whether it’s
Toni only got to test the Mark 0 once before shit hit the fan the very next day and FRIDAY was alerting them all about a major blackout in New York City and the Roxxon Energy Corp building right in the center of it. Also, the building and the ones next to it were on fire and there were reports of men in black suits holding people hostage in the upper R&D floors.
When he opened his eyes and looked at her, at the faint glimmer of hope in her green eyes that was slowly dwindling, he knew he couldn’t hold back any longer.
to work with just one spell.” She didn’t need to look at him to know he understood. “Just the one. And it traps the energy from the spell inside a continuous loop. You only need to cast the spell once and the energy will continuously be recycled from the containment unit, through the emitter, into your hands and back again.”
I firmly stand by the notion that Tony loved his mother and that Maria loved him back fiercely. But I also think Maria had her own problems that kept her from being the mother she should've been. Still, I think she and Tony shared a bond, which was made pretty clear in CACW, so it's my hope to emulate that here in this fic as well in future.
Toni’s life settled into a new routine at the Barton farm. Once she’d relayed all her existing ideas to Laura, she found an adept sounding board, who tossed questions back just as quickly as Toni answered them. She even offered ideas of her own. Once Toni had pulled up the Accords with her first series of amendments and notes, Laura had immersed herself in it, adding comments and propositions in far better script than Toni’s chicken scratches.
“I’m coming back, Toni,” Natasha told her quietly. “I’ll go, say my piece and a couple more and I’ll be back. And when I do you can tell me everything that happened with Ellis. And after that it’ll be time for Phase Two.”
Steve’s arms and thighs were already burning from the continued assault and his bruises barely healed before others took their place. He got into position, cleared his mind as best he could, and moved when they attacked.
It appeared before she’d even finished speaking and at any other time Toni might have paid more attention to that but right now she had other things to think about.
She stopped and Vision remained silent. Something strange and foreign stirred in his chest, in the place where he imagined his heart might be if he’d been born human.
There were reminders of Clint wherever she went. On her second day at the farm she found a pair of Clint’s gloves, the blue ones he’d worn when he’d accompanied her to one of her factory warehouses to hang out while she presented a new project to her mechanics.
Eight hours later and Wakanda became the first country to publicly declare the Rogue Avengers pardoned and welcomed in Wakanda. Not long after that thirty-eight countries had declared their retraction of any and all charges against the Rogue Avengers. Then it was fifty. Then it was eighty. And the numbers continued to increase.
She chuckled mirthlessly. “Yeah. Because I know...I know that when I do...when I look at their faces...I know that I’ll see just how much I fucked up. And I’ll see just how much they hate me for it.”
. But he had chosen not to and that was his choice to make and she wouldn’t touch something so precious as that, in spite of the pain and confusion it brought him.
There was also one other person she needed to speak to, someone who by mere association and endorsement would provide the necessary impetus to really make things happen the way she wanted them to.
So whatever ideas of her own that she had when it came to Laura and her kids, she kept them to herself for now and continued, to fiddle with things around the house, trying to make the Barton family’s life here just a little easier.
Steve stared at his team, the team that followed him even though he didn’t deserve any of it. Even when things were bad, even when the world was falling down around their ears, these little moments filled him with warmth and steeled him for the challenges that he was certain were going to come.
Everyone was quiet now. Waiting. The silence roared in his ears as the camera switched to Toni once more, a better angle, closer.
“Okay,” she said to herself, pacing around the workspace and rotating her wrists. “Okay. C’mon Stark. Increments...increments by quarters instead of halves. It’s simple. Common sense,” she muttered, nodding to herself and behind her Bucky saw Vision lift the lid of the smoking can and fish out the charred device.
She felt him before she heard him. Felt that synthetic soul that by all rights shouldn’t have existed but did, felt the power of the Mind Stone humming,
Fifteen minutes later and Laura hung up, bid farewell to FRIDAY, who disappeared back into Toni’s phone, and just sat there next to a still sleeping Toni.
“Steve should go with you,” Nat interrupted. “For moral support,” she explained when they both looked at her. “And it’ll be good for more than just you to understand the procedure. Helen and Toni will understand.”
“That I have. It’s gonna be wild,” she said, with a croak in her voice that told Rhodey she hadn’t slept since their mission. “She’s in the lab with Vision as we speak. It’s all very hush hush. Way above your clearance level. I’ll fill you in on everything tomorrow, Honey Bear.” She winked and he laughed softly, gingerly settling onto the stool next to her, wincing as his tired muscles twinged beneath his sweaty undersuit and his braces clicked against the stool legs. “Guessing you guys turned up with nothing?”
“Energy cannot be created or destroyed,” Stephen murmured reverently, the tips of his fingers still resting on her open palms. “Only transferred or changed from one form into another.”
Bucky was in a lighter state of cryo while Shuri was in the US, so Steve left the apartment feeling restless and frustrated. He went down to the gym where the Dora sometimes trained; Okoye and Aneka were with T’Challa this time but Ayo, ever stoic and dispassionate, was practicing with a staff.
Some unnamed emotion crossed Van Dyne’s face but it didn’t seem that she disagreed with the sentiment.
that it threw her back to a time when she thought they’d come to an understanding and could read each other from across the room or could have silent conversations with nothing but quirked eyebrows and quick smiles.
“No, not of that,” she said slowly, her eyes never leaving his. “You are afraid that when you go back home, things will not be the same. And that
“And I suppose FRIDAY had nothing to do with you two coming by on the exact day that I intended to leave? Hell of a coincidence.”
Taking a deep breath and standing up straighter, she plastered on the most coldly delightful smile, unlocked the door and swung it open. Ross’ arm was still raised, Ayo was nowhere to be seen and Okoye looked like she was point three seconds away from breaking him over her knee.
But the point was she kept an eye on him as often as she could and was just going through raw footage of one of his latest escapades - stopping a gas station robbery - when a reflection on the screen caught her attention and she froze.
they’d been through, after she’d pulled him into her web of disaster and then left him behind to deal with everything alone.
With all their projects, hurried meals and countless phone calls and negotiations, Vision couldn’t help but be surprised that Toni had time to do something like this.
- then stilled when she realized her very uncharacteristic lapse in control and looked at Toni carefully. “I didn’t mean it like-”
“Honey, I’m an erroneous variable. In fact most studies would indicate a correlation between bad decisions and
Pepper hadn’t looked happy. She had that expression where she had resigned herself to the gravity of what Toni was saying and what she was trying to do, but was angry at the way that it had to be done.
PHEW. It has been one hell of a ride and we're finally at a major turning point! I hope this in some way makes up for my absence.
Perhaps it was the grandmotherly patience and the slow way that Ueno spoke that had her hackles lowering until she could think clearly again. Because of course Ueno was right - she usually was.
Blonde hair. That was the first thing she noticed. Not even a strawberry blonde. Just. Blonde. Toni couldn’t help but notice how well it suited her. She still preferred the red, though. It was nostalgic. Although that was probably an indicator that she shouldn’t prefer red. Clinging too tightly to things from the past created too much resistance when she had a world to change.
He’d been quiet even as she’d cried gross, ugly angry tears, had rubbed her back as she hyperventilated and coughed up last night’s dinner. And when she finished he had hugged her, a gesture instigated by no one else but
Much to her relief T’Challa just laughed – and oh, he had a nice laugh – full-bodied and deep and it brought a smile to her face, the last vestiges of pain dissolving with the sound.
All save one that remained stubbornly above her head. She frowned and tried again, confused when it didn’t budge.
was doing this and not any other number of brilliant scientists and engineers the world had to offer.
“You almost failed once,” FRIDAY said coldly. “Do not fail again. Boss is the one who gave you this life.
Logically Steve knew that in the grand scheme of things it hadn’t been very long since their arrival. The Compound was huge, Toni and the others were
. Like those split-second moments during a mission where she realized she’d walked into something a little out of her depth.
There was an intimacy to his hours at twilight, just feeling the world around him with new eyes every day. In one of the recordings he had climbed on top of the former Avengers tower and just stared up at the full moon and
even though she wanted to reassure this wonderful and brilliant woman that Ultron and what he did never had anything to do with her.
It took Stark three seconds after that to realize herself what she had done. Bucky watched as her smile went tight before sliding off completely, and her expression chilled as she stared first down at their clasped hands, then slowly raised her eyes to meet his, horror and revulsion making her eyes go wide.
Still, thank you for your continued support and for taking the time to read and leave lovely comments and telling me all your theories. It's so exciting to know that people are enjoying this fic and I'm ever so grateful for every single person who has taken the time to read my little story xx
Vision’s discreet hand on her lower back eased the fidgeting she didn’t even know she’d been doing and she exhaled slowly as T’Challa walked towards her, the corners of his eyes crinkling warmly.
“It’s good to see you too,” she offered, because it was all she could at this point. “You look well.”
“I do. I’ve given Vision the schematics for one of our forcefields. A variation of the ones we use on our shields.”
Steve looked down at his feet, a thousand regrets and a thousand more arguments swirling around in the muck of his mind. Or maybe it was the other way around. To many maybes. Too many almosts.
“You can put your stuff in the room you stayed in last time. Dinner’s at seven. Please take a shower before you come down.”
“What?” she asked, confused and more than a little taken aback by the ferocity in his expression. “Through the door—?”
“Ease up there, soldier boy,” she murmured as she settled on the wheelie stool, eyeing first his tightly clenched fist in his lap, then the chart that monitored his heart rate, indicating it was slightly elevated. “We don’t have a replacement right arm in case you decide to break that one too.”
“She said that you knew something was coming because you’d seen it. When you flew that nuke into space.” She felt pinned in place by his words, by how old, how
“He would do well on the Subcommittee, wouldn't he?” she said, and Toni’s heart leaped in her chest. “You will send him our regards, will you not?”
Only Toni could make that sound like an insult. Only Toni could hit where it hurt the most without even lifting a finger.
“They want to meet with me privately,” Toni said, finally opening her eyes, her head rolling against the wooden panelling at her back so she could stare up at the ceiling.
“Yeah, well. The Compound may be funded by me but it falls under the Council’s jurisdiction. At least until the Panel is formed. And seeing as legal’s already drafting up a contract a hotel would just be a waste of money. Besides,” she said, finally glancing up from her work, “friends close, enemies closer, right?”
“See, these babies have no biological nature whatsoever. That needs to be programmed into it. I’ll literally have to give them their own DNA. Kinda cool, huh?”
“Done, Boss. I have also been informed that representatives from Lebanon, Chile and Fiji have been added to the attendance list.”
“I know you’re extremely busy with everything. I heard you’re organizing a trip to Lagos to meet with the victims and their families. It’s a good tactic-”
He stilled, his mouth shaping the beginnings of a word before he seemed to think twice of it and cleared his throat awkwardly instead.
during those training sessions? When I see you hounding Nat because you wanna try something new? You’ve
the city if she stood on the roof. But down here she could pretend even as they walked the perimeter of the giant monument of memories.
. I’m just testing out the command sequencing first. Make sure they do what they’re told and perform the way I need them to.”
Her phone buzzed before she could say anything and her screen flashed with a notification from FRIDAY with the subject matter
He licked his lips then nodded, only realizing that he’d been clenching his fist under the table when the tension in his palm and forearm released like a relieved sigh.
“Dummy is about as intimidating as a kitten wearing socks. He is heavy, though, so watch out for your—”
wanted to be back home, something tells me that you would be. After all, you could always ask my king to drop you and your friends somewhere outside our borders for the authorities to pick up.”
“We made mistakes,” Toni continued. “We made so many unnecessary mistakes. Maybe we couldn’t see another way. Maybe we were too focused on the mission. Maybe we should have pushed that little bit more.” She held up her hands. “But hey. We were only human.”
the fifth time she’d called to highlight yet another aspect of the Accords she wanted them to try and break down, and then she’d promptly hung up, already very intimate with Toni’s haphazard and oftentimes manic way of thinking.
the sight of him stealing the breath back out from her lungs and making her freeze as if a bucket of icy water had just upended itself over her head.
Even T’Challa with his Oscar-worthy impassiveness at her presence during their usual prep meetings, had been impressed with her suggestions on the Accords.
She isn't even trying, and maybe that's the trick. Because Toni keeps acquiring more and more people through no effort of her own.
“I’d like…I’d like you do to me a favor, Your Highness,” she hedged, plans forming and reforming in her head.
Instead, Natasha just nodded once and stepped away, though not before Toni caught the way her throat bobbed when she did so. Well, tough fucking titties.
would she risk another fallout? It was a question that had whispered itself in her own ear, tickled the back of her neck with cold, phantom fingers.
Toni hummed and looked at Vision, who looked right back at her. In the midst of her rising insanity a lot of good had come out of being back here, one of those things being her growing relationship with Vision and their knack for having silent conversations. She secretly wondered whether he was actually psychic.
She vaguely wondered whether this was what mothers felt like on a daily basis, then quickly dismissed the idea because what had she birthed other than a series of incrementally bad decisions?
“That’s nice for them. Sounds like they’re setting up shop as best as they can.” She licked her lips and stared at the green slush inside her glass. “Do you know,” she began slowly, feeling every word spoken, “that no one came for me?” Once they were out, it suddenly felt
“I will.” She looked up and surveyed the rest of the team in various stages of pre-sleep. With a huff, she added, “There’s nowhere else I could go anyway.”
“But I think,” Sam continue, ducking his head so he could catch Steve’s eyes, “I think she’s going to do something big. And after everything, I don’t think this is the end of us.”
“Make them more powerful than Wasp’s stingers,” she’d said shamelessly and Toni had struggled not to laugh.
“I did not lie, FRIDAY,” Vision soothed with a level of calm that he knew would infuriate her as much as she could be infuriated. Ma’am’s creations were often as complex and startling as she was. “I merely provided Dummy with an explanation of my goals. Ma’am may not be here but she soon will be. Thanks,” he added, letting his mind enter the stream of computer code that ran through the Compound, “for the most part, to you, FRIDAY.”
“I initially didn’t take sides during the so-called Civil War.” His voice was quiet but clear and unrepentant. “I thought the original Accords were overly restrictive and I thought trusting a man like Thaddeus Ross to oversee their implementation was dangerous.”
The edges of her lips stretched into a bitter smile. “I didn’t. I just sent a suit, plucked him out of the water and told him to leave the matter alone. Apparently someone’s been stealing alien tech to make weapons. I called the feds so they’ll be on it.”
To her surprise T’Challa smiled and it was painfully kind. “You are a convincing actress, Ms. Stark. But you are not a murderer; you have too much soul.”
Next to him Bucky swallowed and nodded. “Yeah. I’m...whenever you’re free I’d like...if the arm can be installed then— then that would be great.” He held his breath then added in a softer tone that twisted at Steve’s heart, “Please?”
“Well,” she said, watching as the previously jagged edge of Barnes’ shoulder knit itself back together to a smooth, clean cut. “Would you look at that.”
. “I didn’t at the time. I thought I could- I mean. I got big-headed and thought if I just proved myself to you that I was...that I could do this…” he trailed off sheepishly, feeling heat creep up the back of his neck and suddenly very grateful for the low lighting. “You were right to take away the suit back then. It didn’t even...I was kind of a jerk.” He shrugged, the motion causing his collarbone to twinge uncomfortably. “Plus I got my friend to bypass your safety protocols. Uh. Sorry about that.”
She had to learn one of these days that she wasn’t going to be able to control every situation she got herself into, that no matter how hard a grip she had on the reins, a bucking horse was going to throw her off at some point.
. But as much as she wanted to, as much as she wanted to reach out to this hell of a kid and take him on board and make him feel like he hadn’t been forgotten, she couldn’t. Not yet.
“Just…” She felt the heat of her palms, the blood pulsing through T’Challa’s on the backs of her hands. “Be my conscience. Through all of this. Rhodey is too used to me being a total fuck-up and Vision is a dream but he’s so young and I can’t… Someone needs to hold me accountable. To punch me in the face when I go too far. I’m trying really hard not to make the same mistakes I did but I need-”
. He fell onto his back for the second time that afternoon, feeling the uncomfortable fizz of the powerful EMP generated by Okoye’s staff still reverberating in his bones.
But still she worried. She knew the Council had their suspicions, however silent, about the locale of Cap and his group. T’Challa had willingly put himself in perhaps the most politically precarious position of all of them. He had the power of a country at his back, he was a
He seemed to have forgotten that she’d taught him everything he knew so she was completely aware that she was being watched.
Steve worked his jaw for a moment, his eyes still burning with a fight before he sighed and his shoulders sagged.
She’d stood in front of the door of her old room for fifteen minutes until Vision placed a gentle hand on her shoulders and steered her towards his own room. It was neutral enough and Toni actually cracked a smile at the pieces of artwork on the wall. The bots’ work, clearly.
His footsteps stalled for a bare second before he made his way towards her and around the counter to settle into the stool opposite her.
And then Doctor Cho straightened in her seat, bringing up a 3D diagram of Bucky’s shoulder and the current implant, and once again, it was like watching Toni Stark morph into someone new, someone with sharp eyes and professional attentiveness, someone who was ready to get right down to business.
“Then I go back to the drawing board and start this from scratch,” she told him simply. “And if you decide you don’t want
, Peter,” she said again and, with the kind of care she usually reserved for when working with a particularly delicate piece of tech, she lifted his mask off of his head and made a strangled noise in her throat when she saw how bloody it was. “FRIDAY, damage,” she demanded.
And in that moment Nat felt her awareness sharpen to a pinpoint and all her skills emerge just below the surface of her skin,
Bucky rubbed his palms on his thighs, something he’d started doing ever since they began taking him in and out of cryo more often. He flicked his gaze from the TV to Steve.
He did as he was told, opting to make himself as unimposing as possible. Three different metal arms were spread out on the table, each component placed neatly in what he assumed was order of installation.
“Done and done. Initiating scans of Ms. Khan now and transmitting them to Vision. He is already in the midst of setting up the molecular stabilizer by my recommendation. Boss, she is in one serious state of flux.”
Shuri went on as if she hadn’t just dropped an atom bomb over his head, and to be fair she didn’t know the truth but it didn’t stop his muscles from stiffening as tension coursed through his bones.
“You are,” Laura said thickly from behind her curtain of hair. When she turned and looked at Toni, her eyes were damp with tears. “We’re gonna have to fix that one of these days.”
He ran out into the living room where they were all gathered around the TV in various states of undress and sleep-wear. Natasha was indeed on the screen, her hands clasped professionally in front of her. Next to her was Colonel Rhodes - Steve heard Sam exhale a shuddering breath - and next to him was Vision - Wanda was practically pressed up against the screen, drinking him in even as she clutched her shawl tight around herself.
so that’s what I’m doing here. Because if I don’t say it now I’ll keep putting it off and I just need you to know that you are so special to me and I’m so,
listened to you, Ms. Stark.” Councilwoman Ackerman clasped her hands together, resting them on the table, coincidentally right into the path of a sunbeam.
Rhodey got in contact with President Ellis and Everett Ross, whom Toni conceded was the more tolerable Ross. Good old Thaddeus was conveniently omitted from any form of contact in spite of him having left a bazillion messages and even more emails and Rhodey’s perpetual response of
“The burn marks on the core does indicate that the frequency was raised too quickly. Quarters should be perfect.”
“Sometimes,” she began quietly, thinking of the crackle and pop of JARVIS’ voice as she flew out of range, “there are things that are better left forgotten.” She waited but Stephen didn’t argue and there was understanding in the lightness of his sigh. “So you decided to become an Avenger because of New York?”
and yet you’ve managed to reduce the cost of production by more than half with this synthetic compound of yours without sacrificing the quality. This is the same compound you used for Colonel Rhodes’ device?”
at him over her shoulder, feeling both full and hollow all at once when she saw the stricken look on his beautiful -
Ten minutes later and the room had been cleaned, the anaesthetist rotated, and Barnes remained sedated and oblivious to the rest of the world around him, including a clearly exhausted Shuri who, through the monitor, appeared to be taking a short doze on whatever desk she was at.
“Hey,” she murmured once Shanthi had signed off. “You should get some rest. Early start tomorrow.” Not to mention that it would be the first time any of them saw the others since...everything.
Toni watched Laura for a long moment, taking in the unbrushed hair and the bags beneath her eyes and the furrow between her brows.
“So why are you letting your sister beat up our fearless leader in the middle of the hot Wakandan sun?”
If Ackerman could smile, this was as closed to one as Toni suspected she would ever see. It was difficult to decipher something that was decidedly
“Oh, I don’t know about that. I haven’t spoken to any of your former teammates since they arrived.” She scrunched up her nose and shrugged, but there was a smug little smirk that threatened to spread across her lips. “I think they’re scared of me.”
Toni’s favorite moments, the ones KAREN let her linger on a little longer, were his quiet times alone as he swung between buildings and under bridges, or perched on the very top of buildings, watching the sunset melt into the molten metal skyline. Those were beautiful moments.
of a lot more than they’re ever gonna trust me again. It should,” she sighed, “it should’ve come from you in the first place, then maybe things wouldn’t have-” Her shoulders lifted in a helpless shrug. “But I was always one for grand gestures. This one just backfired majorly.”
And a lot of us girls got into a huge fight with them about it and I pushed a kid off his chair and told him that Iron Man can be whatever she wants to be. Then we all got detention,” she laughed, spinning around in her seat.
T’Challa was silent and she didn’t blame him for that, for the inability to give her words of comfort and reassurance, because there were none. There was nothing that could possibly make this moment of resentment okay.
“You pretentious white boys should praise and fear my glorious IQ. My very existence should be an affront to your sensibilities,” she’d said once and Steve had laughed and laughed and laughed. When she’d indignantly asked him why he was laughing he had told her, tears of mirth - and perhaps something else - leaking out of the corners of his eyes,
She nearly smiled. The innocence of kids; when they knew something was supposed to be important but they didn’t quite get why.
“I dare say you have. I’ve been looking forward to meeting you. Toni has told me a lot about you,” he said calmly and Toni barely suppressed a wince. Wrong thing to say.
And it felt good knowing that ever since they’d started working together Laura didn’t have to listen to Toni walking around the house during ungodly hours of the night looking for something to do. There were nights where she would hear Toni walk out the front door and she would wait with mounting anxiety for the sound of an engine followed by her car leaving the grounds. She only let herself fall asleep again when the front door opened and Toni’s padded footsteps came up the stairs and disappeared into her room again.
“She was my mentor at one time,” he remarked, considering. “Perhaps, had I been more self-aware at the time I would have considered her my friend as opposed to merely an ally. But the lines these days are...blurry.”
In a way she was glad T’Challa wasn’t around just so she wouldn’t have to see his I-told-you-so face, which he was probably too dignified so show anyway, but she’d certainly feel his disapproval.
he wouldn’t let her fall. She knew he wouldn’t let her die and there was not a modicum of doubt in that seemingly insignificant little jump.
There was more than one outcry of shock and protest from the observation room but Stark didn’t even blink, and continued to patiently gaze back at Bucky, who had the sense that he was being
“We could’ve fought the Accords together too,” Steve couldn’t help but say and Sam nodded in honest agreement.
It forced a breath of a laugh out of her and she finally looked at him in his black suit and a stubborn -
Then Cloak got right up in her face, and she had the distinct impression he was taking her in inch by inch from top to bottom, before wrapping himself around her shoulders and
“Toni.” It was the chastising tone that made her lift her gaze from the table. “You have to know. If I wanted to be in Wakanda sitting around with the rest of the team I would be. But I’m not. I’m
Across from her, Stephen speared a small piece of french toast and she watched him bring the slightly shaky fork to his mouth.
But she brushed the thought of Barnes away, of that hopeless expression of resignation and self-resentment when she had pulled her hand from his, even as the sensation of cold metal pressing into her palm and between her fingers still lingered like an afterimage.
There were words thrown. So many words thrown. And as much as he loved Steve from the bottom of his very cold and very unworthy heart, not all of them were undeserved.
“Right. Pardons. That’s good news,” she declared, her head feeling foggy. She blinked it away. “There’s, uh. A lot to prepare for, then. We need to have those contracts sent to the others. And the most recent draft of the Accords. They’ll want to have a look.”
She gave them all hugs, real hugs, and through it all she could feel Rhodey’s heavy, measuring gaze. She saved Laura for last and had to blink away the moisture that had crept into the corners of her eyes.
Her voice faltered for less than a second, the irony of her own words trickling down the back of her throat like her own blood. But she swallowed down her own fear and forged ahead. Just like she’d always done.
“Hello, everyone.” Toni’s voice was quiet but strong. There wasn’t a trace of her signature snark or quick, sharp smiles. This Toni was honest. She had a cause, something she believed in; Natasha knew her well enough to read it on her face, in the stance of her body, in the
,” she breathed. Then, because she was a masochistic idiot who enjoyed contradicting her own words, she asked, “What are you even doing here?”
Her lips were parted in an almost-smile the likes of which he hadn’t seen since their first fight on the Helicarrier, and there was something similarly flinty and razorlike in her wide eyes.
A shadow moved and her gaze snapped towards the corner between the wall and the cupboard. There was a floor-length mirror on one of the cupboard doors, reflecting nothing but black. Unnerved, she made her way over and stood in front of it, inexplicably relieved when the arc reactor illuminated her reflection. She looked like shit and the whole campside horror story image she had going on wasn’t doing her any favours.
She would see the way his eyes bore right back into hers, unwilling to look away, determined to hold her gaze so she could see
Bucky couldn’t help but smile, his breath coming out as an almost-laugh. “So I won’t have...I mean. I won’t,” he swallowed, looking for the words, “I won’t change into…”
“And that completes the Panel,” Rhodey concluded, browsing through the seven Panel heads and nodding at their credentials.
is for getting my boyfriend arrested and keeping him away from his daughter,” she seethed quietly, and Toni let Vision help her to her feet, never taking her eyes off of Van Dyne.
He smiled, small and self-deprecating. “I have thrown more tantrums in front of my mother this week alone than I did during my entire adolescence. It is not...becoming of me.” T’Challa visibly inhaled deeply, then exhaled, long and slow. “When I had first realized that my father was not the man I thought he was I made a promise with myself to be
Toni turned towards the TV and the screen reflected in her eyes, lighting up dark brown to flickers of blue and grey. Her lips were moving in time with the dialogue but her expression never changed.
Natasha hummed, thoughtful and distant. “Glad it worked out for you,” she murmured under her breath in a way that made his own catch at the implication.
The vehemence and earnestness of her tone stunned him as best as he could be stunned considering he was fairly certain he was on woozy painkillers.
The surgery was apparently in two parts: the first to remove the current implant and the second to fit in the new one. After that he’d be given a few days to recover before Stark installed the arm itself.
Fragile glass bursting into a million pieces echoed in her ears. Her fingertips were cold. Her left hand was tingling unpleasantly.
“I don’t know,” she admitted, and she sounded so hopelessly adrift and unmoored in that moment that Steve wondered how she’d held herself together through all this.
Helen watched her for a moment longer then nodded, apparently satisfied. “Very well. Then shall we brief our patient?”
“This is familiar, isn’t it?” she asked as the taste of wheatgrass and pineapple slipped down her throat, the flavor muted by the memory of her and T’Challa seated at a restaurant months and months ago, while Toni stirred the foam of her fruit juice and laid all her scathing baggage bare before him.
The kids were noisy at dinner. Cooper and Lila were arguing about one of their teachers and Nathaniel was talking to himself in that almost-English-but-not language like most English-speaking kids his age. Laura spoonfed him at intervals and Toni stared unblinkingly at her own food until her eyes blurred. Water dripped off the ends of her dark hair and onto her bare shoulders and she could feel it, every cold drop at a time.
And at the same time she couldn’t help but think of another man who had looked like that as he held his metal arm up for the first time and gazed upon it in such
new ones. Just in case. You’re gonna need surgery to remove the current implant and reinstall a better one. It’s...pretty invasive but Helen Cho’s the best. Let me know when and we can get you briefed—”
Not that Vision was a kid. But then again, she thought, he kind of was. Barely more than a year old.
The only other time he’d felt this bad was when Toni had accidentally shot him with one of her upgraded repulsor prototypes. To be fair it was his fault for surprising her. It still hurt like crazy, though.
“So that’s him, huh?” Hope said, coming up beside her and gazing through the window. “That’s Spider-Man.”
“You said that protecting the world was only one of your reasons for joining the Avengers. What was the other?”
“Vision will bring Barnes down to the lab tomorrow at ten sharp. FRIDAY will deal with anyone else who wants to come,” was all she said before the door slid shut behind her back with a cold, mechanical sort of finality, leaving him standing there and not knowing
“Good idea,” she said, and there was a pounding behind her eyes. “Very...very good. Makes sense. They’ll listen to you.”
she breathed, taking it from him and running her fingers over the engraving. “This is the coolest thing anyone’s ever given me. Except for my suit, of course,” she added with a sweet smile at Toni, who just rolled her eyes and waved them off.
“And I, you, Antonia Stark,” he breathed with such affection that rang true down to her bones. “I am immeasurably lucky to have met you in this lifetime.” A moment later she felt his lips on her forehead and her eyes fluttered closed on their own, her body leaning into him. When he pulled back she blinked up at him, all at once feeling very young, younger than she could ever remember feeling. It wasn’t, altogether, an unpleasant feeling. “One day,” he promised, “I will bring you to Wakanda and I will show you my home.”
Toni had just pushed her very stiff, very achy body to its feet when the main entrance door hissed open. She froze for a fraction of a second and relaxed almost instantaneously when she saw long dark hair and a pair of flannel pajamas that she recognized immediately.
She wrote until she couldn’t write anymore and closed her eyes in the middle of a messy bed, surrounded by good things, messy things.
Stilted politeness, awkward silences, overall avoidance of the Rogues, although that term didn’t exactly apply to them any longer, especially once the Council and the Panel received their contracts and their individual signed copies of the Accords.
of everything, of where they stood with one another, of where they stood in the world, of where he stood with—
,” Toni argued softly, with sad, sad eyes that looked almost black in the dimness of the room, and Nat held up her hands, appeasing.
“It’s basically like this. Think...trying to get two sets of troubled kids from different parents to work together and live in the same house and only one set were actually picked to play on the school’s baseball team and the rest are reserve players or on the waiting list while they attend the requisite number of detentions. And in this scenario I’m a single mother and everybody hates my meatloaf.”
She looked away and up only to meet Steve’s eyes across the room, doctors, machinery, space and a single panel of glass the only thing separating them in that moment.
He had mixed feelings about that. On the one hand Toni could very well be understanding about Bucky wanting a friend to accompany him, but Steve doubted Toni would be quite so sympathetic about being forced to face the both of them...being forced to face
“He is,” Steve said, and immediately knew that it was the wrong call if the way she grit her teeth were anything to go by. He knew that look well. “We are.”
She let out a huff of laughter, still trying to get her bearings. Star Trek’s ending credits were playing on TV. Kamala was asleep with her entire body draped across one of the couches. Shuri was sleepily flicking through her tablet and Peter and Harley were dragging their feet as they cleaned up the drinks and popcorn bowls.
“That was one hell of a punch,” she remarked idly, as if one side of her face wasn’t already swelling. “I hear where you’re coming from
considering all he was wearing a very flimsy pair of espadrilles - as he did an about-turn and zoomed towards Stark.
Behind him, the rest of the team was quiet, their attention focused solely on Bucky and the goings-on of the operating room. And in this moment Steve knew that in
“I’m aware that one of the reasons Boss has started working on the Sokovia Accords again is because she intends to bring the
The weight of more than a hundred and fifty eyes on her should’ve been something she was used to. She’d done speeches at colleges, at her expos and she’d had enough experience with politicians and and savage journalists to have built skin stronger than adamantium.
A harsh sound left her throat, carrying with it a note of disgust, of sorrow and, worst of all, resignation, as if she was telling herself that she shouldn’t have expected anything less.
He lit up from the inside, his relief palpable, whenever Dr. Eccles let him practice with his neuroprosthesis, the support on the lowest setting. It even made her relax a little, just to see Rhodey’s spirits rise. Things weren’t great between them, but she counted the fact that he didn’t kick her out when she started monitoring his PT sessions as a win.
Stephen appeared to physically steel himself, and without a word from him, the cloak unclasped itself from his neck and sped towards Toni, where it immediately wrapped itself around her shoulders and sent her stumbling away from the door.
Red curled at the edges of her vision and her limbs froze instinctively as pale fingers and painted black nails danced on her temple, until she felt the softness of
tech,” she continued with a confidence that never once came close to arrogance, “is undeniably superior and the components far less invasive. The neural interface is also a lot more sensitive so you’ll know almost immediately if anything starts to feel wrong with the arm once Toni has installed it. And we’ll also be doing continued maintenance checks to make sure it remains compatible with your body.” She set down her tablet and fixed Bucky with a reassuring look. “It’s a long procedure but Toni, Shuri and I have gone over it countless times and my team and I have been on the forefront of medical advancement for years, so you’re in good hands, Sergeant Barnes, I can promise you that.”
“My mother had one of those bracelets,” Toni recalled as her heart slowed in tempo. “My dad gave it to her.” She didn’t need to mention that it was probably after he’d stolen enough vibranium to make Cap’s shield and had been waiting for someone special to gift rare Wakandan jewellery to. He got the gist of it. “I liked it. Don’t know where it is.”
T’Challa had only mentioned her briefly in passing but she knew that all weapons at his disposal were the creation of one girl alone.
When all else failed, beating the hell out of a punching bag helped get his head straight for a little while.
Anyways, the next chapter shouldn't take as long as this one, seeing as everything's entirely written and just needs a few tweaks here and there. And also, things will be picking up soon and I'm really excited to see what you guys think when we get into the nitty gritty of the story.
. And it was terrifying and borderline hysterical and her hearing started to go weird but this was just
“How long have you been working on this?” he asked in a quiet voice reserved for sanctums and other holy places.
Breath caught in her throat, Toni reached out, her hand landing softly on his cheek. He met her gaze and went rigid, immediately realizing his mistake.
Dinner had been an affair. Everybody seemed to know something was up, even Nathaniel, who chewed on Toni’s sleeve more vigorously than usual, but she appreciated their effort to keep spirits up by tossing jokes and funny family stories back and forth and steering clear of more serious topics.
Because that was a very literal leap of faith, that was Toni putting her life in Spider-Man’s hands, that was Toni
them and sent them back to me faster than the time it takes for T’Challa to say something cringy to Nakia,” she went on sulkily, kicking her foot out. “She modified my algorithm and recommended a higher frequency for the neuromodulator to deepen the reverse engineering process. With more sessions your synapses will eventually re-calibrate themselves - it’s completely safe, by the way, don’t look at me like that -” he hadn’t been looking at her at all; he’d been too preoccupied with his own tumultuous thoughts, “- to that frequency, and expel any traces of brainwashing. It’ll still take time but from my readings Stark has decreased that time by at least half.” She didn’t sound happy about it but Bucky was too overwhelmed to focus on that.
“C’mon in, Wilson,” she said, stirring her now cold tea for lack of a better thing to do. “Laura’s waffles are legendary. Wouldn’t wanna insult her.”
Her back muscles tensed but she didn’t say anything in response and Bucky hadn’t expected her to. So after an awkward moment hovering, he turned around, saw that most everyone else in the observation room was slowly getting to their feet, and pulled his t-shirt back on, getting ready to leave.
It was like a blow to the gut, the way it used to feel when he was five foot nothing and his reach practically non-existent and every fight ended up with him in a heap by some ripe-smelling dumpster. Strangely enough it felt like
“Perhaps,” he conceded without a trace of guilt. “But I do hope that...you will not be angry with her. If only because I too had my own part to play in finding you. And I utilized every single security measure necessary to ensure that no one would follow us here. To ensure that Mrs. Barton and her children would be safe.”
- or he might have reached out to her with his one flesh hand, let it hover in the air before dropping it by his side in resignation.
- escapades. She enjoyed them all, winced and cringed and had her heart right up to her throat on more than one occasion. But he was spectacular, so much better than she had been at that age.
Toni gave herself a few more moments, her mind buzzing and her heart racing and her hands going hot and cold. When she looked into the room beyond, she saw that the occupants of the observation room had dwindled to Vision, Nat and Steve.
Anyways, thank you to everyone who has been patiently waiting for this chapter. The next chapter should be out next weekend (I've got like, 90% of it written, so yeah), so there won't be an abysmally long wait.
But after a tense moment, he too just shook his head and left the room, and Steve didn’t know whether to feel relieved or disappointed that Rhodey hadn’t asked him.
She scooted out of the way while Rhodey plastered his best military smile on and turned just as one of the doors of the shiny black Jeep she hadn’t realized was parked there opened.
To Natasha’s surprise T’Challa jumped out of the driver’s seat and opened the back door, revealing a messy-haired, red-eyed Toni with a bloody, unconscious
T’Challa and Shuri had been with her, discussing the upgrades they were going to be making to B.A.R.F., when she got the call from Happy.
“He put himself in an underwater prison and left his family,” came her somber reply, but Toni could tell it wasn’t deeply felt. Call it favoritism or years of rooted friendship but in this regard at least, Barton would always be a weak spot. She didn’t outright blame Toni, though, which was something.
She maintained eye contact even as her fingers tapped out the sequence on her tablet to digitize and consolidate all their notes.
than ever, she and Harley became near permanent fixtures at the Compound, declaring themselves, along with Peter, Toni’s ‘interns’. And once they were introduced to Shuri, things tended to go really crazy really fast. It turned out that giving two geniuses, an inventor and a polymorph the run of a place like the Compound was a recipe for disaster. Hilarious disasters but disasters all the same.
“You should’ve called sooner,” she whispered, so quietly that he almost missed it and his chest constricted excruciatingly. Words wouldn’t make it past his lips and after a while he heard a soft sigh. “You should’ve called sooner,” she said again and hung up.
“You have been avoiding me,” she said, and it was a statement, not a question, unsurprised in its resignation.
He grabbed Steve’s shoulder when it looked like Steve was going to argue. “No, Steve. Don’t take this away from me. Don’t. This is one fight you gotta back down from. Because I’m
“He’s your weakness, Stark,” he called tauntingly just before he was unceremoniously shoved into the back of a black police van. “And I won’t be the only one to see it. They’re watching right now.”
Nat had forwarded him an email from the Council, something about an Accords sub-committee that they wanted him to be part of. He went through the list of names and noticed Toni wasn’t on it but she was copied in all the emails. Amidst his admittedly obsessive scrolling through the string of emails he found just one short message from her regarding his appointment as a rep on the sub-committee.
around the edges at the word ‘please.’ He didn’t know if Bucky saw it for what it was but Steve did.
The hairs on the back of her neck stood on end when Barnes stepped through the doors of the kitchen. The air itself felt like it had dropped ten degrees and for the briefest moment she thought that if she exhaled through her mouth her breath would turn Siberian white.
“H-how soon?” he croaked, then wished he hadn’t interrupted, if only that he didn’t have to see her stiffen, her body instinctively leaning backwards towards Spider-Man.
Toni was poking at a slice of apparently vegan french toast - one of Kamala’s many strange culinary endeavors - when Stephen came into the kitchen and sat down opposite her, Cloak fluttering gently behind him.
. Like the past months had changed him into someone she no longer knew or recognized. But she knew that if she looked into his blue eyes with that little bit of green — she saw it
It was like her ears had popped, like all the sound had been sucked from the room, like she was in a vacuum watching everything happen in slow motion. A migraine throbbed in the distance and she inhaled slowly, feeling her lungs burn the way they had burned when she had flown through that portal and the air ran out. The way they had burned when she had gasped in air at about minus twenty degrees, and it had felt like a hundred daggers of ice were piercing her chest until she had thought her lungs would burst and she would drown in her own blood.
He heard Steve’s slow and steady inhale, and saw his spine stiffen until it couldn’t get any straighter the closer they got to the room. Natasha’s heavy gaze shifted between him and Steve, but, like most Red Room graduates, she projected so little that had the Winter Soldier’s training not been instilled in him so deep, he would have barely registered her presence.
” Toni declared, perhaps more forcefully than necessary. “Oh my god, no, c’mere, you.” She practically dragged Kamala over and wrapped her arms around her, getting a faceful of luscious brown hair and the scent of rose water and black tea. “How could I
“I don’t know what happened between you and Sergeant Barnes or between you and Captain Rogers,” she said, and Toni felt her stomach swoop unpleasantly. “I
They were brown. He remembered them too. They were nice eyes, full of history and pain as they were.
She heaved a heavy, expansive sigh, staring at the ceiling, trying to look anywhere else except his dignified sympathy and earnestness. Because this,
It was the most honest thing she’d said to Natasha in the aftermath of dust and frayed, bloody nails and a cold so deep it was as if she was made of snow.
“I have always respected Toni. With our previous training under Captain Rogers, I did not get to spend as much time with her. The Civil War changed that.”
Helen’s shoulder lifted in a vague shrug. “It’s your life.” Then she reached into her pocket and pulled out one of those generic orange bottles, filled with small blue pills that rattled against the cylindrical walls. “Take one before you go to sleep,” she murmured, looking her right in the eye and it was only then that Toni saw the haunted nightmares that cast brown and purple shadows under her eyes, hastily hidden by a layer of concealer.
It was past two in the morning when Wanda burst into Steve’s room, her eyes wide and glowing red while her magic crackled erratically around her and scaring him half to death.
She wasn’t sure whether that was rhetorical so she tread cautiously. “No. But for what it’s worth, you look like you’re doing a great job.”
from— She kept her eyes on him and gave him a strained smile as she reached behind him, grabbed his mask from the head of the couch they’d been leaning against, and proceeded to pull it over his head. “Just. Keep it on around them. For now. Till you’re ready.”
Sam didn’t answer for a long moment and Steve almost wanted to wave it off, take the question back so he wouldn’t have to hear-
He didn’t know the woman who stood in front of millions and fought for his freedom. He didn’t know the woman who made Steve close his eyes in pain when she declared to the governments of the world that Earth needed the Avengers. He didn’t know the woman who had no reason to help him but who gave Shuri a way to fix him anyway.
“From what I can ascertain from Roxxon’s files, only one of their more recent inventions has the highest level of encryption and over seventy terabytes worth of documentation. It is some form of energy containment field-generator, not dissimilar to the casing of your older arc reactors. I am transmitting the information to the Compound now for later analysis.”
She was fairly sure that it was one half of the pair that belonged to the first Iron Man suit, and that led her to thinking about her maiden flight followed by her first ever mission.
For a while only the sound of uprooted cabbages filed the air. Toni wondered whether they were having sauteed kale or a kale salad for dinner, or whether Laura was going to sell her harvest at the farmer’s market in town.
Perhaps the only indication of emotion was the fact that she wouldn’t look at Toni whenever the topic of her husband was brought up. Toni couldn’t begrudge her that.
Steve didn’t know what he’d expected upon his return to the Compound. Truth be told he’d tried not to think about it. Not that the out of sight, out of mind tactic had ever worked in the past, considering the fact that every moment that had passed since Siberia had been filled with thoughts about Toni no matter how hard he tried. Now was no different.
But Bucky, who was right here, saw something more than just the pride of a triumphant, successful creation. There was a delicacy to her touch, a gentleness that all the men and women who had ever used him never had. The arm wasn’t a weapon to her; she looked at it as she had her bots, held it aloft with the same hands she had stroked Dummy’s claw with, looked at it with as much affection as she did Butterfingers, murmured words under her breath in the same tone of voice she had used on You.
He was silent for a while and Toni stewed in her own misery, thinking about how a year could change so much. How before, Toni wouldn’t have dreamt of planning her course every time she stepped out of the safety of her lab or Vision’s bedroom - though even
“Is it?” he asked, smiling humorlessly. He stared at the opposite wall, grim shame emanating off of him in waves as he said quietly, “I hurt her.”
I know I haven't replied to any of your comments but I will, I promise I will. I've just been extremely busy and finding the time to write hasn't been easy lately because real life has been very demanding.
She closed her eyes as Natasha dabbed on the concealer - and Toni thought that the amount she used was  a little bit rude because she didn’t look
“From my limited scans of heart-rate and breathing patterns I’d say it’s a negative on the heart attack front, Boss, and probably some form of an anxiety attack instead.” She sounded distressed herself and Toni could imagine a frazzled Ana Jarvis with her wild red hair as she fretted over her.
Ultimately his one failure in trying to understand her justifications behind her actions was the fact that he didn’t know anything about her.
“Uh,” she voiced awkwardly, looking at Stephen, who merely sighed and leaned back a little, the corner of his mouth quirking up in amusement.
“Because I wanted everyone to look at you. Because I wanted Bruce to see what he was missing when the pictures came out online.”
It was funny how a well-meant question could alter the atmosphere so drastically it felt like a Dementor had just decided to sweep through and say hello. Hope’s mouth turned down at the corners ruefully, but her eyes were firm.
“I’ll call Helen and see when she can make the trip.” The words were out before she could even think about keeping them to herself. “She’ll be the one doing the surgery to get the current implant out. Shitty piece of work, that. Unsophisticated but, hey. What can you expect from HYDRA, right?” Toni didn’t expect him to have a response to that and wasn’t surprised by his continued silence. “FRIDAY will inform you when we’re ready for you,” she continued in a controlled rush, turning her back on him once more and bending over her tablet.
“And you.” For the briefest moment, Steve thought he saw her eyes flicker hesitantly to Toni, whose expression softened before she gave the smallest nod that was little more than the blink of her eyes, and addressed Bucky once more. “You’re in good hands, you know? Doctor Cho’s the best. And
She’d worked it out, though, at least a small piece of it; Rhodey didn’t know what happened in Siberia. Vision did.
When she went back inside Lila dragged her over to the kitchen table and forced her to watch flower arrangement videos with her on YouTube.
Several eyes darted towards Ackerman before focusing on Toni once more, though Toni could tell they weren’t as clued on as they were trying to appear.
Therapy. Evals required to be made by an independent psychiatric board. He was confined to the Compound, save for special missions, until the Panel was satisfied that he wasn’t a danger to society. It made Steve’s insides twist but Bucky just nodded like it was to be expected. It was obvious they couldn’t submit any of Shuri’s work with Bucky seeing as no one, not even the Council, knew where he was. He wondered how the Avengers intended to explain that. Or whether it was just an unspoken thing: an I know you know and I know you know that I know but we’re going to keep pretending.
“You find him, Happy,” she ordered, already running out of the kitchen, and she could hear T’Challa and his sister following behind her. “You find him, god
“Maybe too many jobs,” she said pointedly. “Have you ever heard of delegation? I hear it can be very effective.”
Bucky looked at the ground, squeezed the wrapped up shoulder once more, then let his hand drop and rose to his feet.
the table in what Toni assumed was supposed to be some kind of intimidation tactic that didn’t appear to be working in the slightest if Strange’s cavalier smile was anything to go by.
She did the next best thing and sat in the back with his head cradled in her lap all the way back to the Compound. Every so often T’Challa would glance into the rearview mirror and see her gazing down at Peter’s sleeping face, or gently wiping away the dried blood with a wet tissue.
had been new, and Steve had seen the way Wanda’s eyes tracked his movement with a raw kind of wonder.
In the corner a machine was weaving together a red and dark slate blue suit. There was already a pile of what he assumed were duds or faulty suits kicked haphazardly under another table.
“Indeed,” came a disembodied, frosty voice that had Bucky’s fingers reaching for a non-existent weapon.
Peter had constructed some sort of sticky net containing a dozen frightened civilians at a time and practically shoved them out of the gaping hole in the side of the building. She swooped by, grabbed the tail end of his web and ferried the traumatized group to the ground, letting the medics take care of the rest.
She stood a little straighter and plastered on her best polite smile as T’Challa came to a stop in front of her.
Toni smiled and it was all teeth. “He’s such a busy man these days. We didn’t want to burden him further and thought, hey, why not go to the big man himself.”
They held one another’s gaze for an extended heartbeat and once again, Toni was the first to drop her eyes, unable to accept the way his features softened sympathetically at her expense. Cloak vibrated around her body in what felt like reassurance, before he slipped from her shoulders and floated back over to Stephen.
About half a minute later he lowered his hands, the glow disappearing, then turned around and looked at her, a troubled furrow between his brows.
people. I don’t regret shoving HYDRA into the spotlight, I never will. But I’ll regret what it cost us.”
“-and then there’s Rosie. She’s been dying to meet you. I think she might have a crush, you ladies’ man you.”
“Toni,” Vision began again, interrupting her thoughts. “I would just like to say that I am pleased that you are coming back to New York.” He stopped, his face betraying a myriad of emotions that Toni couldn’t keep up with. “It has been...lonely without everyone. Without
. “I’d appreciate if we could have this conversation without alerting Boss. I’m not actually meant to be here.”
Steve watched for a few moments longer until Toni, Spider-Man and the other kids were all hanging in mid-air, like a group of lazy trapeze artists on a break. He watched the way her nose wrinkled when she laughed, drank in the almost languid expression as she swung back and forth, the motions making her chin-length hair blow around her face.
“Don’t imagine sleep’s gonna come easy tonight,” she said dryly. “There’s gonna be a lot of...unspoken things. Distrust. Between everything.”
It didn’t stop her from discreetly getting FRIDAY to monitor any and all communications within the room and flag up anything that even
“Is that an American thing?” Shuri asked, averting her attention from the cloak, who honest to god looked
There were several empty glasses with dried smears of whatever concoction they’d previously contained clinging to the edges and settling at the base. Some of them had lipstick marks on the rim. There was a small couch with a duvet hanging off of it and slipping onto the floor.
For a moment she thought Hope would argue with her, would ask her that after everything she’d done to bring the former Rogue Avengers home,
When she looked back up at the screen, T’Challa was waiting with his own drink in hand and they both smiled, raised their respective glasses, before taking a sip.
and it was the best thing ever. I remember all the boys in my class like, ewww, how can Iron Man be a
Toni didn’t miss a beat. “Somehow you don’t strike me as the superstitious type, sir. Too...logical.”
A wide-eyed nurse stood in the doorway leading into the operating theatre, nervously shifting from foot to foot.
it only cemented the fact that had I been an Avenger before, I still would’ve been on your side no matter that Scott would still have chosen Captain America’s.” Hope sighed and gave her a tired, almost resigned smile. “I mean I guess we’ll never know but...I’d like to think that when faced with the choice I would’ve remained true to my ideals.”
Maybe she’d never be able to reconcile those parts of her. The dark places inside that hated James Barnes and hated Steve Rogers with the large, looming cavern, the shape of a cave in Afghanistan, that hated herself for what she’d done.
like. There was a lot to be deciphered in her words but Laura could hear the message clearly; we miss her and we want her to come home.
He mustered a smile but it didn’t feel very convincing. Bucky dropped his gaze, then turned back to the screen.
A muscle clenched in Bucky’s jaw and Steve saw him wipe the palm of his hand on his sweatpants before pushing to his feet.
Vision did not like to inflict hurt. He took no pleasure in Wanda's pain and yet he found that he did not regret his words. They had needed to be said.
He watched as Toni raised her head from her close examination of a computer screen, her eyes narrowed to slits. She grinned when she saw him and rubbed her hand over her face.
After what felt like forever, he finally broke and asked the one thing, the most important thing, that he wanted to know.
at Clint. He refused to hug him. And Lila’s a smart girl; she preoccupied Clint for most of the day. I’m not sure whether she was doing it to protect her brother or to preserve her father’s feelings.”
He felt something that had been coiled tightly inside of him loosen, some tension seeping out of a compartment of his mind that had been waiting for the next wipe, for the next freeze.
Things are slowly coming together but grief and mourning go hand in hand with betrayal. In which Toni is Toni, Vision does his best and T'Challa may be the catalyst to a greater kind of glory.
“There are fan theories that she inherited magic from a witch or wizard somewhere down the family line. Sorcerers have an innate ability to be able to learn magic even if they don’t necessarily come from it. Like a prodigy, I guess.”
of Wanda, of her power, of the red that had seeped into her mind and turned her vision bloody and made her see nightmares of her own making. Neither had she forgiven Wanda for that
She was dragging T’Challa towards the car before he had a chance to speak. As they pulled out off the beach, he saw Agent Fern and her cleanup crew arrive in their standard AMOTF vehicles. Toni spared a quick nod for her before they passed one another.
“Stephen,” she said once, firmly but kind. “Helen, Shuri and I? We wanted to do this for you from the moment we saw that our tech worked for Rhodey. It was only a matter of time, really. I’m just...I’m just glad you’re in a little less pain than before. And who knows? Maybe one day we’ll even be able to make this permanent.”
With a flick of his wrist, the holographic interface appeared and Clint realized it for what it was; a phone.
He rolled his lips together to keep back a grin but his eyes gave his mirth away. “I’m not judging you,” he said finally. “If I didn’t think this idea held merit I wouldn’t have volunteered. And it does,” he added, looking at her sidelong with an intensity that had her insides churning funnily. “And the other Avengers know it too.”
And there it was, rising up inside of him. A fear, a directionless desperation. Fear for Bucky; fear for his friends, fear for Toni -
“Try not to think too much about it, Vision. Or do. I dunno. My advice tends to come from a place of self-loathing and resentment. Listening to me is...inadvisable.”
Because the people didn’t want to hear Toni Stark spewing legal jargon and politics. They’d be hearing that for months to come.
, being the operative word - to write papers about them, something she’d once gotten a laugh out of.
Toni lingered in the doorway of the balcony, watching Stephen as he calmly called out instructions - barely raising his voice - to a sweaty and frustrated-looking Wanda, who was practising on the level below.
And when Toni would wake up at night with her hands clasped protectively over her arc reactor and a scream caught in her throat, Vision would bring up every single thing she was working on and resume where he’d left off before she’d fallen asleep.
A warm feeling entered his chest. Shuri had been coldly polite to Toni during every interaction, something T’Challa had not anticipated in advance, nor was her certain of its origin. Every time he tried to speak to her about it she clammed up and remained mutinously silent. Toni never seemed to hold anything against her, though, never treated her with anything other than kindness and oftentime genuine admiration. Knowing Toni did indeed like his sister and her verbal affirmation of the fact gave him nothing but pleasure.
She thought of two stupid and reckless boys from Brooklyn. Of a friendship that defined them. Of bravery and loyalty. Of love and loss.
He stilled and set down his fork, looking out the floor-to-ceiling window and seeing something else entirely. She knew that look too.
Familiar fingers lacing themselves through hers. The heat of murmured breath. The tip of a nose and the flutter of her eyelashes.
shit at. Because in the five languages of love she was the sort who showed her appreciation for people by making them shit. So by extension, her apologies tended to steer in the same direction.
“Surprisingly no,” Vision replied, placing a calming hand to her back and leading her to a fallen log so they both could sit. “He appears to be avoiding any talk of the incident at all, save for with his therapist. Both of them,” he added and Toni suppressed a guilty wince.
“That is not my intent at all,” he interrupted smoothly, then added in a softer, gentler tone, “But after everything that she has already done, does she not deserve to be?”
it for you. Along with that gold shoulder necklace. You’re taller than me; you pulled it off great.”
“You wanna come to the gym?” Sam inquired, but his tone held little room for argument. It was a pointed and really quite obvious intervention that reminded him a little of when T’Challa had first come to him and practically thrown him into the frightening and relentless jaws of his sister.
The image was both funny and painfully warm, stirring all sorts of feelings, the most prominent of them being unadulterated
The specs for Barnes’ arm were open on the tablet in front of her and she’d been putting it through simulation after simulation to test its durability and resistance when her finger stilled, hovering an inch above the touchscreen.
T’Challa seemed to accept her explanation and settled his hand on her back, leading her towards the rest of the group and away from whatever tricks her sleep-deprived mind was playing on her.
“Yeah,” she said, tracing the circumference of the arc reactor through her tank top. “For the most part”
Toni kept her mouth shut and let Stephen take the conversation forward. It’d been a gamble but it looked like it could pay off. Training and oversight. Enough of it to appeal to the UN and just the right amount so that Wanda wouldn’t feel trapped by the many conditions of her pardon. Stephen could deliver that. She knew he could. Toni had been hesitant to ask him at first, what with his work at the Sanctum and with The Room, but when she’d brought it up with him he hadn’t thought twice.
Toni grimaced self-deprecatingly for the mere fact that she was in no way suitable to help someone through anything remotely emotional and because whenever she tried, she usually ended up making it worse.
By the time Toni looked back over her shoulder, the space through small square window in the door was already clouding over with a crackling sound as Stephen manipulated the mirror dimension, locking her out and sealing Wanda
“Whoa, hey, easy. Not that kind of doctor,” she said, holding him back down which might have been difficult had he not been in pain. “You’re coming with me to the Compound. Get you looked over there by Black Panther’s sister, Shuri. She’s awesome, you’ll like her. Hell of a genius. You guys’ll have a lot to talk about.”
Scott was currently spewing his verbal diarrhea at Ayo, who wore a pinched expression as if a particularly noisy mosquito was buzzing in her ear. Clint nodded and fell into step as they began a slow stroll around the courtyard, the sound of Steve and Princess Shuri’s sparring and Scott’s babbling a somewhat therapeutic background hum.
And it was with Natasha’s shrewdness, Rhodey’s military history, Vision’s insight, T’Challa’s political position and Toni’s mastermind - and more than a little help from her legal team - that they presented their numerous proposals to the UN Security Council.
She smiled tiredly as Rhodey came and stood beside her three hours later. Shuri was asleep in a chair by Kamala’s bed and Hope had left for a shower, dragging her feet.
Peter trusted KAREN enough not to reveal some of his more embarrassing escapades, including karaoke in the mirror with his mask on because god, that was the most cringe-worthy thing and Toni could
Nat was sending him a despairing glare over the top of Toni’s head and Bucky cursed under his breath, turning away in embarrassment or frustration. Steve couldn’t blame him and his ears burned in humiliation because
She shook her head and blinked rapidly against the night that kept closing in, closer and closer until she was inside of it, until it was all she knew.
“Do we?” she asked quietly, and there was a jagged edge of desperation, so suppressed anyone else might have missed it. His eyes lingered on the way her fingers of her one free hand were digging into her thighs, a nervous tic he’d seen her do on more than one occasion. “I feel like I’m chained to a rock and trying to walk through quicksand and I just
For a moment it looked as if he was going to stay. But then as if on cue, Steve angled his body towards him, though it seemed to kill him to have to turn his back on Stark. Again.
she’d been tempted to have Vision spy on her. Natasha would’ve done the exact same thing had their roles been reversed. Natasha
“Ms. Van Dyne,” she greeted carefully, stepping forward, and Nat already could see her eyes breaking apart every single component of the other woman’s suit. “How’s dad?”
Ayo didn’t say anything but one corner of her mouth was raised in what might’ve been a fraction of a smug smile as she executed a series of fluid moves, nearly tripping him in the process.
“He is not at his home in Queens,” Vision promptly supplied from her phone, which T’Challa had taken from her. “I have directed Agent Hill to take a team down to the site for cleanup. She is sending her second-in-command, Agent Fern, down shortly and Ms. Romanov has already informed the Council and the Panel of the situation.”
Where she landed next to him amidst the rubble in the aftermath of a fight, faceplate raised, and give him a sweaty, relieved smile. When she sat cross-legged on his desk, having nudged his laptop precariously close to the edge of the table, as she fixed his communicator. Where her voice carried over the comms, relaying the enemy’s position or reassuring the team that she had their backs.
But Steve couldn’t smile. Ever since he’d told everyone the truth, smiling felt taboo and it was like his face had forgotten how to anyway.
Steve waited for him to speak, waited for him to ask the question Steve knew was right on the tip of Rhodey’s tongue:
The complexities of human nature were still a challenge to grasp. The intricacies, the fine lines between acceptable and invasion. Between appropriate and
He spared her a nod before heading over to the punching bag which Shuri had reinforced at the hook so he and Bucky wouldn’t keep knocking them from the ceiling. There were far more advanced machines in the room but for this at least, he liked to play it old school.
It was always going to lead up to this. But after everything, she still wasn't ready. Because no amount of time could have prepared her for this.
In the corner of the room, a Vibranium shield glinted coldly and Vision spared a moment for human emotion.
Stark worked with the curious combination of calm ferocity. Manic but methodical, precise but not always cautious if the numerous electrical burns and cuts on her fingers that she had sustained within the first hour were anything to go by.
The sound of Steve’s humming was interrupted by the front door sliding open and King T’Challa walking in followed by-
“We’ll get a skeleton contract drafted up. Something similar to Scarlet Witch’s but you’re free to play with it as much as you like within reason.”
“I’m not worried about Stark,” he said. And the strangest part of it was that it was, quite honestly, true. “I think,” he continued slowly, carefully - always so careful with Steve - “that after everything she’s already done for me...hurting me wouldn’t make much sense, y’know? She’s...she’s invested a lot in me and I don’t…” He swallowed thickly -
Much like the real Jarvis, Ana and Maria Carbonell that she remembered from her youth with stark clarity. When things were better. When she was still young and the sun still shone and her family was
“Can I ask you something? Or it’s...I have a question…but also a confession. And I like you, man, I really do. Mostly. But I also…” On the table next to her Vision was patiently listening to Shuri explain how kimoyo beads worked and on her other side Rhodey was making surprisingly easy small talk with one of the Dora - Ayo, her name was. The other Dora - Okoye - was standing outside, pretending to smoke even as she kept watch.
So. WHO HAS SEEN INFINITY WAR? It came out on the 25th where I live so I watched it super early and I've been killing myself waiting for the rest of the world to catch up so that I can flail and cry and scream and cry some more with everybody. I've already seen it twice but I'll probably try and catch it a third time because...research. And Tony. And Peter. And Doctor Strange. And Thor. And Peter Quill and the Guardians and just EVERYBODY. Because god damn, that movie.
There were fragments, glimpses of things she couldn’t possibly remember because they had never happened. Not to her. And yet there was just
“The arc reactor that was in your chest.” Laura motioned to it with her chin. “Where’s the light gone?”
The bitter realization took the energy out of her legs and she vaguely registered the jarring of her broken arm in its cast and her bruised sternum as she landed on the ground, grass and hardened earth digging into her skin.
“I suppose that shall have to do for now,” he said. “My proposition is this: that until further notice, Toni never be left alone with either Captain Rogers or any member of his team. I believe doing so will cause her too much...unnecessary stress.”
“I’m not going to say it wasn’t your fault,” she finally settled on, images of War Machine falling playing like a movie behind her eyes.
“In an old house in Moscow that was covered with vines,” Toni sang, barely more than a whisper that summoned all Natasha’s demons from as far back as she could remember, and then some more until she couldn’t
As he left he lab, he couldn’t help but replay the moment Stark had threaded her fingers through his. There had been no fear, no rage or grief, just joy.
who definitely wasn’t Vision, levitating in front of where the glass should’ve shattered and impaled everyone down in the street...but didn’t.
“A worthy pastime, I’m sure,” he said, the corner of his mouth quirked upwards in amusement. “And I am ashamed to admit that right now I would much rather be sitting in a pillow fort psychoanalyzing our childhoods or watching dubious pornography with you than working towards the betterment of my country in my own home.”
And if Toni was hanging off of Helen’s every word and every sensitive movement of her hands because it helped her focus on something
Aneka interrupted smoothly, if a little irritably. “My king requested that Sergeant Barnes be awake for the first airing. He may remain with you until Princess Shuri returns in two days.” She gave an uncertain-looking Bucky a nod, then left as quickly as she came.
, he had one directive alone. So he should really be forgiven for reverting to those protocols and directives, for relying on something that he himself had suppressed as the Vision.
“It’s gonna be okay, y’know?” Bucky said, repeating Steve’s words from earlier. And it was testament to the depth of their bond that had spanned seventy years that Steve looked at him and knew exactly what he was talking about.
Bucky suspected Stark would’ve answered had she not been astoundingly devoted to ensuring the circuitry of his upper arm was absolutely perfect. He couldn’t even recall her
“All good,” she said, then Steve saw her glance behind Toni, who took her cue and stepped out of the way. “Hi Bucky.” Her voice had a kindness to it that Steve had come to realize was reserved for very few people. Bucky being on that list came as no surprise to Steve.
She was facing him and stood with her arms crossed and her hip cocked to one side as she watched him, her features unreadable.
It was like a sheer curtain being drawn across her features while her limbs mechanically lost their stiffness until she exuded an almost Natasha-like composure and professionalism as she turned to face them.
“Stark,” he said in a raspy voice that sounded like gravel and smoke. Like hardened boots crunching over gritty shards of ice and glass.
“How does it feel, Colonel?” Helen asked, a shaky smile on her lips. People might have mentioned bedside manner and a doctor’s duty to distance themselves from the patient but seeing the crack in her composure and the genuine emotion on her face was beautiful. It was the
It was incredible to Laura. Her first time speaking to an AI and somehow FRIDAY had exceeded all her expectations of what artificial intelligence should sound and

The only one whose voice he couldn’t hear was Steve’s, and a furtive glance through the corner of his eye told Bucky that Steve hadn’t move an inch. There was strain in his expression and Bucky suspected that his fingers were digging into his forearms but no words left his mouth.
imagine what it’s like for you now, as a king or as the Black Panther. But I know you’re doing better than your best because that’s just what you do. And if you ever need help you have more people than you know who are willing to give it to you.”
“But I am not going to be like you,” she whispered with a fire that was so like her brother’s and yet so uniquely and beautifully different. It was a conviction, a truth branded into her very bones. “I’m smarter than you. I’m going to be
He didn’t say anything when she passed him her tablet; he simply took it as if he knew exactly what she wanted him to do with it. His hand spread across the back and absorbed all the necessary information contained within before he wordlessly handed it back to her.
. We need to talk about this man because he was a good man who had his life stripped away until all that was left was a machine. We need to talk about this man because he
And while everybody back in Wakanda has someone to compare you to, I don’t. And no one else here does. Maybe...maybe that makes our opinion matter more. The fact that all we know and see is
Nat sighed and looked towards the Compound which sat like a glowing monument surrounded by darkness. And when she thought of Toni, small and barefoot and hands covered with burns, bags under her eyes and her shoulders drooped with the weight of everything she had taken upon herself, Nat thought that yeah. Yeah, Toni deserved to be coddled, if even just a little.
that sigh but couldn’t place it. “As you wish. King T’Challa leaves for Wakanda the day after tomorrow for the panel representation announcement. We can pass the twin to him then.”
The skin around the arc reactor throbbed, still bruised. Had she not fitted her suit with its own reactor that day, she wondered if a super soldier would’ve dug right into her chest and pulled it out.
“Boss,” she said, sounding as urgent as an AI could, “someone’s just landed on the roof. West Wing, Building B.”
“He’s such an asshole,” she muttered, then automatically pouted her lips when Natasha began dabbing lipstick onto it.
“Hey,” Peter quietly coaxed, his brow furrowed with worry, dipping his head so he could see under the chin-length curtain of her messy hair. “You don’t have to do this.” He sounded so earnest Toni could almost bring herself to believe him. “We can get— I mean, Colonel Rhodes can do it or maybe Natasha—”
T’Challa finished his presentation to a louder round of applause than any of them had been expecting and Toni clapped along with the rest of them, a little sorry that she hadn’t been in her right mind to hear most of it.
Also, I'm my own beta and I do my best to proofread my own work but if there are mistakes, I am sorry and I humbly grovel for your forgiveness.
The harsh words had left his lips before he could comprehend the sheer hostility behind them, surmounting the fact that he was speaking to a
that they’re here. Not— not just them, but the others too. And then I’ll remember and it’s like all my systems are on red alert and then I’ll be
Vision had been beautiful. He had listened, unspeaking and unjudging, and Toni didn’t think she had it in her to feel that amount of love for another person outside of what she’d already given, but she
It was fitting for Natasha to be their go-between as a semi-neutral party. Toni tried not to let the darker, more bitter parts of her psyche focus too heavily on the fickle nature of spies or
The image of Laura pretending to sleep while she waited on the off chance that Clint might be coming home to her made Toni grimace and she rubbed the bone around the arc reactor.
“Steve.” He looked up into Sam’s concerned face and shifted over a little to give him room. “You okay? Okoye didn’t beat your super soldier ass too hard, did she?” he chuckled, but Steve could tell he wasn’t feeling it.
“Agent Coulson did imply that was the case. HYDRA did, after all, manage to remain undetected within SHIELD for longer than anyone could have imagined,” Vision supplied, ever cautious of his words and watching Nat closely. “Mr. Reeve’s demeanor indicates a certain degree of...overconfidence.”
Behind her, Helen was smiling beneath her mask, a sheen of exhaustion on her forehead but the dermal regenerator in one hand, held in quiet triumph like the Rod of Asclepius.
Sometimes she looked at Laura, inadvertently studying her expressions. She would playfully wrinkle her nose whenever Nathaniel’s diaper needed a change. She had the most incredibly effective eyebrow-raise whenever Lila lied about doing her chores. She got a furrow on her forehead whenever she called for Cooper but he didn’t answer.
Helen had watched her impassively; there was no trace of the excitement of innovation that she’d exhibited only a year ago. She’d spoken after a long moment.
And he’d laughed and kissed her on the forehead - her heart might have fluttered - and told her that it was a well-deserved gift for being able to synthesize Vibranium in her lab while half-dead. The gift of actual, real - holy shit it glowed the same color as her arc reactor - Vibranium felt sorely disproportionate to her achievements. She might have gone all misty-eyed but T’Challa was too much of a gentleman to mention it.
