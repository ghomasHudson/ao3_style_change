"I already ate and slept," Steve tells him, not looking up from Tony's still face.
“Last night was great, Tony. I had fun. And I’m glad we had a chance to finally… you know. Talk. Instead of-”
To him, it was only a few weeks ago. To Steve, it never happened.
"Hey kiddo, how you doing?"
"It did in the Haven," Steve says. "Doesn't mean it makes sense here."
Steve stares at him, horrified. Natasha isn't even trying to hide her laughter.
"Yeah, I get that. You know, he told me about the accident? The one you were all sent home after."
“In my defence, that meeting was only supposed to be an hour, and I didn’t eat because I had
Rhodey makes a sputtering sound, and Steve bites on his bottom lip to keep from smiling again. Tony's eyes are drawn right to the plump, pink flesh. He can't look away as Steve's perfect, white teeth dig into the skin.
“Oh my god,” Tony huffed. “Are we still talking about this?”
I'm gonna go up to the hospital and I'm gonna wake Stark up so I can tell
– Tony said that Casey's been working on a
“Yeah well, not like you could have known,” Steve brushes it off, but Stark presses on.
Steve finishes pouring Rhodey's coffee into a clear plastic cup filled with ice cubes. He adds a splash of cream to the concoction and tops it with a domed lid before sliding it across the counter to Rhodey.
Steve could swear it's like Christmas come early. Inside the case, nestled into its foam liner, are a dozen long-range comm units.
"Oh my god… you're actually serious?" Tony says in disbelief.
fast ‘cause you leave yourself wide open. Here, let me show you a few things.”
Steve doesn’t have a chance to answer as a raised voice from the far side of the room catches his attention.
+++++
Natasha gives him a look, scrunching her face up as though he's said the most ridiculous thing she's ever heard. Her leg is propped up on a stack of pillows. The medics don't think it's broken, so she's still waiting for an X-Ray while those who definitely have broken limbs are treated first.
"The orphanage on 43rd Street is at full capacity after the thing with Ares," Steve says, his tone suddenly somber. "They're having to shuttle a couple of kids out of the city."
"That's very descriptive."
"I'm fine, Buck, I promise," Steve says, exhaustion bleeding out in his voice.
"I will be," Tony assures her quickly. "Steve has some VA project thing he's working with Sam on tomorrow anyway, he needs to be up at the crack of dawn. That's why I really wanted to see him tonight."
T'Challa is working with a team to collect the dead.
"Duly noted. We'll look forward to seeing you around, Natasha," Steve says pleasantly.
"Yeah. That night in the hotel when we couldn't sleep."
They're in the bunker.
Casey's already got his face pressed up against the glass, big eyes drinking in the cookie choices. Steve is grinning as he slides over the coffee Tony hadn't even ordered yet, and a small mango lemonade. "You want something sweet, too, Tony?"
"No, it's not – you two barely even knew one another before that. So how is it that, now we're back, you guys can just pick up where you left off in the Haven? It wasn't
From behind him, Tony hears Clint let out a completely undignified squawk. “Didn’t need to know that, dammit Rogers!” he shouts. Steve looks completely unfazed and unashamed as Tony tries and fails to hold in a snicker.
"Bucky was bleeding out in the sand, we were being shot at, and I had no idea what the status of the rest of my crew was. So I did the only thing I could do. I threw Bucky over my shoulder, and ran for cover behind one of the other vehicles. Thank god Nicki and Clint made it. Dee – one of the most level headed, good under pressure people we had – helped me load Bucky into the vehicle. She said everyone was on their feet, so I called for a retreat, and the squad got the hell out of there. We didn't lose anyone that day, which is nothing short of a goddamned miracle. Though if we'd have been out there any longer, Bucky wouldn't have made it. He was in surgery for hours, and even when the docs on the base got him stable, they weren't sure whether or not he'd lose the arm. Turned out in the mess I'd torn some ligaments in my knee, and then fucked them up even worse by dragging Bucky around. Shock and adrenaline were the only reason I was still standing. Once the dust settled, Bucky was given a mandatory medical discharge. Clint and I both opted to take honorable discharges too. We were done, neither of us wanted to go back out there, and we didn't want to send Bucky home alone."
' is left unsaid, but it lingers in the air. It makes Bucky's chest ache a little to see Steve so down on himself. They all struggle with it still – they're a bunch of used up soldiers with a laundry list of issues and traumas between them. Sometimes it's impossible not to get down on themselves. But that's why they have each other, as frustrated as Bucky currently is with Steve's dumb ass. Bucky slides off the desk and wraps his arms around Steve, pulling him against his chest.
It takes a few minutes, and a bit of scrounging, but soon enough Steve and Tony both find themselves free and on their feet again, and dressed. The whole situation is a bureaucratic mess and at this point there are multiple agencies on site, and no one can seem to decide who has jurisdiction where. It’s a headache that’s going to take days to sort out. Steve desperately hopes that he can convince Maria to handle the inevitable inter-agency information sharing meetings that are going to result in the coming days.
"You got any of your own?"
Steve flashes that bright, warm smile one more time, and Tony's heart sinks. Rhodey had been right. He
Steve keeps his arms around Tony, but he pulls back slightly, tipping his head down to meet Tony's eyes.
"I'm sure."
Tony must take the choked noise for a laugh, because he gives Steve a self-deprecating grin, not quite meeting Steve's eyes.
"Cause you're the best and the nicest." Casey announces, and then takes Natasha's hand, and together the two of them walk out of the shop.
The description of the woman hadn't been particularly helpful. Average height, average build. Long, dirty blonde hair. She'd been frantic, worried about her 'brother,' Tony. She'd said her name was Angela.
They both know he’s already committed every detail of the floorplan Natasha had acquired to memory, but she doesn’t call him out on it.
you've got. You put the 'twit' in twitterpated. Your eyes did that creepy Bambi thing when you said his name. I'll show you, say it again."
Casey nods his agreement, and presses his face against the display case. "Is that one new?" Casey asks, pointing out the maple glazed apple crisp cookie.
"Lotta kids in this city could stand to be shown some love," Steve sighs. "Must be real hard for them."
"I am saying, Tony, that you and Steve have a lot of talk about. You can't just pretend this never happened."
"Yup, you're totally fine. Tooootally fine," he teases.
Steve sits in the chair, watching Tony breathe with the aid of a machine, and listening to the steady beeping noises of the heart monitor fill the room.
Tony. There's no Tony in his squad. The only Tony he knows is –
"Hey," he whispers, leaning forward and wrapping both his hands over one of Tony's. His hands feel huge and clumsy, dwarfing Tony's like this, but the contact with Tony's warm, dry skin is a balm. "Hey, welcome back."
Strange stands and moves toward the portal, waving one hand behind himself. Tony's prone body floats into the air and follows Strange through the portal into the palace's hospital, and Steve watches, despondent, as it closes.
It feels like a private moment, but Steve can't look away. He hasn't seen Tony in a week. Even though the man looks like he's been through the wringer to hell, and even though the circumstances are horrific, he's still a beautiful sight for sore eyes.
Steve shrugs.
"Love you, too, Case."
Tony rolls his eyes and sighs loudly. "What?" he finally asks, breaking first.
“Alright then,” Steve says, easing slightly. “Thanks Tony.” Thanks doesn’t begin to cover it. He can’t fully explain the way Tony saved him from his own dark backslide, how he hadn’t realised just how how afraid he was of being alone tonight.
to them about weapons, we're talking to them about transport helicopters and communications units, and you
"Okay, one more question," Tony says. Steve is really, very glad that Tony can't see the way that Steve is grinning to himself. Tony's curiosity is insatiable, no matter the subject. It's one of the many things Steve loves – likes – about him. "Why a coffee shop?"
"Steve, here," he says.
"How the hell did you know the paintballs would work? I heard you on the comms – Polyethy-?"
Steve laughs, and raises his wine glass, and hand in hand, they toast. It's not the date Tony set out to have, but he'll take it. Beside, he's got Steve, finally. Everything else is just details.
After a moment he nods, pulls his hand back and stands. He turns and sees what she'd been looking at past him – Bruce is on his way through the med tent, checking on people as he goes but definitely headed for Natasha's bedroll.
"Figured I should spend more time here to make sure the new shop is up and running," Steve replies. "You just couldn't keep away from my coffee, could you?"
Slowly, the club starts filling with people and the volume in the room begins to rise. Periodically,  the same woman would come by and offer him a drink, which he accepted. Sitting alone in a strip club not drinking would have drawn far too much attention to himself, and it isn’t like he needs to worry about getting himself drunk on a recon mission.
Steve blinks in surprise, and it’s followed quickly by angry frustration. “Maybe because I can’t have a civil conversation with you without you digging at me and pushing me away.”
To see this chapter’s illustration by acachette,
"What does that mean?" Steve asks, knowing he's talking too quietly to be heard. The deafening roar of triumphant cheering from all around them drowns out his voice entirely.
"So I bypassed the thermal coupling," Tony says. "It's not like it's that important anyway, and older components like this don't necessarily have to be attached, we can streamline the whole process."
"Wow, you guys are really stickin' to the story, aren't you?"
Natasha nods her head again. "Yes. But the two of them need to stop hiding, and talk to one another."
," Bucky snaps, hand gripping Steve's shoulder roughly, fingers digging in. It's grounding enough to bring Steve's awareness back to the inside of the elevator. "I can see the wheels turnin' in there, man, and it's
“You’ll have to try harder than that, Barnes,” Clint taunts as he darts across the space and out of sight.
"Of course you can. And a hot chocolate?" Steve asks, taking the cookie out of the case and putting it on a small red plate – because red is Casey's favourite colour.
"No! No, I
"What's wrong with the coffee cart out front?" Rhodey asks, wiping at the little droplet of sweat on his forehead. It's Wednesday, and it's only 11 in the morning but it's already upwards of 85°F. Tony doesn't care, though. Brewed Awakening has air conditioning. And, more importantly, coffee.
“The best pancakes in the city. Bar none. And they always taste better in the middle of the night. I don’t care if it doesn’t make sense, that’s just how it is. A mystery of the night.”
Steve stares. "I was actually thinking along the lines of one particular child that could use some spirit-boosting, Tony. Maybe by being added to our family."
Steve’s glad that Tony was looking at his face, because the amount of blood rushing south from just a touch was embarrassing.
The pleasure began to take over Steve’s body, making him squirm and tug at the restraints until they were taut and looked just about ready to snap. He let out another muffled moan, tilting his head back and then dipped his chin forward, catching Tony watching him like a hawk would watch its prey.
“Avengers! Assume battle positions alpha nine one!” He shouted over the destruction.
“You want breakfast or something? I can make coffee.” He offers.
He stared at the toy for a few more moments, probably remembering all sorts of memories.
“Wish it was your cock inside me.” He whines, completely unabashed by how needy he sounded. He can hear Tony’s breath hitch on the other end of the line, his breathing getting more and more erratic as the seconds tick on.
“Still blowing off steam?”
Tony reached over to grab an empty cardboard box, turning it over in his hand. “Betty Crocker, huh? I thought you old folks were all about making things from scratch.”
He could feel a warm touch on his shoulder, and when he glanced up he was looking into Tony’s concerned, chocolate eyes. For a brief moment he thought that maybe he had suffocated and this was heaven, but then his senses all came flooding back at once. He sucked in a final, long breath, nodding his head.
“What?” He said, stretching the vowels to show that he was starting to get tired of the accusing looks, though Pepper’s disapproving stare didn’t waver.
Since then he's been meeting twice a week with the company's head developers, Shuri, and has made incredible progress. Steve could see some of the life slowly coming back to him. The medical bills were expensive, but Bucky got partial funding through the company itself for agreeing to take part in trial studies, and Steve could cover the rest with his job so it was no big deal.
Steve stared at him with an astonished look on his face and Tony started laughing.
The Hulk barreled into the army, swinging his massive arms from side to side, throwing the Kree soldiers against the walls as if they were ragdolls. Even their advanced alien weapons didn’t phase the Hulk’s impenetrable skin, all it seemed to do was piss him off even more.
Steve raised his eyebrows, humming as he scrubbed at a few plates. “Well your breakfast is cold by now.”
He heard Tony chuckle, then quickly followed by the soft creak of bed springs. “Yeah? That’s hot. What were you thinking about.”
Tony didn’t dare say a word, not sure what he could even say to that. He knew what it was like to lose someone you loved, and he knew that no words could possibly make it feel any better. After some time it was Steve who finally spoke up.
Tony mulled it over in his head for a couple seconds, but he’d never been great at self-restraint and hearing Steve ask for it shot down any miniscule hint he might have had to deny him.
The Avengers sprang into action to stave the scaly beast from bringing his tirade to the city’s center. It took a big, heavy step, structural supports cracking and shattering as the beast lashed out. They were hitting their target dead on, but the lizard’s scaly hide was thick and their attacks were just seeming to piss him off even more.
On three, okay?”
Thankfully he was spared from any more techno-jargon as they turned the street corner and arrived at their destination.
His and Steve’s becoming friendly with one another was quick to turn heads, and it seemed like every media site had their own two cents to share about how Iron Man and Captain America had suddenly become besties.
Steve recognized that familiar, angry Brooklyn accent and stopped dead in his tracks.
So yeah, not one of his proudest moments, but you had to make a living somehow, right? Steve glanced down at the chat, hand still curled around his dick as he went through the comments.
Nothing could ruin this.
Tony stopped in his tracks, staring wide eyed at the familiar bald head patiently sitting behind
“Yeah, okay.”
Steve feels a dribble of pre-cum dribble out over his fingers and swipes his thumb over the head, earning a cry of pleasure and another sharp thrust from his partner.
Clint looks up in wide eyed confusion. "Uh... how did that get there?"
"Thank you for hanging out with me Steve," Casey says, suddenly a little shy.
"I'll pay attention, I promise," Tony says, straightening his spine. He really should be paying attention. He loves the fact that getting busier at Resilient means that it's necessary to have regular meetings with Rhodey. It's a great excuse to have daily BFF chats, and he doesn't want to jeopardize that.
"Give it a shot. He'll be worried about you when he wakes up, otherwise."
The loss of Steve. The loss of Casey.
She grins over at him in bright eyed excitement. "I thought you'd never ask. This way."
“Did you want to talk to me?” Steve asked.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Don't," Steve says, a little sharper than he intends. He softens his tone. "Don't be sorry. I'm okay, you're okay, you were there, you grounded me, and quickly. That's more help than you can possibly know. We got each other out of it, no harm done."
"Bucky's calling Natasha, but we need to close down the shops and meet at Tony's. Do you understand?"
at the feeling, and Tony can't help but wonder what he would have to do to make Steve make that noise again. Something fun, this time, maybe. Sucking a bruise into Steve's clavicle, maybe. Rolling one of those pert little nipples between his fingers. He wonders what noise Steve would make if Tony dropped to his knees and swallowed him down to the root – he hadn't done it in years, of course, but he'd learned to suppress his gag reflex pretty well. It's probably just like riding a bike.
Several days after Tony showed up with Casey, Steve is still thinking about it. Seeing Tony and Casey through the shop window heading down the sidewalk had been one thing, but seeing them interact in person had been something else entirely. Casey had been more adorable than Steve could have ever imagined – bright, excited, polite, funny, endearing. And Tony... Tony's incredible with his son. It had been clear since the first day he'd met Tony that Casey was the most important thing in the world to him. But it's more than just being a protective parent. Tony loves Casey with every fiber of his being. He has Casey up on a pedestal and will do whatever it takes to lay the world at his son's feet. Steve figures all parents are like that to a certain extent, but there's something special about watching Tony and Casey that made Steve's heart burst with respect and affection.
He rides for a long while, arching his back and circling his hips and grinding down to try to put as much pressure on his own prostate as he can. He knows he's chasing his own pleasure more than he's trying to make it good for Steve, but by the sounds Steve is making and the way his hands are tightening on Tony's hips, Tony can be reasonably sure he's having just as good a time.
Tony glances nervously at Steve, but then he's off again, talking almost too fast to keep up.
“Just get your sexy butt home soon,” Tony tells him, letting go the resentment, and it fades away, far back into the background.
+++++
to them? Money? Cars? Cash? Tech? I'd fucking give them anything they want if it would
"Come on," Tony says, and crouches down. Together, they manage to get Steve out of the tub without too much trouble and without him having to put any weight on his bad knee, and get him wrapped up in a towel to dry off. Steve carefully slides his boxers back on, and continues to accept Tony's offer of help to make his way back across the room to the bed. Steve pauses at the foot of it and stares, as if realising for the first time that there is, in fact, only one bed.
"Well, it's Quill," Bruce says with a little shrug.
"Are you okay?" A little crease appears along Casey's forehead as he squints at Steve, studying him hard.
It gives Tony far too much time to think.
"It's not about
that had stepped out from behind Thor and Bruce.
Rhodey nods his head in agreement and says between fits of giggles, “No, but that doesn’t make it any less amazing.”
“Tony,” Steve says, and it comes out more of a question. Tony’s throat and chest tighten.
When they get to the building, there's no list of buzzer numbers at the front entryway. There's a man sitting at a desk, looking bored but alert.
hard. The big baby.
"And I'm right."
Once they've got the source of the problem dealt with, the rest of the clean up is surprisingly easy. Easy, but messy and time consuming. Tony flies back to the site of the battle in time to see the rest of his team struggling with keeping the King Blob in place. It's not, strictly speaking, necessary. The giant blob, like its smaller counterparts, has proven to be non-lethal, and they could just follow it around its tour up towards Midtown until they'd hit it with enough paintballs to reduce it to nothing, but leaving a trail of slime and paint around the city probably isn't going to win them any favour, and honestly, a messy clean up was going to be more work for him – and for the poor kids who'd landed them in this mess in the first place.
right. Tony can feel it in his bones, down to his very core, just how right everything Steve is saying is. He
He pulls his eyes away from the dancer and continues his scan of the room. So far, there has been nothing to suggest that anything out of the ordinary is going on. No signs of HYDRA, no shady dealings, not even so much as a belligerent customer. But, the night is young. Steve sighs. At this rate, it’s going to be a long one.
"Speak of the devilishly handsome," Tony says, not moving from his spot half-behind the oven. "Steve, can you answer it and put it on speaker for me, I think I've almost got this panel open, and it's Rhodey, so…"
Tony takes the sweater and pulls it on without complaint.
Steve
"Mighty big of you," Steve laughs. How the hell is it possible to laugh when he's limping through eight inches of drifting snow and shivering so hard his teeth are almost chattering. How is it even possible that in the middle of this freezing shit show, Tony still makes him laugh? It has to be a superpower, clearly, and has nothing to do with the way that Tony makes him feel every time he's around.
That night is the best damned sleep he's had in days.
"Tony, Rhodey's here," Bruce says, pulling him out of his thoughts. He squeezes Tony's shoulder gently, and excuses himself to go and help Shuri to give Tony some space. Sure enough, Rhodey walks into the lab looking every bit as wrecked as Tony feels. It's all Tony can do to keep from flinging himself at Rhodey, and clinging with everything he's got. But Rhodey is still at his side a moment later, arms wrapped around him in a tight hug.
To see this chapter’s illustration by acachette,
At least it had been brief.
"What? No, of course I don't
If the woman bound to the chair in the centre of the room were to make an unexpected noise, if she were to move in an unanticipated way, Bucky would be on his feet and at her throat in less than an instant.
After the third bite, Steve slows down and sighs happily. "Sorry, I didn't realise how hungry I am," he apologises. "I kind of have a weird metabolism."
"Do I know you?"
"You know witchcraft," Tony corrects. "I swear to god this is the best fucking coffee I have ever had in my life and I need more of it in my face."
"I'm pretty sure we went over a few necessities of self-care when we were in the Haven," Sam tells him. "And there was more to the list than food and sleep."
But each post has impressive reach. Whoever their social media consultant is, they're good at what they do. The problem is that, the more reach and social media success Brewed Awakening gets, the more people will be around to pose a threat to Casey.
Before he can focus on the thought long enough to actually think it, all hell breaks loose.
"Come on, honey," he says, licking his lips. "Bedroom's more comfortable."
"Wow," Steve says, trying not to think about Tony and Rhodey together in some way. "So, what, that's it?"
"Tony has a meeting in Rochester with a tech start up in a few days," she informs them. "He said he wants to drive, take the day to see the countryside."
"I'm not, it's nothing like that," Tony says quickly. "Look, it was great seeing you, but now isn't a good time. I –"
“Tony, wait,” Steve calls, and Tony turns back to look at him. Tony looks tired, Steve realises, worn out, and a little sad. And in that second Steve realises. Realises that maybe he’s not the only one standing here carrying a burden on his soul. Maybe he’s not the only one who’s unsure about being alone for the rest of the night. Steve steps closer, into Tony’s space, but Tony doesn’t pull away. In fact, he leans closer, until they’re all but breathing the same air. Before he can think better of it, Steve presses a soft, feather light kiss to Tony’s mouth, hardly more than a brush of their lips. He pulls back, and Tony blinks at him in surprise. For a terrifying instant, Steve thinks he’s misjudged everything – that Tony’s laser focus on Steve all evening, the way his smiles and laughs had been abundant, the way he’d grinned at Steve like Steve was the only person on the planet – but then he sees the slow smile spreading across Tony’s face, and suddenly Tony is kissing him back, snaking an arm around Steve’s waist to hold him close. Steve closes his eyes and welcomes the moment, committing everything about it to memory, the way he can feel Tony’s heat, the way Tony’s lips feel against his, the way they reluctantly pull back so they both can catch their breath. The way it feels to drop his head to Tony’s shoulder and let out a shaky breath as Tony’s fingers rub along the small of his back.
Steve just shrugs. "That was before."
Then Vision is there, taking hold of Steve's arm, and pulling him down the hall. The sea of people parts for them, and they have a straight path to the room at the end of the hall.
When Steve had come limping down the street, face bloodied and swollen and sure to bruise, with Casey held tightly in his arms, Tony had known, then, that Steve isn't just some distraction, some infatuation. That while Tony might still think he's not quite good enough for someone of Steve Rogers' calibre, that Steve Rogers might just fit into their little family, anyway.
"Dude, I coulda seen you flirting from across the street. That was gross. You should be ashamed of yourself."
Bucky fills him in on a few of the others before he leaves. Steve only feels a little bit guilty about how relieved he is that none of his friends – the people he's closest to – had been killed in the attack. There are people dead, and he mourns for them, but anyone he'd met before two days ago is still alive and well.
"What do you mean 'that's all I'm doing?'"
Tony nods.
"Why don't you tell us, and we'll let you know when it starts ringin' bells," Bucky says, sinking into a loose, easy crouch in front of her chair. He reaches up to brush a stringy lock of hair out of her eyes, and she flinches back. "Start talkin', sweetheart."
Rhodey bursts out laughing, and he keeps laughing – no, it's more like
"I really can't thank you enough for what you did tonight," Tony says a moment later, his voice a little hoarse.
Steve is glad he doesn't have to ask Clint to grab Sam – he'd been thinking it, but for some reason the idea of putting it into words had made him feel like it would make something worse happen. Like bringing in the guy who could help with trauma counseling would somehow create trauma.
was a sarcastic remark. The fact that he hadn't gotten one is only further evidence of how terrified Tony is right now.
"He got to Loki?" Steve's voice is still raw, still lost, but it's firmer, now. Tony knows that if anyone is able to get back to business when the worst has happened, it's Steve.
"She is pretty special," Steve agrees. Natasha looks slightly pink in the cheeks, but pleased, and she ruffles Casey's hair. Steve hasn't spent as much time with her as he would have liked but it feels like she belongs in their lives, and Steve is grateful to have her there. Both for the sake of his makeshift family, and because Tony can rest easier knowing that Casey has the best looking out for him.
He needed to get out. Nowhere in the mansion was safe for him any more. Sure, he could try and hide out in the workshop, but that’s the first place they’d look for him, and he just
"So he can keep it for himself? I don't know about you guys but my memory of what Loki did the last time he had the Tesseract in hand is
," Steve shouted right back. Tony could see, out of the corner of his eye, Rhodey and Natasha exchange a look. Sam glanced back at Barnes, and Bruce was looking back and forth between Steve and Tony as though they'd lost their minds.
"Oh hush. Leave my young and stupid days out of this."
Tony had dropped him off at his meeting with the distributor, they traded numbers, and with a promise to call when he was done his own meeting, Tony left. It was well on the way to being a great day.
Fred looks at him apologetically, and shrugs. "Storm's bad. Highways are closed, your car's in a ditch. You're not going to get a tow truck tonight, let alone a ride anywhere." Tony continues to stare helplessly at Fred, who reaches over and pats Tony's shoulder gently. "You boys are safe, and sheltered. You ain't a high priority for emergency services. By morning, it should be snowed out and the roads cleared."
"Steve!" Tony says desperately. "Steve, Steve, Sandi won't take my money. Why won't Sandi take my money?"
"Friday!" he yells, looking for the emergency releases Tony builds into his suits. He can't find any – either Tony's moved them, or the new nanosuit doesn't have them. "Friday, get him out of the armour!"
"I mean it, Tony," Steve says seriously. "Thank you."
"Yeah," Tony says quietly. "From some of the stuff that Ultron got from that asshole who stole it from here. I'm sorry," he adds.
Steve nods. "Scrawny and scrappy. Not a good combination."
The suit retracts, and Tony slides his hand inside the gauntlet. He immediately feels all the power of the four stones at his fingertips, and it's almost more than he can handle – would be more than he can handle if the gauntlet weren't focusing that power and containing it. He raises his hand at Thanos as though he were about to fire a repulsor blast. He won't be able to control the power once he releases it, he's just going to be a conduit and nothing more. It's more than he'll be able to take, but the realisation leaves him remarkably calm. He'll die out here, defending the world, defending the universe. He'll die, but it will mean something. It won't be dying in a cold cave because he couldn't fight back. It won't be dying of palladium poisoning because he couldn't find a solution to the problem. It won't be living through this mess while someone else dies for him. No, he's okay with going out like this.
Before Tony can reply, he hears a strangled yelp, and snaps around in time to see some douchey looking guy fumbling with a smoke – no, an e-cig of all things – as he jumps back from a slimeball on a trajectory to his face. Secretly, Tony thinks the slime would be an improvement on the guy’s features. The guy coughs out a cloud of vapour at the slime as he finds his footing, and for a second Tony can't believe what he's seeing. The slimeball hisses and recoils, and then promptly shrivels up on the sidewalk.
"Don't sweat it," Tony says, brushing off the praise. "I like y – doing stuff for you. For the shop, I mean."
feel. That's important to me. The way I feel about you, Steve, I haven't –" Tony is cut off, then, as Steve sets his own mug of tea down and lurches forward, grabs hold of Tony's biceps with his big, warm hands and presses his mouth to Tony's.
The tall, slim man – Thor had called him Dr. Strange – turned and set his eyes on Vision. He stared for a moment, then turned to address the entire group.
Tony shifts up and then back down, easing into a smooth, gentle rhythm, riding Steve slowly. Steve's hands fly up to take hold of Tony's hips, thumbs rubbing tiny circles over his hip bones.
Even as Tony is laying down repulsor fire to keep the things where he wants them, he’s already planning ways to reinforce the labs at the university, and build better containment units for them, so the next time someone's project decides to take a walk and smell the fresh air, it wouldn't make it past the front door. He’s not nearly so delusional as to think an experiment from there will never again go awry.
"Are we?"
"Actually, we should get together because I've been thinking about getting into medical prosthetics, that kind of thing, and, I mean, who better to start with than veterans, and who better to talk to about veterans, am I right?" Tony's still talking even as he drops Sam's hand and moves toward the oven, crouches down beside it and shoves his arm down into the back, the narrow space between the oven and the wall, and starts fiddling with something that Steve obviously can't see. "I mean, Rhodey's former Air Force – he's my government liaison – but he never defers to me because he likes to be contrary, and I think it'd be nice to talk to someone who still thinks I'm kind of a big deal instead of someone who knows what I look like when I'm drooling into my pillow, you know?"
, because they
He puts it back in his ear now, letting go of Casey briefly with one arm.
Tony needs to stop thinking about Steve in a romantic capacity. Not only had they gotten off on the wrong foot, but Tony doesn't have time for romance. He hasn't had time for romance since Casey was born – that was the deal. Honestly, he's a little surprised at how easily he'd managed to develop feelings. Rumiko had been the love of his life. Since the moment she was gone, he hadn't thought he even

"Clint, I swear to god." Steve pinches the bridge of his nose, and by this point, Sam isn't even trying to hide his laughter.
"Ideally, yes. It would be really great if you could." Bucky tells him.
“Approximately two days, 17 hours and 43 minutes,” JARVIS responds. Tony groans and leans back against the counter, staring at the whiteboard hanging on the wall. They don’t
"It isn't your fault," Shuri tells him. "But thank you. Vibranium is only part of it, what is the rest?"
"Great, so they both have the emotional maturity of a blueberry. That's just peachy," Clint says. "So what's the plan? 'Cause we definitely can't just like, set them up on a date. They'll never go for it."
"No, I mean it. Like, I met you when you were 17, Tones, and I thought you were a dumb teenager, and you were really dumb. Like, I was there when you dated
He reaches down to help Tony up, and as soon as Tony's hand touches his, Steve can feel himself going clammy and sweaty and red-faced. It's stupid, he knows – Tony's just a man like any other, but the nervous, fluttery feeling in his gut tells him that Tony is different, that Tony's
“You mean where everyone checks every single word they say around you because they’re afraid you’re going to snap? Or shatter? Or both?”
knows what will happen. But Tony does it anyway.
"Can I have the mango, Daddy?" he whispers, eyes big. "And a treat?"
When Steve had brought Casey back to him, Tony had – he doesn't have words for how he'd felt. Relief is too mild a term. His chest still aches with it, with setting eyes on Casey.
“But. I don’t want you to feel obligated to spend time with me. Or feel like I’m some kind of responsibility. It’s okay, really.”
"I don't know," Steve says, suddenly swamped with guilt. How
It's a joke, but Steve doesn't look like he finds it very funny.
, that they're back home, he feels an ache in his chest, like the glass shards of a broken heart pressing angrily into his sternum. Whatever had happened in Haven was nothing.
“Honestly, I don’t know. I mean, I just watched you beat up bad guys stark naked, and I gotta admit that’s definitely going to fuel more than one fantasy, so really, I’m kind of hoping to take you home and do very inappropriate things to you. Repeatedly. In several different ways.”
him."
Tony shakes his head. “Nothing about you is normal, Steve.”
Rhodey snorts and rolls his eyes. "Of course you do. And I'm sure I'll have your full attention for the entirety of the meeting, and you won't be ogling the barista the whole time."
"Before what?" Bucky presses.
"Oh, God, Steve, he's okay?"
(See the end of the chapter for
He shivers a little as he washes himself down with the hotel soap. It's not a shiver of chill, not this time. Just his body coming down from what was, frankly, a pretty good orgasm.
Before he can go too far down that path of self-loathing, there's a knock on his door.
"Well," Steve says, slightly uncomfortable and awkward, because of course he would be, after that. "I'd better get back to –" he cuts himself off, but jerks a thumb over his shoulder to indicate the counter. The counter which is dead, with no customers, and not even the barest hint of a mess that might need wiping.
"Look, Tony, I really appreciate your help but if you have a meeting, I mean, I can call someone, it won't be –"
, he would note that it was a beautiful sight.
to change the subject, he knows. Something safer. Something that pulls Steve's focus away from Rhodey's comment — a comment for which Tony will later murder him, of course. But Tony is so stunned that Rhodey would have the
Clint looks around dumbly, but once he sees the practise battle is over, his 'dumb confusion' morphs into wicked, plotting evil. He draws another arrow, and shoots it straight at Bucky. It's non-piercing, but leaves a giant pink patch right on the chest of Bucky's pristine black tac gear. "Pew pew, motherfucker."
"Well, I don't think it's the thermostat, but I have to pull it out to check the control panel. And it could be something like the rear burner assembly – you might think it would have nothing to do with the oven itself, but sometimes with these older models where they just started putting in some of the more complex electrical connections, if one thing goes out the whole system shuts down."
Tony and Rhodey had stood down, and Vision had done his gliding-flying thing out to the field, and they'd greeted the
Tony chokes and sputters on his coffee.
"We reached an understanding, He was just worried about his son."
"Well, shit, if Tony's going, I'd better go, too. If I leave him in some alternate universe without supervision, he'll do something real stupid, and then where will we be?" Rhodey chimed in.
Steve had said he'd keep an eye out. He'd said Casey would be safer
"How long have we been under?" Bucky asks, glancing around the room. His eyes keep tracking in Steve's direction, but Tony refuses to take the bait.
"Jesus Christ," Tony says, muffled against Steve's shoulder. "Fuck."
Tony nods. "Remember e-cig douche guy?" Steve hums in agreement. "When the thing attacked him, and he coughed out a cloud of vapour, the slime ball shriveled and recoiled. Polyethylene glycol, it's an ingredient in that type of e-cigarette. It is also," Tony pauses for a hint of drama, "an ingredient in the type of paint used specifically in paintballs."
"The last time I asked Clint to make us cannolis he told me that not only is he not our personal baked goods chef, he has never made cannolis in 'real life', and the next time I asked he would be shoving Bucky's metal arm somewhere that would change my pitch when I tried to sing the Star-Spangled Man."
Steve had insisted.

to end up in the same place working. And if they
It’s not doing much to improve Tony’s mood.
"Okay, first of all," Tony says, flipping up his faceplate so they can talk face to face, "normally I would tell you to stuff the apology, but, I was just sitting down to a date which got interrupted by all this –" he waves his hand around "– so, instead I'll say thank you. Apology accepted."
Tony balls his gloved hand into a fist, and the sky swirls with darkness. There's a scream, a howl of pain and rage as Tony points that fist at Thanos, and a beam of light shoots out of his hand. It's like the repulsor beam and yet nothing like it at the same time. The howl of pain is Tony, screaming at the unbearable energy flowing through him, through his fist, aimed right at the Titan.
It turns out the customers really like Clint's experimentation as well, and the apple crisp cookies sell like crazy. Next thing Steve knows, the cases are stocked with an array of maple themed baked goods, and Clint is just over the moon. It actually starts to feel like they're really getting their footing, and that the three of them really are building a civilian life – and a good one, at that.
Besides – he'd always done well with hand-to-hand combat.
stay away forever. For one thing, he’d miss Steve too much, and he’d be hard pressed to convince Steve that they should run away and live naked on a private island together. So, eventually, he made his way back, trying his best to sneak into the kitchen unnoticed to grab some food. The ‘unnoticed’ part didn’t end up working too well, considering the size of the group hanging around the large kitchen island, but before he could say anything to them or them to him, Tony felt strong arms encircle him from behind, pulling him into a broad chest.
To see this chapter’s illustration by acachette,
Eventually, when he can't stand waiting anymore, he packs up the shop and goes to make himself ready, swapping out the dirty shop jeans for a clean pair, with a clean shirt. He drives himself out to the airport, taking time to stop to pick up a bouquet of flowers and a box of the pistachio chocolates that Steve can't seem to get enough of. It's cheesy and romantic, and Tony gives exactly zero fucks about that. Even with the stops, he still arrives at the private area of the airfield early. It's agony, having to wait, and he stares up into the sky, watching for the approaching Stark Jet for so long that he nearly ends up getting a crick in his neck. But it's worth it to see the plane make its final approach, and landing, taxiing towards the terminal and spiriting his love to him.
Bucky snorts again, louder this time. "Sure, maybe not. But that's not gonna apply to you and Stark."
"Yeah. There's a tech start-up there we're meeting with about a project we're looking to get going on. So I booked a meeting with them to tour the space and throw some ideas around. I don't really want to be away from Casey overnight, so I was going to leave first thing in the morning and come back that night."
"Yeah," Tony agreed. "It –" Tony hesitates, draws in another steadying breath, and presses on. "It was the best, and worst day of my life. I got Casey, but I lost Rumiko." Steve feels Tony shift again, rolling onto his back so they're both laying side by side, staring up at the ceiling in the dark. "It's honestly crazy to think about. All the advances we have in medicine, in health care... we had the best medical team that we could, and it still wasn't enough. Things just... happen. It, uh, it was a hard pregnancy for her. She was sick, and in pain a lot. But she wanted to go through with it. The doctors were amazing, they took such good care of her the whole time. The birth itself was really hard, but she pushed through. She never gave up on anything, Rumiko. But... right after he was born... I don't know what happened. Her blood pressure skyrocketed, and um, she started hemorrhaging. They couldn't stop the bleeding in time. They tried so hard." This last comes out as barely a whisper.
"Clothes, and a ride home. You know, I'm pretty sure this is not the first time I've had to do this for you," Rhodey teased.
"Buck –"
"I… yes?" Because of course it'd been good. Steve is probably the best thing to happen to Tony. And if last night is any indication, the spark is nowhere near the vicinity of being in danger of dying.

"One person won't be enough," Strange interrupted. "If we're going to do this – it's going to be a pocket reality. Completely separate from ours, and it can't be tied to ours in any way. We can't just send Vision to an existing reality – Thanos already has the Reality stone, he'd be able to find you too easily. Especially if he finds Loki and gets his hands on the Space stone. We have to make an entire reality from scratch, and it's not enough to just send the two of you. If Thanos gets through us, if he
"It's – Wow, Sir, it's good to meet you, too. I'm real sorry about, well, taking your shield and trying to arrest you the last time we met, it was, um, I mean, Mr. Stark said you were breaking the law, so I was –"
"You don't think the lemonade is enough of a treat?" Tony asks, keeping his voice light. Not that he doesn't have every intention of getting them something out of that case, but he doesn't want Casey to realize how spoiled he is.
"Careful, there's a group of three trying to make a break for it down the alley to the west," Natasha calls.
"You're welcome. Also, I'm still gonna give you shit about it. Like, as often as possible."
+++++
"First of all," Tony says, trying to sound offended, "I won't be
Clint scoffs and waves him off. "That's not the same. I didn't know you were into guys, you can't blame me for that."
"That was weeks ago. How did I not know?"
Tony grins, comes around the desk to wrap Rhodey in a hug. He can't help but think about the hug he'd shared with Steve. Coincidentally, the hug he'd received for fixing the oven, which was why Tony had missed that meeting in the first place.
"Well, I'm glad that's settled," Tony chimes in. "Now you, mister, should be going to bed. It is your bedtime after all."
Mission. Fucking. Accomplished.
, no one in the government or government-adjacent wants to deal with Tony directly.
The second time that Steve had woken up in the hospital after the helicarriers went down, Sam had stepped out and Tony was sitting in his place, holding vigil at Steve’s bedside with an enormous vase of flowers.
"Stay sharp," Steve says, knowing he doesn't need to say it. Clint is always sharp, even when he looks like he's napping at the desk in the office in the shop, feet up and hat over his eyes.

was safe from them. He’d managed to duck out from a grilling by Bucky and Sam when Clint walked in with Logan following a few steps behind, looking surlier than usual. Probably that meant that Tony should stay and check in to see what was going on with Wolverine and the rest of Xavier’s team, but self preservation won out.
Tony leads Steve out to the living room, taking a quick detour to the kitchen to pick up their tea. He sits on one end of the sofa, watching as Steve takes the other.

“We sure did,” Tony chuckles. He doesn’t add how incredibly hot it was standing toe to toe with Steve, the tension crackling between them right from the get go.  “And you were really sassy to me.”
"Look, you love each other. You trust each other. You're right for each other. Just
"Yeah, I got that," Tony says.
They dump their haul on the dining room table, then Clint comes back into the living room with the plastic case. He unzips it, and flips it open on the coffee table in front of Steve. "Look what I found," he says triumphantly.

Casey is safe.
"Our lives are insane," Tony protests. "We can't have babies."
And Tony Stark
"Nah, he was air force. Pararescue."
"It's Tony," Natasha tells him. "Tony is the one who's pulling away. But he won't talk to me, either. I've tried."
"Mr. Stark, I understand your concern –"
"No, stay on Tony," Steve orders.

, and he had fallen more deeply in love than he'd ever thought possible.
He asks a lot about his time before the plane went down. Tony leaves Bucky to field those questions, but he always stays close by. So does Sam.
It was never supposed to be like this. He wasn’t supposed to wake up.
The three of them make it back to the main area of the Palace to find the whole place in total battle prep mode. The civilians have all been evacuated into bunkers, and additional shields have gone up around the city. Okoye and the Dora Milaje are heading up the united band of fierce warriors that have come together to defend their home and fight for their people, establishing a perimeter, and running through various tactical plans. Steve is with them, listening intently, so Tony allows himself a moment to stare, eyes lingering on the man he knows so well, and not at all.
+++++
He talks to his counsellor about it, and she suggests that maybe he needs to work on giving himself permission to make connections here, that doing so doesn’t mean he’s giving up on what he had before, or make the past any less meaningful.
Tony takes a deep breath, and then another, willing himself calm. "Okay. Right. You're right. He is in good hands."
So he bolted. Up the stairs and down the corridor, breathing a sigh of relief once he realised that no one was following him. Thank god for small mercies. He picked his way carefully down the hall towards the back side of the mansion. Maybe, if he was really lucky, he’d be able to sneak down one of the back stairwells and buy himself some time to catch his breath without having to face off against the onslaught of nosy superheroes.
They pull up the address on Google Maps, and using satellite view, Steve starts formulating a plan.
“Apparently,” Steve says gently. “It’s okay, sweetheart. I’ll be back soon.”
Steve had almost dropped the phone when Tony had said those three horrible words. All his combat and tactical training had taken a back seat for a moment, and all he felt was frozen terror. He had sagged against the wall, just in time for Bucky to come to the back and find out why he'd run off on the phone.
Steve sighs, pouring Tony's customary coffee and pulling a cannoli out of the case for him. The cannolis, as well as most of the other pastries in the case, Clint had made the previous evening in the Brooklyn kitchen. "My oven's broken," he says. "I've just spent the morning trying to fix it, and I don't think it's working out. In fact, I'm pretty sure I'm just managing to make it worse. I've had at least a dozen customers who came in here looking specifically for cinnamon buns, because apparently everyone knows that Wednesday is cinnamon bun day, and I can't deliver because my oven is basically about as useful to me as a pile of scrap metal. I should probably just call a repair company, but god only knows how much that's going to set us back, and if they tell me that we need to replace it that's going to be an even bigger mess – Jeez, Tony. Sorry. Just forget all that, I shouldn't be unloading on you."
Well, mostly well. Clint has some healing ahead of him, but he's the worst off, other than Tony.
when you really actually like someone." Tony scoffs, but Rhodey continues. "Lucky for you, Steve was flirting right back."
“Fancy meeting you here,” Steve says as he eyes Tony standing beside him, as naked as he is.  Tony very obviously eyes him back. Unlike Steve, Tony doesn’t appear to make any effort to keep his eyes above Steve’s neck.
It's not until the third time Bucky calls his name that Steve is able to lift his eyes and work through the rushing blood in his ears. Bucky's face is pale, his eyes wide, and he's grasping Steve's shoulders in both hands.
"I know," Steve whispers.
Hunka – Stevie? – rolls his eyes at Man-bun and turns his ridiculous knee-weakening smile in Tony's direction. "Hi there," he says, voice warm and rumbling and honey-smooth. "What can I do for you?"
"Well," Tony says carefully. "Thank you. For, you know."
“Because you were avoiding me!” Steve retorts. “Look, what do you want me to say? Just… tell me.”
"I'll go, too," Clint said. "You guys are gonna need someone to keep a proper eye out for trouble."
"Well, Clint can't really go until next week, because he's supposed to be teaching Angela some of the baking side of things. And I've got all kinds of appointments this week that I really don't want to reschedule. I know it's a huge thing, but it really would be great to set this up."
"You got it," Steve says with a warm smile.
"I will ready our defences in case Thanos makes his strike here," T'Challa says. "Captain?"
"So, what, you're just gonna run in like the cavalry and
"So, you're saying you don't love him."
, and he's Tony
"You know, tub's pretty big, I can always just sleep in that," Steve says lightly, though Tony wonders how much of a joke it really is. But, honestly, it's a terrible suggestion, and as much as Tony isn't sure how he's going to to make it through the night with a practically naked Steve laying next to him, he's not about to resort to anyone sleeping in a bathtub.
"Okay, fine," Tony agrees, and holds out his arm. "At least let me give you a ride home?"
"Because all you talk about is how nice Steve is, how generous and kind and friendly, but every time
Rhodey is giving him a

"Our lives
“–the hell was that?” Steve finishes at the same time.
"Right," Tony agrees, "But now we're back in real life, so why isn't he?"
+++++
"Tony, come on," says Rhodey, from Tony's other side. "You know they're right. We gotta do this together. It's the only hope we have of getting Casey back."
“But after that, I have no idea. Not like I’m great at this.”
going to go right through us, and then through everything else in his path," Steve said, this time his voice is flat. Like he's tired of fighting – tired of fighting the world, the apocalypse, even tired of fighting Tony.
"So that's why you try and hire vets?"
," Casey squeals into his ear, and even as Tony winces at the volume, he thrills in the sound of it. This is his boy.
Worse, Casey had never existed.
Steve reluctantly pulls back, gripping Tony's shoulders to hold him at arm's length. Tony's eyes look a little unfocused, his cheeks a little pink.
"It doesn't sound dumb," Steve tells him. "It sounds like you're a dad who loves his son, and doesn't want him to worry."
"I don't know what you're
"Yeah," Steve breathes, heart racing. "Good thing."
It’s been a week since Steve has seen Tony, and longer since they’d had an interaction that hadn’t ended in them hurtling angry words at each other, and he’s forgotten just how good it feels to fight and banter with Tony at his side. He’s missed this, and he aches for the friendship they could have had if they could just… find a way to make it work.
Tony looks like he's about to say something else, but at that moment Fred comes back.
“Two days, 17 hours, 34 minutes,” JARVIS informs him.
Stark just waves him off and crossed the open space. “You underestimate what a stubborn bastard I am, and how often people are dicks to me. It’s fine, I get it. SHIELD has a way of winding people up tight, and you, my friend, had had a hell of a week.”
It's not the same as it had been in the Haven, and yet it is. He looks wan and tired, too still and pale, but he has the same little scar over his left eyebrow as he always has. Steve knows that if he were to wake up and smile, the smile lines would be deep, and that little dimple on his right cheek would be visible. He knows intimately the golden flecks in the deep brown of Tony's eyes, and allows himself a moment to hate the tape keeping them closed.
“Yeah,” Steve mumbles.
But it’s not newfound beauty, it’s reflection of Steve’s feelings. It doesn’t matter, that Tony has scars that run scary deep across his chest, that he has these empty eyes sometimes, that he smells, that he always looks tired, that there is a glowing machine in his chest. He is beautiful because Steve loves him. If he was a cup of slime, Steve would still love him. His heart would still ache, and he’d still fight these tears. Because he
It could be hours and hours later, until Steve asks:
, Steve knows that whatever he does or doesn’t do when Tony is concerned, he will regret it. The paparazzi, though, now they’re a problem, and Steve wonders how they can shake them off. The paparazzi don’t really bother Steve that much, he really doesn’t do interesting stuff in public, at least when he’s alone, and there’s just so many pictures and articles one can make about Captain America running the same lap 25 times in a row. Tony, on the other hand, attracts paparazzi, reporters, and every media personnel, like flowers attract bees.
“Do you think we’ll marry each other?” The question slips out, and Steve thinks he’s stupid for asking something like that. Especially from Tony, who has, well, the reputation he does.
“I don’t hate myself. At least, because of my sexuality”, Tony says. There’s a pause, and Steve can practically hear Tony thinking what to say next. The wind grows stronger and pushes through Steve’s jacket and creeps into his pant legs. It feels cold, and it must be quite late, because the meadow looks darker now, and the sky has grown to be a deeper shade of grey with tinges of orange and red.
“Oh, I really hadn’t planned on anything specific.” Steve fleetingly wonders, if Tony finds dealing with the media at all enjoyable, as far as Steve can tell, Tony doesn’t, but at least knows how to handle them. That’s one step up from Steve.
“Yeah. And you?” Tony answers. His voice just barely audible.
They stop eventually. How long they sat in the car, Steve doesn’t know, it could have been anywhere from hours to just a few minutes, he lost the sense of time sometime between the elevator ride, and the walk to the car. Steve doesn’t know where they are, but somehow, he can’t find the energy to care. It’s a forested area, but there are manmade paths with dark brown sand. There definitely are less people around, but it’s not deserted. Tony looks out of place, his clothes, belongings, and aura breathe success, money, and anxiety. Steve glances at his own clothes, after he stuffs the sketchbook back into the back bag, and thinks that his clothes aren’t any better, even if he is just wearing a light jacket, white long-sleeved shirt, and blue jeans. His shoes are lived in, but still quite new-looking. Tony’s shoes are black leather. Tony drags his shoes on the ground and says something Steve doesn’t hear.
He still holds Tony’s hand, when he puts the pen between the pages of his sketchbook, and clumsily tucks them into his back bag. Tony’s chatter fills Steve’s head, and his heart. A gooey happiness oozes out of Tony’s hand into Steve’s bloodstream, and it soon fills his whole body. Steve smiles, and thinks that he doesn’t have to be in control all the time, and that some lines in his life he can learn to cross over, and erase.
“The world is just so different. Back in my time… Back then, you couldn’t be openly queer. The words we used, how we talked about people like, like me – like you – I hate it. I hate it. And I guess, that’s why, I feel like this. Like I don’t deserve to be me, or to be happy. Because I’m disgusting and effeminate, and, and inverted. I know – I can analyse it to the end of the world, why I think and feel the way I do, but – I don’t want to anymore. I just want to be. Be me and be happy and content”, Steve says. Tony nods understandingly and waits for Steve to continue.
Steve wonders, and it’s like he finally knows what it means to be in love. How heart aching it is. Why love makes you cry. How it redefines what beautiful means.
“No, it’s okay. You’re doing fine”, Steve eventually chokes out.
“I have never said that out loud”, Steve says.
“Makes it easier. I think you already know. Don’t you?”
Tony runs into Steve in the elevator. He’s coming from, somewhere – he doesn’t tell, and Steve doesn’t ask. He’s wearing nothing special. He might have been fiddling with something in his workshop, or one of his labs, or he was coming from a date, or job thing, or anywhere really. He takes one look at Steve, who is standing in front of the elevator. Smiles a Tony Stark-smile, but it’s weak, and cracking in the edges. He steps out of the elevator, and stands close to Steve, but not really. There’s an infinitely wide gap between them, as if they were standing on two mountaintops next to each other, able to see one another, but unable to say or communicate in anyway. But, Steve thinks, that’s perhaps how Tony wants it to be, or maybe he doesn’t know how to climb to Steve’s mountain top, or he isn’t sure how to tell Steve that he doesn’t know how to get down, and he needs help. Today, though, Steve’s mind is too slow, and too unfocused to figure out which option it is, and if he should even care.
Actually,
“I don’t know. Does it matter?” he asks, his hand stroke Steve’s bicep. Tony has cold hands.
There. In the light, that slowly pours in from in between the blinds, Tony looks so beautiful. His heart aches in a full, empty way. It doesn’t skip beats, rather the beat stays exactly the same. But it feels like its air, not blood it’s pumping.
, and then another thick cloud of silence as they ride the elevator to the ground level together.
“So what you’re saying is that – you love me?” Steve whispers into Tony’s skin.
“But you know, just because we don’t get married doesn’t mean that this isn’t real. Even if we broke up tomorrow, it wouldn’t change this moment.”
“Oh… I’m sorry for assuming.”
But he doesn’t erase the warm colored lines off the page, doesn’t tear the page out, doesn’t cover the drawing with something. He lets it be. Sometimes he just needs to push out a bad idea, a bad drawing, to make room for better things. He leaves the sketchbook open on his desk; lets the drawing air out a bit. Perhaps it’ll look better once it breathes alone.
– deflected the question on his behalf and started talking about something else. It was good, that he hadn’t asked what the letters stood for, he doesn’t even like to think about how he would have reacted or what he would have said. He researched it when he got the chance to be alone, sure that no one would walk in on him. LGBT, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. On some websites, he noticed, some letters, like A or Q or even the plus-sign, had been added to the end, but the stem of the acronym stayed the same. There were several new words he had to look up, and several words that weren’t in the use anymore, as far as he could tell. That was good, Steve had thought, he never quite liked those words – especially when they had left his own mouth, and how they seemed to sour the air around them.
