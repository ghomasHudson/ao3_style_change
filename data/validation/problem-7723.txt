“Lead the way,” he said, wincing again when this time Nat squeezed his arm a little too tight. Jesus, what had he done to invoke the wrath of the redheads?
A distressed noise of his own erupted out of Tony then, and he went straight to Steve, distantly realizing the the tears had broken free, and were dripping down his face. “I’m sorry, Steve, I’m sorry, I’m so so sorry…” he said it over and over as he looked over the wound, made sure that it had cauterized. At least it worked, thank fuck for that, he hadn’t hurt Steve for no reason. It might stick with Tony for the rest of his days, what he had knowingly done to a friend, to Steve, but now Steve might have time for the team to find them. He might get out of this alright. That was all that really mattered.
listen,” Tony interrupted, dropping the laughter and leaning down. “You tried to take my suits, you fuck, which was mistake number one. But now I know about the rest of it, Stern, and I’m coming for you. You and the other miserable bastards like you.”
“Okay, Tash, spill,” Tony said as soon as no one was around.
but the more Tony thought of it, the more the idea grew on him. Steve could relax and hang out at the pool or the ocean while Tony was in meetings, and then in the evenings they could get dinner together and watch movies and do all the stuff Tony loved to do with the team, but just the two of them.
“Uh no, Captain Pessimistic. I want you to take a break. Sometimes doing that will let you come back with fresh eyes and a new perspective,” Tony said. It was probably ridiculous to suggest Steve take a vacation at all, let alone go off with
“I’m sorry, Steve.”
In answer, Tony moved forward, gently reaching out to gather Steve in his arms. Bruce had patched him up while Tony had gotten the suit, and now a proper bandage covered Steve’s side, keeping his injury hidden away for the time being, but Tony knew what was underneath. Burnt, torn, mangled flesh, caused by Tony’s carelessness.
“Thanks, Tony,” Steve said again, accepting the mug Tony held out. “You’re a great friend, you know that?”
“I think we need to remain, your JARVIS indicated that you would need some help,” Thor said firmly, grasping onto Tony’s shoulder to keep him from bolting away. Despite his vow to not show any other weakness in front of the god or Cap, Tony winced. Fuck. Apparently there was a rather bad bruise there.
“I’ve no idea what you’re talking about, Banner. But, I’m glad I’ve got your attention. I’ve been meaning to ask you about a few things. For one, I would like your assistance in setting up an electronic mail, so I may speak with Jane when she is away,” Continuing to ramble on as they headed to the kitchen, Thor kept his voice light while they walked down the hall. Some of the tension fled the room as they did, though Tony noticed Clint still radiated fury and Natasha had her eerie calm face on.
“S’all right, Cap. I knew it was you,” Tony admitted with a yawn. He’d told the team they could stay in the guest quarters in the Tower. When he heard the footsteps, and the tired heaviness that accompanied them, he knew immediately it was Steve. Guess he wasn’t the only one unable to count sheep. “What are you doing up so early?”
It was fear.
“It happens to a lot of people, Tony,” Bruce said quietly. “Would you like me to help you up?”
Jesus, it had been a day.
They’d made progress. He contented himself with that while staring at the latest facts and figures from DoDC. Thor’s girlfriend, Jane, and her intern, Darcy, had indeed moved into the Tower. They spent most of their time trying to reconnect to the bifrost, (looping in a reluctant, but dedicated Bruce) so that Thor could return to Asgard and see if his friend Heimdall could find Loki. In the meantime, Darcy also worked with Thor on checking Twitter hashtags, as there were quite a lot of groupies dedicated to the God of Mischief. Sightings and claims that Loki was still on Earth would pop up every once in a while, and Darcy would work with Thor on what could be legit and what could not.
“Are you alright?” she asked eventually, when his body stopped shaking and he was breathing steadily on his own.
Bruce saw him and hurriedly added, “But I think he’s going to be okay. The serum seems to be doing it’s work already. Can you get him into the jet for me, Tony?”
Running her hands over her face, Pepper took several deep breaths, then sent a watery smile at him. “You’re right. You won’t stop. I know you won’t. Why am I not surprised that the one thing I fail at in my entire life is getting you to stop?”
Laughing, Steve leaned into Tony’s touch a little, and it was all Tony could do not to wrap his arms around the captain, and engulf him completely. DUM-E chirped once more, approvingly this time, and went off to go make what Tony assumed as an inedible smoothie he would have to pretend to love.
“Because I can’t watch you die again!” Pepper shouted, the mask breaking. Face crumpling, she stepped toward Tony, tears glistening in her eyes. “I sat on that plane and I
“No, no,” Tony hurried to assure him. “You picked things up faster than anyone would have ever thought, Cap, it’s not that. I guess…you’re our leader, and a great one at that, and you’re always worrying about us, and I just…who worries about
He stood, straightening his tux jacket, rather enjoying the way Stern looked like he was about to piss himself. Pleased, Tony turned to exit the library, when he caught sight of Natasha stepping inside, apparently tired of waiting for him to show.
That started smoking.
“I was supposed to make you leave, make you get some rest. But we both know that wasn’t gonna happen, so I didn’t even bother. Now your Science Bro is annoyed, and is coming down here to fetch you himself. If you pretend you’re asleep, he might not yell at us.”
“What? Of course I…oh. Sorry.” Lowering his arm, he disengaged the gauntlet, and pressed his face into Steve’s hair. “Please tell me you have Bruce.”
“And what, sit on my ass and pretend I can’t help? What the hell, Pep, why would you think I would do that?”
“Cap.”
“Ah.” Bruce coughed, and then pointed to the ceiling above him. Letting his gaze follow Bruce’s Tony glanced up to see mistletoe hanging over him and Natasha.
“‘Kay,” Steve mumbled, his eyes drooping.
“Very funny. You know I’m not a botanist Tony.”
, Tony. You’ve earned a break. Let them handle it, let Thor deal with Loki. Come back with me to Malibu.”
Steve pushed all the way, keeping Tony from squirming. He was drawing this out and Tony could only lay there and beg for more.
Here, he'll say whatever Steve wanted to hear if it meant he'd continue to drill Tony harder into the bed, even if Tony wouldn’t ever dream of saying it in another scenario.
The thought of it made Tony's chest ache, the thought of this ending so soon. He's grown attached to Steve, he's never felt anything like it before. Tony would even go on to say that he loved Steve—deeply loved him. He's never said it before, he was afraid to in the case Steve took it the wrong way. He craves the witty banter between them, or the times when they try cooking and failing to make an edible meal for the team, or even when they sit in comfortable silence with their arms around each other.
The brunet snorts, “Yes, because a porcelain doll can grow facial hair.”
When it finally pressed towards his entrance again, he understood what it was. A Knot.
Tony pulled back and licked the excess away before looking at Steve. "Well, if it did or didn't work, you're going to have to keep doing that," Tony said with a deadpan face."Like fuck, that was amazing." He went to lay down again, his back didn’t feel much like holding it up. If he were any other creature, he would fear that Steve blew his back out. Not that it would be much of a problem in his book anyway, the next time would only mean he didn’t have to worry about his back.
Steve," but instead of his own name being grunted into his ear, it was the whine of a wolf.
"You don't
Steve smiled sheepishly and placed a kiss on his nose. "We can stop now. If you want to....I'm not sure if it's going to be an option next time." Steve chewed his bottom lip again and Tony placed his hands on Steve's face.
Either way, this makes the bonding thing sound more and more difficult by the second. With a loud groan of annoyance, he pressed his head in his hands. "I'm such an idiot. This isn't going to work at all."
Steve squirted some lube onto his entrance, which caused Tony to hiss slightly from the temperature. He's often cold, being undead has that effect on him, but being surrounded by something as warm as Steve changes his temperature enough to be affected by the cold lube. It didn't last long though because Steve was pushing a finger into him and the cool gel left his mind. He was already whining from the intrusion, feeling his cock bob in interest.
Steve lifted a small black box and opened it, revealing a black band wedged into a velvet cushion. "You proposed to me. And I've been meaning to do it first, as you can see," He lifted the box slightly. "But you did it instead."
"And you can make me. I can take it. Just get me off on your fingers, you have to stretch me out, right?"
“You look beautiful, Doll,” Steve said from in between Tony’s leg. Steve isn’t really good at dirty talk, everything he says is mostly a praise he gives to Tony. With anyone else, he would brush it off or deliberately moan over it so he wouldn’t have to hear it but with Steve, he would go uncharacteristically silent or throw out a witty retort. And in this case, it was the latter, but before the other could promptly respond, Steve was already pushing in another, curling and massaging Tony's prostate and causing him to moan instead. With the amount of anticipation prior and the thought of what’s next—Steve’s large member stretching him—Tony didn’t think he’d last long.
Steve nodded. "I knew you didn't know exactly what it meant and I was afraid you didn't know what you were getting into. But you said...You loved me...So I figured.." Catching onto his mistake, he looked away and sighed. "I should've told you out front. I should've explained everything to you but I didn't, and I'm sorry. I was just scared you'd never offer ever again. It was awful of me." And now he was rambling.
"So..." Tony started as Steve made his way back to the nest. "...What you're saying is?"
Steve still wasn't moving and Tony knows it's because the other wants him to adjust but, right now, he just wants to be used. So the best way is to physically show he’s read rather than wait. He bucked his hips against the other, feeling the head of his cock rub against his prostate. "Ah, Fuck!" He swore, his eyes snapping shut. Just as he heard a surprised grunt from above him.
Werewolf Bonding.
And the sex was good too.
was what he got, just not in the way he thought it would.
Steve scoffed, a faint smile still gracing his pink lips. "You're a pain, you know that?"
Tony couldn't help but tease the blond. "What are you going to do if I don't?" His dark lashes fluttered innocently up at him.
Steve paused but slowly nodded. He seemed to be having an internal battle against himself, but it appears he got over it because he was speaking not too long afterward. "You might do that multiple times."
"Will you bite me again or was that a one-time thing," As Tony said it, he reached up to where the bite was and was met with some gauze. He raised a brow and looked at Steve. "You patched me up?"
Steve frowned again but didn't protest. He shuffled closer, positioning himself outside Tony's entrance and slowly pushing in.
Steve grinned.
to," Steve argued. "It's just more than likely that you will."
Tony snorted. "Doggy Style? Figures." He shook his head afterward. "I know, I like seeing your ugly mug too, you look so focused and open, it's cute. You're cute. But there will have to be some sacrifices, darling."
"I'm not pointing anything, doll."
"Hey Steve, sorry that I didn't show up earlier, I kind of fell asleep. You know we don't have to do this if you don't want to."
Tony didn't get it at first but when he did, his eyes widened. "What? Me? But I'm not even a furry."
It was like a small nest. Sheets upon sheets were in the center, along with towels and a few pillows.  Around the cluster of blankets were various items, two bottles of lube (Steve always liked to be prepared), water bottles, a first aid kit, some extra towels, and another folded blanket. And to box everything in, some furniture was set up around the area.
"No, we can't rush this."
, fuck, I love you so much, please!" Tony rambled, words spewing out. He never had much of a filter in bed, only barely able to keep certain things in. He’s learned how to, back during his playboy days. He’d often scream out the wrong name and it never ended well.
Steve didn't relent, only pressing his finger in and out, placing gentle kisses on the back of Tony's thighs. Tony’s toes curled and he went to bucky his hips upward in an attempt to get more friction but Steve pressed his hand down to keep him in place. He pressed in another finger, scissoring the digits to stretch him out
Tony was excited for the most part, only slightly nervous as he always is with Steve. It's not that he doesn't trust Steve, it's the idea that Steve can break him if he wanted to, and vice versa. They are enemies, after all, made to kill each other. Or, at the very least,  do a lot of damage.
It took another finger inched through his rim for Tony to see white and Steve's name falling from his lips.
Steve squirted lube along his cock, spreading it generously and adding more to the point that it was leaking off of him, he was being extra cautious with this. He also added more lube along Tony's entrance, having his finger scoop some that escaped and push it inside. This amount of care was a nice thought but Tony was impatient and irrational, his cock already nearing full hardness again.
“I’m serious about the doggy bed, hun.”
Steve nodded and tilted his head to the side. Tony got into position but before sinking his teeth in, he asked, "Did it work?"
"I can take it, Cap. And if you haven't noticed, I enjoy having you in me, I was bound to come off your cock more than once eventually."
Tony watched him and nodded. "Just sore. All over. Can I have a bite?"
His body needed a break, possibly, especially considering he just came, but that didn't stop him from pushing himself onto the other, albeit weakly.
It sounded like a foolproof plan, even Steve couldn't argue with it, so he nodded in defeat. Tony beamed. "Great! Now before that," He lowered his hand and began to grip Steve's girth from the confines of his boxers. The blond's breath hitched and Tony took that as a good sign as ever. He continued to grip his cock, leaning his head upward to plant soft kisses and a nibble or two along his neck, bring up beads of blood for him to lick. A small snack.
...And I wouldn't want..." He swallows thickly. "—This has to be comfortable for you too. If you want me to...
Tony forgot about it. When Steve left to do whatever, Tony gave himself time to marathon a TV show for the small victory, on top of drinking some stored blood from his beloved. It's nothing like human blood and it slightly burns but it gives him a small high. It's possibly similar to human's with alcohol, not that Tony could ever get the same effects for alcohol as humans do. In actuality, it tastes rather bitter to him.
Tony saved him from the explanation and further self-torment. "Alright, I'm down. Treat me nice, soldier." He grinned.
, but since both of us aren't compatible for reproduction, nor do we share the same species, that wasn't really an option."
Tony turned in question before spotting the Starkpad laying on the flat surface and projecting the article Tony was reading.
Tony tilted his head up, smirking, "Call me doll one more time and you’ll be sleeping in the doggy bed tonight."
Steve pouted a bit.  "I like seeing your orgasm face."
Steve sheepishly rubbed at the back of his neck, which was also pink in hue. "It's um... The bed is too small to fit...
Steve finally pulled away from the kiss, trailing downwards to plant soft pecks onto Tony's cold, pale skin, only parting long enough to pull the shirt off of Tony before his lips latched back onto his skin.
it, I can."
Tony cracked a grin, "So I've been told."
Which explains why Steve is tense and Tony remembers the dilemma he was having not five minutes ago—realizes just how awful an idea this was. He shouldn't have thought of it; A vampire bonding with a werewolf is uncanny, unheard of, more so than a Vampire and a werewolf
When he awoke, he still didn't remember what perspired before, the conversation, or the planning. He only dragged himself up to the penthouse to sleep on a real bed. However, when the elevator doors opened and the scene before him stretched out before him, everything that they spoke about prior came back to him like a smack to his face. And he was wide awake.
Every so often a bulbous object threatens to breach him as well and Tony was attempting to figure out what it was in his lustful haze. He didn't finish reading the article, only because Steve had already agreed to it so Tony figured he'll learn during the process.
"Positive."
Tony looked over his shoulder in shock, just to see a shaggy, dirty blond wolf towering over him, rutting against his backside. Steve did it. He did it, which explains the sudden growth of his cock in him, large enough that Tony
He looked back at Tony, eyes widening, "You don't have to do this Tony, I don't want to push you."
Steve pulled back, though, only a short distance. Tony considered it a win, Steve was still an arms reach away from him, his hands now placed on Tony's biceps. The blond looked down at him, flurries of emotions running in his eyes that Tony couldn't read, so he didn't bother.
Steve nodded. "It's very hard not to, you're a very charming man."
Steve was still silent so Tony took it upon himself to start talking. "You see, I didn't want to tell you in case it was too early in the relationship, even though it's been three years. But we also live for a very,
You see, Vamps don't have much, we're all bitter and lonely—It's a drag, really—and we don't typically stay with other's very long because, see above, we're bitter and lonely. But Wolves are like family and they have packs and stuff so I figured we could do
But even still, Steve acts as if Tony is fragile, which couldn’t be farther from the truth. Rushing Steve at this point would lead to him becoming more and more hesitant, not that Tony can say much, his mind is fogging with the idea that
"You know me so well."
"I know you have more stamina than a normal human but less than another Werewolf, at least, for this kind of activity. I'm not sure how many times..." Steve trailed off. His eyes were shifting, and he kept wincing as if he was playing scenarios in his head that didn’t particularly favor the both of them.
"I suppose so." He reached over to the first aid kit and started to put gauze and tape over the bite wound on his own neck, smiling, "Now we're matching."
" Tony swore, dropping his head. His stomach had cum on it, a trail of it leading to where his cock sat half hard. "I didn't actually think I'd come off your fingers."
Tony reached out and kissed Steve to shut him up. "You're very cute when you're not talking, have I ever said that?" He teased before continuing, "Yes, I want to marry you. I want this forever—
In an instant, Steve's hand was on Tony's shoulder, comforting, gentle. "It could work. We could...We could try if you want, Tony. I'll be willing to try if you are. It's just that..." Steve gulped slightly before sighing. "It'll be more than the other times we had sex together. I won't be—"
Steve kissed him again just as he pulled out his fingers and left Tony feeling empty and keening for more, going to sit up to grab the blond. His attempts were met with firm hands going to push him down against the sheets again. "Stay," He commanded and Tony had no choice but to comply, with only minimal whining.
Tony responded by letting his nails drag along Steve's back in the way Tony knows Steve likes. The two are of Supernatural being, they enjoy possession and the implications that come with it.
But Steve didn't relent, didn't slow down enough for Tony to catch his breath. This is what Steve meant there wouldn't be a next time, Steve's going by complete animal instinct.
Tony ended up falling asleep on the couch, stretched out over the furniture like a starfish with no regards of decency if someone came in. He looked unattractive but he'd only make a fuss of it if he was conscious during the time.
long time so I thought it's not the right time to say something like that but I do...I really do love you." Tony was looking anywhere but at Steve. He's sure that he'd be heating up from embarrassment if he could. "I have, for a while now."
"Steve, come on."
Tony is probably breaking at least 50 Blood-Sucker Laws, but when has he ever followed the rules? It's in his DNA to break things as mundane as laws and regulations and whatnot, Tony doesn't abide by them.
"Steve, I'm going to blow my load if you don't do
Steve returned it, if only a little hesitantly. Though his body was working on instinct now, his hands gliding along Tony's clothed waist, trailing upwards before dropping again and snaking under his shirt. Tony hummed his approval into his Boyfriend's mouth and Steve swallowed it up. His thumb rubbed at Tony's nipples, just as the Stark began to roll his hips into Steve's. The blond grunts and the two continue their game of teasing.
Tony stepped closer to and placed a hand on Steve's cheek, placing a kiss on his lips. Tony felt the tension leave his lover. "It's okay, Steve, I understand." With Steve relaxing under his hand, Tony took the time to actually look at Steve's set-up.
"For fuck's sake, Steve,
Tony was uncharacteristically quiet, mostly because his mind was still reeling over that fact. He was considered an alpha, despite not even being a wolf. That said a lot, Tony does like being considered second in command after Steve but he thought it was because of his relationship with the Captain, not that he had any form of leadership in him.
Steve winced when the fangs pierced the skin but didn't show any signs of struggle afterward, even holding Tony in his arms. "I suppose so. I don't feel any difference, I'm still in love with you. But other wolves would notice. We won't know for sure till we come across one."
." He was breathless, weak and wanting.
The danger is what gives Tony the rush, and he thinks it's the same for Steve. The feeling of putting your trust in your natural born enemy, wondering if instinct will kick in and lunge for the attack when they're at their weakest state? It hasn't happened before but those were the times where Steve wasn't completely wolfed out. He had some control, at the very least. Now, though, Steve has to be large and furry. There's no telling what will happen during their bonding session. Tony will just have to put full faith into the other, not that he hasn't done so before.
Until he placed his clawed hands under Tony's belly and began adjusting the two of them. The two now laid down onto their sides, Steve still locked inside of Tony. The pillows were starting to make sense now, Tony thought as he rested his head on one. And the water too, which he grabbed a bottle and drank some, lifting his head for a brief moment to do so. "You really did think all of this through, Cap." He said to the beast, he reached back to awkwardly pat Steve’s fur ridden hip.
This angle felt much better, made him feel more submissive than usual, which turned him on even more. He stopped thinking again, as to why this new change in position got Steve’s interest, his mind was focusing on
Steve stood from his spot on a single chair, his body bare save for the boxers that hugged his body in all the right places. He was nervous, his face and shoulders slightly pink from embarrassment. He wasn't hard, quite the opposite really. He looked sick and Tony felt a bit of pity.
thing. Which is...This," He turned back to gesture to the tablet, all the while he spoke, Steve hasn't taken his eyes off of Tony.
"I love you too," And those are the words that made Tony turn back to Steve. "You do?"
The two stumbled onto the sheets, Steve lowering them to the floor with ease, their teeth only gnashing together every so often. Tony snaked his arms around Steve's neck, keeping him close together as the two started a rhythm, grinding their hips together in an attempt to get off. It was enough for Tony, to get off like this, his body desperately wanted it but his mind knew there was better. So he forced his hips to stop, biting his lip while his fangs poked into his skin a bit. Steve lifted his thumb to rub against the bead of blood that appeared, wiping it away
and silently pleading to be used over and over again. He wanted Steve to break him, knowing that Steve loved him and would be there to put him back together again when everything was all said and done.
Steve wanted to protest further but didn't know what else to say. With a defeated sigh, he nodded. "Well then...I'll...I'll set up in the Penthouse. You stay here." And with that, the Captain turned and left.
Tony awoke to the smell of raw meat and cooked meat. Both smelled good but after such a draining activity, he’d prefer something else.
Steve grabbed his wrist and pulled it away. "Hold on," He said through gritted teeth. Tony would have loved to push for it but he settled with a knowing and triumphant grin instead. Steve pulled his own boxers off with a bit of maneuvering and tossed it to the side, grabbing a bottle of lube.  He popped it open and squeezed some onto his fingers, rubbing them together to warm it up slightly. His non-lubricated hand went to lift Tony's legs up and position him for entry.
Which is why Tony knows how taboo this idea is and how outlandish it is to be even thinking about it. But he'd been reading about it for a while and he would love to just try it, even if it didn't work the way they want it to.
And learn he did.
Steve smiled, full of love and adoration. He looked more relax, and a tad bit decisive. He leaned down to kiss Tony, and it felt much lighter now that they've confessed. Tony felt like he didn't have to hide much anymore, everything is out in the open now. Like a weight being lifted from their shoulders, especially since they now the feeling is mutual.
Then suddenly, Steve was biting the juncture between his neck and shoulder, deep enough for blood but not too much that he's causing too much damage. He’ll admit, he tensed a little, fearing that his lover might kill him (and wouldn’t this be some killer sex if that were the case) but he soon relaxed. The bite will heal and Tony can imagine this is what was necessary.
When he rested his head again, Steve began to lap at the wound on Tony's neck/shoulder. It's supposed to heal Tony, if he were human or another werewolf, but as a vampire, it just means it'll take longer to close up. Which Tony isn't sure Steve is doing on purpose or because instinct tells him to do so, he'll have to ask later.
Steve stood up from his spot. "Well, now that that's out of the way, I can talk."
Steve chuckled and pulled back from Tony, only to lean across the countertop behind him. "You don't have to be, everyone can have characteristics of one, even if it only shines in certain situations. For example, Bruce reeks of Alpha when he's hulked out, but otherwise, he's submissive. Like a beta or Omega."
Now that Tony thinks about it, he has been cleaned up. The pain he felt must be less than what it would have been before if Steve hadn't cleaned him off as soon as he could. Tony was definitely in love with this man. "You are too much, you know that?"
Tony tilted his head in confusion as Steve sighed, going to continue. "You see when you asked to bond it wasn't just...It was more than a relationship. You basically asked for Our forever. Traditionally,
“Nope,” Tony responded with a soft laugh and turned in Steve's arms, planting a kiss on the Captain's lips. Steve returned it in earnest his hands finding home onto Tony's waist. When he pulled back, he was still smiling at Tony, a thick brow raised. "Then are you going to tell me what's on your mind?"
—it gave him goosebumps, he felt warmer, though he knows he physically couldn’t, it was a mental feeling. Steve had a way of doing that to him.
"All yours," Tony echoed, followed by a gasp. "More—!" Tony begged, his nails starting to drag along Steve's shoulder blades in an attempt to keep himself latched onto Steve. The blond hissed but didn't stop his relentless fucking, spreading Tony wide from the size of his cock and finding his prostate over and over again without fail.
"No, Steve, It's fine. It's perfect actually." And it was true. The entire set-up provided comfort and protection, Steve made it with Tony completely in mind. Steve could have easily just set down one blanket and no pillows. Tony would be none the wiser. But instead the blond had outdone himself, if Tony weren’t already in love with him, he would be now.
"Strange how I'm naked before you."
Tony felt lighter, knowing that it didn't go as horribly as he thought it would.
"You're so beautiful, Tony. Lovely," Steve praised once more, planting kisses on his neck again. "Amazing.. and mine. All mine." This was a better attempt at dirty talk though it might not have the same desired effect as anyone else.
However, Tony found interest in Steve and Steve loved doing what people told him not to do. What was better is that Steve was still technically alive, meaning Tony could feed on him and never have to worry about taking too much
Steve being inside him always feels as good as the first time. Steve wasn't small, actually, he'd be a bit too much for a regular human. Luckily, Tony isn't human, and his body is able to stretch to accommodate Steve's large girth without the fear that Steve could rupture something.
"I don't want to...I don't want to come off of this."
"Okay," His voice was small, something Tony would prefer his partner didn't sound like. He leaned in to kiss him again, deep and passionate.
It was making Tony increasingly nervous, but he trudged on.  "I want to bond with you, Steve. If you'll let me." It was straight-forward, a good enough proposition. A yes or no decision made by Steve, who looked guilty. Tony was waiting for the rejection, so he quickly added: "It was stupid of me to think that, sorry." Another feeble attempt to fix what can't be fixed.
Tony let out an awkward laugh in a weak attempt to lighten the air. "Surprise?" It's possibly the worst thing he could say in this situation but with every passing second, every silent moment from Steve, his chest constricted more and more. It was hard to find anything right to say.
After he naps...
With that outburst, the blond began to move, his hips rolling into Tony's before pulling back and thrusting earnestly into the other. Tony moaned and wailed, letting out swears and curses.
"Well, who says you can't? After all, I'm gonna have to come more than once, right?"
Tony stared, shocked, his eyes glancing from the box to Steve. "That's...That's why you were so hesitant."
"No," Steve's sounded strong in the sense that he knew he meant his words, but his voice contained strain, as if he was trying to keep himself together "No," He repeated weakly, "Don't be sorry...It's just..." Finally, Tony could notice a distinct emotion on Steve's face, one that showed more than the others. It was worry. Steve was chewing on his bottom lip and his brows were drawn together, he was worried about something.
Tony gave the area a quick once over again. "I mean it's not a pillow fort but it'll do."
Tony looked up at him with bleary eyes before the question settled into his lust hazed mind. Then he was perking up. "Oh um.." Shit, he didn't want his confession to be now. "Yes?"
Just then, the man of the hour steps through the elevator door. Steve Rogers stood onto the platform above the living room and spotted Tony at his place by the bar. "I thought I sensed you overthinking." Came the wolf's chuckle as he joined Tony and wrapped an arm around his waist from behind. Instantly, Tony's worries subsided, replaced with adoration and calm. He hummed, tilting his head slightly so Steve can leave a kiss to his neck.
But this, undoubtedly, would get him shunned in the Vampire community—if he hasn't been already.
How could he have forgotten? But it was also hours, did Steve call him up but Tony was too deep in sleep to answer?
"Are you sure?"
However, it did the opposite sex-crazed Tony’s wishes. Steve stopped, fully sheathed into him. Tony whined, his legs shaking from exertion and he dropped his head. "Nooo," He said in defeat his chest heaving.
“They can, you’re proof,
Tony let out a choked sob of pleasure, pressing his face down and taking it, taking Steve's cock as it stretched and poked his insides. Steve was a lot larger than before, and not just in girth. He was much taller than Tony, by a foot or two now. It was to the point that he completely engulfed Tony's body with ease. Steve's clawed and furry hands were outstretched in front of Tony and Tony instinctively reached out to curl his hand along the top of Steve's.
Because Steve was growing. He was growing inside of Tony, as if Tony thought that was possible. Steve was poking deeper into Tony and stretching him wider and wider, his legs spreading to accommodate. "Steve,
With enough effort from the two of them, Steve was able to push in his large knot, locking in on the third attempt. He howled in pleasure, shooting strings of cum inside Tony, just as Tony began to grind back against him. He was so full, locked against Steve, cum unable to escape due to the knot keeping it in. Tony moaned weakly as he came one last time. There wasn't a lot to shoot out, just a few spurts. Definitely nothing to rival Steve’s release
"That or the fact I couldn't hear you swearing from the top floor so I feared the worst. Are you hungry?"
Tony doesn't want to give it up. But he also wants a step forward in this relationship.
. Tony whined again, pushing back against the werewolf in order to encourage himself to take it—
Fury held his gaze for several moments. “Yeah, Stark. I got your back. You’ll have my aid, or sword, or whatever the quote is.” He shifted, looked back at the cat. “Goose’s too, if she likes you.”
“You alright, Tony?” Bruce asked. Tony flinched — when had Bruce gotten so close to him?
“We won’t,” Steve vowed. “We’ll figure it out, Tony.”
“What I didn’t mention before…is that I was winning,” Steve said, the words rushing out. “I was winning our fight, had the upper hand. Had my arms around him in a chokehold, could tell he was on the verge of passing out.”
idea what you’ve just unleashed?” She was actually shaking with her rage now, and Tony gulped, trying to keep up the nonchalant act he had going on.
him, and what a fucking whopper, he was never forgetting, never in a million years) Tony blinked and wished Steve’s arms were on him again. “What?”
Steve accepted them with a nod. “Thank you, Tony.”
“I honestly don’t have that much to tell yet,” Steve admitted, sitting on Tony’s workshop couch. He should have looked huge on the old, worn-out thing, but instead he looked right at home there, settling in easily. Huh. Ignoring the urge to go sit with him, Tony took a sip of scotch and tapped his fingers on the glass.
Steve’s frown reappeared. “AIM and Killian weren’t your fault. And if Pepper couldn’t handle you being Iron Man, that’s on her, Tony. Not you.”
What felt like a battering ram slammed into him, flinging him halfway across the room before he could finish. Hissing, Tony managed to keep himself from being thrown into the wall just in time, firing the repulsers so he hovered in the air instead. His side sung with pain — whatever the hell had hit him had connected so hard the armor had dented a little.
Tony had the suit on and was out in the air in seconds.
“What an adorable team leader you are. Checking up on everyone,” Tony snarked, not bothering to stop leaning on Thor.
“Keep insulting my movies, and see what happens.”
“Everything we deal with is tricky. What’s on your mind?”
Only Hansen didn’t move.
Taking off her gloves, Natasha said, “Alright, but only because you got all banged up and look pathetic. And I want you to take the concussion seriously. We’re telling Bruce as soon as he’s done with Steve.”
Only to be stopped by Steve.
I love hurt/comfort, especially one character is injured and the other has to take care of them in impossible surroundings. Sabre's  take on the "convenient cabin while injured" is one of my favorite examples of this, and I think this chapter and the next borrows a bit from that and remixes it for this story --- so I want to humbly thank sabre for that story and all the other wonderful ones posted!
“Yeah, I miss you too. But the way it used to be. Now you’re off with the super friends, and I don’t know what’s going on with you. The world’s getting weird.”
“He was after your suits,” she said slowly.
“No, he wants to talk about his company, Advanced Idea Mechanics. They’ve had some breakthroughs they think SI can assist with.”
Side-eyeing the bag of coffee on his counter, which was definitely
“It’s different. I heal quickly.”
“You’re a great friend, Tony,” Steve interrupted again. “I’d be lost without you. The Avengers are lucky to have you, and I’m extremely grateful to call you a friend. You’re a good man.”
They did manage to get a good distance between them and the Mark IV before it blew. A little more sad about it than he would have liked, Tony pushed it to the back of his mind and wrapped Steve’s arm tighter around his shoulders, doing his best to keep his footing on the rocky path through the woods, pain singing up his leg with each step. They’d been walking for a while, and though Tony and Steve both had their eyes open and aware, they’d yet to see a single helpful house or cabin in all the damned trees in the dark. And spider webs. If Tony walked through one more  cobweb, he was going to absolutely lose it. Lamenting their luck, Tony gritted his teeth and kept forcing one foot in front of the other, determined to keep going.
“I…” Utterly baffled, Tony looked down and blanched at his own torso. “Oh.”
“I really do want to get that shawarma,” he told Thor, leaning on him heavily while they waited for the elevator. It probably wasn’t very dignified to completely and totally rely on the buff god so much, but exhausted didn’t even being to explain how Tony felt.
“Darcy assures me it is a most honored Midgardian tradition,” Thor replied, eyes sparkling. “You must participate, Stark. I’d hate to hear the horrors of what occurs if you beget tradition and ignore the power of the mistle. ’Tis bad luck.”
Sighing, Tony continued, “Until he had to go and make an asinine decision. Honestly, who does he think he is?”
Thor went still as well, as if he weren’t sure if he would like where the conversation would go or not, either. Not that Tony could blame him. Loki was his brother, after all. That had to be a bitch to navigate.
“Yes, thank you, I can see that. So, what, you decided to give me a heart attack?” Tony asked, rubbing his chest below the reactor.
“Back atcha, J. Miss me?”
, he had to get to Pepper, oh Jesus, oh fuck.
“That has nothing to do with anything.” It had
Thor tilted his head. “Who?”
“Tony….”
“Just…just some bruises and a slight burn,” he managed, after clearing his throat. “I’m fine.”
“Don’t tell Steve,” he blurted, sitting up from the cot he’d been lying on.
So Tony took a deep breath, and offered a slice of himself back.
“No? Felt that way to me. Everyone had their fun, but I’m the loser who is going to be replaying what could have been until the end of time,” Tony said bitterly, moving to look out the window.
“But what if that’s part of it? What if he told me that, knowing I’d assume it was a lie, and that’s part of the trick?”
“Uh…”
“Yeah.” Drawing in a jagged breath, Steve ran a hand through his hair. “I kept thinking, what if the worst happens, and I could have helped? I couldn’t get the thought out of my head. So I made Clint abandon the mission. We came home.”
“Iron Patriot,” Tony snorted. He was going to give Rhodey all sorts of hell for that. “Fucked up a perfectly good suit is what they did. But yeah, I’ll reach out to him.”
“You and Pepper. Uh.”
“It’s proof Hydra’s still active,” Tony finished. “You think the scepter’s there?”
Steve nodded. “See you soon.”
“Right,” Tony said, having no clue how to respond to that. “Well. Crisis over. You can go back to being a sneaky spider now.”
“Well, if we must, we must. Pucker up, there, Cap,” Tony joked, thinking he did a pretty good job of keeping the wistfulness out of his voice. But maybe he didn’t do so great job because Steve’s easy demeanor faded, and he was back to looking determined again.
The captain at him stared with his eyebrows furrowed slightly, a pinched look on his face, like he was trying to puzzle something out.  Like he was trying to decide if Tony could really be trusted or not. Which, awkward. And ouch. Fuck, other than that
“There you are.” Strolling in with her hair perfectly styled and in his favorite suit, Pepper bee-lined straight for him.”I thought you were never going to come out of the workshop, Tony. We’ve got a lot to do, I need you to shower and come with me to figure out more repairs and…”
“Guess we’ll be adding more escape tactics to training.“ Smirking, Nat lifted her hand to her communicator. “I’ve got Tony.”
“Just stopping to say hello, Senator. My, my, you’ve gotten tetchy in your old age.”
“No.”
Another twitch, a small flicker of movement on Steve’s face. Tony pressed closer, barely able to breathe, not daring to hope. “Steve?”
He’d fallen head over fucking heels for Captain America.
“He…oh my God. Tony.”
Rolling out of bed, he stretched, and threw on a sweatshirt, preparing to go down to the workshop. Sleep wouldn’t be possible again, prior experience told him that. He could go find Rhodey, or Nat or Clint, but didn’t want to bother them. They’d wake, he knew. They’d make hot cocoa and watch movies with him, but he didn’t feel like being soothed or comforted.
“Thanks, Tony,” Steve said eventually, way after it was socially appropriate for him to respond. Maybe they had a lot of awkward silences in the 40s. Tony could have chalked it up to that, but…he also didn’t look like he really believed Tony’s statement. So. There was that. And that was fine. Just…fine.
“Right,” he managed after enough time had passed to get sufficiently awkward again. “Well. In that case, I’m glad you're here, then. I’ve got something to talk to you about. Seeing as we’re friends and all.”
“Take them down quickly and carefully,” Steve said. “We don’t want anyone accidentally triggering the bomb. Be on alert. Let’s get this done as efficiently as possible. Ready? Let’s go.”
the other night.”
“Hey, you clean up pretty nice, Nat,” he said, strolling in. Stopping next to her, he flashed her a grin and asked, “Ready to go?”
“Yeah, I play all the essentials. AC/DC, Triumph, Black Sabbath, Metallic….what is your face doing? Are you laughing?”
“No, no. Thanks, buddy, but I’m fine,” Tony said, mustering up a smile. “Come on, let’s go, Nat’s right. We need to talk.”
About to head down and do just that, Tony paused when he realized JARVIS had been suspiciously silent on his decision to go to the workshop at a time any regular person would still be sound asleep.
“The guy tried to take my suits, Pep, he has it coming. He has
“Sounds great. Anything else I should add?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Where are you going with this, Tony?”
“J, we know why they’re pissed at me, why are they after Thor so badly?” Tony asked, getting back up and fighting harder than ever. Tired of stunning everyone, he just started grabbing minions and throwing them into each other so they would stay down.
“What?” Steve’s eyes snapped to his, still bright, but…but filled with something else. Tony felt the enormity of his words settle on his shoulders as he realized it was hope. Steve was looking at him with such hope, like Tony was throwing him a lifeline he hadn’t realized he needed.
“You most certainly did, Sir.” JARVIS piped up, selling him out completely.
Steve shrugged. “I woke up.”
He paused, about to type more, when someone called his name.
Steve, on the other hand, apparently did. Pressing a soft kiss to the side of Tony’s mouth, (why was that so sexy, oh, God, Tony was fucked) Steve let go and cleared his throat, then stepped back, eyes down. “Have a good time at the party, Tony. You should probably get going.”
“Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now come on. Spill.”
The darkness threatened to leap back up and devour him, so Tony took a purposeful breath and pushed it away. He was not going to let that overwhelm him. He was not. So he looked at Cap, and said, “And what happened with Loki wasn’t your fault.”
Tony grinned. “Deal.”
Managing to get to this feet, Steve sent Tony a pained look and kept his left arm around his waist. “It’s not great, but I’ll be okay. We really should get going, though. The sooner we find somewhere safe, the sooner you can look me over.”
“Like hell,” Tony said, and solved the problem by going to the other side of the bed. Steve’s eyes tracked his movements, and a slow, beautiful smile spread over his face as Tony stood next to him again. Tony’s heart damn near grew three sizes at the sight of that smile, and his own returning grin somehow grew even more.
you. You know that’s not true,” she said vehemently, grabbing his hands.
“Uh,” Tony said, while Cap hovered over him. Jesus, Steve completely dwarfed him, with his long legs and those broad shoulders. Mouth going dry, he stared up at Steve, acutely aware of being zip tied to a bed and offered up like some prize in front of him. Certain parts of his body perked to attention at that, at being so completely and totally surrounded by Steve, and Tony firmly told his dick to settle down. Now was really not the time.
Laughing, Steve held it just out of reach. “And you can get lunch just as soon as you agree to actually take a break. You need to pause every once in a while, Tony, or you’ll be no good to anyone.”
Deciding to let that go for now, he snarled at her instead. “What the fuck did you bring me here for, Hansen? What did Killian get you into?”
He hit the trees, and hoped Steve’s head was decently covered by the armor. Then he hit the ground, and his head slammed into the back of the helmet. Pain flared brilliantly, taking over every part of his body so that he couldn’t breathe.
“We might need to get that stopped,” Steve said weakly, and Tony snorted because his other option was to cry and that wouldn’t be very fucking helpful right now.
“J, what the hell?” he asked, turning and aiming for the stairwell.
Jesus, the ground was coming up rather fast. “Come on, one last monkey, you’ve got this Kit, grab him.”
For a moment, Tony almost refused to end the call. He didn’t want to let go, didn’t want for Cap to disconnect yet. He wanted to hear more of Steve’s voice, and make Steve smile, and watch the way Steve would laugh at the outrageous things he said, and just…be with Steve.
“Thanks, big guy. I can take it from here,” Tony managed, the back of his neck burning. Dammit, the guy had picked him up like he’d been some pretty princess in distress. Not the best way to impress the much larger teammates.
“We tracked the scepter to Prague. There’s an operation of some sort going on. It’s not Shield,” Steve said, his voice hard. “Clint and I are putting eyes on it, to watch them, and are getting ready to come home, so we can all discuss it. If we’re wrong, and we attack, we could cause an international incident. But if we’re right…”
Still not looking at any of them, Clint said, “We all had to work through some shit. The rest of us still showed up at the meetings, didn’t we?”
“What?” Steve asked, as Natasha leapt up and got in Clint’s face.
“Well if it isn’t the long lost hero,” Tony said, grinning at his phone like an idiot, because though he looked exhausted and slightly banged up, Steve seemed perfectly fine and okay.
Sometimes I totally steal my favorite lines from the MCU and work them in ;)
He was nearly to the end of the hall when Fury stuck his head out of his office. “And Stark? Quit trying to bug my Triskelion.”
A little bit of two idiots in love before things start to ramp up....
Okay, that was….dropping his arms, Tony tried to keep hold of his righteous anger as exhaustion washed over him, but it was damned difficult. “What do you want, Maya?”
,” Natasha snapped, standing. “I need to think. I need to look into this on my own.” She stared at them all, face still blank. “Thank you for telling us, Steve. But I need to process this on my own.”
Tearing his gaze away from Steve’s still form on the bed, Tony blinked. “What?”
“Um.” Watching as Steve fought to control his panting, the way his hands shook on Tony’s counter, Tony took a small step forward and quietly asked, “Can’t do what again, Steve?”
He flinched at that, but she kept going. “The one who offered all of us a place to stay, even those who betrayed him in the past.” And then, finally, she dropped her gaze, as if shamed, and Tony had to pinch himself to make sure this was all actually happening. “The one who somehow is turning us into a team, just by suggesting that team dinner after battle, and keeping us all together in his Tower. Even though he’s spent most of his time in his workshop, dealing with a trauma he doesn’t know how to talk to his teammates about. Even though…even though he could. If he wanted. We would listen.”
A flinch went through him at that — he couldn’t help it. She wasn’t the only one who’d thought he wouldn’t make it out of that portal. “Not dead. Just tired.”
“That’s true,” Tony sniffed, and finished off the last of the burrito. “This was great, thanks. Didn’t realize I needed a break until you showed up.”
And then she was gone before he could think on it further.
His lips quirked. “Mistletoe, Thor?”
Twisting so he was face to face with the armor, Steve wrapped his arm’s around Tony’s neck. “Don’t need a parachute!” he yelled as Tony evaded more debris.
And he took off, tearing after the plane.
Steve’s eyes narrowed. “You want me to walk away?”
“He’s healing,” Bruce murmured. “It’s just taking a toll on him, I think that’s why he hasn’t woken yet.”
“You’re hurt.” Reaching out gently, Steve nudged Tony’s face to the side so he could get a better look at the bruise Killian’s goon had given him. Then his other hand went to Tony’s bandaged wrist, fingers scraping lightly on Tony’s forearm. Tony shuddered, the full-body shiver lighting him up from head to toes at Steve’s soft touch on his skin. Fuck, how was he supposed to
to stop Hydra. Peggy, the Commandos, my life….”
Hydra? His dad had hated them, and Tony understood why. The things they had done, what they were willing to do…Tony shivered, getting in the elevator with Steve. Hydra.
“Tony.”
Face warming again, Tony huffed out a breath. “I get thrown around a lot in the suit. It’s not a big deal, I’ve got plans to make that better. And the bruises will fade, so really, it’s fine.”
Bulldozer wasn’t too bad with the alien weapon, but Tony’s armor was better. He’d made damn sure those weapons couldn’t hurt his armor after the Battle for New York. They went back and forth for a bit, but Tony got the impression that Bulldozer didn’t have much experience fighting with a man in a kick ass suit of armor. So before Bulldozer had much chance to do harm, Tony had him disarmed and sprawled on the floor in minutes.
And he had shit to do.
Clint shoved a hand through his hair, making it stuck up in the back. “We’re supposed to just believe this? That Hydra is around because Sitwell was a dick in a hallway?”
“You’re not the Mandarin,” Tony muttered. Then his eyes narrowed. “Are you?”
“I love you too, Tony. Go to sleep,” she whispered, carding her hands through his hair.
“Do not worry yourself so, Captain. We’ll get the Tesseract, the scepter, and my brother back,” Thor said, hoisting Tony up a little further in his arms. Jesus, that should really be humiliating, but Tony was so tired he could cry, and also, the hint of Pop Tarts was somehow helping keep him upright. Like a secondary sugar high or something.
That fucking ended now.
“I know you’re an Avenger. I
“For now,” Clint responded, looking at the image with a much sadder expression that Natasha had. “Yeah. For now, we leave him be.”
Huh. He still had no clue who the guy was.
“I don’t think so, Stark,” the guy said. “You’re going to pay for keeping all the good stuff to yourself. And after you, I’m going for Thor.”
“Goddammit, Maya.” Unable to look at her, he thought of Pepper struggling and scared, in danger because of him. Tony shook his head, his hatred growing until there was nothing but revenge burning through him. “Let me go.”
“I will politely ask Agent Romanoff to hurry, sir.”
“Okay, I’m pissed but the middle of the building is secure. What’s up with you two?” Tony asked, pulling up a scan of the building again. JARVIS detected no moving heat signatures on the top floor, which meant Thor also had success. But there was more, way more than there should have been, swarming in the lower levels.
” Steve said again with a small huff of impatience as Tony shrugged and averted his eyes. “I’m trying to give you a compliment.”
“We just leave him alone?” Steve asked, brow furrowed.
“He’s thirteen,” she said, and for a moment he swore the arc reactor glitched again, before she did another eye roll. “And no, I need your help. I need you to come with me, now.”
“You’ve already got Star Wars and Trek, right? Anybody tell you about Classic Rock? You should definitely add that.”
“Great job, guys!” Tony shouted. “J has alerted the emergency services, they’ll be here soon, I gotta go get Steve!”
“Be back in an hour, Barton, or I’m changing the locks!” Tony yelled while they got on the elevator.
It was Thor, of all people, that took care of him after the Battle of New York.
hero  — someone who wouldn’t back down from a hard fight, who would do his best to keep those he loved protected, to do what was right, no matter what. That was what radiated from him now. That ferocious passion, and resolution to do what was right.
Nodding, Steve reached out and started yanking at the manual release options, grunting as he did so. Ears ringing like he’d been in front of the speakers at a rock concert all night, Tony watched him, brain fuzzy and slow. Something was off in the way Steve tugged at the suit, but he couldn’t place his finger on it.
“You told me yesterday you wanted to talk about something. But you had no trouble telling the whole team about Bucky, so I’m guessing it isn’t that. What aren’t you telling them that you thought you could trust me with?” Tony asked, putting the bread down to stare at Steve. For some reason, his hand was slightly sweaty. Like he was nervous about what Steve was going to say, or something.
, Pep. I have to do everything I can to make sure the earth, to make sure you are protected. That means sticking with the Avengers.”
The thought of Hydra anywhere near Steve made his shoulder blades itchy too. So, he was clearly the best person to snoop around Shield for the time being. Besides. Fury had asked about suggestions for the hellicarriers. So what better way to hand them over (modified, of course, since he didn't know what side Fury was on) and get a chance to stick his nose in things he shouldn’t than by swinging by after a meeting he had with a shareholder?
“He really needs to stop——“ Bruce took a deep breath. “What am I saying? It’s Tony, so of course he’s blaming himself for everything. I just really wish he wouldn’t.”
He shot through a window, shattering glass everywhere and not giving a damn. The floor he’d selected was large and mostly empty — but there! One lone man in the corner, with a Chitauri gun and a weird armored helmet.
“That’s enough.” Thor’s words snapped through the room, stilling him. Stung, Tony watched him rise off the couch and walk over to Steve. “You fought admirably Captain, but Stark is right. You should allow Banner to check over you without argument.” When Steve nodded, looking down, Thor turned to Tony. “And you. Brothers of battle will get injured from time to time. It’s bound to happen to all of us, sooner or later.”
Clearing his throat, Thor stepped toward Bruce, keeping his expression open and easy. “Does anyone else feel the need for drink? I myself am fond of Midgardian ale, and though it is early, I would feel more at ease absorbing this news with a good cup of mead. Would you like some, Captain? How about you, Stark? Aye, of course you’d like some.”
“I think they’re still around.”
Intrigued, Tony tore his eyes away from the fight in front of him. “Sure, put it up.”
Tony craned his neck to look around her. “Did you bring Thor? Please tell me you brought Thor, it’s one of my lifelong fantasies to be rescued by a hot blond while tied up…” Tony trailed off as not Thor, but Steve bulleted into the room. “Cap? What are you doing here?”
“They would be wrong,” Steve said, and Tony stopped mid-sentence to blink.
“Knew you’d catch me,” Steve murmured. That made Tony’s heart flip, (he’d asked Steve to trust him, but he hadn’t expected Steve to trust him so much, how the hell was he supposed to handle that?) when Steve said, “And I like flying with you. S’fun.”
“Oh,” Tony said, blinking and abruptly realizing why. The ice. Steve had been found in cold and ice. God, Tony was an idiot. “Oh, God, of course you don’t. The crash. I’m so sorry, Steve, I…”
They cut the shit for a while, Tony exasperated to discover Happy still couldn’t use the video call function correctly, Happy annoyed Tony was  giving him crap for it. He filled Tony in on how the meeting was going — Aldrich was showing Pepper his big brain, and because Happy couldn’t
“Hold on, Cap!” No lake around this time, Tony thought sadly, and wrapped his arms back around Steve. Only a shit ton of trees. Flipping them again so that his back would be what would hit, Tony tried not to brace too much for impact. That always made it worse.
“Being Nat. Trying to figure out what happened, and the hell with anyone who dares to get in her way.”
“And then during the battle I had to sit there and watch my nightmare come to life,” she whispered, dropping her hands, bright blue eyes locking with his, “only I wasn’t
“That’s not on you,” Tony said forcefully, getting to his feet. “Steve. He tricked you, played on your emotions. That’s not on you. You’ve got nothing to be sorry for.”
. I could do
(See the end of the chapter for
“JARVIS?” Tony asked, and then sighed deeply when he didn’t get a response. “Yeah.”
be? Steve, with his adorable blushes and smarts quips. Steve, with his absolute sense of loyalty and drive to stand up to bullies. Who spent weeks helping to clean up the mess after the Battle for New York, even with the possibility of Bucky being alive and Hydra being active churning in his mind. Looking so sad at times it broke Tony’s heart.
The door slammed open and Tony’s gauntleted arm was up, repulsor whining, ready to fire. Natasha rushed through, took one look at Tony, and froze.
Bruce frowned, eyebrows coming down like angry caterpillars. “You’re one of the smartest men on the planet, I’m pretty sure you could out-science me any day. Though that’s beside the point. You can talk to us. We might not have similar backgrounds, but we’re a team, Tony. We’re here for you.”
“Off.” Thor said firmly, and that was that. Telling himself that it was fine, that Thor and Steve were not Obie and he had nothing to worry about, he pulled his shirt over his head. Cool air hit his skin and made him shiver a little, goosebumps erupting down his arm, which spurned him into action. He wanted to be warm, and have a full stomach, and be horizontal for a while, dammit. Reaching over for the cords that would help scan the reactor, Tony got to work, not looking at his teammates until Steve cleared his throat.
“Sometimes. And sometimes she knows exactly who she is, and
anything…”
“S-sure,” he said, her words hitting directly into his heart.
A soft noise slipped from Tony as their mouths connected. Steve’s lips were soft, and though it wasn’t really a kiss yet, just a light sliding of lips, it was still
“Ah. Am I interrupting?” a new voice asked from the hallway. Twisting, Tony turned to see Bruce staring at them amusedly, wringing his hands slightly.
“I”m sorry, Tony. But I need you to fix Extremis.” Standing, Maya walked to the door. Then she hesitated. “I’ll do my best to help you fix it so that Pepper isn’t harmed.”
“Does a bear shit in the woods? Don’t give me that look, it was a joke. Alright, I’m sorry, that question was tactless, you don’t even have to say anything. Come on, come on, Steve, time’s a-wasting, and I’ve got a lot to tell you before the sun comes up.”
“Ah. Wow. That’s incredible. Thank you. Uh. I am Captain Steve Rogers. It’s…nice to meet you?” Steve said, still staring up. Something shifted on his face — despite his fatigue, his eyes seemed to light up, like Thor’s had. Something that could almost be called awe took over the scowl. Tony tilted his head, trying to process it. Did Mr.
Steve’s face was flaming now. Tony was pretty sure his was bright red as well, but he didn’t look away, because he didn’t want Steve to think he wasn’t telling the truth.
He wondered if that was Fury’s fault, or Alexander Pierce’s.
Refraining from commenting on how much bullshit
“Good night, Tony,” Steve said.
,) the room instantly blurred, his eyelids getting heavy in seconds. Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch, he’d let his guard down. And didn’t he know better, hadn’t he learned
“Sir. Sir, you are in the Tower, and quite safe.”
“Anyway. All’s well that end’s well,” he wrapped up. “And it’s pretty late. Sorry, but I’ve got to end story-time and hit the hay.”
Not again.
The disdain disappeared from Clint’s face, only to be replaced with wonder. “Well, holy shit. You’ve got no clue.”
“Fuck,” Tony swore. “Son of a godamned bitch.”
“You were kidnapped and injured by an enhanced solider! Not lying low on an undercover mission!”
By the time he’d managed that, it was late, and Tony wanted nothing more than to drop his head to the table and sleep. Intending to follow the Clarksons out and find Nat, Pepper, and Rhodey, Tony rose, but paused when he heard someone else at the other end of the large library by the fireplace. He hadn’t paid them any mind when he and the Clarksons first sat down, intent on fixing the merger problem, but now he couldn’t help but flick his gaze their direction and stop in his tracks.
That was the thing, Tony thought while they tussled. Without the suit he was vulnerable. He knew that. And so had his team. Natasha and Steve had been strict about Tony learning more defense moves, and he had to admit, as he wrangled away another gun and cracked it over his second assailant’s head, it had been a good call. He might never have the strength of Steve, Hulk or Thor, or be as deadly as Natasha or Clint, but goddammit, he was scrappy.
Not looking away from the window, Steve said, “Maybe that’s a sign you should try to get some sleep, Tony.”
“Oh. Uh, thanks,” he mumbled, scooting back a bit. She only watched him with calm eyes, and Tony resisted the impulse to lay his head back on her shoulder and doze more. A vague memory of her petting his hair ran through his mind, and to be honest, it seemed preferable to whatever the hell else he was supposed to be doing today.
“It was a long time ago, Steve. And don’t worry. I made damn sure it was something no one could ever pull off again. It’s not a vulnerability, it won’t make me liability to the team.”
“Pilot. Wasn’t pilot,” Tony said.
“Tony! Leave the guy alone he just woke up,” Barton said, and hip-bumped Tony so he could scoot closer to Steve and grin down at him. “Hiya, Cap. Ignore our genius, billionaire, playboy philanthropist, he doesn’t take it well when you get hurt.”
“I know that. But you are my friend.” Steve’s voice was confident, left no room for doubt. He really meant it, which…Tony was not sure how he felt about. Were they friends? He supposed they were.
“What?” he said.
He supposed.
“I’m a little busy at the moment.”
Walking over to the spot Tony pointed at, Steve paused, placed a hand on Tony’s shoulder. “Thank you, Tony.”
full of agony and suffering, and God, God, he had been the cause of it,
“Don’t ever make me do that again,” he said, but didn’t have any heat behind it.
“I was wrong,” she said, moving to get her sandwich again. “What I put in the dossier was wrong. I hope one day you’ll forgive me for it.”
“Clearly not, if you come running all the way back from Prague after I drop off the radar for a few hours! You and Barton dropped out of contact for a while, but you didn’t see me rushing off, did you? I trusted you to handle it!”
“The gala,” Steve reminded him with an easy smile.
He looked so defeated while he said it. Too similar to the lost and angry man he’d been when they first met.
, arms spread wide and a wild grin on his face.
“We’re not under forty, it’s fine,” he huffed. A group with guns circled him, and Tony desperately, desperately wanted to deploy a laser or missile or two but refrained from doing so. Some of them looked young, (too young, one of them freaking looked sixteen or so) and Steve said to be careful. So instead he held out his hands and fired stuns while they repeatedly shot him with their stolen guns, the purple flaring so brightly he had to blink, the force of their attack so strong he had to struggle to keep from dropping to one knee. Shot after shot rammed into the armor, hitting his chest and helmet. More dizzy then he would like to admit, already tired thanks to the fight with Bulldozer, Tony struck back with more ferocity than he’d started with, struggling to stay standing as two more joined the gathering around him.
“Sometimes I can’t believe…” Steve trailed off, staring at the suits and shaking his head.
he wished JARVIS was there to make
Whatever that was.
“I don’t trust this guy,” Happy continued. “He’s got another guy with him, he’s shifty.”
Heels clicked down the hallway long after the team returned from shawarma. Tony instinctively hunched a bit at the sound, well-used to what that precise stye of clicking meant. He was definitely in for a lecture. He was a little surprised it had taken this long, but then again, maybe he shouldn’t have been. The city had been a hot mess when they’d ventured from the tower to get dinner. No doubt getting through the airport security and then the nightmare that was the streets of New York took a while. He understood that, respected that.
Please don't judge Nat and Thor too harshly. They really thought they were going to help! Also, the "can't eat, can't sleep, reach for the stars, over the fence, World Series kind of love" is totally a quote stolen from It Takes Two. I have it my head that Darcy made Tony watch it with her some morning he was half-awake after a night in the workshop
“I will.”
“wanted to make sure you weren’t struggling with anything, I guess.”
Wiggling his fingers in a wave goodbye, Tony and took off down the hall. A glance out the window told him he was no longer in Malibu— what the hell, was that the
Although it appeared he’d forgiven the neck stabbing agent, if he thought she was the smart person to call when Tony was suffering through a nightmare and goddamn panic attack.
Steve nodded. “I was at Shield, gathering a few things from my room, hoping to speak with Fury. I wanted to know how they got the scepter from Loki, and he had told me he wanted to speak to me about joining Shield. As I was walking down the hall, an agent approached, thanked me for saving the city, offering to shake my hand. While we did, he leaned forward to put his mouth by my ear.” Shuddering, Steve’s hands clenched. “He whispered
Piercing, intense pressure snapped through Tony’s chest, so tight and painful for a moment he wondered if the reactor glitched again, and his hand snapped up to make sure the casing wasn’t broken. But, no, he realized, with a quick glance down. The pale blue was as bright and strong as always. His fake heart was fine.
of them? Didn’t Fury want you and Steve to work with them?”
“And when it does, we need to be honest, and not hide injuries, or try to brush them off,” Natasha interjected. She also rose from the couch but instead of going to Steve, she walked to Tony, a knowing look in her eyes.
Now it was apparently his turn to blush. Feeling his face heat, Tony waved a hand. “It’s nothing, Steve. No need to thank or feed me.”
“That’s…not what I was going to say,” Steve said, voice tight.
And there really was no competing against Steve or Thor.
“I am relieved to hear your voice sir,” JARVIS said, before he even officially finished connecting.
He trailed off, sighing and letting his eyes shut. An expression Tony hadn’t seen since the first few weeks after the battle crossed his face, and the appearance of it had an ache settling under the reactor. He’d thought maybe…maybe they were leaning on each other, growing closer. But maybe that had been a foolish hope.
“The pleasure is mine, Captain. And Mr. Odinson, Sir really does need to sit down now, if you wouldn’t mind.”
“Right. Come on, Stark. Let’s get you looked at.” And with a swiftness and gentleness that belied the muscles, Thor picked Tony up and carried him into the workshop.
Then he glanced at Thor’s crushed face and remembered. Right. God-damned
“I don’t think Fury is Hydra,” she said slowly, weighing the question over. “I don’t think he would do that. But…I can’t find evidence either way.”
Shoulders tensing, Steve nodded. “You’re right. There is something I need to tell you that I didn’t tell them.”
“Sorry, Point Break. You’re right. You did nothing wrong. Well, you could have shocked the hell out of everybody a little sooner, and somehow you pissed off the Wrecking Crew by just breathing, but that’s nitpicking. Our fearless fucking leader, on the other hand…”
“Well, you know what they say about good deeds,” Hill said, making Tony cackle with laughter. He really hoped their background check on her proved right. It would really piss him off if she turned out to be Hydra.
“I’ll check in again soon,” Steve said. “See you later, Tony.”
The archer didn’t even try to hide his shit-eating grin. “Look, Tony. We’re under the mistletoe together.”
“We’ve been fucking played. That’s what.” Expanding the image, he made it large enough so that all the other Avengers could see the profile of Phil Coulson and the small words under his photo that said “Current Status: Alive.”
“It’s my diagnosis that you are experiencing a severe anxiety attack.” JARVIS said as Bruce rushed in.
“Dessert sounds lovely,” Pepper replied, and the two of them were gone in moments.
overbearing for the man himself.
“Last night,” Tony said. Which was not entirely a lie. He’d slept. A little.
“Alright?” Tony asked, trying not to sound too strained. If Steve realized how heavily he was leaning on Tony he’d do something stupid like try to take his weight back and Tony would have none of it.
“Something gashed a hole in his side,” Tony said as Bruce peered at the wound and swore. “I think it went right through him. It was bleeding, badly, and he…he…the wound needed to be cauterized, it wouldn’t stop bleeding…so I….so I….”
So when the call came in, he groaned, knowing instantly what it would be about. It came from Shield— Tony supposed there really wasn’t any way around that. Refusing to answer Fury’s call for aid would have sent up way too many signals, so after having JARVIS hang up on him once or twice, he answered the call, and agreed to help. Tony, Thor and Steve took off to face the group that was wreaking havoc on Mid-Town. Bruce went as well, but drove in an SUV so he could stay back to help run interference with the Shield agents that were there (and keep a close, close watch on them), and bust out the Hulk as needed.
Waving away a holo-image, Tony spun in his chair and frowned at Steve. “I’ve told Brucie-Bear and Thor a million times, Cap. I’ll be up as soon as I’m sure I’ve got plenty of working suits again. Give me a few more days. If Shield finds something in the meantime, I’ll be there in a heartbeat.”
Air vanishing from his lungs so fast he saw stars, Tony gasped, fighting to get his arms around Bulldozer to pull him the hell off. While he did that, Bulldozer reared back, and rammed his head into Tony’s stomach again, hard enough to make his head hit the back of his helmet, rattling his vision.
was, Tony busied himself with making the coffee, then strolled over to glance out the window with Steve while it brewed. Dark, empty night stared back at him, and heavy clouds hung in the air, according to the weather info JARVIS displayed on the window pane to the right. “Ugh, it’s gross out there. It’s gonna rain soon, I know it. Dammit.”
In no mood for reporters, Tony whirled, his
He left several more bugs around while he did. Just in case.
“What if something happened?” It was a stone in his gut that he couldn’t shake. The knowledge that Steve and Clint had been found, that Hydra had discovered they knew about them….
“Killian?” Tony frowned. “I don’t know that guy.”
Steve nodded again, and stuck out his hand. Tony must have been more tired than he thought, because for some reason he found that hilarious, and nearly doubled-over again while they shook.
Feeling like an absolute ass, Tony reached out, placed a shaky hand on her shoulder. “Pep…”
Steve grinned, and suddenly the fatigue that had been there at the beginning of the call vanished. “Oh yeah? Well, tell Bruce and Thor I’m real sorry about that. We ran into a mess that took a while to get out of.”
“Yes, yes, thank you for graciously allowing us to reside in Casa La Stark,” Clint responded, making Natasha snort and Tony scowl. “J, my man! Put on a good napping movie. Something Tasha will like but put me right to sleep. Ow!” he whined when Natasha pinched him.
, “ Clint said pointedly, standing up and walking to stand between them, “So that I may take my nap now.”
“Tony.” Rhodey had a really good disappointed face. Unfortunately, Tony was well used to it, and no longer affected. “You should get some sleep.”
Flinching, Pepper stepped away, the tears spilling out freely now. “Do you think this is easy for me? I have nightmares of you dying in my arms! Every night, Tony. You’re in the armor, and you’re broken, and you’ve saved the day, but at what cost?” With a small hitch in her breath, Pepper pressed her hands to her face and fought to regain her composure. “You leave me. You die. Every night.”
Refusing to be the weakest link on the team, Tony turned back to Thor. “Here’s my deal, Point Break. I’ll sit here and let you and J look over my ticker if Spangles over there gets some ice and that stomach wound looked at.”
“No, it…”
“A break, Tony,” Steve said firmly as the doors closed behind them. “That means no shop talk.”
Laughing, Tony shook his head head fondly. “I miss you, Happy.”
“Do the best he can,” she interrupted before he could insist on J’s ability to uncover everything. “I know that, Tony. But while they might not have you on their side, we shouldn’t assume they don’t have someone nearly as brilliant as you. That’s their whole deal — get the best scientists and engineers and twist them into believing what they are doing is right. They’ll have covered their tracks well, Tony. Even JARVIS might have to take a while to dig into it.”
Stern sighed. “What do you want, Stark?”
“You sure? Cuz I’m about to overtake both of you, find the Mandarin, take him out, and bust outta here.”
Steve, of course, was much more practical about it.
The one bright side was that his wrist, while aching like a sonovabitch, had at least been treated. So there was that. He wouldn’t die of infection or some shit. But he had still been kidnapped. And that burned his ass. So he turned to the goons, not even bothering to hide his pissiness, and cleared his throat.
Stopping in the middle of the hall, Tony reached out, laid a hand on Rhodey’s shoulder. “I’ve got a great family,” he said quietly, unable to put into words exactly what Rhodey meant to him. Jim was the first person to become his friend that hadn’t worked for him. The person to bring him home from Afghanistan. The person who got him to snap out of his misery, and fix the palladium poisoning. No one would ever replace him.
But the AI remained silent, so Tony walked through the doors and blinked at what he found inside.
before the rest of him did.
“Yep, sounds good,” he managed, suddenly now desperate to get the hell off the call. “Talk soon, Cap,” he said, and hit disconnect, heart pounding wildly.
“Aldrich Killian.”
“Tony.” This time, his name sounded warbly as Pepper’s chin wobbled, eyes filling as she stared at him. “Oh my god.
“I”m all ears,”  Tony said after what felt like hours passed and Steve hadn’t elaborated. “Any time now, Cap.”
“I’d like that. If you really wouldn’t mind.”
“Of course, Brucie-Bear. You’re my favorite,” he said, as Bruce leaned forward to kiss Tony’s other cheek. Bruce blushed deeply as he stepped back, but his eyes were still bright and full of fun. Grinning back, Tony said, “Anyway, as I was saying, we better get going, Nat.”
“I’m afraid Captain Rogers is correct, sir.”
“What about me?” Tony asked.
“It does not appear to be Agent Coulson’s deception. He was indeed, technically dead, and SHIELD brought him back to life using methods they had in place for a downed Avenger. Agent Coulson has been in major surgeries and recoveries these last few months.”
“But I broke Harlem,” Bruce continued, his eyes too sad and far too old. “And it wasn’t pretty. And I have to live with that. Every day. So I won’t say I understand. But I will say, when my memories sneak up on me like that, tea helps. And friendship. Talking. So. Would you like me to make you some tea?”
“That’s how it’s gonna be.”
“What are you talking about?”
“They couldn’t have gone far, unless it was already planned,” Tony pointed out. “Moving that much, that quickly? You and Clint were only gone a few days.”
“Great. Let me know if you wanna pop down to the workshop the rest of the night, I could use someone to bounce ideas off myself, to be honest. Unless you don’t feel like listening to me ramble on about the sheer genius of the Mark 11, but then you would be wrong, and you’re a smart man, so don’t be wrong,” Tony said, moving to get the coffee.
“These weren’t designed for plates,” Tony argued, then frowned when a chunk of rice and chicken fell out of the foil and onto his desk. “Shit.”
Timing it right, he cut the thrusters, and let them free-fall for a bit while Heather stretched her arm out, reaching for Jasper. The poor guy kept flailing about in the air, but eventually Heather caught on, and the electric pulse Tony sent through her extended to Jasper too.
The clicking heels stopped, and a voice he knew, so much better than his own, whispered, “Tony?”
“Tony?”
And also definitely
“Please don’t tell me there’s a twelve year old kid waiting in the car,” he told her.
“You haven’t, and thank you for that, JARVIS.”
Smiling back, Bruce held his own mug and nodded again. "Anytime, Tony. Anytime."
So Tony nodded, and they quickly swapped positions, Clint and Bruce helping keep Steve stable while they did. His leg buckled as he stood, the world spinning wildly for a second. Bruce’s eyes went wide, but Tony shrugged him off and hurried out of the cabin and toward the jet. The armor was there, waiting for him, and he stepped inside, trembling, thankful that the suit surrounded him, kept him steady as he went back to the cabin.
Oblivious to the weirdness between Steve and Tony, Thor once again gestured for Tony to sit down. Then he took the wires Tony held and said, “We’ll just look at those injuries, as well as your heart.”
“Fine. Then I won’t apologize for yelling at you for it.”
He turned to leave, and Tony’s brain kicked back in. “Steve, wait. I was wrong too. The bottle thing. Everything special about you was already there. The serum only enhanced that.”
His subconscious had figured some things out
Too tired to be unnerved, Tony did as JARVIS suggested, and made his way to the workshop. As he got out of the elevator and made his approach, the sound of music already blasting from within made him pause.
trust her, and could leave her with the most important thing in his life.
“It’s not the same. They believe in Shield, in what they’re doing. Nat, particularly. She and I have talked a lot, over these last few weeks. Shield gave them both a purpose, a chance to start over. It’s going to be hard to rip that away from them.”
“Don’t do that again,” Clint warned, crossing his arms. “You scared the hell out of us.”
“That he literally ripped my heart out of my chest? Yeah, that’s what I meant. He went after the reactor.”
Squeezing his hand back and staring into his eyes, Steve scooted closer to Tony on his knees, so that their faces were only a few inches apart, the table hovering over them. Tension rolling through him like lightning, Tony swallowed, eyes on Steve’s face and Steve’s lips and Steve’s mouth.
“Fuck, okay,” he said, taking in the scene. The Wrecking Crew were turning to turn out to be more of a nuisance than they sounded. And there were a lot of minions with alien weapons. Someone was so getting fired. But he had to figure out the best next step first. He could go straight to Steve or Thor, offer them a little backup. Or he could fly through the room, start taking out the massive group in the back and give them more of a chance. “I’m going in.”
Oh. Right. That made sense. Steve considered it a dare, and God knew the man didn’t back down from anything. Tony wasn’t sure why he suddenly felt like someone had taken his heart and yanked it out, but he managed to put on a smile anyway.
“Me too,” Bruce admitted. “Alright. If you’ve really got it handled here with Tony, I’m going to go back and help Pepper. Thor and Jane and Darcy will be here soon. But let me know if he wakes and refuses to get more sleep. I’ll have Hulk drag him to bed if necessary.”
Making a noise of agreement, Natasha pulled out the bread and peanut butter. “Bruce mentioned you’ve been getting the suits fixed. And making more, from what I hear?”
The words were still too tired, too slurred for Tony’s liking. Gently running his hand up and down Steve’s uninjured side, Tony pressed his cheek to the side of Steve’s head and fought back the urge to press a gentle kiss there. Instead, he said, “Damn right you will be. But don’t think we aren’t gong to have words about you leaping out of a plane, mister. I haven’t forgotten that, you scared the ever loving hell out of me, you lunatic.”
Okay, that was a low blow. “Zip ties are a pain in the ass. And to be fair, I was working on it. You just showed up to do your thigh move of death before I could get anywhere.”
Tony held back a sigh. “It’s fine, Steve.”
“Tried. Didn’t take,” Tony admitted.
“I think they’re still active, only carrying out their missions in secret. And I think they’ve infiltrated Shield.”
“JARVIS can—”
“I don’t know if I can promise that.”
A strangled noise ripped from Tony at the sight of the wound, at the sight of Steve trusting him, at the knowledge that Tony was going to hurt him.
“Bulldozer,” the man grunted, grinning. He fired the gun he held, making purple jets of light slam into the armor. Cursing, Tony took a step back, and reminded himself that Cap said to be careful. Gritting his teeth, Tony set his repulsors to stun and went to town.
‘’I’ve got it, I’ve got it,” he muttered, but his right boot went out and they dropped.
“Sir, the armor integrity is at fifty percent.”
“I trust you, Tony,” she repeated, the emphasis making his jaw drop. “The man that offered to fly Phil to Portland to keep the love alive.” Her voice cracked on Agent’s name, but she didn’t look away. Neither did Tony. For the life of him, he couldn’t look away from those fierce green eyes, locked on him with intent and passion.
“It’s different!” Steve shouted, face turning red.
“Next time, come find me,” Tony said as the coffee maker beeped, announcing it’s readiness. “I’m always up, Cap. And sometimes it helps to say things out loud. Bounce things off people. I told you before, you can trust me. I won’t blab, if you don’t want everyone to know all your thoughts. But when you can’t sleep, when you can’t get Loki’s words out of your head? Come find me.”
Bruce and Thor dropped by numerous times. They brought food, and tried to get him to leave, but Tony only grunted at them, and ate while he worked. Thor kept the bots company, and had ridiculous conversations with JARVIS about Earth culture and customs. Unfortunately, he would eventually start waxing poetic about Jane, and that was when Tony would have to kick him out. He just couldn’t deal with a happy couple right then.
With a sigh, Tony leaned forward and rested his head against the window he’d been staring out. It wasn’t too far from the one Loki’d thrown him through — which was still sporting a Tony-sized gap in it, though someone had thrown a tarp over it to keep out the wind. He’d have to get that fixed soon.
He’d be having quite the conversation with Anne Marie about how the hell they got them once this wrapped up. They’d spent weeks hunting those down, dammit, and it wasn’t so a wrecking crew could become a pain in his ass.
Clint had complained, naturally, but the rest of the team had bid them farewell with grins, telling Steve to enjoy his vacation. Nat was the designated leader while they were gone, and she promised Steve seven times she would call him in if anything looked suspicious without looking like she wanted to kill him for being overly paranoid. Deciding now was a good vacation for himself as well, Thor took Jane and Darcy back to New Mexico in another of Tony’s planes.
“Sir, another call is coming in. It appears to be Captain Rogers.”
Steve nodded. “I think there’s a good chance they’re using it the same way Fury used the Tesseract. To study it — and to make weapons.”
“Just me.” Steve stood with his hands in the air, cringing. “Sorry. Didn’t mean to sneak up on you.”
“Uhhhhhh,” Tony said, his own eyes going wide as saucers as Steve nudged Clint out of the way, then stood directly under the mistletoe and lifted his chin. “Whatcha doin’ there, Cap?”
Steve had “bumped” into Sitwell at Shield, and slipped him a note, saying he couldn’t break cover and contact him. Telling him to keep away, let Steve be a mole, until Steve had something on the Avengers to take them down with. It apparently worked — the agent had indeed kept away, and barely looked at Steve when he went into Shield.
“You don’t have long before he heads this way,” she said, continued, ignoring his cursing. “If you want to save Pepper, you should choose quickly.”
“Great,” Tony said as the limo arrived. Snagging his sunglasses out of his pocket, Tony slid them on and took a deep breath. “Let’s crack on then, shall we?”
Warm fingertips bumped against his, and Tony snapped his head up, connecting gazes with Steve.
“Easy, Stark.” Natasha. That was the Widow’s voice, and what the hell was Natalie Rushman doing in his goddamn bedroom? Snarling, Tony tried to shove her away, but he didn’t have the energy to do much more than swat at her.
“Tony,” Steve said, hints of exasperation in his voice, but it was too late.
What the god-damn fuck had he been thinking?
Right. He was supposed to get up, continue on, even though Steve hadn’t woken. Feeling like he was moving though mud, Tony lifted his head, but kept his hand on Steve’s. “Thanks, Clint.”
“Well why don’t I accompany you and make sure that actually happens. Or that you don’t get kidnapped again.”
“Fuck,” Tony muttered. “How did we miss that?”
Smiling softly, Steve leaned back, lifting his t-shirt to pull it up and out of the way, pale and weary. “It’ll be okay. I trust you.”
“Fine,” Steve panted, making a true jolt of fear shudder down Tony’s spine.
.” The scolding wasn’t nearly as stern as it should have been with the hint of a laugh in it. “I don’t mean to make things difficult.”
, he wanted to respond, but no one could hear you in space, and he couldn’t get the words out. In the back of his mind he wondered who that soft, female voice belonged to. It wasn’t Pepper, the call had failed, he hadn’t said goodbye.
Now, however, it seemed he wasn’t the only one slightly agitated about not hearing from Steve or Clint. Nothing in her face or body language gave it away, but Tony was getting to know her well enough now to know that the way she forcibly made herself seem casual was the signal she was anything but.
“Fair enough.” Rubbing his eyes, he glanced over at the wall and saw it was two am anyway. “Okay, you win. I’ll get some sleep, and then we can chat in the morning. Square deal?”
Sniffling, Pepper leaned back, searching his eyes. “Have you gotten any rest since I left?”
Tony fought not to face-palm. “Flip the screen, and then I can see what they’re doing.”
Wake up, now, come on, Sleeping Beauty.”
“Yeah,” he said, but he didn’t move, didn’t let go of Steve.
“From what I’ve been able to uncover, it is accurate, Agent Barton,” JARVIS said. “I apologize for not notifying you before, it was buried quite deep. Very few operatives have knowledge of Agent Coulson’s status.”
Later, when the President was secure, Killian’s ass had been kicked, and Pepper was safe and at the Tower, Tony sank onto his couch and tried not to groan. The battle had been long and hard — Killian had a lotta goons enhanced with Extremis—but the Avengers had beaten them in the end. Thor had helped out the most, getting tired of the enhanced soldiers and eventually frying them with quite a bit of lightning. Unlike most of their other attacks on the soldiers able to regrow limbs, that had stuck. Rhodey had been able to get to his suit and get the President to safety, and the rest of the team had successfully defeated the rest of the Extremis army while Tony found Pepper and took down Killian on his own.
from Natalie/Natasha? Sure, pain had overridden his senses, but that had happened before, and he’d survived. “Ffuuk.”
Steve blushed. “At first, I was checking to see if we’d found anything on Bucky.”
“Hey, Pep,” he said, smiling down. It wasn’t painful to see her anymore, thank fuck. Those first few weeks had been brutal, while the two of them tried to find a balance between friends and former lovers. It had been a difficult balancing act, but as time went on, the hurt had lessened and the awkwardness was finally starting to fade. Over the last few months they’d settled into a familiar rhythm, which he had to admit, was somehow working.
“What?” Snapping up the faceplate, Tony whirled, finding Steve leaning heavily on Thor. His uniform was scorched and black in several places, and the flesh underneath looked red and burnt. Almost charred. Tony’s heart leapt to this throat at the sight of it. “What the hell happened? Steve, you alright?”
She smiled, something flickering over her face he didn’t quite recognize. It wasn’t regret, they were past that. Wistfulness? Yeah, maybe that it was it. She looked slightly wistful as she said, “Sounds great, Tony. Tell Steve hi.”
Even as he pretended to scowl, relief flooded him. It could work. The Avengers, as a team. It could really work.
“Oh hey, Cap,” he said nonchalantly, knowing better than to start off asking what was wrong. Yawning exaggeratedly and dragging his feet a little, as if he were more exhausted then he felt, Tony headed for the kitchenette in the corner. “I ran out of coffee downstairs and thought I’d venture up here to steal a cup. Want some?”
“Ah…thanks?” Tony said, as Thor nodded, beaming, and stepped aside to reveal Clint. Tony blinked. “You’ve got to be kidding.”
“Shit,” Tony said, dropping onto the couch. “I didn’t mean to say that.”
“Merry Christmas, Tony,” Bruce said, eyes full of laughter just like the rest of them. “May I?”
“Sir!” JARVIS said, as the HUD went scarlet. Swearing, Tony turned and saw the device, stomach plummeting to his toes. Knowing he was about to do something stupid, Tony lifted his repulsors and fired at the counter on the wall, holding snacks and all the drinks Tony used to request before Afghanistan. It struck true — his repulsor strike tore a hole in the wall and sucked the bomb out an instant before it blew.
When Steve fell asleep halfway through
“You have a cat. In your office.”
Steve was certain Hydra had it, and had vowed to do some digging. Only Barton had gone with him.
Clint hissed, and so Tony scooted forward, laid his head down on the bed next to Steve’s arm, and closed his eyes. Unable to help himself, he moved his hand up so that he could again carefully cradle Steve’s hand, wishing that somehow the solider would squeeze back. Throat burning, Tony kept his eyes shut, and gave a small sniff. It had been hours since they landed back at the Tower, and Steve hadn’t woken. Hadn’t even moved.
“I…” What was his life? Now he had to choose between pathetically attempting at getting more sleep without a terrifying nightmare, or having a snack with a terrifying assassin?
“Fucking peachy,” Tony rasped, voice sounding like he’d spent the night screaming. Distantly, he wondered if he had.
“Good.” Steve nodded, “Good.”
Swearing, Tony ran his hand through his hair again. “We can’t let that happen.”
as you flew that nuke into the portal. You got lucky this time, Tony, but what about next time? What if you stop getting lucky? If you continue with being an Avenger, you’re going to get yourself killed.”
What. The. Fuck.
“So, what, we go back to trusting no one, then? Not even these guys?” Clint asked, gesturing to Steve and Tony. “Never showing anyone our true selves, who we really are?”
“Breathe, Tony. Breathe with me,” she said, and took a deep inhale. Following the order without really meaning to, Tony took a deep breath, and released it at the same time Natasha did. Eventually his vision righted, and he was able to see Natasha clearly — her hair was pulled back in a messy ponytail, and she wore a plain blank tank top and gray sweatpants. That seemed wrong, the Widow was always completely flawless, would never show a vulnerable side like that. But she didn’t seem to care that she’d been caught with her guard down, and only continued to guide him through the breathing exercises, making sure to never touch him, but staying close enough he could feel her body heat.
“You needed help.”
, and not some dare that Steve couldn’t back down from.
“You experience things,” Tony said quietly, while Bruce turned on the burner for the kettle. “And then they’re over, and you still can’t explain them.”
Tony faltered. “Steve, this is just a silly game, you don’t actually have to…”
Actually, an apparently masochistic part of Tony wanted to stay just like this with Steve forever. But his hands were going numb and his wrist hurt, so he nodded. “Please.”
His cameras zoomed in and Tony caught sight of a flash of blue at the gaping hole. Once again, his stomach dropped and nearly fell out his ass. A figure
They were becoming a team, a family. The Tower was often filled with laughter and arguments when they were all together — Clint was a slob and hid in vents, Nat was tidy and hated clutter. Bruce was a combo of the two, Thor had a tendency to forget he didn’t have attendants, and Steve was neat but left his sketchbook and pencils everywhere. Tony couldn’t remember a time in his life when he had felt so at home around others the way he did now.
us to help you?”
Humming, Tony plopped onto his couch. “What kind of breakthrough?”
"Thanks, Brucie-bear."
“Pretty sure Thor and I have no plans to be turned into a human sacrifice today, so thanks for that,” Tony said. “So watch out for the guns, staves, and a bomb. And a crowbar and a demolition ball. And whatever else they’ve got. Check. Shall we go in?”
And that, that was just a little too close too comfort, brought back the wrong memories. A startlingly strong shudder ran through Tony, his nightmare flashing through his mind as his chest tightened. Breath picking up as rapidly as his heartbeat, Tony realized he needed to end the call, now. Somehow, he managed, “Hey, I…I’d hate to cut you off. Do you have your taser on you?”
“Tony!”
“Course not. Mi casa es su casa and all that. Couch is old as hell, but it’s comfy, so feel free to set up there anytime.” Lifting the mugs, he turned, caught Steve’s eyes again. “Anytime, Steve. I mean that.”
“Oh yeah. With zip ties. It’s a ball.” He would not be insulted by the zip ties. He would not. “So. You took Killian’s money and thirteen years later, you’re in dungeon.”
“Armor integrity forty percent.”
“Actually, I really think you need to have that looked at. At least let me look you over,” Bruce said firmly when Steve sent a baleful look his way. Tony couldn’t help the smirk that crossed his face. Ha. His Science Bro was the only one who also saw reason.
“That was different,” Tony sniffed.
“Like anyone would ever expect you to sit still and not act,” Tony said, making Steve laugh. Opening up a drawer, Tony found some paper and pens Pepper had left with him ages ago and held it out. “Write down everything you know about Hydra, and everything you’ve suspected before brining this to me. We’ll add it to JARVIS’s files so we can expand on the search as needed.”
“Sir, the armor’s integrity is down twenty percent.”
“Now, that’s just not true. If anyone needs to kick your ass, those rights still revert to me,” he argued, and Tony threw his head back and laughed. Though he looked exhausted, Rhodey grinned and continued, “But I’m glad to see you relying on them, and letting them in, Tones. You deserve friends and family.”
- The 1975
Wrapping his hand around the mug he offered, Tony laughed and stared down at the little teabag, letting the heat from the mug spread through him, banishing the clamminess and chill that had lingered ever since his call with Happy ended.
It was a pretty good ending to the Mandarin disaster, and Tony sat exhaustedly on his couch, grinning like an idiot.
, Tony Stark, known Lothario and playboy. And Tony really, really couldn’t have cared less.
Across the room, Thor bellowed, and a bunch of lightning erupted. Apparently he wasn’t the only one tired of this shit. Tony winced, as The Wrecking Crew went flying, Bulldozer, included. Tony sighed. Dammit, when had that guy gotten back into the fight?
“Of course she does,” Tony said, bending down to hold out a hand. The cat blinked at him, then leaned forward to nudge her head into Tony’s hand, purring contentedly.
“Yes, and we’ll tell the whole team once you and Steve are done behaving like children.”
“Ugh, Jesus. What is that assclown doing here?” he asked Pepper.
Nodding Steve, sagged against the counter. “Yeah. That’s pretty much what I’ve been thinking the last week.”
Steve sighed. “It will be fine.”
“I”m fine, platypus. And I was about to venture off to bed, anyway.”
We are going to have words about that, I promised you we would. Then you walked through the woods and failed to tell me how injured you were. Did you forget about that? Because I did not, Steven, not even a little bit. So now I’m gonna tell you—“
“Ten thousand feet.”
“Oh, look at that, I need another drink,” Clint said and scrambled up and away in moments. Bewildered, Tony watched him go, then shrugged and let out a huge yawn. Whatever. If Bird Brain wanted to be weird, it was no skin off his back.
Bulldozer had a head like a…well. Bulldozer.
“Is that not a custom here?” Thor asked, looking like a kicked puppy as he handed Steve the ice.
Steve handed over the bag. “Deal.”
“Tony, no! You need to come with me.”
Unfortunately, Steve caught Tony’s smirk. His eyes narrowed for a moment, and then he stuck out his chin and nodded. “Fine. But only if you check over Tony, too.”
good-looking.
Alright, it was probably totally ridiculous to suggest such a thing at all, because Tony was head over heels for Steve and Steve totally did not feel the same, but the more he looked at Steve, the more the circles under his eyes and the tightness around his mouth stood out. He’d been going non-stop since waking up from the ice. If anyone deserved to relax, it was Steve.
“Steve,” he said as the suit opened up around him, and Tony was able to sit up.  It came out muffled so he cracked his jaw and tried again. “Steve.”
“Take a break. Let Nat take a turn at it, look at all the angles. I’ve got a few merger meetings I need to be in Malibu for this week. Come with me.”
Quite a few of them turned his way once he landed amongst them. More than he would have preferred, if he was being honest. Those guns were a bitch. But Tony held firm, and ignored the way his teeth rattled every time the armor took a hit.
“I…” The words washed through Tony, making him stutter and having the flush creeping back. And why the hell was his heartbeat picking up? What was he, 16? Just because his crush was saying nice things about him didn’t mean he had to act like an idiot.
the weakest link. I couldn’t do it, Tony. I can’t.”
Steve smiled back. “You’re welcome. Wanna tell me about the Mark 11?”
“Threaten the Mandarin because he hurt your friend.”
. In for a penny, in for a pound. Giving in to the need to reach out to Steve, he placed a hand on his shoulder, and nearly sighed, feeling Steve’s warmth flow through him, the unsteady feeling he’d felt all night finally disappearing.
“Is responsible for his own fucking actions,” Tony interrupted. “You aren’t to blame, either, Point Break. And we’ll never capture him if we’re all too busy feeling sick and guilty over him pulling one over on us. So we need to set it aside, and focus on what’s next. On how we’re going to find and catch the bastard.”
“Oh, well.” Tony waved him off with his free hand. “Lotta people would disagree with you there, Cap, not that I’d blame them, I’m really not…”
“This is the most wonderful tradition, is it not?” He asked Tony. “And now we are also under the mistletoe together, and I shall show you my affections!” He reached out, grabbed Tony by the elbows and plucked him off the floor.
“The bad guys, sure. It’ll be fine, Natasha, now we can finally get them to make a stupid move and take them out.”
“Killian has Pepper,” Maya said, and his stomach dropped, her words taking the air right out of his chest. “He’s planning on using her to get you to do what he wants. He’ll inject her with Extremis.”
“They lied to him?” Bruce’s voice was a shaky whisper, and Tony’s eyes cut to him quickly. His Bruce-bear wasn’t green, not yet, but Tony could see it was taking everything Bruce had to keep it that way.
“Told you!” Darcy shouted, while he scowled and ran a hand through his hair.
“No sign of cardiac anomaly or unusual brain activity. I’ve contacted Dr. Banner, sir.”
“Did steal, actually. He pulled one over one me using another piece of my own tech against me, rendering me immobile. Yanked the reactor right out.”
Tower. Safe. He heard the words but didn’t register them, struggling to breathe. Air, he needed air, but there was no air in space, and the suit wasn’t sustained for that kind of thing. There would be no oxygen for him, there, in the maw of the abyss, where nothing but cold darkness surrounded him while above an army Earth could never be prepared for waited.
“Do not, for the love of God, keep that up,” Natasha warned. “Or bad things will happen. And no one will find the bodies.”
“Yes,” she said, voice calm, and body relaxed, but the look in her eyes made his blood run cold, “we will.”
“Of course.”
“I might have asked JARVIS for help,” he admitted.
“Phone,” Tony demanded, and when the man tossed his phone his way, Tony left him with his life.
Steve’s frown, already so full of scowling he resembled Oscar the Grouch, somehow deepened. “That’s the thing. I thought he got away with the scepter, too, but when I woke up, it was right next to me. I gave it to Natasha while I came to find you two.”
“Tony. Thor.” Steve’s face was solemn — which was saying something for a guy who had just woken up after a 70-year nap. He looked like Tony felt: exhausted, beat all to hell, and done with everything. And because absolutely fucking
“Says the guy who just used Natasha as a pillow.”
“Aw, come on, Stark. Look, this one’s adorable, can I keep him? At least let me put twinkling lights on him. Christmas is coming up. It’d be adorable.”
Folding his arms, Tony narrowed his eyes. “What gives you the idea I’d do a thing like that?”
“JARVIS called me,” she said. He snorted. Of course. During her time as his assistant, she’d learned all about JARVIS. He hadn’t needed to explain his AI to her when he’d brought them all back to the Tower after shawarma, although he knew J had given her hell the first day or so because of her betrayal. Bruce had mentioned a few times how odd it was that no one else had to suffer through cold showers in the Tower, or worry about getting trapped in the elevator. Tony had outwardly shrugged it off as mishaps of a new and recently attacked building, but inwardly he’d cackled with glee. JARVIS always had his back.
Oh. The mission had not got well, then.
“JARVIS, put everything we’ve got into the thrusters!” he shouted, praying. The plane was still in the air — not falling, but it had been several minutes, and Steve could have been hurt, or could have gotten sucked out or….
Then he blacked out.
“Oh, shit. That’s not turbulence,” Tony managed.
Tony’s nostrils flared at the mention of Sitwell. Guy seemed like your general rule follower, almost reminding him of Agent Agent. Yet there was no doubt about what he’d whispered to Steve in the hallway. Tony had watched the footage himself. JARVIS was running a more in-depth check on him as they spoke.
It wasn’t the first time he’d found somebody in his workshop. Pepper was often waiting for him, once upon a time. Rhodey too, went down occasionally, to fiddle with the War Machine armor (he would not refer to it as Iron Patriot in his own mind, he refused) or to work on one of Tony’s old cars. But Rhodey was likely either still sound asleep, or already awake and gone, prepared to deal with the fall out from the Killian Incident. So he had to admit, this was new.
“I let him fall,” Steve whispered.
He had Tony there. Quickly turning back to the armor (taking several deeps breath through his mouth for a moment because whoa the world was apparently capable of spinning rather fast), Tony snatched his left gauntlet, thankful one of them were still in working condition. Then he sent a mournful glance at the armor and opened a hidden panel.
his past always came back to bite him in the ass. “I would have helped you before you started experimenting on people. Before you got involved with Killian and the Mandarin. You should have come to me a long time ago, Maya. I can’t help you now.”
“We had.” Things had been nice between him and Steve the last few months. When they weren’t plotting to take down Hydra, they made their way through Steve’s list, watching movies, TV shows, or listening to music. Steve still called his blessed 80s rock atrocious, but the 70s era had grown on him, so Tony counted it as a win. Nobody could resist Zeppelin.
“I’ll check you over while Bruce tends to Steve,” Natasha said quietly. “Deal?”
rule, so your ass is total grass when she hears about how you didn’t ‘fess up.
, and oh holy fuck he was sweetly kissing Tony’s upper lip, and then a hand twined in his hair, angling Tony’s head just a little more, and Steve
, what was that, when did Pep start bringing his platypus as her date? There was an opportunity to snoop and tease if he ever saw one) Tony was in a lighter mood, ready to find a way to face Steve when they returned home.
As if she knew exactly what he was thinking, Natasha narrowed her eyes. “And don’t you dare hide away, Steve deserves better than that. And so do you.”
Steve paled. “God.”
?” Steve asked, an instant before Tony remembered that he’d doctored
“I will reprogram you, see if I won’t!”
the kiss and Tony’s pants got uncomfortably tight rather rapidly. What the fuck, where did Steve learn to kiss like
“Wait. Tony. Tony, are you suggesting…are you suggesting the Avengers move in here permanently?”
Thor lifted his hammer, glanced to Steve.
Just a little note I forgot last chapter -- throughout this story (this chapter and the next) Tony will have panicked reactions to what happened with the wormhole, similar to how he does in IM3. Please take care if that is a problem! I will try to mention them but wanted to give a heads up.
Steve slammed his fist on the table, breathing heavily. “I can’t go through it again, okay? So consider
“That’s not gonna do a damn bit of good, let me out of here. Maya!” he shouted, but it was too late. She was gone.
“Steve…”
The news did not go over well.
When he got no response, Tony hugged him tighter, pressing a trembling hand to Steve’s heart. “You gotta wake up, Steve. Don’t leave me. I need you to be awake, now, alright?
“It’s a pretty good likelihood.”
“Gods, aliens, other dimensions,” Tony placed his hands on the counter, fought not to fidget. “I…I’m just a man in a can. The only reason I haven’t cracked up is probably because you guys moved in. Which is great. But, uh. I can’t sleep. You guys go to bed, and I go downstairs. I do what I know. I tinker.”
“Alright, then. Your loss,” Tony said.
The blush was back, only this time it wasn’t really as endearing. “I uh…that’s part of why I acted. I don’t like seeing you hurt, either.”
He lost track of how many hits the suit took. But it had survived the actual battle with the Chitauri, and it would damn well hold up against the group attacking them now. He stormed his way to the back, shooting beams of his own, the blue tangling with the purple, and started stunning as many as he could.
“I am not sure, sir.”
“Just don’t let her near Thor with it,” Steve murmured, making Tony laugh out loud. Grinning back, Steve wandered over to Tony’s hall of armors, showcasing his original suits.
Steve wandered over as well, and it clicked.
“Oh, I’ve got that figured out, Pep,” he interrupted, putting down his mug. Gesturing to her, he pulled up a holo-image of the tower, and spun it around. “Now that the the most damaged floors are fixed, the rest of the penthouse gets focused on first, because I don’t want to stare at that damn broken window anymore. Then I thought we could update the floor plan. Everyone’s gonna need their own permanent floor, so we’ll put Point Break near the top so he can fly in and out easily, and Legolas beneath him, because the dude likes heights. Then Cap…”
Oh, Jesus, this was a bad idea. He was probably going to have to kill that hope at some point, was going to squash it like a bug if Loki had in fact been lying. But instead of taking it back, Tony said, “I’ll start a search for Barnes. Just in case. And then we’ll see if…and then we’ll see.”
“For you, sir? Always.”
“It’s okay.”
“Alright. I’ll start a search.”
, Tony decided he really couldn’t blame him, and quietly paused the movie and grabbed the nearby blanket. Draping it over Steve, he took a moment to take the captain in, happy to see the tightness that had been around his eyes and mouth so often lately still hadn’t reappeared. Squeezing his hands at his sides to keep from doing something stupid like run a finger along Steve’s cheek or worse, run a hand through his hair or kiss his forehead, Tony checked to make sure the blanket completely covered him and then headed down to the garage.
“Tony, please. Please wake up.”
“Can’t risk it falling into the wrong hands,” Tony said, and set the suit to self-destruct. Dragging it with them would have been his preferred method, but he couldn’t do that and help Steve. “Come on, we gotta get a good distance away before it blows and triggers any unwelcome searchers.”
“How…What made you think…no, you know what? I’m gonna need alcohol for this. JARVIS, hold my calls. Cap, let’s head to the workshop, and then you can fill me in on what the fuck I’ve missed.” Popping his sandwich in his mouth, Tony strode out of the room, mind on overdrive. Hydra?
“Steve.” Heart shattering, Tony did reach out this time, placing his hand on Steve’s shoulder. “You didn’t. Sometimes bad things happen, Cap.”
“You don’t have to hide that from us, Tony. We all have nights where we can’t sleep. You’re not alone in that.”
Shocked, Tony stared at him until Bruce snatched the kettle down with a firm little nod, like he’d just won an important argument. Tony’s lips curved, while Bruce poured the tea. “Right. Clearly, we can’t have you getting angry.”
“And what? You won’t be part of it?” he asked, harsher than he meant, but he couldn’t help it. Her words from years ago flashed through his mind, that long ago night he’d asked her to help with Obie. After everything, they were back to that? Back to the beginning all over again?
“The fuck?” Tony flinched, dropping the knife. “Ow, shit. What the hell, Steve? What do you mean, you think they’re still around?”
Natasha shook her head. “My focus was on you, not so much the circus occurring around you. But you’re right, he was after your suits. I wonder…” she trailed off, then looked at Pepper and Rhodey expectantly.
“I’m right here, Tony,” Bruce said, scooting around Natasha with his medical bag and hurrying in. Clint was hot on his heels, and the three of them surrounded the little bed, faces all drawn with worry as they stared at Steve.
Steve stood in the far corner of the workshop, holograms surrounding him. DUM-E whirred softly nearby, as if he wanted to do a task for the solider. Tony hoped Steve remembered to tell DUM-E
A small smile crossed Natasha’s face, and then she stood and walked to the nightstand, where’d he’d left a glass of water sitting. Gracefully picking it up, she moved back to Tony, holding the cup out. “Here. Some water will help.”
It didn’t escape his notice that she wasn’t eating or sleeping much, either.
“Son of a bitch,” Tony swore, resisting the urge to swerve around and glare at Stern. “Seriously? Stern? Why didn’t you say anything?”
“Okay. Fine. I think my boss is working for the Mandarin.”
“I’m sorry, Tony,” was the last thing he heard before darkness overtook him.
tower, and the elevator swiftly went from the lobby to the floor that held Tony’s workshop. Barely having enough time to get truly comfy on the elevator wall, Tony felt himself being heaved back up by Thor way too soon.
“I know the feeling. I tried to get some rest, but just kept getting antsy. Thought I would come down here and be productive, instead. Hope you don’t mind.”
“In her defense, I’m a handful.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Yeah, not likely. “Sure thing, Cap. See you around,” Tony said, and strolled out, bolting for the workshop. He really did have a lot to get started on. The suits weren’t going to repair themselves.
, Steve, how did you take so many hits, you….your shield.” Tony stopped, turning to look at the shield he’d dropped. “You idiot. You
“I…” Steve blinked, shaking his head. “Did you not
? Like he was slowly and methodically taking Tony apart, making him tremble, and sending Tony’s head spinning at the same time? It was intoxicating; Tony couldn’t help but be swept along, caught up and desperate as he tightened his grip on Steve’s shoulders, trying to keep up, his mind full of nothing but
Steve froze. “What?”
Steve hovered a little, tentative and shy, not quite brushing their mouths together yet. This close, Tony could see how ridiculously long his lashes were, how a little bit of gold was flecked in the blue of Steve’s eyes as Steve peered at him from behind those lashes. A little uncertain that this was
Those words were said too slowly, too drowsily. “Steve? Hey. Come on, Cap. Stay awake for me,” Tony said, shaking him a little, craning his head to see Steve’s face better.
“Let me help.” Crouching to his knees, Tony bent to pick up the fallen chess set. He grabbed a handful, then plopped them back onto the table, reaching his other hand out in search for more.
“Then I’ll take a look at what you’ve got, expand on it a bit. I’ll help, Steve. You don’t have to do this alone. You should have told us earlier you were this worried about what Loki said.”
“You should be sleeping,” Steve said, but there wasn’t really any heat in his words.
“Goose sort of does what Goose wants,” Fury replied. “And to answer your question, I kind of had the impression that the Avengers were going to take care of whatever threat comes next. What with the whole, team-bonding, living in the Tower thing, and all.”
Steve smiled at him. “Then we better get to work.”
Apparently that wasn’t what Fury expected. He frowned, just for a moment, before asking, “What?”
“It’s different. I’m not…I’m not a super spy or a super solider or super scientist.”
Tony snorted. “Uh huh, sure. Except I’m not the only one wandering around during late hours.”
“Thanks,” Tony grunted. Alright, he was about sick of this, how many of these bastards were there? Why the hell did they keep coming?
“You’ve been here nearly a month, Tony. You need a break.”
“Don’t take it personally. I don’t remember what I had for breakfast. Maya.” He said, just to watch her eyes widen, and then roll. Of course he’d recognized her — with all the talk of New Year’s Eve and Killian and Switzerland, he’d racked his brain to try and remember something.
“Tony.”
“Well, I guess I better mosey that way and find some. Have I mentioned how much I love it when you find loopholes in your code, J?”
“Well, the technology took a bit of learning, but I think I picked it up alright. JARVIS is a lifesaver, and the internet? So helpful. Why? Does it seem like I’m struggling?”
Drawing himself up to his full height, Steve huffed, “No one asked you to look, Tony.”
Glancing down at his coffee, Tony knew he had to fess up the truth. He couldn’t let Steve think he was some shiny, amazing person, because… well. He wasn’t. “Ah, well. Truthfully, Cap, they would have a lot of examples to back their claims up, I’m not really a…”
“Cap?” Tony croaked. Ow. Ow, ow, ow. His head hurt. His shoulder hurt. And the suit was dead, he couldn’t move. “Whzzgoinon?”
going to tell the super spy thank you for seeing him when he was at his most vulnerable, but he did give a grunt of acknowledgement. When he lifted the glass and took a small sip, the cool liquid soothed the burning, raw sensation that had been riveting down his entire body. Grateful that he no longer felt like a live wire, Tony pressed the glass against his forehead and snapped, “What the fuck are you doing in my bedroom, Romanoff?”
Okay, good, well that was one obstacle taken care of. Continuing to rub Bruce’s back, Tony let his gaze land on Natasha and Clint. Those two, he knew, were going to be a little harder.
“But you still abandoned your mission to come save my ass.” Okay, shit. A little bit of the shame trickled in. Tony cast his eyes away from Steve to cover it.
“No,” Tony swore, vehemently enough that Steve turned back around. They locked eyes for a moment, and Steve slowly nodded. Bolstered by that, gathering what little he possessed in terms of team cheerleader, he continued, “We’ve got this. We do. Clint and Nat will come back, and we’ll figure out Hydra, and find Loki, and protect the goddamn world. It’s what we do.”
“No, I don’t. I’ve got you,” Steve said, and Tony stopped short, words falling right out of his head, as he stared at Steve’s fierce grin. Speechless, he fumbled his words, trying to think of something to say, when the HUD lit up again in scarlet.
“I gotta admit, you’ve got my curiously piqued,” Tony admitted as they walked to the elevator.
Steve only nodded, then set his jaw in that stubborn way of his, indicating that there was really no room for argument. Hating himself, Tony rose, bile rising to the back of his throat. Taking a few moments to adjust the gauntlet, to make damned sure that it wouldn’t fire at a force higher than what he wanted (he wished JARVIS was there,
“I’m holding you to that,” he said, as they turned to head to the workshop.
Wasn’t that why he had put on the suit to begin with? Not to fight gods, not to take on armies, but to help the ones who couldn’t defend themselves? Who the hell did he think he was? And now Happy, Happy, was unconscious in a hospital bed, because Tony had stepped out, had decided to let somebody else handle it.
Which was a problem for another time, he thought, once he was all dressed up and stepping into the common area to grab Natasha. She stood in the kitchen with the rest of the team, decked in a gorgeous black dress and a diamond bigger than his fist flashing at her neck. He idly wondered how much that had cost him when he caught sight of Steve, looking like he’d just stepped out of the shower, hair damp and framing his strong face. Tony’s mouth immediately went dry. Steve’s face was a little pink, likely flushed from the hot showers he loved to linger in, making those fierce blue eyes stand out. And he was barefoot, looking relaxed and happy, and
“Bruises and a few cuts, Steve,
“Well, trace the call and tell them to get here, pronto. I’ve got a feeling I’m in the same location as the Mandarin.”
Steve shook his head. “No. Natasha’s right, Clint. That wasn’t you. That’s not you fault.”
“Come on, come on, one more!” he shouted, zipping to Alex.
“——helpless princess or some shit, and I understand
He tinkered, making upgrade after upgrade.
“Are you two going to sleep the day away, or can I get somebody to help me with my boredom?” Clint complained, hours later. Startling, Tony lifted his head off Natasha’s shoulder, and blinked at him. The archer perched on the edge of the couch, frowning down at Natasha and Tony with his arms crossed.
“They’re gone,” Steve said hollowly, staring at the floor. “The whole base we’d discovered is just…gone. We can’t figure out where they went. The building was a burned and empty husk when we got there.”
Folding his arms, Tony jutted his head up and jerked out his chin, fully prepared to go to battle over it. Steve opened his mouth, the scowl on his face making it clear that he was about to argue, but then he snapped his mouth shut. Tony could practically see the gears turning in his head as they stared at each other.
“Maybe you should take a break,” Tony suggested, without really thinking.
She tilted her head, studying him. For the second time that night, Tony shifted uncomfortably under someone’s gaze. What the hell, were the other Avengers psychic or something? What was up with that?
He took one more second to get himself under control before responding,
“And what? You just let him go?” Clint sat up, then shoved off the couch to cross his arms and glared at Steve.
“You know I don’t need as much sleep as you.”
“How many times have we gotten lucky, Nat?” he asked, watching Stern head to the bar. “How much longer will we be able to keep pulling things off?”
“Yup,” Tony said, popping the ‘p’. “We’ve seriously got to overhaul your uniform. That suit does absolutely nothing for your ass, Cap.”
They were shut? his mind wondered, but he managed to pry them open at the request. A blurred figure of black and red sat in front of him, and all the lights in the room were blazing. Titling his head, he struggled to understand, and a small amount of air found its way into his lungs. Then, like a damn breaking, he was able to gasp, and get more of it in, inhaling so fast and desperately he turned dizzy.
“And then the shawarma after,” Thor promised.
“Stark is right.” Rising, Thor crossed over to all of them. Slowly, Bruce rose and walked over too, so they were all standing in a small circle. “If this is anyone’s fault, it is my own. Loki is my brother, and…”
“You…you really wanna know?” He’d been joking about talking Steve’s ear off, trying to distract him from his thoughts about Bucky. Hadn’t really thought Steve would be interested. No one ever really was, not even Rhodey or Bruce.
“No, that would be bad,” Bruce agreed.
“Eight hundred feet.”
gone, Tony tilted his head, and stretched again, his back cracking after leaning over the workshop table for so long. “Uh huh. Who needs me on the communal floor? If it’s Barton, tell him I’m sleeping. I’m still annoyed he made us watch
“Killian’s got Pepper, he’s got Trevor playing the Mandarin, and he’s got something big for tonight. Right now, he’s dealing with the Iron Patriot situation, or he’d already be here to force you to help him.”
“Well, since no one is even saying hi to me anyway,” Clint huffed, then squeezed Steve’s arm. “It’s really great to see you awake, Steve.”
“I would advise you not to do anything foolish, sir, but fear that would be a waste of time.”
Setting the kettle down, Bruce turned back to Tony, waiting quietly.
It took him a moment. Tony glanced down, not understanding at first, then glanced, snapping his eyes back to Steve’s. “No.
“Tony!” Trying to keep back a laugh, Steve shook his head. “At least get a plate.”
“Sir, you’re at eighteen thousand feet.”
“Because I’m the weakest link, right? Gotta save Tony. Can’t let him solve problems on his own.”
“It’s more than a few bruises,” Steve said quietly, handing Tony an ice pack.
“There’s something I need to tell all of you,” Steve said finally, turning away from the window to glance at them all. “Something I haven’t been honest about.”
“I”m not worried about the team, I’m worried about you!” Steve snapped, then shoved his hands in his hair. “Jesus, Tony. A man you thought was family tried to steal the reactor from you?”
“I’d be happy to provide you dinner, Stark,” Thor said, so earnestly that Tony couldn’t even mock him for it. Thor had been livid when he’d discovered Loki disappeared while he’d helped re-start Tony’s heart, but he’d calmed down when JARVIS asked for his help in getting Tony to the workshop.
Steve glared, but didn’t comment on his rudeness. “I wanted to ask Thor why Loki would do that. Why would he fight me for the scepter, then leave it with me?”
DUM-E chirped again, and Tony went to the bot, putting his hand on the strut to soothe him, even though his vision was red with rage. “Yeah, because I’m not a super solider or a super spy. Right? I’m the squishy human you all have gotta protect, keep out of harm’s way.”
“Stark,” Thor said again, completely unbothered by Tony’s anger. “Are you even aware of your injuries?”
“Yes, Mom,” Tony rolled his eyes and made another snatch at the bag. “I’ll take an hour for lunch, deal?”
Tony couldn’t help it, he laughed. As his companion blinked, the Senator’s face turned beet red, his teeth clenching. It only made Tony laugh harder. He’d barely had to say anything to the guy before Stern had cracked and started telling Tony off. This would be too easy. “Your constituents know you talk like that?”
“Mmm,” Bruce hummed, moving around. There was the rustling of equipment and Steve’s chart being moved.
Full disclosure, I have zero medical knowledge. So bear with me here, and have fun in the name of hurt/comfort!
Both wrists free, he stumbled forward, unused to not hanging by his arms yet. Steve gently caught him. Incredibly turned on (how did Steve manage to smell so good after being on a mission for several weeks? Tony wanted to bury his nose in his neck and breathe him in forever), and well aware it was not appropriate, Tony quickly shifted, so that Steve had no idea Tony was pathetically and inappropriately lusting over him.
Thor leaned forward, rested on hand on his knee. “Explain yourself, then, Captain.”
of suppressed feelings, thank you very much) and focus on making Steve smile that bright the entire time they were there. The next night, Tony convinced him to take a break from cooking, and they went out on the town, eating at Tony’s favorite Italian restaurant and going Christmas shopping for the team. Tony, naturally, hadn’t gotten a thing yet. Steve said he was almost finished with his gifts, but that he wanted to keep an eye out for something for Darcy. They wandered around, grabbing few things, and then headed back to the mansion to watch more of the movies on Steve’s list.
Goddammit, hadn’t he just gone through that? Hoping Steve could hang on tight enough, he lifted his arms and used his palms to keep them in the air, but the right repulsor went out, too.
“Pfffft. Nat won’t let you kick me out. Will you, Nat?”
“Uh. Sure.” When Bruce put his hand out, Tony clasped onto it, feeling immediately better holding onto Bruce’s warm hand. Human connection. That was…that was nice. Feeling Bruce’s pulse beat in time with his gave Tony the strength to stand completely on his own, though he didn’t let go of Bruce. Instead, he let himself revel in it for a moment. Then, when he realized that probably too much time had passed, he sent Bruce a wry smile. “You’re not going to make me tell you all my problems now, are you?”
Yeah, bringing him out here had been a great idea.
in my goddamn —“
about the day had been easy so far, of course the next words out of his mouth were: “We have a problem.”
in a dungeon. I’m free to go.”
“It can’t be anything weaponizable,” he said immediately, feeling slightly sick. His past never stopped coming back to haunt him, but that didn’t mean he needed to repeat his mistakes.
“Listen, erm,
“As the leading expert on doing shitting things and deserving to be blamed for them, I gotta say, they’re right. You aren’t to blame,” Tony said flatly, walking over to stand next to Natasha. “Loki messed with your head. You get no blame for that. And neither do you,” he said to Steve, turning to lock eyes with Spangles again. “Loki using your emotions and throwing them through the fucking blender isn’t your fault. None of us would have reacted well if he’d played a trick like that on us. Don’t beat yourself up over it, Cap.”
“But you recognized that. And stopped it as soon as you did.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s
“Thanks, Cap!” Tony called, getting himself together and charging again. He snatched up the shield before one of the damn Wrecking Crew guys or their minions could grab it, and turned to hurdle it back to Steve.
“Long enough to get annoying.”
“Revel,” Steve repeated, while Thor gently checked over Steve’s wounds. At Steve’s question, he reared back, tilting his head.
Feeling the eyes of those ancestors on him as he dashed around, Tony went straight to the bathroom, searching the medicine cabinet and under the sink, and cursed when it was empty and all he found was a near empty box of band-aids and expired Neosporin.
“What? No.
Steve stood up from the stool, and went the fridge, pulling out more ice packs, then walking back to Tony and Thor with an odd look on his face. Maybe the guy was constipated.
Right. He knew that. Nodding, gipping onto Steve’s shoulder, Tony managed to get his legs out from under him, though his right leg stung with pain and he nearly went back down. Huffing out a breath, he stood, looking back at the suit. Fuck, he was going to have to drag it along with them. No way he would leave it lying around if someone was after them. Who the hell had attacked his plane? Hydra? Leftovers of Killian’s little group — what were they called, what were…AIM. That could have been it. Nat had suggested Hydra might have given the Mandarin weapons at one point, maybe the two had bonded together in an effort to take him out. Made sense, really. A little revenge for one group, taking out a major player for the other, and…
“Let them deal with it,” Pepper said, and for a second Tony could only stare at her. “You just flew a
The world slowly tilted a little as he registered her words. “What’s a terrorist want with a botanist?”
He smiled, and gestured to Bruce. “Not to worry, Banner, I know you are less fond of ale and more fond of that lemon-cake tea Lady Natasha enjoys so thoroughly. I admit I enjoy the smell, it truly
Strong arms were suddenly around his waist and Steve’s mouth
“Fuck you, Stark.”
“It’s hard not to feel like the weakest link.”
“Yeah, okay, sure, but he is the squishy human who threw away his shield to help out a teammate entirely covered in armor. It was a bad call.”
His hands itched. He wanted to work.
“You hit your head pretty hard, huh?” Steve asked, blue eyes flicking up to search Tony’s face. “You with me, Shellhead?”
“That sounds like a tough way to live,” Steve said, frowning.
“Any word?” he asked, as Darcy took one look at the two of them and scampered off.
He really did try.
Completely ignoring him, Steve (who was supposed to still be in Prague, what the hell?) rushed over to Tony, looking him over, panic in his eyes and shield on his back. “Oh, thank God,” he said, closing his eyes briefly before snapping them back open to lock on Tony. “We’ve been looking everywhere, before you contacted JARVIS you were completely off our radar. Are you okay?”
Goddammit. He never should have opened his fucking mouth.
“Well, you better. Because you can’t be our leader if you can’t. And God knows no one else on this team can lead. Barton’s head would be bigger than Australia, and Thor would demand we bring him Pop Tarts all the time. Bruce and I would hide in our labs, and Nat would take over the world.”
Though that could be because he’d had nothing to eat since….dinner the night before? Those blueberries? Fuck it, when the hell had he eaten last? The room swayed and his stomach rumbled loudly at the thought, as if now that it knew it hadn’t been fed in ages, it wouldn’t be satisfied until Tony gave it something.
“Uh, I. Well, I…you don’t have to…”
Only Steve would take the time to check in on him in the middle of a mission. Burning in his eyes intensifying, Tony squeezed them shut tightly for a moment, wishing Steve could be there. God, how pathetic was he? Wishing Captain America was around to help solve his problems. But he knew that wasn’t it, not really. He didn’t want Cap. He wanted Steve. If Steve were there, he’d feel better. He always felt better after talking to Steve, by being near him. Something about they guy just radiated calmness, and strength. They could take on anything, he and Steve. Even if it was just as friends. Which was all they would ever be.
Their next official battle as Avengers happened later that week.
Then Jasper, then Mary, then Alex and Kit, despite Steve’s best attempts to grab Alex’s arm, to keep him in the plane. Steve, who clutched at the back of a chair, and was using his massive strength to keep himself from getting sucked out right along with them.
Okay, maybe he shouldn’t have opened his big mouth.
Thor reached an arm out, and halted Tony in place, keeping him from carrying out his plans. Then he looked at Steve and continued,  “Sir JARVIS lives in the ceiling. I was introduced when Stark collapsed. He told me what to do.”
“I am not.” Nor was he the
Cradling him close, Tony carried Steve back to the jet, as carefully as he would with precious glass or an infant. He wouldn’t risk hurting Steve.
“Natasha! Nat wait,” Clint yelled as she turned on her heel and strode from the room. Cursing, he threw one last look their way and took off after her.
“It’s okay. Well, no, it’s
” Tony sputtered.
Her answering smile made him think maybe they had a shot at this team thing after all.
Weeks later, Tony sat in yet another Department of Damage Control meeting, rubbing his hand over his face. Since he’d learned that there were Chitauri weapons being picked up throughout the city and sold in the blackmarket, he’d worked tirelessly with the DoDC to get them all back. Each and every one of them went into a locked vault at the Tower. Shield was kept far from it, to avoid any Hydra agents getting their hands on them.  It was working, or at least Tony thought it was, but keeping up with the weapons on top of strategizing with Thor in the mornings and Steve in the evenings was running him ragged.
“No one thinks that way, Tony, where is this even
“As you wish, sir,” JARVIS, the sass queen that he was, replied. Snorting, Tony rested his head against the elevator wall and tried not to wince. Thanks to the reactor going batshit, breathing was still a little difficult.
No, no. Best not to go there again. No one needed to relive that memory.
I LOOOOVE the plane scene in IM3 and had to shamelessly borrow it here. Watching the behind-the-scenes documentary on how they pulled it off is an endlessly nerdy thing I like to whenever I watch IM3.
“Upgrades. And then more upgrades. And I thought about making Darcy a new taser for her Christmas present.”
“If you’re right about the Hydra/AIM connection, I’ve not only kept them from getting my suits —which they would use in horrible ways — but stopped them from gaining Killian’s fire army. And I’m sure there were some of their moles in the WSC, when they issued the order to nuke New York. I stopped that from happening, as well, by nuking the mothership instead. Judging from the recent attack on the plane, they’re pretty pissed at me.”
you’re capable of taking care of yourself, Tony. You saved the entire planet, while the rest of us could only watch. Trust me. I know. But you can’t ask me…I couldn’t sit there and not
Hot, burning tears blurred his vision for just a moment. Then he blinked them away, fixed his gaze onto Steve, and said hoarsely, “I’m sorry.”
“—come charging back like some goddamned knight after a ——”
Tony’s lips twitched. “Yeah. Miraculously, it somehow is.”
He swallowed, feeling like he was swallowing glass. “Pepper.”
“Of course it is!” Tony announced, throwing a stern look at Steve over Thor’s shoulder. “Yeah, we’ll get all patched up, and then…revel.” And maybe he could get drunk enough he passed out for three days.
“It’s not a big deal, Tony, calm down.”
“I think there’s a gal in HR who’s trying to steal some printer ink, you should probably go over and zap her,” Tony said, and hung up, dropping his phone due to the tremors in his hands. Lightheaded, he slipped from his bench to the floor, gasping and shaking.
out of the plane,
Tony took off as Steve charged the front door, using the shield to deflect the rays that were instantly shot down at him. Noting where the shooters was, Tony aimed his repulsors, firing to give Steve cover. When he’d crashed through the front door, Tony grinned, and went to smash through an entrance of his own.
“I saved the city,” Tony grumbled though he snorted at the hair joke. “And this is the thanks I get?”
“About to kick your ass in chess,” he replied, moving his rook to take Tony’s bishop. “Check.”
It took longer then he would have preferred but finally,
When I said all that you’ve done, I wasn’t talking about who you were before Afghanistan,” Steve said, frowning. “I meant with creating the suits. The reactor. You’ve created incredible things.”
Steve’s jaw set further. “You still need checked over. If I have to, you have to.”
“Sure, that would be great, if he hadn’t taken the whole thing as a dare
“What? No, of course not, Nat, I would
Feeling an odd sense of deja vu, Tony tilted his head, and asked, “What’s the distance from New York to here?”
, Stark.”
Stern snarled. “You don’t know
Then Steve ripped the other zip tie off, and Tony got hard so fast he got a little dizzy.
“Good way not to die, though,” Nat responded, before looking away from all of them and walking out.
Not bothering to ask questions, Tony threw himself to the right as the man swung his arm out. Luckily, Tony was fast and managed to avoid the punch to the face. As a result, the unwelcome assailant slammed his fist into the wall, leaving a decent-sized hole.
, the way his mouth slotted over Tony’s, connecting them smoothly, brushing up together just close enough so that Tony felt Steve’s breath as he exhaled. Tony wanted to breathe him in, to take in all of the sexy, irresistible scent of Steve, and never let it go, never let the opportunity pass him by.
Her hair was all over her goddamn face, but she stopped screaming and nodded, her face determined despite the tears and terror as she clung to him for dear life.
“Yes, you do, you crazy, stubborn goddamn
“What?”
“Just like old times, huh?” Maya asked.
Tony was making pretty decent headway with the suits when he realized his eyes were so heavy he was about to fall right over. He was up to Mark 11, and was pretty proud of it. Sure, Pepper wasn’t thrilled with the amount of time he’d spent in the workshop, but the team had made sure he came up for air every once in a while, so really, there was nothing to be concerned about. He slept.
Tony flipped the screwdriver on the counter. “Not exactly a damsel in distress, Cap.”
“I won’t pretend to know what happened to you up there, Tony. Or what you went through in Afghanistan,” Bruce said, and Tony took a huge gulp of air and tried to focus on Banner’s glasses, and the way his hair was mussed like he hadn’t slept, and Bruce’s heartbeat, because focusing on his nightmares or what had happened in a cave years ago was a good way for him to slide back to the floor.
“Yeah, there’s a giant brain, a shifty character. I’m gonna follow this guy. I’m gonna run his plates, and if it gets rough, so be it.”
“You would do that?”
“I try,” Tony managed, wondering what the hell had just happened. Patting his shoulder, she strolled away as Thor bounded over.
Once upon a time, he would have taken the kiss as deep as he could have gotten away with, using his tongue and hands and teeth to make the lady weak in the knees. But this was Natasha, and she’d had his back and saved his ass a lot lately, so he only kept the kiss soft and sweet.
Jaw tightening, fingers clenching, Tony shook his head. “Uh, no Captain Tightass, I really don’t. Nothing is as important as being ready for the next mission.” Hadn’t he already had this conversation? Hadn’t he just gotten dumped by Pepper because of it?
“I”ve no idea sir.”
“Tony, you really need to stop calling Senator Stern an assclown,” Pepper reprimanded.
, Cap, you’re the one who won’t admit why he came back—”
“Of course, sir.”
He never wanted Steve hurt.
Steve was already shaking his head. “You know what? I think I really do. Merry Christmas, Tony. May I?” he asked, and Tony’s brain short-circuited.
Rolling her eyes again, Darcy let out a sight that dragged on for several seconds. “No one ever believes me when I say you’re the boring Avenger.”
Pepper’s face went blank. “I thought you were just a consultant.”
They had to get there soon. If they didn’t…
Scooting back so he could get up, she waited until he was steady on his feet before gracefully sauntering down the hallway. “Was beginning to wonder if we’d ever see you again,” she said casually, wandering into the kitchen.
But of course it wasn’t. It never would be.
Steve turned on his comm, turned to the building. “What’s the rundown, Lieutenant?”
Once in Malibu, Steve and Tony did indeed have a great few days of fun in the sun. Tony went to the merger meetings, just as he promised Pepper, who seemed to be doing well after the Mandarin fiasco, and happy to see him. Happy constantly buzzed around the two of them in the office, and since he was on crutches and often seemed tired, Tony didn’t get him any crap for being a stickler about badges. He also kept wisely silent as Happy constantly checked his phone — apparently someone had gotten along quite well with the Downton nurse. Though the whole company was still a little rattled at their CEO and Head of R&D being kidnapped, the office was filled with light and laughter due to the holidays being right around the corner. It made the merger meetings go over tremendously well, which had surprised him. He’d thought the holiday season would have added extra stress, but everyone seemed hopped up on sugar and good will. It made the ordeal much smoother than he’d thought.
“I don’t…” Tony began but stopped at the strangled noise that sounded behind him. Whirling, Tony turned at the same time Steve did to catch Clint looking like a fish on a hook, eyes wide and horrified.
“S’okay,” Steve gasped, so pale it was a wonder he was still speaking. “I’m okay.”
They were in the air and on their way to Malibu within hours.
“Incoming call, sir.” JARVIS said, and Tony snapped his head up.
“You know me well, buddy. I’m gonna stake the place out, get a feel for what they’ve got hatched. I’ve got a feeling it’s something big. Tell Natalie to move her ass.”
He stared at the guy and tilted his head. “Okay, that was almost too easy. What gives?”
“Well, I try,” Steve said drolly as Tony dug into the foil. “Are you going to eat that in the middle of the hallway?”
Clint scoffed, raising an eyebrow. “Are you kidding me?”
“Good. See that you do,” Tony said finally, voice showing more emotion than he meant. If something happened to Steve, if he got hurt trying to get back to them, and Tony wasn’t there to stop it…
Tony didn’t need JARVIS’s announcement to know it was Cap. Freedom and Old Spice were the first clues it wasn’t Bruce or Thor, and a very long sigh was the second.
Fuck.
“I….oh what the hell. Sure, Point Break, why not, I…Oh, Jesus,” he laughed, as Thor planted a big wet kiss on Tony’s cheek.
“Tony, what—”
Bruce’s eyes widened at that, and Tony patted his arm reassuringly. “She’s just joking, big guy, no worries.”
“Whatever you say, Tony.” Reaching into the bag, Steve pulled out two more burritos and opened one for himself. They ate in contented silence for a while, until Tony had had enough to make the rumblings in his stomach cease.
“I think it’s best if you got some sleep first,” Pepper replied, but she did lean forward and press her lips to Tony’s forehead. Leaning into her, he let her gently tug off his shirt, and didn’t comment on the way her eyes filled again at all his bruises and bandages. She didn’t say anything either, just guided him into bed, quickly changing into a pair of pajamas and curling around him.
“Are you calling my movies boring?”
“Is Hydra part of this?” he demanded. “Who made this call?”
“I wanna know what’s next,” Tony repeated. It was a chance to stall, but it also wasn’t a total lie. So he went with it. “Loki, the Chitauri, alien gods? What’s next, Fury? How are we going to be ready for it?”
Natasha, however, did no such thing. With a small nip, Nat bit his lip, startling him and making him laugh, before her lips crashed down again. Okay, point for Romanoff, she was one hell of a kisser. And it had been a while since anyone had touched him in such a way, and he found himself sinking into it a little more than he probably should have, with a little sigh. Wrong as it was, he couldn’t help but wish the hands in his hair and the soft lips devouring him belonged to someone else….
“I wasn’t, at first. But then…”
“I don’t think there’s any other way.”
Walking into the Triskelion made Tony’s shoulder blades itch.
“Got it, J. Heather? You hear me?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“He’s the one you made go stand on the balcony and wait for you on New Year’s Eve in Switzerland,” Pepper scolded. “Back in 2000? I don’t think he ever got over that.”
“It’s not my fault,” he told Pepper. “DUM-E needed a tune-up, and he’s a menace. Won’t sit still and let me tend to him at all.”
“Makes two of us,” Lifting his mug in salute, Tony tried to keep the pity out of his eyes. Jesus. Rogers had been a rather large pain in the ass since they’d met, but he couldn’t imagine what it was like dealing with the Chitauri and Loki and everyone you’d ever known being dead or ancient and not the same at all at the same time. That had to be a bitch.
Like hell. Tony was disappearing into the workshop until the next alien race came to conquer Earth.
Eyes widening, Steve dropped his hands and stepped back a little, as if Tony had told him off. “Right. Good.” Clearing his own throat, he avoided Tony’s eyes and said, “Want me to get you free?”
ALSO. It's Chapter 8 and we are just now acknowledging FEELINGS. Omg. My bad. (falls over because these two idiots in love are gonna be the death of me)
Nat rolled her eyes, and Tony figured that was that —- until she smirked, wrapped an arm around his neck, and pulled him close. Going with it, Tony laughed as their faces got closer and closer, then let Nat tilt his head just so until their lips were pressed together.
“I love you,” she said, and he nearly fell to his knees. Fuck, what was he doing, was this really happening? How had they gotten here, how had he fucked it all up?
(See the end of the chapter for
“What? Isn’t Bob at the helm?” Tony never went anywhere without his carefully vetted staff — Happy would have his neck if he dared to take on a new pilot or attendants with him clearing them first.
“Something up, Cap?” he asked, telling himself not to feel guilty for forgetting they were supposed to chat. He’d done what Steve wanted, hadn’t he? Actually gotten some god-damn sleep for a change.
“Well, he is the top spy. His secrets have secrets and whatnot,” Tony said, though he knew it was a useless comfort. “To be honest, I don’t truly think he is, either. But I have an astonishingly bad track record of trusting the wrong people, so…you know. Make your own call.” Shrugging, he gingerly stood up, and was happy the room didn’t spin.
“I crashed a plane into the arctic, and I’m alive. What if he made it, Tony? What if whatever Zola did to him let him live, and Loki was telling the truth? They never found the body.
“That is NOT what happened!”
“You’re the only one not featured on the Avengers page. Come on, Stark, people are starting to think it’s not legit.”
“It’s well past noon,” Natasha told him. Tony frowned. Well, fuck. That was a long time, wasn’t there something he was supposed to do today? Shit. He probably shouldn’t have slept that long.
“One thousand feet.”
“You’ve been a little preoccupied with Steve,” she reminded him. “Missed a team meeting. Or three. Again.”
And since he set her up so perfectly, Natasha popped out from behind the two goons, and quickly swung up and over the shoulders of the first one. Tony couldn’t blame him for the surprised grunt — he knew damn well if Natasha hadn’t given him a flashing glimpse of her red hair, hadn’t wanted him to know she was there, he never would have seen her, either.
And with that, he hurried out, trying to keep his eyes from burning, quickly scooting around the guys he had indeed planted on Happy’s door. A million thoughts whirled in his mind, all of them centered on one thing: find the Mandarin. It wouldn’t be too hard, either. The guy’s videos were something else. Mulling it over, Tony frowned while zipping down the halls. His name was an ancient Chinese war mantle, meaning "adviser to the King”. But the guy had South American insurgency tactics, and talked like a Baptist preacher. There was a lot of pageantry going on there...lots of theater.  Maybe all he had to do was make a dramatic gesture himself, a big enough call out, and the Mandarin would come right to him.
His face turned red, but Steve stood straight and said, “No. He used the scepter to make me sleep, and got away.”
, he thought, while he scuttled away, trying to tap the bracelets on his arms, praying he could get the suit to spring to action.
Firm fingers grabbed his chin and made him turn back to angry green eyes. “It was not a game. Thor and I wouldn’t play with feelings like that. It was more of an attempt to get the two of you to take a step in the right direction, you’ve been dancing around each other for months, Tony. And it’s Christmas, you deserve some happiness after the Mandarin and the plane incident. We were only trying to help.”
“Oh great. That’s not disturbing at all,” he said, setting down gently enough that Steve could jump down. Thor crashed to the ground next to him, not nearly as gently, crushing the asphalt and scowling at the building.
“You’re welcome,” Steve said. “I just…want to make sure you aren’t working too hard. I know you’ve got a hand in quite a few pies, Tony, and just wanted to say we appreciate it.”
“Uh,” he said, because he was eloquent like that. “Romanoff…”
“Steve. What happened to Barnes is not your fault. It’s not,” he repeated, when Steve made an agonized sound in the back of his throat and dropped onto the couch, head buried in his hands. Following him, Tony sat next to him, twisting so he could see Steve and say, “But you have to know that you might not always be able to control what happens to us. You might not be able to help one of us in time. And you’ll have to be able to live with that. And know it’s not your fault — we knew the deal and signed up anyway.”
“Lies!” Tony sputtered. “Slander! I’ll kick you out of the Tower, Cap, don’t think I won’t.”
Barking out a laugh, Tony strolled to the elevator. “Keep telling us all that, J. Just make sure to keep me listed as an ally when you take over the world, okay?”
“Without me?” Tony asked. Why did his teammates always do the fun shit without him?
“Oh.” Lips  turning in a frown, Steve moved his rook again and sighed. “Yeah, that’s been difficult. It’s hard to go back and forth all the time on whether Loki was lying or not. And then there’s Peggy. That isn’t easy, either.”
“Aye,” Thor grunted in agreement. “’Tis bad luck.”
He would know.
Tony waved a hand, wishing the tightness in his chest would leave. “Doesn’t matter.”
“You’ve worked to upgrade your suits since the Chitauri, but I bet you still got just as jostled as when we got hit by those weapons the first time. And a hit from Bulldozer was like a battering ram. Tell me you aren’t hiding injuries right now.”
Her lips curved. “Don’t pout, Stark. If you’re good, you get a cookie.”
Steve smiled. “I Love Lucy.”
Still completely absorbed in his work, Steve gave no indication of hearing Tony as he walked closer, until he suddenly shifted, looking right at him, and closed the holograms.
“Aye, I’m alright, Stark,” Thor confirmed. “But we need to get the captain to medical.”
She was so frazzled that her nails dug into Tony’s arm as she latched onto it, and Tony winced slightly, trying to extract her as he said, “Pep, hey, relax, of course I’ll help. Nat, I’ll be right back, okay? Go get me some cheesecake before Rhodey-bear eats it all.”
“Tony, he deserves to know how you feel.”
“They’ve been hidden for
“Then why did you come back?” Tony shouted, turning from DUM-E and throwing his own hands in the air. “If you really trust me to handle myself, why did you bail on your mission, and come all the way back? Nat could have handled, it, she and Thor and Bruce could have been just fine, but oh no, Captain America can’t trust Iron Man to get out of a scrape, so you gotta abandon what you were working on, and—”
They stumbled through, and Tony managed to get Steve to the bed on the side of the room and gently eased him down onto it. It was dusty, and old and without sheets, but in decent shape, so that when Tony stood back up to hurry and close the door he didn’t worry about Steve falling right through. The lights didn’t turn on, so he swore, grabbed a lantern, and quickly got it lit.
no, I don’t think so.”
“Yeah, me too. It wasn’t his fault,” Clint said pointedly, and Tony felt a small kick to his chair. Ignoring it, Tony continued to fake sleep, and was grateful for the act. It was his fault. If there was anything about this whole fucked up situation he was certain of, it was that. He’d taken Steve on the vacation, he’d let Steve on his compromised plane, he’d
“Actually, I…”
“As a matter of fact, they are not, sir. The Avengers are currently out trying to ascertain your location.”
“You guys alright?” he panted, scanning for the bomb. It took a bit of searching, but JARVIS found it in the corner, alone and unarmed. Oh thank God. That was one less concern to worry about. Zipping over to it, Tony secured it safely.
“All that you went through. All that you’ve done.”
“Hey,” Tony said softly, squeezing Steve’s hand. His heartbeat roared loudly in his ears, and he knew damn well it was because Steve’s hand was in his. His fingers were long and nimble, reminding Tony of a pianist, and the steady rhythm of Steve’s heartbeat had his own pitching a few beats faster.
, was all he could think, barely registering the bracelet being burned right off.
“Right,” Tony said, but he couldn’t take his eyes off Steve, who he had kissed, and who was so gorgeous and perfect it made Tony ache. Why couldn’t it have been real? If it was real, he could have told Steve he’d see him later, and gave him a saucy wink, indicating they could finish what they started. And Steve would laugh, and maybe blush, but he’d be happy, because it was
close now and he did not think they appreciated that, judging from all the screaming.
He was fucked. He was so, so fucked.
“Jesus, I forgot how mean you can be,” he complained, rubbing his side, digging his feet into Tony’s lap.
Okay, maybe there was some more helpful items in the kitchen.
“Do you…” Fuck, how did he put this? He thought of the guy with the cat in the Triskelion, and just couldn’t make it fit. “Romanoff, do you think that…”
“Pepper….”
“Tony?” Steve asked, wiping his brow. “What’s wrong?”
“Clint loved Firefly,” she explained when she saw his befuddled expression. “Moped for months when they cancelled it.”
“Hi,” Steve said to Tony. His voice seemed a little hoarse but Tony figured that was to be expected.
“I’m fine. I don’t need medical, Thor, it’ll heal in a few hours.” Steve said, wincing.
“You won’t regret it,” Tony promised, then immediately got to work. While Steve headed up to shower and get some food, Tony got JARVIS to figure out the details, and let Pepper know he and Steve would both be heading to Malibu soon. Figuring it would please her if he got there sooner rather than later, he had JARVIS schedule a flight plan for that evening.
Fuck.
“Fuck off, Barton, it’s my Tower, I’ll nap where I want,” Tony said, without any heat. But he budged over, allowing the archer to plop between them, his head in Natasha’s lap and his feet in Tony’s. That seemed obnoxiously rude, but since it was the first time Tony had seem him smiling since Loki had fucked with his head, he kept his complaints in and didn’t shove the bastard’s feet to the floor. He knew Clint had been working through what had happened with Nat and Bruce and a Shield therapist, and he felt a twinge of guilt for not being around to offer a shoulder as well. He could at least let the guy use him as a foot rest.
Tony’d found Maya as well, and while Killian was no longer around to answer for his crimes, she and Trevor Slattery would. It had to be enough, Tony told himself, while his body ached and groaned. They’d done well as a team, integrating Rhodey in seamlessly. That had to count for something. Plus, Happy had woken up, and was going to be allowed home soon. Really, everything ended about as well as he could have asked for.
“I’d kinda prefer to tell you about it when you don’t look like you’re about to fall asleep on your feet,” Steve said dryly, and Tony burst out laughing.
Lifting his head, Tony sent him a small smile, face warming even more. “Thanks, Steve.”
“All good now?”
“Let me go check the supplies, put pressure on that.” He wasn’t entirely sure what kind of cabin they’d stumbled into — it was a cross between an artist’s retreat and a throwback to the 80s. A dusty pile of cassette tapes were in a box in the corner, along with a stereo that would have kicked ass in 1989. Antlers covered with old, moldy cloth hung from the walls, and abstract works of art were placed here and there, interlaced with collages of photos from people from the 30s, like someone had created an homage to their ancestors.
“I’m not entirely sure. He said he’d tell me more tomorrow.”
“Something tells me the search has already been started,” Tony pointed out, and Steve blushed.
“Huh,” Tony snorted. He had to admit, he kinda liked the snarky side of Rogers. “All right then. I’ll try to get a few hours of sleep, then. Hold my calls, will you?”
“Think there’sss a cabin, up head,” Steve said, and Tony’s stomach turned to ice at the slur in his words.
Okay, he’d grovel for that later. “So that bastard wasn’t just after my suits for the government he was after them for
“I should get some fuel before I have to sit through another days’ worth of meetings, is what I should do. Come on. I want pancakes. And bacon. And eggs. And coffee. Lots and lots of coffee.”
“Whyyyyy? What did I do
It was tempting to turn and bolt back to the safety of the penthouse, where he could drown his miseries in booze and ice cream until he forgot all about the way Steve felt with his body pressed right up to Tony’s. Would have been far more preferable than actual going to the fucking gala at this point. But when Natasha gave him a small tug, he moved with her, out the door and to the elevator. Feeling like he’d been thrown around too much in the armor, Tony stared at the doors as they slid closed and wondered how the hell he was going to recover from this.
Staring out the window, he ignored the way the space and stars made his breathing pick up until he couldn’t handle it anymore. Then he grabbed the scotch, and turned. They might have a good lead on Hydra, but Loki was still out there. Tony needed more suits — with the team living in the Tower, dragging him out every so often, and everything else going on, he wasn’t as far along as he’d like. He still needed more. And there was an idea in his head, one that had been brewing for a while now, on how to call them to him quickly…
Sauntering in, Tony prepared to dramatically flop into the visitor’s chair when an orange ball of fur made him stop dead in the doorway.
Neither did Natasha.
“Thanks,” Steve said, smiling again. Then he turned back to Tony as Tony sat down in the new chair, and studied him with a thoughtful expression. “
Nothing. The place was practically useless.
Or that could be his bruised ribs from falling out of an alien portal. Either one.
“Actually.” Tony swerved on his heel, turned back to Steve. “It’s almost breakfast time. I need pancakes. You want pancakes?”
Probably he should have stayed the hell away. Not gone anywhere near Shield, or its headquarters. Clint and Nat were doing their thing, he needed to let sleeping dogs lie, and all that.
“Come on, Stark, it’s not that bad. We’ll always have Sinatra.”
“I don’t know, like 1,300 miles?”
Steve finally lifted his gaze from the floor. “What?”
“Yes, Mom.”
He’s not wrong, you really should get some sleep. But if it were me, and I were in your place? Nothing would move me, either, so I get it.”
“I…” Flabbergasted, Tony gaped at him. “What?”
“Unbearably, sir,” JARVIS said dryly, and Tony had to fight not to snort out loud.
“Sir? There’s been an incident.”
“Tony. Can you hear me?”
“She still have trouble remembering?” It wasn’t the first time Steve had mentioned he went to see Peggy. When he wasn’t looking for Loki or Bucky, or hunting down Hydra, he would often visit her. Tony’s heart broke for him every time he did. The pain in Steve’s eyes went so deep. Sometimes Tony wondered how he could stand it.
“No.” Steve shook his head, stepped forward. “Thank you for believing me about this. For helping me.”
Setting down his gloves and torch, and sighing, Tony said, “Christmas is over two months away, and you’re not getting near my robots, Darcy. Leave DUM-E alone. He’s a menace, but he’s my menace. And what the hell are you still doing in my workshop? Who let you in here?”
“And I could really use your help,” Steve interrupted, and Tony abruptly stopped speaking, because, what?
“Something had to happen to make you think Hydra’s still active.”
“You did good, Tony, I think that helped,” Bruce said, squeezing the arm Tony had around Steve. “We need to get him out of here, though. With Thor in New Mexico, I’m not sure how to get him into the Quinjet without causing more damage.”
Of course. Shit. They’d found nothing since Tony expanded the parameters of the search. Tony wasn’t sure what that meant. It could mean that Loki had been lying, like they’d thought all along, but something about it just didn’t sit right. “I’m sorry, Steve.”
“I”m okay,” he said as she launched herself at him, and somehow smothered the hiss of pain that exploded through his ribs as she hugged him tight. Sunshine and Chanel flooded his senses, and for the first time all night, he truly relaxed, despite the impending lecture he was sure to get, burying his face in Pepper’s hair. “I’m sorry I scared you. I’m fine, Pep.”
…ow!”
,” Tony hissed.
“These are the first ones?” He asked quietly, as if he thought the suits deserved reverence.
“Look, I’m sorry, Cap, but you’ve got to be overreacting. There’s just no way. Not with Fury in charge, he’s on the level. It was a joke, or something. Right, Nat? Nat?”
Warmth curled through him, like he’d just stepped into the sun after a week in the workshop. “You’re welcome.”
But despite her warnings, and pleased as he was at the fact that they had made progress, Tony couldn’t help but grow frustrated at the fact that they weren’t getting close to outing Hydra yet.
Tony tended to agree — it was a scenario that still gave him nightmares occasionally. Obie’s domineering frame, towering over him, stealing the reactor while Tony struggled to move, to breathe. Not exactly a great night. But he didn’t like the way Steve’s eyes were pinched, so he tapped his fingers against the reactor and forced his voice to stay light. “It’s alright, Cap. I’m clearly still alive and kicking. Luckily, Pepper is a smartass, and DUM-E is the best boy when he’s not dousing me with a fire extinguisher, and I managed to stay alive until Rhodey got to me. Then I kicked Obie’s ass.”
