“He’ll make my arrest public.” Steve agreed, “He’ll paint me out to be a monster to the streets of Brooklyn. He’ll be the saviour to my reign of terror.”
Tony sat back for a moment to appreciate the view, Steve spread out underneath him, white dress shirt rumpled and rising up to show off a section of his stomach. All that corded muscle and strength completely at Tony’s mercy like a well-oiled car engine tuned to his administrations. And Steve thought Tony was the gorgeous one.
“And I’m doing this for you to protect you!” Tony shouted in an explosion of emotion that seemed to come from nowhere, “Because I love you!”
Steve chuckled, “Will you, Tony Stark, with all your endearing sass and bedroom eyes, do me the honour of accompanying a no-good scoundrel like me to this gala as my date for the evening?”
The line went dead and Steve was almost thankful Bucky had let the subject drop. Steve wasn’t sure he could deal with the breadth of his feelings for Tony in his own mind, let alone telling Bucky about them. Steve worked best when he was able to push those thoughts aside and get on with the task at hand.
“Actually no.” Tony paused, “You don’t need me to get Steve out. I’ve done my bit. I need to go see my father.”
When they pulled apart they were both panting and Tony was throwing his crop top over his head with a flick of his hands, miles of tanned warm skin within Steve’s reach. His mouth was practically watering at the thought.
Steve couldn’t take his eyes off Bucky, the hurt and confusion and anger flickering through his eyes. He’d always had expressive eyes, Steve could read them and automatically know what Bucky was thinking, it was a short hand that came in handy over in Afghanistan. Now, it served to mock him.
A few more thrusts and Steve was coming as well, releasing into the condom as he was buried to the hilt in Tony as his orgasm racked his body with a flood of pleasure and Tony’s name from his lips. He buried his face into Tony’s neck, feeling his arms wrap more securely around his frame as Steve shuddered in pure ecstasy.
“I see you got my little gift.” Rumlow greeted as Steve walked into the room, gun held aloft and trained on his forehead, “Seemed only fitting I return him to you. Your family does have a habit of poking their fingers into my business.”
“He hired you again, didn’t he?” Bruce replied, “He doesn’t do that, ever. Never uses the same person twice. He doesn’t like people poking around that he doesn’t trust. This is your second time here, clearly he likes you.”
Tony nodded, that made sense. That was what Steve had wanted them to do. It was weird to watch them without a leader. Without a direction. They were still formidable but there was something missing. A sort of glue that held them firmly together. They were all just drifting in the same stream right now, it was almost heart breaking to watch as a family fell apart over losing one of their own and desperately tried to hold it together. Tony was a part of this family now, he realised. Not just because Steve had brought him in, and they had made a vote. Not because Natasha had come for him earlier. But because he too was feeling that same sense of drifting without Steve that the rest of them were. There were all united in that at least, and that for now would be enough.
Steve did as instructed, arms coming up around her as he sank into her, "This is going to be the fight of our lives."
The Mechanic smirked, “Well, I am a genius. Don’t look so surprised.” He bent down to pick up Steve’s knife, twirling it around his fingers as he walked over to Steve. Tony offered it to him handle up with a soft smile and those deep brown eyes that Steve knew would be on his mind of days.
“Tony, fuck.” Steve bit down on Tony’s shoulder, seeing spots in his vision as his pleasure teased him.
Tony went willingly, hands curling around Steve’s neck. Steve kissed him again, softly and sweetly. They needed a shower; He could feel the mess he’d made of Tony’s thighs on his arm and the stickiness of their skin wasn’t helping.
Fury pressed the photo closer to him, “This is PC Bennett. A good man, wife and two kids at home, been on the force for five years now. He was murdered this morning.”
Then his father sighed, relaxing back into his chair, “Fine. You win, I’ll come forward as a witness but you need to back me up and tell them I knew nothing about what Rumlow was planning to do with the weapons and as soon as I found out I did the right thing by coming forward.”
“No,” Steve responded, “Sometimes I think I do. When Phillips recruited me for the gang, I was fresh out of Afghanistan and he said he thought I needed a war to survive. Maybe he was right, I don’t know. The army gave me a lot, but it took a lot as well. Everything I was, I left it in the desert.”
Somehow Steve didn’t think killing this new guy would be as easy as killing Sitwell. That thought alone had him clenching his jaw and balling his hands into fists from inside his pockets.
Being with Tony like this, it felt right. Even when the whole world was collapsing around his ears and threatening to choke him. Even when everyone in Brooklyn wanted to see him fall. This moment with Tony, any moment with Tony was worth clinging to.
Fury exhaled sharply, “Jesus. I knew he was obsessed with bringing you in, but I thought that was job dedication. I didn’t think he’d ever be one to double dip his hat. Ross always seemed straight as an arrow.”
Steve revelled in moments like this. They were so few and far between that he always tried to take a moment to allow himself to enjoy the time with his family. They were all tightly packed into the living room of their house, the room warm and cosy thanks to the number of bodies in it. Movie nights were something of a tradition for The Avengers, or they used to be, Steve couldn’t actually remember the last time they had found the time to have one.
Bucky shook his head, “Steve wouldn’t want you going alone, so you’re not going alone. Nat, text Thor and Sam for backup here. We’ll see you back at the house with Steve.”
Clint shook his head with a smile, “And then we cut his shirt open and carved our tag into his skin? That’s a dumb move for someone trying to cover up a murder.”
Bucky chuckled, “Is that an order? Are you giving me orders now?” He shook his head with a smile, “Damn, Steve. I almost feel sorry for you. You’ve got a spitfire here.”
“Perfect timing actually,” Tony replied, “Just about done here. What do you think? I experimented with a new metal we have in at the shop to help enforce the dented patch, knocked the bodywork right out again. I had trouble matching the shade, that’s the issue with vintage cars. Always a nightmare to find the right stuff.”
He nipped at Steve’s lip and Steve actually groaned, pulling Tony in further as one of his hands slid up to cup Tony’s cheek, flicking his tongue out in response.
Everyone was waiting for them when they entered the living room, a sea of faces with mixed emotions. Steve fought the urge to grab Tony’s hand for comfort although he did glance back to the mechanic in a moment of reassurance. It was a silent exchange, offering Tony one final chance to decide he wasn’t ready to sign up for this. For Steve’s life.
“Perhaps but now I know you’re involved with The Captain I think there is another role you can play in our organisation.” Rumlow sneered.
“Steve.” Tony got out, panting his name as he thrust his hips against the edge of the desk, “I’m ready.”
Tony kissed him softly, silencing any part of Steve that might have protested. Just tonight. Just this. He needed this. Before everything fell down around them and he had to bring another heap of worry to his family. This last good thing before the storm.
Fury had pulled him back into reality with a harsh, “And a haircut wouldn’t kill you, Rogers. New job, new start and all that. It’d probably be easier on you if my cops could separate you from The Captain in their minds.”
Tony clenched his jaw, eyes meeting Bucky’s with a fierce determination, “Let’s just get Steve out, okay? We can’t defeat Hydra without him.”
Steve beamed, unable to help himself, eyes turning to Natasha where she was perched on the chair of Thor’s chair, “Nat?”
They couldn’t run, it was a dead end. They couldn’t fight an entire police force either. This was judgement day and Ross was wielding the knife.
Picking Thor would have been a smart choice if it wasn’t also the most obvious. Everyone went for Thor first. He was the biggest – aside from Steve himself, but no one went after The Captain whilst his team were around him because that was suicide – and he was the deadliest. Steve had seen that hammer separate skull from brain matter. He had seen Thor cleave skin from bone without breaking a sweat. Thor was the natural choice, but that was where everyone went wrong.
Steve nodded, “Sam, two whiskies on my tab when you’re ready please.” He shouted at his friend who was mixing another order. Sam raised an eyebrow at him, eyes on Tony for a moment.
It was late when he finally made it up to Tony’s door, far too late for this to be considered a social visit. It was nearly morning and Steve almost felt guilty about just turning up out of the blue. Perhaps he should have at least called Tony first before showing up like a lost puppy at his door.
Bucky frowned, stepping closer to Steve then, “You like him, don’t you?” His voice was soft, but the accusation was there. That undertone that cut into Steve’s skin to mock him for being an idiot.
Tony threw a hand towards his bedside table, “Top drawer, with the condoms.” He answered with a roll of his hips.
He needed to see him, to help him. Tony must be freaking out, he’d be scared. Had Fury left him alone to get Steve, he shouldn’t have left him alone. Tony wasn’t built to kill, not like Steve. Steve had been given a gun and told to go to war. He had trained his body to be comfortable with the act of taking a life. He understood it on its most basic level, kill or be killed. He had adapted to it. Tony hadn’t signed up for that. Tony was good and thoughtful and cared so deeply. This would destroy him.
Steve looked at him, blue eyes meeting brown. He wasn’t sure what he saw there, something wild and fierce but it was enough not to talk Tony out of it.
He smiled as Tony blanched at him, taking in his new appearance with eager eyes and a coy smile. Steve was clean shaven, his sharp jawline visible and his lips looking fuller than before. He had also got Natasha to cut his hair back to the way he used to wear it in the army, shorter and stylish. In the summer, the sun would warm the ends and it would look blonder too. Tony was still staring at him.
Bucky tried to nod but his head rolled back instead. Clint came running in, handing Bruce the hot poker, glowing an angry orange from the heat. Bucky looked at it with wide eyes. Then he looked back at Steve, “You kill him for this, okay? You cut off his head and let his body rot in the ocean. Promise me, Steve.”
“He’s growing on me.” Tony conceded, fingers stroking down Steve’s leg, “I came by to pick up the paperwork for SI that I left here yesterday. I couldn’t find it downstairs. Pepper will curse my existence if I show up tomorrow unprepared.”
“I’m not. Rumlow started it the moment he decided to make bombs in my city.” Steve replied, shrugging out of his leather jacket, “Let’s get you home.”
He was used to living in the spotlight since before he could even talk, so he didn’t care anymore about what the press had to say about him anymore. He deserved it anyway.
He didn’t know what he would have done if Rhodey hadn’t come back to apologize, because it was Pepper’s turn to leave him. She too had realized how much she cared about Tony, only it wasn’t in a platonic way. She didn’t believe him when he tried to explain to her that it wasn’t her, he just didn’t like girls that way. She chose to believe his false reputation as a playboy rather than him.
While the world was mourning the lost of the great Howard Stark, Tony was alone getting drunk of his ass. He didn’t show up at the funeral.
Pepper came into his life one night, when he thought he the only one left in the office. It took two years to convince her to become his personal assistant, but he eventually succeeded. He now had two friends and a family made of his bots. Even tough he wasn’t happy, it was more than he could ever had asked for.
The first time his father looked at him for more than a few seconds, he was ten years old and he had just gotten his soulmark. He loved his soulmark, he thought it was beautiful. But he only loved it for about two hours. He hated his soulmark, he thought it was ugly and wished he had never gotten it. But Captain America shield was on his skin no matter how much he wanted it gone. There was no way to remove. It. He knew because his father had tried them all. Removing the skin on top of the mark, pouring acid on it, burning it, making it freezes, having it covered with black ink, no matter what his father inflicted upon him, his mark was there to stay. He didn’t want the only person to love him unconditionally to be dead. But as his father told him, he deserved it.
Heading down to his workshop, he asked JARVIS to load all the information that shield had about Steve’s soulmark and Sergeant Barnes.
He lost all motivation to do anything after that. He spent his whole days in bed, not eating, but not drinking either. He still went out on Avengers business, but got injured a lot more in fight, due to his slower reflex. He didn’t go to the infirmary with the rest of the team afterwards and if any of them noticed how he had stopped talking and commenting everything over the com during the fights, they were probably grateful for it.
He thought he saw a little green spark before losing consciousness, but he didn’t have any time to react before the darkness was taking over.
He graduated with the highest honour possible the same year as Rhodey. But his friend knew him to well to ask him why his family wasn't there. At least he had been able to sneak Dummy in, one of his school project, a learning AI.
He was just shy of his twenties when he learned of his parents death in a car crash. Not that anybody had tried to call him to tell him. He learned it through the news like everybody.
And after that, Loki managed to get the whole story of the ‘Civil War’ out of Tony. He in turn told him how when he had left Tony a month ago, how he couldn’t bring himself to ally himself with anybody else, how he did nothing but think about Tony, and was about to come back to the the tower when he felt Tony’s mind calling him. When he had teleported next to him, Tony was already falling asleep and he had just barely managed to heal him before it was too late.
It didn’t change much in their relationship, and Tony was grateful for that. After all, what they were planning could mean the survival of half of all living creature. He couldn’t afford a distraction right know.
Before going in the wormhole with the nuke, he thought about telling Steve. Instead, he recorded a message that JARVIS would give to Steve. Because he was sure Steve would figure out who he was even if he died before telling him.
“I’m not nearly drunk enough for this.” Perfectly knowing that it was a bad idea, he lowered his gauntlet, and walked towards the mini-bar he kept in his workshop.  After all, he doubted he could do anything about it if Loki decided to attack him. “Aren’t you supposed to be in Asgard, like locked in a dungeon for eternity?” Asked Tony while pouring another drink for his ‘guest’ and refilling his glass.
“Aren’t you the one who gave Thor that data about me being brainwashed?” Curiously asked Loki, while taking the whiskey glass he was handed.
“Trust me,I know it’s hard to keep moving forward sometimes, but still, there must be something, someone for who it’s worth to keep moving forward.” Tony tried his best to not let his panic show in his voice.
He created JARVIS, so he could have a friend that would not leave him. Just how pathetic was he that he had to build his friends himself? Dummy also got two new friends, U and Butterfingers. They helped Tony in his workshop, but neither of them were even close to JARVIS level. Tony loved them all the same.
When Loki came back, they slowly started to plan for the upcoming battle against Thanos. They first localized all the infinity stones that were on heart, and then tried their best to contact their owners.
One week later, Tony told Loki about his soulmate, and asked Loki what he could possibly see in him when even his soulmate didn’t have any affection for him. Loki reassured him by telling him how Odin had managed to wipe his soulmark off of him, without ever allowing Loki to see it.
He continued to design weapons for Obie, and didn’t care about what they did as long as they brought money into his bank account. Even when he had more money than someone could spend in a lifetime, he didn’t stop. He continued to make his weapons stronger, deadlier, because Rhodey approved of that. And Tony would do anything to get Rhodey to approve of him.
It took him twelve years to fall out of love for Rhodey. Not that his friend ever noticed it in the first place.
Tony of course tried to stop drinking, he didn’t want to find himself alone all over again, but years of bad habit and heavy drinking were hard to change overnight. When one week later, Loki didn’t show up as he usually did in the planning room, Tony wasn’t surprised. After all, all his life he had done nothing but drive people away. He was a fool for thinking it would be any different with Loki.
Tony smiled, grateful for his little family he had found.  “Yeah, Pep. ‘Course.”  He waved goodbye and headed towards his room.  He had never felt old before, but the ache in his chest made him feel like he had aged ten years within the month.   He found Peter waiting outside his room, holding a small box in his hands.  “What’s this?”
Tony finally let the tears fall.  “I’m sorry, Petey.  I’m so sorry,” he said wetly, pressing his eyes harshly.  “I’ll be home soon.  I’ll sort this out.”
Ross’ face grew red as he spluttered.  Tony didn’t even glance at him as he pushed Scott out of the office.
“It’s already noon, Peter,” Pepper said, amused. “You both are already late for our lunch together.”
He grunted, shoving the chest plate off and working himself out of the armor and into the frigid air.  He grappled for his cell in his pocket, thanking his lucky stars he had taken it just in case, it was always just in case—
He pulled it out, admiring it.  One side said in massive letters “Best Dad Ever!” and the other side had a picture of the two of them at Christmas last year, grinning over Peter’s brand new Star Wars Lego set.
Moments later, the space ship started its ascent upward, shining out two beams of light.  One was obviously for the thug, which Tony deftly avoided.  The other, meant for Strange and Maw, had picked up Peter as extra.
Between one breath and the next, Tony had already flung the shield into the wall of their pictures.  All the happy memories their little family had experienced.
Tony chuckled without any mirth, spurring on a coughing fit that sent pain stabbing through his chest.  He felt spittle hit his lips and wiped it off without looking.  “I’m fine, Peter.  I’ll be home soon enough.  The jet’s already on its way.”
“What I’m trying to say, Stark, is that it’s necessary to have support after going through the stuff we go through.  Let your friends support you.”
Tony turned, not sure what to expect.  In his son’s hands was a framed picture of the two at his first science fair, where Peter had been the youngest student to win first place in the school’s history.  Tony had been beaming with pride. Steve had snapped a picture of Tony kneeling next to the table with Peter’s small robotic arm and listening intently as Peter gave his presentation.
The throbbing pain behind Tony’s eyes only got worse as the council started arguing over the Raft and its uses.  Secretary Ross was being the loudest in favor of keeping the prison operating and used, citing that it was the only facility currently made for housing enhanced individuals.  He had maybe three other nations on his side while the rest had sided with Tony.  He, along with the majority of the council, argued that it was inhumane to hold people there in a facility so isolated and didn’t allow the basic human rights that the inmates deserved.
“Thanks, Fri.”  He let out a shaky breath and made for the kitchen, mind itching for something to occupy it.  He was halfway through pouring a glass of whiskey before coming back to himself.
Tony sighed.  “It’s not stupid to still love someone after they’ve hurt you.  That just shows you’re a good person.”
He woke up with crusty eyes and a dry mouth.  “This is why I never take naps,” he mumbled to himself, rubbing his face.  It was already dark out.  He grimaced at the thought of Peter spending the last couple of days alone without him to lean on.  Standing to head to the bathroom, he caught sight of the disk propped against the desk.
Tony didn’t speak for a while, catching his breath and covering his eyes as if that could stop the constant burning there. “He won’t be coming back with me, Pete.”
A door slammed in his face, a slap on the cheek, an angry lecture, anything other than the solemn stare and the tired beckoning for him to come inside.
Tony took it upon himself to start talking at Nebula, anything to fill the cold silence and ignore the black void outside.  A bright birthing of stars was in the view of the cockpit windows, but it still reminded him a little too much of that wormhole in New York.
They were sitting at the table in the middle of the lower deck.  He was trying to teach her paper football to pass some time while Dear Mr. Fantasy played in the background.  He flicked his paper football at her, hiding a grin when she lifted her fists in a fight stance.
Tony wasn’t sure anymore what they were arguing about.  He and Peter rarely got into fights, but when they did, they were explosive.
“Yeah,” Tony smiled.  He cranked harder on the water system’s valve.  It was being stubborn.  “Steve and I adopted him when he was 4.  His parents died in an accident and his only surviving relative, his aunt, was working full time and couldn’t support him.”  He stopped to set the wrench down, rubbing at the arc reactor.  He was getting weaker over time trying to fight the infection and survive off minimal food.  Nebula stayed quiet.  “Just the other week, he was telling me about one of his best friends, MJ, and how he liked her but didn’t know what to do about it.  And I stood there, like a fool, because my son?  Having a crush on someone and thinking of asking her out?  That was the first time I ever looked at him and saw him growing up.”
These questions continued to pop up, even more so on that Independence Day.  The media was flooded with philosophical debates on who was right in the Avenger’s Civil War.  Tony knew the answer, but kept his mouth locked shut with wires and sharp teeth.  The dirty secret he harbored in his body would never see the light of day if he could help it.
Tony stared at the mug in his hands, grinning from ear to ear.  He was never going to use another mug again in his life.
Peter let out a sigh and collapsed on his bed.  “I just…I won’t pretend to understand why you made the decisions you did. But, I just, I just
“Merry Christmas, Pete.  God, it’s so good to hear you—,” he cut off with a wet, shuddery exhale.  Peter stayed silent as the sounds of crying filtered over the phone.  “I miss you so much,” Steve whispered.
There was silence.  “We’ll talk about it later, then.”  Another pause.  “Peter’s been worried sick.  You should call him, Tony.”
As much as the engineering work and the looming threat of a slow death kept his mind busy, his thoughts still always cycled back to Peter.  Tony slept poorly that night.
“When we were your age, I promised him I’d stay by his side till the end of the line.  I let him down when I couldn’t save him during the war, and this is my chance to make it up to him.”
The man shut the phone with a clack, rubbing a hand against his beard.  He flipped it open again, staring at the name before shutting it.
, as his clenched fingers crumpled the paper.  He squeezed his eyes shut against the burn.  Tony Stark was not a crier and he wasn’t going to start now.  He sucked in a harsh breath and turned over the box, watching an archaic phone tumble out.  He flipped it open, frowning at the screen that listed a name and number he would never call.
“Hey, Pete!  So, I have an event I have to attend tonight.  I won’t be home till late, so I wanted to tell you if you wanted to have Ned over, that’s fine—“
“Thanks for coming over,” Tony said, dumping some plates in the sink.  “Peter had a lot of fun today.”
Tony pulled himself together and followed.  He knew now that Peter hadn’t truly meant what he said, but he would never be able to get it out of his mind.  That maybe Peter should have gone with Steve.  But then Peter wouldn’t be safe and wouldn’t have a shot at living a normal life.
You’ve put up with my weird antics, supported me being Spider-Man, and have stayed with me throughout this whole mess and I wouldn’t trade that for anything, Dad.”  He turned around, tugging at his hair.
Tony finally took in the dark circles under Peter’s eyes and the frumpy clothing.  “How long has it been since you slept, Pete?” he asked, rubbing his thumb on his son’s cheek.
“It’s not that easy.  God, we haven’t caught up in a spell, have we?” Tony looked at Bruce and saw the confusion.  “Steve and I broke up.  The Avengers split.”
He fingered his ring again, twisting it round and round as he mentally debated with himself.  Should he take it of after what he did to him?  Or leave it on in hopes that he would come back and apologize and try to make things right?
Squeezing his eyes, he gripped the wedding band on his hand and yanked it off.  Steve wasn’t coming back.  He had made his decision clear: he was choosing Barnes.  Tony had no reason to bind himself to the man that had shattered his heart.  He lived with the constant reminder of that day in the form of a hole in his chest.  He didn’t need this weight on his finger to drag him down farther.
The boy huffed a laugh.  “That doesn’t surprise me.  Dum-E is as sentimental as they come.  What did I call it, again?”
Tony laughed.  “Yeah, of course.  Just ask your mom to give me a call and I’ll be happy to help.  Knowledge is power, kids.”
Tony’s smile didn’t fade as he made breakfast and poured two large cups of coffee.  Peter eventually meandered to the kitchen table and inhaled about half the cup before starting in on the pancakes and eggs.  Tony sat across from him with his own meal, taking a bite before mentioning, “Don’t forget that Pep, Rhodey, Happy, and May are coming by today around 2.  We’ll open gifts then if that’s okay?”
Peter hung up and resisted the urge to chuck the phone across the room.  Instead, he slammed it into the drawer of his desk and stomped out into the hallway. He found Tony in the kitchen, scratching his head at a recipe on the counter.
He lifted his face, grinning at the sight of Tony’s warm eyes and soft smile.  “Thank you, Tony.  Really.  This means the world to me.”
Not even a minute later, the archer was back.  “Come on,” he said, walking towards the large barn that housed the tractor.
Another time had been when Peter was turning 11.  Tony had been lassoed into an emergency Stark Industries meeting concerning the Battle of New York.  Since the company was handling a large portion of reconstructing New York, Tony was obligated to go.  He hadn’t gotten home until after dark.  He had found Steve holding Peter on the couch, both fast asleep.  Peter had tried to stay up until Tony got home, so they could all celebrate together, but had drifted off sometime after dinner.
Contrary to popular belief, Tony was surprisingly good at cooking and baking.  He hid it for as long as he could when he joined the Avengers, wanting to avoid having to cook for the entire team when they came over for movie night.  His secret had been outted a year into the team being formed, when he cooked himself some lasagna at 3 in the morning and Clint had walked in.  The archer caught sight of him in an apron, grinned, and ran out of the room shouting, “Tony can cook!  Tony can cook real food!”
Tony grabbed his hand and squeezed.  “I know.  Being away from your kid is the hardest thing in the world.”  He turned around, glancing at the door.  “I have a surprise waiting for you after you sign.”
After washing the dishes and cleaning the kitchen, Tony found himself on the couch.  He pulled out the burner phone from his pocket countless times, staring at it and debating making the call.  Or even sending a text.  A simple happy birthday.
Peter was sat on the couch with Friends reruns playing on the TV.  He glanced over the back of it at Tony, eyes sad and dark circles heavy.
Tony shook his head.  “That doesn’t even make scientific sense.”  He looked at Peter, who was grinning at Mantis jumping up and down slowly a bit always. “At least we have one advantage.  He’s coming to us.  We’ll have to make a plan and use that to our advantage.”  He started to hash out a plan with Quill before being interrupted.
When he woke up again, he was laying in a comfortable bed, in a small room he didn’t know. He slowly remembered the last events, and wondered if he had hallucinated the part with Loki.
He got his answer when he spotted Loki sleeping in a chair in the corner of the room, a book still open in his hands. He tried to stand up without waking Loki, but as soon has he put his feet on the floor, Loki woke up.
He woke up seconds later, and the first thing he saw upon opening his eyes was the worried face of Loki over his.
He would also sometimes disappear for days on end without telling Tony beforehand, and wouldn’t tell him where he was when he came back. Tony suspected that Loki had a soulmate, or at least a significant other he liked to visit.
He understood when he was four that he would never be enough for his parents, that he would never be loved by them, no matter how much he tried. But that didn’t stop him from trying. He learned Italian by reading books so that his mother would have someone to practice her mother thong with. He builded circuits board so that his father would see he wasn’t useless.
But then, there was a boy that started to talk with him and hang out with him. Tony tried to drive him away, but no matter what, Rhodey came back. For the fist time in his life, Tony wasn’t alone. It didn’t take long for Tony to fall in love with him even tough he knew Rhodes was a straight as they come. And Rhodey still had her soulmate waiting for him. So he just created another mask to hide how hurt he was each time Rhodey presented him his new girlfriend. He deserved it.
“Anthony, stay awake, you better not fall asleep now, come on Anthony.” Was the first thing he heard.
The only thing he regretted was that he wouldn’t get to see Loki anymore. He only realized then of how deep he had fallen in love with him. He would give anything to just catch a glimpse of his smile again. Not his false and sharp grin, the one he liked to flash to scare his opponents, his real smile, so rare that Tony had only seen it twice. Or to hear his laugh, or to see his face, or even just to feel his hand in his.
Surprisingly enough, he got along pretty well with Loki. They were pretty similar and they didn’t get offended by each other snarky comments. They both used it as a defence mechanics when each others questions got too personal.
“Okay, so you escaped and you just thought you would come and visit me, your enemy, while a whole city of gods are looking for you?” Said Tony, while pouring himself another glass.
Loki also didn’t question Tony’s quirks, like when he wouldn’t take anything that Loki handed him. That meant a lot for Tony, because it was the first time he didn’t feel the need to invent fake reasons for all his ‘eccentricity’.
So when people gave him pill that made him forget everything, he took them. It didn’t matter that he didn’t remember what those people did to him while he was under the influence, it didn’t matter that he woke up with bruises in place he didn’t want them, because he had deserved it. And if one time he took to many pills not exactly by accidents, there was nobody there to notice except the doctors at the hospital. Even them were quick enough to accept money from his father to bury the story to do anything about helping him. He didn’t deserve to be helped.
“What if I don’t want to fly, what if i would rather just fall?” Steve answered, with a tone too serious to be joking.
He continued to party every night, got used to wake up every morning with a hangover. Anything to make him forget. Even though he didn’t deserve to forget.
They slowly made their way towards a living room, which would be spacious enough to hold the entire Avenger team in it. They sat in a big sofa, but at opposite end so that they weren’t touching.
Realizing what they could become, the potential that they had if they stuck together, he invited all of them to live in his tower. He never for once thought that he would be the only one left out of the family they would become.
“Shit,” Tony muttered, feeling the suit start encasing him.  “Sorry, guys.  Fatherly duty calls.”  The board didn’t look too upset, most having children of their own and knowing the sense of panic when the school calls about something.
“And it may be his best chance against us,” Tony shot back, jabbing a finger in his direction.  “What is your job, exactly?  Besides barging in on runs with my best friend and making sparkles?”
By 8 o’clock, they had all piled on the couch and chairs around the huge TV with cake and ice cream.  Peter had requested only classic sci-fi films, with the Matrix being the first.
Steve didn’t even glance over his shoulder before dropping the disk to the ground.  The clang of the vibranium tore through Tony like a sword, finishing the job the shield had started mere seconds ago.  The pain was worse than when his heart was cleaved open.  The glass and metal shards scattered in front of him were more than symbolic.  He walked out, supporting the one person Tony apparently could never hold a candle to, the one person the love of his life had chosen over him.
“No, they can’t!  Human physiology doesn’t work like that!” he argued back.  Pepper shot him a glare, so he cleared his throat.  “We’re not getting into that argument again.  It’ll go on for another hour and Pepper will yell at me if I’m running late.  Have fun tonight, kids.”
“Coming!” a girl shouted, followed by the pounding of multiple feet.  The door flung open to reveal a teenage girl and a pre-teen boy.
Nebula had been working on setting up an omnidirectional beacon that would send out a distress signal once the ship died on them.  It was dangerous, not knowing who would come to their aid (or maybe even death) but it was a chance they would have to take.
”  Tony covered his face with the hand Pepper wasn’t holding.  “For two years, he made me coffee, made Peter’s lunch, lived with me, slept with me
By the time he plopped down on the couch, with the two steaming mugs on the coffee table next to a bag of large marshmallows, Parks and Rec was already playing. In retaliation for Peter starting without him, he stole one of his blankets and settled in for a night of Leslie Knope shenanigans.  Three episodes into their binge (rightfully ignoring season 1 of course), their mugs were empty and Peter had laid his head on Tony’s lap, allowing Tony to play with his hair.  Soft snores floated through the apartment above Leslie’s screech of “Not you too!”  Tony was asleep before the next line could be heard.
“I don’t care!  Someone could have saw you and reported you to the police, who would report it to Ross, who would try to bring the entire UN down on your ass to arrest you for acting outside of your limits!”
They had binged some truly awful SyFy movies, arguing about the science behind whether or not Sharknado would even be possible (Tony was arguing that it totally was, come on, Rhodey, think a little!) or who would win between the Mega Shark or the Gatorsaurus.  Peter and Pepper had teamed up, saying the Gatorsaurus, but Tony and Rhodey were rooting for the Mega Shark.  The Gatorsaurus won the battle and Peter took the opportunity to throw popcorn in both Tony’s and Rhodey’s faces.
” he cried out.  He rubbed a hand over his arc reactor, feeling the weight of every mistake he ever made crushing down on him.  “I just wanted to bring the team back so we could work through the Accords.  Try to fix them…together.”
May Parker looked teary-eyed as she hugged Tony.  “Thank you for caring so deeply for that boy.  And thank you for allowing me to be a part of his life.”
Tony squeezed his eyes shut, ignoring the burning tears threatening to spill over.  This was why he never let anyone close.  It always resulted in someone getting hurt.  Usually it was the other person.
She frowned and looked over her shoulder.  The Benatar was lying in the ruins and had taken some hits during the fight.  “We might be able to salvage that.”
The redhead sighed, looking away from the brown eyes.  “It’s pretty bad.”  She inhaled a shaky breath.  “You were dead for 5 minutes before they got the arc reactor back in.  Peter was a mess while you were out.  He barely slept or ate and he never left your side.”
“I don’t know.  She never said.”  He stared at the walls and grimaced.  “Hopefully not long.  I hate hospitals.”
Peter’s dramatic “Noooo!” was interrupted by Pepper storming into the room and deflating at the sight of the two boys.
Tony clenched his eyes shut against the truth.  He wanted nothing more than to fall apart, curl up, let the tears fall freely at the loss of his son.  He wanted to sleep, let the wound on his stomach claim him; he wanted to enter the cold reality of death so he could at least be there with Peter.
“Tony!” Clint gave a strained smile, hauling up the toddler in his arms.  “Let me drop the menace off with Laura, then we can take a walk.  Do you want a water or something?”
Tony focused on Peter, standing on the side in silence.  Peter shoved his shoulders back and puffed out his chest.  “You know I can help you take him, Dad.”
“Dr. Cho.” He stated, swallowing down the lump building in his throat. “Mind explaining to me why this is back in my chest?”
He had been able to get some amendments on the Accords under way, allowing supers privacy in their personal lives.  At this point, supers would just have to register with the government that they had a superpower.   Their personal information would stay within the government, similar to registering for Social Security, and that would be that.  They wouldn’t be able to operate with their superpower unless the government gave them explicit permission or the emergency situation called for it.  There was some grey area within the document on what the emergency could be, but the UN seemed to be settled by examining situations on a case-by-case basis.
Pepper waited for Rhodes to be done before wrapping Tony in a hug herself. “Get some sleep tonight, okay?”
“Alrighty, kid.  Before we drown in our self-pity and sadness, let’s get this place tidied up. I want you to organize your mess of a backpack and notebooks.  Maybe even properly stow away your suit.”
Tony’s hands flew back to the reactor as his shoulders hunched over.  Anything to protect his heart from the shield hovering above him.  “Not again, not again, not again…”
He nodded, throwing his head back in pain as she lit up the object.  It almost looked like a mini-welder.  It definitely felt like a mini-welder.
Clint leveled a look at him.  “I’d be more pissed at you if I didn’t know how much truth those words hold.”
“Well, that was--.” Tony was cut off by a knock.  He opened the front door again, expecting one of the teens to have left a sock or phone.  He was confronted with a mailman.
She grinned again.  “I’ll get you there in a few hours.”  She disappeared below the hull before popping back up again.  “Name’s Carol, by the way.”
“We’re all a little fucked up after what we’ve had to go through,” Clint stated as he caught up to him.  “Can you at least tell me what…sets it off?  So we can—“
“He’s already had to deal with the consequences of his actions that resulted in months of isolation away from his family and home.  I don’t think he needs to hear another lecture from you,” Tony spat out.  “Shove your dick elsewhere, Ross.  This measuring contest is one you’ll never win.”
Tony pressed his fist onto his mouth, swallowing down whatever noise was trying to claw its way out.  They had lost. And Steve wasn’t there.
He turned away, hoping that would be enough to shove the memory to the side.  Instead, he was faced with something more painful.
“Fine, but if I see you pushing yourself too hard or even thinking about stepping out of this room I will make you regret it
“Will do.”  Tony ended the call, letting the phone fall to the ground and curling in on himself despite the stabbing pain in his chest.  Definitely broken ribs.  He coughed, despite the pain, feeling wetness splatter on his lips and hand.  He finally looked, grimacing at the blood coating his hand.  The gold metal on his ring finger glinted under the red.
” Tony asked, disbelieving his eyes.  “In the middle of this?  While I’m breaking it down?  Huh?  Did you hear what I said?”
This wasn’t going to be the first birthday Peter had spent without both of his parents.  There had been that one where Steve had gotten stuck on a mission in France.  SHIELD had been tailing a Hydra syndicate for weeks and had tracked the head to this small town in Eastern France.  It was August 1st when they called Steve in, and he had promised Peter to be back by the end of the week.
“I don’t expect you to understand what it’s like, but I lost more than you could ever imagine” Harshly answered Steve.
The first time Loki appeared out of thin air next to him, he was so drunk that he thought it was only one of his numerous hallucinations. He often forgot that JARVIS wasn’t there anymore to protect him from any real intruders.
When he woke up, he hurt everywhere, but it didn’t matter, because Steve was smiling at him and telling him that they won. Hulk was turning back into Banner and Clint and Natasha were slowly making there ways toward them.
He decided that he owed him to a least try to be happy. So he shut down SI weapons department. It hurt when Rhodey, Rhodey that had always stood by him trough everything, sided with Obie and told Tony he was insane and he needed to change his decision. But now that he had seen what his weapons were doing, he wasn’t going to change his decision.
When nobody but the nurse was there to hold him on the day of his birth. His father wasn’t even in the same country as him.
He stopped trying to convince the team that they should prepare for the upcoming battle against Thanos, because he didn’t even care anymore if they would win or not. He sure felt bad for all the innocent people who would die in it, but he had tried to protect people, and nobody had cared. So he was done trying to please and save everyone. Damn he missed Loki.
from up high before coming in in the most obnoxious way possible. After all, it was the first time he would meet his soulmate.
“Of course it’s me, Anthony, did you just expect me to leave you to die here? Of course I came when I heard you calling me.” Loki answered, while slowly letting green energy seep from his fingers and slowly crawl towards Tony. “Now stay calm, please. I’m doing my best to heal you, but I’m not used to using this kind of magic.”
understood their meaning then, we figured out that we were soulmates. We had to hide our relationship and our soulmark, because of the time we were living in. So congratulation, you’re the only living being that knows about this. Even during the war we fought side-by-side. He died a few months before I crashed the Valkyrie. So no, I don’t have any reason to keep moving forward without my other half.” Steve left right after finishing his story, not sparring a glance toward Tony who was shaking like a leaf.
Tony Stark didn’t want to move forward anymore. He had enough. All his life he had done nothing but try. And now he was tired. So tired. Like pretty much every morning, he wished he didn’t have to get up in the morning.
It was all he got the time to say before JARVIS went offline and he was left alone in the dark in cold emptiness of space. He could already feel the nightmares and the PTSD coming if he survived this.
He revised the footage of his discussion with Loki in the penthouse, and zoomed in on his eyes. Having the confirmation he needed, that Loki had most probably been brainwashed like Clint, he gave the data to Thor, so that his brother would not be wrongly accused.
It took Tony years to realize that the shield on his skin was slowly becoming paler and paler. It would never go away completely, but Tony didn’t care anymore. He didn’t need to share a soulmark with him to have found his soulmate.
When he was laying on the cold floor of the bunker in Siberia, watching Steve limper away with his soulmate, not Tony, his real soulmate, there was only one thing going through his head. Finally. He would die there, and he wouldn’t need to care about anybody anymore.
“You just don’t know when to quit, do you? Alright then, I’ll tell you. His name was Bucky, and I knew him since I was 5 years old. He was my best friend. Our birthday was exactly the same day. So when we turned ten, we each got a soulmark. Mine was a red star on my shoulder and his was a red, white and blue shield with a star in the centre. Even tough we didn’t
It wasn’t until he was seven that he understood that it didn’t matter how much he tried, he would never get his parents attention.  Another mask was added to his collection.
He started back all his old habits he had gotten rid of when he learned that Captain America was found frozen in the Arctic, but alive. His father had been right all along. His soulmate was alive. But Tony still knew he didn’t deserve him, he never would.
When Ross came up with the Accords, it gave him a little bit of motivation. If he could get the whole team to sign, he could easily retire without having to worry about what would happen to them. He didn’t even know why he still worried about them, seeing that they never had for him, but maybe the fact that his soulmate was on that team  didn’t help. He had given up on Steve a long time ago, but he still couldn’t bring himself to forget him.
He shook off the memories that had turned sour with age.  No use dwelling on that one night when he had other things to worry about.
“I trusted him.  And he took that trust and crushed it.”  A shuddery inhale.  “He knew, Pep.  He knew that Barnes murdered my parents.  He knew for
“Infection,” Nebula stated, running off towards one side of the ship as stars flew by.  They had a four-day trip ahead of them, with only two days of fuel.  It wasn’t looking good, but at least they weren’t on that god-forsaken planet.
“Don’t listen to him, FRIDAY!”  He yelled, slamming into the door only to find it locked.  “FRIDAY, how could you betray me like this?!”
but he was so tired.  The throbbing of his chest was a constant drone in the back of his mind and all he wanted to do was collapse on their bed and
Tony laughed and shook his head in disbelief.  “That’s good at least.  Less damage control from our end.”
The three backing Ross suddenly fell silent, leaning away from their mics to discuss in quiet murmurs.  Tony bit back his triumphant smile, knowing Ross would lose this round and wouldn’t be at all happy about it.  The ambassador for Germany, the main one backing Ross, leaned forward again.  “We find that we have to agree with Mr. Stark on that point, Mr. Ross.  I propose we start making plans for giving prisons the means to hold supers without stripping their rights from them.  They are humans too, and we should recognize that.”
MJ and Ned had just rounded the corner as Tony was about to lay into Peter.  He pulled back, dropping his pointed finger before waving his spatula at the table.  “Sit down, breakfast is almost ready.”
Peter groaned, heaving himself upwards and glaring at the two adults. The unruly sight of his hair and crusty eyes gave Pepper a laugh, which inspired him to glare harder.
They all presented their gifts to Peter before starting the movies.  He had grinned at each one, loving anything they would think to get him.  At the car keys Tony had given him, he looked up in surprise.
“Well, they would probably be looking for me if they knew I escaped, but I guess being in solitary confinements has it’s perks. And I came here to propose you a deal. You saw what was in that portal. You know something, someone big is coming. I can’t fight that alone, so I would be interested in a partnership with you.” Offered Loki.
Loki never stayed for long when they were planning, and also declined any offer of having his own room or floor on the tower even if he frequently ended up spending the night in one of the guest room of the penthouse.
They both also didn’t mention their soulmates, and didn’t ask questions about wether or not the other had found his.
When he was alone, celebrating his new tower, Agent Coulson came into his house, he too fooled into believing he had hacked JARVIS.
“What the fuck are you doing here?” Asked Tony, still keeping the repulsor directly aimed at his head.
He went to MIT at fourteen years old, way too young to be thrown to the sharks. But there was nobody there to care about what happened to him. After all, everybody there thought that at the smallest problem he would run and cry into his rich fathers arm. They didn’t know that those arms had taught him nothing but pain. His mask were too good for anyone to think that Howard was nothing but a perfect, loving and caring father.
“I love you.” Was the last thing Tony had the time to say before finally succumbing to unconsciousness.
Loki leaving still affected him way more than what he had expected. He missed having someone to banter with, someone who could follow his thought process without having to be explained everything, someone who hadn’t judged Tony before knowing him.
When Nick Fury came into his house, believing that he had succeeded in deactivating JARVIS, Tony was eager to accept his offer about being a consultant for the Avengers Initiative. After all, it was a way to pay back for all the harm he had done.
They first ended up in bed together three months into their alliance, which proved wrong Tony’s theory about Loki having someone in his life. It became a somehow regular thing after that. It didn’t mean anything, it was just a way to let off some tension. At least that’s what they told themselves. After Loki left that night, it didn’t stop Tony from having a pretty bad panic attack. He didn’t regret what he had done with Loki, but still, he unsurprisingly had some trust issues and it had been a long time since he had let someone get as close to him as that, even if it was only physical.
It still took Ultron to make Tony realize that he had never really been part of the team. After that, they stopped pretending to have any kind of respect or friendship for him and just put all the blame on him. It didn’t matter that Wanda and Bruce had equally helped in Ultron’s creation, and that the United Nation had cleared him of any guilt in Ultron case. The team also moved out of the tower and into the brand new compound, leaving Tony alone once again once it was made clear that he wasn’t welcomed into his own compound.
The Iron Man suit was next on his way to redemption, and he spent countless days and night without sleep making sure it was perfect, flawless. The PTSD he had from Afghanistan sure didn’t help him.
They spent the following month like that, opening up to each other, sharing things that they never had with anybody else before.
It didn’t take long for all of them to each have their own floor. Tony was more than happy not to live alone for once. Sure, some of Clint remarks about him being a selfish ass stung, and Natasha “Iron Man: Yes, Tony Stark: Not recommended” was still fresh in his mind, but the fact that he was living with his soulmate was more than enough to make him forget.
He still wasn’t happy, but a least he was trying to help people, to be better. Than maybe he would have a shot at happiness.
They ended up in each other arms, just savouring each others presence for the time being, neither of them willing to break the moment.
“You know that I was brainwashed for the invasion, you wouldn’t have tried to prove my innocence to Thor and Odin if you weren’t sure. And I don’t see any of the Avengers here. Do you really think they would be enough to stop what you saw?”
“That doesn’t answer my question, I thought that the All-Daddy had decided that you were in full possession of your mind at the moment of the attack.”Answered Tony, while downing his glass.
Tony kept repeating in his head that it wasn’t possible, that one way soulmates didn’t exist. But if they existed, of course it would happen to him. He didn’t know when he forgot that he didn’t deserve anything good, but he swore himself that he would never forget again.
He still stayed holed up in his lab for two weeks. When he came out, he had designed a body paint that could last for month without needing to be applied again. He made sure that Steve would never find out about his mark. It helped that Howard had gone to such length to make sure that nobody knew about his son mark.
He had already read all that information, but he went trough it again just to be sure. He also did something he had promised his teammates not to do, he had JARVIS spy on the Captain and do a full body scan for any soulmark. Only the red star on his shoulder came up. He had tough that Steve didn’t have a soulmark in the 30’s and the 40’s because he hadn’t been born, but it turned out that he had just hidden his, and that Tony was destined to be alone.
“I know. It should have been anyone else. I should have stopped it before it became anything more. But it wasn’t and I didn’t.” Tony sighed, “And I can’t stand here and apologise because I’m not sorry. He’s not what you think, Rhodey. He’s… I’ve never felt like this about anyone before.”
Steve could help the smirk that crossed his face. Tony Stark clearly liked playing with fire because not only had he text back, but he had also made it flirty. He was challenging Steve, calling him out. He seemed to be saying, if you want me, come and get me. How was Steve meant to refuse an offer like that? When Tony was clearly on the same page as him.
There were tons of websites trying to figure out which crime reports were The Captain’s victims and a few on Cap Watch that seemed to detail the changes Steve had made since taking over as head of The Avengers from someone called Phillips. There were also a few buzzfeed articles that scared Tony more than he thought to admit.
It was silly but he picked up his pace, he’d been around Steve long enough to know to trust his gut. There he went again, thinking about Steve. Damn it. Tony hooked a right, slipping down the alley in between two high-rises to take a shortcut. He couldn’t hear the tread falls anymore but he couldn’t shake the feeling of being followed. As he reached the end of the alley, he dared to take a look behind him. At first, he thought he saw a flash of something, but it was over so quickly he couldn’t be sure.
“What part of this story am I missing?” Fury pressed, “Rumlow and the bombs, I get. You and your motive to protect your family, I get. Hell, I even understand why your boy is upstairs right now remaining loyal to you despite everything you’re facing. What I don’t understand is the missing link. Why Rumlow thought he would be so untouchable to be able to move bombs in this city without anyone batting an eyelid.”
He slid them back out again, pushing a third finger in along with the others this time, stretching Tony open even further. He curled all three fingers inside of him, getting a proper feel of his prostate that had Tony shaking above him and digging his nails into Steve’s shoulder blades.
He pushed the cell door open a little more, delighted to be stepping closer to his freedom. His hands were still cuffed so he’d need to do something about that but first he needed to ditch his clothes. The bright orange would give him away instantly and if Steve was going to do this he needed to blend in.
Steve watched him shuffle into the room a little more, to look at Thor as he answered, “I don’t want him selling weapons. If my father is working for him then he’ll still be able to get his hands on some pretty lethal stuff. I’m a Stark, I feel like that responsibility is on me somehow. I don’t want to see any of you go to jail either,” Tony continued, eyes locked with Steve’s now, “So, if the question you’re really asking me is if I’m loyal to The Avengers, then, yes I am.”
Steve could feel his heart in his ribcage, could see the tears in Tony’s eyes and knew he saw ones in his own. Steve swallowed thickly, before he dropped to his knees in front of Tony, letting a tear slip down his cheek. Tony look startled and surprised by the move, looking down as Steve knelt before him almost in a bow.
Steve smiled, oh how far they’d come. Him and Tony. Survivors to the bitter end and yet here, in the steamy bathroom of Steve’s house. Their home. They found the chance to be so much more than that. Steve leaned down to kiss him again, capturing Tony’s lips softly.
Tony was tugging at his belt now, undoing it with nimble fingers and popping the button on Steve’s trousers but that wouldn’t do because all that skin was calling to him and Steve always got what he wanted. He bent his head, tongue flicking out against one of Tony’s nipples before he mouthed kisses down along his ribs. Tony sighed happily, shutting his eyes at the feeling of Steve’s mouth on him.
Steve was dead weight by that point, eyes heavy and limbs useless. He was so tired. The adrenaline had left him spent like he’d ran a marathon or had several rounds of sex. Tony hauled him to his feet, pushing him into the bed with gentle hands before climbing in next to him.
“Coulson had it as well.” Adam nodded, “Not blood but dirt. Probably got there whilst the mark was being carved into their chests. They were both shown to have defensive wounds.”
Steve strode over, arm coming out to rest on Tony’s waist as he pressed in close to him, “Hammer, I see you’ve met my date.”
He stripped off his own clothes as quickly as possible until he was just as naked as Tony before leading him into the shower. Tony went numbly, and Steve followed him into the steam and the spray of the water, shutting the frosted door behind them.
He moved a hand down to wrap around Tony’s, both encompassing his cock as Steve guided his hand to set the pace. They worked Tony’s cock together, stroking his length at a faster pace than before.
Steve was in no mood, “Grab Thor, head to the docks. I want eyes on Hydra’s base of operations. You call me the second you see Rumlow, okay?”
Tony’s hands moved from his knees, cold fingers digging into Steve’s shoulder blades, allowing Steve to use him in whatever way he needed to follow Tony into bliss. Steve leaned his head down, licking a strip up Tony’s chest as his own hips stuttered with the promise of release.
“Steve…” Fury paused for a moment before continuing, “You’ve got 48 hours maximum. Then Ross will issue kill orders. Anyone still around by then will be shot on sight. Special branch wants this one done.”
It takes Tony every minute of constant working to pull it off, he hasn't slept and no one has brought him food. He isn't even sure how long he's been in this room, a day at least, maybe more. There are no windows and nothing to mark the passage of time so he doesn't focus on it. Instead, he works. Constantly. Obsessively.
He leaned down to kiss Tony softly, wanting to celebrate his small victory with him. He kept it short and sweet, pulling back to see Tony pouting gently. Steve chuckled, giving him another kiss on the forehead before pulling back.
“So much. Too much.” Tony panted, “I’d do anything for you. I’d kill you for, I’d lie for you, I’d let the world burn for you.”
Tony smiled then, leaning down to give Steve a quick kiss before pulling back. His fingers left Steve’s hand, tugging at the loose bow tie around Steve’s neck until he got the material free.
Steve shuffled in his seat, cuffs chaffing his wrists, “My family. I walk a fine line between who I am and who I never want to be. They keep me on the right side of that line. Whatever I became, it would have happened a lot sooner and a lot worse if it wasn’t for them.”
He needed to see Steve. Was he in a room like this one? Or had Ross dragged his family down to the holding cells without so much as reading them their rights. Was Rhodey here? Did he know Tony had been arrested and was possibility about to be charged with who knows what? Steve had told him to stay quiet, let the lawyer do the talking and be in the clear but honestly, all Tony wanted was to know what was happening with his family.
Tony did as he was told, hand moving off Steve’s bicep to his own neglected cock. He whimpered as he took himself in hand, softly stroking the length in his fist. Steve watched over his shoulder in fascination, seeing Tony pleasure himself only made Steve more aroused. God, he was beautiful.
Howard had been angry that Tony had destroyed it, but he had been angrier that Tony had managed to figure it out when he hadn’t. It was the proof he needed that Tony might end up succeeding him one day. That he might be even more brilliant than even Howard Stark. That wasn’t something Howard would have ever allowed to happen while he was alive.
“Okay, I just need the element of surprise. If I can get the jump on him then knock him out, we can deliver him to Fury and with Howard’s testimony the law can do its thing.” Steve explained.
“Just like that, baby.” He preened and Steve rewarded him with an increase in pace and harder thrusts.
“I am.” Fury insisted, “We’ll get this case thrown out due to Ross’ involvement. We’ll out him as Hydra. No one will want to prosecute when it’s this much of a mess. I’ll say you were my informant, you helped with Hydra and Ross in return for immunity.”
Steve all but ran to her room on the second floor, irrationally thinking this was Hydra. Natasha wouldn’t have been shouting about it if it was Hydra though, she’d be killing them. Steve realised his mistake when he heard Bucky’s voice answer hers behind the closed door of her bedroom.
He’d help, he owed Steve. T’Challa was an ambitious politician, he had a good education and better ideas but no one would vote for an underdog from the back alleys of Brooklyn. Steve had been fairly new to leading The Avengers back then and he personally endorsed T’challa, openly talking about his merit in bars and in front of his people. They had grown up together, these streets were their playground. These alleys were their arenas. Steve and Bucky went off to fight in Afghanistan and T’challa had gone away for school but somehow, they had all managed to make it back to the streets they once called home.
“These people are a waste of energy.” Thor commented once his hammer was clean enough for his liking.
Bruce swallowed thickly, eyes on Bucky, “Heat. Clint, in the garage there are some iron pokers. I need you to get one, burn it over the oven, gas up all the way. Wait until it’s glowing orange and bring it to me quickly.”
Howard slammed both hands on the table in anger and Bucky was quick like a shot, pulling a gun from inside his jacket and cocking it level at Howard with a blank face. Tony was panting, heart hammering like a hummingbird in his chest as Howard seethed.
“It’s business.” Howard snapped, “We’re a weapons manufacturer. It goes with the territory. If it makes you feel uncomfortable then come back to the company, we’ll set up some charity events and make some donations. You need to think about the bigger picture, Tony. You can’t survive without money and this is how we make it.”
Steve felt the icy grip of fear in his chest at Rumlow’s words, getting to his feet with shaky steps, “What are you talking about?” He demanded.
He shook his head to rid himself of the thought, making his way back to the bedroom to place his note down on the bedside table so Tony would see it when he woke up. Once that was done, Steve knew he needed to leave. There was no reason to stay and he had promised Bucky he was on his way home. He lingered on Tony once more, trying to commit the scene to memory so he could draw it later and then he made his way out of the apartment, shutting the door softly behind him to allow Tony to get some more sleep.
Tony sighed and stood up, fishing a rag out of his back pocket to wipe his hands, “One and the same. Before you think about kidnapping me or whatever, don’t bother. I don’t deal with my dad or the business anymore. I haven’t spoken to him in years and I prefer it that way. I’m just a mechanic.”
Tony tried not to smile at that, he tried to ignore the way his heart sped up and his mouth went dry. Steve’s hand moved from the bed, reach up towards Tony’s shoulder and over to the cluster of circles on his shoulder blade. He tried not to flinch as Steve’s large fingers felt the bumps and ridges of the scars marking his skin.
Tony mouthed an ‘I love you’ in the space between them and that was all it took for Steve to cum, buried deep inside Tony with a pained gasp and Tony’s hand gripping his on his chest. He pumped Tony still, riding out his wave as he felt the slick of Tony’s cum dribbling onto his fist. Tony leaned his head back, causing Steve’s forehead to bump his nose because of how close they were, and he was coming too. A shudder of silent pleasure as he fell apart in Steve’s arms.
“Jesus.” Tony sipped at his coffee again, “Your cat, your responsibility. You feed him; you keep him away from the cars. Your Aunt is going to kill me.”
Instead, he was glancing down on his phone every few moments, staring at the screen like a drowning man. He’d taken it out of his pocket before they started the movie, he hated it digging into his side when he sat down and it was in his jeans so he’d placed it on the arm of the couch within reach and now it served a purpose to mock him everything he looked at it.
The guy behind him had regained his balance now and had his arms around Tony tightly, trapping him to his body. Tony kicked out at the guy advancing on him, kicking him in the gut hard enough to send him reeling back a few feet. Then his focus was on the guy holding him, umbrella trapped against his body. Tony lodged an elbow into his side. He wasn’t much of a fighter, but he was scrappy and fast. He threw his head back, hearing a crack from his attacker’s nose but his hold loosened, and Tony managed to slip free.
“I’ll come after them next.” Rumlow told him as he struggled to overpower Steve. They were locked in a stalemate fighting for dominance.
Steve frowned, following her gaze over to the dent in his vintage car with a genuine smile on his face. If only Natasha knew the half of it. She might be right though; he would need to get that dent out of the side of the car door and Tony was a good mechanic. It would be rude not to ask him to take a look, right?
Nat smiled back, “I know. Who else is going to keep you from going crazy and deal with the boring stuff like hiring mechanics and reminding you to eat?”
“Bedroom?” Steve demanded, hands moving to unbutton Tony’s jeans. He made sure to brush his fingers over Tony’s cock as he did so, drawing another moan from him.
There was a knock on the door minutes later, but Tony didn’t register it, he couldn’t stop looking at Ross’ body near his feet, blood pooling under his shoes now.
Tony smirked, dirty and sinful before stroking him one last time, releasing Steve’s cock as he laid back down against the table again.
He took the knife from Tony’s fingers, slipping it back into his boot before standing straight again. They had gone closer. Close enough that Steve could see the gold flecked in Tony’s eyes and the smear of oil on his cheek. He could see where the hair fell over his forehead and the glisten of sweat on his tanned skin. Steve swallowed thickly.
The sound of a phone ringing startled him, and Steve clenched his hands into fists to stop them from shaking. It wasn’t his phone. He reached on the floor for the suit jacket at the end of the bed, fishing out Pierce’s phone from the pocket. He knew who was calling, who else would it be?
Fury leaned even closer, “I want you to come work with me. You and your family. Look, I’ve been in this job a long time and I know these streets, I know the legal stuff but you, you have the kind of knowledge about operations and mindset that I’ll never have in a million years. I don’t think a unit like this could work without someone like you on board.”
He twisted the guy up, hands on either side of his head and pulled sharply. The snap was sickening, and the change was immediate. Steve let the body fall to the floor before calmly stepping over it.
Bucky's eyes were scanning the warehouse, "I haven't seen him but he has to be in there. Rumlow was here earlier, left with a couple of guys just before I called you. If we're doing this, we gotta do it now."
Tony didn’t even blink as he shrugged his own jacket off and let it fall to the floor. Steve just watched him. The match had been struck.
“You’re not.” Natasha replied, “In all the time I’ve known Steve, do you know how many people he’s seriously dated? How many he brought to meet us?”
“It’s risky,” Natasha sighed, “Too many variables. We don’t know what cell he’s in. We don’t know what kind of watch Ross has him under. Too many cameras. No way to get him out.”
Natasha pulled back, punched him hard in the arm and smiled wide again, “Anyone would think you like being a self-sacrificing idiot.”
He nodded, “Okay.” Before withdrawing his fingers and reaching for the condom. He rolled it onto his length slowly, gripping the base to try and calm himself down as he applied another helping of lube to his cock and then he lined himself up with Tony’s entrance.
“I believe he cares for you deeply,” Thor leaned forward, elbows on the table, “And I know he cares for all of us. I’ve never known him to think of himself over any of us.”
“I got pretty good at being a hostage in the end.” Tony replied, “Learnt a few survival skills. I am bringing down this whole mood though so let’s change the subject.”
Steve did as Fury suggested, keeping to the side streets and alleyways, looping back around the building to find Natasha’s getaway car waiting for him. Steve could see her smiling at him in the rear-view mirror, wide and joyful at seeing him. He couldn’t help but return it as he slipped into the passenger seat of the beat-up Volvo she’d chosen to use as their vehicle. Sam and Thor were in the back seat with equal grins.
Steve could imagine Natasha’s recoil at the statement, her voice lower than before, “I had an abortion, Bucky. It was the right thing to do.”
The whole idea set his teeth on edge, suddenly he was back in reality and a million miles away from the night he’d spent with Tony.
He shuffled above Steve, knees wedged against the back of the seat in order to line Steve’s cock up with his entrance, holding himself so the tip grazed over his already slicked up hole.
“You should stop by the house. Bucky will be happy to share a drink and a few memories with you.” Steve replied.
Steve smiled, shifting in his seat, “I’m not joking, Tony. Not everything you read about me is true but a lot of it is.”
He pushed open the door to Rhodey’s office with a shaky hand. He hadn’t slept all night, despite the fact Natasha had ushered him up to Steve’s room and told him to try. Tony couldn’t. The bed smelled like Steve and being there without him felt wrong.
He flipped on the light and his hand grabbed the edge of Steve’s leather jacket, pulling him into Tony’s home. Steve pushed the door shut behind him with the heel of his foot, not wanting to tear his eyes away from Tony’s for a moment. The tension between them was thick and Steve watched Tony swallow, throat bobbing. It was like they were locked in a stalemate, having been doused with gasoline and now they were just waiting for which one of them would strike a match first.
Steve wasted no time in swirling his fingers into his mouth, coating them in his own spit until they were slick enough. Tony was panting with the build-up, aware of every movement Steve made. His cock bobbed against his stomach, eager and hot and red.
Then Steve was moving, hands back on Tony’s ass as he jostled him about long enough to get the passenger side door open of the BMW 230SL so he could climb inside. He sat himself down on the cream leather passenger seat with Tony in his lap, arranging himself so his knees were either side of Steve’s thighs and he had a grip on Steve’s shoulders to steady himself.
Steve stalled, blue eyes torn and searching for the right thing to say, “If you want to be.” He said, words for Tony. The double meaning was clear.
He was running on guess work, having no idea about the warehouse or it's layout but he kept heading in the same direction, pushing forward. His guess was it was once industrial, if the metal timbers and support beams ahead of him were any indication and that meant in theory there would be an exit from either end of the warehouse. One for trade goods and one for staff.
Howard blanched, Tony had never directly brought up the abuse to him before and he could tell it had thrown him, “You were an insolent child, Tony. You were difficult but you were brilliant. That’s a brilliance we could use. Working in a garage? You’re wasting your potential and you know it.”
Ross seemed mildly irritated, Tony could see his right eye twitch as he crossed his arms over his chest and paced the small space. It wasn’t lost on Tony that he put himself in between him and the door.
“Oh Punk.” He replied, “You know why it’s a bad idea. You’re a mob boss. You’re the King of Brooklyn. Everyone in town knows your name and half of them want to see you dead in a ditch and take your throne for themselves. We have Hydra coming at us, the cops coming at us. We need you focused, not distracted by a mechanic who doesn’t belong in our world.”
“Not a scratch, okay? I built this thing single-handedly.” Tony told him as he stepped out onto the street.
Natasha led him into the kitchen, bustling around the room with the grace of a dancer as she filled the coffee pot and set out finding a whole heap of mugs. Tony stood by the kitchen table, unsure if he should help or stay out of the way.
Sitwell seemed to glance her up and down for a moment, and Steve wondered if he was checking for a weapon before he spoke, “Let’s consider it a lesson learned. In return, Hydra wants a redrawing of the territories. We wanted everything from 79
“Of all the bars in all the towns.” The voice startled him, glass in hand as a body slipped into the seat next to him.
Steve followed him, the cold night air hitting him suddenly against his tux. The snow was crunching under his shoes as he followed Pierce out into the night.
The night was a clear one despite the chill and Steve found his eyes drifting up to take in the darkness of the sky as they waited. Natasha was a statue next to him, if she was cold then she didn’t let it show. Bucky was kicking his foot into the dirt under his boots with impatience and Steve wanted to tell him to knock it off but held his tongue. It would do no good to fight amongst themselves when they needed to be a solid unit. Thor didn’t seem to notice the cold either, he wasn’t wearing a coat, just a thick knit jumper that looked like it came out of a thrift store. He was swinging a large hammer in his palm with ease and Steve knew despite the heaviness of the tool, Thor barely registered it as anything else than an extension of his arm.
“Is that right?” Steve quirked an eyebrow. The wind had picked up and he could feel his hair brushing again his forehead.
He took a left, seeing a figure out of the corner of his eye quickly duck into a shop doorway. He frowned but thought nothing of it, everyone was out this morning. Last minute Christmas shopping probably. Tony continued on his way, feeling cautious about the sound of soft treads in the snow behind him.
It was his name from Tony’s lips. His name like a prayer, like a swear word, like a lighthouse calling him home, “Add another finger.” Steve told him.
“It’s going to be okay, Buck.” Steve told him; an echo of the reassurance Steve used to give him whilst they were deployed. Bucky didn’t respond but didn’t pull away either and Steve wondered whether he was talking about Tony, Natasha or the mess with Hydra.
“Cap! Thor’s back!” It was Sam’s voice that shouted down to the garage and caused Steve to remember himself and pull back.
Tony had gone from a mechanic to a CEO billionaire in charge of a major company overnight and on top of everything else he was going through Steve knew he was struggling. He’d see it in the way Tony would spend restless nights beside him, tossing and turning because he couldn’t shut his mind down. He’d see it in the way Tony turned to coffee like a vice, knocking back cup after cup like it was healthy. He’d see it in the way Tony’s shoulders sat when he came home, rigid and exhausted, those evenings where he could barely manage much more than to stumble into Steve’s arms and hope he’d catch him. Steve always did but he hated that Tony was being reduced to this.
“Don’t say it like you’re giving up.” It was Tony’s voice, smaller and unsure next to Thor’s but Steve’s eyes immediately went to him. So did everyone else’s.
“Steve.” Tony whispered, closing the gap between them as Steve bounced on the balls of his feet. “Look at me.”
“I don’t want this to turn into a gang war. There will be casualties, there always is.” Steve replied.
Tony gripped his hand tighter as they weaved through people, “Thanks for the rescue. I can feel my braincells dying when I talk to that guy.”
Bucky wasn’t looking at her, eyes focused on the wall above her head when he replied, “We got him didn’t we? No cuts, no bruises. Guy barely put up a fight.”
Sam slid their drinks at them, eyes boring into Steve’s skull but Steve said nothing other than a quick thanks which prompted Sam to get back to his work, “I’m going to have to explain this one later.” He told Tony with a smile, “He’s like a bored housewife when it comes to gossip.”
He nodded as she walked back to the kitchen to round up "her boys" and Steve was shrugging into his own jacket before he could talk himself out of it.
Tony seemed pleased enough with that statement to reach up for Steve’s collar, dragging his face down to meet Tony’s in a searing kiss. Steve was already hard, his hands gripping at Tony’s waist as his tongue invaded his mouth. He licked at Tony’s lips, flicking his tongue along the edge of Tony’s own until he heard a moan from the smaller man.
“Fuck, Tony.” He panted into Tony’s back as he came inside him. Tony sighed happily, slumping down a little as his legs wobbled. Steve caught him, holding him firmly to his chest as he came down from his high.
“It’s all falling apart. The Avengers, Brooklyn. Everything. We’ll have a gang war on the streets by Christmas and after that? We’ll be in jail or we’ll be dead. That’s why I didn’t tell you, that’s what I’m protecting you from. That’s what I’ve been protecting you from since that first body was found. That’s my job. My responsibility.” Steve snapped, running a hand through his hair.
He increased his pace a little when Tony gave a whine, keeping his tongue flat on the underside of Tony’s cock to heighten the feeling. Tony moaning wantonly, Steve always did love how vocal he could be.
“Thank you. Leave us.” Ross motioned to the cop that had brought Tony in. There was an exchange of nods between them and the cop slipped out, leaving Tony and Ross alone in the broom cupboard of an office with everything surging between them like a river.
