Tony sat up, reluctantly pulling away from his boyfriend.  “Barnes, you got plans for the rest of the afternoon?”
“No,” Steve protested, reaching out for the forms like he thought Tony was going to keep them away. “Have to go home, Tony.”
“Mine,” he said, holding up the red bear. “For Da,” he held up the blue bear. “So Da can cuddle,” he explained seriously. Steve smiled.
Which he did, under Steve’s watchful eye, for a few days at least. On the fifth day home he snuck down to the workshop to tinker and didn’t get caught until two hours later when Steve appeared, arms folded, and disappointed face aimed at his boyfriend. He kept an even closer eye on Tony after that as Tony rested on the sofa, after refusing the bed, for the next few days.
Steve had a thought and pulled out his phone to text Clint. -Can you pick him up a teddy bear too? Please.-
“Indy I just had to take care of until I got to you. And he wasn’t an infant.” Bucky sighed. “I should just let Tony be her dad. He wouldn’t even have to adopt her, she has no paperwork he could just make himself her father and that would be it. He could give her everything she needs, you both could.”
“Oh, I’m sure you’ll be a perfect little princess, wont you?” Nat responded, but speaking to Poppy.  “I think you’re challenge is going to be this one today,” she whispered, nodding to the boy who was now jumping on the bed. Bucky huffed a laugh.
“Hi,” Tony whispered, closing his eyes to the sensation.  Steve pulled him close by wrapping his arms around his back and hugging tightly.
Steve was woken up a few hours after falling asleep by a shriek very close to his ear. He jerked away but then looked back to see a sleepy looking Tony with his blanky and teddy standing beside his bed.
“Hi Peanut. I’m glad you’re here,” Tony smiled at him. Indy turned to Bucky and reached out for the blue bear.
Bucky and Steve laughed at the same time. Tony shoveled more Mac and cheese into his mouth and the tension in the room dissolved, at least a little bit.
“That name gets my vote too, if anyone cares,” Bucky said casually with a smirk, walking in to the room with Indy in his arms. Steve smiled.
“What’s wrong, baby?” Steve asked, noticing his distress. Indy looked at the shirt in his hands and held it up for Steve to see.
“It’s gonna be okay. Bucky was right, that kid’s got you now so he’s lucky.” Tony turned his head to the side and kisses Steve’s temple.
The baby, at this point, had enough of not having Tony’s full attention and let out a sob, pushing back against Steve to show her displeasure. “Okay, I know,” Steve placated.
Tony stiffened and his hand grasped Steve’s bicep. “No,” he spoke quickly. “Like this, wanna stay. Please”
Steve took a chance and reached out his hand, taking Tony’s chin and turning it so he was looking at Steve. “Well, I don’t know what to tell you, Bubba, because I love you. So much. Even when you act like this. Even when you break stuff.” Tony had gasped softly at Steve’s words, momentarily shocking him into quiet. Steve took the opening and gently picked up the small boy, sitting down with him on his lap. Tony struggled a little for show, not willing to give in yet, but Steve held on, pressing his hand against Tony until he relaxed against his chest.
“Yeah,” Bucky agreed immediately. “It’s fine. It’ll always be fine, even if you hate me.” Tony gestured inside and Indy looked up and screeched.
Peter jumped up, grabbing his gift bag and headed for the kitchen. “Hey,” he called softly once Tony was in sight. Tony blinked his eyes open to look at Peter. He looked shocked that Steve let him through. “I have this for Luca. I’ll be quick.” For the moment, Peter ignored the fact that Tony was a mess. His face was red and tear streaked and he was sniffling as Luca still whimpered on his lap, confused as to the mood in the room. “Hi Buddy,” he said to the little boy happily. “I got you a present.” He pulled a chair in front of Tony and sat and showed the bag to Luca. Luca reached out grabbing the top roughly and pulling.
“I have one more thing for you, sweetheart.” Steve took a pad of paper and a pack of crayons out of his bag. “Remember how I told you about Santa Claus? And how he comes on Christmas and leaves presents?” Indy nodded. “Well, he needs to know what you want so you have to write him a letter.” Steve moved Indy back to his seat and gave him the crayons. “I can you help you write the list but do you want to draw him a picture?”
“Okay sweet talker, you already got me.” He waggled his ring finger at Steve then leaned in to kiss him. A couple seconds into the kiss they both felt tiny hands patting them on their cheeks. The pulled apart to see Indy who was sitting on Steve’s lap looking expectantly at his dad’s.
“Good job, one more time I think,” Tony told him and leaned forward this time as well and gave a quick puff of breath right when Indy did so the flame went out. Everyone clapped. Pepper, god bless her, was taking pictures so they’d have these moments to look back on.
After a lengthly awkward silence Steve cleared his throat. “Indy’s therapy appointment is in a few minutes. I’m going to bring him.”  Without you went unsaid. Steve went into the living room and picked Indy up, pausing so he could say goodbye to his dad as they walked by. Tony gave the boy a small smile and kissed his forehead.
“Bucky.” Steve said disbelieving. “This is big. I had the same freak out when you told me about Indy.”
"I'm messing with you. Jesus. Breathe," Tony told him, putting his tools down and looking at the man on the stool. Bucky did take a deep breath, looking pained as he did it. "Again," Tony ordered, when it seemed necessary.
“Then, and again this is hard to interpret from what he is able to put into words, but, I believe he was saying that they would do tests or experiments on him. I’m fairly certain they took many blood samples from what he mimed on his arm. He said they were scary and that’s when he started getting the most upset. There were other things I’d like to delve further into that I can’t quite understand yet based on his descriptions but I think that for an introduction it went well.” She closed her notebook and sighed.  “I know these sessions can be difficult not only for the patient but for the family. It’s not easy. There’s no question about that but I do think it’s the right thing to do and I hope you’ll continue. I’d like to help as much as I can.”
Tony stepped fully in to the room and over toward his boyfriend. “You know Jarvis can tell us as soon as he starts to wake up. Come on, put him down and come with me.”
Happy pulled up to the main entrance of their first stop. “Hey, Steve. You know us going out in public with him is going to be front page news right? You okay with that?” Steve sighed.
Peter stood up and walked over to Steve, wrapping his arms around the taller man and burying his face in Steve’s shoulder. “They’re gonna be there. This is going to work,” Peter assured him, voice muffled by Steve’s sweatshirt. Steve rubbed Peter’s back and made eye contact with Natasha over his head.
“I just got up to use the bathroom,” Steve explained. “I heard Indy crying so I checked on him and he had gotten sick, so I was trying to give him a bath and he freaked out.”
“I’m going to help you this time, sweetheart. Daddy can say good night to you after.” Indy whined but Steve whisked him out of the room before it could upset the baby.
“The best,” he answered immediately. “Let’s go meet your son. Properly.” He stood and offered his hand to Steve who took it to pull himself up before going back to the conference room.
Tony smirked. “On a table over there. I didn’t want to overwhelm you, we’ll sort through it and see what you like. Now, what’s up?”
“Uh, he didn’t have a name from Hydra. I’ve been with him over a week, preparing to drive here so I had to call him something,” Bucky shrugged.
“Gentle,” Tony said automatically, pulling Indy’s hand away. “Let’s sit you down next to Papa first.” Steve reached out immediately pulling Indy from Tony and kissing him then sitting him on the cushion next to him.
Tony spent the rest of the day and night taking care of the baby while Steve helped occasionally while also taking care of Indy. Bucky had made himself scarce, not even showing up for dinner.
“Yeah, tell him to get in here quickly.” Steve sat down where he had been crouched next to the tub and pulled Indy into his lap. “Bucky’s coming,” he said, hoping that was what he wanted. Bucky walked in a minute later taking in the scene quickly.
“I’m pissed, Steve,” he snapped. “He’s been here for days and he springs this now.” Tony shook his head as he stood up, throwing the tools he had in the box on the tabletop. Steve winced at the loud clanging sound. “Not that it matters. Fact is there was never an accident, it was cold blooded murder. And that murderer is here.” Tony turned toward Steve suddenly.  “I hope you know he can’t stay.”  Steve sighed.
“Hey,” Steve called softly. Bucky glanced over with a sad smile. “Hi, Sweetheart.” Steve walked to the front of the sofa so he was standing over the two of them. Indy’s eyes tracked Steve’s movements but he didn’t say anything. Steve reached out and brushed his hand over the boys forehead. “You’re okay.” Something in those words broke something in the boy and Indy’s faced scrunched up, tears forming, and a sob pushed past the pacifier. “Oh, baby,” Steve reached down quickly and picked him up. He held him close and bounced him lightly. “Shh, you’re safe, buddy. I promise, everything’s fine and we don’t have to talk about any of that stuff again today.” He kissed the top of his head. Tony came in to the room from the kitchen with a sippy cup.
“Steve,” Tony said after a few minutes. “Thank you. You were right about me needing this today and we do need to make some changes. I get that.” Steve smiled brightly.
“I love you,” Steve murmured, voice thick with emotion. “I can’t lose you, Tony. This can’t happen again.”
“Was he in diapers when you found him, Buck? He’s a little old for them, right? I don’t even know,” Steve mumbled.
“We’ll see you in a little while, sweetheart,” Steve told his son, kissing his nose. Luca scrunched his face in reply and Steve chuckled.
Sorry it’s been so long since updating! This is a quick chapter but part 2 of it should be up pretty soon as well :)
The ancient looking flip phone buzzed obtrusively on the counter at the far end of Tony's workshop. Tony himself looked up toward the noise from where he had been tinkering with the latest mach Iron Man suit. It had been 6 months almost to the day from when he had received the phone in the mail, and for all he tried to keep it charged and ready, he never really expected to get a call. The phone was for him, to reach out if he felt necessary, which he didn't. So now, he stood staring down at the still buzzing object with confusion. He knew he was letting it go too long but he couldn't bring himself to answer.
“Buppy, please,” Indy sobbed, reaching out and grabbing a fistful of Bucky’s shirt. “I come see Papa. I’m sorry.”
“How do you feel, Tony? Does anything hurt?” His hands roamed Tony’s body, as if he’d be able to feel if something was bothering him.
“Of course.” Bucky sighed then added. “I’m sure you won’t, but if you wanted to grab yourself some food you could also do that. I know you haven’t been eating much.” Tony smirked.
“We saw files that said she was created with super-soldier DNA so he said it’s Steve’s then and I just said it could also be his. Right? He hasn’t really said anything or looked at her since.”
“Thank you, Munchkin. I accept your apology. Can I get a hug?” Indy flung himself onto Tonys chest and clutched onto his shirt.
“Okay I think I know what you want,” Tony said. “Papa and I got you a Valentines gift. You wanna see it?”
“Time to come with me, sweetheart.” Tony stiffened for a moment, the need warring with wanting to finish his work. Steve saw the hesitation. “Give me the rest of today and tonight and you can finish your work tomorrow.” Tony put down the tools he was holding and swiveled his stool to face his boyfriend. Steve smiled, stepping forward into the space between Tony’s knees. “Hi,” he said as he kissed Tony’s forehead.
“He did it,” Tony spoke with such hatred that Steve shivered. “You killed my parents,” Tony aimed at Bucky.
“Here.” Steve relaxed his hold so Tony could take him. Tony did and rearranged the little boy in his arms, holding him like a baby on his back even though he was a toddler. He was still small enough that he fit there comfortably with a little maneuvering.
Bucky smirked, already reaching out. “‘Course I can.” Indy allowed Bucky to take him and Tony passed him the basket then took his spot next to Steve.
Steve glanced from them to his fiancé with the baby still in his lap. “Hey,” he called softly. Tony looked back at him. “Seems like this Christmas was a success.”
“It’s definitely an ear infection. We probably caught it pretty early on since she hasn’t had any severe symptoms yet. I can give you antibiotic ear drops you can start her on right away.”
He pulled out his phone and sent Natasha a text that Poppy was all set. Natasha had offered to watch over Poppy and hold her during the ceremony while Bucky dealt with Indy and his best man duties. She knocked a minute later and Indy ran to the door pulling it open and yelling his greeting.
“Uh, no, Munchkin. Steve’s your dad remember? Bucky said when he introduced you yesterday,” Tony laughed nervously. He didn’t know why this was freaking him out so much. They were having a perfectly nice morning. Indy furrowed his brow as he took in what Tony was telling him.
“Okay let’s see if your Daddy is awake. Papa needs to sleep so he can get better.” Bucky carried Indy into his parents room. Both men were still sound asleep. Bucky went to Tony’s side and nudged his shoulder. “Stark.” He shook him a little more. “Tony, wake up.” Tony grumbled something unintelligible.
“Not many specifics. You can be damn sure I’ll be having a talk with Fury though,” Tony said angrily. Steve ignored that.
“Shh. Stop apologizing. I’m the one who’s sorry.” He grabbed the hem of his shirt pulling it up and wiping it over his face. “Ugh. Seriously, breakdown aside, I’m the one who messed up here. I shouldn’t push you away.” Steve couldn’t help the small smile he had at Tony’s words.
Four days later the doctor released Tony from the hospital on the promise that he spend the next two weeks, at least, resting in bed or on the sofa with absolutely no strenuous work.
Steve stood quickly and met him halfway across the empty room. He clung on to him as soon as he was close enough. Bucky wrapped his free arm around Steve’s back and held him as he shook in his grip. “It’s gonna be okay,” he said for Steve and Indy’s benefit. “I’m going to see if I can talk to the doctor okay and figure out what’s going on.” Steve nodded and pulled away reluctantly. “Sit,” Bucky ordered him and placed Indy on his lap once he did. “Indy really wanted to see you,” he said in case Steve was wondering why he ended up bringing him. “Why don’t you give your Papa some cuddles,” he told Indy who instantly curled into Steve’s chest.
Tony sighed. “Okay, yeah, maybe. But it wasn’t. We can’t dwell on that we just have to deal with what did happen. I’m fine.” He kissed Steve and felt him melt into it until JARVIS interrupted them.
Tony ambled into the kitchen, eyes half open and hair askew, dragging in an equally rumpled and tired Indy hand in hand.
“Hey, no,” Bucky said quickly, grabbing Indy’s arm before he got any further. “Gentle, remember? No climbing.” Indy pouted and crossed his arms across his chest.
“I’ll uh, just,” he pointed back the way he came and started to turn away. Steve stepped forward instantly.
"I'm sure its a million times worse for you," Bucky said honestly. "And I'm not defending him. At all. But it might help both of you move on if you can just talk a little."
“I may have sent Happy to the store a couple days ago to get one. So we’d be ready when we ventured out.” Steve looked momentarily shocked, more choked up over a car seat than he really should be.
“Of course,” Steve agreed. “It’s fine, Tony. I’m comfortable with you in my lap, I just wanted to make sure you were.”
“Yes, please. Do that now. Tell him to hurry.” Bucky hurried over to the living area. Indy was now sitting beside Poppy who was sitting in her playpen. “Kiddo, we have to go out.” He walked up behind the boy and pulled him to his feet then picked Poppy out of the playpen. He situated her on his hip and then reached his free hand out for Indy’s. “Come on.”
Steve woke up the next morning with a snuggly Tony still suck to his side. He had managed to sleep through the rest of the night and didn’t look like he would be waking up anytime soon so Steve decided to get up and make them a nice breakfast.
Steve hurried back to Tony who latched onto him the second he sat down, arms wrapping around Steve’s middle, face pressed into his shoulder.
I keep putting out short chapters just to get some content out, but at least you get the results of the DNA test!
She nodded knowingly. “Don’t worry about him just take care of this one.” She poked the baby’s nose with her finger gently then headed to the cockpit to join the other two men.
“Well, no. I mean not at first. But he’s in timeout as punishment for taking something that wasn’t his so that takes care of that part, but I feel like there might be more to it than just that doll at the park.”
“I’m going to clean this first, okay? It’s going to sting a little but I’ll be quick.”  He took out some saline and poured it over the cut, wiping it gently with some gauze to get rid of the dried blood. Once that was done he pulled out the antiseptic spray. “Okay, why don’t you hold Steve’s hand and squeeze as hard as you need to, okay?”
Steve entered his and Tony’s bedroom, Indy in his arms. “Okay, Tony, I just put the last diaper Bucky had on him and he’s worn this shirt and pants 3 times this week. It’s time to go shopping.”
“I’ve had worse,” Bucky answered with a smirk. “He tried to walk off with this little girls doll at the park, she screamed at him and I grabbed it and gave it back.”
Indy nodded. “Have.” Indy rolled over and crawled on to Tony’s chest and laid down to hug him. Tony squeezed him back and shuffled over to the middle to be next to Steve who brought his arm around Tony’s waist once he was within reach.
“Stand up for a sec,” Steve motioned to Tony. He helped his arms into the hoodie and then zipped it up all the way. Tony was drowning in it but he looked cozy and warm.
Bucky looked down at the little boy beside him. “I’m going to help your Papa and Dad with their work. When we’re done you can come see us okay? But I need you to be good right now and listen to me.” The elevator door opened and Bucky could see Happy in the idling car not far away. Indy pulled out of his grip.
“Why don’t you go around to the other side and get in the back with him?” Tony said. Steve did that and climbed in the other side, holding Indy’s hand once he was settled. “See, Papa’s going to sit here the whole time and hold your hand. We’ll be at the store in no time and then we’ll take you out.” Tony leaned in closer to Indy. “Can you be our brave boy for a little while, huh?” Indy nodded, but it didn’t stop the tears from streaming down his face. Tony wiped them away with his thumbs. “I’m going to sit right in front of you, okay?” Tony nodded at Steve and then closed the back door, getting himself situated in the front passenger seat.
“Poppy sleep,” Indy said sternly, copying the tone and look that his parents give him when they want him to listen. “Santa has to come and I’ll be mad if you don’t sleep,” he continued.
Bucky looked down at the bag and then placed it on the counter. “Indy’s birthday is in a few days.” Bucky cleared his throat. “I saw this and I thought he’d like it, but if you don’t want me  to give it to him I understand.”
“Go put him to bed, Darling. I gotta go anyway. Pep will be here in a minute to go over some things before our meeting so I’m going to get ready.”
“Uh, just for background, ‘no please’ was one of the few things he could say when Bucky found him and brought him to us. His vocabulary was very limited, but he could say that and ‘safe’ and a few other things. I think he understood more than he could actually say because he always seemed to understand things but he’s learned a lot very quickly and can say a lot more now. Can’t you?” Steve bounced Indy once on his lap.
“You can’t leave now, Buck,” Steve said before he protested. “Please. We need to talk, but it’s late. You can stay here tonight.”
“We have to do them spaced out or he’ll think it’s too much so he opened Bruce’s. If one of you wants to give him yours now then we can wait a bit for another one,” Steve told everyone.
“Yes,” Steve breathed. Tony’s head snapped up. “Yes, Tony. Of course I’ll marry you.  I want that too, all of it.” Tony laughed nervously.
“Well, I need to rest I’ve been told,” Tony replied mock seriously. Steve picked up Poppy and stood.
The coordinates were delivered via JARVIS the next day at noon. Steve suited up and met Natasha in the living area so they could go pick up Coulson, Clint and Graves together. Peter walked out of the bedroom with his Spider-man suit on.
“There you go, your own berries,” Tony said.  Indy reached in immediately getting oatmeal mush and berry pieces in the palm of his hand and not so neatly attempting to then get it in his mouth.  “Someone’s going to need a good bath, huh?” As soon as the word left his mouth he knew he messed up. Steve made eye contact with him but they both hoped Indy hadn’t noticed.
“Good boy,” he said offhandedly, but Tony beamed. He kept his thumb out, presumably so Bucky would remember his next task. Luckily, the room they were locked in was not a cell, so they did have some things available to them. There was a counter along one wall with a sink so he brought Tony over there, turning him in his arms so he was facing out, and turned on the warm water. There was no soap but he helped Tony wash his hands as best they could. he found a box of tissues in a cupboard and grabbed a handful then dried Tony’s hands.
Tony moved his head slightly to give Bucky a small smile and nod and a little wave to the kids. Steve hugged him closer and pressed a kiss to his hair.
Tony, looking a bit flustered and like he was hiding something, cleared his throat and quickly gathered up the papers. “Okay, I’m going to head back to work and have Pepper finalize all this with legal.”
“Thank you,” Bucky said sincerely. “I have to go somewhere, Indy. You’re gonna hang out with Happy for a little while.” They entered the elevator.
“Yay!” Indy exclaimed, excitedly clapping when he sensed the serious part was over. Everyone laughed and joined in to clap.
“Tater Tot, hey. I’m sorry, baby.” Tony took him from Bucky and went back to the armchair, cuddling his boy in his arms. “Is he okay now?”
“All right, come on,” Steve said as he placed Indy on his own two feet and stood himself. “Let’s go pick out a new shirt.” Steve headed to Indy’s room with the boy trailing behind him and opened his dresser drawer. “What do you think about this one?” Steve held up a little red t-shirt with the arc reactor image in the center. “You can be like Daddy today.”
“Turn around slowly,” Bucky said menacingly. He saw her jump slightly at the sound of his voice.  “Hands up.” She did as she was told, turning to face him. He saw the recognition once he was in her sight.
“She seems okay all things considered. I kissed her cheek and she didn’t know what to make of that.” Tony sighed and Steve looked sadly at her as he reached out to hold the hand that was patting Tony. She gripped his finger for a second but then pulled it away to grab back on to Tonys shirt.
The elevator beeped and Tony stepped into the workshop, placed the fruit on the counter near his coffee maker which JARVIS had blessedly started already, and then walked across to the other side. “Hey, Dum-E, it’s morning and we have a guest, buddy. Look alive,” he called out. Dum-E beeped and whirred as his metal claw turned to face Tony’s direction. Tony felt Indy stiffen in his arms but also raised his head to see what this was. “It’s okay, Indy,” Tony assured him.
“You need to heal, Tony. A few days at least, I think, but we can ask the doctor next time they’re in.” He heard Tony whimper, still hiding his face, and Steve felt the slight tremors as he worked himself up. “Hey, it’ll be okay. I’ll stay here the whole time, okay?” Steve pressed a kiss to Tony’s temple and ran his hand up and down Tony’s bicep.
“Hey, hey. Tony. It’s only been a little over a day and yeah you’ve spent all your time with her but someone had to and she likes you best. He’s just a toddler that doesn’t understand. You’ll explain everything and he’ll be fine, okay?”
“Hey,” she said softly, kissing his cheek and hugging him. “Hi, Luca.” She waved a finger at him. “You know we’ll come right back the second you want us to, or you can come down and get him. We’ll basically just be in another room,” she assured him.
Sometimes he just couldn’t get his mind to turn off, and hours on end in the workshop filled with caffeine and no food would begin to affect him. Tonight, Steve decided, he had to put an end to Tony’s latest 72-hour work binge.
He gasped dramatically. “Indy! Were you the reindeer the whole time? Unbelievable. You had me fooled.” Tony picked him and sat him on his hip.  “You want some waffles?” Indy nodded quickly. “Well, we better go then before Bucky eats them all on you.” Indy eyes went wide believing that might happen.
"I made Mac and cheese," he announced. "I'm not a great cook but I think I've perfected this at least." He smiled hopefully.
“I’ll get you some ginger ale and some crackers when we’re done talking, okay? That might help.” He still had doubts as to if he was really sick or just upset but either way it wouldn’t hurt. Indy nodded. “Papa also told me that you weren’t sure if I was going to be your daddy anymore.”
“Yeah,” he replied simply. Tony sighed and turned to the side a little so he was slightly facing Indy but still sitting up. He brought his hand over and started to rub small circles on the boys stomach over the blanket.
The diaper rash was pretty bad but it was clear that Tony had been doing all he could to keep him as clean and dry as possible. There were bruises near his armpits where the captors roughly grabbed him so often. Steve’s jaw clenched seeing what they did to his young son but he kept his touch light and soothing.
“Da,” Indy repeated and held his arms out. Tony took him and gave him a hug and Indy reached around Tony. “Pa hug.”
I have a general plot for this but if there’s any day to day things you wanna see happen in the story with the boys, drop it in the comments! :)
Steve and Tony sat with their son at their table watching as their friends gathered at theirs, everyone chatting and laughing and generally having a good time.
“Yeah, she wants Bucky to go in since Indy wanted to do he puzzle with him.” Bucky stepped up next to Tony.
“Perfect,” Steve replied instantly. “I was just explaining to him that he was going to hang out with his Auntie for a little while. He seemed agreeable to that.”
“So, who’s the kid?” Tony started when no one else seemed to know what to say. “Or better yet, why aren’t you trying to kill us?” Bucky winced, staring down at the table. The young boy in his lap, chest to chest.
“Sir,” JARVIS called out, deciding to intervene. “Indy seems to be distressed.” Tony whipped his head toward the little boy, already out of his chair and walking to the sofa.
“Of course I’ll help,” Bucky replied. He tore the corner off of the package and handed it back to the boy who seemed to be getting more into it and easily tore the rest of the wrap off.
“Yeah I smile like this!” Indy smiled wide, showing all his teeth, eyes squinted shut and Bucky snapped a pic.
“I’m sorry, Clint.” Steve tried really hard not to laugh. Clint took the little hand in his and shook.
“Tony?” Steve called softly as he walked closer from where he had stopped in the doorway. Tony’s head snapped up to look at his husband. “I’m sorry, Bubba. I’m so sorry. I have no right to rush you. You need to heal. You and Luca. If you need to keep him close there’s nothing wrong with that.” He dropped down to his knees before Tony once again. “I love you both so much. I can’t leave Tony, I can’t.” Tony broke hearing that. He started crying and Peter nervously stood up.
Tony agreed. “I think it will good for him. And we might learn some things that we really should know.” Tony took Steve’s hand in his. “Come on.” He led them to the living room where Indy was showing Bucky how his llama can ride on a toy car. “Time to go, Munchkin. Say goodbye to Bucky.” Indy put the car on the coffee table but held his llama tight as he ran into Bucky’s knees and grabbed on tight.
Steve took it and held it to Tony’s lips. “Take a small sip and I’ll tip it okay?” Steve slowly lifted the cup and Tony sipped the juice, licking his lips when Steve pulled the cup back.
Annie nodded knowingly. “I hear you, but in this case I think what he needed most when he was rescued was a stable home with caring people and to know that the bad things weren’t going to happen anymore. And you gave him that. So however out of your depth you may have felt, I do want to assure you that you are giving him exactly what he needs. And this therapy is just an extension of that.
“You’re not,” Steve responded with a kiss to the top of Tony’s hair. Tony shrugged. Steve held him tighter and turned his attention back to Bucky who was just finishing up the story. Indy clapped when Bucky said ‘The End.’
“He’s not gonna want me here and I get that. He shouldn’t have to deal with me being here, it’s his home. His whole building.”
“Well, I do,” Steve said quickly. “I would never keep you from Indy. You saved his life, Buck. He wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for you. So, just, hang out a bit, okay? Don’t leave.”  Bucky nodded and headed for the kitchen.
“ ‘Uddle,” Indy agreed. He sunk down further into Tony’s arms, one hand clutching the blanket and one wrapped around Tony’s side. The llama stuffed firmly between them. He was blinking heavily but clearly fighting sleep.
“You could have had JARVIS tell me to come up,” Tony said, though not accusingly because Steve had no reason to think Tony would have been receptive to that. “I’m sorry I missed that. How long’s he been asleep?”
Steve took Indy from Bucky then grabbed Tony’s hand and they walked hand in hand back down the aisle.
“Yup. Go save your kid from the master assassin.” Steve turned his head to reply angrily but thought better of it. The situation was just escalating. Instead, he decided to pick upon the other portion of what Tony had said.  “Our kid, Tony.” Tony didn’t reply but he did turn to look. Steve went upstairs.
“I’m gonna grab my gear from the kids room and then go back to my rooms and shower and change. I’ll check in on you later.”
“Here, lick it.” He held it in front of Indy’s mouth who very cautiously stuck his tongue out and touched it to the candy but didn’t move. Tony smiled and moved the candy around so he could get the taste. “It’s called a candy cane. It’s mint flavor. You like it?”
“I’m glad you’re here, Buck.” Bucky startled as he met Steve’s gaze. “I don’t know if you have plans elsewhere, but, if you want, you can stay here.”
“Hey, Tator Tot. This is our friend, Happy. Can you say hi?” Indy looked over but then hid his face on Steve’s shoulder. He waved his little hand out behind him in greeting instead. Happy laughed and opened the back door.
“Okay, I think we’re done. Ready to get out?” Steve asked Indy, who responded immediately by lifting his arms up.
“Okay buddy, got something to tell ya,” Bucky said as he lifted the boy and placed him back on his lap, sideways facing Steve.
Steve nodded. “Of course. Honestly, we told Bucky to end it if it became too much so that’s why he did. I hope you were okay with that, but he’s just been through so much.”
Steve walked down nervously a short time later. Tony felt a little smug that he at least wasn't comfortable at the moment.
“It’s nice you got him something,” Steve said, turning his attention back to Bucky. “Of course you can give it to him.”
“J, go though the data Bucky brought back with him again. We’re looking for anything at all that can give us a lead. Pull satellite scans of the location Indy was found on the day and time Bucky was there. Anyone that escaped we need to track down,” Tony called out.
“Uh, no, thanks. I just wanted to see, um.” Bucky cut off the rest of his sentence because Tony walked in at that moment and made a beeline to the coffee maker Steve was in front of.
“I got this, take care of the llama,” he said, already putting a bunch of paper towels down on the mess with the help of Bruce.
“Okay, stop,” Tony insisted. “We’re not getting anywhere. He needs a time out so lets just go upstairs and do that.”
“Let me know if there’s any other issues but I’ll get what you need from the medical and send it up for you.”
“Ah-ma,” Indy mumbled around the sippy cup spout. Bucky dug around under the blanket and pulled the llama out and placed it in the crook of Indy’s arm. Steve began to read the book and it wasn’t long before Indy’s eyes began to slowly close. The sippy cup fell from his mouth and Tony grabbed it before it could fall to the floor. He handed it off to Bucky and pushed the pacifier back between his lips. Indy started suckling anxiously in his sleep, the pacifier moving quickly as they watched. Tony rocked him gently trying to soothe him. Steve stopped reading and put his hand on Indy’s stomach, patting softly, then moved up to the pacifier and held his finger on it to slow the movement for a minute. “Calm down, baby,” he whispered. Indy snuffled, eyes still closed, and sighed around the now still pacifier. After a moment, Steve let go and Indy seemed to have calmed.
“It’s perfect, Tony. I know it’s just for fun but you are her favorite and that’s okay,” he laughed. “She loves me too, I’m okay with sharing.” Bucky got on the floor across from Steve and Indy and grabbed another of Indy’s gifts from Santa. “Here, your turn.” Indy took it but then looked back at him.
“Yeah. It does.” Steve reached over Indy so that his arm was over the boy and hand resting on Tony’s stomach. He rubbed his thumb over Tony’s t-shirt and shifted slightly closer. As close as he could get with their son still between them. He turned on the movie but they both drifted off shortly after, completely content.
“I want Papa. Now, Buppy.” He moved forward quickly and pushed his hands against Bucky’s thighs in an attempt to shove him.  Bucky didn’t move.
“I hate to even think this but maybe he has some bad memories of being strapped down?” Tony asked hesitantly.
“Please? I can’t move to scoot over but I think you’ll fit.” Tony looked so sad and sincere that Steve couldn’t say no. He managed to wedge himself next to Tony with enough of his body not hanging off the bed that he didn’t think he’d tip off. He sat up higher on the bed than Tony so his head was just above his and faced him on his side. He leaned in and kissed Tony’s head, their hands still clasped between their bodies. “Rest more, sweetheart.”
“I don’t know, darling. But I’m not going anywhere. I’m here with you and Indy, okay? Forever, like we promised.” He pushed Steve back so he could look in his eyes. Steves face was wet with tears and Tony used his sleeve to wipe his cheeks. “We’ll figure it out,” Tony told him as he nodded to reassure his boyfriend.
“I think the less people here the better so Indy can focus but I truly think Bucky could be helpful during this session.”
Tony shook his head against Steve’s chest. “I’m okay, really. I just hope he comes around because I do think she should live here. I’m just more worried he’ll want to put her up for adoption.” Steve pushed back to look at him.
“How old is he?” Steve asked quietly after a moment. Tony moved to open the file but Bucky answered before he had to.
“Da, for me,” he said, showing Tony the blue shirt by shoving it toward the man’s face. Tony laughed.
“You did hurt Daddy, that’s one thing. Definitely the biggest thing. You also didn’t listen and were misbehaving. But why did you hurt Daddy? Did you want to hurt him?” Steve asked, cringing at the question because he shouldn’t have to ask his toddler that, but he honestly needed the answer. He grew up with Hydra so it’s not out of the realm of possibility that Indy thought his reaction was acceptable.
“Don’t remind me, kiddo. I’m trying to get her to sleep,” Bucky replied. “Maybe she’ll go down if she sees you in bed? You’re a big boy, she looks up to you.” Bucky was laying it on thick and Tony glanced over and smirked at him but Indy was considering it.
“Trial and error,” Bucky shrugged. Steve knelt up again and placed Indy over the water. He waited for the protest but when none came slowly lowered his son into the water.
“I’m your papa right? Because you’re my boy, you were made from part of me. And me and Tony are a couple and he became your dad because he loves you more than anything, right?”
“Lay back, buddy.” Indy laid down and Steve pulled out a baby wipe and wiped off his chest in case there was any residual smoothie stickiness. He pulled the elastic waist jeans off of him and checked the pull up he was wearing. It was damp. He had been getting better at the potty training and would tell them when he had to go but he still had accidents and Steve assumed that, today at least, he probably had his accident during his standoff with Tony. He pulled off the pull up and wiped him clean. “Do you need to go anymore before I put the new one on?”
Tony reached in to the box and pulled out the blanket. It was navy blue with small white anchors all over it. It was incredibly soft and warm. Pepper took the empty box and Tony pulled Indy more sideways on his lap and threw the blanket over the both of them.
“Don’t worry, you can hold him a little while longer,” and even though that’s what he wanted to hear, her tone was ominous. “We’re going to record a little video for your hubby.” The man had a small video recorder in his hands that he was turning on and focusing on Tony. “What you don’t know is that you have been filmed this whole time, so we can keep an eye on you of course, but also so we could send the Avengers a livestream. So, if they even care, they’ll already know what’s happened to you.” Tonys eyes narrowed and he glanced around but couldn’t see another camera. She ignored the fact that he was looking. “I’m going to make my demands and you’re going to sit there and be good or I will take that baby out of this room and you won’t get to see him again.” Tony gave a small nod but couldn’t help the shiver that ran through him at her words.
“No. Tony, no. Don’t say that. This was not your fault at all.” Tony was nodding trying to persuade him it was his fault but Steve kept talking. “These assholes were mad at Shield, you were just a means to get to them. You did nothing wrong. In fact, you were so good Tony. I saw pretty much everything. You took care such good care of Luca.” Tony huffed in disagreement. “You did” Steve continued. “You did everything you could for him, I’m so proud of you and I love you so much.” He stood up and leaned over Tony so he could hug him and kiss him again. Then did the same for Luca. “Papa’s here baby boy. We’re going to get you feeling better I promise.”
“You would notice that.” Tony sighed. “I was going to be the one to come and find you but when I told Indy he’d be staying with Bucky he had a complete meltdown. I couldn’t leave him and Bucky stepped up and did it. No questions asked. I mean, of course he would, you guys are best friends, but it meant a lot. I knew I could trust him to do it, even though I wanted to go myself.”
“Not right now, Peanut. Papa has to sleep and we’re going to go in the other room for now.” He stood up and headed to the kitchen with Bucky following. Tony sat at one of the stools on the kitchen island and Bucky got some juice out of the fridge to pour in Indy’s sippy cup.
“Well, we’re gonna make sure we say hi and talk to everyone today, not just Bucky,” Steve replied. He pushed Indy’s food toward Tony so he could help the boy and he got up to get the package of blueberries out of the fridge for his boyfriend to snack on but also because Indy seemed to want to eat what Tony was eating at any given time, and he seemed to like blueberries last time he tried them. He opened the pack and placed them in front of Tony who instantly grabbed a handful and filled his mouth. Indy saw and reached out so Tony handed him one berry. Indy all but threw it in his mouth to copy Tony causing his parents to laugh.
“No,” Indy answered, sadly. He gripped the front of Steve’s t-shirt in his hand. “No, please,” he repeated.
Steve came into the room, taking in the situation quickly and approaching the two men. He pulled out a zip tie and waved it at them. “You get everything you need from her?”
“Fury, I swear to god. You can’t stop me, I can fly in there in the suit and blast them all to hell and get him out,” he insisted angrily.
“Fine.” Tony stood up. “It’s his nap time so I’m going to try to sleep too.” Tony bent to place a quick kiss on top of Luca’s head and then left the room. Luca gurgled and waved his hand so Steve caught it and put his finger in his sons grip. Luca squeezed gently and Steve smiled at him.
“Good night, buddy,” Steve said, leaning in and pressing a soft kiss on his sons cheek. They laid there quietly for awhile as Indy’s breath evened out and they were sure he was asleep. Steve met Tony’s gaze and smiled. “I have a son.”
“Indiana Grant Rogers.” Steve’s voice was stern and serious and it was clear from Indy’s bewildered expression that he had never heard that one before. “You do not hit people. You know that because your Dad just told you this morning.” Indy, who looked so headstrong and angry moments before, was now wavering between confusion and fear.
“In a good way, I hope,” Steve said, unable to keep some of the insecurity out of his voice. “I like being domestic with you.”
“What?” Steve said loudly, exasperated. “Jesus, Tony. I didn’t say anything like that and frankly It’s insulting that you even think you still have to say that to me.” He sidestepped Tony and picked Indy up off the ground from where he was still curled up mid-tantrum. He wanted to leave the workshop, take his son and go upstairs, calm him down and get some space from Tony but he knew that would make things worse in the end. He carried Indy to the sofa instead, the small boy letting his whole body go limp so it was hard for Steve to keep a good grip on him. “Indy,” he huffed quietly. He plopped him down on the sofa and sat next to him.
After giving Tony a bath and putting his pajamas on he tucked him and his teddy into bed. Tony looked sad so he sat on the edge of his bed, rubbing soothing circles on Tony’s tummy. “Something wrong, sweetheart?”
The table had an Avengers tablecloth over it with Avengers paper plates, cups, napkins and party hats set at each place setting. A banner saying ‘happy birthday’ was hanging on one wall and there were a couple more balloons scattered throughout the living room.
“Yeah. We can take her temperature to be sure. I’ll grab the thermometer,” Steve said as he stood and went to get it from the bathroom.
In the living area he found Bucky watching a movie on TV and Indy asleep with his head in Bucky’s lap. Steve smiled despite his bad mood now.
Steve sat back and looked at the two men on the sofa. “Was this a mistake?” Before either could answer Steve stood abruptly. “You know what, never mind. I’m going to put him in his bed for a nap.” He took his son from Tony’s arms and swiftly left the room. Tony sighed.
“Wow. Thank you Indy, that’s very nice of you,” Bucky said, stepping forward so he was within reach and kissing the blonde hair on the little boys head. “I’m sure she’ll love I when she wakes up.”
Steve started wiping her down with the wet wipes from her belly button down to her knees to make sure he got all traces of urine. She whined and tried to turn around to face Tony. “Hold on, almost done,” Steve told her. He patted her dry with the clean tissues. “Okay Tony, turn her around.” Tony picked her up so her feet were resting on his chest and he held her up in front of his face as Steve washed down her backside.
“I got a few ouchies but I’ll be okay soon.” Tony smiled at Steve’s wording. “Wanna come cuddle with us? I’ve missed you.” Indy nodded hesitantly and Bucky carefully placed him half on Tony and half on the bed in the small space between the two men, fixing his blanket so it draped over the three of them. Indy clung on to Steve instantly and Steve returned the gesture.
"I'm sorry about your parents," Bucky said softly. Tony froze. He didn't look up. He couldn't. He closed his eyes and tried not to hyperventilate. Once he trusted himself to speak he shook his head.
“I finished up and shut everything down and go to pick him up and he’s a got a hammer and he’s pretending to fix Dum-E’s wheels. So I told him it’s not a toy, he could get hurt and to hand it over. He kept yelling no and I finally had to just grab hold of him and snatch the hammer away but he swung out and,” Tony hesitated.
Steve turned back to the stove and turned the burner off, took the pan and poured the noodle soup in to a small bowl. He left it on the counter to cool a little and turned back to Tony. “What would you pick? For a middle name?”
Indy smiled. “Love Da,” he said softly. “And ah-ma!” he added louder, giggling. Tony laughed with him, feeling now that they really would be okay.
“Okay, okay,” Bucky held his hands out for Steve to slow down. “You need to calm down yourself. Everyone does,” he added, looking pointedly at Indy. “Come here,” he held his arms out and Indy gratefully leaned into them.
Steve and Tony re-entered the living area and Steve plopped down on the sofa next to them. “Pa pa pa pa,” Indy said happily as if he was singing it. Bucky smiled.
Today he had a meeting with Fury, Thor and Banner to go over what they’ve come up with in their respective research into how to get Tony Stark back to his real age. Clint was going to babysit. Steve didn’t expect any issues. Tony was a well behaved little boy for the most part.
“Some toys,” Steve laughed. “Come here, sweetheart.” Steve pulled Indy from Tony’s arms. “Get dressed, Tony, and then we’ll go. Do you need to pee, buddy?” Indy looked at him blankly. Steve took him into the adjoining bathroom while Tony changed out of his pajamas in the bedroom. Steve slid Indys pants down and pulled the diaper off temporarily. He picked him up and placed him not the seat, holding him up since he was too small. He showed him how to aim in the toilet. “Go ahead, try to pee like a big boy so you don’t use that diaper.” Indy looked down, seemingly confused then back at Steve. “You don’t have to go?” Indy shook his head.
Hearing Bucky speak so genuinely about the situation actually made Tony second guess his freeze out of Rogers.
“Mr. Rogers do you think it would be okay if Bucky sat in for a few minutes instead? I know Indy wanted him to help with the puzzle and it might help since he was the one who found Indy as far as leading the questions?”
“Who’s DNA? Bucky’s?” Bruce guessed. Steve looked over to Bucky but he was already shaking his head no.
Indy shot up straight in Steve’s arms and the three men collectively chuckled. “Well, you said the magic word there,” Tony added. “This one loves puzzles,” he told her, ruffling the boys hair.
"I can look, no promises though. Wakandan tech might as well be alien." Tony gestured at Bucky to the stool next to his work bench. "Sit."
Twenty minutes later Jarvis announced that Tony was waking. Steve went out to the living room  and saw the boy blinking his eyes open nervously.
“That’s just it though,” Bucky said louder. “Why should I? I am the last thing that any kid needs in their life, especially a little baby.”
“Hey, baby Cap. Can I hold you?” Clint reached out and Indy allowed himself to be pulled from Tony’s lap. “How’s your llama doing?” Indy held his llama out in front of Clint’s face.
“Hey. It is. You went through a traumatic few days and your body is just readjusting. I bet it was hard to go to the bathroom at first right where they had you tied up, huh? Because your body didn’t want to go there, but eventually you had no choice so you had to let go. Now, you don’t have to do that but you’re adjusting. Your body will remember to keep control, just give it a little bit of time.” Tony put his hand back on his thigh and this time Steve didn’t flinch. “Especially once the serum kicks in again you’ll be so much better.” Steve nodded.
“Not Captain America. Steve. Steve Rogers, my boyfriend, and the sweetest, kindest, person I know. That guy can do this.” Steve smiled.  “Come on, get in bed.” Tony reached behind Steve and pulled the sheet back. Steve climbed in, laying on his back, and Tony went around and got in his side, scooting close to Steve and resting his hand on Steve’s chest. “Get some rest, sweetheart.”
“Sirs,” JARVIS interrupted. “Indy seems to be awake now.”  Tony let his forehead rest against Steve’s for a moment with a smile. Steve gave him a quick peck on his cheek and then threw the sheets back and got out of bed.
“If you want him back to sleep with just let me know.” Bucky leaned back, kicked his feet up again and put the llama on his chest. Indy looked pleased with that and Tony smirked.
“Hi, baby girl,” he cooed, placing his palm on her tummy and rubbing softly. She made little happy noises and then sneezed. Tony chuckled, “Oh boy, God bless you.” She sneezed again and he moved his head from Bucky’s shoulder. “Okay, if you weren’t so cute that would be gross.” He grabbed a tissue from the end table and wiped her nose.
Steve agreed right away. “Yeah, tomorrow sounds good. You know I’m not trying to make this harder on you right?”
“I meant that he did this, although you could have led with the fact that you were injured.” Tony shrugged.
“We know, buddy,” Steve replied, hugging his son close. He wiped Indy’s tears with his sleeve. “All right, calm down baby boy. Let’s try to have a good rest of the day, huh? Right Tony?”
Steve and the doctor had tried to convince Tony to pump so that they could have a supply of milk on hand so that Steve could handle some of the feedings but Tony outright refused. He kept saying that he was a hundred percent committed to his son and didn’t feel like he needed to pump because what else would he be doing that was more important than feeding Luca?  Steve had pointed out that the answer to that question was that there was a lot that Tony would need to be doing and sharing the responsibility with Steve would make everything easier. Tony’s only goal was to be better to his son than his parents were to him and he was taking a stand on this pumping issue, however irrational, so Steve had let it go for the week. But now....
“Tony’s exhausted. And irritable, and I don’t blame him,” he hurried to add. “I need some time with him, just us, to talk and relax. Even it’s just a couple hours which is probably all we’ll get between feeds. But, if Luca’s in the other room Tony won’t relax fully, he’ll want to check on him or have me do it. If you could just hang out with Luca on the communal floor for a couple hours tops it would be a huge help.”
“I will be safe, kiddo.” He kissed the top of his head, nodded to Tony and left. Tony picked Indy up and cuddled him to his chest swaying slightly.
“Maybe. Probably. She’ll be okay no matter what, you know that right?” Tony asked, because Bucky absolutely did not look like he knew that. He shrugged in response. “You’re fine aren’t you Poppy seed?” She waved her little arms at him and he grabbed one hand and slotted his finger into her grip. She squeezed it and didn’t let go as she kept up a string of gurgles and baby sounds which he nodded along to as if he understood her story.
To be fair, Tony did behave. They had gone to buy decorations together but Steve honestly believed that Tony would have ordered more without his knowledge, but he hadn’t. Everything was Avengers themed which Steve had resisted at first but Tony thought it would be funny and since Indy didn’t really have any interests yet they had to pick something for him.
“Come here you.” He reached out and pulled his son toward him and lifted him onto his lap and hugged him, the bears squished between them. “That’s very sweet. Dad’s going to love his bear. Now, did you tell Auntie Pepper thank you for buying them?” Indy nodded and Steve glanced at her to double check but she nodded and winked knowingly.
Tony and Indy spent the morning together and, at Indy’s insistence, Bucky joined them for lunch. It was during their meal that Tony got a call from Fury.
Steve grabbed a bowl of Mac and cheese for himself and with a nod to Bucky he headed back to the stairs to return to the main floor. Tony sighed and rolled his eyes, swirling around on his stool to face Steve. "You might as well eat it here. If you want."
Steve smiled at that. “You can make it up to me by getting better.” He kissed Tony’s forehead. “I love you, too.”
“Hi baby boy,” Tony said gently. “I miss you. You having fun with Pete? Huh?” Luca babbled some nonsense. “Wow, you’ve had a busy day,” Tony answered as if Luca told him a story.
Indy made a whining sound in his sleep and brought his thumb to his mouth. Tony managed to catch it before he put it in and Steve grabbed a pacifier off the end table and tossed it to his boyfriend. Tony gently pushed the pacifier against Indy’s lips and after a few seconds he let it in and began suckling. Tony left his index finger on it to keep it in, hand resting on Indy’s chest.
Steve opened and closed his mouth without answering. Then abruptly stood up causing Indy to flinch back into Bucky’s embrace. “I, uh, I need a minute.” He quickly walked out of the room.
Rhodey stepped forward. “Thank you,” he said and shook the doctors hand. The doctor nodded and left them to talk.
Satisfied that he felt okay with the situation now, Tony decided to feed Indy. “Okay lets cut up this banana for you for breakfast. I know you didn’t feel well last night so we’ll start with this and you can have some more food later, sound good?” Indy nodded. Tony placed him on the sofa and Dum-E followed and parked himself next to it. Tony grabbed the banana and cut it up and put the pieces on a small plate which he then placed in front of Indy. “Think you can handle that?”
He grabbed Poppy’s brush and combed his hair, parted on the side. He reached into the bag he had brought with them and grabbed some hair product, rubbing a small amount between his palms and then through the boys hair, hoping it would help it to stay neat until the ceremony. “Okay, you’re all ready. Looking good, kid.” Indy clapped excitedly.
“Yeah,” Steve agreed. “Okay, so 2T.” He wheeled the cart back to a table of tees. “Wanna pick out some shirts? Which ones do you like?” Steve pointed at the choices. He could see Tony  pulling things off of racks excitedly and Steve tried to ignore his extravagance. “Here,” Steve said, picking up a blue shirt with planets on it. “You like this?” Steve held it up to Indy’s chest. “Looks nice.”
“I know he’s in diapers at the moment, but look at all these packs of underwear,” Tony held up 3 for Steve to see. One pack with a Spider-Man theme, one with robots and one with trucks. Tony’s hands hovered over the cart looking for Steve’s permission to buy them.
Someone from Shield had left a pair of gray sweatpants and a gray Shield sweatshirt on the table off to the side so that was helpful because Steve’s suit was destroyed and the undershirt and boxers he had under it were such a mess they were trashed as soon as they got them off his body.
“No, it’s okay. I don’t mind, we’ve gotta work to get him past this, it’s just gonna take some time. Why don’t you start with some of the decorations while we’re in the other room?”
Annie was nodding. “I understand completely. I’m fine with the sessions being cut short in situations like this, we can just see how each appointment goes and adjust accordingly. We have that flexibility here so please don’t worry about that at all.” She pulled her notebook closer. “Having said that, I do think we had an informative session as far as first ones go.”
“Something he said made me think,” Bucky paused. “I don’t know, I could be reading more in to this than there is but when we were leaving the park he was saying he wanted the baby and the baby was his friend, he wanted the baby safe,” Bucky trailed off and shrugged. “Like maybe he’s speaking from experience.”
Steve nodded, draining the rest of the juice and putting the empty bottle on the table in front of him. “They’re going to operate. They have to,” he answered softly.
“Nope, not til Annie says it’s time. Be patient,” Steve told him with a smile toward the therapist. Then he introduced her to Bucky as well.
A few minutes in the baby let out a small whine and grumble, balling her small fists against Bucky’s chest. Bucky shushed her and patted her back gently.
A doctor came out soon after looking for Tony and let him know that Steve had awoken and he could come back. Bucky agreed to keep Indy with him so Tony passed his blanket back and went with the doctor who led him to an exam room where Steve was laying on a stretcher, electrodes stuck to his chest monitoring vitals and an IV in his arm. The head of the bed was tilted up a little so Steve could see when Tony entered. He gasped and his eyes instantly filled with tears. The doctor left them alone.
“Guess I’m too late for this party, huh?” Steve asked as he walked in, smiling at the sight. Tony hummed.
“There’s one for all the basics,” Bruce added. “One for numbers, colors, animals, food and stuff. I figured he could catch up on all the basic things while also doing the puzzles.”
"Yeah, okay." Bucky reached up to his shoulder and pressed the release mechanisms, twisted it a little and then it released. He placed it on the table gently.
“That’s right, sweet boy. He’ll be safe with us, just like you. Come here,” Steve readjusted the boy in his hold and hugged him tight, shirt and teddy bear squished between them. Tony found them like that a moment later.
“Wow,” Steve said once he entered the room. “It looks great, Tony.” Tony actually blushed which Steve found adorable so he kissed him before taking Indy. “Look at all the nice decorations Daddy put out for your birthday, buddy.”
Steve shrugged. “But we know. I think he’s got pretty good timing, don’t you bug? That’s just what we wanted to hear today. All right, get your boxers off Tony and get in. I’ll hand him to you.” Tony sat gingerly in the warm bubbly water and held out his hands. Steve pulled the blanket off of Luca and handed him over. Tony sat the boy on this thigh and Luca splashed at the bubbles. Steve pushed his bright yellow rubber duck over to him and Luca laughed like it was the funniest thing he’d ever seen.
“It’s true. And he needs you.” Steve sat up a little straighter, wiping his eyes with the back of his knuckles.
“That’s right, buddy. Let’s go see,” Steve replied. They brought him to the living room where the previous night they set up his gift on the coffee table. Indy gasped and struggled to get down once he caught site of it so Steve placed him on his feet. He immediately went to and grabbed the plush which was an orange cat holding a red heart.
“I’m not going anywhere I just have a better idea, let go for one sec.” Steve reluctantly released his hold and Tony climbed on the bed with him. “Can you scoot over just a little?” Steve did and Tony situated himself so he was higher up on the bed than Steve. Once he settled he opened his arms and Steve leaned into him, his head now pillowed on Tony’s chest and his arms around his waist holding tight. Tony brought one hand up to card through Steve’s hair and the other held the arm that was resting against his stomach. “I’ve got you.” Steve hissed as Tony’s fingers trailed over a sore spot on the back of his neck. “Sorry, sorry.” Tony looked down and the parts of Steve that he could see not covered in clothing or the blanket and winced. There were cuts and bruises everywhere. He knew the serum would kick in once the drug wore off but he had to be hurting a lot now.
He heard a cry from his son and opened his eyes immediately. There was a table about 8 feet away from him against a wall and on it Luca laid on his back, hands and feet moving in agitation. There was a raised lip around the table, hopefully enough that he wouldn’t be able to roll off of it.
“Sir, the items you ordered have been delivered. I’m sending them up in the elevator,” Jarvis announced.
Steve passed Indy back to Bucky once they were in the bathroom and grabbed the baby body wash. He filled the sink with water and soap and watched it bubble up. “We’re gonna wash him really good, sweetheart. He’s not hurt, I promise.” Indy’s sobs had quieted some, but they had turned into a more pitiful whimper that broke Steve’s heart. When the sink was full he turned off the tap and put the llama in the water. He soaked it and squeezed out the dirty water, scrubbed, rinsed and soaked again. He repeated this about four times until the fur looked just about what it looked like before. “Look, baby. He’s all better.” Indy looked, rubbing his eyes. Bucky grabbed a tissue and dried the tears and wiped his nose.
“He’s really yours,” he pointed to Steve’s name on the birth certificate to illustrate his point. “We do need to fill in a full name for him though so that can be filed. I know it’s been a hectic few days but now that things are kind of settling I think you need to come up with a name.”
“I love you.” Steve kissed the side of his head and then uncapped the orange juice. “Drink a little of this for me?” Tony pulled his head up and took the bottle, sipping slowly. He handed it back when he couldn’t drink anymore. “Why don’t you close your eyes? We’ve got maybe an hour left. Make the most of it,” he smiled.
JARVIS woke Steve with an announcement that Pepper was at the door. “Let her in,” he said tiredly. “How long were we asleep?”
“I’ll probably keep snapping at you. At least until this kid’s out of diapers. You sure that sounds so great to you?” Steve knew Tony was joking, he laughed when he said it, but he also knew Tony’s insecurities could rare their ugly head at any moment so he didn’t laugh. He held Tony’s eye contact.
Steve brought 2 steaming mugs of cocoa for Tony and Bucky then went back and got his own and a smaller cup for Indy with cold milk splashed in it to cool it down. He resumed his seat and pulled all the mugs in front of him. Indy leaned closer to Steve’s shoulder to watch.
"Thanks, punk," Bucky said. Steve grinned and went back to the tray, scooping noodles into another bowl.
Steve approached quietly so as not to startle either of them and once he got Tony’s attention he held the water out for him to see then placed it on the end table next to his chair. “Hydrate,” Steve said simply. Tony nodded but continued his murmurings to his son while he gently rubbed and patted his little back.
“Thank you,” Steve answered softly. “I’m sorry too.”  Steve scooted to the end of the bed moving so his legs dangled off the end and Tony stood in between them. Tony took his hands out of his pockets and placed them on the top of Steve’s head, lightly scratching his fingers through the blonde hair. Steve leaned into Tony, pressing his face into Tony’s stomach and melting into the touch.
“Indy, I know this might be hard to do, but I’d like to talk a little about the people you were with before your Papa.”
“Okay, okay. I’ll talk to them, we’ll figure this out. I’m almost there, just hold on. Everything’s gonna be fine.” He heard the hitch in Steve’s breath. “Happy’s going to watch the kids until we can figure out what’s happening.”
“Oh,” Tony sighed. “Yes. Papa and I are coming back. That’s why I have to go. He’s a little lost and I’m going to go find him and bring him home.” He heard his phone ping, the text from Fury with their location. Tony kissed Indy’s forehead. “Ok, here,” he gestured to Bucky to take the boy and Indy screamed.
“No. I come,” he answered, already pushing the blanket off and scooting over to the side of the bed where Tony was standing.
“Yeah just in case,” Tony nodded. “Here, I’ll help.” He stood Indy up in the seat, keeping hold of his waist so he wouldn’t fall. Indy twisted to look at him.
“Let’s look at you, Tater Tot.” Tony stood him on the bed and kept hold of his hand to steady him while he and Steve stepped back to look. Steve went back into the bathroom and got the baby comb, came back and brushed Indy’s still damp dirty blonde hair with a part off to the side and then neatly combing it into place.
“Out,” Indy stated to make sure Steve knew what he wanted. Steve grabbed a fluffy towel and picked Indy up with it, making sure he was wrapped up. He had sat Indy on the counter and made sure he was dry when Tony came back with a small T-shirt and diaper. He handed the shirt to Steve who managed to get it on with minimal fuss and then he took the diaper from Tony.
“Nah, I got this,” Bucky smirked. He used his one free arm to pick Poppy up off the bed and snuggled her against his chest next to Indy. “All right, we’ll come by in the morning. Let Stevie take good care of you,” he aimed at Tony.
“Yeah, you are. Just keep it in mind. I could take care of everything.” Tony clapped his hand on Bucky’s knee.
"Oh god please no, don't apologize for that," Bucky said quickly. "I deserved every bit of that but you didn't." Tony was shocked into silence. "You really didn't," Bucky whispered, repeating the sentiment.
Steve put his feet up onto the coffee table so Tony would be able to lean back slightly on his bent knees. He put his finger in Luca’s gripped and the boy held on tight as he drank nestled in the small space between his fathers chests.
He didn’t miss the message because it didn’t come until well into the evening. JARVIS announced that he had received it and Steve told him to read it out loud. The instructions told them that the coordinates would be delivered the following day. They were to bring Graves to that location and leave him in the designated spot. Tony and Luca were in a locked room that could only be opened remotely and would only be opened once the captors verified Graves was safely away from them.
“Steve, come get your son so I can save this pancake,” Tony called out. Steve came over laughing but took Indy right away so Tony could finish cooking. It was definitely more browned than the others but not too bad. Definitely salvageable with enough syrup.
“I know. I’ll talk to the doctor in a little while, see if we can’t get you out of here before bedtime, okay?” Steve nodded. “You ready to see Indy?”
“I think it’s perfect for her.” Steve reached over and ran his finger over her leg. “Tony can have all the paperwork drawn up for her like he did for Indy.”
“JARVIS told me Indy asked to show me his toy and you said I was working,” Tony sighed, also speaking in hushed tones. “I know sometimes I really will be at work or on a business trip and that’s unavoidable but that wasn’t the case today. And I don’t wanna be that dad who avoids his kid or uses work as an excuse.”
“You do, Tony. But it’ll be over before you know it.” He sprayed the wound without further discussion and it shocked Tony into silence for a minute. Then he started sobbing.
“Ohh, you’re a reindeer. I see. Well, that still doesn’t help me find my son but it’s nice to meet you. Do you work for Santa?”  Indy laughed, pulling at his hood so it covered more of his face. Tony patted him between the antlers then stood up. “Well, Steve if you find Indy please tell him I have waffles in the kitchen that are getting cold.” Steve shook his head at his fiancé as Tony turned to leave the room but Indy lunged forward and grabbed Tony’s leg.
“Great,” Steve agreed sarcastically. “Come on, buddy. Let’s finish getting you ready for bed.”  He picked Indy up and carried him to his and Tony’s bedroom, laying the boy down at the foot of the bed to get the diaper and pants onto him.
“Okay, I’ll explain when I see you, just checking.” He hung up before Steve could ask more questions. He waved a taxi down and climbed in so they could get to a toy store. Once in the doll aisle he set Indy down so he could look around. When he lingered around one in particular a little longer than the others he stepped in. “That ones cute,” he said.
Bucky had spent the morning at the park with Indy while Steve and Tony attended to some Avengers business at the compound.  He stood a few feet behind Indy who was circling the swing set and trying to decide which one he wanted Bucky to push him on.
“I do see. He’s lucky to have a boy like you looking after him, huh?” Indy beamed at that and continued playing with his llama walking it across Clint’s chest and bouncing it on his head. Tony and Clint both saw Bucky coming out of the doors that lead back to the medical area so Clint jumped up with Indy in his arms before he could see him. “Let’s go grab a snack from the vending machine. We’ll be right back.” Clint walked off and Tony was surprised Indy didn’t protest but then he was turning to face Bucky.
“I think we can skip the middle name, huh? That would get confusing for me,” He tickled the boys side. “So, Liam. You like that name? You can keep that or make up your own.” Indy looked down at the doll in his arms.
“Uh, what was that Cap? I can’t hear you... must be the comms... guess I’ll just finish my work here...” Tony trailed off.
“Hi,” Pepper said as she entered the living area. Luca was whining in her arms, waving his little arms in anger. “I think he’s hungry. His diaper is dry and I tried holding him but he won’t calm down.”
Quick little interlude type chapter for Valentine’s Day because I felt like I couldn’t skip the holiday :)
“You were strapped to the bed by your wrists and ankles?” Annie asked to which the boy nodded again. “Thank you for telling me that, Indy. I’m sorry that happened to you. Can you show your Papa how you put one of the pieces on the board?” Grateful for the distraction the boy leaned forward and tried to find the spot that his puzzle piece would fit into.
Tony leaned closer and played a quick kiss on his lips. “You’re allowed to want to hold your son,” Tony said, rolling his eyes. “This ones on me, but it’s over starting now. I don’t want you to leave but I do need to move slowly with this. Hold your son,” he gestured to Luca. “Just stay close?”
Bucky stepped up to Natasha who was still holding a perfectly behaved Poppy. “Hey there baby girl.” He held out his hands and she reached out to him. He brought her to his chest and she cooed and rested her head on his shoulder. “You were so good sitting here with Auntie Tasha, huh?”
“No, but it could have been me. And then you could have been her dad too, like you are with Indy. I think you wanted that,” Steve said softly, pulling Tony closer into a hug.
Music started playing a moment later and Indy, gently prodded by Pepper, started walking up the aisle. He meticulously and painstakingly dropped individual flower petals slowly and evenly. Their friends looked on, smiling and laughing quietly to themselves. Steve shook his head fondly and he and Bucky rolled their eyes when they made eye contact. When Indy started picking up already dropped petals in order to put them in a better location Bucky figured it was time to step in but before he could walk over Tony appeared at the end of the aisle laughing and quickly caught up to his son.
“Thank you,” Tony whispered. Bucky reached out and ran his thumb over the tears on Tony’s closest cheek.
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for reading this! I will be making more standalone stories that feature Indy and Poppy and the rest so I hope you’ll check those out when they come! :)
Tonys head popped out from behind a table where he had been picking up some tools off the floor.  “I don’t think now’s a great time for us to have this conversation, Cap.” Steve rounded the workstation and crouched next to Tony, picking up the last couple stray tools for him.
Steve was shaking his head and pacing again. “Natasha this is everything you don’t do in hostage situations. I already gave them millions of dollars. Now we’re just gonna hand this guy to them and walk away? Wait by a room and hope it unlocks? That’s if Tony and Luca are even there if it does. They’ve been dragging this out to mess with us, who’s to say this isn’t one more big ‘fuck You’ to us and we don’t even get them back,” his voice cracked at the end and he took a deep, stuttering breath.
Steve bent down to kiss Tony on top of his head. “Peter will be happy to see you. He’s been really worried. I mean everyone was, but he stayed with me at home the whole time. Neither of us wanted to leave you alone, as if watching the livestream helped any.” Steve shook his head, exasperated.
“No Buppy. I come see Papa and Da.” He stamped his foot for good measure. Bucky sighed and rearranged Poppy against him.
“You could talk to someone too, you know? I could bring someone in, get them vetted and they could sign an NDA,” Tony offered.
“Maybe we could just eat then,” Tony asked hopefully. Steve sighed. Tony looked up at him through his lashes.
“Well, I’ll play with this one,” Clint said as Indy tried to climb onto his shoulders with fistfuls of Clint’s hair. Steve laughed.
Peter smiled. “I got us some cereal because I can’t cook.” He put down the box and bowls he had in his hands and ran back for the milk.
“You gotta do it, kiddo,” he said, pushing it back. “Try to find the space it goes into.” While he attempted that, JARVIS announced that the rest of the guests had arrived together so Tony went to let them in. Natasha, Clint, Pepper and Happy all entered carrying gifts for the birthday boy.
“Um, did Tony tell you what I told him to?” Steve asked nervously. He didn’t want to get too specific in front of Indy. Tony was already nodding as he walked in from the kitchen with a sippy cup of milk for Indy. Bruce nodded as well.
Tony walked in to Indy’s bedroom, where Steve had already started getting him ready for the day, to see his son dressed as a reindeer. It shouldn’t have come as too much of a surprise since Steve had announced to Tony on December 1st that his one and only mission for the month would be to educate Indy in all things Christmas and Santa. This declaration came after Clint off-handedly mentioned Christmas morning present opening one night during dinner and the boy had no clue what he was talking about.
“I found him in a Hydra base, that’s his file. I was in Indiana, just trying to get away from everything,” he shook his head.
“I can get JARVIS to make a list. The best of the best. And we’ll make them sign an NDA. JARVIS, get started on a list but no hurry. Let me know when you’ve compiled something.”
“That baby is safe because he lives here now, right?” Tony asked. “Was there a real baby before?” Indy shrugged.
Steve smiled. “Come here, sweetheart. Bucky will open that for you but come sit with me for a second.” Steve and Tony were seated on the sofa and Bucky sat himself on the floor near them to open the box the doll came in. Indy stepped up to Steve and put his arms out when he got close. Steve scooped him up and sat him on his lap. “Bucky said that you wanted the baby to be safe earlier. And that the baby was a friend?” Indy nodded. “Did you know a baby before, sweetheart? Before Bucky took you away, was there a baby that you wanted to be safe?” Indy’s brow furrowed as he thought about that.
“What happened?” Tony’s tone must have been enough to startle Bucky who looked up from where he had been helping Indy eat his grilled cheese sandwich.
Steve and Bucky stared at each other for minute, some silent communication that didn't include Tony passing between them, and then Steve looked back to Tony.
Tony couldn’t hide his tears anymore as his son screamed. They kept him cuffed and brought him to the bathroom at gunpoint then brought him back, let him change Luca’s diaper, and strapped him in again. He was told it was Luca’s last feeding time for the day so Tony assumed it was night. Luca was given to him and again he awkwardly handled him til he got into a decent position. He stopped sobbing enough to eat but his face was streaked with tears, nose stuffy, he was sweaty and breathing heavy. Tony felt so awful for him that it felt like physical pain. And it had only been one day.
“Careful, sweetheart. Chew that good,” Steve told him, wiping some blueberry juice that was dripping down his chin off with his thumb. Tony cut a few blueberries in half and put them in the oatmeal bowl.
“Thank Buppy,” Indy said and smooshed his face against Bucky’s cheek attempting a kiss. Bucky grimaced but laughed.
He reached over and ran his hand over Poppy’s head as she stared at him and he smiled at her. “I’ll talk to you soon Happy.” He carried Indy in to the hospital talking to him as he walked. “You have to listen to me if you’re gonna stay here, all right? And your Papa might seem really sad which I know can be scary but he’s okay and your dad will be okay soon too. Got it?” Indy nodded against his shoulder.
“No.” Steve hugged Indy closer. “Last week.” He sighed. “I said yes. We just wanted to keep it to ourselves for just a little while. Enjoy it, just the two of us. We were going to tell you today actually, when we got back.” Steve laughed humorlessly. “And then we’d tell the team. But now,” he gestured with his hand.
Steve looked so hopeful that Bucky had a hard time finding a reason to say no. Plus, he wasn’t exactly ready to say goodbye to Indy yet if he was honest with himself.
“Listen, we’ve got people following them to see where they’re moving to. Once they unload we should be able to confirm if they have Cap and then we can go in and get him back.”
“What happened to Tony? Did he get hurt?” He heard Steve breathing heavy, possibly crying. “Steve, listen to me,” he said sternly. “Tell me what happened.” The Avengers had left a couple hours previously when Fury called about a threat downtown. Clearly, something went wrong.
“There we go,” Steve said. “That’s nice and warm, right?” Indy didn’t answer but he rubbed at his eyes with his small fist. “I know you’re tired, we’ll be quick.” Steve grabbed a washcloth and began to wipe the boys chest. Bucky sat on the edge of the tub so he was in Indy’s line of sight. “Had he been sick at all with you?” Steve asked Bucky.
“Hey,” Steve said softly. Bucky took a step back, wordlessly inviting him in. “I just wanted to see how you were doing,” he added, following his friend to the sofa.
“I kinda yelled when it happened. I mean it hurt like a bitch. I definitely swore. Not AT him,” he hurried to add. “But then I did yell at him. And he told me he hated me. Now you’re caught up.”
“Yeah it really is. He needs all of this,” Steve agreed, running a hand through Indys hair as he looked at each puzzle board on the table. “Can you say thank you to Uncle Bruce?”
“Here,” Steve said, taking the bear and shirt out of the bag and placing in front of Indy. Indy smiled, bringing the items to his chest and looking very content.
“That’s your Papa’s seat I think,” Bucky said sheepishly as everyone looked at him. “I’ll be right over here.” Indy whined and Tony did not want him to have a meltdown so he spoke up.
“Fury called and I know you’re mad at him but he offered a pilot and the jet so Bruce could meet you guys there and get a jump on helping Tony and Luca until they can get to a hospital,” Peter explained quickly. “I know you’re mad at Fury but it’s just Bruce, and it sounded better than them being stuck with no medical help in the car for three hours.”
“You’re so good with Indy. You’re a natural. And I know it’s different when it’s your own kid but the instincts are there, Buck,” Steve said sincerely.
Bucky rolled his eyes when Natasha looked up at him and she smirked. She ruffled the boys hair then stood and approached Bucky and the baby.
“Good, because I’m not going anywhere,” Steve whispered into Tony’s hair. “I love you both too much.”
“He’s in the kitchen, Captain,” FRIDAY responded, so Steve headed there. Clint was drinking out of the orange juice cartoon as they walked in.
“Hi baby,” he said happily to distract her. He kissed her loudly on her belly which was closest to him and she made an ‘ah’ sound and waved her arms so he did it again louder. She giggled and opened her mouth wide as she made unintelligible sounds but Tony laughed along with her.
Bucky laughed and took the gift, holding it in front of the baby so she could see. “What did Tony get you, huh?” She pulled at the paper along with Bucky until he could see what it was. He dropped the wrapping on the floor and held up a little light pink onesie. On the front it said ‘My Uncle is my favorite’ with a white heart below the words. Bucky laughed and held it up to her but she grabbed it and tried to chew it right away so he put it off to the side. “Why don’t you say thank you to your Uncle then, baby girl.” Bucky held her out and Tony took her immediately giving her a hug. “Thanks, Tony. It’s cute.”
“I’ve given you four baths since we’ve been together, haven’t I? And we did this every time, buddy. I know you’re scared but I would never hurt you and I would never let anyone take care of you that was going to hurt you.” He rubbed the boys back with his flesh hand. “I’ve known Stevie here since I was a kid like you so I trust him. And he’s your dad. He’s just trying to help. Think you can be brave and we can try to get this bath done with all three of us?” Indy sniffled and looked very unsure but hesitantly nodded.
Tony awoke to a hand being smacked into his face. He abruptly sat up, getting his bearings before really focusing on what happened. Indy was sitting next to him wrapped in his blue blanket and llama in his arms, wide awake.
“Yeah, buddy. I’m here. You’re okay,” Bucky whispered to him. “These people in this room, they’re good. They’re safe,” Bucky stressed.
“Yeah, of course. I’m happy, Tony. I really am. I’m glad we can do this it just hit me for a minute but I’m fine.”
Tony turned his face into the closest part of Steve to him. “When can I go home?” He whispered. Steve winced, knowing that question was coming.
He slumped forward slightly when the resistance was suddenly gone and Steve steadied him. Luca wasn’t getting anymore milk and he started grumbling and whining. “All right, time to go. I’m going to carry you, okay? You just keep holding our baby.” Tony nodded and leaned forward a little so Steve could get his arms around him. He picked him up in a bridal carry and Luca stayed snuggled against Tony’s chest. Tony rested his cheek against Steve’s shoulder and his forehead was pressed into Steve’s chin. His breath shuddered as he started to cry again. “I’ve got you, Bubba. It’s okay now, you’re gonna be fine.” Steve kept up the chatter and by the time they made it out of the building, Tony had fallen asleep.
“Cold?” Bucky asked, walking to the heavy looking iron door. The only exit from the room. He tried it, just in case. It was locked. Bucky realized that Tony had nodded against him so he went back to the pile of clothes but all that was there was adult Tony’s pants and a long sleeve shirt that he wore under the armor that didn’t look like it would be very comfortable material, or warm. As Bucky surveyed what they had available to them in the room Tony brought his thumb back to his mouth. At the last minute, and just before Bucky almost said something to him again, Tony stopped himself.
“Okay, all done,” Bruce announced, backing away. Tony passed her back to her father who took her immediately and stood, holding her close to his chest and bouncing her gently.
“You come with me,” she told Clint who jumped up from his spot on the sofa. She kissed Tony’s cheek and leaned in to whisper to him.
“Indiana, you’re up, let’s go,” Bucky announced. Indy ran to the end of the bed, arms out for Bucky to pick him up.
“Cutest boy I’ve ever seen,” Steve added. Indy smiled and started to step towards them so Tony picked him up.
“Those are adorable, Pepper,” Steve said from his spot on the sofa. Indy was kicking is feet up and down staring at them in wonder. “They seem to be a hit,” Steve laughed. Pepper laughed too.
A bit of sleep deprivation didn’t really bother Steve. The serum auto-corrected most of the everyday bad feelings that most people would notice but he saw the toll this first week was taking on his husband.
As soon as Tony engaged the call Fury spoke. “Stark, I need you to listen and not do anything stupid.”
Steve laughed. “One piece before breakfast, that’s it, okay?” Indy grabbed a piece and handed to his Papa to open the wrapper and hand back to him. He then happily ate his chocolate leaning against Steve’s legs and looking up at him occasionally smiling.
“Yeah? What’s up, kiddo?” Clint sat on the stool at the kitchen island in front of where Steve stood. Tony looked up at Steve who nodded encouragingly. He looked at Clint and, very seriously, held his hand out to shake.
Steve shook his head sadly. “They took him into surgery as soon as we gave the okay,” he answered. “We’ll see him when they’re done,” he said for Indy’s benefit, rubbing the boys back. Indy nodded against his chest. Steve looked over at Bucky. “He asked me to marry him.” He blinked back tears and wiped his hand over his face.
“Cuddle,” Tony exclaimed when it finally clicked what he was saying. “Is that it, Peanut? You want to cuddle?” Indy turned his head to nod at Tony and reached a hand out which Tony took right away and kissed.
“We have to get you cleaned up. It’ll make you feel better, okay?” Steve picked Indy up and held him over the tub to lower him in.
Tony turned back to face them both. “She’s Bucky’s.” Tony gave a small smile but Bucky looked like he was going to pass out. “You okay?”
“Yeah,” Tony answered. He pulled his feet up to stretch out on the sofa next to him and  grabbed the discarded blanket that Indy had been using earlier and pulled it over himself. He realized none of it would cover Steve if he laid that way and started to move but Steve held him in place with a hand around his back, palm pressing down on his shoulder.
“Dum-E started it,” he grumbled. Dum-E beeped loudly from across the room. “Yes, you did,” Tony replied to it. “I told Indy he could play with Dum-E for a little bit while I was finishing up some work and it was fine at first, they were just chasing each other around. But then Dum-E kept offering him things that weren’t toys to play with that I kept having to take away.” Indy whined with his face still smooshed into the sofa.
Steve felt Indy nod against his shoulder so he turned to face Tony. “Sit down, I’ll pass him to you and go get a book.” Tony sat on he end of the sofa after Bucky sat up and took Indy. The boy sat sideways in Tony’s lap cradled by one of Tony’s arms. He handed the boy his sippy cup  and he dropped the pacifier from his mouth and started drinking right away. Bucky covered him with his blanket.
“Don’t,” Tony snapped. “Don’t you dare defend him.” Steve had enough sense to not reply that moment. Tony turned his back on Bucky. “I need to be alone,” he told Steve.
“Indy, listen. You can’t hit people to wake them up or get their attention. You have to stop doing that because it’s not very nice,” Tony said somewhat sternly. They hadn’t really had to discipline Indy for anything since he’s been with them, and this wasn’t that big of a deal, but he felt it needed to be addressed at least.
“We love you, baby boy. More than anything. Don’t ever doubt that.” Steve stood and brought Luca over to the crib, placing him gently on the center of the soft mattress. Luca cooed and then settled, blinking heavily. “You try to get a good long rest to give Daddy a break, okay? Can you do that?” He ran his hand through his sons soft wisps of hair. “Papa loves you.” Steve quietly left the room, turning the overhead light off which triggered the night light to come on.
“They’re strong,” she said, stepping up next to him. “They’ll survive this. You need to let me and Clint handle the Shield part. We’ll get you what you need and then we’ll get your boys back.” Steve nodded reluctantly.
“I do it,” the boy answered excitedly. Steve held the marshmallow bag open for him and Indy filled his hand then very carefully started dropping them into his cup. Steve looked to the side at Tony and they smiled when they made eye contact. Indy continued slowly placing one marshmallow after the other in his cocoa. Once there were so many that all you could see was white he announced he was done.
“I think we should. Nothing crazy, but we need a minute to ourselves to regroup, I think. It’ll do us both good.”
Steve smiled. “Before that. About the place where Bucky found you. I know it might be scary and sad talking about that but it will really help in the long run.”
“He’s crying,” Tony replied, waking more and sitting up. He threw a glance over his shoulder to make sure Steve was still asleep but he had his back to them and was dead to the world.
Steve was surprised that it didn’t take more convincing. “Okay. Thank you.” He kissed Tony’s cheek.  “Now sleep.”  Tony chuckled but dutifully closed his eyes and tried.
“I know he is. But you haven’t let go of him since you got back, Tony. He’s safe now. You don’t even have to put him in the chair just let me hold him.”
“Thanks,” Bucky smiled down at him. “Why don’t we take a picture, just us?” It still felt weird for him sometimes, having this normal life where he could enjoy a wedding and take pictures with his nephew. He had a phone full of pictures of his daughter, friends, family. Sometimes it felt like a dream because it seemed too impossible but he didn’t even care as long as never woke up. He crouched down beside Indy and pulled him into a hug, kissing his temple and holding him close for a second. Indy didn’t question it, happy for a cuddle from his Buppy. “Love you,” he whispered and Indy squeezed him tighter.
“You ready to go shopping, munchkin?” Tony asked the small boy that was now on his lap where Tony sat on the side of the bed.
“Both of you, disturbingly enough. You didn’t have to wake up early today, Tony,” Steve said. “Or you can bring him back to bed with you, get some more rest.”
“Okay, Tony, enough. Seriously. Let me hold my son for 10 minutes and then you can have him back.” Steve stood and reached out to pull Luca off of Tony but Tony hugged Luca closer, wrapping both arms completely around him. Steve managed to work his hands under the boys armpits but stayed where he was hoping Tony would relent. “Come on, let go.”
“So Indy, like I said before, this is Steve.” Indy looked up from his bear to Steve. “He’s your dad, do you know what that is?” Indy looked at him seemingly confused. “It means you’re his  little boy,” Bucky added. “And he’s going to take care of you.”
Steve set about sweeping up the glass shards, picking up and throwing away the largest pieces easily, and then vacuuming the entire area to make sure every little piece was found. He glanced over Tony’s way every once in awhile although since it was angled at the wall all he could see was his tiny feet hanging off the edge of the cushion. He was glad he stayed put for his time at least. His watch beeped when the 5 minutes were up so he put away his cleaning supplies and went back to Tony.
“Yeah,” Steve agreed, standing. “We can bring this into the room you’ll be sleeping in.” Steve stood up, scooping up the whole bassinet in arms and leaving the room with Bucky. Tony slid down onto the cushion next to his son.
“I think she’s found her favorite,” Steve said, smiling at his boyfriend. Tony was about to respond until he felt a warmth spreading from beneath the blanket.
“I’ll get you close so you can give a kiss but you can’t touch anywhere over here,” he gestured to Tony’s chest. He leaned Indy over and the boy gave Tony a kiss on his cheek. Tony turned his head and kissed the boys forehead, raising the hand on that side of the bed and patting the part of Indy’s arm he could reach.
“That’s gross, Clint,” Steve grimaced, getting a giggle out of Tony at least. Clint looked over but didn’t stop drinking. Steve sighed. “Tony has something to say to you.”
“You okay?” Tony turned but winced as the movement pulled at his stitches, his stunt from earlier having aggravated the incision. The sympathetic, soft way Bucky asked seemed to be what tipped Tony over the edge finally because he found himself unable to answer for fear that he would just start crying. He shrugged minutely. Bucky couldn’t help but notice that Tony was starting to shake faintly. He stepped forward sliding his arm around Tony’s waist. “Come on, let’s get you sitting.” He walked Tony slowly over to the sofa. Poppy was laying on her play mat on the rug in front of the sofa playing with the toys that dangled over her. “Would you lay down for a minute so I can check your stitches or is that asking too much?”
Steve smiled. “See, he’s fine. He’ll see that you’re okay and everything will be great.” Tony sat up, wiping his face with his sleeve.
If you have any ideas of situations/prompts for these characters in for other fics drop the idea in the comments!
They poured their cereal and ate in companionable silence. Steve took a few token bites, but it was more so Peter would continue eating than for himself. It was hard to enjoy food when Tony was being fed hardly anything and his son was only able to drink twice a day.
“Ah,” Luca squeaked, grabbing one of Steve’s fingers and holding it in a tiny fist. Steve smiled down at him.
Tony couldn’t sleep. He was too keyed up over the events of the day. Too excited to have Steve back safe in his arms. And, if he was being honest, still worried about the drug coursing through his boyfriends system that was blocking the serum. Steve was snoring softly, his face buried in Tony’s side right below his armpit because at some point he had shifted and slid down the bed a little. Indy was lower than that, held tightly against Steve’s stomach and also sound asleep. Tony was glad Indy was getting more rest. All he had managed over the past few days were fitful naps here and there, and they never lasted long enough to be useful.
Once Indy was definitely asleep Tony spoke up. “We should put him down somewhere to rest, Steve.” Steve looked over from where he had been swaying and nodded. “You can come up to our floor,” he added to Bucky. “We have guest rooms.” Bucky looked unsure.
“Good, I’m glad.” Bucky ruffled his hair and Indy turned his head and kissed Bucky’s cheek. Tony walked into the room and placed two big bowls onto the coffee table, one with potato chips and one filled with Doritos.
“That’s dirty, stop,” Bucky told him, gently pulling the kids hand away from his face. He wondered how this was his life right now. As gentle as Bucky was, Tony still flinched.
“Yup, it’s a llama. For you to keep so you have your very own when Papa reads you the story.” Indy squeezed it to his chest tightly. He looked back to Steve holding it out excitedly.
“This is something I thought about. Doing it right this second was a whim but not the question. I love you. We have a son together. I don’t think either of us are going anywhere. I want to be your husband. I want you to be mine. If you don’t want to answer right now you don’t have to. I know I sprung this on you. I’m happy with what we have, nothing has to change but I do want that. At some point.” Tony looked down, waiting for Steve to say something.
Tony made grabby hands in his direction when he stood up so Bucky stepped close to him so he could give her a kiss to the top of her head and Steve reached out and ran a finger down her arm.
Tony awoke first the next morning earlier than he would have liked, but, he had to pee. He opened his eyes slowly, adjusting to the light that was just starting to stream through their window. He was about to push back the sheet and get out of bed when he realized that at some point in the night Indy had rolled to face him and had Tony’s arm hugged tightly to his little body instead of his teddy bear. He smiled to himself. The kid was definitely cute. Like a tiny Steve.  He gently tried to pry the small hands off his arm without waking him but he snuffled and burrowed his head deeper into the pillow as soon as Tony had moved his arm away and then slowly blinked awake.
“Okay, okay. Let me, Tony. Relax.” Steve took Luca in his hands and moved him to where he needed to be and he started drinking right away. Steve held him there so Tony didn’t have to at the weird angle but Tony’s hand still came up and cupped the boys head.
A little while later, as Luca dozed in Steve’s arms, Tony began to wake. He moaned and Steve stopped his pacing and went to Tony’s side, grabbing his hand and squeezing it gently.
When they were all done Steve looked at his son and sighed. There was oatmeal and blueberry all over his face, his hands, and disturbingly, dried in his hair which looked like it was not going to be easy to scrub out.
Bucky brought Indy outside to the top of the aisle where Pepper waited for him. She had volunteered to wait with Indy and tell him when to walk so Bucky could take his place next to Steve at the alter as Best Man. He let go of Indy’s hand and crouched down so they were eye level. “You ready little man?” Indy nodded, although he seemed much more subdued in the face of his task, seeing people on both sides in their respective seats. Noticing this Bucky added, “You’re gonna do great. You get to drop all the petals. That’s the best part right?”
“Papa, up?” Steve picked him up and they took the elevator down to the floor where there was a Stark Industries conference room. Tony had booked the therapy appointment and paid extra to have her come to them. She arrived shortly after they did, escorted by security, carrying a duffle bag filled with supplies.
“She said the session was almost over anyway so we’d just cut this one short. She’ll talk to you about it if you wanna go in there,” Bucky nodded back at the door. “Can I bring him home?”
“Good.” Steve smiled. “Question. You were up with her all last night but where do you think we should put her down to sleep tonight?” He looked down at the baby girl currently sound asleep against his chest.
Even though he had agreed on the jet, Tony nearly had a full blown panic attack once they landed at the thought of going to the hospital. He pleaded with them to go straight home and after Steve and Bruce had a discussion off of the side, Bruce feeling confident enough that he could easily treat both Tony and Luca in his lab, Steve agreed to skip the hospital for the time being.
“He loves you, Tony. Of course he’s coming for you.” He glanced down and the little boy had his neck craned back so he could see Bucky, maybe looking to see if he should believe him. Bucky tilted his face down and pressed a quick kiss to Tony’s forehead. Tony gasped slightly and stared at Bucky. “It’s gonna be okay,” Bucky said softly, ignoring the boys shock at a kiss.
“Okay, Nat come with us. Clint hide somewhere and keep an eye out. Bruce, I don’t really want the big guy making an appearance so,” Tony trailed off.
“Get the kid,” Bucky said, nodding to the cot. “I’ll cover you.” He raised the gun which he hadn’t bothered using before, but he couldn’t take the chance if a kid was involved. Tony stepped out of the Iron Man suit, ordering it to stand guard, and stepped over to where the child was laying.
"Yes, FRIDAY, your position is duly noted," he smirked. The phone buzzed again, one time, and this time it was a text. Tony opened the phone and read it:
“JARVIS, start a warm bath, please.” The water started to fill the tub and Tony poured some of his own body wash in to make it smell nice and bubble up then he helped Steve to sit down. He began to wash Steve thoroughly, head to toe, and Steve melted into it.
“Well, it means a lot to me. Knowing he exists officially, you know? Like it’s more real now. Like he’s not going to be taken away somehow,” Steve said softly. Tony leaned in to his side as he nodded.
Steve sighed. “He’s okay with Pepper right now, you know that,” he assured him. “He’s probably sleeping anyway. It’s okay to take care of yourself when you need to, Tony. And right now you’re my priority.” Since Tony was wearing Steve’s old SHEILD hoodie Steve pulled the hood up over Tony’s head to keep him warm and pulled him back against his chest. “Are you sure this is comfortable with your legs bent like that? We can lay down if you want?”
“Okay, cake time,” Tony said excitedly, standing up once everyone had eaten their fill of pizza and appetizers. “Come take a seat and please put on a party hat,” he added seriously. He managed to pull Indy away from Bucky and the latest puzzle he was trying and placed him in his seat that the llama previously occupied, placing the stuffed animal next to Indy’s plate. “Wanna wear the hat?”
“Shopping is my specialty. Sounds fun,” he said excitedly. “Only the best for my favorite Tator tot,” Tony exclaimed grasping Indy and pulling him from Steve’s arms.
When he awoke he was alone but he could hear Peter doing something nearby. Tony was feeding Luca on the screen. He looked at Peter’s phone and saw that it was just about 7:30 am, so he slept for 3 hours.
They found Tony standing at a computer but he turned when he heard them approach. “Hi,” he said trying to sound cheery but Steve could see the nervous tension so he smiled reassuringly at his boyfriend.
The next morning came and Steve could practically feel the anxiety pouring off of Tony. To the point where he started to second guess his plan. Tony was in the nursery changing Luca out of his pajamas looking about as stressed as he’d ever seen him. He walked up behind him and circled his arms around the smaller mans waist, resting his chin on Tony’s shoulder. Tony didn’t really acknowledge him he just continued trying to maneuver Luca’s arms and legs into his clean onesie.
“Not broke, sweetheart.” Steve crouched down to his level. “He got coffee on him but we’ll clean him, he’ll be okay.”
“Oh, wait. He’s little, Tony. We don’t have a car seat for him,” Steve said worriedly. Tony gave his boyfriend a sheepish look.
“How’s that taste?” Steve asked and laughed at Indy’s surprised face. He didn’t answer but he scooped up more and stuck his fingers back in his mouth.
Steve laughed. “Baby, you have to stop apologizing for getting kidnapped, please.” Tony shrugged. Natasha walked back from the cockpit to where Steve and Tony were speaking and Bruce puttered around them.
Tony stared him down for a minute but then did step aside. Bucky was off the jet before anyone could say anything else. Tony flew off to give them some air cover and Steve, Natasha and Clint followed after Bucky. They took down the guards at the door fairly easily and made their way inside, splitting up to cover more ground. Tony circled once overhead but didn’t see any more guards on the outside so he headed inside to join the rest of the team.
“Tony. Nothing could ever make me not want you. I love you more than anything.” He pulled Tony on to his lap, thinking they both needed the contact. Tony curled into him instantly. “I’m always going to be here for you, baby. I promise.”
“What is it, darling? You gotta help me out here.” Tony stood up straight and ran his hand up and down Steve’s back, trying to soothe some of the tension. Steve turned around quickly to face Tony.
“We’ll sit right here,” Tony said placatingly. He sat in the armchair next to the sofa, fixing Indy on his lap so he was facing out. He squirmed but Tony held tight. “Bruce has to finish helping Papa so you sit here.” Steve took off his shirt and leaned back on the cushions. Bruce got out some gauze and antiseptic to clean the worst of the cuts still left. He examined his chest, back and arms.
“Ah-ma,” Indy whined, reaching back toward the bed. Steve found the plush llama and pushed it into his sons outstretched hand.
“Tony,” Steve gasped. “Did he just,” he trailed off, he knew Tony heard it too because Tony was staring at their son with a look of awe. “Were you trying to say Dada? You’re going to take a bath with Daddy,” Steve said excitedly to keep Luca interested. “Can you say Dada?”
Bucky laughed. “I don’t know, he can’t say Bucky. I corrected him the whole first day I had him and then I just let it go.”
Tony looked over at Steve surprised then back at Bucky. “I’ll be right here too,” Bucky told him. “Steve just want’s to hang out with you a little.” Bucky unzipped his sweatshirt and let Tony lean toward Steve. Steve scooped him up and sat him on his own lap. Tony fiddled with the ends of his shirt.
Bucky sighed. “Okay, as cute as this is we have one mission right now and that is to get ready for this wedding, so come on.” He grabbed Indy around the waist and put him back on the floor.  He took the light pink dress and pulled it over Poppy’s head. “There’s my pretty girl,” he said, and Poppy beamed at him. He took the little baby brush and combed the little hair she had and then slid the headband around the crown of her head. The little flower that was attached to it just off to the side. “All right. I think you’re done sweetheart.” He picked her up, holding her close and straightening her dress. “You look beautiful,” he whispered, getting choked up with the emotion that hit him suddenly. He kissed her temple and took a moment but knew he couldn’t linger with Indy running circles around them.
“God, Tony. Are you okay? Does it hurt? What’s wrong?” Steve asked somewhat frantically. Tony was shaking his head. Steve crouched down in front of him, hands hovering, not sure if he should touch.
“Yeah, let’s go find him.” He stood, reaching a hand out to take Tony’s as they headed to the elevator.
“I’m not going anywhere. And it’s okay. You’ve been through a lot in a week, Tony. You’re still healing, you’re not sleeping. If you wanna get mad at me sometimes I can take that.”
Tony was already on the sofa with Clint watching a Disney movie so Steve pushed the teddy bear into his arms. Tony barely registered Steve’s presence but tightened his arms around the bear. Steve smirked and kissed the top of his head.
“I guess we can do that,” Tony agreed. Steve stood and sat Luca on the bed and placed pillows on either side so he wouldn’t fall over.
Tony was clearly still upset but rallied for Indy and turned his head so he could see his son. “Goodnight, Peanut.”
“Hi Darling,” Tony whispered, coming to his side and grabbing his hand. Steve sobbed. “You’re okay. I’m here. Nothing bad happened to me or Indy, I promise. He’s out there with Bucky right now and you can see him in a little bit.”
“Just let me hold him, he can roll off the table. Please. If he gets hurt you won’t get anything from anyone. Please.” The woman seemed to think about it since Luca was screaming now and she seemed annoyed by it.
“I think the willingness was there for the most part, even though he was nervous. I think the issue is really articulating what he’s been through, which he isn’t really able to do well at the moment. That’s why I think it was helpful to have Bucky here because he had some first hand experience with seeing the location Indy was held in and the things that may have happened. In some cases he was able to understand what Indy was trying to describe, when I wasn’t.”
“Thanks,” Bucky answered quietly. “I appreciate that, Tony.” Bucky pushed Tony’s hand off of him playfully. “Enough with the feelings, why don’t you go check on your guy.”
“Not even to, um,” Steve’s breath caught in his throat and he swallowed down the sob threatening to break free. “Not even to use a bathroom. So, I had to just-,” he stopped, unable to continue.
He took the arm up to the common area where Steve and Bucky sat on opposite ends of the sofa silently staring at the TV.
“Don’t you take after Daddy in that way, please,” he told him exasperated. He rounded the counter and picked up his son, kissing him on his cheek. Indy instantly rested his head on his Papa’s shoulder. “Happy Valentine’s Day, sweet boy.” Indy hugged Steve harder in response. Steve stepped up to Tony who had been stealing sips of his coffee. “Happy Valentine’s to you too, sweetheart.” Tony looked up with a smile and Steve leaned in to kiss him. The kiss deepened until Steve felt an insistent patting on the side of his head. He pulled back with a chuckle and looked at Indy who looked put out at losing his Papa’s attention.
“Okay, well then. Welcome to the family Liam,” Tony said leaning down to kiss the top of the dolls head and then Indy’s as well.
“I’m going to check in with Happy and have him bring Poppy here for a little bit,” Bucky said before he left the room.
At that, Tony looked up. "It would have been if he didn't destroy the fucking power source," Tony growled. "Listen, if you want me to get this done talking about Siberia is not going to help."
“Okay, shh. Calm down. Just breathe. I’ll be there in 10 and we’ll figure it out. I’m going to hang up so I can get someone to watch the kids. I’m going to call you back on my drive over, okay? Keep your phone close.” Silence. “Stevie? Do you understand?”
“Yes,” Tony nodded. He took the peppers from Steve and slid the cutting board closer to himself. Steve handed him a knife.
“Come here, baby bug.” Steve pulled Luca onto his lap, leaning him back in the crook of his arm. Peter flipped the camera and pulled his arm in so he could aim it at just Steve and Luca.
“It’s not a recording, Stevie. Tony’s on the phone. He’s going to meet us when we land. Hydra lied about everything, you have to believe me.”
“Shields going to take over so we can get out of here,” Steve told them. He went over to the doorway speaking to the 2 Shield agents that were waiting and then returned with them. They took the Hydra agent and Steve motioned for Bucky and Tony to follow him. “Let’s just get back to the jet. Natasha and Clint are finishing up. There were some more people in the back but no kids.” Steve led Tony up into the Quinjet and over to one of the seats as Bucky stalked past them. Tony sat, fixing the blanket and bundling the baby in to sitting on his lap while staying covered up. Steve knelt down in front of him and placed his hands on Tony’s knees. It was his first look at the baby who watched him intently as he pulled the cowl off his face.
By the time Pepper and Rhodey arrived and had talked to the doctor Indy was looking more worried. “Here, Steve. Let me take him.” He pulled Indy into his arms as Rhodey and Pepper came over. “You guys talk, we’re gonna go grab a snack.”
Tony took a deep breath, releasing it slowly. "I just got off the phone with the higher ups, so this is a legit offer. We can get you pardoned. Both of you. No more being on the run, hiding from the authorities, none of it."
Steve came in and plopped down into the chair next to Indy with a grocery store bag that he dropped on the table.  “So, Indiana. Your next Christmas’sy thing to learn about is,” he rooted around in the bag til he found what he was looking for and pulled out a container, “hot cocoa!” He place the container on the table then pulled out a bag of marshmallows and a box of candy canes. “It’s a drink,” he explained. “You wanna try it now?”
“Time to get up, sleepy head,” Steve cheered happily as he walked into his bedroom. He stopped short though at the sight of a fully grown Tony sitting on the end of the bed, head in his hands, crying. “Tony,” he questioned. Tony looked up and wiped at his face with his hands.
“Shh, stay calm, baby. Almost done.” Steve washed Indy’s body quicker since there was less food there, then got the cup they use to wash his hair. He put one hand on the back of Indy’s neck. “Can you lean back for me so I can get your hair?” He pushed him back by his shoulder gently when he didn’t move on his own. Indy’s eyes were squeezed tightly shut and tears escaped down his cheeks. Steve poured the water on his hair quickly then began to rub some shampoo to get out all the oatmeal. “You’re still okay. Can you take a big deep breath for me?” Indy did and let it out with a quiet sob. “Good boy. You’re safe.” Steve rinsed his har a couple times and once the suds were gone he sat the boy up and hit the button to drain the water. “All done,” he announced.
Bucky turned back. “Let’s go,” he said sternly. He stepped forward and leaned over to grab Indy’s hand but the boy pulled away.
“You’re his dad, I didn’t tell him to call me that, I promise,” Tony said so sincerely that Steve was more confused.
“Yes, I am,” Steve shouted. “I am because that’s what everyone’s been telling me since I became this,” he gestured to himself and continued angrily.  “And I never wanted that. I never wanted the attention or the fame or any of it and I still don’t. But, I AM Captain America and that is Tony Stark. Iron Man is special. We are special. And that is our son and I won’t stand here and let you tell me now, when its not convenient for Shield to help, that we’re no different from anyone else.” Steve’s fists were clenched at his sides and he was breathing heavy and Natasha quietly slid between Steve and Fury, pushing gently on Steves shoulders to back him up. Steve broke his eye contact to look at her instead. She nodded slightly, letting him know subtly that she agreed with him but fighting with Fury wasn’t helping.
Tony forced himself not to react even though his heart felt like it was about to explode. Luca was 8 months old now, he ate soft foods three times a day and breastfed around 8 times. Two feedings weren’t enough unless they got out of this quick.
“That’s okay,” Tony told him. He placed the hat on top of the llama instead and it fell down almost covering its whole body since it was so small. Indy giggled. Bucky walked by heading toward the other end of the table and Indy grabbed at him even though he couldn’t reach.
Steve kissed Tony’s temple. “Tony’s right, Buck. This is your home. Not just the tower but this floor, your room here, all of it. Forever if you want it, but if or when you want your own space its right downstairs.”
“That’s right. It was just a bad day. The handshake was nice but maybe I could get a hug, huh?” Clint held his hands out. Tony smiled and fell in to them so Steve let Clint take over. Clint gave him a big hug, rocking them back and forth and making Tony laugh. Steve took advantage and went about making Tony a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, cutting off the crust and dividing it into 4 triangles. He put it on Tony’s favorite plate that looked like the Captain America shield and filled his sippy cup with apple juice. He brought the items over to the counter next to Clint.
Indy nodded slowly.  “So, Poppy was made from Bucky and she’s his daughter. Bucky’s her dad. Make sense?”
"You guys want lunch or something? I could order in or make something if you don't mind me using the kitchen. Least I could do is make you a meal." Tony rolled his eyes but bit his tongue against a sarcastic response.
“You’re turn,” Rhodey said, clapping him with a hand on his back. “He wants to see you.” Steve nodded.
“Yeah,” Tony said. “Nat, wanna hold this peanut for a bit?” He lifted Indy who laughed at the nickname.
Tony and Steve set up a small get together on Indy’s birthday which fell on the Saturday the weekend following Bucky’s revelation that Indy was about to turn 3. Steve held Tony back in going absolutely crazy with decorations and they both advised all those invited that it was a small affair, and if they insisted on getting the boy a gift to keep it small because he was easily overwhelmed.
Sorry this has taken SO long! We’ve come to the end of this story BUT there will be more in the Indy universe, just separate smaller stories.
Bucky nodded. “Right, and now we came home. We can get you a bath and some clothes. We can eat. It’ll be good.”
“I’m not trying to hurt you,” Steve sighed, but his grip still tightened slightly. “But that’s more than I can say about you. Are you trying to kill yourself? You JUST had major surgery, Tony. You couldn’t even sit up without my help and you have the nerve to jump in a suit and go out there and fight?” Steve’s voice was getting louder and Tony glanced over to the nearby living room, knowing Bucky could hear them for sure but possibly Indy too. “I almost lost you,” Steve continued, voice cracking, and he let go of Tony’s arm.
“Oh, very nice. Are you gonna be our little duck one day? You’re gonna love baths I bet,” Tony said cheerily. Steve wished he had been recording this moment because the look Indy gave Tony was as if Tony had lost his mind and Steve couldn’t help but laugh out loud. Tony, to his credit, just went with it.
“Hold up,” Tony called after him before he reached the elevator. “Let’s be smart about this.” He plucked the back of Steves shirt between his fingers pulling back to make his point when Steve hadn’t slowed down.
“You get the rest of the snacks out, I’ll grab the door,” he said to Tony. Steve opened the door and Bruce was standing there with a brightly colored gift bag. “Hey Bruce, thanks for coming,” he gestured for him to come in.
“This message is for Captain America,” the woman started, and Steve stiffened. “By now I assume you’ve watched the livestream and seen your husband and son. They’re okay for now. So, what happens next is up to you. Give us what we want and we’ll send you the coordinates to pick him up. If you refuse, or try something else, then I will kill them both. The first request I think will be easy for you. 5 million dollars. I’m sure Stark won’t even miss it, will you?” She turned slightly and he shook his head minutely. “The second request involves Shield, but I think if anyone can get this done you can, Captain. They recently picked up a friend of ours, Victor Graves. We’d like him back. If you agree to this exchange you can leave him here when you pick up these two.” She moved out of the frame and the camera zoomed in on Tony. Off camera the woman said, “You have 10 seconds to say something.” Tony looked at her then back at the camera, looking shocked for a moment.
