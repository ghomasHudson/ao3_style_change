As of today, Carol and Rhodey had decided to spend their free evening together at the tower. Carol was eating easily as much as Steve, Tony was sated by just watching the two shoveling food into their faces. Nevertheless, Rhodey looked at Carol as if he was studying a masterpiece.
“No,” Steve scowled adorable earnestly with his refusal to Tony's suggestions. “I wanted to propose a counter-event, an Avenger's Halloween party, that Iron Man has to be present at. You can't go to both events and the whole team and some other important people are forcing you to attend it, of course, so the decision of which party to attend is taken out of your hands.”
"Tony," he regarded the businessman with a disapproving look. "I don’t like being the reason you have to interrupt your work. Avengers business is interfering with Stark Industries enough already."
“Oh, fuck off.” Bucky shoved Steve away laughing. “You don't smell like roses either. Hey, there's a thought. You should get your man some flowers for the great emotional resolution.”
“And make Morris lose his job? You’re a heartless employer!" Steve cried out in an exaggerated moral outrage.
“Let’s get some of that hot apple punch, I heard it’s delicious and I'll have a warm cup to hold on to.”
"Look who's got a big head now." He took a sip from his hot cocoa, spiced with pumpkin and cinnamon instead of amaretto, the way he used to drink it. "I bet he is actually trying to prevent Steve from seeing you, Lady Liberty," he huffed, indicating her costume. "Right now, you are Captain America's walking wet dream and your boyfriend's trying to stop him from harassing you."
It was still early, therefore he didn’t expect any of his teammates to be up already. That was fine with him, he liked to prepare breakfast for his friends and enjoyed the quiet morning by himself before the tower awoke and started bustling with the chaos that came with several superheroes living beneath the same roof.
“If I didn’t know better I’d swear you’re not a grown-up, but two kids in a trench coat disguised as a billionaire.”
“I was intrigued and tried it myself. Turns out, it's not only good for your health, it's also fun and, at the end of the day, you have some tangible reward for all your work."
“About earlier," he began as they entered the elevator. “I didn’t watch my tongue. I know you stopped with the drinking and I’m proud of you. We all are. And we support you. I didn’t want to accuse you of anything.”
"Shit, kid, slow down!" Tony exclaimed with a laugh as the boy skidded over the damp grass and was only saved by Iron Man's quick reflexes.
A few stitches were askew but the textile felt soft to the touch. Tony recognized it easily as the one Steve had been knitting himself.
"I'll have you know that in those situations I'm mostly functioning on pure battlefield adrenaline. This right now hurts like a bitch."
It was the end of summer and while the air was still fairly warm, the bad weather reminded everyone that the cold season was getting closer. Deceived by the sunny morning, Steve had left his jacket at home. Now, he regretted it. He had wrapped his arms around himself to rub away the goosebumps on his naked arms, with no effect to his damp skin. Frustrated, he shoved his hands beneath his armpits to keep at least his fingers warm.
“Nothing,” Steve quickly assured him. “Just people putting the wrong ideas in my head. But we're good.”
"Uh oh!" Tony stage whispered as he followed Steve, defusing the tense moment and making the children giggle.
Annoyingly, Tony found that he had started sweating from dancing close to the fire and was now indeed shivering from the cool breeze on his damp skin.
“Now I am embarrassed to say,” Nat drawled. “I'm the Black Widow and I got out-creeped by Captain America.”
Tasha's eyes rolled skywards before she grabbed his chin and turned his face to the right direction. "You see your overgrown double making ghost sounds while handing the kids their cotton candy?"
She shouldered her plastic torch and looked him up and down with a smirk. "He may have been blushing when I saw him last, but that's only to a limited extent my fault."
"That word is for battlefield-use only," he proclaimed with his full authority in his voice. "And I don't see any doom-bots around."
The next day, Steve was jogging with Bucky through the park much later than usual. Dry leaves were crunching beneath their feet as they sidestepped the many people going for a walk. Even though the air was crisp, the rays of sunlight were strong and warm whenever they peeked from behind the few clouds and that was enough to elicit the people of New York to go outside.
"Holy shit!" the inventor yelled as he jumped out of his chair and stuck his thumb into his mouth. He glared at Dum-E as he safely put away the burning hot tool and began to scold him around the finger between his lips. "What is wrong with you? Where did you get that? No, stop the beeping, just go into your corner!"
“This is for blackmail,'' Tony said quickly, looking down at the beautiful picture. The warm sun was reflected in the blonde's hair, giving him a golden halo. The smile on his face was honest and open, his perfectly white teeth shining bright. Steve looked radiant and if the original hadn't been sitting right in front of him, Tony probably wouldn't have been able to tear his eyes away from the photograph. “Next time you harass me during training, I'll tell everyone that Captain America likes to knit in his free time.”
Tony pulled up his legs, let his arms rest on his knees and fixated his eyes on the spoon spinning between his fingers.
"I would be worried about your big head if I hadn't literally just seen you cry over that girl dressed as princess Iron Man," Tasha commented while observing Clint, who was dressed up as Robin Hood and joggled apples for a small crowd of single moms.
Lying in his bed like a dead weight, his eyes falling shut on their own accord, Steve suddenly remembered why he had gone to the kitchen in the first place. He concentrated on his body and found that he felt nicely warm, not so hot that he would have to push his blanket aside, just cozy, his room a perfect temperature to fall asleep.
He stumbled backwards, but before he could fall over his own feet, Captain America's quick reflexes had catched his elbow and steadied him.
“And thank you for the food,” he remarked after his mouth was empty again. “But I should probably go back to work now, so if you don't want to be bored to a painfully dull death than you should better flee.”
"Maybe I should wear the outfit during our next training session and let the real Widow teach me that move."
“Billie Holiday?” Tony couldn't help the poignant grin on his face that came with the memory. “I think Howard never liked her much. My parents listened to a lot of jazz, but never her music.”
Later, once the floor was dry and the stew was done, they sat around the large dining table, enjoying the food and the time with their teammates. Natasha had made enough to feed a small army. They always cooked more than they needed, knowing that any leftovers would be ravaged quickly enough. Besides, they never knew when someone would suddenly join them.
Now Steve was jogging through this beautiful scenery of a fine autumn day and he couldn't even enjoy it, because his mind kept flitting back to the mechanic in his windowless lab, working the day away.
With a raised brow, he eyed the bodyguard's usual get up of a dark suit and tinted glasses. Happy raised a shiny silver pen in front of him and made a quick noise with his mouth, his features revealing no emotion.
Their words hang in the air as they both were frozen to the spot, afraid to break something very fragile between them if they just as much as breathed wrong.
“No need, I called Hill and she agreed to pull some strings,” Steve beamed. “As soon as you give your permission.”
Steve let his grip glide down along Tony’s arm, until he held both of his hands in his own. He rubbed them between his palms, before pulling them up to his face to warm them with his breath.
Blindly, he tumbled out of bed and into his dark apartment's kitchen. He fetched a glass out of the cupboard, his enhanced eyes and muscle memory making it easier for him to find his way around during the night. He held the glass beneath the faucet and turned on the water. Nothing happened. Confused, he tried again, and again there was no water.
“That's out of context!” Rhodey protested, but he was already drowned out by the others' outcries and imploring questions, which Tony only answered with vague half-truths that were not in favor of the colonel.
Every attending Avenger had agreed to wear a costume that was not their usual uniform, therefore Clint bringing his own bow was kind of cheating. Yet, Tony couldn't complain. Though he didn't wear his armour, he had simply gotten hold of one of Black Widows cast-off jumpsuits, widened the shoulders and wore long gloves and high shoes to mask the fact that his own limbs were a little too long for the shorter woman's clothes.
“I guess we should go to bed,” the inventor sighed with a self-deprecating smile. “I kept you up long enough. Hey, for not being my therapist, you really know how to get me talking.”
When he moved back, he watched with fascination how the other man's eyelids fluttered open and those brown eyes holding so much warmth beamed at him. Despite the chaste kiss, his breathing had turned ragged and his chest felt tight with emotions. He couldn't keep from grinning even if he tried, happiness radiating from him.
Steve chimed in and let out a hearty laugh as he watched the invincible Iron Man jump out of his skin.
"I'll have you know that I got that reputation because I used to be the one ending up between someone's legs."
For a few minutes Steve waited patiently for Tony to continue. The slightly smaller man seemed to be lost in his memories for a moment. Treading carefully, Steve pressed the side of his thigh against Tony’s, trying to remind him that he didn’t have to be alone with his dark thoughts, that Steve was here for him.
“I heard a lot about Howard since I've woken up in the future and it's kind of difficult to connect the young version in my head to- to this… well- this asshole.”
“Huh? Oh,” Steve paused for a moment to listen to the melody. “It's Strange Fruit. I asked JARVIS to play some Billie Holiday for me. I always liked her voice and there are even some songs I didn't know yet.”
"I guess one would have to have strangled a man with his thighs to understand that kind of humor and I must admit that I never had that kind of pleasure."
After an energizing jog and a refreshing shower Steve took the stairs up towards the community kitchen. He didn’t mind the extra training for his legs and the four floors had him hardly out of breath.
“Tony,” Steve spoke softly. “You don't have to explain yourself to me. I'm your friend, not your therapist.”
"No, I was thinking Irish stew", she decided, her eyes following Steve, who was putting his empty cup into the trash can.
The children close by were howling at once, some pointing at Tony and shaming him for using such foul language, while others started a chorus of repeating the cuss word.
“You remember Walter?” Steve began explaining, metal needles click-clacking with every swift movement of his hands.
A soft ping resounded, loud enough for supersoldiers' ears and Steve pulled out his phone to find a message from Tony, just reading "That's your dumb humor" with a video attached.
Steve chuckled. The other man really was the perfect example for an absent-minded genius, his brain always jumping from one topic to the other. The littlest distractions could alter Tony's attention, yet he never seemed to miss the important things. And whenever those intelligent eyes were focused on him, Steve could feel goosebumps rise at his neck.
Usually, he would go with one of the following two actions. He would either give a half-hearted chuckle at the ridiculous words, looking at the ground to hide the blush on his cheeks, or he would give back as good as he got. But, thanks to Bucky, he had spent the last days giving too much thought to his interactions with Tony and today, for the first time in a long time, he refused to do either.
“Nah,” the blonde shook his head ruefully. “It never comes out the way I want it to be, so I've been unraveling it a lot to start over again.”
," he carefully stated, his heart thundering in his chest, reaching a pace usually reserved for his hardest workouts. Looking Tony straight in the eye seemed too intimate right now, instead he stared at the other man's reflection on the window glass as he tried to gauge the reaction to his next words. "And I don't know how to take it. Is this just teasing or are we flirting?"
"Don’t worry about it, golden boy. There's no better reason to bail than Captain America needing my help.”
He would never admit it, but he felt pretty proud when the hubbub stopped immediately and the kids looked down at their feet. That was until one brave, or in Steve's opinion irritating boy spoke up.
Tony shot him a glance out of the corner of his eyes before putting the coffee back in the cup holder. The silence that followed was only interrupted by the monotone sound of the wipers moving quickly over the windshield and the rain dropping onto the car’s roof creating white noise. Steve looked out of the window at the red taillights in front of them, searching for something to say.
“It's not creepy!” Steve groaned. “It's as normal as eating the bones narrow in pudding and gummy bears.”
The passenger window rolled down and Steve was greeted by Tony Stark's wide smile, bright as the city lights reflecting on the car’s wet surface. Perched on his nose was a pair of mirrored shades with a golden reflection.
touch his stuff again. How fucked up was that? And it was always like that. He never saw my accomplishments, only my flaws. I learned how to ride a bike, I wasn't fast enough. I won the science fair, didn't mean my project wasn't shit, it was just the least shitty.”
"Oh! I'm on it," Steve acknowledged and helped the vendor to hand out the cotton candy to the children, along with compliments for their costumes and the assurance that, even though he doesn't look that way right now, he truly is the real Captain America.
Tony was holding a steaming mug, probably filled with coffee, and wearing comfortable clothes. The sweatpants were one of the few articles from the declined mature hawkeye merchandise line, the billionaire found the deliberately placed arrow on the front of the pants hilarious. The loose fitting sweater was one of Steve’s favourites, the maroon colour suited Tony’s dark features perfectly and it was so soft that Steve had often actively looked for an excuse to touch it.
“You wanna know the secret ingredient?” she whispered loudly, with one of her hands cupping her mouth.
Instead of answering, Tony leaned over and turned the heating off himself. Steve got a whiff of his aftershave, and the pleasantly warm smell was familiar enough to carry a sense of calmness.
They found Natasha at the long dining table, her chair balancing on two legs and a paperback resting in her lap.
“Yes, yeah, peachy,” Tony breathed, his hands running over the sweatpants covering his thighs. Up and down, up and down.
Suddenly, his feet were in the air, his body moving on instinct and turning the jump into a somersault over the rough pavement.
“Maybe so, but I'm not their babysitter. And I may or may not enjoy Nat's less dark kinds of mind games,” Steve smirked.
“You keep telling yourself that, Captain,” Tony teased as they made their way towards the elevator, not even really knowing what he meant by saying that himself.
“He yelled at my mom for embarrassing him. She wasn't obedient enough or said the wrong thing. One time she laughed too loud at a guy's joke and Howard was sure she had an affair. Never mind that he was fucking around himself. He told me how disappointed he was, because I never created anything actually worthy to show to his friends and it was my fault that he was lying to them by saying that I was a smart kid."
“Stop making fun of me,” Steve demanded without real heat in his voice. “You're not allowed to when I come here with a resolution to your problems.”
Tony didn’t answer, he just hid his childish grin behind the scarf and pressed his freezing nose into the preheated fabric. His head started spinning as his senses were overwhelmed by Steve’s earthy smell. He threw his eyes open to look at the blonde man, who was still occupied with warming up the inventor’s numb fingers, and wondered when he had closed them.
Tony fell back into the chair and balanced the plate on his lap, mindful of the important clutter on the work table.
The supersoldier wasn't even startled by his teammate's sudden outburst. He had heard Tony coming out onto the balcony and had been waiting for the billionaire to say something, so he just turned his head towards him without stopping the movement of the needles. “I'm knitting,” he shrugged.
Steve's eyes had grown bigger as Tony kept on talking. He was right, they hugged all the time and there was nothing to it. Just a simple gesture of gratitude and friendship. There wouldn't be any new revelations if Steve and Tony hugged right now. There's no need to test Bucky's stupid theory because they already proved him wrong.
Later that night, when Tony walked alone into the quiet of his rooms  and started to undress, his eye caught his own reflection in a mirror. With delight he realised that the scarf Steve had lent him looked rather good on him.
Tony nodded, his lips too jammed together by his friend's fingers to make more than an affirmative noise.
"She asked me to pick you up in her stead. Said something about her days as your chauffeur being over since the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D."
“Great idea,” Tony exclaimed with false glee. “What are we gonna do? Set the Empire State Building on fire? Let loose some killer robots? I could maybe build a small army until then.”
Fall was flaunting its bright colors and most of Central Park's trees had turned a bright red and yellow. Steve couldn't help but be reminded of the flamboyant paintwork of the Iron Man armor. It was only natural that his mind would move to the man piloting it.
Steve hesitated, the robot wasn't very skilled in handling delicate things, but the sunflower was more robust than most flowers and so he gave in and handed it over, holding onto the plate with the PB&J himself.
“Yeah, him. His wife used to knit them a matching pair of socks every winter, but her arthritis had gotten worse and she can't hold the needles anymore. Walter wants to surprise her with a new pair that he made himself.”
Tony kept talking. It was as if a dam had broken, all the anger and disappointment over a father who was rarely there physically and never there for him emotionally. He told Steve things he thought he had long forgotten, but that had always been there, in the back of his head, still hurting - pain such a continuous part of his life that he hadn't noticed it anymore.
They fell back into an easy conversation about their teammates’ peculiar eating habits until Tony parked the car in the Avengers tower’s underground garage. Nevertheless, despite the return to their light hearted banter, Steve still felt the need to apologize once again for his mindless words.
Steve met Tony's eyes across the table, mouthing a thank you. The genius gave him a quick wink and continued to play his best friend for a sucker, while a lightning bolt flashed in the distance. Steve watched the raindrops race each other down the large windows, the sound of grumbling thunder and his friends' laughter merging, and didn't feel so cold anymore.
“When we had guests, he was the most charming person I knew. Good looking, humorous, everyone was hanging on his lips. He showered my mom with affections, always bought her expensive gifts she could show off to the other ladies. Sometimes, at the end of a dinner party, he would call me into the smoking room and he would point at me and tell everyone how brilliant I was and that one day I would conquer the world with some great invention. I wanted to be just like him and at the same time I resented everything he was, because after the guests were gone, he always got so much
Tony leaned back against the railing, nodding his head even though he didn't really understand what Steve meant. They stayed silent for a moment, Steve concentrating on his work, Tony soaking in the sun as well as the soulful music and the warmth that seemed to be radiating from Steve.
As he creeped closer, he could hear Tony humming a familiar happy tune, before he started singing beneath his breath.
“You wanna know what's gross?” Tony interjected loudly, leaning over the table towards Carol. “Rhodey used to microwave his underwear back at MIT.”
“I remember when I was eight, one of the video recorder's buttons was jammed and it drove my mother crazy. I took a screwdriver from Howard's workshop, opened the housing and had it repaired in less than ten minutes. Mom was so proud, called me her little mechanic and told Howard. But while loosening a screw, I had scratched the front. He took one look at that tiny scratch and tore the whole device straight off the cables, opened a window and threw it outside. He said I had destroyed it, that we couldn't keep scratched junk in our home and that I should
“Thanks. For the heating and for picking me up.” He looked down at the cup in his hands. “And for the tea. It’s just the way I like it.”
"Forget it," the brunette waved him off flippantly, but his voice was strained. He walked over to the breakfast bar, put down his mug and picked up a blue garment from the back of one of the chairs.
Steve shrugged and threw an arm over his shoulder, sharing his super human body heat with Tony, saying “Sure,” and steered him towards the hot beverages as confidently as he would lead him into battle.
Outside, the fog gradually dissipated beneath the beginning of light rain that set the basis for a cold and grey day. As it was getting closer to the year's ending, autumn was slowly bowing out and setting the mood for winter, the days getting shorter and the temperatures falling rapidly. Yet inside the Avengers tower's community kitchen, something bright and warm was just beginning to grow.
“Alright, but don't say I didn't warn you when the technobabble makes your head explode,” Tony gave in, picked up the soldering iron again and began to explain his invention to Steve.
Steve woke with a dry throat. He felt unusually hot and for a short moment he wondered if he was coming up with a fever until he remembered that he didn't get sick anymore.
Tony already liked the idea of spending the holiday with his teammates instead of business partners and overzealous employees. He still felt like he should voice some objections.
He didn't even know that he had taken his phone out until the click of the camera brought Tony back to his senses.
“Sure,” Steve agreed jokingly, his eyes already on a patch of large sunflowers. “He should be reminded that there is an outside world where more exists than screws and algorithms.”
Tony moaned as he fell out of the armor but Steve was there to gently catch him. He adjusted his hold to carry him bridal style and over to the medics waiting for him. Patches of blood covered his body and Steve could feel its sticky warmth bleed into Steve’s clothes.
Father Michael lived in the back of the church and he had Steve take a shower in his bathroom while he got him some clean clothes out of the donation box. The hot water felt great against Steve’s skin and for the first few minutes of his shower he just simply stood in the water absorbing the heat.
I know some of you are upset by the ending with Bucky. I reiterate, Steve's human. Since Part 1 I have been eluding to his smothered feelings for Bucky, long before he even thought of Tony any differently than just a friend. I am sorry it upset you and all I can say I have learned my lesson. I wanted the ending to be a surprise but from now on I will tag my fics appropriately.
Bucky surmised he was feeling guilty for making them worry or have to go above and beyond like make contingency plans.
Steve looked back down to Tony and his nose brushed against the time traveler’s. Steve flushed and pulled back a little as he asked, “Are you really alright?”
As he thought on it, the idea became more appealing. He could take Venom under his wing and explore the limit of his powers together. And with his intelligence, he would be like the son he always wanted. No one would be able to stand up to their combined greatness.
“Just Tony is fine,” Tony assured the nervous man. “Thank you, Wade…” Peter rose his eyebrows and Tony hastily continued, “And also…I’d like to apologize…for everything. I was a real jerk to you and it was all without merit…”
Tony jumped back in his suit and the armor sealed around him. He held his arms open to Steve and he jumped into his husband’s arms. They flew down to the others as Tony relayed what Steve just told him.
Tony felt like he was flying into a comic book fight as he attacked his opponent. The man’s flying apparatus was crafted with wings that had turbines, BUT they were tipped with bird feathers and his mask had beady little green eyes like a bird. Because if you’re going to be a villain might as well be a “themed” villain, right?
Steve watched him run to Bruce’s side and gently wrapped his arm around their friend’s tense shoulders. Together, they walked out of the room and no one said a word until the doors closed behind them.
– I love you, you Goddamn ass! I did not want to hurt you and the only way I used you was by proposing this scam of a relationship and truly loving it. I’m sorry I fucked up your schedule.”
Luckily, Steve let it slide and bid Tony good night with a warm pat to his shoulder as he stepped out on his floor.
." Steve huffed after the silence had gone on for too long. “I never knew that you were actually as egocentric as the press was making you out to be.”
Expecting Steve to be making another sketch of New York's skyline, Tony was once again surprised to find that, instead of a pen in his hand and a sketchbook in his lap, there were knitting needles and a ball of wool.
“Your father?” Tony asked carefully and Steve met his gaze with glassy eyes. “There was a side note, in your S.H.I.E.L.D files.”
He swallowed a bite of his sandwich before he started counting with his fingers. “A week ago, when we didn't know that we were invited to the same gala. The week before that, when my unibeam had knocked you out during training. Last month after the mountain troll ripped an empty armor in half and you thought I was still in there. When you gave a speech at the annual Maria Stark Foundation Charity Event. During that team building event Coulson tricked us to go to that we all hated. On your birthday. On
“Yes?” Steve asked with his eyes raised towards the ceiling, more out of habit than actually trying to face the disembodied voice.
Tony ignored her and marched over to the guy wearing a hot rod red three piece suit and a dark and shaggy wig.
"My God, Happy! I told you to take the night off. I'm literally standing right next to Captain America, what's supposed to happen to me?"
Natasha was sitting atop the kitchen counter, the stew already cooking in a pot on the stove next to her. Every now and then she picked up a wooden spoon and stirred the food.
With a deep sigh, Steve let his head drop down against his chest, before shuffling his feet towards the elevator.
"I never would have guessed. With your reputation and all," Steve quipped and then winced, unsure if the joke went too far. He knew that the rumors about Tony's love life were a great exaggeration and that the so-called playboy had often had his heart broken.
Bucky came up next to him and they continued to jog at a slightly slower pace, which was still faster than normal people's speed. Steve could practically feel his best friends glare against the side of his face.
Tony dropped his eyes from Steve's intense gaze and let his hand fall down to the blue scarf looped around the other's neck.
Steve wasn't sure if it was a nightmare or a relapse that had Tony crouching on the kitchen floor, but he counted out a streak of genius innovation. Those mostly came with more confidence in the inventor's posture and a lot more manic energy.
Black pavilions covered with fake spider webs were standing in the center in case of rain, but the weather held steady. Tables were spread around where costumed staff helped kids with different activities. There was pumpkin carving and crafting skeletons out of papier-mache and a little contest of folding paper bats and seeing which one would fly the furthest.
When he held it out for Steve to take, the supersoldier recognised the scarf he had made explicitly for his friend and waved his hands in front of him.
He wasn't surprised when he found the avengers' shared kitchen lit. It wasn't unusual for one of their team members to have trouble sleeping through the night and they all found it easier to spend those nights at the communal floor, where there were signs scattered everywhere that they weren't in this on their own.
“I think I'll take the risk,” Steve quipped and moved closer to have a better look at Tony's work. “I'm actually interested in trying to keep track of your genius.”
Tony took off his shades and put them in his breast pocket before turning his body towards his friend with a crooked smile. To his own surprise, Steve felt relieved about finally being able to see the brunette’s warm eyes instead of his own gold appearing reflection.
“There's gonna be a lot of alcohol at Stark Industries' Halloween Party and I thought it would be better, safer if I knew I could deal with it before I have a relapse in front of a thousand party guests.”
“Now go and hug Tony like that,” Bucky said over his shoulder. “And tell me that it feels the same.”
Coulson had to stop himself from running his hands over the plane’s id number on the tail. He had to keep some decorum with the junior agents watching his every move. Instead, he marveled over the genuine numbers, attesting to its authenticity. He was usually stoic in front of the junior agents but right now he couldn't wipe the smile off his face.
Steve’s eyes were drawn to Tony’s chest. The thin shirt couldn’t hide the blue glow of Tony’s heart.
They stumbled back to his bed, a mass of tangled limbs and eager mouths. By the sounds Steve made, he sounded very appreciative at learning how to keep warm.
“I don't need Jarvis to babysit me,” Tony stated stubbornly. “Give me a gun and hiking boots and I'm ready to go.”
Steve's gaze dropped and he stared at the arc reactor embedded in Tony's chest. His blue eyes were a maelstrom of emotions and glowed eerily in the reflection of the reactor as Steve considered Tony's words. Finally, he lifted his gaze and stated, "I can’t lose you again, Tony, and I’m not going to deny my feelings anymore. I want you. All of you and all that comes with it."
relationship…and Wade loved their son. Wade was serious about Peter so that meant being serious about his parents. He planned on being with Peter for years to come and Peter was close with his parents so Wade would be the same.
Steve watched him with a fond smile as Tony dragged himself over to the fire and plopped himself on the ground beside Steve. He ridiculously felt more happy by the fact that Tony was drawn to his side when he was barely conscious.
Eventually, with the minutes being fleeting, they were forced out of bed to get ready. Steve moved mechanically as he showered, dressed, and shaved, but, all he needed to do was glance to the side and find Tony doing the same things by his side and he felt more human…more relieved. The few times Tony caught his eye, he smiled at him and Steve felt his own lips twitch upward in response.
“By the look of that mark on his neck and the stupid grin he’s wearing, I really doubt he is,” Natasha reasoned.
“Wait a sec-!” One of the Americans interrupted. Without looking at him, Tony raised a hand with his repulsor glowing and the man shut up.
“Fuck you and your selfish feelings,” Bucky growled. He grabbed a fistful of Steve’s hair with his metal hand and drew back his head. He hissed against his lips, “You don’t want me to kiss you? You want me to be pissed at you? You want me to kick you out of here. Fine. But I am still going to look out for you. You are still my mission…” Bucky paused and his faced relaxed from his snarl into something tender. He whispered, “Or do you want me to make you forget him? Fine. Done. It is going to happen unless you command otherwise.” Bucky rubbed his semi-hard length into Steve’s thigh and Steve inhaled sharply. Bucky obviously had a carnal idea on how to make him forget.
“He should be out in a few hours. The doctors will do what they can to help in the healing process.” Coulson grasped his shoulder and gently whispered, “We’ll keep you updated on his progress. Go back to your room and try to get some sleep. You look exhausted.”
The team and their extended families were on the terrace. Most of the Avengers were by the small pool Tony had installed just last year but Steve, Tony, Bucky, and Natasha stood around the grill. Bucky was cooking almost three dozen hot dogs on the huge grill but he also kept one eye on the cooking meat and another on the pool and the children playing within it.
“Stark is alive?” Bucky asked, his voice detached. Steve stilled like a deer scared frozen by oncoming headlights and after a strained pause, Bucky said, “I should go.”
“Fire or ice…I guess you can’t stop me,” Steve gasped in wonder. He ran his hand over his scalp and felt the stubble of new growth.
Being together was becoming normal and it was something he started to need and enjoy. He couldn’t imagine his life without her and he did not let himself linger on such thoughts. They were supposed to be together until he finished training her. After, they were supposed to return to their respective masters and most likely never see each other again. Thinking about their bleak future ultimately made him think of other possible futures which made him physically ill because he’d then be disobeying his master and that was not allowed.
Having listened in, Jarvis stated, “At these levels, the suit will require a full charge in three more hours.”
“I’m sorry, I did not hear that,” Steve said to whoever was on the phone. Steve suddenly blanched and his wide eyes fastened on Tony. Steve whispered, “Peter? Is that you?”
Steve gripped the cushioned seat beneath him tightly, his joy over learning Tony was alive began to dwindle as his anger grew. He gasped, “You mean he’s going in halfcocked again. He’s pigheadedly not asking for help.”
His vision spiraled and the last thing he saw was his son and the rest of the Avengers running toward him.
Steve felt uncomfortable looking at those warm eyes. He put away the file and reminded himself he was going to meet his mate soon and the thought that Tony's eyes looked nice was
Steve rubbed his back and said, “Of course! But in the meantime, since Uncle Tony is waiting on his coffee, do you want more to eat?”
“It is I,” Uncle Thor announced as he swooped in through the newly made hole. He held out his hand to him and said, “Come, Peter.”
After spending an entire day shopping with Maria and then a few hours with Tony in his workshop, he was utterly exhausted and fell asleep on the sofa in the library. He woke up with a soft blanket draped over him and Tony’s teddy bear tucked between him and the couch. Howard sat up with a small smile as he picked up the bear. Maybe he was making progress with his son after all…
He must have come to some sort of conclusion because he dropped his head and turned back around. His expression was closed off and he went straight back to the elevator, leaving Tony dying of curiosity again.
Steve draped his body over Tony’s, his chest was instantly sticking to Tony’s back from their combined sweat. He jerked his hips harder into Tony’s backside upon his request. The smaller man groaned agreeably beneath him and Steve satisfactorily smirked. He sucked and bit at the back of Tony’s neck and kept both his hands on his hips to control his thrusts.
Rogers sat at a table outside the shop wearing the same baseball cap and sunglasses as he had when he had knocked on Peter's door. He had a small cup of coffee with him but he only held it and never once took a drink.
Steve’s expression grew a little more grim but, with resolve in his voice, he settled back down into the pillow and said, “We need to have them over soon.”
Steve grasped both his cheeks and pulled down his head to kiss his forehead. Bucky moved compliantly and Steve rested his head on his chest and wrapped his arms around his neck. He whispered, “I love you, Bucky. I always loved you. You were my first love…”
Century, there were still events and peoples whom he had no recognition with. Steve put the magazine down and reached forward to card his fingers through Tony’s lax hand. Tony’s fingers sluggishly curled around Steve’s fingers and he smiled sweetly at him.
“Bits and pieces,” Bucky replied non-committedly. He closed his fist and hoarsely whispered, “Every day, I remember more though…”
“Wasn’t he dead?” Clint added with a venomous glare at Loki. His statement was more of a threat than a question. Loki grinned and leaned back against the railing.
Bruce led the way into the Tower and they bypassed secretary at the front desk without a word to her.
Tony watched his father with wide eyes as he circled him. He was so young and this eyes were alive and dancing. That haunted look was gone. What had caused it? Could Tony find a way to…
She left with a nod. Once she was out of earshot Tony raise his hand for a high five and said, “I think Winterwidow Part Four went off beautifully.”
He was met with silence…total silence. Wade lifted his head and saw everyone had turned toward him. It was only then Wade noted the hoarseness of his throat and he realized had raised his voice. He couldn't meet any of their eyes because he knew he'd see the truth in their gazes...
Bucky’s flush deepened and whispered, “I just said something I used to say about her eyes, I…I loved the color of her eyes.”
The waiting room was a hive of activity. Mostly he saw worried or pained expressions of people waiting to be seen by a doctor. He avoided their eyes but he saw a few do a double take as they recognized him. Did these people know what happened to him? What did the Avengers reveal to the public? Or did they think he was still in his right mind and had been tucked away safely in the Tower for the last week?
Steve escaped his hold and quickly strode up the stairs. Tony spun where he sat and asked again, “Steve??”
Instead, Steve agreed, "Till the end of the line." He clasped Bucky's forearm and they stared at each other for several seconds. This could be one of the last moments he interacted with Bucky but no other words needed to be said.
They were taken to a conference room since the interrogation room was too small for the half a dozen lawyers that came with Tony. Despite Tony’s objections, he could not go with them and promised to wait outside.
Despite everything: the drama with the media, Peter’s reveal, and his subsequent dating of Wilson…Tony wouldn’t trade this life for anything. Because he was loved by his family and could love them in return.
He just wanted to lay back on the couch and pretend…pretend Steve was still there, they were snuggling again and Tony was sharing another aspect of his life with his soulmate just like he did every night and all the nights to come. He just wanted to pretend Steve would not fade from his memories just like the images of his father had.
I tracked him down,” Tony continued, looking down at him with a smirk. He probably saw the eye roll.
In midair, he caught Pepper then used his own momentum to throw her on the container beside Tony. His feet hovered over the container for a second but since his entire body hovered over the open air he began to fall.
“Due to his erratic behavior, Mr. Solo will most likely be placed under psychiatric observation for the next 72 hours before he is charged officially,” Jarvis stated and Rogers’ face fell.
“And now we shall feast!” Volstagg stated merrily. He clapped Thor’s shoulder and their prince nodded heartily.
Steve had reopened some wounds and was bleeding again and felt a little dizzy because of it, but he ignored it in favor of watching the approaching figures. Vision and his load would be there shortly. His fellow Avenger was growing impossibly larger as he flew quickly toward the Tower. The quinjet was behind them, a speck on the horizon but it too would be there in no time.
,” Steve retorted, his flush growing redder. Blood pulsed to his dick at the very thought of Tony touching himself, nonetheless to the images of
Tony stumbled after him, gasping, “You want me to woo you again, don’t you? Admit it, you romantic dork!”
And when Steve lay limply in his hold, sobbing his heart out Bucky held him gently, lightly petting his head as he did.
"Not to mention my arm practically fell apart after the snap so I was down a limb too," Bucky chuckled.
“You’ve been helping me out too,” Peter countered. Turning to Steve, Peter stated, “He was there for me when my identity was revealed…”
“No, Bruce is right. Daddy should turn right back around and listen to mommy instead of running away,” Natasha interjected.
, Steve. Those are my feelings on the matter. So what were you going to say just now? Are you still going to ask me to make you go…” Bucky pushed Steve into the wall and thrust his hips into Steve’s. He whispered in his ear, “Or are you going to ask me to make you come? Which is it, Steve?”
To all of you who have commented since I last posted, I promise to reply to all of you over the next few days! Thank you for the patience! <3
As they cuddled and Tony was telling Steve about Pepper’s reaction to him having a soulmate when Steve suddenly perked up.
He commanded his friends to stand aside and went to the elevator to meet the detectives in the lobby.
“Very,” Bucky said and he shot the imposter in the leg. The imposter yelped and dropped to the ground.
Coulson represented SHIELD and the Captain probably was not pleased with SHIELD at the moment. But, it did not matter how Captain Rogers perceived him. His hero was broken and Coulson will help him heal. Affirming his mental status was only second to that. Coulson whispered, “Hello, Captain Rogers. I am Agent Coulson.”
“Ow, little tender!” He gasped from the pressure of Tony’s kisses on is bright red skin and Tony shot back with a look of alarm. Steve smirked and said, “I did not say stop, just be a little gentler.”
He looked away from Tony and his eyes found Peggy’s instead. She stared at him with pity and a newfound understanding. After days of pestering him about it, she knew now why he and Tony stopped seeing each other.
Happy was in a coma, Pepper almost died, Steve was badly injured, and Peter had almost been kidnapped. Tony had been having really bad anxiety ever since he nearly died in the vortex during the Chitauri attack and it felt ten times worse now.
Tony only half heard her as Steve’s fingers began to caress Tony’s shoulder. He was slowly making his way toward Tony’s neck and all Tony could think about was that one spot where he was extremely sensitive, right behind his ear, and how much he wanted Steve to touch him there.
She smiled sadly at him and whispered, “We’ll send Tony to boarding school until you or SHIELD find out who is trying to kill everyone from Project Rebirth and stop them…Then we’ll bring him right back home.”
Bucky was clapping along with the beat and whooping for Steve and encouraging him through his poor dance moves. Steve kept stumbling into Dum Dum and tripping over his own feet. It was quite a sight seeing such a large man have such wobbly limbs. Tony smiled despite himself. Steve’s clumsiness was endearing.
And now here she was and her and Wade were scrutinizing each other very differently. MJ look mostly shocked and Wade’s expression was of barely concealed trepidation. Peter instinctively reached out to his boyfriend and put a comforting hand on his arm.
Steve toweled off and paused as he considered is clothing options. He boldly decided to wear only a bathrobe and tightly tied the belt around his waist with a flush. He was already growing aroused and soon it would be blatantly obvious.
On the inside, he was overjoyed by Tony’s words. He could not believe he missed the signs that Tony was also attracted to him all those years ago. Looking at him now, Steve could see the love in Tony’s gaze and hear the affection in his voice.
And Cap was frozen until recently so it made complete sense why he never registered onto SI Online. He was still learning the basics on how to work computers. He probably hadn’t known SI Online even existed.
They strung Steve up, his arms spread eagle, hanging from his wrists. They kept him in the suit, perhaps it was to affront Tony or maybe it was another American symbol for Kilian to destroy. As soon as he was hanging freely, he tested his bonds and was displeased to find that the chains moved with him. They were made for him to pull at them and not strain against his strength. Whichever way he pulled, swung, or maneuvered his body he fell no more than a few feet and in no way loosened his bonds. He gave up after a few minutes and looked around him, hoping to find something else to help him.
No one had thought his mysterious lover was in fact was the dead Captain America. After a while, when neither Steve nor Tony did anything scandalous, the paparazzi stopped bothering them and moved onto the next big story. They knew it wouldn’t last and, when it was eventually revealed, the paparazzi’s attention would increase by tenfold.
Tony stepped back and tore the gloves off Steve’s hands then rubbed his hands with his. Collecting both of his hands, Tony brought them up to his mouth and exhaled heavily onto them. His breath spread warmth across his skin and made Steve’s heart race and a flush cross his cheeks.
Steve’s heart was beginning to frantically beat against the inner wall of his chest. He decided to jump right into this. If they were being casual there was no need for romance, just carnal pleasure. Steve looked up at his reflection in the mirror. His hair was already starting to dry and was growing lighter in color and his face was bright red. Steve patted down the burning flesh, trying to dispel the coloring. He gave up with a sigh.
“He’s probably one of the most famous people of this century,” Father Michael chuckled. He asked, “Are you looking for him?”
“Growing up, I had one of your old recruitment posters in my room,” Tony explained. “And it did not encourage me to join the army but it did encourage me to jerk off.”
“You look good,” Steve assured him. Tony glanced up at him in the mirror’s reflection and saw the super soldier looked a little flushed.
“You two have been going through my stuff,” Tony stated, glaring at both of them. Neither Natasha nor Bucky looked his way and continued talking.
“And where will you be leading me, Cinderella?” Wade asked, his mouth never breaking free from its smile.
Before their hands fell all the way, Tony pulled their hands to his mouth. Steve held his breath as Tony kissed his hand. The first was similar to Steve’s and chaste. The second, Tony opened his mouth and raked his teeth against his skin then his tongue unexpectedly flicked out and tasted his skin. Steve shivered as he was reminded of the last night and tightened his hand in Tony’s grasp.
Peter fell into Wade with a shuddering gasp. Wade’s insides felt like they were expanding and knowing that Peter had ejaculated inside him sent him over the edge. He came seconds after he did, with a moan that sounded similar to Peter’s name.
“It’s almost time for Harry to head home,” Tony said with a shrug. “Plus it’s already over their time limit.”
Tony lifted himself with a grunt and threw himself over Steve. He jutted out his bottom lip and whined, “Quickie! Quickie! Quickie!”
He'd eaten before he got there to avoid any sort of meals with the parental units. Wade leaned in and murmured, “Nah, I’ve already had dinner.”
“I really like you, Tony,” Steve whispered. “I…I know we can't but…” Steve chuckled to himself and mumbled, “I don't want to leave this alone now that…that I know.”
The school year stretched out and seemed to last forever but eventually summer came and Steve no longer had to sulk while his boy was gone. Peter would still have playdates with the children from school but Ben set them up with Steve.
Tony sighed heavily and said, “Never mind.” He turned to Steve and asked, “Did you see enough? I think we got the basic idea. Big bad Hydra equates to SHIELD in her mind. We probably should not try to convince her otherwise on the first date…”
“Is there something wrong, Captain Rogers?” Norman asked so sweetly that it was obviously dripping with contempt.
Before Tony, Steve had dreamed of finding another man to love and be loved in return. However, he assumed it was far-fetched. He thought, at most, he'd only be able to keep seeing the men who were only interested in him for his body. The idea of creating a relationship, nonetheless being able to marry another man seemed impossible.
“How do you want to do this?” Peter questioned, “Do you want to carry me? Or should I sit on your back?”
Natasha was always watching him. At first, she was looking for betrayal, she thought he might try to get revenge for her attacking him but he acted like she never did. Then she was looking for him to come at her for her body. They were soulmates so it was expected to be intimately involved and she slept with a knife under her pillow, unwilling to share her body for a principle. But he never came to her, not even for a chaste kiss.
They were still laughing when they went down to the garage, where Happy was waiting for them with their ride.
Tony hugged him back without question and Steve nuzzled his face against his neck, inhaling his scent and feeling his pulse.
Bucky jumped right on the idea and spent over a week on the letter. He would not let Steve or Tony read what he was compiling. When Steve visited him, he found Bucky’s living room filled with crumpled papers. From what he could see of them, they were all written in Russian.
They left the sewer without incident. According to Venom they had hibernated for a few days as they bonded. So the streets were no longer crawling with SHIELD agents and the populace was back –
“Just don’t let me catch you sleeping here again,” the officer stated in warning and then walked away.
“I take it I already have a statement ready and waiting for me,” Tony dryly asked, laying his head on Steve’s shoulder.
“Get out of here!” Tony angrily shooed them away. When the men and women back off, with the help of security, Tony murmured to Steve, “The trial is going to make it harder to control them…”
Tony’s eyebrows rose, out of his control. Did Steve really just agree? Mr. Conservative and Apple pie agreed to a homosexual relationship? Although it was a fake one, it was still a gay one! Tony clarified, “You’re alright with a fake,
Tony could not stop the initial onslaught. The story was going to be published no matter how many connections he pulled and how much money he bribed with. The story was out and, despite it being the middle of the night, it was already all over social media, spreading like wild fire. If the news outlets did not run with the story, whispers of a cover-up would tarnish Steve’s reputation further. So Tony had to grit his teeth and let it happen.
Wade had hunched over, clutching his head and Steve bent down with him, trying to help. Tony turned away and looked back to his son’s image. As he looked at Peter, he felt like he was standing on the edge of a cliff. His toes were already over the edge and he was just barely supported on his heels.
Howard wordlessly slipped into the bed and draped an arm over his son’s small form. Maria’s fingers found their way to Howard's scalp and gently carded his hair. She whispered, “What did Peggy say?”
Coulson nodded his head in goodbye and left, coming within inches to the sealed closet door as he passed it.
Smirking, Steve got to his feet and said, “Alright, I’ll let the others know. We’ll move out in an hour.”
{No} his voice whispered, so quietly he could barely hear it in the silence of his home. Wade picked up his head in surprise and his voice continued, {Our baby boy…he’s hurting and something is wrong…He needs our help. We need to help our baby boy.}
Tony’s face crumbled and he looked like he was on the verge of tears for a second. However, he closed his eyes and took a steadying breath and, when he reopened his eyes, he stated with a determined voice, “I’m going to figure this out. If I could save myself from the edge of death…then I can do the same for you.”
After everything they sacrificed, did Hydra still get him in the end? Was this the beginning of his life as the Winter Soldier?
“I am being ridiculously ravished right now by a ridiculously handsome man with a ridiculously perfect body and some ridiculously smelling lube.”
“The ‘Look at Natasha’s belly I want another baby too’ look,” Tony replied, closing the grill cover. The last of the hot dogs were out and sitting on the plate beside the grill.
They moved slowly with the music and literally simulated what it was like to gently make love standing up. Panting shallowly, Tony continuously ran his hands over Steve’s chest and back muscles, he thrust into Steve’s thigh, and rubbed teasingly at Steve’s erection whenever possible. At breaks in the music, they’d either pause to catch their breath or steal a kiss.
“The Chameleon,” Natasha supplied. “He is the master of disguise…But he’s supposed to be an elusive spy to be bought by the highest bidder, not a one-bit criminal bank robber.”
No one attempted to stop Steve as he stalked out of the building. Steve did not pause to say hello to the agents he knew and worked with nor did he look back.
“What about the future?” Steve asked uneasily, like reminding Cable of the possibility would change his mind.
Tony punched him in the shoulder. Steve looked back to him with a frown and Tony grinned, raising his boxing gloves higher and dancing on the tips of his toes.
“The man who goes by ‘Solo’ is being booked by the police right now,” Jarvis announced and Rogers flinched down as if he thought Jarvis was going to swoop down on him.
Happy drove them in a Bentley with tinted windows and dropped them off at the park. He would come to pick them up when Tony called him.
Steve shook his head and whispered, “I’ve only told Bucky…” Tony ticked his brow and, with a dry tone, sarcastically said, “Well, I’m your soulmate. You can tell me anything.”
Bucky and Natasha both automatically pointed their weapons at the imposter, while Tony and Sam exchanged confused glances.
“Getting you naked seemed more important than getting a shave,” Steve smartly retorted, making Tony chuckle again.
“…Uh,” Steve murmured. His mind instantly went blank as he tried to think of a good deflector to the question.
Peter chewed on Steve’s reply for a moment and did a set of stretches. As he sat up, he asked, “So we can’t help Uncle Bucky or Auntie Tasha get together anymore?”
Firstly, for her new instructor to find her. He was a senior agent who had no idea of her identity and he was supposed to locate her as a part of her training. Her task was to stay hidden as long as possible. Once he found her, and she had no doubt he would, he would begin training her in long-distance surveillance, sniping, and tactical maneuvering.
“Your nanotechnology is no match for my creations, Stark,” the doctor chided. “As always, I am the better scientist, inventor, and –.”
Tony guided Pepper to the counter and sat her down. He went over to the coffee machine and started a new pot for Pepper. Steve took his usual space at the counter and began his tale.
Venom screeched and surged to Wade, leaving Peter staggering after it as he was dragged along. He saw it sharpen its body into dagger points and Peter stumbled to get his feet under. He dug his heels into his rug and it slipped on the hardwood, making him fall back and he jerked Venom back with him.
He could tell Tony wasn’t sleeping either by the way his fingers were lightly tracing designs into his skin. Steve eventually grasped the hand and carded his fingers into Tony’s. Steve caressed and played with the other man’s fingers.
Bucky turned the imposter onto his chest and pulled his arms behind his back. Natasha handed him some handcuffs and Bucky accepted them with a grin.
Their second kiss was wilder. Their mouth’s pumped each other for sustenance and their hands explored each other’s bodies in a desperate frenzy. Tony’s touch unlocked a primal beast in Steve that ate away at his inhibitions. Gone were his fears and insecurities. All he needed was Tony, all he wanted was Tony, and nothing else mattered.
He looked back to Bucky, guiltily biting his lip, and truthfully replied, “I…I met him a few days ago.”
Thor’s friends readily agreed and made their way down the rainbow bridge, talking loudly and laughing even louder. Thor watched them go with a found eye before turning back to Heimdall.
Peggy and Jarvis arrived a few moments later and Jarvis went right up to Tony without a word. Iron Man’s eyes glowed brightly as it took in the damage to its master.
The sun slowly drifted down to the skyline and it took him a few hours to realize that it was not dipping below the horizon.
People still walked down the street and laughed without a care. Traffic consistently got worse at rush hour. The sun rose and set. Clouds migrated across the sky. The world turned on its axis and Pops rotted in his grave.
Tony tightened his legs and drew their hips together until their cocks touched. They both moaned heavily into each other’s mouths upon contact and paused to gasp heavily as they adjusted to the new sensation. Tony moved his hips, humping himself into Steve and ran his hands over Steve’s torso in an act of incredible torture.
Tony grumbled under his breath but followed his orders for once and pushed himself onto the counter with a hiss, “Ohhhhh, that opened it up more…”
“Remind my body that all is fine. That we are safe…and that the other half of its soul is alive and I’m sure my nightmares will go away quicker.”
There was light knocking on the door and Howard quickly lay the fresh compress on Tony’s forehead before answering it.
“I bet you’ve looked at them loads of times,” Tony countered. “Don’t you see them? The big dipper and the little dipper?”
Solo scoffed and sarcastically said, “Alright ‘Steve Rogers’ let’s keep moving before the boys in blue show up and forcibly move us along.” Steve kept his eyes on the tower as they walked away and Solo laughed and added, “Hey! You should ask your friend there for some booze! I hear he has the best in the country!”
He latched back onto Peter before he could respond and Peter threw back his head and arched his back, gasping, “
!” Venom screeched and Peter felt its tendrils tighten around his body. Peter had enough time to hiss in surprise before being flung out of his window. They fell two stories and his Spidey Sense flared in warning but he had no time to react as he landed on a car. It collapsed and shattered glass sprinkled the air.
Somehow they fell asleep and later Bruce woke Steve with a tender touch. Steve blinked open his salt-crusted lashes and Bruce motioned for him to be quiet.
Tony sighed heavily in frustration. He was getting nowhere…and, on top of all of this, he had an icing problem to fix and a new suit to design.
“It’s actually perfect timing,” Natasha replied. “He needs to cut back on everything. Taking a week to celebrate is just what he needs.”
But Steve only got to admire his gaze for a few seconds as Tony cleared what little distance there was between them and pulled Steve into a tight embrace. They shared a deep kiss and then parted just slightly.
Ben stepped back and called, “May, can you please come here? I need you to tell me if I’m seeing things…”
Peter was sitting on the couch in the living room when they entered the room. His son looked up at them with a knowing grin but forwent teasing them. He folded his arms behind his head and loftily said, “My and Eddie’s hypothesis is correct.”
“LIAR!” She screeched and lunged toward him from her seat behind the prosecution. One of the lawyers from the prosecution grabbed her and she struggled to get to Steve. “You’ve seen me!” She hissed, her gaze was wild and she looked like she would kill him.
“I should be detaining Sergeant Barnes right now,” Coulson stated with a frown. “But out of respect to you and the horrors he went through, I am not going to. He is your responsibility. Whatever he does will be your burden. After all of this, I want him locked down in the Tower and if he even hurts another American citizen, he
Steve smirked and let Tony believe whatever he wanted. Steve said, “So I came out to you and then what, you swept me off my feet?”
Tony shook his head and whispered, “I couldn’t chance it. When the events unfolded like they did in my timeline, I saw it as a sign that I could right the future and save you from the fate of the Winter Soldier and the rest of the world from Hydra…I just…I just wanted to make everything right, Steve. I can barely live with myself for what I’ve done…but, if this is the last thing I do, I need to save the future at least.”
Tony half expected both men to have another hug out but Steve surprised him by retorting to Bucky, “You’ll get used to it.”
Yet as soon as he reached the doorway Steve had been standing in moments before, he ran into Natasha.
Silence formed between the Avengers. The only sound that could be heard was the beeping of Steve’s heart monitor and the slight hum from the lights overhead.
Eddie crossed the lab to where Mac’s workstation was. Peter was right behind him and Eddie said, “Mac was making a bio-sentry.
He remained standing in his spot, waiting for Steve to tell him off or start the awkward conversation about wanting to be just friends. Tony was practically vibrating from the tension.
She silently walked up to the bedside and peered down at his face. The lurch inside her was more powerful and painful this time. She always pictured him in her mind as the boy she first saw, smiling nervously with such hopeful and loving eyes, but right now Peter looked like a corpse.
“Agent!” Tony stated, “What’s up? I thought we had something going? Why do I have to hear about Hammer Time and his robot from CNN? I thought I was your go-to guy for technology danger,
Thank you everyone for reading and especially thank you to those of you who have been commenting! Your kind words encourage me to write and, personally, they helped me through a really bad couple of days this past week.
"No, no, no," Tony responded, shaking his head and grimacing as he did so. "Not in the way you'd really expect. Look, I need your help."
This school was going to be a brand new opportunity for Steve Rogers. Things hadn't been quite right since his little volunteer program with the US Military, and now he was kept under close surveillance of his only "family" left-Uncle Coulson.
But school would be different Here, he was going to be himself, whoever that was now, and try his best to give society his all once again.
"But not today," Steve said with a warning, glancing at Tony. "We can't exactly afford another problem today."
The very last hour of the day, Steve regrettably swallowed hard and walked into the gymnasium, decked out in too-tight shorts and a t-shirt from some random university. He breathed a sigh of relief when he saw both Natasha and Clint waiting eagerly to see him walk through the door.
Howard looked at his son, and put a proud hand on Tony's shoulder. "This man in front of you," Howard said proudly, "is the result of my first chemical weapon. SHIELD had me develop a man who could be a part of the army without completely standing out. I developed the super-soldier. Steve Rogers is my super-soldier."
need help in chemistry," Bruce interrupted, "I'm your guy. Not this idiot," he pushed tony back jokingly, "who thinks he knows
"Holy shit!" Tony quickly attempted to sit upright, only prevented by the table that was laying over his chest from Steve's makeshift shield. As soon as he realized, Steve sheepishly removed his arm from Tony's chest, and took the shield off of his arm.
"What if I'm wrong, and Bruce really is gone?" Tony asked, his voice shaking. Steve could see the tears in Tony's eyes that he was trying to hold back, the lump in his throat that was preventing him from sobbing
"Well," Bruce forced an apathetic chuckle, "I just became an insane green monster twice in less than 24 hours... I'm pretty sure I've been better."
But, for now, that wasn't important. It was a new school, and the only thing on Steve's mid was figuring out where the hell he was headed for each of his classes.
"Tony, what are you-" Steve tried to stop him, but Tony let loose with the extinguisher, ramming it into the control panel. After a few final beeps, the control panel lights blinked back to green, and the now shattered screen read:
"Hurry, damnit!" Clint screamed. He grabbed the gun from Howard, ran into the lab room, and shot it, right before Bruce's hulk completely burst out.
"Easy solution," Clint grinned as he pulled out an arrow from his quiver. He loaded his bow, took aim at the already shattered glass, and fired.
For now, Steve was only going to focus on the motorcycle in his garage. As he lay under the motorcycle's uplifted body, Coulson stuck his head into the garage.
"He can pack one hell of a punch." Steve glanced at the punched in table, and let out a nervous laugh. Tony kept quiet.
"It's not a problem, really," she responded. "Let me walk you to class." Just as she said that, a spiky-haired guy in a t-shirt, jeans, and converse came up from behind her and wrapped his arm around her waist, kissing her head.
"How should I know?" Tony shouted back, a desperation rising in his voice that Steve had never heard before.
Steve gave Tony a thumbs-up on the table. "Thanks. I started thinking I shouldn't be in this class, but I guess if I have a willing tutor..."
"An experiment program? You've got to tell me more about it," Howard almost shouted in Steve's face, standing directly in front of the young soldier.
Steve grinned at Tony, acknowledging that he heard him. "Hey, Tony, I'm Steve." Of course, Steve knew that he would have to put as much effort as possible into learning the material he had missed-since it wasn't the beginning of the school year-and fast, but once the lecture started, he knew that would almost be impossible.
The prideful voice turned around. Well-kept and goateed, the kid looked like he belonged in a college class. "Hey, kid," he started, "I'm Tony Stark. Nice to meet you."
"Yeah," Tony replied breathlessly, making room for Steve next to him by the door, "I'm pretty sure we can rule 'guy' out as a possible explanation, don't you think?"
Steve pushed himself up, smudging motor oil on his face. "I'm not sure 'ready' is the right term. Nervous? Yeah. Scared for my life? More than anything."
"Look at us," Steve motioned to himself and Tony, "D'you think that after all that we've been through in the past night, we're able to work with one of the most dangerous types of radiation out there? Being this tired and beat up?"
"Uh, guys," Natasha began, "I haven't seen this thing yet, but my guess is that we need to figure out a way to get out of the line of fire. This isn't going to be pretty."
"The one I'm looking at in particular," Bruce continued, "is pretty close to both physics and medical science. For a while now, I've wanted to see the impact of Gamma radiation on living organisms. Because, I mean, we use X-Rays on people to get a good look on bones, and UV radiation to dry nails faster, and everything else, so why not Gamma?"
"The good news is that he is befriending all the right people. There is this kid, Clint Barton, that's affiliated with Romanov, and then there's Bruce Banner. But I'm guessing they're good influences. Tony Stark and Natasha Romanov wouldn't be affiliated with them otherwise. They have-well,
"No, no," Howard said, shaking his head and then looking directly at Steve, "you don't understand. I help develop weapons for the military. I was told about an experimental program. I need you to clarify if this is the one I was told about it."
." And he smacked Steve across the room to the same spot that Tony landed. Steve's body of steel impacted and cracked the glass in the same spot, and he landed chest-down with his arm sprawled across Tony's chest.
, but he's a genius. Top ranked in his class, number one in the running for his class' valedictorian, scholar, being given scholarships from every top engineering school in the country. Both of them are fine to have around Rogers," Fury assured him.
, if you will. We have to be careful. God knows how many people out there want a sample of his blood."
"So, does anyone have any ideas as to how we're going to be getting the Hulk somewhere safe? I mean, if Bruce decided to go all mean and green again, don't we want him someplace where he won't kill anyone?" Natasha asked.
"Come on," Steve spoke with his soldier-like initiative, picking up Tony and shoving him over his strong shoulder. The two ran into the control room,where Steve placed Tony down in the rolling chair and strolled him to the control panel.
"There's Bruce Banner. He's kind of a science nerd. He's in chemistry with me and Tony Stark," Steve continued. "It's kind of a different class with them-"
"Bruce had a sort of, well, meltdown, if you will, last night. And I need more than me and Captain New-Guy here to give me a boost of his esteem. I can try to explain the rest of it to you when you get here."
Steve sat in awe. "So, I'm working on chemistry homework with the son of... you mean to say that Tony's
Howard flashed an angry glare towards her. "Whatever is happening, I don't believe it. That is completely im-"
"There's something else, isn't there?" Tony asked. What was funny was that he could tell his dad was listening in now. He wasn't completely sure why his dad would want to know why Steve was involved in the military, but Tony wasn't going to object.
"Hey, it's not an issue," a voice like silk responded. Steve threw his head back up to see a red-headed girl in skin tight jeans and a leather jacket.
"It was this specialized, top-secret experiment program thing. They needed a volunteer and my parents and I weren't exactly well-off, along with the fact that my dad actually used to be in the military and, well, let's just say he's not around anymore..."
It was all full, aside from one lab bench in the back that was completely empty. As Steve made a beeline for the open seat, the teacher stopped him.
Steve sighed. "In our experiment, Bruce went into the lab room to set up the rats for the gamma radiation and... I tripped over a chair in the control room and started the radiation while he was in there."
But instead of hearing Tony's voice, Steve heard what could be only described as a subhuman roar. Tony landed at Steve's feet.
There was nothing. Nothing but the big shape, towering ominously over what seemed like a small lab now.
That was the breaking point. Bruce slammed his fists into the ground, grunting in both his voice and the Hulk's, heaving up and down. His muscles rippled, his entire body increasing in size.
"Ok," Tony muttered to Steve, "here's the plan. I just called Clint. He'll be over in a little. Us childhood friends of Bruce's will try to console his pain, and you can try to come up with a story about what happened that doesn't involve, you know, us… and what actually happened..."
"Whatever," Natasha said as she started to walk toward the rock climbing wall, "I'll be over here doing something useful."
Steve just turned red and fell to the ground. "Sometimes I wonder if all those girls you get caught kissing in the janitor's closet are just an act..."
"If Steve has these classes with all of these protégés and descendants of super-geniuses, don't you think you should have someone in the backdrop kind of looking over them?"
A chemist, a physicist, and a super soldier walk into a lab... and the physicist has a crush on the super soldier...
Steve tried to stifle a laugh. "It sounds like a plan. I'll drive Bells over later, around 5-ish, and I'll bring food. Then we can start."
"I've heard that Tony is a child prodigy in physics. You know, robotics. Mechanical engineering. That sort of thing," Coulson noted. Steve relaxed a little bit.
"That's just what we think," responded Bruce as they walked into the classroom. "But if we try it out on a few of Mr. Stark's leftover lab rats-quite literally, rats he hasn't used in experiments yet-just to see what happens, what could go wrong?"
"Good," Steve gasped. It felt like he had been holding his breath the whole time, despite having a cool facade.
Bruce tried to push himself up again, succeeding and wrapping the blanket more around his entire body. "Well, I'm sure the Hu-" Bruce cleared his throat at saying the name of his new alter-ego, "the other guy-" he continued, "probably won't let me die any time soon. I'm pretty nervous to see what happens at even the slightest change in my surrounding environment at the moment."
"Hey, easy, it's his first day," Clint responded, punching Steve on the arm. "C'mon, I'm going over to the archery station. You can watch or you can learn, but I think it's the best."
"I'm pretty sure, you don't want to know, sir," Steve said, "it's not exactly a pretty sight. You can tell by the state Bruce is in now. He was the victim."
"And, everyone else? Those are the only classes I've heard he has with the other super-geniuses and protégés. What about when he's
"Didn't he notice the thudding of our bodies being thrown across the room last night?" Steve muttered to Tony as they walked out of the lab room and up to the living room of the mansion.
"I'm going to go drag Bruce into a new lab. I'd appreciate some help, but you know... While you guys decide what you're going to do, I'm gonna get my archery equipment out of my trunk just in case," Clint said, getting up from his cushion-y chair.
"When we were fighting Bruce's rage monster, you looked like you completely knew what you were doing, like it was all just the same to you. You looked so... at peace with yourself, which is probably completely the wrong word to use."
Tony shook his head. "Give me a second." He slowly got up and moved to the control room, grabbing his cell phone and putting it to his ear.
After the entire description of the lab that went horribly wrong, the four went into the kitchen to get breakfast.
"I'm pretty sure she grew up in Russia-they have good mountain climbing there, right?" Clint sounded clueless, probably because he couldn't take his eyes off of Natasha's rising ass.
When he was far enough away from him, Howard pulled a fragile test tube out of his coat pocket. "Hey, Rogers!" He hollered, Steve picking up his head automatically like a good-old-fashioned soldier would at his name. "Think fast!" Howard launched the test tube in Steve's direction, but about five feet off.
"So," Bruce tried to push himself up, failing and falling back down to the ground, "what are you trying to tell me?"
Before completely fading out, Steve saw the Hulk sit back down in his corner, the breathing slowing, and his eyes closing gently.
"Damnit! I almost forgot that the door locks on the inside, too. Tony! Come over here, with your key!"
The girl stood up at the same time Steve did, pushing her hand out in front of him. "I'm Natasha Romanov. Don't think I've seen you around before-I know everyone here."
"Mother of God..." Howard muttered, putting his hands to his mouth. He almost fell over. "It really is... it really is you! The super-soldier! My super-soldier!"
Steve stood up in shock from the sudden move Tony had pulled. His legs pushed the chair out from between them,and he whirled to stand at Tony's eye level. If looks could kill, Tony was sure that Steve could have axe-murdered him then and there. The chair had pushed the two apart, though, and Tony was hardly whispering distance from Steve now.
"What if you're right, and Bruce is the big green thing we saw, that threw you across the room and-" Steve cut off suddenly. "The room is basically clear," he whispered, "and look."
But, now that Steve had been a student at this school for more than a month, it finally felt like things were falling into place, particularly when he started a big extra credit project with Bruce and Tony.
"Oh, god-" Steve turned around and Tony rushed to his side to see what changes the control panel had initiated.
"Coulson, I'm the principal of the school. Clint Barton is an ultimate archery protégé that happens to be one of the best in the nation, and also the deadliest. Bruce Banner isn't quite much of anything
Tony rubbed the back of his head. "I'm not completely sure. All I know is that you're alive. And I'm pretty fucking grateful for that. I can't go losing my best friend and my chemistry grade all in the same weekend. Maybe later you can die, but not yet."
Halfway through the school and around a corner, Steve said good bye to Natasha and Clint and walked into the class.
Tony walked over to the smear on the wall, and started rubbing the back of his neck. "Oh, hey. Looks like the rats did explode. Cool."
"Do you doubt the strength of the safe-rooms in Stark Industries?" Tony asked, pretending to be insulted. "My dad has these rooms with radiation exactly like Gamma for specific reasons, so he's had them radiation-proof, shatter-proof, basically break-in proof. It's like military-grade steel turned glass. Pretty cool stuff."
Clint came into the conversation. "It's not that we think you can as much as it is that..." he started backing away, taking his jacket with him, "that we know you need to try."
"So," Tony said, making it awkward. The awkwardness just escalated when Howard came and leaned against the wall behind Steve and Tony, watching Clint and Bruce. Tony shrugged off Steve's hand instinctively, what with his father being so close to them.
Coulson shook his head free of confusion. He walked in front of Steve, his hands behind his back patiently, "Steve, we need to get going."
Howard couldn't help but interject, just as Tony was about to put his arm around Steve to console him. "Wow, thanks, dad," Tony muttered. No one heard him.
In the middle of Tony's flirting, the doorbell rang, and Howard sighed. "I suppose I can get that." And he marched, like a kid being sent to his room, up to the foyer to let their guest in.
Steve greeted Tony, putting a hand on his shoulder. "So," he said, glancing at Tony and then back at the scene in the lab.
Howard turned, and his eyes grew as wide as saucers. "Holy-" he paused, and thought for a second, "Ok. I have something for this kind of thing," he ran to the neighboring lab control room, pulling out a nasty looking gun. "This is a military-grade Stark Tranquilizer. It-"
Both of them, later accompanied by Tony and Natasha, stared at the shattered glass wall and the broken door.
Tony glared at Clint. "Shut up, birdbrain." His eyes dashed over to Bruce and back to Clint as a warning.
"Get back," Steve commanded, grabbing the nearest fire extinguisher. When Tony refused to move, Steve gently nudged his companion out of the way. He started wailing on the door with the fire extinguisher, over and over again.
"What the..." Howard looked more confused than anyone had been about the entire situation. "Now that that... thing is down, for now, can someone please tell me what is going on?"
Clint snapped his fingers in front of Steve's face. "Hey, captain drift-off, mind giving me the holder for this bow? Isn't exactly mine, y'know."
"I'm not that strong," Bruce said, his voice even more mutilated. His skin was starting to turn an eerie green. "I... can't..."
Natasha stretched out her leg skillfully to the row of yellow blotches, but Steve and Tony were a different story.
"Ok, ok," Tony sat up, putting his hands on his lap. "You can't tell Bruce this, or at least not until he gets his inner Hulk under a bit of control. When Steve and I were in the control room, I got bored and..."
It didn't help that the dynamic duo of Bruce Banner and Tony Stark weren't in any of the rest of Steve's classes The time allotted to pass from class to class was the only highlight, where Steve could greet Natasha and Clint and maybe, if he was walking through the science hall, see Tony and Bruce.
He grabbed the table, and, with the advantage of the activated super soldier serum coursing through his veins, turned the legs in, making it a shield.
"I would have expected the radiation button to have been under a case, too. My guess is there isn't one for a stop button if there wasn't a case for a start button on a radioactive experiment," Steve replied. "We gotta find a solution. Stark, our friend is in there."
"I-I-I-" He was speechless, and turning red. He shoved his head back down again, resorting to collecting his books.
"How about..." Steve started, "well, crap. I guess we can't really win at anything when we play with Tony Stark, huh?"
"I'm feeling like a bit of an idiot that I doubted Steve would be safe now," Coulson admitted sheepishly.
He held up his mauled shield proudly, marching toward the huge green hulk like he was going to be a hero. He stopped about ten feet away, and proudly declared, "Listen… Hulk, was it? I know Bruce is in there somewhere. So, let him back out. You just smacked your best friend across this entire lab room, and now he's lying over there, completely unconscious. I will avenge him, right now, while you are in this state and Bruce has no power. I-"
Especially in chemistry, he and Stark and Bruce were all becoming better friends by the minute, even by just adopting Steve into labs that were only designed for two people.
"Nope," Steve held his head high, and then made a sweeping motion towards what could be seen of Bruce and Clint. "We had a bit of a mishap with the radiation."
What does PE Class look like when you spend it with Clint Barton and Natasha Romanov? Well, Steve Rogers is certainly about to find out.
Finally, the end of the day rolled around. Steve sped home on Bells. He emptied his backpack of everything but chemistry books and the necessary rations: cans of coke, chips, popcorn... He was set.
"Bruce, buddy," Tony started, rubbing his back in a back-and-forth motion, "calm down. This lab can't take another beating."
"Dad, what I'm doing isn't the problem. Bruce is becoming a green rage monster, and fast. We need to get a tranq in him."
Tony came over and sat on the other side of Bruce. "We were working with gamma radiation, trying to see its impact on living organisms. Bruce walked into the lab room to prepare everything, and..."
"Why do you immediately look at me for a solution?" Steve asked, throwing his hands in the air defensively.
"That's actually why I decided to contact you tonight. I have some news that should keep us a bit on the edge of our seats for the next few months," Fury replied, remaining in all his seriousness. "I've only heard conspiracies, but there are plans to either come into your house or come into the school and take him. Or part of him. Anything that has Steve's DNA is almost guaranteed to have the genetic code to the serum, so we have to be careful."
"No, he's right," Bruce's voice came from the doorway. He was wearing his very stretched out pair of... shorts now, with Clint's jacket draped over the top of him again, "we need to do it again. I won't be involved. But we have to do it again... at least, you do."
Tony nodded. "Yeah, human again. I'm not sure about you, Mr. Coulson, but I don't exactly consider a giant green rage monster to be human."
"Yeah, Cap," Tony breathed, "I got it. But you aren't hearing me: I'm almost positive that it's Bruce!"
"I dunno, Tony, I mean, do you really want to give that a shot?" Steve asked, but Tony's answer was cut off.
"Well, that's one thing we can check off the list," Bruce almost laughed as he took the glasses from Tony's hand and put them on. "Thanks." He reached over and gave Tony a big, Hulk-sized hug.
Tony tensed in surprise then awkwardly returned the hug and whispered, “I promise, Steve. I won’t let anything happen to him.”
Natasha ran her hands down his sides until she reached his hips and then pressed his hips to hers. He moaned into her mouth as the friction between their bodies made him electrified with desire.
Steve licked his lips and reevaluated everything he knew about the man before him. He asked, “Why so long?”
They exchanged glances, Eddie excited and Peter wary, and then leaned forward together to watch the reaction.
“A blocker?” Tony whispered and looked to Steve. Steve knew he thought the same thing as Tony. Could this new player be the one who hired the Chameleon?
Was it because of the whole identity reveal? Was that the stressor that had skewed Peter? Or was it something else?
He had just gotten back from the zoo with Peter and Tony. Tony had paid Peter and Steve equal amounts of attention but he was especially attentive with Peter. Steve did not mind, in fact, he loved watching the two of them interact. This was not unusual for Tony however. He not only made Peter toys but he also gave him clothing (all Iron Man merchandise, of course) and made sure to see him every day.
Tony opened his eyes to Steve glaring at him. His grin grew larger and he said, “But Cap, it’s your theme song! I have my theme song on my phone!”
Most of the group broke off and only three were wordlessly elected to lead him. They led him past the glass doors he had landed in front of and escorted him to another corner of the building. They were leading him to wherever they wanted to question him most likely. Tony rolled his eyes but followed. He’d play along to get deeper into the building but once they stopped Tony would push on through.
“It’s still reacting!” Peter countered but it felt like his heart was pounding frantically upward, getting closer to his throat. Brown meant death in their solution but, even if a portion of their sample survived, it would be a victory.
– to make sure someone was going to be there to see us. I was so positive someone was going to be there…I’m sorry, Steve.”
!” He pointed his repulsors at a glowering Red Skull and yelled at Steve, “Goddamnit, Steve! Don’t ever do that to me again! I nearly died when you touched that syringe! I mean,
Tony snorted and mirrored Bucky by crossing his arms across his chest as well. He teased, “Trouble is my middle name.”
Tony rested his head on Steve’s shoulder and whispered, “Yeah, that’s because of light pollution. The city is a glowing galaxy in its own right but it makes it impossible to see the galaxies beyond our reach.”
Steve flushed and embarrassedly glanced at Bruce who was openly staring at both of them with his mouth slightly agape.
So he rolled around aroused and restlessly with his hips involuntarily humping the air, looking for relief. He knew most of the images and actions his mind supplied would never happen but the ones he knew possible made his cock twitch. Namely, that they were probably going to kiss.
Steve would rub his back like Bucky used to when he was having an asthma attack and whisper sweet reassurances to him until he calmed down. Solo’s episodes usually lasted only a couple of hours every few days. Afterwards, he would always pretend like nothing was wrong and he’d go back to joking with Steve as if nothing had happened.
Tony snuggled into Steve’s side. All of his husband’s muscles were soft and relaxed and it reminded him of a giant teddy bear. Sighing contently, Tony agreed, “30 minutes…”
Peter slowly pushed himself in, moving gradually and with care. He didn’t want to hurt Wade even though he knew about Wade’s healing ability. Wade felt…touched. He reached up and cupped Peter’s face. Panting shallowly, Peter’s eyes flickered to him and fastened onto his gaze. That emotion was there in his gaze again. Wade dared not to name it out of the fear of being wrong but…but the way Peter gazed at him reminded him of the way he’d look at Peter and…he
Tony grinned at the super solider and all the mock seriousness disappeared. Tony led their dance into a wild spurt that had no rhythm or sense. It was just the spinning around, jumping with Gabe’s beat, and holding each other close while sharing laughter and fun in the circle of their arms. They tripped over each other's feet and fell into one another and just laughed and laughed and laughed.
Natasha and Bucky wordlessly exchanged glances. Steve was unable to read into their silent communication and his worry and ire grew. He demanded, “
Peter lightly kissed him, avoiding the worst of the drool with his lips, and Wade finally showed signs of waking when he inhaled sharply and choked on the pool in his mouth. Peter chuckled as Wade cleared his throat and sleepily opened his eyes. He smiled as soon as he saw Peter.
,” Tony said, his voice laced with concern. He reached out to Steve and Steve stepped back, shaking his head.
It took Steve a little over a week to fully recover. He slept a lot and ate a lot and spent all of his waking moments with Tony. True to his word, Tony helped him fill in the gaps to his memory and his reminiscing even triggered Steve to remember things himself.
“Did that munchkin just call you ‘Papa?’” Tony asked Steve. He stepped next to Steve and peered at him skeptically.
“That may have worked before your top dogs were on the FBI’s most wanted list yesterday -,” was all the man was able to get out before Natasha dropped kicked him. She struck him in the head and he was out before he hit the ground.
Wade ripped off his mask and pressed his face into Peter’s hair and wetly gasped, “I love you too, Peter.”
Thinking of Wade distracted him from his more morbid thoughts. He flushed to himself as he remembered the last conversation on the phone. Peter had been a little emotional at first and had demanded Wade not kill any more without any explanation. Wade gave in easily but Peter couldn't help but wonder if Wade felt put on the spot. Over the years the Avengers and the X-Men had been on Wade about killing. Time and time again Wade would refuse to stop. So...why did he give in so easily to Peter's request?
Steve’s face crumbled as soon as his eyes fell on the image. Tony only saw the deep sadness in his eyes for a second before Steve masked it all away.
Eddie ignored him and grabbed the largest beaker in the lab, placing it next to the smaller beaker of their experiment. He poured the contents of VENOM into the big one and it sloshed noiselessly into it and it settled almost immediately. There were no ripples from the impact and such an unusual phenomenon sent a shiver down Peter’s spine. Keeping his eyes on the alien substance, Peter murmured, “Ed, we should study this thing before we do –.”
Tony clapped his arm again and tried a different route. “Alright, let’s start this over. We started out with an unconventional beginning. Hi, I’m Tony Stark and you knew my dad when he was younger than me. How about we sit down and we talk, starting from the day your plane went down?”
Peter reached into the bush and Steve heard a loud crack. Peter pulled half the bush out and said, “Look, Papa!
They both were sitting in the van waiting for them. Sam was in the driver’s seat and Tony was furiously tapping away on his laptop. Both of their tech armor was tucked away in the back where no one could see it as they drove.
She went up to James and picked up the gun he was still holding. She put her hand over his and made him pull the trigger, shooting the chair. Bullets peppered it and smoke began to rise from its new holes.
“That!” Tony point an accusatory finger at him. “This is what I’m talking about! You are an open book to me, Steve! I can see you’re indecisive! What is wrong??”
He looked to her and saw she was smiling warmly at the both of them. She whispered, “Now you really have to tell me everything.”
Steve made himself, Tony, and, Thor (after asking the team if they wanted any) BLT sandwiches. Several pounds of bacon later, all three men were full.
Their first picture was of them laughing trying to squish their faces together and not drop the bears.
Steve nodded but then winced as he remembered Howard. He replied, “You can, but we have our top scientist there right now and…he may want to look you over too.”
-!” Solo scrambled to his feet and Steve held out his hands to try to calm him down. Solo hissed, “You’re one of them! You’re an alien!”
The American camp was much larger than the Russians’ camp. It was on the water with a port and had a number ships docked. Snow had been cleared away for roads and instead of tents there were buildings.
But life was short and Steve was not going to waste it pining after something he could never have. He figured God had other plans for him and he was fine with it.
Tony glanced down at Steve’s boxers and realized his fiancé had worn the joke, American flag boxers Tony had bought him today.
In his era, these kind of people were reviled but now…it was a norm. They were passing laws so they could get married. Steve did not know what to think. In his era, he’d never paid attention to the flints downtown. He never really had an opinion about them…his world was Brooklyn, work, his friends, and standing up to bullies.
He kept his hands on the young man he was helping out of the rubble but his head shot up and focused on the person who had asked him the question a few feet away.
Steve had only the span of a few sleep addled seconds to focus. Bucky barged into his room like he always did when he thought Steve was sleeping in too late and in another step he’d see Tony in his bed.
Wade blinked open his eyes to find Peter’s hazel eyes staring into his. His eyes were half lidded and filled with such emotion that Wade nearly choked. How long had Peter been looking at him like that?
Tony’s mouth dropped his then he pushed himself off the counter and said, “Help? Yes, I can. Good idea. I’m glad to do it! Don’t want you straining yourself…We’re up to four fantasies now by the way.”
Peter changed into his Spider-Man uniform as his parents argued about Peter leaving. With his backpack of civilian clothing on, and his mask in hand, Peter embraced both men, effectively shutting them up.
Jarvis nodded and stated, “I estimate I will have a remaining 5 hours of charge if no events happen that force me to use more energy.”
He pretended he did not have a destination in mind. The forces thinned as he made his way to the back of the line. At the rear itself, were just the injured with their medics and a few soldiers trying to correct an upturned truck.
the hell?? How are you here? Alive? And…” Tony motioned to all of Rogers and asked, “How are you still so…perfect?”
A month ago Peter would have thought such a thing ridiculous but now it made butterflies fly around in his stomach.
Steve was drawn to him like a moth to a flame and he knew he was going to eventually get burned…But he didn’t care.
The defense went first bringing forth character witnesses for Steve, evidence of Tyler’s stealing from the Tower, and medical records on her mental incapacities.
“Jeez, you make me sound like an invalid,” Tony joked. To Bucky, Tony assured, “It’ll be alright. I’ll complain and demand attention and the others will get over it and think it’s me just being a diva as usual.”
He dashed over to the pair as he relayed that and was in front of Wade in seconds. He worriedly hovered over Peter and, to Wade, gasped, “What happened??”
On top of the rabbit’s head his son held up the present Clint had thrown up there and asked, “Can I open dis one?”
Natasha sighed and leaned into his side. She whispered, “Promise not to tell SHIELD I talked to you about my mate?”
Ben slid back and stepped up. He held out his hand to Steve and helped pull him up. Steve cradled Peter closely to his chest and Ben gently grasped his elbow and led him to the elevator.
The same high-pitched alarm that had first incapacitated the symbiote, rang over the hospital’s speakers. Venom immediately faltered and fell. Like it had with Peter, the symbiote stayed attached to Steve but broke away from him in tendrils. Because of their connection, the alarm was more painful to Steve and he covered his ears to try to muffle the sound.
As the third song started, Steve whispered ironically, “You’re right, no one danced like this in the dance halls.”
When the main entry door came into view, Tony was a little disappointed to see it. Steve turned to him and said, “Thank you for joining me. I…I like spending time with you.”
They were trying to create a living shield that protected its host from environmental and human factors. It was going to be revolutionary if it worked. Their protoplasm was strong, durable, and reactive to outside elements. Ultimately, however, it was supposed to protect whatever DNA it was fused with and fusing the protoplasm was going to be the hardest part.
Bruce smirked and folded the page over in his book. He closed it and placed it on his lap as he said, “I am always down to talk science. Now which science are we talking about?”
Steve and Tony tore away at the metal until Pepper yelped and begged them to stop. They both knelt, Tony’s face plate going up as he did, and peered within to where Pepper was tangled with the metal.
Tony’s smirk widened into an all-encompassing grin. He sat next to Steve on the floor, pausing to lightly kiss Steve’s forehead, and then looked over the toys in their hands. He asked, “What are we playing?”
Steve kept his head lowered until he heard Thor inhale sharply and his head snapped up, his heart already racing with scared hope.
The news footage was not much. It was shot from far away and mostly focused on his dad and Uncle Thor. He saw no signs of how the rest of his family was fairing and it made Peter worried. He usually listened in on the fight indirectly through the communicator of whoever was with him but, being alone meant he did not have access to one of the Avengers or their communicators…
He had a newer message from Sam Wilson from while he had been in the shower. He touched it to open it and spun around on his heel to leave the room, planning to read the text as he walked.
“Marking my territory,” Tony said, his voice rumbling in his throat, sending a thrill down his spine. He grinned possessively and raised the towel to wash him there. Steve motioned him to stop and Tony looked questionably at him.
“He called me his possession,” Steve murmured, grasping Peter’s tiny hand. “He said, ‘You are mine,’ then kissed me…And when I felt his lips on mine, I…I felt something.”
Comprehension dawned in Steve’s eyes and he wordlessly nodded. Tony held his hand out to Steve and Steve gently grasped it like they were about to shake hands. Their timers beeped again, confirming what they both already knew and dreaded: they were soulmates.
“You are my target,” he murmured. The compulsion was nearly gone but it was still there, lurking in the back of his mind.
Steve sat Peter on the railing but kept a firm hold on his waist and a wary eye on Peter’s strong tiny hands. Peter leaned forward and only watched the lemurs as they lounged against the topmost branches. Any movement from them made Peter twitch from excitement.
Steve let them know they were fine but, he was drained from the long car ride and stressing over Bucky. As soon as his best friend saw him waiver slightly, he pounced on Steve and made the others give him some space.
Bucky leaned into his chin and thoughtfully stared ahead at the line of soldiers marching. Tony was definitely shell-shocked and his ailing health may be affecting his judgement but…
But it's back and I wanted to let ya'll know that  took some inspiration from CACW in this chapter but it does not contain any spoilers from the movie! Enjoy! :)
Steve positioned himself between himself and the President and replied, “I find that odd since I am in the way of you and your target…Where’s Rhodes?”
“I just want to speak with him, even if it’s only for a moment,” Steve said, glancing from Solo to the tower.
Steve walked on so he didn’t see Tony’s reaction to his offhand comment. His face contorted and he felt sick.
He and Steve kept their promises. Tony had completely cut himself off from the Commandos and moved with Panzer and his team. And neither one of them approached the other.
“I would hope,” Sneaky replied, dropping its hands. “I will be very upset if you guys invited another futuristic robot to the party and didn’t tell me.”
Without any warning, Bucky’s fist shot forward and knotted into Steve’s shirt. He pulled Steve toward him and smashed his mouth against his. Steve opened his mouth as he gasped sharply. Bucky took the opportunity to shove his tongue past his lips and explore his mouth.
Wade double checked his phone and then looked at the Tower, looming over him like a sinister castle. It seemed to glow brighter than all the others in the dark of the night.
It happened so fast Peter could barely process what had happened. It was only when he felt the blood that he realized what Venom had done.
Bucky fist pumped thinking he dodged a natural ailment of aging…but the horrible irony was that he’d never even get the chance to lose his hair because he was going to lose his life first.
And he thought Steve was dead so this sudden departure had to be traumatizing. Tony probably assumed he was gone for good.
“Tony had it hard before you…” Natasha stated. She took a sip of her drink and asked, “Did you know he made a program for soulmates to find each other faster?”
Yeah, Tony heard his dad, but he had also done the math. No more Hydra meant zero Hydra. Something that is dead
“I think if he wanted one of us dead, we would be,” Tony told him. “Everything I have seen on the Winter Soldier shows that his shots never miss their target.”
But Tony wouldn’t hear any of it. He dragged Steve to his kitchen and deposited him at the counter. He then opened both his fridge and pantry and quickly emptied their contents out in front of Steve.
The Commandos laughed and Tony rolled his eyes. He replied, “Alright, jerks, I’ll see all of you in the morning.”
He made Happy drive him around until he finally decided on returning to the Tower but he didn’t go to the penthouse. Instead, he went to his lab and took comfort in the bio-shield.
Tony smiled into his mug, happy. Bucky was so much more like the man he once was when Steve was here.
“Okay, I’ve got his hips,” Natasha quickly retorted, grasping Tony’s hips. Looking to Steve, she commanded, “Steve, you grab his shoulders. We need to move him at the same time to not worsen his wounds. Whoever is closest to the wound put immediate pressure on it. Alright?”
Steve’s unfinished question did need to be spoken aloud. They were all thinking it: Or was it Venom?
Cable carried the reckless Avenger back to the ground level and was met with a company of heavily armed SHIELD agents running up the same stairs he was coming down.
“I’m preoccupied,” Wade retorted, rubbing his face against the side of Peter’s. Peter smirked and leaned deeper into Wade's hold.
The sun had set a while ago and the roof was warm beneath their feet but not too hot that it didn’t burn them as they laid down and looked up at the cloudy, night sky. They lay side-by-side and Wade cushioned Peter’s head on his bicep.
“…It’s human, Tony, don’t torture yourself,” Steve used his own words against him and spun them in accordance to this current situation almost perfectly. He continued, “Let me help.”
"It's Tony, right? You've got that dumb look on your face," Bucky accused and Steve straightened his features.
Intuitively Tony listened to the command that had been bellowed in what the team had dubbed The Captain’s Voice and immediately stopped in his tracks before even processing what was going on. He had just rounded the corner to the common floor after changing out of his business suit and into a washed out pair of jeans and a burgundy henley. Inside his head, he already estimated how long it would take for the Iron Man suit to arrive, how many vital minutes he would have to fight without the armor.
“Are you two planing to stop any time soon or will I have to declare bankruptcy in the near future?”
"The suit is brash enough, but your shave isn't precise," Tony concluded and wiped his thumb over the smudged paint at Steve's jaw.
They both looked in confusion at the sunflower before noticing Dum-E still next to them, dutifully holding the flower, and finally running out of patience for not being paid attention to.
Steve's skin flushed until his face was nearly as red as his suit. He scratched the back of his head, Tony could only guess how badly the wig must itch, and gave a defeated sigh.
Instead of answering, Steve stepped closer, took gently hold of Tony's chin between his fingers and pressed a soft kiss to his lips.
Steve felt his ears gathering heat and gave an apologetic smile as he stood up and dusted off his track pants.
"I was actually thinking about another seventy years being frozen,'' Steve countered before ducking his head and hurrying to get in the car.
The brunette eyed the spoon outstretched towards him as if he was held at gunpoint. He blinked twice before glancing up at Steve, who tried to radiate as much sympathy and calmness as possible.
Steve noticed only now the two cups to-go standing safely in the center console cup holder. Opting to save the argument for later, he picked up one of the cups and took a sip. His face contorted as soon as the bitter taste of black coffee hit his tongue.
. The weather is changing, the temperature's going down. You'd never admit it, but we all know you’re not a fan of the cold. That’s why I had your seat heater on the highest setting. You were shivering earlier.”
"Your imitation of a heartless business owner looks great, but you forgot the glasses in the shape of dollar signs."
"I just can't seem to censor myself, not even at a family friendly gathering," he continued with a shrug, though Steve knew him good enough by now to notice the self-deprecating tone in his voice.
“You shouldn’t drink and drive," Steve scolded him as he started on his own drink. Red fruit infusion with a spoonful of honey.
"Because that would be a lazy depiction of a complex character. How about some psychological facts stating that sex and killing a man trigger the same area in the brain? You could wrap it up in a joke."
"Oh, shit!" Tony jumped up and searched around, remembering why he came outside in the first place. “I can't, I've got a shareholder meeting in-,” he took a quick look at his watch and grimaced. “...well, ten minutes ago. Have you seen my glasses around? Oakley. Violet.”
“That’s because you’re weak Americans." If her voice sounded disinterested, Tony was sure that it was just because she already knew what was going on.
Black Widow. Now stop criticising my dress choices. Why should a halloween costume make sense, isn't it enough to be sexy?"
"He just can't stand to look at you right now," Tasha waved him off. "He said, and I'm quoting, you're ruining the sexiest thing he knows and he fears that it will take some time before he can enjoy watching me in a fight again."
“Of course I do, he's my friend. I'm not one of those guys who are too manly to admit it. I love you, too, you know.”
Tony waved him off. “Not a hardship, it’s an easy order. Not like Bruce’s, either the water is the wrong temperature, the tea brew too long, not long enough. No barista could ever get it right.”
With quick steps, Tony went back inside towards the kitchen area, leaving the balcony door open. He had to rummage a bit between the food, but he found his shades beneath a bag of frozen peas. They were ice cold and foggy when he put them on.
Steve got up and threw the empty container into the trash can before holding his hand out for Tony and pulling him up to his feet.
“Yeah, thank you, good to know,” Tony murmured as he rushed through the slit between the still opening doors, eager to leave the conversation behind.
“I was looking for alcohol,” he pressed out, embarrassed to admit it, but needing to lay it all out in the open.
Carol kept eating, unimpressed, but at least Steve had the decency to look sheepish. “Nat makes a really good stew.”
“Well, you did good, JARVIS,” Steve assured him and cuddled deeper into his pillow. He slept better knowing that someone kept an eye out for Tony.
Steve looked down at his shoes, feeling uncomfortable with having been read so easily. Captain America wasn’t supposed to be so blatantly vulnerable.
It was an easy decision to exchange New York’s streets for the gym’s treadmill for his morning run. He’d rather not have to pace himself because he found himself walking through a wall of white and couldn’t see further than his own hands. Plus, in his profession it was always possible that the change of weather hadn’t come naturally but had been created to support some super villains’ sinister plans, so it was better to stay ready at the tower in case of an alert.
"No, he's not," he countered, his eyes following where she pointed at and failing to detect the tall blonde's head between the costumed people.
It was during a recounting of getting his drunken pa away from a game of dice to bring him back home that they were interrupted by JARVIS softly speaking up.
While his eyes were fixed on Tony’s chest, the smaller man brought up his hands and pressed them against the super soldier’s now naked neck.
“Feet of the table, Romanoff!” Tony admonished her before putting his cup down on the counter and sticking his head inside the fridge. Still, he wasn’t quick enough to hide from her observing eyes.
“Sorry, my friend's a bit over dramatic,” Bucky told the person as he easily stepped over the leash.
“Let's go home. You can talk to Stark and maybe I can get Natasha to spar with me,” he leered with a wiggle of his eyebrows.
Tony rolled his eyes at his antics. “Alright, Mr. Working Class, keep wiping the floors. But don’t expect a reward.”
Never judging, never pitying, his gaze on Tony only ever full of patience and empathy. Every now and then he'd pitch in some kind words or a story of his own.
Despite the short notice, they had gotten a permit to hold the party at a small public park in Queens and even found a decent band to perform. Sometimes, money was its own kind of miracle worker, Tony guessed.
normal. We have the capability to help people and the responsibility to do so. One of my many responsibilities is the company.”
“You're not helping him, are you?” Tony asked, eyeing the river of cobalt blue wool assembled in a crude pattern.
"Are you really mad at me for making you a gift?" Steve frowned, feeling unsure, but also unwilling to take the scarf back and shoved his hands into his pockets.
“Steve-” Tony tried to interrupt him, not entirely sure how he felt about other people worrying about his concerns, but the Captain didn't let himself be stopped.
Soft music was playing on the common floor mixed with the sound of rain pattering against the large windows. Tony recognized the playlist as one of Nat's, the songs carrying a sense of doom that in his opinion only a former KGB agent could find catchy. The space was sparsely lit and he followed the most prominent light source towards the kitchen area, Steve close behind him.
"Yeah, you fucked up," Steve sighed, but couldn't keep a straight face in front of Tony's indignant stare.
Tony let out a long breath. He didn’t like talking about the subject, but Steve was always on and on about the importance of communication, so might as well. “It’s okay, Steve. You know, I wouldn’t have made it this far without your support. You guys have been a big help. My reaction wasn’t the best. It’s still a sensitive topic for me, but it’s gonna be easier with time.”
“Are you gonna tell me what this was about?” he asked with a wave of his metal arm. “I know what this was about and I need to know if you know, too.”
“I don't know if you're more excited about actual sparing, the naked kind, or both at the same time.”
Steve studied the older man's face carefully. “I know even more music Howard didn't like,” he pointed out, hoping to read the situation right. “I could make you a playlist.”
Whereas the shade of blue had clashed with Steve’s eyes, it was exactly the same as his own eye color.
“I can't act outside of my prescribed parameters. I can only ask for help if Sir tells me to or is in mortal danger.”
The tension left the engineer’s body as quickly as it had come. He looked over to the far end of the room where Steve was still moving a mop in wide arches. His wet clothes had been replaced by gray sweatpants and a beat-up shirt with the S.H.I.E.L.D logo on the front. On his feet were those ridiculous cleaning slippers he got from Clint last Christmas. They looked as if someone had skinned a poor poodle, colored its remains purple and glued them to the sole of the ugliest pair of sandals they could find.
Steve found Tony a little while later near the bonfire, trying to teach children how to dance. One boy, dressed as a squid, excitedly grabbed the billionaires hands and spun them around. Amused, Steve watched them trying not to trip over the wildly flung tentacles.
"I can see that. You're under real distress. You should take a break," Steve deadpanned and pressed the sandwich into Tony's hands, pretending not to notice the affronted look he received. "Sit. Eat."
“Fuck, Steve,” Tony exclaimed with a hand clutched to his arc reactor. “Stop being such an asshole!”
Smiling, Steve shook his head. The notion was ridiculous, but if Bucky needed proof that Tony was nothing more than a friend to him, he would show it to him.
"He's an idiot," Tony grumbled as he examined his burned skin. "He's the reason of 80% of my lab accidents. Look at this blister!"
The AI understood him anyway. “There seems to be a problem with your apartment's plumbing. For now, please use a sink in the common area until a janitor is called in the morning."
“You think he really can do that? Building a screen that raises itself wherever the color is darker so that blind people can read their messages by touching their phone instead of having to listen to it?” Steve wondered aloud, his voice full of amazement.
Steve flinched and stared dejectedly at his hands. She was right... He had abandoned Peter and that was definitely something - something horrible. He flushed red from shame and bit down on his lip.
He kept smiling as Tony applied the cool lather and had to force himself to stop smiling and relax his muscles so Tony could shave.
“I will be back in an hour, there is something I have to take care of...” Steve retorted, contorting the blanket in his grasp. He did not look his way, feeling guilty for doing what he was doing. Maybe his grief was clouding his judgment but at that moment Steve knew he had to contact Bucky.
Tony stirred and his grip tightened on the toy Steve had left in his hands. Tony rubbed his eyes with his closed eyes with his free hand and he murmured, “What’s up, J?”
The trial was the most talked about thing on all of the news channels and social media. Polls were being taken and conspiracy theories abounded.
“Give me three days and if you aren't sufficiently wooed then I'll put this to rest,” Tony said, hoping Steve would give him this leeway. He even stepped back but Steve swayed forward, like he wasn’t ready for him to go.
“Well I was about to climax but then Friday informed me you left the building even though I told you not to do so,” Tony grumbled.
Steve ran a hand over his back and Fury replied, “Yeah, you can have him.” To Steve, Fury said, “But, once the honeymoon phase is over. Come by SHIELD, you could still help your country.”
He was so busy looking at the people, he didn’t notice the soccer ball that had been kicked under foot and had conveniently rolled to a stop underneath him. Steve stepped on the ball and fell back. Like something out of a classical romance, he fell onto the bench right beside his mate, and when they looked at each other their timers went off with matching pairs of beeps.
“We’ll probably move out in another 20,” the older man gruffly stated and then went back to reading his book. He wasn't much of a talker, he was one of those guys who communicated through action over words.
Steve smirked and reached out to run his fingers through Peter’s hair. It made him unreasonably happy that Peter noticed how much Steve and Tony cared for each other.
Tony shook the Frenchman's hand and the rest of the Commandos visibly relaxed as they wordlessly accepted Tony into their tiny group.
The Soldier listened to the steady stream of names with a small smile. They meant nothing to him but the fact that Natasha was trying to –.
Peter made it safely to the ground and he crawled over to his quilt then asked, “Can I open it now?”
With Jim, Dum Dum, and Gabe preoccupied with Tony, the remaining Commandos scouted out the area to make sure it was safe. Howard carried the tesseract while walking beside Tony. He left his people behind, wanting to limit the knowledge of the time machine to as few people as possible.
At a lower volume, Jarvis replied, “Yes, Sir. I have been following your set protocols ever since you became incapacitated and I also have been acting on your assumed orders.”
Peter smiled brightly at his friend and slid the microscope Eddie had been looking at in front of him. He bent down and peered into the scope. He adjusted it for his eyesight and peered at the dark protoplasm. He murmured, “This actually looks good, what you going on about? A glob of failed theories? The molecules are stable! One of our hypothesis might actually be right!”
Tony started to follow the two in a sort of a daze, but Bucky turned around and stopped him with a hand to his shoulder. He walked him backward a few steps, making Tony stumble a little over his feet.
“The Midgardians were able to defeat the threat without your assistance. If they ever truly needed your support I would have summoned you. At the time, your strength was needed in Alfheim.”
“My pleasure,” Tony murmured. He scrambled to his feet and tore off his towel. Tony slid into the tub between Steve’s legs and placed his hands down on either side of his hips. Tony’s cock was swollen hard and he thrust it in the direction of Steve’s erection but only ghosted over the tub water. Tony exhaled heavily and his hot breath caressed his cock. Steve shuddered and inhaled a shaky breath.
As soon as she saw him eating, Aunt May busied herself with cleaning up the kitchen. His father also seemed satisfied and turned to his aunt and began to tell her his plans.
When he reached his door, he looked down the hall to make sure no one would notice his odd behavior and then he lightly knocked on it.
“The Captain’s identity is not trivial!” Coulson retorted, “His anonymity is all he has! Once it gets out Steve Rogers is still alive the world will clamor for answers and less reputable organizations will want to get a hold of him for the serum in his DNA! His identity is all that is keeping him marginally safe at the moment! Right now, the only pictures of him with Stark were made by amateurs with poor quality cameras but once the professional photos get out it’ll be all over!”
, Steve thought morbidly. How could he let this happen? He might have once fantasized about doing this with Bucky but he had not thought that way since Tony! He would have never let it get this far.
Peter’s heart felt like it was being wrenched out of his chest as he wondered at the older man’s survival.
Venom shrieked as he attacked the largest group of agents. The men and women scattered, shouting out warnings. Venom was able to grab ahold of one of the more junior agents. All the agents shot at the symbiote, including the one in Venom’s grasp. Venom threw the man an unsurvivable distance and jumped from the path of the majority of the bullets.
The serum had gifted Steve with fantastic abilities. He was stronger, faster, and healthier.  However, it didn’t just affect his physical abilities but his mental abilities as well. He found he was able compute things faster and remember nearly everything after the serum with amazing clarity.
Venom roared in fury and exploded in a giant mass around Steve. Everyone, Steve included, stared at the mass in shock. Seconds later, it shrunk onto Steve’s form and whatever form of control he had was lost.
“Note to self: Never piss off super soldiers,” Tony whispered to Steve, his usual sarcasm was laced with a little awe.
And there was that determined gaze again. He was serious. He was willing to die for her....just as Steve had been for Tony.
Peter’s life had changed drastically since the world found out he was Tony Stark’s son but, at that moment, Peter finally felt normal again.
James half yelled and half screamed as he ran down the hall to block out the noise. A team of six were positioned at the end with their guns pointing down the hall. Three were kneeling and three stood over them, all with their guns at the ready. They opened fire as soon as they saw him.
Steve jerked his face out of Tony’s touch, just enough so that no one else would see it, and hissed, “Don’t.”
Tony scoffed and said, “I think that fire cooked your brain…Babe, I hate to tell you this… you’re a mess…And you have no hair….or eyebrows.”
Wade’s lips trembled but he smiled widely and agreed, “Yes.” He gripped Peter’s hand tighter and leaned into his shoulder. Peter tilted his head up to accept a kiss and, as their lips met, his heart felt so full of love that it was overflowing into the rest of his body with its warmth.
What little dust was in the coffin had settled in a fine layer over the silks and shield. It would have stayed if not for the slight tremor that ran through the casket.
“Stark…Is this a secure line? Are you alone?” Fury demanded and looked behind Tony, looking to see if he was indeed alone or not.
Tony ended up taking the brunt of the impact as his much larger fiancé landed on top of him and a whoosh of air escaped his lungs violently.
“I’m not threatening you, dad,” Peter whispered starkly. “But the truth is harsh and I’m just stating the facts. I accepted you into my life despite everything you had done to me, my mom, and the Parkers…Now, I’m asking you to accept Wade, despite the things he may have done in his past too.”
Wade woke from his bad dream with a sharp hiss.  His arms automatically twitched to grab a weapon but, instead, tightened around a body.
Steve’s tears renewed with the words. He knew Tony had his secrets, but he couldn’t believe he carried such burdens for so long.
Steve froze and watched Bruce’s chest to keep an eye on his breathing. If it got any faster Steve knew they would have the Hulk to deal with in a matter of seconds. Anything could set him off. Steve prayed to God that the judge did not smash his gavel.
The look on Tony’s face made Peter’s throat swell shut and he realized he said the damning words aloud. He went to explain but as soon as he opened his mouth he knew he would only sputter and maybe even start crying. He thought he was better. It'd been months since she passed. When did he become so pathetic?
Tony was already imagining the worst. He could already picture Steve being tortured in his mind’s eye. It made him feel sick and he tightened his hold on Pepper.
This time things were vastly different. There was no hesitation. There was no nervousness or second guessing. It was just Tony and Steve. Even the fact that they were doing this to be captured didn’t register. Their hands moving where they wanted and their mouths trying to consume the others.
Tony was just waking up and had yet to rise from bed as he was checking updates on his phone. Steve had already eaten, gone on a run, and showered in the meantime and joined Tony on the bed with a good old fashioned newspaper. He leaned into Tony as he waited for him to finally begin the morning. They did this most mornings and Tony moaned about how terribly domestic and boring it was they but both secretly loved it.
