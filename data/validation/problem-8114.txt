And then he remembered--
"We were friends at school. I mean, I thought we were friends. We were roommates most of the time. I thought we were good friends. I-- I didn't have a lot of friends." Tony's mouth was twisted. "But we didn't-- we didn't get together until we were both 21. Long after we were out of school."
"Yes," Mr. Stark agrees. He still looks overwhelmed. "I see that." He pauses. "Isn't it a little soon?"
He thinks about deleting all the times Steve ever told him he loved him. He thinks about deleting warm nights in the mansion long ago, when they laughed and sat pressed together on the couch, watching TV or playing Monopoly, so long ago and so innocent and so very much in love.
fixing Iron Man. Because of the Avengers. Because of
"Won't work." Tony shook his head. "There'd be no way for me to confirm it. It has to be something that can be confirmed. But nothing
"April 13," Steve says, like it's obvious. "Friday," he adds, like he thinks that's what Tony's asking. He smiles a polite little smile, the helpful one he gives strangers, and if Tony's heart weren't already broken, it would be now.
Steve yawns.
Steve could feel his face heating up. They both knew he should have been better than this. "Um," he said. "Warbird, actually."
"Arthouse?" Steve asks.
"Um," Tony says, and he winces again. "I don't mean to lead you on, but I also wasn't kidding when I said I couldn't get it up." He grimaces. His face is still faintly flushed. "Unfortunately."
Every time he thought he was with Iron Man, he was with Tony Stark. And vice versa.
"No one ever does," Steve said, too blissed-out to be more than only a little bitter. "I know I don't look like the type. Captain America's supposed to be strong, manly, and silent. I know."
Then Tony sighed once more. "You ever have it happen, where the bullies know things about you that you don't even know?"
was the one who hadn't done anything that was gay, anything that would threaten his masculinity.
Steve was unfastening a belt pouch and fishing out a roll of something white that Tony couldn't quite see and-- oh. Gauze. That was gauze.
"Shh, no, Winghead," Tony murmurs. "It's all right. I know you didn't think I could do it. That was the point, actually," he says, and Steve was sure as hell not expecting to hear that. Tony's mouth quirks. "Ghost had to believe me. He had to believe that I was desperate enough to give him a real password. And that meant I had to sell it. And you -- I mean, you know you have a lousy poker face. Even if you'd left comms open and I could have told you the truth, I wouldn't have." Tony's mouth is quivering. It's clearly taking a lot out of him to say this, in the state he's in. "It had to look real. So that meant you had to believe me."
"It was all lies," Tony whispered. Steve could feel hot tears sliding down his bare arm. "It was only ever lies. I thought that even if he hated me now, he must have loved me once, but he never did. Every last word was a lie, and I-- I can't believe I-- oh, God."
Sighing, Tony put his gauntlets back on and set to work picking through broken furniture. There, that was one of Monica's uniforms wedged behind his stack of engineering journals. And over there, that had to be one of Steve's boots. It was still all so sad, but thinking about it like a puzzle -- what things belonged to which Avengers? -- made it maybe a little better. People could have some of their stuff back, if they figured this out.
"I forgave you!" Steve snapped back, in a tone that suggested the exact opposite.
The man harrumphed. "It doesn't bother you, a guy in a metal suit?"
Steve lifts his head and puts his hands behind his back, settling into a familiar parade rest as Tony turns and walks away. If Steve were an ordinary visitor, the next several minutes wouldn't be happening at all.
Hastily, he dropped Tony's hand, peeled off his gloves, tucked his gloves in his belt, and went to work on the IV. All the Avengers knew basic -- and slightly more than basic -- first-aid, and he'd done this a thousand times. Tony made a soft, bitten-off noise as Steve eased the needle out as cleanly as he could. Then Steve grabbed an adhesive bandage out of one of his belt pouches, without really looking at it. He stuck it over the puncture and gently smoothed it down. It probably wasn't all that necessary, since Tony was hardly bleeding, but fussing over Tony was somehow part of his muscle memory.
"Nothing's sure in this life, Cap," Tony says, and then, very carefully: "Why are you asking like that?"
Steve swallows hard as he knocks on the door to Tony's penthouse. He's in uniform, but he's still not used to this one, to the feel of his bare knuckles against polished wood, the sight of himself in navy and leather. The gloves are fingerless. He's wearing a weapons harness. Every time he looks at himself in the mirror, he hates the sight a little more.
Iron Man makes a quiet clicking noise, a catch in the back of his throat, and that's when Steve realizes he's been rubbing Iron Man's palm with his thumb, massaging it. He freezes. He hadn't asked first.
Iron Man sighs again. He looks away. "My father was... a stern man." He's spread his hands out on the table, his gaze fixed on the backs of his gauntlets. Steve suspects he knows what
"Yes, well," Steve says, a little tartly. "I've
There's a noise behind him. The covers are rustling again. The bed creaks. That would be Steve, sitting up. He hears Steve take one hoarse breath, then another.
He drapes a towel over Tony's ass, not because it's off-limits -- honestly, Steve will probably get there eventually -- but because the towels are warm and soft, and Tony will be more comfortable if Steve is covering the parts of him that he isn't currently working on. He won't get as cold, that way.
Tony's orgasm blindsides him. He hasn't come untouched in years, but that's exactly what he does as Steve pounds into him. The pleasure crests, breaks, and Tony is gasping, shuddering in Steve's arms. He thinks he might be saying Steve's name. He's dimly aware that he's making an incredible mess of himself; coming in spurts all over his stomach, up to his chest.
, Steve exults, as the shield slices through the air.
." The words came out of him with a little too much force, raw and angry. Maybe this was what pride felt like, if you were queer.
Gratifyingly, there was a little more color in Steve's face. "
hand.
One finger held up, Tony interrupted him. "No."
The next thing he registers is Tony's hands gently pulling him away from his cock. Tony rolls back in his chair to make room for Steve to stand, as he does up his fly. The light outside is brighter; the sun must be higher in the sky. Steve doesn't move.
Tony didn't. His life was scars atop scars.
"It's okay." Tony's gaze was unfocused. "Like you said, it was a long time ago."
Tony stops breathing.
dangerous.
Nodding, Tony looks like he's going to cry again. "Three years. God, Steve, you feel so good." He presses up against Steve, wrapping his arms around him like he wants to touch him with every square inch of skin. Steve thinks that sounds like a great idea.
He was, wasn't he? He had to be bluffing. All Steve could think of was the fear that had been in Tony's eyes, after Steve had walked in on him with Tiberius. Steve thought of the way Tony had stuttered through the question, asking Steve what he thought of
, though. Modern classics. Definitely not pulp sci-fi. Or Tolkien. Had you read Forster before, or was he one of your post-ice discoveries?"
Howard Stark's death? If Howard had been plaguing his life, surely he wouldn't have still wanted to kill himself after Howard's death? He ought to have been better off, then.
ask him. The world thinks it has the goddamn right to know. And because of that, Tony likes to keep things like this private, as private as he can. And he has, thus far. At least about this. The team doesn't know Tony's kinks. And Steve knows that Tony worries they'd think less of him if they did.
Both Tony and Iron Man took turns standing next to Matt Murdock, who assured the crowd of reporters that both Tony and Iron Man had cooperated fully with the police, had not been charged with any crime, and were completely innocent.
"I was staring at your ass," Tony blurted out, and oh, shit, maybe he did have a concussion because that was the thing he wasn't supposed to say, that was definitely one of the things he wasn't ever supposed to say--
Well, also he'd wanted it to be him.
No wonder Tony doesn't want to talk about it.
Steve still doesn't have a plan.
"Like I said," the guard repeated. "Scram. Get out of here."
Tony was shaking even harder. "I think-- I think I need to sit down again," he said. He sounded like he was going to be sick, talking about this. Steve didn't blame him.
. It's really you."
"I turned you down," Steve points out. Sadness flashes into Mr. Stark's eyes, and he bites his lip. Yeah, that clearly means something to him. "I turned you down and started dating your bodyguard. I see how that could really, uh, grind your gears."

Steve was already half-hoarse now, when he screamed again, and his ass was dark red, fading into purple; his body was already trying to heal the bruises. When Steve lifted his head there were tears streaking across his cheeks, dripping down onto the chains on his arms. Steve was
?" She sighed. "I'll go talk to him, Cap, okay? I'll let him know he can't treat you like--"
Tony had been drinking. That was what Tony was trying to tell him about the timeframe. It was when he'd started drinking again. And maybe also why. Maybe that was what Tony meant.
"I know it's not everything," Tony said, a little apologetically. "Not yet. But... maybe it's more than just good enough?"
Tony nodded. His smile now was small, a little embarrassed. "You, uh. You smell like you."
He knows that this part should be easier than the last -- or at least, it should definitely go more smoothly -- but right now it's more than a little frightening in its immensity. It's a big step, after all. Anyone with sense would be a bit scared no matter what, wouldn't they?
He was right.
"Steve," Tony rasped, and Steve's gaze snapped to his in an instant. "Steve. You have to know. I love you."
"Steve," Tony says, brokenly, and he realizes he might not know how to say no to this man, in the end.
Responsibility, Steve decided, could wait a few seconds longer. He ran his fingers through Tony's unruly hair, then leaned in, his intentions clear. Tony kissed him, eagerly. It was a proper kiss, a nice good-morning kind of kiss. Not passionate -- not the kind of passion that meant no one would be leaving the bed right now, at least. It was the way you'd kissed someone when you'd loved them for years and you just wanted to let them know you still did.
The next thing Steve was aware of was pain. Everything was still dark. His head was throbbing, and something felt very wrong with one of his legs and one of his arms. It was hard to think. He was draped uncomfortably over a surface that he was certain he wasn't supposed to be lying on. Was it night already?
Steve was beginning to see the shape of the idea now. "You mean, like a virtual version of the Combat Simulation Room?"
Only about half of the second floor was intact, and what was still there was a mess. All the interior walls were gone, and the contents of the remaining rooms were scattered across the entire level. The team had still kept a room open for Tony even though he lived in California these days, and that meant that Tony found one of his dress shirts two rooms away in what had once been Jan's room, stained in bright colors by smashed makeup and nail polish. And that was one of the luckier finds -- at least it was recognizably still a shirt.
"I'll tell you what," Iron Man says, like he's making a deal. "You were so good, you can have
"It's going to be okay." Steve's tone was low, even, calming, soothing, and Tony tried as hard as he could to stay focused on the sound. "It's going to be all right. Just stay with me. I know you can. You're the strongest of all of us, Avenger." His voice softened, unexpectedly tender. "You know that? You really are. I-- I think the world of you, Tony. And every day you amaze me. So I know you can do this. You just have to hold on. Please. Just hold on. For me."
There was still a smile on Tiberius' face. "You didn't think this was just a party, did you, Tony?" He was practically gloating, which Steve didn't think was especially nice. "Of course not. It's a product launch."
The sneer on Mordo's face appeared to be permanent. "I wouldn't expect someone like you to understand, Iron Man."
and I-- I-- I know we've both been so lonely lately, and I just-- I just thought maybe now was the right time--"
Steve turned away to put the pegs down, to make a space for Tony behind him. "It'll be our secret," he said, and he was glad Tony couldn't see his face.
Tony gave the box an experimental shake. It didn't sound like there was much more in there. A few smaller things, probably. One of them was wholly metal -- and not vibranium, to judge by the sound it made against the walls of the box. He supposed he'd find out soon.
She smiled. "Then let's get right to it. And I'd like to start with something more recent, if I may." She leaned forward. "The most current public discussion surrounding Iron Man obviously concerns his role in the hostage situation last night that ended with the tragic deaths of four SNN employees. You're undoubtedly familiar with the situation, Captain."
"Steve," Tony said, his voice gone thready, and he sounded like he was three words away from begging.
God, Steve doesn't deserve him. He knows that's Tony's usual line. But now it's his turn, isn't it? He hangs his head.
He leans against the doorframe, shoves his hands in his pockets, smiles. "Wake up, old man."
. It was strange, doubly so, because not only did Tony go to great pains to avoid talking about his childhood at all, he'd left Steve with the impression that he hadn't really had much in the way of actual friends from those days.
"I know," Stephen says, with familiar, quiet confidence. "I'll use a spell instead. It'll work."
"My toys are all in California," Tony said, apologetically. "So if you don't mind me using yours..."
they've been saying about him on the news lately--"
With his free hand, Steve gestured in the direction of his own waist. "I've got some medical supplies stashed away in my belt, and I can at least keep pressure on the wound until someone else shows up. It has to be better than just letting you bleed out in there."
"I wasn't lying about anything," Tony says, softly. "It was all true." He pauses. "Even my ring size."
He didn't believe in Tony, and Tony needs him, Tony needs him to be strong, but instead Steve isn't quite there. He's raw and guilty, and he knows he--
been, so."
Steve had smiled and kissed his cheek.
"I've ruined the mood, haven't I?" Tony mumbled against his neck.
Tony nodded thoughtfully. "Sounds nice." This must have been where he thought the end was, Steve realized.
Tony cleared his throat. He'd always had a good voice for telling a story, Steve had thought, rich and expressive. "
Steve reached up and ran his knuckles over Tony's cheekbone. He was here. Maybe that would help. "I know," Steve said again. "Like I said, I know it's not personal. I know it's not me you're afraid of. And if you don't want anything right now, I get that. But if you do, I'd really like to make you feel good. No obligations attached. Doesn't have to be my mouth, if you don't want. As far as I'm concerned, I'd be happy to just keep kissing you and you can keep, uh, doing exactly what you were doing."
So Steve skipped past the unnecessary defenses and denials. That wasn't what was called for. It wasn't about him. Not like that.
He doesn't know what he's expecting, and at first he doesn't even understand what's going on. He hears the faint tapping of metal against metal, then a heavier clunking sound, then a hiss of air, like a valve releasing. Metal scrapes again. He hopes something's not wrong with Iron Man.
," Steve said, helplessly.
It was clear that Tony needed all the reassurance he could get. Not just about Tiberius. He'd gone his whole life with nowhere near enough love in it. Steve knew he couldn't just fix Tony all by himself. But he could love him with his whole damn heart.
"There are a lot of hazards of the job," Tony says, after a pause. His voice has gone harsh, and his eyes are unfocused. He's looking through Steve, looking back to something that isn't here, something that already happened.
A curl of hair falls across Tony's forehead as he tips his face into Steve's shoulder. Steve doesn't have a hand free to push it back for him.
He used to tell himself that, before the serum, every time he struggled to his feet in the middle of a fight. Or, more likely, right after one.
Tony's hand had gone to his mouth. "Jesus, what is it
, but that's different." He shuts his eyes. He can't look at Tony and say this part. He's not that brave. "And I couldn't have said this before, obviously, but if-- if Iron Man hadn't existed, I would have said yes to you. Without hesitation. I-- I wanted you then. I still do."
He couldn't hold on any longer.
Wherever they'd landed, it was cold; Steve was only now noticing this because Tony had had to cut through his uniform at the shoulder, and Steve's flesh was prickling in goosebumps. It was probably shock, as close to it as he ever got these days. He didn't say anything about it, but Tony must have noticed, because he pulled the blanket from the first-aid supplies up over Steve while he worked on splinting his arm. Steve assumed the leg would come later.
gorgeous mess," he said, with hope in his voice, and even though Tony tried to tell himself Steve couldn't mean it the way Tony thought he did, his heart beat faster at the words.
Tony laughed softly. "Got it. Night, Steve."
"Like that," Tony breathes. "Just like that, please, yes, more."
"Thank you," Steve breathes, softly. He leans in and kisses Tony's cheek, tenderly. His eyes lower, and there's even more color in his face. "I-- I really needed that."
He didn't know if he could ever describe the difference in words. Maybe there weren't any words. But it was night and day. There was love in Tony's eyes, as plain as anything; his gaze was soft at the edges, warm, infinitely tender. Steve had never seen Tony looking at anyone the way he was looking at him now. He thought maybe he'd never seen
-- he has an even better thought. "Or maybe I'll pull out first." He thrusts harder, entranced by his own imagination, fueled by the sight of Tony. "I'll come on your face. Come on your chest. I'll mark you. It'll be messy. You'll look so good. Get it all over those ropes, all over you, and you won't be able to do a thing, will you, you'll just have to lie there, covered in it--"
Steve nodded. "Yeah. Yes. Please."
Tony's mouth trembles, but he's still smiling. "There are actually backups of everything he wanted, by the way. But they're on tape, offline, and very, very secure." His breath catches, but this time it might be a laugh. "I can't say I'm sorry he thought I was stupid enough to keep them online, though."
It feels like he's been waiting forever, and Tony must know that, because Tony doesn't tease him anymore. Tony doesn't make him beg for it. Tony just strokes him, just the way he likes it, his grip sure and confident, and it's not long before Steve can feel his release gathering and building in him. He thrusts up into Tony's fist, wanting more, and Tony gives him more, exactly the rhythm he wants.
Steve's still got his arm around Tony's waist as they step out of the elevator together. Tony's still fully armored, so he definitely can't feel it, but Steve knows he appreciates the gesture anyway. Tony's not leaning into him like he otherwise might have, like he sometimes does, but Steve knows now that means he's not doing better. Far from it. Tony's not leaning into him solely because he's still letting the armor hold him upright, and that means he still can't even walk unaided.
How can he possibly do this?
"Keep them closed."
Steve couldn't say it. Not anymore. Not now that he knew Tony didn't want him. It was too much.
! Oh, man. This is going to be so much fun." Tony had told him all about character classes over the years, too, and so Steve wasn't surprised when Tony said, "You're a paladin, aren't you?"
Translation: the rest of the team has it covered.
But Mr. Stark waves him away. There's another bandage on the back of his hand. "It's all right. It was an accident. Nothing to do with you." He smiles again, a strange, haunted half-smile. "Besides, Iron Man is more important than me, any day of the week."
There wasn't enough air. His vision was darkening. But he could still see when Steve got it, understanding and disbelief spreading across his face.
He clambered up Steve's body and unhooked the chain on his arms by feel, unwinding it as best he could, and Steve promptly put his arms down and drew him close. The cuffs slid over Tony's back. Eventually, Tony knew, they'd have to get Steve cleaned up, but right now he couldn't be bothered.
Tony was also somehow still flight-capable, because he leaped into the air, spiraled around to Radioactive Man's other side, hooked a hand into his clothes at the back of his neck, and dragged him into the air. One second, two, three -- and then they both vanished.
"Open your eyes." Tony's voice was all steel. "I know you can hear me, Ty."
The reporter in the field had ducked out of the way, and Tony and Radioactive Man were now facing off in the middle of what looked like a very crowded city street. Steve grimaced. That was a lot of civilians. But Tony knew that. Radioactive Man was holding Tiberius Stone by the throat, dangling him in midair. Not a great position to be in, at least for a baseline human. Tony was probably trying not to panic. God, what a mess.
That was when Tony seemed to remember that he had hands and that he could use them, and after that Steve didn't have as many thoughts that he was capable of putting into words. Tony's clever fingers teased at his nipple as he licked and sucked and, God, it was all so good. Steve had always felt a little embarrassed about his sensitivity there, after the serum; he'd never told any of his other lovers that he'd wanted that. But right now there didn't seem like there could be anything to be afraid of.
Tony dropped his hand, and while Steve missed the comfort of his touch, at the same time, he was glad it was over. Tony shouldn't be touching him, anyway. Tony had Tiberius. Whom he loved. Now he was just going to go right back to his cereal and--
He looked like he'd been crying recently.
"Teleportation," Steve said, the answer falling from his lips before he was even conscious of how he knew it. "Tony said he was testing a brand-new teleportation system in the armor last week."
Tony's hand is still in his hair. "But none of that is here, is it? No," he says, softly. "Here you're safe. Here you don't have to make those calls. Here you just have to do what I say. Just breathe. Just hold still and take my cock. Just like that."
Everyone would think it was one of Tony's little jokes, even if he said he was really with Steve, a joke like the pet names and the limp wrists and the campiness. No one else has actually asked Steve if they're together, though Steve bets most of SHIELD knows already.
Tony regards him in silence.
"Yeah, well," Tony retorted, "I'm not her. I'm me. And I think I've made it pretty clear that I know what I'm getting into, too."
"You have absolutely nothing to apologize for," Tony replied, as he set the multimeter for voltage. "I can flirt and work at the same time. It's one of my many talents."
"Hey, Steve?" Tony asks. "Not that I mind, but what's with the shirtless picnic?"
, Tony's mind whispers.
"I'm the one thanking you," Tony says, and his eyes slide shut as Steve gently starts to work at a spot just under Tony's shoulder blade, one of those places no one can really reach by themselves. "Oh. Mmm. Yeah, right there."
He'd tried. He'd tried not to think about Tony. He'd tried to distract himself. It hadn't worked. He'd thought it had, for the past couple days, but it was just that he hadn't seen Tony. All the feelings were still there. He'd forgotten, somehow, how much he felt for him. In Tony's absence, he'd convinced himself that his longing was less anguished, his pain less acute, his passion less sharp. And now he was here and Tony was here and it all just came roaring back.
and he's
"It's not?" Tony sounds honestly surprised. Like it really, truly, never occurred to him that Steve might like him like that. They've been friends, and they've been lovers, and there's somehow a vast area of their relationship that has remained unexplored. Or, at least, unsaid.
What can he do? What does he need to do?
Steve swallowed hard and licked his lips. His cheeks were even more flushed than they had been before, just under the edges of his cowl, and it looked like it was taking everything in him to get a sentence out. "I-- I know people joke about it. Everyone jokes about it.
." Steve's voice was an angry snarl. He felt a little guilty, because Freeman was one of their better liaisons -- unlike, say, Henry Gyrich. But if Freeman was going to try to force Tony off the team, Steve knew which side of this he was going to be on. It wasn't even a question. "He doesn't have roster approval.
Tony was smiling. "I see what you meant about the happy ending."
Did Tony really like this guy? Tony was rich, sure, but he wasn't showy about it. Not like this. He didn't flaunt it. He dressed up for company, but left to his own devices, Steve knew Tony would rather be wearing oil-stained jeans, safety goggles, and a faded t-shirt printed with a poem about quarks. Tony didn't taunt people with what he had. How could Tony be friends with someone who did?
But it doesn't look like the thought has occurred to Iron Man before. He stops, like he needs to recalibrate his expectations, and he tilts his head to the side. "You really mean that?"
Tony likes praise. And right now, Tony
"You've been in love with me for
Mouth trembling, Tony stares up at him. Steve puts the scissors to one side and reaches out with his other hand, drawing Tony close.
Behind the mask, Iron Man's eyes lower. "You're really something else, Winghead."
, and that thought nearly undid him. Tony moaned again, a little louder, and then he went boneless in Steve's arms, shuddering against him, giving up every scrap of control, utterly trusting, all walls down. Steve knew then that he could have done anything he wanted, anything at all, and Tony would have let him. The realization was heady and terrifying all at once. This, this was how Tony had gotten hurt so many times.
This won't even be his first orgasm of the night. When they'd been dressing for dinner, it had become apparent that Steve wasn't going to be able to make it out of the house without embarrassing himself, and Tony had grinned at Steve, adjusted Steve's tie for him, grabbed a handkerchief, and then unceremoniously stuck his hand down the front of Steve's pants. Steve hadn't lasted more than a minute. But, Steve being Steve, he has a few more rounds in him. After he comes one or two more times, he'll be able to last longer, long enough to satisfy Tony. By the time he rearranges the harness and gets Tony properly tied down to the bed, spreadeagled, him atop Tony, Tony inside him, he's going to be able to ride him for long enough to make it good for both of them.
Tony squinted. "I have?"
, Steve tells himself, firmly.
that's what he's doing," Steve corrected. "Because I saw him do it to you. And, hell, you've seen him trying to do it to me."
"What the hell is going on here?" Steve breathed. There was no response.
Ugh. Magic.
It was early evening now; the team had finished sorting as much of the second floor as they were going to be able to do, probably, and then they'd all gone their separate ways. Tony didn't know where anyone else was staying; he knew the team had rented temporary HQ space from the Fantastic Four, but he didn't know if that covered room and board. Steve had hightailed it out of there before Tony could ask him over for dinner, otherwise he would have.
"Yes," Tony says, wrong-footed. He feels like the boot jets have cut out and he's falling through the sky. "Yes, but it's not-- you're not-- I really do have to go call the doctor. Excuse me."
There were a series of heavy thuds from high above him, and then a cracking noise. He tilted his head back to watch glass fall out of the window above him, a window that was rapidly splintering in little spiderwebbing shards, and then a figure -- presumably the man Tony had been talking to -- fell through the window and landed hard on the floor next to him. He was wearing a bright yellow biohazard suit, complete with facemask. Dimly, Tony thought he ought to remember what that meant, but nothing was coming to him.
"Hey," Steve says, and Tony opens his eyes to see Steve's face, soft and gentle. "An accident means it's nobody's fault, right? Means you didn't want this to happen?" He pauses. "Doesn't sound to me like it could be your fault."
Steve sets a pace that Tony's never gotten from him before, driving into him, fast and heavy and hard. Knowing that this, right here, is just what Steve wants, exactly how Steve wants to get off, is doing incredible things for Tony. Every thrust leaves Tony breathless. Usually Tony's talking up a storm, urging him on, saying filthier and filthier things, but it's so good that Tony can't even begin to put words together. He's just along for the ride.
His throat working, Tony sipped his water, and then he leaned back on the counter and regarded him, as Steve filled a second glass for himself.
Of course Ty had been there for Tony. Of course he had. He'd arranged the entire situation, this entire week, to leave Tony miserable and off-balance. And then he'd stepped in. Tony's savior. Someone Tony could trust. And Tony had fallen for it. Because Tiberius had told him he loved him. Steve knew from enough nights sitting up with Tony after his breakups that Tony just wanted to be loved. Tiberius had given him that. And that meant that Tiberius could do whatever the hell he wanted to Tony as long as he told him he loved him while he did it.
Steve couldn't very well say he didn't want to. "Of course, Tiberius." He didn't offer his own name. "I'm sorry, but you'll still have to call me Captain America. Secret identity. You understand."
By nightfall of the second day, he wanted to scream in frustration and also in actual pain. It was times like these that he dearly wished ordinary painkillers did
Steve raised an inquisitive eyebrow.
God, how he wished it had been a date.
Steve doesn't understand a thing about what's going on. All he knows is that Iron Man's hurting, and he can't abide that.
Thanks to a bit of inspired tactical thinking, Steve had managed to take out most of the rest of the vampires as they were attacking SHIELD earlier tonight; he'd taken Perun's hammer and teleported the whole damn Triskelion, vampires and all, into the middle of Iran. Where it was daytime.
How could the best man Tony had ever known possibly think he wasn't
As Steve rocks to one side, pain pours through him. With every movement, it increases. He can hardly think. He grits his teeth. But he's half an inch clear of Ghost, and that's going to have to be enough.
"We can debate it more after you hit me again," Steve said, and he smiled at him once more, in satisfaction, when he picked up the second flogger, as if seeing Tony naked and holding a flogger had been some kind of life goal.
"Sounds good," Steve said, and gave him a courteous three seconds to get all his lights and repulsors back on before he sprang forward, turned, and charged the open warehouse doorway.
But it's good enough for right now.
"Yes, of course I still have it," he said, confused, uncomprehending. "And you're always welcome there," he added, both because it was true and because it sounded like the sort of thing Tony needed to hear right now.
There was no call to get greedy; Tony had definitely sounded willing to oblige him, and he was looking forward to that, but right now he wanted to make Tony feel good.
This changed everything. It changed absolutely everything, and at the same time Tony had no clue what to do about it. Not only was he looking for an Avenger who was kinky, he was looking for an Avenger
"Well," Steve said, thankful that Tony wasn't looking at his face, "I'm your friend, aren't I?"
As he took stock of the various exits, trying to figure out where he should go next, he realized that the suite was, in very subtle ways, nothing like what Tony would ever have designed. It was an eerie mismatch, just close enough to be noticeable, but it was throwing him off. His skin crawled.
-- finally understands where he's going, half a second before Tony illustratively taps his temple with his index finger. "You know the story, right? Problems in the ol' brainpan."
When it happened, it happened fast, but wasn't that always the way?
"I think that's a good sign of compatibility, actually," Steve said, smiling. He didn't think he was going to be able to talk about Tony -- or even think about Tony -- without feeling a ridiculous amount of fondness. He tried to drag his mind back to work. "Was there something you needed, Jan? I'll be done reading through these in a couple minutes."
Since they took off, Tony's been breathing faster. He's agitated. And Steve knows why.
Tony shook his head. "I've never been here before, either, remember? I recognize some of your things." He jerked his head over at Steve's haphazard collection of photographs, atop the dresser. "But I don't know what your apartment actually looks like, so that doesn't help. I could be inventing this place out of whole cloth. I can't prove I'm not. And even if I had been here, he could be pulling from my mind. He definitely set some of the dreams in places he'd never been that I knew. He has the capacity to learn everything I know. I wasn't kidding."
Tony was still staring at him, amazed, and Steve knew, knew without Tony needing to say it, that Tony felt exactly the same. He didn't need to say it. Steve could wait to hear it. He had all the time in the world. He already knew it was true.
"Sorry," Tony says, his eyes downcast. "I, uh. The armor's not really designed for this."
"I couldn't get you the whole day off, but the afternoon is ours." Tony was grinning. "Jan's going to let Pepper know I got caught up in Avengers business. And the way I see it, I
Everything was really going to be fine, this time.
But Tony was craning his neck, looking around the room like he was looking for someone in particular, and his smile faded rapidly.
"It's a very useful letter," Tony says carefully, and, yeah, that's Tony making sure he hears the message. "It's the actual name of the pound sign."
"There you go," Steve says, softly. His fingers linger on the armor an instant longer than they perhaps should have. "One Captain America, all yours."
"But that's not what it means when anyone else comes out," Tony continued. "People tell their family. Their friends. The people who know and love them know the truth. And that counts. We call it the same thing, even though it involves several billion fewer people. In the end, the important people know. They don't have to come out to the media, because the media doesn't care about them. So I'm not talking about coming out to the whole world. Someday, but not yet. But our friends, our teammates, the superhero community -- I think I could do that. I could do that for you. For us. I'd do that." Tony's voice grew stronger, more determined, his offer more precise. "We trust some people with our names, our identities. This is just... also our identities. More of our identities. And then you could have everything you wanted. At home, people would know. We could be who we are around the people who actually know who we are. The same people who would usually be allowed to know whoever you were dating. No hiding. No lying. Just like when anyone else comes out. We get what everyone else gets. And the whole world is still on the table for later."
This wasn't anything like the fantasies, actually. The fantasies -- these ones, anyway -- were lurid, pornographic, nothing but throaty moans and slick sounds, a warmth and pressure Steve could almost pretend wasn't his own hand. He hadn't imagined this. He hadn't imagined the sight of Tony's hand, running over the inner seam of his pants, a caress that was soft and reassuring at the same time as it made his blood heat. He hadn't imagined the way Tony's fingers lingered as he eased his belt undone. He hadn't imagined Tony's face in profile, staring down at him, smiling in joy and utter fascination. He hadn't imagined Tony
"Everything?"
Jan blinked. Steve wasn't sure if that was because he usually didn't swear. She reached out, put her hand on his forearm, and smiled a small, sad smile. "I know, Steve," she said, softly. "Believe me, I know. I keep telling myself that Tony's strong, that he's survived worse than this, that it's going to take more than a few bad news stories to bring him down." Her eyes were downcast. "But then they say something new and even more terrible, and I wonder when it's ever going to end."
Tony's love life was dragged under the magnifying glass. They talked about his history with Whitney Frost and speculated on his ties to the Maggia. A particularly nasty column suggested that Kathy Dare's allegations of abuse had been true and that she'd shot him in self-defense. A couple of the lowest gossip rags somehow ran with stories about illegitimate children. It was all lies.
But it was AIM, so Steve wasn't particularly worried as he picked his way forward, because what the hell was AIM going to do to them?
how well they worked together?
"Well," she said, sitting back, and Steve knew he'd won that round. "Thank you for that information, Captain." She regarded him. "And I supposed if I asked you for your thoughts about either Iron Man or Tony Stark's involvement in the death of Mark Scarlotti...?"
had a massive longstanding crush on his boss. Seemed a little impolite."
Steve heard himself make a small, quiet pained noise when the first of the bandages went around his wrist.
The words were easy, casual, and they carried with them an implication that Steve hadn't heard in-- God, it must have been decades. Steve wasn't one of
"Oh, shit," Tony said, from the cockpit. "They have missile lock."
," Steve rasped, his voice nearly hoarse with anger.
. "You're asking me to apologize to Mr. Stark for defamation. That's one of those big, important, ugly words, Captain. Lawyers tend to get involved. It's not pretty. So before I can think about taking that step, it'd be nice to know if there's even a case here. And the injured party wouldn't be
Walders rose from her seat to talk to one of the assistants, but Tiberius stayed where he was, still smiling that satisfied smile.
It's oddly reassuring. At least Steve's not the only awkward one in the room.
"Uh." Steve's face is hot. "No. That's not, um, an issue here."
Tony opens the bathroom door, leaves it open, and turns on the shower. It had taken them a few tries to get the temperature and humidity right so the glass door wouldn't fog up, but now Steve has an even more perfect view of Tony stepping into the shower, tipping his head back to let the water run over him. He soaps up, shampoos his hair, rinses. His hands run all over his body. One of his hands dips to his half-hard cock, and Steve's mouth goes dry as Tony gives himself a few leisurely strokes, like this just happens to be his everyday morning routine. He's not asking Steve to touch him. He's not even opening his eyes. Steve might as well not exist; he gets to see what Tony lets him see by Tony's grace alone, and he's already achingly hard.
If Tony knew what the inside of Steve's head looked like right now,
"You don't want this," Steve says. His face is burning now, and he has to look away. He can't. It's his own fault for wanting too much. For wanting more than Iron Man wants. "You don't want me like that. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. I just-- it felt good."
It doesn't matter who Iron Man is. It really doesn't, he tells himself. Iron Man is his teammate and they like each other and they're here enjoying each other's company. What more does Steve need to know? Steve himself has a secret identity, after all. No one knows who Captain America is, except the few people he's told -- and Iron Man happens to be on that very short list. It would be hypocritical to object to Iron Man also keeping a secret identity. If he wants to tell Steve, he'll tell him. It's not a problem.
really covers it," Iron Man says. "My God, Steve. You're so. So."
Tony reached over and patted Steve on the shoulder with one gauntleted hand. He wished he could hug him. He wished he could kiss him. Steve definitely didn't want that. "Hey, hey. You remember what I said to the team the other day? We're going to rebuild. It's going to be our home again. All of this?" He gestured at the smashed facade. "This is just stuff. We're all alive, and that's what's important."
"Oh!" Iron Man says. "Did you never see-- no, I suppose you wouldn't have. Uh. I'll have to show you the movie sometime, I guess. Not tonight, though."
." He gets it. And then he laughs. "Your blush is adorable, you know."
Tiberius opened his eyes. He glanced over at Tony. Then Steve. Then the shield. Then back at Steve.
Flag Smasher actually got in a hit, weaving past the shield; Steve staggered backwards, clearly not up to his usual standards. If he got taken down by
you in touch with Henry?" he asked.
The world is lonely and cold and closing in on him. He'll never be warm again. He can't feel his fingers. His face is going numb.
Steve takes it.
Tony's gaze was still fixed on Steve, so he didn't see what Steve saw: the small, triumphant smile that flashed across Tiberius' face for a split-second and then vanished.
, Tony had confided once, in the afterglow.
Hopefully he could make Tony more than just a little happy soon.
And then, as he grew to accept his place in the future, he started to appreciate the library in a different way, as a place with good memories. Good associations. Not all the Avengers liked to read for pleasure, but even the ones who didn't stored books here. Hank's biology texts. Jan's collection of fashion magazines. A well-thumbed shelf of Tony's engineering journals. Most of the other non-fiction -- the histories, the encyclopedia set -- didn't get a lot of use, and it was all old enough that Steve suspected Tony had inherited it.
"I can't," Tony breathed. His eyes were hot again. He was letting Captain America down. Hell of a way to die. He supposed he was always a disappointment. "I can't, I can't, I'm so sorry--"
There's a horrible scratching noise over the comms, a noise that stutters between mechanical static and harsh, human breaths, and Steve realizes the vocal filters in the armor are failing. And then Iron Man flips end-over-end, through the air, one hand splayed across his neck, repulsors flickering, and that's when Steve figures out that a whole lot of the armor's systems are failing.
Tony and Jan were both staring at him.
Steve tried to stretch, couldn't, and then shuddered pleasantly again. "Good," Steve agreed. "Harder?"
Steve was hot again. "Not-- not usually, no."
"Now I know what to get you for your birthday, is all," Tony said, and he was never going to get tired of the joy on Steve's face when he wanted to give him things, even if it was immediately followed by Steve's
They traded more kisses, then, for a few glorious minutes. Tony's mouth was lush and sweet. The only noise in the room was the soft, wet sounds of their lips, broken by the occasional sigh or pleasant hum. The other kisses had been desperate, passionate, intended to fan the flames of desire. For all that they were both quite obviously unfulfilled -- Tony's still-hard cock was pressed against Steve's hip -- the way Tony was kissing him now was slow, easy, unhurried, as if he were trying to calm Steve down.
"Okay," Steve says, still hoarse. Tony's made his choice.
-- that you won't love me anymore, but that's-- that's okay. That's what I deserve."
Tony's mouth twitched. He'd run out of energy even to smile. "'Kay. 'M just gonna," he mumbled, and he waved his hand in a direction that could equally have meant
The hand Steve holds out is the gloved one, and also his left hand. Tony grins.
Steve can't believe people nowadays would be so crass as to pry into Iron Man's intimate medical problems. "That's-- that's
He can't really think that about Iron Man, can he?
Did Tony think talking about Tiberius was the problem? It wasn't. The problem was believing him.
Tony's contributions to the discussion so far had included recounting his father's physical abuse, two heart attacks, his previous drinking binge, and impromptu heart surgery without anesthesia. Steve didn't think he wanted to hear the thing that Tony thought could top that.
"The password?" Ghost prompts again.
Steve had no idea what was going on here.
Tiberius still hadn't stirred. He was still breathing, but he didn't look any closer to coming around. And Steve knew Tony didn't want to talk about whatever had just happened to him in DreamVision, but at the same time, there were a few things Steve needed to know, and his need to know them was rapidly growing more and more urgent. He didn't particularly want Tiberius to be awake, but if the police were in fact coming, they'd been called because the guard had thought Steve might harm Tiberius. And if Steve was going to be sitting here next to Tiberius' unconscious body when the cops came, it definitely wasn't going to look good for him.
There are probably several good reasons not to get naked in the briefing room, but right now Tony can't call any of them to mind.
Awkward, Steve waits.
"Tony," Steve said, dreamily, and, yeah, this was going to be fun.
He was still holding Tony's wrist. Hastily, he let go, and after a second or two Tony lifted his arm off Steve's shoulder. Tony didn't move away, though, so they were still sitting next to each other, Tony's thigh pressed against his. That was okay, Steve thought. He could handle that. This was about how tight the passenger section of the Quinjet usually got with a full team and Tony in full armor. He could manage.
It's a picture of the two of them.
He paused on
"You're the only person I've ever told, you know?" he says, softly. "You're not the only person who knows, though. Happy figured it out on his own, bless him. He nearly gave it away the last time you saw him, but I don't think you noticed. That's it. Just you two." He pauses. "The only other person who knew-- he passed away."
Iron Man coughs. "That's sweet of you, Winghead. Even though I know it's nothing compared to you." He gives Steve's bare arms a significant glance.
He already knows everything he needs to know. He told Mr. Stark that the other day. It's the truth.
Only one way to find out.
Yeah, that was going to go over real well.
Steve's fingers are dextrous on the buckles, and soon enough he's loosened the bracer entirely, sliding it off his arm and setting it on the table next to him. A few more seconds and he's worked off the glove underneath, leaving his arm bare to the elbow. He turns his other arm over, ready to repeat the process on the other side, but Tony holds up his hand.
It wasn't as if he'd never seen Tony in various states of undress before, over the years. The Molecule Man mission came to mind. Hell, Tony had already been stripped down to his underwear once tonight. But it was different now. Everything was different now.
The noise Iron Man makes now sounds almost sad, and Steve has no idea why. Does Iron Man have something against baseball? He's never seemed particularly negative about it before.
There was joy and gratitude in Tony's eyes, as the kiss ended, and Steve wondered how many people Tony hadn't even gotten this much from, over the years.
Iron Man makes a small, wretched sound of distress.
"Okay," Tony said slowly, like he'd had to contemplate the word for a while. He sounded... exhausted, honestly.
. "I won't." He can practically hear his jaw grinding. "I'll see you later, Mr. Stark."
And with that, he walked away, pushing through the crowd, heading toward the stage.
Good lord, what must Tony think of him?
"I know you can't see my face, Cap," he says, quietly, haltingly, "but trust me when I say I'm blushing."
The praise coursed through him, to the bright, needy core of him. He thought it was the best thing anyone had ever told him. He liked this so very, very much. Tony's hand slid lovingly, slowly, over his face, over his open jaw, and that was when Steve, to his surprise, came again, against Tony's skin, over the sheets, shooting messily between them. He gasped, open-mouthed, losing the rhythm, Tony's cock slipping out of his mouth, as he clung to Tony, shaking.
Tony was different. Steve didn't know how many men Tony had been with before Tiberius, but it hadn't been a lot. Tony had said as much. And if Steve had never found out until now, there couldn't have been very many at all. Tony was good with secrets when he needed to be. It had taken Steve five whole years to learn he was Iron Man, after all. And Tony was very, very good with this particular secret. He didn't want anyone else to know.
And it's in Iron Man's colors. What's more, the fabric is clearly meant to represent the armor. His arms and legs are a garish yellow, nothing like the golden sheen of the actual armor, and his torso is fire-engine red. There's a circle on his chest that Steve supposes is meant to represent the unibeam housing, but it's slightly off-center from where the actual armor's housing is. Steve can tell this because Iron Man is definitely still wearing at least some of the armor. The unibeam housing is outlined on his chest, pushing the fabric outward.
"Hey, Cap," Tony murmured. "What's up? You look like you're having second thoughts." He paused. "You don't have to do this, you know. I bet Jarvis and Herc and Dane wouldn't mind a hospital visit. We can clean everything up without you."
Tony returns with the components of a three-piece suit, lays them all out on his bed, and proceeds to get dressed for the day. It's torture, almost -- like stripping, slowly, in reverse. Tony does up every button of his shirt without looking at Steve, buttoned all the way up, like it's a taunt:
Tony trusts him. And Tony trusts him with the truth.
Tony was at Steve's side. He was as handsome as always, immaculately dressed. He was smiling, because he always smiled for an audience, but this time it was a real smile. He was bright-eyed, animated. He was happy to be here, and Steve was glad to see it. He loved when Tony was happy. Maybe this evening wouldn't be that bad. After all, nothing could be all that bad if it made Tony this happy, could it?
joke about it, sometimes," he said, and Tony remembered the excuse he'd made when he'd taken the box. That had probably been torture for Steve, and not in the good way. "So you say these things but I don't know how serious you are about doing them. And if you couldn't do them, if you didn't really want to do them at all and were just being nice for me... it'd be a dealbreaker. I'm not the same as everyone else. I-- I
pick Iron Man. You didn't pick Tony Stark. You must have had a reason."
Tony was silent a little longer, listening.
Tony nudged his shoulder. "Steve?" he asked. "You're a little quiet there, buddy."
"Don't!" Mr. Stark practically shouts, a cry of distress. "Please. No doctors. Please."
It's a paradox -- or perhaps irony -- that a man as relentlessly, effusively tactile as Tony spends so much time in a suit of armor, touching nothing except metal. Steve knows where all the emergency release catches in the armor are, and he peels it away piece by piece, setting each plate gently on the floor, because he knows by now exactly how to arrange it all where Tony will be expecting it.
"I'm an engineer, remember?" Tony said. "Time to test your tolerances."
Tony's smile was faint. "Always wanting the best for me, huh? And always believing the best of me."
"Well, then," Tony said, gently sliding two fingers over Steve's opening, "here's a bit of the real Iron Man inside you first, just to get you ready, okay?"
Steve doesn't know Mr. Stark well at all, but it seems like Mr. Stark is trying hard. Like he wants to be friends, even after the last conversation they had. Steve can at least hear him out. Steve can at least be in the same room as him. It won't kill him.
Still staring, he nearly tripped over the pile of clothing in the middle of the floor.
tell you this?"
And then Tiberius' face darkened, and the last of his control slipped away. He turned his useless rage on Tony. "There was one thing I couldn't make you do, Tony. I couldn't make you
and, in a daring combination,
"I think straight men are allowed to like that book too," he said, to be fair to Tony. It hadn't been a bad thing to guess; it just happened to be wrong. "I just wouldn't know, myself, what straight men think. I'm not one of them." It was getting easier to say, now that he was saying it again. "I did mean it when I said it was worth reading. It's a good book. Artistic."
See? Tony still liked him. Of course Tony still liked him. Steve was being ridiculous.
this, actually." His mouth twists. "But back when I was drinking, when Stane was trying to ruin me, I suited up and fought Machine Man. I don't remember all of it very clearly." His eyes flutter shut. "I'd gotten the bright idea to hit him with a lamppost at one point. Except I didn't have the balance right and I was actually swinging it at the civilians around me. The bystanders. Machine Man had to save them. And I'm sure they all thought I didn't know what I was doing. They thought I was unaware. But I saw it coming. I could see all the angles in my mind, the way it would fall, the way it would sweep through the crowd behind me. I was just too wasted to do anything about it."
Tony was still smiling, and he looked like he never, ever wanted to stop. "I can make that happen."
But sometimes, even Steve wants a break. A moment of respite.
Tony's other hand went to Steve's back, rubbing calming circles over his shoulders. The noise he made was quiet, but it sounded somehow understanding. Like he knew. "It's okay. It's not a problem. I mean, I see what the problem is, but that's not a problem, okay?"
, oh God -- looks a little tired, a little confused, but his eyes are so kind, so wonderfully kind, and Tony swallows hard and he can't do this, he can't, he can't--
He smacked Steve's ass again, barehanded, and Steve sobbed again. "Tony. Please," he said, and he left it hanging, like he didn't know what he was asking for anymore. Maybe he didn't.
"He's in Central Park," Steve relayed.
Steve's optimism lasted about an hour and fifteen minutes.
"Like I said," Steve said, and thank God, his voice wasn't shaking, "it's a very nice book. You're more than welcome to borrow it if you want. I think you'd like it. I-- I really liked it, myself."
"Yeah." Steve's throat was dry. "I imagine that was why he didn't tell you."
. Of course Iron Man would find him a movie about a robot.
Instead he feels Steve's hand, big and warm, settle on his shoulder, the way he always does. He's a little tentative about it, like he doesn't know if this is presuming too much. Tony wants to tell him he doesn't deserve this.
"Oh, Tony," Steve breathed. "That's so good. So good."
The box, of course, did not reply.
. Of course he did. He must have discovered it in the future as well, given that it too had premiered in the fifties; Tony just hadn't known he'd seen that one in particular. He wondered if there were any Steve hadn't seen yet. He could watch them with him. Steve was always great company. In any context, really.
Over the years, the Avengers have evolved the concept of shift work -- Steve's pulled more nights on monitor duty than even he can count -- and they've definitely figured out how to be on-call, but the one thing they've never really developed is being off-duty. If that alert sounds, they go. No matter what they're doing, no matter where they are, no matter if they're seven hours into a night shift and haven't slept for the past twenty-four hours -- they go. It's the nature of the job. It's never someone else's problem. Steve doesn't resent that. He can't.
He ought to step back. He ought not to be this close to Tony -- physically or emotionally. But Tony needed him. And this was what Tony needed right now, so Steve and his unrequited love would just have to deal with it.
But Mr. Stark doesn't say anything like that. He just smiles a very small smile and regards Steve attentively. He's waiting to see what Steve will do, Steve realizes.
It was just like Tony, Steve thought, fondly, as he watched him slip through the crowd. It was just like Tony to see some new technology and immediately think of how it could be used to do good in the world. That was who Tony was. That was one of the many reasons Steve loved him.
Steve amends his answer. "Don't worry about me, Tony." That is, at least, the truth. "I'm here for you."
"You know," Jan said, thoughtfully, from the library's doorway, "based on previous experience, I was pretty sure Tony was going to be the sappiest one in your relationship, but I think I'm wrong. You two are adorable, by the way."
"Not as far as I know," Tony had to admit, and the light in Steve's eyes dimmed just a little. "Not recently, anyway. But he's-- he's looking into getting help for Hank. The best doctors. He told me he talked to Don Blake a few days back, and Don said he thought Hank had a good chance of getting better, with the right treatment. Mr. Stark says he'll pay for the doctors, of course. Nothing but the best for the Avengers, right?" He couldn't help but smile, even though Steve couldn't see it. "And he said he was going to offer him a job at Stark International, when he's ready to get back on his feet." Tony shrugged -- or tried to. It was always difficult in armor. "I mean, who knows if Hank will take it, but I know if he can find him Mr. Stark is at least prepared to make the offer."
Steve was still crouching at his side, and now, in a reversal of irony, Tony was the one distracting him. He hadn't seen Flag Smasher starting to move, returning to consciousness, rising up behind him.
Oh, God. He was going to have to tell Steve. He had to. He really had to now.
The pile of light-up animals behind Tony disintegrated.
When Iron Man speaks, his filtered, staticky voice is high with surprise. "
Hollow-eyed, Tony stared at him, and Steve realized that had been entirely the wrong thing to say.
Tony wrapped his hand around the base of Steve's cock, joining his other hand, anchoring it there without losing the rhythm, and that was nice, but still not-- not quite enough.
"--the hottest thing I have heard in my entire life," Tony said. He was smiling even more broadly. "Talk about flattering. That's amazing. Look at you," he said, still smiling. "You're gorgeous."
Steve waved vaguely behind himself. "I'll just--" he said, and he ducked into the hallway.
For a few seconds Iron Man is quiet, and then he makes a soft, wet noise. When Steve looks over, the eyes behind the mask are suspiciously luminous. Is Iron Man
," Tony echoes, in disbelief, and he leans in--
If pressed, Tony could have come up with multiple extremely plausible reasons for why he was standing outside Steve's door. They weren't even all entirely lies.
, and holy shit, was Steve ever good at kissing him.
"You're the genius," Steve murmured. "I defer to you."
Tony's smile was wobbly and tremulous, but it was there.
are people framing the question as a hypothetical, talking about books or movies where it happens, asking each other if they would ever do it. That's all well and good for them, Steve supposes, but it doesn't answer the more pressing question of what Steve should do if he has a Saturday night free and a fella in a metal suit he'd like to get to know better. It's nowhere near hypothetical for him.
was where Tony was.
That's a yes. Oh, God. Iron Man
"But," Steve says, his voice halting. He doesn't know what to say. He doesn't want to believe this. He doesn't think he even knows how to accept this. "You don't
Tony braced himself on his elbow, shifted his weight, and then promptly discovered how the hospital had known he was left-handed.
Then he heads next door, to his own room, and sheds his armor. Even as the models change, it's still a familiar ritual. This one, gleaming black and gold, even folds down into a backpack, almost like the old suitcase ones. His pulse pounds in his head. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.
"All right, then," Tony said. "Marry me, why don't you?"
"What-- how--?" Tony was still smiling, and he hadn't gotten back to complete sentences yet. His eyes were shining, as if for once he might cry from pure joy. "How-- how long?"
"That was
Clint poked his head out of the other Quinjet, and he was already snickering. "You stay right there. I gotta get a picture of this."
... it's heritable. I don't want to pass that on, the way I feel. I wouldn't wish this on anyone. I don't want to have a child knowing that they could feel like this because of me, because I was selfish enough to want them to exist."
Tony's face colored and he looked away, like he hated to hear it. Even though they both knew damn well that it was exactly what he needed to hear. He was shaking his head in disbelief. "How do you just...?" he began to ask, and then stopped, and then started over. "It sounds so true when you say it."
," Steve repeated, because all he had left was the strength of his convictions, and he knew he'd already lost.
The elevator beeps softly. Thirty-second floor. Ghost is one floor up, but they're getting out here and taking the emergency stairwell up. Steve checked the floor plans while they were waiting for the elevator. It'll be easier to get the drop on Ghost this way. Not guaranteed, by any means, but a chance is better than nothing; the stairwell is on the other side of the floor, but the elevator would have let them off right next to Ghost -- or, at least to where Ghost has blacked the cameras out. Ghost would see them for sure. So this is slower, but safer.
"I sure am." Iron Man says. He sounds proud. "Hey, since you did such a good job, I have a present for you. Would you like a present?"
Steve swallowed hard. "And I'm upset
Tony nudges Steve's hand onto the metal cuff, and he turns his arm over until Steve sees a nearly invisible switch on the inside edge of the cuff.
Tony smiled back, even if Steve couldn't see him, and turned to clomp his way up the broken escalator.
Okay, that
"And I'm staying here," Steve promises. He puts his hand on Tony's back, his fingers fitting into the gaps between the plates that layer their way down Tony's spine. "Come on, Shellhead. I've got you."
Jesus Christ.
But Carol rallied and hit back, a flurry of blows. Blocking took a lot out of him, especially at Carol's power level -- all his muscle memory was telling him to block with the shield he wasn't carrying. At least he was getting in the unarmed practice.
Okay, so he's not exactly noble, but touch is a two-way street -- if no one's touched Iron Man, then Iron Man hasn't touched anyone either.
"I hope so," Steve says.
. "I am very, very good with that. Now are you going to come back here? Please? I miss touching you."
Steve took another breath and tried to steady himself. "Okay. So the main character, obviously, is a fella by the name of Maurice." He said the name right. "And he's gay. He doesn't know that at first, but we see him growing up, and he's not interested in girls at all. Just guys. Not that he realizes it at the beginning. He's... well, I thought he was upper-class, when I read it the first time, but he ends up having to work for a living, so you probably wouldn't call him rich. I didn't know the difference." His face was a little hot again. He remembered the awful scorn on Tiberius' face.
Tony wasn't straight.
Some of the nervous anticipation is actual nerves, of course, because Mr. Stark's workshop is not exactly neutral territory, and Steve has no idea why Iron Man picked it.
Something had gone wrong.
Steve sees blood dripping on the other side of the eye-slits, sliding down past the inside corner of one of Iron Man's eyes, like macabre tears; Iron Man's eyes are closed as he wheezes, gasping for air. How can Iron Man's identity matter more than his life?
"He said it when I was with him, too."
"This is because of Tony," she said, softly, almost to herself, and then a little louder: "And last week, when you were so upset about that thing you couldn't tell me about... was that because of Tony, too?"
It could have been a seduction, a line straight out of a handbook, something he'd said to a dozen people. But the way he said it made it clear that it very much wasn't a line. His eyes shone with longing. He'd dreamed of this for years. Just like Steve had.
It was just the four of them all gathered in the briefing room -- him, Steve, Thor, and Tigra. It was quite possibly the smallest team Tony had been on since they'd founded the Avengers. Smaller, actually. Still, they'd been fine with five people then, and they'd been fine with four before they'd found Steve, and they were going to be fine with four now -- and these days, they had the reserves to draw on if they needed them. It was going to be all right.
And, okay, maybe Steve was a little hurt. Maybe more than a little. He'd known Tony for a whole damn decade. They were friends. And it stung to find out that there was this whole side of Tony that Steve hadn't been allowed to know about, that Tony had a friend he'd never talked about before, a friend he'd apparently had for longer than he'd known Steve.
The reporter onscreen was looking around in confusion, but Steve had access to more information than she did. He grabbed his laptop again, typing in the commands as fast as he could. Every Avenger's location could be tracked via their identicard, but because Tony was Tony, Steve had a hell of a lot more data on him. Tony's suit telemetry was extensive. In addition to location, Steve could access the suit's medical monitoring as well as a systems log. The log gave him real-time data on shots fired -- currently just the repulsor blasts from two minutes ago -- and, apparently, Tony's teleporter usage.
Tony shook his head. "That would have been less cruel, actually." He sighed. "She'd been hired by Stane. For the express purpose of hurting me. Her job was to put me off balance, so I couldn't counter the takeover. If it hadn't been the sobriety, it would have been something else. But that was what she picked." Tony swallowed hard. "She broke up with me. She said some incredibly hurtful things. Preyed on every single insecurity she could find. Told me how stupid I was to think she could ever have loved me." His mouth twisted. "And then she walked out. And she made sure there was a bottle of wine in the room with me after she'd gone. That was all it took."
This will be over soon, he tells himself. He just has to get through this.
means to Steve. He thinks maybe he should have asked for clarification.
It's actually important to know what Ghost is after. Also, Ghost seems like the kind of fella who can blather on about his principles for enough time to let Steve come up with a plan of attack.
him. Not like this. He never thought he'd have this.
-- he'd been imagining something that was, well... seductive. Something that wouldn't be out of place in one of those many photoshoots the internet had been all too eager to show him: Tony lounging on a beach, wearing an artfully-rumpled suit, the top two buttons undone as he gazed soulfully at the camera. But those were all from before Iron Man, and -- as Steve is beginning to understand -- none of them were the real Tony Stark, either.
Carol was frowning, upset lines engraved on her face. Her domino mask wrinkled where her brow had furrowed. "And he
Steve hadn't actually read that book. He'd missed it in the ice.
"Come on," Tony said, hooking a finger into Steve's shirt and wishing, for more than the sake of mere convenience, that Steve had come with a collar and leash. "Let's go play with every toy in the box."
Steve knew, then, what he had to say.
Steve's face is hot anyway, somehow, even though it feels like most of the blood in his body is a lot lower. "Um," Steve says. "I, uh. Yeah."
"Glad you could make it," Iron Man calls back, without turning around. "Go on, have a seat on the couch. Make yourself at home. I'll be there in a second." He coughs. "Unless you were hoping for someone else?"
Tony rolled his hips, pressing himself up against Steve's body, gasping out another sound of incoherent pleasure, and Steve realized Tony was grinding against him, rubbing up against his stomach, just going for it. It was one of the most arousing things he'd ever seen in his entire life.
, he wants to say, except Tony isn't in a great frame of mind to hear him say anything negative.
And Tony was smiling at something, maybe something he was reading. It was a real smile. The curve of his lips was mesmerizing. He was
A minute or two later, the bed creaked with Tony's weight. "You can turn back around now," Tony said. The words were clipped, snapped out. He sounded-- God, he
Iron Man is silent for a while, and then he sighs. "I've never told anyone this." He pauses and amends himself. "Other than Mr. Stark, I suppose." He coughs and glances briefly away. "I-- I do have to wear the armor. But it's only the chestplate." He taps his chest with two fingers, and finally Steve hears metal. "A few years ago, I-- I-- I was in an accident, you might say. Shrapnel to the chest. The short version of the story is that I ended up with... a lot of damage. Permanent damage. The chestplate is what keeps my heart beating. That's what I meant when I said I had a heart condition. And that's why I can't remove the chestplate."
"Wow," Steve breathed. "Hey, if you see Tony again before I do, will you thank him for me? Sometimes I think we should be paying
The door in front of them is labeled 33. It's showtime.
Tony cleared his throat. "It's A positive. For future reference."
Steve bit his lip. It wasn't fair. It wasn't. But it also wasn't going to happen, and he needed to accept that. And one of these days, he needed to move on.
Steve generally considered himself a good judge of character. He'd never been sure whether the serum had given him some kind of edge there, letting him perceive things that other people couldn't, or if he was just naturally good at it -- but, nonetheless, he thought he did a better-than-average job. It came in handy in his line of work; he'd hardly ever been wrong about who had the temperament to be an Avenger. He and Jan were co-chairing the team these days, and she liked to run the personnel decisions by him for exactly that reason. He had good instincts, she said.
If anyone did ask, Steve would tell them yes.
Steve has no idea who or what that is, but Iron Man likes it, and he wants to know everything Iron Man likes. "Sure," he says, grinning. "Why not?"
As if he's enjoying his own private joke, Mr. Stark huffs out the smallest of laughs, a voiceless exhalation, and he smiles a strange, sad smile. "No, you wouldn't understand," he murmurs. "I didn't really think you would. But I had to try."
"Captain America wants
"Penny for your thoughts?" Steve asked, cheerfully, aware that Tony could definitely see him starting to blush.
Steve pinged the armor too, just in case; if Tony had suited up, he ought to have been getting data from it. And there was nothing. Tony wasn't in the armor. Cold sweat beaded on the back of Steve's neck. His heart was pounding.
Tony said nothing, and Steve pushed past him and out the door. He was leaving Tony to his fate.
There's an unexpected ripple of grief across Steve's face; his fists finally unclench. "Truman," he says, and the name sounds hollow. "President Roosevelt passed away yesterday."
Steve looked up. "I know I've said this wrong before," he began. "I know I have. And I'm sorry. I'm-- I'm trying as hard as I can to get it right. I'm sorry that you have to go through any of this." He swallowed hard. "You're right when you say I have no idea how much you want to drink. I've never felt like that. I don't know. I can't know. But I know what it feels like to want to do something and know you shouldn't."
Steve didn't know what to say. He was almost glad this was a recording. He didn't have to come up with a reply. God, no wonder Tony was a mess.
Tony hung up and put his phone away. He was staring into space, eyes unfocused, still half-smiling.
actually do it," Steve pointed out. "He just knocked you out first so you couldn't stop him. I don't think that's better. I think that's a whole lot worse."
"I want a drink," Tony said, his voice shot through with the deepest misery. He hung his head. "God, Steve, you have no idea how much I want a drink right now. I'm-- I'm so scared I'll do it. I should be better. I should be better than my addictions. I shouldn't want this. But I do. I want it so much. I know it's wrong. I know
Ominously, Tony was silent. Steve could feel Tony's breath catch in his chest. Tony's whole body went rigid under Steve's hands. That was a no, then. Tony didn't want that at all. Steve's heart sank. Steve had said something wrong again, and he had no idea what. Was Tony the one man on Earth who didn't like blowjobs?
And Steve actually
Some horrible part of Steve wanted to laugh, even though nothing was funny, because this was the same damn problem Tony had always had, once again. It wasn't as if Tony had never dated people who'd tried to kill him, after all. It was just that all the other people had known it was Tony they were trying to kill. And of course Tiberius hadn't been trying to kill
Well, at least he's definitely still breathing now. In Steve's ears, Tony is almost gasping, ragged and hoarse.
Tiberius squinted dubiously. Steve didn't blame him for finding that a little hard to swallow. Most friends didn't just turn up unannounced at other friends' houses, letting themselves in to invite their friend out for a meal, after all. But that was just how he and Tony were.
"Probably mostly healed anyway."
vampire, one that was still hiding in the shadows. He was distracted. He got bit.
"Yeah, okay," Steve said. He shook out his hands and clenched them a few times, experimentally.
Eddie nods again. He's not crying as hard anymore. Iron Man is distracting him surprisingly well.
Iron Man regards him in silence for a long moment, and then holds out his hand, palm up.
So if instead it feels like he ought to have an instruction manual and a set of socket wrenches, that's fine. Better than fine. This is the real Tony. This is Steve's beloved Shellhead, coming out of the shell. And this is for him alone, for the two of them, not for anyone who buys a magazine.
. Steve couldn't think of a time he'd ever seen Tony overreact to anything, and he trusted Tony's judgment every day on a professional level.
Tiberius' building wasn't all that far, luckily; he'd established ViaStone's headquarters in the Stone building, which was near Times Square, because of course he'd wanted something obvious. It was a straight shot down Fifth Avenue almost the whole way -- a one-way street in Steve's favor -- following the edge of Central Park all the way down before he had to turn, and this late at night Steve could make it there in ten minutes, easy, if traffic obliged him. Closer to five, which was faster than he could run there, if he ignored every posted speed limit as well as every single traffic law in existence.
Tony leaned over and kissed his ear; a delightful shiver slid down Steve's spine and he said several things that weren't words, and then Tony's name. He was dimly aware that he was calling him perfect again. He didn't seem to be in control of his mouth. That was fine. Tony
"Yeah," Steve said again, even more hoarsely. "Yeah, it's-- it's because of Tony." He licked his lips and tried to swallow. "We had, um. We had a disagreement about the appropriate level of involvement for me in, um. In Tony's current... difficulties."
"Iron Man's not good enough for you."
This was definitely not a thing Tony needed to be thinking about right now.
"It's all or nothing," Stephen says.
Steve takes a step forward -- and Tony clicks his tongue, a sharp reprimand.
Tony's hands were surprisingly warm, a little callused; he understood what Tony had meant now when he'd said he would know him with his eyes shut. This was Tony's touch, strong and gentle at the same time. This was Tony caressing him. It couldn't have been anyone else.
Steve's eyes snap open.
"Oh," Tony said. He sounded stunned. "You really think so?"
Steve is beaming at him now. "That'd be swell, thanks!" He looks down at his plate. "Can I get you anything while I'm up?"
Steve didn't understand.
Apparently Tiberius didn't even need to come up with his own excuses anymore. Tony could make them for him just fine. So when Tiberius kept hurting him, Tony was going to keep making excuses. Maybe then he'd start hitting him. Tony would probably find a way to justify that too.
He waited for Steve to flick the shield on again but instead Steve unholstered a gun.
Oh, it wasn't that Tony didn't have a toybox of his own -- in fact, he had quite a collection, as almost every sub he'd played with could attest to -- but it was all in California right now. None of it was here. He'd swear that on his armor.
Still in the doorway, Jan cleared her throat. "I'll just go," she said, with exaggerated care. She was grinning. "I'm shutting the door now. Have a good evening, you two."
No, Steve tells himself, and he straightens up. He can't think like that. It's not wrong and it's not going to be wrong and he needs to stand by his beliefs. He can be brave for this. It's important.
expression on Thor. "I have not seen him with a steed of late, but mayhap it is his."
"Shh," Tony said. He was still stroking Steve's hand. "It's okay. Take your time."
Great. Steve stares helplessly. He's never been very good with kids. He clears his throat. "Are you hurt?" he asks. The boy doesn't look injured, but it's hard to tell. Maybe he's just frightened. Why is he crying so much?
"Oh," Steve said, stupidly.
He knew most people would wait. That they would consider it much, much too soon to get involved with someone hours after they'd left their abuser. But at the same time the thought of waiting any longer was intolerable. Tony was here, now, and Tony wanted him, and it had been an entire damn decade of waiting already. And surely Tony would know if he were ready or not.
Steve can't help but bring one hand to his own mouth to touch his kiss-bruised lips, and he's gratified to watch Iron Man track the movement.
Steve was swaying on his feet. "So you saw... everything?"
The thing is, now he can be better than his mistakes.
. That reaction doesn't belong here. This isn't how he's supposed to feel.
Sometimes he wished he had less of a sense of responsibility. He sighed.
The worried lines of Tony's brow began to relax a little, and there was more color in his face. Steve held out his hand for inspection, because Tony would feel better, Steve was sure, if he could see it for himself.
Tony pulled his head back to stare at him. "Steve, it was over a decade ago, everyone thinks it was an accident, and--" He stopped and squinted, and then horrified realization spread over his face. "Shit. How many people do
"That's better, isn't it?" Tiberius said, with satisfaction. "The Phantom Menace. You can be Obi-Wan Kenobi! You can defeat Darth Maul! And, hey, maybe this time you can even save your master. Or, if you like old-school television, and who doesn't, am I right--"
can be the one to explain to the ambassador from Transia that we can't come save them from Annihilus right now because he's busy blackmailing us." Steve could feel his mouth twist. "I'm sure the resulting geopolitical disaster will go over very well with his superiors."
The message ended.
Steve can't help but stare at his own lap now. He's getting hard again just from Iron Man
"You know," Steve said, as gently as possible, "it's okay to tell me you're happy when you're happy. In my book, that's a good thing."
disapproval. "Isn't it a crying shame that you don't have a spreader bar?"
If the question came as a surprise to him, it's even more of a surprise to Iron Man.
The attack had left Carol open, and Steve took advantage of it: he stepped in close and threw an uppercut. Hard. To Carol's face.
Tony pressed on. "He told me how his people got the footage, too. He said it came from one of Donahue's security cameras. That doesn't sound like a setup to me. Sure, maybe I thought it was at first, but I was wrong. I made a mistake."
Some of the wires coming out of the box were attached to electrodes, which both Tony and Tiberius were wearing. They both had electrodes stuck all over their faces. Tony had a few more of them on his scalp, buried in his curling hair. Tiberius had those too as well as some on his chest and legs, probably monitoring his heart; Steve glanced over again at Tony's scarred chest with its strange metal implant and decided that Tiberius had probably seen that and given up on the monitoring.
Steve glared at him, but his mouth quivered like he was trying not to smile.
--didn't even know where he was. Shit. Without the armor response, he couldn't put out a tracking beacon.
Tony holds up his hands, palms out: a sign of surrender he's long since trained himself out of using, but the only one Steve will recognize. "Hey, hey, Steve. Take it easy, okay?"
He thought it would be good. He thought everything would be fine. There's no way that Mr. Stark's going to be kindly disposed to a man who has just scared him half to death, literally.
!" Tony shot back, hotly, his voice rising to meet Steve's. "You were wrong then, and you're wrong now!" He drew a ragged, noisy breath, seeming to rein himself in. When he spoke again, he was calmer. But not by much. "For God's sake, Steve, Ty is one of the few people who has made this entire hellish week at all bearable!"
"If you're still this coherent, I need to do better," Tony said, smearing Vaseline over the plug. "Come on. Take it for me. Then I can get the rest of your toys here and really go to town. I'll make it hurt so good."
"I'm going to fix this," Steve promised. "I'm going to get you out of this, Tony, I swear. Just hang on, all right? You're going to be okay."
"Here," Steve said, and he turned and pitched the ball of clothing in Tony's direction. It landed on the bed next to Tony. "You'll be a lot more comfortable if you're not trying to sleep in a suit."
"Oh?" Steve could feel his mouth twitch. At least he wasn't blushing again. "Those kinds of plans, huh? I see how it is."
A look that Steve couldn't quite read passed through Tony's eyes, surprise and a hint of something that might have been shame. "I told you," Tony said. "You've seen it all already. Might as well just take the shirt off."
God, of all the random late-night visitors. That explained why they'd let him up here; of course Captain America was on Tony's approved list. But what could Steve want with him right now? It wasn't like they didn't hang out when neither of them were busy, or at least they used to -- and it was good, wasn't it, that Steve still wanted to be near him after everything, after the drinking? -- but Steve invariably called first to make sure he wasn't interrupting anything.
It feels almost like a betrayal even to think it. He shouldn't want to, because obviously Iron Man doesn't want anyone to know who he is, and a good man, a just man, should feel the same way as Iron Man does. He should want what Iron Man wants. It's disrespectful not to.
Tony saved him. Tony, who's spent the evening obviously feeling like dirt and to all appearances has been unable to function, saved his life. Tony foiled Ghost's plan, knocked him out, and saved Steve's life.
, all right -- he read the papers as much as the next guy. But he hadn't heard of
He managed one last breath. He shaped the words in his mind. He forced them out through numb lips. "Kiss me?"
"Nope," Steve said, as cheerfully as he could. "The gay porn DVDs are in a box under the bed. You're welcome to borrow them if you want. I definitely keep them around for their artistic value."
Steve knew exactly what Tiberius was doing, and he was going to try his damndest not to let him get away with it.
is expecting, and if Tony actually wants more Steve would be happy to help. But he's also happy to not help. It's a conundrum.
Those are not words that come out of Steve's mouth.
He needed to stop feeling sorry for himself. Christ. He was going to heal up in inside of a week instead of in a couple of months like anybody else would, and here he was complaining about it because it hurt a little.
There was an expression on Steve's face that Tony couldn't quite parse. "You don't miss it?"
, he tells himself. If he can get through this, maybe it means the hard part will be easier than he thinks it is. He just wishes he knew for certain what Iron Man will say -- but, well, there's only one way to find that out.
Steve lets his gaze rise higher. Tony is staring back at him, eyes wide and dark, lips parted. Vulnerable. The wrong word could break him.
"Ouch." Wincing, Tony considered the glass in his hand. "Harsh," he said. "But fair."
didn't mean
"Jealous?" Mr. Stark echoes, like he can't even imagine where Steve came up with that one.
"Just wondering," Tony began.
Then he remembered the Sentient Armor.
That would have been the only way Tony might have accepted that he was getting hurt. He sure wasn't going to accept this.
He feels selfish even thinking the complaint. It's not like he's the guy in the room who has brain cancer. He's just temporarily dead. Undead. Whatever.
But Ghost is perfectly visible now, so Steve still has a chance.
Mr. Stark's smile is crooked. "You wouldn't say that if you knew everything about him, Captain."
"That's me," Steve said. "Full of surprises."
Tony sure sounded like he meant it. He already knew who Steve was, and he was still here. It was the exact same thing Steve had been saying to him all night, and now Tony was saying it back.
"And now I know," Steve agreed. He glanced away, down the length of Tony's armored body.
But Steve was still shaking his head. "It's not that," he said. "I just-- this place was our
. And, yes, I know how that sounds, believe me, but it wasn't me calling the shots. But I had to watch my own hands choke the life out of him. He died in my arms. It was all my fault, Steve. It was awful."
A brilliant idea occurred to him. "Tony, do you want me to play Dungeons & Dragons with you?"
"Here," Tony says. "You can help if you want. Hands-on activity. Let me show you how this all comes off." He grins. "Probably something you should know how to do for emergencies anyway, right?"
He supposed Steve was right. "Yeah. I guess I've got one too." He picked up the crop, considering. "I'm going to start nice and slow with the crop. Warm you up a little before we move on to the floggers."
"You're
She met his eyes. "Do you want to talk about it?"
"Right now."
Tony tosses the negator away like it's garbage, and then Tony's gauntleted hands gently settle on Steve's head, moving lightly over his scalp. Checking for sore spots.
Tiberius pursed his lips, thoughtfully. "And does he believe himself defamed?"
Iron Man stares at him for a few seconds. At least he's stopped laughing now. "It's another word for unsolicited commercial e-mail," he says, patiently. His voice is kind. "I'm sorry; I didn't mean to make you feel bad. It's called spam because-- okay, you know what, we can talk about Monty Python some other time." Steve's not sure Iron Man's speaking English anymore. "Anyway," he continues, "even if you're a polite kind of person, which you are, you shouldn't bother reading your spam. No one does. And Viagra
"Yeah, it is," Steve agrees. "Hazard of the job, I suppose."
Relief flooded through Steve. If Steve had been in freefall this whole night, then Tony had just caught him. Tony was always there to catch him. Somehow Steve had forgotten that. Tony had needed so much from him, tonight -- but Tony was always there when Steve needed him, just the same. They held each other up.
The computer that Ghost is sitting at chimes quietly. The window with the progress bar in it has closed. Ghost turns, obviously taking in the results, and then he stands up.
"Sunset started cornering me last year," Tony said, dully. "In public. I ended up agreeing to work for her, so I didn't make a scene at my own party. Unfortunately, I wasn't working for her in public. She was-- she was actually the one holding Jocasta hostage." That explained the terrible expression that had been on Tony's face. "Her idea of distracting me from finding Jocasta was, uh, grabbing me and kissing me." His words were hesitant. "I-- I didn't tell her no."
"Oh, please," Stone said. "Call me Tiberius. I insist."
After all, Mr. Stark was the one who asked Steve out on a date. It's not as if Mr. Stark hasn't been interested in him. And all the papers have assured Steve that Mr. Stark knows how to charm people, whether or not there's any romantic intent.
Then Tony started stroking him in earnest, and Steve let his head tip back against the pillow, losing himself in the sensation. The cliché would have been to say that he couldn't form words, but that had never, ever been Steve's problem. He wasn't so great at coherent thought, but as soon as someone else started touching him, his mouth never stopped.
He had a feeling Natasha had told him about that one. It sounded very Russian.
He'd always felt a little guilty that five years on, a major part of his memory of finding out Tony's secret identity had also involved finding out his liking for skimpy underwear. Apparently it hadn't just been the one pair.
"Tony?" Stephen says. "What's the matter? Is it another--"
Iron Man looks away for a few seconds, like he's trying to figure out what to say, and then back at him. "You're very kind," he says, gently. "You're the kindest man I've ever known. No one's ever offered me anything like that before. I'm touched, I really am. But... I'm okay. I'm doing just fine. I don't need money."
Tony nodded. His eyes were sliding shut. He turned halfway over, burrowing against Steve's shoulder, throwing an arm over him like he needed to hold Steve as close as humanly possible in order to experience true contentment. Steve was more than fine with this.
"Okay," Iron Man says, his voice clouded with confusion, "now
"So," Steve rasped, "what was your solution?"
"So good," he gasped out, incoherent, grateful. "Tony, please, Tony, oh, like that, yes, perfect."
It was no problem. He was Iron Man. He'd just call the suit, will Bleeding Edge into existence, let it seep out of his bones and through his skin--
If Iron Man hadn't existed, Steve would have said yes to Mr. Stark. In a heartbeat. But he doesn't think knowing that will make Mr. Stark feel any better.
This was why the Avengers were here. Sure, Damage Control could handle the rebuilding, but the Avengers had a lot of gear and data that Tony knew no one else should be getting their hands on, and it was up to them to sort it out first. It looked like his workshop was a mess -- but, well, it was his workshop, and he was the person with the best odds of being able to clean it as safely as possible.
"It's not--" Steve lifts a hand and waves it vaguely around-- "like that. You've got nice thighs. I just thought you'd be a comfy pillow."
But, well, Tony's pretty sure he only gets to do this particular thing once, and he'll be damned if he doesn't at least try to have exactly what he wants. Steve's definitely going to get exactly what he wants, so why shouldn't Tony?
This time Tony doesn't move his hand away. He just keeps petting Steve's head, soft and rhythmic. Steve realizes that he's barely even hard anymore, himself. He's just a thing for Tony. He's not a person. He doesn't have to be a person right now. He doesn't have to be a soldier. He doesn't have to give orders. Something inside him shakes loose, a rusty lock opening, setting something free.
Was this whole apparatus some kind of drug thing? Steve only had the vaguest idea of what illicit drugs anyone was doing these days -- Jesus, he hoped it wasn't Mutant Growth Hormone -- but he also knew Tony had never done anything harder than marijuana, and even that had been years ago. After Tony had been homeless on the streets, the question of IV drug use had most definitely come up, and he knew Tony wouldn't have lied about it. Not to him. But this obviously hadn't been up to Tony, and Steve had no idea what Tiberius was into other than accumulating money, abusing his significant others, and committing first-degree murder.
And since he's going out as Captain America, side by side with his teammate Iron Man, he doesn't even get to dress up.
He goes down to his workshop. He needs privacy above all, and right now Steve won't know how to find him here. Good.
Tony remained silent. He hadn't even talked to the Avengers. It was unlike him, to say nothing. Steve suspected it was probably on the advice of his lawyer.
do," Steve said, almost fondly.
Okay, apparently there had been a lot of Avengers romantic entanglements lately that Steve hadn't been paying attention to while focusing on Tony. That sounded like a mess. But also like a mess where no one involved was imminently getting badly hurt. Unlike Tony.
Tony shuts his eyes and tries to breathe. "Yes, sir."
Oh, geez. Steve had thought it might have been simple regret. Recriminations about all the time they could have been together and hadn't been. If Tony had been anyone else, Steve would have said that the time they hadn't been together hadn't been a waste, because they'd still gotten to be in each other's lives, and he couldn't consider that a waste. And all of that was true, as far as it went. But Tony was Tony, and the time they hadn't been together had, in many ways, not been all that great for Tony, precisely because of who he'd been with instead and everything they'd done to him. Easy platitudes about how everything Tony had endured in his life had made him who he was today weren't going to cut it. He'd gone through multiple abusive relationships, and it was bitter to think that Steve could have spared him all that pain if only he'd been brave enough to speak up.
He was
He closed the phone and turned around, finding that Tony had not only not moved an inch, he was staring at him with a faint smile that suggested he had definitely been enjoying the view. Steve was very aware of his own nudity in a way that was somehow exciting and vulnerable at the same time.
So Tony hit him again, still lightly, on the other cheek this time; Steve whined with impatience and clenched down even harder.
His shield-roughened hands aren't catching on Tony's skin, so he must be doing this right. And when he judges that Tony's back is soft enough with oil, he begins, lightly at first, with his hands still in the dip of Tony's lower back. Under his hands Tony is warmer right here than he should be. Tension. Pain. Inflammation. Steve hasn't woken up with a backache since 1940, but he knows what it used to feel like. He rubs little circles there, gently.
Before Steve is really conscious of what he's doing, he's halfway across the room, and perching himself on the edge of the bed next to Tony. The bed creaks even more.
Steve grimaces in the twilight. "Definitely dangerous," he says, but his lips purse, like he's seriously considering it. "I still have nightmares about the war, you know." His voice is soft. "Saw a lot of ugly things, But-- somehow I don't think that's what you mean, do you?"
"Steve--"
When Steve looks up, Tony smiles a watery smile. "I'll see what I can do about that one."
Something in Tony unfroze then, like all the joints in his armor had come unlocked at once, and before he could tell himself not to do it he took three swift steps forward, into Steve's personal space.
That was-- that was a goddamn
He'd given Tony the shield to hang onto, because Tony couldn't very well hold onto him if he was the one wearing it. He trusted Tony with it, Tony more than anyone else, which Steve supposed also said a lot of things about him that he was hoping Tony wouldn't figure out.
This wasn't going to get better. Ever.
Tony's mouth is half-open. "You mean that?" he asks, and there's a light in his eyes that hasn't been there since -- well, since earlier this evening. He looks... enthralled. Enraptured. In a very, very good way. He chuckles. "That's a dumb question, I know. It's
"He wouldn't have been newsworthy if you hadn't purposefully made him into the top story." Steve clenched his jaw hard. "He wasn't newsworthy until you decided to air footage of him walking out of Donahue Development and used that tenuous connection to accuse him of ordering Iron Man to kill Whiplash."
"But you don't know if that's different in DreamVision," Tony pointed out.
It felt nice, weirdly intimate, to be wearing Tony's armor.
But Tony's hand didn't move from that spot the whole rest of the way home.
Steve's stomach was in knots. Had he made a mistake? He jerked his hand away from Tony, where he'd still been resting his hand on the back of Tony's neck.
He wants Stephen gone. This had nothing to do with him. Stephen may have been the gun, but Tony pulled the trigger. And Tony knows -- oh, how he knows -- how weapons work. He knows who Steve will go for.
