“No, Steve, you broke us!” Tony angrily jabbed a finger in the soldier’s face. “You ran off with Barnes, knowing full well that, any second, he could have been brainwashed to hurt you or even kill you.”
“No, zip it. Let’s settle this once and for all. You want to know how I feel about us?” Tony snapped and lifted up the back of his t-shirt. “Does this answer your questions?”
Steve reached out and lightly traced a finger over the tattoo. There was a slight flinch, but Tony remained still. Steve dared to brush his hand over the small of Tony’s back. It had been too long since he felt the warm skin against his palm.
“I fell in love with a do-gooder who rubbed off on me in more ways than one,” Tony quipped, hoping that Steve would cave. “Just one more hour.”
Steve was stunned at Tony’s brash reaction. He had been prepared for some hostility, aware that he deserved it, to an extent. But the soldier hadn’t expected a tattoo, of all things, to set it off. Something didn’t quite add up. Steve mentally steeled himself for the argument that was brewing.
Tony jerked away and walked over to the sink. He washed his hands under some cool water. “What do you want from me, Rogers?”
Tony took a sip of coffee before continuing. “There is also some leftover apple pie in the fridge. If you don’t want to fight Nat for it, I suggest grabbing it now.”
Yet he was unable to appreciate it completely. The setting sun meant the day at the lake was over. To confirm this, the arms around his waist began slipping away. When Steve made his way out of the water, Tony wanted to pull him back in and preserve the happy moment. Instead he followed his boyfriend and lifted himself up onto the pier.
Tony entered the master bedroom of the lake house. He could hear the shower running in the bathroom attached, indicating that Steve’s earlier comment was serious. Dumping the garment bags on the bed, Tony pictured his boyfriend under the shower. Just the thought of Steve’s wet blonde hair and soapy body had him ignoring the request for separate showers.
As he looked at Steve’s face, a sense of calm washed over Tony. He kissed his boyfriend’s lips in gratitude. Tony moved to slide his arms around Steve’s waist but the soldier was shuffling away. When their kiss broke, Steve slipped off the bed.
An annoyed Tony finally spun around to face Steve. He spat out a sarcastic response. “If this is some ploy to get my shirt off, forget it. You lost the right to see me naked when you ran off with Barnes.”
Tony quivered as Steve moved behind him and began soaping his back. Strong hands rubbed all over his skin, moving from his shoulder and down to his hips. He moaned as the hands caressed back up his spine. Steve’s arms slid around his waist to hug him from behind. Tony spun around to face Steve, beaming with happiness.
“I see you’ve got yourself a new tattoo.” Steve commented, glancing at Tony’s back as though to look through the shirt. “Care to show me.”
“My fabulous ass, then?” Tony asked, flirtatiously. He was glad the running water helped disguise the tears of emotion welling up.
“Why a-ha-re you… ti-hee-hee-ckling me,” Tony stammered through his mirth.
Tony busied himself with cleaning up the spilled coffee. “Well, you did.”
Tony began to lick down Steve’s neck, his facial hair grazing the smooth skin. Steve gasped when his shirt buttons were ripped open by an eager Tony. He responded by lifting Tony’s t-shirt off over his head. The two men pressed their naked midsections against each other and resumed kissing passionately. Steve felt his back pressed against the kitchen counter and he dug his nails into Tony’s tattoo.
Steve turned to his ex, placing his hands on his hips. The small talk was frustrating and merely delayed the inevitable. He was about to say as such, when something caught his eye. Tony scratched his lower back, causing his t-shirt to ride up for a second. There was the unmistakeable mark of tattoo ink on the bare skin. Though he only caught a brief glimpse, Steve found something familiar about the design.
“I can’t believe you’re this ticklish.” Steve moved to straddle Tony’s hips. “I see why you need your suits of armour now.”
Tony refused to meet Steve’s eyes while he filled his mug. “I’m not sleeping anyway. Might as well get some work done.”
“You know I haven’t even gotten started yet,” Steve said before digging in to Tony’s armpits with purpose.
“Happy birthday, Tony.” Steve slipped his hand to Tony’s crotch, fingering his cock. “Now, remind me how you wanted to celebrate, again.”
“You don’t think a life with me would be exciting enough?” Tony asked, his lips brushing the skin when he spoke.
“Fine, we’ll be on time.” Sighing in defeat, Tony finished towelling off, giving his arc reactor one last pat down. “You get the shower running and I’ll get our suits from the car.”
“My bedroom is bigger.” Tony tugged at Steve’s hand. “And, as much as I would like to pick up where we left off in the kitchen, we do need to talk.”
Steve let out a sigh of frustration. The soldier couldn’t get a syllable out before he was cut off.
Steve let the words sink in. It was hard to hear that Tony doubted his love. “You know I loved you, Tony. I still do.”
Tony didn’t know what to think while Steve kept tickling him. He couldn’t deny there was a certain pleasantness to it. Tony’s whole body jolted as Steve’s fingers mercilessly crawled all over his foot. Loud laughter rang throughout the bedroom. The tickling soon moved up to Tony’s toes, with Steve delicately scratching underneath them.
“Some guys I knew used this to relieve stress. I thought it might help.” Steve explained as he rubbed Tony’s ankle. “Makes for a nice bonding experience during tough times.”
“Are you sure?”
“Well, now I’m back. For good, I promise.” Steve cupped Tony’s face, tilting it towards him. “Even if we only talk during meetings and missions, I’m here for you. I need you to know that.”
“Thanks,” Steve replied, though he made no attempt to get the spread.
Upon reaching the small of Steve’s back, he tongued the sensitive spot. He enjoyed the loud moan that sounded as Steve buckled. Tony moved lower, teasing the soldier by nuzzling down between the crack. He gripped one of the toned ass cheeks and squeezed, hinting at what was to come.
“I’ve seen how anxiety affects you. I didn’t want to make things worse, because I cared about you.” Steve explained, feeling an emotional ache in his chest. “Maybe it was selfish of me not to tell you but I knew when you found out it would break us.”
“You’ve been genetically engineered to have the perfect body. You don’t need anything else to turn me on.” Tony slipped his arms around Steve’s waist, pressing their bodies together. “But I guess with all the porn out there, it’s not surprising that some people are into it. Wait a second, are you into it?”
“I didn’t mean to torture you.” Steve looked guilty as he lay back down beside Tony. “I wanted to make you laugh, get you out of your head for a moment. And there was always a chance that it turned you on, so I thought it was worth a shot.”
Steve was surprised by both the revelation and the strong language. “Why didn’t you tell us about this before? Brutal honesty is usually your forte.”
Tony rolled over so he was on top of his boyfriend. He practically ripped off Steve’s shirt in desperation. He licked his lips at the hero’s perfect body, laid out before him. Leaning down towards Steve’s lips, Tony kept seductive eye contact the whole time. He ran his hands up Steve’s sides, searching for the sweet spot. There was a slight, yet familiar, flinch when he swiped his fingers over the rib cage.
Tony’s breath hitched in realisation. His suspicions were confirmed when Steve knelt down and rubbed his legs. The man he loved proceeded to grab his hand, giving the fingers a gentle squeeze. Tony had imagined this moment many times, but didn’t dare to believe it would really happen.
“It didn’t occur to me until I spent the whole day here, with you.” Tony shook his head and waved a hand dismissively. “But, you said you had a birthday surprise planned. I’m not going to be the asshole that ruins that.”
“Where do you think you’re going?” Tony reached out towards Steve, beckoning him back.
“I love you, too, Cap,” Tony replied with a light nuzzle.
Tony expected Steve’s hand to go down to his belly. Instead, the soldier leaned in to kiss over the scar. A trail of kisses made their way up Tony’s collarbone and neck. Steve’s hand grazed down his side, stopping at his hip. When the couple’s lips met in a sweet kiss, Tony realised what he truly craved in the moment.
Within a second, Steve was pulled into Tony’s arms. He barely had time to breathe before their lips crashed together in a desperate kiss. Steve opened his mouth, greeting Tony’s tongue with his own. Long missed sensations filled his body and a moan escaped him. He ran his hand into Tony’s hair, savouring the strands running through his fingers.
“Not enough to stick around,” Tony shot back, bluntly. “Not enough to tell me your brainwashed BFF killed my parents.”
Tony pulled his shirt down and turned back to Steve. Vulnerability was shining in his brown eyes. “You left the sketch on your desk and I took it. Even if you didn’t love me back, at least I had some part of you. Then, one night I got stupidly drunk and had it tattooed on me. He’s no you, but the guy did a pretty good job with it.”
The massage continued on the other foot, Steve’s touch seeming to get softer. Tony began to feel a tingling over his skin. His foot twitched slightly when Steve further lightened the pressure. Tony let out a giggle when a thumb scratched over his arch. Suddenly, a scribbling sensation ran all over his sole as Steve tickled with purpose. The tech genius succumbed to a fit of laughter.
“Happy has the ring, since I thought I’d be doing this at the party, but I can’t wait anymore…” Steve was grinning wide as the words came out. “Anthony Edward Stark, will you marry me?”
“Let’s stay here tonight,” Tony whispered desperately into Steve’s ear. “Please.”
A concerned Steve reached for Tony’s hand, taking it in his own. “Are you okay?”
“Do your worst, Cap.” Tony lifted up his arms, holding the top of the headboard. His underarms and body were exposed as a result. “Well, maybe not your worst because you are trained in interrogation techniques. You know what I mee-hee-hee-n.”
A smile came to Tony’s face as he went to whisper in Steve’s ear. “Payback time.”
Tony gasped, sarcastically. “Oh, shit. Can I take it all back then?”
Tony gave a good natured eye roll, hating that Steve was right. “Let’s just say if you wanted to
“Exactly, my party. Which means it won’t start until I get there,” Tony reasoned as he stood up. He grazed a hand up and down Steve’s arm. “There will be so many people they won’t notice, anyway.”
Everyone else had assumed that Tony wanted his typical playboy birthday bash. In the past, the purpose was to drink away loneliness and hook up with random people. Now that he was with Steve, there was no appeal in such a party. Tony preferred to spend time with the person who cared about him beyond networking and star fucking.
“And do you, Anthony Edward Stark, take Steven Grant Rogers, to be your lawfully wedded husband to love and to cherish, for richer and for poorer, in sick and in health, until death do you part?”
He smiles at them through the rearview mirror and nearly laughs at how red both their faces are. “You looked like you had fun.”
Rhodey, Carol, Sam, and Sharon follow shortly after, bringing in their own tupperwares of deserts.
Steve snorts. “Was he good today?”
“Devils! The both of you! I’m going to return you!”
Steve and Tony made it a point to tell their kids that they were not at fault for their biological parents surrendering them.
Jaime’s scream of “VICKY!” from outside confirms it. Tony sighs once again and offers his arms up to hold Ollie, Steve transferring the now-whimpering babe easily to him.
He loves and loves and
“What?” Tony whispers quietly, his hands pausing where they lay against Steve’s golden hair. Under the July sun, the younger’s baby blues shine like diamonds as he tilts his head up to look at Tony’s shocked face. Steve’s eyebrows twitch in confusion but he keeps his gaze locked.
The others gasp as Steve smiles, his eyes meeting Tony’s shocked ones.
“What—”
Steve follows the constant string of swearing and the sound of metal clinking against each other with a raised eyebrow only to find the suspect in question wearing a cutesy apron and looking absolutely flustered surrounded by pans and pots of various desserts and meals with different amounts of readiness.
It seemed like an odd blessing when they found twin babies— one a girl with brown hair and brown eyes, one a boy with blond hair and blue eyes— at the orphanage, twins solely due to being born on the same day, that looked so similar to Steve and Tony, and they had laughed about it, but it was obvious they were smitten the second they landed their eyes on the little tykes.
“Are you just naming my mistakes ‘cause I’m feeling very attacked right now-”
Tony hums dismissively before he smirks, looking up to meet Steve’s eyes with his own full of mischief and amusement. “You know who
James, Jaime, and Ollie join their embrace, talking animatedly as the twins throw questions about decorations and dates and flowers at Steve and Tony’s face.
“Yeah?” Steve’s hand comes up to rest upon his cheek, thumb stroking back and forth against the sweat-slicked skin but Tony doesn’t care if his bangs are falling, dripping, onto his forehead or that he’s even more uncomfortable being so close with another heat-emanating being.
Steve shakes his head fondly but he heads upstairs anyway to hunt for the Christmas lights. He finds them in the laundry room as Tony said they would and brings the boxes downstairs to finish hanging them up around the living room.
tender eyes, the sight of him and their children surrounding them leaving Steve with a full-body warmth that he never wants to replace.
Tony gives up a few moments in anyway. “Go hang the lights up, you jerk,” he calls out to Steve as the blond walks out, but not before taking his revenge and slapping his ass. Steve jumps as response and swivels his head fast enough to feel an ache to glare at his partner, who was too busy cackling to respond.
They catch up on the driveway while Steve helps get their bags out of their car, the twins and Bucky and Nat’s daughter, Victoria, head inside.
When the party has calmed down a bit, Steve and Tony are swaying on the dance floor, suit jackets off and ties loose.
here, with the Avengers. Without you, I don’t know if I would’ve made it this far, to be honest. You challenge me, push me to see that the world is gray and not just black and white. You always want me to be better and to compromise, even when it’s just to compromise over who the better Batman actor is.”
He wants to go wherever Tony goes, wants to be close to him for all his life, and he knows they belong to each other in all the ways that matter, and all the ways that don’t. Tony gave him a purpose, somewhere to belong, and it wasn’t under the roof of a Brooklyn apartment, or the roof standing above their heads now, but it was

Steve shifting on his lap breaks Tony out of the mental conversation he’s having with himself about how annoying the heat is. “Uh, yes?”
Bedlam ensues and Tony grins toothily as Steve throws his head back and laughs, that beautiful red flush covering his neck at the inappropriate comment. Everyone is groaning, and most of their family is cradling their heads in their hands in resignation. The priest next to them, Tony is sure, is mumbling catholic prayers in Latin under his breath.
Steve sighs in relief, happy about the fact that their leftovers will have a purpose after all. He walks over to where Tony’s mixing a bowl of pasta sauce and wraps his arms around his waist, the man humming in pleasure as he continues the task leaned against Steve’s front, his head fitting perfectly in the dip of Steve’s neck.
he’s died multiple times, gone through alternate dimensions, even pseudo-adopted a few superhero kids, but marriage is the most important promise Tony has ever taken up for Steve.

“I know right? Respect that hussle though,” Tony says, voice muffled as Steve walks further into the living room and places the small decorations lying on the floor back in their respectfully labeled holiday boxes.
Tony smiles and separates but his forehead is still pressed against his lover’s and it feels so right when he whispers against Steve’s lips,“Yeah. I do.”
you, but compared to who I was before New York and Afghanistan—” the others hold their breaths at that particular mention, “—you saved me, Steve Rogers. You made me see things I wouldn’t have before and weirdly enough, you’ve always encouraged my recklessness as long as you were there to keep an eye on me. You’re stubborn, and mild-tempered at times, but you’re my other half and without you, I don’t know who I’d be.”
“Heyyyy,” Sam whines, “That’s cheating.”
“There is just one thing I need—” Jaime continues.

Steve struggles to hide his smile when Tony turns to him for backup. He just holds his hands up in surrender.
Then life became so busy that it left them barely any time to think about getting married properly.
Steve revels in the calm atmosphere and embraces the domesticity of it.
By the time Steve finishes hanging up the lights, it’s already time to pick the twins up and he thinks of when he and Tony first got them.
Last to arrive is Peter and Harley, whose families won’t be able to join the Christmas Eve celebrations but will join them the next day.
“Iiiiiiiissssssssssssssssssssss—” James riffs dramatically, Jaime bursting into laughter halfway through.
“Snowy, but Vick slept through the entire ride so it wasn’t bad,” Natasha answers, coming up by Bucky’s flank to hug Steve.
“I can get her. Is Jay with her?”
He was willing to settle quickly and simply head to the courthouse to sign just to get it over with, but Steve had decided that they were going to go all out and actually do the damn ceremony.
Tony nudges his head forwards and slants his mouth against Steve’s, wet and open, but still so passionate. It’s a soft press of summer-dried lips against each other, chapped and damp from licking their lips, and their clothes are sticking to their bodies in the most heavy, uncomfortable way but this is where they know they should be— having fallen and still falling in love under the shade of the oak trees they climbed in their elementary and high school days, meters away from the places they discovered themselves, underneath the same sky that they grew up and left and came back together under.

“Hey, dad,” they say simultaneously as they shuffle into the backseat of the car with their puffy winter jackets, wriggling in their seats as they try to get comfortable.
wedding cake.
and what he gave to Steve— his time, his attention, the chance to become a father to three beautiful children. Steve found a home—
“I’m gonna guess that’s Nat and Buck,” Steve says.
The velvet box was already sitting under the Christmas tree wrapped in gift wrap, after all.
“I just want you for my own—”
“Underneath the Christmas tree—”
“Um, getting ready for tonight? You haven’t forgotten have you?” Tony raises an eyebrow at him.
, standing in front of each other with their hearts in their hands with all the people they love— their little makeshift family formed by trigger-happy assassins and spies and enhanced beings and fighters with just the right weapons— standing by their sides in front of a gaggle of people to bear witness to their truths.
“I’m kidding, I’m kidding.” Tony exhales, the cool air against his top lip. Steve hums, turning his face away so his cheek is pressed against his own hand. Tony is pliant underneath him, leaning back on his arms with his legs crossed at the ankle. He keeps his eyes on the fluttering strands of blond hair from the breeze and the curl of Steve’s eyelashes against his cheekbones as he breathes slowly, lax and sleepy.
when Steve’s face smooths out to just give way to a soft smile and twinkling baby blues (
“Why not? You used to like it,” Tony says through his wheezing laughter, cheeks flushed with glee.
This is only the second Christmas they’ve celebrated in this house and Steve admires the way Tony’s decided to go overboard with decking it out outrageously in greens and reds and golds. Before, they’ve always driven down to D.C. to Bucky and Nat’s house because their apartment in Brooklyn was too small to house anybody besides them and their then family of four, but Steve finally got the promotion he wanted and they were able to buy their larger— though still a bit small but it was enough— house in a good neighborhood.
“Ummm,” Tony starts as he skims the short phrase he had written on the card. Wincing, he crumples the paper up into a small ball, Steve looking at him in confusion, before he throws it over his shoulder and takes Steve’s hands back in his and clears his throat.
Tony narrows his eyes at his soon-to-be-husband but the moment is too soft for it to mean anything. He reaches into his own suit to pull out the singular flashcard he had stuffed into a pocket earlier.

“Yes, thank
“As long as it’s not the TV, I think we’ll be fine,” Steve chuckles.
They run into the house first with noisy stomps and by the time he’s unloaded everything out of the trunk, Tony’s yelling at them to not touch any of the desserts lying around the kitchen.
The twins were 16 now and moving upstate a year after Steve got his dream job as curator at the MET allowed them to give the twins the upbringing both men were deprived of; they went to high school in a good neighborhood and were signed up in extracurriculars they were interested in, and most importantly, they had two parents that loved and treasured them dearly.
They sit at the dining table until late in the night, simply catching up and letting the tensions of their day to day life leave their bodies.
“I know right!” Tony agrees, pulling out his phone to snap a picture of the cake.
There’s so much hidden in his irises (
Steve didn’t expect to walk back into a house that looked like Santa’s elves personally flew down from the North Pole and decorated it.
“Not in the kitchen,
“Oh dear lord,” Tony sighs, rubbing his temples. Steve sighs along with him, picking Ollie up and bouncing lightly to calm him down.
” Steve lowers his head to level an almost frustrated look at the brunet but it’s fond, “That I love you for who you are and you really can’t sway my opinion of you.”
Steve huffs, his hand instinctively coming up to rest against Tony’s hips when he steps even closer. “I told you— I had to get some last minute Christmas shopping done.”
missed daddy?”
“Tony, I already said yes,” the blond boy sighs, rolling his eyes, “I love you. Very much.”
Ollie squeals and claps along to James and Jaime’s purposefully obnoxious singing as they prance around the kitchen, Tony swaying his hips to the music as he continues cooking.
Their first visitors arrive just a little after seven p.m. and Steve knows this because the twins scream so loud in excitement Ollie startles in his high-chair and starts bawling.
“When I woke up 67 years later than I thought I would, I was scared and alone and frankly, I didn’t want to live anymore because my life was gone.” Steve licks his lips and takes another breath in, looking straight into Tony’s eyes with
,” Tony says.
“Hi, Ollie!” Steve greets, a large swell of paternal love filling in his chest at the sight of the chubby child with curly brown hair and blue eyes.
“Yeah, PDA,” James adds.
,” Steve laughs, “your turn.”
Tony narrows his eyes at them. “Like you two don’t know what romance is.”
Steve’s eyes meet his son’s wide ones in the rearview mirror as James says, “Mia threatened to walk into my room at 3 a.m. like the grudge.”
“Go help them, I got him.”
The kiddos eventually break off after their plates are cleaned to go back up to the game room, their own screams and laughter echoing downstairs as the adults slowly get tipsy over wine and nibbles of sweets.
” Pepper asks, bewildered, Rhodey wheezing at her side. Tony turns to her with a broad smile and nods.
Tony is shaking, his own emotions about to burst out of their cage and Steve has to squeeze his hands to bring him back to the present.
“I don’t want a lot for Christmas—” James starts.
But now, Steve turns to Tony with red-rimmed eyes, the crow’s feet prominent at his eyes, in pure, unadulterated happiness because
“I couldn’t think of ‘nother way to say what I wanted t’say,” Tony says simply, scooting up so his hip touches Steve’s and resting his chin on his
Steve squeaks and jokingly pushes Tony away, the latter dissolving into a heap of laughter. “For the love of all that is holy, do

— wanted to treat his future husband, the man he wants to spend the rest of his life with, the way he deserves to be treated. Steve wanted to show Tony his devotion and wanted to show it off to the world.
Pepper, and Happy arrive with their own unbelievable amount of gifts that they can’t even fit them under the tree.
” Harley whoops as Clint rises from the edge of the pool sopping wet and cheering.
“Wow. You really love me, huh?” Tony mutters suddenly, waking the nearly-asleep blond on his lap, “Is it ‘cause I was the greatest person the school ever spawned? Or is it ‘cause I’m rich? Oh my god Steve, am I your sugar daddy? I’m over eighteen so technically it’s legal— wait, is it legal? Are you only with me ‘cause—”
Steve shoots up, arranging his body so he sits criss-cross next to Tony but close enough so their thighs press together, layered with sweat and dew. “Tony— Tony, stop deflecting. No, I’m not with you ‘cause of your money. And— okay, maybe
“Lines weren’t surprisingly too long, even though it’s Christmas Eve, but what are you doing?” Steve steps closer to the counter and catalogues the five pans of cookies, the two tins of brownies, and a large pot of chicken noodle soup simmering over the stove.
Steve lowers his voice into a chuckle. “Your bones just aren’t as used to it, Jay.”
Steve trembles under those amber hues, shaking at the prospect of finalizing his place in the future with
There’s a beat of silence the reverberates through the church before Steve opens his mouth and leaves Tony speechless.
Tony cheers for the archer while next to him, Steve takes another glass of Asgardian mead and downs it all in one gulp.
“Mia and the girls dragged me over to stretch with them,” James says, eyes wide in horror. Steve almost opens his mouth to ask why he looks so scared when Mia throws her head back and lets out a nearly disturbing cackle.
Time passes by in the noisy household as more of their guests start arriving.
him. It should hurt, he thinks, loving someone this much but he feels it digging and digging into his bones with a heavy coat— the mere adoration and tranquility knowing his heart,
“Anything I can help you with?” Steve asks, but Tony waves him off.
“Husband,” Tony giggles.
Dinner is another boisterous affair.
Steve made Tony wait six fucking months just to call him his husband, the fucker.
“Babe, that’s still
When Steve goes back downstairs with Ollie in his arms, the first few notes of ‘All I Want for Christmas Is You’ are just starting to play over the radio and the twins are holding batter-covered spatulas to their mouths in replace of mics.
The crowd chuckles softly and Steve notices the Avengers— his
I’m with you ‘cause you were the greatest person… Why did you say ‘spawned’?” The confusion lines on Steve’s foreheads crease further and Tony has to stifle a laugh because
Steve nods smiling, bringing Tony’s hand to his lips and kissing the vibranium ring there. “Husband.”
“Actually, Tony has one more,” Steve says when everyone’s opened their one gift.
He hears Pepper, Rhodey, and Natasha mumble a small ‘jesus christ’, which is just
Steve loses it when he comes up to Tony’s side and sees the plastic Iron Man and Captain America figurines on the cake, positioned in their superhero poses.
“Missed ya,” Steve whispers against Tony’s neck. The smaller man lets out a chuckle, body going lax in Steve’s arms.
“I don’t care about the presents—”
They break apart and lean their foreheads together, breathing heavily.
Jaime and James are standing outside the gym talking to Jaime’s other cheerleading friends when he pulls up in front of the gym.
“Dad, I wanna be a flower girl,” Jaime says.
“On Christmas Eve?” Steve asks incredulously.
“Ollie down for his nap?”
Steve clears his throat and Tony feels
Tony blubbers at him while the twins giggle, delighted at their stolen goods. Just as Tony’s about to yell at him— probably call him a traitor or something— a loud squeal echoes its way downstairs.
Tony whips around with a fairly guilty grimace but he scuffles over to Steve and goes on his tiptoes to press a quick kiss against his lips anyway. “Hi love, you’re early.”
“Sorry ‘bout the cake, Mr. Stark,” Peter apologizes, his cheeks flushed red.
“Then I met you,” Steve continues, “and you gave me a

much emotion it knocks Tony way off his game.
of food,” Steve trails off.
“I was a wreck before you.” Tony sucks in a breath, grimacing. “Needless to say, I was and still am a wreck
“You love me?” Tony asks, subconsciously thumbing Steve’s cheekbone where it was pressed against his stomach.
Bucky, in all his casualness, also leaves a rather loud smack on the cheek on Tony before digging his head into their fridge and grabbing two beers, handing one of them to Steve. Steve shakes his head and laughs when his to-be-fiance and best friend start to banter pointlessly.
“Yep. Basketball court was open in the gym so he went with.”
“I didn’t want the cake to be generic so.”
Steve used to think the flame he had for Peggy was large enough, but knowing what he knows now,
It’s another mess to find everybody’s gifts in the big pile under and surrounding the tree.
Ever the troublemaker, Harley leads the others down the stairs by using a thin mattress pad as a sled.
Gift-wrap flies around the room as everyone tears at their presents, grinning widely in gratitude. There’s sweaters and gift cards and weird thrifted trinkets that are just funny enough to be kept on display.
They’re laying on the grass just beyond the playground their friend group would just sit and get high at, between the main road and the baseball fields of their former high school. The balmy summer weather, even under the shade of oak trees, makes Tony’s t-shirt stick to his skin and his thighs, under denim shorts and Steve’s head, are clammy and itchy against the prickling grass.
“More than you could ever know—”
The two teenagers make a beeline for the twins and Tony shakes his head with his eyes wide in fear as they scramble up the stairs towards the game room with playful taunts.
He follows Steve into their room in silence. It still feels weird to think of it as “theirs”. Steve disappeared into the bathroom quickly and still without a word. Tony can hear the shower running, the steam rising from beneath the door.
Rhodey taps a few keys and the phone lights up. Its a little dinged up but still works. They all look surprised at his ability "I went to MIT too and he’s my best friend."
"Listen Steve. I know how much Barnes means to you and I’ll do everything I can to help him but you have need to sit this one out. If you get involved it will just make things worse for all of us and for him." He’s trying to keep emotion out of it. Steve is about to do something stupid. Tony wants to tell him it doesn’t have to be him, that the task force can handle Barnes but he already hears that resolve in Steve's voice.
"What the hell is going on?" Sam whispers
"He's on our side."
"I would have told you, but you signed the accord -"
Tony looks down at the pregnancy test still clutched firmly in his hand. He starts to explain though he figures it should be obvious.
“Always, sir.”
"All your gear, including the bird costume -" She winks at Sam "- is waiting there."
CIA Ross blabbers on as they follow him towards the command center. They are led to glass room where Secretary Ross is waiting. “Rogers. Stark. The rest of you can wait outside.” He looks pretty put together for a man dealing with an international crisis, Steve is less impressed as Secretary Ross rounds the conference table like a disappointed parent. He sits his fancy pen in the middle of the table. Steve to his credit, doesn’t even spare the man a glance.
“I'll be here when you get back.”
Sam and Steve share panicked look.
“I’m on my way.” Rhodey sys quickly before disconnecting.
Tony had been plagued by his own nightmares the last two weeks, not unusual when Steve was away for prolonged periods, but it had begun to mess with him in ways a phone call couldn’t fix. Only to wake up feeling sicker than a dog. He couldn’t say what it was about how they fit together that chased the nightmares away. On more than one occasion Steve had called him, looking as haggard as Tony felt, for something to chase the shakiness away . Some nights just a few stolen moments would do it, others required they talk until the sun rose on either one of the corners of their world.
“No but it’s run by people with agendas, and we know that agendas can change. The Avengers are supposed to be above that. They need to be.”
Before they can leave the room, a power surge goes through the building and everything goes dark for a second. Emergency power comes on a moment later. The stop at a door to the stairwell
"Steve we were blindsided. We couldn't know the doctor was a fake or that Tony was a target any sooner than we did. It’s not all on you.
Locks click and he finally gets a look at his captors. He's been abducted and held captive enough times to know neither is the man in charge. They cuff his hands, in front not behind thankfully, and shove him into the cold corridor.
“Hydra's most elite death squad. More kills than anyone in Hydra history and that was before the serum. When he could get the under control, they were lethal."
"We need to get down there now." Steve says. Sharon rattles off directions while Tony and Natasha scurry down the hall to join CIA Ross at the main command center.
He’s is still watching when Rhodey arrives twenty minutes later. They sit in silence, watching the coverage that switches between updates and footage of the fight that took the team from the parking lot of a bio-facility, to the packed street of a local market to the building that now lay in ruin. He takes a sharp breath when Rumlow press the button with Steve standing mere inches from him. Wanda did what she has to do Tony will always be grateful for it but this choice will cost her.
"I think he's waking up again."
Zemo cups Tony's face. "He'll be here soon enough, and the truth will reveal itself."
Tony shakes his head. Steve didn't know, he would have told him. He needs to believe Steve would have told him.
"Nothing that can’t be mended, I'm happy to disappoint you."
His heart begins to race when he feels that familiar pull.
They all follow close as Steve carts Bucky to the nearest containment unit back in the main arrival area.
_ _ _
"Could be but that doesn’t play. When he killed people it was covert, never something that looked like an assassination. If Steve was the target there were times before he could have come at you, more private, isolated moments than this.” His phone buzzes again but he’s on a roll. "But he attacks a public place, it’s too flashy. And for what purpose? If it’s Hydra then the accords give them the advantage.
"Tony and his damn fail-safe features." Steve smiles
There's a knock and Natasha’s head pokes in "Barnes evaluation is about to start."
“I did and the blowback from that wasn’t like this. This is bigger than us and what we decide now will determine a lot of things.”
"Again, that not what I want to talk about.” Tony puts a hand up as Steve seems to be settling into a longer statement. “A lot has happened while you’ve been chasing Rumlow for the last month" He starts go on but Steve's phone buzzes. Steve’s brow furrows for a moment before a look of dread comes across his features.
"Yes. Rhodey, Nat and I are fine. We got lucky."
“Maybe if we have one hand on the wheel we can still steer.” All eyes turn to Natasha. “We should read the terrain and something like this isn’t going to go away. Plus, you heard Ross, it’s sign or retire.”
"Thank you." Bucky whispers
"Buck, you don’t want a do this."
Vision offers his opinion which pretty much means he’s going to sign. Natasha admits she agree with him and Tony would tease her about it if he had the energy. He chances a glance at Rhodey who has already made his stance abundantly clear. For lack of anything better and because a wave of nausea just hit he sits back down on the couch. When he tunes back in Steve is speaking directly to Vision.
He lets him go. Anything he should say is trapped in this throat. He can’t drop this on him now, not when Steve looks like all the light has gone from the world. Sometimes Tony feels like he’s competing with the ghost of Steve's former life. Instead of letting himself go down that sad and frustrating pathTony heads back to the others. They’ve broken into smaller clusters which leaves Rhodey open to grab him by the arm and pull him aside. "Are you okay?"
This place is like cold storage, completely with grey walls and a thin sheet of ice where water has leaked through. This means water all around, so likely underground but its cold. An artic setting would explain what he's seeing
"I think there is something else here. Ross and Ross want a quick resolution, so they won’t dig." Tony adds
“I hadn’t been feeling well about as long as you were away chasing Rumlow, Doctor put me at about fifteen weeks. Morning sickness is evil. I don’t understand how anyone does it."
In minutes they know that a man named Zemo orchestrated all of this. Of course, this isn’t public yet, Jarvis is making the same deductive leaps that Tony would make. Rhodey sits back, engrossed in all the data that Jarvis is gathering when Tony's phone rings. Part of him hopes its Tony, the more cynical part knows it couldn’t be that easy.  He sits the phone in the middle of the table on speaker.
“You think they’ll come for me.” Wanda interjects.
"Is this Zemo?"
Rhodey suddenly jumps to his feet and head back towards what’s left of the conference room. "Did anyone find Tony's phone."
"Yes, right now. But what if they say whatever words trigger him. Plus, Tony's injured without armor, so how are we supposed to protect him and fight them off? We need a better plan than just going in guns blazing."
As Natasha and Sam verbally spar, Rhodey slides in next to Tony “You gonna tell him?”
Tony's phone buzzes in his hand but he doesn't look at it.
“Didn’t you?” Zemo laughed again “You held a potentially deadly operation in the middle of a civilian population without the agreement of the government, what would you call that?”
Her words sting, just a bit. It's not that he doesn't want to go but the foreign press tends to be a circus whenever he makes an appearance and this is about Steve saying farewell to Peggy, he doesn't want to distract from that.
Smoke billows from the half-collapsed building as the camera pans down over the covered bodies of those not fortunate enough to escape the destruction. The chaotic scene is intercut with camera footage of Wanda sending a flaming ball into the nearest solid object which just happened to be a building with three hundred people in it. The count is at eighty-nine dead, but Tony expects that number will change. Wanda killed citizens of Lagos and the fallout from this will hit critical mass.
"Look, I know you wanted to talk but can it wait? I–I need to go."
There's no ill will. Steve knows the story of how Rhodes fought his superiors to keep searching the Afghan desert for Tony.
"Tony! Tony, I need you to open your eyes.” She shakes him, not too hard in case there are injuries she can’t see. “Come on Tony. I need you to open your eyes!"
"For the moment." Steve says, his eyes never leaving the monitor. "You meant what you said, that you'll help him."
Steve stares at him for a moment. It’s hard to describe what he feels in those few seconds, but everything pulls into sharp focus even as Tony keeps talking.
_ _ _
"Don’t you think this is something that needs to be discussed with the team?" Steve's always earnest blue eyes stare up at him.
"Could the doctor control them?"
“Maybe. Probably. It wouldn't be just you. We’d do everything we can to prevent that.” Tony says and she gives Tony a small smile.
"You killed those people just to get to me."
Once Bucky is locked in Steve's scans the room before turning to Natasha "Where's Tony?"
“Take care of him.”
The burly man drags Tony to a smaller room “Perhaps the man coming to save you is not who you think he is."
"Agent Carter." A squirming agent approaches. Sharon joins him off to the side. He whispers something, and Sharon's face goes white. She comes back to them
After a few more agonizing seconds he hangs up. "It’s Peggy. She's gone."
“Who said anything about giving up?”
Tony takes the seat across the table. “If you sign everything that’s happened in the last twenty-four hours is legit. I can get Bucky into one of the best American psychiatric centers instead of him going to a Wakandan prison. This is the best solution for everyone.” Tony takes a deep breath, “I want you to know I heard what you said, I know you don’t want to compromise the Avengers or yourself. We need you, Steve.”
Tony only feels the slight prick of pain in his arm for a moment before consciousness flees from him again.
Bucky drops to one knee and when he stands, he is the Winter Soldier once more.
All eyes turn to Tony. Steve is already standing, stoic with a hint of protective alpha male. Its kind of hot but Tony knows he needs them to focus right now, it’s not about him.
Steve relaxes at that a bit.
“How’s Steve?”
"Steve. I’m sorry." He pulls him close. Steve sags a bit in his embrace, staying there for just a few seconds.
"We're gonna need whatever you've -"
“I should have seen it sooner.” Steve lies back on the bed. “I should have been me.”
All eyes outside the room are one them now with Ross and Steve standing practically chest to chest. Natasha and Sharon eye the spectacle, looking a cross between proud, amused and concerned. Tony grabs Steve arm, ignoring how foolish they must look with him pulling against the bulk of Steve’s weight. Thankfully Steve spares him the embarrassment and allows himself to be led from the room. Since he cares about prying eyes and ears Tony leads them to an office at the far end of the hall. Steve takes a few calming deep breaths, pacing back and forth. "I had to protect him, Tony."
“Soldier?”
Prince T'challa lost his father. The weight of that loss and being the new king sit on his shoulders, heavy. He sits a few feet across from them, staring at the ring that once belonged to his father. Natasha offers words but they don’t do much to dissuade the murderous intent in his eyes.
It doesn't take genius intellect to figure out what's happened. The way Steve's eyes lower, the way his shoulders deflate, the way his voice lowers to a hushed whisper. Tony backs away a bit, wanting to give Steve a little space and privacy.
Sharon smiles and pulls it out of her pocket "Figured he wouldn’t want Ross getting his hands on it."
“People are dead, and someone has to answer for that.” Ross stern voice cuts through his thoughts. The man leaves with his aide scurrying out behind him.
Steve stops before the pen touches paper “Wanda?”
“It wasn’t your fault.” Steve interjects quickly
Bucky laughs but it's far from joyful. "Your mom's name was Sarah. You used to wear newspaper in your shoes."
“I'm going to go to London for the funeral. He shouldn't be alone.” She says instead.
"I remember everything." Bucky's voice cracks just a bit. "If I tell you where you have to promise me, you'll blow that hellhole off the face of the earth."
"You think he was set up?" Steve sits forward now, alert and intrigued.
“We are if we’re not taking responsibility for our actions. This document just shifts the blame.”
A blur to his right catches his eyes…
The first thing Tony can make out are voices. Not immediately recognizable as anyone he knows followed by a feeling that quickly reminds him he is not in safe hands.
“How long?" Steve is beaming a little now
"It’s Sharon. I need to take this, she’s with Peggy."
"Only just."
Natasha holds Tony's hand as they move the stretcher to a waiting ambulance. She’s about to climb in with him when Sharon's voice comes over her com.
Bucky shakes his head "I had specific handlers; he was never one of them. I don't know who he is"
At Zemo's signal another man steps up and frees his wrists. "Take him back to his room. Captain America will be joining us soon and he won't be alone. We need to be ready."
Zemo puts hand on Tony's belly. "It makes you question everything. Even things you were so sure of." Tony breathes in and out. As much as he doesn't want to let Zemo get to him it hard to ignore the doubt settling in the pit of his stomach.
“You can’t get into a public screaming match with the Secretary of State. This is going to be messy, Ross is not backing down and King T'challa is out for blood. First we need to – " Steve cuts him off with a kiss.
"I have to tell you something." His phone buzzes again but he won’t let anything interrupt this moment. He sits his phone on the desk and goes for the picture in his pocket. Steve stares at it for a moment then his eyes go wide, and he gets it.
"It’s like Tony said, we need to dig. He got a notification from Jarvis just before the bomb went off.”
Tony always seemed to have enemies crawling from some dark corner of the world. Somehow thinking of Tony as a prisoner, hidden in some place where they'd never find him scared him just as much as the idea of his death does.
Tony squeezes his hand. "I promise."
"I just gave him enough sedative to put out four horses. I'd say we have 20 minutes to get him into another containment unit"
Steve doesn't want to press him too hard; Bucky is already looking worn out as is. Two years being free of Hydra control only to have that tenuous self control ripped from him, the last thing be wanted was to traumatize his friend any further.
“I didn’t purposely endanger lives?”
"Or he could kill you like he almost did in Washington. You can't just - I can't lose the fa-" Tony stops himself. He can’t blurt it out like that, he won’t use their child like that. He can’t be selfish either. The past matters to Steve, Bucky matters.
Steve shakes his head "We're going to have to make do. I don’t want to pull Wanda from the compound. Things are chaotic enough around her and I don’t want her in more trouble then she needs to be."
The psychologist goes through the usual checks. He queries about Bucky's time at Hydra, what buried memories have resurfaced and why he set off the bomb. Bucky maintains his innocence.
“Always, sir.”
The video has no sound, but Tony feels like he can hear everything. His father stumbles from the car, bleeding and disoriented but not drunk as Tony had always believed. Staggering until he dropped to his knees a foot or so from the car.
Steve, Natasha, Sam and Sharon stare back at him "He’s been hiding since Shield fell but he pops up to bomb the Accords signing. Why?"
"Hey, I would have been out in less than 10 but I was moving with those unskilled in the art of covert affairs." Natasha shrugs as Steve, Sam and Bucky give her the evil eye.
Rhodey gives him a glance “Congratulations, I guess.”
_ _ _
"If Steve was the target how could he know for sure Steve would be there. It doesn't add up." Sharon adds
"That's a promise." Sam adds
Steve gives him a small smile “And that was your choice. You chose to do the right thing, we sign this and we lose our right to choose. We let other people decide what the Avengers should or shouldn’t do or worse where we can or can’t go. Who does that help? The safest hands are still our own.”
"Enough." Sam says
“Tony…” Rhodey interjects
"Maybe his old Hydra protocol kicked in?" Nat offers.
Sharon shrugs and smiles as she hands Steve a keycard "This will get us past security.  We head down to sub-basement 4, there an old tunnel, head east it comes out across the street from a parking garage. There's a white van in lot 3B."
They all lay there in a breathless tangle of limbs.
Tony smiles “One of the positives to an eight hour flight.” Tony’s hand slips over his.
“And you thought this was going to be boring.” Sam teases extending a hand to help Sharon to her feet.
"Not so long ago you gambled with lives and lost. Was Lagos so different?”
“Jarvis, you there?”
Barnes is fast, inhumanly so and Sam only just moves his head as a metal fist comes flying. The door frame behind his head bends inward easily at contact. Steve is there instantly, grabbing Barnes shoulder and catching a swift roundhouse kick to the chest that sends him flying back into the far wall. Barnes is too fast, all Sam can do is dodge, barely. One well timed hit to chest and Sam goes flying, hitting the wall hard enough to makes him see stars. When his vision stops being wobbly, he sees Steve’s hand cuffed around Bucky’s metal wrist. That punch should have crushed Sam’s ribcage and sternum but thanks to Steve he didn’t catch the full force. Bucky rounds on Steve, unhooking the hand on his arm and sending Steve into a flip. The recognition from earlier is gone, replaced by the stone-cold killer.
"Captain, no need to cut so deep just yet, this has only just started."
“No. Rhodey, what happened with Ultron is on me. Hell, I don’t even know if having laws like this in place would have stopped me but I think we all agree we never want a situation where we wonder if it could have been prevented.”
"Please tell me you brought a suit"
Miles away a plane bound for an unknown destination sits, waiting to take off. Helmut Zemo looked over the prone form of one of the men that caused him so much pain. Tony Stark would pay for what he'd done to Sokovia. Unfortunately, the other part of the plan had fallen through. Barnes had failed to secure Rogers and the man would no doubt be on the warpath until he got his teammate back. That could work to his advantage. All he had to do was leave enough breadcrumbs for Rogers to follow, make it clear to come alone. Not that he expected Rogers would, too many loyal friends for them to allow him to do that. Still he would come all the same.
An explosion directly in front of them knocks them both back.
Steve brow furrows but he follows Tony into the hall, "I know you think we should sign but I'm not onboard with this. We're relinquishing our right to choose to be a hired goon squad. That's not what the Avengers are. What if there’s someplace we need to be and they don’t allow or worse yet what if they send us someplace we don’t need to go."
“This conversation is going to get ugly. I suggest you get this in there.”
"Maybe Steve wasn't the target. Maybe it’s someone else." Sam says
Jarvis is already on task, bringing up floating screens of various news networks before Tony has a chance to ask. It’s about the Avengers. Tony takes a deep breath; Steve nor any of the others are dead but they probably wish they were among the casualties instead of this.
"You know when you said his boyfriend is gonna kill Eleanor, I did not think it was literally " Cindy says faintly.
"Why me?" Betty moaned pitfully.
Oh well. He looked around the room wondering if he should have done something special to surprise Pete. He glanced down Peter did usually like it if he felt like he didn't have to hide his face in public but he also preferred Wade to not be uncomfortable so the hoodie stays and so does the facemask. While he was checking himself, the group began to move, following someone dwarfed by the dicks. He follows the group into another room while debating with yellow.
He was however, surprised to see one Princess of Wakanda talking to one of the scientists.  There was a lot of hand gestures and she looked really excited,  Peter guessed that she was working on something they came up with that is more about being nerdy than function. Or she's updating her brother's suit to go nya every time he transforms, it could be ether.
: *side note, I've only heard her for ten minutes but i love her*
"One that involves time travel, aliens, Rouge Hydra agents and even more aliens." the robot replied before Peggy could ask.
"So class I hope you remember that we have our annual surprise Field trip tomorrow."
QueenElsa @gold
"Also! I wanted to show you the specks for your new suit. Let's go to the lab" Tony grabbed his hand and pulled him along.
: nedddddy ned!!!?
: not so much as work under him as is his personal intern.
"That wont happen when You're away from him will it? "
MJ shruggs, " It wouldn’t be too big of a loss."
But Tony wasn’t there right now so he digresses.
"You shouldn't have touched my precious star." he says as he begins breaking her toes.
"No he does not. And you kid, Flash, don't come into the tower after this tour again" Tony says.
Steve looked at Tony.
Tony smirks,
Sam, who was beside Clint looked at him disapprovingly.
"Uh, it’s a tour sir. From Midtown. " Betty stepped forward.  Closer to them so the group probably didn’t hear their conversation.
"Well, well, well, looks like Parker's big lie about his internship is about to be busted." Flash called out getting a few snickers from his 'friends' and an eyeroll from Ned,
His super strength and spider sense is the only reason why he didn't topple over when someone pounced at him with a cry of,
Peter finished just as he heard the noise of a quinjet engine on top of the building,  oh so that was the engine he heard.
: well the announcement is Elanor and I are dating now.
Peter raised an eyebrow incredulously.
The girls exchange a look at the name, who names their child Fishlegs.  The man nods and smiles towards them,
Peter looked around to see all of them in various state of in pain or unconscious. Huh, maybe he didn’t need to press the panic button after all.
: Peter had Ned hack the AI.
"His teacher? Is something wrong? Did they try to contact me?"
"So you are under the arctic now?"
See how she knows them, that proves further that She. Does. Not. Need. A. Tour. Here.
Steve rubbed a hand on his shoulder,
In our defence he's a lot like us, so obviously he's hard to not get a heart attack from.
"Really son? and why is he a whimp?" Steve questioned and no one noticed Tony and Bucky grab Mr. Shuu to have a talk with him a bit further away.
Tony texted the others, all of them were on their way. That teacher was about to pay.
Watching the internet having a breakdown over Stony while I know what's up
"Yeah, the Prince , the King and the Royal consort." Thor's brain screeched to a halt.
"Hey Dad, pops, I was looking for you, about the gaming system upgrade, and I thought we could......  Why are you looking at me like that?"
"You could get to know me" dhe practically leered.  And Peter narrowed his eyes,
: Michelle wasn't kidding with the loving boyfriend juice.
"Pffft you think I put that much effort in her? Now go on smooch your boyfriend. "
"we have a meeting with Peter's principal tomorrow babe, keep your schedule clear." Steve merely nodded.
"Ok, but who are you? I didn't really catch your name " he says pointing at the short man with a goatee.
"You know my pointy sticks are probably getting ichy, I should do something about that. " he says thoughtfully.
Bruce was brought in the group hug when Peter grabbed him and made him join.
"Aren’t you a judge? I'm pretty sure judges aren’t allowed to help the students." Peter reminded.
@jBarnes Is this crush who I think it is?
On a completely unrelated note, MJ was now ten dollars richer.
"Great, I need you to not kill Flash for me OK man?"
He hoped his dad was alone in a room and didn’t call anyone else. But well, he also hoped his dad wouldn’t blow a gasked so clearly he was hoping for too much.
"Aunt Natasha came to you for the ballet thing."
Asdfghjkl I'm sorry. But also really, how long do you think things would be hidden?
"Adopted?  Why?  Peter it's unethical to lie to get out of a troubling situation. "
Clint mumbled something like
"And then I told him that my aunts insisted on the clothes and dad got me the phone. He apparently didn't believe I got adopted. " Peter paused as he took the book out of his locker and glanced at Ned, his best friend was paying Rapt attention to what he was saying.
"So what's on the training agenda today?" Peter asks s
: Pete buddy, I'm all for it. But i have to agree, that is the sappiest thing I've read in my life.
"S-sole - sole heir?" Flash squeaks.
How do I delete someone else's twitter handle
Granted it wasn't the most healthy way of dealing with stuff, but they liked to meet up in the sparring room and beat the absolute crap out of each other from time to time. Or as Steve liked to call it, Sparring.
................. That was a good prank, MJ still has the footage from Natasha throwing knives at Wade)
Ned  snickered and Peter frowned at Flash. Ned scanned his pass with a quiet greeting and told Friday why they were there.  Peter scanned his next,
"Betty?" he mouthed back subly inclining his head towards the girl in question . Cindy grinned and nodded.
He looked at the assailant and had to stop from recoiling. He had never in all his years that he knew the boy has seen Flash Thompson so pale and ashen.
a card but between having to hand it over since he was banned and not banned and the sneaking in and running for his life (being chased by certain repulsor wearing people) time to time, at this point F.R.I.D.A.Y just has him scanned by biometrics and informs him whether he's banned currently  since no one could be bothered remembering if he should have the badge currently or not.
Mr. Shuu nervously herded the children, "come on kids, tour is over." he gathered them all when Sam called out,
: dear classmates,
The bus arrived at the tower. Ned counted down the last moments his classmates still thought that the Avengers were cool.
"Pete! You didn't say you had a tour here." Bruce wondered.
"Where? "
"Did I tell you our school has this one major field trip to some place that is famous for some kind of scientific endeavour or another, and everyone gets Super pumped to go there? You know the last one was cancelled and the one before that was where I got bit by the spider?" Peter paused and Steve nodded.
The rest of the class was too excited to notice Ned's worried face or MJ's amused one. (Just like no one knew that she texted Clint that morning while on the bus)
Betty nodded dazed.
"Why are you antagonizing my sister? "
: *screenshot of Wade's first three texts*
Petey leads them to the cafeteria about an hour into the tour citing a small break for snacks. He shows them to a table then heads off to get his own food.
Steve grinned at him and Tony looked at them bashfully,
"Yeah, I know I just.... never mind can I go now? I'm tired. " He asked and was met by Steve's nod. Tony, looked up from whatever he was doing on his phone and gave Peter a reassuring smile,
ঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁঁ
Honestly not even surprised that Tony Stark adopted Peter parker, I would too.
: yeah. Cool. Cool coolcoolcoolcool.
"Do you think Stony is canon?"
Should I?
"Not yet. But when you do, that child will me mine, body mind and soul."
Steve frowned, brought his hands on Tony's shoulders and squeezed lightly.  Howard had always been a sore subject. It seemed to be a mistake at his point though.
(Image of Peter excitedly pointing at something)
He smiles again as the plane crashes, "I'll be with you soon my Star." he murmurs as the water drowns the Valkyrie.
Shuri didn't even look at the kid, instead focusing her glare at flash.
a lady from a charity event
"Kinda, if it helps, Betty has no idea."
"Ned My dad has a mechanized Suit Of Armour. My other dad is the paragon of American Hopes and Dreams." He whisper yelled.
"Hey Peter, did you hear anything about the new student? " Ned asked.
"Ok, I'm not someone who would stop you from showing off, but It's not really your style. " Tony says in that tone he uses when he means, i want to know what's going on with your life, but I'm not gonna push you about it.
"Oh, and Miss-? we'll  be having a talk with the principal about you misgendering Peter. We wouldn't want to harass a child now would we?" Steve smirked at her.
"Congratulations on getting Peter's adoption public MJ. How many magazine did you go to?" Betty congratulates her when the superhusbands leave and the class has a few minutes to walk by themselves.
®®®®®®®®®®®®®®©
: dude just quit while you're ahead.
So I looked through some of the records of that Eugene kid.
The next day Peter woke up and his first thought was "holy shit I'm late for school."
He thought for a while and decided on gym, his pops is probably putting the team through their paces again.
: babyboy you're gonna give me a heart attack with that.
He looks around just in time to see Ned bounding towards him with a gleeful Wade and smirking MJ in tow
"sure why not?"
×××××××××××××××××××✗
"As he was saying, Peter was Tony's intern before we adopted him, he still works on the company, but he's more of a trainee to Tony than an intern. " Steve finishes. Pointedly staring at Flash.
" 'Ello, girls! Excited about your first day?" she beams at them, her 's' softens to to a hard z.
But still, even though she had actually been here before, the building always left her in...... A sort of awe. Betty to her right had the same reaction.
The class, except for Ned, was too starstruck to reply. Ned smiled at her bashfully. It didn't look like she minded or saw.
"Flash, do you not ever get tired of hearing your own voice, I know everyone else already has" MJ replies in a monotonous voice not looking up from her book.
Said person didn't notice him yet. Which was good as Peter slowly sneaked behind him. He could just tap his shoulder or something and not make a scene. But the entire day has been dramatic for him anyway so he promptly full body tackles the other boy.
: dmdkkfksmsndjdj
"Oh, you guys are Peteypie's class!" he exlaims.
"Ok, It's in two weeks, let the lovebirds know" she says and cut the call.
Bruce cuts in, "It's fine, Brunnhilde. What happened though? I didn't think I would be included in Asgardian stuff"
"How did he even lose the page?" Bucky questions from where he's flicking through channels on the TV.
"You’re at the reception right? Wait there we're coming now. " he heard from Uncle Bruce and yikes everyone really is coming.
"We usually hold press conferences in the third floor, but there's nothing to be announced today, so it has been cleared for you guys. You will find that those who put their names forward for the fair already has a designated stall with their name on it. You have to set up shop however you need to in your stall."
And to think that he was actually excited for the science fair this year.
"Peter! it's refreshing to see you use the front door every once in a while. " Friday quipped and Peter blushed slightly at Alfred and his friends snickering. Ms. Terry however has been going slightly more red each minute of the ordeal.
"Eugene Thompson. guest" Friday's voice rang through the speakers.
"PETER!!!"
That was a punch to the guts,
"Yes, glad you know me, but why are you calling Ned names you son of a trash can?" MJ raised an eyebrow.
What happened?  Who pissed him off?
"Nothing serious huh?" Bucky mumbled, then proceeded to mumble darkly in Russian.
"Uh, yeah- yeah Mr. Stewart ,  I'm not sure what you mean though?" which is a lie. He knows exactly  what the other man  means he just refuses to acknowledge the fact that his teacher would insinuate
"That's because Peter's right and you're both dense as concrete. " Natasha input and Peter nodded along.
"I'm their mechanic." he shrugged.  But rest seemed to be unsatisfied at his answer.
: sure.
: also I'm in love with love.
"I mean, his hair looks golden enough, he's a morning person, his eyes look like the sky so he obviously has some reverse sky and sun art thing going"
"Hey Fri? Are there any Avengers in one of the gyms?" he asks
হহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহ
"Friday, why didn't you wake me up?"
so the enfing was terrible, but that's all I have
×××××××××××××××✗
: welllllll his name is Wade.
: lol no.
"It was my Tony notebook.  There was no wrong page" comes muffled from the pillow.
_____
"It's in the middle of nowhere,  and we barely take vacations,  what are you going to do with it?"
"Alright, kids, remember to behave, and don't give any of the staff any trouble." Ms Terry was going through the usual talk about keeping a good image of Midtown high that all of them are going to ignore anyway. Ms. Terry was, as usual ignoring everything Flash was saying to Peter.
As Sara tried to heard the group towards the elevator they saw a man staring up at a vent opening and yelling at it. The group looked at the man incredulously. Peter knew who he was and exactly what was happening , well... Not exactly, but he thinks he knows the gist of it. The man sees the group and catches Peter's eye,
"Probably the school smoozing up to some capitalist asshole or something. I heard they're only staying for a month." MJ said nonchalantly.
"mini boss you have to go take the stage, boss is running late." Friday informed him and the boy groaned,
He bites his lip and looks at Bruce intently hoping his eyes would convey what words could not.
The man's eyes focus on Ned when the rest of the class is too busy mumbling "Holy shit that's Bruce flipping Banner."
"Your crush on Peter......  I Don't think It's gonna go anywhere." Flash reeled back, he didnt think he was that obvious.
We love you kid
Love how they're behaving like this is normal
: Nat and I are going.
Can this tour get any worse?
"Oh right, you didn't come in yesterday. Mr. Warren said that we're getting a new student, something about the student being really special."
: what is it this time?
"Cindy! Dont scare me like that! And.... Oh boy..... Please tell me Flash didn’t say anything stupid " he says as he takes in the class then both his fathers faces, then looks at his class again.
she looked up to see the group and got a confused look on her face, the scientist with her explained that tour groups could go to this lab and she nodded in understanding.
he was not fine he wanted to go to his room, maybe cuddle up with Wade or make some updates with his dad, work out with pops. But no, he was stuck on this stupid field trip with a taunting Flash and Ms. Terry who has not stopped giving him the evil eye after setting foot in the building.
"I can't just go up to him and ask,  Hey Tony is there any chance you might like fellas?" Steve says in a high falsetto voice.
Sure he had MJ, bur the girl could care less about Lego or star wars... it's just not the same without Peter. Besides what's a guy in the chair to do without his spiderman? (the "wait for you to come back" meme comes to his head, he quickly dismisses it.)
The rest of the meet and greet went somewhat smoothly. Flash didn't make a single peep, Ned and MJ stayed back saying that they have work to do, but really they're just getting some stuff done while Peter sleeps so they could hang out when he wakes.
"Then how come Peter can hold you back in the chair?"
: I usually do. I'm just curious why he cares so much.
Now see here's the thing, Peter learned how to lie better to try to hide his identity to anyone but hos family, but this is Natasha, you can't  just go and lie to the Black Widow. it's not even about morals, you literally can't lie to her.
She let out a beep as she found the dummy and immediately began her work.
"Hello, Ned, I did not expect you here so early" FRIDAY's voice turned from bored to interested.
"What.  No I! "
"Have you seen the guide? He looks dreamy doesn't he?" One of them mentioned from behind him.
®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®
××××××××××××××××××××××××
"Might as well congratulate Cin while you're at it She's working here too." Did Cindy mention that her best friend is a traitor? Because Betty Brant is up there with historical figures when it comes to being a traitor.
"Hi Peter,  your life is doomed anyway,  now are you putting Mary in or not" MJ says not looking up from her skech, which looked suspiciously like Flash in a guillotine.
®®®®®®®®®®®®®®
Fuck no.
After breakfast, he went to the entrance to get Shuri, and maybe get some nerd out done before she gets to the scorpions.
"Would you like to continue breathing Peter?" she asks calmly
*Later*
"Well, no. I tested her in a lab, but haven’t gotten out to the field yet. But I do have plans to finish all the functions by a few months, so I'll be taking her out then."
The guy@chairboi
: yanno everytime you guys are gonna go quiet from now on I'm just gonna assume there's something happening.
: ned????
"I don't see him talking his way out of that situation without a.... What did Peter call it? Boyfriend at the very least."
: betty, boo, that doesn't work the same on text
"Yes his fanboying is quite endearing." Thor chukled and gulped the water down.
After he left though, Flash found his voice,
"That's science bro stuff and it doesn’t make me a mom. "
"It's Friday, go take a nap, and I swear I'll get back to you on this" Dr. Banner nodded and stalked out of the room, hopeful to his room to sleep. Ned, pointedly ignored all of his classmates who were (very unsubtly) pointing at him and whispering.
The goons seems to be distracted which is good for his plan to try to wait till the Avengers get there, and not get shot at.
Just before they reached the Floor 15 a frazzled looking  young man got in the elevator. He took up...  A bit more space than normal, he looked friendly enough though.
"Oh! Do I know her? Is that why you're hiding the book?"
: chewout of the century.
: where is the Tour?
He had switched it off yesterday after getting so many calls then forgot to turn it on this morning when he started to work on some of Clint's new arrows.
"Was the other boy who spoke up during the call? "
It seemed that Ms. Potts wanted him to start in the buiseness part of SI.
"Well if you must know, I have a plan to ask him out, it'll take some time but I have a plan" he says and definitely does not stick his tounge out thank you very much. (For the record, hypothetically, if he did, Nat and Bucky would deserve it ok?)
: is that a sword at his throat?
"ALRIGHT KIDS lets get this tour on the road.!!! First stop is R&D lab no.44!!"
: guys?
"I'm his intern?" Peter says, but it comes more as a question.
"Are they coming?" Officer pennington asks in a tone that implies that if they weren’t she'd drive him herself and give his parents a piece of her mind while She's at it. She was great to work with on the domestic abuse cases. But fortunately he doesn’t need her help in this particular case.
"-So, what do you say Peter? " she smiled at him all warm and sunny.
As soon as she heard that their group was going to the surprise  Field trip immediately made an excuse to the
: so you can imagine how mad Tony Rogers-Stark was to hear what made his personal intern panic this much.
:And don't get MJ. He tried to talk but it wasn't too bad.
First of all how dare you?
"The tour was today? I thought it was yesterday? " Peter asked Ned.
"Woah, man calm down, just me." Ned says wide eyed.
Betty hid her face in her hand, "I said neat" she whined quietly after they left.
×××××××××××××××××××✗
"He is in the tower more often than not, why would I not know him?" he says.
"- how does that work?? I may be the only human in the Avenger scientist  but I'm still a friggin avenger! How the hell did those mines be enough of an incentive to take a risk like that! And not to mention you basically handed me a way out and expect me to what? Stay put? What kind of dumbass logic-"
"Dad, dad come on It's fine I'm not even hurt! "
"Ok, for just this once I'll concede to being dense."
Tony looked at Steve.
The exhibit was of course exciting. everyone was mumbling about how cool some of the exhibits are. Peter took the time to meet up with his friends.
"SHURI COME ON!!"
The bell ringing comes as a blessing, He rushed out of the class and joins Ned near the lockers.
: a blessing.
"Wade! These are my friends Ned And MJ." Peter introduced. MJ looked up at Deadpool with narrowed eyes, and Ned poked him to make sure he is real.
"WHAT DOES SHE MEAN NOT USE THE FRONT DOOR? DO YOU SNEAK IN THE TOWER PENIS?!?? IS THAT WHY SHE KNOWS YOU?"
Some thing like this has been going on for the last three days, Peter has gotten a total of.... 5? no 6 hours of sleep in the last three days, needless to say he doesn't appreciate Mr. Tritter going on and on about the periodic table.
"Holy shit is that the Hulk?" Eleanor says. Betty frowns and looks behind her to see Dr. Odinson-Banner talking to a few scientists.
Peter tuned out everything else knowing that his family was watching intensely and this training was mostly for him to be able to focus all his attention despite the vibrations coming from all directions.
They probably didn’t what to hurt your feelings. I was feeling too tied down.
Ned scoffed, misbehaviour won't be excused? Did they not ever hear about the Avengers? Ned still gets flashbacks from their Avengers paintball war, and he wasn't even a part of the game.
The downside to travelling with a billionaire bestfriend, especially Tony Stark is that the man is -pardon his language - a nosy fuck.
"You should, ha ha,  you should tell them now since They're gonna figure it out anyway. " MJ choked out before laughing again.
: you get what you get.
Love you boo
"Its not your fault, Tony." Steve reassured noticing his guilt about signing the permission slip.
So an absolutely terrible accident happened with the shield today. Somehow the Captain's hand slipped and the shield broke all the anti-homeless spikes on the sidewalks closer to SI. Truly a wonder of nature and physics.
When he reached his locker along with MJ hoping to catch Ned, he didn't find him. They decided to wait for him since they had the next class together.
"Oh, great you know, Had fun in physics, got to work on some stuff in chem lab, tasted complete and utter bitter taste of  betrayal when I  was in English. " he says faux casually.
Peter sighs and shakes his head looks towards his teacher pleadingly who is currently slightly pale faced and visibly shaken.
Just as he thought he was out of the woods, two arguing  voices coming towards them made Peter want to groan, why them? Why now? He almost made it out without spilling his secrets!
"Of course boss." the holograms disappear and Peter refuses to look at any of his peers and goes to his seat after taking his phone.
So Peter had to hold them off for at least that long without giving up his identity.  Ok, he can do this.
@ Foley you will not believe how cute he is, I just wanted to stuff him in my pocket and take him home with me.
"Why though?" Tony pouted and dear god, why does this man keep getting cuter?
Howard however  was oblivious to the underlying threat that laced her words.
"He took my phone to call my dads to talk to them. He called Pops and when he went to the lab with Aunt 'tasha they all laughed. "
"Yes ma'am "
It seemed their banter had cut Flash from his stupor and he regained his speech,
When they got close to the room Peter heard people inside, which is weird. No one really uses this training room, the number of people who actually work out in the building is scarce, limited to the Avengers and some shield people when they come in, but even then they use the rooms closer to the living quarters.  why would anyone be at a training room far from where it's convenient?
"I have heard that you are bringing your lunch even though you didn't used to before "
Okay , so maybe he did have a crush on Bruce.
The fight was brutal, he inevitably had to call in the avengers, apparently giant robot scorpions that comes in hundreds calls for an assemble, go figure.
He's a total puppy for his boyf.
×××××××××××××××××××✗
"DAAAAD!!" Peter whined indignantly.
®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®
"Apparently he was supposed to go to this big field trip, and Tony  signed the permission slip. His teacher didn't believe him, and now he has detention for forgery."
And he is healed completely, he has super healing thank you very much, but super healing does absolutely nothing to prevent the overdrive of senses always out to get him. He hopes that he would be able to have a mostly quiet day.
"Only officially. " the robot? robo man? waved a hand.
"Is that why you said Peter is an intern? To take the light off You and MJ?" Mr. Leroy asks curiously.
Sure jan.  Gif
Peter looked at Ned who shrugged helplessly back, you don't mess with a princess in warpath, especially if the princess in question is an expert in weapons technology.
: when he comes back from his trip? Northern Westchester.
Peter looked up to see he had one Princess of Wakanda on his back hugging him. his eyes grew large as saucers.
হহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহ
Peter snorted, "He's allowed in.....for now, I don't know how long till dad has another blow up about him." Ned nods in understanding the two exist the school where Ned goes home and Peter gets in the car with Happy. Peter started chattering and the man rolled his eyes, the kid may or may not have grown on him, but he's not gonna tell him that.
×××××××××××××××××××✗
"Phew. Thank god! I'm so glad she doesn’t know."
Tony leave them alone, he didn’t even break anything.
Ok, but question,  who is your favourite person in the tower @ IAmFe?
"And I'm free to kill this Flash fucker. " Deadpool announces speed walking towards the door.
The creature was gone when he woke up.
"Thanks uncle Bruce! "
Mr stark : I'm thinking about adopting a child.
"Peter the Van." his Pops sounded tense.
Ned pats him on the back, "maybe You'll find someone else." he says gently and Flash nods, maybe he will, someday.
They walked to the door only to find Eleanor  all over Peter's personal space. The boy looked extremely uncomfortable.
: Congrats guys!
* sipping tea gif *
The woman looked terrified when he was peeling her skin off. She hurt a lot too if her screams were anything to go by. He couldn't remember her name, Crissy? Kaitlyn? Cristene? That must be it.
"I did not know that. Huh, well look at that, Howard really didn’t know what he was talking about to slutty teenage Tony huh? " he laughed bitterly.
He was frozen for a different reason though, next to the stove, a young man clad in red and black was whistling to a tune and flipping pancakes.
: smh boy let other people help you!!!!
"You must be the group from Midtown high, Welcome to Stark Industries, or better known as Avengers tower. My name is Maddie and I will be your tour guide today. " she finishes as brightly as she started.
Steve is a great cook who wants Peter to eat more with his enhanced metabolism, Why would he complain?
Want to help me ruin his life?
Rhody snorted.
Also, guess who else saw him with his shirt up today?
"Uh huh -" Tony looked at Eleanor over his sunglasses " And who do you suppose the kid is?"
: the interns have labs??????
"But what about not telling the public thing? What if someone finds out that you adopted me? "
"Hello Peter, are you on the Field trip as well?"
Mr. Yelli got up and tried throwing a punch at Peter who caught it and yanked him throwing him back at his goons using his own weight.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BETTY'S HERE??!!
®®®®®®®®®®®®
"You do seem to be starting to have one of your sensory overload migraines,perhaps it would be benefactory to wear your glasses and earplugs?" Vision suggested.
"Well, don't you need a crapton of snacks anyway?" Tony says and Peter grinned, his father got like this when he was really close to finishing a project, he most likely is finishing one now, which means extra time with him when he does.
: cause I have MJ with me and she will fight.
You have way too many pictures of me.
"You two have been talking a lot."
His fathers were in the kitchen together, Steve drawing something and Tony nursing what looked like his first mug of coffee of the day. Wanda was munching on an apple. Clint was having a discussion with Bucky and Rhody.
"Alright, I'll spar with Bucky first, then.... Peter and Clint and Sam will be testing out Peter's reflexes again with NON lethal arrows.  and then....." Steve finished listing off sparring partners.
হহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহ
Dou you need this back or can I keep it?
Let's go!
: And thanks Abe. I wasn't really in the closet but I'm not super flashy either.
" you somehow got some Wakandian knockoff accessories -"
OK listen, Peter was pretty sure the guy he was caught talking to in front of the school wasn't a drug dealer. He's just one of Wade's friends and granted all of his boyfriend's friends are shady looking but that does not mean they're all criminals. And Wade usually makes friends with the less evil people.
Peggy frowned hearing her friend. She looked towards the people from the future to see them all frown at Howard too.... Bar Tony whose only reaction is an eye roll and a sigh.
Flashback#1
"I mean, Anthony is not smart enough to be a meaningful member to any team Steve is in." he waves a hand towards the Super solder in question.
"You know, you're probably the only one who'd end up with your problems kid." Clint shook his head, "Well gotta get going, I'm gonna have a meet up with Nat." He paused then glanced at Flash before turning to him again, "Don't think the paternal units aren't going to here about this."
"He's Rogers-Stark Thompson, or did you forget the wedding that was on nearly every media?" It was amazing how MJ could control the flow of the conversation and change the subject without anyone noticing, Ned sometimes wished he and Peter had that power.
Before he could answer however, he heard rapid footsteps approaching towards him.
"You weRE WRITING A SOFTWARE CODE!"
: so, classmates, me and Eleanor have an announcement.
"I just had to fall for the unattainable guy, anything else just wasn’t enough for my stupid life. "
Shut up Paulina
"Hey, Pete, could you help me out while you're going down anyway? I need doritos, not your pops kind. Garb me some if you're gonna get down all the floors anyway." his dad said. Peter nodded.
Flash nodded so fast Ned thought he was going to get whiplash.
There was a pause where Tony mulled over what Peter said.  He wasn’t team mom no matter what Clint says, which reminds him, he needed to add oreos to the grocery list or there would probably be bloodshed and..........
"Uh... Y -yes sir, him. It's - uh its him." Eleanor stammers.
Sleep is something Tony Stark believes happens to other people.
Seemed like Mr. Thompson wasn’t as enamoured with his parents like the rest of the class beacuse he had only about a second of warning from his spider sense before his collar was grabbed.
............  FML
It all started in breakfast. Shuri has been complaining all week that she gets bored when she visits and Peter has to go to school so he can't hang out with her.
"That's logical. No one would want a repeat of this, especially since a teacher thought he could just harass you in the middle of class. " She said thoughtfully and Ned nodded in agreement.
"Go on, we'll update boyfriend undead for you"
"I told you guys before, all of you guys are the same level of great."
: *sure jan gif*
"Yeah yup totally, rivals. Flash and me rivals since middle school. " Peter felt that sometimes he should just sew his mouth shut. That was the worst attempt at lying and he was talking to the Black widow for Christ's sake!
: Shuri would have left with meeting otherwise.
And the rest just follow his example, so when Tyler took a look at Wade's scarred AF face and when he announced he was pan as his fun fact at the beginning, he decided he found the perfect punching bag. And since Wade was supposed to keep his head down, he did not in fact bathe in his blood. Really. The things he does for love.
"Calm down, he called to talk about........  Some..... rumours at Pete's school. " Peter could hear the grin in his voice.
"Yeah?"
First off, sniches get stitches Keener
But before Flash could reply something, someone from the crowd (and when had that gathered? come on super senses, what are you doing) yelled out,
"Alright, let's kick some villain butt" Peter says determinedly.
"You can't do that!" Ms. Terry exclaimed.
Tony grimaces. Ok, yeah fair.
××××××××××××××××××××
"pleaaaase"
++++++++++++++++++++++‡
Flash was by no means a rival in any meaning of the word but Peter was willing to take what he would get.
"Babyboy?  You mean Peter? Why-" the knife embedded itself near her foot on the floor.
Besides,
" I mean.... Is it?" MJ wonders aloud.
The young boy whispered to the Blue eyed blond man,
"Something You'll find out soon enough!" Cindy smirked at the other boy. Ah she wanted to see the look on his face when he realises who he was bullying.
"What? Suddenly grew some balls Parker? Since when do you talk back to me?"
"Please tell me no one kissed me." Steve smirked inwards. 'Oh, star, there would be so much more later' He thought.
@ DeadlySpider  # Irondad?
Thankfully they didn’t have any other interruptions. And the tour was actually pretty enjoyable, and they went to some parts of the buildings Cindy didn’t go to often, so she realised what happens there.

"Excuse me he does what?" Wade asks calmly.
"Well, I haven’t gotten her all the way where I wanted her yet, but, as of now, she can take out bullets, provide stiches, stabalise stab wounds and carry up to 400 pounds for four hours running."
"I didn't know either, turns out they sent an email to my parents, who didn't even tell me I had a field trip." Peter was not pouting goddamnit.
@ Potts
:  so that's how he got the internship?
However Peter thought it was a little bit of a overreaction to give him an entire month of detention for forgery that he didn't commit.
Thankfully no one notices his lack of card too busy wracking their  brains about the projects, and barely being awake.

"Why does this give off so much.... I don't give a fuck vibes?" she whispered at Betty. "He's like sunshine personafied in real life."
And his dad....... He does not want to feed his ego, but he always looks ready for a photoshoot.
"Uh, no, I do not encourage teenage vigilantism, I only help because the teenage vigilantly would go off by himself if I don't help him."
Yeah why the fuck would he do that?

"HOW DARE YOU COMPARE ME TO THAT WORTHLESS -" Howard never got to finish what he was about to say because he was punched in the jaw by a -frankly terrifying looking- Steve Rogers.
"But..."
"Alright alright, I won't. You finished with the notes?" Tony changes the subject. Peter eyes him carefully before he answers,
: and i mean. Fair. Wade really is unreal sometimes. I can't believe I'm dating him.
This is surprisingly wholesome.
"What about the windows?" she frowns, looking out, then suddenly her eyes widen as she sees something out the window.
"Peter, Alice seems to be coming back, would you like to go upstairs with the team?" Friday asked and the rest of the team looked towards him expectantly,
"You, got a detention?  you?" Clint asked incredulously.
"Your presentation skills needs work, does Pepper know?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Thor tilts his head like a puppy.
"Uncle Thor comes to you for dating advice. "

Maybe he was getting too used to deal with shady people who are actually nice while hanging out with Wade. But really how was he supposed to know that those guys weren’t the nice kind of shady people?
I AM NOT CUTE!!!
His friends and boyfriend exchange a look,
"PETER STOP PROTECTING THAT ASSHOLE. HE NEEDS TO GET OUT OF THE TOWER THIS INSTANT.!!!!"
"What floor is the gym at?" Peter questions curiously.
"Well, play it. What does the princess need?"
Peter debated whether it was worth it to just wither away in bed and sleep the rest of his life, but decided against it. He groaned.
The avengers that were in the room made eye contact and simultaneously made their way towards the elevator.
"Uhhhh.... " he hesitated.
"He does? That's -um neat!"
"Dude, you, Ned and Shuri sang 'Kiss the Wade' every time I entered a room with you in it for a month, do not expect any sympathy from me" Peter crossed his arms with an air of finality, MJ had her face behind a book, Peter thought she was trying to stop from laughing out loud.

"Son, I Better not hear that you've been bullying my son again, I don't like bullies" Steve growled. Peter was pretty sure Flash peed himself a little.
"but hey! look at the bright side, I don't have to go to school tomorrow! " Peter tried to sound upbeat.
হহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহ
Ned is actually secretly devious,  who knew?
Hey Peter, the Jet is landing now, we're coming soon.
Fishlegs just smiles like he gets that a lot, judging from his name, he probably does, Betty steps off the elevator with him and Cindy stays back with Francine
Who saw?
Steve always thought Howard was a fool.
What is a gender? How do you only get attracted to only one?
"What? Oh, god,I need to have a talk about those." Peter's mood was brightened considerably by the time he got up and left to work on the lab. He didn't notice Tony and Natasha walk in the room just as he left but Steve did.
she usually didn't just go and investigate every single little thing, but something about the whole fiasco strikes her as odd, (other than the whole appearing in a giant glow of light thing.) That and there's only so many papers she could read about how Howard is just this closer to finding Steve.
There was a hint of rage in Flash's eyes,
Are you shading Flash?
Peter sighes and from where he is next to him, Steve notices, "Hey, Pete, what's up? You've been quiet for a while." Steve points out using what some of the less mature avengers has named his Concerned Mother™ voice. (the more mature Avengers don't call it that at all. What are you talking about? Shut up Clint.)
"Good, you two are meeting me in a training room after this, I finished making them, and I need to test it out."
"Who did what?"Betty frowned.
"Really? " Natasha asked unconvinced.
হহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহ
"We- that's - we're not!"
It doesn't even take ten minutes for people to start recognizing him, normally, Peter doesn't have work in the levels lower than 50. Heck, he barely walks in through the front doors! When he does go lower however, he's usually in a frenzy. So he can't be blamed if he doesn't recognize half of the people who are smiling at him right?
He turns the corner and considers the door he closed on his way out, maybe he'll talk to them tomorrow, though he did have to collect his winnings from the birdman.
"Sure did. Now, You . Thor. spill."
: you jealous that I am in a relationship before you?
Thor is a very mature person and therefore he stuck his toung out.
That is the most Peter heard his teacher say in the entire time he has known the man.
"Listen, whatever your name is, even if you really did adopt Peter, don't encourage his lie about the internship at Stark industries. " Mr. Stewart sighed.
"Hey yourself." his voice was wobbly and he was distantly aware of a Peter colored blur going towards his husband and clinging to him like a koala bear.
:shhhhhhhhhh.
They didn't talk about it later. If Ned and MJ thought that they shouldn't tell Peter about Flash's crush, he wouldn't press.
"Karen?" the phone lit up.
"That's uncle Clint he's really good with arrows.... like really good. he's  a S.H.I.E.L.D agent to we call him aunt tasha's murder twin. And uncle Rhody flies the war machine "
: seriously who the fuck asks to give a bj in the first meeting unless they're into you like that?

Cindy has been over the moon all day.
"The Avengers in the building seem to be gathered in gym room No. 462. Mini boss, would you like any particular workout requested? " she asks. Peter shakes his head.
"so what have you kids been seeing till now?" he asks and the students *coughflashcough* began to list off the labs they've been to. Mr. Lang, listened and shook his head,
"Great, bye, other people need to pay attention to Their own projects and stuff too" Tony says aloud to the room. Everyone jolts and turns back to what they were doing pretending that they were never listening in the first place.
"Uh, while I'm all for the don't bully Peter cause, why would Deadpool care?" Abe raised a hand.
It was a normal day in S.H.I.E.L.D  headquarters. Director Carter was signing some paper works, Howard Stark made another failed attempt at finding Captain America.
Maddie frowned,
He wasn’t cranky. What gave you that idea?

MJ pointed him to the office,
Before Peter could say anything, the bell rang and students poured out of the classes. Peter went to his locker grab his bag. His dads and aunt decided to wait near the car.
This was an intern lab? What was in the more higher up labs?
I miss your warm hugs. I miss your jokes. I miss your laugh. Just you in general babe.
: Peter.
______
Oh and how he would love to have a talk with the traffic police on the streets how do they not notice the car that has no freaking licence plate.
"Ms. Jones? She's her Intern. Well... Intern is a vague term she's like the sub manager of the marketing Department really, and my boss." She explained.
"Where The two sweet babies and the one who'll take over the world goes to?" Clint asks.
"That must have been quite a shock too. Why don't you wait here and Call your guardian, and they could pick you up. " she smiles kindly.
dropped her box. Tyler and dick no. 5 are looking at themselves and Peter and Wade in turns. Whispers break out from their table
"Aunt Peggy!" he whined.
Are ya'll getting it anyway?  Unfortunately, yes, yes you are
"Shouldn't spidey sense tell you about dangerous people near you?" He couldn't help but tease.
"Your pitch is gonna go to the upper levels to be accepted or rejected so I'd recommend making more than one . "
"And one of our interns did actually manage to get -" she stopped, swayed and then swooned promptly passing out. Wade only managed to catch her before she brained herself on the chair next to her. He laid her down on the floor carefully and looked at one of the interns who immediately left. Hopefully to get help and not just afraid of his face.
But he supposed it would really not help his case to say that he literally swings around New york looking for criminals so It's not that big of a shock.
"Nothing bad Miss Jones, just a new intern, she seems bright." Fishlegs says as he gives her a file to sign.
"Hey, uncle Clint, remember that talk we had about not killing minors with Aunt Nat the other day, it kinda works for everyone." Clint clenched his jaw, "And why- is this little shit talking to you in the first place?" He asked.
®®®®®®®®®®®®®®
Peter looked at the screen inhumanely intently.
His dad probably just wanted to arrived fashionably late, in Tony Rogers-Stark language,  it could mean after the judges enter.
"I have no idea what you're speaking of young sir."
"I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE!!"
(Ten minuts ago)
"WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU DOING HERE PENIS?!? YOU'RE NOT EVEN ON THE FIELD TRIP!!!" He screamed which was murder on Peter's sensitive hearing.
"He's more excited than normal today,  what gives?"
:yeah anyway he came to the tower after school yesterday and had a panic attack and passed out.
"Flash, literally no one else cares, can you trun the jealously down please, I can't hear Ms. Trinket over it." Cindy bit out.
"Please~ if anything I'm the  antihero, all scars and tragic backstory."
: drumrolls please
"I'll do both of those I think." Alice smiled. "Come on, I'll just take you to the group." Alice grabbed a  box of security passes and lead Peter towards the entrance.
"Oh we'll see something alright." Ned muttered, sullen.
His mind was currently running a mile a minute,  not thinking for ideas just......  Daydreaming.
"Hah! Lawsuit?  For what? Expressing my opinion? "
They sort of move to a corner and huddle as much as a no homo strictly homophobic bro and oh mah gawd get away from me losers teenagers can huddle. Wade, who has been shoved in the cornerist of the corner daydreams about his usual brand of babyboy.
"You sure did, come on tour guide, let's get on with the tour. " Cindy patted her best friend and the group left the lab.
Only after he said it did he realise that he maybe should not have pocked the bear.
He could see the moment Tony figured out what he wanted to say.
"Eleanor?....  Guys???? Oh uh Betty!  Hi - um what  are - what are you all doing here?" Ned's voice reached a new kind of high, Cindy was impressed actually.
"You're reminding me of Frithiof's banishment, and while I loved watching him suffer, you're getting on my nerves." Loki checks his nails and then smiles at Peter
"Your parents are fags?" he spit out.
Peter wondered how he had ended up so far down the rabbit hole. He should in no way let his teacher talk to his dad about him selling drugs,  especially in front of his entire class.
"Hey Leeds, where's your intern buddy now, too scared to show his face here?" Flash nudged for the umpteenth time that day. Ned sighed for the umpteenth time that day.
"No! Tony, in what conceivable reason would you need another Island? "
The avengers at the Gym. # blessedDay
"Wha- this is the tour group?" he croaks.
"Well, right then, some introductions would be nice." Peggy looked pointedly at Steve.  But it was 'Pete' who answered.
: wait her girlfriend is he
: 'and you think either Tony and I am afraid of Deadpool enough to let someone work close to us with no credentials?'
: what did he even see to make his face go all red like that?
He's a superhero because of what he built himself.
He was just about to relax when he -unfortunately- saw someone else walking towards him. Damn it why is Harrison Thompson walking towards his stall?
Even if just a little bit. Even if it was just a fraction of what Thor felt for him, he would fight for the man's heart.
******
: buddy…
××××××××××××××××××××✗
"Ned is my computer expert. He takes care of the coadings in the projects." The man shrugged.
"Good luck you two" Charlie says before they head towards the employee elevator.
"Peter! help me with this!" He called out and walked himself and Tony towards the table Peter was in.
There was definitely someone hyperventilating on the other side.
Ah, so that explains it, Amilia  and Alice used to have suffocating amounts of sexual tention, they got together Six months ago, that must be why she's so tense.
"I was thinking that he should be able to do CPR. An& add some oxygen valves to do mouth to mouth And her general mode is search and rescue, so she can't detect threats against herself yet, so, I'll have to work in that. And some basic first aids" Peter shrugs.
"I have my ways, but really though what happened with Mr. Steward? "
: why does it have to be a girlfriend?
Her words hit Peter like a punch to the gut. he hadn't been called Petra for years, he was Peter. He's a boy damn it why would she say that?  She left and probably took all the self confidence that took him months to build with her.
"I.... Had told him about a plan of mine, don't worry, you'll see soon enough."
It ended with Sam and Tony finding the mother scorpion and destroying it with the Hulk's help. None of them were in the mood to do any kind of cooking, which resulted in getting takeout on their way home, The owner of the Italian place they went to seemed a little shell shocked, but put their (huge) order through.
"Also provider of damage control " Natasha
"Flash!" the boy heard a call from a familiar voice. He turned around to see the other boy approach. Not knowing what to expect. Maybe Mr. Stark changed his mind and send him to tell him that?
There was six guys with guns, two of them were grabbing Bob, so they might have a late respond time, he was sitting close to a chair that he could grab but that would require getting free of the hand on his neck first.
"Then stop talking."
"No problem man, even I hate her."
Peter makes a face at his father.
The creature doesn't reply this time, merely smiles, the angelic quality to the smile makes him nauseous.
What is wrong with gym coaches everywhere anyway? Why are they so sadistic? What pleasure do they gain from torturing students like they do?
Who knew Iron man was such a dad
"Are you kidding me right now? What is in there? Oh, is it? Uh you like that person?" he asked his eyes dimmed for a second and huh..... Maybe he had a chance?
Dorrito @CapRogers
"Of course you’re not just going to walk home kid, you could get into more trouble and besides you just had to go through nearly being kidnapped. I'm not gonna let you just walk out right now without adult supervision! "
: wait nvm found him he's…
It wasn’t everyday the  Avengers landed a quinjet on top of a NYPD station and then proceed to rush down the stairs.
Tony gave her a winning grin,
"I can't come tomorrow man, dad and pops only let me come today cause of the history test. Tomorrow is rest day." Ned nodded understandingly.
Life as a superhero could be tough, even more so when you're a teenager,  especially if your name happens to be Peter Rogers-Stark.

Betty and Cindy rolled their eyes and gave up on saving her, she probably won't learn any other way.
"Uh.... Friday, what is going on?"
"Only a few more years My star. I love you very much." the creature whispered.
"WHAT THE FUCK PARKER?!?!" Flash screamed. That seemed to snap his attention towards the group standing at the training room entrance. The boy's eyes bugged out.
"Uhhh, yeah I do, he's dating Peter, I'm obligated to not like him."
In fact one could even say It's essencial. All the while he was also painfully aware that literally none of his family members would agree with him.
Wade for his part, looked at Flash forlornly as though not being able to kill him is a great dissatisfaction then waves goodbye to leave. he shared a curt nod with MJ, (They had this You Hurt Him I Hurt You And We Don't Interact Otherwise relationship).
"You can't steal him, he's with his class Shuri." Bruce said placatingly.
Peggy frowned she didn't know robots could be this advanced, or swear for that matter, but then the rest of them looked towards her and her eyebrows shot up.
Tony was working on his suit while wondering how long would Steve's workout session with Peter would last. He really wanted to work (hang out) with the kid.
******
@ C Giacometti he's actually the least chill, and the PSA's are a lie. He never followed a rule in his life.
: ha ha ha ha habahhaH
MJ was reading something on her phone most likely a book, Peter wasn't sure. Flash has been quiet since his initial outburst.  But Peter was pretty sure he would be back.
After leaving the Avengers exhibits, Peter asked Friday where the next stop is.
: what happened?
"Peggy Carter."
You were?? Wow!!!!
"Wha- buh- dea- Deadpool!" Betty pointed out helpfully  as though they couldn’t clearly see the tallest  person in the room.
Something gleams in Bucky's hand, a jagged piece of twisted metal. He swipes at Steve, once, twice and the third time proves to be the charm when Steve cries out as the weapon splits skin along his left forearm.
Once, in some morbid form of pillow talk, did Tony tell him what it felt like waking in that cave. Coming back with the weight of a magnet sitting on his lungs. About the pain, the taste of metal, how terror sat in his chest. He never wanted Tony to feel that again. Tony could be reckless, impulsive and careless with his life, but Steve held hope that the baby would keep Tony from doing anything until they could find him.
"There has to be something we're not seeing. All of the pieces are here, we're just not looking at them right."
Bucky lets out a mirthless laugh "They're worse."
Down the knife goes until its pressing against his belly "...and I would cut this blessing you don't deserve right out of you. But I won't. Your suffering won't be quick " Tony feels the panic attack coming. "We have to leave Captain Rogers with the idea that he can save you. As I told you before, you and your baby are safe, for now. I would like you to sit here and watch this.
He looks from the picture, to Tony's face then back at the picture and finally at Tony again. "You? You and me?"
“I know you don’t agree with me on all of this."
It’s hard but slow, and immediately erases all thoughts from his mind. Steve pulls him close and they stay in each other's embrace, Tony with his head resting on Steve's shoulder. Steve takes several breaths in and out. "I've wanted to do that since we got back, everything just got away from me." Steve pulls him in tighter.
The information Barnes gave him was another piece of the puzzle. It was vital and would unlock the most vital part. The empire would fall.
"So, the base is in Siberia? Do you remember how to get there." Steve takes a few steps back
“Didn’t you tell the US government to kiss your ass a couple of year ago?!” Sam counters
“How long before they lo-jack us like a bunch of common criminals?!!” Sam yells as he paces around the room.
Steve doesn’t say anything when they step off the quinjet under a pre-dawn sky, he barely even looks at Tony. Everyone looks defeated, no one more than Wanda. She heads to her room immediately with Vision on her heels, speaking words of comfort and reassurance. Sam heads to the roof with Rhodey by his side, arm slung around his shoulders. Natasha, he saw for a moment before she disappeared to her little nook, pointe shoes in hand.
"Okay so what are we missing."
“Tones? What is that in your hand?”
“You're assuming the worst, Sam. People died but you still figure what we do should be above some type of review. 117 countries want to sign this thing and your attitude is I'm cool!”
Steve gets involved, he doesn’t stay away, Barnes is in custody, but Secretary Ross and CIA Ross are out for blood. Sharon spares a glance at Tony, rolling her eyes as CIA Ross rants on that Steve, Sam and T’challa should be in cells next to Barnes. Tony stifles a chuckle at King T’challa’s looks unfazed glare. His eyes shift over to Barnes and the containment cell, if looks could kill…
Tony shakes his head "He's flying to London for the funeral. He'll meet us in Vienna. After we get it all straight with the accords, I'll make an omelet and tell him." He says to Rhodey. Natasha eyes them both but doesn’t press the issue.
Happiness falters quickly and for a moment Tony panics. Then he reminds him that if this were about Steve or the team, Rhodey wouldn’t tell him over the phone. As it stands, he’s been in his workshop all day and he hasn't heard a peep from anyone.
Secretary Ross is a formidable man, he’s also a grade A asshole and he's barely given them time to process the situation before he lists all the ways they've fucked up. A few times Steve turns back to look at him but Tony already knows they're going to be divided on this.
_ _ _
“I don’t think that right now…”
"What the going rate for watching the Avengers fall and killing Tony Stark on the world stage?" Sam asks aloud "Or selling him to whomever might wants him for the highest bidder"
“Run a check against all the intel we have on Barnes. Something doesn’t sit right. And Jarvis, be discreet.”
“Have you seen the news?” Rhodey’s voice is low and somber
“I made that kind of decision when I shut down weapons manufacturing.”
"What hospital are you taking him to?"
“You actually read all 2000 pages of this.” Steve sounds flabbergasted, not that he should be, Tony did become an expert in thermo-nuclear astrophysics overnight
Secretary Ross’ eyes darken. “She volunteered for Hydra, then took up with Ultron. I've had it on good authority that she is the one who set off the Hulk in Johannesburg. She has the power to mess with people’s minds and perceptions. Now she’s responsible for the deaths of one-hundred and two people in Lagos. To say she’s fortunate to have friends in high places is an understatement.” He looks at Tony as he says that last part. “She should never have been an Avenger and no country, much less the United States is going to grant a visa to a weapon of mass destruction that can’t decide where her allegiances are! If it weren’t for persuasive arguments she would be on the Raft at this moment.”
Steve doesn't want to push but he must. "People are dead. The bombing, the setup, the second bombing, he did all that just to get you in a room for 10 minutes. I need you to do better than I don't know."
“Ready to comply?”
"What?" Steve asks
"Hold on! Steve, can I talk to you for a second." Sam doesn't wait for an answer before pulling Steve into the corridor. "You wanna head into a death trap with him watching our six."
_ _ _
Their mystery man laughs "Already unraveling the mystery. I hoped the Winter Solder didn't break too many of you."
T’challa almost has the other wrist locked down when Barnes punches outward, catching Sharon in the chin and she falls back releasing his arm. Before Barnes can get a good grip on Natasha to throw her off Steve grabs his wrist and pins it to the floor.
"And your great plan with them is what?"
"You'll be there to see it because you're coming with us."
They both nod and follow her out. Secretary Ross has disappeared, but he won't have gone far.
"As I imagine losing you and this child will have a profound impact on Captain Rogers." The hand pressed down on the wound on his side, a small warning of things to come. "But first we have a trip to make."
T’challa paces back and forth across the conference room. “What’s to say Barnes and this other man aren’t working together.”
"We have to secure Bucky." Steve says it but part of him is screaming that he needs to be up there. He has no doubt that the others can handle themselves, but that knowledge does nothing to dissolve the worry circling in his gut. He takes one more forlorn look upward but moves down the stairs anyway. Tony told him and he was so happy, but he can’t let that cloud his judgment.
Steve stops short when they round the last corner. Rhodey is leaning against the van, staring at his watch. He looks up at then and cocks his head to the side. "Fifteen minutes. I'm disappointed. Especially with you." He looks pointedly at Nat
“Tony. Hold on." Paramedics and armed guards enter the command center. Natasha is still shaking as two medics help her stand and another two work to stabilize Tony “He needs an ultrasound, there's a baby”. Her own medics guide her to a chair nearby, but she doesn't take her eyes off Tony. His eyes are closed, and his breath is ragged.  She’s hoping for him to sit up and wave them off like he always does. They get him on a stretcher quickly and she waves off her own medics to follow.
"I didn't want to put you in a compromising position."
Steve grabs the fake doctor by the jacket and slams him against the nearest wall. “Who are you? What do you want?”
Steve pales a bit. "You tried to tell me at the compound. You tried, and I wasn’t listening."
Natasha and Sharon stand in the doorway.
"This is about Sokovia. You lost someone." Tony feels that familiar panic rising in his chest.
"Yes, sir. Colonel Rhodes."
Sharon and Natasha shoot one another a concerned look. The color drains out of Steve's face. Natasha pulls him to the side. "He's on his way to the hospital. He took a hit, got knocked around a good bit. Took some shrapnel to the abdomen. He told me about the baby. The paramedics had two heartbeats when they left."
“On the contrary, Captain. I’m speaking of causality. I’m saying the very existence of the Avengers invites challenge and oversight isn’t a notion that can be dismissed out of hand. As Mr. Stark said, we need boundaries or we’re no better than those that challenge us.”
He walks toward their little kitchen area. All eyes are on him and he busies himself arranging things while he gathers his thoughts. It’s hard to say so perhaps it’s better to show them. “That’s Charles Spencer. I met his mom a few days ago at MIT. Computer engineering, 3.7 GPA and a floor-level gig at Intel planned for the fall. He could have done anything, Vegas, Dubai, Amsterdam but he chose to put some miles on his soul before he parked behind a desk. He’s a great kid…or he was. He was in Sokovia building sustainable housing for the poor and we – I – dropped a building on him while I was kicking ass.
His phone buzzes; Steve's stoic but somehow frantic voice chimes in "Are you alright?"
A good hit sends T’challa staggering a bit and they lock eyes. She nods and he nods in understanding.
“The bodies in Lagos beg to differ!”
When Tony wakes this time its to grogginess and a splitting headache. He maneuvers himself into a sitting position slowly, the creak in the cot beneath him is almost deafening and only adds to the pain in his head. His legs almost fold the moment he tries to stand. The ground is freezing beneath his bare feet. His shirt sticks to him in places but his wounds have been cleaned, sutured and dressed. Fresh clothing has been laid out for him, all black complete with boots. Its just as well, the suit is done for. When he feels a little steadier, he undresses and redresses quickly because its freezing in here.
They find Steve alone in a dark office. Nat wants to reassure him that they'll find Tony, but it's been almost eight hours and they have nothing. No Tony, no leads and no way to track either.
"Where are you taking him?"
Christ! Steve hadn't considered that. Zemo wanted Tony dead but what if he decided it was soothing to his soul to sell Tony and the vast amounts of military knowledge he'd have. Not for the money but for the knowledge that his enemy would suffer.
Bodies are strewn all around, some moving and other some so still she knows what that means. Tony lies on his side a few feet from her. Not trusting her legs just yet, she crawls over to him. His face is covered in soot, there is a deep gash across his temple and there is a steady growing blood patch coming from his side.
Ross must have sensed they were getting too cozy and returns looking as stern as ever. “Decisions have to made, Captain Rogers.”
Sharon takes the lead. "We need to find out"
_ _ _
Barnes is on the offensive, tossing highly trained soldiers like rag dolls. Natasha pulls in closer to Sharon. “We need to get him down quick. If he gets the advantage, he’ll kill us both.” They are about to move when T’challa joins the fray, meeting Barnes blow for blow without missing a beat. Not that Natasha is surprised, from the moment they were introduced she got the impression he was a skilled as the rest of them.
"Just take what you came for and go." Tony whispers. He knows his mother is about to die, that he's about to witness the moment that altered the course of his life and still he silently wishes for a different outcome. Barnes sets his package down. "Please don't." He whispers as if they can hear him, as if it will change anything.
"Bomb went off in the west corridor, just outside the command center. Whoever planted it knew what they were doing" Sharon explains.
As Sharon had estimated the drugs couldn't keep Bucky down for long. His dark eyes track Steve as he steps closer and closer to the containment unit. Zemo said that Bucky might help him track down Tony, if that was the case it was time to see just how much Bucky knew.
He stands, nausea be damned. "Boy, you know me so well."
Rhodey raises her hands in surrender "No pep talk, I'm not even sure what I could say"
Tony can hear the bones in Howard's face shattering. Barnes lets the body fall, stares at it before hoisting it up and placing Howard back in the driver's seat. He moves to the back of the car. Stopping at the trunk he's there for a moment, simply searching for something.
“What the hell does that mean?” Sam says.
"It doesn’t make sense." Tony says aloud
“How long can you play both sides?”
Only a couple of miles away, his younger self is in his workshop unaware if how his parents are dying and how everything is going to change.
"Oh man. Jesus."
He pulls against his restraints.
She catches his eye for a moment “You could at least recognize me.”
"Steve?"
Steve and Sam stare up in the direction they just came. Smoke begins to billow into the stairway
"Welcome, Mr. Stark.”
Sam jumps into the mix, holding Bucky's legs as Sharon grabs the syringe from where is skid across the floor and jabs it into Barnes neck; Bucky stills beneath them instantly.
The man smiles “To see an empire fall.”
"Who am I talking to?"
“Wanda isn’t a weapon. She’s young, she’s made some mistakes but she’s not dangerous.”
_ _ _
“It’s possible but then he left without him.” Rhodey says.
"Hit him again. We're still a couple of hours out and I don’t trust him to not try us."
"Good luck getting into it." Steve says
"There’s one a just a mile from here " The burlier paramedic answers in a thick accent.
“Captain, your options are limited. I told you that it was sign or retire. It’s time to make a decision” Ross glance at Tony before leaving the room to give them a moment. Just how many ways does Ross think he can tell him to put Steve in check, as if that were even possible. Tony hates being here, caught in the middle of two seemingly immovable objects. Over the last year, especially with Steve attempting to rebuild Shield, he found himself caught between Ross and Steve.
"I left him alone again. Something wasn’t right, I knew it and I still went for Bucky."
"I know you want to get Tony back but who says this isn’t part of a larger trap. Then its us verse six winter soldiers, maybe more, in the middle of Siberia with no backup. That worries me. A couple of hours ago I was out cold, and you were at the bottom of an elevator shaft."
"How did he know them? Is he Hydra."
His head still hurts but he tries to push the nausea down. Much as he might not want to chance it and ignoring the fact, he has no idea where he is he going to have to find a way to escape. Thankfully the idiots didn’t take his watch.
Natasha rushes back inside as people run from the building in a panic. Sharon meets her at the door, and they race towards the lounge area where Barnes is currently kicking the ass of every person foolish enough to challenge him to a fight.
Hands come down to rest on his shoulders pulling him from memories. For a moment he forgot he was zip-tied to this chair. Zemo circles around to face him. "I wonder if he knew. For two years I watched you grow closer to him, but he never involved you in his search for his friend. You had to wonder why? With all the technology you possess and all the favors he could ask he never asked for your help, it's strange.
"And just like that everything is cool?" Sam says from the door as he’s keeps his distance.
"That doesn't explain it. He'd have to have some ties to someone at the signing and everyone there was vetted or has been in the past. He couldn't know we'd all be there. The only Avenger that the press knew for sure would be here was Tony." Natasha says
