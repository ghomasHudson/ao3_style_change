"Was she ever though?" Rhodey asks quietly, the air around them becoming more tense by the second. "They were takers Tony, and they would have milked you dry for as long as they could. Everything that happened? A blessing if you ask me, no one can justify what they did, not even the part of you riddled with unnecessary guilt."
"Your little brother and sister? They came over at lunch and were asking me about my perfect date and stuff," Riri says, speaking low so that no one can overhear them. "I really like you as a friend, but I don't think it'd work - you and I, I mean."
"Of course you can, Buck, but right now let me clear things up with Tony, and then you can go and speak to him, okay?"
Panting, Tony doubled over and emptied his stomach, shakily accepting the flask of water one of his saviours passed to him.
"Fuck you."
"Yeah, of course. You should see mine." Riri grins, grabbing a circuit board and carefully putting it on a shelf. "We don't have to do anything too complex, but I definitely want ours to stand out."
"You're clearly not from the South." The man laughed, his eyes scrunching up into little crescents.
He's hefting a crate of carrots off of the back of the buckboard when he sees a beautiful young man pass by. Clad in the cloth shirt and leather breeches of any regular smithy, his face and hands blackened from working in the furnace, the man should not have caught his eye at all, except that he did, and Steve can't bring himself to look away. He moves with simple, fluid grace, chestnut curls plastered to his forehead from the heat; looking neither left nor right, nor even showing any reaction to the catcalls from the boys coming from the mines, the man is the picture of silent grace - and then, Steve catches his scent.
"Yeah," Nat says, checking her nails casually. "He's new, might be Rhodes and the rest of them are the only ones he knows here."
"Yeah, I know..."
"Okay."
"No you don't," Thunderbolt says, a wicked gleam in his eyes. "Most Omegas these days whore themselves out for a speck of gold dust and a warm place to stay. Now we don't have a warm place for you to stay, darlin', but I'm sure we can compensate you greatly for your time."
Promise I won't read cute comics and let it influence me!! ‚ù§
I don't know, he's adorable and cows in the presence of a better man.
Tony liked the farmhouse, it was cosy and well-built, and felt like a home. Not
Tony pauses, swallowing back emotion. "But that was wrong of me, Peter, not the parts of giving you your space and time, but expecting you to be the one to reach out to me. And I'm sorry about that, I really am. You are one of the best parts of my life, and the most amazing person I know. I don't want you to do anything, or say anything, I just want you to know that when you're ready,
- It was hard getting into the groove of this chapter lol, so sorry if it sounds stilted!!
"Steve, Steve Rogers; and you don't have to call me 'mister', makes me feel old."
Do you even know what my sister's name is?
"Don't be stupid, Tony. Of course I believe you."
"Tony, if you're about to say anything other than praising me for my skills, or thanking me for the sleep you're about to get, save it. You're my friend, and this is something I wanted to do for you, so no apologies, and no shame, and definitely no gold."
"Sam and Bucky invited me out there to see a plot of land they wanted to farm, on a strictly consultancy basis."
Tony wrangles Reed, and later Stephen, the Sorcerer Supreme, into a meeting as soon as he can, proposing the establishment of a new superhero body that dealt with extraterrestial threats. The council agrees, and Ross, the
"I'm still not happy about the Romanov situation, but if you're sure about this,  I won't protest it."
Steve busies himself with his coffee, opting to not add any sugar or milk, and ignoring the chatter of his housemates about what a loser he was, and what
"Rich kids tend to run in the same circles, no way around it," Tony shrugs, plopping down beside him on the bed and scooting him over to lay down side-by-side. "What I'm more interested in, is what an art nerd like you is doing in a body like this? Not that I object of course," Tony teases, lighting up the joint he'd swiped from Danny.
"How so?" Steve asks, alarmed by the way Tony's face falls, that sadness that he noticed every now and then bleeding through.
"Sorry." Tony gave him a small little smile, dimmer than his usual ones. "I think I reached my limit two drinks ago, you know."
"So, your son just flew up the stairs like a bat outta hell and told me, in not so many words, that I'm an inconsiderate bozo," Steve says as Tony's putting Morgan in her high chair. The baby gurgles happily, sticking a chubby hand in her mouth as she stares at her parents. "I just can't keep up, 'cause just this morning he got mad that I woke him up instead of asking Jarv to do it."
"I don't have problems."
"He wasn't talking to you lot," Nat pipes up, shaking out of Bucky's hold to grab Tony's arm and move to another table.
Rhodey quirks an eyebrow towards their them when he walks into their dorm Sunday afternoon, Tony curled up around Rogers like a little puppy. He says nothing, but shoots Tony a look, to which his best friend just responds with one of his famous smirks.
"Boring," Tony sighs, leaning over to sip at Steve's beer. "Much better now though."
Taking her hand and ignoring the disapproving looks from his brother, Harley places a gentle kiss on her knuckles before his dad or Peter can interrupt. "Sweet Lady Riri, I am Harley, second son of Steven and Anthony. I hope this is not too forward of me, but I would ask you to give me the honour of-"
"Yeah..."
"Oh, that? Yeah, sorry, I've just been having a rwally shitty da-
"Oh, the two of you know something we don't?" Stephen asks, looking from Matt and Tony.
"I'm glad you asked. We talked about it, and thought we'd do our dear old brother a favour," she tells him, foot still swinging. "But just know, when we call for it one day - and this day may not ever come - but if it does, you'll have to do us a favour."
The guy gives him a sleepy grin, bright and unguarded, a hand coming to rest on the small of his back.
"Yay, isn't it exciting?" Janet asks, perking up suddenly. "What if we got Tony to model?"
"All forms of entertainment that involved stickin' your parts in someone else's gets taken upstairs, I don't want y'all making these lice-infested half-wits think they can act any typ'a way in this here establishment."
-latter part of chapter heavily inspired by the comic establishment of the Illuminati.
-Tony is not a trash parent, he's just trying to give Peter time to work through his feelings. Big miscommunication between the two, because Peter's not mad/resentful of him!!
"Tony, I didn't imply th-"
"If I was, you would know, Rogers," Tony teases back, pushing his hair out of his eyes.
Steeling himself to look perfectly normal, he nodded at the two campus security guards passing by, before rushing forward when the big ugly greek letters of Steve's house came into view. Steve's light on the second floor was off, but suddenly a bright idea came to Tony. Removing his hands from the warmth of his pockets, he combined the lawn for pebbles.
"Mm, I did have a teacher from down South, my mouth was her and my mother's worst parts about me. This pretty face outweighed all the bad though." Tony shifted in bed, squinting out of the window to try to make out the time. "Sorry that I won't be bending over to thank you, though. Those are against my principles."
"You seem very interested in him, Steve," Natasha interrupts, a perfectly shaped eyebrow quirked in suspicion.
My anxiety disorder is getting worse. The doctor says it's because I've been stressing too much.
"You don't ever need to worry about them again. In the West it's illegal to steal from poor farmers, and trying to hurt an Omega is even worse. That's a crime worth hanging," the man said, his tone cold but not at all harsh towards Tony. "No one will ever snatch you again, you were probably frightened to death."
"The heroes who've signed on are all vetted for, and everyone who's signed the agreement agrees to answering to the higher ups," Tony explains, signalling for Stephen to jump in.
He's a fun kid, but I don't think Riri would be amused by him and his gang of minions.
"So... I take it you like her, kiddo?"
The morning is still young from the light shining beyond his window, and he's hardly heard anyone shuffling around the halls, so he enjoys his fleeting moment of peace with Tony, dragging him below him. He peppers kisses down Tony's neck and asks if he is up for sex, giving his hand a squeeze. Tony says yes, wrapping his legs around Steve's waist to get him to grind against him.
Peter had been there at the airport, had taken his dad's
Steve pauses, backing away from Tony. "Did I hurt you? Was I too rough now?"
"Steve, please." Tony takes a shuddering breath in, impatiently whining for Steve to just fuck him already.
It's getting late, and Peter doesn't want to hold her up too long, so they go in search of his parents, purposefully ignoring the stream of messages from Harley.
"Tony are you okay?"
"The goat?" The man asked amused, leaning back in his chair and filling up the room in the most unsuffocating way.
"I guess... seafood is my all time favourite though," she tells them, choosing to humour these insanely straightforward kids.
"Oh yeah, Tony. He got Speed's hooves fixed up."
Hope you guys enjoy, I'm hoping to finish this up super soon (so within the next 2-3 weeks, and the fic might be a bit longer than planned)
" And not a lot of heroes trust the council either, prior issues with authority, especially with Ross having been a prominent figure on the council."
"Well you know us Omegas and our catalogues, I was just thinking I needed a new dress just in case I have nowhere to wear it to," Tony joked, slipping the pouch into his satchel.
"Interrogate is a strong word," Sam says.
"You're in trouble, Steve," Clint sing songs from the sitting room, foot propped up on the coffee table. "Rhodey wasn't happy to find out that you snuck off with his boy."
"Okay, but what do we do? What do
"Uh, ye-yes. So be good for him and get to bed." Thor tucks him into Bruce's bed, the owner having vacated so that Tony could be the one sleeping by the wall. "Just go to bed, and we'll chat in the morning, okay?"
Harley is sitting at the kitchen table, minding his own sweet business (
we're getting korean bbq later.
Tony is quiet for a bit, and Steve thinks he's nodded off again before suddenly he's turning in his hold, a line pinching between his brow. "Hey, is everything fine?"
"But what if Peter's friend gets scared and think we're weird for having voices that come from the ceiling?" Harley argues, straightening himself out. "Did you ever consider that pops?"
"What are you suggesting, Barnes? Just spit it out."
"I know she's not sorry, and I know she probably won't ever be sorry, and that's honestly not her fault. She was taught self-preservation and shit, but trust me here, Rhodey. It's better to have one of them here," Tony urges, getting up to pace across the lounge. "They're unpredictable, and clearly uncontrollable. Having them out there with no way of tracking them would just be counterproductive to our work. I don't feel comforted knowing they could dive in at any moment."
Even now, months later, the super soldier was still buying into his own delusions, along with the rest of the team; she couldn‚Äôt even recognise who Clint had become these days, bitterness and hatred consuming his mind. Steve rarely mentioned his children, the children he had left without a word and betrayed within the blink of an eye, or expressed fear for Tony surviving, convinced it was just some media ploy to garner sympathy and to get them arrested ‚Äì he hadn‚Äôt even reacted to the little girl Potts had announced was born to Tony,
"Tell you what," Dr Park starts, and Tony can hear shuffling on the other side of the line, "let's see how he fares tonight and then you bring him by in the morning. Do you have anything to help him sleep?"
did you want to hang out? üëâüëå
"You sure are acting like you are, Tony. What they did, what
Finding none, he settled for the loose beads from one of the jumbo drinking cups, and with not-so-precise aim, threw them at his beefy blonde's window.
"Mm, I hope you don't use that line at Nat's." And then, Steve's blushing again.
Tony had been her friend, a man who loved her and took her in despite what she had done to him in the past, and all she had wanted to do was control him - first for S.H.I.E.L.D., then for Steve, and supposedly always for everyone‚Äôs own good. Tony was volatile, a ticking time bomb waiting to go off, he‚Äôd mess up somehow, it didn‚Äôt matter how or when, but it was inevitable, was what she had told herself and pandered to the rest of the team. He can‚Äôt be trusted to make decisions by himself, it‚Äôs best for
Now though, he just wanted to sleep, to numb himself and sleep until he felt better, even if he didn‚Äôt deserve to feel better, not when Rhodey couldn‚Äôt walk, might never walk again thanks to him and the baby they hastily took out of him was somewhere in the very hospital he was lying in, fighting for their life. The nurses had told him it was a girl, which led to them sedating him after an incredible laughing fight which immediately led to a crying fit. At 46 years old, you shouldn‚Äôt be having kids, let alone preemies, despite having Jamie not 2 years ago, that had been under extreme medical supervision and he had at least known he was pregnant. This baby though, he had already ruined their life, bringing them into a world where their sire had smashed a vibranium shield in his chest and had promptly skipped off into the sunset with their grandmother‚Äôs killer. But then again Barnes didn‚Äôt kill Howard or Maria, the Winter Soldier did but that didn‚Äôt change the fact that every time Tony closed his eyes he saw Barnes‚Äô hands and eyes and body murdering his mom. Boy, he should not be thinking about this right now.
"Which I get," Sam said, exasperation clear in his voice. "Why would you word it like that?"
"We know." The girl, Gwen, giggles pushing her straw into her chocolate milk.
At the look of shock that crosses Steve's face, Thor bursts into thunderous laughter, clapping a heavy hand on his back. "I joke! He does go to Nat's though. I hear he likes a nice rich scotch with his steak."
Bucky recounted his chat with Tony in the lab, pulling on his hair. "And then he kinda just freaked."

"Wait, I think Thor might have some Vaseline or something around here," Steve says, lowering himself to press a kiss to Tony's lips before fumbling to the front of the van, scratching around before finding a bottle of hand lotion.
I would never abandon you guys!
Rubbing his arm sheepishly, Sam peers at her. "Ow, that's not even what I was implying!"
"And you're clearly not from the West, Mister..."
"So I should expect you to slash up your sheets next? Just ask me to come over, genius."
"I'm not even in the same faculty as you guys, so excuse me," Steve says. "Anyway, do you know that new kid with him? The one between him and Danvers."
"Because you're too busy thinking with your knot."
"I saw her, and I saw you act a fool," Tony says, laughing at his son rolling his eyes. "You know I was young and pretty too once, seriously, Google it! Most eligible bachelor 1993-2001, so I
"I wouldn't be so harsh on them Nat." Tony chuckles pulling up a seat beside Steve. "Are you staying for dinner?"
"It's okay." Really, it was. Tony's had the same thought thousands of times.
"Lang and Barton both have kids, they must have been feeling the heat from being international fugitives." Luke gets up with a shrug, heading outside to help Ben with the grill.
This was planned so differently!
A light came on, and a familiar physique came into view, a panicked look on his face. Tony giggled, whisper-yelling that he should come down and bring his boom box.
"Yes, he's only having a bad day, which will turn out
"Nunya."
"Are you just going to chill here, or did you need something? Not that I'm sending you away of course, it's just weird for you to be here. Alone. In a way."
"That's not relevant, Tones. My comrades know to circle back and do what needs to be done once we snuff out the big fish first."
Hi!! PLEASE read?
Steve grins at his son, taking plates out for lunch, and Morgan's bowl. "Jarv, can you tell everyo-"
Bucky remained silent, contemplating what to say next before Tony ranted on. "Thank you for opening my eyes, Buckaroo. Steve needs... better, and I need someone more adjusted to my life. This-this was a good talk, Barnes. Completely get what you mean."
And as Steve swings back to stare, he does in fact see Danvers approach them, cupping the unknown brunet's cheek and greeting him a little
(See the end of the chapter for
Peter is glaring at the phone in his hand, like he has ever since he found it in his locker. He had remembered to grab it last minute, afraid his Dad would find it if he had to go back and pack for him.
"Shh, don't you worry about a thing. Let me make you feel good." Natasha kisses his brow gently, trailing feather light pecks down the side of his face to his exposed collarbone.
They run into the boy downstairs though, the blonde padding to the lounge on bare feet and not even sparing them a glance, besides a nod of acknowledgement.
"Boy scout! Killer game out there," Tony beams at him, sliding an arm through his.
Tony smiles, stroking his stomach. "I do, but you didn't answer me. Wuth words, bug guy."
"While you three were bein' shut-in hermits, Reed got him down here from the farm. Heard it's because the drought isn't treating them too well and the Storms needed to cut their expenses, besides, they needed an extra set of hands since Tony's
Peter, still furiously blushing, apologises immediately, leading a now shell-shocked Riri to his room down the hall, breathing out a sigh of relief when the bedroom door clicks shut behind them.

Harley nods. "I remember. You had to sleep at the hospital too, and me and Jaime stayed with Pops at the Tower."
"Ah, but that's where you're wrong," Rhodey shoots back with that same false tone. "If you don't explain, I'll do everything in my power to have the council reject your motion. What were you even thinking, Tony?"
"Calm down, what happened?"
Cold, weary, and miserably wet, he pushed himself to his knees, halting when the sound of muffled footsteps stopped behind him. Stealing a look, he spies cloaked figures making their way towards him.
Forcing a laugh, Tony tried to discreetly wrap the shawl around him tighter. "Long day down at the mines, I take the boys' lunch every day, and sometimes they need a helping hand. I've never been shy of hard work."
Tony is determined. It's always been said of him, and one of the nicer, more positive words people have used to describe him. So here he is waking up at three am in a pool of drool and with a crick in his neck, trying to gathering his bearings enough to
"Dad, I don't feel good, and I don't know what's happening," he cries, voice tiny as he clutches onto Tony's nightstand.
"Don't worry PC, I like you enough," Tony tries to expel the awkwardness, leaning back into arm Steve has around his shoulders.
"Who says I'm not?"
I shouldn't have implied that about your dad. It was stupid of me.
"There is no both, you silly Omega, come on," she says, dragging Tony up behind her. "I know just what to do to relieve some of your
Steve laughs out loud, grabbing his stomach to stop the aching and cooing at Harley's furrowed brows. "You're funny kiddo."
Tony sighs, feeling ten times heavier. "Not much, just that there has been both internal and external pushes for their return. It's inching closer to a year, and the governments dont want them acting without oversight, so they figured it's better to have them here under surveillance, than out there."
When the front door opened however, it was not Steve who greeted him, but Thor, his eyebrows knitted in worry and his cheeks pinking from the cold air. "Tony what the hell are you doing outside? Do you want to freeze to death?"
"Only because you don't count failures."
James Rhodes had never believed in distracting Tony from his problems, he always believed in taking them head on and dealing with them so that they couldn‚Äôt come back to bite either of them in the ass (in the bad way, Tony had always purred). Looking at Tony now though, body beaten and broken, with a million and one machines attached to his body keeping him alive, and no way of knowing what happened (he could guess, Vision brought the arm and the shield back after getting Tony to the hospital and thoughts of Rogers hadn‚Äôt been met with anything but rage and the need to go out there and find him, legs or no legs, and make him hurt so that he felt even a smidgen of what Tony must be feeling ‚Äì and boy did he feel better thinking about the legs than he did a week ago, his therapist would be proud), Rhodey wanted nothing more than to make him feel better, to take away that pained look in his eye and the scrunch in his nose that meant he was over thinking everything and probably finding ways to blame himself for everything that had happened. Not for the first time, Jim wished he could help Tony, take some of the burden and worries off his shoulders, and spare him this world of pain that the last few weeks, years, had turned into. The baby would survive, she was Tony‚Äôs after all, and Jim willed it so. Losing the baby would just be another thing to destroy Tony, and the man was suffering through Atlas‚Äô burden already.
"Samuel Wilson," Nat cries in indignation, slapping his arm with her handkerchief. "Do y'all say anything when an Alpha way past his prime walks around here with a pretty young thing on his arm?"
"Pooooops, I thought we talked about this."
"Huh? Oh yeah, that's Anthony. He's new."
Hope you guys enjoyed It, please let me know what you think of this direction üôè
He catches sight of Steve on his way over, the blonde throwing his head back in laughter at something Nat says to him. Tony's heart beats a bit faster, because Steve is so lovely, and so
They find his parents in the den, Morgan and Pops dozing off in front of the TV and Dad pouring over some documents.
"Well..."
"I- I- Mm," Tony moaned weakly, a hand fisted in her skirt.
"They probably do, but prefer to spend all their time worried about what other people do. They're the biggest gossips in town."
"You complaining about my cooking, Stark?"
Leave it to Tony to get lost in a town with only one paved road, but honestly speaking, it was that stupid goat's fault.
"Thor, I need to see Steve, like right now or I might burst."
Their week is spent drinking and fucking, and smoking the occassional joint when they're all loose limbed and blissed-out from fucking.
I want to understand now.
"Rebrand?"
- sex scene between Natasha and Tony in the last part of the chapter (from where she takes him upstairs!!), though they are not and will not become a couple!!
"Med bay, Shauna speaking."
Tony smirks down at him, pinching his cheek lightly. "How about banana pancakes? I'm starving to have something in my mouth you know."
Pushing his impatience aside, Steve smiles encouragingly at the huge blonde, who, though insanely smart, could be hella dense at times. "Yeah, and..."
"Who's speculating about me?"
"And this?" Natasha asks, popping up behind Tony. "Is Remy bullying you into drinking his disgusting moonshine?"
"As long as you keep those cute curls, I won't be opposed to it."
"What's understood doesn't have to be explained," Tony says smoothly. "We have our inside jokes though, Platypus, no need to be jealous."
"Is that all?"
"He's
"Well no, but I'm su-"
"How did you find me, by the way? There was no one out there and I was pretty deep in."

From: Ned Stark
"Sorry, Riri, he's been, uh, reading a lot of period literature, and was just joking around.
"A what?" Steve asks in confusion. Maybe it was already time to cut Bucky off for the night.
@themechanic @artingrogers art :)
"Why thank you, Caesar," Anthony says, much more playful than Steve would expect, at the same time he gives his thanks. "And I would tell you the details, if you weren't so snakey about it."
"You didn't lose me, James," Nat yells, kicking at his feet before sinking down beside him and leaning in for a kiss. Steve turns away, eyes resting on the brunet beauty once again. He's swaying back and forth now, Rhodes's hand shoved into his back pocket like they were in some teen flick.
Janet finally catches up with them, shoving a first year out of the way to hook her arm in with Tony's other one. "So I totally just learned Beast is at Xavier's. I always thought he was more of a Harvard type," she says excitedly, sliding her glasses down over her eyes. "Hi, by the way, Steve."
"Why would I break his heart?" Tony knows he sounds defensive, but Jesus fuck, why shouldn't he be?
Laughter rumbled through the group of four, and Tony paled slightly, inconspicuously trying to find something he could use for a weapon in case things went left. "I seem to have lost my way, why don't you fine gentleman point me back to the road and we can all be on our way?"
It didn‚Äôt seem like he was getting out of here anytime soon, what with the post-partum hemorrhaging that‚Äôs been lasting the past two weeks and not to mention the impossibility of surviving without all these dumb machines. He wished by some miracle the world would just quiet down until he felt better, strong enough to deal with it. That the beeping of the machines would just stop (then again that would mean he was dead, but whatever, in a hopefully not-dead kind of way) and that all these doctors and nurses and specialists coming in and out of the room, checking vitals, speaking at him, about him like he wasn‚Äôt even a person, would just quiet down and leave, like Steve had. Given, they wouldn‚Äôt be leaving him in an abandoned Hydra bunker, but maybe before they left, they could drop one of the heavier machines being rolled around he place on his chest, but leave a way for him to survive and feel every aching second of his body going into distress and shutting down, with no sign of help coming, they could get the feel of it right. God, he definitely shouldn‚Äôt be thinking about any of that, the doctors said as much, and he‚Äôd rather not have them bring in the shrinks like they‚Äôve been threatening to do. For that he was at least grateful, no one was breathing down his neck to speak about everything that happened, to share and to expose himself bare to the world. Stark men are made of iron, but so were the women, and god help him, his kid would survive. Tiny as she ‚Äì they, she could decide who she wanted to be just as much as he had ‚Äì was, the nurses had said the fluid in her lungs were drained and that they were keeping a close eye on her and that someone would be by soon to discuss their options going forward. Soon as he could, he had had the best surgeons and specialists flown in to care for them, strong as they were, they needed help and no matter how much iron ran in your DNA, everyone needs a little help weak heart such as that and fluid in the lungs. The both of them needed to get stronger so that they could be treated in the US, not that he wasn‚Äôt thankful to his Siberian carers but the first few days were terrifying, how they had kept him alive was still a mystery, but stealing floor space and resources from the locals, people in dire need of help, wasn‚Äôt something that Tony wanted to continue doing, he didn‚Äôt need more people suffering because of him. Rhodey and the kid should be the last, they deserved more than him but before they left, before they realised he was no good like everyone else seemed to do, he would make their lives better. Give them what they need and give them a fighting chance. Already, his mind was filled with the blueprints of an exoskeleton that could assist Rhodey, he just needed to find a way to make it work with brainwaves, he wanted it to be and to feel as natural as possible, and Rhodey deserved that at least. Tony would make sure the physio went well and gave him the best chance of walking again, and if he couldn‚Äôt he‚Äôd at least have something to fall back onto. God, Rhodey falling ‚Äì he should have caught him, should have unarmed Sam himself to make sure the wings couldn‚Äôt be used against them but he didn‚Äôt want his teammates (ex-teammates, but was Tony ever a teammate in their eyes?) to feel like he was approaching with hostility. He had just wanted them to listen, but as always, Captain America‚Äôs word would always trump Stark‚Äôs, I mean he was just playing hero after all and Rogers was righteousness incarnate in everybody‚Äôs eyes. If only they knew what happened in that bunker, surely the government would be tripping over their feet to further distance from Rogers and his little band of lap dogs. No more, he didn‚Äôt need to think of them and their backstabbing and secrets. He needed to figure out an internal prosthetic, a valid and working substitute for his kid‚Äôs weak heart. He might not have done anything to fix his heart but his baby deserved to live, to grow up and be even more amazing than they already were, and if they wanted to do that away from Tony, from his poison and selfishness and ego (honestly, fuck Natasha and Fury and every other rat bastard who had ever used that as ammunition against him), Tony would let them and just be grateful that they were alive and well and safe, like Pete, and Harley, and Jamie are. For now, modern medicine would have to step in and do what they can until they can get a donor or Tony can come up with something, he didn‚Äôt want them living in pain, they didn‚Äôt deserve that and maybe the odds weren‚Äôt so great for them having a transplant so soon, but it was possible. He‚Äôd let them heal and grow a bit stronger before he had them moved and once he was back in the lab he could come up with something, maybe Helen would help him out and see if they cradle could be upgraded to help beyond tissue repair, if only for the baby‚Äôs sake, and he definitely needed to name them. Can‚Äôt be calling the kid kid for the rest of their life.
Steve chortled again, slapping a hand across his chest. "My, you do have a mouth on you. I didn't believe Bucky or Sam."
When they're out in the yard waiting for his Dad, Riri reminds him of her offer to join the Champions.
For one, he had a mirror installed on the roof for shits and giggles (but it turned out to be exactly what was needed during his and Steve's week-long sexathon), and for two, he was cramped in a single bed with a strong arm curled around him.
So Peter calls home to make sure it's okay with his parents to bring a friend home, and so that his dad can bully the family into behaving, and is understandably nervous when he leads Riri to the indiscreet car parked by the school gate. She laughs good naturedly when he rushes to open the door for her and signal her to get in, but says nothing, leaning against the window to peer out at the city. The closer they got to the house, the more nervous Peter gets, until Riri (probably picking up on Peter's dorky nervous energy) starts talking about finally starting Star Wars, leading them into a long debate over whether or not Rey actually was a Skywalker or not.
you like jan more than me ü§ßü§ß
"Dad!" Peter interrupts, spurring Tony to intervene before anybody spontaneously combusted from embarrassment or self-confidence.
"How do I know this isn't just a ploy to learn Atlantis's secrets? I've heard about you, Stark, and Richards. You'd stop at nothing in the pursuit of knowledge."
"So, you think I can get her to come to the Spring formal with me?"
"Uh, I'm cool on that, Dad. I should really get to bed, school tomorrow, you know?" Peter rushes out, and Tony stomps down on the disappointment he feels.
Tony becomes a regular in the locker room, bringing Rhodes snacks, and goofing off with the rest of the team before and after games. He wears Steve's shirts sometimes, and when he doesn't, his necklines hang low enough for the love bites Steve sucks into his skin to be on display.
Riri continues spinning on, feet now tucked under her. "If you didn't want to join, it's one hundred percent cool, but just know, the offer stands."
Yeah, this definitely was way worse than he could have imagined.
Now why he thought possibly facing wolves and bandits was easier than just crossing the street and running off, Job alone would know, and he had run too far in to figure out which way was the way back to the road, so on he trudged, trying to map the stars whenever a sliver of the sky appeared between the leaves of the tightly grown redwoods.
"Thanks for this, Tony, really."
"See what you want to do is not lnly turnover and fertilise the soil, but you're going to need structures for the vines to grow with." Tony fans himself with his straw hat, pointing to the sections of land that would be best suited for it.
That doesn't mean you should just abandon us. We're your children. Your family. We should come first.
Halfway through the movie, he slids a hand up Steve's thigh, teasingly tracing his cock through his jeans. Steve squirms, and shoots Tony a dark look, but doesn't make any move to stop him.
Routine and structure were good for him, keeping his mind busy and tiring himselfbout was even better.
How would you know we're perfect? You're not even around to see.
Peter was understandably a lot different post-Germany. Though he still kept up his grades, and interacted with his friends and the family, Tony could tell something big had changed.
He had been disoriented, but stumbled along to his wagon nonetheless. Even if this wasn't Reed, he'd figured anything had to be better than nothing right?
NB: continuity issue on my part, people DO know about Steve/Tony, but this only happened after the SHIELD leaks. That's why doctor mentions it in ch 2, we'll blame the oops in chapter one on Tony's morphine?
@ArtDecider @themechanic LOL tones...
"Dad, of course I like her! Did you see her?" Harley replies, offended that that would even be a question that needed to be asked, as if his dad hadn't interrupted Harley in the middle of trying to profess his love.
"Who is he, and what's an Omega doing working in the smithy?" Steve asks bewildered, resting the crate on his shoulder and rushing his steps to catch up with Thor when the brunet disappears down the street.
"Okay, let's lay off the Old English there bud, but of course baby." Tony replies affectionately stroking the curls falling around Harley's face. "When Peter asks thou-"
"You're overthinking this, Parker. We worked together on the bodega robberies, remember? You definitely should get something to mask your voice, not many kids around here sound like you."
The laugh Tony let's out is adorable, and Steve can picture sketching the crinkles forming in the corners of his eyes. "You're a funny guy, Steve," Tony says, reclining in one of the patio chairs. "That handshake kinda made me feel like I was in a business meeting."
Tony already feels a throbbing behind his eye. "Yeah, you're not going to do that."
mj only says that because she terrifies him and he listens to her
"Tony might have a type, at least we know if you were a few years younger, you'd totally have a chance with him," Bucky says unhelpfully, chewing on a tobacco leaf.

Strangely, they manage to find their footing in their weird
"Kf course he can, I'm really not trynin' to imply anything, but with what happened with Sharon, someone has to look out for Steve, even when he doesn't want us to."
Steve is breathing against his neck lightly, his head tucked into Tony's neck, and even though it's making the crick worse, Tony can't bring himself to move out of the embrace.
"You had nothing to do with it, I know," Harley finishes, gathering his dad in a bear hug.
"Yeah, about that - Steve's already missing his phone, which makes things easier, and I think
Riri's heart will be his!

"I know, should have gone into comedy, right?" Tony jokes, elbowing him in the side. The sit in silence for all of 15 seconds (a new record for Tony, by the way), before he starts whistling, swinging his feet back and forth. "So..."
"Then what is it, huh Barnes? What do you and the guys have to say?"
From: Unknown
"Well, he goes with Richards." Thor shrugs, as if that's answer enough. "Reed makes sure nobody bothers him unless they've paid for his time, and that's
"Tony!" Steve's eyes light up, but Tony's sure that's just a trick of the light. Steve has one of his big goody grins stretched across his face, shuffling out of the booth for them to move in.
When Tony wakes up again, much more sober, his head throbbing and his tongue feeling thick and swollen, he's aware that he's not in his room.
"It's different out here, you can experience all four seasons in one day."
"Yeah but I
"I'm no whore, sirs, just a lost Omega who has to get back home before my husband sends the cavalry, so let me not hold you gentlemen up any further. A good night to you." Tony pivoted on his heel, rushing in the opposite direction to try to put as much space between him and them as he could. They surely wouldn't leave him untouched, especially not after revealing their identities to him.
"I can't! This quiz closes in like thirty minutes and I haven't even gotten started, and I can't find my phone, and the fucking bursary off-"
"Okay at some point you should get to the point, Buckaroo."
Please let me know of any tags I should add, and sorry for not replying to comments yet, will do so first thing in the morning I'm just super exhausted right now üíî
"What do you know about him? Is he
"No problem." Steve turns his back to him, so Tony can't see his face, but he feels his heart crawl between them and break all the same.
"And here I thought you didn't read, how does a small-town boy like you know about Greek mythology?"
"You think they think that?" Rhodey snorts. If there's one thing Rogers and his group of lackeys could do right, it was think that the world spinned for them only.
"I hear Reed has lots of space, he wouldn't turn his nephew away."
"That's right, sweetheart, best you spend the night here with us, in fact, why don't you take those filthy clothes off and we give you a nice little bath, huh?" Another man piped up, causing Tony to grow even more tense.
"You're not acting like you believe me much."
She had used his desperation for acceptance to keep him in check,
"Combat-wise, things were smooth as butter though, half the team hated me and yet we were still able to do our jobs." Tony digs into his bag, sliding the proposal towards him. "Instead of groups of heroes and mutants running around and trying our best to stop a better and more organised enemy, we need to band together."
"Hey, thanks for that, Ty can be a little much at times, you know?" Anthony says, beginning to pull Steve along with him as he headed outside.
Squinting in the sun, Tony nodded his head. "Yeah, there's a lack of good wines in the area."
Riri doesn't know what to think about this.
From: Peter B. Parkour
"Oh oh oh!" Tony screams when she twists her fingers, slamming them in and out with a gentleness unlike any other. With his legs spread like this, and Nat almost a fist deep in him, Tony feels like he
"Like what? If you're worried that I'm whoring myself out again, don't be-"
The largest gashes lay horizontal across his sternum, the scars from the arc reactor all but unrecognizable thanks to the inflamed skin stretched across Tony‚Äôs chest, and she couldn‚Äôt explain it, but it was obvious there was no bone left in his concaved chest cavity, an exoskeleton somehow miraculously holding everything together. His nipples had been patched, although no breast tissue remained and a fresh horizontal pink scar twinkled morbidly below his navel.
"Sam doesn't either."
Tiberius just laughs, wading his way through the crowd with a lazy wave. So here Steve was, completely confused as to what just transpired. Some first introduction he made.
"Oh, uh, yeah. No problem," Steve starts, trailing behind the guy. "I'm Steve, by the way, and you must be Anthony" he adds, and before his brain can catch up with him, he sticks his hand out.
Slinking back into the back of the wagon, Steve throws an arm around the crate of goods they'd bought in town, getting lost in his thoughts to the sound of Bucky and Sam bickering outside.
so, good match???
"I am. Trust me, Rhodey."
"And you can see him in the morning, when you're sobered up. Imagine what Rhodey will say if he sees you like this."
The situation just can't be helped right now. When Morgan and I finally meet, and I can explain to all of you the situation, you'll understand. I promise.
"Actually," the man starts, running a hand through his hair that gleamed like sunlight, "you weren't too far from our farm, some of our sheep and a chicken disappeared, and well, I guess we found the culprit."
"Okay, you're killing us here, Ri," Sam finally says, turning to face her fully. "Just tell us what your perfect date would be like, minus the seafood and bowling."
Tony walks into the restaurant Steve had tested him about, Jan on his heels, and spots Thor's hulking figure carrying beers over to tables pushed together in the corner.
"Nothing, you just said something oddly poetic. Didn't expect it from a meat machine, is all."
Climbing the stairs, his stomach twisted when he thought of how Tony looked in the lab. He'd been near tears when he'd asked Bucky to leave, a hysteria building behind his voice like Bucky had never heard before. He could only hope Rhodes only caught up to him after he finished his essay.
"I wouldn't, but I don't go by Nat's except for when I need a hearty meal and some beer to fill my belly."
They fuck for the first time at the school bonfire.
"Those are some real bad manners you got there, your mama never teach you how to speak to an Alpha?" The man holding him asked with a wicked grin, yanking at the strings of Tony's shirt, ripping it off his shoulders and down his chest. "We didn't even get your name."
- attempted rape (No details, from when Tony falls to the next ***)

"You don't like coding?"
"The Avengers were a unified structure, no? Look at how that turned out."
Dressing the next morning was hell on earth for his pained joints. Bucky had brought him some clothes, a worn-out linsey-woolsy and a camisole with frayed ribbons, that in Tony's state seemed like the greatest gift. He didn't really want to go to breakfast or in to town butt naked.
On theirway home, Sam calls out to Steve from his horse. "You know, Steve, that Storm boy sure looks like you."
"Steve I ca-"
Tony groans into his whiskey, rolling his eyes in exasperation. "You small town folk don't have much to do around here besides gossip, it's probably why so many of you have so many pups running around."
"'Young Innovator' you say? Now you're talking my language kiddo," Tony replies, eyes shining with excitement, and trying to dispel the awkward atmosphere, "are you interested in tech, Riri, or just science in general? You know, I know a guy at MIT, I can get you a great reference if you're interested."
Peter is looming above him at three in the morning, his skin pale and covered in a sheen of sweat.
"I'm in mechanics, remember? Anyway, we have access to this lab for robotics, which I'm totally only going to take for one semester."
"Of course not, Nat. I've just been tired, is all." Tony leans back, closing his eyes. "It's been busy you know?"
"That you have plenty of."
"It's Harley, if he does something, he does it at maximum effort."
"I see I'll have to drag you three down to the schoolhouse after I chase you into a bath."
"Now Tony, what did I tell you about going out and looking for trouble?" A (thankfully) familiar voice asked, Sam drawing him up and tucking him into the crook of his neck where a calming woodsy scent settled over him.
OMG can you hear yourself?!
Then Steve is moving, drawing back from the kiss and adding some of the lotion to the condom. He lines his cock up with Tony's entrance, one of the brunet's legs propped over his shoulder, and gently but steadily starts pushing in past the ring of muscle. They moan together at the feel, and then Steve pushes all the way in, bottoming out and leaning forward to litter kisses over Tony's chest.
Steve is stunned for all but a second, before he's smirking down at the brunet and resting his hand on the small of his back, hoping he wasn't pushing it. "Sorry, I got held up at beer pong, you know how Clint gets when he's losing," Steve fills in effortlessly, enjoying the way Anthony relaxes into his touch.
It was a stark contrast to Tony's bedroom back at the hostel; he kept everything in place, bags always packed and shoes at the door in case he ever needed to leave in a rush. Rhodey would've called him dramatic, but if there was one thing he'd learned in the passed fee months, it was that you never go through life unprepared.
They settle into the movie again after that, Steve using his sleeve to wipe Tony's face clean.
"NEPHEW?" Tony shouts, piping down when about a dozen of the heads in the tavern turn to him. "Nephew? Nephew? You sure have lost it, Natalia, did you bump your head or something?"
"Hey Fri, can you bring up our research on Atlantis?"
"Please let me get Howard out the paint before you come for me, and also, is your dad not super rich?"
"There's no need to, they seem to be giving themselves up. Seriously, I don't care as long as they stay out of my business."
He quietly unlocks the door, earning a raised eyebrow from Riri when he pokes his head in, scoping the surroundings. He can hear someone fluttering around the kitchen, and if his nose is right - which it always is when it comes to food - can smell the heavenly aroma of his dad's famous spaghetti. If Dad was home cooking lunch, it meant that Pops wasn't, but that he'd most likely picked the kids up on his way home - so Harley, the twins and Morgan were home, which usually was a recipe for disaster, especially since Morgan had discovered running.
"H-hey, Dad," Peter stutters out when he pops his head out, eyes lowering to the ground.
He's in an old football shirt that belonged to Rhodes, his number and surname displayed on the back, and a well-worn pair of jeans. It was incredibly endearing and nice to see, and if he'd been in Steve's number, it would have been even better.
"Namor thought we wanted Atlantis's secrets, many other superheroes might think that too. Not everyone operates unmasked," Stephen explains.
Steve scrunches his nose up, washing whatever product his son had slathered all over him off of his hands. "And I thought we talked about all these chemicals you were putting in your hair. You know in my da-"
A new contender for Tony's heart enters the ring, Bucky and Natasha are stubbornly in love, and Sam is tired of the idiots around him who can't just ~talk~ about their feelings.
"You're doing a lot of arguing for someone who's sick."
"Everyone's been telling me to give you time, that eventually you'd come around, and really, I've been trying. I've been trying so hard to give you the space work out your feelings," Tony says clasping their hands together. "So I didn't meddle, and I didn't push, I didn't ask Friday to keep eyes on you and report your every move to me, I tried to give you the space you needed, hoping you'd find your way back to me on your own."
Paying no mind to Steve, she leads the giggling Omega to a seat at the bar. "Tony comes here to spend time with me, not you no-good Alphas."
"Really?" Jamie asks, perking up at the mention of presents. "I want Legos!"
This time around, they don't fully have control over the situation, and can't control how much information gets out, so by the time they're transported to the US, the news is already splashed over the front page.
"What about bowling then? Do you like it?"
Tony Stark (@themechanic) followed you.
Years later, Natasha looks for the
"Tony." There it was. That tone. Tony could already feel what was coming on, the disapproval, the obvious message that he wasn't good enough for Steve, that Steve deserved better than him. To be honest, it hurt him a little more that it was coming from people he himself considered friends now.
"Only when everybody's watching." Tony smirks at him, blinded by the light shining in his hair. "I wouldn't mind being your tasting expert once the harvest comes around, I hear I have really good tastebuds."
"Oh, I-I'll ask Rhodey. Thanks Steve, you're a really nice guy."
So? He shouldn't have to take you back after everything that happened.
"I gave you guys unsupervised access to my corner of the lab, and dessert for six weeks!" Harley cries out, looking at them incredulously.
Tony breathes through the tension, willing himself to relax, because god, he wants this.
"Chillax, Mother. Jane helped me out and I finished early," he says, sticking his tongue out at Bucky. "Unlike you, I don't know the struggle of last minute shit."
"I couldn't care less about Fury, but I acknowledge that he might become a problem."

- picks up directly after chapter one -
"Steve isn't the only artist, you know. Maybe if you hung out with us apart from him you'd know that." Bucky poked him in his side, sliding his tablet over to himself. "What's this?"
diaryofafitmommyofficial Gorgeous!
"Oh, of course you do, kiddo." Tony shrugs, shoving his hands in his gown's pockets. "I can still bring you a cup if you want though? Maybe it'll help you sleep better."
"Yeah, sure." Thor nods, disappearing up the stairs.
He'd wandered for days around the port, trying to remember what Rhodey had said about Reed. The man owned a smithy, but it couldn't be anywhere near the docks because no man had heard of him. He was hungry and cold when Reed finally stumbled upon him, trying to find himself at the bottom of the bottle of sweet wine his last "client" had left behind as payment. "Tony? Get up, come on."
Tony takes his face between his hands, peppering gentle kisses to his brow and smoothing his wild curls down. "Nothing, we were just talking about your Christmas present, Baby. Dr Strange and I were thinking that we need to get your list to Santa soon."
"So what, do you think I'm going to hurt him? That I'll eat him up and spit him out without little care for his feelings?"
The blonde rushes out of the room, locking it for precaution, before he's boumding up the stairs again to get Sam and Bucky. Sam wakes in an instant, taking a minute to gather his bearings before rushing downstairs while Thor gets Bucky, who's relatively harder to wake.
"Platypus?" Tony sits up, smile dropping. "Do you want me to get your heating pads? Or I cou-"
He's not sure he's ever gotten ready that fast in his life.
The line connects. "Mr Stark, how can I help you tonight... uh this morning?" Dr Park asks in his deep accented voice.
"No, you have
"Hey Riri, I don't think we've met."
"We have an eight seven point seven success rate, I'd hardly call that going wrong all the time," Thor huffs, coming over to peel Tony away from him.
"Like who?" Clint howls with laughter.
Things are complicated buddy, I didn't have a choice.
Time stretches on both too slow and too fast all at once, he's not sure how long they have to prepare for things on the ground, or how to navigate people into preparing themselves for a threat that may never come in their lifetimes, but he tries nonetheless. Ben, Charles and Stephen travel as envoys to meet the Inhuman king and queen, and share as much of the plans that might affect them, without giving too much away and compromising their position.
By the time Steve's snuffing out the joint after his last drag, Tony's drooling on his shoulder, an arm hooked through his. While this was certainly not the way he thought the night would go, Steve can't say he's disappointed.
He doesn't tell her about his discussion with Bucky, or his pathetically real feelings, or the fact that he
"It's not an option anymore, especially with both the Fantastic Four and the Defenders signing," Tony explains, remembering the talks he and Matt had been in for days now. "More countries have joined in the last six months because they feel more certain that hero teams aren't just going to come knocking their front doors down."
"I didn't!"
"I think I fucked things up, ans it's all your faults! I told you guys Sam should have been the one to talk to him!"
So much went on that I can't explain to you. Don't ever think that I don't love you Peter, or that you aren't important to me.

Tony had sustained more than internal trauma and superficial scars and scratches, his already weak heart and damaged sternum had taken the brunt of the damage Steve had done with the shield, with other organs and faculties failing and becoming more damaged in the time he was out in the cold. Not to mention the post-op trauma after having an emergency C-section done in the waiting room of a rural Siberian town‚Äôs local clinic.
"Yeah, we've been looking all over for you, we even called Nat."
"I just thought it was an interesting observation," Sam says nonchalantly, readjusting his hat on his head.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve shrugs out of Bucky's hold, his best friend collapsing against Nat in a heap of giggles, and downs another swig of beer before making his way over to the guy. Stealing a shot of...
peter gave me your number?
"No," Sam replies, levelling Bucky with another unimpressed stare. "Thor, Steve needs your laptop, his quiz closes in thirty and you know how his freezes."
"Mm, must be a Northern thing then," Tony said, amused at Steve's change in demure. "Say, where are those two knuckleheads? I owe them my thanks."
"Doing what?"
"Are you cutting me some of the profit for my labour and expertise?"
"Rhodey, I'm not stupid, I kn-"
The evening carries on with an air of playfulness as they moved to Steve's room after getting baked with Danny Rand, who (surprisingly) Tony
Tony slaps Steve's chest lightly. "I've been catching strays for no reason, at this point we'll just have to fight." Tony rolls his eyes at Steve beaming at him, sliding in beside Janet.
Steve makes Tony breakfast in bed, and at the end of his gym sessions, when Steve stumbles back home sore and exhausted, Tony takes to rubbing out his muscles while going over his semester projects.
"Bucky, can you shut up, please? I'm
Both Tony and the baby needed to rest and heal. If it meant Rhodey had to step up and deal with everything else, the questions from Ross and the media as to where Tony was, and how the actual hell Rogers had broken his band of misfits out of the Raft (Tony didn‚Äôt know about that one yet and Jim would keep it that way for as long as he could, all news stations were barred from being played on the television in the corner and Tony had been too out of it to protest), he would. Vision had taken the kids to Malibu, along with Barton‚Äôs wife Laura and their kids (how he had ended up with a saint like that was beyond Rhodes) to keep them safe and away from anyone getting bright ideas to strike with all the confusion going on. Pete and Harley might be missing school for a while but Jim had made sure to explain the situation and have them do the work online. His family would heal, and whether that took months or years, he would be the wall that they could count on to keep them safe and sheltered from the world.
"There isn't a next time because we're nev-" The front door slammed, and Steve pounded past the common room, a distinct red flush to his face. He didn't say a word in greeting to any of them, bounding up the stairs three at a time to get to his room faster.
"Do you think the rest of them are hiding out in Europe? I have some sources I can contact," Reed offers, meeting Tony's eyes with an understanding expression.
"So, did you want to brainstorm here and go down to the lab when we were ready, or can we grab a bite and head down now already?"
"As if that would stop them."
They'd never been this stilted or awkward around each other. Peter was so perfect, Tony sometimes found it hard to believe he came from him, that he hadn't built him in a lab with code and steel. They spoke one language, and when Harley and Jamie started talking, they joined them. Now though, Tony felt like he needed a translator, he and Peter never seemed to be on the same page anymore.
"What do you mean?"
A small part of him (that he would never admit to it, or even acknowledge) felt relieved that he was only a call or a text away from his dad, despite the anger and resentment he felt towards him. His therapist had told him to cut off where his limits stopped, to not stand by the door waiting for him to come home (metaphorically and literally), but Peter's sure that isn't what he was doing, right?
And with that, he shuts the door, furious whispers of "seriously, you jump right into a monologue?" followed by a dejected "I panicked!" rising from behind it.
Who do you think brought me here, and why would I be in a hospital if dad didn't know about it?
Harley is sketching at his desk, and trying
"Lie, simple as that. Tell him your battery is flat, or your service is down, whatever you can to kill contact between them for now." Sam goes over to coat closet, grabbing his jacket and making his way out of the house. "Just don't let them speak."
"Why would you do that?" Bucky asked urgently, wanting to club himself for lwtting the guys talk him into undertaking the task. Natasha would flay him alive if she found out about what he did.
"I thought you wanted to watch this movie," Steve grinds out, gripping the arm on his side of the lounger.
Tony undos the button of his jeans, sliding his zipper down slowly. His cock is half-hard through his boxers, springing up when he pulls the band down. Tony leans down to litter the head with kisses before taking him into his mouth wet and sloppy.
If he couldn't sleep, he might as get some work done.
From: Tony Stark
"Thirty years," Rhodey interrupts, a hand wrenching his legs out of the brace with way more force than necessary. "Thirty years I've known you, and in that time, I've learned how your brain works - how you think, how you act, what pushes you to do certain things, and even how you reason. But this," he shakes his head, determinedly not meeting Tony's eyes, "I don't understand this Tony, and frankly, I don't think I want to."
"A library?
"If you fell on your way home, why did Ben see you riding in with those farmers this morning?" Reed eyes him skeptically, arms crossed and close to that huffing and puffing he does when he's angry.
Riri shrugs a shoulder, sipping at her water. "Not really."
"Well, of course they would. You're the best around here."
"Is he visiting his mom? He said he'll take me to see her one day."
"One more won't hurt ya', and I'll handle anyone who got a problem with how you're spendin' your hard-earned gold."
I was too excited to not write?? Lol
"You're so thoughtful kiddo, give me a snuggle." And with that, they fall into a pile of giggles.
"I knew I should have gone to that fair."
"Then why are you going to dad for help when we're right here?" Thing Two asks, plopping down on Harley's bed. "We could make things happen for you, Harley, everyone loves cute kids, and I mean, look at us."
"I'll do it!" Harley shouts suddenly, spinning around and beaming at his pops. "I can go get them."
"Hey Jan, killer boots."
"Others who might react the same way, we might as well send an email at this point."
"That's good, what about movies? Anything you like out right now?"
Harley leans back in his chair, motioning for them to go on. "Fine, I'm all ears."
Tony manages to get to the stairs before he stumbles, crawling the rest of the way up and to Steve's room. It's some ungodly hour, but his longing had just gotten too much for him to handle, and all he wanted right now was for Steve to hold him.
By the time they're done accounting their plan, Harley can feel a fluttering of hope in his chest.
"Yeah, we've had computer science together since first year," Thor says, stretching his arms out over the back of the couch. "You should know that, Steven, we've been on the football team together for how long now?"
Tony is splayed out on his bed, tapping Steve's chest and scrolling through his insta feed as he waits for him to wake up. Jan is at some ski lodge with Rand and Drew, Ty's attending winter galas, Bucky and Nate are-
"If you feel like you want to repay me, you can tell me whether or not James talks about me." She smiles then, so openly and sincerely all at once that it's hard for Tony to look away.
Steve doesn't see Tony again until the next week.
"What does PC stand for anyway?" Rhodey asks, an eyebrow raised.
Harley suppresses his eyeroll, twirling more spaghetti onto his fork. "I'm going to light a small, but containable, fire in front of Peter's room, that way we smoke them out and Peter's forced to come out here with Riri," the boy deadpans.
He doesn't hit send.
"Yo! Where have you been, man?"
"'Your' Bruce?" Steve asks, smirking as catches on to what the other Blonde is implying.
"So he's my son when he's up to no good, but your son when he does something cool?" Tony teases, walking over to wrap his arms around Steve. "He's got a crush."
The US had always been greedy, had always

"He goes to Nat's, fills himself with a nice, warm meal and then heads upstairs to get serviced by one of her girls, sometimes he even goes by Clint's room."
"You said Johnny looks like me, what does that mean?"
"Rogers and his team," Matt picks up, "pose a problem though. They've been spotted sporadically, but when they do show up, it's usually in an Accords' ally's territories. Everyone knows they're not under the Accords purview, but it's making people nervous."
@themechanic
"Please what? Speak to me, use that huge brain of yours and tell me what's wrong, Tony."
"I have some heavy sleeping pills, but I don't want to give him that, is ibuprofen safe?"
"Well then, I thank her for her service - and cervix." Tony mock salutes, and bursts into a bundle of giggles.
"We'll see, Stark." And with that, he walks out, leaving Tony dejected with his response.
Too shaken to talk, Tony burrowed into his neck thankfully, shaking like a leaf in the large man's arms. Soon, two other bodies joined him, running reassuring hands through his hair and down his arms until his eyes closed, body finally giving in to sleep after the stress of the past hour.
You do come first. You guys are all I've ever wanted, even before Captain America.
"Yeah, yeah," Bucky dismisses, stretching himself out on the couch. "By the way, have you seen Nat? I lost her somewhere between beer pong and making out in Ty's roo-."
Thor signals him over, sliding over a bottle of pills and leaning over to ask, "What do you mean you don't remember last night? You headed up to your room pretty early with Anthony, I assume it ended well?"
"That's not what you were sayin' when you had that veal last week." Steve chuckles, admiring the splash of colour on Tony's cheeks. It made him more real, more
Steve is warm, and comforting, and everything perfect rolled into one human with a horrible fashion sense and a penchant for upsetting any tech he comes into contact with. Steve treats him far more gently than he deserves, and some tiny voice in the back of his mind hijacks things completely and does a rerun of his talk with Bucky.
Harley sighs, slinging an arm around his brother and leading him to his room. "Brother, have thee so little faith?" Harley asks, taking advantage of the two inches he had over his brother. "Is it so hard to believe that I'm a reasonable person who realised my intense approach wasn't working?"
"Of course he is, what are you doing up, honey?"
Tony jumps a bit at the voice that's materialised next to him, a hand bracing out to stop him from falling out of his chairm. "Oh, hey Bud. Of course, let me wake Pops."
Sitting down beside him, Nat shoved a stray lock of hair behind his ear. "You've been keeping to yourself lately, am I no longer important now that you go down to that farm every week?"
While he never really felt cold much these days, with the heat from the forge and a well-placed lamp and heap of blankets back at the hostel always consistent in his life now, he hadn't counted on being lost in the woods for hours, or for the rain to start back up and the dizzying experience of trying to see straight ahead of him once dusk had settled. Crying out, he slid down the side of a slope, landing face-first in the softened soil.
"She's so pretty, I didn't know what to say!"
His number one goal in high school is to be cool, which at the moment, he's failing at terribly. The only people who thought he was cool were his parents, and his best friend, Ned.
Riri does not end up having lunching with them, instead Peter hoardes her in his room, and locks Harley out in a move that definitely pushes Harley to break their code.
Tony smirks, quirking an eyebrow at Steve. "Is that so?"
"The council has options, so I doubt they want 'heroes' who caused an international incident just a few months ago." Sue's voice is cool as she comes over to lean against the table, reading the article over Tony's shoulder. "Says they struck a deal for blanket immunity."
Hope you guys enjoy, feedback is always welcome üòä
"That, or Captain Ass is getting nervous. No one's come calling for him yet, which definitely takes a hit at that huge ego of his," Matt supplies, sliding his glasses up his nose.
"And Here I thought you were a man of the Lord, Steven. Shame on you," Tony joked, poking him in the side.
"I don't know, really... things just seem a bit unreal, don't you think?"
Does your dad know? Why isn't he doing anything about this? He knows how bad it can get for you.
"Okay, meet back here at seven?"
Did we really mean so little to you?
"Let me help you carry that, Tony," Steve says when he meets him by the road. "What is all of this?"
There's still so much to do.
Rhodey is worried, as much as he tries to hide it. We‚Äôve known each other for years, and that particular frown meant Tony was the cause of it. What was worse, it was paired with The Stance‚Ñ¢ (though a different form of it since he was now in a wheel chair), his hand raised to cover his mouth and his body expanding to appear bigger than it was, as if to comfort him, or more appropriately protect him.
"No no, go back to sleep, Steve. Thanks for the company last night," Tony whispers with a little goofy grin, making his way out the door.
"So just cuddle up with Bruce while I get the others, okay?"
It was the first mention of Tony's past,
He took Tony by the hand, leading him to the wheelie chair Bucky and Sam had brought with coming in from town, and showed him the concrib and gearshed, and the springhouse where they kept the meat and dairy products. They rested under the shade of the barn when Tony got overwhelmed with the heat. "Isn't it supposed to be winter?"
Riri jumps in her seat, as two kids take the seats next to her, smiling innocently at her.
"Oh, sorry," the angel rushed out, grabbing a pitcher of water and sitting down next to Tony with the filled glass. "Here, let me help you up."
Tony rolls his eyes again, signalling for Remy to top him up. "Trust me, Natasha, if I take 'em to bed, it's not because I enjoy their company. A knot is a knot."
"Actually, Anthony is very popular with our classm-" Thor starts to say, getting cut off when Nat sends an elbow into his ribs.
"Congratulations, brother. I can't think of a more deserving couple."
A voice breaks his reverie. "Look who finally got off that farm of theirs to grace us with their presence." Nat was the picture of perfection as she came down the stairs, trailing a hand along the stair rail and over Bucky's shoulder as she came to stand behind him. "Where have you been, James? I've been lonely."
Steve nods stiffly, his eyes darting around nervously. "Ye-Yeah. 'S fine."
"You're not in trouble, kiddo," Tony rushes to reassure him, running a hand through his hair and over his ears. "We... haven't really talked much, huh?
Bucky sighs, staring up at the second floor miserably but taking the stairs two at a time, scared of what Thor might have said in the five minutes he had been alone with Steve.
"A lot more people will see the good in this, and we at least have a different viewpoint now."
Tony injects his thigh with the syringe, soothing the area with a wet cloth after. "You think I don't notice things but I do, and..." Tony hesitates, "I don't think I can hold my tongue anymore."
Enjoy, next chapter will be up much sooner (because I have my timeline written up :P)
"Disgusting?!"
"Run that by us again, Bud?"
Thank you for reading my loves, please let me know if you like the direction the story is going in.
They're both a little drunk and fumbling at each other's clothes, lips locked together, and the next thing either of them knows is Tony's laying in the back of Thor's van, leg hitched over Steve's hip and getting fingerfucked.
Struggling to form words with his dry mouth, Tony cleared his throat. "M'fine."
"Okay, Kid," Tony whispers, stepping back as the boy disappeared back into his room, door shutting behind him, and the feeling of a metaphorical door shutting between them too.
"That's it," Steve murmurs against his lips. "That's good, Sweetheart. I've got you."
"Steve's out of town, he wanted us to make sure you were sleeping enough, so come on, let's sleep enough."

Steve finally gets to sketch Tony's post-sex hair, and his bed hair, and wakes up one morning to a picture of Tony fresh out of the shower, a not-so-subtle
"I was thinking we needed the reinforcements," Tony says, drawing his legs up under him. "What's coming? What's out there? We're not prepared for
Steve takes his sweet time working up a satisfying pace, shallowly thrusting in and out before Tony grabs his ass and tries to fuck himself on Steve's dick. "Steve, I promise to God I'll get on top, ride you until I cum, and leave you here for Thor to find with the biggest, bluest balls in existence," Tony threatens. "I know how to make a DIY cock ring in under five minutes."
"And it's not good enough, Tony," Rhodey scolds, a pounding starting up behind his left eye. Tony wasn't dumb or naive, but letting the Black Widow set up camp anywhere near them was an ill-made decision. "Let's say she's not here for any malicious reasons, as she's claimed, did she tell them she was giving herself over to the feds? Tell me Tony, when the media catches wind of her return, is there a guarantee they won't just break into the facility and try to free her?"
"Thanks for having my back against these unnecessary attacks, Sam."
"Shy? So he sends the two of you to interrogate me?"
He stops in his tracks momentarily though, when he catches Sam's stink eye. Yeah, Steve might be violating their bro code right now, but he also can't remember the last time he's had sex, and Sam had flaked on him at the bonfire just last week, so this was just Steve getting even. And who even knows if this guy would be interested? Everybody just needs to chill.
"'That woman'," Tony says, making air quotes with his fingers, "used to be a friend. And she always looks out for herself, she's probably the only one of them who can be."
"What?" Steve asks, knocked out of his daydreams.
P.S. I'm editing this week, I promise!
Shuffling into the kitchen, Tony gets a pot out, searching the pranty for chocolate and grabbing a fresh carton of almond milk.
"So, I hear you've been robbing cradles."
"I have no other choice, Rhodey."
Before the two of them could continue carrying on, Steve interrupts, a lightbulb going off suddenly. "Hey, Thor, you share classes with Rhodes, right?"
"Did you have a nightmare, baby?" Tony coos, cradling her in his arms and grabbing her baby blanket. Immediately she starts mouthing at his chest, and he let's out a laugh.
Tony feels like he's unravelling a bit at the edges.
Despite feeling like his eyes are glued shut, and moving even an inch would cause his head to crack right open, he doesn't really want to pee in someone else's bed, or have to get his jeans surgically removed from his body.
"Whatever."
"So you start speaking like you're straight off Game of Thrones?" Tony quirks an eyebrow in question.
"Both?"
"You're crazy perceptive, Ri. You ever want to do bigger, give us a call." Sam slides a card over to her, and with that, they're both up and crossing the cafeteria.
"Tony," Rhodey starts, "I don't know what's going on in that mind of yours right now."
"No hard feelings..."
Before he can think to do either (and prove himself to be the weird loser half the school thinks he is), Riri steps forward, patting his back. "Hi Mr Parker, I'm Riri," she says hand outstretched, "and who's this cutie?" she continues, cooing at Morgan.
"Not that that matters," Thor starts, gingerly rubbing at his ribs, "our classmates aren't really known for attending parties like these."
"Dr Park, we have a Code Blue, and Peter seems to have a really high temperature," Tony informs the doctor, listing off his symptoms. "Can I bring him in right now, or should I try to let him sleep the worst of it off?"
Thank you babes, hope it wasn't too horrible. Let me know what you think, what you'd like to see, and if there are any tags that should be added or updated. Also, happy belated birthday to the Queen We Chose, Miss Emilia Clarke <3
Steve blushed furiously, and Tony has never seen a man turn that small in a matter of moments. "I don't think they do that down South either..."
"You'll be the first to know when the grapes ripen, or you should just come out here on weekends and help us work the field, since you're such a wine expert."
"Creepy, huh? Is this creepy too?" Reed jumps up, tickling Tony's sides.
On his first day, he grabs a handful of Tony's ass and gets a wooden block to the back of the head, and promptly doubles over in laughter, leading to a full day of Reed muttering about how all the people he takes in are always two fuses short.
"Okay, so he hasn't done it yet, we've still got time to speak to Tony and clear things up. You, steal Steve's phone in the meantime, and I'll go over to Tony's."
"Steve, pl-"
"So, you seem to know a lot of people here for a new kid," Steve pries as Tony runs his fingers over the spines of his books.
Peter corners Harley when they get back, pointing an accusing finger at him. "I know you're up to something Harley, just tell me what it is so that I can assess how dumb, dangerous or damaging it is."
"I missed you today," Steve says when he pulls away, both of them gasping for breath and a second away from devouring each other again. Tony says nothing, he keeps kissing Steve like a he's an oasis in the desert and Tony's a dying man.
"Are you asking or making a promise to me?"
"Yo, chill bro, let me get Thor's laptop and then you can finish up your work and we'll figure everything else out. Okay?"
The blonde man that towered over him broke out into laughter, shaking against Tony's back. "Change of plans," he announced, shoving Tony to the side. "We fuck the whore bloody after we give these farmer's boys a beating they'll never forget."
"Sure thing, Buckaroo. Are you sure Steve is getting back tomorrow?"
"We talk all the time."
Pete had chosen his own name when he had started transitioning, and damn if Tony hadn‚Äôt heard a more perfect name than Peter Stark, May had been a big help and as a nurse, gave Peter and Tony lessons on safe binding and the number of a good doctor that could help with T-shots (Tony had been happy he could share this journey with Pete and his own experience, despite how horrible it was but being able to say ‚Äúthis body is not my own‚Äù was the most freeing thing Tony had experienced in his 18 years of life). Tony hadn‚Äôt fully transitioned, had always felt like he was tip-toeing around in his own skin and couldn‚Äôt make that decision, not with Howard having a say about it and later Obie, who had said that it wasn‚Äôt the right time after his parent‚Äôs death (murder) and taking over the company, and then Afghanistan and the arc happened and any type of invasive surgery was off the table for him. When he had started doing better and the therapy had finally started working in his favour he hadn‚Äôt gotten the surgeries, not after Steve had mentioned having kids, with that look in his eyes were Tony became the centre of his universe, the natural way, of course. They had tried, and yes, maybe Tony should have done more introspection and taken his own feelings into account before jumping head first and trying to make Rogers happy, but Peter, perfect and healthy and strong, with a heart that beat stronger than anyone else‚Äôs Tony had ever heard, was born. He‚Äôd stopped getting his T-shots during the pregnancy, and perhaps had never felt worse in is life, what with the media instantly jumping and doing I-told-you-so pieces that Tony Stark had never been a man and that ‚Äúshe‚Äù was just confused (whether it was ‚Äúher‚Äù mother‚Äôs liberal nature or something picked up at MIT, ‚Äùshe‚Äù was just playing around in men‚Äôs clothes), I mean, why else would a real man lay down and take it like that. They had a lot to say about him and Steve was spared the media flogging, after all they didn‚Äôt know that Tony and Steve were together because what would anyone say if they knew dear old spangled pants was willingly jumping into bed with Tony. Harley, had been a slip up, but a wonderful one and Tony had just not cared about what anyone had to say, he didn‚Äôt care that people were still not using his pronouns or that religious groups were protesting against his company and his products, because surely he was the devil incarnate for choosing to ‚Äúconfuse‚Äù his kids like this. Harley had always been, well, Harley and Tony had always left the door open for him to choose (plus Steve named him and Tony should have really kicked his ass for naming his child after a damn motorcycle but he had been heavily sedated then and Steve had been smiling so brilliantly at him, like he was something amazing and important, though that could never be true, definitely not now and of course not before). Jamie had been the perfect gender neutral name honoring the shared name of his and Rogers‚Äô best friends (despite Steve still not quite grasping why they had needed to raise their kids in a gender neutral environment, because a boy was a boy and a girl was a girl, Tony - we‚Äôll just confuse them with all this talk of no gender, and hadn‚Äôt that hurt. Rogers had no problem sticking it in any one of Tony‚Äôs holes and having him, a man birth his children  but seemed to share that same attitude Howard had until Pete had come to them at dinner and said that he was a boy. Steve had had a little pinched smile and had excused himself, naturally Pete had taken that as rejection and had burst into tears and it had taken Tony hours to calm him down and get him to bed. After making sure all the kids were okay and in bed, he had found Steve in their bedroom with a laptop open and a frown between his brows. Tony knew (hoped) that Steve‚Äôs reaction was just one of shock and he hadn‚Äôt meant anything by it, but he was damn well going to apologise to Peter for hurting him, even if unintentionally. ‚ÄúI just- it doesn‚Äôt make any sense to me, Tony. You know how I was raised and back then, the only men dressing in women‚Äôs clothes were comedians or actors. J is getting me up to speed with understanding all of this though, and I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt do it sooner, I should have done more to understand you and how you felt, I know it‚Äôs been tough on you but I swear, I‚Äôve never seen you as anything but a man, and I‚Äôll do right by him,‚Äù he had rushed out with that kicked look he got when he didn‚Äôt do right by one of the kids (in his mind, because the kids definitely worshipped the ground he walked on, yes he was Captain America, but he was also Pops, the guy who tucked them in at night and told them he loved them every chance he got). Steve was nothing but supportive of Peter‚Äôs choice and had taken him for his first T-shot so that he could understand what his son was going through and what procedures he‚Äôd need. The amount of NDAs signed throughout Ton‚Äôs life, especially following his first pregnancy, was laughable but necessary, neither of them wanted to put a bigger target on their heads by proclaiming to the world, hey, Captain America has three bastard children through an unholy union with Tony Stark, of all people, because having super soldier DNA was definitely a beacon for any super-secret evil people with lairs in remote locations and big shiny machines that make you talk, and even now the lawyers were ensuring the hospital‚Äôs silence. How did thinking of baby names go down this rabbit role and end with him thinking of Steve, again. Rogers didn‚Äôt deserve to even be a split-second thought, it would take time, but one day Tony would burn any and all memory of him out of his head.
