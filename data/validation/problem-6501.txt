The 6 of them pack their stuff and go though, because each of them have family and other priorities to attend to. Sam is going to D.C. for a summer internship, Rhodey is going right along with him to basically be an errand boy for Pentagon big wigs, Pepper is clerking in Boston. Steve, Tony, and Bucky are going back home to New York. They part ways sunburnt and sentimental.
, you’re gonna make me come,” like it’s breaking her heart to say it, like she’s about to really fall apart. Her cunt is drooling all over his face and she tastes so fucking good. Steve is glad he hasn’t touched his cock because thinking about how easily he’ll slide past her swollen, soaking lips and inside her is the stuff of dreams. Toni’s knees tighten around his head and she just falls, suffocating him between her legs and the lovely folds of her pussy.
that night and it’s weird. They’ve been having sex since they first met, literally their relationship is based off of one good night of sex, but this is something entirely different. This time they go out to this fancy dinner with a bunch of rich people Tony knows from business and his childhood and college and then they go home completely sober, totally unlike a night with Steve’s friends, and they take off their cufflinks and suits. Steve hadn’t worn his nose ring out for the night and he feels a little naked without it, strangely enough, as Tony leans him back on the bed and spreads him out in all of his pale glory. Tony’s broad, tan hands grip bruises into his thighs and his lips leave wet kisses on Steve’s ankles. All the attention has him shaking a little but he makes no move to get away. He’s never had sex with anyone this way; he’s never felt like he was going to melt straight through the bed with each touch and caress.
Clint rolls his eyes, “Yeah you’re in love with him. You saw God with the help of the splendid p-plundering-,” he burps,  “-of his cock, yadda yadda, people are dyin’,” he states irritably. Steve is drunk and warm with it and gives zero fucks about Clint being annoyed.
“Everything’s just so wonderful right now,” Steve sighs dreamily. Sam looks to Kate Bishop and mimes shooting himself in the head. In reply she does a very deft and surprisingly accurate mimed rendition of hanging herself. The whole group watches in morbid fascination as she does so.
The man grins, a sharp easy thing that reminds Steve of an ex sex partner he was particularly fond of, “You look desperately out of place, lost even, if you will. I thought I’d make myself a familiar face for you to latch onto.”
Tony’s own graduation is a less extravagant affair, but he doesn’t mind. His mom and Howard had come when he got his bachelor’s so he doesn’t feel slighted when they don’t make it for this one. Jarvis comes down though and he nearly cries. Steve comes too, of course, along with Pepper and Rhodey. They go out for lunch as well and there aren’t as many loud voices and boisterous laughter but it’s very nice. At the ripe old age of 24 Tony finally feels like he’s content with his life. There probably isn’t a better time to propose, right? When you feel secure in your relationship and you’re stable and everything is going swimmingly. That’s when you propose.
“I’m just happy,” he shrugs, beaming. He adjusts his bow tie, looks at himself in the mirror proudly. It’s true.
“Hi,” Tony demures, “I’d kiss you but I’d rather not take a trip to the hospital and explain the second degree burns all over your cock.”
and Steve’s face would crumble in on itself like a building or a broken glass. His eyes would fill with fat, sad tears, his mouth would turn down at both corners and that little line between his brows would be so deep and unfortunate.
If he suffocated between Toni’s legs, Steve would die a happy man. There was just something about her, something about the way she moaned and twitched and writhed that satiated a primal, hungry part of Steve that he didn’t want to acknowledge even existed. Plus she tasted so good; oh, and all that sticky wetness would drip down his chin sometimes. That’s how wet Toni gets. And her little bush was so cute. And fuck if he didn’t love the way she reacted when he sucked on her clit; she would jerk and cry out and even
Tony runs out of excuses after graduation. He has his master’s from MIT, is already considering whether he’s going back for his doctorate’s, and Steve has graduated with his bachelor’s. Their ceremonies are a week apart and that means Tony gets to come to Brown and sit with Steve’s mom and Sam’s and Bucky’s families to cheer them on. When Steve walks across the stage his face is bright red, but he’s smiling so hard Tony thinks his face may crack in half. Sarah Rogers is a tiny little woman but she makes a bigger fuss than all three of Bucky’s sisters put together when her son finally has his moment. He can’t blame her; he’s whooping and screaming too. Proud doesn’t even begin to describe how he feels. When the ceremony is over Steve rushes over and picks them both up, swinging them excitedly in his arms.
“As a general rule, no,” he chuckles. Feeling vengeful, Rogers unbuttons his trousers with one dexterous hand and slips it into his briefs. As soon as her fingers make contact with his sensitive cock Tony lets out a very manful yelp. She toys with the head expertly, stroking her index finger through a drop of precome beading at the slit and leaning back to pop that finger in her mouth and suck. The noise Tony makes after that is pure need and he surges forward to capture her mouth in a bruising kiss, she nearly doubles backwards with the force of it. Rogers moans into the kiss, her hand going back to his dick, which stands at attention now between them, looking obscene against the backdrop of their formal wear.
Tony can’t even feel his hands when Steve takes them in his own. He can barely hear what his husband to be is saying because the rush of his own blood is pounding in his ears like a bass line. This is the moment Tony has imagined so many times, the few glorious seconds he has to tell Steve exactly what he means to Tony, what their relationship has done for his life. He has two very important words to say as well—words that he’s spent years agonizing over. Tony has dreamt it a million times with various different outcomes, like he had run the simulation as many times as possible.
Toni would never admit it, but this is like a treat for her. She sucks dick like a champ, has basically no gag reflex, and relishes showing off all the tricks she knows. She’ll look up at Steve, her amber eyes glinting with mischief as she laves at the head of his dick, coaxing precome out of his slit, and smile like she’s really getting a kick out of it. He’s had her fuck herself on toys while she sucks him off, making herself come with no help from him at all. Steve has it on good authority that Toni absolutely loves giving oral. But more than anything she likes receiving it. Toni sees giving head as a favor, a demonstration of devotion, something she does for Steve to relax him and make him happy, and the idea that someone would do that for her is not one Toni likes to dwell on. She could teach a course in self-flagellation, and that’s coming from a World War II era Catholic; Toni doesn’t think anyone would want to do something for her for the sole sake of making her happy. But she loves having Steve’s tongue on her, she loves the shivery feeling he gives her when he slides a finger or two into her hole. She loves the noises he makes too, loves that he could stay down there for hours, and that he can hold his breath longer than the average person. Steve just gives so much when he goes down on her, and Steve knows that it’s for these reason that she rarely asks for it or even suggests it. If he goes down on her before sex, that’s one thing, but it’s a whole different situation if he spreads her out with the sole intention of making her come with his mouth until she’s walking funny. What’s even scarier for her is when he has her sit on his face; and that’s why they reserve it for date night. That way Toni knows, without a single doubt, that she’s getting treated and she doesn’t have to ask or feel selfish. She knows Steve will be so good to her, will go to town on her and even grab her a nice big glass of wine between rounds.
Tony pauses, “And I want you there. I don’t wanna not see you for 17 days. Plus, who better to keep me in check in Cali then a no nonsense fella like yourself?”
“Why Tony? It’s not a bad thing! I’m not insulting you by saying it’s adorable that you’re literally
. Tony does more than borrow trouble; Tony makes trouble. The way he’s eyeing Steve is trouble, the way he lets his arms hang limply at his sides and offers himself up is trouble. Steve’s heart is pounding and a hot, mean arousal is sitting in his gut. He wants to ruin Tony, wants to make him cry right here in the workshop, wants to watch him fall apart because Steve made him. Reunions always make him more possessive than usual and Steve just can’t help himself when he tightens his hold on Tony’s hair even further and drags him over to the couch tucked into the corner of the room. Tony follows obediently, a smile spreading across his face.
"I know the place and the people. I'll be perfectly safe, and I'll be more efficient when I don't need to worry about any of you standing out in the crowd," Natasha said, as convincingly level-headed as always.
"We should, but Steve," Natasha said, both her voice and her expression somber, "we can't rush this. Crabb Castle isn't just the largest town in the North, it's where they train their guerillas. They'll outnumber us a dozen to one. We'll have to plan this rescue very carefully, or we'll end up imprisoned together with Tony."
Later that afternoon, Obie shows up. Tony supposes it's to chew him up for still not getting his act together.
"So, soulmates are real, then," Steve said conversationally, the next time Director Fury showed up to check up on him.
It was the deepest, most devastating silence Steve had experienced, and he would've given anything to hear Tony's voice again, even one word, to know that he was alright.
As fast as he's been moving, daylight is turning to twilight when he makes it to the top. Most of the valleys are shrouded in shadows. Unsurprisingly, he can't spot any human settlements, just more hills and lakes. Then again, with these lighting conditions, he can't see very much detail. There could be a whole village hiding in plain sight, if they happened to have the lights turned off.
Fury had assured him that the wire he wore—a combination of contact lenses and an in-ear unit no larger than the head of a pin—would be undetectable no matter what kinds of sensors Ultron had. He'd just have to trust that.
"No, but it definitely wasn't home," Jan said. "He got a call from Pepper—Miss Potts—and told her he might not be coming back before the evening."
"Of course. We can talk about the details of the job tomorrow morning, once you've had time to settle in. I've got some appointments in the afternoon, and I'd like you to accompany me. For now, I've got a floor set up for you. Pepper?" Tony called out.
He should've thought of building something like this ages ago, although it would've been challenging without such a convenient power source.
Steve's bedroom, like most of his apartment, was utilitarian. The window wall that doubled as a projection surface was currently showing a sunset sky with a few wispy clouds instead of the actual view outside. The other walls were plain gray and undecorated, except for the painting at the head of the bed. It was one Steve had painted himself, a romantic Appalachian landscape imitating the Hudson River School style, with an American flag at the forefront; a reminder of times when such symbols meant more than corporate logos. Tony often made fun of it. Today, he seemed too interested in Steve's frame to pay attention to the familiar surroundings.
Tony's own stance was the only reasonable one: that it was all nonsense, like every other bullshit paranormal idea out there. Studying these things was a waste of time and money. This had been Tony's opinion since he'd been old enough to understand the concept. His dad's ridiculous beliefs had fueled the fire of his annoyance. Dad had always said he and mom were soulmates. Mom had played along, but Tony had never been sure whether she'd believed it or not. Whichever the case, a fat load of good that had done to them. From Tony's point of view, his parents had been miserable together.
"I know we've always struggled to get along," Steve goes on. "From the very start. After we survived that first disaster with Loki, I thought things were looking up, but it wasn't that easy. It never is, with stubborn people like us. You probably thought I was insufferable. Maybe you never liked me very much. I could never be sure. Honestly, it's not easy to tell whether you're being affectionate in your own way, or just an asshole—hm?"
"Not really, no," Steve agreed, keeping his tone as light as Tony's. The excited energy between them was palpable; his heart was hammering against his ribs, and whether that was because Tony had been nervous or Steve was growing more so by the second, he couldn't tell. Not that it even mattered, the way their moods were merging together now that they allowed it.
Tony grimaced. "I'm sorry about that. I really am. In my defense, I thought you'd feel more at home with your own face. I had nothing to do with the rest of it," he said, actually sounding more sad and apologetic than defensive. "I don't think Obie cared about the details, either. The clinic probably used a standard template from the neck down."
If Tony was alive, they would have to come up with some way to infiltrate the Tower, something they hadn't dared to attempt even when they'd had all the tech in Tony's workshop at their disposal. If he wasn't—if Tony was dead, then Stane had won, and going after him would be nothing but a pointless quest for revenge.
Jan was a fashion designer and a style icon, and had been as well known as Tony before the war. Her townhouse also equaled Tony's, when it came to lavishness, but was decorated with paintings and sculptures instead of mementos from around the world. The suite she was currently living in was, if anything, even more luxurious, matching the extravagance of the entrance floor. Steve guessed they wouldn't even have let him in if he'd been wearing the regular street clothing he went for when not in costume. Luckily, Captain America was welcome anywhere, whatever the dress code.
After the rough start, Steve and Rhodey get along well, just like Steve and Pepper. Overall, Steve is very easy to get along with, thanks to his pretty smiles and his sly humor. Out of the people Tony introduces him to, the only one who doesn't seem to like him very much is Obie, and that's not to do with Steve, but what he represents.
Of course Bucky would see right through the synthetic facade. Bucky himself was in his own body for this mission, the one Steve had known since they'd been kids. Steve trusted him more than anyone, with the possible exception of Peggy. Which wasn't to say that he didn't trust the rest of his team; he would give his life for any of the Howling Commandos, and he knew they'd do the same for him. Peggy had said he could give a heads-up to those team members that he could trust, and that included every single one of them. If there was anything he could do for his own team, he should. Rumlow's team was a different matter—Rumlow seemed to enjoy the brute raids all too much.
Her smile grew wider at his eagerness. "I do, indeed! He finally gave in and promised to work for us."
He travels around several smaller hills, and stops to drink when he comes across a stream in a valley. The water is cold and tastes perfectly clean. It's too bad he doesn't have a bottle to carry some with him, but considering the number of lakes and rivers he saw from above, this is just a slight inconvenience.
Next on the agenda is breakfast. He's made his camp close to a small lake, and he's hoping to catch some fish, because that's the easiest source of calories he can think of out here.
"Sounds like the way to go, yes," Steve agreed. Maybe someday, he'd be more at ease letting his two personas overlap. Right now, he was just relieved that Tony didn't press the matter.
The mention of his old team stung like a dagger between the ribs. Steve could go after them. He should go after them. "Do you know where Bucky is? Agent Barnes, from my Commandos?"
"You don't remember me, do you?" he asked Steve, reaching out to place his hand on Steve's shoulder, giving it a squeeze. "James Rhodes. An old friend of Tony's. Even older than you, believe it or not."
He placed one elbow against the seat to push himself up. That was a mistake; right away, the headache went from a vague background nuisance to a brilliant, fiery agony inside his skull. He brought his free hand up to rub at the back of his neck, which felt bruised from the inside out.
He couldn't help throwing his head back again, his spine arching. Iron Man shifted out of the way, so Steve wouldn't bash his nose in, and as he did, his lips found their way to Steve's neck, below his jaw, licking and sucking, like he was so lost in the moment he didn't care if Steve could see his face.
"Hey! It's not nonsense!" Howard complained. "They're using perfectly valid scientific methods. You can't put all basic research on hold because of the war, or we'll regress back to the Dark Ages. Anyway, isn't this what we're fighting for? We need the world to be peaceful and safe again, so we can go home and be with the people we love. Maybe have a chance of finding those soulmates."
"Not mine, either," Steve admitted. "What brings you here tonight, then, if you don't mind me asking?"
A moment too late, Steve realized he'd been gaping at Tony for long enough that Tony had noticed, and was looking back at him curiously.
Jarvis stopped at the top of the stairs—which brought them to a cozy common area with couches, embroidered pillows and wall tapestries—to cast a glance at Steve from beneath his bushy eyebrows. "We've started, yes, but let's just say you should definitely unpack that rucksack. Pepper and Natasha will need several more days to get here. The last I heard, they were all the way south on the Dragonfly Coast. Besides, we can't set out without knowing where we're going, and I don't know where to start. Most of the northern seaboard is under the Northerners' control, and even the Plains are something of a no man's land."
Rhodey shakes Steve's hand, then casts a glance at Tony. Tony shrugs back at him. Steve definitely seems to have more of an attitude than he would have expected from CyberLife's creations.
"Oh? What's up? Unexpected business trip?" Rhodey asked, visibly surprised. Tony might generally be useless at keeping his booked appointments, but he'd been very careful not to miss any time with Rhodey, so he was definitely breaking the pattern here.
He remembers how beautiful its face was until he turned off the artificial skin and split open its metal-and-plastic skull to see which components were intact and useful.
It doesn't take long for the news media to start reporting about the return of Captain America and speculating about the identity of this mysterious man fighting side by side with the equally enigmatic, armored Iron Man. Many people suspect that Iron Man is an android. Almost no one thinks that Captain America might be one. Maybe it's because of all the history behind the name, and because of how perfectly he lives up to the reputation, fearless and remorseless against his enemies, kind and considerate towards civilians.
He knew that the cold was one of the worst threats out here, but he'd been so sure that Tony would reach the hut—and really, Tony was very close, which makes it all the more tragic that he faced his end like this, alone out here, while Steve was enjoying the cozy warmth less than a mile away. Worse yet, the time that Steve spent looking for Tony after hearing his shout can't have been much longer than an hour. If only he'd spent less time hesitating, and if he'd happened to choose a different route, things could have been very different.
No doubt there will be many more difficult conversations to come. Still, right now, Steve is pleased with the first step that they've taken, and he'll gladly focus on that.
Tony has no idea what to do or how to feel about this whole situation, in general. He's really not dealing with it. It's way too early for this. Not that it'd ever be the right time.
So far, things had gone as smoothly as they could've hoped, and Natasha's warnings of an army of Northerners seemed unwarranted.
Iron Man pressed a kiss on Steve's cheek—there was a ticklish feeling there revealing that he had facial hair, maybe a moustache—and then pulled back his head, settling with his forehead against the back of Steve's skull. Then, he went back to his exploration; while his right hand stayed on Steve's nipple, teasing, his left hand continued to map every square inch of Steve's skin in featherlight touches, first only above his waist, until finally, finally, he let it pass over Steve's hip bones, to his thigh, and then to his cock, only just brushing against the shaft.
His mind made up, he got out of bed as noiselessly as he could and crossed the slumbering town to the dungeon. He felt like he should be sneaking around on tiptoe, even though he knew there was no need for that. He was considered one of the regular wardens, and the guards at the dungeon entrance just nodded at him as he passed them. He did his best to keep his face neutral, ignoring the sweat on his palms.
"What could he possibly do with that information?" Bucky asked back, annoyed. If they wanted to win Stark over to their side, surely they'd be better off trying to get on friendly terms with him.
Steve had asked, only half joking, if he could also learn to ride a skybax. Sam had told him, also in a light tone, that training usually began at a young age, but that exceptions had sometimes been made for exceptional individuals, which Steve certainly was.
"You know me so well," Tony said sardonically. "You must be over the moon about this, right? You always thought it's such a romantic idea."
In the morning, he woke up from a deeply inappropriate dream in which Tony had returned to the bar later. He'd led Steve to the corridor at the back, where one of the doors had opened into his bedroom. It'd been just as luxurious as Jan's suite at the Waldorf Astoria, with velvet curtains and silk sheets that'd felt very smooth against Steve's skin when he'd settled down on the bed. Tony had unzipped his coveralls, revealing he wore nothing at all under them, and had eagerly started to undress Steve—
Tony straddled Steve's thighs again. He used one hand to push Steve down by the chest while the other went for the lube. With all his attention on Tony, Steve had been starting to soften, but a few brisk, rough strokes of Tony's lubed fist quickly brought him back to his impressive full hardness again.
Tony shifted slightly, as if to move away. "Alternatively, I could just get you another beer," he offered. Just like last time, he'd quickly jumped to the conclusion that Steve's hesitation was leading up to rejection.
There was a blinding flash of light and an ear-splitting boom, and in the fraction of a second before the pressure wave knocked him out, he had just enough time for the regretful thought that if Steve made it, he would probably blame himself for Bucky's death.
Tony spent the days after the firefight lying low, having canceled the meetings he'd had on his schedule. Steve counted that as yet another sign of how different this Tony was from the one he used to know—he would've expected a more proactive approach. Then again, Tony seemed convinced they already knew who the culprit was. He insisted that Hammer must've been behind the attack, and was visibly annoyed that the police wouldn't just detain him since the murderous drone had a Hammer International logo on it.
Leaving that without comment, Steve accepted the piece of clothing and wrapped himself up. It was made of the same luxurious, shimmery fabric as his boxers.
"Trusting people isn't easy for me, these days," Tony said. His hand felt cool, trembling ever so slightly under Steve's. "In this case, though, maybe it's worth the risk."
Bucky pursed his lips. He couldn't just pretend that everything was fine, start making new friends and go on with his life. He'd feel like a liar. "We should talk first. Just you and me."
Steve managed to catch hold of Natalie to ask her a few questions, and her story was in line with everything Tony had said, and what Steve had seen. Regarding the shooting incident, her answer was also cautiously supportive of Tony's opinion. "I don't know him that well, but I've seen nothing to suggest he'd want to do such a thing," she said. "You should ask Pepper, though, she knows him a lot better."
Iron Man did, tracing the length of Steve's cock in the same cautious way he'd been touching everything else, then smearing the pre-come at the tip all over his shaft, and wrapping his fingers around it to give it a tentative stroke. It was nothing at all like the rough way Steve would touch himself when jacking off, and yet, it felt a thousand times more exciting.
By the time Steve had made his gently teasing way down to below Tony's waist, and straightened up to shift to a better position on the edge of the chaise, Tony was as hard as Steve had ever seen him—definitely saying something about how sensitive his new body currently was. He moved both hands to rest on top of Tony's hip bones, and Tony canted his hips, seeking friction where there was none, and letting out a frustrated moan. Steve imagined it wouldn't take much to push him over the edge. He was awfully tempted to wrap his fingers around that brand new and yet familiar cock to find out if it felt the same, or to lick and suck on the tip of it, with this mouth that hadn't touched it yet, but he thought it was a little too soon for that. Besides, he wanted to see how far he could get without touching it.
"Ed," Steve said, starting to grow frustrated. "He didn't give a last name. He told me he was a mechanic. That's honestly all I learned about him. Please, he said he was in some kind of trouble—can you tell me if he's all right?"
"Okay? What's that?" Steve asked, turning to face Tony properly. He'd been trying to figure out a way to bring up the conspiracy himself, and he couldn't help but wonder if Tony knew already and wanted to talk about it, too.
Tony made an unhappy face at the mention of the people who threatened the centuries of peace on Dinotopia. "Eh, they don't usually risk venturing so far inland. I'd be more worried about the carnivores inhabiting the Basin, if I were you—or if I were a Northerner, really. That's their territory, and it takes skill to negotiate with them. They're as smart as the rest of the dinosaurs, but those old predatory instincts are strong."
Could it be as simple as that? For all Tony's worries that something was irreparably wrong, was this only the awkwardness of that unbidden hard-on?
Stark seemed to be struggling to catch his breath, one hand clutching at his chest. His eyes, though glazed with pain, found Bucky, and he made a small "ah" of disappointment.
When his teeth start chattering, he has to admit he can't sit here much longer, even though the thought of standing up again makes him want to scream.
"I can tell that they're creative, for one thing. That's what's got me so unnerved. The first attack was entirely straightforward. They'd managed to implant a bomb in one of my limos," Tony said, walking as he spoke. He stopped to stare at the morning traffic outside of the transparent walls, hands clasped behind his back. "Exploded in mid-air, sent my remains and bits and pieces of car raining down on those poor bastards on the ground. Of course, I don't remember that myself. Totally demolished my backup node. Had to go for an external backup from the previous night."
That was what kept Steve coming back to Tony, even though he had his reservations about the relationship itself: there was a thrill to it that had remained after over a year of time spent together. The sex was always great, and doing it in different frames kept it novel. It was something of a kink for both of them, one most people wouldn't be into. On top of that, there was always the furtive nature of the affair, the risk that someone might catch sight of them together and share a video clip with the world. In fact that had already happened a few times, but with Steve's ever changing appearance, people hadn't known he was the same person all along and were left guessing who Tony's latest conquest might be.
Tony had provided Steve with weaponry beforehand: he now wore a shoulder holster with a regular projectile-shooter and a top-of-the-line plasma blaster similar to the one Tony had shot himself with. Neither of them would be of much use in a battle against an army of drones.
"SHIELD files list him as missing," came the answer in a relaxed, almost drawling voice. "Some sightings over the past years, here and in Europe, but current location is unknown."
“You know them already,” Tony said. His voice had gone soft and tired, his eyes closed. “J told you.”
It didn't take him long to bring Steve to the edge, both figuratively and literally—leaning back to push his hips forwards, he wasn't far from slipping off his perch, his free hand clinging to the cushion beneath to stay in place.
Tony steps away from Rhodey and raises his hands in surrender. "No! No, I swear I don't. I love androids. Honestly. My best friend is an AI! No offense, Rhodey. You're also my best friend. I'm allowed to have more than one." He shuts his mouth before he can make this any worse. He's already gone for the stupidest defenses invented by mankind.
"I'm sure you do, Mr. Steve Working-odd-jobs, with army issue shorts," Tony said shrewdly. Steve couldn't believe Tony had even noticed that. He clearly didn't miss much.
"Maybe he was," the man admitted, "but that's none of your business. He wanted a word with the boss, I arranged that for him. If I'd known how that'd go, I would've thought twice about it."
Tony curled his bare toes against the floor. "No, you did that, what was it, a couple of weeks ago?"
He straightened up, crossing his arms, looking each of his teammates in the eye: Rhodey and Pepper, who had been Tony's steadfast friends for a much longer time than Steve, and Sam, who hadn't known any of them until he'd been sent to Tony's house as a messenger a few months ago, but who had since them proven himself as stalwart as anyone Steve had served with.
"Seriously though, I must've shorted you out somehow, that wasn't normal," Tony prodded Steve's chest with his forefinger. "An orgasm isn't supposed to make you, I don't know, dissociate, or whatever that was. It was beyond subspace. It was like your mind went away entirely."
Tony made it sound like that had been a major motivation behind all his adventures, but that wasn't something that'd been in his magazine. Steve had never heard that there'd been anything wrong with him. And whatever it had been, it was obviously in the past now; after the Fountain, he seemed to heal faster than anyone Steve had met.
"More neutral than good, I guess, but there haven't been any strange fires since the one you went to see yesterday," Bucky offered.
"We've successfully converted his mind into digital form, with minimal loss of memories. The next thing will be to find out what frame he'd like to be placed in," she told them.
"Fine, take me there, then," Steve ordered. It wasn't surprising; lots of towers had arrangements like this, setting apart different sections.
He wasn't at all sure how he was going to make it through the conversation in such a way that he could keep things professional, but still convince Tony to trust him and talk to him honestly. He'd just have to play this by the ear, and hope for the best.
Jarvis actually smiled at that. "Since before he learned how to tie his own tie. You'd be hard pressed to find anyone who knows him better."
When he sets off again, retracing his steps around the lake, he realizes that with all the time he's spent on food, he might not make it to the hut by the end of the day. Then again, since the sun doesn't set and he's not particularly tired, there's no reason for him to stop for the night. Besides, the faster he moves, the more likely he is to get to the hut before Tony. Maybe he can avoid an awkward second encounter altogether.
Before the Accords tore them apart, he'd often regretted that they hadn't become closer. Deep down, he'd carried feelings for Tony that he hadn't been brave enough to admit even to himself.
If he truly had been working for the wrong side all along, he had to make the right choice now while he still could. He was afraid he'd been so overly honest with the Mayor that she'd grown wary of him. Tomorrow, she might decide to take away his keys to the cells. With them, he'd lose any hope of helping Stark, and of learning the whole truth about Dinotopia and the resistance.
Bruce's eyes went wide, and Tony thought there might've been the slightest flash of green in there. "Oh, no. No. Tony, that's a terrible idea," he said hurriedly. "We haven't even figured out the molecular pathways behind the synchronization phenotype. There's no way to know what kind of side-effects tampering with those sequences would have. Besides, you wouldn't know which tissues to target. You might need to deliver your hypothetical gene therapy to every single cell."
"Sure, and that's fine. I was just thinking, if it's like that, is it safe for you to be sitting here like this, in plain view?" This was something Steve had been wondering about; he hadn't been expecting to find Tony in the first room he walked into.
"You've jumped to some completely wrong ones before, but this time, I think you've got the right idea," Steve said.
Steve was the first one to get up, on guard for any signs of hostile activity. There was nothing. He looked around, taking in the destruction around them. The room was littered with broken glass from the windows, and he spotted one waiter unmoving on the ground. He was hopeful that it might be only a frame death, with no node damage.
Stark instructed Bucky where to set him down, seated in front of some specific collection of machinery. Bucky had no clue what any of it was for, and Stark didn't stop to explain, just went straight to work, no doubt moving as fast as his badly strained breathing and visibly shaking hands allowed.
"Okay, I can do that," Tony mumbled. He pried his eyes open and rolled over to his side so he was facing the room.
"It's all we've got, unless you have something better to offer," Jarvis said. Steve thought there was a strange edge to his voice, and the look he gave her was very sharp.
"Huh. I seem to be popular today. You're the second person who's been looking for me," Tony noted. "And I think there might be a few more out there."
It took two more days until the docs allowed Tony to return to recuperate in his own quarters. Steve suspected it might've been longer in most other circumstances, but since the distance from his hospital room to his own room amounted to a few floors, Tony could easily return for whatever follow-up tests they wanted to run. Steve couldn't blame the doctors for being cautious. What'd landed Tony in the med bay was entirely unprecedented, after all.
"Not really, no." Steve wondered if he should, for further insight into the case. "One or two issues, way back before the war. Why?"
He kept telling himself he'd done his best in what had been an utterly fucked-up situation, but he didn't really believe it. He should've done better. If he'd gotten through to Steve so that Steve would've accepted that olive branch, he could've prevented most of this.
"That's really not necessary," Tony said, waving a dismissive hand in the air. It would've been more effective if he hadn't looked like he'd been through the wringer.
Steve shrugged, knowing that there'd be a camera somewhere that would pick it up. "I have no idea what you're talking about. Are you going to take me home or not?"
Steve doesn't want to turn his back on Tony again, even briefly, afraid that he will take a turn for the worse while Steve isn't there, but he has no choice. He has to find a way to get in touch with the outside world.
Tony had figured out the Northerners' problem with the ancient technology the moment he'd stepped into the Vault. They lacked a power source. All those machines were built to run on a specific type of sunstone, and without one, they were useless. He'd seen transmitter stones and a beacon stone in the Vault, but no power stones, which was what they'd need. Luckily, Tony wore a lead-lined metal plate over his when not charging it or using it to power his armor; otherwise, even the broken pieces of old machinery in that room might've reacted to its presence.
The Mayor reached over the table to pat Bucky's good shoulder. "I consider myself a good judge of character, and I like what I've seen about you. Now, let's get started with the next part of this operation. Go find Brock, and the two of you bring Stark to the Vault. I need to explain to him why he's here."
The receptionist chewed her lip and shook her head. "Sorry, I don't think I've seen anyone like that. It's been pretty quiet recently, anyway."
He procrastinates some more with grooming and choosing clothes. He ends up picking a hoodie that's excessively thick for the weather, to be sure it will hide the thirium-blue glow in his chest. What he'd really like to do would be to wrap himself in aluminum foil or possibly wear a lead vest to make sure absolutely nothing gets through, but those aren't exactly things that he's got in his wardrobe.
"I'll see what I can do. You just rest, and hopefully you'll feel better soon," Bucky said, leaving Stark's speech without comment, and backed out of the cell. He made sure to lock the door behind him.
He would find out as soon as he could. He'd find his friends, and together, they'd find this mysterious enemy.
He'd already thought he'd lost the Avengers a year ago, when he'd taken a step back. He'd thought he'd let go of Steve. He hadn't, not really, not back then. Now, he really had.
"Wrong answer," Tony said, his fingers digging deeper, his other hand joining the first around Steve's neck.
"I'd like that," Steve said. "As long as you don't mind that I'll go to bed early, and by bed I mean actual sleep."
He'd meant to drive over to the police headquarters next, but the more he thought about it, the more convinced he became that it was a bad idea. He knew Bucky would be curious about what had happened and whether he'd found Tony again. He didn't want to lie about it, but he didn't want to tell the truth, either. Bucky knew that Steve liked men and was fine with it, but that wasn't the issue here. The issue was Steve choosing the entirely wrong man to like. Bucky admired Steve and looked up to him, and he wasn't sure if he could look Bucky in the eye so soon after last night.
They didn't have any further tyrannosaur encounters; Tony assumed that was mostly because he'd convinced the one they'd met to leave them alone, and either they were still in her territory, or she had gotten word to others that this specific party was too risky to approach. That was good. Even if fighting a
He'd been injured before in the line of duty, but it'd never felt like this; this felt like he must be dying.
Tony eased up a little, and pushed at Steve's chest with one hand. "On your back. I want to see you properly," he demanded.
There were very few people Steve would allow to see him when he was like this, but here was one of them. Iron Man, his first and best friend in the future. The one he'd wished, once upon a time, he could be more than friends with, but when he'd taken the bold step and actually asked him, those dreams had been instantly crushed. Iron Man had said that he would love nothing more, but he couldn't. His secret identity was too important to him. He couldn't get involved. Not ever. Not even with Steve.
Tony eyed it with distaste, but eventually pulled it on with a resigned huff. "If it's the price I have to pay to ride this beauty, so be it. I'm amazed they let you fly this thing at all. Probably breaks every modern safety regulation."
He hadn't told the other people in the resistance about his past, about growing up as an army brat, let alone his secret work by Captain America's side. Somehow, maybe just because Stark's voice reminded him of radio plays, and his resilience had made an impression, Bucky almost felt like giving him a few details, but he remembered the Mayor's words. He'd been told over and over again not to trust Stark. How stupid would he feel if he went against everyone's advice, and then got into trouble because of it?
Steve wasn't sure he'd ever been this hard from touches that were so light and cautious, but then, this wasn't like any other sexual encounter he'd ever had. This was Iron Man, the friend who understood him almost perfectly even without words, the one he'd trust with his life without hesitation. Iron Man, still wearing most of his armor, his arms covered in golden mesh up to the wrists, the legs stretched out next to Steve's wearing boots of shiny red metal.
"No need to thank me," Tapio replies modestly. "For Captain America and Iron Man? It was the least I could do."
"Good. What I'm telling you mustn't leave this room," she went on. "We never had this conversation."
Steve was grimacing; the idea of what Tony might've loved to do when Steve was still in costume was exciting and shameful at the same time. He tried to ignore the note of excitement. That just wasn't right.
Steve was starting to wonder if this case was exceptionally tricky, or if he was just very bad at this detective business.
"Probably nowhere close to us. I can stay up here and keep an eye on the situation. You go join the others," Natasha suggested, her hand on his bicep.
Goddamn. Without even reading it, considering Rhodey's call and that subject line, Tony had a fairly good guess for what it might say.
Tony had to cough to clear his throat before he managed to answer her, still sounding stifled. "What is it?"
"Eh, that's okay, your meeting seemed important. I hope that emergency wasn't anything too serious?" Steve asked.
He was done well before his scheduled appointment with Rhodey. He even had enough time to shower and grab a cup of coffee. He still felt like death warmed over, but that was a state of being he was well and thoroughly used to.
The Mayor's expression turned even more stern. "Oh, no. It's not time for that quite yet. It's too early to trust him. I'll need more than just his word for that. See, his past
Steve gets up as well, his movements more calm and controlled than Tony's. He looks disappointed. Deflated. Tony hates that he's caused that.
Five minutes later, Steve waved good-bye to Bucky at the door, and headed out the way he'd come, back on his bike, and straight to the site of the fire.
“You’ll probably feel more comfortable sitting up,” Steve offered. He placed one hand on Tony’s shoulder, ready to guide him to rest against the nearest wall.
The inside of the building is as frugal as the outside implied. The furniture is plain wood and consists of a table, a pair of benches, and a wide platform with old, thin mattresses laid side by side in place of a bed. There's a simple wood-burning stove for cooking and heating, and oil lanterns to provide light; there's obviously no electricity here.
Tony was resting on his back on a couch, on a residential floor of the Tower that had survived the narrowly missed Lokicalypse unscathed, unlike most of the neighborhood. He'd swapped his glitchy arc reactor for an intact one and had Jarvis run some basic medical scans, and everything checked out. Physically, he was surprisingly okay.
The scene that had frozen for a few seconds, with everyone staring at the dinosaur stampede, turned into utter chaos. The Northerners who were still standing clearly didn't know what to do, shouting to each other in agitated voices, some of them approaching the dungeon entrance. One persistent young lady tried to attack Steve, but he sent her staggering away with a sharp kick.
"Maybe not, and yet." Tony sighed, turning the empty mug around in his hands. It was completely unfair that he'd made it through the whole mess with nothing worse than bruises. "Maya's dead, Happy's still in the hospital, and Pepper's not a fan of her newly acquired superpowers."
He slept, and he stared at the cold stone walls. He ate when one of the nurses brought him food and accepted the few old, worn books they offered him, even though he had no interest in reading them.
Steve was stunned. Tony had loved him for years? All that time, and he'd never said anything. Steve thought back to all the time they'd spent together, sharing meals, watching movies, playing games. So many afternoons lounging in the common spaces of the Tower and sparring in the gym. And then there were the countless times they'd fought side by side, seamlessly, saving the world together. He had always enjoyed Tony's company, and he'd always been fond of Tony. Being around Tony had always made his days that little bit brighter and more special.
Tony woke up with no idea of where he was, except that he had to be outside: even with his eyes closed, he could feel the lovely warmth of sunlight on his face and his bare chest. The surface beneath him was more uneven than the floor of his cell, and his back rested against something lumpy.
Steve wasn't even sure what he hoped to find here. The FDNY and the NYPD would do a proper investigation of the site, to see if they could figure out what had started the fire, and Steve held no illusions of being better at that than the experts.
"There is a time for letting go," Seren replied, speaking more slowly; the formality in her pronunciation suggested that she was quoting some Dinotopian saying Tony wasn't familiar with. "That is when you are old and know that you have lived a good life. Your time is not yet, Tony Stark."
"No," Steve said adamantly. He got up and walked over to sit on the arm of Tony's chair, rubbing soothing circles on Tony's back. "Don't you dare say that. We made our own choices. Besides, I had selfish reasons for getting you out. I've lost too many friends already. I couldn't lose you too, Tony."
Tony didn't tend to spend a lot of time reading papers; when there was something particularly relevant to his interests, he skimmed through them, checked out the abstract, maybe glanced at the methods to decide whether they were solid. This one, though, he read from start to finish. Three times. Including the supplement.
Miss Potts had stayed in the background, and now she shrugged. "I decided to leave explaining the details of this arrangement to you."
"Don't thank me yet," Steve said, though the last two words were drowned by gunshots. Of course, he'd had his shield at the ready, and the bullets ricocheted harmlessly from it.
He didn't move again or open his eyes until he felt Tony's weight settle on the bed next to him. Then, he shifted closer, and murmured a hopefully sleepy-sounding "What was that?" at Tony.
Steve reached to grab a thick metal beam that was propping up some other pieces of the wreckage, and lifted it aside with a grunt. It revealed nothing but more burned building materials.
"James. I'm glad to see you doing well," she greeted him. She was speaking English, which Bucky had now learned was a courtesy, an effort she made specifically when speaking to the people who'd arrived on the island in recent years. He was getting better at the common speech of the resistance movement, a strange hybrid of bits and pieces of many languages he recognized and some he had never heard before, but he definitely appreciated being able to communicate in English for a change.
"I know what you mean. For what it's worth, I wish it could be different," Steve said, one sentence that he could call perfectly honest.
"I wasn't conspiring against them," Steve said. He couldn't believe Tony had bought that. "There was a conspiracy inside SHIELD, but I wasn't a part of it. Surely you know me better than to believe that I'd work against them!"
Eventually, through a glowing haze of deep contentment, he surfaced in the real world again. The first thing he saw were Tony's concerned eyes locked with his, Tony's fingers patting his cheek. "Steve, hey? Steve? Talk to me," he was saying, a note of panic in his voice.
He could hurry over, rush to Tony's room, and grab him as if he were apprehending a fugitive. He just didn't really want to do that. He had reasons to suspect Tony was the arsonist he was looking for, but he was mainly basing that on the stories of a couple of thugs. He lacked solid evidence. Without that, he'd prefer not to make this official. He wanted to be sure he had his facts straight.
It was strange to hear himself referred to by rank outside of SHIELD; with his carefully concealed identity, only his closest colleagues had known it. But apparently the trials following the takeover attempt had been public, and exposed his identity to everyone. He supposed there must've been celebrations among organized criminals across the Solar System when they'd found out that he'd been outed and sentenced.
Slowly, he surfaced back to present reality. He was sitting down, grasping the edge of the table in front of him so hard his fingers were starting to ache. He forced his hold to loosen and placed his palms against the plastic instead. It was slightly sticky in places. He was in a cafe, and he didn't think a cleaning drone had visited this place recently.
"That's great!" Bucky exclaimed, glad and relieved to hear that Stark had come to his senses before it was too late.
When it came to crossing the island from Canyon City to Cornucopia, Steve and Sam were in luck: they managed to cover in six days a distance that usually took longer than a week. It would've been even less if they hadn't needed to wait a day in the summit village called Tentpole of the Sky for the sky galley to be ready to set off. The galley's planned route hadn't been as far north as Cornucopia, but Steve had put all his authority and charisma into play, and after several passionate pleas, the galley's captain had given in.
Steve can't help thinking that the container is a bad omen, his constant worry growing even more urgent. There shouldn't be any reason for Tony to leave his gear behind—the only situation where it would make sense would be if he got rescued and didn't need it anymore, but that can't have happened. Steve wouldn't have missed an aircraft passing this close to the hut.
Tony took Steve to one of the chaise longues across the room, and nudged him to sit down. He didn't sit next to Steve, but on a wingback chair nearby. Steve realized it was a close approximation of their positions back in the past; he was amazed Tony would even remember that, considering how long ago it had been on his personal timeline. It was definitely sentimental, almost to the point of being too on the nose.
There's a reason why it's Elijah Kamski and not Tony Stark who rules the android market, and why there are no humanoid robots in Stark Industries' portfolio. Tony's actively steered the company away from them. It's not that he doesn't like androids; more like the opposite. He's always been very fond of the machine minds around him. He considers JARVIS a friend, and his bots are as dear to him as pets would be to someone else. The thought of creating AIs as sophisticated as JARVIS and putting them in bodies that are realistic enough to fool you into thinking that they're human, and then selling them as a commodity—he doesn't think that's right.
"Definitely," Bucky said, eyes lighting up with excitement. It didn't seem to matter to him that he didn't know who or what Iron Man was.
"Excuse me," he raised his voice to catch their full attention. "I'm trying to look into what could have caused this fire. Did any of you see or hear anything unusual, before or after the alarm went off?"
"I'm afraid the coffee's been sitting in the pot for some time. I ordered it before Tony showed up," Jan said. "I'll call and ask them to bring a fresh batch, if you'd like?" The contrast between her politeness and the sour treatment Steve had gotten from Jarvis earlier couldn't have been more obvious.
The reptilian hissed at him. "Why would I do that? Who are you, walking in here to tell me what to do?"
“Emile Costa, I think his names was, school playmate for years, fell down dead at the start of fall term.”
"But they are innocent! Father’s not even a Jew, and he’s been here since he was a boy. This is the only home our mother knows! How are they supposed to survive in Poland when they have nothing?!" Daniel shouted, full of outrage, but it was the naked desperation in in his eyes that hit them all like a physical blow. It was desperation for answers that no one had to give.
Rita's mouth fell open unattractively and two of the other boys didn't even bother to hide their sniggers. Elizabeth looked torn for a second before her mouth tilted in a smile.
Ian nodded slowly, but he wasn’t as sure as they were. He wanted it to be true. It seemed right, but if the HJ had taught him anything it was that people didn’t always do what was right. After all, it had been months since James had nearly ruined his book and Ian could not honestly say that he’d completely forgiven him. Maybe it was time to change that he thought, bighting his lip.
“What is this?” Tony asked with shock, looking up at Cameron who seemed nervous now, not fully meeting Tony’s gaze.
What was he to do? Logic was the answer. He was German after all and an officer at that, logic was the only way to operate. If he followed the logic of the Führer it would surely mean the end of his family. Hitler wasn’t good for Germany, therefore he must be stopped.
She couldn’t forgive him his behavior at the Berghof or his refusal to answer his summons. He’d jeopardized the entire family. They’d all pay the price soon if he could not bring himself back to reason, and this was not the Stefen Rogers she’d agreed to marry. This was madness. They all knew it. They were just too afraid to say it.
Ian had slipped away to his room. He stayed away for dinner too. Everyone must have been feeling whatever it was that was sitting in his stomach too, because father didn't even make him come down to eat with everyone at dinner time and Tony and Uncle Bucky let him be.
“The book is not stupid to Ian, and if destruction was not your intent what is it you expected to happen when you threw it?”
Steve breathed in and out slowly, grateful that the pain in his chest had begun to let up and his head clear, now that he wasn’t suffocating himself like a fool. Only a coward would choose death now and leave his family to fend for themselves.
“I was alone and the world was at war. The bombs would shake the abbey walls whenever there was a raid. And I used to just lay there, wishing they’d just land on us… because then I might see my mother again…” Tony swallowed thickly and looked away from the penetrating blue of the captain’s eyes. It was too hard to get through with such intense focus fixed upon him.
Péter, sitting beneath a tree nearby had his head buried in his arms as he watched Natacha play solitaire with herself. Or perhaps she was simply counting the cards (it was hard to tell). Either way they both looked miserable.
The baroness's eyebrows raised but her mouth twisted in a smile of amusement. There was laughter dancing in her eyes as she answered, "You're right you're very impertinent. But I don't mind admitting, seven children are a lot for a woman alone."
He said nothing as he followed Tony and the children to the canteen, and then the small officer’s cottage they were going to stay in until launch on the fifth. He said nothing as he changed into the unfamiliar uniform waiting laid out upon the bed and let the reality of his choice settle around his shoulders.
“James, I want you to eat every last bite of that.” Before Tony could say what Steve knew he was about to, Steve diverted his attention to James, who was poking at the bread on his plate which he had torn into small pieces but made no attempt to consume. Because Tony might feel like he had to offer Steve absolution and affirmation, but if Steve had to watch Tony muster up the strength one more time despite the obvious drain Steve was on his life, Steve couldn’t account for what he’d say.
The hall was destroyed, just as he’d feared. Windows busted and pouring out thick black smoke, devoid of any signs of life. Splintered furniture and broken instruments lay strewn about. Glass from the windows covered the ground like a bed of snow.
Phillips never considered them even, because Steve had saved his life the day he’d rescued his unit and held back the advance of the enemy. The same day he’d become known as the lion of Austria. Philips liked to grumble that he’d be a hundred and ten, still waiting for the opportunity to save Steve’s life so he could go out with a clean slate.
He hoisted her up and out of the water and she wrapped her legs around his waist. She clutched at his shoulders, rubery fingers digging into his skin and just when he was admiring the water beading in her eyelashes and the glint of happiness in her eyes, she sneezed lake water into his face.
“Thank you, Hammer. That’ll be all.” Stefen barely noticed the disgruntled look Hammer shot his way as he took the parcels from the man's outstretched hand and tucked them under his own arm and dismissed him without a second thought, darting up the stairs to snatch some of the tipping manuscripts off of Tony’s teetering tower and grasp hold of his arm for balance.
“I know.” He replied with a small chuckle, his heart feeling a little too big for his chest. “He teaches me something new every day.”
Natacha, and Péter (Tony realized belatedly) were turned toward the open carriage door, their arms stretched out to catch as first Artur, then Maria and then – Tony's heart lurched in his chest at the sight – Ian tossed Sara into Natacha’s waiting arms before jumping down himself. Afraid of drawing the attention of the men at the worksite –
Tony was pulled from the violent memory by a pair of small hands tugging sharply at the hem of his shirt. For a moment he almost didn’t recognize Ian, his sight full of terrified brown eyes and blood, almost unable to process the sight of the child in front of him.
“Goodness.” Bethany chuckled lowly, her blue eyes dancing with amusement. “Your employer is incredibly generous. What is it you do?”
“If we go to a farm, they’ll expect us to work. Some of us are better suited than others.” Her eyes canted towards James on the other side of Steve, who was dozing. With his mouth open and a little pool of drool collecting in the corner as it so happened. Steve stretched his lips into a smile, because it felt like he should. Because however distant the emotion felt, he knew how terribly deep his love for the boy went and he had to show it.
He thought about the way Stefen had woken him that last morning in Berlin, the way his hands had stroked over Tony’s skin like one might luxuriate over silk. He thought about the weight of Stefen’s gaze as he’d watched while he thought that Tony continued to sleep, and the blink of surprise he’d made when Tony had suddenly opened his eyes and informed him how unsettling it was to wake under such intense scrutiny.
Oh boy. Tony was just in the middle of choking down another bite of stew as he failed to master eating and laughing at the same time when Natacha thankfully jumped in to save the conversation.
Right. Tony laid a hand on Clint's shoulder and squeezed, eyes widening in surprise when the boy turned quickly and stepped into his arms, wrapping him up in a furious hug despite his bony arms.
“He’s a Jew,” Hammer sneered. “The Major kept him on when no one else would and look how he’s repaid him.”
“Must I?” the captain asked incredulously, his eyebrows climbing up his face and Tony gave him a pressed look.
Christmas comes to salzburg as Steve recovers and the future of his family hangs in the balance. Also known as, Steve nearly died and everything's a mess, but hey it's Christmas.
Tony kept Péter and his siblings busy with lessons during the day so it was hard for Péter to find a moment alone to speak with either Anya or Péter alone where either one of his siblings or Tony himself was not around. The only one he didn't have to worry about was his father because the captain had barely made it to a meal a day since the pair had arrived, caught up in some important business that took him away from the house for long hours.  It looked as if whatever magic had been responsible for Vienna and his sudden desire to spend time with them was over. Not that Péter cared. He'd always known it was too good to last.
He'd practically whooped with relief when Steve had told him that Charlette had accepted him. Jesus Christ, but Steve didn’t know how lucky he was. He needed Charlotte more than ever now. Like a man needed water in a desert! He said he knew what he had to do, but then he looked at Stark and a blind man could see how lost he was. He said he knew, but then he kissed the man as if compelled by the hands of god, not caring at all that Bucky was
“Father can I get these?” little hands tugged on his jacket and Steve looked down, blanching at the sight of the navy blue short shorts that Artur was extending his way. He had the matching sailor top that went with it in his right hand, and there was even a floppy little cap pinned to the hangar. Steve hummed, buying time while trying to think up a nice way of saying he’d rather his son didn’t look like they had more money than good sense and too much of it to waste.
“Don’t you mean handsome Tony?” Péter asked with a fond roll of his eyes and Tony made an affronted sound.
It was hard to keep fueling his anger in the face of Stefen’s stark sincerity and with his body pressed so deliciously close. Tony was viciously torn between the desire to punch the man in the teeth and stick his tongue in his mouth, and he didn’t appreciate the feeling.
Stefen leaned down to drag out the large green trunk out from under the seat by its protruding handle. After a nod from Tony, he settled it on Tony’s lap (Christ it was heavy) to rifle through the contents. He found canned meat and a kind of flat biscuit that didn’t pretend to be appetizing, but also, wonder of wonders, chocolate bars wrapped in tin foil.
“I can go to the parade with you. If you want.” Peter looked up from his work, brown eyes soft with sorrow and heavy with guilt. He was talking about more than the parade.
He looked up again, this time with the intent to order Stark into the water with Artur, when Bucky groaned.
to do, but that wasn’t what made Bucky stop and take aim at the men who stayed to protect their commander.
“We leave in the morning,” Tony grumbled rising from the chair with an unamused scowl, still coming back from the fright she’d given him. “So we’d better help Artur find his shoe, before James loses his head.”
Stefen’s mouth dipped into a dangerous scowl and Tony bit his lip to keep from laughing. Tony had a feeling the maids were in for it when they got back.
“What did you tell her?” he asked and in his parallel view he could see Zimmerman tense, his hand moving to the pistol Steve knew he always kept on him. He held one hand up to stop him and Zimmerman didn’t move any further. They were not going to charge into some poor woman’s home simply because she had eyes.
“They’re gone.” Tony said, breath gusting outward with relief and Stefen nodded slowly, his posture not relaxing by any visible margin. Still, when he raised his hand and beckoned Tony toward him Tony went without question.  He stopped at Stefen’s shoulder and could not resist the urge to touch, the fingers of one hand ghosting across warm flesh, the cotton shirt he wore a thin but no less hateful barrier.
Unless, he married the Baroness. That would give them stability should the worst happen. It would buy Natacha time to grow up a little more and do what everyone expected.
“Quiet, Cap, just rest will you.” Tony scattered his frantic thoughts. “You’d think you’d want to, what with just escaping death and everything." He smiled when he said it, but Steve could hear the way Tony’s voice shook. Real. That was real wasn’t it? Illusions didn’t have those kinds of faults, did they?
“… Actually. The Führer says that intellectualism and vain artistry has made Germans soft. He says that books provide too wide a window for corruption to enter the mind and that good citizens know that what Germany needs is dedicated men and women for labor and service.”
His eyes weren’t hurting for nice things to look at. Stefen’s long legs for one, the entirely unfair tininess of his waist juxtaposed against those broad shoulders, the crisp uniform that made those shoulders look even broader. Take your pick.
“While you’re at your paperwork, you wouldn't mind organizing someone to clean up the gutters. There was some trash in one of them on my way here. I don’t know if it was one of yours.” Göring scoffed at Striker and then turned to Captain Khalmmer and continued “Or if it’s one of yours, but there has to be a better way to get your point across than leaving bodies in the gutter. I had my girls with me for god's sake.”
"A fight you should have won Rogers." Herr Lehmann barked. "By right I should ripp that patch off your shoulder and give it to Johann. To think you are the son of a man like Captain Rogers. It boggles the mind. Your mother must have cuckolded him."
“The woman in the flat next door saw us.” Boehringer’s daughter revealed quietly, lifting sharp blue eyes to meet Steve’s as he tucked the paper away. They were fearful but not unsteady.
to bury his heritage and Peggy had certainly never asked it of him. Assimilating had been his choice, being
ingenuity and design. There were simply no ships like Stark ships, and thanks to them and their specialized weaponry Germany had become a military giant. One could even say, as Hughard often had, that Starks had given Germany
Steve snatched Ian’s shoulder, pulling him out of the way just in time to avoid an automobile careening around the corner. He caught a glimpse of a ghost like face behind the wheel and then the car was gone, disappearing into the black night.
“I don’t see what for. You know it all. Go play. Come back when you think there is something I can teach you.”
"Please, don't let your concern hold you here." Steve returned, surprising himself with the amount of venom in his tone. "You can go anytime you like. Do you need money? Food? I'd be happy to help you on your way." With each clipped word Steve felt parts of him ripping loose inside. He stood to his feet, striding towards the door. "
he kept telling himself, clutching the coins laying over his heart, trying to obey the silent command and stop the damn thing from hammering out of his chest. It would all be alright. He’d think of something to say, something to do, something to fix it. If he could just breathe. Breathe.
those boys.” Tony reminded her, because of course she didn’t know. Couldn’t possibly know or care how Péter had suffered at the hands of many of the boys she’d invited into his home, on his own birthday, to put on a damn show!
“Someone is coming with supper. This is all we’ve got in-between.” Steve announced for the benefit of all of those listening, ignoring the groans he got in response. One meal a day wouldn’t kill them by any means. God knew they’d suffered worse conditions than one hot meal a day. Traveling with the caravan it had been the norm and with their platoon in the mountains in the thick of war it hadn’t been uncommon to go days without a solid meal. Hunger was a friend Steve knew well.
“And you think there is something we don’t know.” A statement and not a question. Holmes’ gaze was sharp on Tony now. But all Tony cared about was Stefen lifting his head up to look at him.
"Hardly," Péter groused, jerking his chin up, an edge of hurt creeping back into his tone. "I don't know anything about being gypsy."
“He’ll be fine by tonight. Don’t worry.” Stefen said lightly, squeezing Sara’s middle. James scrunched up his eyes into slits and tilted his head up at Bucky, examining him critically. “You’re sure you’re just drunk?”
“Come on. Do you want to die?” Magda urged him, hurrying back with the torch. He considered it as she began stripping poor Franz from his jacket. Did he want to die?
“Am I the first lover you’ve taken?” Tony repeated the question of earlier, determined to at least broach the conversation before they were otherwise distracted. Stefen chuckled darkly against his neck.
He mumbled that he was sorry a few more times before Tony shushed him, biting back the urge to cry. What a useless thing to do. He didn’t deserve it either.
Steve attempted to guess where they were going but after a time he gave up when he realized that the driver was taking unnecessary turns, likely to prevent their being followed.
“Tony please,” he pleaded quietly, and Tony felt the weight of thousands of lives – too many lives – weighing down on him, the cost of his selfishness; he gnashed his teeth.
“Out of curiosity, what are your conditions?” he finally asked, scathing and bored in his tone, but Tony knew he’d won this part of the battle.
It was intermingled with Natacha’s fight to plait her hair. Tony had seen her storming back upstairs after James teased her at supper. She'd spent the next half hour tackling her hair into submission. He'd been surprised there was any hair left on her head after seeing the hair brush she'd left discarded in her room so, of course, There were at least four paragraphs detailing the submission of Natacha locks with an estimate of hair depletion as well as estimates for her next round with brush and comb.
“Move woman!” Dr. Fischer was commanding Frau Hogan as Dvorak re-entered. He’d managed to subdue Rogers by strapping his wrists together with leather restraints. It was unsettling in the extreme to see the unstoppable lion, trussed up and laying curled in on himself mewling as weakly as a kitten. More disturbing still was Rogers glazed eyes focused on nothing as he panted through harsh wheezing breaths, his eyelids slowly drooping.
He must face reality sooner or later. He could not stay in Austria, and he could not entertain the thought of staying with the Rogers family indefinitely. To do so was a madness bordering on the suicidal. What place had he there after all? The Nazi threat notwithstanding, the bitter truth was that Tony’s place in the household was contingent on the children. Children grew, and when they were grown what then? What reason would the captain have to keep him around, and how absurd was it to even hope that Stefen would concern himself with finding one.
Tony swallowed the bitter anger that had swelled up within him; in the face of getting the boy out of Nazi reach and hopefully out of whatever spy game Farkas was entrenched in what choice did he have? They boy deserved a shot at a normal life, away from the madness.
“As you can see Cardinal, the prisoners Henrick Vogel and Franz Albrect are being returned to you by the grace of his Excellency the Führer in good condition.” The warden began the proceedings in a bored tone, the brothers of Engelzell already forgotten as he moved behind the desk. “Do you have their papers?”
"Stark-" he began but Artur wasn’t finished. The boy was level enough with Steve who was still seated to grab his chin and force his gaze away from Tony. Steve tensed in surprise, thankfully that he didn’t instinctively lash out. Artur held Steve's face, serious blue eyes gazing back at him.
“I dream about you.” Stefen answered slowly, with familiar decisiveness.  Slow to trust, but once decided, firm in his resolution.
They had to get the soil ready for the strawberries and couldn’t wait for the workers. At least it wasn't as frigid as it had been a few weeks ago, when her skirt had frozen to the leather of her boots.
Tony felt a swell of pride low in his chest. He knew it wouldn't be reciprocated but it was there all the same. “I tutor Captain Rogers children.”
"I can’t be in two places at once." Stefen replied, voice low and ragged with frustration. "And we won’t have the others to help either. They’ll never be able to mobilize in time, not now that they’ve been sent to the polish border."
“We had to walk to the border of Czechoslovakia, which wasn’t so bad. We hitched a ride with a truck full of laborers headed that way. They had other boys on their service year with them so we were lucky. We asked for a stop to pee about an hour out and slipped away, crossed the border about ten miles away from the road and didn’t see any patrols. It was easier to find people willing to help us get to Poland once we were on the other side. The Czechs hate the Germans because they take more and more Czech land every day. They say it’s to protect the people and retaliate against those who still resist them taking over the Sudetenland, but everyone knows it’s a lie. It won’t be long before the whole country is under German control. Just like here.”
Artur barely waited until he'd finished speaking to scamper off to his bed where his trunk lay open. Tony watched him toss aside the box of toy cars he'd previously elected to bring as if they'd offended him and attempt to cram the large book in the spot they'd vacated. Pepper sniffed, and Tony looked over to catch her wiping her eyes before she turned resolutely back to her task. His stomach clenched. His fingers twitched with the urgent call to
So there it is. Peter's tucked safely away at school, Ian's the man of the house, Tony's at home wringing his hands like a war bride and Steve is off to
“Ah… sorry about that. We didn’t know they could be poisonous.” The boy’s face shifted into a hard expression, his brown eyes glinting with challenge as he asked, “You aren’t going to tell Father about them are you?”
Stefen caught Stark’s eye again and something passed between the two of them. Steve nodded and Stark smiled, if you could call it that. It was more like a resigned wince.
“Father,” a small voice called out form one of the sleeping rolls, but over the crackling of the fire it was hard for Tony to distinguish which one. Stefen looked up and Ian squirmed in his sleeping bag until he was laying on his stomach, elbows propped up upon the ground. “Would you read to us?”
He sat Artur down next to Sara and bolted after Ian, Artur’s screaming sob of protest ringing in his ears. He’d only made it halfway into the hall when Tony grabbed him by the collar and hauled him back.
"Antony?!" the man exclaimed, expression slipping into a full-on glower as his eyes narrowed on the pair outside the barred door. "I should have known. What trouble are you in now?"
"Hello James. I'm sorry we're so early, but I've been asked to do a last minute performance and I really must be on my way. I had to bring them now." Janneke rushed to explain as she greeted both Bakhuizen and Rogers with light kisses.
The clock above the mantle chimed five. Something in the Captain moved, Tony might have called it a flinch in anyone else.
.” Tony pointed out succinctly, with bite. Steve stiffened his back, bracing for the argument ahead. There would be no bending this time. The note from Holmes at SIS had been very blunt. Britain would not risk helping them, unless Steve committed to their mission in the defense of Norway. There was no point in waiting for Kirk any longer because they’d learned in an earlier letter from Jann that he’d been conscripted for the navy. He’d be with the fleet heading to battle in Norwegian waters.  This was their only way out. Tony just didn’t see it yet.
Still, the drive was no picnic. He almost would’ve preferred to stay on the streets. It was confined and cramped with nine of them. And the door kept unlatching and threatening to spilling Steve out onto the road. Artur was forced to make himself as small as possible and wriggle close enough to hold it shut with a white knuckled grip. All the while they feared who would get it in their minds to have a try at the automobile.
“Like I said, I never loved chemistry so much as I loved machinery and I didn’t have the right tools or the means of creating them to do the job right.” Tony sighed wistfully. “What I wouldn’t do for a proper lab and my best shot at it though.”
The silence that followed was full of expectation, and nervous tension. Tony could see them both thinking but could tell that they had not yet fully grasped the potential set before them.
It was a good question, one Natacha waited anxiously for along with her brothers and sisters. She was sure neither of them even remembered that Natacha and her siblings were in the room.
“Did I not speak clearly?” Tony’s voice lilted upward in faux surprise. He was slurring only slightly despite a long night of drinking. He looked up, eyes a little too bright but still sharp, and stared directly at Steve with fire in them, repeating himself coldly.
Steve nodded slowly and shrugged free of Tony’s grip on him. He couldn’t stomach the pity he’d see in Tony’s eyes so he didn’t meet them.
Yes. Ian dragged the sled into the trees, away from the absence of trees that marked the snow-covered road and peered down the slope. It wasn't smooth, full of rocks and trees and any number of things that would injure him if he ran into them. He searched for the spot that looked the clearest and balanced the sled at the top, climbing aboard carefully and laying down on his stomach. That was better for rolling if he crashed, but he
“The singing, Captain, and their other lessons?” Tony pressed the captain’s retreating back. He paused and glanced back at Tony with a warning stare, but Tony could have sworn there was something almost warm glinting in that blue. Maybe he was just imagining things but the sweet rush of victory filled him when Stefen nodded shortly.
He’d been gone just over a month by Tony’s count before Bruce deemed it safe enough to set out. It had been nearly a week and a half since anyone had come to the abbey to question the brothers, and to the best of their knowledge the police had stopped patrolling the nearby roads.
“Stefen,” Charlotte's voice was laced with alarm and Steve reflexively flinched, gazing down at his palm to find the source of the unexpected sting. He was bleeding, but only a little. The knife had slipped and cut into his flesh. Frowning Steve pressed a napkin over the wound, watching as red bloomed onto the white.
Stefen blinked at him, shock making him stupid, and Bucky glowered as if Steve’s blank look had offended him. He stalked toward Steve until they were standing toe to toe.
It was not at all hard to believe this man had had a hand in making James. If Tony didn’t know any better he’d say that Stefen was this close to hiding them behind his back like a little school boy. As it was he seemed content to hold Tony's things closer to him almost daring him to make a go at it.
“Strongest naval force in the world,” Tony mused aloud, just for the pleasure of watching the admiral’s mouth curl in distaste.
Stefen watched Tony’s mouth move as he quietly sang the words to the old love song, a lover’s promise to another that they would go together into any brave new world, across any vast ocean, and that even separated, even then, they’d still be together. The light guiding each other home.
! Charlotte knew the risks. If she wants to hedge her bets playing nice with the Reich, she’s welcome to it, but you and I aint so lucky
.” Tony sneered, deliberately accenting the crass words until he sounded like some twisted version of Bucky, complete with the eyes that accused Steve of all kinds of idiocy and betrayal. Tony had never made a joke out of the roughness that sometimes-colored Steve’s speech. The distinctly rounded sounds and vocal patterns of the Rom. It stung, but he supposed he deserved a little viciousness, after what he’d said when Péter went missing… It felt like a different life now. But Steve remembered. He’d been vicious. Cruel. He hadn’t meant what he’d said… well most of it. But he hadn’t meant to hurt Tony, not really, only he
The words fell much easier then he'd ever expected them to. Years of lies and the truth slipped so easily out, their weight lifting from his chest.
care? He was as irresponsible as they came. Just ask every last monk there! Never on time for anything, irreverent as they came. Flibbertigibbet wasn’t the worst thing he’d heard one of his brother monks calling him under the breath. Tony was
The trouble with holding things back from someone you cared deeply for, was that the blasted secrets became something like rocks tied to ones feet. The weight of them just got heavier and more cumbersome with each moment. Tony didn’t imagine that he knew everything there was to know about Stefen either, but he couldn’t miss the fact that after the conversation they’d had in the music room that the scales had somehow tipped. Somehow Stefen had become the one who seemed open and vulnerable while Tony kept his cards clenched tightly to his chest.
She’d been in love with him since she was a girl of sixteen. Her mother had called it ‘infatuated’ and she’d not approved and not really because he was her cousins husband. Cousin Peggy had always been wonderfully scandalous (mama had not approved of her either) and Charlotte had envied her when she’d gone off to the front to serve as a nurse, thinking sadly that she would never be allowed to have such adventures herself. Not long after the war had ended Peggy had come home, more worldly and sophisticated in Charlotte’s eyes than ever, and not long after that she’d come to a family soirée with the famed Captain Rogers in tow.
"No, I mean, you see, if the children leave with a woman, their mother, my...wife, a wife with Swiss citizenship, the Reich won’t be able to touch them once they’ve gone.” He explained, swallowing thickly again before he continued. “It’s the best way. Even if I could send - I cant send them to their Grandparents and I don’t want them to be alone or end up separated. You could. You would have my name. You could look after them."
The crowd inside the cafe was a mix of tourists on holiday and locals.  His eye was immediately drawn to the large group of children sat near the windows of the cafe, a few with luggage at their feet but more noticeably without. All of them, down to the smallest, wore tags tied to their wrists as if they were just extensions of their luggage. They were being minded by two young women in thick coats and hats, bearing badges that proudly announced them as part of the Kindertransport Association of Austria. Following the November pogrom Britain had decided to open its doors to children, and they’d been leaving the country in small waves ever since. Deiter could not imagine what sort of parent would choose to sign their child away and give them into the hands of strangers, but there wasn't any doubt that it was better than the alternative. There truly was no place for Jews in Germany anymore.
Tony recognized the face of Tiberius Stone among a cluster of brothers making their way toward the library and saw the way the man's eyes widened at the sight of him.  He offered the monk a wordless salute as he marched by, and if there was a swagger in his step so be it. He was free of this place, he reminded himself. And a better man for it, no matter what people like Tiberius thought.
But she bit her lip and stayed still, focusing on the sharp stinging in her lip and the tangy taste of blood that followed. She counted every steady breath slowly in her head. She couldn’t say anything, not without admitting what she’d done.
Susann answered the door after the first knock, wordlessly ushering him inside. Stepping into the small sitting room he stood awkwardly, his hat held between his hands until Susann insisted he take a seat and not to mind the clutter. Her brother Jonny was in town again and she said that between him and her nine-year-old son it was a wonder the place hadn’t fallen down.  Stefen didn’t mind the toys and other nick-knacks spread across the sitting room. It gave the small space a certain kind of intimacy that was missing in the grand homes.
He’d changed since Tony had seen him last. The man Tony had nearly run over had been just that, a man. Standing there a dangerous silhouette in the doorway he looked and felt something entirely other. The sun's low setting light played shadows across his face, obscuring half of it even as it light up his eyes like sun on ice. If it weren't for the rise and fall of his chest Tony would have thought him a statue. Every trace of warmth drained out of him.
"Perhaps you should lay down then." Pepper suggested without much pity, because she was a cruel woman when she wanted to be.
He cleared his throat, looked down at his hand, snatched his courage and met her eyes. “Seven children are a lot to handle already.”
“My father says we can’t win a war against the Czechs if France and Britain back them. The Führer would be mad to try it.”
“Woe is the day when men erect their vanities in the place of history,” Tony replied with a shake of his head and next to Steve, Göring’s wife gasped into her napkin. The smile slipped from Steve’s face. That had been too far. Almost a direct criticism of the Führer and everyone knew it. Damn it Tony needed to be more careful!
, Steve’s brain filled in and he took a breath and tried again. He was shaking, fine little tremors all over but he doubted, hoped, Péter wouldn't see. "About being who we are."
“You weren’t happy when she taught me to dance. You weren’t happy when she tried to tell us stories. I thought you were ashamed of her, like the Osbornes, but that wasn’t it. It was because she was different.”
“No! Herr Stark, no! I want to walk with you!” The girl pulled away from Tony’s reaching arms in protest. Her tiny hand was still clutched in Tony’s however and she didn’t get very far.
Deiter blew his whistle, filling the cafe with the shrill sound of alarm. Conversation in the dining room ground to a halt as the lieutenant ran through, puffing on his whistle all the while.
“Before I forget,” Bucky grunted, and Tony stared at it and Bucky incredulously until he recognized the familiar writing on it.  “He wanted you to have this, if things went bad.” Bucky said, looking away and as about as comfortable as a cactus as he said it.
“He’s a tool Ian! We’re all tools, and the minute we stop being useful we will be the sorriest we’ve ever been.” She warned once more before looking away, plastering a practiced smile upon her face as if she hadn’t just frightened him to the core.
“Take his coat. Get your things,” Magda prompted him with a firm shake of his shoulder. She waited until his glazed eyes met hers and held, before she stood and rushed to pick up the dropped torch.
“No. No definitely not.” Péter quickly assured him, clapping a hand upon the other boy’s shoulder. When he’d arrived at school late for the start of term and been told he’d be living in a dorm with a stranger for a roommate, Péter had not dared to hope he would get along with his new roommate as well as he got on with Harry and Bobby, but fate had smiled on him. Ned was a bit of an outcast but he was brilliant, and funny! And at the International School people seemed to care a lot less overall about anything besides how smart you were.
“It’s best if we all get back to normal,” she announced to the table at large. Whatever normal had been before that one awful night, Stefen seemed to be in no hurry to bring it back. It was a struggle just to get him to agree to eat in the dining room. There were apparently more ways out in the kitchen, should the Gestapo come banging down the door - an all too real fear, now that he was openly defying his orders.
Da’s room still looked as if he might come in at any moment. His jacket was still thrown against the dresser and the dressing kit he’d used to fix Ian’s blouse lay open on his desk.
"I'm hungry." Artur announced upon reaching camp with a halfhearted pout. The expression was wholly unconvincing considering his kingly perch upon his father's wide shoulders and the smile that wouldn't leave his eyes.
It was just too bad for the Rogers that it was a Stark family trait to poke, prod, and tweak. Especially when no one had asked for it.
There was definitely something off about him. Drunk perhaps. He wouldn't be the first war hero to succumb to the drink. Tony’s fingers twitched at his sides noticing now that the captain was in the light of the entry that his skin had taken on a gray greenish tinge. He looked sickly and again Tony was drawn to compare the officer he’d met so briefly at the abbey and the man in front of him now. Yes, he was statuesque but it was stiff, controlled, with none of the grace he remembered from before.
"Or what? You'll talk me to death?" Obie returns, a condescending smirk on his lips. "Shut up, Steve. You can't help him."
Steve heard the sound of the toilet being flushed, and of the tap running. He left the coveralls on the floor and hurried to curl up under the sheets again, trying to look like he'd been dozing all along, even though his mind was running wild with speculation about Tony's secrets and the phone call he'd overheard.
"No, we don't," Tony disagreed. "I don't think you realize how long it's been for me. I'm not the kid you knew back then."
"Self-defense or not, it doesn't justify burning people alive, or destroying the homes of my friends," Tony said.
"Yeah, it's something I cobbled together using CyberLife tech. Think of it as an improvised pacemaker," Tony tells her, trying to keep it as casual as he can. He decides to leave it at that. It's easier not to go into detail about how it's also an electromagnet and possibly the most compact power generator anyone's ever built. "You know androids don't scar like this, right?" he adds, waving a hand in front of the device.
If only Tony could be sure he could trust James—then he could explain the whole thing, and he was willing to bet James would help him. But even the slight risk of him telling the others about the sunstone would be too much of a gamble. Tony would rather die than have the Northerners find out about it. If he got outside, he'd have to be very careful how he went on about exposing it to the sun. If. It wasn't looking very likely at all.
The young people around him were the closest thing to friends that he had, but their background was so utterly different from his that he doubted they'd ever truly understand him.
In place of the regret and sadness Steve had felt before Iron Man had showed up, there was now bright joy and hopefulness.
"I need backup!" Bucky yelled, the voice loud enough that Steve heard it both through the comms and the open air.
Steve had thought about this, too, and he'd reached a different conclusion. "I have a better idea. You could come back home with me, instead."
"And I told you it's fine," Steve reassured him. "I'm a mess, too. I've just been taught to hide it better."
Tony raised his eyes towards Steve again, apologetic this time. "I'm sorry about that. I wasn't sure you'd believe me, or what your intentions were. Besides, if you'd tried to detain me, I might've hurt you."
Eventually, he did drift off, only to wake up to the sound of creaking floorboards. He sat up, looking around, ready to leap into action, but it was only Tony, halfway to the door, his silhouette just visible in the sliver of pale moonlight escaping the curtains.
Because Steve hadn't been sure what was going on. Because he'd thought he'd been wrong about what was going on. Because he'd thought Tony didn't want to talk to him. It all sounded like feeble excuses to him.
"Yeah, yeah, I'm okay," Steve replied, on reflex, even though he was well aware that he wasn't. He took the hand Rhodey was offering and got up, keeping his eyes away from the man who might very well be Tony Stark.
He wouldn't survive the fall, but he certainly wouldn't survive the explosion, either. His only chance of pulling through was to defuse the bombs and take control of the plane. He might still be able to do that. He wasn't about to give up.
In response, Iron Man squeezed Steve's nipples harder, enough to make him squirm and throw his head back, gasping with pleasure. With the sudden movement, his head ended up next to Iron Man's, their cheeks touching. Instantly, Iron Man let go with one hand, and brought it up to cover Steve's eyes. They had been closed, anyway.
Outside of the time Steve spent by Tony's bedside, helping him pass the time, he mostly hid in the room he'd been given, trying to lay low. He wasn't supposed to be in the country at all, let alone with the Avengers. Among the people who knew him, it was a bit of an open secret that he was staying at the complex. He had several conversations with Rhodes, most of them feeling like variations on a shovel talk, as well as Vision, who apologized that he had been elsewhere and unable to help when Tony had performed his unfortunate experiment.
"I'd like that, but I'm not sure it's possible," he finally answered. "My life's not so simple, either."
"We're not traveling with dinosaurs, so there's nothing to set us apart from everyone else in the North," Natasha reminded him. "No one will recognize us as foreigners. If we run into anyone, just let me do the talking, and it'll be fine."
Steve could fill in the rest. "And that's why the world has gone to hell in a handbasket." That was why so many things seemed so wrong about the laws and the organization overseeing them, and explained the emptiness and ever growing misery he’d glimpsed on the streets. He felt so angry he could barely breathe, fingers clenching around the plastic chair until it bent. "This can't go on. Someone has to do something."
He wondered if Tony knew what Ultron was up to. He considered the possibility that Ultron was the true villain here, with Tony somehow trapped under his influence, but that didn't seem to fit. Going by what Steve had seen of Tony, it was more likely that he knew, and that the AI's unpleasant personality was a deliberate programming choice on Tony's part.
And yet, somehow, in his final moments, watching the ice rush inevitably closer, amidst all the regret that he had missed his chances of ever being anything more than friends with her, there was the stray thought that maybe this was always going to happen. Maybe soulmates were real, after all, and this was why he hadn't been hers.
Pepper's eyes went wide. "Natalie? I did think she seemed a little shady, but I had no idea! Is that where you were yesterday, when I couldn't reach you? Talking to them?"
He's almost concluded that his effort was for nothing when he notices the shape at the nearer shore of a distant lake. It's so tiny that even his eyesight isn't enough to make out any details, but he thinks it could be a small cabin. Even though it's too far for him to be sure—there's still a chance it could be an oddly shaped solitary boulder—it's close enough that he thinks he should be able to reach it within a day, if he keeps up a good pace.
"Just let me walk away. No one needs to get hurt," Steve said, the gun pointed at his opponent's face.
Mr. Fedora didn't seem amused at Tony's attempt at small talk. His expression stayed neutral, but his eyes were intently focused on Tony. "Our boss wants something you've got."
As the minutes on the cab's display ticked closer to zero, Steve crouched to take a better look at the seat next to him. Of course, the anti-grav pack wasn't openly on display. It'd probably be released when some specific set of danger parameters was met.
In his dreams, Steve was traveling with Tony, but it was nothing like their current war-time quest in the bowels of Paris. They were adventuring together, climbing a magnificent mountain in a far away country just for the joy of it. Steve had never visited such a place before, and he was enjoying every second of it, with Tony as his skillful guide.
Steve was having dinner with Sam's family when the message arrived, bringing both the pleasant evening and his tour of the island to an abrupt end.
It occurred to Steve that the thread had appeared the very second when he had admitted his feelings to himself. It had been his realization that had brought it to existence, and that meant that Tony must've already known. Tony had been in love with him before, and Tony must've thought Steve didn't love him back. Had he been thinking that when they'd said their goodbyes, or had he come to terms with his feelings during the many days he'd spent alone, stranded in the pocket dimension? Steve couldn't decide which was worse.
The order made, they picked up their scattered clothes, got dressed, and sat down in the living room to wait for the delivery drone, Steve on the couch, Tony in the armchair. There was a lingering feeling of tension hanging in the air between them, and Steve didn't think it was from debating dinner payment. It might've been just the unfamiliarity of the situation, but Steve didn't think it was that, either. Tony seemed nervous, in a way Steve hadn't seen before, shifting in place, staring at his toes, his fingers drumming the armrests.
"If you think I have some kind of special influence over Tony, you're going to be disappointed," Steve said.
Tony didn't waste his breath on replying, and didn't slow down. Instead, he skirted to the left, hoping the thicker foliage there would hide him.
"Congratulations on your very successful first mission," the Mayor said to Bucky, a pleased smile on her lips. "Ambushing that caravan and bringing Stark to us through that lizard-infested jungle was no mean feat."
He's immeasurably glad when Steve returns with the pizza, and practically pushes Obie away from Tony with the plate.
It often occurs to him how much more time and energy he seems to be spending on regret over this android, compared to his regret over all the human lives that his weapons cut short, and that turns it all into a spiral that leaves him feeling nauseous with disgust over himself. Everything's wrong about this. Why does he care so much about that machine? What does it matter that his hands were the ones to take it apart, when he has the blood of thousands of people on them as well?
Taking a look skywards still revealed no sign of police vehicles, or of Ultron's drones coming after him. It was surprising. There was no way Tony wouldn't be tracking his frame, and that meant the drones would inevitably find him at some point. He was going to fight them when they did. He wasn't sure if the SI-built guns he had would let him fire at them, but he'd come up with something.
"Of course you'd say that," Bucky said, and backed away from Tony's cell. "I'll leave you to your meal. I'll be back in a few hours to escort you to the Vault, so you can get started there."
It was easier to keep his distance and do his best to ignore the whole thing. It'd be particularly easy now that Ultron was dealt with, there was a fresh crop of Avengers for Steve to train, and Tony could take an indefinite leave of absence from the team.
my bed, after all," Tony said. He lay down next to Steve, curling up against Steve's side, his head on the pillow next to Steve's, not quite touching. He kept his hands to himself, folding his arms between them.
"That's all right. You've already been more helpful than anyone else I've talked to so far." Steve gave her a thankful smile, and finished the lukewarm coffee in his cup. "One last question: where would you expect Tony to go, when he said he's going to lie low? Does he have any regular hideouts?"
They got dressed, which in Steve's case meant trying on three pairs of pants and four different shirts to find ones that fit. The one t-shirt he could actually pull on without worrying about split seams was still pretty much as tight as all the tailored ones he'd had in his wardrobe in the Tower. He decided it'd have to do; Tony quirked his lips and insisted that it looked much better on Steve than it ever had on him.
"So, if you had to guess where they've taken Tony—" Steve began, hoping Natasha could fill in that particularly crucial blank.
Steve's gut instinct was, just as Natasha had suggested, that they should all hurry ahead and try to find out as much as they could, as fast as possible, but she was probably right. The Northerners would recognize Steve as an outsider as soon as he opened his mouth, and even if he managed to question someone, he'd be lucky if he understood the answer he got.
The inside of the warehouse was mostly empty, with a few dust-coated crates here and there—and several dark figures who stepped out of the shadows to surround him as soon as the door had closed behind his back.
The only people Tony tells the entire truth about what happened are Pepper, Happy and Rhodey. They welcome this new, independent, growing and changing Steve into their little circle of friends, just like they accepted him as an android addition to Tony's household. They don't even seem too surprised when they find out that Tony and Steve's relationship isn't exactly platonic.
"What's stopping you? Even if you're professionally involved in that, it doesn't have to figure into your private life," Bruce said. "It's not like it's mandatory to have your sample in an amoromics database."
"You have?" That took Steve completely by surprise, and in a good way. Finally meeting someone who didn't think he was guilty was a huge relief. He let his arms hang loose, and gripped the back of the chair in front of him with one hand.
"I wish you could stay with me and never leave." There was a wistful undertone to Tony's voice, and he didn't need to say more for Steve to guess what was on his mind. Tony had exiled himself out here in the wilderness because he didn't think he could ever return to his old life. He also knew that Steve had all his duties as Captain America, and would only be able to visit this remote place every so often.
Tony had been taking a sip of coffee, and put his cup down with a clunk, giving Steve an exasperated look. "No, I could do it without the download process, even though timing it with the data traffic between the clinic and the storage facility will help mask what we're doing. That's not the issue. If you can come up with a way to kidnap Obie in his current clone within the next couple of days without anyone noticing, sure. Let us know."
He returned to his table and spent his time listening in on the conversations around him. None of them sounded unusual in the least, neither the ones in English nor the ones in Italian, which he only understood partially. By the time his soup arrived, he was convinced this had been a dead end, but at least he got to have dinner, so it wasn't a complete waste of time.
It was a terrible burden, and Steve hadn't really fully considered it from Tony's perspective. He could imagine wanting to do the same if he were in Tony's position; if he knew he was dangerous to other people, choosing to keep away from everyone, indefinitely, seemed like the safest solution. It couldn't possibly be the only one, though. Steve knew other people with powers that resembled Tony's. It wasn't beyond the realm of possibility that he could use them for good instead of chaos.
"Steve? I need you to get up. There's no time," the voice said again. It wasn't Natasha; the pitch was wrong.
Steve caught hold of Tony's fingers, lacing them with his own. "You already know more than most people. I'd love to teach you the rest."
He was floating in a void, like a really trippy virtual reality. He was caught in an electrical storm, every nerve on fire, just at the edge of painful, but just as it was becoming too much, it melted, transforming into warmth, into a feeling of being more relaxed than he'd been in his life. He didn't have a body anymore, he just existed in a state of deep satisfaction. Time had stopped; there was nothing but this moment.
Fury nodded. "That's up to you, of course. If you don't, you don't. If you ever change your mind, let us sort it out for you. As you may have heard, around here, it's private companies that do the matching. We'd rather not have you putting your genetic information out there, but we're on good terms with Stark Industries. I'm sure we can arrange something."
Stane looked perfectly unfazed, not showing the slightest reaction to the name. "Who? Your little adventure must've left you confused."
"Awesome," Steve said, grinning up at him, lifting his hips off the bed, trying to grind his cock against Tony.
"There's a lot of that going around today," Steve noted, casting a glance over his shoulder, where Bucky was standing nearby, looking like he wasn't sure if he should be there or not.
As usual, it felt like a relief to step into the streets without his costume. All of a sudden, he was just a regular nobody. Sure, an ill-fitting suit wouldn't hide that Steve Rogers was a tall and broad-shouldered man, but even if a pair of eyes here and there lingered on him because of that, at least no one would stare at him unashamedly, let alone ask for his autograph. He might have grown used to those things, but it didn't mean he liked them.
"Come here, you," Tony ordered, reaching to put one hand on Steve's back and to pull him into another, sloppy kiss. As his hands slid down Steve's body, he made a displeased hum. "You're still wearing pants."
He hadn't thought anyone could possibly hit him past all the leaves and trunks and bushes. Whoever had taken the shot must've been highly skilled.
Pepper raised her eyebrows at the screen, and after a brief interval of working out the connection with Happy—him tapping at the watch, her frowning and blinking—the view on the wall coalesced to a close-up of Tony's face.
He contemplated Tony’s shirt. Since this had been a planned mission, not some quick emergency takeoff, it was a long-sleeved t-shirt designed to be worn under the Iron Man armor. That also meant it was quite tight, and undressing it with Tony’s current injuries would be painful.
"He would've killed you," Steve returned. "For certain. He tried to, actually, when Natasha and Fury made their entrance, but I caught him and the shot went wide."
Steve had hoped that after being to hell and back in one very long sleepless night, he'd doze off as soon as he had the chance. Lying down in the dark, quiet room, cozy under his blanket, the pain in his head and neck down to a dull background ache, it should've been easy. Unfortunately, though not unexpectedly, it turned out to be everything but.
"No, you don't get it," Tony says. He can't have Steve forgiving him under false pretenses. "He was unresponsive, but he hadn't shut down."
As if Tony hadn't read Steve's letter a hundred times, and kept staring at that flip phone, half hoping, half dreading to hear it ring—not that he'd ever admit any of that to Steve. "As it happens, I
"You still haven't told me how you got it," Steve spoke up, and gave the metal plate beneath his fingers a light tap to clarify what he was talking about. "You promised you would."
"He probably could've, if he'd really wanted to," Miss Potts said, in a long-suffering tone, suggesting that she had some opinions on her employer. "I'm not going to defend his actions to you. He'll have to do that himself."
He looked out of the large windows. As far as he could tell, he wasn't being followed; he saw no sign of Ultron's drones. If he was lucky, his behavior hadn't raised any warnings yet. The cab's recognition software had figured out his identity, but the cab company should be keeping that information to themselves. He'd left his watch in a bathroom at the police station, which should confuse Ultron and buy him some time. He was fairly sure Tony would've had some type of tracking device installed in his frame, but he had no means of locating or eliminating it. He'd have to find a way to deal with it later.
"We've done our best to protect your privacy," the nurse replies. "As far as I know, the news that you've been found isn't out yet."
"Evening, Ed. I think I owe you one," he said, placing a glass in front of Tony, then pulling up a chair for himself.
Luckily, they'd managed to get a message through to Jarvis, who was probably already on his way to them with a backup team. There was no telling how long it would take to find a route to where Steve and Tony rested and clear the rubble blocking the passage, but it was only a matter of time. Unless something unexpected happened, they were in no real danger.
"How about these voices you heard from her apartment? Do you think hers was one of them?" Steve checked.
"Are we doing this again?" Steve growled. They'd had similar conversations before, and out of the many times he'd come very close to punching Howard in the face, these were some of the closest. "You're saying that couples that don't match on some mystical level are inferior. Well, chances are that soulmates aren't even real and this is all in their heads. Maybe there isn't that one perfect match for anyone. Even if there is, that doesn't make them better than the rest."
"A lot better than this one. Smoke inhalation and some nasty burns. He went to the hospital with a police escort, and will probably stay there for several days," the same man replied.
He tried to keep going as fast as he could. The footsteps behind him were getting closer. The Northerners were gaining on him, no matter how he tried to hurry.
"You don't need to thank me. I know you would've done the same. You already did, in a way. If you and the others hadn't gotten me out, I'd still be a bunch of inert data in a high-security storage vault." Steve switched to run his hand over Tony's arm, hugging him closer.
"He's my friend," Steve had said, facing Tony's armored form without fear or hesitation. Not an apology, but an explanation.
Steve tried to picture the young man he'd known living through all these things, and turning into the person he was today. Had all those losses and the decades that had passed broken something to make him lose all empathy? Steve couldn't claim to understand the human psyche that well, nor to know what eighty years of living with that baggage would do to someone, but it still felt overly simplistic and didn't ring true to him.
There were no words, at first. Steve sat down on the ground next to Tony and put his arms around him. Tony trailed his hand up Steve's back to his hair and pulled him into a kiss so intense, it left him woozy. He still didn't want to let go. Saying that he'd needed this more than he'd needed air would've been a romantic exaggeration, but it also wouldn't have been too far from the truth.
"Steve, this is Happy. Happy, this is Steve. He packs a mean punch and is going to lend you a hand babysitting me," Tony introduces them to each other.
"Of course." Steve pressed the button to open the doors. "See you tomorrow, Tony," he added, casting a glance over his shoulder.
Wherever he is, from the survival perspective, he's slightly concerned about the weather. If early afternoon is like this, the night will probably be chilly. It might even get to sub-zero Celsius. He'll need shelter or he'll be in trouble.
Steve sat down next to Tony, folding his arms on his lap, his eyes on the fire. His words, when he spoke up, were muted. "I'm sorry."
Again, Steve was left with nothing to do but wait. Telling himself that this was the last stretch of waiting didn't help much, since he knew it would be the longest wait of all. The re-framing procedure had been streamlined and made much faster since Steve's day, but the entire process, from thawing out a new clone to transferring Stane's mind into it and then running pre-wakeup medical checks, could take up to an hour. Hopefully, Steve and the others wouldn't have to sit around doing nothing for quite that long. As soon as Tony confirmed that he and Jarvis had successfully inserted the virus that'd destroy Stane's backups, Team Three could finally advance with their part of the plan, infiltrating the clinic.
At his front step stands the figure that's been haunting his dreams ever since he first set eyes on it in that cave, only it's intact and alive, and a thousand times more beautiful because of it. The android's eyes, framed by long, dark lashes, are a vivid blue that reflects the glowing LED at his temple. His skin is fair over the flawless features of his face, his blond hair neatly combed, with a part on the left. He's not wearing a uniform but dark jeans and a light gray CyberLife t-shirt that's so tight, it looks like it was painted on; Tony can see his synthetic nipples through it.
Steve's waiting for him in the kitchen, breakfast laid out. Tony thinks he seems subdued, but maybe he's just reading too much into what's actually a neutral expression. At least Steve's LED has gone back to its usual blue.
There were other things he needed to take care of today: he should check in with Bucky, and let Pepper Potts know he'd found Tony, even if he couldn't share any of the details. None of that would take him all day, though.
Iron Man by night, genetic match-maker wannabe by day. Who would've thought. His life was so weird now. A lot of the time, he actually liked it.
The way Iron Man was touching him was almost reverent, like he was trying to memorize the outline of each muscle, tracing the still wet skin of Steve's abs, over his sides, then back up again, across his ribs. This time, he pinched the nipples between his fingers with both hands, though it was a tentative touch. He didn't speak a word, and yet Steve could tell this was a question.
His first thought would've been that this was some kind of joke, but it couldn't possibly be. Not after everything he'd suffered, and not with how serious and honest Lina seemed about this. He couldn't imagine what she'd gain by making up such a fantastical lie.
The thought of standing in front of Steve and not sharing any of Steve's feelings did nothing to help with the tears. He felt like he wasn't breathing quite right, but he was pretty sure that was just emotions, not some kind of side effect. God. He was pathetic.
"You'll be too busy admiring all the breathtaking views to even notice," Tony said wistfully. "Trust me, as incredible as the rest of the island is, there aren't many places that can rival the home of the skybaxes and their pilots."
Sure, Steve was enjoying Canyon City just as much as Tony had promised. It was every bit as magical as Tony had said: a labyrinth of stone carved by both nature and people; an architectural miracle that was like Venice but in three dimensions, its canals full of open air instead of water.
Steve lifted his gaze to finally see Tony eye to eye. "Yes. I'm done lying," he said, in the most unwavering tone he could muster.
The situation had suddenly turned completely unreal, and yet, he could feel the floor beneath his buttocks, the terry cloth of the towel covering his shoulders, and the hard surface of Iron Man's armor behind his back. And he could feel the warmth of Iron Man's bare fingers against his cheek, which was enough to make the discomfort meaningless.
Steve felt like his thoughts were already skirting topics that he was better off avoiding. As much as he wanted to know more about what was going on, he didn't actually need to see it. "No. It's enough that I know it's done."
He's not quite Hawkeye when it comes to hitting targets, but Steve has super-soldier abilities and years of practice aiming his shield. The very first rock he throws catches one of the birds hard enough to stun it. The rest let out panicked clucking sounds and run and take off around Steve as he rushes forward to grab his prey. He wrings its neck to kill it as quickly and painlessly as he can.
Pepper shook her head ever so slightly and pulled away from him. "I'm sure you can get to the bottom of this, eventually," she declared. "I'll help you as much as I can. Feel free to ask me whenever you need anything. I have to go now."
The surroundings of the town were mostly shrouded in darkness, and they made sure to avoid any areas reached by light from within the walls. As they got closer, they split up, with the trio heading for the gates keeping a direct course, Natasha veering to the left and Steve to the right, now moving at a jog.
Even through the haze of want, Steve could tell Tony was more hesitant than he would've been in the past—the way he took Steve in his mouth was slow and tentative, and maybe he might've swallowed more of Steve's length before than he did now. Not that Steve cared. Tony's hand squeezed firmly around the base of his cock, covering the rest of it, and he started sucking Steve off in earnest, finally, finally giving Steve that tightness and friction and heat that he'd been craving.
"If first base is like this, I don't think I've got the stamina for much more today," Tony said ruefully.
The dissidents had cut off all contact with the rest of the island and abandoned most of the traditions. They even had their own dialect of the language, based on the typical speech of the Northern towns. Overall, Natasha had said, most of them were ordinary people, not too different from the rest of Dinotopia. Only a small clique was pushing for active violence against dinosaurs, trying to incite the rest of their people into open conflict. Many of them were recent arrivals to the island, and whatever they had been up to in the outside world, it certainly hadn't been philanthropy.
"Thanks," Steve said, wrapping his fingers around the cold glass, trying to draw some semblance of calm from it. This encounter was so completely unexpected that it was throwing him for a loop.
As someone fresh out of a war, it was mind-boggling to Steve that the Dinotopians had so little information on their enemies. All they had to go on for planning this desperate rescue was a map with the main Northern settlements marked on it. The distance from the closest to the farthest one was over a hundred miles. They could spend months and months moving from town to town and combing the wide expanse of the Plains between them.
Steve peeled back the paper and stuck the medication under his tongue, staring at his blanket-covered legs.
Tony lay down in turn, across Steve's thighs, his ass angled up, his head resting on crossed arms. "Okay. Give it to me."
"I could bring a doctor to take a look at you," Bucky suggested. Surely the Mayor would agree to that, because if Stark truly was badly ill, he wouldn't be able to work until he got better—and if he wasn't, a doctor would be able to tell.
They stopped at a closed door that, unlike most others on Stane's private floor, had a lock on it. Even though Ultron knew who Stane was, he still didn't open it until Stane had passed an additional identification scan. When he had, the door slid aside to reveal a small room with four VR chairs set back to back in the middle, one facing each corner. Only a single chair was occupied, and it was undoubtedly the same one Steve had seen in Stane's message.
Even in the Wakandan jet T'Challa had graciously lent Steve, much faster than any commercial airplane would've been, the flight seemed to take far too long.
"It's a lot more complicated than that, but you don't need the gory details." Fury waved a hand in the air. "Does the name Hydra mean anything to you?"
Tony bit his lip, berating himself. He didn't want to push away the last person he'd ever talk to. "I'm sorry, Seren. That wasn't nice of me," he said placatingly. "It's just—honestly, I'm scared. I don't want to give up, but there's nothing I can do."
"All those years trapped with Obie, I kept thinking about you," Tony murmured. "Sometimes I imagined you there with me, telling me to keep going. And I thought, if I ever got out, I'd get you out, too."
Tony, who has closed his eyes for a moment, opens them again with a frustrated look on his face. "This is ridiculous, I literally just woke up. And the hard part—that's obviously the small zoo's worth of elephants in the room."
Steve wouldn't have been able to wait much longer if he'd wanted to. Tony's words and the things his nimble, hot fingers were doing pushed Steve right over the edge. The world turned into a heat haze of pleasure as he came hard, spurting all over Tony's chest, Tony's name on his lips.
He manages to stand up and take a few steps, but he doesn't get far until he stumbles again, and finds himself on his hands and knees.
"There are so many options here." Tony drew the knife away from Steve's face and set it down lower, at the dip between his collarbones. "Lots of ground to cover. Luckily, we also have lots of time." He sliced downwards, cutting a sharp line of pain down along his sternum. Steve bit his teeth together, struggling not to cry out.
"You didn't mean for that to happen," Steve pointed out. He did think Tony had been reckless and meddled in something he didn't really understand, but he didn't blame Tony, not really.
Bucky hadn't seen any of the big predators yet, but it'd been creepy enough camping the previous night, taking turns to defend their ground from the many smaller, nocturnal dinosaurs roaming the jungle. The sounds they'd heard and the flashes of teeth and claws that he'd seen had been enough to make his hair stand on end. He wasn't used to being around dangerous animals, and even less so when it came to prehistoric monsters.
Towards the top of the hill, the terrain grows more rocky, in places steep enough that he needs to use all his limbs to scramble upwards. He enjoys the challenge. It does cross his mind that if he happened to slip and injure himself out here, he could end up in serious trouble, but he's not overly worried. He's agile and he heals fast. He doesn't slow down.
Steve considered whether he should go and visit Tony right away, but that seemed overzealous. It was getting late, and Tony, even if he hadn't been hurt, had clearly been through a distressing experience. Steve would let him catch a night's sleep, and go see him tomorrow. Hopefully he'd remember more, then.
He could hear that he was being pursued, no doubt by Natalie, maybe by others as well. Casting a glance over his shoulder, he was relieved and surprised to see just her, some thirty meters behind him. He'd made some headway, and he was fairly sure his frame was faster, so he should be able to outrun her.
Tony hadn't seen a single firearm in the years since he'd ended up here. It was a shocking reminder of the past, even if these were a haphazard collection of different vintages, from something that looked like a modernized take on a musket to a rifle suitable for big-game hunting. That could certainly hurt a dinosaur. The thought that someone would want to harm the gentle beasts was nauseating; aside from the wilder predators who roamed this jungle, the dinosaurs wouldn't harm a fly.
There was nothing at the hut to suggest Tony having stopped by. It doesn't look as if he's been here. Steve considers the possibility that he might've gone somewhere else instead, but this hut is the only building Steve has seen in any direction from any viewpoint. Tapio confirms that: "No house, no hut, only mountains and lakes and reindeer until the town."
"You're still not that old," Steve returned, nudging Tony's side with his elbow. "And who said you're tired? You definitely didn't, which is exactly the point I was making."
"No, there isn't, but tell you what," Tony began, and shifted to face Steve, wrapping his arm around Steve's waist. "I don't need to go anywhere for several hours. If you're not in a hurry, I wouldn't mind spending that time with you."
The fish isn't much longer than his hand from heel to fingertips, and the amount of meat he gets out of it once he's burned it to a crisp on the fire leaves him almost as hungry as he was to start with. He eats the skin and tries to suck every ounce of nutrients from the bones.
In hindsight, he realizes that the time that passed between Tony's call for help and Steve finding him couldn't possibly have been long enough for rigor mortis to set in. Tony's limbs are rigid because of the cold, not death. Embarrassing as it is to admit, Steve was too horrified to think clearly, and he saw the worst case scenario instead of what was actually in front of his eyes.
One evening, on the way back to his cell, he asked James if he could maybe get a warmer blanket. It was nothing more than a hopeful whim, so he was surprised and pleased when James answered with "sure, I'll see if I can find you one."
