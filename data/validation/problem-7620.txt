Steve smiles softly at the videos and sees how small he is and how adorable he is. "Please tell me you got his first word and steps on video."
Peter nodded brightly as he jumped out of his bed towards his closet, browsing through his clothes as he bounced in his spot before pulling out his Captain America costume holding it up to his dad. "Imma wear dis one!"
The super soldier looked over at his family as he spoke. “You want to have Peter order for himself?”
When Zemo played the video, the surveillance video of a recognized street- he knew it, the same street he recognized, the same street where the said car crash of his parents happened.
"Worlds Governments are in pieces, uh... the parts that are still working-,"
"I didn't tell you about our son," he started playing with his finger still looking down. "I could have saved everyone the pain by telling you i was pregnant that day-,"
"Hmmm," he thought looking through Netflix "Maybe something Disney.. finding Nemo?"
"His first word came out of nowhere," he laughed so. "His first word was thwip- don't even know where it came from," he hummed. "Of course i have his first steps, Pep helped- so did Nat when she was here before she left."
He immediately nodded leaning up to wrap his arms around his newfound other father that he asked about for years- stuffing his face into his shirt as he brought him into a tight hug, feeling his fathers arms wrap around him, hand rubbing up and down his back, consoling him as he whispered reassuring words letting him cry it all out.
"What?" He spoke through the radio as he started making his way to the control center knowing that's where she was. "Did you get a location of Thanos coordinates?" He tried not to sound excited.
"Hi, I'm sorry, but who are you?" Tony replied with slight sarcasm as he walked towards the recovering Bruce.
"Have i seen you around before?" He asked, he was holding flowers and sauerkraut. "What’s your name feller?"
"Aye, indeed," the god nodded before turning to the rest of the team. "Show me this footage,"
With one arm holding his son, he removed the web and continued walking before plopping his son down on the chair. "If you move, I will take away your toys and we will not go to the park for a long time, do you understand?" He gave him a look and honestly he was just so tired and grouchy. But the toddler didn't even reply and just crossed his arms while huffing. He just sat there pouting with a glare towards his dad, so he just walked away sitting down on the couch with his head in his hands, massaging his temples.
Teeth clanking, lips messily drooling down their chins as Steve starts going faster, as they moan into each other's mouths. Tony cups Steve's cheek muttering praises as they slowly reach each other's highs as his hand moves to his hair, gripping it, his whole body feeling like it was in heaven right god.
----------------------------------------------------------
"Sir, my system is telling me this is Steven Grant Rogers,"
Peter stayed cuddled up to his father, loving the attention even though he wished he had both of his dads both here with him. The two seemed to relax before Tony's phone went off with the message appearing up on the front screen saying as he checked who could it be.
Steve instantly knew that Tony was about to cry. He gently pulled the man's head over to him and kisses his lips softly. "Babe. It's going to be okay." He whispers.
"I will, can you put the food in the fridge for me?" he asked with a smile, leaning up to press a kiss to his cheek before heading to their son's room after hearing a confirming reply from his husband. After tucking him in, making sure the nightlight was plugged in and made sure he had his favorite stuffed animal, he headed out of the room with the door slightly ajar and went out to join Steve on the couch, smiling at the arm that was wrapped around him.
Nat shrugged. "He can be a mother hen but I'm sure we can just be a little sneaky, he is a human who needs sleep,"
"Steve," he looked at him half pleading and half-serious. "They’re not going to let you be on the same team if you- I’m trying to do the right thing here-,"
Steve looks at Tony and looks super nervous. He then looks back at Peter and frowns.
Steve looked over at Peter and Tony and smiled slightly. Every time he saw his ex and his son, he felt regret and guilt come boiling into his chest. Natasha notices and then looks over at Tony and waves softly, wanting to seem friendly to him still. She leads Steve away so that if he broke down, which she understood if he did, he wouldn’t do it around Tony and Peter.
Tony said softly "good night princess," before he left and went towards the bedroom, taking a deep breath as he walked in to see Steve preparing for a shower, sliding off his grey shirt.
He groaned as he pushed his hips up before pausing to dig his heels into the sheets, digging his fingers into Tony's hips, holding him up and he fucks up into him fast knowing the both of them won't last too long he knew Tony was so close.
He smiled and turned to Steve. “You know what you’re getting right?”
-----------------
She smiled as he wiggled in her little bed trying to get comfortable. "Tell me a story,”
"Oh, I think you and him both will absolutely love it," pumping some shampoo and conditioner into his hand, scrubbing it into his scalp and strands of hair. Tony nodded with a hum, finishing up in the shower, and stepped out. "Go keep the little bugger occupied, I'll be out in a minute," Steve spoke as his husband grabbed his towel drying off, getting dressed into his comfy clothes after, and went into the bedroom.
"I'm sorry to interrupt the moment- but Id likes to take Tony to the medical wing.
"I won’t- i really am fine, just need to think about something okay? I’ll join you upstairs in a couple of minutes,"
The patient asks to not list the other father, the other father is in not the picture (unknown)
Steve smiles softly at Tony and reaches for his hand. He didn't know what to say but was happy Tony was giving him another chance
Silence came over the group after Bruce and Pepper carried Tony back to the medical wing leaving Nat, Rhodes, Nebula, Carol, and Rocket, along with Steve himself who had to take a seat after the events, putting his face in his hands.
Avengers and SHIELD tried to rectify the situation but it was Dr.Banner's testimony that brought about the end of an era. They had turned San Francisco into an infectious, gas-filled quarantine zone as the council told them. That they had unleashed diseased powerful beings that wreak havoc throughout the nation, many that are unidentified. And Bruce was the one to tell the judge that yes, he believed the Avengers were a danger to society.
Steve chuckles at the pen and reaches for Tony's hand but stops as Tony stuffs his hands in his pockets, frowns at his reaction, and looks away to the side.
Glancing at his husband he asked. “You mind driving honey?” He gave him a small smile, he knew the man was tired but when Peter asked for one of them to sit with him, he couldn’t say no.
"Hmm?"
"Steve, you gotta see this!" Nat called the supersoldier on the radio. The soldier was in the middle of his nightly workouts, beating his wrapped pale knuckles against the sandbag before sending it across the room, it always has happened so he had a few extras laying off to the side. Wiping his face off with the towel on his shoulder walking over to his duffel bag grabbing his radio and bag.
"Go shower you, big dork," Tony replied jokingly.
"That'd be cool, but no lasers- not until he's older for sure," Steve chuckled. "I know how much you love your lasers,"
Tony whined a little tilting his head back, Steve stopped for a moment to strip off both of their shirts and tugged off Tony's sweatpants along with his boxers, running his fingertips over his length still keeping a soft smirk on his face, keeping his eyes on Tony.
Tony paused for a moment, his hand resting on the metal door, bunching up into a fist as emotions were pricking at his eyes. Taking a deep breath he slowly turned back around to face the girl. "You think I don't know that? I've replayed that day a thousand times in my head," He sarcastically pointed towards his brain. "The Avengers take the fall, despite saving the day and that bastard Tarleton walks away smelling like a rose, and guess what? No one cares- no one cares," he glared towards Bruce before turning his attention back to Kamala. "The world needed someone to blame and HE gave them their scapegoat,"
"Yeah, you're damn right you deserved it!" Tony furrowed his eyebrows pointing a finger at him. "Do the Avengers pose a danger to society? That was the question, Bruce, THAT was the question,"
He chuckled and got up, picking him up starting to spin him around, with Peter holding onto him tightly, excitedly shouting. "Faster, Faster!"
When he stared into those ocean blue eyes again- emotions crashed over him all over again. "Holy shit... you're alive," Tony immediately got back to work, pulling at all the restraints on him, he'd answer any of his questions when he could feel him in his arms again.
"Damn he's asleep," The super soldier spoke with a little chuckle, but sweetly. "Maybe you should go ahead and take him to bed,"
"We were outsmarted!"
Pause.
"I know, we have to teach him how to control it sometime as well- this isn't the first time something like this has happened you know," Steve said sadly as he pulls into the garage and parked in the spot they came out of, he turned off the car and grabbed the leftovers as he got out of the car.
"Can't make that promise,"
Steve nods and smiles softly. "Hey, I'm here though... I'm here with you and my son. I'm not mad."
Steve shakes his head and sighs. "He's hurt, Pepper. And that whole spiel he just had, all of that was true. How can I not beat myself up?"
Tony looked at himself, indeed he was- his eyes reverted to his right side and there was his bandaged shoulder blade where the arm once met. He didn’t see this coming obviously, he thought he died- the thought of almost losing everyone he loved and now possibly can never be the engineer he once was, made him start tearing up
"I always tell you if i discover something," he laughed softly pulling the male close by his legs and played with his hair softly
"What exactly is this Starboost thing?"
Tony lightly cackled as they lay down, pulling the covers over them with Steve sandwiched Peter in between him and Tony, settling to relax with Peter cuddling up to Tony holding his Spider toy close to him as he immediately knocking out into a deep sleep with Tony rubbing his back watching him silently, not wanting to wake him up easily.
He rolled his eyes lightly. "If you promise me a good time maybe," he laughed jokingly shooing him off upstairs as he went to the study sitting down. “Look at a mod inspiration, let me see what check out. So, recommend one last sim before we pack it in for the night. This time, in the shape of a Mobius strip, inverted, please,” in front of the holographic table, he starts looking into this time heist thing and the atoms
Peter looked up at his dad before looking back at the menu, mostly using the pictures to decide what he wanted then looked back at him after deciding what he wanted, he nodded. “I’ll do it myself, I’m a big boy!” he excitedly spoke.
Steve smiles and messes with his hair as they cuddle on the couch.
Steve smiles as he sees his husband wake up. "Hey, babe."
"I don't know bug, I really don't," he said honestly, he didn't know the reason why it was like he and Steve switched roles, he used to always be in the basement working on new projects but he stopped to spend more and more time with their son.
Steve panicked but he just sat there and did what he would normally do when visiting patients and helping people around the hospital. "Hey, buddy. You're okay. You just got out of surgery. You're fine and your dad is fine too."
“Mhm! We played with toys and dad chased me around while I crawled up the wall!” He replied with a huge grin on his face.
--------------------------------------
"I still love you, no matter what. And I'm here to help you."
"Maybe- maybe I really really want your cock right now," His cheeks flushed. "Don't even care about being prepped more, just want your cock," he rambled with a soft whine, turning his head to look at him.
"Where did you even get all this?"
-------------------------------------------------------
Tony snapped out of it and looked to his son and they started walking again cause that’s all he could think of to do, he didn’t want to turn around either. "Yeah? What’s up kid?"
"We're trying to take senescence- and it looks like he did what he said he was going to do... Thanos wiped out 50% of the population of the world,"
"Well I make robots and machines that can do super duper cool things, like the iron man suits in the basement- but you're not allowed to go down there by yourself do you understand me?" He gave him a soft but stern look.
"The one where you're in my lap?"
"Today's day? 21? No, wait- 22. You know if it wasn't for the existential terror of steering into the literal void of space- I'd say I'm feeling a little better today." Tony let out a small chuckle before coughing slightly and continued. "The infections run through its course thanks to the blue meanie back there- oh you would love her," He said referring to Nebula who helped them fight on Titan. "Very practical, only a tiny bit sadistic,"
"That's your fault," Tony teased, leaning in pecking his pouty lips. "Go to sleep, you big dork,"
He sniffles and sighs softly. He looks up with a soft smile and tiredly lays his head in Tony's chest and quickly falls asleep.
Steve looks up at the door quickly but then down at Peter. He paused for a moment before nodding. His voice was caught in his throat as he realized something. 'He fights with Tony... That's why he's here... He got hurt in a fight...' He feels tears run down his cheeks but then speaks after he clears his throat. "Yeah... I am... I mean, I was,"
“Okay..,” Peter just sort of mumbled though his mind was still racing. “...Do you both have powers like me?”
And with that Tony’s eyes closed, he passed out from the number of injuries he received.
Suddenly, everything just began to shake. Was this an earthquake? Steve thought to himself, turning off the water and throwing down his towel as he threw on one of his long shirts and ran out of the room to find a window. What he saw almost made his heart skip a few beats. He spotted a ship being carried by a bright-looking star as it was making a landing in front of the compound. Steve along with the others ran outside to meet the newcomer especially with a hope to see whos inside the ship, I mean there must be a reason for her to bring this here.
Peter fell back to where he was laying down on the chair with his head upside down. "Nooo, can i just go play now?"
"Can I move now?" he asked less than even a minute later.
Peter pouted at this, going back to his playroom and busied himself with playing pretend- but after his son left, he sighed in relief silently wishing he had a certain super soldier home to help him out. He lightly rolled his eyes, he dropped out just so he could be with his new family so why couldn't Steve do the same? Taking another deep breath, he finished up the two omelets for them both before calling out for Peter to come down for breakfast.
Watching the door open slowly and stepping in, he spotted the holding orb, a circular metal cell as it spun around before coming to a complete stop after a minute and dropped down onto the devalued flooring that fit it perfectly
Steve chuckled lightly pulling his hips up so his lower body was slanted up. He spits into his hand stroking his cock as he slicks himself up, getting behind him. "This position okay doll? We can switch it up if you want mm?" he asked as he slides in, moaning at the warmth around him.
Tony was chasing around their little four-year-old toddler Peter, almost running out of breath himself, Jesus why do toddlers have so much energy- but that little bug was running around naked because he didn't want to get dressed in his onesie after taking his nightly bath so he ran off.
There was a good minute silence before Tony leaned back in his chair.
It was like AIM wanted the Avengers gone for good- probably cause they knew how powerful and now with the Chimera in the air, they would probably be able to defeat them easier. They wouldn't retreat no matter how many enemies would be destroyed, lights of purple would show up everywhere as more and more as they attacked the comms, the turbines, shutting down JARVIS, the reactor that powered the ship, even shutting down alot of the doors while destroying the walls.
Kamala waltz over to the war table as they all gathered around. "JARVIS, A-are you done?"
“Hey Village Boy, how about you choose?” Tony asked as he set Peter down on his feet. Once set down, he looked at them all. After a quick inspection, he ran over to a red Corvette that they had, exclaiming. “This one! This one!” excitedly saying, jumping up and down.
"Why?" He asked his pout to stay as he looked up at the male holding him. "Dunt wanna talk,"
“Steve,” Nat snapped him out of his thoughts.
He had to make this right.
"Not yet but he will soon, can you change out of these pajamas? Put something nice on for papa?" replied with a soft chuckle.
Tony blinked for a few seconds as he tried to process. "You realize we have a kid aboard the ship now right?" his cheeks flushed slightly, shivering at his touch.
Steve smiles and hugs his son tightly in his arms. "Hey, bud. Happy birthday." He whispers and rubs his back gently.
"Oh yes I can mister," he said with a slight tone picking him up as he made his way to the living room where they had a chair that sat in the corner for a time out for these tantrums. He almost ended up dropping him as Peter started squirming and punching his little fists at his arms and even managed to shoot a web at his father's face.
He smiles and looks over at Tony. "nope. I was taking my time so you could possibly join me."
He leans into him and sniffles softly as he tries to calm down.
Steve nods and smiles brightly. "Thanks, babe."
The silence took over the room as Tony ripped off the detachable arc reactor, grabbing steves hand and slammed it into his hand, already becoming breathless from the air supply.
He smiles brightly before turning off the light and leaving the room.
“I will don’t worry,” Tony chuckled as he pulled Peter upon his shoulder so he could be seen as they went up to the counter to order.
They pulled up to the restaurant turning off the car and getting out once they were there, along with Tony getting out of the car as his husband got Peter out, their son hurrying to his pops side where he held his finger, waiting impatiently for his dad to hurry and get out of the car wanting to hold his finger too. When he finally got out and allowed Peter to hold his finger and they all together walked inside, luckily for them the restaurant was about empty, they walked in line with no trouble.
Steve nodded and slowly made his way into the room where his ex once stood by, entering with his keycard. He really disliked snooping don't get him wrong but he just wanted to help Tony in any way, shape, or form, even if they hate Tony for him was still big.
Steve looked over to Tony, giving a little smile at the gesture. “Oh really? Why do I no doubt that?” He asked- He had come home with a scratch along his eyebrow, though with his work, it wasn’t anything now.
"Papa, am I a spider?" He heard Peter asked curiously.
He smirked adding his third, moving his other hand to wrap it around Tony's waist to keep him steady watching the male just shiver in pleasure as he fell forward on his chest, his hands in Steve's blond hair, gripping on it tightly as the blonde's fingers stroking his inner walls so deliciously good, grazing against that one place that made him go so godly crazy and sent him into so much pleasure.
Morgan lays her head on his chest, eyes looking at him. "Daddy gonna be okie? Wheres daddy’s other arm,"
Then it happened.
Steve stopped at the doorframe, his hand resting on the wood before he turned, spotting Tony attempting to sit up. The captain rushed over.
"...Long night?"
Steve held Peter close and smiles softly. "C'mon. Let's get the juice pops then go back up to check on Tony."
His eyes widen a little surprised, raising a hand- no not to slap him- but instead resting on the back of his neck, the hand with his old ring.
"So it probably underground, you’ll need to go find more of the stuff we use to get home,"
"Done!" he said excitedly
Steve smiles and nods at Tony. "Thanks, Tony." He gently kisses his son's head. "I love you bud." He whispers to his son.
"What? You know this shameless Elton John fan?" Tony asked leaning back in his computer chair, watching as she sighed with a slight eye roll.
He nods slowly fiddling with the rings again. "W-why’d you go?"
Steve took a deep breath biting his lip as he presses his lips to Tony's knuckles. Waiting another minute before he stood up, pressing another kiss to his forehead, setting down the detachable arc reactor on the bedside table before he started his way out but he was stopped by a hoarse voice behind him.
"Don't feel bad about this okay?- I'm mean, actually if you grovel about this for a couple of weeks... and then move on with enormous guilt,"
"He would've taken it off years ago, today wouldn't change his mind," she laughed softly. "He spoke his mind, i think you should see him when he wakes up, sort it out"
He moved one of his hands to Tony's hip lightly stroking it as he used the other to flick at Tony's sensitive nipples as he slowly starts flicking his hips up into Tony, lightly groaning, fuck it felt so good after being away for 3 years.
Tony nodded as he followed Steve into their bedroom, taking the toddler from his husband only to raise him and blowing raspberries on his stomach making him squeal.
"Mhm..," the brunette mumbled as he drifted off into sleep.
"Damnit..,"
"I'm headed home now"
Steve chuckles and walks off toward the shower. "I'm not stinky but okay." He chuckles.
“Down bullshit me Rogers” he snapped at him. “Did you know,”
He nods. "Not too early but also earlier than expected." He says softly and kisses Tony's head.
“What about my ice cream papa?” Peter cut in before he could say that was all, which made Tony mentally facepalm, cursing at himself for forgetting, immediately apologizing to him, and ordered a vanilla ice cream cone. He pulled out his wallet as the total was being read at him giving the cashier his card as he handed over Peter to Steve.
"No...," He could barely get out, it came out like a whisper as it sunk in and the sound of Hulk roaring didn't even comprehend to Tony.
Steve couldn't take it anymore and fast-walked over to Tony almost sprinting as he embraced him, tears already building up in his eyes, the brunette's arms wrapping around him as they just enjoyed the presence of each other, leaving the past behind them at that moment.
He flinched a little as Steve rose his voice a little and looked back down still leaned against the wall. "I tried to do what i believed what waa right but i was wrong," he said a little low voicer
SHIELD joined them on the Chimera and helped around, that only problem was- they were having trouble finding the other 3 Avengers... Natasha, Barton, and Thor. Knowing Nat and Barton they were undercover around the world and hard to track. While Thor- hell he's a god, he could be anywhere. That all changed when at the AntHill, where the resistance stayed, Kamala found out about the captive Inhumans kept in a secure location- no one would take her side and help her- so she snuck out with the help of Theo- an inhuman who could make portals - but it would be too late for anyone to realize she's gone.
((awe nuuu tho that is a mood
Tony smiled as he bounced the little dude before he put in his order of two cheeseburgers and some fries with a vanilla shake, Steve ordered his Big Mac with a side of fries and a drink.
He had to make this right.
"Daddy stop it!" he giggled trying to get away, his cheeks flushed. He set Peter on the bed once in the bedroom grabbing comfy clothes from the dresser.
After Tony spoke the three famous lines the enemies started dusting away. But it came with the consequence that happened to Bruce. His arm of the gauntlet was burned badly under his armor, one side of his face was the same as he weakly laid against the rocks as he watched the enemies go. He did it, fuck he did it
"Daddy watch this!" Peter shouted excitedly as he attached a web to the branch then went upside down on the branch only attached by a web string.
"Okay," He sort of mumbled. Once the web was off, he went over to eat after pulling himself up onto the chair. "When will daddy be home?" He asked with his bug eyes.
Steve gently kisses Morgan's forehead and smiles. "I love you, princess." He whispers to Morgan.
Steve ended up walking out in just some sweatpants, smiling at the sight as he walked over bringing the two into a hug. Tony kissed both of their heads with a smile. "Alright, alright, bedtime for the three of us,"
"Oh my god, Tony,"
“Model rendered,”
Steve smiles as he watches Tony sign the papers. He helps him by holding the papers down and then kisses Tony's cheek. He then turns to Peter and smiles faintly. "Pete... Would you be mad if I signed too?" He asks softly.
He looked down at Tony with a confused look. "Why were you cursing?" He asks and kisses his lips.
Stark sighed as Peter squirmed and hit him as he took him from the drone before sitting down on the couch just keeping the kids in his arms, he was tired and frustrated, just wondering how Steve kept him calm and in place when he was around, and he wouldn't let go and it wasn't long before Peter gave up, pouting in his dad's arms.
"No, no"
"I feel like i deserve any karma that gets me," Tony shrugged and refilled his glass of scotch, now on the screen was showing toddler peter and him building his first robot dog.
Tony gave a soft smile as Peter giggled. "I love you too, Pops,"
Steve nodded, pressing a kiss to the top of his head. “Me too bud... I wish I did too,” He whispered, more like his voice croaked. “I wish I would’ve been there for you… I’m so sorry I wasn’t around,”
Tony let out a sigh of relief as he kissed the top of his head softly. "You and Pops are going to have a nice little talk tonight Pete," he whispered because he hated yelling- only if he had to- besides he was too close to breaking his eardrum.
Inside, were surgeons surrounded what looked like an operating table, muttering among themselves as they locate broken bones and stitching many cuts and places they've had to cut open, reconnecting bones best they could with their type of technology. He frowned at the sight as he stood by asking around about what he could help out about.
Steve smiles over at Tony and nuzzles into his family as they watch the movie.
Steve turned the microphone to the creator of it all, Doctor George Tarleton, one of the best scientists they have. Tarleton went into how they found the power source and what it could lead to in the future for the Avengers- but of course, he was interrupted by none other but the famous Tony Stark's late entrance as his loud blasting ACDC music played throughout the stage's speaker, flying out from a balcony as he landed down onto the stage, greeting everyone not even bothering to apologize for his interruption. But sadly, things didn't stay all happy.
He chuckles and smiles. "I will. You both get back safe. Text me when you get home. I'll text you when I'm leaving." He says before walking out of the building.
"Thank you thank you thank you," he replied smiling brightly as he hugged him.
What didn't help is the fact there was a storm coming in- and it wasn't Thor's magic causing it.
Steve smiles brightly and holds him close. "I'm glad it is, bud."
The other sighed as he started pulling out of the parking lot after buckling up himself. “Go ahead and buckle him with you,” he nodded as he did as told and continued what he was doing while leaving soft kisses on the toddler’s face.
Peter nodded and looked at Steve.
Tony laughed softly as he pulls up a picture of Steve in his suit. “He’s the red, white, and blue with the shield remember? He’s been famous way before me though,” He joked, they never talked about the past though.
Tony jumped a little, peeking up before he sped walked away.
Morgan smiled at him. "I love you 3000,"
Steve looks down and away for a moment. "We used to be close... Now, I'm pretty sure he hates me..." He says softly and sighs sadly.
Steve ended up walking in, looking exhausted and beaten up as he shrugged his coat off his shoulders, placing it neatly on the coat rack, making a mental note to wash it later before he'd leave for his next mission taking a deep breath almost jumping at the sound of little pitter-patter of little feet, smiling he turned as little Peter was dashing straight towards him who probably was running towards him after the AI notified that he was in the driveway.
--------------------------------------------------------
"Well, we'd have to wait for Papa now don't we? We can't leave him out, he must be really hungry,"
Steve stopped talking for a moment but before Tony could leave he said something else. "You know what would've made me sign the accords?" He asks, then pauses. "You and my son. If I would've known that if I didn't sign, I wouldn't see my son grow up with my loving husband by my side. You clearly had that idea- That if I didn't sign you would take him and not tell him about me... Not let me see him..." He says softly and walks away toward Peter's room and gently knocks on his door, hoping he'd be able to see his son.
"He was born a little early for my liking- i believe he was almost 6 pounds,"
"L-lets start us over hm?" He looked at him
"And?" he asked with a small sigh.
"It's been 23 days since Thanos came to Earth," Rhodey cut off Natasha for a second before she continued.
After about 5 minutes, Tony finally got up and kneeled down to his height, continuing his stern tone. "Do you know why I put you in timeout?" He seemed to be ignoring him, still facing the wall hadn't moved in a while, so he raised his voice a little. "Peter Benjamin Stark-Rogers, I asked you a question. Do I need to add another 5 minutes?"
He watched Bruce stand up after a moment, shaking his head as a scoff escaped his lips while heading towards the door but not without Monica getting her last word,
"Try to keep up Point Break," Tony laughed as he thrust into the air. "See you guys in a bit then,"
"Y-you promise?"
"Coming to terms with my failings, not making new ones!"
"Uh... Kamala,"
"Maybe I could help, I'm pretty good with technology I've worked with tanks ad stuff since you retired," Steve moved his hand down over to Tony's scarred up cheek from his final battle.
Steve makes a playful groan and then pouts cutely. "Babe, don't hide your feelings please."
"Hey, baby... It's me." He whispers and kisses his forehead again. "I've got you." He whispers. "We did it baby."
The alcohol stung as it touched his opened skin- but he didn’t react though, just taking it. “I know, I’m sorry… I don’t mean to be gone so much,” That was all he could say as he looked away. “So we’re going to McDonald’s then?”
"Really," He asked in disbelief. "Tiny Dancer?"
"And I needed you," Tony interrupted him with a glare tilting his head at him. "As in past tense that trumps, what you need is too late honey," he cleared his throat. "Sorry,"
Steve chuckles and smiles. "His neck and back are going to hurt if we don't move him." He says as he gently picks his son up.
--------------
He slowly nodded again. "T-then you should go- m-my dads probably worried- if that’s okay-,"
"I-i met an old colleague of y-yours- his name is Steve- and well- he’s really cool and nice- who was he, Dad? W-why have i never heard of him?" He tilted his head.
Steve frowns and looks up at him. "Tony, it’s not like that, you know that. He's my best friend. He didn't do anything after Nat and I got him back."
"Does that mean papa can spend more time with us?" Peter asked, just now understanding with wide eyes.
But as it was slowly appearing... he noticed something familiar... things he'd only remember. He lowered his repulsors down as it was pushed out, its arms and legs spread, his face softening as the clouds cleared- it felt like time was frozen, the world paused around him. His eyes couldn't unfocus from what he saw.
Steve groaned at this, though he relaxed anyway. "We can work on it all when we get up,"
As he left, Steve sighed putting his face in his hands as he sunk to his knees, with a frown, feeling a hand on his shoulder. “I really screwed up didn’t I, Nat,”
"No sweat." He took a deep breath, turning towards the next destination. "Rescue the inhuman, no more regen formula, no more adaptoids- high fives all around,"
probably the shortest chapter but hey this fic in my google docs its almost 20,000 words, my longest fic yet which is surprising lol. hopefully by the end of this week this fic will be finished.
Steve didn't realize he was by Peter's room until he almost ran into Tony as he walked out, he had jumped slightly and moved backward slightly to not hit the man.
Steve chuckles and smiles softly. "Thwip." She laughs softly. "That's adorable." He then sighs. "I'm glad Nat was around. I know she's always loved, children. She's always been pretty good with them."
"Jeez fine Rogers," he rolled his eyes playfully. "What will you do if I don't though?"
He snapped out of his daze, smirking as he felt the submissive growing hard-on, pressing harder with his hips as he broke the kiss, raising his head a bit.
"C-capsicle?"
It started slowly at first, luckily they had JARVIS back up in their system. First things first, Tony had to steal supplies from AIM in an old broken down suit so he could upgrade his armor to be of use. He couldn't be Iron Man while using old scraps of old armor and prototypes from the mansion or what was in storage around the ship. Next was to get the Chimera back in the air, which involved stealing more from AIM, destroying an enlarged arc reactor stolen from his blueprints in storage, and looking for a new energy source that had the power levels of terrigen which was destroyed on A Day their next best bet was to search the drylands. While getting SHIELD back together and reconnecting with an old friend Hank Pym- once known as Ant-Man before AIM stripped him of the ability to be able to use his suit ever again- now he has a colony of Inhumans- called the resistance- hidden from sight, in exchange for some of their power source, they'd help hem out whenever they needed.
He nods and kisses his cheek. "Okay. I'll go get a shower and get ready for bed then." He whispers. "Hurry and you could join me." He teases playfully.
Tony pecked his lips back before just hugging the male close, head in his neck with a sigh, soon everyone came back with all stones and soon the construction of the new gauntlet began, soon it was all put together and ready to be used.
He tortured himself.
He thanked him as his suit dissolved in his arc reactor, deciding he needed air, and needed to be alone. Fuck why did he let peter fight alongside him? He took a breath as he decided to wait outside the operating room where his son was, sitting in a chair pulling out his phone turning it into a laptop trying to distract himself by working, muttering things to EDITH to cancel this and that he'd be in Wakanda at least for a while.
Steve decided he had enough of his beard, so he headed off to his bedroom's bathroom grabbing a new razor Nat bought for him and shaving cream, and just carefully begun shaving every hair till there was none left.
Tony took another deep breath before continuing, angrily gesturing toward the exit noticing Bruce had stopped walking. "So unless you have some kind of astounding proof, I suggest you both get off my land..," He had looked back at Kamala and raised an eyebrow. "What is that," His voice was out of breath like he ran a marathon, but it seemed like it came back as Kamala pulled out some small thumb drive.
"Who are you and what have you done with Steve Rogers?" he gasped half-heartedly and dramatically putting a hand over his heart. "Steve Rogers would never say such a thing!"
"No! Dunt wanna!" Peter said as he looked around with a gummy smile before he started heading to the ceiling fan not hearing his father call for the nice lady in the walls for the stepladder but he was too busy spinning around on a ceiling fan blade liking to tease his poor dad because he knew he wouldn't get as mad as easily as his pops.
"I'll send him a message okay? Maybe he'll take some time off for you," He spoke softly as he pulled out his Stark phone and sent a text to his husband before he stuffed his phone back in his pocket with a light sigh as he continued to eat his omelet.
Tony continued till they got to present day, the necklace that was on his neck that had the engagement rings that were the twos rings, were in peters hands he was fumbling with them reading the engravings in the inside as he listened to Tony, it was quiet as he took it all in.
Tony paused on that as he turned himself to face Steve, a breath caught in his throat in disbelief. But his gaze spotted Thor who was playing with his thumbs, staring off into space.
He sighs and looks down at his hands, now gently playing with his ring. "What are you saying, Tony? If I don't sign the accords, you don't want to be with me? That’s it?"
He gives him a soft smile but turns back to a frown as he looks back at the envelope. "M-mister Stark was going to adopt me from m-my aunt before I t-turned to dust-"
"Finally...," Steve sighed in relief as he saw their son finally relaxed with his eyes closed, Tony sighed in return and decided to keep him in his arms.
Steve paused, his eyes reading over the same file over and over- he couldn't believe his eyes- he caused that? Why didn't Tony tell him this? His eyes reverted to the date of when Tony was admitted at 2 months- wait...
He moves closer and gently takes his hands. "Tony... Do you really think I would've called you pathetic? All I've ever wanted in my adult life was to have a family with the man I love..." He says softly. "There's nothing I wouldn't do to have my family..." He sighs softly and smiles faintly. "I love you, Tony Stark. I always have and always will."
He sighed shakingly as he finally fell asleep for the first time in forever while Nebula- well she was off doing whatever leaving the human being.
He chuckles. "They fell in love. And they were able to have their little princess."
Tony paused again, closing his eyes a little, letting out a small grunt of pain, and opened them again. He had to finish this for Steve.
Steve frowns. "Tony. You're the only one that could possibly understand any of this and we shouldn't immediately shut our minds to it."
He wasn't in his playroom, he wasn't in his bedroom- god where could he be?! He was panicking as he was nowhere to be found. He cursed at himself for falling asleep in the lab as he knew Peter was like without Steve was around but without both parents? As he was panicking traveling throughout the house as he was calling out his name, he spotted his son through a window, who was currently climbing one of the biggest trees in their back yard, of course dashing through the back door going outside.
When The Resistance, Tony, SHIELD, and Bruce finally arrived as the sun raised over the horizon, much to their shock Monica was in handcuffs beaten up and beaten the arresting team was two good ol friends, Kamala beside the redhead, the blond beside her was approached by Maria Hill. Bruce stared in awe- it was like they hadn't even aged a bit. Shaking his head out of his thoughts he turned his attention to his priority.
She nodded. "Okay Papa," she giggled
He shook his head sniffling. "W-what Thanos has done can't be undone- l-lets not take about him now okay?"
Peter was giggling as he ran around the house without any clothes. He ended up climbing up the wall of the living room making his way up to the ceiling with his sticky webby hands and feet where he stayed on all fours out of Tony's reach, laughing as he watched his father struggle.
"Mister Stark?" a voice called out from behind him, it's Kamala's.
“Give me that eigenvalue. That, particle factoring, and a spectral decomp. That will take a second.”
He moved the video to the lab and watched that recording over and over again. He did this, Bruce was right... He caused A-Day, and now there was only himself to blame for the death of his to be husband.
Before he could make a fuss about being so close, Steve had pulled out only to bring him up on his knees against his chest, entering him once again and started rocking into him, hard. "You gonna cum for me doll?" Steve asked, mouthing at his neck, slinking a hand down around him, starting to stroke his own cock fast
"That's not ominous at all..." Tony muttered to himself, as he scanned the pod up and down.
"I have broken the encryption, so there is more to see," JARVIS responded as he pulled a holographic screen and the footage starts to play. The room was filled with a blue gas, the ship's walls were shaking, sparks flying around everywhere as the alarm and warnings of the reactor malfunctioning bounced off the wall.
Tony sets the suitcase down and sighed softly sitting on the table as they waited for the others. "What if this doesn’t work," he asked starting to have doubts.
“Will I be famous when I grow up? Will people know you’re my parents when I go to school? Am I going to school?” Peter had started to ramble, all of this seeming really confusing to the 4-year-old.
Tony looked up from his lap and little shocked to see Steve hadn't gone to bed yet. "Hey, there-,"
Tony sets morgan down and heads to the kitchen greeting pepper in the living room that was scattered with barbies, he went to set the table
Now he felt like he had no purpose anymore. He felt like he should've expected Steve to sacrifice himself for the world if it came to it but the fact his last words to him was 'see you later' and no communication to each other during the battle- he had to watch from afar the ship exploding- no notice. They couldn't even find his body to give him a proper funeral- Tony couldn't even be there due to the blame of the Avengers causing A-DAY. They failed, they failed New York, they failed the innocent people that died... most importantly, they failed themselves along with their leader.
'Oh god oH god-,' Tony cursed mentally as he panicked as Friday was grabbing a drone that Tony had created for these occasions that had a hand grabber to grab Peter from the ceiling or wall so Tony didn't have to call for one of his suits in the basement, that should probably scare the little one. Tony made sure Friday turned off the fan before he turned on the drone and made sure that Peter wouldn't just drop- he's done that a lot.
Tony joined them after a couple of seconds after letting Peter go off to greet his dad and well he's been gone the whole day so it's rude to not come to greet him.
Things might be able to go back to normal after they take down AIM tomorrow, for now, we see what the future has to bring and hope that nothing will ever break them apart again.
Steve kisses Morgan's head. "Why don't we let the adults talk, okay princess? Wanna watch your cartoons before lunch?"
Steve couldn't take it anymore and fast-walked over to Tony almost sprinting as he embraced him, tears already building up in his eyes, the brunette's arms wrapping around him as they just enjoyed the presence of each other, leaving the past behind them at that moment.
"There are no accidents though," Bruce responded, stuffing his hands into the pockets of his tan khakis.
Peter pulled back, looking up at him before looking down biting his lip harshly. “I-i don’t know who to even blame- be angry at- i-is that bad?”
Tony could see her smile through the reflection of the computer screen, it made his heart warm up as he tried to push the negative thoughts aside as memories from the past itched their way into his thoughts. He did his best to push it away, starting to type frustratedly, almost jumping in his seat when a chat message pulled up on the screen, making him raise an eyebrow in confusion.
“He’s a superhero Petes, remember?” he told him with a soft smile. “He keeps the monsters away,” he lightly chuckled as he pulled out his phone, looking for a picture to show him.
"I didn’t miss the show eh?" He joked with a laugh.
"Mhm, go ahead,"
He shook his head, putting his hand out. "Uh- Anthony Rogers sir,"
Tony thought for a minute on that, biting down on his lower lip looking down at Peter. "I mean.. It'd have to be separate from my workspace..,"
After he turned off the helmet he grabbed the blanket he had found on the ship laying down on the cold metal floor curled up. Fuck he just wanted to go home, be with the man he loved. Their last date was before Steve had to go off the grid because of their stupid government. He dazed off wondering if Steve looked any different from the last time he saw him if he still loved him if he'd come back to him. What if he finally realized Tony wasn't enough for him and decided to go back to his best friend?
"No no no We don’t say that word, what are you doing up?"
Steve quickly lifted his daughter into his arms and gently kisses her cheek. "Sorry I didn't text you. We talked about something that I think you want to hear about."
--------------------------------------------------------
He ignores the looks from everyone and he takes the elevator down to the secret bunker.
He pulled steve back smiling with every kiss. "Alright stinky boy, shower time, kisses after," he joked a little unwrapping his arms
"Proof," she replied with a slight shrug.
He did this for a while, listening to the younger fail to hold back his moans, he was moaning into Steve's neck holding onto his shoulders pressing his hips back onto Steves pelvis that was slowly speeding up but not too fast still wanting to take his time with him, putting his love fully into this, loving the way Tony would try to be quiet back then he'd let the whole tower know how much he was loving it, the next morning he'd say the hickeys were mosquito bites and when Steve walked in, Nat would always call him Daddy Mosquito.
Until it all stopped suddenly.
Steve instantly knows that's not a good idea. "Oh no no no... You sit like that. Don't move. You're hurt pretty badly, babe."
"What position would you feel more comfortable in doll hm?" He asked his eyes looking at him full of love as he pulled his hand away watching the brunette's cheeks flush.
Steve kisses her forehead and smiles. "I love you, baby girl." He says before handing her back over to Tony. He then kisses Tony once more. "and I love you, babe." He whispers and smiles.
He lightly smiled already fresh tears beginning to grow in his eyes, leaning up to peck his lips. "Y-you're really all i have left now- course minus pepper and Rhodey-bear,"
"That too," the toddler replied, though he didn't understand those big words.
Steve nods and smiles brightly as he gets out of the car. "Alright. Let's go in, then. I can't wait to see him."
“Did you know,” his voice was choked up.
“Yes”
He takes a deep breath, he wanted to shot and tell him the news, maybe it would make him change his mind- they could be a family- but the damage was done and just watched leave shaking his head as he grabs steve's ring stuffing both rings in his pocket, a hand on his slightly bump muttering softly. "Just you and me now peanut,"
He smiled as he watched him pick up his iron man figure and held it up towards him. "Ish Papa!" he said smiling, Tony cooed as Peter got out his little green army men and started playing, making small 'pew pew' noises as he flew the little iron man figure around, knocking them over, acting if these army men were the bad guys.
"Too hot?" Steve asked almost instantly after Tony entered. "I can turn it down for you,"
Tony decided to ask their son something he might come to regret later. “Hey, bug? Remember about me telling you about what I do? How about you join me tomorrow, make some cool things,”
Tony paused on that as he turned himself to face Steve, a breath caught in his throat in disbelief. But his gaze spotted Thor who was playing with his thumbs, staring off into space.
He sniffed again with a huge smile. "C-can i hug you?"  He asked in a light soft voice.
Pepper had him hooked to an IV with a sigh as she stepped out seeing Steve. "Don't beat yourself up on this, Rogers,"
"Who told you that? No, I didn't fight him," Tony shook his head slightly. "He wiped my face for the planet while the Bleeker Street Magician gave away the stone, that's what happened there's no fight, he's an evil-"
Instinctively, Tony set the ice cream aside -which ended up falling onto the table making a mess on the fast-food table- before pulling the terrified toddler onto his lap, starting to rub at his temples and slowly pull off the web that was being stubborn. “Hey hey, you’re okay bub- this will pass,” he spoke rocking the toddler from side to side hating the looks they were already getting. Of course, the toddler was terrified of what just happened as he clung onto his dad. He had no clue how to control his powers yet and was so afraid of them and he started to cry against his father’s shirt.
"I know whats will make daddy feel better," she giggled. "Juice pops!"
"They helped me get out of Jersey," the girl responded, anxiety already laced her voice. "I wouldn't be here if they hadn't warned me about AIM,"
Steve smiles and sits down on a couch and sighs softly.
"S-son... son of a bi...bitch...," Tony finally got out, his eyes widened as he stared at the screen, snapping out of it to continue his search, barely comprehending when Kamala started talking to him.
"Oh my god, Tony,"
"You had to have known before the accords. You had to. There's no way you couldn't have known. You lied to me, Tony! If you would’ve just told me then, I would've had more to think about! I already regret my decision but then put the fact that you were pregnant with our boy..." He pulls away. "I don't know how to describe the hate that I have for myself. I love you- I still do- I know you hate me... But at least let me get to see my son before I never see him again."
Steve smiles and looks down at his son. "What movie you wanna watch?"
After leaving New York from 2014 they arrived in the time after cap went into the ice. Tony was in a business suit while steve was in uniform. He walked beside him into the base.
Tony leaned up against the closet wall, arms wrapped around himself as he kept his gaze down, fuck should he speak first- he felt awkward, being in the same room as Steve especially in a small space, it felt weird.when he opened mouth nothing would come out and he just wanted to curl up even kore
"Okay..," Bruce nodded his head, pausing while putting a hand up, trying to calm things down. "I deserve-..,"
"Well I’m here now, had to put missy to bed again" he popped his neck and strolled into the bathroom with the blonde.
What felt like hours later, Tony was peacefully still getting his rest but he slowly came back to reality trying to block out this new bright light out of his face as he opened his eyes surprised to see this.. woman.. she was surrounded by fire and just floating there, he's definitely never seen her around either.
He felt her hand on his shoulder, rubbing it reassuringly. "He must've been pregnant during the accords then…,"
It wasn't long before Steve came as well, biting onto Tony's shoulder as he stilled against his ass, filling him up with his load. They didn't even want to move from their position when if it was tiring. Steves was pressing kisses where he left marks on his collarbone while Tony was just gently rubbing Steve's arms with his hands whispering soft "I love you's" until they went and cleaned up, taking a warm bubble bath together in their shared bathroom, just enjoying the other presences.
Tony with Pepper by his side fought with his suits and Rhodes too. He eventually reunited with Peter, he embraced him before sending him off. They tried to get the gauntlet to the van but it was destroyed. So Tony went for the discarded gauntlet after looking at Strange and he put up one finger. One in 14 million that they win. He dashed towards it fighting for it with Thanos, Carol got knocked out. Thanos put on the gauntlet "i am inevitable," he snapped, nothing. Tony had taken the stones as they attached to his armor hand, the powers running through his veins already burning him.
"Are you okay?" He asked softly with worried eyes, his heart ached when he saw how close Kamala looked she was about to cry as she bows her head down, taking a pause- her lip wobbling.
"Here take this, you find him and put that thing on- and you damn hide," he spoke before he collapsed on the spot, barely conscious to hear someone calling his name.
"You'll see by tonight," Steve winked at him with a soft smirk as he headed out of the room. "See you there!"
"Monica was right- the lab isn't on Earth,"
Tony just sighed ignoring his remark. "What do you want for breakfast? We have a full day ahead of us?" He said trying to cheer him up, hopefully getting rid of this bad mood.
Steve nods and smiles brightly. "If you want to see me again." He says softly. "I'll stay until your dad gets here if you want."
A week passed since their talk in the meeting room, Steve had escaped with the winter soldier and gathered up his own team, then the fight at the airport happened, even with his team of heroes against Steve’s, Steve and James escaped and Rhodey came out of the battle paralyzed from the waist down and they were sure he wouldn’t walk again. When Tony finally figured out everything, realizing it wasn’t James’s fault that King of Wakanda was killed, he decided he’d make this all right and thanks to Sam’s cooperation, he made his way to the old Hydra base where he thought nothing else could go wrong.
“Duh,” Tony laughed softly and made sure Peter was buckled up and did it himself.
Snapping back to reality as he looked back into his son’s room, lightly knocking to make his presence. “Peter?” he called softly wiping his eyes first before stepping in. Peter was in his bed silently, he was fiddling with the necklace Tony was wearing- he realized they were their engagement rings- it made his heart clench- he kept them.
"You think i don’t want to be with you?" He rolled his eyes. "I don’t want to be with someone who’s not on my side instead, i want to do the right thing but i mean whatever floats your boat, what makes you sleep at night,"
"B-But- i don't deserve your forgiveness-," he muttered
Peter clung onto his dad as he was picked up. "I want papa to be home more..," he spoke honestly.
"You're my little spider boy," he lightly teased, started to tickle his sides with a smirk on his face at the squeals coming from him.
[Tiny_Dancer: AIM is coming]
Tony had made lunch and went outside to find their little girl, walking to her little fort. He smiled kneeling down. "Munch time!" she popped out. "Handss uppp," he laughed softly as she had a little iron man costume. "Where did you find this?" "In da garage," "no more going in the garage missy," he took off the helmet and started walking to the home with her in his arms
He looks up at him and sniffles. "I did?" He asks softly and smiles faintly. "I... I'm just trying to catch up and be a good father since I was gone his whole life..."
"Hi...," Kamala awkwardly greeted the god.
"Uhmm...," The man paused as he thought about it. "Wasn't it something like Karma Kam?"
He walked over to his son, picking him up in his arms bouncing him on his way to the living room. "My little strong Captain America,"
He nods and looks to the side slightly. He still felt guilty for everything he did so he believed that he deserved a punch in the teeth.
Steve groans and grunts as he pushes the roof off of him and Tony and stands up slightly as he looked around. "Tony? Are you okay?"
Steve pulled back to rid of his and Tony's boxers, humming lightly as he held 3 fingers to the mouth of the other with a concerned look.
Tony pressed his reactor his suit appearing, grabbing caps shield for him as he walked over to him, with a light jokingly look. “You lose this again, I’m keeping it,” as he hands it over after pulling him up before going out from the rubble noticing their culprit was Thanos… past Thanos. The two with Thor along their side while everyone else was under the compound fought their hardest
But right now, in honor of HIM, he'd help save the world from his murderer.
"Where is he now? Where?" He asked almost demandingly
Tony smiled at the boy’s costume, cooing as he bent down to his level. “Did you design this yourself, Pete?” While Peter was talking to Tony, Steve had gone off to change. Peter nodded quickly. “Uh-huh! I’m Village Boy! See?” He said pointing to the big V on his chest that was just really just some pajamas with a piece of paper with a V taped on his chest. Completing his little outfit with a red cape and black mask on. “I made it myself!”
She had been overpowered, she had fainted as she tried to enlarge to fight off the guards. And now she was in the hands of AIM, in Monica's hands.
"Okay... so what if we turn the spare room in the basement into a sort of jungle-themed room with places to jump and hand and crawl- Then we can help him learn his powers easier,"
"Tony!" He says sternly as tears roll down his cheeks. "Look at me!" He holds back sobs. "Why didn't you tell me that I had a son?" he repeated
"Honestly at the exact second," Tony pointed a soft finger at the raccoon he's never met before or seen. " I thought you were a build a bear,"
Steve blushes deeply and looks over at the door. 'Okay, Steve. Just wait for 7 minutes...'
Steve holds onto Tony and gently rubs his back. "Hey... It's okay, it's okay Tony... Shhhh..." He whispers. "I forgive you."
He nods again with a sigh. "Yeah... I wish I could've done it differently.. pregnant or not- even before- I wish I would've done all this differently,"
He paused again. "So, fuel cells were cracked during the battle and we figured out a way to reverse the iron charge bought ourselves about 48 hours of flight time but uh... it's now dead in the water.. 1000 light-years from the nearest 7-11," He always tried to joke in situations like this but he knew Steve wasn't going to laugh.
"I said we'd lose, you said we'll do that together too," he pointed a finger at him. "And guess what Cap? We lost and you weren't there- but that's what we do right? Our best work after the fact what we're the Ah-vengers? We're the Ah-vengers? Not the Pre-Vengers? Right?"
Tony, of course, noticed the scratched and lightly sighed. “Hey Petes, can you go get changed for papa? We’ll go for McDonald’s in a few minutes okay?” Watching his son nod before dashing off upstairs to get changed.
He gently wraps an arm around Tony's shoulders and kisses his head gently. "Hey... We can't change that but I'm here now... The past is the past. We need to think about the future. Tell me about him when he was little. Tell me stories. Catch me up." He says softly. "It's the next best thing."
"Okay no no no," he ignored Rhodes telling him to sit down as he pointed towards Carol. "We need you, your new blood,"
"Well, you don't get the chance to meet the amazing constants," He hummed walking over to the bed and sat down. "Met one of them just now, the one who wrote about the sewer lizards, remember her?"
"I'm hoping in the shower, kind of dirty," Steve quietly spoke a little flustered as he looked over himself, half in his uniform.
"Gonna need a stronger table then..," he muttered lightly as he shut up immediately watching how Bruce's eyes went back to normal and slowly but quickly took a seat, rubbing unconsciously at his knuckles, ignoring Monica's comment on how things never changed.
"I should probably lie down for a minute... rest my eyes,"
"What’s there to talk about? Especially civilized huh? Tell me that,"
"Alright, Alright... alright, alright," Bruce cut in between the three. "Everyone just takes a deep breath," Small pause while everyone calmed down. "We planned on interrupting the AIM experience- showing the world what Tarleton was up to- these Adaptoids of his- they harvest their power through the torture of these Inhumans," he gestured with his head to the Inhumans that were passengers on their ship.
"I think you got punched enough years ago," he tried to wipe his tears with his thumbs. "I forgave James long ago... i forgave you ever since you came back in our son's life,- and proved yourself tonight i guess.."
“It's not much but it's something,”
Steve looked up when he felt a wave of energy pass through him. He looks over to Tony and runs over. "Tony!!" He yells but backs up slightly when Peter then runs in. "Mr. Stark!! Mr. Stark!!"
Peter frowned slightly at this, quietly eating his breakfast which was weird for him.
“I know.. I know- but now you’re here, you might as well take that time to know you’re son,”
"Well, he's pissed," everyone's attention turned to the rodent, Rocket, who was sitting next to Nebula. "He thinks he failed- which of course he did but there's a lot of that going around ain't there,"
Turning to his asleep husband, nudging him hoping to wake him up, softly speaking. "Doll, hey..., hey you...," he croaked. "You know where Peter went off to?"
"He was born the same year we broke up- T-Tony," he choked up a little. "O-Oh god what have I done Nat- 2016-,"
"Were you thinking about juicy pops?" She asked her pretty smile on her face.
“I don’t mind at all- I need to change though, still got the suit you know,” Steve let a soft laugh out before hopping off the counter once his husband finished- the two perked their heads up when they heard their little sons feet dashing back down the stairs, he came dashing into the kitchen, wearing one of his silly little makeshift superhero costumes- definitely not fit for McDonald’s. “Ready!” he shouted excitedly.
He nodded squeezing his hand. "Right..," he sniffed lightly not believing this actually worked.
The battle continued, they ignored when Tarleton started to mock Thor, calling him a false god, that he should have stayed where he was, he did what he was supposed to do. In response, Thor destroyed other of his DreadBots.
Steve gently takes a bite and smiles brightly at him. He sits in a chair next to Tony's bed and lifts Morgan into his lap.
"Mhm, she was amazing, i was kinda heartbroken when she left, but i had the others, especially the newbies,",
(See the end of the chapter for
4 more chapters left, those will be the longest ones yet including two smuts which I'll be trying to make my best ones yet. Cant believe when this is all done it'll be the longest thing I've ever written. hope yall enjoy all this.
"His room is next to yours, ill clean up around here," he gave a soft smile before starting to clean up
A motorbike appeared next to the car, he could make out a familiar metal arm with a star on his shoulder- no it couldn’t be. He watched as his shit of a dad crawled his way out of the crushed car- he didn’t care much for his dad that abusive piece of shit- karma caught up to him and he knew it. His mother called out for his father-
"Unfortunately I do,"
The star- now shown to be a woman known as Captain Marvel sent it down gently on the ground. After a minute the hatch opened to reveal none other than Tony Stark looking pale and on the brink of the death being supported up by the Blue robot as they slowly had to walk down, tony even tripped a few times but remained standing.
"I'm not following,"
"...Tony?" a hoarse Brooklyn voice filled his ears.
Steve chuckles and brings the glass up to his lips. "I'm doing a lot better than yesterday, that's for sure."
“I know his father-,” He sighed softly with a nod. “Actually, we were engaged years back- and based on the boy’s age… i might be- well I’m trying to figure out if I may be the other dad,”
Steve walks over and gently takes his hand tightly. "If we fail, we fail together. But I have a feeling... That we won't fail." He whispers and kisses his knuckles. "This will work because my genius husband said it would."
He mumbled a bunch of thank you’s and honestly exhausted and ended up falling asleep in his dad’s arms.
"So very big and strong!" He cooed as he started blowing raspberries onto his little neck as his son started squealing and laughing, squirming in his arm. They both paused at the sound of the door opening and closing, and Peter immediately squirming away from Tony dashing towards the missing parent with a gleeful shout as he jumped into the arms of his exhausted pops, who was covered in dirt and small scratches but he managed to pull off a tired smile for Peter who he pulled up in his arms after the boy dropped his items.
"Please know.., when I drift off and be like everything lately- I'm fine... I'm totally fine... I dream about you.. because it's always you..," before the recording shut off.
He smiled lightly and kissed the side of his head. "I know, we love you both too,"
"Sounds pretty big for an accident," Natasha remarked as they stood by the quinjet staring out at the bridge.
"Thought you vowed to never touch because they were too boring," Steve playfully rolled his eyes as Tony appeared next to him in their old room, carrying in his old metal shield which he graciously took from him.
The boy gave a little nod as he just messed with the tablecloth, moving around the wrinkles in it.
Steve sighed but he did as he was told and fast-walked towards the room and when he arrived, Natasha and Bruce were at the hologram table- there was Tony- not in person but a hologram of some sort.
Avengers Day was going well as far as everyone knew. It started with the Avengers on the stage- of course, Tony wasn't still there-, Captain America gave a speech making sure to thank all the writers of their fanfiction competition- even commenting on how they made themselves more impressive than they were- before going into their discovery of the energy source called Terrigen which was quite powerful stuff, it was going to be used to power up the helicarrier they called 'The Chimera', a large flying ship that would travel up to where planes flew that carried passengers.
“Nat.. do me a favor,” He pushed himself to stand. “Find out why he’s here and freaking out- it’s not normal for him…,”
Steve smiles at his sleeping son then over at Tony. "This was fun." He says happily."
Tony pulls out his phone frowning when he hasn’t received any call or texts from peter- but Clint’s phone went off it was his wife- poor baby looked like he was gonna cry
"Holy crap, Thor?! Where the hell did you come from?!" Tony blinked as he turned his head towards the god of thunder before immediately going back to fighting.
Peter thought a bit more, biting his lip. “So... where did I get my powers from?”
He slid onto his lap, legs on each side as he cupped his cheeks. "Hey look at me..,"
He sniffled nuzzling his cheek muttering apologies and thank yous.
"C-can i be alone for a little?" He asked his dad, tony just nodded before leaving the room
"Mm all from birth to present," he snuggled up to him sipping on his scotch, of course, the first video was him in the hospital with newborn peter, pepper was by his side of course
--------------------------------------------------------
He looked up at him tears still in his eyes. "D-do you think he still wants me?" He croaked.
"What?" the man replied in shock.
"W-we really did?" Tony looked at him in the eyes weakly smiles. Most of the heroes had gathered around already
Tony nodded with a hum as Steve sat on the bed, criss-cross watching the male crawl into his lap, legs wrapped around his strong waist. Steve brought him into another passionate kiss his free hand cupping his cheek, his other trailing down to his ass, circling one finger on his rim before sliding it in, pumping it slowly letting him get used to the burn before adding in a second doing the same before he started scissoring his fingers, picking up his speed slowly, he was always this caring years back and it never changed.
Steve pulled away, removing his fingers and his hand away. "Are you saying you want me to fuck you already?" he asked licking his lips with a smirk.
Steve chuckles and nods as a couple of tears fall down his cheeks. "Yeah... It has been..."
Tony made small conversation as his dad talked about how his wife was pregnant and names. He was hating every second he just wanted to snap.
She yawned a little laying back down. "Ish that it?" She asked rubbing her eyes
------------------------------------------------------
There was a long pause, Bruce started slowly shaking his head with a scoff, looking at him. "This was a mistake," Pushing his hand at him in dismissal as he turned away to head back to his van.
Steve pouts back. "Please? For me?" He asks softly.
"See if not for these, you wouldn’t be in here," he sat on the table. "I’m trying to do what you call it- that’s an old french so we call it," he kind of started chewing on his fingernails.
"And that's, why we need, need to make it a "quick" shower 'captain'," he gave him a look, poking his chest with his finger, laughing softly at Steve's eye roll letting him hop into the shower first- after he checked the shower temperature, gesturing for his husband to join in. As the water hit Steve's skin, dirt seemed as if it melted off his skin going down into the drain. When Tony stepped into the shower, he immediately flinched at the hotness, cursing under his breath.
He snuggled up to Steve finishing his glass and gave up on pouring another and just sipped from the bottle. The next videos were just birthdays or accomplishments Peters made over the years when he enrolled in school, especially when he had to take music and art
Tony plopped down on a couch, he knew they were gonna take it alow so he didn't pull steve back with him and lightly smiled at him.
Steve groaned lightly against his neck, creating one last hickey before pulling back. "Guess we will go old fashioned,"
[Hubs}
Steve smiles softly and holds Tony close to him. "I love you, Tony... I will always love you even if you don't  want me..."
Alone, is all he felt.
"No- no- there's...," he paused slightly as he tried to get it together, starting to type away on his laptop. "...there's more here,"
Peter was drugged heavily on anesthesia so he was still asleep, the surgeon stepped in seeing Steve and softly nodded. "He'll wake up soon, I’ll let Mr.Stark know sometime after," he knew the relationship of the two, and since it was the first time seeing his son so he wanted him to have a few words at least
"Hmm...," Tony rolled his eyes, sipping his coffee as he turned around to face the two, spreading his arms out in frustration. "It was," He gave a sarcastic smile before connecting his fist to Banner's cheek knocking his glasses off, god that felt amazing.
“Do you know the patient?” the aid snapped Steve out of his thoughts
"Tiny Dancer hm Nat?" he lightly chuckled and looked over at the blonde. "What was yours? Legolas I'm guessing Barton?"
He sighed shakingly as he finally fell asleep for the first time in forever while Nebula- well she was off doing whatever leaving the human being.
His eyes widen as he blinked- his hand slapped over his mouth as he leaned back in his chair. "Shit-," he said out loud.
He hummed kissing the man back pulling back a little with a soft laugh. "Well, your husband is a mighty genius and may or may not have figured out your so-called time heist,"
Steve smiles. "Language." He teases and kisses his forehead. "You're in the hospital."
"Ah, the prodigal son returns," Tony was the first one to speak.
"I'm surprised you do..," Tony blushed with a soft smile.
Steve decided he had enough of his beard, so he headed off to his bedroom's bathroom grabbing a new razor Nat bought for him and shaving cream and just carefully begun shaving every hair till there was none left.
"Nooo i want papa to tell me it," she giggled at the nickname
"Scour the earth, you will not find our lab,"
Since Peter woke up, Tony hadn’t left his side at all, afraid if he left for anything Peter would slip into a coma or something could go wrong. So here he was with Peter's first physical therapy after doing leg lifts and all, he was on crutches slowly but surely they were making their way around the ward before they’d go back to the room. They were making small talk about what Peter was doing in the school at the time especially what he was catching up on online. When they were walking Tony had looked up at that moment thinking they were about to turn a corner and when they did he spotted Steve and Natasha freezing up in his spot. Peter noticed and looked confused as he stopped as well, so his dad did know mister steve, he knew he could trust steve now. "D-dad can we talk about something-?"
----------------------------------
As the door panels finally opened, he had to squint his eyes at the sudden bright light coming from the inside- whatever was in there, it was kept frozen as puffs of cold air released around this shadowy figure was slowly being brought out. Looked as if they were chained up- he was right about they were trying to keep it in.
What he wasn't expecting was to see his son having a web stuck to his face as he came into the kitchen with a pout on his face. He chuckled bending down so he could remove it, the many instances this has happened, he knew how to easily remove it. "When Papa comes home we'll sort this out more, okay?"
"We didn't give up Tony," Bruce used angry arm gestures, trying to put his point across, getting angrier by the second. "At least I can admit that,"
Steve nodded with a soft sigh taking the folder from her and leaned against the counter, as he opened the folder pulling out its content one by one, carefully skimming through the boy’s information.
Is he just acting as if nothing happened almost 16 years ago? He flinched when he felt his strong hand placed on his shoulder, immediately harshly pushing it off as he pushed himself to his feet immediately scurrying off  If Steve hadn’t left him to die all those years maybe he would have taken him in with open arms, welcoming him back into his life. He muttered something under his breath hugging himself as he retreated to his room, he’d be back when his son was out of surgery, he didn’t even bother to listen to what Steve had to say. Quickly muttering lowly to EDITH to notify the surgeons to not let Rogers know about Peter knowing Natasha was probably with Steve that probably wouldn’t last.
"No no, I was just leaving," the other male responded as he stood up heading him to the door. "I know you need this time anyways," he wished him luck before leaving the room.
--------------------
Taking a deep breath trying to stop his shaky hands as he slipped into his bathroom, staring into the mirror as he applies his shaving cream and slowly raises his razor, and slowly started the process of making himself look presentable and not like a hobo. He just needed to take his baby steps.
"Yeah yeah but what's the fun of not making a late entrance?" Tony chuckled, crossing his arms over his chest.
"You.. remember me?"
Steve let out a small chuckle. “Are you sure you want me driving?” As Tony was grabbing the keys for that specific car and tossed them over after unlocking the car and replied. “Would you rather have me drive?”
He knew he couldn't say no cause he was reading his mind, god he missed this man. Without even giving him an answer he reconnected their lips, pressing their clothed bodies together, deepening the kiss, shivering at the touch of Steve's fingertips as he ran his hands under his pajama shirt. Becoming more desperate and needy, he pulled back only for a second to pull both of their shirts off, of course, he got stuck on his own, struggling to get out of it, having to tell Steve to shut up as he heard him laughing at his mistake.
By the time he got out there, his son was casually sitting in the tree, swinging his legs, he had to be at least 10 feet up in the air. "Hi, daddy!"
He kisses her forehead again. "Daddy is going to be okay." He thinks of a way to tell her that his arm got burned. "Daddy's arm got hurt really bad and the doctors had to cut his arm off to save daddy. Daddy will be okay though."
"He kind of has an idea of what he can do but then again he was having a brain freeze that usually he doesn't experience at all," Tony frowned pressing a kiss to the side of Peter's head, his fingers running through his mop of hair.
Steve looks around. "I don't know. Someone definitely attacked us though."
His eyes lit up as he plopped on the couch and ripped into it and gasped happily as he saw the frame setting it down to hug his pops again starting with his thank-yous with a smile. Tony was just watching with a soft smile- fuck he was guilty of keeping steve out of his life but seeing peter happier with his other dad it made his heartbeat
He froze from his work, he knew that voice well, well, and clear.
"Doesn't matter, he's here now!"
"No..,"
Tony smiled at him and his children. "What would i do without you guys?" He laughed softly.
There was a good minute silence before Tony leaned back in his chair.
Steve sits down next to Tony and gently grabs his hand. He didn't say anything and tried to stay with Tony without making him uncomfortable.
"Already hard for me doll hmm?"
"Steve, can you hear me? Get the hell out of there!" Nat desperately and sternly spoke into the comms, Quinjets were taking off, a blue mist was spreading all around the Chimera as families were desperately trying to get off the ship that was floating and looked like it could blow at any moment, some of the teenagers or adults were passing out on the ground as staff and other standbys had to drag them onto each quinjet.
"...Impressive," he spoke truthfully, lightly nodding his head.
"I'm here...," Tony croaked, leaning his head against his fingers, his eyes filling with tears.
Steve smiles softly as he watches Peter on the screen. He looks over at Tony and smiles. "He's so much like you. So smart and talented."
Steve kisses Tony's forehead and holds him close. "It's going to be okay, Tony." He whispers.
They let the silence take over, only the sounds of the engine's lowly humming are echoing throughout the Chimera. They made they wouldn't be bothered tonight, telling everyone they wanted the night for themselves, no questions asked.
After the movie ended peter fell asleep having a long day, popcorn eaten and sodas drank
I felt like years passed but really it was hours as they rushed to save the man after being notified there was still life left in him. Time passed as they all waited in the waiting room, anxiously, no news or updates no matter how many times they asked. Until finally the surgery light turned off and they wheeled him out now, one arm gone. The doctors informed the team that whatever he did to that arm damaged all nerves and cells that couldn't be saved and had to replace skin on his face and neck with skin grafts.
The toddler smiled excitedly being so high up as he began his order. “I want a happy meal! I want some chicken nuggets and some fries and some apples!” he said with a cute little smile.
Peter looked at Tony with big eyes. "Can I sleep with Daddy and Papa? I promise I'll be quiet and won't bother or squirm, pleaseee," He begged with a sad tone.
Steve looks over at him slightly, clearly, he has been crying for the last couple of hours. "I deserved what happened... But I still care about you..."
She smiles and yawns cutely. "I love you 3000." She says softly and closes her eyes as she yawns again.
“Hey... Tony are you okay?”
Peter woke up to many birthday greetings, he got his present from tony and the others and it felt nice, he knew his other dad and aunt Tasha would come later and he was excited bouncing on his heels.
"Maybe I am,"
Tony didn't pull back lightly playing with Steve's little hairs in the back. "I-i i just want to start a new- you know? Forget the past- forget all that happened- i think peter deserves both his dads in the same house, same room..,
Tony just layed there enjoying the touch of his husband, tears escaping his eyes though pulling him closer with his only arm
Steve nodded, he felt a few tears escape his eyes. "He was.. pregnant when i hurt him... I left him for dead..,"
Peter gasped at hearing this. "Pleasseeeeee, can I go lookies? I wanna see some robots!" speaking hyper and excitedly
"Peter get back here!"
Tony smiled as he kissed the top of his head, even pinkie promising his son before hugging him tightly, spoiling him with kisses.
"I know... I do as well bug... i do too," he softly sighed as he sat down on Peter's bed as he held him in his arms, running his hand through his hair, pressing a kiss to the side of his head.
"You'll need to enlighten me then," he teased, curving his lips into a smile.
The super soldier sighed before closing the door and sat in Rhodes seat next to Tony's bed, reaching forward taking one of his frail hands, lightly rubbing his knuckles taking a moment to just enjoy this moment, he didn't know if Tony was awake or not so he just spoke anyway hoping he'd hear this anyways.
The portals open and the army of everyone marches in. Steve readies himself and looks over at Tony. He then looks forward and yells. "Avengers! Assemble." He then runs with their team behind them.
There was a sudden loud bang over on the Golden Gate bridge, pieces of the bridge would fly everywhere along with the vehicles that were driving on top, immediately families were, screaming, running around the ship, while security guards were trying to rush its passengers on quinjets and onto the ground as the Avengers immediately set to figure out this was.
"No, but it's something even better that i think you'll like, now please just hurry your super-soldier ass over here now!"
"Honestly at the exact second," Tony pointed a soft finger at the raccoon he's never met before or seen. " I thought you were a build a bear,"
Tony smiled at him getting up to help Peter with the zipper on the back while adjusting the costume where it needed. "I think he'll enjoy this alot, you two could be twins," he teased his son earning a giggle coming from him as he went back int his closet grabbing his toy shield in one hand and the other hand was foam Mjolnir turning to his father with a bright smile on his face as he knocked the hammer on the plastic.
"True, true," he replied softly. "I can get started on it as soon as possible,"
Peter smiled at this before he rushed off to go play with his toys. The first thing he got was a nerf gun, coming back with it into the kitchen as he started shooting his dad with it making little "pew pew" noises as he usually did with most toys.
“Okay good. He isn’t ready for that talk just yet,” He replied, relaxing a bit.
His hate grew for Tarleton that he could punch his computer screen. His fists clenched up as he started trembling in his chair, he didn't even feel the hand on his shoulder. The only word that raced through his mind was why. Why did he smash the reactor? Why did Tarlton lock him in there? When he got his hands on Georgie Boy he was going to make him pay.
"Oh my god...,"
Suddenly, everything just began to shake. Was this an earthquake? Steve thought to himself, turning off the water and throwing down his towel as he threw on one of his long shirts and ran out of the room to find a window. What he saw almost made his heart skip a few beats. He spotted a ship being carried by a bright-looking star as it was making a landing in front of the compound. Steve along with the others ran outside to meet the newcomer, especially with the hope to see who inside the ship, I mean there must be a reason for her to bring this here.
"God I thought you-,"
Peter’s head had snapped up at his voice- his eyes were filled with confusion- his emotions were so all over the place he couldn’t handle it. Should he smile? Should he cry? Be angry with either of his dads? He ended up just starting to cry frustratedly, Steve immediately rushing over to his side- but he hesitated.
"Oxygen will run out by tomorrow morning and well... that'll be it," Tony eyes heavied a little. "And Steve I... I said no more surprises before you went off the grid... and I gotta say I was really hoping to pull off one last one.. but.. it looks like- well you know what it looks like,"
She sat up a little with a look of surprise. "What what?" She asked jumpily
Spotting him awake after peaking in the recovery room’s door frame, sighing softly at the conversation he had with Nat before he ran into Tony.
He pulled back after doing another raspberry before putting his son down in his lap with a smile. "Besides, I do bug work Bug, I work when you sleep if papa's out on a mission.
"I’m really fine, don’t worry about it,"
Tony was about to close to getting a heart attack. "That's lovely- but come down, daddy is trying not to die here!" he watched as his son laughed as he looked around before he climbed back up onto the branch and continued to climb up higher up the tree.
Soon the support group ended, Morgan clung onto her papa as the people started leaving, Tony was up giving his best to another gay dude who talked about his date with a new guy.
He chuckles and puts the sunglasses on and walks toward the underground bunker.
She patted his shoulder whispering her best wishes before walking off
Tony nodded in response as he stood up, bouncing Peter in his arms trying to soothe him. “Can you pack up the food? I’ll take Peter outside, get him to calm down-,”
Steve laughs softly and looks over to Tony and kisses his lips.
Steve groaned, gripping his waist tightly, grinding down just barely into that special place he knew well. "Gonna be a good boy and cum for me? Good ahead," and changed his thrusts to directly onto that making Tony cum instantly all over the other bigger hand, clenching down hard onto him tight.
"Okay," Rhodes grabbed onto him. "Tones you made your point, just sit down okay?"
"Because, you young man," He smiled a little, starting to tickle at Peter's sides. "Need to treat us equally and stop giving old dad a hard time," Listening to his giggles and watching him squirm was adorable, his pleas to stop and begging his dad to let him go play. He finally let him go after bringing him to the playroom they have set up for Peter and set him down, letting him go play. He watched as Peter crawled across the floor going to his toys. He could walk, he just preferred crawling most of the time.
Peter gave a tiny nod. "Why does Papa always work so much? Whys is he never here?" He asked his dad sadly. Once they first adopted him, he was always their number one priority and his pops was always home. Now it's like he has only one dad, it was like his dad lived somewhere else.
"Y-you remember our favorite one?"
“I-i wish i knew,” Peter whimpered in his shirt, letting out a few sniffles.
Steve nods. "She never told me she was with Peter but I think that's because she wanted you to be able to..."
He chuckles and smiles. "I think daddy needs to be here for that, don't you think, little one?"
It was still hooked up to many wires but still was in working order just as he last left it years ago, thank god AIM never looked for the Chimera since everyone taught it was a goner.
Morgan skipped over holding out the juice pop. Tony smiled wiping his tears as he takes it. "Thank you, princess," he kissed her forehead and opened it biting at it, and offered steve some.
He felt so lost, leaving reality as he relished at this moment, one hand cupping the man's cheek and the other on his waist stroking it softly with his thumb. He heard Tony gasp silently as Steve deepened the kiss, tilting his head to the side, unconsciously pressing his hips against his, lightly moving with the kiss.
He smiles and gently kisses her forehead. "What story do you wanna hear princess?"
After dinner, Natasha and Scott leave to go back to the base. Steve then takes a tired Morgan up to the bed and tucks her into bed. "Alright, princess. Time for bed." He whispers and lays her down on the bed.
He turned Tony onto his side as he leaned up positioning himself behind Tony, pushing himself back into Tony, grasping the youngers hips as his thrusts were much stronger and faster, Tony's moans were music to his ear. He felt his lips curl into a smile as Tony grabbed for Steve's hand using his other hand to start stroking himself bringing them both closer and closer to each other's orgasms.
"Really?" Peter perked up asking with big curious eyes. "What do you do?:
------------------
"Langs coming back was an accident Steve- and now you wanna pull a- what do you call it- time heist?" He looked at him sadly. "Why didn't i think of this before? Of course, because it’s laughable? Because it’s a pipe dream?"
He looks up at Tony with tears in his eyes and sniffles softly. "I deserve to be punched..." He whispers.
“Pete… can i hug you?”
Once he was finally pulled down, he sprawled wildly while crying in anger, balling his fists up, whining."Nooo!" His favorite thing to do was run away from his dad and hated it when he got caught.
For some reason, Peter was antsy about the trip- he never really left the house due to his powers not being controlled, his parents were terrified of them getting out of control and them not being able to do much.
Tony hadn’t noticed, his attention fully on his son as he bit his lip harshly as Peter started again with more questions but Tony cut him off saying. "I’ll explain back in your room okay?" Peter huffed but he agreed as the two walked back to the room. He settled Peter in before he pulled up a chair, sitting in it backward of course as he pulled out his phone. He was gonna come clean to his son- he knew he was gonna be angry but he couldn’t stand the guilt anymore. He first pulled up pictures of captain America and slowly started explaining who Steve was, how he became who he was before the Avengers were formed. Of course, he didn’t mention his past abuse with his dad and why he was so terrified of being around the super soldier in the beginning. He went into the team, how Steve would always make sure he would eat, sit in the corner of his lab as he drew before they started conversations up before Steve had the balls to ask the philanthropist on a date.
They told him he’d probably wake up soon so it would be best for him to be at his side with loved ones to reassure him I’d he wakes up in a bad reaction. With another nod in confirmation, he walked into Tony's room and holds his hand gently. That's when Morgan and Happy walk in with Peter following in behind as Morgan ran to her Papas’s arms.
"What's up with him?"
He smiles softly. "That wasn't because of me was it?"
5 years later they started over even though Tony kept his old engagement on a chain and never took it off, they got married the 4th year and adopted a little girl named Morgan and Tony bought them a lakeside home anyway from civilization. He still worked on his 'toys' sometimes but mostly took care of the little one, wanting to be better than his dad ever was. He was supportive when Steve started his support group on the people who lost loved ones, even came a couple of times. He joined tonight, holding their toddler Morgan, luckily she was a good girl.
She giggles. "Good night daddy!" She calls softly before falling asleep.
"Doll, there was something buried, deep beneath the bay... somehow linked to the reactor, working its way to the surface every minute,"
Steve snuck off during the next night, walking off towards the medical ward. Even if he was sleeping he wanted to at least sit there and be there for him. He knew to make this right he needed to be there for the brunette and make sure he never feels abandoned never again.
Steve knocked softly on the bedroom door the two shared, confused. He just came in after walking around the Avengers Day fair, searching for the rest of the team. He knew Bruce, Clint, and Nat were around, he was sent on the mission to find his lovely fiance while Nat was off to find the god who probably just arrived.
It had been a couple of weeks after the Thanos snap, it was quiet for the most part, people taking in the realization most of their loved ones are gone. That's what Captian America realized when he finally realized, a day after that horrid day, that his love, Tony Stark was nowhere to be found. After contacting Happy and getting no luck, he called on his last hope, Tonys CEO of Stark Industries and Happy's wife, Pepper Potts.
The fight lasted what seemed like forever- well it felt like that to Tony- his boosters were drained and destroyed, he knew he wasn’t going to win, he wasn’t gonna make it out alive it felt like, two super soldiers versus a failing iron man suit it was obvious who was gonna win when he ripped off Barnes metal arm- he few he messed up big time a minute later he was back against the concrete, his mask was torn off and all he saw was a flash of red, white, and blue smashed down deep into his chest plate, his arc reactor went dead. He heard the sound of steve collapsing near him before soon standing up but instead of grabbing the shield out of his chest he left it there and went to go to his bucky- he didn’t say anything as they left- he was left there cold, alone, hurting- everywhere especially his stomach-
"Come onnn, for me?"
"I'm here now Tony... I'm here," he muttered into his neck, rubbing his back. Letting the silence take over, no one wanting to break up the lover's reunion- well-
"Guessed your password on some Resistance blog," she replied as she fondled with one of Tony's makeshift repulsors.
"You make me wanna smack you in your perfect teeth-,"
Steve smiles and hugs him tightly. "That's up to your dad..." He says softly. "I want to stay if he says yes."
Steve was sitting in his chair in the circle, next to Tony who had Morgan in his lap. As people began speaking, he would give soft looks and smiles over to Tony, wanting to see if he was okay. As a young man stopped speaking, Steve responds. "And that's it. Those are the brave little baby steps we gotta take so we can try to find purpose again." He pauses for a moment. "I went into the ice in '45. Right after I met a girl. Woke up 70 years later... You gotta move on." He reaches out and gently grabs Tony's hand. "you will find purpose again. We just have to continue taking those tiny brave baby steps. It may seem small now but later, you'll look back and see how far those baby steps got you."
"Eager," he muttered with a smirk before sliding in his tongue, kneading his fingers into his ass cheeks earning Tony's gasps and moans, a hand reaching back pushing his head into him deeper, his head lolling to the side as it goes deeper, adding a finger in after a while.
“Could you go get us a table sweetheart?” he asked as he handed over their son.
"Have you all lost your senses?" was the first thing Thor asked angrily when they all regrouped in the front of the ship near the war table.
They needed all hands on deck when JARVIS was finally back online and took care of the rest of the enemies. It came to no ones surprise that Monica had escaped, they didn't need her anymore anyway, big robots had plopped themselves on the Chimera as it looked like they were drilling into it. What did come as a shock was when lightning and rain started to come down from the sky and a thud from the far end of the ship.
Steve looks at the date on his phone and smiles softly. It was his son's birthday and he had planned to go surprise him. Bruce offered to let him into the compound and Natasha was driving him there. He mentally thanked them as he started getting ready to see his son again. He's been sneakily seeing Peter after school certain days but hasn't seen him at the compound with Tony around.
"I will with aunt pepper!" Morgan nods as she dashes into the house giggles escaping her mouth. Pepper came over earlier to play with morgan.
He takes Morgan from Steve with a hum. "Mhm, don’t be too long though, I’ll start lunch better be back by then mister "
Lang nods and starts stuttering about everything he said before.
He let out a sigh as he grabbed his son carefully, making sure he was holding him tight before he landed back on the ground, pressing his reactor to make his suit disappear, and headed back inside with his now upset son. He was squirming around trying to get down.  "Nooo I wanna' go play in the tree more!" he continued his whining
Peter slowly nodded as he adjusted himself in the bed wincing at the pain in his ribs looking down at his lap. Why does Steve's name ring the bell? He’s heard it around the compound but he had so many questions now that we’re now unanswered. He looked back up at Steve and decided to just ask him only one since he knew his dad would be coming any minute.  "Y-You were an Avenger too?" He asked, still a little stuttery.
That’s when the truth came out.
"Cmom stop teasing me- give it to me Stevie please please,"
"Look- we really should go... now," she turned her attention back to Tony, her eyes presented with worry but her voice stern.
"I don't want anything- you're being a meanie head," the toddler huffed.
"You're the one blowing this out of proportion, Tony. C'mon, you don't have to be this upset, babe. Let's talk like civilized people. Calmly, collectively."
He got into the elevator ignoring the looks from a secretary
Steve gently kisses his forehead thinking this was it. "You can rest, baby." He whispers. "I'll take care of Morgan. It'll be okay. We'll be okay..." He whispers and grips his hand a little tightly. "I don't want you to go but... If you have to... You can go..." He whispers softly. "I love you so much, Tony..."
(See the end of the chapter for
Once both shirts were off, he reconnected their lips once more, rougher as they made out on the bedspread, jerking their crotches together smiling in satisfaction when he heard Steve moan in reply.
"Meet me in the Tech Lab and see for yourself kiddo," Tony chuckled lightly as he and Kamala walked up to the lab. "Every test I did before on it ended... badly- but with this new miniaturized accelerator, I have a shot," He walked up to the cautioned taped out panel and slowly pulled it out from the wall to reveal the dusty old white and gold suit.
[Message from Hubs]
Tony shrugged his shoulders. "Mostly mine," he muttered under his breath.
"Not until you apologize and say what you did wrong,"
_______________
"It would be a great place to hide proof of inhuman experiments right...?"
Tony huffed and just nodded. "Fine, just for you," the videos just continued up till peters 15 birthday and an award he got at school
Steve nods and slowly gets up, clearly something bothering him. He looks back and smiles sadly. "It... It was good to meet you, Peter." He says softly before walking out.
"Yeah I would," Peter replied, slouching down in the stool he was in. "You're mean, I don't like you," He was saying purely out of anger.
"Yeah look at it... Smart," he looked back at her gesturing with his head towards his screen. "See? They encrypted it to look like a corrupt file." he chuckled silently at her amazement, her eyes sparkled. "Need a few hours, I'll get all the rest."
Tony brought her in his arms. "Good job, I’m saved," he lightly laughed, holding her close as he stood up. "I wish you guys came to ask me something else, anything else. Honestly happy to see you guys-,"
Not even too long after Bruce left the room the alarms went off, JARVIS in the intercoms informed the team of the AIM forces heading towards the Chimera, and that put the team to fight mode, they were most likely here for Tarleton's sidekick anyways. They split up, Bruce, Clint, would go outside on the dropship to the quinjet while Tony and Kamala would protect the insides.
Steve nods and kisses Morgan's cheek and then pecks Tony's lips. "Mmm, I wouldn't miss it for the world." He smiles and turns back to Morgan. "Can I get a big hug before I leave?" He asks cutely to his little girl.
Tony looked up as he bit his lip harshly. "No- n-none of this is your fault steve,"
Until he could no longer breathe on his own.
“Yeah that’ll work, here- you take the keys and get in the car,” He handed over the keys as he started packing up the leftover food back in the back they were served in as Tony headed out to the car in the parking lot, getting in after unlocking it and continued to try to calm down, rocking him in the seat as he waited for his husband to get back. As Peter was slowly calming down after all that, Steve finally joined them in the car, tossing the leftovers into the passenger seat as he started the car. “Still not calm?’ he asked with a worried glance back at them.
A week later, Steve had convinced Natasha to let them stay for a little while longer. He wanted to be around his son a little longer. Even though he was never able to speak to Peter again, being able to see him around and make sure he was doing okay was comforting at the least. At this point, Steve was sitting outside of a room with Natasha, talking, and trying to make sense of a lot of the confusion.
The first one to greet him was Pepper immediately hugging him, carefully with a strain in her voice letting out a cry.
"If you don't mind dear," he responded with a light chuckle, looking up at him.
`"This is all because of Bucky isn’t it?" He crossed his arms. "Goddamn your ol pal bucky over your husband," he muttered as he got off the table
“And gave him a hard time with that,” Tony came in with a light chuckle, coming over to give his husband a soft peck on the check
With a sigh, Tony pulled out the first aid and set it on the counter, opening it and got some alcohol on a pad before slowly starting to clean his wound. “Peter had to ask me why you’re always working and why I’m at home- he misses you, Steve... Hell, i miss you- we both miss you when you’re not home,”
"That- looks awesome," Kamala said in astonishment.
"Fine fine, I'll add a little zoom scope,"
"Hey Mr. Rogers.., if you find this recording- most likely redhead is showing this to you if she gets this- Don't... Don't post this anywhere this is going to be a real tearjerker- I don't know if you're ever going to see these, I don't even know if you're still,"
"Last I checked," Monica rolled her eyes. "...A-Day was your mess-."
--------------------------------------------------------
He groaned as he came to be. "Fuck... where am i?" He muttered squinting his eyes at the bright light.
“Is he one of my toys? Is he famous like you daddy?” He asked, gasping, his little dinosaur toys long forgotten. “Are we all famous?”
Steve smiles at his husband as he sees him walking toward. He quickly nods and pulls out the serum. "Let's go home."
Silence spread around the war table, even the SHIELD staff and other Inhumans... you could hear a needle drop on the ground
Tony's mouth dropped open, god it felt so amazing after so long, clenching his fists up. "I-I mmm... I like being on my stomach- u-unless you prefer different,"
Steve smiles at the surgeon and nods. "Thank you..." He whispers before looking down at his son with tears in his eyes. All he could do was blame himself. If only he signed those damn accords he wouldn’t have missed the last 15 years of Peter's life... He would've been able to stop Peter from getting hurt... All he could imagine at this sight was Tony laying on the ground, bloodied and beaten from their previous fight over Bucky and those damn accords. He sniffles and holds himself together as he says something to his sleeping son. "Peter... I'm so sorry I wasn't there for you... I-I didn't even know about you but... I'm so sorry I wasn't there for you. I'm sorry I wasn't there for you or Dad... I wish I could do something to make up for it... I-I just want to be your dad... Your other dad... I'm so sorry Peter..."
“He asked about it- I couldn’t lie about what I did for living hun,”  He put his hands up in defense, he noticed his husbands glare but pushed it aside and glanced at his son, ruffling his son’s hair. “Calm down bub, you’re gonna get too tired,”
"You almost obliterated all of Manhattan!"
They weren't expecting this one bit, definitely not the events that happened after. Bruce had volunteered to question his ex-girlfriend no matter what- he seemed to be the only one who would talk to her while the rest of the team watched from a screen.
---------------------------------------------------------
Tony took the go lass gratefully and drank it up before setting it aside, slowly bringing himself to sit up ignoring the iv pain as he looked at steve in shock.
"We could all three work on it together, It could be a family job,"
Tony decides to just clean up not wanting to bother the moment.
"The story about you and daddy," she cuddled her unicorn stuffie looking at Steve
"Steve be quiet,"
"It's alright with me," Steve shrugged, not seeming to mind.
“Nooo,”
"Hey, you wanna see something cool?" Tony walked in holding a box in one hand the other was his coat. "Pulled it from dad’s archives," he opened the box, one of his dad’s prized pens. "50 råsunda lend-lease PO of these in 1941 provided support to the outlines when they needed it the most," he stuffed his hands in his pockets
Tony had woken up with a start from laying his head on his workbench, immediately checking the time- god how long was he out for? He wasn't planning to fall asleep down in the lab while he was working. He knew his husband was still out or he would be in their bedroom- maybe alone while he was taking care of his son or they'd be cuddling as their son comes to wake them up giddy. While his AI was reading the time as he was wiping the drool off his chin, he realized his son has been unsupervised for the past few hours. He immediately rushed out of his lab after locking it, looking for Peter.
Morgan giggled as Tony let her take a bit as well before turning to Peter gesturing him to come over. Tony took the papers with his good hand laying them on his lap. Using his one hand he signed the papers, struggling a little since it was his left but he did it with a light shake in his hand.
He grunted from the impact, keeping his eyes away as he tried pushing Steve off of him. "Get off me, Rogers," he grumbled ignoring his question refusing to look at his eyes
"Here, Capsicle!" He heard from the other side. His lips curled into a soft smile as he turned the doorknob, opening the door to find Tony dressed up in his Iconic Armor everyone knew well and loved. The reds and golds of his armor shined in the day's sunlight as his arc reactor in his chest shined brightly. Tony turned around from the mirror, flipping the faceplate of his armor up to show his face.
"You disobeyed me and back talked while giving me an attitude,"
Tony listened before stopping Lang. "Quantum fluctuation messes with the plank scale which then triggers the doy position do we agree on that?" He was pouring them drinks and handing them out. "In lamer terms, it means you’re not coming home,"
Peter nodded slowly it felt better to hear both sides, now he kind of started to panic realizing that steve didn’t live in the compound and his dad was gonna make him go back to the compound and immediately hugged him hiding his face. "D-don’t want you to go- i don’t want you to disappear-,
Steve picks Morgan up and kisses her temple. "Hey princess."
"You rea- oh fuck," he moaned softly, wrapping an arm around his neck, tilting his head. "Fuck babe-there- lubes probably e-expired o-or destroyed."
"Alright..," Steve sighed surveying the scene. "Hun, you and Thor go check it out,"
He must be dreaming- everyone watched that Chimera go down, everyone knew he was there- he couldn't have survived. Maybe this was an inhuman taking the form of him- this had to be a joke- Tarleton playing with his mind.
The assassin nodded. "You're here to help out in the hospital, don't forget that you can probably pull something from the surgeons and nurses," before heading off, probably towards the files storage.
"No...," Tony shook his head, his voice barely above a whisper now. "No, we failed HIM," he said pointing a finger towards the other male, his voice cracking, tears already threatening to fall out.
"Shut up," Clint huffed before patting him on the shoulder. "Looking good man,"
It took him all his might to not punch him in his perfect teeth. He took a deep breath before turning to face the man he loved for so long, he looked down before looking him in the eye.
"What if Peter wants to join?" Steve asked curiously. "You know how needy he is," he hummed as he stripped off his belt and pants after turning on the shower to warm up.
"That's me! I big and strong like papa!" Peter said as he held up his arms, flexing his small muscles.
Tony took a deep breath trying not to let out his frustrations. "Peter," He said his name with a stern voice. "Go to the timeout corner,"
It ended up being Bruce.
Once Peter left, Steve sighed. “I swear if you’re about to blow this up as if I got cut in half- I’m not going to McDonald’s,” he said though mainly joking.
"Last we talked, I called him because he never showed up for lunch and... Steve, he's somewhere in space.. there's no way in getting a hold of him I've tried to, believe me, I don't know if he's alive or... dead..,"
“In my opinion? Yeah, you did,”
"Screw this," Tony muttered as he took flight, towards the Chimera at full speed followed by his teammate Thor, but before they could reach it in time, a shockwave goes out as the Chimera explodes and sinks into the Bay below, the blast pushing the two Avengers back.
He sighed softly as he headed towards the door, automatically opening it, time to find this lab before getting out of here. Wandering through the first hall, he immediately spotted a terminal that could give him the answers he needed. Walking up and typing on the keyboard, 'Tarleton G 001 REGENERATIVE FORMULA'
He shivers wishing the best of luck to Hiwars before rushing to their meeting point with the case. "Let’s get out of here," he said quickly
Steve was surprised, to say the least, but he found himself releasing a slight hum, snaking his arms around the brunette's waist, feeling legs wrap around his waist, adjusting his waist so he was laying on top, using his forearms to not put all of his weight on him.
Monica already seemed hostile from the start as Bruce walked towards her with shy- maybe he wasn't prepared to face her after not talking since the hearings. Tony immediately recognized the veins showing up in Banner's skin, as Monica tried to defend her tests. Imprisonment and torture was how they were planning to make the world a better place by removing Inhumans. That's all AIM saw them as, people who were evil, people who were sick, they were her test subjects to her experiments.
"Ohh, long five years,"
Tony smiled with a soft nod. "Sure id think that'd be fun, should i make popcorn and grab sodas?"
"Hey, Champ was your day with Dad?" He asked, trying to hide his exhaustion.
He blushed to bite his lip. "I think he got the talent from you- especially your  immediately apologize for anything,"
“No no- I’m fine with driving, I just know you love your cars.” He said, getting in.
"He had to have a reason...,"
"No- please don't blame yourself-," she walked up to him, a tablet in her hands. "The only thing we can do now is proving to AIM that we aren't going to back down- Tarleton wants us to fight with each other and prove to the world that we are the same people from 5 years ago," she frowned as she showed him the tablet screen, the interrogation.
Steve looks down at his son and hugs him again, holding him close. "I don't want to disappear again... But that's up to your dad..." He whispers.
--------------------------------------------------
Steve chuckles nervously and looks down slightly. 'Did he mean that or is he joking?' he thinks to himself
Morgan nods with a bright smile as she leans into her daddy. "I couldn’ts sleep." She says cutely and smiles brightly up to her daddy.
As the party ends, Steve frowns, wondering if Tony wanted him to leave. He sat on the couch and was now wondering if he should go tell Peter bye.
Steve, when will you be home?
Steve gently kisses Tony's hand and smiles softly. "Tony, this worked." He whispers. "We'll hear from Peter in a little while,” Before anyone could speak another word, a loud boom as the compound exploded and crumbled into the underground, Steve covers Tony and quickly pulls him under him as the compound crumbles over on top of them.
"Where's the lube?" the blonde muttered pulling back to starts nipping at Tony's tan skin, running his hands up and down his body.
"SS-Steve... i y-yeah.. i-i- trust you... i-i do mostly," Tony broke the silence, his voice still a little hoarse, his other hand lightly touching the man's hand, eyes softly closing taking in a breath slowly, his knuckles tensing slightly, Steve always watched every single move he took in case he starts up a panic attack. There was a silent pause before Tony initiated another passionate lust-filled kiss, that lasted what felt like forever.
"I promise we'll go down sometime tomorrow okay? Papas coming home soon and it's been a long day for both of us okay? It's also a bit mess down there right now okay?"
Steve leans in to the hands of his lover. "I have you now... I just want to think of that, right now." He whispers.
“We’ll talk about this later, okay?” He tried his best to calm the situation, he wasn’t ready for this conversation just yet and neither was his husband.
“There you go. Are you thinking about lunch? I can give you a handful of crickets on a bed of lettuce.”
Peter thought for a moment as he looked away as he asked again. “Am I famous? Do people know about me?” He asked before he looked up to his dad.
"Hey, Jarvis? Soundproof the room for us will, ya?" After getting an affirmative from the AI he looked back at Tony. "They won't be bothering us tonight remember? We can push Tarleton and Monica out of our minds for just one night and worry about us,"
"It's been 5 years.
Born In: Wakanda Hospital
"I'm here now Tony... I'm here," he muttered into his neck, rubbing his back. Letting the silence take over, no one wanting to break up the lover's reunion- well-
He caught up and gently pushed Tony into a wall. "Why didn’t you tell me I had a son?" He asks as his voice breaks and he looks like he's going to start crying.
Tony groaned, immediately shutting off the TV hung on his RV wall. God how much A Day has haunted him and he ran away from his problems like the only way he knew how. When the Avengers broke up, he left across the country to Utah, no one knew where he was and he was going to keep it that way. Sighing at the night sky and his belly rumbling, deciding on cooking up some of his frozen hotdogs in his fridge outside on his grill, was a little chilly but he just felt numb after all these years.
Slowly approaching it with caution until he was right in front of it, shakingly raising a hand to touch his cheek. "J-J?" he croaked, his eyes watery. "S-scan the life form for any identification..,"
Steve stayed by Tony's side, looking around at the city around them.
He picked her up and grabbed a juicy pop from the fridge and brought her back to bed as he made them take turns eating it.
He sighed, closing his eyes, taking his deep breaths as best he could.
Tony sat on the other side of peter and took steves hand of course behind Peters's head as he starts the movie with a soft smile
Steve chuckles and takes the papers and signs them quickly. He smiles over at Peter. "C'mere Pete." Watching him wiped his eyes as he walked over to him, immediately Steve gently hugged the boy and kisses his forehead. "You're one of us now, bud. Don't cry okay?"
He sat down to eat after throwing away the web. "I don't know bug... papa... papa just works alot nowadays,"
"Nope! Cake later,"  they got all the names in the hats, and peter knew where the two names he needed. He just wanted his parents to kiss and make up, so he wouldn't be sneaking out to see his other dad. He pulled out the first piece of paper and smirked evilly teeheeeteeegeeegegegeheyhe. "Popssss anndndbdbdddd," and he pulled out the other paper. "Daddd!" He got up grabbing both their arms before shoving them in a closet. "7 minutes now!"
Tony let out a slight laugh, resting fingers on his forehead. "I saw this coming a few years back I had a vision, I didn't want to believe it but it was a dream,"
He knew he couldn't say no to that face so he smiled at him. "Alright alright, as long as it's okay with papa," So Peter turned his attention to Steve giving him puppy eyes as well with a small pout.
Steve nods and sighs. "We will never know, Tony." He says softly. "This is our one chance to get them back. To get Peter back."
“And don't worry if it doesn't pan out. I'm just kinda - “
"Well, when ya know- thought you were dead," he lightly shrugged, wrapping his arms around him. "Tried to polish the things I had of you and cherish them,"
He shook his head. “No bud, that’s not bad,” he continued to keep his voice low. “You can be mad at me though,"
He sighs and sits there, waiting for Tony to wake up, it was a few hours,
Steve shakes his head. "No. It is exactly my fault. I should've signed those damn accords... None of this would've happened if I would have just signed the damn papers!"
Tony paused at this as he looked away with a groan, immediately he stood up walking away to the kitchen leaving Steve on the couch, he always hated this, hated how suddenly Steve would leave and he'd be alone with his problems and thoughts- his nightmares, god everything. He grabbed a flask of his favorite whiskey and some chips and made his way into the basement not even bothering to say goodbye to Steve, he didn't even bother to even attempt to sleep that night and deal with his nightmares all by himself. He immediately got to work on his latest project, a little surprise for Peter.
"If Tony allows me in to see him,"
Peter just stayed cuddling it felt nice. "How about a family movie tonight? You, me, dad,
"Peter Benjamin Stark-Rogers," he crossed his arms, speaking sternly. "Do not give me that attitude," in return the toddler scrunched up his nose and stuck his tongue out at him, he was getting to his limit. "If you do not stop with this attitude, you're going to the time out corner, you wouldn't act this way if your pops were here,"
Steve turned his attention towards him, a smile curling at his lips, immediately bringing Tony in for a hug with Peter still in his arms for a few seconds before pulling away. "Guess who's off work from now on until the next big mission?" he spoke happily watching Tony's face grew a big smile before he was brought into a tight hug hearing the philanthropist mumble a sarcastic 'finally' making him lightly chuckle, pressing a kiss to the top of his head.
"And you say I'm the sappy one here," The blonde lightly laughed as he set his shield down against the wall, pulling him close to his chest as he let his body guide him backward let his body hit the bed with Tony on top of him, ignoring the whine he got in return.
"Why are you showing me this?" Tony raised an eyebrow sipped his bottle. "There's nothing in there, Monica just rambled off bullshit I get it,"
"Mm... I'm fine but you capsicle need to go to bed as well," Tony gave him that same look and tone, knowing how exhausting that kind of missions can take a toll on you.
The boy had to think about this one for a bit- but reluctantly took off his mask with a little ‘fine’ past his lips, just in time for Steve to come downstairs in more comfy clothing asking the two “We ready then?”
Steve nods. "I know bud... Me too." He sighs and smiles softly. "Let's talk to Dad together, okay?" He whispers and gently brushes his hair away from his face. "Maybe we can talk him into something."
---------
Steve woke up a few hours later, rubbing at his eyes with a yawn escaping his mouth awake. He sat up in the bed, blinking slowly for a second as he noticed Peter wasn't in the bed like he was hours ago.
Steve wipes away his tears and kisses his forehead. "We're your family, Pete. I promise we are here for you." He whispers and smiles softly.
Tony took a deep breath as he peered at the window before pushing himself up out of the chair turning to Bruce. "I would have gone with Rocket Man," he remarked before he walked to the middle of his RV, leaning down as he pulled up a latch hidden beneath the carpet. "Alright gotta get dressed then," he started down the stairs into the underground passage.
"I should have stayed in hiding," he croaked, taking a moment before turning around in his computer chair. "I should have listened to the others, now here we are, the world is doomed,"
Steve nodded gently, starting to scrub off filth on his body as Tony started cleaning himself as well. "I have a plan that I need to tell you about later, it involves Peter,"
Tony was perched on the couch arm sipping his coffee. "Yeah, you can use your old room,"
Peter is asking for you, he wants- no needs you here with us.
"Mm, that's true, a little spider suit... his birthday is coming up anyway... we just need to keep him away from the basement,"
Steve stayed by Peter's side and gently holds his hand and plays with his hair gently. "I've got you, Peter." He whispers and gently kisses his forehead.
"Shit?" Said a small voice behind him. He turned seeing his daughter snuck out of bed.
He continued on, using one hand to rub up against his thighs, the other slowly adding in fingers to stretch the man out, a couple of times pulling away to spit on his hole. After a while, he moved his hand that was on his thigh over to Tony's small hard cock, gently thumbing at the head spreading around his precum, not pulling away when Tony started to buck his hips at the touch. He was three fingers deep with his tongue, stroking him till he was shaking.
Nebula came over and moved Tony to one of the ships chairs so he was more comfortable, she felt so sorry for him, it didn't look comfortable on the floor either.
"We failed him," He choked up, his eyes full of pain as he immediately turned away shakily heading back to his grill as silence hung in the air brought back the memories of A Day. He flipped over some of the hot dogs as he brought his plastic cup to his mouth sipping on his luke-warm coffee.
