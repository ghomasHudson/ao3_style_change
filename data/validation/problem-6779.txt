” then Ulysses started smacking his cheek with his small hands in an effort to make Steve smile. Steve helplessly laughed at his son’s antics, taking the hand repeatedly smacking his face in his own and pressing a kiss on the baby’s palm.
“Your suit is destroyed,” Tony murmured softly to his lips, Steve couldn’t stop laying kisses to his sweet, sweet lips, “I worked so hard to get you to agree for a bespoke suit and now it’s ruined.”
Clint shuddered. “Ugh, better you than me. I swear to you she didn’t even break a sweat when she gave birth to Nate, and now she’s all wonky because she thinks you’re filling an emotional hole by having meaningless sex with strangers.”
Steve laid his forehead against his, eyes closed and solemn, as if he was committing Tony, Ulysses and Joe’s scent to his brain. As if sensing the gravity of the situation, the boys laid their heads on Steve’s shoulder, their nose tucked into Steve’s neck where his scent was strongest. Tony closed his eyes, reveling in the closeness and intimacy of his little family.
Avengers Tower lobby was different than a regular building’s lobby. For one, different works of art and installations were there. In Ellie’s opinion, it looked more like a gallery than a office building lobby. The place they were currently visiting was the public lobby where anyone could walk in and look around. There was another section of the tower where Stark Industries employees would enter to access the upper floors of the tower where the offices are located. Ellie heard that there was another entrance that only the Avengers have access to, and that the elevator in that area connected directly to the Penthouse where the heroes resided. Oh, what Ellie wouldn’t give to be able to find that secret entrance. She would go in full fangirl mode if she ever saw any of the Avengers in person. Or passed out. Yes, passing out seemed more likely.
“Just doing what needs to be done, Ma’am,” Peter chirped in cheerfully. This was why he did this. Helping people and making them feel safe was all the thanks he needed.
Steve’s answering smile was so soft, and beautiful, “I’m not the same person as I was before the ice either, Tony. I don’t expect you to be the same as Natasha was. There’s forty years of your own life journey that shaped you as the person that you are, and that’s okay. I’m looking forward to us getting to know each other again.”
The sound of DUM-E dropping a bunch of tools to the workshop floor, startled Tony out of his sleep. He blearily looked to the corner of the room where his disaster of a robot was beeping and whirring in remorse.
“Tony! Tony! Tony, please!” Steve pleaded to him, tears streamed down his face as he kneeled on the streets, debris and smoke and fire surrounding him from the fight that just occured, as he felt his heart being ripped out of his chest again. “Tony…please don’t leave me...” he whispered futilely.
Before going home, they spotted a photo booth and decided to take some pictures. It was a riot and a half trying to fit that many buff and muscled men into a photo booth. They managed with just fitting Steve, Thor, Sam and Ulysses’ heads inside the booth, the little ones like Peter and Aurora at the front so only their foreheads and eyes were part of the picture. Natasha and Joe sitting on the floor with Tony and Bruce, while Clint and Bucky stood at the back. It was ridiculous and out of this world, but as they posed for each shot, they were happy. And they would remember this moment forever.
When they placed him in Tony’s arms, Tony was unprepared by the onslaught of emotion washing over him. He knew he loved Steve, loved him with all his heart, all his being, but the love he felt for this little boy in his arms was beyond encompassing. Tony would die for him, give away his fortune, give up everything just to keep him safe, happy and fulfilled. The moment he saw those cloudy blue eyes, so much like Steve’s, gazed blearily at his own brown eyes, he knew that Ulysses belonged with him, and there’s nothing in the world he wouldn’t do for this little boy’s happiness. When he glanced up at Steve, he saw that same love reflected back in Steve’s eyes. His blue eyes was filled with unshed tears, and Tony noticed he was trembling a little bit.
“Indeed,” Thor sighed again, eyes trained religiously up at the gym’s ceiling. Tony shot Steve a beseeching look telling him to say something to Thor because Tony was emotionally stunted and all of his words of wisdom was exhausted from speaking to Thor. Steve cleared his throat awkwardly, “It’s probably for the best, right, Thor?”
“I’m starting to regret that,” he mumbled under his breath and poured a cup of the decaf. He snuck a look at Ulysses and felt that regret fade away. Anything and everything, that’s his motto when it came to his boy.
“Uh…” Peter was blanking out on an excuse, “Didn’t she? I thought she did. You know what, maybe it was the adrenaline, the urgency of the situation making everything seem more intense than it actually was-- you know what, now that you’re here I think it’s safe to say that your mom is in safe hands, right? So I’m gonna go, you guys have a good night and don’t forget to move the pepper spray to your new purse, Mrs. Wilde. I mean-- I don’t know your name! Or your last name! Oh my God, I’m outta here!” with that Peter shot a web upwards, the web picking him up immediately and he left the two confused and flabbergasted civilians.
“Loki just made it one, Tony. When he killed one of our own, he declared war on us. And rest assured, he’s not gonna get away with this.” Steve stated gravely. His deep baritone and the conviction in Steve’s voice sent waves of reassurance and comfort to Tony. It was weird and a bit twisted that hearing Steve promised certain death and punishment on someone, but it worked for him.
“Yes.” Steve reached into the bassinet, gently holding Ulysses in his arms. Tony’s breath hitched at the sight of his mate holding their son. There was something beautiful and gentle in the way Steve hold him. “Everyone, I’d like to introduce your new nephew Ulysses James Stark Rogers. Ulysses, these are your aunt and uncles.” then he gently positioned his arms so the gathered Avengers would be able to see Ulysses’ face for the first time. Tony heard a collective gasp from the group and smiled to himself. Yeah, Ulysses has captured their hearts and souls for the rest of his lives. Tony smirked sleepily, his work as a parent here was done.
“Please, call me Anthony,” Anthony whispered in his ears, his tone sultry, “after all as my savior, we can dispense with the formalities.”
“You punk,” he croaked out after a moment of silence, “I can’t believe you named your kid after a dirty book. What did Stark say about that?”
“Wha--” as Thor tried to open the door, he realized that Steve had locked him inside, shielding him from the fight. Not wasting any time, he ran back inside to fetch Tony, hoping that Tony’s presence would diffuse the situation. He found his other boss still at the center stage, listening to Barton’s music and hurriedly rushed to him.
So Joe went and Joe served. Then one warm spring day on one of his leave he met Sarah Murphy, a nursing student, and the rest, as they say, was history. They got married at Sarah’s church after Sarah finished school, and a year later their only son, Steven Grant Rogers, was born on Independence Day. Joe’s American Dream was almost complete.
“We’ll know soon enough, Tony.” Bruce tried to placate him, but his furrowed brow betrayed his conciliatory tone. He was just as anxious and worried as Tony was. “Nat and Clint didn’t specify what type of injury Steve sustained, but they’ll be here soon enough. The tracker estimates 15 minutes.”
” Peter murmured sleepily, only feeling slightly guilty for being grateful that his parents being busy and away helped him and his brothers keep such a bombshell of a secret from them.
Which was when the door to the cabin they were in slammed open without fanfare. Tony and Steve jolted in surprise at the intrusion, the moment ruined. Tony glared at the cockblockers standing on the doorway, Romanov and who he presumed was Agent Barton, looking serious as a heart attack and deadly as a venomous snake.
“Isn’t it?” Tony said again, and Steve just had to kiss that sly smile off his face and let Tony feel how happy and content he made Steve just by being with him and being by his side. Tony continued to make his dreams come true, and there was nothing in this world or the next would ever come between them.
Well, Tony is the best mechanic this side of Mississippi and the world. What, indeed, was the worst that could happen?
Or so Tony thought until that fateful day in May when he had the pleasure of being blown up by his own weapon.
“Where are you? Are you at a frat party? You said you have midterms!” Tony demanded, squinting at the scenery behind his son.
Thor and Jarvis finally arrived for the night with Sharon driving the two former prisoners back to the bar they worked in. As the night went on, more patrons arrive at the bar. The Wrecking Crew had finished their soundcheck and were now having drinks at the bar.
“Aw, honey, you say the sweetest things,” Tony’s tone might sound flippant and dismissive but Steve knew his inability to take a sincere compliment was making him sound that way. Inside, he was pretty sure Tony was preening.
Tony let out a sound that was a mix of laughter and a cheer. Another boy! They were having another boy! Steve looked floored, looking at Tony with glee and disbelief, “Tony, another boy…”
Natasha looked at him for a long time, then nodded at him imperceptibly. She then walked over to where the boys were sleeping and scooped up her godson and cuddled him close to her bosom. They fell asleep together like that.
“Bruce and Coulson found a bullet hole in my Belgian Corduroy coat,” Tony said in greeting, taking of his jacket and shoes as he entered the room.
Crap, really? Jamie actually wanted to confront him about what happened last night? This was bad. So bad. Uber bad. But when cornered, as Uncle Clint like to say, play dumb. “Uh, what-- what happened last night? Is your mom okay? Who saved her?”
I know someday you'll have a beautiful life. I know you'll be a star in somebody else's sky. But why can't it be mine?
In the public area, artists supported by the Maria Stark Foundation exhibited their works. The collection here reminded Ellie of the ones in MoMa, except with less post-modern art that she had no idea how to interpret or react to. She walked around the different painting displayed on the wall, until she came around to one painting that everyone seemed to be crowding around in.
“Here, have some sandwich. Tonight, we eat and tomorrow we can get out of this place and have “Thank God You’re still alive” sex.” Tony grinned cheekily as he handed Steve an unwrapped sandwich.
Tony, sensing his mate’s presence, turned around and spotted Steve stocking the bar with a frown on his face. Ah, he must have seen Killian talking to Tony and was now sulking. Tony smiled softly, walking to the bar hoping his proximity would calm his mate a little. “Hey, Killian. How you doing?” Steve said.
“That was golden. Look at Stevie’s eyes!” Bucky grinned, looking at the picture he took of Steve and Ulysses. He tilted his phone to the side for Tony to see. Bucky managed to capture the moment Ulysses planted one on Steve, lips puckering up cutely and Steve was wide eyed and surprised.
“Tony, you’re always the more logical one out of the two of you,” Natasha said with a small smile, “Don’t get me wrong, Steve is brilliant. But when it comes down to it, he uses his heart more than his head.”
Steve and Tony exchanged amused looks at Thor’s words, “Is this just an excuse to set something on fire, Thor?”
“Well…” Steven and Anthony looked at each other, neither really thought about when to actually cement their relationship. “How about now?” Steven directed his words to Anthony. The bright smile on his prince’s face told him all he needed to know about Anthony’s answers.
“Oh no, the video is wonderful. I love it.” Steve clarified, not wanting Tony to feel offended.  “It’s just that sometimes when I watched the video I feel like I’m being told about my life by someone else. But reading my journal...it feels like I’m telling myself the story.”
That was three months ago. They were doing better with each passing day, coexisting and cohabitating like they’ve done it all their lives. Steve thought this was as close to what he envisioned his life would turn out if both he and Natasha had survived the War: this easy coexistence with each other, filling each other’s empty spaces. Two humans broken in just right places for the other to fill.
“I said your balls make me nauseous, Steve. Ugh!” Tony rolled over on the bed, putting his back to Steve, “I can’t believe I’m getting cockblocked by this weird ass pregnancy hangup. The one good thing about being pregnant was supposed to be the increased libido!”
The past six months felt like a dream to Steve. Some days, he felt like he was still waking up from the ice and he still expect to hear that fake baseball game over the radio, feeling the dread and hopelessness of his whole situation. But then he would open his eyes and the first thing he would see would be Tony’s face, peaceful and slack in slumber or the abstract painting of the tower Steve had done months ago hanging across from the bed and Steve knew that everything was real. That he really did found his love again, seventy years later, reborn in this wonderful, amazing, smart, handsome and funny man that opened his heart and his home to an old shell-shocked soldier with more issues than Time. He and Tony had settled in their life together without much fanfare. It was as if all these years they’ve made a space for the other in their own lives for the other to occupy it when the time came. And occupy they did.
“You could learn to say no for once. Too bad you weren’t around for the 80s. There was an amazingly horrible campaign aimed at the youth to “just say no”. Not that it ever worked or did anything for the War on Drugs. God, Reagan was a disaster.”
“Because the guy comes up shady. But he has an alibi for the time of the murder. Twin hooker alibis.” Bucky started walking out of the break room, Steve at his side. “Now I’m gonna tell you something, punk, something not even Sharon knows yet. Coroners found fibers on the bullet track. Looks like something was used to muffle the gun.”
The man and his kids turned to him with a startled look on their faces, seeming to need a moment to grasp what Tony just said.
“Don’t be sorry. I like hearing you talk. It’s great to hear how passionate you are about educating the future generation. We need more people like you.” Steve beamed at him.
“Thank God for that. I think if it took any longer he might just run through the wall of medic wing and run all the way to the Tower.” Tony teased him, Steve rolled his eyes and bump their shoulders together.
“He’s beautiful, Steve.” Bruce said reverently. He reached out to touch Ulysses’ cheek, gratified when Ulysses reacted to the light touch.
No sooner had they sat down to enjoy breakfast than JARVIS rang the alarm signifying the presence of an intruder. As a unit, they immediately stood up in numerous fighting stances.
“Anybody touch it?” he asked. Jarvis angled his head at Bruce’s direction as the man in question timidly raised his hand.
“Hahaha, kids you know? So imaginative.” Tony tried to laugh it off with the crowd, but he felt like the expression on his face was closer to a grimace than a smile. Thank God nobody took Ulysses seriously or their covers might be blown. As it was nobody glanced twice at them as they just looked like an omega and his two children at the park even if the omega in question kinda looked like Tony Stark. But then again, Tony Stark wouldn’t be caught dead going outside in loose sweatpants and a Motorhead t-shirt, right?
Steve chuckled at the sight of his family. His heart bursting with love and affection for his mate and their children. He plucked Joe out of the playpen and settled the baby on his hips, pressing a kiss to his head. “You want to learn thermodynamics with Ulysses and Babbo too, sweetheart?”
In line behind her, Tony sighed longsufferingly. Peter fidgeted behind him, impatient because he had to pee and he didn’t listen to Tony telling him to go on the plane before they landed.
Just then the sun hit Steve in a way that made his blonde hair (the hair he got from Sarah) shone. His son wore the Saint Michael the Archangel pendant Sarah gave him at his confirmation. In this light, he looked so much like Sarah that Joe’s heart clenched in its cage and throbbed painfully.
They took their sandwiches and moved to the living room where Thor was still sitting on the couch, this time staring despondently at the television, Princess Peach still in the same position she was in when Steve first entered the kitchen.
“Everytime I asked them to reduce weapons production, they denied me. Told me to stay in line, do my duty as the Crown Prince of Aethiopia and keep making better weapons. But to what end? Is it really wise to build an economy based on war, on violence and bloodshed?” Anthony paused, “I may not have used the weapons myself and take up arms, but I’m just as guilty as them for providing a means for destruction, for being an instrument of war. I want to stop, to get away from it all. To tell you the truth, I was planning on running away but that...that event occured,” he said referencing the occasion that brought them together, “Rhodey arranged for his cousin to smuggle me out of the city to Athens. But before we could do it...well you know what happened. Being sacrificed to the sea monster seemed like a blessing in disguise. My plan was to kill it with that pocket knife, then disappear. This way I could have saved my country and free myself.”
“Masters Ulysses, Joe and Peter awake, Sir. Along with Agent Barton and Master Sergeant Wilson. Everyone is gathered in the kitchen.”
“You ready for more?” Steve asked, pulling his fingers out of Tony. He moved lower towards the bed, positioning Tony’s legs around his hips. Steve loved it when Tony cradled his body this way when they make love. Feeling Tony’s toned thighs wrapped around him as he make love to him amplified the pleasure for Steve.
“You? Heartless?” Steve looked over to his mate. Tony was attempting to affect a nonchalant look, trying to seem as if Sharon’s words didn’t bother him, “Come on, what you are is Iceland. Cool and collected on the outside, but underneath it all, you’re volcano.” Steve smirked.
named him after you,” Tony corrected, chicken feet demolished and now moving on to the salad, “if we named one of them godparent, they might let him go off and join a circus or worse yet, go to Harvard. Yuck.” Tony made a face.
“Oh my God, are you actually giving birth here? In the lobby? Little James, don’t look,” Barnes asked, horrified, placing his hand over Ulysses’ eyes to cover it.
Then he launched into a long winded explanation on his plans to ultimately make Hawai’i fossil fuel independent; how his company was working with the state government to invest more in solar panels and wind turbines and arc reactor technology (although he kinda glossed over that particular technology for a bit since that would totally give away his identity to Steve); how he wanted to set up a fellowship to incentivize more young Hawai’ians to study science and engineering and his recent endowment to UH to build a research institute for renewable energy and biomedical devices.
“Personally speaking, I ain’t ever gonna fall for someone that I just met in one day. But he did, Tony. And he fell every day you went to him. What does that tell you?”
“Yeah, we had to videocall him this morning to reassure him that everything’s fine. He still insisted on coming down this weekend, though.” Peter added.
“Hmm,” Tony stood up, “give me an estimate on speed, radius, and iterations needed to achieve break through the energy barrier.”
Steve surreptitiously tried to catch Tony’s eyes, asking silently with his glance if he missed anything when he was recovering. Tony shook his head, signaling to his mate that he’d tell him about the whole thing later.
Tony brightened up at the mention of his new car, “Well yeah. But I don’t think she’s ready for the road. I still need to replace the master cylinder, the clutch gear and the windows still don’t have automatic gears. I have to move it using manual cranks, for god’s sakes.”
“He doesn’t need me, Nat. Believe me, I’m the last thing he wants over there in the Upside Down when all I’m gonna do is trigger Barnes and undo all the deprogramming he went through.”
“We probably should stop bad mouthing them while we’re here, though. I don’t think your brother would take it too kindly.”
Peter meant rock, strong and sturdy, just like the marble carved to the likeness of him and his family.
“So who do you want to arrest?” Bucky asked Sharon, who was surveying the whole scene with disapproval evident on her face.
“Please make sure he at least ate something nutritious before the ice cream.” Tony called out to them, eliciting groans of “Okay, Babbo…”
Jamie was talking with his friend Aaron and other football players that have congregated around his locker, the football team captain’s locker. They were clearly joking with each other from the raucous laughter than Joe could hear from his spot in the hallway. Jamie had his back to him and Peter, and if Peter didn’t tell him that Jamie was looking at him a couple of minutes earlier, Joe wouldn’t have believed that the boy ever spared a thought for Joe in his mind.
A couple of hours later, Joe was lounging on the couch trying to throw cards at an upturned cap he placed a couple feet away from him. James was doing situps on the love seat next to him and counting the number of reps he’s done, when the back door slammed open, and the two men rushed to their default position of “watching” the football game. Joe turned the TV on and James pretended to read a magazine. Steve came into the house, his face and clothes splattered with paint. He was drinking water he retrieved from the refrigerator.
“It was Apollo. And his priestess told your father to sacrifice you to the sea monster to appease Poseidon.”
Tony, seeming to notice that he was still brandishing a used pregnancy test stick, immediately hid it behind his back. “No. It’s a-- a stick. Something new I’m working on.”
“Well, I told Phil that I knew a place where a couple could get some privacy. Which is what I also told Rumlow. Yeah. That was the point.” Clint finished his long and convoluted explanations.
“It means that Tony’s high blood pressure is negatively impacting the pregnancy, Steve. We have to monitor him very closely from now on.”
And at that moment, everything was perfect. Steve moved closer to Tony and placed his arms around Tony’s waist. Then he angled his face towards Tony’s and pressed their lips together in a soft kiss that soothes every inch of Tony’s wounded soul. Tony sighed, melting into the kiss and leaning his body against Steve. He felt Steve bend at the waist, dipping Tony and deepening the kiss they shared. At this moment, his life was finally complete. Here in Steve’s arms Tony could finally breathe.
They reached the steps of one of the temples located in the island and sat down on it side by side. The sun shone brightly over them and there was a gentle wind blowing through the island carrying the scents of hyacinth flowers from the flower fields. From their position on the island, they could see the sunlight creating a rainbow that surrounded the waterfall. Groot was happily sleeping beneath the shade of a giant tree, it was as close to heaven as one could get. Anthony laid back on the stairs, feeling the warmth of the sun in his face and enjoying Steven’s presence by his side.
“Yeah. So are we.” Tony said as he set about to make his decaf coffee and microwaving Ulysses’ banana puree breakfast. “A little scared, but excited too.”
Peter suspected it might have to do with the surreptitious glances Jamie have been throwing at Joe for the better part of their high school years, but he could be wrong.
“Except the real reason you didn’t hear anything was because the gunshot was muffled with something.” Steve elaborated. Just then, Tony’s phone rang, showing Nick calling him.
But that’s just it: it’s all an act. Now that Tony knew what to look for, Thor’s interactions with Jane felt stilted. There was no chemistry there, no underlying of affections between them. They seemed uneasy with each other, like two strangers who came together too fast and now that the spark was gone were unsure why they were together in the first place.
Clint came up to him next. The hugged and he heard Clint whispering something to him. “What was that, buddy?”
Steve winked at Tony and proceeded to complete suiting up. With the body armor on, he proceeded to stepped into the trousers. That done, he slid on the fingerless leather gloves he preferred for better handling of the shield. Steve was wearing the stealth suit, admittedly, his favorite version of the suits Tony made for him. It happened to be Tony’s favorite too. According to Tony, it brought out the blue in his eyes and made his hair shine even brighter than usual.
“He’s yours too, you know. He’s not just mine and Steve’s. He’s yours, and Bruce’s, and Thor’s, and Rhodey’s, and Sam’s. God forbid, he’s Clint’s too.” Tony told her, “It takes a village. And you better be damn sure that all of y’all are gonna be part of that village.”
“It’s not something we can control, buddy.” Steve finally told him, stroking Ulysses long brown hair, “we can ask for it, but at the end of the day it’s all up to chance whether we get you a baby boy or a baby girl.”
At least, Steve thought ruefully, he could still stand the sight of my face. He heard that when one of his neighbours back in the day was pregnant, the omega couldn’t stand the sight of her Alpha and he had to move back in with parents for the duration of the pregnancy. Which was all sorts of ridiculous.
There was a warm weight on his hand, holding his hand in their own, and Steve took comfort in its presence, tethering him to the real world so he wouldn’t slip back down under again. He couldn’t feel his limbs. Correction: he could feel some of his limbs. He could move his right hand, move them to squeeze the hand that was in his eliciting a gasp from the other person, but he couldn’t do the same with his left hand. What’s going on?
“Tony, could you please look at me?” Steve’s voice sound faint in Tony’s ears, reverent, though that seemed strange for Tony. Tentatively, Tony did as he was asked only to stare into tearful blue eyes filled with hope and longing. Tony stared back in bewilderment. This was...not what he expected. Steve cupped his face in his big, warm hands and Tony couldn’t help closing his eyes, revelling on the comfort and warmth that simple touch brought him, “How long have you known?” Steve asked again, voice breaking with overflowing emotions.
“Lighten up, Steve.” Tony told him. Steve was still uneasy even after Tony woke up a few hours ago. “Doc says I can go home tomorrow. They just want me to stay overnight for observations.”
Steve looked shocked, his mouth was hanging open agape like someone just socked him in the face. Then a smile lit up his face as he pulled Tony back in to his embrace ad just for good measure kissed the living daylights out of Tony.
“Wilson’s brother. Head of the gangbangers.” Thor answered. He cocked the hammer of his gun and pointed it at the man, “don’t move, or I’ll blow your head off.”
“Easier said than done.” he grumbled out. Steve knew he must be wearing what Tony dubbed as his “Constipated Face” on. But he couldn’t help being sullen. Everyone else seemed so ready to forget what happened not even three hours ago. Steve guessed it was easier for them. They didn’t see Tony’s eyes rolling to the back of his head and collapsing in Steve’s arms. They didn’t have to see what it would have looked like had Tony died.
When he and Steve stepped into the penthouse living room that morning on their way to the kitchen, the room was dark despite the fact it was morning. The eponymous soundtrack to “The Godfather” was playing from the sound system and Clint was sitting on one of the chairs, decked out in full Godfather garb, complete with the slicked back hair and fake moustache and a cat he got from God knew where on his lap. Steve looked wide eyed and confused at the whole thing, while Tony just rolled his eyes at the display. There was also a banner splayed on top of the family picture over the mantle proclaiming “Congratulations, Clint!”
“What!” Steve and Tony yelped. Tony leapt off the bed and ran out of the room, yelling out, “That son of a bitch!”
The cook, a heavy set Hawai’ian man named Nick with tattoo on his face, approached him grinning the whole time. “Hey, you like peanut butter cups?”
In turn, Tony confided in Steve how lonely his childhood was, while omitting a few key details such as the fact that his house was more of a mansion in the middle Fifth Avenue, and that his nanny was really a butler. He told Steve that he used to be a defense contractor, but a crisis of faith and conscience led him to rethink his whole life’s work.
“What? That Alpha fine, okay. But my devotion for Tony Stark and my disdain for infidelity wouldn’t let me do it.”
Tony wasn’t ashamed to admit that he whimpered at Steve’s words. When he pulled back, Steve was smiling mischievously at him. Tony wanted to taste that smile on his lips and surged forward to capture Steve’s lips in a deeper kiss. Steve responded with fervor, pulling Tony closer to him and holding him up by the waist. As they kissed, Tony felt Steve stood up, and without breaking their kiss, Tony lifted his legs to wind the around Steve’s waist. He felt Steve placed his big hands underneath his thighs, and walking them towards the pool.
“I’d prefer pragmatic and rational, thanks. And it’s called being a businessman, my dear.” Tony grinned devilishly at Sharon.
“And we are going to be training you on the fundamentals of self-defense and strength training. I want to see just how strong you are, Peter.” Papa added to him.
Tony still remembered what Jarvis told him before he died, how proud he was of Tony, how honored he was to be a part of Tony’s life and how he knew that the best of Tony was to come. Tony’s heart clenched with grief. It had been four years ago, now, but the pain of losing Jarvis was still fresh in his mind. Jarvis was more of a dad than Dad ever was. Jarvis raised him, he was there for every graduation, every science fair competition, every skinned knee he couldn’t heal himself. Jarvis was important to Tony.
“Bruce did.” Steve answered for him. Fury could only sigh exasperatedly, and hoped that the aneurysm he could feel building at the back of his head didn’t explode while he dealt with these idiots.
“Hmm, it was more like the way he behaved. I mean, this is the guy who insisted on rescheduling Peter’s baptism because it fell on the same day of a Lady Gaga concert. Speaking of concert, JARVIS, who’s playing this Hootie song?” now that Tony listened closely, the song playing on the speaker was Let Her Cry by Hootie and the Blowfish.
It was then Tony realized that Steve had no idea of who he was. This was a chance for Tony to completely reinvent himself. Tony couldn’t believe his luck. Here he was, sitting in front of the most gorgeous man he’d ever seen and he could finally be with someone without the added burden of his fame and his past.
Peter was pretty smug about it all, bragging to Ned that he bagged Joe a boyfriend, which Joe halfheartedly deny in between the blushing and the indignant sputtering. He and Jamie haven’t made anything official, haven’t even talked about what it was that they have. They’re friends, perhaps a little bit more than friends, but not quite in the boyfriend territory yet. Hell, they rarely touched each other. Other than that one instance where they basically held hands as they walked from the cafeteria to Joe’s Physics class, their touches have been limited to Jamie touching Joe’s shoulder before he left for class, or that one time when he touched Joe’s cheek. He didn’t think he stopped blushing the entire day. Auntie Nat even asked if he had a fever when he came home that day.
“I, for one, am looking forward to watching this movie you picked, Bruce,” Thor beamed at Bruce, eliciting a blush from the brunette scientist.
“Sir, are you alright?” Adonis opened his mouth again, brow furrowing in concern as Anthony remained silent in the face of his question.
(He looked so cute though. Tony might have made JARVIS took pictures in all of the angles possible to take pictures in.)
Tony gasps softly at the question. He doesn’t know for sure, but Tony’s pretty certain that if Steve uses his shield to stab him in the chest, it will hurt less.
“They squabble and quarrel amongst themselves just like humans. They are openly jealous of each other, they tried to sabotage each other at every turn. They’re dysfunctional and some of them, I can say with great clarity, are murderous. So they are indeed no different than the mortals that worshipped them.”
“No, you’re not.” Anthony retorted back, his eyes squinted and peering at Steven, “No son of a mere fisherman would have a shield like that, or those boots, or that helmet.” Anthony pointed at each items, “and they certainly won’t have the brute strength to tear open a sea monster in two with their bare hands.” he gestured at the carcass of Cetus lying on the sands, coloring it with its blood,  “So, who are you really, Steven? And is that why you won’t accept my proposal?” Anthony challenged.
Just as he was starting to shook his thoughts off Steve to actually started paying attention to what Blond guy said, a song came blaring through the sound system of the club. It was a shitty Club remix version of Springsteen’s Dancing In The Dark. And Tony, well Tony promptly burst into tears.
“Buck, somebody put this guy on Tony.” Steve said to his brother as they settled in the open seats on the diner’s counter. Bucky looked at him pityingly, “What?”
It was summer now, and Ulysses was home from school much to the delight of his parents and his little brothers. They had been spending a lot of time together while Papa and Babbo were away in Europe. Babbo had been invited to give a keynote speech at CERN for their sixtieth year anniversary, and of course Papa had to tag along because he was secretly a nerd and also because those two could never be apart for long. Not that they ever wanted to.
Tony closed his eyes, willing the tears he’s holding back from dropping. He leaned his forehead against Steve and whispered, “I love you too. So much. That’s why I don’t want…”
“Nah. I told him if he doesn’t leave us alone, I’d kill him. And he believes me.” Steve groaned, dropping his body on the recliner situated by Tony’s desk.
“You’ll be fine. Take it down the Nu’uanu Pali for a spin. You’re the best mechanic in the world. You know that car inside and out. What’s the worst that could happen?” Natasha encouraged him.
“What…” Steve faintly croaked out. Ulysses, seeing a cat on Clint’s lap, started to coo and reached out for a chance to pet the animal, while Tony sighed the sigh of man who has been suffering long and arduously.
“Please, like you could exchange Steve for anything. He’s one of a kind, obviously.” Tony sauntered in to the living room, Ulysses on his heels carrying a small bowl of popcorn.
“They think I’m the killer.” Steve whispered to Tony, as if confessing a terrible crime he didn’t commit.
As expected Rhodey folded like a wet paper bag. “The honor is mine, Captain. Tony.” he nodded at Tony, grinning like a loon.
“Well, glad to know at least one person thinks the Omega is the logical one in this relationship.” Tony said wryly.
“You had plans, and a life before you meet me.” Steve continued, unaware that he was breaking Tony’s heart as he spoke, “and now all you have time for is to make me fall in love with you every day.”
“Alright, Tony. Everything looks good. The baby is growing as expected, reaching all the appropriate milestones. Your blood pressure is also very good throughout this pregnancy. We don’t have to worry about pre-eclampsia rearing its ugly head.”
“Wow, your infatuation is worse than I thought. I’ve never seen you like this before and I was around for the beginnings of your puberty and when you discovered Astronomy. No, he’s talking to Peter again now. But I saw his eyes flickered up for like, 0.05 microseconds. So he must have thought your sorry ass was worth peeling his eyes away from his StarkPad.”
“Thank you, doctor.” Tony told him, “really, thank you for helping us from the start. We really appreciate it.”
Steve looked to Natasha in question, asking her whether Barton was on the up and up. Natasha answered him definitively, “He’s good.”
“Oh, so all this time you’ve known about your youngest brother being a masked vigilante that swings about the streets of New York in tights and just what? Forgot to tell us?” Tony exclaimed, hands flailing and gesturing like the angry Italian parent that he was, “You’re the oldest one. You’re supposed to be the most mature one.” Tony told Ulysses, “Unbelievable! Betrayed! By my own flesh and blood! All of you are grounded until the day you die!” Tony yelled out, “Or until the day I die, whichever comes first!”
Obie smile, a little smug in Tony’s opinion. Tony stood up from his chair, wanting to leave and escape to the comfort of his workshop, “Welcome aboard, my boy.” Obie said, and hugged him.
“Boy, you better stop lying to me and your Papa or I will fly up there and tan your hide.” Tony told him.
“Yeah, bud. It sucks but that’s life. Sometimes it gives you a swift kick in the ass and knocks you down.” Clint said, “But you just have to keep moving forward. It might not feel like it for now, but it might be a blessing in disguise.” Tony shot Clint a grateful look, because despite the crass wording, Clint’s message was true.
As he turned around, he saw Sit Well approaching him and walking up to the center stage. As he came closer to Steve, he leaned in and whispered, “My brother would like to talk to you. He’s waiting out back.”
Just before they entered the pool, Steve stopped and stripped off Tony’s shirt and pants before doing the same thing with his own. Tony grinned at the sight of Steve’s naked body, reaching out to caress that hard rock set of abs that still sends tendrils of lust shooting through his body. “Hey there, big boy,” Tony murmured, eyes focused on Steve’s thick hard cock, his knot was starting to build at the base and Tony felt the tell-tale slick and wetness on his hole in response. Steve chuckled lightly and pulled Tony back in, kissing him again. Steve nipped at his bottom lip, seeking entrance and when Tony opened his lips, his tongue sojourned in, plundering his mouth and taking what Tony offered to him and giving Tony so much more in return. All his love and affection, his happiness, his sadness, his everything. Tony wanted it all. They must have been kissing for a long time because when they broke apart, they were in the pool. Steve the ever considerate mate that he was, took extra care to make sure that when they entered the pool, Tony’s head wasn’t submerged in the water. Tony clung to him, winding his arms around his neck and kissing him in gratitude.
For awhile, Tony didn’t believe it either. His previous life was all about SI, parties and inventing new weaponry or equipments for SI’s bottom line. That shrapnel to the chest was a massive wake up call to him. It showed him just how he didn’t want his legacy to be. It showed him that he was meant more than creating something destructive. Though late, Tony did turn his life around. Then Steve and the Avengers entered his life, and any chances of him going back to his old life after these weird, loud, obnoxious but amazing people became his family became nonexistent.
“I bet he fakes a pass at Odell and throws a pass at Gallmann at the End Zone. Loser does the dishes?” Bucky challenged, ignoring the look Joe directed at him.
Steve nuzzled his face into the crook of Tony’s neck where his scent was strongest, reveling in the calm and serenity it brought him, “I behaved like a right bastard to you the whole day. No one should treat you that way, not even me.”
Not knowing what else to do, Steve gently touched Tony’s arm. He didn’t expect however for Tony to wrench his arm away and rushed to his feet as if preparing to run away. It was only when he saw Steve in front him, that he calmed down and relaxed, albeit not by much.
“You designed it yourself. Nothing short of an act of God will short circuit it,” Natasha calmly arched her perfectly threaded eyebrow.
They had won. Saved the day and all that jazz. But what was most important to Steve as he walked towards Stark Tower that day was the person walking hand in hand next to him. Tony was here, still here with Steve against all odds. They’d found each other again, as unlikely as it was, but here they were: two souls finding their counterparts in each other, two halves of a whole. And this time, Steve wouldn’t let go.
“They all know that you’d kill anyone who was going to hurt me. And that man, Rumlow, was going to hurt me.”
“Love you too.” he answered, happiness shining through his eyes. Words can’t describe how much he loves this man. How much he completes Tony, and how Tony would do anything to keep him happy. After Steve’s knot went down and slipped out of him, Steve moved to settle beside Tony. Tugging his mate to sleep closer to him, Steve positioned them so he could spoon Tony from behind. Steve gave him one last kiss on his lips, then like a light the two lovers succumbed to pull of sleep not knowing that a storm was brewing on the horizon.
“Okay.” Tony readily agreed, not really looking forward to rehashing the whole event with the rest of the pack. “I’m sorry I lost it, Steve. I should have known better. You don’t get lucky twice.”
and since Thor had never watched it before and it was one of the movies that Steve actually had watched before going under, he decided to leave it at that channel.
“That’s not true,” Tony stammered, “That’s not all I do. I just solved the world’s biggest energy conundrum this morning. And made at least 10 grand, just standing here having a conversation with you.”
Then one summer, Steve had a growth spurt like no other. Joe was away on tour, so all he knew was that he left behind a 5’0” 15 year old son and came back to a 16 year old son who was as tall as him at 6’2”. His boy also gained the ability to put on muscle, and has since become eligible to play football for the high school’s varsity team. So Steve’s healthy now, and Joe felt like he has one less thing to worry about. And with Steve’s apparent academic and athletic aptitudes, Joe had no doubt that Steve would be able to secure an athletic scholarship to UH, ensuring his education and future.
“Hmm, I guess.” Tony conceded, still feeling unsure and worried because somehow something didn’t feel right this time.
“We’d be honored if you were to become one of Ulysses’ godfathers, Colonel.” Steve continued, purposefully using Rhodey’s rank because Tony had told him before how much of a Captain America fanboy Rhodey was. Although no one could top Tony as the ultimate, number one, super duper Captain America fan. He bore Captain America’s son, okay. No other fan could even come close to that.
Tony punched him in the stomach, though he knew Steve wouldn’t be feeling it, “Like you’re one to talk, Mr. I-only-follow-rules-that-suit-me.”
“Not a ‘no’, Anthony. Just, not yet. You don’t know anything about me, and neither I you. What if our initial connection and attraction to each other aren’t enough to sustain a lifelong commitment like marriage?”
The TV was playing a commercial about some product called Oxiclean, apparently it was good for removing stains from clothes and whatever else got stained on. The man they had promoting the stuff was pretty annoying in his delivery, if you asked Steve. Almost like he was forcing them to buy his product. He sighed, reaching for more popcorn on Tony’s belly, wishing for once they finally invented something that could fast forward through commercials on live TV.
Steven placed an arm around Anthony’s shoulder and tried to subtly guide the man away from the statue, “Yes, well if you ever get a chance to meet Clint you’ll see that he is a far cry from the image of the Sun God everyone has been taught.”
“Tony! Tony! Tony! Wake up, Tony! It’s just a dream!” Steve was roused awake by the shaking and the whimpers he could feel coming from Tony. Next to him, Tony was curled up on his side, still nude from their love making and his face contorted in misery. Steve tried to wake him up, to shake his lover out of his nightmare by shouting at him. He had learned the hard way not to touch anyone who was battle trained during the throes of nightmare. But Tony wasn’t waking up, and Steve couldn’t bear to see him suffer longer.
With St. Patrick’s Day coming and going, Easter was the next holiday to come around. And honestly, Tony had been expecting this conversation in awhile. It just didn’t mean he was completely psyched to have it.
Never one to turn down a challenge, Steve agreed “You’re on.” They shook on it and turned their attention back to the game where the announcer then said exactly what Bucky had predicted would happen. Gallmann did run the ball in to the End Zone and scored another touchdown for the Giants.
“Yes, I understand.” Thor said gravely to his StarkPhone, sitting on the couch in the Penthouse living room that morning, looking for all the world like he was having a root canal from his pained expression. Steve had just finished working out and was on his way to the kitchen to grab some post-workout snack. It was a peculiar sight for Steve since Thor, the God of Thunder, was usually the most outgoing out of all of them. He was always ready with a smile or a joke, ready to have some fun and spread some joy in everybody’s life. If someone had a bad day, they usually sought Thor out. He was always down for everything be it some fun exploding things in the lab (Tony and Bruce), a sparring match on the superhuman level that left both of them unable to move (Steve), bowling and other sports tournaments (Clint, Bucky and Sam), baking Eastern European pastries (Natasha) or watching Peppa Pig and Disney movies for the thousandth time with his nephews. On the television, a game of Mario Kart seemed abandoned, the lone Princess Peach (Thor’s go to character when playing Mario Kart) stationary on the screen and left behind by the other computer controlled players. Thor must have been in the middle of his racing game when he hurriedly answered his phone.
“It would be a good learning experience. I’ve been wanting to watch this movie for awhile. Besides it’s my turn to pick the movie for movie night. If I have to watch Die Hard for twenty seven times, you guys can stand to watch Blackfish once.”
“Say yes, Babbo!” Peter shouted from the other side of the courtyard and was promptly shushed by his brothers and aunt and uncles. Steve and Tony didn’t mind though, they just laughed at Peter’s interruption of their moment.
Tony was silent for a beat. Then, looking more resolute, he told Steve, “I will tell you. But in private,”
“Oh, Steve, that feels so good,” he moaned, eyes closed and hands gripping at the pillows under him, “I’m so wet for you, Alpha. Can you feel it? Just for you,” Tony said.
“Uncle Thor…” Peter looked on, horrified at his godfather, while Bruce just face palmed in exasperation.
“JARVIS, call Ulysses now!” Tony bellowed out his command as he frogmarched his two sons into the living room, Steve following sedately behind him. His poor mate looked shell shocked, this was the most unnerved Tony has ever seen him and Tony saw him in the aftermath of Thanos’ attempted invasion of Earth a couple of years back.
“Two hundred million unregistered guns in the United States, and somehow this one found its way into our stereo system.” Jarvis remarked. Steve turned back to him, a frown marring his handsome face.
“Yeah. There was some internal bleeding, but thankfully the embryo survived.” Bruce sighed. He took of his glasses and rubbed his eyes, “Why didn’t you tell us?”
Clint’s words seemed to shook Steve out of his stupor, as he vaulted over the couch to Tony and started to hysterically fuss over him. “Tony! Your water just broke! Oh my God, should we go to the hospital? What do we do?!”
On one of their last days in Hawaii, Pepper and Rhodey declared they wanted to go to the beach, a real beach with other people around them, as opposed to the private beach that Tony has in his backyard. It was all kinds of ridiculous, wanting to go to a beach that was riddled with tourists and fight over a spot on the sand, but Tony indulge them since they have been kind enough to come all the way to Hawaii and accompany him through the first and hopefully only heartbreak he ever experienced. So they went to Waikiki Beach, to a place on the beach Tony thought has less tourist traffic compared to the other parts. Pepper went for a swim, while Rhodey tried his hand at surfing. He wasn’t very good at staying on the board and ended up just paddling around on the board, while Tony declined to go anywhere near the water with his shirt on.
And he was so, so beautiful. The most beautiful Omega Jamie had ever seen in his short 17 years on this Earth. His blue eyes framed by black clunky glasses, those mesmerizing ice blue orbs that sometimes followed Jamie to his sleep, and that blonde hair, soft spun and shining like golden strands in the sunlight. Jamie sighed wistfully just thinking about it. It seemed that Joe inherited the best of both of his parents. His smile was soft and kind hearted, like Captain America, and with a touch of mischievousness in them like Tony Stark. At five-eleven, he was tall, probably the tallest Omega Jamie had ever met, but that only made him even more perfect in Jamie’s eyes. With Jamie’s own six foot two inches stature, he was pretty tall for an Alpha too. When he used to date Cheryl Feinberg, he had to bend down pretty far just to hug or kiss her, which sometimes gave him a crick in the neck or back. But with Joe, if they were to embrace Joe’s face would be perfectly nestled in the crook of his neck. Jamie flushed at the thought, hoping desperately that it didn’t show on his face. It would be pretty embarrassing to be blushing like a weirdo in front of his own locker.
Tony took one look at him and rushed to the front of the club, leaving behind a group of bewildered bar employees. As they stepped outside and ran to the back of the bar, they saw that the fight was over between the two men. Tony saw Steve and an African American man slumped on the back of the truck that delivered their supplies. They seemed to both be nursing some type of injuries. Steve’s opponent seemed to be favoring his right shoulder, while Steve had blood trails running down his grey shirt.
“Yeah, Buck’s doing fine now. He’s probably gonna still be very nervous and skittish around the rest of the family, but he’s getting there.” Steve reassured him, “is that all? Me, not being here too much? Are you sure Bucky being here is no issue for you?”
“That’s Captain I-only-follow-rules-that-suit-me, mister.” Steve grinned, stroking his hand through Tony’s thick dark hair, memorizing his love’s new scent. Some things remained the same, the burnt metal, the smell of grease still clung to him. But there were some new notes like the sweet smell of coconut, musk and amber that seemed to permeate every inch of Tony’s body.
“Are you, in fact, acting as our solicitor in this matter?” Edwin Jarvis, the bar’s deejay, tech guy and Tony’s left hand man asked.
“Controlled thermonuclear fission aren’t feasible because the fulfilments of the Lawson criteria remain unachievable on Earth.”
“Aloha, Nick,” Adonis -no, Steve- answered absent-mindedly. His voice was deep and cultured, sending shivers down Tony’s spine.
“Oh, you gonna regret that,” Tony said again as another wave of contraction hit him. He squeezed Steve’s hand and screamed as he bore down as Steve told him to.
There was a collective groan from the team, except Steve and Bucky who didn’t understand the significance of Blackfish in pop culture.
, because if he hadn’t been a petty brat that night, would he have been able to save Mom and die in her place?
When they got there, there were people milling around with their children, jogging, walking their dogs or just walking around the park enjoying the warm Spring weather. There were people, most likely tourists, taking picture with the Captain America monument. Ulysses excitedly ran towards the monument, eager to see his Papa’s statue, Tony following sedately behind pushing Joe’s stroller. Ulysses stopped near the statue, politely waiting until the people taking pictures were finished before bouncing up and greeting the statue.
Tony leaned his body closer to his mate’s. “Another boy. Oh, Steve. This time this one better look like me, or there would be no justice in this world.”
“J, what would be the best way to break the Coulomb barrier necessary to fuse two nuclei together?” Tony asked, booting up the workshop. JARVIS helpfully display their latest simulation, showing a Helium nuclei in the process of fusing with a hydrogen nuclei.
“Well, that’s unacceptable. Where can I appeal this decision?” Tony asked the blond beta detective, rushing to keep up with the flurry of movement accompanying her.
Tony and Clint cracked up loudly at the memory. Steve had looked so horrified when he realized he had a chest full of baby poop. “And, and, and remember that time he brought home an opossum, thinking it was a puppy. I thought Sam and Bucky were gonna shit a brick.” They laughed some more, recounting Ulysses’ shenanigans growing up.
Ever since his open heart surgery, he had some reservations about being bare chested in front of strangers. The scars left on his body weren’t for the faint of heart. Even during his pre-Steve one-night stands he never took of his shirt with them, leaving on the tank top he usually wore under his dress shirts. So he was lounging around under a huge beach umbrella sipping a pina colada, wearing a linen shirt and a pair of Ray Bans. After two weeks spent with his oldest and best friends, Tony felt himself starting to get over his heartbreak. Steve was the first, and probably only, man he ever fell in love with. It was understandable for him to feel the after effects of a terminated relationship as intensely as he did. Maybe in time he would be able to look at those six months they spent together and remembered only the good stuff, the feelings Steve elicited from him, how Steve made Tony feel loved and cherished and treasured for the first time in his long and arduous life. And though Steve might not remember it, Tony hoped he managed to convey all of his love to Steve and that he would remember the phantom feelings of having someone love as completely and devotedly as Tony once had.
, because Steve kept this from him. How long has Steve known about this? Was he only telling Tony about this to clear his conscience so Tony would be more amenable to look for Barnes for him? More
Tony looped his arms around Steve’s neck as they continued kissing. The feeling of Steve’s soft, plush lips against his own dry ones was like heaven, like the first taste of water after wandering the desert for years. It was life affirming and all consuming.
“You should see the other guy.” Steve joked deprecatingly, his lips quirked up in a grin that Tony was helpless to reciprocate.
“I know, darling,” Thor said again. Ah, he must be talking to Jane then, Steve thought. “I never said that you didn’t care, just that you have more important things in your mind to worry about.”
“Seriously, who are you?!” Anthony shrieked in Steven’s ears. It wasn’t everyday that one encountered a handsome man who rescued them from the gaping jaws of doom.
Steve smiled at the mention of Tony’s mother, “So would mine.” he reached for Tony’s hand and entwined their fingers together, “so we agree? Baptize Ulysses now, and let him decide later on if he wants to be confirmed?”
“I’m sorry that this is all I could do for you. You deserve a better Christmas celebration. Better than flat champagne and some smoked fish from the SSR mess hall.” Steve muttered despondently. He felt Natasha touched her hand, taking the champagne glass out of his hand and placing it on the table next to him.
A quick peek at his left side ensured him Tony was still sitting next to him and that the broken coffee mug lying at his feet was what startled him before. Surprisingly, Tony made no move to clean up the spilled coffee or made any move at all considering his wet pant leg, doused by the hot spilled coffee.
Steve was silent for awhile, evaluating the situation. He could do this, he could help Tony deliver their child. “Alright, alright, Tony. We’ll do this together.” The stripped off his wool sweater to place it under Tony’s open legs, leaving him only in the white wife beater he was weathered before Tony informed him his water just broke.
“Tony’s cheating on you with Killian, Stevie.”  Oh God, this again. Steve sighed, “Not this again, Bucky.”
Tony was in the workshop that morning, working on another upgrade for the robotics he wanted to install in Bucky’s arms as well as in the prosthetics that SI provided for free to veterans through their rehabilitation clinics. But his head was pounding, and his vision was starting to blur.
“Hey guys,” Bruce greeted them, “guess they told you, huh?” he nodded towards Bucky and Sharon who was walking at the direction of the restrooms.
He and Steve agreed to keep the pregnancy a secret until they passed the 20th week, as per usual. Nobody noticed anything out of the ordinary, since they were busy with whatever was on their own plates at the moment. Natasha and Clint have been staying in the facility Upstate for the last couple of weeks only coming back down for the weekend, training new SHIELD and Avengers recruits. Sam was called away by the VA to handle a crisis involving a veteran with a severe case of PTSD in Wyoming. Bucky went with him to back him up and accompany him. Bruce was away on a Physics conference in San Diego, giving the keynote speech and other than the Stark-Rogerses Thor was around, left behind to care for their daughter and the daily happenings on New Asgard through conference calls with Brunhilde.
That afternoon, they were all gathered in the living room again. Pepper was with them that night, flitting from one Avengers to the next, making sure they were still dressed appropriately from the earlier Baptism and were ready for their next event: a family photo shoot.
Jamie sighed. He knew he was just spouting some bullshit excuses, but the truth of the matter was he was
Steve scooted over to him, letting him see their youngest son for the first time and transferring the baby from his hold to Tony’s. He took Natasha’s place behind Tony, letting Tony leaned his body on Steve’s “Hi, baby.” Tony whispered reverently, “it’s so good to finally meet you, sweetheart.”
Steve flipped through some pages in the journal at an alarmingly fast paced, “We can skip that part,” he shrugged.
“How is this going to affect the baby, doctor?” Steve asked again, reminding Dr. Rosenberg that he had yet to answer one of his questions.
Peter was acting weird. Weirder than usual, which was saying something. It also didn’t help that before third period started, Ned said he saw Peter and Jamie disappeared into an empty classroom, and then they were apparently late for their respective classes. Joe had been waiting all morning to corner Peter and asked him what that was all about, but alas this semester the only class they shared together was PE, and it wasn’t scheduled until later in the day.
“Tony? Sweetheart, I’m home,” Steve started walking to the living room, calling out to the seemingly empty mansion, “Sorry, I was a bit late. The STRIKE team had a bit of a confusion when I told them to drop me off in Malibu, I didn’t mean for them to literally to drop me off the plane above Malibu, but here we are. Where is he, JARVIS?”
“Okay…” Jamie looked incredulous, “I’m an only child so I have zero reference on how siblings behave with each other, but is this normal sibling behavior?”
Everyone thought Thor was joking, beta males as a rule didn’t get pregnant, but apparently being mated to Thor, God of Fertility, was enough to defy biology and lo and behold, Bruce and Thor’s daughter, Aurora Jean Banner-Odinson, Princess of Asgard, was born two years ago. Everyone rejoiced, they finally got their long awaited niece.
“I’ve been trying to propose to Tony! And you people keep ruining the moment with “going to jail,” to Sam, Clint and Bucky,  “and fighting with other kids, albeit for justifiable reasons” to the boys, “and losing your own baby because you were too busy arguing about which of your alter egos your mate was more attracted to.” to Bruce and Thor. “Tony and I never had a bonding ceremony. We had a shotgun bonding at a city hall, and afterwards we were too busy building up the Avengers after SHIELD dissolved. And we just...just never had time to stop and properly celebrate our relationship.”
By mid morning the ring was forged, cooled and ready for Tony to engrave it. A smooth, shiny silver band that felt solid and sturdy enough for Steve’s big hands. Tony engraved the insides with their initials and the date of the day they first met. Satisfied with his handiwork, he told JARVIS to put in an order for a ring box to store the ring in while in the meantime Tony would keep in one of the drawers by his work desk.
“Steve, we could be celebrating Christmas at a foxhole in the Eastern front right now and I would be happy with it. As long as I’m celebrating it with you, I don’t care about anything else.” Natasha said, then seeming to rethink her words she added, “well actually, spending Christmas Eve at a foxhole would be awful. I wouldn’t wish that on my worst enemy.”
Washington DC at night was loud and busy. Tony never noticed before but his wandering mind couldn’t help but take in the cacophony of cars and pedestrians, all hurrying to get through the hustle and bustle of the DC metro area. Even at this hour of the night, the streets were still packed, tourists and college students were everywhere, spilling to the streets in search of the fun and release offered by DC’s nightlife scene. Tony listlessly walked along the streets with his head down, something he never remembered doing in all his life. Tony Stark has always held his head up high. They told him that it was unbecoming for the heir of a multibillion dollar company to project self-defeat and submission. It was unbecoming for the heir of a multibillion dollar company to be an
“I know, babe. I’m the one in labor here,” Tony told him, “also, can you stop squeezing my hand, honey? It hurts.”
In the midst of all the clusterfuck that was today, Tony totally forgot that Steve had greenlighted Clint and his band of well-meaning idiots to audition to be the live entertainment for the band. So it was with great reluctance that he accompanied Steve as part of the audience. All he wanted was to go home or lay down in his office, but here he was being one half of the united front with his mate.
“God, I wish they would just told us whose body they found.” Steve rubbed his face in consternation at the thought that one of his employees had been harmed in anyway.
Omg you guys, I haven't had a toke in 7 years and I totally blacked out. Also edibles are dangerous, they hit you out of nowhere.
Rhodey, being Rhodey, knew exactly what to say to bring a smile to Tony’s face, “Nah. Then he’d just realize what a bore you are.”
“Thanks, Joe. I really appreciate it.” Tony conveyed his gratitude. And just to satisfy his curiosity, he asked, “how’s, uh, how’s Steve?”
“What did I tell you, huh? Am I a genius or what!” Tony laughed. He felt invincible, undefeated. He did it! He solved the sustainability problem of the arc reactor and he managed to achieve the first ever self sustaining controlled nuclear fusion reaction in the world. His life’s work was complete. Illuminated by the blue lights of the workshop and the particle accelerator, he smiled.
But before JARVIS could answer, he spotted Tony in the Iron Man armor sitting on one of the couches in the living room.
Also I know in the myth Perseus was the one who married Andromeda, but this Tony Stark and he would totally be the one who asked Steve to marry him because he's Tony Stark. nuff said
“Hey guys,” he sidled up next to them, casually resting his hand on the small of Joe’s back, “good morning. Peter, how are you feeling?”
On his last episode, he spent the day destroying every gym equipment in the tower and then some before he went to the workshop, seeking Tony to beg for his forgiveness for being short and irritable the whole day. That day Steve was hurting all over. His head and heart hurt. When he woke up that morning and saw Tony next to him, he felt an inexplicable resentment at the fact that it was Tony sleeping next to him and not Natasha. It was irrational and unwieldy to feel this way. For all intents and purposes, Tony and Natasha were the same person, they have the same soul for god’s sakes. Steve shouldn’t be feeling this way, but he did. After he straightened himself out, showered to wash off the sweat and flecks of blood on his knuckles, he dressed in his Sunday best with a mission to take Tony out for dinner as a way to apologize for his behavior today.
“That’s it, baby. Let it go, let go, Tony. Come for me. Let me see you lose yourself, beautiful.” Steve encouraged, his hips still maintaining their steady rhythm. Tony’s eyes slammed shut as he reached his climax, his heartbeat skyrocketed, he felt his back arched and his cock released a burst of cum signaling his completion. As Tony comes down, he felt Steve still and unmoving inside him.
“From midnight until 4 AM, I was in my office.” Tony talked slowly, like he was explaining something to a small child. “Then I went home.
“Walked to Lincoln Memorial. Never been.” Tony tonelessly answered. His tone was flat, devoid of emotion.
“Ugh, that’s way too much information.” Bucky pulled a face, moving to the refrigerator to pull out a carton of orange juice.
Just then Sue walked by and spotted him. She looked alarmed at his presence here. Tony thought she finally recognized him as who he really was, since he looked more put together today than he was yesterday. Just as Tony thought she would say something about Tony Stark being at her dinner, Steve’s voice interrupted her.
Steve shook his head, “I’m not gonna forget about it. I already wrote it down, I won’t let myself. And I’m gonna do it whether you want me to or not. Please respect my decision, Tony. I’ll be at my house. I’ll see you tonight.” and with that, he turned taking all the joy in Tony’s life with him. Tony absentmindedly thought about that ring he hid in the drawers of his work desk and had another thought to remind JARVIS to cancel the ring box order. Steve didn’t want it anyway.
Ulysses grinned at his parents, before saying, “No.” then he clapped and squealed when Tony let out a laugh.
Tony woke up slowly, his head felt thick like he’d been swimming in molasses. His head was throbbing and pounding, he hadn’t felt this way in awhile. It felt like he just drink a fifth of Vodka and did some drugs on the side then came down in the worst way possible. He felt himself groan in pain, his head moving on the soft surface it was resting on in search for something to soothe the pain when he felt hands gently carding through his thick brown hair. It felt so good, especially when those hands started to scratch his scalp just the way he liked it. Tony wasn’t ashamed to admit he purred a little bit. But this whole thing seemed odd. He shouldn’t be relaxing in bed, having his hair stroked to complacency with such affection by someone who smelled so good, like sandalwood and teak and musk and everything nice under the sun. Tony nuzzled closer to the hand on his hair, willing whoever it was to pet him some more. Tentatively, Tony opened his eyes, squinting against the dim lighting of the room. As his gaze focused, he found himself gazing up into the worried gaze of one Steve Rogers. Steve Rogers who apparently had been the one stroking Tony’s hair.
“I’m telling you, me redesigning your entire catalogue of suits was the best thing that ever happened to you. That nightmare Coulson made you wear the first time we met was a travesty. I’m sure I wasn’t the only who thought so.” Tony said from his position on his work desk, Ulysses on his lap with a pencil and drafting paper in his hand.
Tony took that as an assent to go up and started running up the stairs, calling out Steve’s name as he went up.
Their meal arrived shortly. When Tony noticed that his paella contained unpeeled head-on shrimps, “Shrimps.” Steve then obligingly transferred all the shrimps to his plate.
Next hint that something was different was when he totally busted down his door just by trying to open in. Peter stared in disbelief at the door in his hand, which he was holding as if it weighed no more than a piece of paper instead of a reinforced wood and gingerly placed it on the side, propped up on the wall.
“Wow. Wow I can’t believe this. I’m a Nobel laureate. Oh my God, Steve, do you know what this means?”
“Good morning,” the tall blonde woman said, flashing her badge to him, “I’m Detective Carter, NYPD.”
“Thank you, Groot,” Steven told him kindly, then helped Anthony mount the horse before hefting himself up Groot’s back and settling behind Anthony. Anthony leaned his body back towards his and smiled mischievously up at him. Steven was helpless not to return that charming smile, nor was he able to resist the urge to place a light kiss on the prince’s lips. Anthony hummed happily at the kiss and deepened the kiss by placing his hand on the back of Steven’s head, opening his mouth and slyly caressing Steven’s lips with his tongue.
Tony groaned, “I can see that telling you to dispense with the academic elite traditions of title dropping is a waste of time, so I’m not even gonna bother. Yeah, I’m still here. What do you want?”
“Get it.” Tony mumbled from his position on Steve’s chest, nestling further to chase after the comforting scent of his mate.
“Tony Stark.” he replied. They were quiet for a beat, staring at each other and letting the handshake go on a little longer than was appropriate.
“Maybe you’re just having problems because you’ve been doing this long-distance thing. Since she’ll be here soon, isn’t it worth it to see if things are still the same if you’re close to each other? Say, how long will she be here?”
“Well, dig this,” Steve started, stopping Falcon on his tracks as he advanced closer to Tony, “I recognize your personal talent. But I don’t book you or your proteges because of your brother.”
Tony jerked up in his hospital bed as he remembered what happened. Steve. Steve was hurt, badly. They were going to operate on him. And Tony needed to be there. Needed to be with his mate. To comfort him, to hold his hand, to make sure that Steve knew he wasn’t going to go under again. No, not as long as Tony was alive.
“No, but you can start now.” Tony grinned. And Steve was helpless not to kiss him senseless. Thor and Jane might be on the rocks right now, but he and Tony were as strong as ever in their relationship. And if Steve had his way, they would always be from now until the end of time.
“Okay,” Dr. Rosenberg turned back around to the fancy ultrasound machine Tony built to accommodate him during his extended period of bedrest with Joe, “and...it looks like you will be having…” the doctor paused for dramatic effect, peering at the photo then turned back to them, “another boy!”
“What would you say if I told you that notebook you read and write in every day, used to have a lot of stuff about me in it?
“Of course, valiant knight,” Anthony responded cheerfully, smiling up at this intriguing man who came in to his rescue. Everything about him entranced Anthony and he felt himself eager to know more about this man, to stay with him even after everything was over.
“Oh, the lady down at the farmers’ market gave it to me. I didn’t wanna hurt her feelings.” he explained. Steve pursed his lips, disappointed their yearly pineapple-picking excursion was cancelled. But a small smile graced his lips at hearing the reason behind the pineapple’s appearance in the first place.
Clint nodded in assent and reached for the thankfully intact communicator, connecting them to the Avengers facility and calling for a quinjet to airlift them out, telling them to bring an emergency medical crew with them because Captain America was in critical condition.
Joe squealed sweetly at his parents, his blue eyes shining with glee and he giggled at his parents eliciting fond and loving smiles from the both. “
Tony grinned, appreciating the change in topic to something he’s more inclined to discuss “Nowadays I’m all about renewable energy. Did you know that Hawai’i is the state in the Union with the highest usage of solar energy per capita?”
And Steve, well he was only an Alpha, okay? How could anyone ever resist the gift and temptation that was Tony Stark. He wound his arm around Tony’s waist, soft and trim; his scent still bore some of that milky sweetness he would have when lactating, it was an intoxicating scent that awaken something primal within Steve. This omega was his, down to the very core of his being, and they have created a life together. Steve brought his head down to kiss Tony but before he could taste those sweet, sweet lips, a pudgy hand grabbed his and Tony’s cheek and squeezed, halting his movement.
So Steve was sullen, snappish and moody for most of his recovery. Most of the Avengers avoided him, or only visited for short intervals. If they did visit, they would be carrying one of the boys in their arms because having the boys around seemed to appease Steve’s moodiness. He wouldn’t snap at them as much if they were holding one of the boys.
But deep down inside, Peter finally felt like he found his niche. He finally found his purpose. Sure, the way he got there was non-conventional, but it felt as if his whole life led to this moment. Really, with Tony Stark and Steve Rogers as parents there was no way he would have turn out any other way. A lifetime of listening to his parents telling him and his siblings that they need to put the needs of others above their own self interests, that they have an obligation to help others to the best of their abilities and that in times of conflicts, doing nothing and staying neutral was empowering the oppressor, it was only natural that Peter ended up using his newfound powers the way he did.
“Is this because I used to drink? It is, isn’t it? My unborn child is being punished for the things I did when I was young.” Tony asked, his tone hysterical.
As Tony grew older, his adoration for Captain America went past the figure head and the values he embodied. Steve Rogers became Tony’s standard for every partner he managed to have. Steve was handsome. His angular jaw, his patrician features along with his golden hair, like spun gold and his blue eyes, like the color of the brightest sky made him the most beautiful and handsomest man in Tony’s book, regardless of the fact that he was dead.
Steve stared flatly at him, “Tony, you build your reputation on defying societal expectations of what an omega should and shouldn’t do. You’ve been waiting on a chance to scandalize those society magazines and giving them the middle finger with this double date.”
“Well no,” Steve sat down on his work desk, facing him, “I was expecting more resistance from you. This easy agreement is throwing me off, is all.” he said, “Tony, I don’t want you to just agree to go along with it. Ulysses’ upbringing will be our responsibility. Not just mine, but also yours. We get to decide how we want to raise him. I want him to know and have some knowledge of what the Church teaches and to also know science and how it explains how the world works. I don’t think they’re contradictory to each other, rather they complement them. If he could have a well-rounded view and knowledge the world like that, it would greatly benefit him.”
Releasing his hold of Steve’s face, Tony continued, “Sharon also said the reason I didn’t hear the gunshot was because I was cheating on you.” Steve shrugged, not really surprised that Sharon would tell Tony blatantly about him being unfaithful after her forceful implications at the crime scene earlier this morning. “Well, Bucky thinks that I’m the killer. And he’s helping me get away with it.”
When you love someone, you open yourself up to suffering. Because when you love someone, you will unconsciously attach your happiness to theirs. You will lose control of your own ability to attain your own happiness. But in being together, you also open up the possibility of creating something greater than yourself, or the other person. You have a chance to bring something to this world that embodies the best of you and him. And by being together, maybe it’s not just your happiness that depends on his. His happiness would also depend on yours. And together, you will be able to fill the empty and broken spaces in each other's heads, strengthening each other and giving courage to each other to move on, and finally see and embrace the life we have and the world we live in for what it is. A chaotic, messy place, riddled with pain, suffering, but, most importantly it is filled with hope.
“Steve, Steve, honey, come here.” he beckoned him. Steve wasted no time, crowding up the side of Tony’s hospital bed, enveloping them in his embrace. He scented his child, and felt Steve did the same, then felt a kiss pressed to his forehead. Steve’s eyes were closed, immersing himself in the combined scent of his child and his mate. At this moment, Steve felt complete. Every missing pieces he used to feel disappeared, leaving only the happiness and love he felt being with Tony and Ulysses.
Joe and Bucky looked pityingly at Tony as he talked. This was what Tony believed, it’s what he wanted to believe because the alternative was too painful to think about. Tony couldn’t think about how day after day he implored Steve to fall in love with him, for Steve to feel the same way and it was all for naught. He’d like to believe that somewhere deep inside him Steve remembered Tony, remembered all the feelings Tony elicited in him and returned all his affections and undying devotions. Thinking about the possibility that Steve might be humoring him would tore him apart.
Rhodey was ecstatic and immediately made his case to be the baby’s godfather. Or at the very least, the baby’s namesake if they turned out to be a boy. Tony pretended to hemmed and hawed over it in front of him, but behind closed doors he and Steve had already been talking about the possibility of giving the baby their best friend’s shared first name as the baby’s middle name.
“Yeah…” Steve whispered reverently, “you feel so good on my fingers, baby. So hot and slick, so eager for me.” Steve angled his fingers, looking for that spot he knew will bring Tony more pleasure. He found it and started insistently prodding it, Tony’s hole immediately started spasming and tightening at his fingers.
Peter’s older brothers were also remarkable in their own distinct ways. Like any other younger sibling in a family, Peter grew up idolizing his big brother. He grew up wanting to be just like his big brother Ulysses. Ulysses was the brave one. He was strong and charismatic, just like Papa. A natural born leader, some of his teachers would say, and Peter wanted to be just like him. Ulysses has an innate ability to inspire, to say the right words at the right time and to instill a sense of belonging, of having a higher purpose than your own selfish needs. Ulysses and Papa were just like two peas in a pod, in that they have always placed service above your own interests. They seemed happiest when they were doing something for other people.
“I still want to know about it, Tony. Anything and everything that concerned your and the boys’ well-being is never inconsequential to me,” Steve exhaled heavily and flopped on his back, “Promise me, from here on out, no matter how small of a matter it is, you tell me. I don’t care if you think it’s unimportant or inconsequential, I need to know. You, Tony, you and the boys, you’re my life. If one of you was hurt, I hurt too.”
Hearing his father’s voice, Ulysses turned his face from its hiding place and flashed a gummy grin at his father, reaching out to touch Steve’s nose with his pudgy fingers. Steve let his son patted his nose before moving the hand to his mouth so he could kiss that little palm.
“Please, you’re too busy stuffing your face with that bacon blue cheese sundae. You’re not gonna have enough brain power to summon the suit, much less throw me overboard.”
Anthony looked up at Steven with big brown eyes, gazing up at the bright blue eyes of the man who just saved his life and for the first time in Anthony’s life, elicited feelings of contentment and love from him. And he was the son of Zeus? Well, nobody could say that Anthony did anything by halves. He just proposed to a demigod, an actual demigod. They did exist! In the midst of his pondering, he felt Steven placed the hand he was holding to his chest. Underneath the chiton, he felt the thunderous beat of Steven’s heart under his hand. Steven wasn’t unaffected by Anthony’s proximity, that was a good thing.
“They overdosed you with the anesthetics to dig out all the bullets. You’ve been in a coma for four days.” Tony explains, feeling his vision clouded by the unshed tears in his eyes, “it took you so long to wake up. I thought you’d sleep for another seventy years.” Tony chuckles to lighten the mood. Steve is still staring at him uncomprehendingly, his blue eyes look confused.
Fury chuckled as he went through the evidence Sharon has compiled for them, “A mobster named Brock. What’s the world coming to?” Tony chuckled along with him, surprised at the small smile that Fury managed to coax out of Sharon as well.
“He’s still breathing. Still alive.” Clint whispered, face close to Steve’s nose and mouth, “Fucking superserum did what it’s supposed to do.”
“Will you do me the honor of being my mate, once again? For me to have and to hold, to cherish and to honor from now and until death do us part?”
“Yup,” Peter climbed onto one of the stools and pulled an empty bowl towards himself and started pouring cereal and milk into it. Peter glanced at one of Joe’s holographs and saw that his big brother made a mistake in his calculations, “
And that was that. Steve started living at the institute full time, teaching art to the other patients as a means to help them with their therapy. And if he spend a lot of time in the studio drawing, sketching, painting and sculpting the same subject again and again and again until his studio became a shrine devoted to that subject, it was nobody’s business but his.
Thor nodded, then he knelt down to inspect the door, “there’s nothing tacky on the bolt here. So it wasn’t taped. That means either the dead guy hid in the club after closing, or Tony let him in after my sweep.”
“Okay, Anthony.” Steven flashed him a shy smile, one that Anthony returned wholeheartedly. This man was so fascinating, the arrogance that was usually present in people as handsome as he was noticeably absent. It was exhilarating and refreshing for Anthony who had his fair share of arrogant beautiful people milling about around him. “I don’t mean to presume but I think I have a better plan to defeat this monster, and with your permission I’d like to slay him on your behalf.”
And so it was that Steve found himself that evening in Tony’s recovery room, a recovery room that was crowded and noisy that he had to apologize several times to the nurses who were on duty. Somehow, someone (Steve was pretty sure it was Clint) had smuggled in Tony’s favorite pastrami sandwich, which he was eating on the bed right now with Ulysses snuggled up in his lap. The boy refused to budge from his Babbo’s side ever since they were allowed to see him. Thor had brought sleeping bags and air mattresses, because apparently everyone intended to stay overnight with him and Tony. After Steve explained to them that no one but him was staying overnight, Thor shrugged and used the sleeping bags as carpets to spread out on the floor and now he, Sam, Bucky and Clint were playing poker on it. The air mattresses have been blown up to be makeshift couches for Natasha and Bruce to sit on.
“-- and with this fellowship hopefully we’ll get more kids to be interested in studying science and engineering, you know. Especially the girls, because I’m telling you Steve, there aren’t enough girls in the STEM field. And God knows we need more of them. They’re not there not because they’re incapable, or aren’t as good in math as the boys. That’s bullshit. They’re not there because nobody has been showing them they can be in tech. And that’s gonna be my latest project, bringing-” Tony abruptly cut himself off, realizing he had been monopolizing the conversation for some time now.
Okay, Steve thought,  note to self: get rid of oranges and don’t let Tony see Natasha drink boba tea.
Steve’s first instinct was to go to him, but another part of him called on him to go upstairs to see his baby boy first. Which was what he decided to do in the end, Tony would understand and JARVIS assured him that no one was harmed during whatever disagreement they had earlier.  “JARVIS, could you take me up to see Ulysses, please?”
“We can hear you, you know?” Jamie told them, pulling Joe close to him and started them on a trek to their homeroom class.
Tony’s boys sat on the couch. Peter was fidgeting, looking guilty as hell and still wearing his poor excuse of a superhero suit. Tony’s head hurt just looking at it. He was already thinking about the changes he will definitely make to it to make sure it was safer. Oh hell, he’s just gonna toss that one to the incinerator and made Peter a new one. Preferably one based off of the nanotech. Meanwhile Joe just looked annoyed, whether it was because he was getting a stern talking to or because Peter just outed him to him and Steve for having a boyfriend, Tony wasn’t sure.
“Hey, sweetheart,” Steve murmured, “time to wake up, unless you want a crick in your neck from sleeping here the whole night.”
“Joe was upset because of that? But that was three years ago. And we already broke up!” Jamie wondered out loud.
Peebee…” Joe knelt next to his brother’s unconscious body, eyes scanning him from head to toe to determine where the blood was coming from. He propped up Peter’s head to his lap, placing his fingers on Peter’s neck, trying to find a pulse.
Tony whimpered and pushed again, the hardest and longest push before he heard the squelching sound and Steve’s triumphant shout as he slowly pulled their baby boy out of Tony. Tony sighed in relief, but something was wrong. He didn’t hear a cry from the baby and his eyes opened in panic.
Though there are some things he still need to get used to, like the 45 mph speed limit on the freeway and the sporadic and spontaneous rains, he could safely say that he found a place to lay down his roots eventually. It also helped that Hawai’i has a very big potential to be the first state to be powered solely by the arc reactor. Due to its isolated location in the Pacific, relying on imported fossil fuel and coal, have not been sustainable. Right now, supplementing the energy need with solar power was the solution, but if Tony had his way (and he eventually would), the arc reactor would be able to supply the energy for the entire state of Hawai’i, from the Big Island to Ni’ihau, and become the first state in the Union to be powered entirely by renewable energy.
“Are you aware of a city councilman named Alexander Pierce?” Bucky asked their newest interviewee, one Phil Coulson, one of the bartenders at Sarah’s.
“I guess. It just feels...weird.” Steve murmured, “it’s going against all of my instincts to just sit here and not, you know, provide for you and the little guy.”
Tony lifted up his head to stare at Steve, “You seriously wanna risk a morning quickie after the disaster that was our anniversary three years ago?”
“Shut up, Tony.” she shot him down, “I’m talking about this.” she placed a napkin with the bar’s insignia on Tony’s desk. As Tony pulled the napkin closer to him for further inspection, he noticed it was the floor plan of the bar.
Ulysses and Peter who were sitting next to him at breakfast looked incredulously at him, eyes wide in fear. Their Papa never swore unless it was very much warranted. Steve tried to do the breathing exercises his therapist from the post-thawing days had taught him, but it was failing miserably to curb his temper at the shitshow that was their family vacation. “Fine. Fine, I’m coming to bail you out.”
But Tony took in stride, giving him space to think and vent and always, always let him know that Tony would be there if he needed to talk, or to simply just be there with Steve if he needed him. The truth was, on days like that, the only thing Tony needed to do was to simply exist and Steve would feel better.
“There doesn’t seem to be any problems with your reflexes. I surmised other than some light bruising to your person that can be resolved with ibuprofen, the damage to your pride was greater, yes?”
After they mated, Steve would always suit up for missions in Tony’s workshop. One part was because that’s where the his suit would be, after missions and after battles, for repairs and for Tony to add more improvements and changes to it. Another part, a larger part, was that Tony liked to see him suit up. According to Tony, it was second sexiest things he had ever seen in his life. The first was of course Steve taking off the suit, insert Tony’s dorky wink here.
Steve was silent at Tony’s question, though his hands never ceased its gentle massage of Tony’s back, “The truth. They deserve to know.”
“My love,” Steven whispered again in his ears and Anthony looked up to him. Golden brown orbs shining with joy and love and obvious joy. Steven would like to think that the happiness Anthony was feeling right now was because of Steven’s company and maybe because of flying, “We’re here.” He gestured towards the floating island in front of them and watched in obvious delight as Anthony’s eyes bugged out of skulls in astonishment and his jaw dropped as he caught sight of Delos.
“Oh for fuck’s sake,” Nick muttered to himself. He could feel a throb starting to build in the back of his head. These motherfuckers are gonna gave him an aneurysm by the end of the interviews.
“Two weeks now. Your torso and your groin has mostly finished regenerating. We’re waiting on your hand and your face now. It’s a slow process, but we’re getting there, honey. We just have to be patient.”
He tried again the next day. But before he could even suggest to Tony that they spend the day together at the beach, Peter ran up to them telling them Ulysses was fighting with another boy who was harassing Joe. They managed to separate them but not before Ulysses got a pretty amazing shiner on his left eye. They ended up spending the rest of the day at the Maui Memorial’s emergency room and Tony spending the rest of the day and night fawning over his eldest son and threatening to sue the other boy and his parents for punching Ulysses and having an omega-to-omega talk with Joe who was rightfully feeling some discomfort for being treated like less than human for his secondary gender. Steve had half a mind of finding that boy and tossing him straight into the ocean. Nobody messed with his baby.
“How could I ever forget about my little munchkins? And it’s not a goodbye forever, okay? I’ll be back by the time you’re finished with school this year and then we can go swim with the dolphins again, okay?” Tony said, kneeling to be at eye level with the kids.
A flash of light at his eye interrupted him from his musings. It was annoying, and Tony looked up trying to find the asshole who almost blind him by shining the sun directly in his eye. He turned, ready to give the asshole a piece of his mind, only to stop and and drop his pina colada on the sand.
Tony started to answer, before Steve amended the question, “Scratch that. JARVIS, when was the last time Tony slept?”
“Banner screamed when he saw the body. So he’s off the hook, right?” Thor Odinson, the bar’s doorman/bouncer, asked.
Before Joe could respond, the dreaded bell rang signaling the end of the lunch period. Reluctantly, they all packed up their stuff and started heading out to their next classes while Joe remained rooted to his seat, his food still untouched in front of him. He hurriedly snagged the apple and ate the raviolis in three huge bites, Jamie was standing next to him, seemingly waiting for him to finish eating. He remained there until Joe finished, then offered his hand to help Joe stand up from his chair. Getting that same offer from any other Alpha would have made Joe’s ire raise, but from Jamie, it felt natural, like second nature to place his hand in the Alpha’s larger one.
So it came as a huge surprise when he moved to Hawai’i and somehow made friends with people who were not paid to befriend him.
I know I skipped over the majority of IM1, but my aim was to look deeper into the events that made Tony turned his life around and the majority of that occurred during his captivity, that's why I spent most of the story with Tony as a captive.
“Maybe we’ll start with derivatives for Joey Bug over here.” Tony said, smiling at the two most important blondes in his life.
“Oh my God,” Steve blurted out loud. Tony whipped his head around and jumped from his chair when he became aware of Steve’s presence and voice, “Tony, are you-- is that what I think it is?”
As he hold Tony back in his arms, Steve felt the shackles around his heart loosened and he could breathe again. He inhaled Tony’s cent deeply, immersing himself in that beloved scent. He felt Tony wound his arms around him too, squeezing tightly and pulling himself closer to Steve. As if trying to merge their bodies into one. In this moment, Steve thought they would eventually be okay.
” Joe stepped into the room, and sat gingerly down beside his little brother’s curled up form on the bed, “
“To be clear, I’m not saying you can’t expand or add new things. I’m very interested in finally applying the artificial intelligence system you developed at MIT to our pipeline.” Obie must have seen Tony’s crestfallen expression. He put down his unlit cigar on the ashtray and stood up from behind his desk to come around to where Tony was sitting, placing his big hand on Tony’s shoulder, “Tell you what, how’s about you work on the arc reactor. It’s been years and nobody I hire could bump up the efficiency to more than 25%. Would that be something you’re interested in? A science project of some sort.”
Steve moved on to the kitchen, grabbing a banana from the fruit bowl and rummaging through the refrigerator to grab a gatorade, guzzling it down in one go. Steve decided to get started on some lunch. He’s not sure who was still in the tower after breakfast this morning, but at the very least he knew Tony, Ulysses, Joe, and Thor too it seemed were still at the tower. Their newborn son, Joe, was finally home after a two week stay at the NICU. Both him and Tony were still on edge, keeping an eye out for everything and anything that could be strange with their new son. But so far, everything seemed to be progressing very well. The only peculiar thing about Joe was his amazing ability to sleep through the night, something that not even Ulysses did as a baby.
, what was the first law of thermodynamics again?” Tony asked Ulysses. He had been teaching Ulysses thermodynamics for the past week ever since discovering that Ulysses easily mastered the calculus and physics problems Tony and Bruce mock up for him. In an effort to keep the boy from getting bored, Tony thought maybe some classical thermodynamics, something simple that would keep him entertained.
“That was my bad, actually. I thought it was the easiest way to introduce him to math. Oops.” Tony grinned sheepishly. “They’re not actually betting on anything, okay. No reward system, just Uncle Hawky congratulating him for scoring twenty-one.”
“We have a lot to talk about, don’t we?” Anthony conceded. Steven didn’t say ‘no’, just ‘not yet’, and Anthony was nothing if not persuasive. And getting to know each other sounded like something fun.
for the twelfth(?) time in his life, it became clear what to him what he and Tony should name their child.
Without thinking twice, Steve leapt from his seat, rushing to his second born’s aide, Peter running behind him. Joe was coughing furiously in his seat, his face red and there was swelling around his lips.
“Yeah, that’s what usually happens in prison, Brucie.” Tony smiled slightly at Bruce’s words. The man seemed to take no issue that he went to prison, but was more concerned about his missing shoes, “we’ll buy more for you.”
“Except, except! It’s super not safe, Steve, plum pudding, light of my life. We wouldn’t wanna go through the whole Hulk-creating radiation shebang thing now, would we?”
“Steve, Steve! Sssh, darling. It’s okay, it’s okay. You’re alright, Steve. I’m here, I’m here with you, beloved.”
Steve’s voice seemed to jolt him out of his reverie. Rhodey started sputtering, “Wha-- Godfather? Me? Are you sure?”
Unlike other school children who went to DC as part of the school trip, his unusual childhood and schooling ensured that Tony never got to have that experience. When children his age get to have fun on school trips, Tony was already shipped to boarding school, trying and failing to make friends with peers that shunned him for his intelligence and looked down on his gender. On the occasions that he visited DC for Senate testimonies and that one time he and Rhodey got honored by Senator Assclown, he didn’t find the time to take in the many monuments gracing DC’s facade. Might be hard to believe for an American, but this was the first time he stepped foot in one of the Nation’s most revered dedication sites. The Lincoln Memorial was spacious inside and built in the Greek doric temple style. In the evening, the yellow light illuminating Lincoln’s statue in the main chamber added to the gravity and majesty of it, making the figure more imposing and lifelike. Murals were painted on the adjoining chambers that were separated from the main chamber by Ionic columns. In the north chamber, Tony saw a carved inscription of Lincoln’s second inaugural address, and in the south chamber the Gettysburg address was carved in to the marble wall.
“Or girl.” Tony added. They smiled again at each other. Steve pulled Tony closer, pressing their foreheads together to revel in their combined scents, that now included the scent of their child. A new life they created together. And Steve was eager to start this new chapter in their lives together. With the presence of this child, a new person that embodied the best of him and Tony, their family was finally complete.
Dr. Rosenberg stopped by for house calls frequently too. And after he was sworn to secrecy to not disclose JARVIS’ existence to anyone in his field, he was given access to work with JARVIS to monitor Tony’s health. It was on one such visit that Dr. Rosenberg, with JARVIS’ help, told them the news they had been waiting for.
Also, shout out to the one person who subscribed to me! I have more stories planned but it might be awhile before I can complete and publish it, since I'm trying to publish a paper for my research. But stick with me, babes! I will come through for you.
“Steve, I didn’t know you ordered food. But I think we’d need more. Let me just call up room service for more. What do you want, Big Guy? The usual everything on the menu?”
“All my life.” Tony said, “I’ve been dreaming about you all my life. But I never know for sure until two years ago.”
“What.” Steve deadpanned. His enhanced hearing zeroed in on the words that just came out of Tony’s mouth and blocking out the rest of the word vomit coming out of Tony. Pregnant. Pregnant.
“Oh, I think that’s my son,” Nice Blond Lady said excitedly, “Sweetheart, sweetheart over here!” she called out. Moments later, the owner of said voice bounded in to the alleyway where they were standing. Peter absently noted that the thick brown hair and the handsome face looked familiar, but then again the guy did have one of those ridiculously proportional faces you would see on TV. But hey, those purple eyes were something you didn’t see everywhere. In fact, only one person Peter knew had eyes like that. And it was...
“Spam and Reese’s,” a voice Tony never expect to ever heard again his life answered for him, “Sue and Nick sent their best.”
“What about ten years from now, Buck? Twenty? Don’t you wanna have a life that doesn’t revolve around taking care of me? I’m not gonna do that to you and Dad, Buck. You deserve to live a full life. And I deserve to decide what I want to do with mine.”
As they talked with each other, that night’s entertainment arrive for a sound check. It was a local band that called themselves the Wrecking Crew. They were a rowdy bunch, harkening back to the rock n roll days of excessive drugs and alcohol use, but Tony liked their music. They had been busy touring for the better part of the year, and Steve had managed to convince them to come back home to Brooklyn for a while to play at the bar for one night before they went back on the road again.
“Spaghetti, Uncle Joe.” his face seemed to have more color today and he wasn’t being curt. Joe thought it must be good day then.
“That’s as good as it’s gonna get.” Steve conceded, and with one last glance at Joe’s slumbering form he walked towards the Quinjet. Natasha and Clint were hugging Ulysses, promising him to bring back souvenirs too. Ulysses ran back to stand with Bucky and Tony, while the Quinjet prepared for take off.
By the time Tony sent the fabrication command to JARVIS and Steve and Bruce cooked all of the bacon, Clint and Thor managed to drag themselves out of their quarters and joined the rest of them for breakfast.
“Well, that’s that.” Tony said, staring at the slowly burning fire eating away at his presence in Steve’s life. It’s cruel of Steve, Tony thought. It’s cruel how easy it was for Steve to erase any trace of Tony’s existence from his life, while Tony wouldn’t be able erase even the scent of Steve from his nostrils. Steve would wake up tomorrow and everything would be fine in his life, but Tony would have to go on living like there was no Steve-shaped gaping hole on his person.
are the ones who are proud and so grateful to be fortunate enough to be parents to three amazing young men like you all.”
“I didn’t catch him. But I appreciate your loyalty.” Steve answered firmly, though inside he was still reeling at the realization that Thor thought he murdered the guy and was willing to cover it up for him.
“Well, you probably thought I couldn’t live up to the hype. But joke’s on you, it’s the hype that couldn’t live up to me.” Tony joked.
“Soon.” he whispered back, then urged Groot to take to the sky and whisk them away from the beach and the carcass of the monster that Steven slayed in Anthony’s name.
Steve ended up drinking with them for a bit, after Sam told him he had to try a new way to drink Guinness by adding a shot of Baileys to his beer. It was actually pretty good and he ended up demolishing a whole six pack by himself. Tony kept making moon eyes at his drink, but Steve steered him clear by refilling his champagne glass with more orange juice so he didn’t feel left out. The “party” petered out after awhile. Clint ended up laying down on the floor (I’m just taking a break, Tasha) and Sam left for his floor to sober up and go to another party thrown by a buddy of his from the Air Force.
Meanwhile, Joe rewrapped The Sixth Sense DVD and placed in the place where Steve would have hidden it as a birthday present. Then he went to the shed and retrieved the newest copy of the Honolulu Star, dated October 13th of last year and placed it on the front porch for Steve to retrieve the next morning. Then, he and Bucky would head to the workshop and took a picture of the mural depicting Brooklyn that Steve had painted earlier in the day and together they repainted the walls white for Steve to paint it again tomorrow.
“For the average folks, they just have to go to the nearest plaza or Disneyland, Sir. But for you, I suspect nothing short of a trip to Mars would suffice to escape the dodging of the paparazzis.”
“I’m sure they’re fine, honey.” Tony rubbed his free hand on Steve’s bicep in an attempt to calm and comfort his mate.
“Not at all,” Jamie hefted his little brother up like he weighed nothing, carrying him in a bridal carry towards the car. The casual show of Jamie’s strength temporarily distracted Joe from the urgency of the situation, namely Peter being wounded, and emphasized just how far he had fallen for Jamie.
Bucky reached into his suit pocket to retrieve a sheaf of paper and placed it on the table between them, “He met with Killian over a dozen times. Over seventy phone calls in the past three weeks. How many times a day you talk to him?”
“Sure.” Steve agreed, “from the stories Ma would tell, he sounded like a hero. He wanted to serve his country. It was hard for Irish people back then, you know. It’s hard for him to get a job on account of being Irish, so he saw the army as a way to proof to society that he was more than a drunken Irish. Ma always said that Da had no patience for intolerant people and bigots. Ma said he once got in a fight with a diner owner who refused to serve Black customers. Needless to say both he and the people he stood up for was thrown out and banned from that diner for life.”
“Hey, you remembered when he was a baby and Steve was so into bonding and he wanted to do skin-on-skin contact with him, and Ulysses shit all over him?”
“Here you are.” Tony echoed his words and looked back lovingly towards Steven, so strong and handsome, his chest forming a buffer that protected Anthony from the strong winds blowing  around and through them as they flew higher from the ground. It was hard to imagine a time when he was so sick that he was at Death’s door. “Suppose I should thank this Olympian sibling of yours for preserving your life so I can meet you.”
Steve laughed, the most amazing sound Tony ever heard in his life. Steve seemed to laugh with his whole body. His right hand seemed to unconsciously went to his left pectoral as he continued to laugh. Tony imagined a day when he finally get to touch said pectoral himself.
Sam let them go, but not without a look that promised Steve better come talk to him, if he needed to later.
“Nobody could have blamed you for wanting an end to such a life, Anthony. How you found the courage to stay in the face of such adversity, such burden is commendable. I would ask, though, do you still wish such a thing? To be a way from it all?”
“Come on. Hurry up. Just click it. Don't change any settings.” the young man urged his fellow soldier, but before the picture could be taken, an explosion rocked the vehicle and they watched in horror as the vehicle in front of them was blows up. After that it was pure chaos. Gunshots were heard from every corner, everybody was panicking and the soldiers escorting Tony was in full combat mode.
Which didn’t explain why fifteen minutes later, he was playing the CD on blast, chugging champagne straight from the bottle, singing and crying to Wouldn’t it be nice.
“Because you have to understand that there is no future with me!” Steve shouted at Tony’s retreating back. “Don’t you wanna have a family, marriage and children?”
“Yeah, cheer up, Uly!” Peter jumped on his back, much to Ulysses’ surprise, the boy wrapped his legs around Ulysses’ waist and the older boy stood up from his seat to adjust Peter’s position on his back. “Amy was boring anyway, she didn’t like my potato gun.”
“Whatever you say, punk.” he reached for Ulysses’ picture and stared at the endearing visage of Steve’s son, “he’s cute. Look a lot like you when you were skinny.”
“With great power comes great responsibility,” Joe smiled sadly, repeating what Peter once told him as his reason for going out to patrol the neighborhood.
“Steve, I-- I need you to understand that I’m not Natasha. Not fully, at least. I-- ugh, how do I explain this?” Tony rubbed his face, Steve patiently waiting him out as he gathered his thoughts, “I have her memories, everything that happened before. Everything with you. But I-- my feelings are my own. I love you on my own terms. I love you as Tony, but, but also as Natasha. Does that make sense?”
“What would be the point in telling you? It would have put your life in danger, darling.” Tony answered smoothly. His beautiful brown eyes were hidden behind a pair of wayfarers. He was wearing a horrendously bright orange Aloha shirt and a pair of shorts. “Corporate spies are after me, sweetheart. I have to go into hiding to protect my techs,”
“Whatever you say,” Joe patted his cheek affectionately and they went back to staring at each other like lovelorn idiots.
” Tony cooed at him, prompting Joe to squeal and bang his plastic spoon on the table. His bright smile reminded Tony so much of Steve. The blue eyes and the wispy blond hair were the least of their similarities. His nose was just like Steve’s, unlike Ulysses’ nose which was all Tony’s. The shape of his eyes and that jawline would someday be as sharp and regal as Steve’s. Ulysses would look like a brown haired Steve, but Joe would look like a mini Steve. Tony couldn’t wait.
“I’m afraid your bar will remain closed for the foreseeable future, Mr. Stark,” Sharon informed the man as they walked out of the archive room towards her office.
“...don’t know what I did wrong, Steve,” Tony heard Thor said, “it was an honest mistake. I didn’t know she can’t even eat honey. I thought being vegan meant she can’t eat meat. Turns out it’s a whole thing about not eating animals and anything produced by animals. What kind of lifestyle is that? It sounds like the most depressing thing in the Universe.”
“When you can be proud of me. I mean, I’m just Peter, the baby of the family. There’s nothing special about me. I’m not popular or inspiring and charismatic like Uly,” Ulysses’ face fell at Peter’s words, “Or smart and pretty like Joe,” Joe looked at his little brother, crestfallen that his little brother ever felt inadequate about himself, “They will be the ones to carry on yours and Papa’s legacies, SI and all the charity and political advocacy stuff, so I’m just trying to find my niche. And-- and being Spiderman lets me do that. I can carry on the superhero part of your legacies. I can make you proud too,” Peter finished gently from the crook of Tony’s arms. Babbo’s arms tightened around him and he felt the warm press of Babbo’s lips on his forehead.
“Steve…” Tony gasped out again. His Steve, his mate looked half dead. He wasn’t responding to any outside stimuli. God knew how long he’d been like that, his insides unprotected from the elements, how much pain he was suffering right now. Tony had to be with him. If he had to break protocol and barge in through the operating room door, he would.
Steve’s brow furrowed in consternation. Rarely did anyone call Tony on his personal line, unless that person was Pepper, Rhodey, Happy and a select few SI employees. “Who is it, JARVIS?” he asked.
Just as he slipped his jacket on and pocketed the keycard, the front door opened. Steve became alert, body stiffening up in defense at the perceived threat. Then, Tony’s scent hit him and Steve felt his body relax with relief. His elation morphed to dejection when he saw Tony’s slumped shoulder and defeated posture. Tony looked defeated, eyes red rimmed with unshed tears. Steve ached to go to him and hold him close. Even in the beginning when they were at odds with each other, when Tony was at his most powerful encased in a titanium-gold alloy suit, Steve’s protective instinct flared the strongest around him. He didn’t used to feel this way about Peggy, only admiration and awe. With Tony, those feelings were amplified. Admiration, awe, love, affection, and protectiveness. He should have realized it was his body’s way of telling him that he had found his intended mate. The right partner.
“Oh Steve, I...” he whispered. Tony’s eyes slowly refocused. His hands clutched at Steve’s arm with a fierceness incomparable.
“Power down!” Tony shouted. The suit powered down, its trademark blue light going black and Tony hurried to his side, knocking the suit away from Steve. Steve sat up gingerly, rubbing his throat to ease the bruising left by the armor’s grip, though undoubtedly the serum was already working to heal him by now.
Steve shot him with his “Captain America disapproves of your life choices” look. He was holding Joe to his chest. The boy was fascinated by the lack of hair on his father’s head. The rough bristles of Steve’s growing hair was scratchy when he would run his fingers through it and the boy seemed determined to keep running his finger over it. Currently, he was repeatedly patting Steve’s head and giggling when the short hairs scratched his fingers and drooling on Steve’s head.
“Tony,” Steve admonished, but the smile on his face showed his amusement, “Well seeing as how I was the winner, how’s about you present yourself to me then?” Steve challenged him, Bucky groaning and muttering in the background about how Steve was a horny bastard. Tony smirked back at him, eyes smoldering promising a good time to be had between them later on in the night.
“Christ…” Sam exhaled out. Steve decided he would forgive the blasphemy this time, he had bigger things to worry about.
” Joe responded indulgently, he was taking his sweet ass time drinking said milk. Clearly he was determined to troll Peter this morning.
It was ten weeks into the pregnancy when Tony started to feel something different from his other pregnancies. That morning he woke up with a throbbing sensation in his pelvis that just wouldn’t go away. Deciding not to alarm Steve, Tony decided to push that feeling aside and disregard it as phantom pains.
“Legally, if it’s with my stuff, can I just claim it as my own and toss it in a volcano?” Jarvis asked him.
Dr. Rosenberg left with a warm smile on his face and a promise to send a nurse to them carrying the new medication that Tony was now required to take for the remainder of his pregnancy.
Bruce came back a few minutes later, brandishing the wallet he thought he lost and thanking Steve for watching over his daughter. Joe and Peter came back with a bag of food, between them and sat next to Natasha who was reading a Vogue magazine. A few seats away, Thor was engaged in a rather heated debate with a teenage girl, trying to convince her that Harry Styles was the Justin Timberlake of One Direction, but the girl wasn’t buying it, insisting that it was Zayn instead and that Harry was the JC Chasez. It was only slightly ridiculous than the other debates Thor usually get himself into (re: the waffle fry v. french fry debate with Ulysses).
“I’d feel it if the energy was bad between the two of us.” Steve lifted up Tony’s hands, kissing the knuckles, “I’d know. The same way that you would know I couldn’t murder someone.”
“Something’s wrong.” Tony rasped out. He opened his mouth to say more, to tell Steve that his head hurt and his heart was racing, but then darkness surrounded him and the only thing he was aware of before succumbing to consciousness was Steve’s panicked face and his voice desperately calling out his name.
“I'm a piping hot mess. It's been going on for a while, I haven't said anything.” Tony whispered, encouraged by the soft caresses from Steve on his cheekbones, “Nothing’s been the same since New York.”
“Deal on everything but naming the baby part.” Tony countered. Naming the child would always be his and Steve’s prerogatives no matter how much he loved their weird ass family.
The Avengers took the news of his pregnancy complication like it was a threat that needed to be vanquished. Bruce, along with JARVIS, took up the mantle of Tony’s personal round the clock in-house physician, doing everything he could to make sure that Tony and baby were doing fine. The rest of the Avengers were on Tony sitting duty, ensuring he took his medicine and remained on bedrest for the remainder of his pregnancy.
The officer took one look at Bucky’s drivers license and shot them an incredulous look, “Are you kidding me?”
“They just finished cleaning the down twenty minutes ago. Starting on the skin grafts now.” Bucky chimed in. “God, Stevie, what have you gotten yourself into that you need skin grafts? This is even worse than the time he picked a fight with a Klan member and got his jaw fucked up.” he shook his head in dismay.
make a time machine. It’s just a matter of ethics and not messing around with space-time continuum that stopped me from doing it,” Steve chuckled, “That and I’m too selfish for your own good. You’re mine now and I’m not letting you go.”
“That’s what Tony said too. He found a picture of me from basic training, before the serum, and had it framed and placed in his workshop.” Steve shook his head at his mate’s antics.
“Obviously you’ve given this a lot of thought,” Aaron deadpanned. He looked unimpressed at Jamie’s explanation.
Steve came to sit down next to Tony, a napkin in his hand to wipe Ulysses’ face, who was sitting up on Clint’s lap bouncing up and down, his happy squeals amusing everyone.
Natasha’s small, almost imperceptible, smile told him that he said what she needed to hear. “Go on and get in the ring, Aunt Tasha. Someone needs to be the voice of reason when that kid grows up.” Tony nudged her to where the others were standing around Steve who still had Ulysses in his arms. She left her perch on Tony’s bedside and joined the others as they cooed over Ulysses. Tony leaned back on his hospital bed, tired out but relieved and happy to know that Ulysses would have so many people loving him and watching over him, if he and Steve were to perish. His son would never be alone. He would never feel coldness and emptiness that Tony often feel growing up by himself.
“I’m sorry, darling.” Steve reached out to him, pulling Tony in for a warm embrace, “I was too caught up in helping Bucky that I wasn’t here for you and Ulysses. Forgive me.”
She continued on her way to the kitchen, and Tony continued to surreptitiously spied on Steve. He seemed to be on the verge of completing his waffle house, but was having trouble with the last piece that would be the door. Seeing an obvious solution to the construction problem, Tony took a chance and impulsively pick up a toothpick and approached Steve.
“I’m mad because I don’t find it hard to believe at all. Alright? Did Pierce give you the napkin?” Steve countered.
Steve kissed him again, heart bursting with happiness and anticipation. Since the beginning, he wished to have another little boy, one that looked like Tony, a mini-Tony for him to spoil and to love to his heart’s content. This time he might finally have his wish granted.
“I love you so much, baby boy. So much,” Steve whispered to him in the dark. He reached down to stroke the downy brown hair on the boy’s head, so much like Tony’s, and kissed his forehead. Ulysses shifted a little in his sleep and settled back down.
Anthony looked pensive for a moment. Steven might have only known him for a short time, but he was starting to learn what the different expressions on Anthony’s face was. This one, the spaced out, faraway, introspective look, meant that he was analyzing the situation and would soon have an epiphany, “When you think about everything that has to occur, exactly the way it was supposed to occur and at the exact moment to lead to our encounter, do you still think this is a coincidence, my love?”
The rest of the reporting from the news was lost, swallowed by the deafening sound of breaking glass that jolted Clint from his light nap. The spy was now awake and alert, searching for the source of the sound. In his mind, he prepared for the possibility that the Tower has been invaded, however nothing seemed out of place as he surveyed his surroundings. The television is still playing the morning news, his empty cereal bowl was still on the coffee table so he hadn’t accidentally kicked it in his sleep and no AIM or HYDRA agent was abseiling through the ceiling.
“You got one. Without me,” Steve remarked disappointingly. His father looked down at the pineapple in his hand.
Everyone in the room looked alarmingly in his direction. Steve looked shocked, his grip on his beer glass loosening. Natasha was blinking silently, processing what happened. Bruce seemed to be the only one alert and was moving to grab his cellphone.
“My stomach...hurts…” Tony slurred out. He looked down at the floor and saw that there was a trickle of blood coming out of his pants. “Oh no…”
I have finished writing up the main chapters of this story just need to write the epilogue. I'm thinking of writing another story that is another movie AU. Would you guys be interested in reading that? Drop me a comment below to let me know!
Clint watched from his station behind the bar, in shock as Bruce and Jarvis were both lead out of the bar in handcuffs by Detective Carter. Jarvis looked pleadingly at him, as if beseeching him to bust him out right then and there. Loki walked placidly back to the bar, watching the same thing Clint was witnessing yet seemed unaffected by the whole thing.
“I heard Falcon shouting from all the way back from the coat check. He was pissed, lemme tell you.” Clint told them.
“Well, she ain’t here, is she? This time I’ll win. What do you say, little James? You wanna learn how to lie and cheat?”
Once the couple were out of earshot, Bucky turned despairingly at his partner, “Is that really wise? Implying that Tony was cheating on Steve when Steve was standing next to him?”
“This new look of yours,” Natasha explained, “makes us realize just how much you and Johnny Storm look alike.”
Anthony scoffed,“Oh please, I’m a prodigy. I’m not going to be dumb enough to let someone like you go.” His words brought a flush to Steven’s cheeks. He was unprepared to hear how well Anthony’s opinion of him was, “Is this your way of saying that you’re not interested? Just tell me, Steven. I wouldn’t be upset. Much.” Anthony crossed his arms in front of his chest, looking for all the world like an upset, petulant child. Steven just wanted to cuddle up with him and tell him jokes and funny stories until he smiled and laughed again.
“Cheers. Um, I need to talk.” he said to Steve and Tony, signaling them to follow him to where they store the speakers.
“This was fried in peanut oil,” Steve threw the box to the floor, away from his son. Natasha shoved the Epipen in his hands and he opened the pen and jabbed the needle on to Joe’s thigh. Joe gasped out in pain at the shot of epinephrine to his system. Steve hugged him close to his chest, comforting the boy by rubbing his hand up and down his back and murmuring endearments and reassurance.
“DUM-E, guess who’s a genius? Daddy’s a genius!” he laughed cheerfully. DUM-E whirred exuberantly, joining in the moment with his creator. Tony chuckled at the bot’s antics, then turned back to the the desk in front of him. He kept a smaller copy of Aunt Natasha’s picture, framed on his desk as a source of inspiration, and a photo of his mom side by side. In his moments of frustration or when he reached a dead end with his codes or experiments he liked to look at her picture and thought to himself: What would Natasha do? It was like reaching deep into himself, reviving the dormant parts of himself that was able to see all the possibilities that the numbers and equations offered. It worked well so far. That’s how DUM-E was born, how JARVIS would be able to go online soon and how he improved the arc reactor technology.
“It’s like the terrible twos started already…” Sam muttered, but the smile on his face and everyone’s face belied his words.
Anthony broke off the kiss, panting softly against Steven’s lips, smiling with such pure, unadulterated happiness shining from his eyes. Steven enveloped his prince completely in his arms, moving his hands to caress Anthony’s hair and to feel the lean muscles on his back. The sweetness of his breath and the clean scent of his body washed over Steven’s entire being, lighting up every one of his enhanced senses. Anthony became the whole focus of his entire being, his whole world and they just met this afternoon. Steven didn’t know how it was possible to feel such a connection to someone, and to know that he would be the only one for Steven and vice versa, and Steven was just about to tell him so when an unwelcome voice burst through their bubble.
“Uh yeah. I live over in Kahala now.” Tony said, tilting his head curiously because the news of his relocation from the mainland made headline news awhile back.
For standing in front of Anthony, as he made a fool of himself straining for a thin metal strip in the sand while chained to damned rock, was a perfect specimen of a human being. He was blonde haired and had eyes as blue as the sky. He was tall, taller than Anthony, and built handsomely with strong arms and legs. His face was a work of art to say the least, with a sharp jawline that looked like it was carved from marble by Apollo himself along with his patrician nose and eyebrow. The dark blue chiton and silver brooch he was wearing complemented his alabaster skin well, bringing out the blues of his eyes and accentuating an ethereal glow about his person. He looked like every single one of Anthony’s dreams personified.
“Oh no, I just got an alert the spies are coming to kill me. Bye Shirley!” Tony exclaimed, running to catch up to the Jet Ski before he passed the boardwalk he was on.
“Papa, Papa, Papa! Where did your hair went, Papa? Will it ever come back?” he excitedly asked Steve, climbing on the couch to nestled in close to Steve. Ever since the accident, both boys have taken to clinging to Steve, following him wherever he went in the Tower. Ulysses and Joe have been sleeping in their beds for the last two months now, afraid that if they took their eyes off their Papa for a second, he would disappear. They wouldn’t let up even after Tony and Steve told him it was never going to happen.
,” Thor rumbled in perfect Italian, his Allspeak enabled him to speak and comprehend any and all languages available, “
Joe rolled his eyes in fond exasperation, “Fine, be that way. Peter’s just going to tell me later anyway. That kid can’t keep a secret to save his life.”
But oranges were out. Meatballs were out, much to Tony’s disappointment. Watermelons were purged with extreme prejudice from the tower. Natasha couldn’t drink her beloved boba milk teas in front of Tony anymore now. He couldn’t do chemistry with Bruce because a part of the distillation apparatus was spherical. And sometimes when the perspective and lighting were just right, Tony couldn’t even look at Sam or Rhodey’s shaved head on account of it resembling a sphere too much.
Tony decided to do some paperwork as the day progressed. He had planned to catch up on some of the more boring aspect of running a business last night, but something that completely blindsided him came up and he didn’t end up touching any of it. As he settled in his seat and picked up the paperwork on the top of the pile, his door opened up and Natasha strode in confidently.
‘We’ve been over this, Nat.” Tony sighed, “It’s just easier on both parties if all we had was just some no-strings-attached fun. No fuss, no muss.” Tony got up and went over to where a prototype of the newest version of a dialysis machine that will revolutionize renal disease treatment was located. If he had to have this conversation again, might as well do it with his hands occupied with something.
“What do we need to do now? Does Tony need to take medications? How-- how is this going to impact the baby?” Steve asked again. Tony felt numb and out of sorts at the diagnosis. He couldn’t believe this was happening.
They drove back to the Avengers Tower in silence, and by some miracle, there was no one at home. Papa was at the upstate facility along with his uncles and Aunt Natasha, while Babbo was having a Board of Directors meeting with Aunt Pepper, Uncle Happy was with them, ostensibly guarding them but was probably watching a soap opera on his StarkPad while they were having the meeting. Uncle Bruce and Uncle Thor were away at New Asgard, taking Aurora with them to visit her father’s homeland.
“Funny, I thought you would say that it was you, Tony Stark, that was the best thing that ever happened to me.” Steve donned his body armor over the undersuit, a lightweight fabric that allows for efficient body heat exchange and cooling.
Ulysses giggled in response at his uncle, reaching out with his pudgy fingers for Clint. “Yes, he did and apparently now is drooling his way down my back.” Tony answered for him.
Tony blamed Clint for this. First was Guitar Hero, now this. By now, The Avengers were basically just a bunch of overgrown teenage boys. And one badass girl who ruled over them all. These are the people tasked with protecting Earth from alien invasions. How reassuring. “This is very upsetting, you guys!”
The words spilled out of Tony’s mouth. It felt like he was the one saying it, but the voice he heard was not his own. It was a woman’s voice.
“Whatever helps you sleep at night, Thor.” Steve responded glibly, settling down on the couch with Tony in his arms. Tony readily nuzzled his face into Steve’s neck, eyes closing blissfully as he rested in his mate’s arms.
Tony dropped the kids off to school while Steve went for a meeting downtown with a gallery owner who wanted to feature some of Steve’s works in their newest showing. He arrived back home around noon, just in time with Steve. They decided to go out for lunch at Steve’s favorite diner, taking one of the convertibles because it was a nice day outside.
“You got it, brah.” Jet Ski guy grinned, seemingly mollified by the promise of money, but not before recognizing him, “Hey, aren’t you Tony Stark?”
“I--yes, thank you,” Joe started to dig in to his food, Jamie following suit. Around them the amicable sounds of Peter, Ned and Aaron chatting filled the air around them. Joe could almost believe that this was a regular occurence and not an anomaly. “So what brings you here? I mean, why the sudden change in lunch tables, I thought you have a standing reservation at the jock’s table with the football players and the cheerleaders.”
“Tony,” Steve shot him a look of annoyance, and Tony placated him by pressing a light kiss to the corner of his lips. “What are you guys talking about?”
“Thank you, Tony.” Steve kissed him gently. “Now, I have to tell Buck that he has to be ready for a baptism. Should be fun explaining to him that everything is now in English.”
Anthony felt his eyes bulged out of his skull at the mention of the Gorgon Medusa. Like everyone else, he knew of her and what she was capable of. He knew that no one had ever survive an encounter with the monster since they would be petrified the moment they gazed into her eyes, and yet Steven, Steven managed to kill her. Just how strong was this man? Anthony was in awe of Steven’s courage, “You slayed the Gorgon Medusa?”
“Oh, I gotta go. Sorry, Tony,” Steve looked at his watch, noting that his breakfast with Tony took up almost his entire morning. Thank God it’s Saturday.
“Your Uncles Sam, Clint and Bucky are all in jail because they went to an illegal gambling ring last night and got busted by the cops.” Steve threw his phone to the table. Seriously, what the fuck? Only those three could find an illegal gambling ring and got busted at the same night.
“Steve, what was your father like?” he whispered his question to Steve. They laid in bed together, Tony on his side facing Steve with Steve’s arms around him as he gently rubbed Tony’s lower back. The growing bump that was their second son nestled protectively between them. If Steve closed his eyes and focused, he thought he could feel their baby boy moving against his stomach.
Tony and Steve surreptitiously glanced at each other, wincing at the utter disaster that was Thor trying to make a conversation with his girlfriend. Steve finished peeling one of the shrimps on his plate and gave it back with Tony, prompting Tony to shoot him a grateful smile, “Thanks, babe.”
“You’re not supposed to know,” Peter whined, “nobody was supposed to know.” he paced back and forth in the empty classroom, muttering to himself, “Uly and Joe are gonna kill me. It’s bad enough that they worry every night when I go patrol the city but to have you, a civilian, know my secret identity is just bad to the power of infinity.”
Steve clearly didn’t buy his excuse from the way he looked at him as Tony tried to avoid his gaze. “What you did to Coulson, or tried to do,” he started, “I’ve seen it before.”
“I can’t believe you just quoted Frozen.” Clint said. He sounded annoyed, but the mirth in his eyes were back, so Tony counted that as a win.
“What else is there to say, Steve?” Tony sighed, “we knew the risk going in. I guess I was just too optimistic because it was smooth sailing with Ulysses. Age isn’t just a number after all, huh?” Tony chuckled deprecatingly.
“What about this?” Bucky knelt, poking a matchbook at the feet of the victim, “D’Angelo’s. Ever heard of this place?”
At the reminder of his previously heroic deed, Steven blushed and hurriedly nodded at Anthony’s request. “Right, we should leave. This is no place to be in.” Steven started to guide Anthony towards where Groot was patiently standing on the beach, pawing the sands with his hooves and looking very interested at the way the sand would give way to his hooves anytime he stomped down.
You know how before you did something inadvisable and dangerous in your youth, it would always start with the words “I’m going to regret this later”, insert self-deprecating laughter here. Nobody actually regretted doing whatever it was that they were about to do, so for the longest time Tony wondered what was the point in saying it in the first place.
One of the concierge, the one Tony remembered greeted Steve on their last visit here, interjected, “Dude he forgot his name. It’s okay, Sir. Go on up. And good luck with your memory problem.”
“Tony, relax,” Steve told him, lifting Tony’s hand to his and kiss his knuckles, and Tony just melted at the sweetness of the gesture, “the kids are fine. I know behind all those bluster and snarks about Clint, you trust him with the boys. He’s a good uncle for them. Now, we have the whole day, just the two of us. Do you really want to spend the whole day worrying and fretting?”
Steve broke their kiss much to Tony’s dismay and Tony whined to express his dissatisfaction. “Steve--”
Steve sighed and stepped further into the room, noting the plethora of Iron Man suits of different paints and designs in the platforms surrounding Tony’s workshop and garage, suits that didn’t exist before Steve left on his mission ten days ago, “Tony, you know this isn’t healthy. When was the last time you sleep?”
Next, he turned his attention to the arc reactor project. Truthfully it’s been awhile since he was able to buckled down and really work on a solution for the melting core problems. His brief conversation with Bucky this morning sparked an Einstein a-ha moment that he now would like to test. With JARVIS’ help, he set out to create a simulation using the holographics deck of the current input, projected outputs and the efficiency of the current palladium core of the existing arc reactors. As always, when he fast forward the simulation, the same problem emerged with the depleted core and melted neutrino casing.
Steve gently transferred Ulysses from the cradle of his arms to Natasha’s waiting hands. The gentleness with which he held their son was warming the cockles of Tony’s heart. He knew that Steve, despite his strength and his great ability to cause destruction, was a gentle person. The way those hands touch and caress Tony’s body when they made love or whenever they casually touch assured him of that. But the way he held Ulysses was markedly different from the way he ever held Tony, like he was holding the most precious gift on Earth.
“This novel, it-- it’s more than something to read for me, Tony. It gave me strength to carry on in a war zone, when everything was devoid of hope. Just for awhile, when I’m reading this book, I get to imagine I wasn’t in some bombed out church in Northern France or Germany. For a time, I get to imagine I’m in Dublin, living peacefully with nothing to worry about. And I’d like to think it led me to you. I would have given up after Bucky’s death and after I woke up in that fake room SHIELD built for me, but then I remembered a passage in it that said,” Steve gestured at the battered book in his hand, “‘
“Hmm,” Tony smiled and nestled closer to Steve, kissing his lips softly, “say yes. You have loving parents, Steve. And I don’t want the legacy of their kindness and generosity to stop with you. I want it to continue long after we’re gone. Everyone knows who my parents are-- they have buildings named after them, but your parents don’t have that-- and I want our children to know them too, to know that their legacy was more than fame and fortune. That they’re also descended from people who dedicated their lives to serve others. ”
“I love you,” Steve said, and he moved forward. His cock sheathed within Tony’s warm passage in one full thrust. Tony moaned loudly at the feeling of Steve deep inside him, and Steve echoed it. Feeling himself encased in the warm sheath and tightness of his mate was pleasure beyond belief. He felt Tony clench around him, getting used to the intrusion to his body.
“Well, we want to meet this kid.” Babbo said, “Joey, you’re gonna invite him here for dinner one of these days. I’m sure your Uncles and Aunts would be delighted to meet him too.”
Later, Joe was dozing on the couch while Steve watched attentively at the movie that he unknowingly had at least 100 times in the past year alone. Bucky picked at his pineapple cake on the couch next to Steve, with no intention to eat another piece of it. On screen, Donnie Wahlberg and Bruce Willis argued about their mortality, and when Donnie’s character shot off a gun Steve jolted on the couch, not expecting the scene to end the way it was. Joe smiled softly at his son. Some days, it was easy to fool themselves that they’re normal, that Steve was living a normal life. But then little things, like not knowing that Bruce Willis was a ghost the whole time or the way a football game would end, would remind them that they’re playing a ruse on Steve.
“Really? How big of a bump do we get for murder?” Steve asked, rubbing down a dusty beer bottle with a cloth.
“I wanted to go up to him and introduce myself. But man oh man, was he hot though…” Tony sighed wistfully. Later on that afternoon, he was at the aquarium visiting Clint. Though Clint was supposed to be giving an ultrasound to the pregnant walrus, Tony’s friend was more concerned with chatting with him and eating the special brownie he procured from god knows where.
Tony felt Steve took his hand and he looked up at his mate, seeing the same fears and trepidation reflected back to him from his blue eyes. But Steve looked resolute in the face of trouble. He had always been the stronger one out of the two of them. “Steve,” Tony croaked out desperately, scared like never before.
“That’s not an excuse, Tony. You’re the most important person in my life and I got no right treating you that way even if it is a bad day.”
“Hmm,” Tony hummed, Steve’s gentle massage on his lower back felt good, “we should go visit sometime. If you want.”
“I really appreciate this, Father. I know this is a bit too late for a baptism, but there were extenuating circumstances.” Steve said.
Steve smiled proudly. At this point, his life was pretty much perfect. In about four months, he and Tony would be welcoming a new person to their lives, a person who would be the center of their universe. This brand new life that he and Tony created together, who would be the best of Tony and him.
“Well thank you, guys. It’s not a permanent thing, just for a couple of months until i can get this new project up and running.”
“I…I…” Tony’s eyes flickered towards the television. Steve followed his line of sight to the television, only to see morning daytime show commercials.
“Tony, none of this is your fault.” Steve closed his eyes and sighed heavily, “what do you mean, you don’t get lucky twice?”
“I don’t know…” Tony lied. He knew, he knew why. There was an ugly, ugly part of him that was unleashed back then, a part that was buried deep within him and for some reason reared its ugly head back during their altercation in the lab. A part that blamed Steve for not being there at his last moments, for letting him die alone. He remembered how scared he was, how much he wished he could have seen Steve one last time, but he wasn’t there. And earlier in the night, that dark, resentful and scared part of himself showed up and spat out some hurtful stuff to Steve. Though to be fair, Steve wasn’t mincing his words either. They said hurtful things to each other, hurt each other with their words.
“Not about anything important.” Tony said softly, pulling Steve closer to him by the tie and kissing him passionately. He felt and heard Steve chuckled and deepened the kiss.
,” Natasha teased him. Tony rolled his eyes at the words. He wasn’t responsible for the words that came out of his mouth sometimes. It just happened, like word vomit.
“Tears of joy. I can’t wait to start my days lounging around your house and still getting paid the big bucks.” Natasha said primly.
The conversation came to a halt when Jarvis rushed over to them, a panicked and wild eyed expression on his face. He came to a stop in front of Tony, focused on his childhood friend slash boss as he said, “Look, I know whatever you’re discussing is very important right now,” then noticing someone from his periphery he turned around to see DJ Falcon on the center stage, “It’s-- Falcon! Falcon!” Jarvis’ voice pitch went higher, “Hey. What’s up?” as they bumped fists.
Steve chuckled at Wilson’s brother’s words, “Fine. DJ Falcon in the house.” As Steve raised up his right hand to shake on the deal, he realized that he was still chained to the floor. He made a fist with his left hand instead, and Wilson’s brother bumped it with his own, sealing the deal.
“Tony, you need to settle down,” a hand was pushing back, urging him to lay back down on the bed. Tony fought it, batting it away and scooting forward to get off from the bed. “Tony, seriously, stay down. You don’t want to make me angry.”
Joe realized this was not best idea. But what was he supposed to do? Should he tell Steve that he has temporal lobe damage that wiped out his abilities to retain new memories and that he would never be a normal person and watch the pain and devastation in his son’s eyes, every single day? Or should he go on letting Steve think everything’s normal, just another Saturday to go out to the Hukilau for breakfast, and not burdening Steve with the knowledge of his condition?
Bucky was waiting for them in front of one of the stalls. His face set in of those frowns Steve recognized from when they were young. It was a frown Bucky wore when Steve did something wrong, like pick a fight he knew he couldn’t win no matter what the reasoning behind it was. Steve looked curiously at him but couldn’t spare too much of a thought as he was too focused on comforting Tony. Tony had a death grip on his arm, his left hand clutching at Steve’s leather jacket. Bucky opened the stall and there in all its hideous glory was the dead body of a man. He had a gunshot wound to his chest. By the blood spatter on the back wall of the stall, it looked like he was shot here. He had a trauma wound on his head along with the gunshot to the chest. Steve guessed the guy was hit on the head first then shot to death.
Joe Rogers considered himself a simple man. He has no delusions of grandeur that so often deluded many people. His version of the American dream was simply to get out of poverty, be able to take care of his wife and son and retire peacefully. As the son of poor Irish immigrants, Joe experienced first hand how dehumanizing poverty was. His parents always said that American poverty was still better than Irish poverty, but this was not a life he wished on anyone, not even his worst enemy. Even as a little boy, he knew that to break this cycle of poverty that trapped many of his relatives in he needed to get an education and make something of himself.
“Fury warned us that you have to make an arrest for this case.” Natasha started. Nick nodded, so far so good, she’s gonna keep her mouth shut. Nick knew he could always count on Romanov to be the most level headed of the rowdy bunch of employees Steve and Tony kept around.
“So what you’re saying is, he’s the perfect guy for you, right?” Peter said. He was seated across from Tony, a half full bottle of beer in front of him.
He started to hand his phone over to Loki before retracting it, “I’ll show you the picture but only if you drop the accent.” Loki nodded in acquiescence, his right hand held up waiting for Phil to hand over his phone. “Take a look.”
Tony’s not an idiot, okay. He may be emotionally stunted, but he’s not an idiot. He knows there’s an undercurrent of attraction and affection that underlies all of his interactions with Steve. At first, he chalks it up to hero worship of the Alpha since Tony did grew up with Steve being heralded as the pinnacle of goodness and bravery. But after getting to know Steve better as his friend, Tony can’t help but fall for him. His bravery, his innate need to do the right thing, his stubbornness, his protectiveness, his ability to make Tony feel loved and happy. Basically, he fell for everything about Steve. And Tony thinks Steve feels the same way, if the way he sometimes catch Steve looking at him is any indication.
Finally getting up from his perch by the pool, he picked up the portable ultrasound and addressed Candice the Walrus, “Okay let’s what we got here, mommy,” he angled the ultrasound sensor in the vicinity of the walrus’ womb and finally stopping when a cute little walrus facial features appeared on the screen, “There’s the little guy. Congratulations, mommy!”
