But Steve just considered Tony's hands in his, and he brushed his thumbs against Tony's fingers and said, "I know you don't believe in soul mates. I don't either — not, not in the way most people think of them. People talk about soul mates, they think it means someone that's just like you, someone that likes the same things that you do and thinks the same way that you do and sees the world exactly the same way that you do. If I ever had given thought to the idea when I was a kid, that's probably what I would have thought, too. But that's not a soul mate — not for me. I don't… I don't love you because you're exactly like me. You're not. I think we'd kill each other if we were exactly alike. But you balance me. You make me see things differently. You challenge me. You keep me on my toes. But you're my equal in everything. You're my balance, but you're my equal — if that makes any sense."
Tony shrugged. "Yeah, but you can make Christmas
"I didn't— Did I
Steve could only shrug. "Honestly? I couldn't tell you."
Steve closed his mouth again.
She scoffed and rolled her eyes. "I know that. What do you think I am? An idiot? You're bondmates, and I think perhaps the strongest I've ever come across on your Earth. I knew you wouldn't just weather this but would learn from it and grow from it."
"But you're the one that did this to him," Steve said. "You're the one that would have to undo it."
He put his hands to Steve's face, a palm against each cheek, and he tilted Steve's head forward so that Steve was forced to look at him. "Because he's your friend, and because you're not the type to leave a man behind. You'd do it for any of us. And because you feel guilty because you think it's your fault he's even like that in the first place."
"Hey, did I say you were jerking off to it?" He shot a pointed look at Steve and said, "That was the poster on his wall."
Steve frowned a little more, and Tony watched as he inched his hand out, his fingers stretching, and reached for Tony's abdomen. Knowing what sappy sort of shit he was about to pull, Tony backed away from the bed.
Tony rolled his eyes. "Hell of a coincidence, babe. What happened to you, what happened to me, her name, when she was born — I'm certain she said she was born at the end of August — it all matches. It all makes sense. It all lines up. It's her. I know it is. I know it."
"But it doesn't make any sense."
He rested his case.
And wouldn't
Bruce was silent a beat then said a quiet and solemn, "
Olivia, this was
were you able to sense it yourselves."
No, no, he wasn't going to think about that. He wasn't going to think about that horrible violation of his body.
"Because! Because I— Because I wanted to go back, but I wanted to stay, all right? Because I wanted it both ways. Because I thought I was supposed to want to turn back. But clearly, our daughter is absolutely miserable at the prospect of living on formula for the next year of her life, and—"
"Yeah?" he asked, staring down at the little being in his arms, the one still going to town on his nipple. Maybe he should switch her over to the other breast and give that one a workout for a while?
Tony eyed him over, and he nodded and said, "I see," before he turned and left, leaving Steve to wonder what in the hell had just happened.
"You sure?"
Steve shot a quick smile over at him. "Maybe that's why I like 'em. They're old."
"Well," he said with a shrug, "you're the one that thinks you're too good for our little boy-band, which…yeah, I mean, I guess isn't
He shrugged. "Whatever."
Steve's eyes narrowed in a little confusion at that, and he murmured an unsure, "
Steve raised an eyebrow. "Is that a question or—"
His mother? What would
A fucking daughter.
"Not in public, you're not," Tony muttered then stood back some and bit his lip as Steve tore the paper off the box and cracked it open. He pushed away the tissue paper and frowned, clearly assuming the box contained something very different.
"The asshole kind that absolutely refuse to change a diaper."
Well, if that wasn't a ringing endorsement for both his and Steve's relationship
they'd mapped each other's bodies. With their hands?
, I can't blame you. I mean, he's a hot piece of ass.
"We never actually got a honeymoon," Tony said then looked at Steve. "Holy shit, we never took a honeymoon."
"Yes, honey," Steve said like the bastard was just fucking
Steve squeezed his eyes shut a second, holding his breath as he tried to push that conversation back into the abyss he'd been able to keep it stored for the past couple months. He sort of remembered Thor being there — floating around as he inspected the different pieces of equipment and samples that dotted Bruce's lab — when Bruce had had that discussion with him, the one where he hadn't been able to mask his worried, brown eyes as he'd said, "
"But Tony
Natasha just fixed him with a flat look, but it surprised him that she let her guard down enough for him to see actual pain in her green irises, like she was painfully reminded of another time and place. She murmured something in Russian, but he didn't ask her to clarify, and she didn't translate for him.
Skip the middle third of the story if you want to miss it. The other parts should be OK.
Maybe, in years to come, he could pass it off — hand it over to Sam or Bucky or maybe even Clint if he wanted it (Clint wasn't too bad with the shield, as they'd found out during practices; Bucky...was another story). He didn't always have to be Captain America. He didn't have to forego a personal life just to fulfill the world's desire for a public one. All Steve had ever wanted, really, was a little bit of security and a family to call his own — people to love and take care of, people to surround himself with when he grew old. He had that in spades now, not just one but two families: his extended family of Avengers and the ones that mattered more to him than anyone ever had or ever would — his Tony and his baby girl. And damned if he was going to lose either of them. It hadn't been easy, and he'd made some sacrifices, but he had a family now, and he wasn't letting them go for anything. If that meant giving up 'Captain America' — if that meant giving up being an Avenger — then so be it. He would figure something out. He always had. He was nothing if not resourceful. The serum hadn't given him that.
"Why would you think this is something that would gross me out?"
. I know considering where you just were last night you don't feel deserving of this, but the Steve
He held Steve’s gaze a moment, his big, dark eyes almost daring Steve to challenge him, and Steve took another deep inhale of breath and squared his shoulders, standing at his fullest height and using it to attempt to cow Stark in some way.
"Olivia, what did I tell you about kicking the seat when Papa's driving? Stop it."
"Then why didn't you invite us to your little powwow?"
He trailed off and shook his head but he continued to laugh to himself. Tony watched him a moment before he scowled a little and closed up the access panel to the arm.
out there with experience in this sort of thing."
other than hunt down rogue Hydra agents that maybe could have fucking
"And would we be standing here at this very moment if I had? Would either of you have said 'yes'?"
He could hear Barnes and Romanova talking with JARVIS to find out Tony's exact location and Barnes cursing him out as
"Wherever you'd like," she replied, and Steve nodded and took a breath then began to list out every single ailment, malady, and issue that had plagued him from birth to the age of twenty-five. The doctor at one point asked him to slow down and then repeat the last several as she'd missed them in trying to set them up in her system, shaking her head and marveling at the list of conditions.
it — and it didn't come to pass? Words couldn't describe the amount of hurt that could and would cause him. So, if he told himself that all of that was part and parcel of another universe, when it didn't happen here, he couldn't get upset over it. It wasn't meant to happen here. It was all a part of another time and place.
"Oh, nothing. Don't worry about it."
"Tony, no," Natasha said, but JARVIS just said, "
"Are you trying to tell me something?"
"Look, I get that you want to be protective and you want to protect us and you want to make sure Hydra doesn't get their tentacles on us, but you can't lock us up and throw away the key."
" he cried, all but begging one of them to tell him what was going on. He had a dark and sneaking suspicion what their words and actions implied, but he wouldn't dare let himself formalize those words lest they turn out to be—
Jesus Christ,
"Thanks," he said and concentrated on his phone, "but I ate. You guys can have it."
the only reason that stuff exists. It's to make, well, in your case, little super soldiers." He patted his belly, surprised that the little monster inside of him hadn't woken up from what he and Steve had just done. "Exhibit A."
"I don't buy it," someone said and looked around the group for acknowledgement and support. He got a couple of shrugs and a couple of nods in return.
But Steve ignored him and continued trying to talk some…sense, he supposed he'd call it…into Barnes, and Barnes frowned a little and blinked at Steve, and he opened his mouth like he was about to say something — something that would indicate that he remembered — when Tony heard the unmistakable creak and groan of destabilizing metal, and he glanced up just in time to see a gigantic girder come crashing down toward him.
"Are you fucking kidding me?" he yelled up at the ceiling. The
"'M not being clingy," he said as he continued to brace a hand against Olivia to hold her back against his chest while he leaned forward and pressed another tree shape into the dough.
a different person. I'm the same 'me' deep down, but physically, yeah, I went from having a dick to a clit, and that's a hell of a change. But Steve and I, we…" He grinned, unable to help himself. "We make it work."
"Uh," Tony said and glanced back to eye up the gathering, "shouldn't we say 'goodbye'?"
"Didn't know dumping hot chocolate did it for you like that."
Tony looked down at the sleeping bundle in his arms, at her feathery lashes and the soft wisps of hair atop her head and the way her tiny little mouth was parted as she lay so peacefully in his arms. He noted the way her tiny little fingers curled themselves into fists, her body clothed in a pastel-colored sleeper patterned with little gray kittens that had been a belated gift from Sharon, and he swallowed and tried to imagine what it would be like — what his life would be like — without this little baby in his arms, this little ball of love and affection and late-night frustration when she just wouldn't go to sleep. It had been an awful,
"Uh, but you're
" he said before Barnes could counter him. "Look, I get how you see it, and you have every right to see it that way, but that's not the way I see it. You didn't do it. James Barnes didn't kill my parents. The Winter Soldier did. And everything I know about James Barnes has led me to realize that he would never willingly do something like that. The Winter Soldier killed my parents, but James Barnes saved me and, by extension, my baby, and— Look, you saved my kid. You saved my baby. I'm…
heels she wears."
They both turned to their slumbering daughter at that, and Steve clutched the fork so tightly in his hand that he snapped it in half, startling both himself and Tony, who just stared at the broken piece of flatware before he turned and pulled another one out of the drawer.
about himself?
Barnes snorted a laugh. "Steve's got his cut real short. Kinda surprised by that, actually."
"Just please, tell me," the woman said. "Is the child Captain Rogers's? Are you pregnant with the child of Captain America, Miss Carbonell?"
to imagine how fucking terrifying  that is—"
"You not looking like Tony Stark?"
He left it blank.
, and he was more interested in punching a bag than he was having a serious adult discussion with me."
Well, except pee standing up, now that he thought about it. That was one thing he couldn't do. He couldn't pee standing up. God, squatting was a pain in the ass. Women did
Luckily, his uterus chose to contract at that exact moment, taking his mind off of anything that wasn't the awful pain wracking his body.
Tony made a face of disgust. "It's
"I am serious, Steven. I'm very serious. I'm very serious about the fact that you're calling me
Bruce just blinked. "Uh...your daughter? Didn't you hear her tell us her name?"
"Steve is an idiot, but he loves you madly. Get some sleep,
Steve sighed and dropped his head a little. "I thought we'd settled this."
Steve turned to the door beside him, and he looked for the handle to crank the window back up. "Uh, how do you—"
Put me—! Don't even—! Oh, you think it's funny, do you?"
"The sooner you get this done, the sooner you get it over with," Steve said.
He looked to Steve, who shrugged and continued to page through the magazine as he said, "Tell 'em you forgot what it is."
, but I'm glad he has you."
"I'm not crazy. I'm—"
The muesli wasn't the most awful thing he'd ever eaten, and he was able to finish the bowl, and when he went to stick it into the dishwasher, he found the damned thing fully-loaded but unwashed. He rolled his eyes and found a spot for the bowl and the spoon then dug out a soap tablet and said, "It's two fucking steps, Steve. Put the soap tablet in, close the stupid thing up, and hit the button. OK,
But this Olivia wasn't the one that had gotten lost in time. This Olivia wasn't the one that would be rescued by a torn and disheveled and thoroughly-relieved Steve Rogers. This Olivia would never know that man except for the stories that he and the other Avengers could tell her.
Barnes seemed to feel like he'd become the proverbial third wheel, as he said a somewhat hesitant, "Uh, I can come back later if you need…"
"I think I've heard that before."
She just shrugged. "It's quite simple. If you end this life that grows inside you, you will end your own life. If you allow it to blossom and flourish, well, I think that goes unsaid."
"Why not?" he muttered and followed the curve of the road as it wound its way back up from under the river. "It's the truth, isn't it?" He scoffed. "Fuck, how could I have been so blind? What, Captain America's really going to want to get with me? Jesus, how could I—"
That had to mean something, right? Was it love? Was it infatuation? Was it comfort? Was it settling for what they could get? He didn't know. What he did know was that he was more in love with Tony than he'd ever been with anyone in his life, and he didn't want to let him go. Not then; not ever.
"Yeah," he said, Olivia's whines getting a little louder and more determined, her fussiness translating into wiggling and arm shaking. "Is that a bad thing?"
"Well, if
"Oh, also?" Tony said and turned back to the others. "When I get back, I firmly expect two of you to have retired to either your own floors or the communal floor. This is mine and Steve's. I'm not sure why the rest of you spend so much of your time here."
The doctor put her hand up. "I don't need to know specific bedroom activities. I just need to know if you've experienced any pelvic pain during intercourse."
He grinned at her. "The best," he said and brushed a light hand over-top of her head.
He grinned at him, and Steve was reminded not of the cocksure fella that just had to wink and smile to get the dames to fall all over him but of his best pal that had only ever wanted to help him see the world beyond the four cramped walls of his dumpy apartment.
"J, want to queue up something Cap might like? Something slow?"
"I can explain what happened," he replied. "Look, Bruce and I were just sitting here chatting—"
Barnes shook his head. "I don't know anything," he said and looked up at Steve, his light eyes sharp, but Tony saw truth therein. "They didn't tell me anything like that. I didn't ask questions. They program that out of you. They just told me who my target was and told me to take care of it."
, and horny as fuck?"
He looked down at himself, brushing a hand over his gossamer-and-satin-covered belly and said, "I don't even know what I look like. Does it look OK?"
Tony nodded and rather noticeably rested his hand on his abdomen. He rubbed it a bit and said, "OK, I'm going to ask you this again, and I want you to think
"Uh," Tony said and frowned. "Kind of. Own a company. My father started it— You knew
But Bruce just said, "Tastes really good," again as he cut into his syrup-slathered waffle and shoved another bite in his mouth.
Wilson shrugged. "I think that might actually be a good thing," he said but didn't elaborate. He didn't have to. Tony knew there were a lot of fucked-up childhoods sitting at the table with him. The fact that he was actually considered one of the 'stable' and 'reliable' adults really said something about how fucked up all of them still were to some degree.
Steve let go of his chin then reached back and threaded his fingers through the silken strands of Tony's long, thick waves.
"Yeah, well, mine matches, too. I mean, it matches what I looked like four months ago—"
But Tony continued his story. "Anyway, so, got him on the dance floor, had to, ugh,
She didn't say anything, but she nodded all the same.
"Sometimes I think she's taller than me in those things," Steve said and zipped the bag back up again and tossed it on the floor.
Tony glanced to Steve, who stared right back at him, and they held each other's gazes a moment before Tony said, "We may have come clean about a few things to each other. Turns out we both have...some unexplained experiences in our past."
"OK, first of all,
Now, he wasn't so sure. Maybe — just maybe — it wasn't because Tony was a 'fella.' It was because Tony...was
"Tony—"
a term we use anymore.
"I can only speak for myself," he finally said, "but it's a lot more...fun...with someone you love. Especially if that someone's a dirty old man."
Tony groaned and swallowed the bite. "I
Accepting that they would never be rid of the Chancellor was a tough pill to swallow, but the witch was right. The King, that silly, stupid romantic, had somehow talked the Archbishop into performing a marriage ritual for him and the Chancellor. If the Councilors had thought that reason would prevail at the last moment and the Church would look down upon the marital union of two
"Tony, don't tell him that," Steve said, but Tony motioned for DUM-E to roll his stupid bucket of bolts on over.
Bruce winced and pulled away from her, but Thor stepped forward and said, "Why should we not do that? Why should we not attempt to save the Man of Iron?"

No! Why?"
"I didn't."

"Amnesia," Bruce said, and Tony glanced up to him. He shrugged and added, "Guess you got hit with it at some point in her lifetime. According to her, Cap cried because you were out for a while and you forgot who she was. Guess which was the bigger offense to her."
happen, I am not letting you or Olivia or the Avengers go without a fight. I am going to do my damnedest to keep us all together and in one piece and happy. I am going to do everything I can to make this world a better place. I am going to do everything I can to make sure nothing is ever taken away from me without my consent. I am going to do whatever I can to make sure you and I spend our golden years sitting in matching rocking chairs and spoiling our grandchildren and boring them to tears with stories about the good old days. I love you, you idiot, and the hell I am letting you go for anything."
"Nice to see you again, former boss," Happy said and glanced at him in the rearview mirror before he pulled away from the curb. "Still lookin' good."
Steve didn't say anything.
Tony tapped on the screen to freeze the image, one of the on-screen Steve setting a Very Serious Gaze upon the interviewer sitting beside him, and Tony said, "That's the internet — or what you can find on the internet, anyway. All sorts of shit like that."
He clamped his mouth shut at that and shook his head and muttered something under his breath that Tony couldn't make out before he started talking again.
far because there was exactly one thing he would change.
"What?" he asked and motioned to his plate. "I needed ketchup!"
Steve could put up with a lot and had learned to accept a lot in his short time as a father, but trimming his tiny little girl's nails was something he...hadn't been able to handle just yet. There was nothing actually disgusting or disturbing about it save for the worst-case scenario Steve could draw up in his head, which was Olivia jerking her hand in some way just as Tony was about to clip her nail and—
Tony smiled and reached out to smack his arm. "That's why I love you, big guy." He sighed and relaxed into the couch and said, "For the record, I can guess that Nat and Wilson have gone to drag Steve back here, but to be honest, really don't want to see his mug at the moment."
Tony just grinned and kissed the palm of Steve's hand.
"Steve. My husband. Guy that wears the flag for a uniform. Tight, firm ass—"
Tony snorted a laugh. "She's really not. She's on the bigger end of the newborn spectrum, which I can say I'm surprised given who her father is."
"I'm not one for… I think they call it 'soul searching'?"
" Steve had asked in a prior conversation.
" He slapped his hands away as Steve went to help him. "I can do this myself!"
Barnes was sitting quietly at the table, and Tony watched as Steve fought with himself over something before he said a quiet, "Buck—"
, and childbirth is probably the most painful thing I've ever done—"
When Barton showed his face in the penthouse later that afternoon — the first time he'd been up there since the great living room re-arrange — he took one look around the place then turned to Tony and said, "You've got it
"My relatives?"
"Does anyone in this country eat goose?"
"Like I said, Stark," Natasha said as she sat down next to him. "Something you kind of just know how to deal with."
Tony could only hum as Steve continued to work him with his fingers, his other hand supporting the swell of his belly. Steve leaned forward and started to nuzzle at Tony's neck, but he sat back a moment and said, "Shirt, off," and Tony waited for Steve to do it himself, but when nothing happened, he sat back from the headboard and, with shaky hands, grabbed the hem of the shirt to pull it over his head. He tossed it onto the floor, and Steve said, "That's better," then pushed up flush with Tony, Steve's front to Tony's back, and cupped firm hands over Tony's breasts. "My God," he murmured as he nuzzled into Tony's neck, "they just keep on getting fuller, don't they?"
Barton scoffed in insult. "He's going to fucking love it!"
"It is! He looks just like him. God, he's
Steve grimaced a little. "Sorry."
"You forgot the part where I'm not the oh-so-wonderful Howard," he muttered and began to swipe at screens without bothering to really read what was on them.
He shrugged and turned on his side, grabbing Steve's unused pillow and tucking it between his legs. "Never mind, J. 'Night."
"Look," he said, clearly not holding Tony's aborted attempts at discussing his sex life against him, "I like Cap. He's a great guy. Honest, dependable, trustworthy. But whatever
"Well, I like to think if anything happens, they'd have the full force of the Avengers breathing down their necks."
, he'll actually listen to it."
Bruce meant well, he knew, and his logical mind understood that, but god, was his voice
"I think I can imagine what it means," Steve said but just tightened the arms he had around him.
But she just smiled at him like he wasn't giving himself enough credit.
Tony shifted his gaze from the cup to the traitor sitting beside him. "
"Pick a name."
Maybe it was for another Steve. Maybe it was a coincidence.
"That's a thin line you're treading there, Captain Stark-Rogers."
Rhodey's eyebrows almost hit his hairline at Olivia's familial name for him. "Not now. He's charging."
"That, conveniently, only affects me and not you — like
He did so, only then realizing how tightly he was squeezing her hand. He didn't let go of it; he just acknowledged that he was squeezing it hard enough to crack the bones.
Pepper muttered something under her breath. He couldn't make out what it was, but something told him he didn't want to know in any case.
He'd fought against it for so long, denied it for so long, and wished it away for so long, but it couldn't be ignored any longer. This
. Steve hadn't been moving on; Steve had been looking for replacements. Tony was a replacement and, until he'd been turned into this, a shitty one at that.
, and I never, ever want us to get anywhere close to that point, and I promise you we won't. But whereas there's a lot I
"Because I gave him the idea," Barnes said and Wilson scoffed like this was the most insulting thing he'd ever heard.
"As soon as I saw you and your boy pop up on the monitor," Sam explained, "I bet Grumpy over there you'd do something stupid like make a date with him."
"Tony-sexual, huh? I like that."
Barton just motioned to them. "Girl. And, my favorite— Cap, what does your little princess over there threaten to send you out into the cold, dark streets of New York at three o'clock in the morning to retrieve?"
"Whatever," he muttered and put his other hand to his abdomen, rubbing it, protecting it, trying to remember Steve's soothing assurance that nothing was going to get them. He wasn't just being used for a weapon.
Tony faked a gasp. "Insult after insult! Clearly you were raised in a barn."
He 'hmphed' a bit in thought and coasted through the tollbooth then made for the center tube. "I'm not overreacting here, am I, J?" he asked as he cut in front of a bus and gunned it into the tunnel. "I mean, he clearly picks
He motioned between them. "And we, uh, lead them?"
Except Tony.
Steve turned to glance back at him. "What's that from? Clint said that to me back when this whole thing first started."
," she told him over the phone not long after he and Steve had made their appearance at the gallery. "
—" Steve murmured.
"He's dead," Barnes said, his tone so cold it sent a chill down Tony's spine. "He might be a stubborn pain in the ass, but even he couldn't have survived that. Not that."
Tony glanced up and sputtered, "What are you—? Who are you talking to?"
" Tony asked with an arched eyebrow.
"What?" Bucky said. "That you're too chickenshit to face him?"
"Yeah, all right, fine," he said with a sigh. "Your sappy-as-fuck hubby wanted to throw you a surprise birthday party and asked us not to say anything to you about it."
Tony…was left pretty much speechless, which was kind of a first, and Steve probably deserved a medal for that.
"—she gets a little older, she might be able to sound out something—"
Tony's vision went a little blurry, and he frowned and said, "Goddamn it, Steve," and reached up with his free hand to brush the stupid, fucking tears away.
The clerk was silent a moment, hands steepled and mouth resting against his fingertips, before he said, "I honestly can't think of any other way of proving that you're really Tony Stark. I suppose I could make you submit an affidavit signed by two people that have known you at least ten years attesting to the fact that you
goofy like that. His little ball of paper had probably rolled somewhere where he couldn't fetch it, and the only one gullible enough to retrieve it for him was currently on a mission god-knew-where.
"Where are you taking me?" he asked after a moment of silence punctuated only by the 'music' playing at a low level and the quiet babbling coming from the back seat.
, Stark?"
"No, it does—"
"It will."
It had stopped mattering to him pretty quickly that she wasn't that other Olivia because this was
"Steve, are you OK? You sound pretty beat up there, old man."
Tony grabbed several packets of sugar and dumped them in all at once. "No," he said and dumped some half-and-half in, "but it was still rude. If I was a sensitive person, I'd only give her like a twenty-five percent tip."
Barnes frowned at them. "Wait, what's the 'Justice League'?" he asked.
Tony disappeared back into the kitchen after that, and Steve yawned and asked JARVIS to turn off the TV, watching as the screen went black, the only light now left in the room coming from the Christmas tree and the lighted garlands of holly that had been strung up by the windows.
"James
"Hmm?" Tony licked lightly at Steve's pulse-point then began to suck ever-so-gently.
"No?"
"Yeah," he said and got up from the chair. "I don't know about this whole 'soul mates' business. First of all, I don't believe in that. Second of all, if it were true, don't you think we would know about it?"
"Doesn't…doesn’t that strike you as suspicious? Either that shirt she's wearing is completely out of date or golden-boy Cap is too good to hang out with the proletarians."
Knowing that alerting Tony to the fact that he was not falling for this ruse would be suicide, he slipped into the pair of decidedly comfortable pants — pajama pants, he determined. Tony was going back into the kitchen, chattering away at ninety miles an hour about… Oh, who the hell knew? The man talked. A lot. Eventually, Steve decided, he would slip up and the game would be over. Until then…
Rhodey shot him a look, and Tony just shrugged in defeat and said, "Send her down, J."
Tony groaned and sipped more of his drink. "Oh, my god," he said, the swizzle stick not leaving his lips. "Are we back to this? You're full of shit. It's not a girl. Do not pass 'Go.' Do not collect fifteen thousand dollars."
"No," Tony replied and went over to a cupboard to grab a bowl. "But he won't be back for a while. I've got time to figure it out."
"I know," Steve said, setting the bottle of syrup down without a glance, his gaze too focused on the sleeping baby in her carrier.
"Because honestly I'm not sure that the serum
"Yeah. That I'm the long-lost Stark sister that mysteriously disappeared in 1978 or whenever we make it." He waved his hand in the air. "Details aren't important yet."
He swallowed like he was trying to sum up the courage to voice his next thought.
"On my old man's side, sure. But that's not why we do it. We're New Yorkers too lazy to cook our own damned meal. That's why."
"I never said any such thing!"
Steve shook his head some. "It's not that. It's—"
He turned back to Steve to gauge how he'd done, and Steve just smirked at him a little then said, "You know, you said words, but I'm not sure any of them made any sense."
it. I'm asking if you've
This was…not what he had expected from life.
He shook his head some and picked up his champagne flute again. "Good god, no. I don't want any more of you than there already are. But you're right. It would make a prime location for unethical human experimentation, wouldn't it?"
"Same place you got it back at the beginning of this whole mess," Tony said with a roll of his eyes.
He stared at her some more, and he said, "Then Tony and I— We— Do we— Are we happy?" he finally settled on asking.
"I didn't say you couldn't come to the opening. I just know how you are in, well,
"How long have we known each other?" he asked as the song changed, this one a bit slower and sung by a woman.
"How 'bout just a seltzer?" Steve suggested. "I'll have them put fruit in it."
He stayed quiet a moment, and he set his fork down and sat back into his chair again. He turned his attention to the skyline beside them — the lights and the dark outlines and the sky hazy with cloud-cover — and he seemingly contemplated something a moment before he said, "I don't know what it is, to be honest. I mean, there's so many great things about the future — the vaccines and the food and the attitudes are a little more…open. You can get free transfers on the subway! All the lines are operated by the city now. Jesus, back then, you wanted to change lines, you had to pay because there were three different companies operating the lines. All the Els in Manhattan are gone — or most of them are. Trolleys don't exist. The little corner stores are pretty much wiped out. Costs an arm and a leg to live almost
"Steve, babe, we've been over this a thousand times. It's not bad luck—"
Steve just shook his head. "I don't—"
He had to choke out a laugh at that through his tears. God, Howard would probably blame him for turning Steve gay or something. No way in hell was Captain fucking America some kind of
"I don't even know what that is," Steve said with a slight laugh.
"Is that the attitude you're going to take after he's born?"
Though he supposed he could understand why it might set him off just a little.
"Whatever," Tony said again and turned to leave, but he stopped a moment and turned back to Bruce and said a somewhat less assured, "You don't really think there's anything to worry about, do you?"
before it was even born, how exactly would Tony die then?
He leaned down and rubbed his shin where Natasha had slammed her foot into it, and the guy put his hand on Tony's back and said, "Hey, you know what's good for that?"
Steve turned the page. "Because I just realized we never picked out a girl's name."
They both stared at him, and Steve's mouth quirked up some in a small little smirk. "I know she didn't mean to be offensive, but harassment's harassment any way you slice it."
Tony rolled his eyes.
venge, not
Bruce nodded again and said, "OK. Ten minutes. That should—" he started to say but then seemed to think better of it and closed his mouth in a little bit of resignation before he nodded and said, "Ten minutes."
Tony again kept his focus on the road ahead of them but said nothing to that, and instead of finding it suspicious, Steve instead found it a little disheartening, and something ferociously protective awakened deep within his soul. Tony was able to take care of himself; he knew that. But he sensed vulnerability in Tony — a deep, dark emotional vulnerability, and a painful pang hit his heart at that thought. From out of nowhere, he wished to pull Tony into his arms and shield him from all the ills of the world. He wanted to protect Tony, defend him from those that would perpetrate harm against him. The bravado and the cockiness were a mask. Deep down, Tony was vulnerable and insecure, and more than anything, Steve wanted to banish those wretched thoughts to the netherworld where they deserved to reside. Tony was beautiful and charming and brilliant and handsome, but Steve knew he didn't genuinely believe it about himself. Something or someone, somewhere, had caused him grief. Something had made him doubt himself. Something had made him fight to prove himself. He was a little like Steve in that regard, he supposed.
"Turns out she has that reputation back at home, too," Bruce said with a genial chuckle. And then, because if there
It was going for dusk by the time they were pulling out of the garage, Thor and Bruce performing their promised distraction at the front of the building (some announcement of some charity thing — Tony didn't get the details, though he was pretty sure he heard the words 'dunk tank' uttered at some point), Steve behind the wheel, and a warning from Tony not to drive like the maniac he usually did.
, "—and all of a sudden this yellowish-orangeish portal opens up and she comes tumbling through, and she immediately starts calling me 'Papa' and Brucie 'Uncle Bruce' and generally acts like she knows us and knows the place."
"Hey," Steve said, startling Tony from his thoughts. "You sure about this?"
"Do you want to get a bath?" he asked.
Tony smacked his hand away. "I said, I am literally taped into this dress. Wasn't that why I had to have you help me go to the bathroom before?"
Bruce didn't want to join them as Bruce
Steve stared at him a moment — like he was debating whether or not to fight Barnes on what he'd said — before he took a breath and squared his shoulders and nodded his understanding.
Steve shushed him then said, "She's trying to sleep."
She was half-asleep already, and so he carried her over to the couch and set her down, and he tucked the pillow under her head then grabbed the blanket that was thrown over the back of it and laid it down over her. He tucked it in and murmured for JARVIS to dim the lights in this portion of the room before he went back over to his workstation and continued laboring with the Mark XVI.
"I don't,
"Huh?"
, you're undoing what you did to him — what he never asked you to do."
"Crackers?"
Before Steve could say anything — like ask just what the hell language Tony was speaking — he was gone in what Steve presumed was the direction of the kitchen, and, licking his lips (he swore he could still taste Tony on him, though he didn't know quite how to describe it), he pushed into the living room.
"Doing what?"
"If that's what you want."
"Yeah?"
"Seat belt," he muttered but found the strap in question: one going over the shoulder and one going over the lap. "How do I secure it?"
But Tony didn't hear the rest — or he didn't pay attention to it — as another sharp pain hit, and he gritted his teeth again and squeezed his eyes shut and waited for the feeling to subside, tearing at the sheet a little bit as he did so.
haven't done anything to stop her, god knows how badly she walks over her real father."
Tony went to pick the glass up to take a sip, but he blinked and looked up at the ceiling at the last second. "Wait. Are you saying what I think you're saying?"
"We'd find a place."
be wrong."
Natasha frowned at him just the slightest. "Honey, Esmeralda's dead. You know that."
things he'd ever had to listen to — and clearly it was the fucking chicken!). It was probably the first time in his life that he'd ever really, truly felt like he had a family — a real family — one to argue with and get annoyed by and fight for tooth-and-nail. Pepper and Rhodey had been all that he'd had for a long time, and he loved them and still did, but these goddamned Avengers had wormed their way into his home, into his confidence, and into his heart, and if there was any one thing he wished he could go back and tell his younger self when he was at his lowest — when Howard had finally taken about all that he could of him and sent him away from the only home he'd known up to that point — it was that it would all be worth it in the end. That it may not look it now, and it may not feel like it know, and it may take a long, long time to happen, but it would be worth it. It would be so worth it, and he wouldn't change any one thing about it.
He heard Steve suck in an audible breath, and the doctor nodded like he'd merely confirmed what she already believed and said, "I wish I could recommend a support group for you, but to be honest, I don’t believe there's any in existence for your…unique situation."
Some of the fight went out of Steve at that to be replaced by slight embarrassment, but he still held his ground and said, "Maybe it is. I just think it's bad luck to do anything like that before he's here. Once he's here, we can splurge on all the necessities — within reason, obviously — but I don't— Not before then. Not anything before then."
Steve got up on his knees and sat back a little, but he reached down and put a hand over Tony's mouth and said, "That's enough out of you." Tony licked his hand, and Steve smiled a little at him and said, "You're going to pay for that."

Barnes just shrugged then said, "Hey, you know I can do a Vulcan nerve pinch?"
his because he thinks I'm going to use it to call Steve."
He leaned against the sink, grasping hold of it to steady himself as he tried to gain his bearings. OK, so, he didn't know where he was, but he was still pretty sure he knew
"I recall it," the clerk said. "I don't recall there ever being an explanation for it."
"Oh, well," Barton said and held his bottle of water up like he was toasting Steve, "have fun painting the princess's
"I’m filthy from the battle," was all he could think to say, and Tony rolled his eyes and pointed to the bathroom on the side of the lab.
"Point is," he said and unscrewed the cap on the juice then set the open bottle down beside the smaller portion of macaroni and cheese, "there is absolutely no threat of me settling down with Captain Anachronism whereas there is every chance in the world of you settling down with, uh, what'd you say her name was?"
He turned the black rectangle to face Steve, and Steve saw what looked to be a color photograph of a wall littered with arrows embedded into it. Steve just nodded, not really sure what to make of it.
"Look, Buck, it's not anything you—" he started to say, only slightly ashamed at the fact that he was drawing some sense of grounding from his infant daughter.
He rolled his eyes and turned to Thor, who was shoving his sandwich in his mouth. "You can keep your postcards. I was just being pissy."
. Holy shit, he'd
"Well, just close your eyes," Steve suggested and cuddled up as close as he could.
"Papa?" the voice whispered again, and Tony groaned and stretched a little, grimacing as a pain throbbed in his back.
"I don't want to hurt you."
"That's OK, dolly. Don't try to fight it. Just let the sleep come over you. Makes it a lot easier for both of us."
Much as he loved her, much as he didn't care that this wasn't her, there was still a part of him that wanted to believe this was
He swallowed and fought to keep his gaze locked in with Steve's. "Yes."
Steve stared at him, a look on his face that was equal parts amused and insulted. "You said that on purpose."
it was the right song. Wasn't the way he remembered it being played.
Tony settled in to let the baby nurse, and Steve sat and watched, his face curious and contemplative, and after a moment of comfortable silence, he said, "So…where did all this stuff come from?"
"Yeah, no. I like Cap. He's a great guy. Totally trust him with everything I got. Don't think of him
He glanced down at his abdomen and wondered — if just for a moment… No, not possible at all. Alternate universe. Not even worth thinking about.
time as a joke—"
"No, I'm making fun of you," he said, but Steve realized Tony still had a hold of his hands and was brushing his thumbs over Steve's clasped fingers. "To answer your question
"Wait, what? Why?"
And failing. Miserably. God, when was this going to be over? And when was Steve going to be home? Steve couldn't make it better, but at least he could whine to Steve about it.
bit."
God —
"Wait, who?"
"Practicing your 'smooth moves' in front of the mirror doesn't count as 'kicking ass,'" Barnes replied as he worked at puling the streamers down from the ceiling.
"I didn't
"Really sound like you believe it there, too," Steve muttered, evidently unimpressed with Tony's rather matter-of-fact tone of voice.
She was Tony's baby, too, after all.
Steve slowly finished pulling the tape off his hand, staring at Thor's earnest and dare he say excited face as he tried to work out how to even respond to that.
"Hmm… Well, then I think what you need is to take a nice, mid-week vacation out to New York where you get to watch me marry the world's youngest WWII vet."
"Soul mates?" he mused, and Tony said, "Some people out there think we are."
She laughed and pushed in, holding the door open for Tony, who followed with Rhodey and the phone right behind him, and he suddenly realized how crazy this whole thing was when everyone turned to look at him—
"I know Barnes didn't kill my parents. I mean, I guess
"Jesus," he muttered with an exhaled breath. "Wait— Eighteen hours?" He looked down at the clock on his computer. "How the hell long have I been down here?"
"Steve, he doesn't hate you," he cut in before Steve could finish his thought. "He doesn't. You're his brother. He just… For one, you're kind of at different points in your lives now, and for another… He doesn't want to keep reliving the past. He doesn't only want to talk about the 'good old days.' And he thinks you think that…if you don't keep talking about the past that you won't have anything else to talk about."
The crazy space lady turned me into a woman so you would knock me up because we're 'soul mates,' and she says that this is what all soul mates need to complete their 'bond' or whatever-the-fuck it was she said."
Steve opened his mouth to say something when the kitchen door slammed into the back of his chair again, jolting him, making him hit his abdomen against the table, which rattled the dishware and cutlery atop it. He took another deep breath and let it out, shooting a glare in the direction of the waiter that had slammed the door into his chair.
"What do we do?" Natasha asked, and Steve closed his eyes almost like the decision pained him to say.
But Tony rounded on him and said, "Oh, no, you're not off-the-hook. You made me sit through all that crap, so you're going to
"It's possible," she replied, airy and noncommittally.
after we make love," he said and stroked Tony's hair back away from his face, and Tony tried not to think about where those fingers had just been. "That's not— God, Tony, that's not something I ever want to—"
Steve stepped closer, and he went to pull Tony — oh,
Tony hummed a bit, intrigue and lust sounding like they were mixed in together. "I like it when you get all possessive and protective. It's quite the turn-on."
Steve just grabbed him by the arms and pulled him so they were facing one another. Tony wouldn't meet his gaze, and he folded his arms and made sure to pout extra noticeably so that Steve would get the drift that he didn't want to fucking talk about this.
"We both...have things we need to deal with first," she finally admitted, and Tony nodded in understanding.
Tony just laughed. "
First date of last menstrual period? Yeah, OK, he left that one alone.
He finished cleaning up, straightened his uniform out, and left the restroom with much more aplomb than he'd entered it.
"Princess is your best friend, right?"
There was wetness on his face, but he wasn't sure if it was from the water or if it was from the second batch of tears he quietly let fall as he grabbed some shampoo and soaped his hair up. Yeah, it was stupid to cry about this. There were thousands of worse things to get upset about, and it wasn't like Steve was going to leave him for Barnes — or maybe not in that way he wasn't.
Tony bristled. "Yeah, well, Cruella De Ville was under the impression that she
Natasha snorted a quiet laugh but said nothing and instead went back to painting the second coat on his nails.
"Not really, no."
"Why not?" Bruce asked, and she turned to him, her eyes flashing like she'd just realized someone else was in the room. She focused on him a moment then frowned and reached out to touch a hand to his cheek.
Steve glanced at the tablet. "Some research."
They left the park after that and made the short stroll back to the car, and they piled in for the drive back to the house. They were relatively silent on the drive home, but it was the comfortable sort of silence where words weren't necessary to break any sort of outstanding tension. Olivia babbled to herself in the back seat, but Steve could tell her babbles were tinged with exhaustion, and there was no argument this time about her kicking the back of Tony's seat.
at least one person going through your food or watching TV in your living room? I know we're not Steve, but we're not going to abandon you. You're ours, Stark. You're stuck with us, whether you want us or not."
The lab bathroom was a more utilitarian affair than the one in the penthouse. Nicer than most overall, but much more basic than the decadence he was used to luxuriating in. There was a shower and a toilet and a sink, and honestly, any Manhattanite would kill for it, no matter how simple an affair it was.
Steve tweaked a smile and said, "You know, I always wanted a train set to put under the tree."
"Oh," Tony said and pulled away from him, trying to distance himself. If Steve caught on to what he was doing, he gave no indication of it. "Yeah, well, look—"
Tony shrugged and began to inspect the wine glass that sat to the side of his plate. "Maybe. Still thinking about it. Is this wine? You know I really shouldn't drink wine, right? Forget being pregnant, you do remember me saying I've been dry for well over a year, right?"
"Well, Daddy's from a, uh, different time when that's how they liked to cook their food."
"Remove the spell," he said in a voice that would have had almost anyone quaking in their boots. Anyone except screwy goddesses from other realms.
Previous pregnancies, abortions, miscarriages, stillbirths, live births, and living children. OK, this was starting to get a little weird.
— that you're not going to get cold feet again."
I am and how
He shrugged just a little so that he wouldn't startle the baby, and Tony nodded and said, "Well, next to my voice, yours would have been the one she would have heard most, so, I guess it makes sense."
"Never thought I'd see the day," he mumbled, and Tony set the iron to cook and turned to him.
"I guess you could say that," he agreed, his own voice going a bit deep with his response.
He wasn't thinking about it only because of what had happened over a week ago. Truth be told, yes, there was a teeny, tiny part of him that had been enamored with the sanctimonious son-of-a- bitch from the start and only wanted the bastard to
"Do you get in on that?"
to do, Tony. It should be something you
"He was a fucking flirt that was playing the field, babe. You were looking for a soul mate. He was looking for a good time. How do I know? Because I
" he whined. "He's not actually right, is he?"
Steve shrugged noncommittally then went back down to staring at the baby, his confusion breaking and being replaced by a soft, warm joy. He tightened the arm he had on the baby and pulled her just a little bit closer, and he tightened the arm he had around Tony and pulled him just a little bit closer, and they sat there in quiet contentment until Olivia's fussiness got to be too much, and Steve frowned and said, "Is she OK?"
Tony just grinned and swiveled a little in his chair. "Steve is a
"No time like the present."
"Fine," he said and pulled his hand back. "J, send her on down."
"I did get into the city a couple times," he said, brushing off Tony's comment. "Buck and I went up to the Roseland Ballroom one time. He had a couple of dames— broads—
So, they sat and chatted amiably about a host of topics as they stuffed their faces with greasy-but-delectable chow, and Tony wiped his mouth off with a paper napkin then threw it on the table and said, "So, how's the future coming along for you?"
"Hmm…that sounds like a challenge, old man."
Steve's mark.
"I don't know how we're getting over there now, but yeah, fine, we'll go," Tony said.
Tony took her hand and said, "Natasha Carbonell," in return, but Bruce shook his head and said, "No, it's not."
"What is?"
I made myself clear in that we were never to discuss this ever again, but evidently, you have a bad memory, so let me refresh it: We are
"But I
"Ah ha!" Tony cried and pointed at him. "I knew you'd admit it someday! We
"Welch," Steve said with a curt nod, defaulting to soldier etiquette.
He looked between the two of them, and he huffed and stood up, letting Thor help him through the struggle that was only going to get worse over the next couple months. He muttered about something being bullshit — nothing in particular, just felt the need to make the comment — and stumbled over to the steps, grumbling about fine, he'd go to bed, but it wasn't like he was tired, and they fussed more than Steve did on his worst day.
"Not all of us," he countered.
His radio crackled, and he jumped and went wide-eyed as the others turned in his direction, and he slid out of the atrium and moved into another room before he grabbed it and said a snappish,
Steve just shrugged and said, "He wanted to surprise you."
it's been over fifty years. It happened before either one of us was even born. For the Cap, it's been, what, a month?"
"Seriously, though, men are pigs. I mean it. I mean,
Tony snorted a laugh. "I can't believe that old bloodsucker has ever shown affection for anything a day in his life." He turned to Steve. "Hey, maybe he was part of that vampire coven you had to vanquish during the war? Maybe you, you know, killed his bondmate or something?"
"I can imagine," Steve said then added, "It was only a dream. You know that, right? Strucker's not getting his hands on you, and he's definitely not using you to…breed a pack of super soldiers for him."
"How would you know?"
"I thought you said Captain Rogers was accompanying you?"
Jesus fuck, the fact that he was even thinking of himself and the Cap in those terms...
Steve went to protest this, but Hill said, "Getting ahead of the story would put some of the power back in our hands. There's rampant speculation out there now. The more you do this, the more questions people are going to ask, and the worse they're going to make everything seem."
And nary a salad to be seen.
Tony glanced up and saw Barnes glaring at him, and he surreptitiously looked to his right to make sure his brand-new travel gauntlet was within reach should he need it before JARVIS felt it prudent to alert Steve. Even DUM-E whirred some, the sound coming off a lot like unease and suspicion.
" and looked at Tony for confirmation.
Steve was silent a moment before he nudged Tony away from him and said, "Do you mind?"
to get obsessed with. This is—"
"Nah, I'm going with Barton. You're spoiled as shit. No, you know what? I've changed my mind. It's you two. You know why? 'Cause somehow, the formerly brainwashed Soviet assassins are less codependent on each other than the super soldier and the billionaire."
"What? Why?"
— before he slid in beside Tony and closed the door behind him. Tony just glared at him, but Steve ignored him and instead leaned forward to give the address to the driver in that damned, thick Brooklyn accent he used when he was trying to disguise himself, which honestly made him look like such an asshole the way he was dressed that Tony was almost —
"I know, but…" She gave his hand a squeeze. "If you need anything — anything — don't even hesitate to ask me, you understand me?"
Every single man — his own husband included — sat or stood there looking utterly perplexed and nervous about what was happening. Every man save for Barton, who nodded to Natasha, who nodded in return and got up from her chair.
"Besides," Barnes added and nodded his head at Tony, "I can help look after this one. It's the least I can do for you."
JARVIS didn't say anything in response, but the light in the lab shifted, darkening, as a grid of lines came over Tony's form, and Tony rolled his eyes and said, "Jesus, J. Let me get—" and quickly moved to divest himself of the under armor he was still wearing.
Steve rolled his eyes and scoffed at that. "And you believe her?" he asked, turning to look at Tony.
"Yeah? Well, don't get mad if they end up black and charred," Barnes muttered and pushed at them with a spatula.
Tony jerked a half-smile at him before shrugging. "Sure. Why wouldn't I be?"
"She did," Bruce said, his gaze focused back on the TV. "She stopped by before, but you were taking your usual afternoon nap."
"So, he wasn't mistaken," Rhodey said as Olivia cried out, "Unca Rhodey!" at him and held out her arms like she wanted him to pick her up.
"Maybe now, but not by the time you wake up."
but didn't say anything until his gaze was back on his tablet again.
I didn't almost
Tony met his gaze and held it a moment, the true, earnest smile of his oldest friend in the world, and with his eyes going watery for about the millionth time since this whole thing had happened to him, he reached out and pulled him into a hug, tight and with all the love and affection he felt for his best bro.
He shrugged. "Not sure. Who knows? Maybe. It's just a song, Steve."
Gun to his head, though, he was about ninety-nine percent sure Steve finished it.
"You know there's something called 'erotic lactation'?"
Of course, not that Tony knew who
going to be looking at your shoes."
"Nope," Tony said, the voice just barely making it through Steve's haze of lust, "gotta go a little lower than that, soldier."
to be flattered. They love to be told how pretty and smart and funny and oh-so-wonderful they are. And that's…that's not you. Now, I'm not saying these girls weren't idiots that wouldn't know a good thing if it smacked them in the face, but — and I'm
. And you—" He motioned at him like that explained everything. "
. I want— I need you. I want… I want to play."
"Really? That's what you're going with?" Barnes muttered.
Steve shrugged and shook his head a little at what he no-doubt took to be a waste of money, shoving more useless wrapping paper into the bag. "It's… I'm sure it's been worse."
But Steve just seethed a little more before he stormed up the ramp and into the jet, and Tony and Barton followed after. Steve, helmet in his grasp, whipped it at the side of the jet, making Barton and Tony both jump a little, and it even caught Thor and Wilson by surprise, who were standing up by the pilot's seat. Wilson looked to Barton for explanation, but Barton just put a hand up and shook his head a little bit as though to say
my daughter, and fuck you for saying that!"
Steve grinned a little and shut the door, doing up the locks and hooking the security chain. "I lead a very busy life."
Steve just groaned and pressed his face into his hands before he glanced back at Tony and again asked, "
"Yeah, I kind of do."
Tony whined some more and rolled his eyes, but Natasha looked over at the rest of the gang collected on the couches and chairs, and Tony startled a little at the strange sort of silent agreement that seemed to come over them. He turned to Steve to see if he had noticed, but Steve was eyeing the group with squinted gaze and pursed lips and tensed jaw, like he knew they were up to something and he didn't trust it.
. Plus, his back was bothering him, aching in a way he wasn't accustomed to, and so getting comfortable enough to sleep might have been almost impossible anyway.
—" he motioned over himself, "—was more or less forced on me."
"It was still television," Steve said with a shrug. "You're also not the first talking robot man I ever saw."
Steve exhaled a breath and went to clutch the robot a little tighter when he realized he was about to crush it. He set it down, hoping he hadn't damaged it too much, and muttered a quiet, "Jesus."
"Age jokes?"
Pepper's face went soft and a little sad at that. "Oh, Tony," she said, breathing out his name in slight sorrow, "I'm so sorry."
, Steve."
"Uh, traditionally, I think we get that," Tony said then shot a pointed look at the rest of the group. "I'm sure you wouldn't want to see us
"We would never," Bruce said. Tony, very maturely, flipped him off.
"OK!"
—" she pointed to Tony, "on the other hand, aren't even the right sex for Tony Stark."
He shook the bottle up to get it to mix then unscrewed the top and took a deep breath.
Steve smiled, and sauntered over to Tony. "Yeah, but we're alone? The others are—"
Tony nodded his understanding and nestled against Steve's broad and inviting chest again, and Steve rocked him back and forth, putting gentle but firm arms around Tony and holding him close.
Bruce had shrunk away from the crowd some, standing closer to behind Tony and Steve than right out at the front with them. "Uh, as far as I can see," he said, and Tony turned back to the crowd to gauge whether or not that had sufficed. When he figured that it hadn't quite done the job, he sighed a little and rolled his eyes.
"Nah," she said and shook her head. "An' Pepper usually takes me out, and we go for lunch, and we get our hairs done, and sometimes she lets me sit at her desk and pretend I'm important."
"My alternate-universe daughter?" he asked and glanced up to meet Bruce's nervous gaze. Bruce exhaled a sigh but nodded just the same.
He went down to his lab and began to putter with things for SI and things for the Avengers (who evidently couldn't be bothered with him, but whatever, he'd be the bigger person here), chowing down on a turkey sandwich that had appeared at some point but not bothering to ask where it even came from. He took a nap on the couch after that, waking up to a blanket tucked around him that hadn't been there when he'd fallen asleep, and he got up and puttered around some more before he stretched and cracked his back and rubbed his belly and sniffed himself, realizing then he was a bit ripe.
Natasha just snorted a laugh at him, and Rhodey called out from the hallway, "OK, they're not doing anything weird in there, are they?"
Steve just put a hand to his lower back and steered him onto the car. "Oh, heaven forbid."
"Nothing," he muttered, the words coming out as a slight pout, "I'm tired."
"About what?" Tony asked, and he watched as Steve and Rhodey exchanged slightly uneasy looks before Steve turned to Tony and said, "I, uh—" He dropped his arms, and he reached up and scratched at his forehead. It literally had taken until this moment for Tony to realize it was a nervous habit of his. "I, uh, asked Jim if he— when you— I—"
"I'm sure he'll survive it," Natasha said and patted his arm, "but I do think it's something he should be made aware of," and Barnes looked at her and said, "Do I actually get anything, or is it an honorary thing?"
Tony stared at him a moment before he said, "You know, maybe it was a mistake not getting you to sign that prenup?"
Tony raised an eyebrow. "What about you?"
"The others were saying," he said, unsure of whether or not this was something he should even broach, "that you're having a hard time not seeing me as I am. That on some level you can't not see me as a woman that's carrying your child."
"Oh. Yeah," Tony said and looked again to the little blue piece of paper he held between his fingers. "I guess so."
"Oh, god," Tony muttered, and even though his focus was concentrated on the tabletop where he was scraping up the cookies to set onto the baking sheets, Steve just knew he rolled his eyes at that.
"Yeah?" Tony said and stepped closer, hands still at his hips. "You asked me to go with you."
Steve sat back, winded by Tony's little speech. It wasn't that it floored him, and it wasn't that he believed him; it was just a
Steve went still for a moment then frowned at the paper as he seemed to come back to himself. "Seriously?"
is over and done with?"
The others didn't stay away for long, making their long-awaited appearance in what ended up turning into what amounted to a post-birth baby shower, even if most of the big-ticket gifts had already made their way into the penthouse. But everyone that gathered there, including the team as well as Pepper and Happy, brought along a little something for either the baby or for Tony or for both, and Tony found the tears streamed just a little too easily in his gratitude for their gestures.
"Thank you," he said and straightened up again.
"Yeah, you don't need to explain anything more. I got it."
God, he loved that gummy bear.
"The only reason you hear it every time you turn around is because you're constantly denying it."
"Look, I know this all seems odd to you, and it's odd to me that it's odd to you because this is our life, and with the things life has in store for you, eventually, this won't even rate on your weirdness scale. You'll think it was all a dream, and you'll tell me about it on a snowy Christmas Eve — seriously, how fucking cliché; we even get a 'white Christmas' — as we pile our spoiled brat daughter's presents under the tree, and you grumble about Barton and his BFF Buc—er, the One- Armed-Man putting all those holes in the drywall because they were having a pissing contest over which one has the better aim. Spoiler alert: they both suck after five glasses each of Grandma Barton's down-home homemade egg nog. I think you were honestly more upset that they weren't even bothering to give the impression that they were listening to you, though — let's be honest, babe — you are the last person that should give any of us grief about following orders because the only order you ever followed was to repeat your marriage vows when— Well, you'll find out."
Tony exhaled a heavy breath. "Don't know. If it's any consolation, you've aged a bit in the time I've known you. You won't be young forever."
"You do. It's ridiculous how much you eat. I made a dozen waffles the other night. I got two of them."
"Nikola Tesla died there. In the hotel itself, I mean, not the club," Tony said.
"Wait, yeah," Barnes said, face still pinched in confusion, "but wouldn't you taste it?"
"She's hungry," he explained.
Tony shrugged and pulled the waffle off the iron. Rhodey held up his plate, and Tony slid it onto the sticky surface then scooped up the last of the batter and poured it onto the iron's surface.
"Look, we've been sleeping in the same bed as each other for a year-and-a-half now. We're all adults here. I don't think there's any reason to—"
"So?" Natasha said and raised an eyebrow.
She settled back into her chair and began the process of picking up what was still an admittedly large slice for such small and fumbling hands. Still, she must have eaten pizza in the past, as she knew enough to fold it in half — though she went about it in a stupid and strange way, using her palms to press the two sides of the pizza together — in order to eat it, and she took her first bite and began to chew with her mouth open.
Steve raised a questioning eyebrow. "Sort of? What's that—? I mean, how does it work when two, uh,
Cap, for his part, just said a rather unsure, "Stark?"
But then he'd crashed a plane in the Arctic in 1945 and woken up in New York in the new millennium, and it turned out the one thing he thought was unfixable about him wasn't wrong after all. He wasn't
"Have you lost your damned mind?"
Thor just blinked at him then started talking about some seasonal Asgardian festivity where a most splendid occasion was always had by all.
"You're doing a shit job of proving me wrong," Tony assured them from the safety and security of Steve's embrace. Steve bit back a 'Language!' and instead pressed a light kiss to the top of Tony's head, and both Sam and Bucky stared at them with matching looks of annoyance and disgust.
to start trending."
It turned out some people
Bruce had already snuck out, and Tony carefully disentangled himself from the slumbering little sprog and tucked a pillow under her head as he got up, and he found a blanket somewhere and draped it over her, telling JARVIS quietly to keep the movie playing at a low tone because it was probably helping her to sleep.
"No, I won't hold that against him. I'll hold against him that he was a perverted creep with a weird bondage fetish."
God, he was a mess! He was as slick as he'd been the previous night when he and Steve had done their little play-act, and he was certain some of it had already gotten on the bed sheets. He pushed his head back against the pillow and bit his other fist as he tried to keep his moans to himself. He needed a dildo or something. A vibrator. He couldn't get his hand at the right angle to tend to his vagina and his clit at the same time. Goddamn it, why'd he have to be so fucking
"No," Tony said. "Just…thinking." He shook his head again to clear his thoughts then said a firm, "Maria."
"OK, first of all, that is a terrible attitude to take toward
He frowned at her tone. "That…doesn't sound like you're implying it to be a good thing."
"Yeah, guy was never very good with tact like that. Don't think he's ever heard the phrase 'letting 'em down easy.'"
He dropped his hand and reached out to grab his mug of coffee, and as he swallowed a gulp of hot liquid, Tony said, "Hey, if you put that baby back in her crib, I can give you all the help you want rubbing those nipples."
"Shoot."
Hill nodded and turned to leave, and Tony called after her, "Make sure they put some fruit in it! And one of those little straws! Make it look like a real drink!"
He swallowed but didn't say anything, and he felt a puff of breath hit his chest as though the man in his arms had let out a silent laugh.
"No, I don't."
"I saw you give a
Steve nodded then folded his arms and said, "And when the formula doesn't work out and you run out of the milk?"
"Yeah," she said around her last mouthful of food. "But Anna Tasha promised she'd show me how to beat up bad guys the next time I stayed over!"
"Fine, Brucie!" he said and turned to make his way out of Bruce's lab. "See you on the other side."
"I still do."
we're together, Tony. It's fine for you to go out with Maria and Natasha and Pepper. There's nothing there to raise eyebrows about. But not us, and besides, there're already questions being asked about Tony Stark's mysterious disappearance from the limelight. Iron Man still puts in appearances, but Tony Stark hasn't been seen in, what, two months? If I'm seen in public — on a date — with someone that they think is
Barton shrugged. "The hormones clouding up your system now, I wouldn't be a bit surprised."
Steve didn't even give the impression of trying to fight that insinuation. He just took a deep inhale of breath and pushed further into the bathroom.
"You're metabolizing it faster than you should."
," he said, though he knew the tone was slightly mocking, and Tony knew it, too, if the petulant 'humph' was anything to go by. "I think it's… I wasn't a big guy most of my life. I ran the risk of getting stepped on more than I did stepping on anyone. I understand what it's like. I… I don't know, I
"How?" Steve asked and folded his arms. "Explain to me how it's different."
"Anyway," Sam said, pulling Steve out of his thoughts, "so clearly you don't think any of us are good enough to take charge of your precious little magic baby in the event of your early demise —"
And then, because God hated him, Tony leveled him with a probing look and said, "Have you ever been in love, Steve?"
Steve just heaved a sigh and said, "
. That's a reason to
wonder if the bastard wouldn't know it if it bit him in the ass. I think he's afraid to be happy or feel happy or let himself relax. He doesn't think he deserves it. Thinks he's still got something to prove to somebody. I don't know who. You stare at him with those big doe-eyes of yours like you see your entire world in him, and I don't think he… I don't think he gets that. I don't think he sees it. I don't think he lets himself see it. I don't know why. I mean, there must be a part of him that's firing on all cylinders because he was smart enough to marry you, and Steve was never the type of guy to just settle. Steve wanted the perfect partner. He didn't want to waste his time with anyone else."
"We don't speak 'crazy,'" Tony said, and she smiled warmly, almost fondly at him.
"What look?"
"Who?" Bruce asked, but Tony said, "Uh, J, run a scan on our guest. Make sure she's at least human."
"No," Bruce said and waved off his concern. "I'm ninety-nine-point-nine percent sure you're fine. I just want to make absolutely certain you're fine."
"Yeah?" Tony said, and light humor was replaced by genuine interest. "And how's your friend Clint doing?"
When it was over and they all had stepped back behind the curtain to assess the situation, he smiled up at Steve and said, "See? Was that so bad?"
Tony grinned at her and pulled away from Rhodey, and he led her over to the fridge and said, "Sure, baby girl. What do you want? You want your juice? J, you ordered that juice for me, didn't you?"
He opened his eyes and glanced over the scant items cluttered over the sink. There were two toothbrushes in a ceramic holder, one a translucent red and one a translucent blue. It was either muscle memory or instinct that had him reaching for the blue one, and he opened the mirror above the sink and pulled out the tooth paste — or he thought it was toothpaste. He had to stop and read the label first. 'Total.' 'Advanced.' 'Whitening.' 'Fluoride.' Sure didn't look like anything he knew Colgate had on the market. He unscrewed the cap and squirted some onto the brush then put the tube back and went about the process of brushing his teeth, expecting the usual wretched taste but actually finding the minty flavor a pleasant surprise. Again, didn't taste like anything he knew Colgate had on the market.
Steve shrugged and swallowed his bite before he said, "Seriously, Tony, don't— Whatever you're planning,
"What?" Pepper asked, panic suddenly covering her face.
"—and he doesn't smell like this."
And explode they did.
The penthouse became, in those weeks, a revolving door of Avengers and cohorts, popping in under the guise of 'helping' when really all they wanted to do was play with and cuddle with the baby. Which wasn't the worst thing in the world. Having other people there to pick up the slack allowed Tony some much-needed time to himself — even if he, for whatever reason, couldn't stand to be away from the baby for long. And it was also funny watching the others argue over who was or would be the favorite aunt or uncle, Wilson and Barnes, no surprise, being the most vehement in their disagreements. Barton, weirdly enough, was the most at ease with a baby in his arms, cradling her and feeding her with a bottle like he was an old pro, and when Tony shot him a perplexed look one time, Barton just shrugged and said, "They train you for everything."
if it were?" Bruce said, side-eyeing him, sounding a little hesitant.
Steve just gave him that patented
"Now, Tony, it's not the size that matters—"
"That it was a girl," Tony said without fanfare and motioned to the baby cuddled in Rhodey's arms. "That she was a girl."
"Not that," Steve cut in before Tony could finish. "Just a nap. You and me. You can even be the big spoon if you want."
Steve nodded again and turned back to the photos.
"So," Doctor Ganford said, "as you can see,
"Want me to carry you?"
," Wilson said through gritted teeth, "we weren't going to say anything about that in front of the Cap?"
It wasn't until halfway through the song that he suddenly realized what the oh-so-familiar tune was — that first song they'd ever danced to, before they'd been SteveandTony and had just been 'Steve' and 'Tony.'
"—after this…not so great breakup I had with—" He stopped short and forced a clipped smile at Steve. "Doesn't matter. Anyway, it was just…sex. It didn't mean anything. It was easier, I guess, but it wasn't the same."
like?"
"I can see that," Barnes said. "Another reason I kind of…" He laughed and said, "Jesus, I could imagine, he got himself a girl, the first time she asked him if something made her look fat—"
Now, Tony had every intention of working on some projects that afternoon, but Steve made an off-handed mention of going down to the gym to get a workout in, and Tony decided that watching Steve get all hot and sweaty was a much more enticing prospect than actually
"Don't worry about it. It's nothing."
He dabbed at the stain, frowning, and Olivia continued to stuff pieces of chicken and fruit into her mouth. Steve reached out and brushed his hand over the top of her head, the wispy blonde hair sticking up some in its wake.
," and got up from his chair.
"I kept tryin' to set him up with girls," Barnes just said. "Kept hoping one of them would… That he could settle down with one of them. I knew he was…like that. He'd deny it, but I knew he was. Finally came straight out one day and just told him I knew he was deviant. Looked like a fucking deer caught in the headlights. He tried to talk his way around it — he's always trying to do shit like that — but I told him it didn't bother me. I didn't give a shit. He hadn't put a move on me up to that point, so I knew he wasn't going to try anything after that. Never did. Asked him once if he thought of me like that — looked at me like that. Said he didn't. Saw me too much like a brother."
"And you didn't ask me to stay. You asked Nat."
it's a boy—
taller than he was. He wasn't a fucking giant like Thor or the Hulk.
Bruce laughed then said, "Give me twenty-four hours of peace."
"Hmm?"
"Uh, I was thinking more about the 'dizzy' part."
"Tony," Bruce said, pleading and nervous.
Steve's eyes narrowed at that. "For what?"
"Oh, right. Um, funny story that I never told you about. Uh, couple months ago, you remember that thing down in the Financial District that we had to—? Yeah? No? Anyway, in the middle of it, this cosmic crazy shows up looking for Thor, but she found me instead, and I guess that was good enough for her and she thought that no one had fucked with my life in a while, and I was overdue, so she kind of turned me into a woman."
He snorted a laugh. "You fucking kidding me? I wouldn't even know where to
with Steve. Yes, most guys would take that as a huge insult — Tony knew he sure as hell would have — but he didn't know how else to describe it. He felt
They broke the kiss as the car behind them sounded its horn to alert them to the change of light, and as Steve pulled the car through the intersection, Tony turned to Bruce and said, "You're going to miss us when we're gone, you know."
"Probably has star-spangled come."
Yeah. Hormones. Not the fact that his husband was dead. "Already knows what he's going to waste it on, huh?"
Tony just blinked at him then said, "OK, first of all, the term is 'old lady,' and second, you're not an aging hippy getting stoned to Cheech and Chong records."
"If that nutcase ever comes back, I'd say her. Until then…how mouthy has Barton been lately?"
"Yeah, you know what I'm talking about."
Bruce smiled at him a little. "Probably as much as you do."
"No," he countered, "I think it's definitely
He shrugged some and dragged the tip of his spoon through the melting tub of gelato. "Only ever worried about how to prevent it, to be honest."
"Tony, that's not—"
. Being changed back sounded so…permanent. Sure, he wanted to go back to being the man that he was, he supposed, but at the same time, he didn't want to lose
"Are you avoiding answering the question?"
"What?" he asked before he could help himself. "What can't we—?"
"Yeah," Steve said, sounding like he'd finally resigned himself to admitting that Tony was right, "or…
Barnes opened his mouth to no doubt snap something right back, but Steve got there first with a disappointed, "Hey! Watch your language," which made both Barnes and Wilson turn on him in surprise and confusion.
," Steve said in that stupid, soft voice that he used when Tony was being unreasonable about things, "they like hanging out here with us."
"Want me to make sure to toss it in your direction?" he asked as Thor nodded for them to follow after him.
. Seven years ago, Stevie. Seven years. The grand total of all your relationships since then have amounted to—" He looked at Sam. "What'd we figure?"
Steve tensed up beside him, and Tony sat up and turned his attention to Thor. "What are you talking about, big guy?"
soon," and pulled himself out of bed.
Tony glared at him a moment then grabbed the clipboard out of Steve's hand. "Fine," he muttered and pulled the pen out from where it had been tucked up at the top. "Name? That's easy," he said and scrawled down 'Natasha Carbonell.' "Soc? Shit. I can't use my real one, can I?"
Tony just hummed and shrugged, grabbing some flour to rub over the rolling pin, his eyes still on his tablet. "She has your appetite and probably your metabolism. I wouldn't be surprised."
"Steve Rogers is pretty useless though, I take it?"
"I do not understand," Thor said with a frown. "I have not heard of this famous Native of Midgard. Why might our brother Tony make him cry?"
Tony shoved half the hash brown in his mouth. "I ghet ih, Stebe. Yowr sowwy. Y' don' hafta keep w'peatin' ih ev'ry time ah turn awound."
does this woman look so much like Tony Stark? Is she a long-lost sister? A cousin? Or maybe — just maybe — Tony Stark got turned into a woman against his will and
"A birthing class," Steve said and reached for his tablet. "I was reading online—"
Tony took a breath and looked up at Steve, who was staring at him in a way that was meant to be comforting but actually looked a little squeamish on his part. He put a hand on Steve's forearm as though to calm the nerves that hadn't settled, and said, "Trust me, babe. This is my element. This is what I excel at, all right? I called a press conference as soon as I got back from Afghanistan and told the world I was shutting down the weapons manufacturing division of my company. I told the world I was Iron Man after one front-page incident. In both of those cases, I'd almost died right before that. Here? I know I complain, but this
He nodded and said, "Positive," then kissed Tony's forehead again.
Tony just blinked at him. "Are you trying to say I'm covering up my real feelings for him?" "I'm trying to say that you keep telling yourself that you don't like the guy beyond wanting him to…" He made a gesture at Tony that he guessed he was supposed to take as wanting Cap to suck him off. "But clearly, it's a lot more than that."
"Hell yeah! Stevie, I love you, but you're an idiot. Someone's got to make sure you're not doing something stupid like…throwing yourself out of a plane without a parachute."
tell you not to tell Steve?"
"Even when I had nothing, I had Bucky, and I just— I can't leave him."
Sam heaved out a sigh. "Look, man, all I know is what happened afterward. He showed up on the doorstep at three o'clock in the morning looking like a drowned rat because it was pouring raining, and all he wanted to know was what he did wrong. And a head's up that you were going to do this might have been nice, you know? Buck and I were as confused as he was. Thankfully, he did most of the talking. I don't even think he realized neither Buck or I ever gave him an answer."
"I guess," Steve murmured and bent his head to brush his lips against her crown once again. "Thank you."
No. That didn't… No, that wasn't— The mannerisms, the photographs, the kind-of-looks-like-a-dark-haired-Steve-if-you-squint…
"Huh?" he asked and stopped in the middle of the living room area. Now, if he were the Cap, where would he keep his art supplies?
"I didn't realize they made 'blankets' in sock or boxer shapes."
"Principle of the thing, Steven. We're out here all alone, and I don't care if you are Captain America. Blood-thirsty murders don't care, either. They only care that we're a cute, young couple out here by our lonesome and will make great Innocent-Victim Stew."
"Yeah, all right," he muttered, and Steve patted his arm and then was off. "And a swizzle stick!" he called out as Steve made for the bar, raising his hand and giving him a thumb's up to signify that he heard him.
? Doesn't that one guy look
," Barton said.
He groaned a little and rolled his eyes. "What I'm saying is I was infatuated with an image, not the man behind the image. I didn't
"Sure you don't.
Steve raised an eyebrow at him. "You're handling this quite well."
"Hmm…" he said as he crunched on the drywall shavings. "Not the worst thing in the world," he told his sleeping daughter. "Milk adds kind of a sweetness to it. Still think I'm going to chip a tooth, and I'm trying really,
"Uh…I think it's a human fetus."
Another muffled groan from Steve. "
But Steve just shot him a pointed and knowing look and said, "Tony, if Bruce doesn't want to—"
. I don't know how much longer we can keep doing that, but trust me. Eleven-out-of-ten, would totally do again. But if you promise not to tell anyone, I'll tell you why I started crying."
Steve just frowned at him, and Tony exhaled a breath and said, "You'll understand eventually." He took another gulp of coffee, and he reached out and grabbed some sort of rectangular instrument, which he pointed at the screen on the wall. The picture and the sound cut out immediately, the screen turning black, and Tony tossed the implement back onto the table and turned his attention to Steve.
Tony patted his arm. "Monty Python. Americans love it. Clearly the idiots we live with are the rule and not the exception. You probably picked it up through osmosis. So," he said and pushed closer to the island, "Hydra's in the business of taking down the electrical grid now."
They never did have a party for him, and Steve clearly had known all along what Tony was pulling with the room-painting, as once Steve had finished and had pulled all the tape off the trim and the plastic up from the carpet covering the floor, he motioned to a wall and said, "That one would probably be better to set the crib against. Gets more indirect sunlight. That would probably be better for him, don't you think?"
even possible? How could they both have stumbled into alternate universe versions of themselves — and presumably from the same universe?
"Power's coming back on in the city in spurts," she said and sat down on the chair adjacent to him. "Which is good because I think we're in violation of our maximum occupancy."
Rhodey just scoffed and said a dismissive, "
"And would you be OK with doing that?" Tony asked, not taking his gaze from Steve's face.
Tony just groaned and fell back against the pillow. "I trust you. I was just tested recently. I'm good. But I trust you. Now just fuck me already. Jesus."

And if it was a boy, then what the hell was Bruce aiming for with all that talk of
stormed past to make his way to the stairs. "Why the fuck is there not a bathroom on this floor?" he muttered and sucked in a deep breath before he steeled himself to make the climb up to the second floor of the penthouse.
But Thor just raised a hand and smiled gently. "Aye, the Man of Iron is with child."
"What?" Steve asked, not seeming to understand Barnes's comment.
No, you're not making it
She stopped typing and glared at him. "
Tony glared at him. "Are you fucking kidding me?"
have been helping set up the makeshift hospital, he also knew he wouldn't be any good to anyone at the moment. So, he did what he always did when he couldn't concentrate on anything else and his mind wouldn't relax enough to allow him peace and quiet. He tinkered.
Romanoff shrugged. "It's been working well for them so far."
She nestled into the pillows and said a petulant, "No, 'm
She grimaced and shrugged her shoulders a little and said, "
Not that this was enough to pull him away from his work. Even Bruce couldn't get him to make headway to his lab, and he blatantly ignored Bruce's concerned, "
Tony hummed a little as Steve sat back on his heels, and he blinked and took in his surroundings, finding himself in Tony's workshop in the tower. Oh, right. Yeah. That's where they were. He'd kind of forgotten where they'd been the past several minutes, his mind totally and completely set on just, well — god, he hated to say it, but his mind totally and completely set on fucking Tony. That hadn't been 'making love' — not as he understood it, anyway. That had been totally and completely about fucking Tony.
Steve just shot a pointed look at him. "Speakers."
He slumped against the door of the stall, and he looked down at the streaks of come that covered his hand, and he was so goddamned lucky he was already spent because his immediate thought was to have Tony, on his knees and still bound, lick his hand clean. Five minutes ago, that thought alone would have had him coming in his pants like a teenager. He banged the back of his head against the door and muttered a quiet, "
"Yeah, really sounds like you believed that," Tony muttered, but Steve seemingly ignored him and went back to pleading with Bucky.
He reached up to Tony's face with his other hand, and Tony rolled his head into Steve's touch. He thought then of those horribly...possessive...thoughts that had come to mind while he'd been...doing what he'd been doing...and he swallowed again and took a breath and tried not to think of Tony as just an object for his pleasure. Not that they didn't dabble in that sort of thing, and not that Steve hadn't had those sorts of thoughts before, but there was something different about it this time. Something a little less...consensual about it in his mind, and that was definitely not a path he wanted to tread down.
Steve had done his best to keep that deep, dark part of himself hidden from sight from the moment that he realized that part of him existed. It was a moral failing, a character flaw, one so damaging that even the serum quite obviously couldn't fix it. The serum had fixed everything else about him, but it hadn't fixed
Lucky little brat. God, was she lucky she was cute.
Steve exhaled a breath and opened his mouth to look at Tony.
Steve, caught out, didn't even try to hide it. He just smiled a little, his cheeks flushing just the slightest as he said, "I always wanted to do that. Ask the bandleader to play a song for me and my date to dance to."
Steve went to ask what 'Dummy' or his (its?) chassis was, but Tony continued as they made their way back into the living room.
"Guess he hasn't changed much?"
Rhodey moved over to his side, slowly, like he was still trying to assess the situation before him. "He said your
"Look," Steve said, hands on his hips and jaw set, "if you would just
(He was pretty sure that Maria had borne him back before 'natural childbirth' had been a thing. She'd probably been drugged to hell when she'd delivered him. He wasn't even sure if Howard had felt his birth enough of a priority to spend a few pointless hours in a waiting room.)
But Rhodey put his hands up and said, "I'm just saying. It's probably not as bad as it seems."
"Pepper-pot, I'm listening!"
He went to take a step toward the kitchen, but his bladder had other ideas, and he went upstairs to relieve himself first then came back down and padded into the kitchen.
"You know I don't care. I love you both ways. I love you either way. Anthony Edward. Antonia Natasha. You're still the same person underneath it all. You're still the same person I asked to marry me. I only want you to be happy and safe and protected."
He made sure to steady himself then continued, "That was— It happened— It was a while ago, Brucie. Two years ago now. I'm not— I don't even think about it. I don't even care."
"Sometimes I don't know why I even bother," he muttered, but Tony knew he was talking not about discussing things with Tony but looking for Barnes.
"Hmm? What? Yeah, uh—"
. He wasn't sure where Steve had disappeared to now — he thought he remembered something about training with other Natasha and Wilson — and he wasn't exactly in a place where he could take care of any wanton desires that might come of thinking of that harsh and grasping utterance that had made him almost cry out with desperate yearning—
Tony exchanged a look with Steve, who maneuvered so that Tony could get in on the cake- cutting, and Tony sighed and put his hand atop Steve's where he had a hold of the knife and said, "Will this suffice?"
A little unsteady, he got up on his knees and crawled between Tony's legs. Tony made a face at how uncomfortably wet and sticky he was there, but Steve just reached and took him by the underside of his thighs and pushed his stocking-clad legs back and away, spreading him open wide.
"You keep talking about bonds," Bruce said as he munched on his muesli. "What does that mean? How did Steve and Tony even get bonded in the first place?"
"There is a perfectly good gym for you to use!" Tony said, flabbergasted that grown adults —
Steve shrugged at him. "We'll start there."
The others departed after they'd finished stuffing themselves, leaving Steve and Tony alone again, and evidently the gang suspected they were itching to reignite the marital relations that had gone stagnant over the course of the past several weeks, as the group of them had all concurred with Barton when he'd said, "Hey, if you need us to take her off your hands for a while…"
"Who else's do you think it would be?"
Unfortunately, Natasha seemed to sense something about his words or his tone as well, as the look she gave him was equal parts bland and soft — which meant she was concerned but was trying not to show it. Tony ignored her and instead reached out to grab a slice of toast but frowned when he saw it was plain with neither jelly nor butter to show for it.
He huffed a little and said, "Because Steve and I are 'soul mates.'" Again, he used finger quotes on the expression. "And as 'soul mates,' it is our job to 'be fruitful and multiply.' Can't do that in my other body without some help so—"
Steve shot him a very,
Tony just made a 'hmm' sound and rocked a little in the chair. "Nothing to it, really. My body seemed to know what to do more than Bruce did. I listened to my body more than Bruce."
Barnes just looked at Tony and said, "You poor, poor bastard," with a sad shake of his head.
"Fine. We'll go get your time machine, and we'll hop on back to 1940 and grab ice cream at the soda fountain."
"Uh, hey, Tones?" Rhodey said, sounding slightly hesitant.
Steve kept his gaze locked with Tony's. He didn't believe him about Bucky. It was his fault Bucky had died. No matter what Peggy said, the report was what mattered, and the report said...
He pushed maybe once or twice after that before Bruce was telling him
"Papa?" she asked, her little voice choked.
Steve just glared at him a little, jaw set and teeth gritted together, but Tony saw in his eyes something that looked a lot like resignation — like he knew Tony was right but that didn't mean he had to be happy about it.
Other Tony arched an eyebrow. "Like?"
Steve just nodded at him, and Tony put his finger to his lips to shush him then motioned him over to the nursery. He pushed the door open slowly, cringing as the hinges creaked, but he still motioned Steve in behind him. Steve followed, taking his steps as quietly as he could, and they crept over to the crib.
Tony nodded, staring down at the baby a moment before he realized what Steve had said, and he looked up quickly at him, frowning, something uncomfortable twisting in his stomach.
Though he'd be lying if he didn't admit there was a weird, awkward air between him and Howard the next time he saw him, and some months later, after he'd put the plane into a nosedive and promised Peggy — sweet, wonderful Peggy, who he could now say had soft lips and smelled like heaven — a date that they both knew would never come, when the water was rushing in and sweeping him up in its power and majesty, the last thing he heard, his last conscious thought, was a distant but comforting voice telling him,
Barnes was silent a beat before he said a quiet, "No."
Tony sat down on the couch, and Steve followed, making sure to sit a proper distance away from him. Tony raised an eyebrow at this and, noting the amount of space between them, said, "I'm going to assume it's because you don't know who I am and not because you think I have cooties or something."
You literally ran out of the room this morning right as it came time to start cleaning up the mess that
"How do you know it?" Bruce asked and sat down at the chair beside the worktable.
It didn't mean anything. Honest.
a boy-band now. Maybe we're more like the Cowsills or the Partridge Family now or something?"
"No," he admitted.
"I was reading—"
Steve just nodded once. "If I ever get caught up with Hydra, I firmly expect the first friendly face I see to be Iron Man storming the gates."
back. Now all he needs is his Peggy Carter — oh, and maybe the Stark he actually liked. You know, my asshole father. Fuck," he said and laughed, "I'm like a universal replacement! Lost your best pal? Here, have a Tony Stark. Lost your girl? Here, have a Tony Stark. Lost your Howard Stark? Here, have a Tony Stark. Has more defects, and it's not as good as the 'Howard' model, but it should hold you over for a while."
Steve hummed in thought and said, "But that's my point. I couldn't have done better than you. I would have been…" He exhaled a breath and shook his head. "I know I couldn't have handled it anywhere near as well as you did, and that…that amazes me.
Tony heard a note of hope in his voice, and he reached over and patted Steve's leg. "I know how much you hate these things, but no, Captain. The people want to meet Captain America. They spent good, hard-earned— All right, they spent money on it. We've got to give them their money's worth."
"Thanks," Steve said, not entirely sure if that was a compliment or not. He assumed it was because Jim overall seemed to like him and think he and Tony were good together.
Tony nodded. "Square deal."
"Tony, come on!" He turned back to his tablet. "They have all sorts of suggestions for things you can do—"
"No," Steve said and steered him over to the passenger side. "I let you drive, we'll end up detouring through who-knows-where, and then, well, look at that! We missed the show."
Steve conceded this then said, "All right, on the count of three. One… Two… Three—"
Barnes shrugged. "Can't complain."
Steve reached up and pulled Tony's hand away. "Not in this body, I haven't."
"What?" Steve asked with a nervous laugh. "I'm just saying when you first, er, became like that, they were really nice, and now they're kind of, uh…"
He looked over the form once more to make sure he'd answered what he was comfortable answering then said, "OK, I'm done."
"Is anything I said untrue? Are you really going to sit there and deny you're Steve's princess and he's not up there right now giving Thor the third-degree over whether that space-broad that did this to you is really dead and if there's anyone else that could change you back or turn back time to stop this from happening in the first place?"
even think of bringing up his come! That's completely different!"
He waited one long, painful moment before Steve said, "All right," and Tony grinned and jumped up to kiss him, but he forgot that he was still controlling the armor, and instead, Iron Man grabbed Steve by the face and smacked his facial slit against Steve's mouth, and Steve made a slightly strangled sound before he pulled back and rubbed his nose and said, "Maybe you might want to watch how you handle that thing."
He shot a pointed look at him. "I'll be fine. We'll both be fine. Go see if they need help. I can— I'll manage."
I am anymore."
"What? 'Shit,' really? 'Shit' is off-limits?"
"Tony—"
"Every year," Tony just said and leaned over to peck a kiss against Steve's cheek.
. He had to make sure he got his money's worth.
He just shook off Barton's comments and turned back to Bruce. "No. There's nothing…"
the child of that other person in the relationship?
"Well, I didn't want to chance it," Tony said and eyed over his bare left hand. "My hands look fat. Are they fat?"
"Honestly, big green, I'd really rather be alone right now. Just for a little while, OK? Like, I don't know, ten minutes. Just give me ten minutes."
Well, except that one dream, but that didn't count, as even in the dream, Steve was quite clearly the father. And even in the week that it could have even happened, he could say with absolute certainty Steve was the only one that had been inside of him.
He set the glass down and looked at Steve, who was busy inspecting his glass as he smacked his lips like he was trying to identify what he'd just tasted.
But he loved him enough to let him go.
"That's not what I mean," Tony said.
"Jesus, Stark, why don't you marry him already?" he mused aloud with a small laugh and wiped at the stupid fucking tears that were collecting in his eyes again. Jesus Christ, talk about an emotional fucking roller coaster.
Bruce blew out a breath and shoved his hands in his pockets. "Kinda wish I'd gotten some to test."
Barton just sighed and rolled his eyes and said, "I need a vacation. After this, I'm getting out of here for a bit, OK? Tell your husband, if he's still talking to you after this."
talk with his therapist after this. Was Bruce busy?
the baby, and I just— We'd have all this stuff hanging around, all this stuff that would remind us, and—" He shook his head again. "No. No one's buying anything. No one's throwing any baby showers for anyone — at least not until after the baby's born."
And then he started making a fake snoring sound, and Tony rolled his eyes and shoved another spoonful of gelato in his mouth.
"You are both old souls that have been though many incarnations together," she cut in before he could muse any more about her being their galactic PA. "You both miss something terribly in those rare lifetimes that you spend apart."
"Not all of you," she said with a flat smile, but Tony could tell by her tone that she'd been on the receiving end of such comments over the years. She directed a knowing look at Barton and said, "There is a time and a place."
Steve made a face. "Well, not— Not
"Yeah, it would," Steve said without a beat.
It was not difficult to see how he had fallen in love with this man. What he felt for Peggy — and he'd known her for a good year-and-a-half now — felt forced in comparison. Oh, he did like Peggy, and he knew, given the time, he could love her, but he didn't even have to try with Tony. He felt more at peace, more at home with himself with Tony than he'd ever felt with anyone. He didn't have to pretend. He had woken up in a world where he didn't have to hide who he was — quite obviously
Yeah, Tony was going to have to figure out what this Iron Cap was pretty soon. A toy of some kind, he figured. Captain America in an Iron Man costume, maybe? Which was fucking stupid. "Yeah," he said, sidestepping the Iron Cap thing for the moment, "but you're sleepy."
He rolled his eyes and ignored that part, shoving half of the remaining doughnut in his mouth. He chewed and said, "It's the principle of the thing. Why now? Why today?" He reached out and took the mug of coffee Steve was offering to him, and startled a bit when he realized what Steve was doing. "Seriously?" he asked.
Tony turned to Bruce and Rhodey. "Sound familiar to either one of you?"
"Eh, you gotta narrow it down," Tony said. "Television, newspaper, radio, or blog?"
It was one of those typical jobs with the vinyl seats and the ceramic tabletops that always felt sticky no matter how many times they'd been washed. The lighting was garish considering the fixtures were old incandescents, and even though smoking was banned, there was still a haze of something in the air. Probably grease, as the kitchen was visible beyond the building-length counter with the vinyl-topped barstools. There was either a knock-off Wurlitzer by the side or a retrofitted one, which was currently playing something that was definitely old enough to be a member of AARP if not collect Social Security.
"Tony, come on."
"Honey?" he said, his voice a little wobbly, "we're in public. Maybe you should tone down the PDAs, huh?"
, almost, that it should happen this way — that Steve should die and a child be born in his stead. And not just any child but his own flesh and blood. The father had died, but a daughter had been born into this world to take his place. He thought about what Esmeralda had said — about bondmates and the desire to breed with one another — and he still thought it was stupid, but…
And then he thought about going home after the war, back to Brooklyn and back to… Back to what?
"Really know how to stoke a man's ego," he muttered and got up to dig some glasses out of the cabinet.
"Well, I don't think it would be such a
, and hit the little send arrow, leaving it at that. He knew what Barton was asking what he was right about, but damned if he'd allow Barton the courtesy to even think Tony knew what he was talking about.
But Tony had actually been looking for an opportunity to try it because, well, he was horny as fuck, Steve was amazing at driving him mad with pleasure, and, well, he wanted to.
"Not sure if that follows for chocolate milkshakes," Tony said and set the shake down before he picked up his burger and took a large, savory bite.
The smile wiped clean off Barnes's face. "Tony," he said slowly, like he was trying to gently remind Tony of something he should have already known, "Steve's not coming home."
"That didn't sound like a question," Sam replied as he continued to cradle Olivia. "You said you were gonna ask."
Steve made a 'hmm' sound and said, "From what I saw, we seem to do OK. At least for a little while."
"Oh, boy."
He sat back in his seat and hummed in thought then said, "It's sort of like… Think of it like the wire service. It's an exchange of information, cat pictures, and pornography."
He tried to determine which was technically a better fit, and when he ended up going in circles, he shook his head and continued his thought.
"Kinda," he said with a squeamish smile. "Yeah."
"Do you
Tony nodded down to where he continued to nurse Olivia, and Steve continued to frown.
Steve kissed his temple again and rubbed his side, and Tony's stomach grumbled again. He put a hand to just above the swell of his abdomen and said, "Oh, right."
Steve just shook his head and got up. "I'll go do rounds. Try not to let too many people make off with precious artifacts while I'm gone."
Though Tony knew it was a complete coincidence, he got nothing but a shot in the ribs at that, and he smiled a bit bemusedly at Steve and said, "I really think he told you to go fuck yourself."
"Sorry, you're stuck with the Irish kid from Brooklyn."
Tony shrugged and moved over to the couch to sit down. "Not everyone should be a parent," he said and motioned for Steve to sit down beside him. He followed, flute glass still in his hand. "But I guess not everyone knows that ahead of time. I'm sure he did, but I don't think he really gave a shit."
"This," he said and made the motion again. "All of this is because of you." He pointed to Steve at that, and Steve raised an eyebrow. "My reputation is shot all thanks to you."
there was also what looked a little like... shame? Embarrassment?
"Fuck you! They're called 'shoe lifts,' and a lot of guys wear them!" Tony yelled back to him. "Not all of us are six-foot super soldiers."
He wasn't sure if the bump he felt against his rib was a 'Yes' or a 'Fuck you, Pops.' Weirdly, he presumed it to be the latter.
"What are you talking about?"
"That sounds
person she hasn't actually talked about is golden-boy Cap, who, from what I can gather, is too good to hang out with our little band of heroes."
"The lab experiment from the '40s?" Barton finished for him.
"Wait, Pep's in town and she didn't even bother to say hello to me?" Tony asked and didn't even try to hide his affront.
"Yeah."
you're trying to figure out some way to fix this, but there's nothing
But Tony just shrugged and said, "Well, if we're being honest—"
. Like an actual book or a
Tony took several breaths and closed his eyes, letting himself be soothed by the calming strokes of Steve's thumbs against his cheeks.
He bent his head and brushed a gentle kiss against Tony's lips, his hand moving from Tony's chin to gently cradle the back of his head. Tony hadn't brushed his teeth yet, but Steve didn't seem to mind, holding Tony's head gently as he pecked and nipped gentle kisses at Tony's mouth.
"Yeah, but I had a fucking metal suit to protect me, and you—"
But he was definitely
restraints and skimpy clothing. Cap's all for seeing his princess half-naked and tied to the bed."
Was he still a 'fella'? Did he still consider himself a 'fella'? He still used masculine pronouns to refer to himself, but forty-four years of conditioning would do that to a person no matter the fact his current body was
"Like what?" she asked, her tone surprisingly nurturing and completely devoid of judgment.
trying not to think about that right now — but
Tony shushed him, continuing the stroking motions against his face. He thought it odd for only a moment that he was the one in trouble and yet here he was comforting Steve over it.
And Mr. Barnes would probably string him up the next time he saw him. He couldn't say he blamed him.
keep your voice down?"
He actually wasn't ready until quarter-after-six, dressed in the most chic and sophisticated maternity wear his ill-gotten gains could buy, a splash of makeup on his face (he really,
Barnes still looked sincerely confused by Tony's concern. "I've told you before. I was always afraid Steve would never find someone that…appreciated him for who he was. You
"Yeah," Rhodey said without questioning Wilson's description of him.
'Natasha,' though Tony got the feeling those were mostly people that fantasized about somehow hooking up with Steve themselves. And then there was a very small but loyal band of supporters there were absolutely crushed that their #Superhusbands were no more. Which, honestly, was kind of a weird tag, especially considering that, according to Natasha, it clearly predated his and Steve's marriage back in April…that no one outside of them, the city clerk, and a small band of deputy clerks even knew about.
He went over to the dresser, and he pulled open a drawer and dug through for a t-shirt or something she could wear. All he seemed to have at the moment were vintage band shirts, and with a heavy heart, he pulled one out and closed the drawer.
Tony shrugged and poured a cup of coffee for both himself and Rhodey.
Steve sat up some and set the tablet on the coffee table. "All right," he said, the tone pure authoritative Captain America, "then how do we handle this? It's not safe, we've established that, but it's not easy to remedy, either."
She stuck the glob of cheese in her mouth and began to chew, and Tony added the names to the ever-growing list of people he might have to deal with in the future. He was still pretty sure she was from another dimension.
"Wait, what?"
"The middle of the night!" he said after a moment. "The goddamned middle of the night, they just sneak out of town like a bunch of ne'er-do-wells—"
"Uh…and, who else— Wasn't there an Arnie guy for a while?"
Steve nodded, slowly, and set the Santa cutter down. "I see," he said, not really sure how to take what Tony was saying.
From fucking Barton, of all people.
"Yeah."
"Who says I want to?"
"Yes, really," she replied, taking Olivia into her arms. "Oh, my god! Look at that face!" she said as she cradled the baby. "I think she's actually disappointed about something."
Olivia fell back against him again after losing her balance trying to pull on another box that was bigger than she was. Mug in hand, he stuck the bagel in his mouth and helped her get back up, and she toddled right on back to the presents and began tearing and ripping again.
Tony sat back a little and raised an eyebrow. "Mean for me to
"Really?" Bucky asked, a similar squeamish look to Jim's on his face.
"Wednesday."
Tony snuffled again and said, "I don't know if I should be thrilled or horrified that my boyfriend just threatened to beat up my dead father."
"She wasn't ten pounds—"
"That admittedly bears a resemblance to Tony Stark," Tony said.
"Just someone get him on the 'jet!" he yelled and took off after the half-track. When he got close enough, he hovered and tried to take it out with the chest R/T, but one of the imbeciles in the vehicle spotted him and aimed a shot at him, and all the power cut out of the suit.
"Thor," Steve said, ceasing his struggles and trying again for more 'Captain America' than 'Steve Rogers,' "I'm ordering you to put me down."
Steve just stared and nodded, and he took another sip of orange juice. He set the container down on the counter, walked over to Tony, took the sandwich out of his hands and set it aside, and then swept him into his arms like he was going to pull one of those big, sweeping, romantic kisses, Tony bent backwards with Steve's arms securely around him.
Tony slammed his hand down on the table, only now remembering that he'd impaled it earlier thanks to the throbbing pain it sent up his arm. Fuck, he hoped it wouldn't start bleeding again.
"Or how you stood there for a full minute waiting for them to come back," Rhodey said.
Definitely. That was definitely something he wanted to see this Tony do. He definitely wanted to see those plump red lips stretched around his cock, those dark doe eyes looking up at him, those nimble fingers pressing into his thighs or kneading his sack—
Again, the room went silent at that, and Bruce leaned in close and murmured ever-so-softly to him, "
Tony just rolled his eyes. "
He shrugged some and rested a forearm on the table. "Light whispers, mostly, but they're getting louder. I hear Ms. Potts has scheduled a press conference for tomorrow. You wouldn't be involved in that in any way, would you? Possibly your attempt to lay all the ridiculous rumors to rest?"
"And from how far a height did you fall?"
He shoved the last bite of food in his mouth then went about scraping the plate, and everyone was quiet as he did so until Barton said, "So, did you ever agree on whether it should be 'Sarah Maria' or 'Maria Sarah'?"
Tony turned to him and smiled, pleased by this. "Thank you."
"'bout twelve-thirty," Steve said and grabbed the bag that had their pajamas in it.
"Oh, just finishing up some work that I didn't get to finish before," he said and rubbed her back a little. "Why don't you go back to bed?"
"This kitchen's so…
what I mean."
But Steve swallowed and sat up some more. "No," he said and shook his head some. "It's not."
"I know, but—"
her," Tony finished for him. "It's not, all right? It's a— Steve wants a boy. It's a boy."
, for the
"Yeah," Tony said dumbly as Hill bent over and smiled at the sleeping newborn, cooing at her and reaching out to brush a finger lightly against her cheek.
Tony huffed a little and rolled his eyes but couldn't deny the asshole had a point. Of course there'd be photographs, and of course there'd be unflattering ones, and of
"You drive me nuts."
Barton shrugged again. "The public doesn't know that."
Rhodey closed his eyes and dropped his head, sighing again. "Look, I get after the whole you almost dying from palladium poisoning thing that you want to try out this 'honesty' thing with Pepper, but this was probably one case where maybe you should have kept your mouth shut."
OK, Brucie-boy might have had him there.
Wilson stared at him like he couldn't believe what had just happened, and he shook his head again and said, "
"Mmm…he's such a good husband," he murmured and then grimaced and grunted as he got to his feet. He was feeling better, sure, but that didn't mean he still didn't feel fucking
Tony laughed, tears blurring his sight. "I don't think that'll be necessary."
He ignored the line about the drama. He assumed it was a joke. "Superpowers?" he asked instead. "What, like flying?"
the one without the baggage?"
"So…" Steve said, drawing out his statement like he wanted to make sure he got the words right, "you're enjoying being a woman?"
Tony reached up and patted his chest. "One thing at a time, babe. Kind of still recovering from the whole forced-to-give-birth thing. Still trying to wrap my head around that, not to mention the fact that I'm kind of our child's only source of nourishment at the moment. Once everything dies down and I'm able to form a rational, coherent thought, then maybe I'll… Maybe I'll think about it."
"Yeah, really sounds like she comes from an awful place—"
picky when it comes to sexual satisfaction, so saying Steve is so good at sex he's able to please someone like me is probably the best compliment you've ever given to him."
He holed himself up in his lab and worked on various projects he'd let go over the past couple months. Or he tried to, at any rate. His concentration was a bit lacking, as was his strength reserves — and his wrist still hurt him a bit, but not as much as he thought it should — and, more often than not, he spent the time on the couch, staring at the TV screen ahead of him. At one point, he'd gotten stuck at the classic movie channel and was either too lazy or too down to tell JARVIS to change it. Which mean he suffered through an afternoon of melodramas that had him reluctantly bawling his eyes out. (Hormones. Always and forever blame hormones.) There was the one with the blue-collar girl that got married to the blue-blood, only to end up divorced and pregnant when the family didn't approve of the match. She resolved to keep the baby even with no husband in the picture, but the baby died at birth. Then there was the one about the couple that was getting divorced, and the wife was going through their record collection and recalling fonder times. That one not only featured a miscarriage but an adopted child that ended up dying of some mysterious illness.
"OK," he said with an easy shrug. "I won't tell Steve. Hey, is your buddy Wilson around?"
He finished in the shower about ten minutes later, and he dressed and pulled his hair up into a ponytail, and rather than go back out into the living room and listen to Steve and Barnes — OK, probably just Steve — recall happier times before the war, he curled back into the bed and lay down on his side, tucking the pillow between his legs as the baby suddenly decided it was time for his afternoon workout.
He turned and made his way off the floor, striding away from Tony as fast as he could get, and Tony grinned and glanced up to the floor above where the other three had been watching him the entire time, and he made a motion as though to say,
"They'd want to breed us," Tony said, reminded of that awful dream he'd had at the cabin.
" he cried, his voice doing that screechy thing that he hated so much.
"So, do you agree or disagree?"
Ordinarily, the age JARVIS claimed he physically appeared to be, he would say he, as a woman, had a good ten breeding years left. But if the Goofball Esmeralda could turn him into a fucking woman — and de-age him at that — who was to say she couldn't keep him from aging? Keep him the thirty-six that JARVIS claimed he was? Keep him and continue to breed him with Steve until they had their little army — or they had enough specimens they could breed from that?
Bruce took her hands, and they greeted each other in the very European tradition of a kiss on each cheek (even if the woman's accent
Steve laughed a little, though it was more nervous than humorous. "Tony, we can't. You know that."
"She's hungry," Tony said. "Yeah, holidays are always screwed up. Hasn't had her breakfast yet."
"Oh," Happy said then turned back to his dessert, and Tony and Rhodey exchanged another look before Rhodey said, "He's a little uptight tonight."
Bruce nodded and grabbed a few more supplies then made his way over to where Tony sat at the table. He set the basket of items down and started organizing things, laying out the tubes in the order he wanted to fill them, and Tony frowned and blinked at the number and size of them.
"Yeah, it's a thing that happens. Hey, what time is it where you are?"
painting your little Antonia Stefania-to-be's room. What's that word I used to describe you?"
He smiled down at the baby that was staring up at him with her big, dark eyes. "Daddy didn't carry you for nine months, now did he?"
"Five more minutes."
He grinned and leaned a little closer. "You think Cap takes it that way? Gets on all fours, spreads himself wide, begs for a pounding. You know those overly-macho types are always overcompensating for something."
he's some worthless piece of junk."
"Yep."
Steve lifted Olivia out of the highchair and tucked her into his arm, and with one hand, he uncapped the bottle and, after testing a few drops, stuck the nipple of the bottle in Olivia's mouth.
Bruce smiled at him, a little wry and a little sad. "Because deep down you want to know."
"Coloring." And then her tears were all but forgotten as her voice went all sorts of high and excited and she said, "Wanna see the pitcher I drew, Unca Bruce? It's all the 'vengers."
"Why does it always seem like you're raring to go when I'm ready to settle down?" he muttered at his errant stomach then grabbed a pair of underwear and stepped into them. "Not there ever was a question, but you are
"I'm not saying this because she's a big donor — she's not — she's just a little old lady that wants to say 'hello' again to her idol. She has a picture and everything."
He blinked and shook his head to pull himself out of his soft, happy thoughts — later, he could watch her sleep
Tony rolled his eyes. "I know that, Steve," he muttered. "I'm not
"Tony?" he asked because, well, last he'd known it was Tony that was standing there.
Steve frowned. "That really wasn't my best photo."
Then again, he had seemingly fell in with a rich fella from the city. Of course he'd be able to afford to buy all those sorts of things and live in an area with other rich people that could afford those lights as well. He wasn't sure he'd say it felt like he was betraying his roots, but, well… He did wonder, once again, if he was some perverse form of a kept man.
"Uh, think so. Why?"
"Yeah, I…" She looked back down at his abdomen but trailed off what she, for whatever reason, couldn't bring herself to say.
"Magic," he replied, servos whirring as he dropped his arms and addressed the group.
, would she?
Not just keep it but bear it and care for it and raise it. It might be a little boy with Steve's eyes and his talent for engineering. Or maybe a little girl with his eyes and Steve's knack for getting into trouble. Whatever it was, whoever it was, Tony couldn't help desperately wanting to find out.
had come from, he'd never know.
"Tony, keep your voice down—"
"They won't say anything."
"I'm fine, Steve," he said, not even attempting the professional courtesy they usually kept to over the comms. For some reason, that blast really fucking smarted, and he wanted to hop out of the suit and grab some of that nice, white snow to use as a compress against his hip, but there were still a few goons hiding around, and no one needed to see a female Tony Stark exiting the Iron Man armor.
"Uh…sure?" he said as she bounded into the bed and curled up on the side of the bed that…had once been Pepper's.
Something awoke Tony in the middle of the night. He didn't know what, but he didn't question it, either.
"Wait," Bucky said and turned to Sam. "You mean the tall, hot redhead and the uptight guy that follows her around?"
Normally when he dreamt, he saw himself as he had been for the first forty-three years of his life. As a man. As a man with a flat abdomen and pectorals instead of breasts and nothing that would ever even begin to hint at the fact that he was gestating a child in a womb in his abdomen.
"Buck, I want you—" he was saying as the met up with Tony. "Buck, I want— This is Tony," he said and pulled Barnes so that he and Tony were standing face-to-face. Tony stood as tall as he could and squared his shoulders a bit, and Barnes stared down at him and looked him over with those haunted and somewhat glassy eyes of his and croaked out, "Are you sure?"
"They would," Bruce said, rubbing his forehead like he was nursing a headache. "If Steve was there, they would have pulled the same stuff with him."
"Isn't it? Is it your child, isn't it, Captain?"
taller than I am.
"Yeah, it figures," he said and grimaced just a little as he got down on the floor with her. Again, just shy of forty-two. Not an old man. He set the books and the pencil case on the table, and Olivia gasped at it.
He stopped dead in his tracks.
Tony fell against the worktable chair, but Bruce, to his credit, didn't falter. "OK, and how old are you, Olivia?"
Barnes turned to Wilson. "Is he talking about Stark or the kid?"
Steve exhaled a heavy breath through his nose. "Infinity stones," he muttered and shared a look with Tony, who just shook his head as though to say,
He put gentle hands on Steve's pecs and reached up on his toes to press a light kiss against his jaw. Steve huffed out a breath, and Tony took that opportunity to press a little closer, rubbing his hip ever-so-gently against Steve's rapidly growing interest and reaching to the other side of Steve's jaw to press a matching kiss.
Tony blew out a breath and swiveled back and forth in his chair some more. "Honestly? Steve kind of… I guess he sort of characterizes
ignorant of this whole thing."
"It makes perfect sense. You're just not listening to me."
Rhodey just looked at him pointedly. "You sound like Papa Tony there."
"Pick up the pieces and start all over again?"
"Make it sound like I want to hire him as a prostitute."
That didn't mean he had more claim to her than Steve did, no, but there was an element of possessiveness that that knowledge allowed for him to develop. This was a child born of his own body, and as such, only he knew exactly how to properly care for her, and he'd slit the throat of
Steve chuckled a little. "Yeah, but even if I did, it's part of why I love you."
did I tell you about mentioning any of that in front of Steve?" Tony snapped, though Steve just set that sad-eyed look on him at the reminder of his less-than-stellar health.
"Yeah?" he said and turned the screen off then stuck the phone back in his bag. "Well, when this happens to you, we'll see how hyperbolic you think it is to have to pee all the fucking time. Don't even get me started about how fucking weird it is to have something moving around inside of you."
" Hill. A crack that sounded like gunfire. "
"Not a tank," Natasha said. "A half-track."
for it, if you must know."
didn't put it there, Captain. That was all your doing. Second, I wouldn't do that if I were you."
He learned about labor, about the stages and signs of labor, and about the physiological changes the body underwent. He learned about postpartum and newborn care and breastfeeding. He learned about relaxation techniques and nutrition and something called a 'birth plan,' whatever that was.
"Yeah," he said, dropping his voice as he slowly pulled Tony against him. "But we're alone?"
"Tony—"
"I didn't know I had to," Steve said and rubbed his hand over the swell, poking back at what looked like an appendage of some kind poking out.
"OK, you explain more American customs to Goldilocks," Tony said. "I'm gonna go back to making out with my sexy super soldier."
"Well, I don't know about the
"Steven, I am coming with you, and that's—"
. Holy fuck, does it hurt! I mean, just try to imagine shoving a goddamned light bulb through your nostril."
"Yeah?"
King Howard had promised him his kingdom.
"I don't think you can equate facing an ex with throwing yourself on a grenade to save someone," he said and glanced at the monitor where, true to Sam's word, Tony was standing beside Pepper and Nat and fiddling with this phone.
Steve just glanced in Barton's direction and smiled slightly but didn't say anything.
it do? And the answer to that is 'not much.'"
Now, strangely — or maybe not so strangely — Barnes wasn't as excited about this turn of events as Steve was, but he just shrugged and said sure, he'd go back with them, and climbed into the back seat as Steve took the wheel and Tony got into the passenger. Steve completely ignored this blasé attitude and instead rambled on about all the amenities the Tower had and how much he'd like the other Avengers and how helpful JARVIS was — neglecting to inform him that JARVIS was a computer AI. Tony figured Steve was saving that for a surprise.
He slapped a hand over his face and fell back against the couch, hoping to god Cap hadn't heard that or, if he had, actually believed it was something from the TV.
Steve arched an eyebrow. "Excuse me?"
"The bookmarks did make the shopping a lot easier," Hill said, the corners of her mouth quirking up some.
"Why do I come here to eat?"
(Colonel Phillips had been a hard-ass, and even he'd let Steve pick his own damned team. Probably because he knew Steve would have done it with or without his permission.)
keyboard medical doctors insisting there was something clearly neurologically wrong with her with one gaining overnight notoriety for claiming that Olivia was 'clearly retarded' and insisting that she bore an appearance to a 'mongoloid.'
"And you thought a Lucky Strike would work just as well?"
"I love you," Steve murmured, "and I will do whatever I can to do right by you."
But Steve just continued to stare at the screen, and he pointed at it like he'd just seen a mirage and said, "That's… Was that me?"
do you think he doesn't like you?"
"Again, not a question."
"In a way, yeah, I guess so."
"Goddamn it, what are you doing?" he cried again, trying to pull his arms out of Bruce's and Rhodey's grips.
"Well, maybe I should start calling you my 'old woman.'"
"You were a fella then."

" Wilson agreed, more excited by the idea than anyone his age had any right to be. "That's what I'm saying!"

"It's just pictures of dead and now-geriatric rock stars. It can't be
Pepper laughed but then sobered when she realized he was serious, and she smiled at him and put her arm around his shoulders and said, "Tony, honey, trust me. He finds you attractive."

"Yeah," Barton said and turned to her, "well, evidently

"All right, somebody taught you that, 'cause I know they weren't calling them that in the '40s."
"Or some version of me, anyway."
"Honey—"

“Helluva mouth for someone tied up and bent over a table with a plug sticking out of what I take it is a nicely-prepped ass.”
"Oh, my Captain," she said with a laugh, "there is more to life than trying to prove yourself useful to people that have long since passed. Perhaps you were given this for a reason, but it is not the reason you think. You are not an island. Nothing you do occurs — oh, what does your kind like to say? — in a vacuum. You are not the only person whose life is affected by your choices."
"What's going on?"
" he asked as though Rhodey had just committed the utmost betrayal of him.

He held his arms out and closed his eyes, and Esmeralda said, "Is there any reason in particular you're doing that?"
Steve pulled one hand away from his chocolate and scratched at his forehead. "I mean, it's not— I don't know how—"
"Yeah," he said. "Does that a lot. Doesn't seem to realize it's kind of
"No, I just— First of all, way too much, uh… And second, there's some things I don't need my mom finding out about, all right?"
"All clear?" he asked when Steve rejoined him in the living room.
“But if I give you exactly what you want, what kind of lesson am I teaching you here?” “A good one. A fantastic one. Just
Tony shrugged and pushed into Steve's side. Steve moved his arm to make room for Tony, and when Tony pushed even closer to him, Steve draped his arm along the back of the bench, itching to just put his arm around Tony. Tony pulled out his cellphone again, and he pressed a few buttons before he held it out in front of them, and Steve saw the three of them staring back at him in real-time, the lights of the park shining above them.
Tony arched an eyebrow at him. "You want to bet?"
Steve wrestled Olivia away from the pile and pulled her onto his lap. She went happily, a bow in her hand that she was trying to dismantle as she did so. "That's still not nice to point out," he said as he smoothed back her wisps of blonde hair. It reminded him of the color his had been when he was younger. It had gradually darkened to dishwater blonde as he'd gotten older.
Steve frowned, and he chewed a couple times then said, "What's wrong?"
"Again, this is something you could probably hash out with your old pal Barnes because he's the only person not currently in a nursing home that might even in the remotest sense care about what you're saying."
He just laughed. "Please. You're no carpet-muncher. Not looking like that."
Tony couldn't tell if Steve was joking or not when he very seriously asked if it was possible to buy the internet.
"Did those guys just
He didn't stick around to see if Steve actually did drink it, and he never asked. Some things were better off not knowing.
"Really? The aches? The indigestion?"
"And I'm not the only one that thinks so," he said, and Steve frowned at him in confusion before Tony took his hand and put it against his belly. "Feel?"
"Finally," Tony muttered and rolled his eyes. He made to jump up, but his stupid stomach weighed him down, and he grumbled a bit as he struggled out of the chair, finally deigning to let Bruce help him up.
child when he annoys you."
Steve just stared at him and he exhaled a breath and shoved his hands into his pockets. "I'm a real asshole, aren't I?"
"No, it's fine," Tony said and went over to take the mixing bowl from him. "Seriously, what are you doing here? What is all this for?"
, don't you think?"
Steve nodded, and Tony frowned down at himself and, not for the first time, wondered if he'd made the right decision about changing back — at least so soon.
"Anyway," she said lightly and breezily, "duty calls, and as I've told you time and again, you're not my only charges." But then her face softened into something exuding honesty, her eyes losing some of their harsh focus as she looked him over and tweaked a small, delicate smile at him.
Tony considered this before he shook his head a little and said, "No, just a feeling."
dress and
"OK, I was just yanking your chain before, but I'm actually kind of hurt now," Bucky said, and even Sam and Nat seemed to be surprised by Steve's possessive turn, both setting stunned looks on him. Jim seemed a little wary while Thor...
"Yeah, well, if it wasn't for this lunkhead here," he said and jerked a thumb at Steve, "I wouldn't have had one at all."
"This whole thing — this Winter Soldier thing — that's all on me. It's 'cause I didn't save him. I didn't pull him back in time."
the way he was, and it was always so fucking hard to hide things from Steve because Steve read him so fucking well, but he just swallowed and schooled his face into something like annoyance and said, "Look, like I was telling Nutty over there, it's not the…
Steve scowled a bit and raised an eyebrow. "Which is?"
"Steve—"
"Evidently we're more of a 'hindrance' than a 'help,'" Sam replied, and Steve frowned again and went to ask him what he meant by that when the scent of baking cookies wafted through the air.
Steve frowned. "By what?"
Whatever avenue that took.
"Did'ja hear that?" Jim asked with a tease in his voice. "Your cookies are just as good as the store- bought ones."
"Dunno," Natasha said. "But would it surprise you?"
But Steve just stormed out of the bathroom, Tony in a bridal carry in his arms, and he marched over to the bed and dropped him down onto it then climbed atop him and began to fucking
Tony hesitated before he brushed his hand over her hair again and said, "Yeah, I think he did. We'll have to get you another one."
"Can't sleep without Iron Cap."
Tony rolled his eyes again. "No," he said and took another bite, and through a mouthful of food, he added, "when I got turned into a woman, I completely forgot how to correctly interpret the meaning of the words, 'Yeah, OK, Tony. We'll go out on a date tonight.'"
Tony swallowed and began to feel just a little lightheaded. Fuck. Just a little bit longer.
Steve looked away, and he stared down at his plate before he said in a small and pained voice, "Tony, I can't lose you."
"Any traffic delays, J?" he asked, and the music cut out for JARVIS to respond.
Bruce just looked at him a moment then directed some more personnel to take some sort of machine down the hall.
now. But that doesn't mean I don't acknowledge that they're both very attractive — if terrifying — women."
for you
Barton was silent a moment before he said, "Yeah, there's a lot of 'em that don't like us. But I mean you two in particular." He motioned between Steve and Tony. "Who's the one that has it out for you two in particular?"
But Bucky was long-gone, and the thoughts were still there. And not just there but beating out a thrumming, passionate rhythm that was almost impossible to contain whenever he so much as set his sights on Tony Stark. He was a gorgeous man, lean and lithe, a bit shorter than Steve (well, if one wanted to call a good five inches 'a bit') with thick, wavy dark brown hair and feathery black eyelashes framing sharp, dark eyes and strong, calloused hands derived from a lifetime of working with them. His voice — somewhat deep and somewhat gravelly — sent shivers down his spine, especially when he'd set those dark, sharp eyes on him as he spoke them. He itched to brush the pads of his fingers against that neatly-groomed van dyke, run his thumbs over his cheekbones, comb his fingers through that dark, wavy hair that curled just the slightest in the back when it got too long…
"That's not the word I would use."
with Steve's strength and Tony's intelligence?
Some song that began 'Chestnuts roasting on an open fire…' played quietly in the background, and the voice that sang it was like pure liquid gold, so rich and melodious Steve thought he could listen to it forever. He nestled closer to Tony, reveling in the warmth and security he provided.
And this was what Steve would have to live with the rest of his life.
s at him, but Tony just put his hands up to Steve's face and held him gently, brushing his thumbs against Steve's cheekbones.
"I'm sorry," Tony said as he settled Olivia into his arms, Jim evidently giving in to Tony's demands, "is everybody pissed that they weren't picked?"
Tony just shot a pointed look at her.
He looked at his computer, and he was silent a moment before he added, "I can get into a lot of trouble for this, but—" He reached out and turned the monitor toward them so they could see it. "Is all the information as shown correct?"
He nodded and cleared his throat. "Yeah," he said as he suddenly realized there were several others sets of eyes on him that didn't understand the significance, including one in particular to his right that he knew had a sneaking suspicion as to what Tony's sudden melancholy was about. He swallowed and turned to him, and he tweaked a smile and said, "Big
"Oh," he said before what that meant sunk in.
"Nope," Olivia replied, and of course she did. Tony would have to have been nuts to think she wouldn't weigh in on it. "'cept sometimes, at night, when I have a bad dream or I need a drink'a water and I can't get in your room right away, and you have to tell me to wait 'cuz you're busy playin' and you gotta put your toys 'way first. I don't know why I can't come in when you 'n' Daddy 're playin'. You come in my room when I'm playing with my toys."
He took several steps away from Tony and crossed his arms over his chest as though to guard himself.
"You are stardust. You are energy. You are a being of life and creation. Your physical form matters little in the entire scheme of things."
"I wish they'd been able to put a stop to it," Steve said with a grumble.
"Does this mean you're in that body permanently?" someone called out, and Tony exhaled a breath.
He nodded against Tony's shoulder and once again whispered a sincere and heartfelt, "
Silence.
Tony just shrugged. "Maybe Howard was different back then? Maybe he was actually nice? Maybe Cap's more of an asshole than history's made him out to be? Who knows."
He grinned and tried to kiss him, but Tony pulled his head back and said, "I think I should probably explain something."
He clicked the link and waited for the page to load, the most tortuous ten seconds of his life. But when it did, he wished he could go back in time and stop any of this stupid stuff from ever happening.
the fuck was playing at the moment.
He grimaced, looking embarrassed and humbled. "Yeah. But that doesn't mean I don't want you — the real you — too. I just…" He reached up and scratched his head. "I know I have no leg to stand on here, not compared to you, but I'm just so goddamned confused by this whole thing."
He rested his hand on Steve's abdomen and then began to rub it, feeling the hard lines and the tight, firm muscle beneath, and he began to imagine what he knew was underneath the very tight shirt Steve was wearing, and then—
"Hey, what do you think you're doing?" Barton asked.
"But not tonight."
"Like they stud prizewinners," Steve muttered.
"Fuck you, Barton."
He swallowed, Steve's eyes boring into his. "Yes, Sir."
him."
"Who knows?" Barton said and pushed at the cereal in his bowl again but didn't scoop up any. "But it's here to stay, Cap, so you'd better get used to it—" he pulled his spoon out of the bowl and pointed it at Steve, "—especially when they're talking about
Tony scoffed. "I don't see why not. I could do this."
Fuck, fetuses really did look like little alien creatures, didn't they?
"Are you falling asleep on me?"
Thor smiled, and he leaned forward some as though to give the impression of imparting wisdom on them.
Wilson took it in stride — or as much as he could. They were keeping the whole Winter-Soldier- gone-on-the-straight-and-narrow thing quiet while Tony had Pepper have the lawyers work out the details absolving James Buchanan Barnes of the crimes committed while under the thumb of Hydra — even if Barnes himself wasn't fully comfortable with it because, in his words, "I still did it."
He set the tablet on the cushion and got to his feet, and he went up the steps and grabbed her one hand and said, "Hold onto the railing, OK?"
" JARVIS replied, and Tony nodded and tapped his hands on the steering wheel, grimacing at the continued ache in his right wrist.
me and Steve being like this?"
Tony smiled, but there was a good deal of sadness underlining it. "Yeah, well, unless you do something completely stupid and I can't figure out a way to bring you back to life, I think we know which one of us that's going to be."
Steve nodded, and Olivia braced both her feet against the edge of the tabletop and began to push against it, inadvertently shoving herself back against Steve, the force just a little...more...than he was sure other four-month-olds could muster. He watched her as she pushed her feet against the tabletop, and he kissed the top of her head then scooped her up and stood up. He settled her into his arms then went over to Tony, and as Tony grumbled to himself as he tried to fit the last cookie onto the sheet, Steve reached out an arm and snagged it around Tony, pulling him against him and holding his entire world in his arms.
"Look," Barnes added with a shake of his head, "I'm not sure I'm ready for that sort of thing — I don't even know if I want to do that sort of thing! Maybe I want to, I don't know, run a coffee shop or something?"
"Nat! Let's
Tony shrugged and continued to toy with the stylus. "I love Pep, don't get me wrong. I just… I'm not sure we were ever meant to be anything more than friends. I think we tried to force something that wasn't meant to be."
"Then I guess we can let it go another night."
"Right at this moment? She wouldn't want to know. I swear to god, I'm going to gag you," he said, working the lubricant between his fingers to warm it up.
Steve turned his head the slightest to brush his lips over the shell of Tony's ear. "Is that a bad thing?"
Evidently they hadn't said anything of the sort. He was sure Barnes would have passed along the message if he had. So, they'd found Steve.
an old Stark Industries facility upstate… He shook his head to clear his mind of that and instead changed the subject a little. "So, who are the Avengers now?"
He was mesmerized by him.
Steve had been thinking about it. This had clearly crossed Steve's mind before. He'd been fantasizing about Tony being his 'Antonia Natasha' — his
of them left. All over the place. I'm not sure we even scratched the surface of what remains because when the ship went down, it was every man for himself, and some of them banded together, and some of them started their own, and— Look, what I'm saying is that Captain America's kid would be like the golden chalice to any of these assclowns. You know what they did to his pal Barnes. Can you imagine what they would do to his kid?"
"Yeah, it was… It's from my time."
He took a seat at his worktable, and JARVIS said, "
… I used to think…"
Ella hummed in agreement then said, "Well, no one's come forward with any information on her." She motioned to the other panels and added, "As you can see, she was very popular with the music scene of the time. It's a shame what happened to her. Could you imagine the beautiful prints we would have had of Woodstock?"
Oh, but what it had given him!
Well, more giggled, and once Steve was able to get a hold of himself after riding the crest of his own orgasm, he rubbed his hands gently over Tony's belly and said, "What?"
"Yeah, you're Captain America and you
Steve shot a look at Bucky then got up and grabbed his lunch. "I'll be right back."
He had thought, when all this had first started, that it would be nothing but sweet relief to be back in his old body — no pun intended — and he supposed, to a degree, it was, but at the same time, it was depressing.
Wilson put his hands back up again. "I'm out!" he announced just as Rhodey finally appeared from nowhere, a drink in his hand and a well-tailored tux adorning his frame as he stood beside Wilson and said, "What's wrong?"
a regular feeding schedule, and Tony was still leaking all over the place and having to express the extra just to give himself some relief. The first time he'd tried to do it back when he'd thought he was only doing it for science, he'd ended up squirting himself in the face, and Steve had been there at the time — of course he had — and had almost burst an artery because he'd laughed so hard at it. He shut up real quick once Tony figured how to angle it to squirt at him, and, wiping the splatter of milk from his cheek, said with the utmost seriousness, "That is your daughter's only means of nourishment. You shouldn't be playing around with it like that."
He groaned and said, "Fine," and he rode the elevator in silence until they got up to the lab's level, and Tony left his bag in the elevator and went in. "Quickly, J," he said and yawned. "Kinda falling asleep on my feet here."
He didn't give Tony a chance to respond to that in any way, instead wrapping the soft, silky cloth over his eyes and tying it at the back.
Bruce just rubbed his eyes beneath his glasses again and said with a bit of a sigh, "Tony, I'm not that kind of doctor."
Steve just shrugged, grinning. "You knew what you were getting into when you married me."
"Did you even think to ask us if we wanted this?" Steve asked, sounding more like a growl than actual words.
Tony led her off the car and through the living area and into the kitchen. Rhodey was still passed out on the couch. "Please note that from this moment on, you're to address my daughter as 'Young Miss' rather than 'Miss Olivia.'"
. I married
He nodded. Natasha, he could take. But if Bruce opened his mouth one more
"What?"
"We all remember New York," Steve said, catching Tony's eye to make sure he was OK at the mention of that seminal event. Tony tweaked a smile in return and turned his attention to Olivia, who was sitting quietly in her highchair watching the adults around her, and satisfied that he wasn't about to suffer a panic attack — not that he had in quite a while, but as Steve knew about his time in the ice, the memories and the fears that came with them never fully went away, they just...took a breather — he turned back to Thor and asked, "Has this ever happened before?"
" he said with a laugh.
had happened to Tony Stark and just
She paused in her motions. "Do you wish me to?"
, "—it's pretty clear our Cap doesn't swing that way." He sighed out a breath and rubbed a hand over his face. "Of course, that's going to make it a hell of a lot harder to get her back where she belongs."
, right?"
But Steve shook his head and said, "No, that's not a bad thing. Don't say that. That's…amazing." He moved a hand from Tony's shoulder down to his abdomen, resting his hand over top of Tony's. "I've kind of been afraid to say anything because I know you've kind of been struggling with this, but this whole thing is amazing and
Barnes seemingly considered this a moment then said, "If you really are a fella underneath it all—"
," he amended with a roll of his eyes, "to me has never stopped you before. In fact, I think you've kind of used it to your advantage."
"He remembers you well," he added, a knowing tone lacing his voice. He gave Tony a curt smile then turned and left, and Tony stared after him for a moment, those old feelings of pain and humiliation coming back like he was twenty-years-old again, and he almost got lost in the heartaches of yesteryear when movement in the periphery caught his attention, and he turned, his gaze settling upon a much different tall hunk of man with fair hair and blue eyes.
"Uh, no, not really," Steve replied and stepped into the kitchen. "Buck and Sam were fighting over who got to hold the baby."
or anything." He shivered. "But if you want, I could—"
you not
"I keep forgetting that's what's at the end of this."
Tony scoffed. "Steve and I are bastions of impartiality."
He screamed and smacked Steve, and Steve burst out laughing and pulled him back upright again. Tony, so surprised by what Steve had done,
He nodded, filing that information away for future reference. "But you know what happens to us."
He swallowed and nodded. "Yep. Uh, unless you'd like to stick around?"
" he finally said.
Tony just turned his bemused confusion on Steve, and Steve reached over and set the onesie aside with the other outfits she'd gotten from her aunts and uncles.
Steve closed up the cupboard, and he came back into the bedroom, the tin of polish and a rag in-hand, and said, "My mother raised me right."
"He said those exact words?"
"Yeah," he said, a little distantly then made a hesitant motion in a direction and said, "I'll be right back."
"Yeah, well," he grumbled and turned back around to sit in his seat the right way. As soon as he had, Steve reached over and snagged hold of his hand, and he brought it up to his lips and kissed it right over his ring finger where his wedding band had sat until that morning, not taking his eyes off the road. Tony watched as Steve frowned when his lips met skin instead of gemstone and metal, and he brushed his fingers over the bare joint and said, "Where's your ring?"
Tony's jaw dropped. "
"Do you have a better suggestion?"
He looked down at himself. "Are you kidding? I look like I'm pregnant."
"Dance," Steve replied like it was obvious. Then he nudged his arm and said, "Come on," again. "Just like we're back home."
helped save all of us—"
"How… Wha… How did you…?"
Barton nodded, and Wilson said, "Eh, that one's OK."
"Well, it's something to consider," Steve said and cut off another piece of his waffle. "I'd like to pull Buck in, too, but we have to get this Winter Soldier business squared away first."
Sam stared at him a moment longer then said, "Yeah, we gotta put you through the same sort of 'welcome to the twenty-first century' crash course we put Cap through."
He shrugged. "Dunno."
"Exactly! We don't know! For all we know, she comes from a world of war and pestilence, and alternate universe me sent her here because he knew—"
"It's not a bad thing. Now shush. We're supposed to be enjoying the moment."
The perfect weapon because it was the combination of Iron Man and Captain America and thus had built into its DNA everything that made those men special. Granted, that was no guarantee the child would possess the serum in its blood. Steve's DNA could very well have not been touched by the serum, and thus, whatever child was born of the union would have in it genes from a short, scrawny, sickly yet scrappy underdog from the wrong side of the tracks.
And he couldn't even blame hormones for it this time.
"There's a strip a couple towns away," Steve said with a shrug as he…looked something up on his phone.
"I think it's something we should be mindful of," Steve said, catching both Tony's and Nat's eyes and silently exhaling in relief that they both appeared to be in agreement with him. "We know we have to get Loki's scepter back. We know it potentially has one of these stones in it. It's not impossible to think there are others out there."
"—is an idiot that doesn't know how to express his feelings." She paused a moment then reached out and took a gentle hold of his right wrist. "How did he do this?"
"Hmm? Oh, well, before I nearly had the life scared out of me, I was coming down here to get my phone so I could text you to get me something to eat. I haven't eaten since I found a turkey sandwich down on my worktable earlier."
"OK," Wilson said as he held his phone up to capture the event. "You
"Come on, Tony! Don't be like that— Hey! Get over here."
"Clint," she said, her voice sounding smaller than he'd ever heard it.
"You sure you got enough to make a judgment?" Tony muttered and took another bite of his suddenly smaller sub.
He leaned down and picked Olivia up from the carrier, and she began to fuss and squirm some more the moment she felt Tony's hands on her. "Yeah," he said and held her against his chest, "you're putting on an act for me. I know. All right," he said and patted her bottom. "Yeah, you feel like you need a change. Come on. I'll get you cleaned up and then we can test out some of that wonderful formula."
Tony shoved away from the table and began to pace the lab like a caged animal. "She is
"Not worried," Tony said with a curt shake of his head. "Kinda funny seeing Wilson's bitchy side. He was the last sane one around here until you showed up. Now, he's asking me if it's possible to trick out a paintball gun."
Had he done
was his job now and
He caught Jane grimacing, and instead of asking her, he instead turned to the just-arriving giant, blonde gossipmonger himself, who smiled a little sheepishly and said, "I did not think there was anything wrong in telling Jane about it."
"Thanks," he said, again sounding unsure, but for an entirely different reason, and now somehow looking rumpled in a suit that had just been pressed for him an hour ago. How the hell did he manage that?
"Didn't read the news, did you?"
"I think I can take whatever you can dish out."
"Tradition," Tony said and clinked their glasses together. "Merry Christmas."
"I'm actually kind of surprised you're surprised." Barton said. "They pull this shit at home. Why shouldn't they pull it here?"
"It doesn't count!"
The clerk just sat there, staring, and Tony heard the quiet tick of a clock from somewhere in the vicinity. He started to count out the seconds, and he got up to twenty-six before the clerk spoke again.
If Steve had known about that before he'd come up to the penthouse yesterday, then suddenly Steve's concerns made a
"Why, what happened to it?" Steve asked as he hit the button for the elevator.
Steve just sighed and shook his head, rocking his body back and forth in a gentle, soothing manner for the infant in his arms, and as Tony set up the specimen for testing, he explained, "Look, there is no possible way, even if that other Olivia was alternate universe's us's daughter, that she would have exactly the same genetic sequence as our Olivia. That would be absolutely impossible. I mean, the probability of that would be less than zero."
" he yelled, encased in complete darkness, as he began to fall from the sky. He couldn't move anything, couldn't see anything, and the most he could do was calculations in his head as he tried to figure out how far up he was, plus the rate of acceleration, to figure out how hard and how fast he would hit the—
He went into the living room and, as JARVIS had said, Steve's tablet was on the coffee table. He picked it up and took it back into the kitchen, and he went over and stood behind Steve and held the tablet in front of him so they could both look at it at the same time.
Tony turned to him, a slight smirk on his face, and he brought the mugs over to the table and set them down as he took his chair again and said, "Are you talking mashed bananas and pureed peas or a steak dinner?"
"Jesus
Barton shrugged and folded his arms while Tony grabbed onto the ankles of the suit and began to pull.

"She's…"

He just shrugged like the idiot had nothing to say for himself, but it was Natasha that said in a cool and breezy tone, "You're a spy. You're trained to be aware of every kind of situation."
Well, weirdly, there was something empowering about it. He'd never felt so in-tune with his body in his whole life — not this one nor his other one. He'd never trusted his body so much, never felt that his body knew much more than his mind ever did as he did at that moment. Bruce might have been telling him to push, encouraging him and telling him what a good job he was doing, but Bruce wasn't the one he was listening to. It was himself, it was his body, it was something so innate and ancient it was something that was just understood.
inefficient you can't even begin to understand."
"Not a big deal. I get it. It makes it 'real' for you."
"But Friday's the one that calls," Olivia muttered and folded her arms. "I dunno if
