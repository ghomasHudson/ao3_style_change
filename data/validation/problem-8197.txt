"Because I don't want to lose you!"
Steve glanced at Tony as they both came to a halt. “I’ve stayed here for a week or two, after the Chitauri,” he explained. “A nice old lady is letting the cabin in summer. It’s very… basic, but it helped me calm down and regroup.”
Tony nodded. After a beat, he reached to the floor next to himself, and took Steve’s shield into his hands. “And I wanted to give this back.”
Steve clutched him tighter. “Okay… I trust you.”
After another parting kiss, he watched as Tony walked to the elevator, his steps slow but steady. When he stepped inside the booth, the doors closing slowly behind him, he didn’t turn around again.
“Exactly,” Steve said, and a small smile took hold of his face. “No way out for either of you.”
Eventually, Steve drew back and looked at Tony for a long, studious moment.
“Hey,” Steve called as he put a hand on Tony’s shoulder, “wake up. Rise and shine.”
Bucky nodded his head. “Alright,” he replied. Together, he and Bucky hurried back to the elevators. The sky outside was clouded by a layer of smog. Just gray clouds that glazed over every building in a never-ending blanket. Stepping out of the facility, Steve looked down on the streets—watched the people that knew nothing of the subhuman existence that might endanger them all. First New York, Washington, then Wakanda. And all of those little villages in Eastern Europe afterwards. Casualties had always been much too high whenever they had encountered a super villain. And Steve had a feeling today wouldn’t be any different.
Tony sighed. “Of course, but…”
“We’re out of sweetener,” she told him. “Brought you cream.”
There was absolutely nothing worth watching on television. And Tony should know, he’d spent the past two and a half hours flipping through the same two hundred and sixty-five channels with nothing to show for it. There was news, home-shopping channels, late-night television, sitcoms, but nothing grabbed his interest or did anything to take his mind off of…
Tony’s lips quirked up in a tired smile. “‘s all okay, Steve.” His eyes were locked on Steve’s, pleading with him. “Trust me, ‘s probably better that way…”
“Will you put me in bed?” he asked, struggling to focus on Steve’s face as he waved a finger at him. “Gotta undress me first, y’know?”
Steve, like everyone else, seemed to be shaken to his bones.
—fuck you very much Rhodey.
Bucky’s eyes flashed in response. He rushed forward, this time grabbing the guy with his metal arm. The man, however, pushed him off with the ease of a man throwing a football. As Bucky reeled backward into the computer console in the middle of the room, Steve struck out with one leg, sideswiping the man on the right side of his head.
Steve tossed his shield over his shoulder and leveled his eyes at her. “Tony convinced us you were worth trying to talk to you.”
He had never hated saying goodbye more than in this moment.
When Tony stirred, Steve reluctantly let his arm fall away from him. Tony glanced up and he still looked tired, a bit feverish—and already thinner than he had when they’d arrived here.
There was the sound of footsteps on the stairs and then, Nat walked into the room. Nat, who… who had red hair again, so long that it fell over one shoulder in wavy curls. She wore casual clothes, and had a bag slung over her shoulders.
“Ian’s with Tony.”
The second Iron Man’s boots touched down on American soil, he truly grasped the extent of Thanos’ doing. He’d imagined it, of course, about a million times, one scenario worse than the next, but seeing it with his own eyes—seeing what the war lord had done to the planet Tony had sworn to protect—it was even more horrific than he could’ve ever envisioned.
Steve’s eyes only got bigger as he went. There were dozens of desks with an endless amount of machinery that looked a lot like it’d just dropped down here from a different world entirely. He’d known, of course, that Tony was called a genius—that newspaper described his inventions as masterpieces, but he still hadn’t been prepared to see it for himself.
“We kind of are having dinner right now,” Tony pointed out.
man…”
“Another super soldier?” Bruce asked quietly, leaning forward. “The army must’ve done tests on him. There were no records—”
He let Steve drag him down the stairs and through the doors. As soon as they stepped into the large training room, Tony took hold of his own jacket and hastily pulled it off.
He heard Steve calling for him, and a moment later, the door to his cell opened, and Steve was crouching on the bed next to him. There was some sort of alarm blaring, as Steve’s hands pulled him upwards into a sitting position, his back pressed against Steve’s chest.
“That’s… nice,” Tony said, and he meant it. “Thank you.”
. I…”
Steve breathed in, rubbing his eyes. “He was so fast. Really strong, too. There’s no way he was only human. And there was something—he had a metal arm. Robotic, I think.”
They stepped around a corner, walking a little further into some secluded hallway, before they came to a stop. No lights were on; there was no sound. Steve supposed he should feel grateful for it, but instead found himself resentful and uneasy, wishing for some noise to crack through the funeral silence.
Steve laughed at that. "Takes a lot more than that to break Bucky Barnes. He appreciates it, don’t worry," he said, turning to Tony fully. "I don't know what to say. This is…" He hesitated, looked at the blueprints so that he wouldn't have to look at Tony when he continued talking, finally deciding to steer the conversation towards their own predicament. "You—you left so quickly…"
He took a step closer, then, pressing his own erection against Steve’s and opening his hand so he could align them both. “This enough?” he asked softly, while his fingers began a slow exploration up and down, getting a feel of the movement. A long hum left Steve’s mouth at that, his eyes glued to the both of them and soaking in the view.
Tony’s hands were now balled to fists. “You know what: Call me when you know what you want,” he spat and moved to walk past Steve. On pure instinct, Steve grabbed his hand to stop him, feeling a jolt go through Tony limbs. He tried to struggle and free himself, and glared at Steve when he didn’t let him go.
“We’re already in ‘real trouble’, if you haven’t noticed. And anyway, you snap out of it all by yourself. I trust you, we all do, whether you like it or not—and the team needs you now.”
Tony sighed. He couldn’t deny it. “Fine. Take Bucky. No one else. Tell your team to drop their weapons.”
There was a beat of silence, followed by a heavy sigh on Tony’s part. “Please let us talk about this,” he asked, his voice quiet and with a sigh of his own, Steve came to a halt, and turned around where Tony now stood a few meters behind him. “I want to explain.”
“What,” Tony said, immediately defensive.
“Maybe that’s your problem. Or one of them,” Barnes said, letting the words linger in the air, and with a sigh, he picked up another cotton swab, winced at the thick smell of antiseptic, and approached Tony tentatively. “Lean toward me and hold still.”
Steve cast him an unrepentant grin. “True.”
Things were going to change drastically, and there was no way to tell where they were heading. With all of this leaked information, accessible to anyone, anywhere—reports and data that weren’t set into perspective correctly—some people would inevitably turn against them. The first reaction towards things that couldn’t be explained had always been—
It was then that Steve’s phone buzzed faintly, and with an irritated shake of the head, he reached down to look at it.
Tony chuckled. “Doing what?”
They stayed like that for a whole long while, curled in each other’s arms, before Tony released a trembling sigh and brushed a kiss against Steve’s throat. “I’m, uh… exceedingly bad at feelings,” he started, clearing his throat, because he owed Steve an answer, even if he couldn’t simply repeat those words in kind. “Train-wreck-terrible, really, but, yeah, l’m… there with you. Same page.”
Steve shrugged, raising the bottle to his lips again. Only once he’d finished half the beer, he dared looking at Bucky again. “When did it start?” he asked. “Us, I mean?”
Sam nodded in agreement. “They worked like a dream. Never let me down.”
Something about letting someone in like this—opening up to such an extent—had always terrified Tony. Not anymore. This was wanted. It was needed. Amazing how quickly Steve had become his everything.
Tony’s head jerked up the second Steve barrelled through the door. And the second their eyes clashed, the most potent wave of sadness Steve had ever felt flooded his veins, weighing down on him.
“Might be worse for him,” Bruce mused, scratching his chin. “Maybe he’s seeing things from his old life.”
“You gotta be a bit more specific, Cap. I know a lot of things.”
Tony stared down at Ant-Man. He really didn’t want to be responsible for hurting a potential future-teammate. There were certain things political disagreements couldn’t eradicate, and the connection he felt with his friends was among them.
Fury’s gaze darkened, but he didn’t seem surprised. He knew Steve’s views on punishment without a proper prosecution and what he would or wouldn’t agree on. “We can’t afford to wait that long.”
Steve drew in a sharp breath, but he didn’t have to look at it to know which name was embossed in the steel. He didn’t know what to think about that, the implication was clear, of course, he wasn’t stupid, but the fact that Natasha had
Steve pulled him close, and he rested his forehead on his chest. “You’re going to be fine.” He pulled back, looking Tony in the eye. “You
Clint’s mouth opened, closed, and opened again. He didn’t try to look behind the door, and instead turned sideways, and nodded. “Gotcha. Hi, Nat.”
It couldn’t be.
“He sent you back.”
Then a spark. Something. A name.
, Bucky thought, brushing his hand over the stump.
Tony’s jaw clenched. He allowed himself a moment of deep-rooted wonder that this still managed to make him so angry. He didn’t care; he truly didn’t
Steve snorted as though he couldn’t help himself. “Only you would put a sex joke into a code that will permanently change your life. You’re insufferable.”
“And you?” he asked, looking at Natasha. “Won’t you be coming with us?”
Tony’s head started to spin a little at the realization that they
“I’ve just about had it with you,” Rhodey said and
Steve only barely refrained from rolling his eyes. “Doesn’t have to be about last night. I just meant a normal conversation. About anything you want.”
He reached for Steve’s shoulder to pull himself into a sitting position. “It’s
“And if… I vow to be very, very virtuous?” Tony asked, as he cuddled more fully against Steve’s chest, a happy shiver racing through his body. “My hands will always stay above waistline, pinky swear.”
Tony snorted, holding back every snarky comment waiting at his tongue. “Yeah… love you, too, suicidal tendencies and all.”
There was a brief pause. “Do you remember anything else?”
“You coming?” Tony called, and Bucky blinked when he saw him standing next to a table. Only then, he spotted his bionic arm lying on the surface.
So he had put the phone next to the letter, added a few lines to it, and sent it away. Had it been anyone else, Steve had to assume he wouldn’t ever get a call. How do you move on from what they had done to each other? But it was Tony, and…
A smile crossed Steve’s lips. With one last nod to himself, he opened the bottle of lube and poured some into his palm, coating his fingers with it. With his free hand, he pushed Tony’s left leg a bit further upwards, then inspected his opening. It was so
Sharon carried a single white flower and laid it on the freshly covered grave. “Goodbye Aunt Peggy,” she whispered and moved away.
Steve’s eyes widened. He recognized it for what it was—a last cop out. Tony thought he wanted to stop? Now?
chance to kiss Steve like this—Ross and Zemo and everything else, it wouldn't have mattered.
“Trying to get in your head has always been a secret hobby of mine.”
, whatever. I never have been. I never managed to give Pepper what she needed.” He smiled wryly. “And that really does a number on your self-confidence, okay? The supposedly great love of my life didn’t want to be with me. I just don’t think I’m fit to love. Or how to keep the good things in my life from falling apart.” A sigh shuddered through him. “And somehow, the fact that Steve might want to be with me scares me more than all the shit that happened between us. And even so, I never thought it’d be… I never thought it would be
“It’s not you I’m worr—Hey, whatcha doing there, Lila-Pila?"
Tony huffed, waving a dismissive hand at the empty room. “Of course not. Hell, you haven’t changed your mind at all, did you?”
A heavy sigh trembled through Steve’s lips, as he closed his eyes and let sleep carry him away. And wished—
Reclaiming Tony’s hand, Steve dragged him to the elevator.
much to talk about!”
“You should be,” Tony whispered. “You’re so young, Steve… You should be free to experience new things every day. See new cities, meet new people. Not be confined to a house and its long-lost ghosts.”
There was the slightest tug on the corners of Tony’s mouth; barely visible, but still there.
“Second that,” Sam agreed, though he was still smiling a little at the both of them.
When Steve walked into his room, he immediately spotted a brown haired head glinting in the moonlight. Tony was sitting in the big reading chair, facing the windows in a way that hid his face from Steve.
anything. Let me handle it!”
already; every inch of him shook with strain, and he needed Steve inside him like he had never needed anything in his life.
“So, uh, you’re Thor,” Sam said, and there was the familiar disbelief clearly written all over his face as he took in Thor’s attire: Cape, Asgardian battle armor, hammer (which was currently dangling from the goddamn storage rack on the ceiling, next to a couple of saucepans), it was all there. Tony couldn’t really blame Sam for his blatant staring. They’d all been there at one point or another. “As in… the Thunder God,” Sam went on. He was moving about the kitchen, collecting ingredients for what Tony assumed would be a better breakfast than he’d had in weeks.
“Right,” Steve said—and there was something in his voice. Confidence. In him. Not only that he could do it, but that he would. “Iron Man and I will go looking for the twins. Hawkeye, Widow, you go in, try to keep Rumlow and his men from leaving the building. Thor, Falcon, stay outside, in case someone gets away.”
Barnes raised a brow, then pointed to the bottle of Scotch.
Steve moaned, loud and surprised at the endearment. He all but shook as Tony suddenly leaned forward, dropping his forehead against Steve’s. He wanted to watch him come, Steve realized, and Steve couldn’t do anything but give him exactly what he wanted.
This was definitely the second most wondrous.
It was already dark outside, and Steve shifted his weight from one leg to the other. He stood in front of the entrance, eyes on the large sign above the door. He was dressed in a casual jacket and one of his nicer button downs, feeling at once under
He could feel her eyes on him through the mirrored glass, but the stare wasn’t intrusive. “The first few times we met, you always used to tell me you were nothing more than a ghost. And for a long time, I thought you were right.” She turned around, then, pressing up against him. “You stopped telling me this years ago, James. And I know you can’t see it, because you don’t remember, but you
“You gotta introduce us sometime,” Steve told him with a smile.
to make him happy, and Steve wanted to make it happen so badly.
Tony was just preparing to go looking for his dearest husband, when suddenly, an inhuman sound split the air somewhere above him. Tony looked up just in time to see the Ant-Guy morph to a very giant-fucking-sized Ant-Guy. The appearance was baffling to Tony to the point where he could only open-mouthed stare.
“Tony,” Bruce said gently. “You only have to tell Ross that I went rogue. That way, I’ll be top priority for his team, and while your two groups face off alone, I’ll be keeping them busy. You’ll have to make the others see that we’re not really there to fight them. That we’re just staging this. You’ll talk to Steve, let him get away, and follow him after.” He took a deep breath, and looked at Tony with a small smile. “You know it best: There’s nothing Ross likes more than getting his hands on me. He wants some prime example for his movement. He lost James, he lost Wanda, and after Wakanda, I’m the perfect guy for the job.”
“Not like this,” Steve said firmly, hating himself for not having shoved Tony off long ago. He wasn’t a weak leaf of a thing anymore; he
Tony grimaced at Steve as he wiped the water out of his eyes. “There’s a too many gray hairs that beg to differ. So—definitely too old to camp in the wilderness. My back’s killing me. And I would give my whole fortune for a toothbrush.”
“Yeah.” Tony shrugged. “Sorry I didn’t tell you earlier.”
“It doesn’t,” Tony repeated, and took hold of Steve’s face, kissing him. “It’s already perfect.” Then he turned around, leaning a bit over the RV. “Come up here!” he called. “It’s starting!”
, Steve repeated in his mind.
to leave, but somehow, it was a comforting thought—to know that he
“Yeah. I know.”
, you gave me all I have. I… the past weeks proved that I’m lost without you.”
Tony frowned and looked down on the calendar in his phone. True enough, there was another meeting set up at two p.m.—another one of those horrible discussions about which changes on the Accords were acceptable and which weren’t. He really must be tired—he’d been one hundred percent sure the last meeting had been it for today.
That… was definitely not like him. Why care what Steve thought of him anyway? Bracing himself, Tony turned around fully and cast Steve an easy smile. “Jup,” he answered. “You know me, give me something to rack my brains over and I’m one happy person.”
Tony’s jaw tightened as he watched Steve turning around while jogging towards the 50 yards line. He waved at the crowds, his expression as always a bit sheepish. Steve had a hard time dealing with the fame, he’d once told Tony. You could see it in the tensed line of his broad shoulders, and the way his eyes never quite made eye contact whenever he was the center of attention.
for beta-reading, and more importantly for listening to me whining for about 4 months straight, and for giving me new ideas and pointers. Also a BIG thank you to
Tony paused, then huffed and let himself fall down on the chair next to Rhodey. “God help him.”
The skin of his naked chest… well, in the sunlight it gleamed almost golden. He could only resist its pull for so long, so he reached down and let his finger lightly trace Tony’s upper arm. He didn’t do much more than prod his shoulder, though his hand did take a brief detour to run through his black locks to see if they were as soft as they looked.
to bring you back. So don’t you dare dismissing that, Buck-o, because then you and I, we’re gonna have a problem.”
“Brucie,” he spoke quietly as they neared the front door, “pierced m’spleen. There’s… ruptures…”
As if on cue, Tony pulled back, staring at Steve with pure want. “Now,” he said, breathing in raggedly.
(See the end of the chapter for
Natasha hummed, clearly not believing a word he said. She grabbed for her black sweatshirt—the most casual clothing he’d ever seen her wear—and walked towards the staircase. “Goodnight.”
“Yeah, well, he made that choice. Not me.”
—he wanted it here. In this place composed of nowhere, with the weird-looking furniture and the wrong New York skyline.
Tony braced himself. Physically and mentally. “It is. Show me what you got.”
Tony chuckled. “Wonderful,” he said. “That’s how civilized people end a conversation.”
Steve stared at them. That whole exchange was puzzling and he couldn’t believe how friendly everyone seemed to be with each other.
Tony hurried after Obi as he told someone on the phone that they’d be at Stark Industries’ New York headquarter in under an hour. He just left the building, obviously expecting Tony to follow after him. Which he did, of course. He followed him across the front of the building, down a lane and to a black limousine.
He couldn’t even tell how much time had passed or how many hundreds of robots they’d brought down.
,” Barton concluded with a cheeky grin, and got a whack on the head for it by Natasha.
want to stop?”
team? Why?”
Tony pursed his lips. “I said ‘all’, didn’t I?”
Because, dammit, he was right.
Steve stared at him in disbelief for a long moment, before shaking his head. "Buck." He swallowed thickly around the lump in his throat and reached to hug him again. Bucky didn't shrug him away. "Don't ever say stuff like that…" And though he tried to sound stern, military hardened Captain that he was, the words came out strangled.
Tony’s smooth skin was cradled snugly around him, as Tony arched his back. Suddenly, the memory of Tony rolling his hips over Steve in fluid motions returned to his mind. The image alone brought a groan to his lips. Tony was no less beautiful right now, only that his face was twisted into a grimace.
Steve looked far less flustered than Tony expected him to be. “Whatever gets you going,” he shot back.
When he drew back and opened his eyes again, the vivid brown of Tony’s eyes was dark with heat and intensity, his pupils a bit dilated.
“Be careful,” Steve commented on an amused chuckle when Tony tried to push his still half-hard erection back into his pants. “Don’t hurt yourself.”
Somehow, sleep seemed to be far away now. He just wanted to lie there, drowsy and content in spite of what had just happened.
For a moment, Steve remained where he was, sitting right next to Tony. Then, he heaved a sigh, and stood up as well. He balanced three bowls in his hands and made his way over to the kitchen.
“We found him alright,” Steve murmured.
Tony’s back was to him. Steve was no longer encased in his warmth. He wanted to touch him but didn’t know if he should.
“Bucky—”
Steve's eyes were set on his own hand. He'd knocked out Tony's godfather without a second thought, and he wasn't particularly
"...What?" Steve asked at last, louder than intended, then took a huge, wince inducing gulp from the drink. The burn was less terrible now, but the taste was never one of Steve's favorites.
The first.
“Yes, he’s ours,” Steve agreed. Phil looked intrigued, and a bit disbelieving, so Steve figured he’d either gotten word of how Ian had come to this world, or he’d put two and two together. In any case, Steve didn’t mind—he would never, not once, be ashamed of their son.
He tapped his finger on the screen, zooming out of the area and pointing to a place on the far side of the camp. “There. It used to be there.”
“Where... Where
Some kind of guttural sound left his lips then, but he couldn’t be bothered to keep track of those things, not when Tony was finally fully bared to him. All nervousness forgotten, he freed the both of them of their remaining clothes, and what followed was slow as honey, voluptuously sensual, their lips and hands sliding over damp, shivering flesh, caressing, kneading, and biting softly.
“Tony—” Steve warned, but that was all he got out.
“Not that it matters,” Steve ground out, “but you’re the one who never talks to m—”
“There are twelve reports from different victims who were attacked by the same shooter,” Coulson said with a clipped tone. “
At that Tony looked back up, a storm within his brown eyes. His hands were still on Steve’s waist. “Tell me. Can you look into my eyes and say that you love me still?”
“So, uhm, Clint and Natasha said they were having brief visions of their past, like… memories, just more vivid. They wrote them down, the farthest they went back in time was eight months so far. That was Nat, and we analyzed that she was slightly nearer to the bulb when it exploded than Clint, and his flashbacks only have a range from a few days ago to four months top. It’s random scenes, apparently, and we don’t know what triggers them. And…” He cringed a little, looking at Steve apologetically. “...we don’t know how to stop it. Thor left for Asgard yesterday, to do some research on that plant.”
“Now you’re making me nervous,” Tony said, and sure enough, his blush was back with a vengeance.
The aftermath of the gala had brought forth a series of interview requests that he’d declined, talk show invites he’d outright ignored, and about a thousand memes of Tony getting spat in the face.
“Why?”
Tony chuckled, raising Steve’s left hand to his lips and kissing his knuckles. “Let’s do it together, alright? If you don’t like something, we can stop at any time.”
“I just mean… I could top, too. I’d love to be inside you, so much. If you don’t want that, that’s really fine, we don’t have to do that, I love—” He stopped, biting his lip. Yeah, not going there. “Everything we do will be great.”
Either would be fine, really, but so far, none of the above had happened. Steve was only giving him these looks. These long inquisitive looks, and it was slowly driving Tony insane.
“How many?”
He took Barnes’ measurements in record time, saving them onto his private servers before closing all projects. Together, they left the workshop and stepped into the elevator. The guest suites were in the upper floors of Stark Industries’ headquarters, and while most of them were occupied today, they had two bedrooms each, so Tony figured they’d be okay.
About an hour later, there was a knock on the main door leading down to the basement that housed Bruce’s lab. He and Bruce both turned around and simultaneously pulled down their working goggles.
“Down!” Natasha yelled, already moving to get Sam out of his seat. Tony quickly obliged, sinking down in the footwell-area with his knees pulled to his chest. They made it to the floor, Steve raising his shield above their heads, just in time before the upper half of the car was all but ripped away. An awful grinding sound of metal against metal filled the air, deafeningly loud. The car shuddered, slowed, but it didn’t stop, and it sounded like the grille was getting torn in two.
Next up: Epilogue!
Right.
“Laura won’t like that,” Clint ground out, wincing when he tried to move.
Natasha pressed her thumb on the screen, then turned the phone around so Tony and Rhodey could see the video feed.
Shit, what if Steve wanted him to leave now?
Oh God, he’d been hit.
“Do you regret it?” he asked.
Steve frowned. “For what?”
“Steve,” came another tentative whisper. When Steve didn’t answer, Tony eventually moved forward and opened the zipper of the tent’s hatch.
Fuck, he wanted a drink. But he hadn’t had a drink since Pepper had left for good, and… He didn’t
Steve nodded, and they made their way through the large ammunition storage. For a brief second, the familiar scents of oil, gunpowder and fuel brought about a nostalgic memory of his time here. It only lacked the smell of sweat and hard work, but it was enough to push him forward.
Steve nodded, though he really didn’t know how he was supposed to deal with all of this. Last night, Tony had all but rocked his foundation. Tony had made him want this. It hadn’t felt like a dream, or a fantasy, though of course—it had to be.
The next instant, something crashed hard above their heads, and the ground began to shake. The steel beams whined, and in the distance, he heard something rip apart. And then the floor gave way, and in an instant, Steve was falling—
“Or something… similar,” Steve pondered, though in that moment, he truly didn’t care how it was called; it was—breathtaking.
They started out slow again, and once more it was Tony who sped up rapidly.
A pause. Then a grunt.
. As long as Steve wouldn’t let him wait for months, that really would be a little—
It didn’t matter, though. Barnes had already decided to stay behind, too afraid of Ultron messing with his implants, and Tony figured in the grand scheme of things, it was the smart thing to do.
To his right, Bucky stood stock-still, his face a blank space, painfully similar to the one on the screen as the Winter Soldier shot a bullet into the surveillance camera.
“Like what?”
lost the damn thing down here and—
“I think she liked you,” Tony said, once they were alone, drawing Steve back to the present. He leaned against one of the workshop’s desks, studying Steve intently. “They all liked you. Even Dummy.”
Together. He and Tony were going to be
"Not much. We thought we’d wait for you before we discuss those last points, but the gang’s really tired," Sam was saying, his tone easy. "Wanda wondered where you were, so Nat said she was sure you'd turn up sooner or later, but that I might want to go get you if I wanted it to happen tonight." He chuckled. "Why didn't you tell me about…" He glanced at Tony for emphasis.
“It’s only temporary,” Steve said. “I promise.”
old. He just really was too old to be entertaining
Jarvis smiled. “You could, but Master Anthony is still working. So you might as well join me on my morning walk through the house, if you’d like.”
In the grand scheme of things, everything had worked just as Erskine and Stark had hoped it would. And still, Steve wasn’t enough. Colonel Phillips had said as much. He wouldn’t let Steve go after Schmidt, wouldn’t let him join the fight on the front lines.
He’d wanted him to understand why it had taken him so long to love Steve.
, that wasn’t the case at all. “You looked about ready to bolt when you noticed me lying next to you. And I… understand your concern, I do. But Steve… if you have to fight some inner war with yourself every time you touch me, that’s… not all that flattering, really. I’m seventeen, sure, but I’m also
* * *
“You okay?” he asked, glancing down.
He heard it shatter, and for minutes, he attempted to simply put Steve out of his mind. Forget how he’d once looked at Tony with such patience. How he’d often sat down with him for hours, bickering about music and movies, and television series and trash magazines. How he’d respected him, depended on his opinion, and—
“It’s kinda… boiler room-y in here, huh?” Clint said, eyeing the rusty network of pipes, railings, aluminum tubing and large metal drums filled with… stuff. “What’s in those things?”
“Oh you sneaky bastard,” Tony said, grinning. He’d never been much of a fan when it came to vaseline, but the glide worked well enough, and if it meant they could actually be doing this now, he wouldn’t be complaining. “Master strategist,” he mumbled absentmindedly as he took the little box from Steve, “If America only knew.”
Tony could feel Steve’s heart thudding against him. Pounding. His blue eyes were large and the sight of fresh tears encircled him with a sense of hope.
“I’m okay. I really am,” Tony countered, tapping on the wound as if to prove himself, and drew Steve back in. His fingers were tunneling through Steve’s hair with reverence that made him quiver. With a tender smile, Tony cupped his cheek and guided Steve’s mouth to his. The kiss that followed was soft leisured intimacy. Unhurried nibbles that promised a world for tomorrow. On a second note, Steve tugged Tony close and kissed him thoroughly, his defenses melting at the perfect feel of Tony’s lips against his.
Steve blinked, then grinned at him. “Very funny.”
* * *
He felt Steve grin against his skin. His hand slowly trailed downwards, blindly reaching for the towel around Tony’s hip and loosening the knot until it fell off of Tony’s body. His fingers made circling motions upwards, until his palm was brushing over Tony’s erect cock.
“I see your scary,” Clint muttered to him, “and raise you a ‘what the hell’?”
“Steve,” Barnes clarified, even if it was far from needed. “He wrote—”
“Why can’t it be my dream?”
, but for some reason, it did now.
By the time they toweled off and headed out of the shower, Steve was feeling the burn of arousal low in this stomach. A sense of nervous anticipation started to build inside him, and he was reminded of
The night’s events began to take their toll, leaving them physically and emotionally wrung out. Steve forced himself to get up and move the cradle next to their bed, then scooped up the baby without waking him. He tucked Ian snugly beneath his blanket, then leaned over and kissed him, taking in his fresh baby scent with his eyes shut tight.
He sighed softly, once again so distracted by his own thoughts, he didn’t notice anything amiss until, suddenly, Natasha stood next to him.
[New Client2] [chat_server:46956]
He nodded, feeling the relief rush through him when he saw Steve’s happy expression.
“Stay?”
It took a moment, but eventually, a soft smile rose to Tony’s lips. “How do you always know what I need to hear when I don’t even know it myself?”
“My God…” Steve breathed, and covered the space between them before another beat could pass. He pressed a kiss onto Tony’s cheek, not knowing what to do—
“I think he’s found a new purpose. We’ll never run out of fruit salad ever again,” Tony murmured next to him, an equally amused smile on his lips, as he leaned his head against Steve’s shoulder.
Sure, he had no idea what they were to each other right now, but he wanted to have the chance to find out.
Tony took a low breath, held it, exhaled—and Steve knew he wasn’t. “Have to be.”
“All due respect, you’re not going to solve this with boys in bullet vest,” Pepper calmly told him.
JARVIS’ answer came promptly. “Both, of course, sir,” he said with an almost-exasperated tone.
"That's the spirit," Tony said, stepping closer and helping Steve get rid of the sturdier parts of his uniform. The radiant light of the small device was casting an eerie glow on Steve's skin and Tony made it a point to press a kiss on every new inch that got revealed. There were a few scratches and bruises from the battle, but they were already fading. "So... you always putting out on first dates?" he asked at some point, grinning widely at the unimpressed expression that made itself home on Steve's face almost instantly.
He just wanted to rest.
“In a nutshell, yes,” Tony said. “I know this year has been hard on all of us, but I do believe we can move on from here.” His eyes flickered briefly to Bucky, before they continued with their round towards the rest of the team. “So we’ll make the best of what we have, and once this mess is settled, we’ll all go back to our lives, more or less. I'll leave it to you if you want to return to the tower, or resign from the team, but consider yourself invited.”
Slowly, Steve moved to alleviate the pressure from his own calves, and only looked back up to Tony when he felt him reach for his hand.
“The Avengers were formed to make the world a safer place,” Steve told Ross, his voice grave. “I feel we’ve done that.”
Tony huffed at Rhodey’s choice of words.
For the first time in weeks, Tony felt some calmness settle inside him. It was wonderful. And terrifying.
When he’d ripped off the gauntlet from Rumlow’s hand, a second was already coming for him. Only then did Steve manage to kick Rumlow in the stomach, which had him flying across the ground.
He didn’t sound too bothered, all things considered. Firing up the chest plate beam, Tony waited for Steve’s clearance that they’d all left the island, then took a deep breath. “Alright, on my mark. Now!”
Tony huffed, ignoring how his insides clenched painfully at the thought. “Much as I’d love to take credit for that, I assure you it wasn’t about me.”
And now that Tony was standing in front of him again, he’d ruined it on an impulse.
Tony’s hand remained poised above Steve’s lower back, massaging him softly. “Move with me…” He cast him a reassuring smile as he lifted off of Steve’s cock, held for a hesitant second, and then sank back down again.
Kneeling on the dirt, Rumlow slowly pulled off his mask. The skin beneath was singed terribly on one side, most of his hair missing. “I think I look pretty good, all things considered.”
.” He swept his arm out, imitating his earlier move. “Way cool, dude.”
Tony groaned when Steve’s weight pressed down on him even more. “God, you’re hard, aren’t you? Let me see you. I’ve fantasized about your dick for weeks.”
Disbelievingly, Tony stared down at his son, warmth going through him, as he started to feel like maybe this wasn’t too big for him to handle after all.
So Steve made quick work of packing, then left his room while Mister Hammer was off, making last preparations for their travel. He entered the long stretch of corridor, walking towards the part of the hotel where he knew the luxury suites were located.
A breath shuddered out of Steve at the direct touch and the suggestion. Tony could say such filthy things sometimes… it made Steve so hot. His hands gripped Tony a bit tighter than would probably be comfortable for him, but he just… Wanted him so intensely, and so fast.
In his head, like a badly cut Western film, Tony saw himself, saw Natasha and Rhodey and Vision and Clint and Sam. He saw Steve, with his stupid aura of heroism. Saw Wanda and Pietro and a too young Peter Parker and the Ant-Guy and Barnes. He saw T’Challa, who had willingly joined their side after Tony had given him Zemo’s file. And he saw a good three dozen US marines with heavy artillery who only waited for Ross’ signal to join the fight.
Tony smiled, and for the first time since their very first meeting, it looked friendly. “You’re so different than my dreams of you before,” he whispered reverently.
Soon after dinner, Laura presented her plan for sleeping arrangements. Honestly, Steve was just very grateful that she was housing ten guests at once, and when she’d asked if she could double up Steve and Tony, neither of them had disagreed. Everyone left the living room soon after, and since Fury was taking the couch, Steve had sat down at the kitchen table, staring down onto his left hand, where his wedding ring glistened in the dim light.
Tony gasped dramatically, slapping a hand across his chest. “A

Hope you enjoyed :)
“You have no idea,” Steve said hoarsely, “how much I wanna believe that.”
“I—I’m sorry. This was… stupid.”
Steve heaved a long breath, then nodded. “Yeah, okay.”
“Yes,” Steve said softly, and even tried for a smile. “I did.”
“There is?” Steve asked, and they both knew what he was really asking.
He loved Steve. Steve loved him. Nothing mattered beyond that.
“They dropped our case,” Steve gamely plowed ahead. “One of the caseworkers turned up at the hospital and said they were very sorry but our current situation was deemed unfit for raising a child.”
Fuck. Tony really should’ve kept track of the newbies. The two were sisters, if he recalled correctly. Sisters who had sworn to fight each other to the death at some point, but still sisters.
Now he
“What—” Steve stuttered. He took a good few steps back until he could look at the whole scene. Tony was currently standing right behind what Steve assumed were holographic versions of his parents. And, Steve realized, there was a younger version of Tony lying on the couch, as well.
to hook up with stuck up art profs. He got laid plenty, that’s what campus parties were for, after all. No one cared about his age there, and that was exactly how Tony wanted things to be.
Steve sat next to Sam. He’d changed into a black T-shirt and jeans. Over the growl of the engine he and Natasha discussed the best way to infiltrate the Helicarriers while they were still on the ground. They cut off as the tablet in Tony’s palm began to beep. He didn’t look down at it, didn’t need to, his black eyes still fixed on Steve. “Insight’s launching in sixteen hours.”
Steve’s eyes fluttered shut and his hand found Tony’s. “You’re a genius, I’m sure you can put two and two together.”
Tony bit his lip again, thinking for a moment before he looked at Steve apologetically. “Let’s talk to Bruce first. Inter-dimensional travel is tricky business and I’d rather not fuck everything up. Better keep the details to ourselves for now, alright?”
“Bless you,” Tony said sincerely, the old Lucifer showing through for one wicked, laughing moment.
TS 2:15 P.M.>WHO ARE YOU
Tony swung a repulsor at Giant-Guy, putting all of his considerable force into the shot, and had the satisfaction of seeing the Ant almost topple to the earth, bellowing in frustration.
And he
Outside, dawn was slowly creeping over the streets of New York. Tony’s hand snagged Steve’s, lifting it to his lips and kissing each of his knuckles.
Steve only grunted, grinding his erection against Tony’s abdomen and tucking his dress shirt out of his pants.
By now, the dramatics of their time at MIT was a well-loved memory, something to look back on and smile about.
Disappointment trickled into Steve’s mind, though he tried to keep it at bay. Tony was a busy man, of course he couldn’t linger on such things as morning kisses and late sleep-ins, no matter how much Steve would’ve loved to wake in his arms from time to time.
before meeting Steve. He hadn’t cared about much of anything despite enjoying a good buzz, a good fight, a good fuck—the more the merrier. He’d loved living the mortal life to its extremes, but he hadn’t cared much beyond that.
There was a long pause.
Steve stepped up to him, so close that Tony couldn’t help but take a step back. “Let me come with you, Tony. Please.”
Tony nodded, his hand resuming the artless patterns of comfort that drew across his back. “Not being able to help?” He smiled warmly when Steve glanced at him with surprise, obviously disliking that he was that simple to read. “It’s okay to just stand by for once, you know. Let someone else step in. Even for a super soldier.”
“Yeah, but we’re alone now, so I’ll call you Stark-Rogers as much as I like.”
she’d been winking at him—before she reached for a small, aged photograph on the coffee table. She pulled it close to her chest so Steve wouldn’t be able to look at it. “My grandson found this in the library. I think I once stole it from Howard.”
Tony gave him an exasperated look. “That’s… really helpful. Thanks.”
"Is Tony in…"
well, my suite has two bedrooms, too. No need to worry.”
Steve took a deep breath and forged ahead. “And
“No.” His eyes fluttered open. “Stay with me.”
"Alright," Steve said after a sigh. He couldn't refuse that pleading, almost desperate look in Tony's eyes. He had an inkling sense that that in itself might become a problem one day, but right now, he couldn’t care less. "Alright," he repeated. "Let's do that, for now." And he leaned in again to kiss Tony more fully. Any minute they weren't kissing felt like a waste of their time together.
Which made it all the harder to see Steve like this now.
That was a matter of opinion, but Tony didn’t feel like arguing. Instead, he turned to Pepper, when she walked back into the room, tension rolling off her shoulders. “Did you talk to Vi?”
“Never mind.” Tony yawned, groaning in pleasure when something popped—probably his back. The guy didn’t have a very good posture whenever he sat hunched over his work table “You’re just a lot easier to deal with this way.”
“Don’t be ridiculous, Tony wouldn’t break up with him. He’s been wallowing in lover’s grief for weeks.”
“It’s a combination of things—with Steve,” Barnes said. “He’s alright as long as he has a purpose. The army, SHIELD, the Avengers—he had a place. Not always a good one, otherwise he wouldn’t have worked as hard to close SHIELD down, but… he had something to hold on to. And he had you guys at his back if he needed you. But ever since the team split up… he’s… lost.”
Within a beat, a shadow fell over Tony’s face, and if Steve’s hands on his waist wouldn’t have been as firm as they were, he probably would’ve pulled away.
“Maybe not,” Sam said thoughtfully. A smile rose to his lips. “I know a guy.”
Steve and Sam shared a look that spoke volumes. “That’s not the way to go, we’ll have to make them see that,” Steve concluded. “I have a feeling Fury will have our back.”
“That’s kinda impolite,” Clint said with a scowl.
Rhodey tried not to let a huge grin split his face and failed. “Sure.”
“Shit.”
love you?”
"Okay." Bucky sighed, downing what remained of his drink and calling for another. "It's a big deal for you." He turned to look at Steve, leaning his elbow on the counter and a little towards Steve. "But if you're only getting riled up on my account, don't."
Tony nodded, and tried for a smile. “We’ll find a way.”
There was nothing Steve wanted more than that. Nothing in the whole new world.
However, the sad truth was, there weren’t a whole lot of other options. So Tony had been about to put it all to rest until the worst of the Sokovia fallout had been done with—until he could talk to agencies again and discuss their case with a little less baggage in tow—when Helen Cho had reached out to him with an idea that… by all means… had sounded absolutely crazy at first.
“Steve?” Tony asked, his eyes large.
JARVIS had always nagged him about his… well, might as well call it an infatuation, all things considered. Whenever Tony had complained about some argument he and Steve had had, JARVIS had insisted that Tony only fought Steve every step of the way because he was one of the only people who really got under his skin.
“Come sit down with me.” Tony waved him over to the research table. He picked up the sandwich, noting it was his favorite, before he took a huge bite. “Eat,” he said, and when Vision didn’t make any move, he rolled his eyes. “Listen, buddy, I’m not the guy to needle anyone about their daily routines, that’s Steve’s job, but you can’t let this drag you down.”
Tony’s face flushed a bit at the compliment and he tried to cover it up with an unimpressed huff. “He’s always showing me off,” he explained with an exaggerated sigh as he trailed after the two men. Steve sure had a nice backside, Tony noted, especially when he leaned down to lift the new fume hood.
Steve flopped back down on the bed. “Whassa matter with him?” he asked, his voice still sleepy. To Steve’s credit, it was the first night after they’d brought the infant home with them, and it still felt plenty unreal.
you mean?”
“Sweetheart,” Steve tried again, touching Tony’s arm to get his attention.
“Doesn’t matter,” he said.
"Right, uh, Steve, this is Natasha. Natasha, Steve." Bucky kept the introductions mercifully short, and while Natasha made no move to shake Steve's hand, she did smile at him, so Steve decided to put her on the okay-list and gave her a small smile in return.
“What I
“What else do you want to hear?”
Tony laughed, and his smile only turned soft when Steve stepped up to him. “I would marry you again in a heartbeat.”
“Oh, okay,” Steve said, drawing in a breath before pushing further, until he was buried to the hilt. He stayed like that for a long moment, getting his bearings.
Steve smiled. His head tilted as he regarded Tony. “As ready as I’ll ever be.”
As Steve turned back to Tony, his eyes were back to their natural brown, his stance immediately defensive. “It’s nothing,” he said, tone a little too insistent, and Steve didn’t believe him one bit.
. “I trust you,” Steve mumbled. “I just don’t like it.”
Steve heaved a great breath, his hands curling into fists at his side. “You’ve been shutting me out, whether you like to admit it or not. You got lost in Extremis, a little more every day. And you think so highly of what that virus can do or what it knows that you don’t even think it’s necessary to talk to me about these things anymore.”
“They’ll find out,” Tony said miserably. “They’ll find out it was me.”
A low breath left Steve’s lips, as his eyes travelled up and down Tony’s body. His body was different from how Steve would have imagined it. His back was more muscular, and the lines of his legs were more defined than he’d expected.
"You're not really gonna…" he asked then, breaking the kiss and staring into Tony's face, eyes flicking to that wicked mouth ever so often. "are you?"
with him as they’d made their way through the hallways. He’d been in his uniform, then, every hair had been in place, every button fastened, every crease crisply starched. Now, he was still wearing his uniform, but he looked as though a truck had hit him, his shoulders slouched and tired. His eyes looked weary, and his hair was a wild tumble.
“Is that what you need?” Tony whispered and Steve wondered idly if it was a rhetorical question. “I’ll give you what you need.”
“Then you haven’t been paying attention,” Bucky replied, his gaze once more on the trees beyond.
Tony’s breath hitched. “Absolutely.”
Rhodey… and now Steve.
leaning against the doorframe.
“Sorry,” he told his team as he jogged up the rear hatch. “I hope you haven’t been waiting too long. I got held up.”
“Let me rephrase that,” Tony said and now there was the hint of a threat in his voice. “Tell him or I will.”
The man leaned forward. For a moment, it actually looked like he wanted to reach for Tony’s hand, which had Tony draw his chair back so fast it screeched loudly on the linoleum floor.
“Steve…”
“I don’t need apologies, I need an explanation.
Tony brushed a thumb over Steve’s hand, and said nothing.
"Nice to meet you, Tony," he said, trying to school his voice into something casual. He was failing miserably, wasn't he? That's why he’d always avoided meeting new people.
Turned out Steve’s presumption had been right—this was definitely not a normal police station.
“No,” Tony replied, leaning over and brushing a kiss across Steve’s cheek. “It doesn’t.”
As he rounded the corner to his street, though, he paused. Or maybe ‘froze completely’ was a better word.
How did he even deserve this, again?
, there was also a friend of Barnes, some blonde muscled guy.
Tony dropped his gaze to the floor and sighed. “I shouldn’t have said all that,” he muttered. “In Siberia. Not to Bucky, and not to you. That was… uncalled for.”
To say Steve had been surprised when Carol had asked him to join Rhodes and Tony on the infamous eclipse-road trip would be the understatement of the century. Sure, he was aware that he, Sam, Buck and Natasha were probably just an occupational hazard and Rhodes had really only wanted his girlfriend to come along. Still. After
Tony immediately reached behind himself, placing his hand on Steve’s cock. Turning his head, he glared at him with impatience. “Not getting any younger here, damn it, come
Rhodey grinned and put an arm around Tony’s shoulders. “Come on, if nothing else, it’ll be worth a laugh.”
On the street, there had been a flicker of recognition. But now it was gone, and a part of him had known they would’ve wiped him again before sending him out to fight Steve. There was no reason for him to remember, especially after waiting so long for a savior that never came.
“Go away, Detective,” Tony said, letting just a hint of the Devil’s dark, commanding voice slip into those words. “Leave.
It had been a grueling couple of weeks, and Steve had been hoping to meet Tony for most of that time. The frustration of being apart and unable to see him mounted every day, and Steve himself had had the mind to just take his bike one day and go. The New Avengers were a strong bunch. They could be instructed over comm if any emergencies came about. But he hadn't had the chance to do that yet, and finding Tony at their facility made Steve's excitement rear up its head in less than a second. Tony had clearly made a surprise trip, if Steve were to judge by Tony's attire as he stood at the door, shifting his weight a little from leg to leg. Clad in one of his workshop slacks, a stained shirt and a casual blazer, Tony looked like he hadn't even checked himself in the mirror before heading over. Steve’s heart was racing as he let his eyes roam Tony’s body shamelessly, memories of their shared night, and morning, surfacing immediately.
for his touch. And the fact that he could feel Tony shuddering against him, rock-hard and leaking against his thighs, didn’t exactly help calm him down.
After a moment, Tony chuckled lowly, shifting a bit to make the noise stop. His body was half-draped across Steve’s, while his arm simultaneously tightened further around his torso. Tony shifted upwards, drinking in the sight. Steve’s blond hair was ruffled in the aftermath of their lovemaking and wild with sleep.
Tony announced on the team’s line.
“How do you like Monte Carlo these days?”
So he reached for a bottle and looked down on the label for a long moment. It was even one of the better kind. It was tempting, so tempting, and at the same time, not an option.
There was… so much to do. The city was a mess, and while the Maria Stark Foundation and numerous other charity foundations and private donors had given plenty of money, it would take a lot of time and work to restore New York to its former glory.
it felt.
“Whatever you decide—the team will deal with it. Whether we’re all staying here, or if we’re splitting up again… or if the two of you decide to take a timeout… we can deal with it. You don’t have to worry about that.”
Suddenly, a hand was on him. It roamed up his back and down his arm, paused to play idly with his short hair, then slid down his side until his warm fingers settled provokingly on his hip.
The words embraced Tony’s heart, and he knew then if he'd never known before: Whatever lay ahead was more than worth it. Whatever they had to face would be a fate shared. He felt the strength of Steve’s love encompass him wholly.
"Right, they demoted you, didn't they?" Bucky's tone was deceptively light, but when Steve turned to look at him his face screamed bitterness. Every time Steve looked at him he couldn't ignore the missing limb. Shame rushed through him. He really shouldn’t be complaining about his silly problems—it was such trivial stuff compared to Bucky's situation.
“It’s nothing,” Steve had whispered.
Whatever had transpired during the day really had taken its toll on him, Steve thought. Tony’s clothes were disheveled, the goatee frayed from too many strokes of his hand. And he looked ready to drop to a well-deserved sleep.
anything.
,” Steve intoned gravely, throwing Tony’s words right back at him. He saw a row of modified Iron Legion suits flying by, and finally managed to get to his feet again, pressing his shield against one robot’s neck until Thor flew by and decapitated it with Mjolnir.
“Don’t!” Steve said, and raised a hand in a defensive gesture. He shook his head, once more staring at the feathers that still littered the floor. They were softly glowing despite of the blood soaking into their white fabric.
They stayed like that for a long time, with Steve’s arms wrapped tightly around Natasha’s tiny form. Then, her hands were wandering to the top of his head, dragging it down a bit, so her mouth, petal-soft, could press a kiss against his cheek.
“The lights are caused by the collision of energetically charged solar particles with atoms in the magnetosphere, causing heat and plasma emission into the thermosphere,” Tony said, his voice hushed.
Even his shield, lying a few feet away from them, faded into nothing.
It still felt unreal… that Bucky was truly here, and that the both of them had somehow managed to find each other again, all those decades into the future.
. This was my choice, Natasha!”
“Not just sex,” Steve said, looking at Tony with as much sincerity as he could relay with his eyes only. “Everything. I want to… I want to share my life with you, for as long as you want.”
“But morning cuddles,” Tony whined, leaning up a bit so he could eye Steve a bit better. He was shifting his weight easily from one leg to the other, while pulling up his boxer briefs. “
Why did things like these always happen to him? Waking up in the future, seventy years later, knowing that each and every person he’d known was dead or would be very soon. And now: 2022.
In only a few hours, he’d fight Schmidt. He’d bring an end to this, and then, he would try to find help, and make those dreams go away. Perhaps it was time to end this impossible thing between them anyway. There were fifty years between them. Fifty years and only a few imaginary dreams they’d shared.
Tony wanted to answer him, tell him it was okay, that he was going to be fine, but all he could manage were faint mumbles. The last inch was the worst, anticipation and anxiety piquing Tony back to mild awareness, and Bruce seemed to have a hell of a time trying to get it out the way it got in. He moved the blade, and Tony groaned a complaint, his eyes shutting as tight as his loose muscles would let him. No one spoke, and Steve just held him closer.
Steve inhaled him appreciatively, clutching Tony to him with sudden possessive restriction. For a moment he simply let himself revel in the steady rhythm of Tony’s heart beating against his chest. “He shot you,” he murmured.
“Kiss me more.” Tony’s hands linked around Steve’s neck in a blink. Steve’s kisses peeled Tony’s reservations away without trying; drinking him in as though he’d been starving for him. As though the distance between them had been slowly killing him as well.
For a moment no one spoke, and then Bucky shifted his weight and sniffed a quick breath through his nose. "Give me your phone," he said, holding out his hand for it, and Steve smiled as he realized Bucky was trembling a little.
, and Steve—with a huge smile on his lips—took one step back when he was sure Ian would manage those few more inches as well. There, he slouched down, squatting on the floor with a broad grin, and took Ian’s stretched arms in his hands when he’d reached him.
Sometimes Steve just had to accept that the things coming out of Tony's mouth made no sense. This was one of those cases. To the best of Steve's knowledge, there was no such thing as sex-pollen, and even if there were, he could personally say that the plant they'd been fighting did not have that.
Tony took a sip, once the coffee was finished, then walked over to Steve. Flopping down next to him, he glanced at the book cover.
find out what he thinks about Ross before we take any action.”
“Ah, Tony already warned me you were undermining your skills,” Pepper said. “We’ll see. I happen to know one or two things about art, and if
For a second, Tony thought he might have seen a flicker of recognition on Barnes’ face; a flicker which quickly proved to be nothing. Tony’s heart fell. He should have predicted the possibility that Barnes wouldn’t recognize Steve at all. And he should have stopped Steve from getting his hopes up.
Tony huffed, pointing first to his black eyes, then to one camera on the ceiling.
all the time!”
Steve smiled, a bit disbelieving that Tony would admit something like that. “Don’t say such things. If you say things like that we really must be close to dying.”
“It’s okay,” Tony said, voice amused. “My invite wasn’t meant as an obligation.”
“What time is it?” Tony asked.
“We had a lot of support,” Steve said simply, returning the smile she cast him.
Tony blinked and only stared at the woman’s face for what felt like an eternity.
Steve woke before dawn, slipping out of bed. Tony slept on, the look on his face peaceful. Content. A soft smile stole across Steve’s features and he reached out to smooth a stray curl of black hair.
Pepper’s arms were folded tightly across her chest and her face was twisted in a furious, heated mask. Her body vibrated as her dangling right foot moved rapidly up and down. Every once in a while, she’d close her eyes and take a deep breath and it was during those moments that Tony thought she might finally calm down but then she’d open her eyes, take one look at him and start the process all over again.
It probably spoke volumes that Obi’s words didn’t really hit him as hard as they probably should. Tony
Tony huffed. “I don’t know—how about when we all met?”
“Something wrong?” he asked as he caught Tony staring at him intensely, but Tony only shook his head as he turned.
Tony huffed, genuinely surprised. He hadn’t expected that. And it was actually a bit funny, that in the midst of it all, they had both searched for a way to simply talk to each other. “Was that—”
“He slapped you, obviously,” Tony sputtered, cradling the baby’s head protectively. “If Ian was—”
They were all seated on the many sofas, or in Wanda’s case, on one of the huge seating cushions on the floor. She sat right next to Vision’s legs, not touching him at all, but close nonetheless, and suddenly Tony wondered how much he had missed in the last months.
After he’d passed Albany, he exited the freeway and drove a little through the countryside. When he came by a diner, he decided to grab something to eat and parked his bike. There were only one or two guests, and Steve greeted the young waitress on his way in, keeping the sunglasses on for the time being. People usually respected his privacy, or didn’t recognize him in the first place, but he didn’t want to risk it today.
“For taking that chance. Defending me when you didn’t even know if it was the right thing to do.”
“She likes red wine,” Steve offered when he saw him reaching for the bottle of Chardonnay.
He missed talking to Tony, hearing his thoughts, and his worries. He missed their arguments that drove him out of his mind most of the time, but always made him realize an aspect he hadn’t considered before. He hadn’t fully realized how accustomed he’d become to hearing Tony’s perspective, but that’s how it was. They often had different opinions, and sharing them with each other usually wasn’t pleasant business, but that’s what you got when you were honest with each other. And Steve preferred being yelled at from time to time, when it meant they weren’t keeping the important stuff from one another.
Was that one of his
, Tony thought to himself. Before he could get a word out, however, Steve let his shield sink. Just a fraction, but it was there.
And then, they just stared at each other through the mirror, apparently both at a loss for words.
Hope you enjoyed the first part! This will be updated regularly :)
…because it felt a lot like the first domino stone of many had just fallen. And he had no idea if there was a way to keep them all from tumbling to the ground.
Spider-Man had managed to wrap up Ant-Man, while Vision, Rhodey and Natasha were keeping the others in check. In the distance, Tony saw a de-Hulked Bruce getting shackled by Ross’ men. He looked terrible, his skin full of ashes, but when he caught Tony looking, he cast him a small smile.
—” he yelled when he saw them, then glanced up just in time to see Wanda’s magic shattering what appeared to be the ground level of an old control tower. She let it fall to the side and Tony watched in horror as Steve staggered and both he and Bucky hurtled into the last space beneath it. Debris crashed, and then it was over. The marines couldn’t follow them, which had been Wanda’s plan, probably, but now Tony wasn’t sure if Steve and Bucky made it to the other side.
Steve raised a surprised brow. “What way?”
Even after all these months, he was still attuned to his presence. He tried to pretend that the way Steve—before he’d realized that he’d traveled through time—had been smiling at him with eyes full of warmth, hadn’t meant anything. But the scene kept replaying in his head and a lump rose in his throat.
Heavy footsteps landed on the debris around Steve.
learn from the best,” he commented, and the words had Tony stop in his tracks. He glanced up at Vision, and while his expression was both apathetic and full of… this weird sort of worldly wisdom… there was also something he had never seen before.
Eventually, he couldn’t hold his own weight anymore and slumped against Steve’s back. He breathed heavily, body exhausted, as he pressed little kisses against Steve’s neck with reverie.
Steve shrugged. “Calmed you down, didn’t I?”
Tony sighed, delicately running a hand up Steve’s arms to link behind his neck. He brought their foreheads together, rejoicing in the contact. “I’m not mad at you,” he whispered against Steve’s lips. “Of course I’m not. Occupational hazard, right? I knew the risk going in. We all do. We’re a team, or did you already forget your own words?”
* * *
He looked peaceful, and Steve stood there for a long time, watching him sleep. It was hard to figure out why he hadn’t seen it before—how vulnerable Tony really was. He’d been blindsided by the pomp and glamour, by the clever words and easy grins. Tony hadn’t made it easy to look beyond all that.
Agent Romanoff was the first to enter the large interrogation room. She was followed by Agent Barton and a man Steve hadn’t met yet. A man who wore an honest-to-God

He had no idea why Natasha had suddenly decided that this was the best time to bring them back together. Either she knew something he didn’t, or… or she had sensed that Tony had reached his breaking point.
Which meant—
He liked to think not, but that rage… it had been everywhere inside of him. Knowing that Barnes had strangled his mother—his
“You know I need to do this,” Steve said quietly, searching his gaze. “If it was Rhodey…”
There was a short silence and a huff of air. “I’m not gonna complain. Just being allowed this…” He gestured meaningfully at the room. “This, the whole team—It’s more than a sickly boy from Brooklyn could’ve hoped for.”
“Gonna suck y’off in the morning,” Tony mumbled sleepily. “You don’ get a say in it.” As if to emphasize his words, he clumsily reached for Steve’s crotch and squeezed it once.
All of them smiled. Bucky looked at Tony as he laughed. “Do you remember the time when we didn’t know who Doom was?”
, Tony’s mind supplied in a haze and he responded with an appreciative hum. And true enough, Steve’s arm were around him, pulling him against his chest while he ever-so-clumsily pressed kisses against Tony’s lips.
“I mean, I know I messed up with Ultron, so leaving the team felt like my only option at the time, and I don’t really regret it. I knew they couldn’t trust me anymore.” He swallowed.
“How can you—”
Truthfully, this sort of assignment was usually done without the Avengers’ help. It was all very basic. Charge in, free the hostages, leave. Something Fury only sent them on to allot a breath of fresh air. Maybe Steve should’ve questioned their being here a bit more. If he’d given it more thought, he’d realized there had to be more to it than just a hostage situation.
Steve merely laughed at that as he pulled Tony's hand up to kiss it again before letting go in favor of getting on with making breakfast. It didn't take very long, and answering Tony's various questions about the process proved to be fun, too.
Steve twirled the USB stick around between his fingers, frowning at the SHIELD symbol. Maybe it wasn’t fair to be so angry at an inanimate object, and maybe it was childish to want to toss it outside of the van and watch it smash to smithereens. It sure as hell was irrational thinking that none of this would’ve happened if Natasha hadn’t retrieved the data. He couldn’t help it, however, and knew he had to focus his anger on the task at hand.
Strange. This one is weirdly incompetent.”
Of course he didn’t remember. This was going to be great. “Yes—I’m gonna leave. Still got that apartment in Brooklyn, so I won’t be far away. I’ll leave the city for two or three weeks, but after that, I’ll be ready on call.”
He fixed things.
. Why did you even pretend to live with us?”
In the shadows surrounding Tony, he kept seeing his face. The horror in his azure blue eyes that had overcome him once the initial shock had faded. He kept seeing Steve—a version of Steve who was truly terrified just by looking at him—and it was driving Tony mad.
“Are you actually asking me if I’d turn down a blowjob?” Tony asked, his expression amused. That was, until the door of the workshop opened and fast steps neared them.
“Sokovia,” Tony agreed. “He wanted to make a difference, I suppose. I mean, we won’t know because we dropped a building on him while we were kicking ass.”
Taking a deep breath, Tony pointed towards the time machine. “That was the last adjustment,” he said. “Everything’s good to go now. We shouldn’t miss your window.”
Tony schooled his expression as he leaned his hip against the bar counter. Slowly, the fact that Steve was
and scarily meaningful and so… so fucking
Mentally, he answered the call, tracing it with Extremis before the line was even up. “I didn’t forget about the meeting, Maria.”
“Look,” Steve said enthusiastically, “the late ghost tour starts from the visitor center. And that looks a lot better than all of those crazy Halloween tours, anyways. Do we have the time for that?”
Kissing Tony was… like tasting food after starving for a thousand years, quenching thirst after days of being parched. Every time he kissed Tony, it took him by surprise completely, as if his lips were connected to every nerve of his body.
Tony ignored the half-questioning looks Natasha fired their way. Nothing seemed to matter at that point—nothing save for collecting their mutual people and getting as far away from each other as possible to figure out what the hell had happened. To get to neutral ground until they’d see each other again.
, he thought. Dating a teenager should've made him more cautious, but that wasn't something to dwell on right now.
Tony nodded in understanding, carding his fingers across Steve’s scalp. “We’ll help him get through this. I’ll do everything I can, I promise.”
