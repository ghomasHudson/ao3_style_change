That surprised a snort out of Tony. "Well, that's a new one. But you're at a truck stop, I'm pretty sure you can find a ride."
"Sounds like him. But the clave goes on," said Tony with a shrug. He really didn't want to think about his dad in the postcoital glow.
He trailed more notes after the first -- the benefit of having a price-hiked luxury pet trade outside of SI, a note to engineer something good for the truckers, to keep vets on staff, and even have a bring your dog or cat or tiny dinosaur or whatever to work day. He had a feeling Pepper had known he'd like this one, she usually put something fun on the bottom of the stack.
"For sex work?" asked Steve, but a glance showed a pleased little smile on his face.
"Of course, sir," replied JARVIS. "I'll have the menus available to you in your rooms whenever you like, Mr. Rogers."
Tony Stark, the CEO of SI's corp and the most important man in the entire clave.
"Good arm candy is hard to find," said Tony with a shrug. He dug into his food, looking pleased as he chewed, swallowed, and took a sip of his drink. "The rest, well. If you actually find your bedroom duties onerous, I'd prefer you opt out. I can pay someone who likes it easily enough."
Tony slid his hands around that trim waist and gave in and kissed him before answering, wanting to see if those lips felt as good as he'd remembered. "Definitely still open, and all details are up for negotiation." Tony kissed him again. "I wouldn't want you to be bored."
Steve's tongue knew all the best tricks, his lips formed the perfect soft-tight ring to slide through, and he sucked like he'd never wanted anything more than Tony's dick in his mouth. Tony knew he couldn't stay for too long away from his personal security, not even here in the middle of nowhere, so he made the most of the moment, dialing his sensitivity up and holding back his orgasm for long enough that his thighs were shaking when he finally let go in a burst of nonsense-static and white-out pleasure.
They were silent for long minutes, just taking in the quiet evidence of life beyond the corps and creds that ruled the globe now.
"Cash or what?" said on of them, eyeing Steve up like a side of beef.
Once Steve had a plan, he was a man on a mission. He took a quick shower so his few toiletries could dry while he packed, then got started multitasking. He pulled up a screen with every bill he had, which wasn't a lot, and started closing accounts out one by one. He'd run the bed's cleaning cycle one more time before he left, but the linens went with the room, so the packing took almost as little time as the bills. His landlord expressed regret for losing him, but it was just as much of a polite fiction as his reply. She'd have the spot filled by nightfall with another sex worker; there was always a waiting list.
"You're the best," said Steve, giving their hand a chivalrous kiss with a wink over the top and the tip underneath. "I'm all done, if you'll introduce me?"
Steve shook his head, but he kissed Tony again anyway, those big hands framing Tony's face like he was something precious. "I don't think that's gonna be a problem, honey."
He licked his lips, trying to figure out if he wanted things to work out with Tony.
"I'd already decided on SI, if they'll have me. I met Stark once, years ago. Seems like a good enough omen, them being first on your list." Steve stood up and gave a little shimmy of his hips as he slid his jeans down to reveal his naked everything. Underwear was a specialty item in his line of work, and Tony hadn't requested it.
"Oh, uh, I'm really just here for the jack?" His eyes flashed in the camera, real orbs behind some of the finest tech glasses money could buy.
The photo next to it was an artistic nude lit in antiquated bi flag colors, not that Tony minded. As long as he could get his data sent, the rest was just gravy.
"There's a few claves that always need workers," said Tony, staring off into those glasses of his while Steve got him out of his shirt, belt, shoes, and socks. "SI, of course, hm. No one wants to work for HYDRA, that's why they kidnap. SHIELD's not bad, very loyalist, though. They'll put you through some shit for citizenship. SWORD's worse, honestly, but if you want spacers they're the best." He blinked and shrugged. "Sorry, you probably didn't need any of that."
Steve went over and helped, wanting his hands on Tony and not, for once, just to check for hidden weapons or biotech. "Don't you know all of us on the strip have some dream to shoot for? Only mine's not too big, just a spot in a clave and good solid work. Sex work if that's what that they need me for, or whatever else, I don't much mind, really."
The smile he got back was surprisingly genuine; the guy must not have activated his sex work chip yet, or else he just really liked feeding people. Either way, Tony made quick work of both the food and the negotiation: he had the cred to make this guy's week, and saw no reason not to use one of the clean chips he'd brought with him to pay for this kind of thing. Well, more for the data than the sex, but he did like sex and never minded paying a professional for their time and service.
"Yeah, of course. JARVIS, set him up with the custom order screen when he's ready to go shopping. Don't show him the prices," said Tony.
"Of course she did," said Steve, shaking his head. "It's mostly birds up this high, right?"
And weirdest of all, Tony Stark was still the handsome, offbeat man he'd been in Steve's room.
"That's mighty generous of you," said one of the quiet ones, voice rough. A smoker, probably meth lites, but most of them didn't smoke in their cabs. Steve's enhancements wouldn't let him be affected by the secondhand smoke, but he hated the smell.
He paid and shut off the hardline, paid the little credit he'd run with the diner, and then hefted his duffle and started the deep-clean cycle on the way out. His entire life fit in so little space, but at the same time, his stash of credit, both hard currency and in his various accounts, was worth a lot more than clothes or tchotchkes.
With this week's rent already paid, 5K was enough to get him into SI territory and set him up with temp space until he could figure out what citizenship costs were. "Well, if I didn't have somewhere else in mind, I'd offer to just follow you home for that," said Steve, making the chip vanish.
“The nickname? I didn’t know they registered with you.”
After Steve called Tony out in the yoga studio that day, he’d gone back to Bucky and Steve’s and learned all the things he thought he already knew. Bucky was a vigilante assassin, but for hire for Universal Balance Causes only - which all had to be run through Steve’s membership in the Warlock Council. While Bucky had been freed from the brainwashing that came courtesy of Vlad’s torture, he wasn’t fully free of the trauma - since no one ever was. Finding a way to redeem the skill set he now had and had never wanted was part of his recovery.
“That’s specific,” Steve replied.
“I’m sure it will,” Tony said with a sigh. “But it could damage his liver in the process, and that’s a big organ to have fucked with.”
Tony shook his head in confusion. “To have less lower back pain?”
Steve laughed, and was gratified to hear that the man had stopped reciting. His fingers were still flying and his breathing needed work, so Steve forged on. “I couldn’t’ve found Tanzania on a map, but I said sure and started applying. I’ve always been obsessed with water - how powerful it is, how much we need to have power over it to live, so the idea of putting off college for a little while and learning about water in places that didn’t have water treatment plants sounded pretty cool.
"You are gonna do just fine with SI," said Tony, eyes, roaming over Steve's body. "You're practically built like the poster boy."
"What aren't you telling me?" asked Steve, taking the token. He was still naked, which was extremely distracting, but he must've taken his chip offline because his boner had gone from chiseled to wilted.
He ate at the diner, still pondering whether he'd want to be a kept companion, whether he'd chafe at the restrictions or finally feel like he had a home. Steve knew a lot of that would depend on Tony, so he turned his brain to the man himself.
"I, uh. I'm getting an idea," said Steve, going over to help move plates to the table. "Hey, buddy, you're a good old bot, aren't you?"
Tony's brain was still swimming with the data, with JARVIS's voice keeping him posted on the Roxxon activity and the visuals on his glasses running a hundred other numbers past him, some of them straight into his various chip enhancements to be handled on a subconscious level. He managed something like intelligent conversation, but until he dumped everything he was holding, he'd be too much up in his own head to make any kind of decisions.
"They're not all gone," said Tony, bumping shoulders. "Maybe I'll get you a puppy as your first big present. Companions like that, right? Presents?"
Steve finally remembered his own food and dove in, then had to stop and just process that this was real, honest food, grown and cooked and served up at the right temperature. Not reconstituted or replicated, just...food. "Uh, wow, okay. Do you really eat junk food when you could eat real food?"
And man, he did good work.
SI lived off those edge-case innovations, but it thrived because Pepper was there to tell people No when Tony always wanted to say Yes.
Tony sighed and pulled up more of the pet proposal, a whole range of animals and the cost to get started, flagging his personal top three and making a few more notes about care, feeding, and medical. All the SI citizens got health care gratis, and he'd be stupid not to extend that to the pets when it would all feed data back to the project. Anyone with a pet would get a food allowance for it, and the few people who didn't want one could get some other small luxury with the extra cred.
Steve barked out a laugh. "No, nothing like that. I've always wanted to paint, actually, and I've heard there's skill chips that'll start you out with the materials without overriding your aesthetic."
"The Wheel of Food. JARVIS invented it for when I'm indecisive, so right now it's tuned to my preferences, but he'll learn yours and take them into account. I'm told it settles a lot of lunchtime disputes down among the minions."
"That's her way of telling me she forgives me for stopping to recruit you after the data transfer," said Tony with a shrug. He stood and spread his arms out, knowing the view behind him was impressive. "Welcome to SI."
No one starved in his clave, a fact that helped both in attracting good recruits, and weeding out the assholes who thought everyone's life had a work-value price on it.
"Depends on what extras you want besides the bacon," said Steve, going a little more sultry, slipping into his professional role. He thumbed the readout and said, "Data's 1500, shit, you used a fuckton. 7 for the green. Bacon's on me."
Steve laughed and walked right around the desk, offering Tony his hand. "Steve Rogers."
"You gonna pee on me or something?" asked Steve, eyebrows going into his hairline. Last time he'd had an offer like that, he'd had to pay for a whole new bedding set and heal up for two days. That guy had been an asshole, though, and Tony didn't seem like it.
The man moved into the room, taller than he looked, and grinned. "I really do have to use your jack first, if you want to go get food?"
: Sex & Net
He ate three blue plate specials, and palmed a 250-cred chip to be a tip, as thanks for feeding him while he'd lived here he past few months. With Tony's token, he could afford to pay it forward, just as the man had said.
"Good to meet you, Jarvis," said Steve, beaming up at the pin-camera over the door, which should have been invisible but apparently not to Steve's eagle eyes. Or whatever enhancements he had, anyway.
"Oh," said Steve, "Just thinking about having you for dessert."
Tony gave him a slow, sexy grin. "Well, then, it won't matter that it's optional, will it?"
Coffee appeared in his line of sight, and Tony looked up, blinking back into the real world. "Oh, thanks," said Tony. "Sorry, most of my office work happens up here," he explained, tapping his temple. "Enhanced genius and all that."
"You don't want to, uh, date someone?" said Steve. He knew it was often called other things these days, but he'd been frozen a long time.
"It's fine, you said you had work," said Steve. He leaned in and kissed Tony's hair, soft and warm, more affection than Tony had expected from a companion but not unwelcome. "Pepper sent in an aide with the contract, I'm looking it over while you work."
Tony chuckled. "Well, that's all I can give you a personal reference for, but I can afford to put you up for a few while you figure it out." That was an understatement, but what the hell. Tony hadn't had a kept boy before; it'd be something new for people to die mad about. "You could just be mine, personally."
Tony chuckled. "You'll see. Just come when you're ready," he said, sitting up and pulling his brain together. "I'll give you a token that'll get you in the door."
"I will enjoy bribing you," said Steve. "Just to, uh, be clear. That I want to do that."
"Nah, that's Pepper. And I let some of my R&D heads have veto power over their own areas of expertise. I'm really only king of my personal domain. Keeps me from losing perspective." Tony pulled up the next proposal in the line and scanned the abstract, letting JARVIS plop the relevant data straight into his brain once had context. It was an edge idea, minimally viable unless they could hit on the big eureka moment the proposal suggested was just around the corner, so Tony flagged it maybe and tossed it over to Pepper. Some departments could afford to try out the weird ideas, but others were already too close to their budget cap to add in one more.
"You know," said Tony, panting and staring at Steve's very boring ceiling, "I'm an SI citizen. I can get you in, set you up with an interview."
"That's fair," said Steve. He knew that a high-end companion was considered more worthy of a man like Stark than some normie, and if Stark married it would be for the good of the corp and clave. The problem was, Steve wasn't a high-end companion. "Can I get an upgraded chip through you? My companion chip is fine for truckers but it seems like you'll need me for more than comfort and pleasure."
Tony chuckled. "Real food takes time. I trust you'll make sure to get me to take the time. I will be very happy to be bribed with sex."
A restaurant name flashed, and then a full menu came up. "The highlighted items are sir's favorites, and a random selection are already included in the order," explained JARVIS politely.
Steve chuckled. "It's supposed to go the other way around, I think, but sure."
In no time at all, Steve found himself in front of the man himself and holding a contract worth more cred than he'd ever seen in his life.
It was something he did not have in common with his dad, but given the prosperity SI had seen since Tony took over, he didn't worry overmuch about the many ways they'd been different, in the end.
"Aren't you the top of the line?" said Steve, clearly surprised. He slid over, leaving Tony room to sit back in his chair.
"Sure, sure. Come on up, then." Steve buzzed him up, not bothering to put on any more clothing or even do up his pants. He wanted a chance to have that guy's fussy little beard tickle his balls, or at least to have the guy's wallet fill his tip jar.
"Oh, um..." Steve trailed off, scanning the menu. "Are there some calorie-dense options for mod support?"
Maybe overbearing was how Tony cared?
“Jefferson,” Tony repeated. “JARVIS will make sure you have a room nearby, you stay as long as you need.”
And then there was the Peter of it all.
They sat for a few moments in silence before the man continued. “Seriously, thank you.”
But why would Tony care?
They’d started dating, privately at first, before being outed by a particularly lecherous photographer about two years in. Looking back, Steve was glad those first two years were in private, because they had to work through a lot. Steve had been fine with getting spoiled when he was a booty call, but not when he was a boyfriend. He made a fine living as a graphic illustrator for Simon & Schuster, with some freelancing on the side. He appreciated that his boyfriend did not only not know the price of milk, but had
“He doesn’t belong in jail,” Steve said, his teeth grinding together as he spoke.
Steve sighed. “I’ll head out for a run, then. If I’m needed, please just call me.”
“I know.”
Bucky was quiet for a moment. “Didn’t he make you sign about fourteen NDAs? Can you really be telling me that shit?”
“Did I mention my buddy and his wife are newlyweds? Getting out of the house is a gift,” Steve said with a chuckle. “I was gonna read a little bit of my book anyway, why don’t I just sit here with you while I do?” Steve waved his iPhone at the guy to indicate that was where the book lived.
“While I do adore Ms. Potts, I am not in a hurry to be in her employ.”
“Okay, again, we didn’t know, but we have -”
“Any of them preferred over Atlas Shrugged?”
Steve flipped him off. “He’s not even supposed to be on today.”
Now it was 2015 and everyone still knew that Captain America was an Alpha. But no one knew that Steve Rogers craved to be knotted.
The man shook his head. “Honestly, I’m okay now and my ride is on its way.”
Steve gasped and pressed their arms together without even thinking. More emotions flooded his body than he knew what to do with. At the same time, he felt Tony’s teeth break the skin on his neck - ever so gently - as he simultaneously moved inside Steve to scrape the knot against Steve’s rim - and he knew what was happening.
She was quiet, but he heard what she didn’t say.
Rhodey was quiet for a few beats, which Tony knew was even more dangerous than sarcasm. “The way he looked at you, and the way you look at him? I’m not talking about fucking, Tones. I’m talking about family, and if you would use your words, I think this one might be good for you. That’s all.”
Steve curled his hands into fists, and then uncurled them in an attempt to calm himself down. “Listen, pal, we didn’t know, but his fiancé and the officiant are on their way, so can we -”
“Steve, please.”
“They’re your family.”
“JARVIS, wake up.” Tony hadn’t wanted to hear Jarvis’s voice when Jarvis wasn’t there and he was lost in memories, but now, it was time to call Steve and Peter to dinner. “Let Steve know dinner is ready, so he can untangle Peter from his uncles.”
“Your six months of married bliss brings a lot of wisdom, does it?”
“I don’t even know what this is!” Steve exclaimed.
“Fuck.”
“I’ve always loved the idea of the Peace Corps,” Tony said, “and you are exactly who I always thought would volunteer for them. Listen, I’m a pretty big nerd and I’d love to hear all about water, but I have a thing to go to soon that requires me to be not in pajamas. If you’re up for it, just call Stark Imagineering and ask for Jarvis, and maybe I can hear more when I don’t feel like I’ve been run over by seven Formula 1 cars?”
“Got it,” Steve said. “Do you need me today? Or can I do this with them?”
Dr. Cho, Pepper, and some other doctors began to talk back and forth, using a lot of words and phrases Steve didn’t understand, so he just made sure to keep his eyes on Tony. A few moments later, Tony called for him.
“Anyway, that was ten years ago. Ended up all over most of East Africa, and I’m just back now. Crashing with my buddy and his wife, and they’re… They’re generous, right? But I know I’m in their space, I just haven’t ever actually lived on my own and I'm a little scared to do that.”
“You don’t know what I think about him, about who he is, or about what he does.”
“Tony Stark who invented the Andoluvian Particle Accelerator?”
“Because it’s my
Tony stuck out his hand. They shook on it.
“You said you made the app, right?”
for more on these yahoos. You can also submit prompts and cajole me into writing faster - it usually works. If you're on Discord, I'm definitely there, too, and probably hanging in the
Tony was quiet, but began to trace his fingers up and down Steve’s cock - featherlight and yet tender. “So what do you want? Do you want the world to know you are soulmates with the black sheep of the Stark family? I’m a hooker, Steve.”
“So this is a good time to tell you that Nat sent shortbread home?”
Steve followed the voice.
“Or something,” Tony smiled. They stared at each other for a few beats before Steve gently kissed Tony and gathered him up into his arms.
Tune in next time for more pining and even less clear communication.
“Um, a hot blonde man? Beard, longish floppy hair, shoulder to waist ratio of a superhero and thighs that could -”
“Why didn’t you call?”
“It’s not public,” the man replied. “Hasn’t been in the six months I’ve lived here. If it was public before and you had dreams of matrimony on the site you first fucked each other, then a, I’m super sorry your sex life sounds awful and b, you’re shit out of luck, because now it’s private. So you can take down that pathetic looking prom photo backdrop and get off my beach.”
“I do,” Tony nodded.
“Fuck you,” Steve said, and was shocked to realize there were tears gathering in his throat.
After dinner, that’s when he cried in his husband’s arms, finally exorcising an age-old grief that he hadn’t let himself feel before. Then, having released some of the pent up emotion, he could focus so he looked through the recipe book to figure out how to make the mac and cheese.
“Nice,” Brock said. He had a rumble to his voice that Steve’s body responded to. He’d had a weakness for quote unquote bad boys for most of his life. It was one of the reasons Bucky had hated every single person he’d ever dated - Buck’s opinion was Steve deserved someone who Sarah Rogers would love, too, and not just someone Steve’s dick loved.
to, but only for his hand to stop when a crinkled sheet of paper fluttered to the floor at his feet.
His smile widened when he recalled that it was also the time he had realized that he was actually attracted to the most
Any other time he would have snorted at the irony of using his father’s lighter to burn Steve’s letter, yet the only thing he felt was a bleak sort of numbness.
Before he had truly gotten to know Tony, he hated the long time it took for the man to get the hell out of his suite when they were going to a gala hosted by the Stark Industries or anyone who invited them. It irritated Steve how disrespectful the man was with other people’s time and how he only laughed the blond’s worries off by saying it was actually fashionable to arrive late to such important events.
“Does that mean I have to call you

Looking at the last one was the most painful because to Tony it showed a part of the man he loves—

His hand dropped the blasted frame anyway.

Another lie he offered to Tony take.
member of the team. His fingers continued their careful exploration of Tony’s face, lightly following the slope of his cute nose, traversing to his slightly scratchy cheeks then surveying the path made by that beloved van Dyke to those supple lips. The moment his fingers made contact with the soft flesh, Tony’s nose scrunched and his eyelids fluttered.
Steve was jolted from that little trip down memory lane when the genius tapped his shoulder, finally decided on that artfully, almost careless, tousled look that Steve liked on him.
“Tony.”
Tony gave the letter one more glance, just to confirm that, yes, he was ready to never see it again. Ironically, this last look was the hardest to accept.
The double whammy was that Howard actually used Steve as the avatar for Tony’s insecurities—setting him up as a yardstick to measure his own son by and declaring the brunet lacking. Whenever Steve recalled times he threw Howard back in Tony’s face before, not only did he feel like an ass, he also couldn’t help but wish for a time machine just so he could punch the elder Stark in the jaw. Jury’s still out if he would be tempering his strength to avoid

“Leave me alone, I’m a senior citizen.”
“It’s Peggy Carter, or Aunt Peggy as I call her. Turns out my
The soldier quickly flung the sheets to the side and dashed towards Tony, catching the man into a hug then lifting him up by the back of his thighs.
The momentary embarrassment was worth it though, Tony’s smile was as radiant as the sun.
Oh, then again, Howard had a point. The man was brave, just not where it counts the most.
Steve rolled his eyes and shot back with a grin, “Well, I thought it was fine since you’re my baby, Tony.”
Steve nearly bit his tongue when he felt the brunet’s hand
Blue eyes opened to golden light that slipped through the gap in the blinds and fell over his face.  It would’ve been irritating to Steve to find out that he had missed out on his early morning run, but he couldn’t care less at the moment as his eyes met the peaceful features of the figure plastered to his side, cuddling him. Tony’s head laid on his chest whilst his left arm was thrown over Steve’s torso and a matching leg was over the blond’s legs. A wayward knee was dangerously close to the part of Steve’s anatomy that he was certain had developed a Pavlovian response to Tony’s close proximity. The damned thing apparently hadn’t had enough action from last night and was obviously eager for more. Steve sighed, while he would love to go through with what his lower half wanted, he wanted to indulge in something else first. Something he did every morning, ever since he and Tony made love that first time.
“Hey, stranger.” Tony murmured, voice still hoarse from sleep.
His heart simultaneously sang and broke at the radiant smile Tony graced him with as he mouthed ‘Thank you’ to Steve.
Steve did end up unable to fight the grin, shaking his head, “I was thinking along the lines of bringing the food down here, we’ll eat then you could go back to work.”
Steve nodded thoughtfully. People considered it common knowledge that Tony Stark avoided meetings like the plague and ditched galas as much as possible unless he needed to schmooze, but if there was anything of the sort that the genius would be willing to show up to—as in no threats of stilettos from Miss Potts whatsoever—it would be charity events. Especially those that aimed to help children and the ill.
The brunet spun around in his rolling chair and pushed his goggles up his head, making his rat’s nest of dark locks even more unruly. He regarded Steve with narrowed eyes, before smirking,
“Well,
FRIDAY might have also been calling him, maybe he had put her on mute because it stopped.
Howard’s legacy…it was both Tony’s blessing and curse.
Tony lifted his head and smiled, “That’s the best part—she
Same as with engines, Howard was the blueprint.
He grabbed the frame from its perch, fully intending to smash the fucking thing to pieces. God, if there ever really was one out there,
Tony croaked a chuckle, tears falling as he read the next line.
“I thought you changed your mind…I wouldn’t mind you know. I know you’d rather not—“
Anyone else would have ran out if they felt what Tony did, he knew FRIDAY had one of her cameras focused on him. Her eyes on him, vigilant yet gentle like a caress.
Steve knew he had to get moving before Tony got to the location. He couldn’t risk getting yelled at by the pint-sized (God help him, if Tony found out about that) spitfire of a groom. If the engineer got there at the altar and found Steve missing, he’d probably suit up and repulsor Steve’s balls into nothingness.
They had finally reached the end.
Tony knew he looked out of his wits, sitting on the floor while simultaneously laughing and crying over the letter sent to him by his own lover that nearly decapitated him in a Nazi bunker. He could be scaring the hell out of FRIDAY yet, he couldn’t help it. The tears were blurring the words and his surroundings but they just wouldn’t stop.
The blond smiled, “Well back in the day, she was ordering soldiers around and they obeyed without hesitation. Hell, Howard wouldn’t dare cross her.”
He moved back and clasped a hand on the brunet’s shoulder, “Hey, none of that, Buck. You’re my best friend and it’s your wedding. Like hell I’m going to miss it.”
Tony continued to read, only two more paragraphs and he’d be done with this masochistic urge to relive building and the shattering of the, now he gathered to be, fantastical romance he had with one Steven Grant Rogers.
Steve laughed at the times Tony grumbled and complained that every time she bought a new mascara, Natasha always tested it out on him to check if she should stick to a particular brand or not, though Steve knew he enjoyed it. For all the complaining he showed everyone, Tony never took it off unless he had to wash up or sleep. Alright, maybe Steve enjoyed them too, because the mascara made Tony’s eyes look bigger and more arresting when he looked at Steve. Even Clint had joked about it being the two’s own ‘sibling thing’ since his and Natasha’s were stealing hoodies and sweatshirts from the others.
him through his uniform pants and the rush of arousal in his system almost made him dizzy. His own hands tightened on the man’s waist.

First word in and Tony was already crumbling.
As he stared at the stars in a secluded balcony at the reception, he remembered something Natasha said to him a year ago when they got back into the Compound after two years in Wakanda.

. His mother would’ve repeatedly hit him with a wooden spatula, if she were still alive, for being a randy moron. His wince became more pronounced at the thought. Sarah Rogers had a mean swing. The brunet must have noticed because he made a humming noise at the back of his throat to get Steve’s attention.
He only had to chuckle at the man’s antics before going upstairs to get the food.

Those eyes were perfect simulacra of the serrated icicles that form on the surface of Lake Baikal during the harsh winters of Siberia.
“Good morning, sweetheart.” He replied, cupping the man’s cheek as he moved closer for a kiss.

Steve’s smile turned into a smirk as his lover moved slowly away from the bed to the bathroom door.
family.
Burning the monkey and the letter had been easier than Tony had expected. Hurt like a thousand ants nipping at a wound but burning the phone was different. It was Tony’s last direct connection to Steve, knowing that he was in Wakanda notwithstanding.
It didn’t hurt. Not the cuts, they might have if he wasn’t numbed by even greater pain. Instead, he was somewhat fascinated by the red blooming on the paper. So much that he carelessly dropped to the floor by his desk, not even the much sharper fragments of glass cutting through his slacks could draw him out of his…trance.
Needless to say, those were some of the most
Every wrinkle, every miniscule rip on its edges, every word blotted by salt water.
He never really understood the appeal of watching one’s partner primping for far too long when you had to be somewhere urgent until three months into their relationship. Steve had arrived from a mission with Sam and Clint, Nat being tapped by Colonel Rhodes for undercover in Yemen, when he found Tony in their room dressed to the nines and staring intently into the mirror, checking his reflection for any flaws.
as much as with being polite.
Bucky was already there, dashing in his suit yet looking like he wanted to bolt at any given moment. It only changed when he saw Sam and Steve approaching.
“You know, even if I did everything I could to be a giant headache, she was actually very nice. I preferred Ana better, she and Jarvis had been with the family even before I was born. The woman practically raised me. The nanny was hired to replace Ana so I did what every kid would do—scare and annoy the nanny into quitting the job.” Tony said, leaning on Steve’s chest as they cuddled on the ratty couch in the lab. Miracle of all miracles, Steve managed to distract Tony from his work and take a break after they finished their breakfast.
Steve’s head whipped around to find Sam looking at him expectantly. Shit, he’d been staring at the paper for quite some time and the song was already replaced with something else.
He pulled out the fireproof trash bin under the desk and took the monkey sketch. Opening the lighter, he watched as the small flame had devoured one corner of the paper before dropping it into the bin. Taking the letter next, he stared at it for one last time—committing all the changes that he had unwittingly placed into it earlier to memory.
“I know, Buck. I’m not saying it’s going to be easy but the only thing I want for both of you is to be happy. This is you two on the happiest day of your lives, and I want to see that myself.”
Goddamn if Steve Rogers had no compunction to hit where it would hurt the most.
“I’m serious, Tony. I just want you to eat and take a break, I mean, when was the last time you ate?” he replied, deciding on a different tactic because screw it, Tony was right.
With everything he had, he believed every word.
Howard’s mandible from the rest of his face, out of consideration to Tony and what respect he had left for Howard’s efforts in helping him and the Howling Commandos during the war.
“What?”
“Why, Mr. Stark,” Steve mock gasped, in that gee-golly-wow manner Tony did if he was trying to impersonate Steve. Which nearly made Steve lose all of his faith in Tony’s acting skills for how awful he was at it, “if I didn’t know any better I’ll say you’re trying to make sure I don’t see you waltzing around the ballroom with a pretty, young thing hanging off your arm.”
. It was hilarious, amazing and scary how she always found a way to outsmart my pranks without getting me in trouble with my dad. I was totally convinced she was a secret agent of some sort. But long story short, in the end, she stayed so did Ana because my mom figured she needed all the help she could get.”
He could still remember the resolve that emanated from Steve when he told them that they would all win and lose fighting alongside each other.
The brunet turned and leaned against the table near the full-length mirror, “Hey, babe. Welcome back.” he crossed the distance between them to give Steve a kiss, which the blond returned.
“Did she leave though? I’m assuming she did, since a stubborn Tony Stark is quite the formidable opponent.” He teased, pressing a kiss on the crown of the genius’ head.
“Yep. Scarily amazing lady that one. Even Jarvis wasn’t able to make me eat my veggies, y’know?”
He needed time to be alone right now and it didn’t help that seeing his best friend—who was the strongest man he knew, always tall, strong and proud—grit his teeth in pain if he so much as try push himself off the mat reopened all badly,
What were all those promises for then? Pillow talk?
Another promise to break.
Slowly gathering himself off the floor, Tony dusted himself and shook any pieces of glass off. He also picked up the monkey sketch and sat at the desk.
do. Now Captain, if you don’t…you could just wait for me while I finish my shower.”, the genius laughed as he walked backwards to the shower, his lower lip caught between his teeth.
“Three hours. I’ll be back in three hours.” He said with a promising smile.
“Can I just say how much I love it that you’re talking to me like my nanny used to when I was a kid?”
Apparently, Tony had been deluding himself in thinking they could be each other’s family.
had somehow left in his chest by reading it repeatedly.
Steve shook himself out of the memory and pulled out his little notebook that contained his lists, he had a few minutes before his best man speech. He only got out of the party with the excuse of going to the bathroom. He should’ve done this way back but he couldn’t find the words to write. Now, as he composed his speech, he could hear the song from earlier in his head and he found himself writing down another list that he knew he couldn’t share with anyone.
No wonder he left Tony behind and took the others with him then.
Everyone expected the son to be the same as the father.
He shook his head,“ No, I’ll deal with the cuts later, they’re almost healed anyway. But…Can you…can you deactivate the smoke alarm in here for a moment?”
“Do you want me to? I could—“
Steve said his faith lied with those that never let him down, the divergence of his actions and his words were hitting Tony heavier than the punches he had given back in Siberia. Tony wasn’t part of the individuals that had even a speckle of that faith, which was why he chose not to tell Tony about what they knew of Zemo’s plan.
“You’re adorable.”
Sure, just thinking about Steve was akin to a rusting knife flaying his heart…but that was because he loved him, more than he had loved anyone, even Pepper.  Deciding not to go through with it, he tossed the phone back into the drawer.   He grabbed some bond paper he wasn’t even sure why he had in his office, and swept the bits of glass and wiped the drops of blood on the floor. After tossing it all in the bin, along with the broken frame, he stood up just in time for FRIDAY to alert him to a message on his phone.
Tony would never mistake that piece of paper for anything else. He had held everything in when he had first received it and the burner phone St—
After his own anger cooled down, Steve went in search of his partner in the Compound, but he couldn’t find him, even the lab showed no signs of the man. Then it turned out, Tony had taken one of the suits and flew back to the Tower.
He had found out in the early stages of their relationship that Tony would no doubt occupy as much space as he could in the bed unless he was wrapped around someone like an octopus that slept like a log. Steve chuckled at the thought and he pressed his lips on his lover’s forehead. As he moved away, his eyes roamed over the tranquility casted on the engineer’s face. Moments like these were what made Steve feel so damn lucky he lived long enough to meet Tony Stark. The man showed him that there was still some things life had in store for him. That the bleakness he felt after he lost everything to the war and time was not the end. He could still live and be Steve Rogers, both for himself and the life he left behind as well as the life he now had.
Now, though, he had thrown that compunction to be polite in this regard out of the window because he had a newly discovered appreciation for being fashionably late. As of the moment, he was sitting on one of the plush and absurdly high backed chairs Tony favored tying his shoelaces, at the same time watching the love of his life turn this way and that whilst combing that nest of dark hair into submission with calloused fingers.
Maybe it was just his imagination.
part?
“I love you, Tony.” He murmured into his ear even if he knew Tony wouldn’t actually hear him and contented himself with stopping Tony’s quivering with his serum-enhanced body temperature.
sense.  He would have sworn the walls at the clinic were closing in on him and it was making it hard for Tony to breathe.
The engineer turned his attention back to his reflection, eyes roaming on his own form and ignoring Steve as though he hadn’t just launched a great assault on the blond’s libido. Steve huffed and sat on their bed, watching his lover and willing his dick to calm down or else, the image Tony painted mere seconds ago would happen. Steve winced, annoyed with himself when he remembered that the event was meant for the benefit of
Steve felt heat across his cheeks, he was without a doubt, flushed, “I’m not. I was just telling you that I made breakfast for you upstairs.”
For now, he needed to get back in the lab and figure out how to make sure a vibranium prosthesis would work seamlessly with neural implants.
“Yes, Boss.”
“I slept for almost seventy years, kid. Don’t need any more naps.” He answered, wrapping an arm around the billionaire and taking Tony’s hand in his before pressing kisses on the tips of the brunet’s fingers.
Always
Steve closed his eyes and sighed in exasperation as Tony glared at one of JARVIS’ cameras muttering, “Traitor.”
“Jackass.” Sam smirked and patted the brunet’s arm.
Not love, not baby, most certainly not
They spent the entire weekend in the Tower, lying in bed—talking, making up, making love and not caring about whatever lied outside their little bubble.
“Do you need a good nap right now, gramps?” Tony teased then sat on the soldier’s lap, looking like sin in that tailored silvery, gray suit that hugged him perfectly.
“Can’t wait and I don’t particularly care.” He replied and tried to kiss Tony again, tried being the operative word because the man deftly slipped away from his grasp—for a man who lived as a civilian his whole life, Tony was quite the fast little thing—and out of the bed.
“Don’t replace the locks? You did that the moment you hid the truth from me, Steven. You did that the moment you decided to push me away. You did that when you left me to die.”  He spat, wiping his tears away with the sleeve of his shirt. He may have smeared some blood on his face, or whatever, but fuck it. “If you had truly loved me, you should know that I would have understood if you’ve been brave enough to tell me. What I don’t understand is why you’ve never thought of that, goddamn you.”
So, no.
sent because of how overwhelmed he was with everything that happened and was happening. Now, just this once, he wanted to let go.
It was an almost out of body experience for Tony, watching himself pick up the letter with trembling hands. His fingers adding something new to remember the letter by in the form of blood staining it from the tiny shards of glass that dug into his palm as his hand closed around the paper.
three hours of Steve’s life and he made sure that Tony soothed him well when he arrived back in the Tower.
Tony was looking at Steve through their reflection in the mirror whilst he was tying the vibrant, red silk necktie Steve bought him for his birthday around his neck. Steve couldn’t decide if he wanted to whack Tony upside the head or kiss him senseless for it. The necktie had meant something else for them ever since they had used it during one of their more adventurous tête-à-têtes in the bedroom. Images of how it contrasted against Tony’s gloriously tanned skin flooded him. Of course, with the way those doe-eyes sharpened and glimmered—Tony could tell.
"So, what do you feel like having? I can get anything, usually I make JARVIS pick. Oh, uh, that's my main AI, I built him when I was fourteen."
"I'll add some fancier cooking skills to my new chip," said Steve. "I, uh, have more than one slot..."
Steve felt that smile down to his toes, but he had another bite anyway, tasting the food before he answered. "I guess it won't, at that."
"Should you really call them that?" He kept being distracted by every charmingly strange new thing that Tony did. "Wait, uh, wheel thing is fine."
"Tony, that's too much," said Steve, turning to really look at him. Now that he'd disheveled himself, he looked much more like the man who'd come for data and stayed for pleasure. Steve wanted to muss him even more, to show him how to truly unwind and live in his body, in the moment.
"Oh, fuck, you're hot," said the man, stopping in the doorway. "Uh, sorry. Is the full package still on the table?"
"You can afford a personal companion," said Steve, sounding dubious now.
They waved for him to sit, and he indulged in another cup of coffee on their bill while they finished up. Elna looked pleased when they came by to freshen everyone's drinks, and Steve was very glad he'd given them a good tip. SI corp truckers wouldn't even covet his token, so that was one less worry.
He made himself leave, get in the car, and peel out into the heavy flow of traffic, putting it in stealth mode and letting FRIDAY, his personal driver, take them to SI the fast way. Sometimes Tony liked the thrill of driving himself, flying himself, doing things the old-fashioned way like soldering and coding and piloting, but right now he wanted to replay the last hour of his life while his mouth still tasted like sex and kisses and Steve.
"You like him, J!" said Tony, smiling. "Good thing he does, my whole penthouse is his to rule, and us merely his subjects."
(male/hardline)
Steve looked properly gratified at the offer, and made the chip vanish into the hidden compartment that Tony had clocked onto with his enhancements the moment he walked in. "Well, if I didn't have somewhere else in mind, I'd offer to just follow you home for that."
Tony paused to brush a kiss over that lush mouth. "Paying it forward. Plus, I wasn't lying. SI always needs good people, and I've got a good feeling about you."
"As always, sir," snarked JARVIS, closing the holos and dimming the room lights to improve the view outside.
His bag had been discreetly shuffled away, likely to be thoroughly checked for contraband before being delivered to, well, wherever. He'd half expected to be shuffled off the same way, but instead, here he was on the way to Stark's personal quarters, a whole penthouse apartment full of whatever it was rich CEOs needed all that space for.
"Absolutely," said Tony. He brought up a comm line and said, "Pepper, I'm taking him up to my suite for dinner and afters, can you send up a companion contract? We'll adjust the boilerplate, so just fill in some starter numbers. Yep, I was almost done reviewing the proposals when you brought me my treat, and I'll get the last few before we go." To Steve he added, "Get a snack from the bar over there, and bring me a coffee? I've got three more proposals to quick-read and either kill or shoot up the line."
Tony shed his suit coat and tie, coming up beside Steve to roll up his sleeves. "I like to remind myself that nature's as worth preserving as people. Plus, Pepper made me do it."
Tony ushered Steve not to the door but a section of wall that slid aside to reveal a private elevator, "Now, come into my parlor."
He wasn't sure which way he preferred to sell his body, if he was honest. Selling sex to truckers wasn't as bad as he'd feared, when they were all just looking for a quick fuck-and-connect, to jack into his body and then into the secure hard line he paid a premium for. He liked sex well enough, and he'd gotten good at it, enough to make it enjoyable for everyone when he wanted that, or quick when he wasn't in the mood.
"So," he said, pulling up a holo menu a mile long, and some kind of spinning raffle wheel. "Pick a restaurant, or use the Wheel of Food?"
"Of course, Steve." JARVIS sounded warm but Steve couldn't guess why, without a face. Pleased, amused, affectionate? Who could tell with AIs.
Tony pulled into a strip mall/rest stop far enough from Roxxon that the lines wouldn't be their taps, at least, and might not be tapped at all. He scanned the contact strip for a likely port and came across a listing that made him laugh:
"The what?" asked Steve, startled into a bark of laughter.
"Sounds like we have ourselves a deal," said Steve, offering his hand to the one that had done most of the talking.
The bed wasn't neat, because it was also the only place to sit, but it worked for truckers, and, apparently, Tony, who plopped right down and pulled out the sleekest rig Steve had ever seen. "I won't be long, get me a green shot, too?"
Steve shrugged. "I'm good either way. I've got a very talented tongue and I can use it on most any of the mods I've seen, except the one guy with the spikes, and we found a way to work around it." He winked salaciously.
They glanced at it, shot him a look of surprised gratitude, then nodded. "Of course, pumpkin. You all squared up with the boss?"
"I can order up," said Steve. "Perk of the room." The cube-rooms were rated for business and residential, and they weren't all or even mostly selling sex like Steve -- there were hackers and crackers, mechanics and off-license wetworkers, and even a couple of fortune tellers, though one of those also sold sex with your future.
Tony chuckled. "First AI I ever built, and he refuses to upgrade his chassis. DUM-E, this is Steve. He's maybe gonna live up here with me."
"If you say so," said Steve. "You didn't even get all the way naked."
"Oh, yeah. That's an SI specialty, not even that pricey. J, you two can have fun shopping for it, set him up with materials, a studio, plus toiletries, toys, clothing, the whole nine yards. I want everyone who sees him to know my companion's properly spoiled."
Fortunately, this jack had high-speed options, real ones, and JARVIS could sheath it all in ice so black no one would even know there was data traveling into SI's mainframes.
Steve shook his head. "It all looks great," he said absently, looking at the crags outside, an artificial cliffside that had plants and even wildlife clinging to life up with the humans.
"It's, uh, Steve. Um, please," he stammered, hating the way his name sounded like someone else's in the AI's upscale accent.
"Yeah, we do," they said. "I'm Liam, my partner's Jinx. That's Mel and Sal there. We mostly got standard parts, if that matters."
Tony waved him off. "Who has time? Hiring a companion is easier, and you know, if you renew enough times it'll be a long-term relationship whether or not I'm paying you."
"Yeah, sounds good. You really aren't too worried about me disappointing you without a trial period?" Steve waved his hand at the contract, which JARVIS popped up was for 6 months, renewable by both parties, no further trial required.
Tony jacked out when Steve was down to his last two slices of bacon, and made big brown puppy eyes at Steve. "Can I have one of those? Get the taste of chlorophyll out of my mouth."
"Spin him up enough calories for all his enhancements, J. You've got this."
"You could've told me," said Steve wryly, shaking his head at Tony. Pepper had escorted him up personally, giving Tony a wink and darkening his office windows before showing herself out again. Steve watched her with a dubious expression.
Tony stood, finished re-dressing, and got into the hidden pocket of his jacket for one of his personal tokens. "This'll get you all the way to my office. We'll work things out from there."
"I'm definitely gonna live up here," said Steve, unable to even play coy while watching Tony look at his quirky robot with exasperated fondness. "We'll learn to spoil him together."
His glasses informed him he'd tipped the guy 11k, which was honestly irrelevant. He'd make billions off the data he'd just sent off, if he could get home intact to do something with it. 16K for a quick jack-and-suck was nothing.
"Better is always an improvement," said Tony. Something he'd only tried to use on his father once, but had made a motto once the old bastard and his asshole attitude was gone. "Fuck, gotta run. You might, uh, wanna get outta here sooner than later, if I'm tracked." Tony fingered the extra creds in his pocket, then tossed two more onto the bed. "Consider this a tip."
"That's fine," said Steve. "How about on round each for safe passage from here to the SI gates."
Steve gave a little pose. "Whatever. I'm in the sex trade, if that's what you're after."
"There's a few claves that always need workers," said Tony, reading off some data on his glasses that JARVIS had helpfully provided, and sending back a couple of silent queries about open spots in his own clave. "Sorry, you probably didn't need any of that."
Steve had learned to put freedom above all of it.
"Yep," said Tony. He stood up, trusting JARVIS to lock up his data while he got himself squared away and tugged Steve up for a kiss. "If we don't get along, I'll just put you in the companion's suite and waive exclusivity. It'll be a fun scandal, and you'll still get paid."
"That...would actually be so much help," said Steve, sagging with hopeful puppy eyes to rival Tony's. "I didn't think it was that good of a suck job, though, so why?"
Steve started to deepen the kiss, but sighed when his stomach rumbled. "I don't suppose we could negotiate over dinner?" he said sheepishly.
Steve stood naked for a few long moments, letting the last hour settle in his mind, from the money to the sex to the offer he'd been given. The token looked genuine, and it alone would save him thousands, maybe tens of thousands of credits. The chips that the john had tossed so carelessly as a tip were even more, enough between it all to ensure a real start, even if things didn't work out with Tony.
"I have become rather more than I was back then, sir," JARVIS said silently, and then added out loud. "It is good to meet you, Mr. Rogers."
Tony gestured and the wheel spun just as if he'd grabbed a real, old-fashioned carnival prop and given it a spin. "The minions union voted for it, so, yes."
"I do, yeah," said Steve, sitting at the place Tony had set for him. "Every single duty is listed as optional except for accompanying you to a certain number of events a month? Seriously?"
"And for you?" asked Tony, producing actual credit chits like he belonged in this shitty little strip mall. "How about 5K for the package?"
Steve laughed. "I'm sure she appreciates it." Elna led him over to a group of four truckers wearing SI jackets and hats. "Our Steve here is looking for a ride to SI. Any of you got space?"
Steve knew that hiding out in a truck stop strip mall in between claves wasn't going to work out forever, but he only had to dodge the HYDRA bounty on his head while he put together enough cred for an entree into SI clave. With a body jacked by the late Stark himself and full of Erskine regen serum, he'd have something to offer them, even if he had to go back to fighting again.
"Oh?" Tony sounded genuinely interested, but he also shed his jacket and started on his tie.
"If that were true, sir, you would certainly eat less from the replicator," said JARVIS. Snark, at least, Steve could recognize anywhere.
"I like the not-chip parts of you, too," said Tony automatically. He shrugged. "Let's order up tonight, you can impress me with your kitchen skills later. Get a lacy apron with a bow right over your ass."
Tony slipped the work back into its own lane and closed those processes off from conscious thought, smiling to see Steve bent over his own datapad. JARVIS informed him that this one had been assigned to Steve permanently, and that Steve's phone, ident, and other amenities were already waiting in Stark's suite.
They all nodded. "We're doubles, yeah. Okay, that suits us. We'll have at least one more stop before SI, so we can switch off."
Tony shrugged as a warning started to flash in one corner of his glasses. "Ran out of time." He let himself take one more kiss, long and slow and good. "Maybe you'll let me have another round when you get to SI."
"I'd already decided on SI, if they'll have me. I met Stark once, years ago. Seems like a good enough omen, them being first on your list." Steve stood up and gave a little shimmy of his hips as he slid his jeans down to reveal his naked everything. And damn, they hadn't spared the chisel on his thighs, either, not to mention the very nice equipment between them.
Tony came out of his fugue to the smell of greasy diner breakfast, overlaid with the bright chlorophyll green of midrange nutrient shots. He put on his best pleading face, the one that never worked on Pepper but usually did on Happy, and asked, "Can I have one of those? Get the taste of chlorophyll out of my mouth."
"Not gonna make me cook?" teased Steve, looking at Tony through his lashes. "It's part of the chip, so I know some basic stuff."
He was surprised to realize he hadn't activated his chip, and the impulse was his own.
"They have. I came in with some SI trucks, even your drivers are nicer than some. I wasn't worried about having my tips stolen with them." Steve was grinning, and he leaned back against the desk, spreading his jeans-clad legs invitingly and then tugging Tony into the space between them. "I guess you don't do your own recruiting very often?"
"Man, I bet a pet would love this view," said Steve, feeling a bit like a dog himself as he spotted some small mammal and his brain shouted SQUIRREL! "I always wanted one, but that's like wanting to fly, except these days it's easier to get wings."
"Nah, there's a whole ecosystem in the curve of the tower. Not much that's very big, you know how rare that stuff is, but Pepper's been working on a few purchases in between my, by which I mean her, art collection." Tony's mouth ran like a water shower, a steady flow of information that was easy to turn on and bask in and forget everything else.
"Can do," said Steve, though he was mostly talking to himself by the end of it. Tony had jacked in like a pro, and Steve shook himself away from staring to order up their drinks. He got himself an extra plate of hash browns and bacon to go with his green shot; Tony looked like he'd either be a while at the jack, or a while in bed, and either way, Steve could use the extra nutrients.
