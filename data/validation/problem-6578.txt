Wade finally responded by trembling and then returning the embrace with a tight hug. He gasped, “I…I’ll try.”
His old office was exactly as how he remembered it, bright light coming in from the floor-to-ceiling windows, minimalist design with a lone desk sitting in the center of the large expanse, and still clean and pristine despite his months of absence. He had the nightly cleaning crew to thank for that, but it still unnerved him. His workshop had, had a layer of dust when he had returned from his captivity with the Ten Rings, attesting to his absence. This…This just made it feel like he had never been needed here. It was ridiculously symbolic to his position in the company and the symbolism seemed to keep mounting as Pepper fluidly slipped into the chair behind the desk and went onto the computer.
She paused by him and said, “Next time I see you Tony will be back and the Mandarin in custody. Till then, Rogers,” she said with a nod, her way of saying goodbye.
More years passed and Tony stopped growing up and started to age. Steve first noticed it in his soulmate’s laugh lines as they stayed even after he smiled. Then he noted the frown lines between Tony’s brows were becoming more pronounced.
Tony looked at the jar of lotion in his hands and his heart palpitated again, this time more painfully. He tightened his hold on the glass container as that pain surged through his entire body.
Before going out, Bucky trimmed Steve’s hair and then he and Steve went down to the private beach and sat down together in the sand for a long time. Tony watched them from the balcony and curiously wondered if Bucky was finally telling Steve about his time as the Winter Soldier. He could've had Jarvis listen in but he gave the men privacy and went back inside and started looking up all the dating possibilities in the area. He was so immersed in his work that he didn't realize the two had returned until Steve came up behind him and pressed a kiss onto his cheek.
Tony closed all the personnel files around him and focused solely on the ones in front of him on the storage records of the Winter Soldier.
The metal shudders clanked shut, cutting them off from the outside world. It was loud enough to wake Peter and he whined when he saw Steve was not with him in the bed.
Steve had nowhere to go so he stayed with Solo. Solo showed him the ropes of living on the streets in modern day New York. There were places who offered food, shelters to sleep, and places to congregate with other homeless.
After a beat of silence, Tony said, “For once I’m extremely grateful for our celebrity. No normal couple would’ve been allowed to foster a kid, no question…”
Feeling invigorated by Steve’s smile, Tony stepped out on stage and to the cheer and applause of their audience. He let them let out their excitement and waved and blew kisses. It took them a few minutes to settle down and once the screams quietened down to a manageable level, Tony announced, “Thank you for joining me in another successful year of the Stark Bi-Annual Employee Fair.”
It took him nearly a week to watch it a second time. When he first watched it, he became angry. He thought Stark was trying to trick him into thinking he really didn't know about the recording so he didn't even watch the full video. Curiosity finally got the better of him in the end.
As soon as the jet leveled off, Tony stepped into his personal space and Steve scrambled back. With a hard expression, Tony moved with him until Steve hit the wall of the plane and he could go no further.
Bruce turned back to the holo where Brock was watching them with a worried expression. He unmuted it and then asked the younger man, “Would electrocution work?”
Steve returned the hug, pressing his face into the side of Tony’s neck and whispered, “And we’re together.”
His mind raced, now free from the cloudy adrenaline boost of the goblin serum. He put the pieces together. The brat’s parents were still in space. The Captain’s face…from the few seconds he focused on it, he remembered it was free of aging. He hadn’t noticed it during the heat of battle but...These were the Spider’s parents but…but the younger versions of them.
Bucky rolled his eyes and said, “If this was really Part Four then it failed. There was nothing sexy or romantic about it.”
“It will be turned off soon,” Steve promised. He lifted his hand to lightly touch the communicator in his ear and whispered, “Amplify the noise as soon as we’re in the cage.”
“May…I’m fine. You – you should sit down,” Wade murmured, leading her to the nearest sofa. Pictures were splattered all over the living room and Wade kept his head downcast to avoid all the angles of Peter’s once smiling face.
“It’s the best,” Peter replied and she handed him the water. Peter accepted it with a grateful smile and took a few much-needed chugs.
Whenever Steve and the rest of the team were called out, Peter either stayed with the Parkers or, if they were unable, at the daycare in the new SHIELD HQ. At the daycare, Steve was pleased to find out Peter made some friends his own age. Two he had grown especially close to, Luke Cage and Ava Ayala, came over often. Luke was the son of SHIELD scientists and Ava was the child of the superhero, the White Tiger.
“Mr. Stark, you need to stay here! We have to discuss this. Your level of incompetence nearly cost us a teammate!” Steve yelled, angered by Tony’s uncaring reaction to almost killing Clint and trying to leave the scene like it was nothing.
“Pancakes first,” Bucky stated, flopping one more pancake onto the stack and then picked up the plate. “Let’s eat.”
Tony smiled at his and nuzzled back into Steve’s hold. He closed his eyes and whispered, “See you in my dreams?”
But Wade was flirty and naked, so very naked, and Peter couldn’t resist making love with him one more time. And one more time after that…and well…Peter was only human and
Tony stepped out of Steve's hold and looked at his husband with a pinched gaze. He asked, “Really, Steve, what is with the sudden interest in the shield?”
Howard paused before they got any closer to the Command tent and turned to Steve with a grin. He sarcastically said, “It certainly is a little crazy to meet your son who has ten plus years on me and a cybernetic implant in his chest…but, I’m glad you guys told me in the end.
They opened the drain and dried each other off with fluffy towels. Tony ran a towel over Steve’s hair and scoffed, “How did I miss all this hair up here too?? You need a trim, soldier.”
“Sir’s communication module was destroyed when they encountered a man at the end of their hall. I lost contact with him when he attacked,” Jarvis relayed over the comms.
When Steve came back, Tony almost told him everything. He probably would have if Steve had not silenced Tony’s inane mumbling with a heated kiss. After that, everything fell back into place and Tony pretended the August 20
It was light and sweet at first. Steve tightened his hold on Tony’s hips and pressed himself into Tony’s chest. The older man wrapped his arms around Steve’s head and did the same with his legs around his waist. Their kiss deepened and Tony keened needingly into his mouth.
want to be with me,” Bucky hissed and Steve tensed. When Steve said nothing to counter his observation Bucky whispered, “You care for me too, don’t you?”
In that moment, he knew exactly who Wade was talking about. Peter flushed to himself as he wondered how deep Wade’s affections went. Glancing at him from the corner of his eyes, he asked, “Do you think it will happen?”
Norman was a well-known figure in the science community around the world so he put forth the names of the most intelligent women he knew. Mary Parker, had not only been intelligent, but was an undercover SHIELD agent in his company. Presenting her name had been a win-win situation for Norman.
Nothing more needed to be said. The privacy of their secret names was as grand as a declaration of love.
This was what couples did. They flirted, they went on dates, they gazed at stars, they cuddled, and they held hands. This was finally happening to Steve…
Their exchange was like a magic spell washing over him. He relaxed into Tony's hold and felt all his worries wash away.
“You have to eat, Steve,” Ben stated disapprovingly. In the months since Ben met him, he had become well acquainted with his and Peter’s fast metabolisms.
“No, Steve,” Tony replied. He stepped closer and implored, “We hoped that you would come willingly or…Or I am prepared to subdue Venom.”
Tony groaned, “We are never touching that crap again! Besides…” Tony reached between them, pressing their members together with a tight grip. Steve hissed with the contact as Tony murmured, “I’m too close to wait.”
This elicited another screaming cheer from his audience and Tony waited for them to quiet down with a smile.
It was late by the time they got back to the apartment. The Soldier instantly dismantled his gun and started to clean it. Natasha left him with her rifle and went into the kitchen to make them some food. As she did, she started guessing names again.
“Tell the Captain, the Red Skull was just here!” The leader of the American force hissed to a subordinate. The soldier ran out of the room but Tony ignored it all to interrogate the agent in front of him.
Breaking in was easy enough. One hit with the edge of shield was enough to knock the lock and doorknob clear off the door. The door swung open and Steve sighed deeply with relief and dropped his shoulders.
And what was going to happen to him? He’d woken up in a test tube. Was this robot going to bring him back?
After their food was gone, they remained seated and wound their arms around each other and relaxing into one another until Jarvis announced the VA rep’s arrival.
Bucky pushed Tony off him and picked Steve up by the scruff of his uniform and pointed a gun at him.
Tony suddenly spun back around and his eyes fell on Steve and they were full of gratuity. He did not know how well he knew Mary but next thing he knew Tony had his arms around both of them. Steve tensed then relaxed into his hold.
“Captain Rogers will likely keep your confidence and he did not learn of his fate. All-in-all, it went as well as it could be expected, you even look somewhat clean-cut now,” Jarvis added the quip with a nod.
Bucky and Natasha visibly relaxed but Steve heart dropped and his thoughts immediately went to their lost son. He got to his feet and gasped, “What happened?”
But Steve reached between them and carded his fingers with Tony’s and whispered, “I’d love to go on a date with you, Tony…”
He trusted his friends, especially the ones Pepper had picked. They were close with Peter and good people…but what if there was another Mac among them? What if someone takes their photo and posts it online? What if they do so by mistake? How long would they be able to keep it a secret? How many people was he going to have to lie to? How long can he and Wade be happy without their relationship being dissected by total strangers?
They took the stairs to the lobby. Tony was huffing slightly by the top step but Steve was unaffected as always. Steve caught his eye and smiled knowingly at Tony as if he had read his mind at that moment.
She clutched the metal object in her lab coat’s pocket and questioned whether or not she should give it to the boy. Dr. Banner had spoken with Peter when he first woke up and told him everything that had occurred, including Mary’s origin and her presently helping them. She had no idea how he would react to seeing her or how he would react to the object she had kept, hidden away.
Peter nodded to him and stated, “Five more and they all have different fighting styles. Dad, stay away from Electro. Wade can deal with him. You’re going to have to handle the Vulture as you’re the only one who can fly like him. I’ll take care of Doc Oct and Pops can have Sandman. And, yes, their name’s are going to be a dead giveaway to their appearances.”
But, when they cuddled again, just before Tony woke, Steve looked at his fingertips again as he noted the numb feeling and darkly wondered what it could mean
Relieved, Steve exhaled lightly, he had been expecting a grand, ridiculous plan that would have embarrassed Steve. He whispered, “That sounds nice.”
?” Peter gasped. Captain America was gay?! Oh sweet land of Liberty, that kind of news would catch the world by storm!
Steve continued to trail kisses against Tony’s neck and jaw. He lingered over the spot that he knew made Tony the most weak-kneed, He murmured against his flesh, “Today is about us.”
Bruce blinked several times, his eyes widening with every batted eyelid, and gasped, “You’re really here.”
“Tony?!” Steve hissed. He turned around and saw both Bruce and Thor standing tensely in front of the television, on the screen a bulbous cloud of flames was rising from the house. Bruce had his phone out and was dialing a number, Coulson or someone in SHIELD probably.
Plus, since in the last chapter Peter endeavored to no longer refer to Tony as "Uncle Tony" but "Dad" he will be doing this in this chapter! So "Dad" = Tony and "Pops" = Steve.
Steve’s eyes heated and, with his voice hitching, he whispered, “We may have had a chance once…but that all changed when I went down in my plane in 1945. That was nearly forty – years ago, Tony. Look at me. I’m still 27. I have been for decades. I am dead and, no matter how much we care about each other, that will never change.”
. I can’t imagine this world without him. I would physically be alive but I wouldn’t be able to live on...”
“We know it’s sensitive to heat,” Bruce retorted from across the room. He was sitting at his computer and did not look up from the screen. Bruce had yet to take a break and seemed to be moving faster as more reports of Venom came in. Bruce’s hair was disheveled from constantly pulling at it. It was a habit of his he developed when he came across something he did not understand.
It was fascinating to learn the little guy’s speech and watch his progression. Steve could discern “MINE” really quickly and laughed whenever his mate ever snatched back one of the dream toys that appeared when needed.
“A group of villains that really don’t like me in particular,” Peter replied. He waved them on and said, “Let’s go to the locker room and get ready for them.”
Natasha stepped next to Ben and murmured, “It is going to happen but you can bet the rest of us are going to fight like hell to keep him and every one of us safe.”
He did not hear the rest of her sentence as his ears were ringing from a sudden impact to his head. He fell to his knee and people started laughing behind him.
“I have not seen a bed since you fucking disappeared into a WWII Hydra fucking time machine, Stark,” Fury growled. “I am done with this shit. I know you are a resource, but I didn’t use you in Colorado because you were not there. If you want to be of use, stay in the fucking area and I will call you with his next sighting.”
“We both beat the odds,” Steve murmured happily, smiling as he gazed at his soulmate and son. Bucky was also watching his family and they were content to keep doing so as their sad memories made this moment all the better. Steve finally whispered, “When Peter yelled the safe word, Tony and I were in the middle of talking about adopting another kid.”
Tony felt a lot of different emotions about his father. He loved him, hated him, idolized him, and reviled him. But he was his father…and he was
Jarvis directed him to a broom and Steve was able to sweep up most of the glass by the time Tony woke.
Tony lifted his head with a pout and turned to Pepper. He groaned, “What are you doing here?? I had Jarvis lock this place down!”
Tony tiptoed over to him and paused at the foot of the lounge chair. A sudden realization presented itself to him. Yesterday, they had been fully clothed but now nearly all of Steve’s skin was laid out before him with only some flimsy swim trunks for modesty. Steve’s usual golden skin was near glowing in the sun, highlighting the perfection of his muscles with a reflective, white sheen. He breathed evenly and every time his expansive chest rose, his trunks lowered slightly and that little extra skin that was revealed each time hypnotized Tony.
“Coffee, yes, it was fine…Tony, can we, um, come in?” Steve asked, just as awkwardly. Tony was standing in front of the elevator doors, blocking their access to the rest of the room for the last couple of minutes.
I am hoping to get this next chapter out by this weekend but, with my work schedule, it'll probably be out by next weekend! I'll post teasers/updates onto my
“What’s stupid?” She elaborated from her place on his bed. She was leaning back on his headboard with her legs stretched out over the mattress.
Steve snorted, sounding very unsexy, but he pressed his hips to Tony's and the teasing sparkle in Tony's eyes disappeared as it was burned away by their growing lust.
Steve grasped his shield but paused as he took in the large crack down the middle. It had been resealed but the shield had obviously been cracked in half at one point. The sight of the damaged shield did make Tony a little uneasy. He didn’t think it was possible for vibranium to break like that...what had Steve faced?
Century as Iron Man. We’ll still do what we got to do, but, in the background, we can be together. We’ll live in a secret just like you're already doing. Easy Peasy…I want to try this with you, Steve.”
They had a future together now and, from the photos he’d seen, it looked like it was going to be a happy one.
“Got a few cases like yours here. Plus combat vets, people with disabilities who had to choose between owning a home or gettin’ medication…It’s tough out here.” Solo clasped his shoulder and promised, “I’ll help you out and you can help me with the aliens.”
“Believe me, I’m trying…I think it’s a little harder because he’s still riled up by your identity reveal.” Steve asked, “By the way, have you figured out when Wade will be coming over for the big meet?”
Dad returned the hug by holding him closely and rubbing his back. He whispered, “I know, buddy. I know…”
The final battle to decide Earth’s fate was being waged in New York, his and Tony’s home. Loki seemed to be looking more for a grand stage but he also successfully managed to give them another reason to defeat him.
It took every ounce of Tony's will not to sob at the feeling and ruin the moment. It’d been so long since he last felt Steve’s touch.
He had goggles and thick gloves on but that was all he wore in protective wear. He was barefoot in jeans and a black tank. His arc reactor glowed through the fabric and his hair was a mess.
How much of his body had been left after the explosion? By the lack of a tux, he guessed there was not enough for an open casket. It seemed he was more indestructible than he ever thought possible. How much of his remains were needed for his healing factor to work?? Could he ever die? The last thought was extremely unnerving but he pushed it away to mull over for another day.
As soon as he was able, Tony blasted back to Steve’s side and, for a moment, he thought something was wrong. Steve looked shaken and was staring at Point Break’s hammer with shock, fear, and, strangely enough, recollection.
“Happy was at the theatre,” Tony stated, his voice dull and listless. Steve inhaled sharply and clutched his phone tightly. All his bravado dissipated and he wished he could take Tony into his arms. Happy Hogan was with Tony longer than Pepper. He was family to Tony.
…My boy is always meddling in something or other. He’s not the brightest bulb in the box either… Dr. Parker is a very private person and I don’t think she will want to see either of you.”
“Well, you'll have to do something impressive for her to see past...this…” Steve murmured, circling his own face.
Fury delivered the news to them personally and blamed the fact that the entire team was divided for this tragedy. Tony was loathe to admit it…but he was right. He and Steve had brought their personal baggage into this and their constant nitpicking played a huge part in keeping everyone divided and on edge.
!” Venom screeched and pounced on Peter, flattening him to the ground by wrapping its tendrils around his throat. Without any warning, it slammed his skull into the pavement.
“So we’ll end up in some gossip rags, big deal,” Steve snorted. “We won’t be arrested or publicly shamed at least.” Steve smiled warmly at Tony and pressed his forehead to Tony’s as he whispered, “I don’t care what others think but I do want a night out with my fella and celebrate both of us being engaged.”
Steve stopped breathing at the word “hospital.” Was Tony still there? Did they not find him a cure??
Cable held up the time glove, now affixed to his hand like it was made to be there and said, “I paused time for everyone but us.”
“Thank you again for the assist, Spider-Man,” Agent Coulson said. “Maybe today you will come in and fill out some paperwork and remove that mask…?”
Steve stopped laughing and smiled warmly at Tony as he remembered their kiss. He whispered, “Yes, we did.”
Flushing, Steve thanked him and followed the priest through a door leading them away from the main part of the church.
“…Nat,” Clint called to her. He had waited with Thor to see Steve’s fate but now they knew he was alive right now so they had to get back to business. “This guy isn’t a foot soldier. He’s wearing top of the line gear and his left arm is freaking robotic.
Steve nodded and the car became stationary. Everyone looked to Steve to make the first move. Steve closed his eyes, inhaled deeply, and stilled his shaking hands by gripping his thighs tightly. He snapped open his eyes and stated, “Let’s go.”
“Yes, thank you,” Steve said and the elevator doors closed and it began to move down without his asking.
Steve sat with him for a few moments, watching Tony as he fell asleep. They were in full view of strangers so he couldn’t reach out and touch him like he wanted. It was harder now knowing how easily Tony could die. The chip he put back into his body looked like it was barely held together. He could go at any moment.
“…If I have to fake a relationship with someone…I think my best friend is the best option, don’t you? No one knows me better,” Steve replied and Tony’s heart clenched a little.
Peter allowed himself to fall a few stories, before catching himself on the smooth glass with his fingertips. His heart was racing and he was short of breath from the plunge. He had never fallen that far before.
Bucky frowned but it went away as soon as Steve put a hand on his shoulder. Steve stated with confidence, “Everything will be okay. We win the War, remember?”
Wade froze, not knowing what to do. He was the kind that rushed into danger and had gone through life without a care in the world. This…this was different. He’d never cared for a person or wanted to comfort another like he did with Peter.
Peter placed his hand on the wall to, over a spider symbol and the same thing happened to him. Peter’s suit was thinner and more agile looking along with the red and blue color scheme, he had a black spider on his chest.
“Yeah, come here, buddy,” Tony murmured, displaying none of the grumpiness he had portrayed to Bucky for doing the same thing a few nights prior. Peter ran into their bedroom and jumped onto the bed. He positioned himself between them just like he used to do when he was a toddler and tucked himself under the covers.
“Stupid indeed…” Steve agreed and watched as Tony’s face finally relaxed as he gave into his exhaustions.
“Steve,” Natasha growled, turning slowly back to him with enough grace and lethal force akin to a jaguar.
“Oh, my God,” Steve hissed as Tony’s skin was revealed. He removed more bandage and more metallic-black veined skin appeared across Tony’s chest. As the horror grew, he kept hissing, “Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Tony…”
“Da…?” Tony slurred heavily and struggled to open his eyelids like they were a little too heavy. Steve pulled back his hand and put the cloth back in the dish beside the bed. It seemed to take a moment for Tony’s eyes to focus on him and another moment for him to recognize Steve.
,” Wade whispered, his voice filled with more emotion than he’d ever heard from the man before. “I-I…” He sighed heavily and whispered, “Pete, I like you. I really do and…I’m willing to do whatever I can to keep us together.”
The supermarket was small and, with all of the souvenirs, it seemed to cater to tourists more than locals.
Bucky nodded to the supposed commands he was clearly eager to work with. He wobblily stepped out of the chamber and then fell forward. Tony went to catch him but, Jarvis must have taken the movement as a threat, and all the suits surged forward and pulled Tony away from Bucky.
Peter stared at his adopted father with a horrified expression and was instantly frozen by shock. His surprise only last for a few seconds then he was swiftly spurred on by his worry. Peter scrambled off the bed and ran to his dad’s side. He remembered to grab his IV’s pole so his own needle wasn’t ripped out of his arm.
Peter snuggled closer into Tony’s chest and his boyfriend looked excitedly at Steve. He whispered animatedly, “Did you see that??”
“You’re not crazy,” Peter countered. “Eccentric, yes, but not crazy.” Peter gently grasped Wade’s arm to make him stop touching his head and then pulled down his hand until he was able to card his fingers into Wade’s. He continued, “If you’re crazy, then I’m crazy because I love you.” He pulled Wade into an embrace and repeated with more conviction, “I love you…”
“Shall we celebrate?” Tony icily replied, “I can crack open another bottle of champagne again, you can try to kiss me again, you can pretend it meant nothing again, and then…you can push me away again. And you can pretend it never happened
Fury stated, “What else was SHIELD to assume when you kept hacking into our systems, kept the world’s only perfected super soldier a secret, and had wanted more information on Project Rebirth. Were you going to create more, Stark?”
He and Jarvis exchanged nods and Howard silently opened the door to the bedroom. Maria was awake and still reading the newspaper he’d left her with. Tony was deeply asleep and curled into her side with one arm thrown over her thigh.
Everyone was able to fit into the elevator and the conversation about SHIELDS’ new agents assigned to the Avengers’ missions continued. Peter and Wade stood in the back corner and he privately murmured to Wade, “I think it went well.”
Peter dropped his hands with a sigh and turned to his stepfather. He asked, “How’d you know I was here?”
Steve nodded in agreement. Tony always came back. He had to believe in his husband…and he had to be there for their son. Peter needed him now, more than ever.
“No, this is very real,” Bruce gritted. Stats and readings were streaming in and both Bruce and Scott were pouring over them while anxiously glancing up to Venom.
“That sounds perfect too,” Steve whispered and Tony grinned. He added, “But no AC/DC on my wedding day.”
“It’s just a feeling, I can’t help it, but I can…I can suppress it and it’ll go away,” Steve promised.
Tony had to stop as he gasped shallowly. He pictured Peter screaming and burning under his hands. It broke his heart and Tony sobbed, “This might save Steve but I-I know this-this could kill – this could kill my son.”
Dum Dum, Gab, and Monty were the only survivors. They were old men now but approached Steve and Bucky like a day hadn’t passed since they last parted.
Tony winked at the super solider and Steve smiled warmly at him as he stood up. Tony smirked coyly at his lover once last time before slipping away into the darkness.
“The hero has to do a one-liner before defeating the villain! It’s Hero 101, Pete, looks like you need to brush up on your hero training.”
They kissed again but it was nothing like any of the other kisses. This was a kiss brought about by forbidden secrets being shared and the trust they had in each other. It was about how they both knew, at that moment, what it meant being soulmates. They were truly of one body and soul.
Was the Soldier going to finish him off? Or was he going to seek retribution for their defeating Hydra? Would he hurt Steve more?
Peter had slipped back into sleep after crying in his father’s arms. At first, he slept peacefully with his mind blissfully blank. But the memories found a way to break through the peaceful darkness and his victims screamed beneath his claws.
Tony nodded more vigorously and then got to his feet, saying, “Alright! Let’s go downstairs then! Your aunt is probably ready by now!”
Once inside, he leaned Tony against the granite counter and turned on the shower. He adjusted it accordingly then tested it to make sure it was fine. Satisfied with the water, Steve turned back to Tony.
Steve smiled sweetly at him and whispered, “We have the rest of our lives…that will be our forever. This will be just an annoying little blimp in our reunion.”
The elevator ride up was quiet and awkward and Peter made sure to stand between his father and boyfriend. He held onto Wade’s hand and leaned into his side. Despite the horribly embarrassing way his father discovered them, Peter’s body was still vibrating with adrenaline and desire. His lips felt raw from Wade’s kisses and his nipple was suddenly more noticeable as it was still tingling from Wade’s caress.
Tony was saved from answering when Gabe produced his fiddle and started to play a merry tune. Everyone turned to him and clapped in approval.
Time was so particular when it came to Steve’s death. It technically happened decades ago even though it was still only a couple of weeks to Tony. How long was he going to grieve him? He felt like Bucky must be feeling without his arm. He was missing a piece of himself. He’d never felt this way about anyone before and he darkly wondered if he was going to be grieving Steve’s loss for the rest of his life…
The only sign of Steve’s distress were his brows pinched tightly together and the way his eyes glistened. He then tightly wrapped his arms around himself and Tony saw his knuckles turn white under the pressure. He nodded sharply in agreement but didn’t seem able to voice anything.
“A date, out in the open. I want to be a normal couple out in public,” Steve whispered, nuzzling his face against Tony’s. Tony nuzzled back with a small smile as he placed a hand over Steve’s heart. Steve smiled back and continued, “We can get a bite to eat and flirt without care…walk down the boardwalk holding hands, and I can kiss you without worrying who would see and talk...”
“Hey, don’t forget me,” Tony whined from his bed. Peter and Steve broke apart and he saw his dad was reaching out to him. Peter reached out too and clasped his father’s hand and, even though they were merely holding hands, Peter took comfort in its warm, calloused grip. Steve was alive, Wade was alive, his fathers were alive,
“Thank God,” Tony gasped and his hands shot up around Steve's neck and drew him down. Tony's hips automatically started to move against his and Steve peppered kisses all over his face, making his soulmate laugh joyfully.
“Oh, don’t pretend to be innocent,” Bucky snapped. His glare fell back on Steve and he demanded, “How long has this been going on?”
Tony snorted having way too much fun with this. It was completely different being in the future compared to his time in the past. His own era wouldn’t be affected or changed by anything he would do. He could relentlessly tease his future son and take joy in the fact that he and Steve were going to have a happy life. They’ll fight some wannabe comic book villains with a ridiculous team name and then be on their way to their era where they could
He got off his workbench and stumbled over to the box which contained his meager supply. He had it discreetly shipped to him the day prior and had to pay extra to have it labeled as “spare parts.”
Steve paced the perimeter, always keeping the roof access within his sights. The Iron Man suit stood docile but Steve knew Jarvis was monitoring the area and keeping SHIELD off their trail electronically.
Escaping the Tower, without notice of the paparazzi, had been anticlimactic. Tony had a secret tunnel in his an underground garage which opened up in a neighboring parking garage across the street. It was the same one Ben used every time he visited.
Tony, Steve, and the rest of the Avengers tried to ignore it all and live out their lives as normally as possible. Yet, whenever they went out, they were hounded by reporters for their opinion.
“It’s not like that,” Peter replied with an eye roll. He lightly pushed Eddie in the arm and said, “Smell you later.”
“Now…Shall we go over what you shall say when you meet the Captain and his husband?” The Goblin informed her more than asked.
Heimdall did not move from his post, but, he did point his golden gaze to his prince and question, “A word, my Lord?”
“I’ve got a safe house,” Stark stated. He was holding his left arm like a lifeline but his stance and voice were determined.
He remembered Bucky’s father after Bucky’s mother died. He gave up on life and wasted away within a week. Tony could do the same. He’d waited so long for Steve and if he lost him now-!
they were fruits. Law protects those who ain’t white or Christian but law says men going with men ain’t right, even with a soul implant saying otherwise.”
“It is real, jerk,” Tony replied cheerfully. Bucky flinched and Tony sobered up and assured, “You’re free from the nightmare. You’re safe…”
He supported Bucky to the nearest workbench and he beared most of the Commando’s weight as he transported him.
“I don’t know…It must have just showed up because this is the first time I’m seeing it,” Tony murmured. Steve frowned at the mark and Tony grasped the hand tracing it with a chuckle. Tony kissed his fingers and pressed Steve’s hand over his reactor as he promised, “I’ll check on it first thing in the morning, I promise…”
Steve threw himself at Tony and happy tears immediately fell from his eyes as he embraced his soulmate.
She gave him a tour of the Tower and finished with her own floor. She explained it would be his as well and…he couldn’t explain the emotion that rose up with this information…
Norman’s horrifying revelation was disturbing but when Jarvis alerted them, saying Peter had jumped of their balcony, Steve crumbled beneath the two stressors.
“No!” Steve gasped and jolted forward instinctively, almost hurdling himself off the building. Yet Venom was not destroyed like he feared and reformed in a matter of seconds. It shrieked in Hulk’s face, baring over two dozen, long, sharp teeth. Hulk roared in reply and drew back his fists again.
Steve jumped as soon as her hand came into contact with that button and was flying in the air toward Tony.
Tony and Steve let go of each other and exchanged chuckles. Jacques tossed Tony another beer and he cracked it open. When he saw Steve wasn't partaking, he asked, “Why aren't you celebrating?”
He did not tell them who he really was and doubted they would believe him. He even rescinded that he was a soldier so the Army would not investigate. Supposedly, he was over ninety years old now but did not look like he had aged at all in the last seventy years…he would not believe him either.
The Soldier moved quickly. Thor was stronger than him so he used his speed to twist in his hold and break away from the Norse God.
“You got out of bed, didn’t you?” Tony deflected, dragging himself back to the struggling pair. Wade was impaled but refused to let go and Venom was trying its damnedest to get him off of it.
In retaliation, her mate slammed his head into hers and the world swam before her. He wrapped his hands around her throat and choked her. For a moment, her heart seized with fear as the air constricted in her throat but her training kicked in and she calmed down.
Tony nodded and his eyes traveled down, starting at Steve’s lips then slowly traversed the rest of his body. They weren’t touching yet but Tony’s leg was close enough that he could feel the heat coming off him. Steve was so tempted to lean further into him but he restrained himself.
Peter hiccupped and sniffed loudly at the snot dripping from his nose. Steve brushed back his son’s tears again and whispered, “Promise me you will always look after him…Dad, Uncle Bucky, and the others are going to be sad but you, Peter, you always make them feel better. I don’t know what you do but your presence alone puts them at ease.”
Tony jerked his head out of her hold and looked down at the components he was working on and murmured. “Nothing, what’s wrong with the news?”
“We did something—something foolish that made Hulk and Venom take power and kill. We’re guilty of that. Yet, us –
Tony, gasped, “I didn’t notice you weren’t aging because you are always wearing different clothes and, dammit, maybe I was willfully blind to it!” Tony grasped Steve’s hands tightly and held onto him like he was his lifeline. Steve tightened his grip on Tony, relaying the shared sentiment. Tony nearly sobbed, “I don’t want to grow older than you!”
He blinked down at her in confusion and she just smiled at him. The alcove was tight and his body was pressed into hers. She lay her hands on his chest and whispered, “I missed this. No one else could keep up with me like you can.”
“We can – should talk about it, I mean, it’s your life and I don’t –,” Peter began haltingly. He had felt stupid doing it over the phone and wished he'd waited until they were together-in-person when he brought it up.
Thank you to everyone who has been following this series from the beginning and thank you for the kudos and comments!
Tony grinned, happy to hear his name on Wade’s lips. Tony leaned back into his bed and said, “Good. Now that we’re officially on a first name basis, we can discuss the merits for having me as your father-in-law.”
“Make up with him,” Peggy urged. “Or you might regret this for the rest of your life… Go to him now while Howard is preoccupied.”
! Oh my God, no!” Peter laughed. The image of the blonde with a boner nonetheless came to mind and Peter's laughing increased and he had to roll onto his side to properly breathe.
Even with all of these thoughts tumbling through his mind, there he was, still in Steve’s arms, and feeling…comfortable.
"You'd really do that for me?" Peter whispered, shocked by what he'd accomplished. The Avengers and the X-Men had been trying to do this for years.
An Anon pointed out some legalities to me so I reworded the judge's verdict at the end of the hearing and also added a second testifier! It's only about a paragraph of information and it doesn't change the verdict but you're welcome to reread the end and make yourself more frustrated with it! :D
Steve came first and Tony thrust madly into his fist and came quickly after. Steve fell on top of Tony and Tony wrapped his arms around him.
The Soldier was drawn back to consciousness by a feminine voice. When he opened his eyes, the woman’s form swam in his vision until her image cleared.
They were both wearing nice suits and kissing. Future Steve was cupping Future Tony’s jaw, the gold bands were on their fingers clear as day.
Howard sighed heavily again, and his eyes fell back onto Tony. Without raising his gaze, Howard stated, “Again…I’m sorry…”
“Where are we?” Steve asked as he slowly turned to take it all in. There was also a door, bolted shut with five deadbolts and a board across the middle. It wouldn’t be easy to get in or out unless you teleported as they did.
It was the second boom that got Steve moving. He ran to the property without a second thought, his apprehensive mind was totally focused on Tony’s fate.
She strolled past them and sat on the couch as she replied, “I kept a few mementos from my days as your assistant…and I hope you didn’t think SHIELD wouldn’t notice you carrying Captain Steve Rogers into your tower right after you were involved in a hostage situation.”
Tony told himself, come morning, he was going to stop beating around the bush and just confront Steve about it. He did not get a wink of sleep as he examined his conversation with Natasha and Steve’s sudden departures after they made out and after dinner.
“He’s an ally,” Steve reassured the soldier, getting to his feet slowly as to not startle the man. He was already upset for losing his best friend and stressed from nearly dying himself.
“Director Coulson said he was going to assign you to the president’s detail,” Natasha said. “But that was before you ran off with a known felon and spent the night with him.”
It probably would've been a wise thing to do. Steve glanced around the room and saw no one paying any particular attention to them and it was because of that, that he decided, “I don't want to delay another moment.”
“Didn’t mean to interrupt but it seemed like you two were entering some pretty personal territory there,” Tony murmured, his voice also sounded harsh but it was not as bad as Peter’s.
“Louis!” The father yelled, running into the back entrance of the church. Another priest appeared and the father gasped, “I need to borrow your van!”
“TONY?!” Steve screamed and the Winter Soldier used the distraction to hit him across the head with his gun and then point the weapon at Steve. Steve knocked the gun out of his hand with his shield and the two started to exchange wild punches and kicks. Steve was getting beaten badly as he kept looking down at Tony.
Solo had also helped him to search for Peggy, to see if she was still alive…and she was… It took them a quick internet search at a library in a rundown neighborhood to find her.
Steve flinched but was able to catch it. It was of them at the restaurant. Someone caught a picture of them from behind staring out at the ocean and holding hands on the table.
Steve shakily stood up and sat next to Peter on the bed. Staring at the ground, his shocked expression still in place, Steve easily put it all together. He loved Bucky, how couldn’t he? He was his best friend for the majority of his life and knew nearly everything about Steve. He was also the first man he ever loved. He would always have a place for him in his heart. But the love he felt toward Bucky had changed. He fell in love with him yes but he had smothered it and it died. It was tragic but it happened.
Lost in his thoughts, he barely noticed Tony leading him again with his hand on Steve’s back until they were outside and a car door was opened for him. Steve glanced around them. They were behind the police station in the fenced off parking lot. There was no sign of reporters or a single camera.
“Shut it!” Natasha growled and tried lunging at him again. Bucky backed off and clenched his fists at his side, his metal fist sparked from the hole created by the dagger Natasha had stabbed him with.
The engines were a constant high pitched hum as were the lighter rumble of the air vents, pushing out a continuous flow of fresh, cool air. He could make out the muffled voices of the President’s staff beyond the wall, indistinguishable through the thick walls. Occasionally, he heard someone walk past the sealed door, their footfalls thumping heavily on the carpeted floor.
The audience leapt to their feet and cheered as his father came on stage. Peter smiled gratefully at Tony as he sauntered on stage. He wasn’t scripted to come on but, since Sophie decided to go off script, his dad thankfully decided to make the intrusion. He was dressed for comfort more than for an interview so a picture of a calico cat was plainly on the shirt underneath his blazer. Peter could practically hear Pepper groaning already.
It was only after Bucky needed his metal hand repaired, after being impaled by Natasha, that Bucky and Tony were forced to interact. Tony originally only said he would repair the hand because Steve asked it of him but he quickly became fascinated by the mechanics of the arm.
“Tony doesn’t know I left. Can you go to him and let him know…and just be there with him. He’s in a fragile state right now and will need someone and his Aunt Peggy will probably be the best person for the job.”
His bedroom was not too far away and, as soon as he pulled Steve into the room, Steve pulled back and drew Tony back to his embrace and warm kiss.
“Dummy, stay!” Peter commanded. The robot shook then raised its arm as high as it could. Both boys followed its hand and, as the boys were distracted, the robot blasted between them and escaped.
“Nothing,” Tony moaned. They’d only known each other less than two years but his son already knew him too well. Peter knew something was bothering him. He explained, “It’s something I haven’t done just yet…”
“Anthony Edward Stark, if this is fake or real, I want you to swear to me right now that you are not going to treat Steve like one of those ditzy one-night-stands you usually hook up with. Because Steve is
“Very well, Sir. I will calibrate the machines in the workshop,” his AI replied promptly. Tony sighed heavily again and pulled the towel off his waist to fluff up his hair to rid it of moisture.
“James don’t!” Natasha begged, her voice breaking through to him. Her hands were digging into his biceps but he barely heard or felt her.
Steve took another step back and his eyes spanned over the room, pinpointing where everyone stood and looking for a way to slip past their defense. Their defense was solid but he spotted another player in the game who must have slipped in while Tony distracted him.
Tony told Pepper he could speak and he really thought he could. He had assumed he had gone through the worst of it in the private ceremony where the emotions were more raw and true. Yet he was still too emotional and, with tears still running down his face, he stepped up to the podium. Dozens of microphones were attached to the podium and he could barely see over them. Cameras clicked and flashed madly as they captured his grief and immortalized it. To the world, Tony announced, “Steve was a noble hero, an amazing man, a doting father, and a loving husband. Without him, my life…” Tony inhaled deeply as he was overcome with emotion. The world was watching him and he always thought he was used to their prying eyes but he had never been under their scrutiny when his chest was flayed open for all of them to see. Tony felt like all the mechanical eyes of the cameras were stealing more than just his image, but pieces of himself as well. They hallowed him out, taking what little was left.
Natasha glanced at Steve and saw the man was purposely staring straight down at the paper to avoid having to look at Stark.
Steve deflated but kept on a pleasant expression as he listened to his soulmate describe his love life.
“I think I might have hallucinated a little before passing out…” Tony joked to his friend. Rhodey did not find it as humorous as he did and his frown deepened.
Tony cupped his mouth to muffle his laughter and poked his head up again. Pepper was fuming and Tony innocently asked, “What?”
How was it possible Tony ever assumed he could shoulder Steve’s death without it affecting him?? They’d just entered the serious territory of their relationship and Tony already didn’t want to let him go.
A wide range of emotions crossed Steve’s face as he looked at the photo. Surprise, joy, sadness…it was all there. He put down his mug, still staring at the image, and scratchily gasped, “You would not believe how many days I stared at that photo and
He could already picture Cable’s frown deepening further with Tony’s appearance at the apartment and his glare burning two parallel holes into Steve.
Tony slid off his jacket and moved with ease. He was wearing one of his designer suits with his buttoned-down shirt was too thick to see his reactor’s glow. He was not wearing a tie and the top few buttons were undone to give Steve a glimpse of his throat.
But she did not pull the trigger. She was intrigued by his reaction but tensed when he got within attacking distance. He stopped when the barrel of her pistol pressed into his chest.
Peter groaned, “Oh God, is that true? What pictures have they been using? Wait, no, I don’t want to know!”
Cable nodded and said, “I couldn’t say anything until today. I thought you should know, your time traveling is over but the designs that Stark had created will live on in the future…and the past.”
“That’s the last thing we should do,” Tony stated and found Steve’s belt. He unbuckled it and slipped his hand in his pants. Steve began to breathe shallowly and trembled in Tony’s hold as he stroked him.
Tony was halfheartedly tinkering in his lab. His grief was no longer the soul-shattering thing that had debilitated him at Steve’s funeral but, a month later, it was still an omnipresent force that was weighing him down.
Additionally, I added more to chapter 5 (the prior chapter) a couple of days after I posted it so check it out! It's the very end of the chapter and I added more to the exchange between Tony and Fury.
The breath caught in Steve’s throat and his chest seized so tightly that his heart couldn’t possibly beat anymore.
Natasha and Coulson grimly listened to the operator relay the information over the police scanner. Natasha turned to Coulson and whispered, “Can you keep it from Tony until we confirm?”
Tony had curled up into a ball on the bathroom floor. He kept his eyes open, not wanting to close them and remember the darkness.
Steve watched him with a curious expression and Tony asked, “Have you ever had before? Want to try?”
. He could get his father to go as far to kick Eddie out of the program. The lab and Venom could be his alone.
Happy with the state of his fingers, Pepper let him go and then said, “All the cleaning products are kept over here.” Bucky wordlessly followed her and Tony covered the growing smile on his face upon seeing Bucky’s perplexed expression.
Tony carded his fingers into Steve’s hair and caressed his scalp. Tony could only imagine the thoughts going through Steve’s head and how long he’s been thinking this. He had to set this straight.
The door to the lab opened before Tony could reply and Steve stepped in. He was still in his uniform but he had removed his helmet. Tony's stupid first thoughts were about how much better Steve looked without it…
Tony’s eyes snapped back open and his guilt redoubled. He wasn’t going to get any rest until he could finally meet Steve’s gaze and he could finally answer Steve wordless plea.
Tony didn’t look down at his chest cavity like everyone else was. The smoke was definitely coming from the inside of the reactor. Which was a big fucking problem because that was where the more fragile and complicated materials were…
“I went back to a night you wrote about in your biography, Stark. The night your mentor betrayed you and you almost died if it were not for this?” The Goblin turned the device in his hand and everyone in the area held their breath. Steve’s eyes focused on it and felt his breathing grow shallow. Did…Did the Goblin go back to that night? Did he take that reactor before Tony could use it? What would that mean for Tony?? The Goblin continued, “Since you will never write your biography…I hypothesize someone else will probably write: ‘If only Stark’s original reactor did not disappear that fateful night, he might have lived.’”
Tony stared straight ahead, refusing to look at Steve as he mutely returned to changing into his uniform. Without a doubt, Tony knew Steve was thinking of the one solution he thought left to them.
Yet whenever these dark thoughts threatened to overcome him again, Steve need merely glance behind him, meet Tony’s warm gaze, and forget all about it. With one look, Tony made him feel like everything was alright and he could figuratively feel their love pool into his chest.
“Peter!” Natasha hissed and Peter jolted to a stop several feet away. Natasha turned to him the demanded, “Tell me exactly what Uncle Tony told you to say to me.”
Tony stood up on the tips of his toes for a quick, chaste kiss and murmured, “Love you too, babe. I’ll keep you updated.”
His host was silent and had stopped speaking altogether after the first few feedings but Venom could feel the boy’s consciousness paying attention.
He slipped the sweats on under his hospital gown then tucked the gown into them like he would a shirt.
“No, I noticed them but I choose to answer you,” Tony replied cheekily and ducked back down just because he knew it would piss her off.
Coulson nodded and said, “The President’s detail will be here in an hour to pick you up. The Parkers will be notified to come then to pick up Peter. You have until then.”
It took only an hour for Steve to learn how to operate a tablet and search the internet. Tony directed him to the historically correct websites and Steve dived into learning what had happened since he woke. He’d learned some of the basics already by word of mouth but desperately needed to know more everyday details that most deemed unimportant.
Pops left, following the same path Uncle Tony had taken to exit. Peter watched him leave with shock as his pops’ statement finally made sense.
“I love you too, Peter,” Wade whispered and his leaned in and kissed Peter again. This time he did it more slowly, cherishing every touch of their mouths, fingertips, and bodies. Peter was more precious than his own life and he tried to express this with his kiss.
“Because of the damage to your reactor,” the AI guessed. “Then, because of your presence, I take it we have the means to return to the future?”
Peter, back from the dead and looking like he hadn’t aged in the five years since the dusting, was already at Tony’s side. His voice crackled as he tried to cajole his father to life.
He found a spot in some thick brush and untied his handmade knapsack. He lay it across his chest for some warmth and settled down. His stomach grumbled unhappily but his exhaustion eventually silenced it and Steve fell asleep.
That very fact hadn’t been probable since he had met and started dating Steve over five years prior.
“Yes, he should arrive before liftoff,” the President replied. A secret service agent drew the President aside to tell him something in private so the President did not see Steve scowl.
He was so very conscious of their state of undress and Tony’s familiar touches. His body was beginning to react and, with
He touched the place on his neck where he had been cut in the future and the robots had been near frantic to heal it.
. He was so tempted to pinch himself. Was this really happening? He felt like he was acting out one of his personal fantasies. He shrugged and said, “Um, I’ll just follow your lead? I’ll stop you if it gets too…weird.”
“Please,” the man begged, the pleading in his voice piercing Tony’s very soul at the sound. What on earth? The man continued, “Forget me.
As Jarvis made the changes, Tony glanced over his shoulder, but Jarvis beat him to it and stated, “I have yet to find any additional information on the man who entered the property.”
Steve flushed, they never really talked about it. He slowly murmured, “…Well we were best friends for a long time –
“Mr. Brock, Dr. Banner says he would welcome your input. Shall I direct you to his location?” Friday said as he finished dressing into his mussed clothes.
“In the backyard, in full view of the surrounding buildings?” Tony asked to get his point across about the possibility of paparazzi. Steve nodded, flushing slightly. Tony’s heart constricted as he saw the flush but he pretended not to notice Steve’s aversion and turned to the others as he said, “Alright, let’s eat!”
Tony faced Steve with a groan. His chest collapsed against Steve’s legs and he dropped his face into Steve’s crotch. Steve hissed with indignation, “
It had been like the last chapter to the first book of the series of their lives. A pivotal time that neither of them would ever forget.
“He started working on it in his teens, after his parents died. Knowing him, he probably did it so he wouldn’t be alone. He wanted you but you never appeared.” All the upset Steve had been feeling toward Tony vanished and he stared at Natasha with wide eyes to express his shock. She continued, “When he was still alone, he did stupid things, trying to fill that empty space that you were supposed to fill. He isn’t doing it anymore. He hasn’t for years so do not look at that dark period in his life and use it to judge him now.”
The hope in his voice made Steve wince. Peter was usually closed mouth on the topic of his mother. He had never met her but Steve knew his son ate up every little fact he could learn about her. For Peter’s sake he hoped it was true. Steve’s own heart was racing as hope billowed his chest. Could it be possible? Could Mary be alive??
Steve clutched his arm closer to him and peered at the numbers. It wasn’t a figment of his imagination.
Sam had stayed with him until he could breathe and then stayed to talk him through it. Steve told him about his and Tony’s relationship through broken gasps and Sam did not judge either of them but told him to stay strong and not give up on him. Someone wanting to betray him would have turned tail and run at the first sign of tears.
“And if we told you about it before you even met him…” Tony added and trailed off, the implications obvious.
“I’m sorry,” Steve hissed, wishing he could take on all the pain himself. Blood was still dripping from his mouth but now that he was on his side it was no longer pooling at the back of his throat. Tony gasped for breath, never once releasing Steve’s hands.
“I didn’t even get it to reveal its dastardly plan,” Peter grumbled. Ultron clenched its fists and stepped away from whatever it was working on to fully turn its attention on them.
He was left with a dollar after the transaction. He asked the man bagging his items, “What’s the fastest way to get to Malibu from here on foot?”
James closed his eyes, his mind still on the blond boy as he fell asleep, and his dreams were irrevocably filled with red, white, and blue imagery.
Thank you for all the comments, kudos, and numerous hits so far! This fic has been an emotional rollercoaster and is finally coming to a close! :)
“I have to do an emergency fix to the armor,” Tony had lied last minute. “I noticed something wrong with the code. It’ll take me all day to figure out. If I don’t work on it now, a super villain will show up and my armor will stop working in the middle of the fight!”
“I’m sorry, boss. I am not at liberty to divulge any information about the past or why Jarvis is not here without threatening the timeline,” the new AI replied.
,” his Pops gasped, his voice filled with a combination of pity and comfort, and Peter was instantly confused.
“So is mine, baby boy. You make my mind twist about every time you enter the room,” Wade murmured, rubbing his face against Peter’s.
The gates began to open and Steve wetly chuckled, “It’s good to hear you, Jarvis, is Tony – is Tony, okay?”
Bucky rubbed his forehead and murmured, “Jumbles. Only a little bit of you…Mostly… Mostly I remember killing people. Shooting them in the back, in the head, in the heart, or in the stomach so they would die painfully and slowly…”
Steve dropped his head and felt his eyes heat up. It had been years since the unfairness of the situation affected him so. He tried to keep his emotions to himself but sky darkened above them and the field they had been sitting on appeared more ominous in the dark.
“No!” The sudden exclamation took all of them by surprise and Wade turned to Brock. He was still reaching out to Venom and he gasped, “Come back to me.
James did not reply to either of them. His eyes were focused on the door. With horror churning in her gut, she knew that he had to be waiting for his orders.
Peter felt so exponentially heavier to him than he had a few minutes before. He never imagined meeting his future son like this and so soon.
Another minute passed and then Wade replied: ‘You just made me smile so sweetly that I could have given you cavities so I had to punch something to feel like a man again instead of gingivitis.’
Eddie opened the small fridge under Mac’s workstation. Sitting in a large, triangular flask was Mac’s project, its codename, VENOM, was etched into the glass. It contained a pitch black liquid, darker than ink and reminiscent of the dark hole it was born from in space.
She clenched her fists, but Howard did not waver. He needed to make the new element, not help her investigate a probable murderer.
Cable walked up to them and nodded at Steve and said, “Glad to see the current you right now. I prefer you to the past, mopey you.”
Tony’s eyes flickered to him and then back to Wade and he reiterated, “I was just clarifying the nature of your relationship. I wanted to know if you both have the same version of it going into it.”
Tony sighed heavily and wondered if he should sit Steve down or maybe put a comforting hand on his shoulder. The larger man’s posturing was dying down as his concerned confusion grew.
Steve unhooked his own from where it was hanging on the wall and whispered, “This is really happening…”
Marston quirked an eyebrow but rolled with it and joked, “Jeez, Tony, I knew you loved being on my show but I think you’re taking it a little too far…” They and the audience laughed at Marston’s jibe. Marston continued, “Seriously, guys, everybody wants to know…what’s it like in that Tower? Steve, what’s life like with
Steve felt his jaw drop at the vulgar question. His lawyers had advised him to answer “No comment” to all questions but Steve felt compelled to state, “
“He’s not slowing down,” Thor observed and swung his hammer but, before he could leap, the Hulk caught Tony and crashed to the ground.
Steve turned back to him with his brows pinched and his eyes glistening. Tony could tell by the way the super soldier was clenching his jaw that he was steeling himself for whatever Tony was going to say. Tony gently held Steve’s hand with both of his and whispered, “Even if this was my era…I wouldn’t be able to fix this…Palladium was the
Tony’s faceplate rose, revealing an uneasy expression. He hissed, “The suit disconnected as soon as we landed.
Tony threw himself into his work and would go days without sleeping. But, even in the dreamscape, he’d keep working, drawing out plans or discussing weapons or their history with Steve. Steve always lectured him on getting proper sleep but Tony seemed to enjoy being “babied” and would smile joyfully at Steve whenever he did it.
“Maybe I should change too,” Steve soberly murmured as he deflected his gaze from Tony and looked down at himself. He was wearing the same clothes that he had worn to the zoo. It was a buttoned down blue shirt and khaki trousers. Maybe he should change into his formal army uniform or a suit like Tony.
Tony glanced at him then back to Steve and the symbiote on his back. He whispered, “I can build something with the same high pitch in five minutes.”
“Yes, sir…and, sir, Stark is based in New York. He has recently shown an interest in Project Rebirth. He may –.”
“Jarvis,” Tony growled. “Tell the rest of the Avengers it was a false alarm and the alarm was made by me messing with the system. I want to meet this scumbag by myself.”
“May, get out of here. If they ask, you aren’t with us," Tony hissed to the older woman. May looked like she wanted to object but Tony shot away from her on the bench and went to Steve’s side. Steve picked up Peter and he and Tony began to walk hurriedly to Tony’s car.
By the way the super soldier had collapsed heavily into the bench beside him after their timers went out, Tony guessed Steve hadn’t thought this was possible either.
Peter took a step toward the door but Happy jumped in front of him, gasping, "At least let me check the grounds!"
Peter stubbornly crossed his arms across his chest and jutted his bottom lip out. He did not refute it. He couldn’t. Steve spoke only the hard truth.
. I can find traces of Peter’s DNA in it to draw the symbiote to Peter but since your genetic codes are so similar the Venom remains on you are evolving and adhering to
Peter covered his eyes with a groan. Aunt May and Wade were going to be a terrible force. Steve also chuckled and Peter peeked out at him from between his fingers.
Rogers slouched and he shifted his cup on the table but did not pick it up. He whispered, “I understand.”
“Your past,” Steve elaborated. “You’ve held so much back because you’re afraid it’ll affect the future but I’m missing out on pieces of you. I want to know all of it…I swear I won’t tell a soul or let it influence me…”
Only when the rubble had settled and the man who broke the walls was seemingly gone, did Peter gasp, “What was that??”
Tony broke their kiss with a breathless chuckle and dragged his hands from Steve’s hair to cup his jaw. He gasped against Steve’s mouth, “I can’t believe we’re doing this.”
“Yes, thank God,” Pepper said, turning to the Scarlet Witch. “Can you unwrinkle all of their clothes, fix their hair, and then get rid of the hickies on Tony’s neck?”
“Your assumptions are correct, Barton,” she stated and clenched the bullet in her fist. She turned back to Tony and went back to where she had been standing previously. She said, “Stark, we have a suspect. We’re going to have to narrow our search and get people looking on foot as well. SHIELD will need to be contacted and the island needs to be cut off within the hour.”
Bucky blinked open his eyes with a small smile on his lips that smile disappeared as his eyes focused on Steve. He sat up and looked around them then his shoulders slumped.
Brock visibly gulped and replied, “Yes…but, there’ll no way to control the current. Peter would receive the same voltage.”
Uneasiness churned Steve’s stomach as everything was spiraling out of control. He whispered, “What does SHIELD want?”
Steve ran his fingers over Tony’s scalp and Tony caught Steve’s hand before he could pull it out of his hair. He thread his fingers through Steve’s and forced him to keep his hand on his head. Tony was biting his bottom lip nervously and eyeing Steve uncertainly.
“Alright, go away!” Tony replied. He grabbed Steve and pulled him back on top of him. “If you leave me hanging now I will be miserable the rest of the day.”
Steve lounged on an old couch in the workshop, right next to Peter’s mock workstation. There he watched Peter play and Tony work. He usually sketched both of them. He filled his notebooks with their images.
Tony smiled that smile he reserved for Steve alone and, all these years later, the butterflies still fluttered in his stomach at the sight.
“Jarvis?” Tony murmured in surprise. Steve turned around and saw Tony peering down at the ground which should have been opening and dismantling the armor from his person. Louder, he repeated, “Jarvis??” As if the AI did not hear him.
Tony clenched his fists when he saw Steve’s shoulders slump further. He couldn’t hide the pain from his gaze as their eyes met. He didn’t want this and didn’t want Steve to leave…
This fic, as the rest of the fics in this series, are all seen from Steve's POV. So if you are reading this for Bucky/Nat you will not get much insight into their feelings. In addition, the marriage tag is in reference to Steve and Tony.
As soon as his eyes fell on him, Tony shook his head just enough to wordlessly try and stop Steve. Steve bit down on his lip and wordlessly mouthed, “I love you” to his mate.
The last time he had shared a bed with Steve was the night before the helicarriers fell. That night was the only night they had together when they were safe and in love and so happy. And now it was gone.
Tony pulled Steve deeper into his face and pressed another kiss into Steve’s forehead. Steve relaxed into his hold so he continued to pepper his face with kisses. All were meant to comfort and nothing more.
Hello, everyone! I’m sorry for the long hiatus. I have not posted in a while because my brother was at the Las Vegas shooting and we came very close to losing him. And then the same night he finally came home I got in a bad car accident... Needless to say, my family and I went through a lot of emotional upheaval and I’m just now getting back to my writing.
"Oh God, baby," Steve gasped breathlessly. He shifted his hips with another breathless gasp and moaned from the movement. Tony cardded his fingers into Steve's and they latched onto each other tightly. Tony leaned into their connected hands and whispered, "You ready?"
Tony continued, “Anyways, I like both men and women. Not many know I’m bisexual because I’m picky with my men. They have to have the physique of a Greek God to have a chance to get into my bed. Which, once again, is your fault Cap.”
She expected her soulmate to be a civilian but she was prepared for someone who was as trained and experienced as she was. They were soulmates after all. It stood to reason that they would be similar in that deadly aspect as well.
Gritting his teeth, Steve slowly raised his hands over his head. Beside him, Tony did the same, cursing lightly under his breath.
His dad collected Peter into his arms and whispered in a hushed voice, “It’s okay, buddy. I’m here. You’re safe. The nightmares are over…”
As soon as Steve stepped out of the car cameras flashed and Steve was surrounded by his friends. They protected him from the tide of people asking for a comment.
Tony led them back into the living room and Peter watched his every movement. He was built like Peter, his body small and sleek but contained well-defined muscles. His hair was dark, like Peter’s, but contained a few grey streaks. He shuffled his feet as he walked with a slight hunch to his back. He stole a fugitive glance at Peter and their eyes met for the briefest of seconds.
“Because you awe my Papa,” Peter replied. “Since I’m your son, you made me feel good and wheneva you awe with me I feel good.” Steve smiled warmly at Peter and clasped his son’s sides lightly.
A familiar figure approached them out of the mass of SHIELD agents, looking as annoyed as when they last saw him in their era.
like him, Dad. I know there are other sides to him. I know he’s hurt others because sometimes I was on scene when it happened! He’s done bad, but he’s also done good! And…I hope, if I ask, that he’ll turn over a new leaf…He cares for me too, Dad. I think he’d do it.”
Tony kept walking and he heard Steve’s footsteps pick up a moment later. He was strangely silent so Tony glanced back at him and nearly stumbled over his feet.
Tony was chattering happily as he told Steve about everything he knew to have had happened since he fell asleep. Steve listened quietly and leaned heavily into him as they walked through the hotel. When they entered their hotel room, Steve sat on the bed and Tony went into the kitchen to make coffee for both of them. He continued to tell him about Natasha being a BAMF and how she kicked it to Hydra and SHIELD by uploading SHIELD’s files onto the world wide web.
A madman who called himself Doctor Doom tried to take over Washington D.C. with giant “doom-bots.” All the Avengers were called in to bring his invasion to a stop.
He stopped talking and the room got so quiet that Steve could have sworn Tony stopped breathing. He could tell Tony wanted to say more but he remained tightlipped as if unable to speak anymore.
His dad jolted upright upon the sound of his cry and all the confusion left his eyes and were replaced by a sad but comforting warmth. He leaned forward and lightly grasped Peter’s hands. He whispered, “It’s alright. There’s nothing to apologize for. You were having a bad dream, weren’t you?”
nothing! The past is gone! There's nothing you can change about it! I am not the same man I was ten years ago and I gladly let it go. And
The Soldier narrowed his eyes and then his arm swung up and he shot at them. Steve instantly raised his shield and blocked the bullets from hitting either of them.
Steve carefully set Peter down and he crawled past Clint and to the couch he had been sitting at. He ran his hands over the soft fabric, enthralled by the cushioned material.
Tony looked from Steve and then to Bucky and then he pushed himself up. Steve scrambled to his feet and he gasped, “Don’t get up, Tony!”
“Ever since I learned about him I have been scared,” Steve whispered. He ran a hand over Peter’s tiny head and continued, “I’m scared the gamma-radiation could kill him at any moment, I’m scared he might Hulk out like Bruce...I’m scared that if he does survive that he will hate me when he’s older…” Tony grasped his arm and Steve’s hand unconsciously went over his and squeezed it tightly. Steve continued, “I have been totally unsure of myself ever since I agreed to take care of Peter. I have never doubted my abilities until now… I feel weak around him. I am so scared I am going to mess up.” He turned to Tony and did nothing to mask his fear as he gasped, “Whenever I loved someone that person was always torn from me. My mother to death, Bucky to death and then the Winter Solider, and Peggy to time and Alzheimer’s. I’m terrified that fate will tear him out of my grasp just like everyone else.”
Tony grasped Peter’s arm and said, “You may grow up to be as strong as your Pops but you are going to grow up as awesome as your Uncle Tony!”
“He didn’t hit his head, Buck…” Steve sighed and continued his fanning. Of all of the reactions he imagined from the man, he never expected Howard to faint like one of those petite dames in the movies.
Steve’s entire body stiffened and he keened in a seemingly endless scream that ripped out of his throat and straight into Tony’s heart.
Tony’s emotions were all over the place as he watched Steve wound the cloth bandages around his chest. Steve observed, “You have a lot of scars…”
But by now he knew Tony would not leave him, whatever the verdict, and the fear was washed away as soon as it appeared. Nevertheless, he held Tony a little tighter all the same…
Tony looked over the scan of the decades old report one last time before finally replying, “I think this warrants another call to Coulson.”
“I will not be able to hold the reflective fields up for more than an additional five minutes, sir,” the AI retorted.
“I don’t think I can handle dating anyone right now,” Steve stated. He pinched the bridge of his nose. He could not believe she was bringing this up again. Why was she so intent on setting him up? He stated, “Peter is a handful enough.”
Ross raised the gun and pointed it at Steve’s head. He said, “To save the world, I am willing to do anything, even kill an American Icon.”
A few seconds passed and then the man opposite him rolled his eye and hung up. He explained, “Our consultant is selective on his phone calls.”
“Well usually I’m caught because my sex tape gets leaked,” Tony began and Steve choked on his coffee. Tony knowingly grinned and said, “Yeah, I didn’t think that would be an option.”
“This guy is a major troll,” Sam said, smiling fondly at Steve again. “We were running separately at first and Mr. Super Solider here said, ‘On your left’ every time he passed me.
SHIELD agents moved into a defensive formation, holding their nonlethal, electromagnetic firearms up as Vision landed in the open bay. Wade slumped out of his hold and Wanda gently stepped out of his other arm and moved her hands to drag forward Peter’s frozen body. The SHIELD agents immediately pointed their weapons at his son, making Steve clench his fists tightly. He knew they were aiming for the alien and not Peter but it was still upsetting seeing so many sights leveled on Peter.
There was another explosion closer overhead and Steve pressed his face into Tony’s neck as he jerked away from the blast. Steve lifted his head back up, his flush growing. Steve avoided the awkward situation they were in and instead chastised, “Why did you charge ahead? And what happened to your gun?”
Looking at it caused another wave of pain to flow through him. He made it fuel his anger. He lashed out at Barnes, wanting him to feel the same pain he was. Tony hissed, “That man was
He was half way through, as the sun was just rising over the horizon, and he was finally noticed. He was surrounded by paparazzi in the matter of seconds.
Tony nodded, still not entirely trusting his voice. His heart, however, began to pick up its pace again and his chest was beginning to hurt from the buildup of his anxiety and other emotions.
If it weren’t for Peter, Steve would have yelled obscenities at Jarvis and attempted to tear the door down. Instead, he held Peter close to his heart and listened to his breathing to reassure himself is son was still alive. Peter suffered from hiccups that shook his entire body and an endless amount of tears that did not stop flowing. Other than the hiccups, Peter did not make a noise. He simply held onto Steve’s dog-tags firmly and scrunched his eyes closed tightly, as if he was trying to avoid seeing a world without Tony in it.
Steve expected Peter to be pointing at another animal but, to his surprise, he was pointing to Tony. Tony was dressed in his workshop clothes and wore large mirrored aviator glasses, his hair was a mess and pointed in all directions, he had a fine layer of grime on his skin, and he wore floppy flip flops. He looked more like a bum than one of the wealthiest men on the country.
Steve looked to his outstretched hand and then back to the older man’s open expression. Tony was wary and scared but hopeful. His expression reminded Steve of himself when he agreed to take the serum. Steve grasped his hand and stated, “I swear I will never speak a word of your existence to anyone. You have my word.”
Peter went back to the penthouse tired, nervously excited, but mostly uncertain. He was happy that the experiment stabilized but was unhappy by how that came about and how it was compromising their work.
However, one by one, the Commandos came up to him in the first week and asked him why he left. One by one, he lied to them all, saying he decided he wasn’t cut out for the Commando life after the firefight.
Tony walked over to the suit storage as it opened up in floor in the middle of his workshop. He looked down into the dark depths as a suit detached itself from its container and flew up to meet him.
it even if he couldn’t have children with a woman. Captain America was freaking gay. He didn’t know about the Gay Rights Movement, he didn’t know it was no longer illegal, hell, he didn’t know he could adopt kids either!
They both were filthy from their come but were exhausted from the long day and battle.  Tony could so easily fall asleep at that moment. Everything was back to normal. He was on Earth, no where near that portal, and Steve was in his arms. His eyelids were heavy and already struggling to stay open.
“Steve, promise me you are going to stop this. I know James is your best friend but he—…He and I have a history you and Tony were
“No, Sir, it’s the anniversary of the day you and Captain Rogers reunited. It’s been a year since that day.”
last night. He could not believe he was holding the living, breathing child less than 24 hours later.
Bucky turned to Tony and asked, “So what are we like in the future? Do all of us still hang out or did we all split up after the War? Does Gabe go back to school? Does Steve go back to drawing?? Come on future man, tell us!”
“I’ll explain it all later! You need to tell the others to stop trying to kill it and start trying to contain it!”
Wanda slumped when Hulk hit the shield a second time and the shield fell between the two powerhouses. Venom’s vengeful gaze was drawn away from him and Peter to the incredible Hulk and it shrieked at him. The Hulk roared back and launched himself at the symbiote. Everyone jumped or ducked out of the way but the collision shook Wade down to his very bone marrow. They broke down a wall and the fight was dragged away from them. Wade cautiously uncurled himself from around Peter, his heart pounding wildly from his pumping adrenaline.
“Natasha!” Steve hissed. He did not know what bothered him most, Natasha calling him ‘mommy’ or having Tony fly back here so soon after his confession. His mind was still reeling from the revelation.
“He's my son, Steve,” Tony rationalized. “It's because he's related to me that this is happening. I just want to keep him safe…”
They spent the rest of the flight ignoring each other and, once they reached the helicarrier, they continued to avoid each other. Tony scurried away to the labs with Dr. Banner and Steve stationed himself with Natasha and Coulson in the main hub of the carrier.
It was everything Steve had wanted and they weren't even naked yet. Kissing Tony alone made Steve feel like he was free falling into an endless sky of the universe.
Wade never jumped out of his bed faster and ended up dragging Peter to the bathroom to get into the shower faster. Peter laughed all the way and didn’t stop until they were both in the tiny stall with their bodies pressed together and Wade was kissing him. The water was hot and steaming around them but, somehow, Peter’s tongue felt even hotter in his mouth.
“Peter,” Steve whispered, drawing closer to the computer screen. It appeared to be a regular human in a black all-body suit but Steve knew it was Venom and Peter. They appeared to be working together. Venom never before moved with Peter’s grace. The symbiote had attacked like an animal and not with the graceful skill Natasha had taught his son.
Tony relaxed into his hold and whispered, “Thanks…I love you, Steve. I love you, I love you, I lov –.” Tony would have probably kept whispering the sentiment if Steve had not smothered the words with his mouth.
“Eat me,” Tony mumbled into the mug. His mouth suddenly broke away from the cup with a smile and he chuckled, “Oh wait, you already did.”
Tony returned to the embrace and pressed his face into Steve’s back to hide his ridiculously happy smile. Steve held onto his hands until he was done at the stove and his thumb lightly caressed the top of his hands. How he cooked onehanded Tony could only speculate but… his mind wasn’t on Steve’s cooking abilities.
“Sit up you worthless machine,” he hissed. She glared at James’ master, wanting to attack him for how he treated her mate, but she did not knowing it was futile...
“Always such a romantic,” Peter croaked, his throat felt dry and his voice had to be pushed out with a lot of effort.
They asked him a number of questions about the “supposed” rape and the events that led up to it. They asked for an alibi and, with Jarvis’s help, they were able to prove he in fact had an alibi for the day in question. He had been on a mission for SHIELD, infiltrating a terrorist plane as it was midflight.
Looking at Tony, Steve’s heart fluttered. His eyes focused on the same brown eyes that had caught his attention when he first saw his photo, and he stared at them unabashed. His gaze was even better in the flesh. But, better yet, his mate was a man and he could be with him without fear.
Awake or asleep, Tony would have experienced the sudden, voiding darkness of Steve’s awakened departure.
The city was quieter. Workweek nights were usually slower but Peter darkly wondered if it was somehow connected to the drama of his reveal?
!” Mary growled, slamming her fist down onto the nearest lab table and the metal surface collapsed under her fist.
Steve cupped his face and pressed their foreheads together. He whispered, “Tony, I love you, I married you, for better or for worse, I will be there for you…I was upset last night but, if you had called, if you had needed me, I would have come…”
But then the Goblin smiled manically at them and Steve reached for his shield to try and stop him, but Peter had already taken it back to the locker room. So no one was able to stop the Goblin as he crushed the reactor in his grasp.
Tony smiled warmly and lightly pinched his arm like they had done when they first started seeing each other and whispered, “That I love you.”
“Hello, Dr. Banner,” the young woman said and eyed Steve and Peter curiously. She probably assumed they were guests of Bruce so did not ask him to check in with her. Steve was still wearing his disguise so she did not seem to recognize him.
“Somewhat,” Tony murmured and Steve chuckled. Tony took another drink and then observed, “Isn’t breakfast earlier than usual? We’re not going to be productive today, are we?”
Steve blinked and then his eyes grew larger. His hand tightened on Tony’s and his gaze shot to the ring box and then back to Tony. Gravity seemed to overtake Steve and fell to his knees in front of Tony.
“Hello, sweetheart,” Steve whispered. “I snuck in here so I might have to jump and hide if a nurse comes in.”
Steve could hear bullets clinking against the armor. He looked up and asked the Jarvis on his end, “Jarvis, are you connected to Tony right now? What is happening?!”
The doctor mumbled something a scurried away. Coulson rubbed the back of neck to relieve some of the tension that had gathered there but it was to no avail. He sighed heavily and walked out of the empty room the doctor had pulled him into.
All the rational Tony had, had gone out the window when it came to Steve and his utterly perfect smile.
When she had lowered her gun the day she met him, she told herself she would be cautious around him. She originally saw being soulmates like a cage. She would have been the bird trapped within it and he would have been her handler, feeding her bits and pieces and eventually clipping her wings if their relationship ever came to fruition. So, she decided, she would watch him, see what he had to offer, but as soon as he gave her the chance, she planned to fly away.
“But you love him more,” Bucky whispered for him. “He’s gone, Steve. I can comfort you. I can make you feel better…Please, let me.”
He went into the less busier section of the Stark Enterprises complex and didn’t look back even though he felt multiple eyes watching him go.
“Why would they take your neighbors away like that?! They’re soulmates! The implants chose them for each other!” Steve asked in horror.
Steve entered and looked like he was going to greet him but halted as soon as his eyes focused on Tony. His eyes snapped from Tony and then to the reactor several feet away.
Because he and Tony had been standing together when the rest of the team joined them, they had ended up sitting together too. Steve was Bucky’s other side and Gabe was on Tony’s other. Gabe, however, had been wrapped up in a conversation in rapid French with Jacques so Bucky was the only one to hear the sharp and sudden inhalation from Tony.
It was in the middle of the night in the less desirable part of New York City. Steve did not have his phone, he had left it in Tony’s car and Bucky must have taken his SHIELD communicator so they would not be tracked. No taxis drove down these streets at this time of night so Steve made the long trek home on foot. He almost got mugged twice but easily disabled his both of his attackers.
“Thanks to my blackout windows, they won’t see me or my ‘guest’ until we arrive,” Tony replied, wrapping an arm around Steve’s waist. Looking to Steve he asked, “Ready to go? Or should we do something cliché and have a fight, only to reunite at the fundraiser and slow dance to some 80s music?”
“Tony…you can’t keep him in a glass bubble and protect him from everything. He’s an adult. He needs to make his own choices,” Pepper whispered softly to him.
“Don’t go! I had like my fifth coffee twenty minutes ago,” Tony retorted. “I’m not going to sleep any time soon!”
Ever since he shut down the weapons' sector in Stark Industries, this reactor had been his dream and now it was
Tony returned his sudden kiss and they spent the next few moments letting the kiss overrule everything. Tony dug his fingers into Steve’s scalp and pressed his mouth so tightly to Steve’s that it felt like he was trying to steal his breath. Steve cherished every second and every shared breath.
Killian had wanted his help with his Extremis experiments and went after what made him most vulnerable…his family.
“You could be an Avenger if you only work with us!” Steve argued and grasped Tony’s shoulder, forcing him to look back at him.
“Determination and fortitude,” Wade replied in a serious voice. Peter laughed and began to pull away some blankets.
Steve stared at Tony’s outstretched hand with extreme trepidation. He could not tell Tony his name because then he’d notice the connection between his name and face, and no amount of beard or sunglasses was going to keep Tony from realizing who he was.
It was all too much, the combined knowledge and seeing Tony like this in person. With only a second’s warning, his eyes overfilled, and he inhaled sharply as his chest seemingly collapsed from the immense grief. He put his hand over his mouth as if to smoother any more sounds, but it’d do little good, Tony had seen it all.
Feeling bold and carefree, probably because of the alcohol, Peter leaned in and kissed Wade’s cheek.
It had been a month since the fundraiser and a ritual had been born. Breakfast turned into a team affair (minus the Advil needed for everyone’s hangovers and Steve’s atrocious “hangover” cure).
Steve smiled at Tony as the other man’s eyes dilated with arousal. They were doing this and the notion made Steve’s stomach flutter happily and do a nervous flip.
“But you awe not allowed to ge-get hurted! You awe a superhero!” Peter gasped, his voice bordering on hysterics.
Tendrils of black flesh were beginning to creep along Steve’s limbs and he cupped Peter’s face so his eyes were shielded on either side of his face. He could only look straight ahead at Steve and not see what was happening.
“That was a really stupid move, kid,” Uncle Clint said with a frown and Peter flinched. Even Uncle Clint was upset. That was bad.
Pepper rolled her eyes and replied, "Oh, really? It looked more like you were looking for someone? Is there a more personal reason you happened to show up tonight?"
“Stark s-says he doesn’t do re-reboots,” Wade gasped from his strangled throat and then pressed a button. A wave of blue light pulsed out of the object and, as soon as it hit Ultron, it crumbled. The wave traveled through the entire room and the other bots fell and anything electronic in the area also shut down.
Howard jumped to his feet, clutching his notebook close to his face, staring at the answer that had been with him for years. Hell, Tony fricken’ drew it on the same page as one of his sketches of the base! It was like the universe was screaming at him to notice it!
Wade grinned at him but pressed one more kiss onto Peter’s lips and sat up on Peter’s waist. Peter dragged his hands down Wade’s sides until they latched onto his hips and he held tight, not wanting his boyfriend to move.
“We just need to be calm around him,” Tony whispered with a singsong voice. “Just need to get him in a happy place and Bruce will come out. Right, Big Guy?”
He stopped touching himself and his head fell forward in defeat. He hadn’t been able to touch himself ever since his reunion with Peggy. It felt wrong. She was no longer the girl he was falling for…she had lived a lifetime without him and even imagining her young left a bad taste in his mouth because he knew it was nothing more than a fantasy.
Tony could not leave his side because he knew as soon as he did Steve would martyr himself and Tony could not lose him…even if it meant maybe losing Peter.
Eddie rounded the counter and sat himself opposite Peter, putting the beaker between them. He stated, “Then we’ll just have to find out!”
Next time, Chapter 9: The Trial (if the title doesn't give it away... we finally dive into the trial)
Natasha and Clint were the only ones in the community room with Peter. Tony had yet to come back with his promised toy. Clint leaned back on the couch with his feet up on the coffee table, the remote in one hand and a candy bar in the other. Natasha sat near him with Peter sleeping on her lap. She peered down at the exhausted toddler with a found eye.
“If we want this to work, we need to come out before the DNA results. If we do it after then a good number of people will think it’s a ploy…Are you okay to do another make out session sometime in the next couple of days?”
“Probably has to do with the extra superheroes,” Peter murmured nonchalantly. His dad sent out a lot of last minute invitations to prominent figures in the superhero community. It didn't go unnoticed so those who originally weren't going to go on Sunday suddenly found themselves a perfect reason to go. No one questioned his dad’s motives. They just assumed Tony Stark was making one of his wild parties even more wild.
He was a little embarrassed he hadn’t noticed Steve watching him so much. He reached the end of the images and the last picture, the first Steve drew, were of a couple he’d never seen before.
“Ohhhh a forbidden romance, this just got dirtier,” Tony said with glee and was practically dancing in place.
Steve licked Tony's nipple and whispered hoarsely, “Keep those lips going southward and I will soon not be able to tell you my own name."
Tony smiled halfheartedly at her and whispered, “No, not really...Steve does not seem to share my feelings…but don’t worry about me… Let’s get this press conference over with and clear Steve’s name, hm?”
The judge returned after twenty minutes. Everyone rose as he reentered the room and sat after he did. Steve nervously stared at him and anxiously waited as the judge settled into his seat.
It took Steve a while to fall asleep. Tony could almost feel his dark thoughts as they weighed down on his husband’s shoulders. Only once his muscles relaxed and his breathing evened out, did he know Steve to have finally succumbed to his exhaustion.
Steve’s favorite throw was laying across the corner of the bed and Tony ran his hand over the soft fabric. Memories arose from the feel of the fabric and he recalled many nights cuddling under the blanket with Steve. Tony sat up, running his hand over the fabric and looked to the side.
His excitement disappeared and in its place a large lump filled his throat and threatened to suffocate him.
Steve winced and said, “For a little while…at least it wasn’t seventy years this time?” He tried to make a joke but it seemed to have backfired as Tony’s eyes narrowed.
Peter’s eyes instantly focused on the woman he knew to be his mother. In the flesh, there was so much more to her than what a photo or video could ever show. She was shorter than he had imagined and her skin was paler. Since the only times he saw her before now was via photographs, he always imagined her to be smiling but no smile donned her features currently.
Mary frowned and retorted, “I had been programed with emotions to seem more human and make it easier to gain your trust.” Tony scoffed and rolled his eyes. A muscle in Mary’s jaw twitched and she continued, “I felt guilt.”
There were only two and each had been taken with large groups so Steve’s figure was small and his eyes were hidden behind his cowl so they looked like two black pinpricks.
Steve looked at the hologram and was surprised to see “The History of Gay Rights in the United States” on its screen.
He hung up the phone and, bursting with pride, he saluted the Captain. In the next couple of hours, he will be in the heart of the arctic and at Cap’s tomb.
Tony gritted his teeth as he sat back up and hefted his gun back into his arms. His chest was burning and Tony ran his hand around his reactor, trying to dispel the pain that had grown from the impact. He couldn’t spare any thoughts to the feeling in his chest however, as the Hydra agents began to fire at him again making his Jeep shield shake ominously. He stayed ducked to avoid their initial fire and then jumped up and fired back in a volley of blue rays.
Not Steve too. Don’t let those same words Peter said come from his husband’s lips. It would destroy Tony.
“No, it was traumatic and you’re still healing,” Steve pressed, drawing Tony into a tighter embrace. Tony nestled his head under Steve’s chin and Steve continued, “I can’t control when I leave the dream world but we can control when I enter it. We can have me fall asleep first until you get used to the darkness.”
Tony, more used to these kinds of crowds, cut right through the mass of bodies straight to the car. Tony’s grasp broke from his arm and a great divide was made between them as the reporters rounded on him and ignored Tony. Steve struggled as cameras, microphones, and cell phones were shoved in his face. He moved in the direction Tony had disappeared and hoped it was the right one.
“The sedative does not affect it,” Bruce bit back, his voice tense as Venom stretched itself over Peter, moving his limbs as he did. He continued, “There's nothing we can do…”
“It can be from the both of us,” Tony said, slyly watching his husband from the corner of his eyes. He couldn’t help but grin as he added, “It’ll be the first gift we give as a married couple so we can sign it together…you can even sign it as ‘Pops’.” Tony playfully bumped into Steve’s side as his super soldier blushed happily.
Wade placed a hand on Peter’s shoulder and leaned on his back as he stretched out his arm and held out his hand to the man. Wishing he had his mask on, Wade said, “Thanks for having me over, Mr. Stark!”
His traitorous body interpreted the events of his dream differently and he was painfully hard from the short sequence. Steve stripped and slipped into a cold shower.
Steve stepped closer to Tony and further from the agent on the couch as he stated, “I won’t go to enemy hands. New York is my home. I’m not leaving it.”
All Steve needed to do was find a payphone and type in a certain number which would connect him directly to Jarvis and from there he would be able to reunite with his family.
Steve was angry and uneasy by the fact that Peter had been so close to the Chameleon. Steve could not believe that he had almost brought Peter to meet the villain in disguise! What was the Chameleon’s endgame?? First he impersonated Steve and now Mary. Why?
Peter was sitting up in the infirmary bed and looked like he was smothering laughter. Wade had his mask pulled up to reveal the scarred, bottom-half of his face and he was grinning too.
Natasha pulled her hand back from his chest and loosened her hold the object. Steve instinctively caught it and was surprised to see it was not her gun but his cell phone.
Tony even alluded to the fact that he hadn’t had a serious relationship in years, that he only had flings. He only loved people with his body and not his heart.
“It’s a little late for that you pointy eared freak!” Tony retorted, struggling madly in the larger creature’s hold. Tony got both his arms free and pointed his repulsors at the Goblin’s eyes. He hit him at full blast and the Goblin released him as he screamed with pain.
Natasha chose not to reply to Peter’s question. She turned to Steve with a deep frown and hissed, “You of all people should know I do not want anyone wrapped up in this.”
Tony reached out and grasped his shoulder reassuringly. He whispered, “Hey, don’t worry. I’ll get him the best representation money could buy!”
Tony stepped back and finally pulled the towel from his shoulders. He toweled himself off a little then wrapped it around his hips. He stepped back then pushed himself up on the counter between the sinks and crossed his arms over his chest. He smiled smugly at Steve and nodded to him as he said, “Well…Strip. You can’t go in with clothes on.” Steve frowned and Tony teased, “Come on, I’m only going to be ‘just looking.’”
Tony’s hands shot into the air as a sign of defeat and he yelled, “Rubber bullets! I would have never killed him!
“Natasha…How did you get that?” Tony asked, trying to sound casual but Steve could read the hidden terror in his voice. Tony’s hand began to shake so he lightly placed the coffee mug on the counter.
Satisfied that no one would interrupt them, Tony leaned into a tree and, wearing his most flirty expression, he smiled coyly at the super soldier. Tony murmured, “I’ve been thinking…”
“Don’ cry, Papa,” Peter gasped, pulling at his shirt. His voice sounded on the verge of tears as he watched Steve crumbled before him. “Uncle Tony will come back…”
Natasha directed Thor to take James to her room and, surprisingly, her teammates did not kick up any kind of fuss. Maybe they were too tired to object or maybe they felt less worried about James since he broke through some of his brainwashing. Either way, he was not going back to that room that was no bigger than a closet.
Steve sighed again. What about Bucky indeed? Steve stated, “Auntie Nat is right. It’s their business. I wouldn’t want anyone to butt in my relationship with Uncle Tony so it would not be fair to do the same to them.”
“I won’t,” Steve promised. His emotions were turbulent with this new knowledge about Natasha and imagining himself in her shoes.
With that, Wade went to the glass doors leading outside, leaving Steve and Tony behind without another word. Tony and Steve exchanged bewildered glances. Tony crossed his arms and demanded, “Friday?”
He felt nauseous, like he was going to vomit his very organs. He couldn’t remember the last time he felt this sick. In the dream world, he usually only felt things he conjured up things for, like if he wanted to feel the heat of Tony’s skin, his memory would fashion together something for him.
Peter almost did not notice his next guest, as Bucky entered silently and stood off to the side. It was only when Steve called out a greeting to his friend did Peter’s head snap in the direction of his newest uncle.
is done and I can finally consentrate on this fic alone! BUT I probably won't be posting anything new until after New Years because my life will be filled with holiday nonsense! After that, I will start posting new chapters weekly!
Steve thought of Peter having to watch as Venom ate Steve and attack the rest of their family and whispered, “I hope not.”
Steve and Tony parted with nervous chuckles and Clint dropped his hand. Thor stared incredulously at Clint as Steve looked to the rest of the team bashfully. They were all watching them with various levels of amusement.
Ben’s eyes looked like they were about to pop out of his head. He swore, “My God. Mary, is it really you?”
Tony’s heart felt like it was being crushed in its anticipation of seeing the sole reason for its existence.
“So let’s dive in…Do you know about lube or any of the basics of sex between men?” Tony asked as he popped open the bottle.
He took a deep breath, and told himself, “I’m going to go Hercules on Hydra’s ass and make sure its not going to grow back anymore of those damn heads.”
Tony had limited their intimacy in order for Steve to heal faster but his super solider was definitely more than a little sassy today, maybe he was alright to receive more friendly attentions.
Natasha mirrored his smirk and replied, “Exactly.” She leaned in and whispered, “Tony is Tony. He’s made a lot of stupid decisions in his life and he makes the stupid decision to not go for you…well then he’s just not worth it.”
Once everyone was eating and the food was all cooked, did Steve finally let himself try out Bucky’s hangover remedy. He poured himself a cup of coffee and then cracked an egg on its rim.
“Love you too, Steve,” Tony murmured in thanks to his absent husband. He grabbed the aspirin and the water bottle first and quickly swallowed a few pills with a quick swig. He dressed quickly and wondered how long he had been asleep. He felt refreshed and wondered if he missed anything.
All Steve knew about Cable was his name and it was his device that could move them through time but, at that moment, he wanted to hug him tightly and with as much feeling as he would Bucky or Tony.
“What happened?” May asked sharply, fear already eroding its way into her voice. She sat down heavily on the larger couch and gasped, “Where’s Peter?!”
“What are we going to do? Forget story of the month, I’d be story of the year,” Peter groaned. He could already see the gossip rags bringing up the stupid clone thing again.
“I’m alive,” Tony assured him, pushing himself into a sitting position with a groan. He clutched his chest and moaned, “I feel dead but I think I’m alive…everything hurts too much for it to not be real…right?”
With a shaking voice, Tony said, “You’re in the future, Cap…” He met Steve’s eyes and was momentarily stunned by the emotion within before he continued, “You can stop pinching me and start kissing me you jerk.”
Steve stared at him with an unreadable expression as he absorbed Tony’s statement and then he stated, “It’s mine. Isn’t it?”
“Bucky’s right,” Steve commented. “But we can’t give up. We are thinking along the right lines…The flowers made an impact. Maybe we should keep up with that line of thinking?”
“I want to make you dirty,” Tony whispered, nuzzling the parting between Steve’s shirt and jeans with the lower half of his face.
“Tony?” Pepper asked, worry lacing her voice. Tony looked up and met his friend’s concerned gaze. Her eyes snapped between Steve and Tony with her unease mounting. She pulled Tony from Steve’s side and whispered, “Is everything alright?”
Steve would be a great father and he could already picture him smiling warmly at the little boy there were to adopt.
Natasha ignored the pain in her hand and ripped the gun out of James’s lax grip and pointed it at the monster that was his master. Using monster as a descriptor was perfect for the man, and not just for the horrors he put James through, but also because of his appearance. He had no face – no skin. His head was just a skull, a blood red skull that was grinning manically at them.
- my friend. It was his name I connected to Stepan.” He grasped her hand and whispered, “They called me ‘James.’ My name is James.”
The same day Steve and Tony shared lunch, he read off a statement to the press later that day, explaining an abbreviated version of what happened. Coulson came to the Tower and went over the events with Steve. Together, they concluded what to release.
After days of beatings, Steve felt like every breath he took was coated in blood and the fresh, cold air only made his throat more raw. He only ate a few bites a day and most of the water he drank when Schmidt tried to suffocate him under it. They rarely let him sleep and the only reprieve was when he fell unconscious.
“You?” Steve scoffed. Hulk might be able to pin Venom but Tony?? Venom was attentively paying attention and, in the back of Steve’s head, he felt the symbiote ready to spring into his mind and take control in an instant.
Peter was laying on the couch in his aunt and uncle’s apartment. His eyes were focused on the television but he was not following the story. Harry was over yesterday and Peter had felt a little like his old self but today he felt subdued. The excitement of seeing his friend had drained him and he was feeling melancholy again.
Tony couldn’t believe it. He’d obviously cracked from the pressure of losing his soulmate but he scrambled to his feet either way and ran past Pepper.
"I recently transferred over," Tony replied with a shrug. "I even got myself somewhat groomed last night so I probably look vastly different too." Tony rubbed his bare chin and grinned at Steve.
Glancing Peter’s automated suit and then pointedly to Tony’s, Steve ironically replied to his fiance, “I think he’ll take after you in other respects too…”
"You don't do that anymore," Steve argued. "You are in a stable relationship and, for the most part, have given up on drinking..."
Steve flinched and turned to see Natasha standing at the elevator with her arms crossed over her chest. Her face was unreadable but her eyes were trained on Bucky.
Norman assisted Hydra and initially did so to learn as much as he could in the hopes to reproduce whatever they learned. At first, the experiments were dismal failures. The Super Soldier’s samples led them nowhere and ended up killing their test subjects…until they decided to go the old fashion route and produce the Super Soldiers via Steve Rogers’ sperm and an unfertilized egg.
He walked over to the elevator and Tony followed him. Steve tensed until Tony held out his uniform’s gloves. Steve took them, making sure to not touch Tony, and murmured, “Thanks.”
“Sir, yes, sir,” Tony’s voice rumbled and they stood so close that Steve could feel the vibrations against his skin. Steve met him halfway, his eyes closing as he did. Tony inhaled sharply before their lips touched and Steve felt the air rush past his lips before touching Tony’s.
Bucky continued to lean into him until the scientists announced the machine was ready. Bucky got to his feet and their teammates all came forward with an encouraging word accompanied with a hug or arm clasp.
“J, what happened to my tower?” Tony demanded. Outside, the neighboring skyscrapers seemed to functioning fine.
“What is that glow?” Howard asked breathlessly, staring at the arc reactor. The reactor was barely discernible thanks to the stealth flaps around it being partially closed.
When the bullets stopped Steve cautiously peeked out from behind his shield and darkly wondered what sort of villain stalked his grave, waiting to kill him again.
The room trembled and shocked screams and gasps echoed down the hall. Tony ignored it all and watched his boyfriend.
Wade replied with a myriad of random emojis and Peter laughed. His heart, meanwhile, felt light and airy. He hadn’t felt this happy in a long time and he couldn’t help but reflect on that as he watched Wade’s texts come in with a warm smile.
Peter stood next to him and peered curiously at Steve. He stood a few centimeters above the arm height of the couch. His mind flashed back to when Peter first came to the Tower. All those months ago he barely reached that height.
He walked the rest of the way to his office and opened the door without pause. Pepper followed him inside, watching him with an assessing eye.
Tony grinned and said, “We are definitely dating. No, we are super dating. No, we are super-duper dating! You are my boyfriend and don’t you dare let a bullet scare you! So give me that devouring look again and kiss me!”
“Like what?? Put in a request?? It can take weeks and they can just deny it like they’ve been doing for my requests for my father’s work! No, the direct approach will work best!” Tony retorted and turned to the elevator to get his suit.
His cock twitched and he had to fight back the urge to rut. Pleasure rushed through his body and Steve groaned, “Oh yes, yes you should.”
Gwen and Harry were the only people he would have wanted to spend his birthday with, with the exception of his Aunt May, but he knew that would not be happening anytime soon.
Peter was so tired he barely remembered Wade crawling into the bed beside him nonetheless removing any clothing. Peter had kicked off his jeans so his bare legs were tangling with Wade’s equally bare legs...
“It won’t big guy,” Tony promised. He pulled his phone out of his pocket and promised, “I’m drawing out the big guns right now. Tyler won’t know what hit her.”
Wade jammed his arm into Venom’s jaws to keep it from biting Peter and he pulled at it with all of his strength to get the monster off of his baby boy.
Steve slipped on his clothes and then rolled up his sleeping bag. He stuffed it into his rucksack and then slung it over his shoulder as he slipped out of his tent.
“Where?” Hawkeye asked. “SHIELD is clearly down. Whoever did that must have been tough. They must have purposely drawn us out here to not just take Steve but separate us from SHIELD. I have a feeling we’re wanted vigilantes right now.”
They were both sitting where they fell and Dr. Calvin calmly replied, “There is no stopping Peter’s evolution.”
Tony waited for them to disappear into the building then he allowed himself to look back to Steve. The Super Soldier did not notice the others absence. His eyes were closed and he looked so relaxed he might have been sleeping.
“I was going to call Harry to have his chauffeur pick me up then Harry could have shown me where she was!” Peter retorted bitterly. Steve blinked in surprise. Peter had actually thought it out. His son was too smart for his own good. As if he heard his thoughts, Peter mumbled, “Aunt Tasha trained me to be smart about missions. I wasn’t going in without a plan.”
They had an easy cadence with each other and, strangely enough, Tony found himself reflecting over it as he worked. It's not like he had never thought this much about a person before. It'd been a while, sure… It was probably because he worshipped this man as his hero but now Steve was just…more. There were elements to Steve Tony could have never imagined before meeting and getting to know him. He was funny and nice and when he looked at Tony…Tony just felt special.
She raised her hand to her communicator and gasped, “Stark, we need you here now. I am the only able body and Schmidt has his strings back on James. He’s going to break at any moment.”
His eyes shot back to Clint and he saw the archer was on the verge of a panic attack. Steve saw the photo too and he got to his feet, reassuring their friend, “We’ll get her, Clint.”
Bruce was making a sandwich for lunch. He looked up when they entered then looked quickly down with a slight blush.
She waved to the broken shards on the floor and Bucky automatically obediently knelt and started to pick it up with his bare hand.
“Jarvis, am I sober enough for you to unlock my tools?” Tony asked, his fingers itching to build the precursors to his imagined inventions. He certainly felt sober enough but it was up to his AI and his scans to determine the truth of the matter. He could almost feel as Jarvis’s invisible scans raked his body and everything was scrutinized from the way he held himself to the beat of his heartbeat. Most importantly, he did not move and breathed evenly to make it easier for the vents to isolate his breath from the other air particles as it measured his sobriety levels.
Steve twitched at the stove and Tony could almost see Steve’s indecision coming off him in waves. Eventually, Steve looked over his shoulder and smiled at Tony.
“As your leader I command you to retreat!” Steve yelled to everyone. His friends looked to Steve with torn expressions. Tony froze and looked at him as if he had maliciously shot him point blank. “Follow my last command and protect Peter.
liked it when he was “cliché”. It had become a strange kink of his. But that was what their lives had turned into and Steve wouldn’t change it for the world.
It would be 16 years, 10 months, 12 days, 6 hours, 5 minutes, and 14 seconds until he met his soulmate.
Events from the Winter Solider are ahead! But lots of canon divergence as I play with timelines, plot, and the boys' emotions! :)
Peter closed his eyes and mentally went through all the tests he and Eddie were going to go through with their new sample. He eventually supplied, “Later, I don’t have an exact time yet.”
Tony looked away from the onlookers and crooked an eyebrow at Steve. He sarcastically stated, “I’m Tony Stark. Of course people noticed this.
“Yeah?” Tony leaned on his hand, scooting himself a little closer to Steve across the table. “I’ve got Bucky Barnes’ approval to date his Stevie? Today must be lucky day to get that and to have accomplished my
Peter’s gaze turned inward and he whispered, “I always could do it…even when I was with the mean people.”
Tony bought them a bunch of tokens and then they were off. He showed Steve the simplicity of the machines and they were playing in no time. They hopped around the arcade, sometimes playing together to beat the boss, or beside each other on single player games, or against each other, shouting taunts at the other as they played. They had so many tickets in the end that they could’ve gotten anything. They paused by the prizes and both of them zeroed in one item in particular and then looked at each other.
But he could clearly remember the tiny gasp Steve made as his lips brushed against Tony's mouth when they nearly kissed. And the way Steve’s hips unconsciously pressed into Tony’s when Tony moved beneath him. And the way Steve’s flush made his eyes look more defined and blue and made Tony not want to look away but sink into those blue depths.
Ever since he woke, he had been worrying over his future and what he was going to do. His main problem was his identity and being so renowned.
shield. This person had CAP’s Shield. Anger was beginning to boil in his stomach. Were they planning to sell it on the black market?
The reactor was a shell of its former self. Cable totally took it apart and the many pieces were strewn all over the table. So far, he fixed the shell. It was no longer crushed but back to its original shape and now he seemed to be fixing the internal pieces that had been crushed as well. It was encouraging to see but Steve wouldn’t feel too optimistic until it was totally fixed and back where Tony could use it.
“I can’t wait until that is true,” Steve murmured, lightly caressing the side of Tony’s arm. Tony relented to the blow jobs but he would not make love with Steve until he knew he was totally healed. Steve could not wait to take Tony in his arms and show him how much he really loved him.
In the past, the changes to the future all factored on whether Tony intervened and tried to save Steve and Bucky’s lives.
Tony leaned back in order to capture all of Steve in the photo and his boyfriend both blushed and puffed out his chest making Tony smirk. He sultrily teased, “Never, Steve.”
Coulson told them they were going to an undisclosed location to meet up with Fury. He took them to a transport jet and they left within the minute of boarding. Coulson sat at the front of the jet with the pilot, leaving Steve and Tony alone.
He kicked off his shoes and fell face first into his mattress. Everything that had been weighing him down seemed to press him even deeper into the bed. Steve sighed heavily and closed his eyes.
Steve peered sadly at his husband and smiled lightly. He whispered, “Yes…and you haven’t even seen the video of Peter fighting back against Venom!”
When New York was on the horizon, one crewmate grabbed him and brought him to the bow of the ship. The Statue of Liberty was still standing proudly before the city, welcoming all the travelers to her shores. Steve smiled at her like an old friend. At least one thing hadn’t changed. The cityscape, however, had grown up into the sky. In his day the largest building in the world was the Empire State building but now it was dwarfed by the tall, glass behemoths that surrounded it.
“I don’t know,” Happy gasped, his fingers white on the steering wheel. “It felt like one of the front wheels caught on something…”
“And it is good to have you back, sir. You have been missing for over a week. A SHIELD company has been guarding the time machine, waiting for your return.”
Natasha was already backing up but was running away as James turned to her. Her worst fears were confirmed. She saw only black in his eyes. Her James was nowhere to be seen.
As if reading his thoughts, Tony quickly continued, “I made the ten floors beneath my penthouse, private living courters. Bruce has already claimed one floor for himself, as did everyone else in the Avengers, so I figure, why not you? You’re welcome to go back to D.C. though, I just thought – it would be easier to get to know you, you know? We’re soulmates. It’s something we can’t ignore and, well, I don’t rub people the right way. I’ve always been told I’m hard to love, so yeah, that’s not a good selling point…Free room and board?” He dryly joked with a nervous edge.
In the end, he decided to work on the suit as he knew he could make progress with it. However, he did let Jarvis do some more digging, in the hopes that the AI would find something, anything on the mystery man.
The judge nodded and continued, “Very well, if the prosecution presents valid evidence then the trial will go on and you will have the right to request a trial by judge or jury.”
Tony tightened his hold on him and promised, “You are not going to lose me, whatever happens, I will be there for you.”
“No,” she whispered, looking at him with pity. She lightly rubbed his arm and murmured, “One of the interns took some pictures of you while you were working in the lab and sold it to US Weekly.” Peter’s shoulders drooped and Pepper continued, “We let the young man go but the others are being briefed on proper decorum and being reminded of their confidentiality agreements in lieu of working today.”
Steve lightly ran his hand over Tony’s arm and smiled to himself as he imagined such a life with Tony. They had yet to have a chance to really sit down and talk about the future but seeing Tony at his side and still sharing his bed years from now sounded…perfect.
He heard someone scream and then another person swear further away and then he was surrounded by worried voices. Peter’s mind was spinning from the impact but the voices drew him out of the tornado of confusion in his consciousness. May lived on a busy street and the violence of his impact drew them all to him.
Pepper would have been the first person he’d gush to about all of this. She was his unofficial gusher and, as the day progressed, he really missed her. She’d listen to his inanity and, sure, she may berate him for the jeopardy and risk to the future…but, once she had vented all the obvious wrongs, he could see her admitting to being happy for him…She knew firsthand how lonely Tony was…
“You are crazy about him. There’s no way you can fake it. You’re going to fall for him and when it ends you’re going to come crawling back to me again and I’m going to have to mend the pieces.”
Peter cupped Wade’s sharp jaw and carefully extracted his mouth from Wade’s, nipping at his lips as he pulled away.
When Tony was returning to his seat and Steve took his place in the witness box, they reached out to each other and their fingertips brushed in passing. A shadow of Tony’s touch remained on his skin and Steve clenched his fist as if to hold the invisible hand that was there.
Wade and Steve sat on either side of Peter and, as they scooted their chairs in, May carried over the two platters of toast and scrambled eggs she made. It was a smaller breakfast than what Peter had been eating at the Tower, both he and Steve needed to eat more to fed their high metabolisms and Aunt May was still none the wiser to this fact. They all praised her for her cooking either way and split the portions equally between the four of them.
Tony could tell Steve was depressed. He wanted to enfold Steve in his arms and shield him from all the things in the world that were hurting him…Yet, no matter how much money he had or what he could build with all of his genius, he could not protect Steve.
“I think I always knew since I was a child,” Steve replied. “I didn’t act on it obviously. It was considered shameful back then…but I accepted it. It was a hard pill to swallow but I shouldered it. I treated it like a burden. I didn’t want it to be a part of me anymore than I had wanted any of my other ailments…When I woke in this century, I didn’t know how far the Gay Right’s Movement had come until New York’s Pride Parade. It was all over the news and…and I just sat down and... and cried…I was
Peter forced his grip to relax and, as he watched the flames die down, his heartbeat began to pound loudly in his eardrums. He could hear his uncle’s communicator as it buzzed loudly but indiscriminately with the rest of his family’s voices. Their voices were loud and frantic.
“I am ready,” Peter reassured him, running his hands along his chest, his fingers were tracing the dips between his pecs and just above his abs and it was very distracting. Peter continued, “I know I am, it's just…with Venom on, I was all caught up in the moment with all this adrenaline but now…I just don't want to disappoint you. I've never slept with another man before and –.”
To everyone’s surprise, the imposter suddenly stated something in Russian. Natasha hit him over the back of the head and demanded, “Who are you?”
“What are we going to do now?” Tony gasped into his flesh. Steve knew he was not asking how else they would try to separate Peter and Venom.
Tony overheard Dum Dum exclaim loudly on the other end, but then he lowered his voice and Bucky’s eyes became a little glassy. The Winter Soldier sat down at the counter and mumbled, “It’s a long story, Dum Dum…it’s…it’s good to hear your voice…”
The implant was attached to the largest vein in his arm and the blood acted as a sort of bloody hydronic system to power the implant. He must have completely destroyed the vein and would bleed out in minutes.
Peter reached out to grab Steve’s dog-tags, forgetting he was in Tony’s arms, and found only Tony’s reactor. He did not grab the dog-tag still hanging on his wrist but clamped onto the reactor through the fabric of Tony’s shirt. Peter murmured, “Wha’s happening?”
“I still can’t believe you’re here,” Tony whispered. His eyes were riveted on Steve’s face. The other day, he thought Steve was dead but now here he was alive. He was half afraid to close his eyes and find out this all had been a dream.
Bucky’s head swiveled in his direction as soon as he burst into his bedroom and was already on his feet with a Glock in hand as soon as Tony reached the balcony.
“Then we’ll just have to find a way to get Venom in there and then find a way to separate it from Peter,” Steve stated, his mind already calculating what would need to be done.
With Jarvis offline and none of his friends knowing the situation he was in…it was all just – futile.
When Tony reappeared he was still attached to the battery. Steve’s eyes zeroed on it immediately and Tony gruffly explained, “This thing is keeping me alive. I guess I’m stuck with it here too…it’s really unsexy.”
The subject of their son could not be avoided and Tony was the first to ask, “Do you think he is aware of what is happening?”
“Tony, this is how normal people behave!” Steve heard Pepper yell in the background, her voice was layered in obvious frustration.
Tony’s body skidded several feet then came to a rolling stop. He lay there unmoving and Steve felt his entire body tremble with trepidation.
“Maybe they got nothing,” Steve murmured, lightly caressing his arm. “Maybe, because the power was out, they could not get what they were looking for.”
“You found another love,” she whispered, hovering over them. Too close. If she touched Peter…he wound his arms around Peter, trying to protect him.
His mind stopped functioning past the fact that Tony was gone. Anything else, including how he was supposed to function in this new world without his fiancé, he couldn’t envision.
That night they held each other closely and it would have taken the combined strength of all the Avengers to tear them apart.
Peter let his friend sort the information out for a couple of days before sending him a text to see if he wanted to hang out. After a couple minutes, Harry texted back and said he would be there within the hour.
“Yeah, not going to happen,” Tony murmured and dropped down, evading the sudden burst of neon red that exploded from the weapon.
“Nah…I’m up now and I…” Tony’s gaze flickered to him for barely a second and then he murmured, “I doubt I can go back to sleep now anyways…”
“…Jarvis says he is fine,” Tony stated after a moment’s hesitation, most likely from speaking to his AI.
Tony jerked to a halt midstride and turned to Steve by twisting his entire body in a swift snap toward Steve. But Tony had no time to react to seeing him as Steve had run into him and knocked him over just as he faced him.
“There was no way in Hell I was going to miss Peter’s birthday,” Bucky said with a grin. His grin fell and he chewed on his lip nervously. He asked, “Wh-where should I put this?” He held up a square box wrapped in newspaper.
Ever since they’d learned of this alternative future, Bucky had been in full-on protector mode. He shadowed Steve with an unhappy frown and watched him like he was about to combust. Even now, he was looking at Steve like he might be struck down at any moment.
Peter led them deeper into the house and it changed from a family home to an active facility. He took them to a locker room and Steve asked, “Is this our home or a command center?”
“It’s nothing,” Tony replied and knelt back down over the engine to avoid any more questions. He put his hands back on the pipes, but he didn’t do anything more than fiddle. Without looking at her, he asked, “What are you doing here?”
Tony undid the inner button to his slacks then slowly slid the zipper down. As Tony did this, he dragged his free middle and ring finger down the ever expanding opening of Steve's zipper running his fingers down the curvature of Steve’s cock. Steve fisted the sheets underneath him and bit down on his lip. Tony’s touch scorched him through the thin fabric of his boxer briefs and whereas Steve was shaking Tony’s touch was sure and steady.
with his mate. The Red Skull had aged in the years since the war, it was slower than a normal human’s but he was now older and weaker than he was in his prime.
Steve blushed under the intensity of Tony’s eyes. He quickly looked away and reclaimed his hand. When he glanced back at Tony, he saw the man grinning at him with an odd glint in his eye.
He always thought America was paving the way in technological innovation with Howard Stark backing them but it looked like the Soviet Union was going to be giving Stark a run for his money.
The space time continuum was fragile. He knew from his own experiences how easy it was to change time…what if they couldn’t save Tony?
Tony spun around to see his Aunt Peggy looking at him in question. Tony still couldn’t get over how young and beautiful she was.
Tony still hadn’t answered Steve and his super soldier was beginning to appear more concerned. This all happened because Tony decided to take Steve as his lover and save both Steve and Bucky’s lives.
His article was minimalized by Jarvis and a new window opened with Twitter’s top trending page. The first tweet he saw was of him and Steve but it was not of them making out in their swim trunks…
His lawyer nodded and moved on with the questioning, asking Steve about his original alibi and what he was doing the day of the supposed rape.
When they broke their embrace, Tony wiped at his eyes and said, “Listen, Fury seems to think Steve doesn’t have a destination in mind, but I think he’ll come here. I told him about my home in Malibu. This is the only place in the future that he knows about!”
Natasha studied him and wondered at the best way to approach this. Steve was from an era where such a thing he and Stark wanted was disallowed. He was probably trying to smother the feelings the cropped up and trying to feel disgusted toward it.
Reporters surged at the barriers the police set up and officers were on them immediately, preventing them from getting past. They were yelling out questions but he could not hear them over the clangor of the protestors. They all started to scream obscenities and other hateful words at Steve. Some even directed their hate toward Tony. Steve blocked them out the best he could and looked down to Tony for encouragement. Tony was tense but he smiled warmly at him and whispered, “Let’s go.”
When he finally saw color on the white horizon, Steve thought his mind was breaking. Yet as he got closer he recognized tents and moving figures as people. They were oddly dressed in puffy, full body orange suits, but they were people all the same.
“From the future,” Tony promptly reminded Gabe. He looked to Steve and asked, “Help me sit up. I feel useless laying down like this…”
“Sorry to break it to you, but I’m not going anywhere anytime soon,” Tony weakly teased, his thumb lightly caressing Steve’s cheek.
Steve inhaled deeply, collecting his wits, and then smiled crookedly at Tony. He teased, “Sorry, I’m just lamenting what you'll have to go through to impress this girl.”
“Anoder uncle,” he murmured with aspiration and Steve had to stifle a chuckle. Poor Peter had nearly a dozen people to call uncle and was probably having trouble keeping track.
Harry did not notice his surprise and rolled his eyes as he dragged Peter out of the bedroom. He stated, “Let’s make a deal. When I beat you, you have to go take a shower.”
Natasha was staring at Steve’s mug and Steve stopped before taking a sip when he saw her expression. All the blood had drained from her face and she finally gasped, “D-Did you say a pinch of salt?”
Tony hesitated and then walked back to Bucky’s side. He didn’t think the man was ready for the amount of physical contact that came with a hug. So he merely placed a comforting hand on Bucky’s shoulder and, to his surprise, Bucky leaned into the touch.
“You will always be my best friend,” Steve whispered. “And I will always love you but…not the way you want…”
much of his life. Tony bit down on his lips to keep them from trembling as his tremendous emotions threatened to spew out.
She sighed heavily and leaned back against the door. With her attention obviously diverted by the conversation inside, she replied, “No…”
The Red Skull had killed her mate. There was no way he was down that hall. The long lost friend had to be someone else or no one at all.
Tony crawled back up his body and playfully bit on Steve’s bottom lip. Steve carded his hands into Tony’s hair and pulled him into a deeper kiss. Steve grasped Tony's cock and jerked his into fruition. Tony moaned into Steve’s mouth and Steve pulled on the back of his head to smother his mouth more from making anymore sound.
He whispered, “Your being my soulmate changes a lot of things I…I am unable to comprehend. It’s making me question things, question my master, and the Academy.”
Peter curled over as he laughed and Wade watched it with a warm smile. Bringing joy to Peter put an ease in his heart that he didn’t know he needed until he feel in love with him. Peter’s laughter dwindled away and he cupped Wade’s face as he whispered, “As always, my prince, you are such a romantic…”
He didn’t see Tony again though Steve did read his file and he saw how much Tony looked like his father, despite the arrogant smile coupled with warm brown eyes.
Natasha sighed and said, “I won’t have you jeopardize your position in the organization. You’ve done beyond what my favor should have cost…We gave him time…hopefully it will be enough. Do your job, Clint. Consider the favor paid.”
Steve got to his feet and opened his good arm to Bucky, saying, "One more hug for your favorite punk?"
Peter’s legs were still wobbly so he put some weight on the pole and its wheels squeaked lightly as he padded over to the prone body of his dad.
It finally dawned on Steve what Ms. Potts had assumed and blood rushed to his face in embarrassment. He gasped, “I-I’m no flint! Neither of us are!”
But Peter’s closest friend came from the most unlikely of people. Tony and his business rival, Norman Osborn, were both conscripted by SHIELD to help in rebuilding the technological sector of the organization. Norman handled the weapons portion and Tony handled the rest. They had met mostly at SHIELD’s new HQ but a few times they had met at their respective towers. It was during one of those meetings when Norman once brought his son, Harry. Tony had grumbled about it at first. Norman was not a family man and had only brought his son over in the hopes of hooking Peter. Harry was innocent to his schemes and when the boys met they instantly connected. The boy was Peter’s age and had nearly as large a heart as Peter did. Steve was happy for his son and knew their friendship would last a long time.
Tony coughed as the air quickly grew thick with smoke and he warily lifted his head to see if his assailant had survived.
Tony grew quiet as he sat in the vehicle. He buckled Peter into his car seat and the toddler fell back sleep in seconds. As Steve came in Tony offered him his hand and helped guide him to his seat.
Steve continued, leaning forward in Tony’s hold, “With him out of power, Hydra will crumble. We’ll get SHIELD back on its feet and right the world. If you kill him though he’ll be a martyr for Hydra…”
Steve didn’t need any more permission and dug in. He ate one slice of plain toast first, nearly swallowing it whole and then more reverently took a sip of the coffee. It felt so good to finally get something in his stomach.
Tony could figuratively feel the ugly festering and clogging up his throat. He didn’t want to fight with Steve. He loved this man with his
The conversation ultimately steered straight to Zola again and they talked freely about it with no fear of anyone overhearing their plans. They camped just far enough away from the main body of the 107
Tony’s hands lowered and latched onto Steve’s trousers on either side of his hips and then slid along the seam to meet in the middle where he unfastened them. Steve reached down and did the same to Tony, his fingers shaking slightly. They divulged each other of the last of their clothing and finally they were both naked.
Steve smiled happily at his friend, lover, and the man who was mutually in love with and caressed the side of Tony’s face. Gazing into his warm eyes, Steve whispered, “And I love you, Tony.”
He was then given a blanket and headphones. After watching the passenger in front of him, he realized the headphones plugged into the glowing box in front of him and, with absolute fascination, Steve scrolled through the easy to navigate screen. He found a movie about Captain America. The cover was of a blond man in his uniform, clutching what must have been the woman playing Peggy close to his chest.
Dad paused, waiting for Peter to reply but Peter was too angry to do so. He heard Dad’s face shield snap shut and moments later his repulsors hummed to life and he took off via the window.
Steve smiled sadly upon his explanation. Despite Tony’s hurt, he still took the time to make sure they were cared for. That need to take care of others… it was one of Tony’s best qualities.
“What could he hope to accomplish by shooting at nothing then?” Steve murmured unhappily. “He must have misjudged the density of the glass or shot too soon…”
He immediately returned the embrace and pressed his face into Howard’s shoulder. The old familiar smell of his father’s cologne filled his nose and it brought several childhood memories to the surface of his mind. That smell was what broke the dam and let a few tears through Tony's tightly shut eyes.
Tony unconsciously pushed himself closer into Steve and Steve’s eyes heated as he got a little emotional. If he had never been frozen he would have probably lived out the rest of his life in a lie. He would have never dated another man and would have died old and alone.
Because most girls talked about Eastern European politics and debate the throwing accuracy of the bar’s ice pick.
His eyes focused on the black spider emblem on his chest where the black webs expanded across his body. The black represented Venom and it was a reminder of why he was doing this.
They broke apart with guilty smiles but both slyly glanced at each other from the corners of their eyes. Pepper and Coulson went over the particulars to the event itself and Tony did not hear much of the details as Steve had dropped his hand between them and Tony did the same. Steve carefully reached out to him and threaded his fingers through Tony’s.
Eddie had laid still in the soft guest bed as the alarms blared the night prior. He knew it was because of Venom. He didn’t get up and no one came to check on him. He just lay there until it stopped and then closed his eyes and fell back asleep with a heavy, conflicted heart.
Tony did just that. He got off his chair and joined Steve on his, partially sitting on his lap as he wound his arms around him. Steve wound his arms around his soulmate and pressed his face into Tony’s chest.
Bucky ushered the Commandos together and called Dum Dum inside so he’d only have to explain this once. As he began the near incredulous tale, he couldn’t help but note the couple awkwardly pull apart. Now that death was no longer threatening to take Tony, they had to separate again. They could be friendly but nothing more. Bucky had to look elsewhere because the heartache radiating off of both men was too painful to watch.
“I need to go back to sleep!” Tony gasped, pulling open one of the drawers in the expansive bathroom. His sleeping pills rolled toward him, loudly clinking within the bottle. He’d used them only a few times, when he thought he was dying and he wanted to spend more time with Steve.
The room was large with not much in it other than a few tables and machines she could not name. But, the centerpiece was the chair that Steve had sat in. It was empty and James circled it like it was something that could attack them at any moment.
Tony looked even more worried now and Peter realized he had stopped eating and turned his head to the front of the house to hear the reporters better. He was starting to feel queasy and murmured, “I don’t think I can eat anymore.”
Steve was thrust violently into the dreamscape as he had been before and he immediately expected the worst.
“That sounds dangerous,” Steve stated, staring levelly at his soulmate from across the counter space between them.
“This. This notebook,” Steve whispered, like speaking any louder would make it burst into flames. “Tony only went to France to the time machine because of what was in this book.”
Tony’s fridge and pantry were a little sparse so Steve was still hungry even after eating all of the food provided. He bashfully followed Tony to the elevator and flushed as he paid for the food. He muttered, “I’m sorry, you didn’t have to…”
“I…” Peter paused and he looked at Wade’s shoulder. His gaze became far off as he sank internally into his own thoughts. He tightened his fingers on Wade’s biceps and he whispered, “I haven’t felt this way in years…”
! The State sees me as his sole guardian! Can you imagine all the legalities we are going to go through to bring you back to life and be his guardian
His pops’ grip on him lessened then he drew Peter into a hug. For a moment, Peter almost pushed himself out of his pops’ hold but he stopped himself when he felt his pops’ tears.
Knowing that someone like, Captain America, didn’t believe he would find love was like saying fairy tales didn’t get happy endings. It just wasn’t right. He was a symbol of the American Dream - of hope for the future - and he should be able to
His reactions to these recent dreams always created more dramatic responses than that of his nightmares. He was loathe to admit it but his heart was racing, his cock was throbbing, and his arms felt irrevocably empty.
Steve took what remained of the cushion out of Peter’s grasp and picked him up. He murmured, “Let’s meet Papa’s friends, okay?”
Natasha pulled out the stool next to him and sat on it. She stabbed a few leaves violently, drawing Steve’s attention.
Tony nuzzled his face affectionately into Steve’s scalp. His hair was still damp from his run and he loved the smell of his sweat.
Clint stopped when Peter ripped upholstered side cushion from the couch. The cloth ripped and the metal frame whined for just a second then the room became totally silent.
…Did that do it? Was letting Steve walk out of his life all he needed to do? Was J, the suit, and the future going to be back to normal?
They were going to be hunkering down at the location until Colonel Phillips and the rest of the 107th grouped up with them. Currently, only one-third of the 107th was at the base with Steve and the rest of the Commandos. The smaller unit was more mobile but still had more than enough men for Steve to make the quick attack they needed to take down the base.
Steve ripped himself from Tony’s hold and barreled straight into the fight. Steve grabbed one of Hulk’s fists, his arm was nearly the same size as Steve, and yelled,” HULK! Hulk stop! That thing is Peter! Peter’s in there! You could hurt him! HULK!”
Bucky shook off Thor’s hand and muttered, “Forget about it.” He strode over to Peter and knelt in front of him. He stated, “I am sorry about messing up your party.”
“Stepan may be younger but he is quicker on his feet,” Bucky rationalized. “And he can speak Russian which is the language of my safe word.”
“Can you get a visual on his face?” Tony asked. If Tony saw his eyes then he would know who was in control.
When he was finally able to rein in his tears, he rubbed furiously at his face to wipe off the excess evidence but he could do nothing about his red eyes or the misery that threatened to overcome him again. He could not wipe away his despair as easily as he wiped away his tears. He cleared his nose with several loud sniffles and finally got back to work with a heavy heart.
Steve leapt from the quinjet and started running as soon as his feet touched the ground. He could feel Natasha’s disapproving glare stabbing itself into his back and tried not to think what must be going through his friends’ minds….No, his central focus was Peter. No matter what, he will save his son.
Tony turned on the coffee machine and asked Steve, “What are you going to do about the cyborg on the couch?”
“Don’t charge in, you might scare your bunk mates!” Jim teased, making fun of Tony’s reckless rush into Hydra fire.
Bucky slowly got up as Pepper opened the box. The first item she pulled out was a plain t-shirt and she held it up to Bucky’s chest to make sure it’d fit. She mumbled, “It’ll do…Jarvis, send me his measurements and I’ll go shopping tomorrow after work.”
He got his wife pregnant at the same time and planned to use the baby born as a comparison to the gamma-radiated babies. Maybe even test future serums on his child as well…
“Damnnit Sam, that was not funny. You almost gave me a heart attack,” Tony gasped from across the room. Steve looked to him and saw Tony and the others had pooled out of the kitchen. They all were looking above Steve’s head so he followed their gazes.
“Tony Stark,” Steve said. He told the father about the time traveling but didn’t bring up their relationship. He knew Tony said it was acceptable in this era, but Steve still wasn’t used to sharing the information, especially with strangers. He asked, “When I mentioned him, you knew exactly who I was talking about. Is he famous in this era?”
Who was he kidding? Tony liked kissing Steve. He probably would have been fine hooking up with him. But anything more than that…
“You texted me, saying you needed to change the date to hook up the reactor to the city grid. How long of a delay are we going to have?”
“You are and it’s adorable,” Tony said, winding an arm around Steve’s waist. “I think I’ll just call you that from now on,
. The shocking events that followed seemed to have made their lives fast-forward. Steve looked back to his boyfriend but suddenly couldn't remember what it was like without him in his life. Time may have slipped by but their relationship had solidified in the meantime. Steve could barely remember feeling embarrassed about holding his hand when they first started "dating." It was natural as breathing now.
Tony opened one eye and peeked at the super soldier, he was blushing. Tony replied, “They even made a movie out of it.”
“I thought it was serious until I rem…” Bucky trailed off and murmured the last word so quietly he barely heard it, “Remembered.”
He looked back to the pancakes he was making and Tony stared at his back at a loss. This was too…normal.
“We have to go in all the same,” Steve stated, the terrified images of Laura and the children flashed through his mind.
Tony was wearing a faraway expression and it took him a moment to reply, “Yeah, okay, let’s go.” He picked up his obsolete gun and led the way to where the rest of the team was waiting for them. Steve followed and stared at the back of Tony’s head, thinking about how great he felt against Steve.
Steve chuckled and helped him remove his shirt and then he helped Tony out of his own. Once they were both bare chested, they irrevocably were drawn back to each other. Tony wrapped his arms behind Steve’s head and drew him into a giggling kiss. They only broke apart once the elevator reached its destination.
How was his heart still beating? The knife seemed to twist deeper every time Steve uttered the word “love.”
Steve’s weight became less noticeable with that statement and Tony wound his arms around Steve, his hands interlocking in the center of Steve’s back, and whispered, “Please, don’t.”
His original implant had been destroyed when he lost his left arm but his master had graciously given him one for his right arm. In the Soldier’s mind, it was not something that belonged to him but another tool given to him by his master. It was all to help him in his undercover missions. Those who didn’t have soul implants stood out as being different.
Steve silently slipped out of the bed and, after putting on some pants, he tried to keep quiet as he picked up the penthouse.
They came up to a small pond that must have been freezing and Steve stated, “You can start taking your baths in my room like the first time…I wouldn’t mind.”
Steve reached out to him without another thought. He helped Tony to his feet and then wound an arm around him to help him walk. Tony’s warmth seeped into his side, calming Steve further.
He'd been worried how lunch would go, but, with Natasha and Bucky there,  attentions were divided. Even though they sat next to each other Tony and Wade were cordial. They even shared small talk which practically blew Peter's mind. Both Wade and Tony were trying and Peter felt overjoyed by it.
“I love you too,” Steve whispered, handing his shield to Tony. He finally voiced it aloud but it was during the worst possible situation.
He paused to look his hands next, smirking at the impatient huff Tony made as Steve took his time. His hands looked a million times better than when he last saw inspected. All his skin had grown back but they were still bright red and slightly swollen as if boiled. He flexed his hands experimentally. His skin was taunt and cramped when he closed his fist.
It was exactly a week until the day Tony would need the reactor to save himself when Steve was running by the house in the early evening, and something exploded within.
“So we are going to ignore the fact that you are my son and that you are going to be grievously wounded enough to have scars covering your entire chest years later?”
Tony merely laughed and handed his credit card to the vendor before placing a single order. He turned back to Steve with his eyes dancing with mischief and Steve felt himself fall for him a tad more.
“I SAID FUCK OFF!” Clint roared, pushing Bucky back again. Natasha struggled against Steve’s grip and was snarling at Bucky.
They walked in silence, traversing their own path through the thicket and over rocks and roots. When the sound of camp was just a distant murmur, Steve bumped into Tony's side.
“I am my own master now and I want my freedom,” the Soldier stated, getting to his feet. His height forced her to look up but she kept her strong stance.
! And Jarvis is gone by now so we’ll have no way of knowing what you just did to the future! I can still die but you could’ve damned yourself, Steve!
“HQ has been breached. All our high security prisoners have escaped, we need the team to help our agents round these people up. There are a lot of powered ones,” Coulson announced over the speaker.
Tony looked to his husband and Steve met his gaze with worried eyes. Tony gave his bicep a little squeeze and then tried to smile encouragingly at him.
Peter sat up slowly, careful to not wake Wade. His boyfriend didn't stir and Peter smiled down at him.
“This boy is extraordinary,” Loki murmured. “He has the powers of two, maybe even three Avengers rolled into one.”
He and Tony had not exchanged a word since they parted in the elevator. He was giving Tony his space and he prayed Tony would be willing to forgive him when he returned. Yet, because of his silence, Steve had no idea what Tony was feeling.
They kept it PG-13 and the only action below the waist was by rubbing their hips into each other. Okay…Tony’s hands may have crept down a few times to squeeze Steve’s ass but –
“We’ll never have to separate again,” Steve whispered in a promise, squeezing his hand back, his eyes glossy with emotion as they returned to Tony's gaze.
Steve’s heart was full of love and he would be happy to lay there all day with Tony in his arms. But when the water began to lose its warm edge both men sat up with unhappy groans and did a quick clean up, washing away the remains of their love making and whatever was left of the gritty remains of their prior battles.
Natasha nudged James and said, “Maybe Steve should be the one to let the team know the package is secured.”
Steve grinned when Peter did not use the simple syllable utterance of “Papa.” Peter never before could call him “Pops.” Steve hugged him tightly and affectionately murmured, “Stop growing up.”
Wade’s lips quirked into a small smile and he turned his head to whisper in Peter’s ear, “I love you too, baby boy, now and forever…”
“Har har har,” Tony fake laughed. He then grumbled, “Help me up and get me to someone who can help me with this lovely shiner. I think it’s going to need stitches. Peggy said she’d find someone to help but it’s been a while and my head is killing me…”
“We can’t do this every night…the boys will start to notice if we wait until they leave…and one of them might notice you slipping into my tent or hear us…As it is, I bet Bucky is gonna give me an earful in the morning.”
“Swear it, Stark,” she hissed. “If you hurt him, I’m going to beat you within an inch of your life. That man has been through a lot and you hurting him on top of the rape accusation will destroy him!”
“Peter…” Steve whispered, “Our son…he – he said that we told him the story of how we met except…except we never told him how our reunion ended.” Steve pointed to the notebook in Cable’s hands and said, “What if that’s it? What if we always time traveled? What if us ‘changing’ the future was what was always going to happen? What if I was always find this notebook? What if I’m always meant to complete the circle?”
“I see Mary in him,” May whispered in a broken voice. Tears were gathering in her eyes and Ben’s eyes were beginning to glisten too.
He had no chance to voice his concerns as the symbiote dug its claws into the pavement and began to drag them away again. Peter hissed as his back scrapped against the ground bearing both his and Wade’s weight. He let go of Wade and dug his fingers into the black mass, wrapped around his chest, growling, “
Taking it back to Malibu, however, was a different story entirely. SHIELD and everyone else was on high alert so he was pinged left and right and even had a LAPD helicopter fly alongside him for a little. He took the cryostasis chamber straight to his workshop but unfortunately had to knock over a few pieces of equipment to squeeze it in and finally settle it down.
Cap snickered as he placed down the lathering brush and bowl. He picked up the razor and inspected the blade to see it was sharp enough, once satisfied, he pressed it to Tony's neck and stated, “I never imagined shaving the neck of a time traveler either but here we are…and there's no need to be so formal with me, my friends call me Steve and I expect you to do the same.”
He verbally just told a reporter he was gay. In all the years he spent worrying about this, he never imagined it would have come out so easily or nonchalantly.
“I should have run, Pops,” Peter cried. “My sense was going off but I did not run. You shouldn’t have t-to do it.
Steve slid into his room and went straight to Tony. He had been laying on the bed, playing with his tablet.
Steve bit down on his lip at the sound and pumped more furiously to come faster. Tony moaned agreeably and started to rub more furiously at his shaft to come with him.
He ran his thumbs over Peter’s cheeks, brushing away the water for only a second before it started streaming down again.
Tony sat down to do some research of his own on what was going on with SHIELD and Hydra, when Bucky suddenly rushed into the room.
“In fact,” Tony added, hands pulling at Steve’s shirt. “You shouldn’t be wearing clothes right now.”
Tony should have reassured him. He should have told him that he was pretty sure he was in love with him too. He should have told him Steve was the only person who ever made Tony feel content which was a feat in itself since he was stuck in the past.
In the end, his only option left to him was to use the helpful trait he had absorbed from his host: the boy's intelligence. So Venom dug deep into the boy’s mind and he solely thought for a solution. He turned over the limited options available to him and tried to think of a new way to twist them into his favor.
“This is a small island. All us scientists knew each other, especially those of us who were going to make a difference…” Tony sighed then peered at Peter. To his son, Tony murmured, “Hey munchkin, your mom was kick-ass.”
When Peter didn’t reply, Steve straightened and closed the doors to the fridge. He looked to Peter questioningly and murmured, “Pete?”
Tony reached to the side and picked up the bottle of lubricant. He popped it open with a smirk and wiggled his eyebrows at Steve. Steve paused in kissing the area over his heart and lay his cheek over the arc reactor as he stared up at him.
Steve chuckled as his eyes locked onto the familiar sight. He’d used the north star on the little dipper’s handle countless times without a second thought. He whispered, “You’re right, there they are…You know there aren’t as many stars out in New York as there are here.”
