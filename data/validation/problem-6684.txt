"This is amazing though." Tony muttered after a peaceful moment. "Nat and Sam becoming parents! I'm so happy for them." Tony unconsciously squeezed Steve's hand. He had a soft expression on his face and a hazy smile, looking lost in happy thoughts, and Steve's heart made a leap. The idea that Tony might want kids someday lingering at the back of his mind.
Steve hesitated. Did Tony really have no clue? "They're way out of my league..." Steve mumbled self-deprecatingly. "Besides, I sill haven't presented yet."
being sandwiched by Clint and Bucky." He added with a huge smile on his face that Steve could even hear in his voice.
Tony laughs and for the first time in a long while, it's light and genuine. "Sure. But you do realize this is a very public place, right?"
Clint smiled and then his eyes turned hazy, a glimpse of lewdness in them. He licked his lip. "But you still trashed me afterwards, anyway."
Steve swallowed his cock eagerly, enjoying every inch of him that penetrated his mouth, his jaw stretched and hot with the furnace of Tony's shaft in his mouth. He sucked up and down the length until Tony's legs started shaking around him and he dropped his head into the pillows, clenching and unclenching his fists and panting heavily in the sheets.
Steve attempted to walk a few steps forward and shorten the excruciating distance between them. "I don't understand... " He said hesitantly. "What have I done?"
it. In his skin, in his bones, in his heart he can feel it. They have been at it all morning and his entire body vibrates at the thought. Felicia is sleeping and he's burning from head to toe. He locks himself in the bathroom and takes a cold shower and jerks off but it's not enough... He needs to be
The dark-haired guy chuckled again and released his neck to brush his cheek with the tip of his knuckles. He buried his head into Tony's neck and kissed him softly, earning a gasp from him, before biting his skin. Tony gasped and cringed. His eyes flared open with the sharp pain. Another rush. Another jolt of electricity. He jerked his hips forward, deeper into the other man's mouth again. He was fully hard now. The man at his feet seemed eager and licked his shaft with more enthusiasm. Tony wondered for a split-second what that guy's face looked like. If he was young or old. If he had a boyfriend. If he was doing this often or if it was a first. If he was gonna go home satisfied tonight and then start a normal day at work tomorrow as if he hadn't had Tony's cock in his mouth while Tony was busy with someone else. Then he wondered why this guy was down there, sucking his cock. When had that happened?
Tony chuckled silently, looking away. They started walking again. Hands in hands. Smiles on their faces. Both silent.
So when it came this morning—the invitation—wrapped up in a beautifully decorated envelope with three roses this time, two big and one small, Tony didn't immediately freak out. Time was right, he supposed.
Tony poked at the few things lying around on his desk, obviously knowing they were Steve's. He touched them with so much respect and delicacy that Steve felt a surge of affection overwhelming him. He kept looking silently, staring at the future boards of the Avengers—at Steve's work—with admiration and genuine curiosity and then he turned around slowly, smile soft on his lips, happiness on his face. "This is where you work, right?" He asked but it sounded more like a statement than a question. "I love this place..." He added, voice faltering a little. There was no provocation in his tone anymore. "I wish I could have seen it before the new premises, though." He said, sounding a little regretful. "The very beginning... When SHIELD was just a bunch of amateurs with creative minds and bold ideas."
Tony wriggled on his seat. The ache in his ass was still blazing. He pretended it didn't exist, Tony was used to pain anyway. Dessert arrived soon and tasted like puke and dirty cock in his mouth. Tony ate it without conviction, laughed once or twice, flashed his cutest smile and dinner finally came to an end.
"I'm serious, Buck." He said positively, leaning closer and closer to the alpha. "I'm tired of waiting. I wanna know what it's like. I wanna have sex. Why does everyone get to enjoy themselves and I'm stuck in a kid's body. That's not fair. I'm not gonna wait my college years to get my first kiss. That's so lame."
Tony didn't make any comment, however. He just shrugged indifferently and turned away, studying the task at hand. Then he wiped his hands on the back pockets of his jeans. "Alright," he said, "let's get to it, then."
"It's gonna be fine, you know?" Steve said. "You're gonna be with Tony this time. He will take good care of you."
He huddled around his knees and opened the computer that had been left here, searching for a distraction. He found something stupid and mind-numbing on YouTube to watch. Steve was gonna be here soon, the prospect made him smile again. He chuckled. Excitement seemed to bloom in his heart again.
With a reading area, a lounging area and a huge TV screen—Steve didn't think there existed bigger screens than the one which was in his own living room but apparently, they did—which was discreetly hanging on one of the wall and could almost be taken for another piece of art. The bookshelves took up entire parts of the walls and gave a cosy, intellectual atmosphere to the room. There were pictures on the walls, to Steve's utter surprise. Pictures of things Tony liked, places he had seen... Of the people he cared about obviously. Pepper, Rhodey of course, often the three of them together, but also his parents and Edwin Jarvis and Happy. People who meant a lot to Tony. And mostly, pictures of
"Steve likes you in the horrendous rags you dare call clothes and wear all the time when you tinker. He'll probably like in you anything you wear, Tony."
It was a studio. An actual art studio, with everything Steve could ever need. The design was perfect and the lights as well and the view... the view was outstanding, even better than the one in Tony's room. Steve's heart made a leap in his chest. He felt it clench and something roiled inside suddenly. He touched the furnitures and the supplies with trembling hands, fingers hovering the materials.
Steve looked down and wavered on his feet, sinking his hands in the pockets of his jeans. He braced himself and looked up, staring at Tony's back and ignoring how hot he looked in his loose tank top and dark sweat pants.
"Sure, you aren't." Bucky said with a tinge of sarcasm in his voice. He let the silence linger to lured Steve in a false sense of safety before naively blurting out an unexpected. "Stark's cute though."
"I swear, I'm never gonna ask for your help for anything ever again. You should have stayed home if you were only planning to do as you please." Tony straightened up and paced to him hurriedly before Steve could realize it. "I didn't need that kind of hi—" He wasn't able to finish his sentence as his boyfriend's tongue, suddenly shoved into his mouth, interrupted him. Steve lost balance and moaned into his boyfriend's mouth in surprise.
Something flickered in Tony's eyes for a moment. A little fire in the haze of his chocolate browns. He chuckled nastily. "Okay." He agreed while an evil grin spread on his face.
"Stop freaking out, baby." He said with a soft, soothing voice. "Nothing happened." He declared and he meant it with all his intent. "Nothing happened because you were never like that. You've never forced me or anyone else. Even drunk off your face. Even doped. You've never been like that."
He woke up though, in an alternate universe, where time and space were different, where everything was moving and the ground was wavering and where he was flying. He laughed.
Tony smiled against his lips. "It's alright, though." He husked out with his sexy voice, eyes half-lidded and lewd. "'cause we're both here now and it's perfect, ain't it? It's all that matters."
His heart raced, the anxiety muted him. He had never felt so distant from him. It was such a relief when Steve put his hands on him again to suggest they go home, finally.
Sometimes Steve imagined Tony pushed him down and pinned his hands on the floor and he felt warm, almost wet, at the thought. Tony's foot brushed his ankle again, insistently, and Steve gasped at the touch. He felt his skin prickling in his pants and wiped his clammy hands on them.
both of them. They live in his house, they're part of his pack, they belong to him. Their scents belong to him, their bonding glands pulsate for him, they both submit to him and it is beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. Perfect. A blessing. A gift from the gods—or whatever is out there, deciding for him.
He looked at his phone again and waited patiently until the second course arrived for Obie to inadvertently remove his hand and he rushed to bathroom. He freshened up his face and waited for his body to calm down, for the growing cold uneasiness he felt inside to fade. He realized his hands were shaking. He realized he was scared and was disgusted with himself. He washed up one last time, hiding himself in his hands for a little too long, thinking about Steve, and jerked up when he heard the bathroom door burst open.
"I'll wait anyway." Steve answered and walked back to the studio. If he couldn't enjoy his boyfriend's company he may as well do honor to those supplies.
The omega starts shivering with want. Steve props himself on all four and hauls himself on the bed. His slicked up fingers slide down the leaking shaft and press further down, tracing around the omega's pulsing rim. Steve breaches in, the omega keens frustratingly, fucking himself on Steve's finger. His cock jolts in the air, leaking precum.
"There's Nat and Clint." Bucky replies and when Steve turns his head back, frowning at him skeptically. Bucky's face is amused. He chuckles again. "Our alpha is multi-billionaire, Stevie... I'm pretty sure finding a baby-sitter is just detail."
Steve looks melancholic but still determined. "You know, Tony. Before I went into the ice, I was promised a dance. I never had that dance. And I—" He hesitates, voice faltering. "And I've been wanting to do this with you." He finally whispers. "I've been meaning to ask you teach me how to dance for years and I never did and you never offered and years are passing by but I don't to have regrets. I've had a second chance at life. I don't want to waste anymore time. Please dance with me."
His mind zeroes out in a split-second. He starts shivering. Didn't Steve say that the alpha needed him? His lips part and his entire being struggle to raise his eyes and look up to the alpha to demand answers but fails. He's absolutely unable to look up, eyes staring haphazardly on the ground. He can't move, not until the alpha gives him permission to. He's not usually like this, usually he still has some free will, but right now, this instant, under those conditions while he's frustrated and after hearing Steve's words and with the overpowering heady smell of the room enveloping him and trapping him on the floor, he doesn't have any.
Steve returned the embrace and held his boyfriend tightly against him, until he felt his own heart settling down to a normal pace. He stared up into his eyes, questioningly. "Doing what?" He asked worriedly.
Tony felt another shiver. Want ? Of course he didn’t want it was his first reaction. It wasn’t a question of wanting or not wanting, was it ? The anguish he felt inside was putrefying, slowly turning into rage. Why did Steve keep asking him stupid questions he didn’t have the answers to
"I..." He tried to explain, hesitantly, but Tony's questions were so direct he was unsettled. His certainty shaking. "I don't know. It's... the things I want—I
"I really meant to congratulate you though, you were just really irritating. I needed you to shut up for once."
"I was mostly homeschooled. I didn't get the chance to meet many alphas. I've only reintegrated school last year, to get the best chances of being accepted at  MIT. It's still rare for omegas."
After a moment Bucky sneezed and let out a sigh. "I want to be knotted." He just said, while scratching the inside of his thigh. Steve turned to him and stared at his profile. Bucky was looking at the ceiling with a pout on his lips.
He wiped his face off with the back of his sleeve and huddled against the door, feeling uncomfortable. He started breathing heavily again, his heart was pounding hard in his chest. He felt nauseous. Obie combed his fingers in his hair again, sliding them along the longest strands. His hand gently cupped his cheek and his thumb brushed over his jawline. "You're such a sweet boy, Tony. You were so good to me."
"Oh no! Not again!" Natasha groused, sighing boringly. She rolled her eyes and Bucky, who usually didn't enjoy to unload on his private life, seemed to take it as a challenge and started telling everyone about the first time he and Clint met. How Bucky and his band mates had set up interviews to find a frontman and how Clint had arrived right when it was over and they had already chosen their singer.
He would take what he would find anyway. He had a load of cash, a nice history with sordid, he should be able to find what he needed quite easily.
"I wasn't raped." Tony repeated, annoyedly. "My boyfriend is just jealous. He'd rather have me raped than accept that I had fun without him. He can't stand that I like it rough." He said curtly. "He doesn't understand."
"Wow. I didn't expect you to have that many, actually." Steve must have had five or six toys in that box though... Pretty mild too.
"I have a date myself tonight, Tony. Remember? And I'd like to be able to finish work and plan my evening too. Have a good night!"
"I've only had five and I stuffed myself like a pig..." Steve retorted. "I didn't see you eat, though."
Tony and Natasha had just arrived and were causing a commotion, catching all the attention. They were both stunning and looked so good together.
"Apparently you two went on a trip and that was it, you swept him of his feet then." Bucky snarked, knowing much more about this that his comment implied.
Steve gulped down the rest of his drink and despite feeling his head spin a little he quickly strode there and slid his hand possessively around Tony's waist, slipping his fingers underneath his waistcoat and holding him close. The gesture might have been a little clumsy, overprotective and a little too demanding, maybe slightly inappropriate too, for that kind of event. They usually didn't make a habit of being overtly affectionate with each other, especially in public. He felt a little stupid and blamed it on the alcohol but Steve had needed to mark his territory either way.
Steve kissed the top of his head, pressing smiling lips against his soft hair. "When you stop trying to randomly throw me out every time we have a spat."
And when he was finally out of strength, completely exhausted, he managed to sleep for a couple of hours before waking up again in a startled jolt. A whiff of Tony's scent, the memory of his fingers brushing his skin, the wetness of his lips and he was at it again.
Steve chuckled too and tightened his embrace around him, protectively. "You want us to wait, don't you?"
"You sure?" Bucky slurs against Tony's damp temple. The alpha's right hand comes back to grab the nape of his neck and he turns his head slowly planting his wet lips on Bucky's cheek and kissing the corner of his mouth.
He took it upon himself to think about the whole thing, settle his heart and wait until Tony had calmed down so they could have a serious, more serene discussion about it. In the meantime, he contemplated the studio with a virgin eye and couldn't resist trying some of those fantastic art supplies laid out before him. He felt a tiny bit bad about calling Tony out on the whole thing and then just shamelessly touch the supplies but he reckoned Tony would want him to use them anyway, so why not?
Steve opened wide eyes and felt his insides melt with love. His lips parted with the urge to jump on his boyfriend and steal a kiss.
Happy had opened the door for him and Tony was waiting nonchalantly inside the car. His legs were crossed, his eyes mischievous, and he was gorgeous in his three pieces dark gray tuxedo. He held him a glass of brandy with a sly smile. He looked ecstatic.
Tony looks down under the bed, still partly confused, partly amused, and also partly aroused, not that he's been imagining things... Right, he
Going out of that car was the last thing Steve wanted to do right now but he braced himself and nodded while biting his lips. It was for a good cause indeed, one that was close to his heart.
It just came out of nowhere. Steve raised bored and skeptical eyes at him. Where did that even come from?
The words feel like a stab in the back. Bucky must have felt his distress because he curls around him comfortingly, wrapping him in a soothing and reassuring embrace, his smell growing stronger and headier. "I promise you," he whispers softly against his ear, "that it will be different this time. Everything will go fine."
Clint doesn't comment, Tony just hears him humming. "I'll make you something special." He mutters softly and a few moments later, after some chopping and whirring, Clint's handing him a huge glass of something that looks like a smoothie but smells a lot like rum. Tony takes it, a little perplexed, and takes a tentative sip. He almost lets out a moan while the liquid warms his throat.
He had come to the realization that day, that they could do this. They could be happy, the three of them. He just needed Tony to see it too. He just needed to get his alpha back.
Flowers were ordered. He knew what he was gonna wear. Plus, he had prepared a little surprise for later. When they would be alone. And he had done everything on his own, for once. He was rather proud of himself. He stared at his phone. No sign from Steve whatsoever, Tony was restless. Steve never texted, never called—except to tell him off—but... Tony wished he would sometimes, just to be sure. After all, they hadn't talked about it again. Not after last week anyway... Of course he could call himself but he didn't dare. Every time he called Steve he felt like he was bothering him. He had written his text ten times at least and chickened out before pressing send.
"Okay, boss." He hissed and the haze faded slowly from his eyes. Steve let his fingers brush across his shoulders while he passed by his side, needing the contact. Tony caught his hand right before he walked out of his reach and stopped him in the middle of his momentum. His fingers curled around his wrist and he tugged on his arm gently to press a kiss on his the inside of his wrist before getting up as well. Silently obeying Steve's orders. They exchanged a silent smile and got back to work.
Steve hated him a little. He wasn't just the perfect alpha, he was more. There was something about him. Steve wasn't sure what exactly. Just a feeling. Just a glimpse of a smile, or a flicker of an emotion flashing across his eyes. He was handsome, yes, from an objective point of view, he was. Steve could admit that although he hadn't really decided—well "decided" wasn't the right word, it was more like
Another scorching sucked-in breath and Steve took his inhaler again. Another whiff of medicine and his head started spinning. Forget about college, he was gonna spend the rest of his life in a fucking hospital at this pace. His good mood ebbed away quickly, all his hopes flying out the window.
What's the point in struggling? We can't change our nature and my nature needs to submit to you and your nature needs to care for your omegas. That's who we are, Tony. Why keep fighting? Why stay miserable apart when we could be happy together? Life already sucks enough for us to add some extra self-inflicted pain."
that guy? It wasn't like Steve didn't know about him. "It was fun." He justified himself, pouting a little. Why did he need to justify himself? "We were just having fun."
Tony can't even look at him without thinking about everything that happened between them. How Barnes became James and James became Jamie and Jamie became Bucky. Would Bucky have consented then? If he had been himself?
Steve shook his head, however, and tsked. He was so hard it hurt. "Nah." He just said, words unusually low and hoarse. "You're the one getting fucked today." He rasped in a throaty voice. "After teasing me all day long. I'm gonna fuck you so hard you're gonna regret ever telling me you like being dominated in bed."
Steve chuckles in front of him. Tony raises his eyes and is momentarily dazed by the smile on his boyfriend's adorable morning face. He doesn't speak but he must have looked slightly curious because Steve answers his unsaid question before he even has the time to think of it.
There was something sad that flashed through her eyes, long enough for Tony to feel bad about it. He hated that. He hated that look in other people's eyes. The one that seem to imply he was some sort of victim. This was why he hated hospitals. He didn't need that kind of sympathy, even less that kind of concern. Tony was no victim. He was a slut, he was trash, he was a cum dump, a piss whore, a human toilet, a filthy cunt, a deviant perv, an asshole, a liar, a cheat, everything you wanted... but he was
The man quickly stood up and pulled his pants back up, leaving Tony lying half-naked and filled with cum on the toilet bowl, as if nothing had happened.
Fucking the alpha is a raptured experience. Bucky feels like all his senses are enhanced. The alpha is tight around him and makes little breathless groans that coils heat deep inside Bucky. The rocking movement he controls ripples right through the alpha to the other omega who is still lost in a daze. He grips Tony's hips strongly and fucks into him harder and harder and each one of his thrusts sends the alpha deeper into his fugue and the omega deeper in his daze. The blond's face lightens up, lips spreading slowly into a blissful smile.
"What I don't understand though..." he started enigmatically, "is why you never really acted on it."
Steve doesn't seem to give a shit tonight however and Tony wonders if he should make out with Clint a little, to get his attention, but he pushes the stupid thought away. That would be the mature thing to do, he reckons, and he wouldn't have had the time to do it anyway because Clint has already whirled away and left him puzzled at the entrance while his boyfriend is walking toward the living room, curled up in Loki's embrace, both of them laughing. He looks at the scene with a certain aloofness, that same feeling of disgust pooling in his stomach, and finally mutters up the courage to join everyone. Everyone being Thor, Bucky and the happy couple reunited. He suddenly feels the urge to leave.
Tony earned another slap on the face for his impertinence and was hurriedly pushed down on his knees. Now they could really get down to business. The two other men joined quickly. Soon, Tony had one cock in his mouth and one in each hand.
Suddenly all his instincts become knowledge. His doubts, certainties. His fears become strength. His hesitation, clarity. His fantasies become truth. His dreams, real. Every obstacle becomes a game. All he ever wanted disappears or mingles with Tony's desires. He doesn't know which are whose anymore. All he knows is that he wants Bucky and Tony wants Bucky and Bucky wants them, both of them, and his lingering jealousy fades and vanishes in the fluttering of a butterfly's wings. All the residues of spite and anger and doubt between them are
He gave another non-response shrug as he didn't have any answers and looked away while he begged Steve to go, he didn't need another fight. Not now. "Can we go home now? I really wanna take a shower."
Tony flinches back and parts his lips. He stares at him silently, dumbfounded. The atmosphere is suddenly heavy, almost forlorn. "I'm sorry..." Tony whispers with a broken voice. He keeps staring but this time he really
Steve felt nostalgic. He wanted Tony back. More than ever. It burnt at the pit of his stomach. It crept under his skin. It made his teeth grit.
His residual rage mixed with new found enthusiasm and the will to fight, no matter what, allowed him to be surprisingly efficient. To the point he almost hoped at some point that he would be able to bail out on dinner and get away with it, thanks to his brilliance. His new found enthusiasm was quickly dampened though, caught up with reality soon enough. Howard didn't give a shit about his presentation. He just wanted him there. He just wanted to show them how docile and subservient his son was. There was no way Tony would ever be able to skip dinner.
Steve would have liked to answer but he just moaned helplessly while Tony kept kissing him, wiping the tears he hadn't known he had from his eyes.
He has two omegas and he doesn't know what to do. He is lost and he has lost to them a long time ago. The moment they were down on his knees Tony was doomed. They keep manipulating him with their treacherous submission. They make his head spin with their pernicious scents. They're driving him crazy. He doesn't know how he can continue living with them like this, and keep his sanity.
He staggered out of the room, feeling dizzy, a strong headache pounding against his skull. His hand trembled when he brought it to his head. A sudden anxiety attack overwhelmed him, rising up throughout his whole body, making his heart race for a few seconds. He leant on the wall, took a deep breath, shook the bad feelings away—they were not better, nor worse than what he had felt all fucking day anyway—and set up to walk back to Steve. He threw the leaflets into the first bin he could find on his way, signed the discharge, leanrt that Steve had taken care of everything, shoved the prescription down the pocket of his boyfriend's hoodie and joined him. He could still smell him into the soft fabric, despite his own nauseating stench of booze, cum, blood and piss. He buried his nose in it one last time before Steve could see and felt a surge of happiness at the sight of him.
Tony smiled against Steve's lips. "Back in the warmth of your bed?" He attempted, being awkwardly prudish.
It took all but one cycle for them to synchronize. Bucky was the first to have his heat. It didn't last long. Two days. Heats are shorter when you have young pups in the pack. It was—well, he hasn't got many accurate words to describe it. Amazing, sensational, mind-blowing.
"Why would you think I'd lie about something like this?" He replied curtly. Then he stared into his eyes, something indescribable on his face. All the tenderness from before gone, in an instant. He smiled and it looked a little cold. "You don't believe me, do you?" He whispered resignedly. "You
Tony startled and raised his eyes to him confusedly, as if surprised that the conversation had suddenly turned all about him. He smiled, cheeks slightly flushed. "Not really..." He said while avoiding Steve's stare. He reached a hand behind his ear and started scratching nervously. "Not like you."
he remembers, and that was the last thing he actually wanted to do and he doesn't know why he would purposely do something like this. Something in him is too rotten for Steve's pure unsullied hands. It's at times like this that he remembers.
Tony had no answer to that question. He just thought that the deviant glow in that guy's eyes reminded him of Obie, that this man's dangerous wickedness was both entrancing and terrifying. He wondered why he was always attracted to the same kind of guy. Or was it the other way around? He also knew that he was probably gonna do everything that guy wanted him to do either way. Tony was fucked up like that. His breathing accelerated.
"Someone's happy to see me..." Steve says teasingly and Tony realizes he's poking at his boyfriend with his boner.
He found himself in front of the bar again. There were three guys now. Also in their mid-late-thirties. Tony couldn't really distinguish their faces well. He stumbled and one of them caught him, he thought... Or maybe that was another patron, he wasn't sure. He was thirsty.
Tony feels something acrid inside. He hates it when there's nothing he can do to fix things. He's the one who averts his eyes now. He looks away and his eyes fall on his trembling hand.
Thor grimaced, head tilted on the side. "Can't deny it!" He said. "Loki really had it bad." Everyone else nodded.
"I bought it for later, to celebrate." Steve admitted, a little disappointed that he had ruined the surprise.
He thought of his dad for a second. Would Howard be happy if he was? What would say if he knew what his good friend Obadiah had been doing to his only son for all those years? Maybe he already knew... Maybe he just didn't care, as long as it never got out.
Overtime they have developed a strong connection based on trust, mutual respect, communication and a lot of tenderness. It involves a lot of submission on Bucky's part but Steve has realized quite quickly that Bucky needs this just as much, if not more, as Tony does. It makes sense in a way, Bucky has been forced on his knees for more than seventy years of his life. Twice Steve's age. A third of his life. It makes sense that it would bring him a sense of safety in the routine.
His mind is blank when he rides the elevator to the Penthouse. His mind is blank too, when the door opens on its own, as if he was expected. When he gets in however he is overwhelmed by a flush of emotions. It is too much, too intense, too sudden.
"And you'll have to accept that I own at least 80 percent of it, otherwise we'll never be able to afford it."
Tony leant on one hand and slid the other up and down Steve's side, seemingly trying to push him away.
Tony stared down at his father, gritting his teeth. It was a matter of beliefs, he thought, but they had always had a major difference of opinion on the matter. Tony didn't take any pride knowing his grand father participated in the Manhattan Project. Two hundred and fifty thousand casualties and millions of long-term victims was not what he considered a great achievement. Neither was war profiteering and weaponizing. Not that whatever he thought mattered to Howard. He did wonder though if his father truly believed himself in what he was saying. Did he really think that kind of Manichaean speech would have an impact on Tony? Or was it just an excuse, a way to keep the illusion alive... All Tony understood from that grand speech was that if he had thought, even for one second, that he might have had just an ounce of freedom in this so-called father-son relationship, he had been thoroughly wrong. His whole demeanor yielded against his will and Tony looked at his father resignedly.
"I'm so sorry, babe." Tony shivered again, but didn't comment on the pet name. "I'm so sorry. I can't believe I've been such an ass. All the things I've said... about omegas, when all this time, you—"
Tony hesitated. He suddenly felt the pain throbbing in his ass and shivered. He couldn't look the nurse in the eyes. For one second he was tempted to say yes but refrained. "No."
Steve startled at the unexpected rejection but wrapped his arms around him and scooted closer. He searched Tony's nose, nuzzling against him. "Then I'll come back to yours." He said, although there was a tinge of insecurity in his tone.
He's tired of waiting. He's tired of being kept on edge, uncertain, of being jealous, of feeling rejected, of playing with them both like a puppet-master and seeing the pain in their eyes when they're looking at him expectantly as if Steve was holding all the answers, he doesn't. Or maybe he does, who knows?
Still, that doesn't change the facts. James is locked up. In a luxurious prison, admittedly, but a prison nevertheless. And James loves him, surely he does. He accommodates. Maybe he aspires to a semblance of life. Loving the man who keeps you captive, loving the sire of your pup, really seems like the easiest thing to do.
Tony disentangled himself from Steve's embrace and turned around adamantly, walking away from him. "Where are you going?" Steve asked hurriedly, sounding a little wary.
Obie smiled. "You know I can't do that. I have a family. My wife is waiting for me. You understand, right?"
Tony chuckled softly, expression fond. "You said you hadn't finished decorating." He said amusedly and then added. "And yet, seven years later, it's exactly the same as it was then. Nothing has changed." He drank a swig from his glass of water and his gaze fixed the gray sky outside. The silence lingered.
Steve felt a surge of warmth invading his entire body. Tony was right. Suddenly, this thing they were about to do, it felt somehow special and he didn't want to screw it up by rushing things.
Steve walked to him slowly, reaching a comforting hand to his shoulder. Meaning to, at least, because Tony caught his wrist before he could touch him and pulled on his arm. Steve stumbled and swiveled on his feet with the movement, Tony pushed him against the desk. Steve's rear bumped into it and jostled everything that was on it. He had no idea what was happening to him except that Tony's hand was holding the back of his head, a firm and manly grip on the nape of his neck, his other hand was pinning Steve's on the desk. This time the kiss was desperate and brutal, warming Steve's body in all the right places. He wished he was stronger and he wished he could have prevented this but the only thing he was capable of was shamelessly moan into his boyfriend's mouth, body shivering against the immovable bulk of him, reacting too strongly to the carnal desire that transpired from him.
At some point he heard someone speak out and people laughing. Apparently he had missed one of Fury's rare jokes. Not that he cared but he had always paid attention in class and being caught—even by himself—not listening, made him blush embarrassedly. He suddenly felt self-conscious. He tried to concentrate but the boy brushed a hand through the small hair at the top of his nape and Steve's focus was immediately drawn to his long, entrancing fingers and his charcoal hair, a weird sort of warmth pooling inside. He was fascinated, again, and couldn't keep his eyes off.
Once they were outside and the fresh air slapped Tony on the face, he took a deep breath and closed his eyes. When he opened them again, things seemed clearer suddenly.
Steve tiptoed and caught the back of his boyfriend's head with his other hand, so he could kiss more, and the temperature rose between them. He shoved his tongue into Tony's mouth who moaned in surprise but melted into the kiss so beautifully.
It was almost a relief when Steve hung up on him. Except Steve's last remark made him retch. Oh how he
So no, he wouldn't let Tony push him away this time. He wouldn't let Tony rile him up. He wouldn't give up. He was not leaving this tower before he and Tony talked this through.
"So I guess, I'll have to interpret it then, is that it?" Steve insisted, anger pervaded in his voice. Tony couldn't hold his stare anymore and looked down in shame. Tony had never felt that much shame before. After everything he had done, after all the things others had done to him. Nothing and no-one could shame him. Except Steve apparently. "So I reckon if you didn't stop them even if you could have, it means that you wanted it, right?" There was a pause. "Did you want it?"
Anyway, Steve tried not to think about how both sad and funny this impromptu visit appeared and stared with interest at the scene. There was an unusual silence in the classroom and it was very relaxing.
Tony cringed and ran his tongue on his teeth, still staring intently at Steve. His eyes were always intense. "I know..." He admitted and averted his eyes, looking embarrassed. "but I know the feeling..." He added. "And this isn't fair on you."
His mum ruffled his head again and slid her hand down his cheeks, cupping his jaw and brushing his skin with her thumb. "Stevie, honey. These kind of things you need to figure out on your own."
When he raised his head again, two green eyes were glaring at him and red, soft, full lips were twisted at him annoyedly. "Hands off my date, Rogers." Steve startled at the challenging aggressiveness in the tone although she was smiling teasingly. She tilted her head seductively, cooing at Tony like only women could, and swayed her hips slowly with a gesture of her hand that meant
—the painting everyone had been talking about for weeks. The "masterpiece" that had miraculously found its spot at the MoMA. The painting Steve had ripped away from his guts after their disastrous break-up. The one he had poured his heart and soul into, the one that meant so much for both of them.
Steve glanced up at him and looked down again. "You're scaring me." He whispered, words struck in his throat.
you need." Steve wavered, hesitant. He didn't know what to do with his hands. He stared up at his boyfriend, feeling anxious but hopeful.
Right. That made sense. Tony probably wouldn't want to sleep with himself either, especially after seeing the state he was in earlier, but... It wasn't like Tony had meant sex. Fucking, even with Steve, was the last thing he wanted to do right now. Did Steve really expect him to want sex now? Did Steve want sex now? If he truly wanted it, Tony would do it though. "I meant sleep next to you." He rectified.
Steve kisses him when Tony finally knots him. He's kissing him. The omega's lips so soft and loving. There is a smile on those lips.
Steve is lying on his back, his legs nonchalant, spread haphazardly. His entire body is glistening with sweat. Tony's hands are roaming all over his skin. He rakes his fingers into his damp hair, cradling his face tenderly. He gives him a sloppy wet kiss. His other hand slides down his flank, nails grazing the sensitive skin of his ribcage. The tips of his fingers trail along his ribs, brushing the skin softly. Steve shivers, curls his toes, wraps his strong arms around the alpha, sinks his nails into the skin of his back until he bleeds. The alpha bites him back on his freshly mating bite that's already healed with the serum but undeniably there. Steve's head drops back, he loses consciousness, sent to the vast ocean-blue sky in an instant. His eyes are still and hazy, pupils blown so wide, there's only a sliver of blue around his irises.
Steve ignored the pang of disappointment in his chest and nodded again, rising on his feet. Tony's hand moved and brushed Steve's again. Maybe purposely, maybe not. Steve felt another jolt of electricity at the touch. He stared up into Tony's eyes which didn't seem to let go. He held his stare until the boy averted his eyes.
His boyfriend turned around and looked at him worriedly. Tony raised sheepish eyes to him, afraid to be rebuked again.
"Don't worry! I can control my urges, I'm not an animal... I won't jump on you." The alpha says. That's exactly what he was worried about...
It was only when Howard left his office that Tony noticed that Obie had been watching the entire scene. He was leaning on the doorframe, arms crossed on his broad chest, and looked at him with an amused though slightly supportive smile. The way he stared at him gave Tony shivers, not the same kind. If Howard had put shackles on his ankles and wrists, Obie had put one on his neck. One even more inescapable. Perverse and insidious.
Steve pressed his grip on Tony's forearm, searching for his eyes. "I don't care about it." He muttered softly. "I care about
His father curled his arm around Tony in a paternal pat and tightened his embrace, pulling Tony close to him gently. That was the kind of embrace younger Tony would have craved for. Now, if it didn't repel him exactly, it made him uneasy. Tony felt more comfortable with Howard's violent fits than his gentleness. At least, he knew what to expect with the former.
"You deserve the world," Steve retorted, running his fingers in Tony's hair softly, "and I hate you for being so quick to give up on us."
Steve abruptly turned his head to his friend, looking at him sidelong, half skeptical, half curious.
The man's smile was incredulous when he ran his thumb on the skin of Tony's neck, soothing the pain of that invisible shackle. "No longer, you're not." He said assertively, a dangerous grin on his lips. "You'll do what your father asked you to do. Make him proud, Tony boy. Do it for your sake, and for ours. You can do it. I trust you." His voice was deep and low and gentle and vibrated low in Tony's core.
Tony rushes outside, before he does another thing he regrets. Plus, he needs jerking off. Three hours non-stop of Steve's spellbinding scent and the small touch was enough.
Thor explained how he thought Jane was really pretty and tried it out with her but was harshly rejected, which piqued his interest. He got to know her and became genuinely interested. "But she kept ignoring me and rejected all my attempts with a disdainful glare." He finally said.
Steve, on the other hand, has a reputation and he doesn't care anymore. Now that he knows who he is and what he wants, nothing else matters and especially not what other people think. He feels strong and fulfilled and blissed around Tony. So it doesn't matter that the rumors are still going on, that the people who smelt alpha on him the first day are starting to think they've been dreaming the whole thing. Steve cannot possibly be alpha. He's so
Tony didn't answer but he lowered his head and close his mouth to leave only the hint of a smile on his face. They started heading towards the subway.
"We've had sex once." Tony blurts out casually, he doesn't even know why. "And I don't remember any of it." His voice comes out rasp. Maybe the realization stung a little.
Tony looks at his friend while something clenches inside. He's never thought about it before. He was just thinking that there's nothing money can't buy and feels suddenly like a rich asshole.
"The heinous glare you gave him when he walked through that hospital door, all worried and insecure." Bucky laughed. "That was hilarious."
"Well, the two of you have been a real pain in our asses though," Bucky commented, "it was time you figured this shit out. My ears still bleed in memory of all that pining and complaining on Steve's part..."
He wiped his mouth and tried to look at Steve. He wished he could speak but his throat hurt too much. Steve looked sad, and worried, and Tony hated that look on Steve.
"Besides," Clint continues with a mischievous smile. "Someone still dreams about murdering me because of it."
"I have no idea." Steve whispered, freaking out a little bit. Although he did have an idea but how he ended up in this very real, very fucked-up situation, he had absolutely no knowledge of.
Tony groaned into his mouth and pushed into him softly, holding him like he was something so precious he would die to protect it. Steve just curled his arms around him and grabbed his face, seeking more of his taste, wanting to penetrate his skin, take a glimpse of his soul. He wanted to devour him.
"It's really recent but...we finally decided to give it go. We'll see. We'll always be parents first I think." They shared a knowing smile, eyes plunged into each other's like they were alone in the world. Steve noticed how hard their joined hands squeezed. It was beautiful to see and filled with love and affection.
Tony's rasp and mellow tongue obliged and licked up to tip of his cock, leaving a trail of saliva along his shaft. He grazed at the stretched skin underneath before swallowing the head.  Again he played with his teeth and rolled his tongue around and moaned around Steve's cock, teasing him until his mind went blank. Steve's body was shaking, frozen in pleasure, incapable of focusing on anything else, otherwise he would have noticed maybe that his boyfriend was as desperate and wanting as he was the moment. He just closed his eyes and let himself relish in the pleasure. He whined and panted and his chest was heaving, and his knees were buckling, and his grip on the bookcases was so strong he almost dented them.
The words came out difficulty with the lump in his throat but he forced them out, swallowing again. "Later, babe." He croaked. "I need to send this e-mail first."
Fuck, he was tired... He really wished he could comply but his body didn't seem to follow. He felt himself go but Steve's hands held him gently. The smell of piss made him sick, his stomach churned and he started retching. He threw up, barely anything solid, and the pain he felt as he did so seemed to say that it wasn't the first time he vomited tonight.
been discussing about opening things again, to some extend, but it's not gonna happen anytime soon, I think. We're good for now." He pauses and glances at his husband for a few seconds. "Well, I can't tell you about Buck but... It works for me and I haven't really been tempted, so far." Tony is all ears, looking at his friend expectantly. "Why are you asking anyway? Are you worried about getting bored?"
"So my dad was being his usual ass and there was this guy—barely a hundred pounds on himself, five feet five of no-one—who stared at him with dignity and pride and a confidence about his own skills that I had rarely seen in anyone before and then he... And then he just
Their eyes met and they remained silent, standing still in the middle of the room. Bucky was so pretty in the moonlight, his hair was falling onto his forehead and his tall and muscular figure. Very manly. The same silhouette that had attracted him more than seventy years ago. Steve could only see a lewd glimmer in his eyes and his parted lips. The alpha scent was everywhere in the nest, permeated in the walls.
Steve paused and studied him for a second or so. His expression was unreadable and his smile mute. Nothing but silence twinkled in his dark eyes. He considered the question with both excitement and annoyance and pondered telling Tony the reason why he was not interested.
Something dark and dangerous glimmered in Tony's eyes. It was brutal and aggressive and Steve was hypnotized by the intensity in those eyes for a minute. It was unexpected and out of character. Steve would have expected Tony to laugh out loud, throwing his head back, or smile shyly, looking sidelong with a coy expression, or jump out of excitement, or even look down on him with contempt and anger, maybe. But not this fierceness. Not this dark and rude determination. Tony's hand was suddenly around his neck, pressing a little. Steve's heart raced and for a split second, he felt the terror paralyze him. His mind went back ten years ago, with Johann, and he gasped, eyes locked into Tony's. Stunned.
Steve felt a shiver run down his spine. The lump in his throat was almost choking him. "Are you throwing me out?" He croaked out in a strangled voice. He felt the panic rise inside.
It sends sparks of electricity when the alpha spurts his seeds deep inside of him and knots him. Steve comes again, he's drained out. Exhausted. Not an ounce of energy left inside of him, super-soldier or not. And yet he keeps feeling warmth pooling at the pit of his stomach, invade him, spreading heat in all his limbs, desire runs through him and hits him relentlessly.
He felt nauseous again. Why did everyone keep making him feel that way? A sudden unquenchable urge to cry constricted his throat, almost choking him. He parted his lips, trying to swallow the lump stuck in there, trying to
He walked out the door instead, suffocated in agony in the elevator and refrained the impulse to throw himself under the wheels of that car. Or maybe someone caught him by the shoulder before he did.
Tony feels something weird inside, maybe it's the melancholy in Loki's eyes. He glances at Steve behind him. Steve is still annoyed with him, he glares back and turns away, ignoring Tony.
"Thanks." Tony said absentmindedly and Steve took advantage of his abstraction to snatch the glass of wine from his hand and returned to the kitchen to empty it in the sink.
Steve tugged on his coat to get closer. "Yeah, but it bothers you, right?" He whispered. "Even just a little...?" He didn't wait for Tony to answer to smile more widely. Tony would never admit it but Steve could see right through him. "I never thought I'd finally see the day when Tony Stark is jealous." He said, smugly happy.
Tony didn't move at first, wondering if he actually had a choice or not. Not that it mattered much, at this point. He internally laughed, mirthless. Steve had no use for a scum-sucking loser like him anyway.
"I really sorry about last night." Tony repeated, a little less urgently. "I'm sorry if I came on too strongly but I really don't want you to misunderstand my intentions." Steve was hung on his words and stared desperately at the movement of his lips, unable to look him in the eyes. He felt an embarrassing blush creeping on his face but couldn't say or do anything but listen to the strongly resolved alpha. "I really do like you, Steve. I know I've been a bit clumsy trying to ask you out and I'm sorry about it but I like you. I have, for a long time, and—" Steve watched him as his resolve faded and he started losing composure, anxiousness slightly distorting his beautiful features. Something clenched his chest, something that stopped him from saying anything. "And it's not because of what you are but because of
friend. They had gotten along really quickly and Steve felt proud to be counted among his closest friends now, despite their age difference. Sam had always been very protective of Steve. Both a friend and a father figure. Was it his fault? Or was it that adults grew naturally distant as time passed by and that kind of thing became sort of inevitable when all of them were too busy with their own lives. So far he had never heard of Sam dating anyone, or Natasha for the matter. No one that had counted anyway.
That particular tongue stung however, the burn spread inside Tony. He'd rather fuck the guy's mouth again. He
Tony jerked his head up and stared into his eyes provocatively. He grinned. "Why don't you put me down on my knees and find out?" Something depraved flickered in the man's eyes and he smiled evilly.
Steve knows about rights and wrongs. Steve is his gauge... because the line separating them is still blurry in Tony's head.
Tony smiled and interrupted Steve with a finger on his mouth. "Alright." He said amusedly. "No need to rush." Then he leant over and kissed Steve again, softly this time, while his hands fumbled with Steve's pants. He pulled up his shirt and slipped his hands underneath and played them on Steve's chest, fingers running along his ribs. Steve shivered all over, a jolt of electricity running down his spine. It burnt everywhere Tony's fingers brushed his skin. He let escape a throaty growl and his hands unconsciously grabbed Tony's wrists, stopping him instantly.
Steve's heart skipped at that precise moment but he ignored the feeling, just as he ignored the sudden warmth at the bottom of his stomach, spreading like wild fire throughout his body. He started reading out loud, voice shivering a little at first, coarse and broken.
This is maybe the only he doesn't regret in his fucking life. Being a parent wasn't part of his plan but it's certainly one of the most beautiful thing that happened to him.
Tony stopped, determination wavering and worry growing on his face. Steve stared at him, mouth gaping. He would have wanted to say something. Anything. He should have apologized, should have explained. It wasn't Tony's fault. Tony hadn't done anything wrong, on the contrary, it had been all the most decent. Steve was just a stupid fool and a careless jerk. But his heart beat too fast, his head throbbed too hard and the warmth pooling in his stomach was much too overwhelming. He just opened and closed his mouth like a fish and strengthened his hold on the alpha. "I—" He stammered. "I like you too."
Tony's been all around the world too, but he hasn't seen anything of it. Just the same luxurious hotel rooms, serving the same continental breakfasts, in the same buffets. He's always met with the same kind of people, with always the same agendas. He knows nothing. Nothing of the world, nothing of life. He's boring. The only thing he can talk about is science shit that bores just about everyone except Bruce and Jane. Tony has nothing to offer, nothing apart from his money and his pretty face. One of those two things Steve despises and the other getting closer and closer to its expiration date by the day.
Steve laughed softly and raked his hand in his boyfriend's hair. "Tony, I can take care of my own business, you know? I don't need you to handle everything for me. And it's not like you've got the time anyway. I made a really good deal, with a good capital gain. I don't even need the money. Stop being a control freak, please."
Everyone was all ears. Steve wondered if they were that curious or if Tony was genuinely talented at captivating his audience. Probably a bit of both he thought. Tony was usually quieter when they met with close friends. He didn't have to be at the center of everyone's attention.
Tony propped himself up on one elbow and glared at Steve. "I wasn't expecting anything." Tony justified, tone very serious. "I just want to figure this thing out with you and I haven't been disappointed so far."
Steve suddenly remembered the empty closet and the spare toothbrush and the second armchair, and Tony's words... He
Steve smiled sheepishly and met his boyfriend's eyes, apologetically ashamed. Tony was sprawled on the bed and smiled back, swallowing up his frustration. He grabbed his own cock while Steve's cum started leaking out of him.
Tony didn't pay attention and quickly picked a bottle of brandy from the small bar to serve himself a drink under his dubious stare. Steve looked at him perplexedly while he poured the brown liquid into a glass.
Steve quickly paced back to the living room and straddled him again. "Close your eyes." He ordered and Tony shivered and smiled softly, slowly showing his perfect teeth, lewdly wet and shining so bright in the winter light. His hands were back on Steve's waist, strong, possessive, and Steve couldn't help a shudder that vibrated through him from head to toe. Tony's head was reclined the sofa and his eyes were closed obediently. He was at Steve's mercy, open and pliant. Steve slowly rocked his hips on his crotch and hummed sensually when he felt his boyfriend twitch under him. He did it again and drew a gasp from Tony. His lips parted. Steve brushed the chocolate down his boyfriend's face, following the bridge of his nose. Tony was biting his lips in anticipation, licking them softly. "Open." Steve husked out, the word stuck in his throat, raspy and lustful. Tony naturally opened his mouth and Steve let the chocolate slide down into it, brushing his lips softly, vibrating to the sound of his boyfriend's lewd hums and moans.
Steve was the only one Tony could count on. And Steve made him happy. And he wanted to make Steve happy too. He really did.
His heart skipped a beat when he heard the inquisitive voice of his boyfriend downstairs. "Steve?" He cocked his head out of the bathroom door. "Can you come down a minute?" There was a sort of urgency in the tone, although his boyfriend sounded quite lighthearted, and he hurried down the stairs still naked underneath his towel.
Now Felicia is asleep and Bucky feels the familiar burning hit his guts. It builds inside him, warms him up slowly, tingles softly his limbs. His skin prickles like thousands of tiny sparkles of electricity firing him up.
asking for consent, always paying attention to Steve's pleasure. "Is that okay if we don't use a condom?"
He wondered if Howard had always been so blasé or if he used to be an idealistic when he was young. Had ever been in love? Had he ever been ecstatic about anything? Were was the excitement? Where was the enthusiasm? Where was the little twinkle of futuristic genius that used to shine in his eyes? His father used to be inventive even if Tony had never seen it with his own eyes. Tony only knew the dull drunken glow of his father's eyes. Or the delirious violent rage that sometimes fired in them. He suddenly felt sad for him, despite everything. He felt sad and sorry and prayed very hard to himself to never end up like him.
Tony looked suddenly innocent, face flushed and smile genuine. He looked down at his hands and played with his nails nervously. He bit his bottom lip and licked it.
Tony inches away, heart racing a little. "Yeah I'm sorry 'bout that." He mutters guiltily. "I've been really busy lately. I'm the worst."
Steve felt his heart leap and returned his smile. "I do." He said softly and looked down embarrassedly, feeling a blush creeping on his face. "Perhaps I've stopped waiting." He said with a conniving smile. Tony beamed and turned his face back to the window pane while drinking his water.
had been a complete shock. And when Steve turned to them, he was faced with three pairs of wide-opened eyes and three square jaws hanging slack.
Tony's adventurous hand wandered down his pants. "I can help you if you need." but Steve stopped him with an abrupt grip on his hand.
"I have your body on demand, why would I bother?" Although there might have been a couple of times when Steve regretted not having them. Tony worked a lot and often finished late at night.
"You really think Tony can take care of both of us at the same time? I mean, he's... he's not getting any younger and—" He's interrupted by the brunet who wraps his arms around him tenderly and snuggles into the nape of his neck, planting soft kisses there. He can feel his tickling breath when he chuckles and shivers all over.
It took all but two days for Steve to pack his bag and return to the Tower. It was such a relief then. It felt dizzying at first, feeling
Steve didn't pay much attention to the lecture for the remaining fifteen minutes. The boy was sitting right in the middle of his line of sight, at the perfect angle. He was two rows before and placed exactly where Steve could stare inconspicuously without anyone noticing. The boy was listening carefully, or pretending too, Steve wasn't so sure yet. He was slightly slouched on his seat, enough to give him a nonchalant attitude without being outwardly rude either. His legs were spread wide as if showing off an impressive package down there, not that Steve had been looking anyway. Actually, he'd rather look at his right hand. It was rough and skillful, playing swiftly with a pen, making it roll around it smoothly, like it was nothing.
Steve wants to taste it, the translucent bead prickling out of Bucky's slit. He sticks his tongue out and presses it mellowly on the head of Bucky's cock. The omega moans, biting his lips. The alpha's musky scent spikes up the air, making both omegas shiver. Steve tastes Bucky on the tip of his tongue before swallowing him down into his throat in one go. The omega instinctively thrusts up and ravages his throat the way Steve loves it. He feels warm all over, his slick starts dripping out of him again, trickling down his balls.
Since then it only happened four times, plus a couple of times they've been messing around but didn't go all the way. This isn't much but Steve is content, because each time has been glorious.
Steve sighed. "I didn't want to be omega." He admitted regretfully. "It's time that I accept who I am."
Steve straightened up and rolled his eyes. "Okay, stop!" He said while swirling his boyfriend around with a strong grip on his hips and pushed him towards the lounging area. He shoved him onto the huge couch that lay in the middle of the room while Tony giggled in surprise.
Tony startled and looked suddenly blessed with angelic innocence. His smirk died down and he parted his lips in confusion, unable to realize how easily he had managed to convince Steve. That was one of those moments when Steve realized most of Tony's confidence was an act. Maybe Tony was as scared as he was but he had always been so much braver than him, on every aspect. Tony's confused face was a jewel. He was so hesitant in his repressed happiness. He was beautiful.
"I've always known." Tony answered with an impassive tone but his hand reached Steve's cheek and brushed it gently and he kissed him again, a soft smile on his lips.
"I wish Jane had been so proactive..." Thor said pensively. "I really thought she hated me at first. She was always glaring haughtily and sighed whenever I talked to her. Good thing that I'm a persistent guy."
She turns on her stomach and slips her hand between her legs. The pressure feels good and unnerving. She hates herself a little but she gives in. It's only after the fifth time that she finally falls asleep on her bed, satisfied.
of it all. Slowly but surely Bucky is lulled into an alternate state of consciousness, comforted by the innate knowledge that, if anything were to happen to his daughter he would wake up from it immediately, him and Steve both, comforted by the knowledge, too, that their alpha would be taking care of them the right way, that he could give up control completely and let it happen.
Seducing is second nature to Tony. He's in his comfort zone, it's like being home again after a long travel abroad. Loki is not indifferent, he can see it. Even though he pretends to be amused. Something lewd glimmers in his green eyes.
She goes straight to the training room to relieve some pent-up frustration. And stops right there, at the entrance. Paralyzed. She wasn't the only one who needed to relieve some frustration apparently. The stench is strong and violates her noise. Sweet and warm and cosy, spicy and aroused, untamed and frustrated. Enchanting and riling up. It reeks of lascivious omega everywhere. Steve and James are sparring, rolling around each other on the mat, rousing each other up.
Twenty minutes later, when James stopped shaking and whimpering, they can finally get free from each. No words are exchanged. James stands up on wobbling legs, pulls his soaked sweat shorts up and heads for the door.
The alarm clock was torture. Steve had barely slept two hours and the prospect of his day to come just depressed him even before it began. He stirred from under the covers, unconsciously searched for Tony's presence next to him and stretch his tired arm toward his side of the bed but found no Tony, just the still warm shape of him on the mattress and his familiar scent. Not unusual, Tony always woke up earlier than him—almost always—but this morning Steve felt particularly anxious about Tony's absence. Steve had felt his boyfriend's body spasm all night long. He grumbled, moving his limbs was an utter ordeal, they were as heavy as anvils. His head hurt like hell, and yet he
Steve thought his mouth gaped open. "What the fuck?" He quickly skirted around his boyfriend to face him, leaving a few feet between them. "What are you talking about?"
Tony smiled gently. He sounded and looked so composed and grounded. Stable. It stirred something in Steve.
"Redbull and ice." Dark-haired guy answered. At least he thought it was him, he recognized his voice. Tony glared at him. "You seem to be a little out of it, kid." The guy explained. "We don't want you to throw up, do we?"
"Do you want me to tell you what happened?" Clint asks in a serious tone, still pressing his shoulder with a heavy hand. "Although it's kinda blurry in my head too."
He made a bee-line to his locker, ignoring everything around him, and quickly turned the key to open his locker, making sure he avoided any eye-contact with new boy.
For a moment, Steve pictured himself going home while—metaphorically—slamming the door back on Tony's face and on his romantic dinner. And then he realized Tony would expect him to do
On his first stop to the men's room, after Tony had washed his shaky hands—drugs did that to him sometimes—while avoiding his sickening reflection in the stained mirrors, he felt a strong-willed hand shoving him against the wall.
Steve looked down at him, gritting his teeth. "You know what, Buck? You may have a point..." He said pensively. "I kinda
