he thinks to himself, and follows the group in.
. He follows the smells and voices, follows the strange feeling of home.
Tony opens his eyes again to notice how Steve is looking at his lips and that’s enough to drive him forward. He doesn’t mean to be clumsy about it, in fact in his head it was sophisticated and graceful, but Tony basically falls forward and his lips connect with Steve’s as the other man lets out a soft grunt of surprise before their teeth clash together. It takes only one second on Steve’s part before he’s wrapping his arms around Tony and kissing the man back with an intensity rivaled by a man receiving water after a two-day long trek through the desert.  Like if they stay connected like this, Steve’s hands on Tony’s hips, Tony’s hands around Steve’s neck and their lips caught then they’ll stay rooted to the ground, they won’t float away from exhilaration. Steve pulls him close as Tony finally, finally, runs his hands down his chest. The synapses of Tony’s brain pulling as tight as the threads of Steve’s shirt. One of them is going to rip and Tony prays it’s the shirt because he is dying to see what’s underneath and if his brain breaks then how will he ever know?
Steve makes a small choked sound, as if he can’t quite fit Tony’s words in with the way he feels. Tony gets it. The feeling of failure, of falling short when it means the most to you can create so many lasting scars. But, his words are true, and he senses that Steve knows that, even if he doesn’t fully believe him yet.
Steve watches in awe as Tony’s fingers fly across the slim electronic device. The man worries his lip as he flips through application after application before finding what it is he’s looking for. With a nod and a whispered ‘gotcha’ he tosses the StarkTab, facedown, onto the floor of the vehicle. A blue holographic light is beaming out of the tablet, from a location just below where the camera flash usually sits.
“Let’s have a cup of tea, okay Steve? It will make us both feel better.”
“Yes honeybunches, is it still okay if I call you honeybunches? I’m so bad at everything, well, not engineering and science. I’m bad at people. I suck at everything involving people. Anyway, yes, Peter is great, Ned is great, MJ is great. They’re all great. That’s the problem. They’re all great at midnight on a Friday and I’m fucking exhausted.”
Thanks,
“I just didn’t know how to react. I like you, Steve. I like you a lot. But so… my life… I couldn’t reconcile the fact that I become a father. A real, actual father to Peter. Peter is amazing, he’s fantastic, he’s beautiful. He’s everything, Steve. It just felt like—like, I became a father and my first executive decision was to go develop this huge, nerve wracking crush on one of my son’s favorite teachers. Then I kiss him and it just—“ Tony cuts himself off again. A moment passes while he stares into the distance, this moment seems to stretch longer, it feels heavier. Steve isn’t sure what Tony is about to say, but he knows the man needs to get it out. For better or worse.
“We told you not to use your real-world friends Tony,” Steve chastises, trying to school the expression on his face. “We told you it would be your downfall.”
"This life- with villains and dangerous missions, destruction. It's not place to raise a child." Tony shook his head, more talking to himself than his husband.
"What do you mean? Tomorrow he'll be cleared and ready to go back to the home" Tony replied a bit too casually, turning back to his dresser.
"What- what does this mean, uncle Thor?" Peter asked, and all the attention was on him once again.
The fire rescue team arrived as well as ambulances and police. The fire was eventually put out and while the building was destroyed, their didn't seem to be any casualties.
"You mean-"
He found his husband in the lab, sitting at the lab table where Peter and him had built Benny. Steve walked in and took the seat next to him.
"Clint, you've had a tough week. We won't hold it against you if you can't hold it up" His Dad said, and his pops slapped him lightly for the inappropriate joke and nodded to Peter with a roll of his eyes. Peter only smiled.
"Those boys did a shitty thing, but they’re just children. I don't think we should jus-"
"I-I guess" Peter answered quietly, eyes cast down. Steve put his hand on the boy's knee.
"Stay calm! You're going to be alright" he told the person trapped underneath. He pressed the coms.
Steve’s eyes began to cloud with tears as wrapped Tony in a tight embrace.
"I don't want him to go anywhere but here" Tony's eyes widened.
“We’ll need to research the best schools in the area as well as the best science programs and least reported cases of bullying” Steve’s head whipped at Tony’s words. They made eye contact, and there was a pause.
"The spider child is worthy!" Thor belted, embracing the teen in a bone-crushing hug as the rest of the avengers cheered and clapped.
Dropping off Peter had the home had to be the hardest thing either man ever had to do. And one of them had been frozen in ice for seventy years while the other had literally had his heart ripped out of his chest.
"Hey there" Tony smiled, taking a seat next to Steve.
Peter looked at his dad, who smiled and nodded, then to Thor who grinned and gave him a "be my guest" gesture as he swigged his drink.
They turned back to the young boy in the hospital bed. There was silence, and for the first time that day it was content. Tony spoke up, not looking away from the glass.
Tony noticed that one of them was holding a bat and another had a bruised fist.
"Now, unfortunately this does not mean you now rule Asgard" Peter sighed in relief at that. He was not ready to rule an alien planet.
They tossed the beam a few feet away and waved the dust out of their faces to reveal a tiny boy who was no older than five or six with brown curly hair and big brown eyes, terror etched on his features.
Tony woke to the smell of bacon and smiled. Steve had always loved cooking, but since Peter began staying with him, Steve had cooked almost every meal.
Tony turned back to the hologram and sighed.
"Hey" he said, getting Peter's attention.
Eventually, the party died down and only the people Peter considered family were left chatting and sipping their drinks. Peter sat on the couch above his uncle Clint and Maria and smiled as Clint taunted Thor about his hammer from his position on the floor.
Tony turned to his husband with a grim expression.
"I'll contain the debris and look for civilians on the upper levels. You just get everyone out of there" Tony told him through the coms.
"But I'm still here. So I thought that maybe you were going to adopt me" he mumbled, picking at his pancake as tears streamed down his little face.
Thor cut off Tony, challenging him with a raise of the eyebrows.
"And babe?"
"It's time for you to go home, Pete" Tony gave Peter a tight smile, who stared at them with wide eyes.
Steve sighed as he watched them go. This was going to be a long night.
It was silent for a few more seconds before Steve spoke up.
"And he's here to make you all better. Nothing bad is going to happen, I promise"  Steve gave that charming smile of his which seemed to work in calming the boy down.
"Fine, He can stay for a couple of weeks but then he is going back. I'll send an email to his caretaker in the morning" Tony grumbled, glaring at Steve's smug smile.
"It's okay kid, you're safe now"
"Promise" he replied, holding out his arms.
Without another word, the four boys scrambled away from the thing they were blocking.
"Howard did give you something pretty great" Tony's head snapped up, his features expressing his confusion.
“Tony, a-are you sure?” He asked, placing a hand on his arm. Tony nodded.
He looked up at his husband, eyes wide. He didn't need to say anything as Steve's eyes widened.
Steve rolled his eyes fondly and gave him that pointed 'you can't keep anything from me' look.
"I didn't mean to be bad, I promise! I just wanted to see Mr. Yoki" The boy sniffled as tears pricked at his eyes once more.
But now Peter was fully healed, and there was no reason that he shouldn't return to the group home. And they had no idea how to tell him.
"What is going on here?" The Captain bellowed, causing all of the boys to jump. None of the children said anything, clearly shocked at Iron Man and Captain America walking into their bedroom.
"So you like science?" He asked. Peter perked up and nodded.
‘What about the infinity stones?’ Wade cuts in again. ‘If HYDRA get through to either of them, they’ll know where they all are.’
‘There is nothing more I can ask of you, my friends,’ Thor sighs, ‘nor indeed is there anything more I need from you. I only ask that you ensure you are waiting for us on our return.’
Strange scowls at him. ‘You drive a hard bargain.’ Loki just grins in response and the doctor sighs. ‘Fine, alright. But don’t expect me not to complain about inactivity.’
Love always,
‘On it, Cap,’ the dark skinned man said, shutting his helmet and jumping out the back of the jet. He watches him fly past and out towards the burning spots.
Here’s a sneak peak at chapter 5:
‘Look,’ Quill cuts Rocket off, ‘you want the truth, Rocket? I don’t remember a proper Christmas alright? My mom died when I was young and I got taken by Yondu and his Ravagers and I’ve never celebrated a Christmas since. You know the only things I do remember? Eating so much I couldn’t move, decorating a tree with my mom and her making sure it was the best time of the year.
oblivious?’
The dark haired man turns and there’s a soft smile on his face. ‘Me neither, Cap.’
‘Wait you never actually
‘HYDRA was still able to infiltrate SHIELD,’ Sam points out.
Secondly the whole team is sat in the common area, and it looks like they’ve been waiting to perform some kind of intervention. At least that’s what he understands from Steve’s apologetic look as he walks in the door.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘It’s almost like she doesn’t trust us,’ Tony says as they land outside the Sanctum.
The soldier gives him a small smile. ‘Thanks Tony.’
‘Peace friends!’ Thor says.
‘What are those guys doing here?’ Sam frowns. ‘I thought they were off searching the galaxy for a way to bring Gamora back?’
‘Err maybe the fact that you’re now BFFs with an insane mercenary?’ Ned suggests.
‘You check on everyone else, I’ll go find out what’s going on. Keep an eye on Bucky and Wanda.’ Tony stands up, his Iron Man suit already forming over his body and flies towards the hole in the building just as black clad soldiers swing in through the debris.
‘I know he was talking to his sister,’ the AI responds from the screen in front of him so the others can’t overhear, ‘from information I have I can deduce they were discussing their family business.’
‘I’m on Nebula’s team!’
As always here is your sneak peek:
‘New student who also happens to be my old childhood best friend.’
‘You were dead,’ I tell her
‘It also means he gets first choice in partner for the snowball fight tomorrow,’ Steve reminds them over Sam’s cheers and Valkyrie’s complaints.
‘Yeah it’s at the back on the right,’ Natasha replies. ‘Why?’
‘Does it look successful to you?’ Stark demands, gesturing to where Bucky’s laying.
‘Is this the young man you’ve told me about?’ Mama asks.
‘What is it, honey?’
‘Really? What gave you that idea?’ Tony rolls his eyes. ‘I’m not sure if he’s trying to wind up Bucky more just for the hell of it, or whether it’s just an added bonus to the people he’s naturally drawn to.’
‘Sergeant Barnes you are now out of the game,’ FRIDAY’s voice says.
‘You look happier Barnes,’ she comments, noticing the lessening of the tension in his shoulders and face, and a little more of a spark behind his eyes.
‘Hello?’ the voice of Peter’s aunt fills his workshop.
‘No trouble,’ the second one says, brandishing a gun and pointing it in Wanda’s direction, ‘little witch here doesn’t have her magic so can’t stop this bullet. You give us any trouble and her pretty little brains will be decorating the wall.’
‘Come see me anytime kid,’ he replies with a smile, then leaves him to his cleaning as he walks out the door. ‘And thank you,’ he says quietly once he’s left the training room.
A/N: All I can say is: I'm sorry and I love you all.
‘And?’
He nods. ‘Yeah, I was just wondering if I could get your advice on something?’
‘Nope I don’t think they are either. You guys ready for a fight?’ Tony looks at the two wizards.
He feels Bucky’s confusion and dawning understanding through the link.
‘Yeah,’ Bucky sounds distracted as Sam turns to look at his friend.
There’s quiet for a few moments as they finish getting their stuff together, as they head towards the doors Peter adds a thought. ‘Maybe that’s because, even back then, you still held on to some of you.’
The next morning Loki announces he feels recovered enough to be able to transport Thor and Valkyrie to a location where they would be able to get a ship and travel the rest of the way to Nidi- whatever the place where the cool stuff was made was called. Honestly Tony’s head hurts enough recently without trying to remember all the weird and wonderful names for places Thor comes out with.
my Captain,’ Steve frowns. ‘We’ve been temporarily assigned to his squad until we’re ready for active duty again. But I’m not going anywhere until Bucky’s alright. At this rate,’ Steve pauses and swallows past the lump in his throat.
‘I would have thought the imminent invasion was more pressing than the boy’s sexual preferences.’
Steve’s face says he’s trying to find a safer topic to steer the conversation towards. ‘Peter seems to be getting on well with the team.’
‘Tony, shh, calm down,’ Steve moves to sit on the bed, he takes Tony’s left hand in both of his and rubs soothing circles on the back of it. ‘Come on, honey, calm down for me.’
‘No,’ he replies.
Steve’s actually quite happy with that.
A/N: So Deadpool has now been accepted into the team for Christmas. I hope you enjoyed the first bit of Spideypool action everyone :)
‘Well this is what happens when you set up competitions,’ Rhodes laughs, taking a seat next to the girl.
‘Cut the crap,’ she says, and Wade’s mouth shuts with an audible snap. ‘Tells us everything you suspect Wade or I’m turning this jet around and cancelling the mission.’
them that,’ the soldier sounds amused, but exasperated.
Love always,
‘Slander and lies!’ Wade protests. ‘The door just magically opened and I tripped on my way out.’
Bucky nods, leaning against the tunnel wall. ‘Apparently Tony’s comms aren’t working, and even FRIDAY can’t get through. I imagine she would have alerted Nat by now at the very least.’
‘What do you think old Tin Can is going to do?’ Deadpool asks.
The memories then go in reverse chronological order, back up to when he first got possessed.
‘I wouldn’t be surprised if she still doesn’t,’ Tony laughs, ‘plus we need to work out how we’re going to decorate that monstrosity Bucky won.’
‘What the hell?’ they look up to see Sam standing in the doorway with a shocked look on his face. ‘What have you two been doing?’
‘He has too much energy,’ May moans.
Bucky’s just glad that he can feel Loki’s as flustered as he is.
‘What are you-’ he’s cut off by Steve pressing a quick kiss to his lips.
‘Why?’
‘Just answer the question, Steve,’ Tony tries very hard not to snap. ‘Please?’ He adds in a softer tone.
‘Not far from the border in Sokovia,’ is Shuri’s answer.
But Steve’s favourite thing about the training room is really rather simple. Ever since he’d met Bucky back when they were snot-nosed kids running around the Brooklyn back streets – ok so Bucky had been running and Steve had been wheezing along behind him – he’d always wished he could keep up with the brunette. All he’d ever wanted was to make him proud in a fight, and not have to be picked up and dusted off from the floor. Now he’s able to hold his own against the other man. He’s even bested him a couple of times.
Peter chuckles. ‘I imagine it won’t be as bad as the one Nat would give me when I got back.’ He shifts nervously on his chair. ‘It’s not going to hurt is it?’
‘What?’
‘Tony messaged me to say you’re to meet the team at the UN,’ Fury answers.
Quill looks out the window and gestures to Sam that it’s all clear. ‘Ready?’
‘School trip to MOMA.’
‘Does it matter?’
‘Gah!’ he stumbles backwards, and would have fallen back out of the window had a laughing Tony not come up behind him and caught him.
‘The mental link,’ he waves his hand dismissively, ‘Bucky’s side was panicked, or as close to panicked as he can get, and then it went quiet. Unfortunately, it’s taken me longer than it should to realise it was
‘Yeah cause those legal guardian forms I found printed are not just in case May ever lets you have joint custody,’ Steve chuckles.
Strange is quiet for a few moments. ‘I do not believe that will happen, Peter,’ he answers. ‘If you were able to fight off his direct influence, I do not doubt you will be able to fight against this other influence you speak of. In my opinion I would say that it is only due to your physical and mental exhaustion that you have had such large swings in personality. As you become stronger these will become less.’
you giving him the death glare?’
‘When Tony was a kid he didn’t have the best relationship with his dad, but he told me one drunken night at MIT that the one thing they would be able to bond over was when Howard would tell him stories about you.’
because he’ll want to show how much he managed to pull the wool over my eyes. Come on, Nat, you’ll be there with me. Steve can wait outside the whole time. Fifteen minutes that’s all I ask.’
‘You are looking tired, brother.’
This presents another problem.
‘But… but I’m… well…
‘Alright I think we’re far enough away,’ he says, leaning up against the wall.
‘Not at all,’ he answers as they go to join the others at the chairs around the tree.
‘I remember Uncle Gabe being really quiet,’ Tony’s eyes are a little unfocussed as he looks back in time, ‘but I remember him being really serious for once that day. When Aunt Peggy was yelling at this guy he kneels down next to me, points at her and says to me “promise me something, Teddy”-’
‘But how did you manage this, Tony?’
‘Peter I just don’t think you’re in the right place mentally to be trying something like this right now,’ Sam argues.
Loki allows himself a small smile. ‘I know I am only here because of my brother’s request to you, you don’t have to pretend there is any other reason for it,’ despite his best intentions there’s a note of insecurity in his voice.
There’s a long pause and Clint’s about to call through again when he gets a response. ‘I’m going to have to take the braces off. Once I reach my suit it can act as the brace, but it means I’m going to need you to pull me through most of the way.’
‘What are you doing?’ Natasha asks him.
‘Oh come on! These kids say worse on a daily basis.’
‘You saying Loki doesn’t deserve to be happy? After he’s the reason this team was formed in the first place? After trying to take over New York?’
Tony lets the helmet melt away from his face, smiling at her in relief. ‘Thanks to you we are. Steve? You alright, babe?’
‘Did you actually breathe in any of that?’ Tony asks.
‘You’re Francis,’ Peter realises how much of a mistake he may have just made.
‘You are not helping,’ Loki can practically hear the scowl in Steve’s voice. The occupants of the kitchen have gone silent to listen to the exchange as they continue their tasks.
‘You’re unnaturally quiet, kid,’ Tony comments as they weave through the New York rush hour, heading towards the outskirts. ‘What’s up?’
‘Do you always argue this much?’ a weak voice asks from the doorway. ‘You’re as bad as Thor.’
‘One it doesn’t take a genius to work out you’d be worried, despite those two only having found out because they were part of your ‘bestie’ group and were spending more time around you anyway-’
‘Guys not now,’ Bruce groans. ‘Where is this farmhouse anyway?’
‘Well I suppose that really depends on what he classes as ‘enhanced abilities’ doesn’t it?’ the third woman, who Tony thinks is the one called Val, adds. She turns to the camera. ‘Just to remind all of our viewers that Secretary Ross is proposing legislation that means anyone with enhanced abilities must register with the United States Government, he says as a way to ensure the safety of the individuals as well as the general public. It would mean everyone on the Avengers team would need to register, as well as several of the vigilantes we see around the country. Ross himself named some of the vigilantes he’s be working to find the identities of, including Spider-Man, Daredevil and Deadpool. That’s just in New York alone.’
‘Not if you were listening to Wanda’s plans for decorations for the front door,’ Sam laughs as he supervises the two soldiers moving the huge tree between them.
‘Ugh really?’ Peter rolls his eyes. ‘You’re as bad as my family. I haven’t got my eye on anyone, Pool, so no I haven’t asked anyone out. Besides who’d want to date Spider-Man? I spend the majority of my free time swinging around a city stopping crime, not exactly great advertising for a partner is it?’
‘No, but we know it’s most likely going to kill you. And I’ve not yet found a method that’ll fucking stick so chances are I’ll be fine. Now give it to me.’
‘Come on Petey give me my ham and pineapple!’ he hears the mercenary’s voice floating along the corridor.
The light gets so blinding that even those fighting around them stop and shield their eyes. As Thanos gets to within striking distance of the two women, the gauntlet explodes, throwing everyone within its radius backwards, and the stones fly off in different directions.
‘He’s given so much for us,’ she hears Bruce sigh as they watch the Wakandan ship disappear into the distance. ‘I just hope he feels it is worth it.’
‘Can it do you permanent damage?’ she asks.
‘So if we were to go ahead with this new proposal,’ Natasha says, ‘and this is only an “if” for now, raise your hand if you are happy for Nick to be one of the three leadership team.’ The majority of the table raise their hands, only Strange, Wong and Loki don’t.
After four days of staking out the lab with the two men Natasha was ready to throttle both of them. Either they’re making stupid adolescent jokes that even Peter wouldn’t consider making, or they’re at each other’s throats and she’s having to stop one from killing or maiming the other.
‘No,’ Steve’s the one who interrupts. ‘We leave it until he brings it up. If he doesn’t want to do what Fury wants, then he doesn’t have to. We made it clear this was his time to have a break from everything super-hero related, if we bring it up he’ll feel pressured to do something.’
She nods. ‘He and T’Challa thought it was better to have one of us here in case everything goes south fast. Bucky told Steve in their last phone call that he was worried he wasn’t going to make the deadline, but he said you weren’t telling him exactly how long you have left.’
‘So what nonsense you going to get us to repeat Stevie?’ Bucky asks, checking over his gun as they stand in front of their assembled army, waiting and watching for the alien horde to start pouring from the trees in front of them.
‘Tony told me.’
‘Five minutes apparently,’ she raises an eyebrow. ‘Either there’s a lot of stuff here or your program is getting slow.’
He grins and passes her the basket. ‘I still owe you for that by the way.’
Peter sighs. ‘Yeah I understand sir. I’m really sorry I’ve not been as focussed as normal. I promise I’ll be better. Is there any chance you can wait until tomorrow to send the note to Aunt May? I’d like to be able to tell her myself tonight if that’s alright?’
‘Agreed,’ the other two nod.
‘You always used to tell me to fight dirty!’
Loki smiles and shakes his head. ‘No it was not. I must admit to much preferring this way of doing things.’
‘Really? No space? You’ve seen the size of this tower right?’
‘You didn’t have that in the report you sent to Fury. I would have thought phobias brought on by torture were a big no-no when it comes to members of superhero squads.’
‘Loki is there anything that might be able to help the process?’ Thor asks him.
‘He’s not at the facility, boss.’
Tony rolls his eyes. ‘I said in the report that if we are able to eliminate the possibility of him being controlled by outside forces then, yes, he could become a full member of the team.’
The sound that reverberates through every person on the battlefield is nothing like the thundering rumble that accompanies the Bifrost that had been heard just now. Loki looks up and feels every drop of warmth drain from his body despite the blistering African sun.
‘So Steve is my next babysitter? Poor you, Rogers,’ he snarks as the Captain walks into his hospital room.
Peter had gone to stay with his aunt the day after Yule so he could celebrate with May, her new partner Stewart, and their baby girl before coming back here for Christmas. If he was phoning at a time when he was usually asleep there had to be something wrong. ‘Pete?’ he presses the phone to his ear. ‘You alright? Has something happened? You’re not supposed to be back until Christmas Eve, did you need me to pick you up?’
Peter just groans.
Peter tries to unfreeze his muscles. He knows that voice, but he can’t quite place it. ‘Uh sure thing. Do you want to take my arm?’
‘Alright,’ Wade’s tone is placating. ‘Do you want me to check or-’
want to kill you?’ Tony asks.
they are or
the guy, I’m saying take the plunge and have the relationship. Even if it’s only when you’re here on Earth. Even
‘Well how about you ride up front with me?’
‘Yes, Mr Stark?’
‘”They” being your buddies the Avengers I assume?’
‘Oh now we need more information,’ Sam says, putting his cutlery down, and Steve gives him and Bucky his best ‘Captain America’ stare, but it doesn’t faze them one bit. ‘Is she cute? Is there just one? It’s not a crazy cat lady is it?’
‘Let me see it!’ Natasha laughs, doubling over at the picture of Loki’s helmet sporting a more reindeer antler design than the usual sleek ones.
‘Really?’ he laughs, then scowls at Steve. ‘Stop spoiling my fun.’
‘What did he say?’ the blond looks at Peter with a frown. The teenager looks wide-eyed between Thor and Loki and then just shrugs and shoves a bread roll in his mouth.
‘Baby Boy?’
‘No, doc, I don’t think I would. I miss some of my friends there, but I’ve got a home here.’
‘You moved in with the Avengers?’ Harry asks, eyebrows disappearing into his hairline. ‘That is amazing. How did you manage that?’
It had all been said in Thor’s usual jovial tone, and the smile had never left his face. Yet Bucky can’t help but feel slightly scared, even though he doesn’t have the faintest idea what Thor is talking about.
‘Hey, you going to introduce us or what?’ MJ hisses.
‘Yeah he’s actually pretty good at them when he wants to be,’ Tony adds.
Tony gives him a smile and walks up to him, bringing him into a tight hug. ‘Of course I did, kid.’
Peter leaves the room feeling like he just wants to hit his head against the wall.
‘Alright kid I got a window for you. Nat? Line him up,’ Tony’s voice comes over the speakers.
‘What do you think’s happened?’ Peter asks.
‘What is it, Tony?’
kind of answer to that threat other than a team that can only pick up the fight once the threat
‘Out the front. Here I’ll grab the top, if you could grab the bottom?’
Fury, Loki and his council have worked together to come up with a form of alliance between Jotunheim and the Avengers, so both parties are willing to help where necessary; once Thor returns Bucky suspects they shall do something similar with Asgard. When the three Jotuns had learned of the threat Thanos posed they were more than happy to lend their support and assured both Fury and Loki of the rest of their people’s cooperation.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Hey guys, mind if I stay with you on this trip? I’m getting a bit fed up of Flash’s comments,’ she admits, with a shy smile at Ned.
‘Nat,’ Sam pleads, ‘don’t.’
‘Spider-Man?’
‘It’s the first time I’ve said it. Don’t tell her until we’re on the plane.’
Peter laughs again, then goes quiet and bites his lip. ‘What if I have a nightmare again and FRIDAY can’t wake me up?’
‘I usually do, there’s no need to sound so disappointed,’ Loki sounds defensive.
‘Where’s your friend? He turn himself into a toad?’
‘No,’ Peter shakes his head, forgetting the man can’t see. ‘No I wouldn’t expect you to do that Mr Murdock. I just… I remembered what you said about your abilities and thought perhaps you’d be able to find something out that the rest of us couldn’t. You’d be looking for things we wouldn’t think to look for- uh figuratively speaking of course – and you might have more luck than we will.’
‘What shall we do about the three bodies?’ Wong asks.
‘He’s never been very good at leaving valuable trinkets behind,’ Thor chuckles hoarsely. ‘The fool.’
‘Ouch,’ Bucky says, rubbing his hand. ‘You’ve got a good grip kid.’
Wade runs a hand over his bald head, still not looking up as he answers. ‘Look I don’t know anything for certain, Cap, but if it’s what I think it is I can’t have Pete anywhere near it.’
‘Bucky-’
‘Well…some of them can be a little…grabby?’
’ Bucky demands, leaning back with a groan. ‘Oh god what did that punk do this time?’
Flash stares Harry down for a bit longer, but Peter knows from experience that nothing can beat the Osborne stare, and eventually he turns and leaves, glaring at the two of them as he goes to take his seat.
‘And security?’ the assassin asks, raising an eyebrow.
‘Can you teach me how to fight with staves? The Doc has this awesome one in a cabinet and I don’t think I could fight with it like a normal weapon, but it’d be cool to learn. Could you teach me?’
you!’
‘You wanted to see me, sir?’ he asks the Headmaster.
‘Oh good,’ Quill says, joining the group, ‘I was just going to see if there were any judging volunteers. Strange has said he’ll judge too. Everyone else has to take part! Apart from Rhodes because he’s doing the music.’
I say and do while I’m here. From knowing exactly which team member is walking up behind me when I haven’t turned around because each of you has a special tone in my spidey-sense, to being careful about the jokes I use talking with you because I can’t say anything that might have people twig that we patrol together, to even being careful how much I carry in the labs. If I go and work in the workshop with Tony I can’t lift half the stuff I normally do because they don’t think I can. I can’t call Nat “Mommy Spider” while they’re around because they might guess at why I call her that. It’s not about being ashamed of any of my relationships with any of the team,
‘No idea,’ Valkyrie sighs, ‘I don’t really know what all the fuss is about, to be honest. He’s never been that bad ever since I’ve known him.’
‘Alright, let’s get you both on the jet and get home,’ Natasha sighs, shaking her head, ‘Steve was having kittens. You’re lucky he hasn’t arrived out here yet.’
‘I’m surprised he didn’t put you in a bright green one or something,’ Steve laughs. Then groans as he sees the announcer for the evening take to the stage. His friend nudges his shoulder.
‘That was awesome!’ Ned says. ‘And terrifying. Please don’t do that again.’
‘A week and a half?’ he asks quietly. He looks back to Vision. ‘Is it enough time?’
to what it’ll be like!’ he explodes.
‘You’re what?’ he blinks in surprise.
‘Trust me, we’re not. You’ve not seen her take someone out with her
‘Mine is what?’ he asks, taking the basket she offers. There’s a small whining sound coming from inside and it is, indeed, moving.
‘Yeah, yeah, fine,’ he pants as he manages to find his feet and tries to put some distance between him and his opponent. His brain is spinning and he can’t place things like he had been. Where was Vision? Where were the rest of the team? He can’t place things like he had and he moves his head around trying to catch on to
‘You want him you go through us first,’ Tony growls. ‘What do you want with Loki?’
The soldier blushes and clears his throat. ‘There, uh, there may have been a situation last time where someone pissed me off and I may have won a giant tree.’
Tony doesn’t finish his sentence, and his face is getting closer to Steve’s; the soldier can feel his heart hammering in his chest, and his breath catches slightly as Tony’s eyes start to close. Just as Steve begins to close his own he feels Tony tense in his arms and pull away.
‘Thought you said this would be simple?’ Clint’s voice comes through the comms. ‘And I quote Cap: “It’ll be simple. Find Thanos, take him by surprise, get the stones and bring everyone back.” This is not simple, Cap. We need to have a conversation about what the word “simple” means.’
let it go ahead.
‘Hey! I’m not
‘We would if we knew,’ Ned tells him.
‘Am not,’ he huffs, and consciously relaxes so he
‘I say stick with your plan, Widow,’ he answers, ‘and we’ll lay the explosives, but you leave me in there while you get out with the information. Once the truck has left I’ll start causing some mayhem and keeping the attention on me; then you guys can come back in if you want, or just focus on sniping the guards on the outside. Then I’ll come and join you.’
The tension eases in the room and the archer turns on his heel, grinning to respond to Natasha’s reply to his comment without another look at Wade. Peter, Tony notices, doesn’t relax until the archer has sat down, and still keeps his eye on the man.
Rhodey, Sam, Vision and Wanda joined,’ Natasha agrees. ‘Nick we got air support any time soon? Sam, Rhodey and Tony can’t do it all by themselves for much longer.’
‘Go Steve!’ Tony shoves his partner forward. ‘Sam and I’ll catch up.’
Unfortunately everyone is then slightly apprehensive to try the spaghetti bolognaise he’s made.
‘I would have
a date you wouldn’t have the mask on, so the question’s kind of moot really.’
Love always,
‘Well,’ Hope pauses, obviously trying to find the best way of phrasing what she wants to say, before continuing, ‘the new Accords are going to make it more likely that other enhanced individuals will want to join the team right?’
time, Nat, yes I am sure. Now stop trying to get me to change my mind and no,’ he cuts her off with a grin, ‘I don’t want you to come with me. I’ll be

Loki laughs. ‘Don’t worry Valkyrie, Thor hates them as much as you do, there’s no way he’ll be bringing
Steve sees it. A figure holding up a rocket launcher, a split second before it fires. ‘Get down!’ he grabs her round the waist and pulls them both down under the desk, his shield blocking the gap.
‘Hang on do we all have different coffee blends?’ he asks, Natasha walks in at that moment and shoots him a worried glance.
‘Fine,’ the sorcerer waves his hand in dismissal, ‘Peter has been helping me research.’
Do let me know what you think of these two chapters. I hope you enjoyed them.
There’s quite a few raised eyebrows in the morning when they explain to the team they’re keeping the link. But since they provide some logical reasoning no one really questions it. And if Bucky ignores Steve’s overly questioning glance, well no one other than Loki need really know, and luckily the trickster is kind enough not to question him.
Steve could have sworn he sees the sheen of tears in her eyes before she blinks and straightens up. ‘Get him to the jet.
‘We like to call it the Wakandan Accords,’ Nick says with a smile. ‘It’s a similar principle to the Sokovian Accords, but places the team outside of the control of the countries of the world and instead under the leadership of a trio of individuals; certain restrictions will be put in place when it comes to performing missions of course, but it gives the team more freedom than it has now to answer threats.’
earlier.’
Steve face palms at the identical grins that appear on Bucky and Sam’s faces, and Peter looks torn between running away from the table and wanting to finish his food.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Nat you’re distracting Peter from his homework, let me do my tasks in peace.’
‘Already on it boss. Arrival is estimated in five minutes.’
‘Yeah Pool said the same thing,’ Peter says as the man sits back down. He mouths the vigilante’s name at him and sees the scowl through the mask but ignores him. ‘He’s going to check out a couple of the sites when we’ve finished here.’
Wade laughs. ‘If you’re still having that reaction in a couple of months’ time I’ll be a happy man.’
,’ the dark haired man counters.
‘I lost my temper,’ Bucky admits. ‘I’m sorry you had to see that, kid.’ He curses as the sound of footsteps getting closer reach them. ‘Ned can you get Peter to safety? I’ve got a spare comms, put it on,’ he hands it to Peter. ‘Let us know where you are and someone will pick you up.’
‘Come now, toots,’ she laughs, ‘you should know by now that’s not going to work.’
‘Who are you?’ the archer asks.
It feels like a test. Tony looks up at him. ‘I’ve changed.’
‘Across the street, building on the corner, fifteenth floor,’ Clint shouts to him as he jumps to his feet. ‘Saw the light reflect off the gun.’
‘We’ll be there soon Jedi Master!’ Wade calls back, getting up off the bed and running to the bathroom. ‘I call shot gun on shower!’
‘Then,’ Peter swallows back tears at the thought, ‘then Venom was right wasn’t he? He has left a part of him in me that means I’m going to act like him. Get angry more.’ He pulls his hands away and puts them in his lap, refusing to look up at Strange. ‘What if I end up like him?’ he asks quietly. ‘What if he ends up taking me over in a different way?’
‘Mr Stark!’ Peter rolls his eyes. ‘I’m not an
‘You mean there’s someone here who is still stupid enough to try and inflate your ego,’ Rhodes says as he enters behind them and makes his way to the kitchenette. They have a bigger kitchen and dining area elsewhere, but Tony had made sure a small one had been included here as well. Not because he was lazy of course.
He wipes away a couple of stray tears and nods. ‘Yeah, yeah I’m fine.’
‘What?!?’ Peter shouts, nearly jumping out of Wade’s grip as everyone laughs and turns back to what they were saying. ‘Why would you do that?’
It was Friday. They had one week before their deadline was up but since they watched Bucky’s memory of killing his parents they hadn’t made any progress. Vision said it was as if Bucky’s brain was fighting back against them. They couldn’t get further than the third trigger word before his body would start reacting and he’d lash out. Tony had a black eye and split lip to prove it. He’d just got back from one of Ross’ summons and had had a lot of fun trying to convince the council his injuries were due to an accident during training with one of the bots going a bit haywire.
‘I just-’
They jump apart as if they’ve been electrocuted and Wade takes his turn, hitting the cue ball maybe a little harder than necessary. They continue the game, not saying much to each other but sending a couple of glares across the pool table. They end the game and Peter wins, marginally, to a chorus of cheers from the surrounding mercs and offers for another game.
ready to face that,’ Steve mutters, but allows Tony to lead him to the bathroom.
‘I’m still annoyed we had to miss your face,’ Natasha says as Sam flies her in through the open window.
‘I shall need to replace Mjolnir,’ Thor adds. ‘Valkyrie and I shall head to Nidavellir when Loki is recovered enough to help us; he’s used to travelling the universe in ways no one else is. There we shall be able to get a weapon that can kill Thanos.’ He turns to Tony and Steve. ‘I must ask a large favour from you my friends.’
they’re involved in how can I know to leave if I stumble on something?’
‘Just forget it Steve. It’s not something you needed to know. I shouldn’t have said it. I’m-’
‘On it, boss,’ his AI responds. It doesn’t take long for Fury’s face to fill the screen.
‘You say that like I have a cattle prod I can just poke it with or something. It’s not like I have a taser like Nat- oh wait! Taser webs!’
‘The other king,’ Steve picks up the story, ‘is the Iron King, and he has made so many different ways of protecting those he loves that the Golden King doesn’t even need to worry about facing anyone, for he knows no one can get past the shields that the Iron King has put in place.’
‘Guys?’ Clint’s worried voice comes through. ‘Please tell me you’re alright.’
‘Oh, what like you do by holding back in training?’ Peter turns round to stare down the other man. He feels the tension spike in the room, Bucky’s expression closes down.
‘Wilson,’ Natasha comes out of the kitchen, flicking her hair back as she takes in the mercenary.
‘Come on Widow you just don’t want to admit that I’m a better shot than you,’ Bucky’s cocky grin has Natasha’s eyes narrowing and Rhodes knows he’s in trouble now.
Spider-Man.’
Hope you enjoyed this chapter, do let me know what you think.
Peter looks over at his boyfriend and narrows his eyes. ‘Wade Wilson I swear to god if you did what I think you did you are in so much trouble.’
‘I’m not
‘Agreed,’ Rhodes cuts across Tony’s response. ‘We’ll see you the day after tomorrow.’
‘He’s still a kid,’ Sam argues with a frown.
‘Alright,’ Natasha agrees, and Peter sees her give Tony a concerned look over the top of Steve’s head. He wonders if the comment Bruce had made about his different futures had upset the soldier more than he was willing to admit. ‘Come on boys, let’s go.’
from your king, Lorena,’ he tells her. Tony can see the indecision on her face until she nods.
Next time she’s going to let them kill each other. Wade’ll come back and she’ll be able to keep her promise to Pete.
‘What?’ that was certainly not the answer he’d been expecting.
‘My lips are sealed,’ he sniggers. ‘Good luck with Steve. You’ll need help.’
‘Why are you giving Strange the death glare?’ Sam sighs as he comes to sit next to him.
‘Careful you great oaf! I can’t seem to get the glamour back on so you’ll have to avoid touching me or you’ll get a nasty case of frostbite.’
‘Pete we just want to try and protect you-’
‘So what happened to make him silent if this is nothing worse than he’s faced before?’ May demands, arms crossed over her chest.
‘What did he do the project on?’ Bucky asks. Steve has to look away before he starts laughing, and he hears Wanda sniggering behind them.
‘This whole team needs a fucking therapist,’ Tony sighs, with a half laugh.
. Sighing she stops and holds out her hand. ‘Wanda Maximoff.’
‘What for?’ the genius sounds genuinely confused.

be fine if we work together.’
had to have changed; it’s not like Bruce trusts people easily.’
Rumlow blinks, obviously caught off guard, but he recovers quickly. ‘Oh of course, I’m sorry I shouldn’t have assumed. Perhaps we could work in shifts so there are always three people around you? Between the seven of us it would be a simple thing to organise.’
Peter groans and lets his head fall onto the table. Of course Tony would pull something like that.
Loki is about to respond to thank the man for housing them when the sound of sparks interrupts him and a portal opens in the room. ‘Oh good, my favourite person is arriving.’
‘I did.’
‘You don’t seem to have done as well as you thought, little spider,’ Francis crows from over Bucky’s shoulder. ‘So, I think we’ll be taking you to add to our little collection. How I am going to love breaking Wade by having him fight you.’
‘My team,’ Tony answers quietly. ‘I suspected they went with you to Wakanda. I never asked because if I had it confirmed and Ross found out I’d never have been able to keep the changes made to the Accords. At least I knew they were safe.’
A/N: Hi everyone. I hope you're still enjoying this instalment, now the team is back together they may be able to make more progress on finding their missing members!
She shakes her head. ‘No, it’s something else.’
‘How many people with superpowers do you think there are?’ he retorts.
‘He’s taken down supervillains, is dating a mercenary, and he’s helped prevent the end of the universe. That argument doesn’t hold with me. I’ll see most of you tomorrow,’ and with that Fury ends the call.
‘Indeed, I have just speaking with Fury. The Avengers should be there by late afternoon, we hope to arrive a little before them.’ He notices the conflict in her eyes. ‘What is it?’
‘He’s not anymore, Ned,’ he argues as they get closer to the main doors. ‘I swear, he wants to change.’
‘Not without someone to catch you, you crazy kid!’ Peter laughs again. Then he looks to Wade. ‘Hey Wade! You gonna catch or what? We’ve had enough practise!’
‘Stop moving!’ he shouts as the platform tips dangerously again, and he sees the blond scrambling back. The best way of doing this is for Steve to make his way to the centre of the platform as Peter lets go and sacrifices himself to the mud, but he’ll be damned if he’s breaking his perfect record. He
‘We got enhanced weaponry here, guys,’ Tony’s voice comes through the speakers. ‘Nat, Wanda keep an eye out. Steve, try not to lose your shield this time.’
‘Alright let’s go. I think they want to cut the cake. Plus there’s at least one more present waiting for you.’
‘It’s just,’ Peter takes a deep breath and looks up, ‘it gets so
‘My girlfriend at the time,’ he explains, ‘Vanessa. Anyway someone found out about my military history and the fix I was in and offered me a way out. I was… pretty desperate at the time so I signed up. Let Vanessa think I was going somewhere to die without putting her through it. It was… not entirely legal.’
‘Give me mine.’
‘Steve ants are here now! I’m setting them on the guys by the door. Run!’ Scott shouts.
Peter laughs. ‘Yeah how about no? I have no sense of rhythm at all, trust me you do not want to see me trying to dance.’
‘Oh yeah she did that to me,’ Tony laughs as he enters the room behind Peter. ‘Just give her a minute.’
He caves. He tells him all about the phone call and Tony’s reaction and the new safety measures he’s put in place during patrols. He even confides his own fears about what Hammer could do to the inventor and why he wants him, how he’s now linked to HYDRA, how he’d been interested in Bucky. Everything.
‘Because none of the drivers have been women so far, so I’ll stand out; and if it
‘You’ve really forgiven me haven’t you?’ there’s a tinge of awe in the soldier’s voice.
‘You know all that from looking at his face?’ Peter asks. ‘Took me months to work out he wasn’t a complete nut case!’
‘For once he didn’t,’ Sam defends him as he heads to the fridge.
As always here's your sneak peek:
‘Nat, Tony we need to speed it up,’ he tells them.
‘Says the man who’s still stood here nagging me when I already said I was busy.’
‘Right, and there were clauses put in for those who wanted to keep their identity hidden,’ she continues, ‘but I don’t think you guys have really thought much about
Those words cause fury to course through Loki. ‘No, you don’t,’ he spits back. ‘You belong to no-one but yourself.’
‘I’ll fly,’ he says as he enters, stepping out of the suit and letting it fold up behind him. ‘Close the door FRIDAY.’
Bucky puts a hand to his chest, feigning hurt. ‘Steve it’s like you don’t trust me.’
Loki laughs at the pout on his brother’s face at Peter’s comment. ‘Why don’t we let either Bucky or Sam make the decision? They have no prior opinion either way.’
‘Not currently,’ Strange frowns, noticing the piece of hair in front of his eyes is moving seemingly of its own accord.
‘You are Bucky!’ she screeches in his ear as he tries to throw her off. ‘You are! You taught me to do this! You’re the one who stays up with me when I can’t sleep and Peter’s not at the facility. You’re the one that refuses to wake me up anymore after I threw an alarm clock at you one morning.
‘Go to bed, Tony,’ Rhodes says.
Tony flies out the jet, and Peter doesn’t get much chance to see where they are before Natasha’s closed the door again.

‘Have you told him yet?’ she asks quieter.
‘Nope, now!’
knows how to find a way to control either of them it’s HYDRA. Let’s not forget that Francis, also working for them, now knows it’s possible to cross dimensions. We don’t know if he’s worked out how to do it, and if he has, they could have more than one Wanda with them. And the other Wanda might not be sunshine and rainbows like our one is. Point is we don’t
They continue to try and hold a conversation, though it’s often interrupted with reassurances to Bucky as his torture continues. Loki’s grip on the chair steadily increases, until a small hand takes hold of one of his and squeezes it in reassurance. He smiles at Natasha in thanks, trying not to let Bucky know how much these sessions affect him in turn.
She closes her mouth and nods, giving him a small smile. ‘You’re welcome.’
‘Me next! Me next!’ she says, as Peter takes hold of her and swings her backwards and forwards a few times before passing her to the mercenary.
‘Most people have bet on Valkyrie,’ Steve sighs and shakes his head.
‘-Nat and I talked,’ Sam interrupts him.
‘Nice to see you out and about, Sergeant Barnes,’ Tony says, looking down the table at them, ‘I hope the arm is working well?’
Tony tries to keep his muscles from freezing up. ‘You’d have to look in Mom’s areas for those, Pete. Dad didn’t have many of me out. Not towards the end anyway.’
‘We’ve got big trouble heading our way,’ Tony explains before he can get a word in, ‘of the universe ending kind by the sounds of it. Peter here seems to think you may be of some help; and considering you helped save my life, I might be inclined to agree if you manage to behave yourself.’
‘Fine,’ Bruce waves, ‘let Carol have it.’
I hope you enjoyed this chapter with a bit more of a focus on the sibling relationship between Wanda and Peter. Do let me know what you think.
‘You a mind-reader now or something?’
‘What?’ Bruce leaps to his feet and comes over. ‘Tony, but… you can take it out again right?’
A/N: So finally some Spideypool action! Sorry I know it's taken a while for the relationship side of this story to really take off. Now all we have to do is get Tony back and the Stony can take off.
‘We…we had to attach each neuron non-sequentially,’ Bruce explains, as if that answers everything.
When he passes Tony the next bag of popcorn Steve notices the relaxed smile on the inventor’s face. ‘He means a lot to you doesn’t he?’
One of the men nods, he’s one who has been steadiest on his feet, a new arrival from the sounds of it. ‘I can.’
‘Oh I’m meeting someone for dinner in a bit,’ Peter replies, looking at his watch and seeing it’s six thirty. ‘I should probably make a move soon.’
‘Thor! By the Allfathers! What happened to you?’
Except when Tony had asked Steve that question he’d just been answered with a raised eyebrow, fond smile and shake of the head. So he’s not entirely sure
‘Pete, didn’t you want to go out on patrol tonight?’ May comes in and asks, tying her hair back in preparation for cooking food. ‘Ned did you want to wait with me for him to get back and have dinner?’
‘Sure thing, boss. And boss? Looks like we’ve got another truck incoming. This one is heading for the courtroom.’
‘You’re kidding!’
Peter curses softly, then his eyes go wide at the look on the Captain’s face. ‘I’m sorry, Captain sir. Um, I left my bag back in my locker, I’m really sorry. I’ll run and get it now and be back in a few minutes. I promise.’
Honestly? Natasha is
‘Fuck me,’ Bucky says. ‘What the fuck are you doing here?’
‘That’s what got you into the little spider’s pants is it?’
‘Where did you want to go now?’ she asks, as they pause on a bridge crossing a small stream, the trees around them are filled with fairy lights and there’s no one else around.
‘Alright, I promise.’
‘Or I could take both of you up there and you could both get on the jet and get to safety,’ Deadpool growls, but reaches under his mask to put the link in his own ear.
‘Where have you been getting all this information?’ Bruce frowns.
‘I can’t be certain that the magic from my Asgardian form would not negate any of her abilities and would rather not take the risk. Encasing someone in a block of ice is not going to go down well with anyone here and is going to do nothing to encourage them to trust me, no matter how accidental it might have been.’
‘Shut up and put this shirt on. Now go get ready so I can make myself look so attractive my boyfriend won’t let me stay at the party.’
‘Tony you are stopping this right now or I’m telling Pepper.’
‘Who else can we call?’ Steve asks, rubbing his temples where a headache is beginning to form.
‘Miss Romanov do you think there is a chance Justin Hammer may escape justice?’
Tony raises a hand in farewell, smiling at the warm feeling in his chest every time Peter calls him that.
Bucky bursts out laughing and Steve’s head falls to the table. ‘Of course,’ he grumbles. ‘Damn jerks.’ When he’s recovered enough from his embarrassment, he lifts his head and asks, ‘what else you do remember about them, Tony?’
She smiles and nods. ‘I think you’re right, but just, I don’t know, write him an advice letter or something just in case. He’ll doubt his ability to follow in your footsteps, you know that.’ Tony nods. ‘Who came up with the name Venom anyway?’
‘Will you behave yourself if I do?’ comes the challenge with a raised eyebrow and a grin.
‘Yeah, right, that makes sense,’ he jumps to an opposite wall, still unsure how his senses are enabling him to do this. ‘Umm…that wasn’t a blast from the stone right?’
‘Does that guy even
Peter’s jaw drops at the boy who enters the classroom.
‘Sure thing,’ she starts to walk away. ‘TONY! STOP IT!’
‘Was there not a private investigator who dispatched someone with mind control abilities? What about looking into them?’ the German representative asks.
everyone he’s staying. Not even a “do you mind?” attached to it.’
‘You will never be a king worthy of our father,’ are the Jotun’s last words.
‘Yes sir,’ Sam answers for them all.
‘Trust me Rhodey,’ Tony looks his friend in the eye, ‘I really,
‘What happened?’ Steve puts a hand on his shoulder and Bucky tells him how the argument started, and then seemed to escalate beyond control.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Mama!’
Tony just laughs and pulls the man into a hug. ‘You’re one of the best men I know, Bucky Barnes.’
‘There’s only three people still alive that have stuck by Tony through everything, Cap. That’s me, Happy and Pepper. Anyone else who stuck around through his temper tantrums and mood swings died a long time ago. Everyone else he trusted? They betrayed him or walked away from him.’
good,’ he grins at the blush getting deeper on Steve’s face. ‘So some on, spill. Who was it?’
‘For God’s sake Tony, this is exactly-’
Ned casts a look around the room to make sure no one is close enough to hear and then lowers his voice and asks. ‘Patrols been quiet?’ Peter just nods in reply as they head down the corridor towards the lockers. ‘You going over to the facility this weekend?’
Then when he’d joined the Avengers it was the perfect place to bond with each of his team mates. Some, admittedly, faster than others; he hadn’t been much of a fan of Tony’s sharp tongue at first. He’s still not at times, though generally only when the inventor is trying to upset the wrong people.
Peter slumps back into bed, covering his face with a pillow. ‘Thunder. No alarm clocks with Thor, its rolling thunder he has to wake you up with.’
‘Oh stop being such a drama queen,’ Wade huffs, walking over to stand in front of Loki and offering his arms, ‘just grab on.’
‘We should get back,’ Wanda says quietly, putting a hand on his arm. He looks down into her understanding expression and nods.
‘Of course,’ Loki rolls his eyes, ‘remind me when my powers return to turn you into a frog again.’
‘That was wonderful!’ Wanda enthuses as the show comes to a close, she’s beaming as she looks at him and they collect their things and start to make their way out of the auditorium. As they walk out with the crowd Wanda keeps up a steady chatter about the different moves the dancers had done, and how interesting some parts of the choreography were. Vision’s just happy to watch her animated features as she talks, not really understanding most of what she is referring to. Thankfully it also means she’s distracted enough that he can lead her down some streets to a nearby park without her noticing where they are going.
even in his mind Loki’s voice is quiet.
Peter opens his mouth to say something, but the sound of a robbery below them distracts both of them from the conversation.
‘You are
‘Tony, you sure about this?’ Steve asks quietly, his hand reaching down to take his, rubbing soft circles onto the back of it with his thumb.
‘Yeah like that’s ever going to happen,’ Bucky scoffs, ‘I’ll join you.’
‘No way. You can’t be Daredevil. You’re blind!’ he says.
‘Do you mind? I came here to escape Wong’s mother henning, I don’t need you to start.’
Deadpool does turn to look at him now, and Peter has to look away at the intensity in that gaze, even through two masks. ‘You better take your own advice sometime, Spidey.’ He gets up and starts walking away. ‘I should be back by next week. Try to stay out of trouble until then, Baby Boy.’
‘And the catch?’ he asks.
‘Actually, Rhodey it’s your War Machine suit,’ Clint tells him. ‘You think I can get it programmed to move shit?’
‘You not run a check?’
wasn’t the one to fire them.
‘What kind of things did you have to do you didn’t want to?’ Vision asks. ‘The dances?’
‘So how come you haven’t cooked since I got out?’ Rhodes asks.
‘Captain Rogers how do you feel about having to let the justice system handle someone who hurt a member of your team?’
Peter opens his mouth to respond, but finds his mind has gone blank. Flash’s words are a bit too close to his own deeply hidden thoughts to be easily pushed aside.

I've gifted this story to Miciagatta33 and IchBinEs for being the most faithful comment-ers a writer could ask for. Thank you so much for always leaving a comment, it really brightens my week to read them and the fact that you both leave one on every chapter is just absolutely incredible.
“Did you know?”
“I know you and your father didn’t have a great relationship. You didn’t even have a good relationship.” Pepper’s voice is soft now, not her normal professional tones. Not even the exasperated edge that slips in when she thinks Tony is being ridiculous. “But, you’re different. You’re not Howard. You’re Tony, brilliant and compassionate and a survivor in a way nobody else can say they are.” Pepper finishes her sentence by softly patting the reactor in his chest, reminding him that yes, Tony Stark does have a heart.
Tony laughs, snuggling into Steve.
Tony’s never heard Steve stutter before. He’s trying to wrap his head around what might have happened, what could leave Steve in such a vulnerable position. It’s only been a few days since their weekend out with Peter and the gang. Tony can’t think of anything nationally that’s happened in the last few days, nothing at the school. He can’t fathom what’s happened to Steve to cause this.
Something is wrong.
Everything about the night is so strange. Steve calling Tony, for help. The whispered way he tells him about Bucky while leaning into Tony. The explicit trust Steve is putting in Tony shocks the man. So much so he can only drop the blanket and crawl into Steve’s bed, he wraps himself around the bigger man as much as he can.
When Steve looks up from his coffee, unable to watch the steam rise any longer he notices how close he and Tony are. Saying there’s an inch between them is generous in the moment. Tony’s standing barely a hair away from Steve, dark eyes staring up at him through long, elegant lashes. Steve’s struck by how Tony’s eyes aren’t brown, not in the traditional sense. They’re amber, the stunning color of whiskey as it’s poured into a crystal glass. The shorter man’s lips part, elegant and pink. Raw in one spot from where he worries it between his teeth.
“Well… yeah, you did. But, I mean. I thought that if anything it would most likely be Pepper, in the boardroom, with a stiletto.”
“None of our business, Ned,” MJ sighs. Steve swears the girl is only seven but already an annoyed teenager.
“Art.” He swings his little feet and finishes his orange juice. He folds his little hands together and makes like he is scrubbing his hands, Tony’s signal that he is done eating and is ready to be helped down from the bar stool where he’s sat for breakfast.
As the first verse comes to an end Tony finally catches sight of Steve. A look of surprise crosses his face for a moment before Tony is pulling Steve fully into the kitchen and leading him into a dance.
A comfortable moment of silence passes over them, Tony trying to accept Bruce’s kind words. He doesn’t know how to plan parties for kids, he never even had a party as a kid. Howard didn’t believe in them. He didn’t want his son associating with children his age, with children that weren’t brilliant. At Peter’s age Tony was already being showcased at Stark Expo events, displayed at parties. Which is why this is so, so important, Tony pulling this off is one step further from Howard.
“Uh, the quick version is I was in the military for six years. At 24 I got recruited for a special division of homeland security that I can’t tell you about. As an agent, there I did mission for four and a half years. Until I retired last year, after… after a really, really bad set of missions. We accomplished our objective but,” Steve sighs, heart heavy in his chest. Thankfully, he takes the cup of coffee Tony pushes into his hands. “We finished the objective, but I was emotionally compromised. So many things happened. I wasn’t sure if I believed in what I was doing…” Steve trails off, unsure of where he was going with that. The thought leaves as quickly as it occurs.
“Thank you.” Tony heads toward Peter’s room. “Red pajamas or blue pajamas tonight, kiddo?” Peter simply folds his thumb over his palm, B for Blue Tony assumes. “Alright, blue pajamas it is. Let’s get you cleaned up.”
, he signs sloppily, before digging into his food.
“Yes, baby, I think that would be nice for Mr. Rogers.” Tony quickly makes another sandwich, wrapping it carefully. He scribbles a quick note and tapes it to the sandwich before closing up the box and pushing his son toward his bedroom. “Go grab your school bag, we don’t want to be late.”
It’s nearly nine when they finally stumble into the penthouse of the Tower. The kids passed out in the car after stuffing themselves full of pasta and breadsticks at a small Italian restaurant Tony loves. Tony’s carrying MJ on his hip, Steve has Ned on his back and Peter in his arms. It feels domestic, following Tony through the home.
‘I do not think your father would approve.’
‘True,’ he sighs, ‘alright Karen put all the police searches in a different colour. Maybe I can visit a few in the suit and rule them out at some point.’
‘Hey!’ Wade pouts.
we do as long as we do it with our family and our friends.’
Honestly? Yeah I want to get those poor bastards out of Francis’ hands. No one should go through what I did. And on the plus side it fucks up his plans.
‘I’m here. How did you get here so fast?’ Steve replies as he comes to a stop between them.
‘He killed them all,’ Tony clarifies, eyes still scanning the information on the tablet. ‘He’s not exactly got the most stable of minds.’
Peter just nods and mutters a thank you. He’s telling the truth the kid does look beat, and if it isn’t for the fact Tony
‘What’s in here?’ he asks.
‘You’re lucky your charming good looks make up for your less than charming personality, Spidey.’
‘Wade-’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘I see,’ the blond sounds disappointed and Loki can’t help but laugh.
May smiles a little and gives a huff of laughter. ‘You’ve never had to care for children before have you, Mr Stark?’ He shakes his head. ‘You can do everything possible to try and keep them safe but they’ll always find a way to get into trouble. Sometimes because they go looking for it, sometimes because it finds them. If you want to continue being a presence in Peter’s life you better be prepared to be as scared as you’ve been today a lot more often.’
‘I just didn’t time to eat enough,’ he mutters eventually. ‘Not in front of everyone anyway.’
‘So you heading to Budapest at any point on your European tour?’ Clint asks him as they all sit in the common room.
‘I should be happy that the team work better together to take out me and Buck than they do in the training room?’ Steve deadpans.
‘Let’s just say I can hear more than someone lying.’ Matt rejoins his two friends, leaving Peter with a racing mind.
‘Or you could take her and still leave me in charge,’ Valkyrie shrugs. ‘Unless you don’t think I can handle it?’
Loki laughs and relays the message.
Then Mjolnir comes flying into the back of the Titan’s head, knocking him off balance.
want to go back there when we’ve finished here, and got everyone else and now we’re here to help you guys fight Thanos and there are a
‘Ah Colonel, lovely to see you again. Perhaps you can help me convince your friend to be a little more cooperative, I’m afraid Anthony hasn’t exactly been playing ball so to speak. My new friends haven’t taken too kindly to that, have they Anthony?’ The look Tony sends Hammer is toxic, and the man gestures to one of the guards. ‘Show them.’
‘Yeah, course I do.’
‘I hate to interrupt,’ Fury says, ‘but there is a reason we invited you all to this meeting,’ he looks not just at Ororo, but at Carol and the group calling themselves the Guardians of the Galaxy. ‘You’ve helped us to defeat Thanos, but in doing so you may have also opened yourself up to getting noticed by other forces here on Earth you might wish you hadn’t.’
‘Hey,’ he presses a finger to the teen’s soft lips, ‘no more of that, Petey-Pie. We’re both fine, let’s just leave it as that, yeah?’ Peter scrunches up his face. ‘What?’ he asks.
‘Now, Pepper,’ he says, pointing at the list of names and pictures that his AI brings up. ‘Tell me what you see.’
‘No it isn’t.’
‘Or the times Hulk’s basically saved all of us,’ Tony adds.
Bucky shares his realisation with Loki.
Unfortunately, this is definitely not from music. If the cold, hard surface he’s laying on is anything to go by.
‘I’ll see what I can do,’ he smiles at her in sympathy.
‘Well when the genius here had his first arc reactor he decided not to tell anyone it was slowly killing him. Instead he decided working himself into an even earlier death in an attempt to ignore it was a much better solution,’ the Colonel replies.
‘Young Peter!’ he booms as soon as he catches sight of him and comes over, putting his hand so hard on Peter’s shoulder that he starts choking on his mouthful. ‘It is good to see you again!’
‘Hey! Watch it!’
‘Hulk sleepy,’ he yawns and starts to shrink in size.
‘Well,’ she says when they all head out to let him finish his call in peace, ‘that was certainly unexpected.’
Loki scowls at him. ‘Oh be quiet, I will admit to have becoming fonder of the man the more I have been exposed to him. Similar to the rest of you.’
‘They took me, Loki,’ he forces out, ‘if they do it again I could-’
‘What do you mean?’ Strange asks, eyeing the frost giant in distrust.
, it’s not actually that hard. I didn’t though!’ he adds quickly, seeing Harry’s worried expression. ‘I’d have heard them crack if I had.’
‘One,’ comes the quiet reply. There’s a moment of dead silence between the group as they take in the information.
‘So what was it you were doing?’ he asks, trying to get his head around all of this information.
‘A little,’ he admits, ‘the thing is… I’m not sure how to tell Tony.’
‘Why? I’ve got a perfectly good view from here. Besides it’s probably Mark just grabbed the new guy’s arse like he always-’ the crowd has moved enough that Wade catches sight of a mop of brown hair and a lithe frame holding the man against the wall.
‘He’s already forgiven you Steve, otherwise he wouldn’t have asked you to come back,’ she says, placing a comforting hand on his shoulder.
‘Yep I’m just convincing Cloaky to follow me back to the facility.’
. I mean even though we were up against Wanda and Mr Vision and all their powers. It was awesome.’ Peter’s on the phone to his aunt. Right.
Please let me know what you think of the last couple of chapters, especially this one where Harry gets to take Flash down a peg or two. I loved writing that scene so much. I will also get on top of responding to all the lovely comments people have been leaving today, I promise.
‘You know if you’d said you wanted a hand I would have come with you and helped,’ she tells him, standing up from the couch.
‘Oh my god you’ve been spending way too much time with Peter and Wade if you’re using pop culture references on me.’
Steve pauses as he puts the coffee pot down. ‘What do you mean following orders?’
‘I agree,’ she nods, ‘it would not be sensible.’
‘Is it about the strike on the school bus? Because I really didn’t mean for her to try and kill my classmate, I mean she took that the wrong way and I think we seriously need to look at AI interpretation of instructions-’
‘We can’t let him keep doing this,’ Steve is surprised his voice comes out so firm, he was sure it’d be a wavering mess. Everyone turns to him in surprise.
‘FRIDAY talk to me,’ he mutters, landing and walking slowly towards Peter, taking in the vest hanging around his torso and the gun pointing at his head. The kid is refusing to meet his gaze which is worrying him.
* * * * * * * *
Steve fumbles with the tie at his neck, his fingers shaking with thoughts on what he’s about to do. ‘Dammit!’ he curses as the material once again slips through his fingers.
‘Who there?’ Hulk roars.
‘Oh come on I’m not that bad a driver,’ he says, narrowly missing a motorcyclist as he changes lane. He notices the wide eyes and bursts out laughing. ‘Ok so I’m not the most careful driver, but I have yet to have an accident in a car I made myself.’
‘What could you possibly want me to talk to you about, Pepper? Hmm?’ he demands, pushing his chair away from the desk and frowning up at her.
‘Because some of us have learnt restraint,’ Natasha rolls her eyes and pops another sushi roll into her mouth.
‘We lost contact with the group in Norway,’ she tells them both. ‘FRIDAY said she lost contact after Tony’s suit was activated. They went to visit a dig where there were signs of Frost Giant activity.’
‘Deal.’
where she’s buried.’
Losing the team seems to have mellowed the man, and Wanda couldn’t help but wish a little of the old arrogant Tony would come back. He may have been a pain in the arse, but he was also entertaining. This new Tony seems to carry a huge weight, and she doesn’t know how to help him.
know about this except me?’ Sam demands. ‘I could have sworn the only reason Tony came down here was to stare at Cap’s ass.’
‘Why? He usually stays locked in his workshop until the early hours, Buck. Trust me, from past experience I know he doesn’t like to be disturbed mid-inventing session.’
in them, I don’t,’ she smirks.
‘If we have the drinking competition now half of us won’t be awake to see in the new year, completely defeating the point of the party,’ Peter says as Tony and Steve walk into the common area.
‘Don’t promise me it’ll all be alright, Wanda, you’re not the one who can see the future,’ he tells her.
Steve just nods, taking the kit back to the bathroom and collecting the shirt from the floor where he’d left it folded, bringing it back to the inventor. Tony takes it from him and, with shaking hands, presses on the reactor. It opens up, revealing a hidden compartment that had never been in any of the previous ones.
As always here's your sneak peek (yes I am giggling evilly as I copy it over):
Peter gives her a small smile. ‘Are you?’ he challenges.
‘He might come after you too,’ he says quietly, staring down at the new contact in his phone. ‘If he finds out I’m Spider-Man, he could come after you.’
‘I..’ Strange looks around the agreeing nods in surprise. ‘Thank you.’
‘They knew we’d call for his arrest,’ Steve curses. ‘Wanda! Ross!’
‘It was pretty awesome how Harry put him in his place at dinner though,’ MJ scoffs, ‘I’ve never seen him turn such a bright shade of red before.’
He gives a small smile, but doesn’t look up from the carpet. Then he’s pulled into a tight hug and, after a couple of seconds, he wraps his arms around her waist. ‘Be careful,’ he says quietly. ‘I don’t want any of you to get hurt.’
‘That is categorically untrue,’ he protests, smirking a little as he adds, ‘you have some
‘But,’ Peter looks torn, ‘I don’t want to hurt you.’
She laughs. ‘Don’t worry he actually wrote it down for me. I kept it somewhere safe.’
Peter leaves them to their bickering as he runs back to his locker and grabs his weekend bag along with a couple of extra bottles of web fluid, managing to find the perfect balance between normal and super-speed so it doesn’t take too long. He’s hoping he can convince Tony to let him experiment on his webs in the facility’s labs. Though considering what’s happened this week he’s not holding out much hope on that option.
"Both dead. Killed in a plane crash" Steve raised his eyebrows, feeling his heart ache for the young child.
"He's going to be okay, babe. Especially with that dog by his side" Tony snapped his head at him at that, confusion fluttering across his face.
"And is she your foster parent?" Tony asked. Steve glared at him.
What finally broke their silence was the beeping of Tony's watch. He snapped his head down and felt his heart drop as he saw the shape of a dog head pop up on the little screen.
"So I asked Mrs. Adams if I could go but-"
“Are you sure?” He asked, searching Tony’s face for any signs of reluctance. Tony smiled.
"Alright, alright let's not get hasty" pops put his hands up in defense and laughed.
Steve hurried to pick him up. The boy cried out and looked up at who was carrying him. Upon seeing it was Steve, he threw his arms around his neck, shaking with sobs. Steve shushed him, bouncing him and whispering to him.
"You would be an amazing father" Steve whispered, and Tony could tell he genuinely believed it.
"Where am I? Am I in a hospital? I don't like the hospital! Bad things happen there!" Tears pricked at Peter's eyes as he began panicking.
They whipped their heads around to the building, scanning for the source.
With a sad sigh, Tony sat up and made his way to the kitchen. He walked in to see his husband in a white tank top and pajama pants reading the newspaper. Next to him was Peter excitedly talking about the project him and Tony had been working on: a robot dog. It was small enough for Peter to hold and nearly completed. The boy had named it Benny, after his late uncle.
Tony watched on in amazement. He never knew Steve had such fatherly instincts. It certainly made Tony insecure about his parenting abilities.
So yea. Peter was having the time of his life. He knew all about this world, but he never really got to be a part of it thanks to his over-protective dads (He has super strength, for Christ's sake). For the first time, he felt like a real avenger.
There had been an explosion at Yoki Labs and the building was at a near collapse.
Aunt Nat furrowed her eyebrows and smiled as she looked over at the teen.
"You- you lifted it" uncle Bruce spoke up first, breaking the silence.
"Buddy? Are you okay?" He asked, staring at he boy with worried eyes. Peter shook his head.
Two weeks turned to four which turned to six. Every time it was time to sent Peter home, Tony spewed out something about tests and that he needed to stay longer. Any time Steve brought up the fact that Tony had clearly taken a liking to the kid, Tony denied everything, stating that it was purely medical. Steve always dropped it with a knowing smile.
Peter was freaking the hell out. His chest was heaving despite the lightness of the hammer. What did this mean? How could he be worthy? This has to be joke, right? Does this mean he has to rule Asgard? Peter felt his cheeks get hot as everyone continued to stare at him.
Purely on instinct, Steve quickly embraced the boy and lifted him into his lap, rocking him gently.
"Look, it may have been seventy years ago, but I grew up in New York too. And Queens is no place for a tiny foster kid to be with so those injuries" Damn him, Tony thought. Why did he always have to be so right?.
"It's gonna fall, Tony!" Steve yelled up at his husband from the ground, moving pieces of rubble from the building and grabbing any civilians he could find.
"Right. Okay" he said sarcastically, turning back to Peter.
"My father was no father, so why should I be?"
They turned to head to their limousine when they suddenly heard a sharp cry.
Tony shook his head, laughing humorlessly.
"Whatever. Peter was there, it was a force of habit" his pops downright pouted, a small smile giving him away.
"Hey hey hey. Look at me Peter" Tony said softly, and Peter's wet eyes met his.
Tony smiled and turned to Peter.
Everyone froze, and the room was deadly quiet.  Nobody knew what to do, especially Tony and Steve. They had just watched their teenage son lift an ancient magic hammer as if it was a piece of paper, and all they could do was stare.
"I think it's a woman or a child. There's a large pileup but be careful, one wrong move and this debris could crush them" The soldier nodded at Tony's words and began carefully moving pieces.
"Yea?" Tony replied.
"Steve, he said a bad language word"
"No, Tony" Steve cut him off, turning and himself and his husband to look him straight in the eyes.
Everyone calls bullshit at that, throwing many "whatever, man" 's his way.
"Good job, captain"
"Don't worry about it. This is just as fun" Steve tossed his shield at a beam that was blocking a woman and her dog, allowing her to escape. Tony just smiled and shook his head.
Tony looked at him in amazement. He didn't expect his super-soldier husband to be so great with children.
The young boy cut himself off, unable to find the word.
"I'm never going to be enough for him" Tony whispered, causing Steve to turn back to him with confusion written all over his face.
He expected to pull as hard as he could and it not move an inch.
His big, way-too-adorable eyes bore straight into Tony's who swallowed and smiled.
"I believe he asked you a question kid" Tony turned to a chubby boy who looked to be the oldest, sounding a lot more calm than he actually was.
"I'm going to give you to Iron Man now. He's going to take you to get all patched up" He gave the boy a comforting smile, and the boy looked between them, contemplating.
Steve walked over to Tony and put his hand on his shoulder.
Peter laughed as his dad and uncle Rhodey put on their gloves and attempted to pull the magic hammer with no avail. Peter and his pops made eye contact and rolled their eyes fondly at the two men,
"Look me in the eye and tell me that we wouldn't give that kid the best life. That he wouldn't have all the love and protection that he could ever hope for" Steve took Tony's silence as an indication to continue.
"Oh yea. You've been so quiet tonight" she remarked. Peter hadn't even realized. He was just enjoying the moment.
"O-Okay but I'm not sure I can remember everything" Peter looked back and forth at the heroes.
Then, Peter felt the hammer being ripped away from his hand and looked over to see Thor grinning from ear to ear.
"Well, I could've told you that. He didn't even need to lift the hammer" Pops smiled and pulled his son into a hug. His dad came over and joined him.
"Of course not" he said.
They sat in silence for what felt like hours. The only sounds to be heard were their quiet breathing and the soft rumbling of one of the machines in the lab.
His pops sighed and looked up at his husband.
“I can do this- as long as you’re there with me” Tony looked deep into his husband’s eyes.
Steve walked up next to Tony without a word, staring straight ahead. Tony looked at his husband.
Peter zoned in to hear the tail end of Clint's "You bet your ass" and smiled when Maria pointed it out.
They walked over to the pile of debris.
Tony didn't take his eyes off Peter as he replied.
"Open up!" Steve banged on the door of the home. Tony sighed and took a look around. He knew it was in a poor part of town, but he never imagined this.
“It’s true! Without your father, I wouldn’t of been able to become Captain America and live to fall in love with you” Steve smiled, grabbing Tony’s hand. The billionaire fought a smile but failed.
"So you're injuries are healed up, bud. You're casts are off and-" Steve cut himself off, not sure how to continue.
"Alright I will just take him with me to Asgard, never to see you or the captain ever again"
Then, a piercing noise sounds through the room, a hobbling robot walks in, and everything goes to shit.
Peter Stark-Rogers was having the time of his life. After some convincing, his dads decided to let him attend a party with the freaking
The ride back to the tower was silent. Neither man knew what to say.
"Right back at ya" Tony grinned.
The first thing they noticed were a crowd of four boys, none of them any older than twelve, as well as a little boy and three girls watching from the bunk beds. The four boys were standing around something, blocking their view.
"So, what's the plan?" He asked his husband, who turned around with furrowed brows.
"Yes, it's a very, very interesting theory. I have a simpler one" Thor lifts his hammer and spins it in his hands.
The soldier slowly wrapped his arm around his husband's who leaned his head against the other man's shoulder.
“Alright capsicle, I need my ribs” Tony wheezed out as the air was hugged out of him.
"Whatever man, it's a trick"
A week ago, Peter couldn't sleep and came down to the gym where Steve was up boxing. Peter asked if he could try, and for the last week, against Tony's judgement, Steve had been giving him lessons.
So, where does he live?" Steve asked.
"Hey Pete, we need to talk to you" Steve said, and him and Steve looked at each other, walking over to the island and taking a seat across from the boy.
They turned to leave, but Tony stopped at the door, turning back to the shell-shocked boys.
"When I grow up, I wanna be a scientist and invent stuff like Mr. Yoki. But- But then there was a loud boom and everything fell and then I couldn't get out and- and" the boy was nearly sobbing by now and his heart rate was climbing alarmingly fast.
His pops spoke up from his spot on the couch as he stood up and walked over to his son.
Tony's eyes widened. He opened his mouth to speak (probably to protest) but instead let out a heavy sigh.
He’s a teacher but even he isn’t ready for the atomic levels of energy these kids showcase as they run to the doors. They’re bouncing and Peter is adding small phrases to his signing because his hands just can’t keep up with everything he wants to say. The small boy, MJ and Ned stand off to the side, their hands and lips moving a million miles an hour as they use some strange language developed just for them.
“His name was James. Ta me.. he’s Bucky. He stumbled onto me getting my ass kicked three ways ta Sunday in tha alley behind tha house. Lived ‘ere with my ma at tha time. Buck chased away tha guys. Threw a few extra punches an’ made fun of my size.
‘Mr. Rogers and Dr. Banner are my favorites. Dr. Banner because he likes bugs, too. He thinks bees are nice and he’s right! Mr. Rogers because he draws nice, and he sits with me at lunch!’
“Hey Pete, Ned, MJ, why don’t you all go clean up Peter’s bedroom? After that, have Jay play two episodes of whatever kid appropriate show you want to watch, then lunch should be ready.”
"You can do this.” Natasha smiles, waving slowly as the elevator doors close.
Steve nods keeping his eyes shut tight, even as Tony places a hand on the small of Steve’s back to guide him. Steve usually manages his anxiety attacks okay. He can talk himself through them. Even after the nightmares he doesn’t have trouble calming down. Tony surprising him shouldn’t trigger an attack this bad. Steve’s thoughts continue the destructive path. Each one feeding into the cycle, he should be able to handle this, he knows where the exits are, he knows how best to protect himself and the people closest. He could easily overtake Tony if he was on the wrong side of things. But he feels his heart continue to race and he just grows colder and colder.
“Yes, Sir, it’s good.” If JARVIS could smile, if his voice was able to fluctuate enough to show emotion Tony thinks it would right now. The A.I. sounds proud.
