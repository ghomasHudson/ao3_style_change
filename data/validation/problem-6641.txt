“I know it’s different because everything you’re going through is real. You really do have asthma and sinusitis and heart problems and everything else, I’m not saying I know exactly what you’re feeling,” Tony says, talking very fast now. “I just meant, when I’m going through that, I can’t
“Of course I do.” Tony’s voice stayed steady, but his hand wasn’t as he reached out and undid his own cuff.
“Don’t,” he croaks, still trying to tug his hand away. He doesn’t think Steve will stop, not any of this, no matter what Tony says, but part of him wants to see how Steve will respond.
Fortunately, Sam lets it go. “I figured, since if he were down you’d probably still be screwing like bunnies, and if he were a dick about it I think you’d either be on the other side of the planet, planning a permanent move to another decade, or starting a fistfight with a kaiju to blow off steam. Am I wrong?”
,” Tony begins, “I’d have to fly to China and find the magic herb that sends you into a deep, magical sleep.” Then he tackles Steve.
“Yes,” Tony said. For all his wariness, he meant it. He’d faced Steve as an enemy too many times. He refused to do it again.
They chase each other and dart away from each other like a pair of blue jays going after the same grasshopper. Steve tosses himself through the room like he’s his own shield, finding angles and arcs to intercept Tony’s flightpath. Tony twirls and flips like an acrobat somersaulting from one tightrope only to land on and ride a unicycle across another.
Reed’s not the only one from Tony’s side acting as a witness for the defense. Jan and Rhodey are there too, and more surprisingly, Carol.
The radiant expression drops off Tony’s face. He hadn’t realized how precious Tony’s joy had been until seeing it vanish.
It must look like he’s just going on a jog across campus, because no one gives him a second glance as he runs all the way to Stark Tower.
Tony stepped into Steve's arms. Steve held him close and let Tony melt against him. “I always have been.”
“‘I need your help, Steve,’” Tony says from the page, through Steve’s voice. “‘You’re the only one I trust to make certain everything I was working for doesn’t fall apart without me and to ensure that the threats I wasn’t around to predict don’t end up blindsiding us in my absence.’”
The light in Steve’s eyes is golden sunlight. “Seems fair. You spent all that time staying at mine.”
He almost speaks when Steve starts undressing. But he doesn’t know what purpose it would serve. Antagonizing him? Goading him? Begging him not to touch Tony again?
She hangs her purse across her body, puts on her backpack, and lifts the upright bass without any visible effort. When the train grinds to a halt at the 24th Street Mission station, she shoulders her way out of the car, against the opposing floor of boarding commuters, her dark hair lustrous and glossy even under the harsh fluorescents of the train.
Tony makes a face. “Well, yeah, I mean. There’s a hunk of metal embedded in my chest, Cap. It isn’t exactly comfortable.” He starts, as if something’s just occurred to him. “It’s not a big deal, though, I mean, I’m fine to fight, obviously I am, I’ve done it a ton of times, I just meant—”
The damage done in the fights with Simon and Apocalypse is conspicuous in its absence. The mundanity of it all is overbearing: the familiar configurations of electronics and drawers of tools and placements of worktops; the at once unfamiliar arrangements of parts and furniture orchestrated by past versions of himself—versions remembered and forgotten and overwritten. A jumble of time travel and Infinity Gems and the messiness of human thought, presented as a tidy, well-organized workspace.
Fifteen minutes before that week’s movie night, Steve called Tony from Citi Field. “Sharon had an extra ticket to the game tonight, it was a last minute thing,” he said.
After a flash of bewilderment, Tony scowls. “Rhetorical tricks aside, I’d like to think—it didn’t used to be.”
“You won’t have a choice. You can’t hide anything from me. You can’t manipulate me the way you did him.” Steve sounds almost earnest. “He didn’t deserve you. He wanted to change you. But I know you better. I appreciate you.”
Before his boot can meet his counterpart’s chest, Iron Man cuts between them, striking Steve’s outstretched leg. Steve twists with the momentum, letting himself be knocked into a flip. He lands on his feet and gets his shield up just in time to block a blast from the model 4 unibeam.
“Does it help,” she says, “to think about this as something that’s being done for him, and not for you?”
They step out to a pair of doors, side-by-side in a long, curved hallway. Tony offers a brief smile before stepping into one, the door sliding shut behind him. Steve stands there, staring blankly ahead, wondering how many hours they have until they part ways forever.
After their conversation, Tony takes to following Wormseed around town. It doesn’t take a bloodhound to sniff out that something’s awry about the man and his associates.
Maybe that's why Tony has the courage to say, "Steve, I want to be with you. I don't know what I did that might've—that hurt you. But if you'll let me, I want to try again. To have a real relationship."
“I think it solves one or two things.” Steve tries to smile. It shouldn’t be so hard when his whole body thrums with joy and elation and slowly dawning relief. It hasn’t entirely sunk in yet that they’re going to fix this. Loving and hating each other from across the battlefield accomplished nothing, but they know better now.
“Well, won't be long now before the town comes out with pitchforks begging 'im to arrest me. And that sheriff, he’s a strange bird. Some kinda freethinker, I hear. Wants that first amendment stuck to—and all the other ones, too. Thinks women oughta get the vote, even.”
Steve weighs his choices. If he refuses, it’s not like Tony will leave. And there’s no postponing the inevitable—Tony knows what’s happened, and he’s not going away. Steve takes the edge of the blankets and pulls them down his face, watching Tony for his reaction.
When they pull apart, Rhodes is there, proffering a gift the size of a shoebox. Tony takes it and tears the matte green wrapping paper off in shreds to reveal a plastic container full of cookies. “Rhodes cookies!” he announces triumphantly.
“Hey,” Steve says, resting a hip against Tony’s worktable. He’s wearing a pair of faded jeans that he’s had for as long as Tony’s known him, worn soft with years of use and washing. It matches his smile now, somehow; a smile Tony can’t explain or account for. “What’re you working on?”
“You want to be strong that badly?” Tony circles a finger around the edges of Steve’s hole. “Or do you want
Steve doesn’t have to live on the helicarrier any more, which is just as well, since his room there was destroyed during the crash, and living quarters aren’t a high priority for repairs.
“I liked the message of that glittery one Happy took away from that woman in the front. Though I’d prefer if it were me you were doing it to.”
So it’s this part of the conversation already; Steve’s just cast Tony as harboring every principle of injustice Steve has ever fought against, and Tony’s going to say something that will lower Steve’s opinion of him even further.
She’s tricked him into joining him for dinner, but to her disappointment, the meal passes in silence. Through the porthole beside their table, a star winks out of the sky before their eyes. Klithua points it out to Brickenn, expecting him to brush her off as usual. Instead, he tells her about his home planet: lush, resplendent, home to glittering insects as colorful as gemstones, gemstones that look like they contain nebulas and spiral galaxies, and trees broader than ten men and as tall as the heavens. His voice fills with longing, his body animates with emotion, and Klithua is more enchanted with him than ever.
Tony’s plastic face is bent into a smirk. He lands toe-first like a ballet dancer and Steve wonders if he knew exactly what would happen when he came here and if he hoped this would happen and what he would do if he had a choice.
There are threats, battles, near apocalypses. Disruptions to the timeline, a fight over the Infinity Gems, aliens and villains. It may as well be an office job. New problems and crises, hours of overtime, work that’s become familiar and mundane. Rinse and repeat. He doesn’t need much sleep, and there’s always another catastrophe. Failing that, there’s always paperwork.
Tony isn’t sure whether it’s politeness or habit that makes Steve ask, or if it’s some kind of trick question. His answer is the same regardless. “I’m fine, Cap.”
At first, Tony can only think of lewd or grotesque replies, which suggests to him that the correct answer is neither. The swelling and rising of the walls around him are of no help, nor the fact that he and his adversary are tied and he doesn't know where a wrong answer will lead him. Finally, he thinks of meals at Victor’s grand dining table, and smiles. “Dough,” he says triumphantly.
Steve’s hands are cuffed behind his back, trapped under him, so he has less leverage than he’d like, but he can get up, he can push Tony off him—
Tony smiles, a parody of tenderness. He lifts a spreader bar from the bag and makes a show of examining it. “Oh, you know me, Steve,” he says sweetly. “I’m sentimental.”
“Oh yes, some centuries ago. It’s all regulated, of course, but your arrival was scheduled—lucky thing records of your trip survived, actually, sometimes when—well, that’s a few years ahead of you yet, you’ll find out,” Lieutenant Gonzales replies. Tony nods along like this is all exactly as expected and perfectly comprehensible. “So all the bureaucratic pieces are in place to send one or both of you wherever you like. We’re on course now to Frontier Outpost 12. Our expected—”
“Tony,” Steve says to the lights of Brooklyn, scattering and unfocusing through condensation forming on the window. His voice is too quiet to reach Tony, ice cold in his casket, unknowingly traversing the stars—is too quiet even to reach the streetlamp across the street. “I love you. I should’ve listened to you. I should’ve—you’re my best friend, and I wasn’t there for you. I couldn’t admit I might be wrong. I wish I’d told you. I wish you’d known how loved you are.”
How can Steve look at him like that, after all Tony’s done? Reality should preclude it, the way it precludes the destruction of the Gems.
Natasha’s gift is presented with utmost precision, like the hospital corners equivalent of giftwrapping. Steve’s sitting right in front of it and can’t even see where the tape is. It’s decorated with beautiful papercut designs, which, given her skill with knives, she must have made herself. Tony opens it carefully, leaving all the paper as intact as possible.
Tony dismounts and dons a charming smile. “Victor von Doom, I presume?” As he approaches, he sees that under his forest-green cloak, the man is sporting a full suit of plate armor. Well, Tony supposes he’s not one to judge such sartorial choices, these days. “I’m Tony Stark. I hear you’re the man that first settled this valley.”
He tilts one of the IV poles so he can see the bag up close. There are no markings on it. He does the same with the other, but it's just as blank.
“You ask that Mister Wong,” she continues. “He know’s what the fuss is about. There’s this book, s’posed to be sumthin’ special. Wong’s heard it’s here in Timely.”
The decorator, Alicia, is tall and severe, wearing a black silk jumpsuit with a white belt and white boots. Her blonde hair is almost as pale as her hands.
“You love it,” Tony whispers in Steve’s ear, wrenching Steve’s head back further. “This is all you’re good for: a fuck. A hole for me to use. If you were any more pathetic you wouldn’t be worth the trouble. There are people in this city who’d pay me to pick them, you said so yourself. Everyone wants to give themselves to me: their money, their power, their bodies. You aren’t special. You’re just the one in front of me right now.”
Tony takes his hand. Steve can feel his sleep-warm skin, his pulse beating in his veins. Alive, Tony’s alive. He tells himself that’s all that matters. That, and the words Steve should have said years ago. “Last night—I was trying to tell you. I love you.”
have been convened by any means short of sorcery. Since it’s magic he’s looking for, he takes the manor’s appearance as a sign he’s in the right place.
“Offering?” Tony says, forcing himself to speak through the pain. “Y-You haven’t offered anything. Just taken.”
Tony waits until Steve’s packed the last file away, where Tony can’t see them, before he comes to sit beside him and say, “What were you working on?”
he could have said on a rooftop, in the wee hours of the morning in the old library, soaring above Manhattan, during a stolen moment in Tony’s office.
Crossing the threshold of the portal is like passing through a cloud of gnats at Mach 2 in Iron Man’s arms.
Tony runs, the ground convulsing under his boots. He sprays flame from his gauntlet to keep the others at bay. It's not lost on him that what Doom has pulled from the abyss is just what those creatures want.
Steve’s been listening, and watching, and he still isn’t able to help the next time it happens. It’s been a couple of weeks since the incident at Club A, and he’s been hoping that whatever was wrong won’t recur.
Steve’s prepared for a blow this time. He imagines the weight of his shield—the one he left behind when he left Tony behind. He’s made himself vulnerable to an attack, but he’s ready. Whatever fury, indignation, or derision is coming, Steve’s braced for it.
“Good evening,” Tony says when he is scant feet away from the figure. “Might I ask you to open that gate and let me through?”
“I was watching them,” Steve says, his mouth centimeters from Tony’s ear. “Tony. The sounds you made.”
Tony thinks it might be nighttime. He doesn’t move when he hears Steve approach; Steve will arrange him however he likes, regardless of what Tony does. Tony doesn’t flinch, either. It’s a minor victory, but he’ll take it.
“You look great!” Jan cries. She tugs Tony closer to her and lifts her phone to take a selfie. “This is going on my Instagram. It’s a one-of-a-kind Janet Van Dyne piece!”
“How’s the coverage looking?” Tony asks. After fielding the last questions and making his goodbyes, he’d only had time to glance at a news aggregator during the elevator ride up to the penthouse.
“That right?” Stark's eyes return to the bottle of whiskey. “Dunno as I’ve seen much here I ain’t seen a thousand times over.”
the doctor said that the armor might slow them down a little but wouldn’t actually stop them and after they ate me they could still operate my armor and speak with my voice and stuff
“Because a forgery won’t whisper in my ear every time I walk past it,” Wong replies sharply. “That is the Shiatra Book of the Damned, and anyone who looks at its pages will know its language and lose their soul to its will.”
with the gold embossing, a housewarming present from Tony—are still in the tower, as far as he knows. Maybe Tony got rid of them.
The gatekeeper might once have been a man, though he just as well may have started as an antler shed by a mule deer in the winter. Overlong limbs with too many knees and elbows pointing in too many directions taper off and multiply, arms and legs giving way to branches to twigs, too delicate to support weight but doing so nonetheless. If he had a spine once, or eyes, or a mouth, or a head of hair, they are gone now, pounded like bruised clay into a paste of smooth, curving flesh.
If players bring Captain America (Casualties of War) to face Iron Man (Casualties of War) or vice versa, they will deal higher damage faster and, if the tile generation is timed right, one side will generate a lot of AP. But as soon as one side has used that extra AP to damage their opponents past a certain point, the waning opponent can sacrifice himself to his cause and help their allies to finish the job.
He’s the one who told us about the shadows, too. They’re called the Vashta Nerada and they can eat the flesh off of a human body in less than a second.
Tony nearly rolls his eyes. “If you have the same plans you did an hour ago, then yeah, of course it would be.”
No sooner has copper met flesh than all the tension and pain contorting Tony’s body spills out of him. The strong, steady breaths he takes are the best thing Steve’s ever heard.
“Steve—what—” Tony takes a step toward them and the lights go out. They return a split-second later, feeling brighter and bluer, and when they flicker again Steve’s dressed in red, white, and blue, a metal disk on his back with the same finish as the bowling ball he hurled, and the man in the purple hat is a different man, a violet cowl pulled over his face, a sword tucked into his belt and a gun in each hand. The room snaps into darkness again—dark, light, on, off—and Steve and the other man are gone, a smear of blood left on the polished floor—the lights flash, a warm, dim, yellow that makes Tony blink, and Steve comes toward him, carrying a water bottle from the vending machine, a sheepish expression on his face—
Steve accepts the cookie, at a loss for words. When Tony isn’t looking, he tucks it into one of his belt pouches. Maybe it will be enough to repay Loki for her help.
Steve shoves Tony onto his back, sits on his chest, and pries his mouth open. He settles his weight there, watching Tony’s face for the pain to hit him. Tony tries to brace himself, but Steve lifts Tony’s arm above his head and then Tony can’t stop from yelling—expelling the only protest his body can muster against the throbbing pain radiating from his shoulder. Steve grabs Tony’s chin, holding his mouth open so he can slam his cock down Tony’s throat.
Tony laughs and releases Steve’s wrists. He laughs harder when Steve tries to push Tony off of him, when he twists, trying to roll them over and drag his hips away from Tony’s.
Correct. Though physical collections of knowledge require a lower threshold or volume of knowledge before developing an L-field, Librarians of Time have recorded L-fields generated by digital repositories as small as 7.6529 zettabytes. I take it you are hoping to use my own L-field in order to reach those which Mr. Stark and the rest of your study group are currently traversing?
This is what every conversation would be like if Steve stayed. Tony, with his vivacious excitement, trying to share the wonders of the 25th century. Steve, unable to follow along, increasingly lost. Tony would keep visiting for a while, coming by Steve’s inevitably old-fashioned and planet-side apartment, trying to find topics they still have in common, but more and more he’ll work with the engineers and inventors and geniuses of this time, until he’s an officer on a United Space ship just like this one, out on the galaxy’s frontier. Out of Steve’s reach entirely.
God, Tony must hate that. Steve can think of few things Tony would like less than having a problem he can’t fix—and when that problem is himself, well. “And he doesn’t want to see me.”
Tony jerks. He deserves that, but it still lands on him like a punch to his solar plexus. "The last time," he says. His eyes fall back to his lap. There's a blank space on his right wrist where no symbols are inscribed, with a pink imprint circling his skin at either end. He wonders why he'd had to be restrained, and how long ago it was. If he woke before, too drugged or too in pain to notice. If he had nightmares. Or if it predates his time here, recovering from whatever-it-is. "The last time I remember," he amends, hating himself.
“I know,” Tony snapped, glaring at Rhodes. “I’m in shock, I’m traumatized, okay, I’m having a speech glitch.”
He sees the writing on his arms when he tosses the dildo away. Tony’s written on him. Tony’s written on him in marker and left him like this with his curtains wide open.
“You should’ve changed my overrides. I could’ve—I can’t—” Steve closes his eyes. “Please.” He’s speaking practically into Tony’s mouth. “Don’t make me do this without you.”
“I know you were—surprised to see me last night,” Tony says, the words tumbling out of him like he’s been saving them up. “I’m not going to hold you to—I know Registration—”
“Yes,” she says, a knowing smirk playing on her face. “But don’t get regular cheese knives from a department store or something like that.”
Steve’s gasp turns into a whine, and then into Tony chuckling against his lips. Steve hurries to kiss back, realization surging against him like a hit that doesn’t land—like a strike against vibranium, the force of it absorbed into the resonance of the metal.
Steve doesn’t expect Pepper to want to be Iron Man any more than Rhodey did, but he asks, and what she has to say is the worst of all.
“I…” Tony blinks snow out of his eyes. Steve’s limned in fuchsia light, like he’s standing in front of the sign of the PH Diner. Pine trees shift in the wind behind him, rendered into dark silhouettes by the sinking sun. “Steve, I see this girl—and sometimes—the snow and—aren’t things just, just
“What are you doing here, Tony?” Steve's voice sounds clearer than his head feels. Whatever hit he took, it must’ve been a big one, for him to still feel it like this.
Doom stands and replaces the armor on his hands. Without a word he strides to where Wormseed, Mugwort, and Slovenwood were. He removes a glass vial from his robes and carefully fills it with the red sand they left behind.
“Tony,” Natasha said slowly, “Can you do something for me? Look at Steve and tell him what you had for breakfast.”
“You didn’t see the expression on your face,” Tony says, hearing the strain in his voice, “when you got to Attilan. I broke us, don’t pretend I didn’t.”
It’s Tony. It’s Tony, unconscious, vital signs stable, sprawled across the most comfortable chair Steve could find without letting Tony out of his sight.
Natasha goes on, “Amora did something that might have helped, or maybe just distracted him” —Steve scowls at that, he
Tony dries off and dresses again. He’s going to be wandering the helicarrier in socks, sweatpants, and the t-shirt Steve wore yesterday.
Steve swallows and withdraws just far enough for their lips to part. “I want you more than I have anything in my whole life.” He doesn’t say,
The other Captain America pivots toward him, shield perpendicular to his body. Steve’s ready for him. He punches his double with his shield over his knuckles. A repulsor is being fired, low to the ground, and Steve leaps to the air before he realizes why he’s doing it, clearing the repulsor blast and kicking forward. He aims for the other Captain America’s star.
Steve wouldn’t go quite that far, but Sam’s probably right. Maybe Steve can come up with a plan that doesn’t involve sex toy manufacturing or imposing on Tony’s generosity.
Heads up that most of the ableist sentiment is I'm this chapter, and not all of it is addressed as such within the text.
The address is that of an empty industrial building. Inside he finds Strange—still in a nonphysical form—and he’s not alone.
Honton’s eyes flick quick-as-a-wink to Stark before he says, “Just a friendly disagreement between old friends..”
Most people would expect that consistent honesty is important for a team. Would imagine that a team could not be a functioning one as long as it contains two members who lie to each other so often that it took three weeks and rather extraordinary circumstances before either of them noticed that they were under a spell
Steve took a moment to parse what it meant that these separate statements were, in Tony’s view, all lies. “It would have changed my opinion of you, Tony. And I like you.” His eyes went wide.
He’s hiding out in the crowded, dusty mess of Pym’s Hardware, having caught Wormseed heading in the direction of the narrow lane between the train station and the backside of the town center. It’s dark enough in the abandoned shop, and bright enough outside, that Tony holds some hope that he won’t be seen.
“Heat helps relieve it, and that includes his hot tub,” Natasha continues, starting to take books and a laptop out of her bag and arranging them on the bench. “I think that’s part of why he didn’t get in more trouble with Fury for building it.”
However, by the above definition, the mission was not, in truth, a success. In point of fact, two team members had been injured and encountered unidentified magic: Iron Man had three bruised ribs, a black eye, a mild concussion, and a cut on his forehead that would require at least super-gluing shut if not a couple of stitches; Captain America had been shot through the shoulder by an overzealous civilian gun owner and been gored quite seriously by a disoriented unicorn; and both men had been hit by an unidentified blast of magic.
We’re not fighting for the people any more… we’re just fighting. Steve removes his cowl and surrenders. Maybe now his friends will stop hurting each other.
Already, Steve’s proximity feels like a hallucination. He’s feet away, now, not even in arm’s reach. As if they’re safe from each other this way.
Tony knew with every fiber of his being that what Carol was doing was wrong. That Ulysses' visions were nothing more or less than profiling. That trusting them had led to the deaths of two of his dearest friends. But if Steve told him to stand down, Tony would. And that frightened him—both the certainty of it, and the knowledge that innocents would die.
“So you do know the word,” Tony says after a moment. He says it lightly, like Steve’s apologizing for using his favorite mug without asking.
This man. This impossible, reckless, single-minded man loves Steve so much he’d rather die than live with Steve believing he’s an agent of injustice. And he antagonized Steve anyway, threw himself close and personal into their battles. Steve remembers how hard Tony hit him at the chemical plant once his armor rebooted. He remembers that awful, brain-shattering sound that gave him the kind of headache that only being punched in the jaw might cure him of. But did Tony ever even fire a repulsor? How many times did they go at it with Tony’s jet-boots on the ground?
playing marco polo across dimensions probably isn’t a good idea since it could attract all the things that want to kill us
Steve launches himself at Tony, clearing the table and landing with his feet on either side of Tony’s. He wastes no time and expends no effort pinning Tony against the wall with one arm.
He could hear Pepper's worried voice among the buzz of sounds behind him, but he couldn't bring himself to move aside to let her be the one crouching at Tony's side. Leaning in, he was relieved to feel Tony's breath stir against his cheek despite the harsh bloom of blood on his forehead. "Tony? C'mon, talk to me... I need you to wake up. Bruce isn't here, so you'll have to open your eyes for me instead." He reached for one of Tony's hands, squeezing it without thinking about how strange it might look to someone watching. All that mattered was Tony opening his eyes again.
Immediately Fitz quailed only to find his spine again a second later. "You should be careful, Jemma."
Steve was on his feet at once, shedding the metal shell with the help of the bots. "Are they okay? Can I see them?"
"That would be perfect," Phil agreed readily. He hesitated before adding, "As for the clothes, I don't mind clearing out a drawer or two." That sounded rather official, rather early on, but he hoped it would be taken in the spirit it was intended. It wasn't meant to be pushing, it was meant to be supportive. The truth was he would just as soon have Clint around as much as humanly possible. Phil already knew he wasn't likely to sleep much the first few nights after Clint decided to go back to his own room. "You're also welcome to borrow something. Probably won't fit exactly right, but it's a standing offer."
Steve’s feet move him across the club without permission from his brain. He’s still clutching the pool cue. He sees Tony ahead of him, his shoulders heaving. Amid the buzz of voices, Steve thinks he can make out Tony’s shuddering breaths.
so I could end up in an l-field that’s one of the ones they might be in but it might be a long time before or after they’re there
It shouldn’t be a relief to feel Tony’s cock drag in and out of him, he shouldn’t relish the burn each time Tony withdraws far enough that his cockhead catches on the rim of Steve’s battered hole. But Steve understands what's between them now: this isn’t the first time one of them has enacted violence on the other, and it may be the most truthful.
Steve’s pulled his own chair close to Tony’s. He clasps Tony’s fingers in his hand. He’ll let go when Tony wakes up. For now he’ll savor the touch. Tony is alive. Tony’s skin is warm, the crooks of his skin brushing against Steve’s own.
Tony reminds Steve of the time Tony thought he was the Chameleon. How easily they patched things up back then.
Another newcomer is in town, too, though no one can quite say which train he came in on. His clothes certainly don’t look like they’ve been worn while traveling or packed into a bag; he wears a white waistcoat, jacket, cravat, trousers, and even shiny white boots, not a speck of sand or road dust to be seen about his person. The trousers, waistcoat, and jacket are embroidered in what Steve might call a plaid if it were in any colors other than ivory and cream on white. When Steve stares at it for too long, it looks like it’s moving.
The everyday traffic of the city has given way to full-blown weekday rush-hour congestion by the time he emerges, and when he gets back on his bike he’s subjected to the regular flow of traffic. It’s slow going back to Manhattan, but between the honking and the exhaust fumes he at least has time to drink his to-go Americano and come up with a plan.
and does your armor protect you from those shadow things? because in that case you should’ve been the one protecting him
Tony learns that magic is real two days into this endeavor—eight days, four hours, and twelve minutes after Steve's death. He’s been counting. He could pin the blame for this on his improper affections toward Steve, and for once he’d like to, but in fact the onus lies entirely with the fact that the sound of that gunshot also marked the moment Tony swore to himself that he'd become a teetotaler.
though the humanoid units shared some physical characteristics with Bender Bending Rodriguez Sr., e.g. humanoid metal bodies colored silver and antennae-type protrusions from the head, these were more streamlined
When Tony passes by the library where Victor has been holed up with the book, he thinks thoughts that don't belong to him. They sound enough like his own voice in his head to leave him with a nauseated feeling.
Carol is the first to fall asleep, facilitated, no doubt, by Jen’s massage. Pepper, Jan, and Rhodes are still chatting and watching videos, despite the dimmed lights and late hour. Jen and T’Challa try to keep their eyes open, but only a couple clips later they’re each sprawled out, unconscious on one couch each. Nat’s on a couch by herself too, situated so she could, if she wanted, be part of any conversation in the room without having to move or yell. She seems alert, spine straight, eyes roving over the room as she absorbs the conversation in silence.
But he came here. Steve can figure this out. Tony came out here, risking his own freedom and reputation, to make sure Steve was safe. He’s angry, of course he’s angry, but he wanted to see Steve. Steve needs to find the right thing to say, for once, or when Tony leaves this time, Steve will never see him again.
Steve used to owe his body to the US Army. They’re the ones who fixed it for him, turned it into a weapon. So he used it as one, and pointed it where they told him to.
"The nude sushi would've been completely fine. But if you'll lay down over here," Tony pointed to a nearby work table, "I can make do with chips and a sandwich. I'm good at improvising."
Logan nodded his agreement, snagging the soap and scrubbing down. "I think I kinda agree," he said, pressing his lips to Scott's throat before herding him out of the spray so he could rinse off. "I might get insecure without you to cuddle. And besides, all the fun people live here," he pointed out with a wink.
"It'll happen," Clint agreed. "And it's good of you, putting her before yourself." The archer fell silent, not quite sure what else to say. Fortunately they rolled up to a massive mansion a few minutes later. "Well. This looks expensive." He slowly got out of the car, looking the place over. "You think we just knock?"
It was on the tip of Scott's tongue to lie, but he honestly couldn't think of a lie that made as much sense as the truth. "I don't know if he's really been... 'compromised', you call it? I don't know if it's that serious. There's something eating at him, but that's Logan. That's how he is. If whatever was in those files triggered some bad memories-"
"I think we fit, too," Clint decided, reaching over the counter to grab the coffee pot and fill his cup without actually getting up. He meant it in more than one sense. He felt there was little doubt that he, Nat, and Phil all fit together as a team. He was pretty sure any other combination would never be as perfect in the field. In fact, Clint's least favorite thing in the world was being the test dummy for new handlers, which was a common occurrence since he had the best survivability when a new handler ended up being an idiot. In terms of he and Phil fitting together... he wasn't as positive, but he knew for certain that it felt comfortable, being with and around the other man.
"I think it might be prudent for all of us to do that post haste," Loki agreed. "I appreciate his position on the matter, but I rather enjoy breathing, at least some of the time."
Steve had the grace to blush. "Give us a half hour, Clint." He knew he couldn't afford to let Tony stay with him no matter how much he wanted it, but that didn't mean he was above insisting on keeping Tony to himself for a short period of time. "Bruce could use the breather anyway." There would be no good argument to that and Steve damn well knew it.
Natasha smiled openly as she saw the faint traces of strain around Clint's eyes. In the field, Clint's poker face was second to none. In bed it was absolutely terrible. She drew him down for a long, lingering kiss. She was getting closer by minute, so it was an easy choice to let Clint off his leash. "Now I want you to fuck me as hard as you can. Make me cum for you."
“Absolutely.” Steve’s phone buzzed, and he reached for it without letting go of Tony’s hand only to frown at the name there. Coulson didn’t generally call without a reason. “You get a shower, get dressed, I’ll meet you in the kitchen in an hour, okay?” He couldn’t resist brushing a quick kiss against Tony’s forehead. “I guess to do that you’ll probably need both hands.” Reluctantly Steve let Tony’s fingers leave his own. Already he missed the touch. “I… yeah. I’ll see you in an hour.” He was blushing by the time he ducked out of the lab again, but already the world felt like it might be a little closer to alright.
The universe apparently wasn't interested in letting them rest too long because a voice cut in, "Forgive the interruption, but Director Fury has requested your presence in the main briefing room."
Tony smiled, settling easily into the new position. "Well, I am pretty enjoyable," he said easily, pressing his lips to Steve's. "And you can take advantage of about anything you want. Pretty sure I'd have a tough time telling you no." He ran his fingers through blonde hair, stealing another kiss before his fingers lightly dipped between the buttons of Steve's shirt. "Pretty sure you've seduced me past the point of being able to disagree with you."
Darien tensed immediately when the woman touched Clint. It was a strange situation to be in. He knew that Clint wasn't invested, not really, wasn't interested in more than a good fuck. When the striking redhead pulled away, he didn't see a great deal more affection there, which made him wonder just what or who Clint really was interested in. "I don't do girls. Just for the record."
Clint frowned at the idea that Stark was being anything but productive when it came to recovering their allies. "Yeah," he agreed, glancing at Coulson. "I'm sure we can convince Cap to let him go... and shouldn't he be too injured to be fooling around, anyway?" Not bothering to wait for an answer, he looked back to Nat. "We definitely need you back out there with us. Agent May scares me." He was joking, of course, but the woman was a poor replacement for Nat, highly skilled or not.
"The outskirts of Calcutta," Bruce said, still looking amused. "Hiding from myself." He sighed. "You know, I always figured that I should run and hide from people, that that was the safest way for me to... well." He fiddled with his mug a little self consciously. "I almost left again after New York." He glanced out the window. It was starting to rain a little. He huffed a soft laugh. "It's a little crazy, but... it was Tony that kept me around. He's such an ass, but he doesn't treat me like a hand grenade someone lost the pin to." Bruce caught himself a moment later. "Didn't." He swallowed around the sudden lump in his throat, looking away and biting his bottom lip. "Sorry. Sorry, I'm kind of killing the mood, aren't I?" he said, his voice shaking a little.
Reaching reflexively for Logan's hand, Scott added softly, "He had to be sedated." It was hard to blame the man with everything he'd been through in such a short period of time. Losing Tony had obviously hit him like a ton of bricks. "Loki looked bad, but he seems to heal fast, and since he's gone... and it isn't like we have something else to hit him with." The man's tone bled frustration. "We don't have a plan C yet."
"Mmhm," Clint mumbled, managing a sleepy smile even with his eyes closed. Exhaustion finally overcame Clint's desire to enjoy the closeness, and he drifted off into a mercifully dreamless sleep.
Tony hadn't missed their reactions, but he could tell it wasn't malicious, and Steve hadn't seemed to notice. Bruce wasn't making eye contact at the moment. That could wait. Either til the meeting, or until after, whichever Tony felt like waiting for. He made a point to settle into the seat next to Steve, then looked to Fury. "So, Nick, which one of us gets yelled at first? I feel like you should probably start with Logan, but-"
Clint carefully hid the feeling of satisfaction he got from seeing the nervousness in Darien's stance. Instead, he just shrugged. "Depends on who you ask. Also depends on whether or not you come willingly." Hawkeye crossed his arms over his chest and fixed intense blue eyes on the other man. "I'm with an organization called SHIELD. We work for the government. You might've heard of the Avengers?"
Clint turned a little, letting one leg drape across Phil's thighs as he fought the urge to fully crawl into the other man's lap. He broke the kiss to let his lips blaze a slow trail down Phil's neck as he tried to calm himself a little, though it wasn't working as well as he'd hoped. "Phil," he rasped, "I am not the only terrible influence leaned up against this tree."
"You knew all this time? Wait, of course you did," Tony said, leaving the wheelchair behind. It was sobering to think that Steve would need it at all, nevermind that he needed it more than Tony. Still, Tony was too happy that Steve was going to be in his bed again soon to let it dampen his mood much. He made sure the brakes were set on the chair, then raised an eyebrow at Steve. "Need a hand?" Tony had to fight the urge to coddle his lover. He knew it wouldn't do Steve any favors to treat him like he was made of glass. He also didn't want Steve to think that Tony was unwilling to help him in any way he could.
"You're one to talk. Fuck, you look good. Feel good." Scott had no idea when his self control had gotten so horrific, but there it was. He couldn't have given up touching Logan if he tried. Instead he wriggled out of his shirt and tossed it aside before dragging Logan over to the bed. He sank down to sit at its edge and hurriedly unfastened Logan's fly. The man was already half hard, and Scott gave the head of his cock a long lick before sucking the rest into his mouth.
Fluff and smut. Tony and Steve earned some. Especially given what's coming down the road... trust me.
Tony wasn't accustomed to having someone significantly larger and stronger holding him close. It felt oddly safe, and the near-constant buzz of internal energy within Tony ebbed a little at the sensationg of security he felt when Steve pulled him in. He sighed, relaxing against the blonde as Steve spoke. The words brought his gaze up to Steve's face, and Tony grinned a little. "I think I might be alright with that," he said, knowing that he was, at the least, committing to some exclusivity. He knew he wanted at least that much with Steve. He also knew it was way too early to plan on more. They were close. They gave a shit about each other more than simple teammates probably should have. // But you have a terrible way of ruining really good things,// a harsh voice in the back of Tony's mind reminded him as thoughts of Pepper flickered through his mind. Shoving the worries aside, Tony leaned resolutely against his lover, listening to Steve's heartbeat gradually slow in the aftermath.
"Camping is good," Coulson agreed. He'd always enjoyed being out in nature, the still and quiet away from daily life. "I'm more a fishing guy than a hunter, though. It's more soothing. I guess work is stressful enough without trying to put a bullet through the eye of a wild pig on the weekends."
Logan nodded amiably. He'd have made the offer himself, but didn't quite know how to do it without seeming weird. "'Course. Wouldn't want to leave ya out in the cold." He knew how hard it was, being alone when he woke up freaked out and trying to figure out where he was. //Now the game becomes trying to not cuddle up to 'im while I'm asleep.//
"Yes! One second." Jemma didn't bother asking how he liked it. She had a good head on her shoulders, and the first thing she tended to learn about anyone was how they liked their coffee or tea. She returned with fresh mugs for each of them in varying shades of brown and varying levels of sweetness, passing them out in turn. "I have a feeling it may be a bit of a late day." Jemma offered Bruce a private little smile while Fitz pored over something beside them. "Not quite a coffee date, but considering all the data we'll be getting, it's a relief to have the help."
"Better me than Coulson," Logan pointed out, climbing into the bed. When Scott looked confused, Logan rolled up on his side to look at the man and shrugged one shoulder. "Dunno. The guy just seems like the sort who'd stand over your bed and watch you sleep. Especially if your name is Steve Rogers." With a sigh, he rolled back onto his back and tried to relax, a difficult task considering he just wanted to grab Scott, pull him close, and slowly fuck his brains out.
Loki fell happily into the kiss, his tongue dragging along Tony's lips and then delving inside. He was sure it was nothing like what Rogers did, but Stark didn't much seem to care anymore. He went for passion instead, pleasuring Tony as best he could so that he could enjoy the same pleasure in turn. Even beneath his confident facade of taking what he wanted, Loki knew that beneath it is something a bit less sure. He felt the need to take what he could of the feelings that didn’t belong to him, and squashed it as best he could by driving harder into Tony's body.
Natasha raised an eyebrow, skeptical to say the least. "Tony Stark giving orders? Sorry, Cap, but there's nothing about that which sounds like a solid solution. Coulson has the most field experience."
"Oh, and I've missed you." Loki might have laughed, but he refrained to avoid ruining the moment. Tony was settled into the fantasy well. He wasn't about to break the spell. Loki drizzled some of the oil over Tony's twitching hole and then started spreading it over. Once he felt the muscles relax, Loki began to carefully twist two fingers inside. "Let's make sure that you're ready for me. How do you want it? Hard and fast, or slow and sensual?"
"I keep telling him that," Scott agreed, moving in behind his lover and kissing Logan's shoulder. There didn't seem to be any particular script to what they were doing, and he was perfectly happy to wing it. As long as they all had a good time, it didn't really matter. His hands slid around front to edge his fingertips into the waistband of Logan's jeans. "Or pants. Pants are overrated."
"Alright, alright. Fine." Tony managed to find some mostly clean clothes to throw on and then took entirely too much time getting his hair put together before he struck out.
Logan's only regret was that he couldn't get a good look at Scott's face. Still, the sight of the man writhing underneath him, the sounds of his desperate gasps, were more than entertainment enough, and the show Natasha was putting on was top notch as well. Logan nipped at the skin behind Scott's ear, then rasped, "Cum for me, slut... show me how much you love this."
Clint was too tired to get reoriented quickly, and it was a good thing his harness kept him restrained long enough for him to calm down. Taking a deep breath, he finally tugged the release and stood with Phil, still feeling painfully eager to go back to napping in the chopper. Instead, he followed his handler to medical, staying close enough that he occasionally bumped lightly into the other man.
Tony nodded. "Yeah, I'd thought of that. I'll see if I can finagle it without Fury asking too many goddamn questions." He smirked. "Also, I wouldn't completely object to you punching him. For Phil, if nothing else," he said, ruffling blonde hair. "Besides, I don't think it'd hurt him that much. And turning him to paste? Then we'd be sending Clint to the Fridge to spend the rest of his days hoping to escape and take over the world. And I think the Megalomaniac section's getting pretty full in there."
Victor was surprised to catch Loki sulking in the command center. The god usually did that elsewhere. "Aren't you a god? Can't you just magic that stuff back to normal?" He was referring to Loki's ribs, of course. "I figured you'd be more capable than me at that sort of thing, at least," he taunted. Victor was smart enough to know that Loki could probably wish him out of existence pretty easily. He also was smart enough to know that Magneto was a pretty big ally of Loki's at the moment, and that the god knew better than to piss Erik off by killing off mutants. He leaned against the door frame and crossed his arms, looking amused. In the relative security of the base, he'd foregone his usual coat in exchange for a simple undershirt, fatigue pants, and bare feet. "You get anything from Jimmy or his boytoy?"
Steve couldn't find the words, and so he just nodded and pretended to be particularly fascinated by his sandwich until he was sure that he wasn't on the verge of breaking down again. It took less time to recover than it had without his friends there. //Which is why you shouldn't be hiding,// he reminded himself. After losing Bucky, it had taken Peggy to draw him out of himself again. He was lucky to still have a team that honestly cared. "Pepper's getting everything settled." The mood was already heavy, so it seemed like as good a time as any to talk about it. "We're hoping... well, we'll give it a few days, but she wants to plan a service. She's the one to talk to if anyone wants to say anything."
The words left Clint fighting to breathe. It was like a punch in the gut, realizing how helpless he was. He started to push himself up, but an overwhelming wave of dizziness and nausea put him right back on the floor.
Watching the men kissing was lovely. It wasn't the hunger, it was the sweetness beneath it that made her unable to look away. Natasha kept things slow. She was enjoying the show, and she wanted to built Scott's hunger carefully so that he didn't go off like a rocket the second Logan finally slid home. It was better to draw it out. They had awhile before the alcohol wore off and headaches and dehydration became an issue. She didn't want to distract the boys, but Natasha still couldn't resist nipping at the skin of Scott's thigh while she slid in a second finger.
Simmons rolled her eyes and started the simulation again. She pulled her phone out and, before she could get nervous and talk herself out of it, shot Bruce a quick text: COFFEE WOULD BE LOVELY.
Steve could happily have spent the rest of the day just like that, tangled up in Tony with the man's lips pressed to his own. He hadn't realized quite how badly he needed the quiet reassurance of knowing that Tony wanted him. "I should make you stay and work," he confessed somewhat breathlessly against Tony's lips. His fingers were already running through Tony's hair and stroking the back of his neck. Normally the whole thing would have been a bit much for him when they were sitting in a thoroughfare where anyone could pass by. Nothing about the previous few days had even vaguely approached normal, however, and Steve wasn’t about to give up the moment.  "I think maybe we've earned some time to be selfish, though."
Scott's first instinct was to be furious. Putting himself out there and being rejected was one thing, but being rejected by Logan when the attraction was painfully obviously mutual made him more than slightly furious. He deflated quickly enough. Scott wasn't sure if it was the buzz or if he was going soft in light of everything he'd been through. He let himself fall unceremoniously onto one of the bar stools and nearly sent it careening over. Managing to right it at the last second, Scott sighed and then let out a snort of laughter. "Y'know, sober I probably never would have said anything. How fucked is that?"
Coulson closed his eyes against the rush of memories. Fury had consented after much harassing to let him see the footage. He'd felt sick. He'd also felt more sure than ever that something more than miracle surgery had happened to him. Coulson realized he was still clutching Clint's hands, the grip almost desperate as his own fears were woken. He wanted to let go, to apologize, but he couldn't make his fingers uncurl. "I'm sorry." It was a stupid thing to say. He hadn't meant to get killed, and he hadn't meant to put himself in danger. It was just the only thing he could think to say.
Tony grinned and moved in closer, kneeling beside Steve's head. He was about to offer his cock to the man when Logan pushed him back. He opened his mouth to protest, but something in Logan's eyes stopped him.
Tony had opened his mouth to tell his lover to lay down next to him when the illusion disappeared. He shuddered and recoiled at the god's touch, fear washing over his expression again. "Don't touch me," he growled reflexively, regretting the words almost immediately. He knew it was partially\ his own fault, and he realized a moment later with a chill that he was more angry that Loki had dropped the glamour than he was that the god had done it in the first place. He took a deep breath, trying to keep himself calm. There was no point in feeling guilty. It wasn't like Steve was ever going to see him again. Mostly, he just didn't like the pointed reminder that he'd been fucking Loki, and he wanted to go back to the soothing deception.
Logan hadn't missed the moment of panic on Scott's face, nor the evident relief when Scott's eyes found him. He couldn't ignore the sense of responsibility that came with that. He was Scott's only anchor, his only comfort. Besides, it was oddly appealing seeing the man in his t-shirt. He glanced at the windows. "About ten hours. You needed your rest, looks like," he replied. He pointed to a fast food bag on the table. "Got you some food if you're hungry." He tilted his head toward Scott. "Then you can tell me whatever it is you're comfortable tellin' me about what happened."
Phil briefly rolled his eyes skyward as if asking for help from above, then explained, "There was an incident when I was on my way to New Mexico," he paused and gave Clint a significant look, "a couple of guys looking to get some quick cash. I dealt with it. I was disarmed, so I had to improvise a little." He glanced back at the clerk. "The donuts did the job, though. The sugar rush managed to take me through the rest of the drive." He grabbed a few more chips. Having his blood sugar out of the toilet was doing wonders for his mood.
Scott cried out, and even he didn't know if it was pleasure or pain. More than that, he wasn't sure it mattered. He took everything that Clint gave him and pushed back, asking for more. "Need it," he panted against the comforter. His well-fucked ass tightened around Clint, clenching as he thrust in as if to hold him there. Scott felt tears in his eyes, but he still didn't ask for mercy. Instead he did everything he could to incite Clint to move, to keep fucking him.
Steve shot his lover a look that warned him he was skating on thin ice. "Nobody's pretending it was a great plan, Director. There just didn't happen to be any better plans. Not one. Unless Thor was on his way down to set everything straight?" The comment earned him an icy glare. "Yeah, it was the only plan."
Tipping his head, Coulson showed off the bruises forming on his neck beneath the starched collar of his shirt. “It was bad. Without my training, he wouldn’t have had any trouble.”
The pain was horrific, but it was honestly nothing compared to how embarrassing it was to lose to the Avengers again when he was so close. The team had been fractured, well beyond the point where he thought they had any chance of managing so cohesive a defense. And of course it had been the archer. Loki seethed quietly at that, the idea that a mortal who had been his servant, had been so willing to give in to his every whim, had been the one to break him down.
Taking the words to heart, Clint shifted his weight to one elbow, leaving his other hand free so that he could slide two fingers into her. He licked at her around his digits before his tongue slowly worked back up to her clit. He teased the nub slowly for a few moments before his lips closed over it, and he began to suckle at it intently. His fingers kept a steady rhythm, thrusting inside her as he worked. These slow, rare moments with Nat were something he rarely got, and Clint wasn't about to give anything less than every effort he had to make it perfect. Their wilder, rougher fucks were fun, but he always found himself wishing they had more time and feeling as if the woman had been torn from him as she so often left with barely a kiss on the cheek and a "thanks."
Simmons knocked gently on Bruce's door. She hated to interrupt him, to interrupt any of them. Even she felt the loss keenly, and Stark had barely liked her most of the time. There were dark circles beneath Jemma's eyes, and she obviously hadn't slept. When Bruce finally opened the door looking no better, she refrained from any expressions of grief. He'd heard a million condolences, she was sure, and would hear a million more. "The Avengers need Captain Rogers now more than ever. Fitz and I are close, but we don't know the serum the way you do, Dr. Banner. We need your help."
Bruce sighed, looking worried as usual but following the rest of the team outside. May was definitely the quiet type, even compared to Natasha. "So, ever been to an alien world before? First for me," he said conversationally.
At first Steve was sure he hadn't heard any of it right, that he was having an auditory hallucination. When he realized that the gorgeous man pressed against him really had said what Steve thought he said, he found himself fighting back tears. As it was, his voice was choked as he whispered back, "I'm a very, very lucky guy," before kissing the top of Tony's head.
In spite of protesting stitches, Tony stretched up for a long, slow kiss. It was impossible not to get turned on at the feel of Steve's cock in his hand. The only thing that sounded better... Tony shifted to lay on his stomach, careful of his injuries, and pressed a kiss to Steve's hip, glancing up at the blonde with a wicked smirk as he continued to stroke Steve's cock. Tony wasn't sure how far he could push with his injuries, but he planned to find the line and threaten to step over it.
"You gonna let me in on this?" The question was borderline impatient, but Alan made only fleeting eye contact, subtly indicating he was still subject to Clint's will.
"Watch what I do," Steve added quietly, his voice shaking along with the rest of his body as he fought to stay stable. "You'll need to do it for Scott." He knew there was no chance, however it went, that he'd be up to saving Scott once he had Logan back to his normal self. Steve drew in another breath and went through the sequence with the same careful deliberation, mindful that Logan was watching, mindful that Logan had a life of his own to save soon enough. He tried not to think too much about Tony sitting outside the door waiting for him. //I'm sorry, Tony.//
"Doesn't matter." Steve stepped into the shower but didn't let the separation linger. He dragged Tony in after him with a grin and pushed the man up against the wall. "This spot?" He nipped and then sucked at it. Normally it was Tony who managed to put his lips in precisely the right place to make him lose his mind. It was a luxury to have the shoe on the other foot and even more of a boost to his ego to have made Tony lose the thread of conversation when they were talking about the suit. "Made me feel close to you, though," he murmured between kisses, "being in the suit and hearing Jarvis." Steve's teeth scraped over the skin, and his arms circled around Tony beneath the pounding spray of the water. "It was like having a piece of you with me."
"Guys..." Clint was holding up his hands and wondering when he became a mediator type. "Maybe... little less angry?"
Inside, Coulson railed against the barrier that meant he couldn't get a shot off. It might not kill Loki, but if it hurt him a lot, it would still have been worth it. "I'm surprisingly hard to kill."
Coulson didn't much like that thought either. Maybe Steve could withstand it. Maybe he could wield the weapon without losing any life force or going crazy - he probably had a better chance with both options than any of the rest of them had - but maybe he couldn't. "Have you told Captain Rogers?"
As much as Steve didn’t want to push, Bruce had been very clear that if Bucky started to remember anything, they needed to do whatever they could to draw it forward. The more Bucky remembered, the better their chance at getting to Hydra. “What is it?” he asked before helping his friend back up onto the couch as carefully as possible. If Bucky remembered something, he might be able to find the people who were truly responsible for Tony being hurt and make sure they never had the chance to hurt anyone else again.
"I am tired, my son. I would like to see your father. Go, see to your true duties." Frigga heels Thor fast for a moment and kissed him on each cheek. "We will speak on your return."
Tony couldn't help a soft whimper as he pressed himself against Steve. "Y-you could just continue now. I'm alright with that," he breathed shakily. He knew Steve was just teasing, but he couldn't help the goosebumps that rose on his skin. He liked the idea of Steve being a little rough with him. Or a lot. "The whole teasing thing? Going to get you back for that somehow. Not sure how, though. Not one for restraint. Don't think I could tease back."
Tony smiled at the sleepy words, holding Steve tight as he drifted off. Tony struggled to stay awake as long as he could just to savor the feeling of his lover pressed close to him. He didn't last long, though, with Steve's soothing presence weighing against him, and he was out before he knew it.
Steve glared back at him, but he couldn’t muster any real anger. The truth was that the words sent a flutter of nervous excitement through him. Spending so much time with Tony had eased him into the world of easy, flippant flirtation. It was safe in a strange sort of a way. Glancing back at the picture, he smiled faintly. “It’s funny, it feels like it was a long time ago for you. For me… for me that feels like last week. That still feels normal. This is still the weird part. Sometimes I think I’m going to wake up back in our old apartment.”
Clint squirmed. "Aside from the lousy wakeup call, it was fine," he grated as Creed tried to secure his arms. The archer's flexibility and speed kept Victor at bay for a few moments until the mutant seemed to get tired of the game and slammed his hands down on Clint's shoulders, pinning him down. The marksman grunted as the wounds on his back were pressed unpleasantly against the rough floor. He met Creed's gaze and fought back panic.
Logan started to protest on the grounds that he was no doctor, but Scott didn't really seem to need a doctor. "Alright," he said, nodding a little. The touch to his arm had been almost jolting, the hesitance and vulnerability in the gesture unnerving. "Lemme just..." Trailing off, he made sure that none of the wounds on Scott's back were dirty or infected, then put the kit away. "Just relax. I'll find somewhere safe." He'd planned to take Scott straight back to Stark tower, but the man seemed to need a few moments to himself. "Take a nap if you can. We've got a bit of a drive."
Clint chuckled. "Well, it wasn't like I had a choice." He wriggled a little against Phil and let his hand rest at the top of Phil's thigh, a little closer than strictly appropriate to much less G-rated areas. "Besides, once I figured it out, I was mostly just wondering what caliber it was," he admitted, looking at the other man through his eyelashes and having the decency to blush a little himself. "Though I just sort of assumed it was less me and more that you were bored sitting still and were thinking dirty thoughts. I mean, that's mostly how I keep myself awake in the sniper nest after the first couple hours."
Steve knew he was staring and knew his mouth was hanging open, but he couldn't really do anything about it. The idea that Thor had been involved with his brother of all people left him utterly speechless. "It... was it... Nevermind, I guess it doesn't matter whether he knew Loki was adopted or not, they were raised together and... wow." He could barely process the information. Despite his intentions to leave it lie and a certainty that he probably didn't want to know more, Steve ventured, "What happened between them?"
Coulson subsided at that, forcing his gaze down. That was true enough. It wasn't his call either. Steve's voice carried more weight than either of theirs. "You aren't expendable," he added so quietly he could have been muttering to himself.
Tony looked down to watch Steve's fingers trace the reactor, then looked up at his lover with a warm, almost impish smile. He was quiet for a long moment, just watching Steve's face, then he leaned up and pressed a slow kiss to the man's full lips. "It's not going to quit. Not before I do." He lightly toyed with a few locks of disheveled blonde hair. "But I like that. You worrying about me. I mean, not that you worry, but... thanks," he finished lamely. Tony could barely articulate how he felt at the moment. The list of people who had truly worried about his safety for reasons that weren’t financial was pointedly short.
Steve smiled. He could hear every unspoken word in the sentence. "Don't worry. Getting everybody back on track is priority number one right now. For everybody." As much as he would have loved to spend the day curled up in bed with Tony basking in the glow of what they'd shared with one another for the very first time that morning, he wasn't going to let the team suffer. "I'm sure between Bruce and Tony we'll have this taken care of before Loki's ribs heal." His smile faltered as he caught sight of Clint's cuffs. "Is that really necessary?"
Clint was glad he didn't have a mouthful of beer. He was pretty sure he would have sprayed it all over the kitchen if he had. His mind raced. On one hand, Scott was probably a little out of his mind. On the other hand, the guy was hot as hell and seemed pretty damn lucid. //On the other hand, he's out of his fucking mind,// his mind argued again. He swallowed hard and set his beer down on the counter, placing his hands firmly on the surface as if trying to get a grip on reality and himself. "I, uh... y-you sure Logan would be okay with that?" he asked. //Wait, am I actually considering this? Fury might kill me.// He stared at Scott and gave himself a moment to take in the view. //Might be worth it, though.//
Darien almost protested, but it dawned on him quickly that there were better things to come. He stripped his t-shirt off over his head and awkwardly managed to shimmy free of his jeans and boxer briefs as well. Unable to resist, Darien gave himself a long, slow stroke as he looked up at Clint. "Now where do you want me?" He had more than a few suggestions, but Clint struck him as a man with a plan, and Darien doubted he'd appreciate an overabundance of feedback.
"We'll sort it out," Logan said, maneuvering closer once more. He leered at Steve unabashedly, hooking a finger in the man's belt loop as a decidedly abnormal glint of blue flickered across his eyes. "It was fun, y'know? Knowin' I couldn't hurt you. Just doin' what came instinctively..."
Logan also left, well aware how much the three gathered at one end of the table needed the space. Besides, he needed to get Scott caught up on what was going on.
Coulson's head fell forward, relief washing over him when Steve's eyes opened. He knew the man was in for a hell of a shock, but he was alive. He was alive and waking up, and he might just be fine. "Tony," he whispered softly to draw the man's attention up again.
Fury shook his head and looked to Phil. "Agent Coulson. You didn't have much trouble convincing Stark to cooperate before..."
Scott had on jeans and had grabbed one of Logan's shirts. It was too big on him, but it felt comfortable. He didn't want a lot more out of the night than to curl up with Logan. Being outwardly marked, at least from his own perspective, made him less anxious about the whole situation. Still he remained tucked in against Logan's side.
Steve did his best to keep his weight off of Tony. He didn't want to crush the man or aggravate his injuries, but his hand did slide down between them to stroke Tony through the thin fabric of his boxer briefs. His tongue thrust in time with the strokes, a teasing reminder of what they'd be doing once Tony was back on his feet. When Steve couldn't take the fabric being in the way anymore, he left off kissing Tony long enough to strip away the boxers and, more carefully, his tank top. "That is so much better." When he lay down against Tony again, their bodies lined up perfectly, cocks dragging together deliciously.
"Love you, too, beautiful," Tony said. Never one to leave a limitation unbroken, he dragged Steve into another slow kiss, holding him tight as he backed his way to the door, letting him go at the threshold. "Keep it warm for me, Capsicle. And bring us lunch. If you don't mind." He knew it had been a stretch for Steve to do it the day before, but he also knew that Steve would have slugged him if he'd thought of treating him any differently for it.
Clint could hear the exchange. His cover blown, he closed on the door to Scott's room immediately. He knew if he said anything into his mic, Logan would likely hear it. He hoped Coulson would realize the archer had his back if it hit the fan.
"Uh, yeah, looks good," Steve agreed, though in truth it looked more like a great place to get tetanus. He was glad for the serum that would prevent it and hoped Tony's luck held out. He opened his mouth to ask why exactly they were stopping in the dive-iest looking bar he had seen since the war when he followed Tony's eyeline. "Oh." Given the man's file, it struck Tony suddenly as stupid that they had been checking in so much nicer places for the first half of the night. Not wasting any time, Steve approached and took a bar stool a seat over before nodding to the grizzled-looking man nursing a whiskey. "Nice to see somebody from the same side of the globe. I'm Steve, this is Tony."
Clint nodded. Feeling oddly nervous, he followed Coulson into the man's bedroom. It wasn't hard to figure out which side of the bed would be his. One side of the mattress was obviously well worn down, the other almost forlornly pristine. Settling on his side, Clint tugged off his boots and then hesitated a moment before tugging his jeans away, as well. He felt unusually self-conscious about still having half a boner as he settled under the blankets, wondering to himself if he'd have the self-discipline to keep his hands to himself. It occurred to him it had been nearly forever since he'd spent a night with anyone but Natasha in his bed, but the idea of waking up next to Phil sounded pretty damned nice. "You don't snore, right?" he asked with a grin.
Natasha actually smirked. It was a very nearly underhanded tactic, and she approved. "C'mon, Clint. Let's give everybody some space. We can go shoot things on the range. It will make you feel better. Logan, you care to join us? You're welcome to invite Scott too. I'd be curious to see how he takes out a target."
Simmons gave him a withering glare, but she couldn't resist the opening all the same. "I actually did say something like that. Well, that we're working on that, in any case. The timeline is tight, of course, but we'll need to do more testing before we could consider someone without an inherent healing factor using even a finished version of-"
Phil reached up, his fingers threading into Clint's hair with a sigh of relief. "No, it isn't. Tony's dead. Natasha, Bruce, and Logan have gone with Lady Sif to Asgard to try and bring Thor around. The only good news is that Fitz-Simmons have created something that they think will get Steve back to normal." It was a small bright spot, but at least it was there. It was something. "We have three messages from Fury demanding that we get to his office and do a full debrief. Think you can handle it?" He knew that throwing himself on the grenade and going down alone wouldn't get them far. It would buy Clint and hour or two, no more, and... well, and then there was the fact that he quite frankly didn't want to go someplace that Clint wasn't.
Bruce snorted softly and looked away. "Anyone ever mention that you have only slightly more of a sense of self-preservation than Tony?"
Loki gave a slight shake of his head. Of course Steve was going to be the most difficult. "Things are not as you believe them to be." Suddenly he wished he'd dragged Stark out with him even if it meant putting the man in the line of fire. At least then they could see that Stark was whole and well. "You have the hammer," he nodded toward Barton, "and my brother. A fool I may be at times, but not so much that I intend to stand against you now."
Tony shivered at the feeling of Loki's breath against his ear, the promise in the god's voice. His jaw clenched as he slowly forced himself to remember that this was reality. He briefly considered pressing himself in close to the god just for the sake of comfort, but he doubted that would be tolerated. He'd gotten all the 'comfort' from Loki that he was going to. "Well, it better be pretty mind-blowing," he returned, hoping his captor had missed him flinching. Tony was disgusted at himself on a lot of levels, but at the same time it was hard to hate himself too much. //Gonna die, right? Might as well go out having fun considering the other option is endless pain.//
Coulson sat down on the grass, scattering some of the food near his feet and watching as a few of the ducks wandered closer to peck at the offering. "I can see why you'd like it here. I like it here," he added after a beat, offering a few more crumbs to one duck who didn't seem content to share with his fellows. The park was lovely, the ducks were cute, and seeing Clint so relaxed was a treat in and of itself. The week had been terrible, the day was still terrible, really, but the moment was worth it. Selfish as it probably was, Coulson couldn't shake the thought as he watched Clint smiling and tossing out the food a little at a time. "This is actually pretty perfect."
Confident that he could likely move more nimbly and safely than his erstwhile companion, Hank grabbed Phil by the waist and leapt for some of the farther shelves, circumnavigating the chaos towards the center of the room and conveying them both out the door.
Darien groaned around the man's cock. It hurt like hell, but not in a bad way. He forced himself to breathe through his nose as best he could and finally found a rhythm that let him relax, get oxygen, and even move a bit. He cast his gaze up and found himself even more turned on as he took in the look of abject enjoyment on Clint's face. Squeezing his eyes closed, he braced himself as best he could and tried to move along with the men pressed into his mouth and ass. The pain ebbed as sheer sensation washed everything away, and soon Darien was moaning in time with Jason's rough thrusts.
Darien found the floor with a groan and almost sat down only to wince and decide to just lie down instead. It still reminded him just how sore he was, but it gave some relief. "Yeah. I think it means I'm mentally deficient, but I had fun." Darien wondered what sort of craziness had led him to be so messed up. //At least I'm not the only one in the room who's crazy.// "And here you didn't strike me as the kinda guy to share," Darien drawled as he propped himself up on his elbows to look at Clint.
"Maybe I don't." He quieted while they drank in silence, staring out at the city and the people walking by the window. "Is Natasha the only reason?" Phil realized the second was clear as mud to anyone not following his internal train of thought and clarified, "Is she the only reason you haven't dated?" Certainly Clint had an active sex life. Overactive at times, actually, from what Phil had seen, but he'd never done anything in Phil's memory that could be considered any form of actual dating, let alone a relationship.

Bucky perked up at the sound of that. "I could definitely use a sedative; a powerful one, if at all possible," he enthused. Sleep had proved to be an elusive beast, and in the rare moments when he drifted off, his slumber was far from restful thanks to horrible dreams. He believed that if he could manage several hours of uninterrupted sleep, he would feel a lot better. "I haven't slept much," Bucky confided in Coulson. "The strange thing is, I don't feel tired."
Surprise lit up Bucky's features. Barring Steve, he had not expected anyone to want to talk about those long ago days. His mind flashed back to grainy images of barbed wire and mud, the deafening sound of artillery and the smell of blood. Just as quickly, Bucky found himself back in the infirmary with Agent Coulson. "We would've been dead ten times over if Steve hadn't dragged our asses out of the fire," Bucky said in a faraway voice. "If anyone deserves admiration, it's Steve... not me."
"I'll get some things moved in and then... when you have a little time, maybe you can help me with the laptop? I know how to do some things, but I want to figure out how to look people up. Natasha said you could find pictures sometimes or just... things about them?" He'd honestly been too scared to dive too much into his own past before, but with Tony just next door it felt safer somehow.
Logan grinned, smacking Scott on the shoulder. "Knew ya could do it," he said, glancing at the wall. "Might not get the deposit back, though. I'm sure Stark'll forgive us. Hell, from all accounts, he's probably done worse to this building." He looked Scott over. "How's it feel?"
Tony hummed his approval of the idea. "I think that's definitely a plan. Shower, sleep... and then you can hold me down in the bed and make sure I never want to leave again, even if I can," he decided, pulling Steve into a slow kiss before his lips moved down the blond's jaw and latched onto that spot on Steve's throat that he knew so well. He raised a hickey there, then grinned as he drew away and moved toward the bathroom. "Just had to do that while it'll still linger for more than a few minutes," he threw back over his shoulder, shrugging off clothes as he walked.
For a long moment Steve had no awareness of anything in the room except for Tony. The man's lips tasted like whiskey, but somehow that wasn't unpleasant. It was part of Tony, one of those dark, strange quirks that made the man so damn irresistible to begin with. Steve was more than grateful that Tony had chosen him over another drink because he wasn't sure he really could have stopped after they came so close. He tested the waters at first with a sweet, gentle kiss, learning the feel of Tony's mouth on his own and relishing how beautifully their bodies fit together as the last of the space between them disappeared. Though he'd certainly never planned to share his first kiss with Tony out in public - not that he'd exactly planned it to start with - Steve found it surprisingly easy to tune out everything else.
"This is... swank, actually." Darien watched the other man curiously. He was hot. He also seemed a little homicidal, but he was hot. //If I have to be on a flight to crazytown, at least the scenery's nice.// "So do you guys pick up every freak you read about, or am I special?" He knew that the Avengers were interested in people with special skills, he had just never expected his to be the sort that a team of that caliber would care about. "And you guys know that apart from the gland thing, I'm just a half-assed cat burglar and con man, right? Not that I'm looking to get my ass tossed out of the helicopter, but this seems like one of those rare times when it's better to have all your cards on the table."
"Steve?" Tony called out groggily. His eyes felt as if two quarters were weighing them down and struggled to flicker open. The last thing he recalled was talking to Steve, and then blackness. Had the medication done a number on him? Somehow Tony doubted it. What he was feeling right now was definitely something different. "Cap?" Again, no response. Tony tried to move only to find that his arms and legs were being held down. //What the hell?// It was a little too much to hope that Steve had suddenly broken out of his shell and was trying something kinky. No, something was definitely wrong.
Coulson smiled in return and nodded. "True. Though he does still owe me a new set of cards." Hard as it had been to talk about the situation at all, it felt better having done so. A SHIELD shrink was helpful in a way, but having a colleague to connect with was a lot more therapeutic as far as Coulson was concerned. "Between the two of us, I wonder exactly how many 'suggested' hours of counseling we've burned through. I'm guessing more than average. I guess Logan's next up in line. I just hope we can get things straightened out with him. No one deserves to have Loki in their head."
Coulson discreetly sent word to have medical on hand at the cells. If Steve didn't handle it as well as he thought he might, Coulson wasn't taking chances that any intervention would be too late.
Fury settled back in his seat, staying quiet so long that Tony was about to ask if he'd flatlined. Finally, the Director sat forward and looked Steve hard in the eyes. "Rogers, the Avengers are yours. You take control of this... situation, and make the call. And you," he pointed at Thor, seemingly unphased by the fact that the Asgardian could crush him like a bug, "you're staying with him if we're not putting him down. He's your deadbeat brother."
Simmons was beginning to realize that Tony was only dimly hearing the things that they were saying and looked to Bruce. She didn't like the line of worry between his brows. She tilted her head, silently questioning, but received nothing more than a head shake in return. The longer they worked, the more she was beginning to wonder exactly what they were really doing. Stark was too intense, too intent, and Simmons had the sinking feeling that he wasn't working for Logan, he was working for himself. Unable to keep quiet, she ventured, "Maybe we should bring Logan in this afternoon, tell him what we've been working on, give him some time to think about it."
"Tomorrow. After you've slept and rested and the doctor lets me take you home to keep in bed... for more rest. Until I can-" Steve's phone buzzed, and he fished it out, expression grave as he read the update. "Logan's back. Natasha isn't. Still no idea what Loki wants." He tried to shake it off and force a flicker of a smile. "She'll be fine."
He just didn't hate it enough to want to die, and staring down the barrel of a mobster's gun, Darien found himself wondering how likely that was. He could quicksilver again, of course - indeed he was fighting the urge to do so as fear trickled down his spine along with a trail of sweat - but the guy could probably shoot him before he managed it. He had only wanted to conserve a little time before his next shot. The Keeper had already been on him about using quicksilver too freely, and Darien didn't want to get an earful about it when he got back from an already unapproved mission.
Clint gasped as Darien's muscles clenched around his aching cock, slamming forward and cumming hard as Alan found his release almost simultaneously. As the last tremors of his orgasm passed, he untied Darien's hands and then sagged back against the wall behind him. With a gesture, the other two men in the room put their clothing back together and left without a word. Clint offered Darien a faint smirk, sagging to the floor and letting his head rest against the wall with an intoxicated-looking grin. "Have fun?" he asked casually.
"From what I hear, you need to give that speech to Fury," Logan countered. He indicated Clint and Nat with a tilt of his head. "And how about the wonder twins? Can't tell me that they've shared everything with you. Willin' to bet the stuff they're talkin' about right now is just between them." He shrugged. "Should listen to Scott. I'll take care o' my team." He squeezed the man's knee. "Even if we fight a little."
Emerging from the bathroom, Tony mentally summoned the nanobots, letting the suit form up to his waist before he stopped it. He pulled Steve close for a long, slow kiss before letting the red and gold armor swallow him up to his neck. "Ready?"
Steve watched in surprise as Pepper moved away to speak with some of the people standing worriedly on the sidelines and dismiss the remaining crowd. His forehead creased. Had something happened between Pepper and Tony? If they'd broken up, Tony certainly hadn't said anything. Of course, he never said anything about his personal life. Forcing that back for exploration at another time, Steve gently rubbed his thumb over Tony's palm instead. "You heard the lady, I need you to keep those eyes open. How are you feeling? You've got a nasty cut on your forehead, and your breathing sounds a little off..."
"Once we have a decent buzz on, we should see about some dancing." Scott nudged Logan. "What do you say?"
Scott was glad to have permission. He fell back onto the couch and dragged Logan down on top of him. "I do. I really do. So what I need is somebody who can distract me." Scott looked up at Logan from beneath heavy-lidded eyes and challenged, "Think you can fuck the concentration out of me?" It was cheesy and stupid, but they needed a little bit of that after such an absolutely shit day.
Clint was definitely surprised by the choice. That said, he was pretty damned excited. He was forbidden as a field agent to get inked, primarily because tattoos were too easily identifiable, but he had to admit to loving them. "This is... actually awesome," he said, grinning broadly, hands shoved in his pockets. Phil looked fucking amazing, too. Clint had been sneaking glances at him the whole drive over. Phil always looked good, dressed up or down, but Clint couldn't help but appreciate the man's meticulously casual appearance and the way the shirt's collar complimented his strong jaw. As they got through the gates and drifted into the expo, Clint found himself brushing against Phil occasionally, and finally pulled a hand out of his pocket to offer it to Phil with a shy smile.
Steve tried not to look as annoyed by the remark as he felt and instead nodded his acceptance of the advice before veering down the hallway toward the room where they had Bucky sequestered. Bruce looked up and offered Steve a smile a beat before Bucky turned as well. Bucky managed a quick, flickering smile. “Nice to know some things never do change - some of us haven’t aged a day.”
"You know, I might be able to swing that kinda subtle," Logan decided, smirking faintly. "Well, I'm sure if we walk around here long enough, I could find someone who needs their face remodeled."
"I need to fix Logan." It was clear that he wouldn't be able to help them all. If Steve could stand up to one more bout with the gun, he could help Logan and then Logan would be free to save Scott from whatever spell Loki had cast. "Help me up," Steve requested quietly.
Unlike Logan, Steve couldn't help but smile at Tony's incessant wheedling attempts to get another drink out of the man. Still he snapped to focus at once when Logan asked about their potential foe. "More the second one, I think. He's a literal demigod. The upside is that his brother's fighting with us, the downside is that he's a real handful. This isn't going to be easy, but, then, you don't strike me as being much for easy. When Tony's a little less, um, relaxed and we're someplace more secure, he can pull up the files we have." Unable to resist asking, Steve ventured, "How far back to you remember?"
Logan shook his head grimly. "Not much. She was fine last I saw her. He hadn't exactly threatened any injuries to her, either. Just said it'd be easier on her if she cooperated. Told us both that, actually." He paused, the faintest flicker of something else passing over his eyes before he added, "He did threaten to hurt 'er if I didn't cooperate. I wouldn't be surprised if he's played with her memories." It was a decent way to possibly cover his ass on what he'd done.
Steve frowned at the suggestion. "Not yet." His expression softened as he observed, "The upside of Fury's paranoia is that he's probably thought about that already. It looks like Loki wanted something in particular, information maybe. I guess something Nat knows too. Mostly I just want her home and you," Steve gave his lover's hand a warm squeeze, "back in one piece."
The treatment was enough to make Steve whimper, but he got himself in control long enough to say, "Y-yeah. Think I mentioned that, yeah." He rolled his hips back to try to entice Tony to more. "I, uh," he fumbled under one of the couch cushions and then held the bottle back toward Tony. "Might've planned ahead a little." There were definitely times when it came in handy to be overly prepared. "Not that I doubted that you'd have everything you need, but I really, really don't want anything to stop you from fucking me right now."
Clint grinned as Phil pulled him close and defended him like he was a puppy that had been chewing up Nat's shoes. He stuck his tongue out smugly at the woman. "Mostly. Besides, I'm house trained now. And way too adorable to get rid of, no matter how impractical I am. I feel the need to point out, though, that I also travel extremely well. I can fit myself in a suitcase, and I'm multifunctional," he pointed out. "So, completely practical. And adorable." He punctuated the sentence by giving Nat his best puppy dog eyes.
Logan nodded. It scared him a little to think that the Avengers might not be able to help them. He didn't want to know what SHIELD would do with him - or more importantly, Scott - if they decided he was a permanent liability. The feral mutant plucked up his courage for a moment before he looked at Steve again. "What I did earlier... Well, I think you know it wasn't me, but I still feel like I oughtta apologize. And tell ya thanks. For makin' sure I didn't hurt anybody."
"Black 'n' angry," Logan said, reaching for one just in time for Tony to snatch it first. Unwilling to admit to irritation, Logan took the last mug standing.
Clint relished the way Phil looked at him, touched him like he was a piece of art. His eyes flicked open at the question and he looked down at the scar Phil was referring to. "Undercover in Iraq," he said with a faint smile. "Some of those infantrymen are a little... rough around the edges. Got shanked with a multitool for... well, I have a big mouth sometimes." The potential underlying meaning of that statement caught up a moment later, and Clint's smirk turned into a wicked grin. "In more than one way."
"Fine, okay, you're right. I like Clint," Steve allowed, though he didn't bother to try and pretend he wasn't pouting just a little. Tony owed him, and he intended to make the man pay up. "And I love you, so no paste. Promise." He found himself kissing Tony's neck, nipping at it in a foolish, pointless sort of punishment for the man's crimes. Ultimately he couldn’t be angry at Tony for being stupid and desperate. He'd felt the same way, he'd just dealt with it differently. "Luckily for you I don't have much room for feeling anything but really glad that you're alive and here with me even if we are going to be sitting in a room with Loki all evening. Do you think... I mean, they wouldn't... he and Thor... it's, uh..." Steve shook it off. "I'm sure it's all past tense."
"Agent Coulson will be coordinating on site, and I'll be here on the comms. You need something we can send your way, say the word," Steve affirmed with all the strength he could muster. SHIELD agents weren't going to be much more than cannon fodder, but they'd be enough to help with the Brotherhood and keep the situation somewhat contained. Steve hoped that coordinating that side of things would help him not think so much about the fact that Tony was putting his life on the line in a truly terrifying way and that the rest of his team was just as endangered. "Take him out. Contain the Brotherhood, bring them in if you can, but Loki goes down."
Natasha shook her head. "You're going to make him kill you, and you're going to deserve it, and I'm not going to do a thing to stop him," she explained patiently. It was nothing short of a miracle that Logan and Scott were both being so at ease. She'd seen Scott cast one or two uneasy glances at Clint, but it didn't seem like there were any hard feelings. Loki had been pulling all their strings. They had that in common, and a common enemy was no small bond. She smiled at Logan and regarded the target again. "I suppose it'll have to do for now."
Clint tossed a smirk back at Logan as he threw his bow over his shoulder and moved towards Coulson. He leaned on the agent's stall partition and folded his arms, waiting for Coulson to finish his round of fire and the target to come back to them. When it did, he tapped on Coulson's earpro and raised an eyebrow. "Conversation with Fury went that well, huh?"
Fury pushed himself out of his chair. "Go get suited up. Time for a day at the zoo. Be ready for a shitstorm, but don't start anything. Coulson, give them the coordinates."
"Good. Barton and I will rendezvous with the Captain, Iron Man, and Banner. Keep us informed." Phil finally let his hand fall from Clint's shoulder. "We need to do what we can to help the rest of our team. If Loki wanted us here, he's probably got someone keeping them busy. His version of busy tends to be dangerous. Summers, let them know we'll intercept in five."
"Never say no to an offer like that." Especially since he had been instructed to make sure things would be as difficult as possible for the man after his rescue. The Avengers would be focused on his ordeal, think of that as the punishment. In truth it was little more than a catalyst. On the table full of instruments next to Tony's cot was a package of condoms and a tube of lubricant. Hydra was nothing if not thorough. The Soldier smiled grimly to himself and stroked his own cock to full hardness before releasing the ties holding Tony's legs to the table. He was too far gone to need them. With no further time spent on preparation and instead a liberal dollop of lube, he lifted the man's legs, spread them and slid home between. "Is that what you need?"
Though she looked no happier about the idea, Natasha held her position. Her bravery aside, it was easy to read the pain she was in by the careful way she held herself, the deep shadows under her eyes, and the uncharacteristic tremors in her hands. "Go."
Logan paused. //Well, if I'm gonna jump in, might as well with both feet.// "Alright." Stark wasn't exactly the guy he'd pick as the extra, but at least the man wasn't bad-looking.
There were tears in Steve's eyes as he held Tony close. "Bruce is right." It killed him to think of hurting Tony or leaving him behind. "If there's a chance that this works, we have to take it. If it's too bad, I can stop and you can keep working." He glanced up to see a look of blatant skepticism on Fitz's face.
“Sure thing, Steve,” Friday says. “Initiating blackout within a 15-foot radius of your comm signature.”
But sometimes—like a favorite handgun that was manufactured with just slight imperfections, such that its balance was unlike that of any other of its type and the weight threw off the aim of anyone else who tried to use it—being different than expected is exactly right.
When he returns, he sidles right up beside Steve. Their arms brush as he pours in the beans and flicks the switch. The machine works smooth as a hot knife through butter.
The cobalt of Tony’s eyes glints with the sky-bright blue glow from the node embedded in his chest. He searches Steve’s face. Steve wants clarity between them, but he doesn’t mind being a puzzle to solve as long as Tony’s here to decipher it. After a moment, Tony nods.
If there’s some other version of himself who first saw Stark when he was stumbling out of a saloon singing like a burro with a bad cold, Steve doesn’t know whether to pity him or envy him.
“Hill called it a ‘goddamn Norman Rockwell painting,’” Sam says, to some laughter. But Tony knows better—he’s too familiar now with midcentury representational art to miss what an inaccurate analogy that is.
He’s utterly calm when he does it. Tony never thought he’d miss the anger that used to accompany Steve’s violence.
he can't even finish the question in his own mind. "Are you okay, Steve? It sounds like it's been—difficult."
He can’t help but wonder sometimes what it would have been like if they’d met in the evening, when Stark was deep into his cups and barely able to keep himself upright.
“Trust each other anyway. Tell each other the truth about what’s going on, so we can take care of ourselves as well as each other.”
“Oh, yes,” she says, as if agreeing to something rather than replying. “You’re both welcome to stay here. Or, as I was going to say, we can return you to just a second after you left, or anywhere and anywhen you like.”
“Hey, Once and Future Captain,” Tony says, swiveling in his office chair. “The Leverage team with you there?”
No, fuck that. He swallows around a piece of hard metal, like Iron Man’s armored cock is slamming against the back of his throat. Tony made this from the same building blocks he uses to remake his body, and Steve wants it to enter him with the full force of a tactical battle armor.
“We’ll both stop,” Steve says. His reply is so simplistic, so mundane that it barely corresponds to the question it’s meant to be answering. It’s jarring after Steve’s earlier fury, laced with determination and forced calm.
It's like falling from a great height. Tony's heart is in his throat. As much as it feels like they did this only yesterday, it also feels like Tony would never get to do this again.
For a moment the only sound on the line is Barnes’ faint—and slightly staticky, stupid iPhone—breathing. “Why are you calling me?”

Steve and Straughan walk Daisy over to Stark’s so she can be shod. They don’t need Steve’s help getting there, but Clive doesn’t comment and seems to enjoy the company. Maybe between him and Stark, they can convince Clive to get all new shoes instead of just resetting the loose one. Straughan's always riding in and out of Oak Creek and having her shod by the farrier there, who doesn't fit his shoes properly. She’d do much better with all four shoes of good quality and hammered in by someone who’s actually up to trap with a hammer and forge—and at that, Stark’s fine as cream gravy.
Getting to his feet is easier than he’d expected. Affecting a drunken shamble toward Rogers' window is even easier. “Oh, Danny boy!” he calls.
They each have a primary yellow power that can trigger the other’s alt yellow power. If Tony is dealing the most damage, Steve’s yellow will in turn deal the most damage to him, bringing Tony to 15% or lower health. If Tony stuns Steve, he then distributes damage to Steve’s teammates, bringing their health down to less than 10% or 25%.
"Civilian" here means a bystander who is not an active member of law enforcement or peacekeeping efforts, and therefore not involved in a conflict being handled by the Avengers.
Most of the people he overhears at the beach seem to be locals. They bring tote bags of blankets and shawls and express nonstop surprise at the warm weather and how they didn’t even need the jacket they brought. They play music on their little waterproof speakers and don’t seem to care when the sound is overwhelmed by the waves.
Outside of cattle season, Timely’s small enough that Steve can, for the most part, keep track of who comes and goes by train. This morning there’s some of Danny Rand’s family, a couple legal associates of Murdoch’s, and new hands for Black Bolt Ranch. The trains also bring the usual bevy of businessmen and travelers, there to stay the night at the hotel before the next train out to Antelope Wells or Deming.
When Steve had shouldered Tony off him, the armor had looked—other than the smears of blood and incongruous bullet holes—the same as it had when Tony had visited Steve in his cell.
Steve nods. “Other stuff, too,” he says. “But I guess that’s the big one. They gave me some inhalers, it helps a lot.” He thinks but doesn’t say:
Steve pulls out before he climaxes to splash Tony’s face with his come, then bend down and lick it off. “You’re a mess,” he remarks as he laps at Tony’s skin.
“I might visit Alcatraz,” Steve replies, lifting his luggage out of the man’s arms and carrying it into the tiny lobby without another word.
Dr. Strange appears, blue-tinged and translucent, in Steve’s office—some kind of astral projection or magical hologram. “Meet me at this address in half an hour,” Strange says, and vanishes. A scrap of paper lands on the floor where the apparition of his feet had just stood.
Tony meets his eyes blankly. Steve clucks his tongue, but doesn’t push it for now. Tony’s going to pay for not replying. But Tony would pay for anything he said, anyway.
“That’s an objective statement, the antithesis of which can have only one meaning. Okay, right after SHIELD fell?” Steve nodded. “Before Ultron?” Steve nodded again. Tony took a moment to think. “Was it after this spell was cast on us?” Steve shook his head. “Right after?”
Is it weird to wish that his hearing were even more powerful, strong enough to hear Tony’s heartbeat?
This is his home. This is what Steve has left: his world, his fury, and his teammates. A thrum of rage beats just out of sync with his pulse. This is his advantage.
“Stark,” Wong says sharply. “You must not open this book. To do so is to imperil your very soul. It will call to you, but you must not give in.”
Steve’s feelings aren’t hurt. He’s not surprised or angry. He’s not—anything. He wonders when Tony stopped trusting him. If he ever did. Tony hiding this from him would have meant something to him, once. But this is just another fact. Tony thought he knew best. Tony died because of Steve, thinking that Steve hated him. So what if Tony kept this from him. It’s just something else Steve can’t do anything about.
Wormseed tilts his head, reminding Tony of a barn cat watching a mouse. “I’m in your charming town to find a certain book. It was stolen from me, you see, and when I heard tell that it was in Timely, my associates, as you call them, accompanied me here to retrieve it. Do you know where my book is, Mister Stark?”
What’s more likely is that Tony’s suspicions are true, and Steve is in an impossible situation, trying to shield Tony from the truth of the danger they’re both in.
How did Apple get to town to ride out with everyone to the mines, when last we saw her she was at Doom Manor? Um,
Steve fights to keep his voice even. “It gonna keep you from singing the whole town down like the walls of Jericho?”
Steve, who was wearing a crimson henley, squared his shoulders, turned to Tony, and pronounced, “Blue.”
Thank you for going to the Archives and for being such a good friend to Doreen. I’m glad you’re Avengers.
“You look like Buzz Lightyear and Woody,” she explained, gesturing at Tony and Steve, her tone suggesting it was obvious.
By this time, Steve’s super-soldier serum had rendered any trace of his injuries undetectable. Tony had patched himself up to the best of his ability. “Patched up” is a phrase which here means “covered what was left of his black eye with makeup.” Tony characteristically had dark circles under his eyes from lack of sleep, and, in order to maintain symmetry, covered the dark circles under the uninjured eye as well as the bruising on the injured one. It was expensive makeup, and expertly applied, but, several members of his team—who were various combinations of trained spies, good friends, and observant people—got a close enough look at him to note the absence of the dark circles and correctly surmised that he was trying to obscure an injury.
“Let me get this straight. You’re calling me,” Barnes says slowly, “because you’re taking Stevie out on a date. And you want my advice?”
Tony’s been asking himself that question. But now he’s on his knees in front of the Hydra Supreme Leader, hearing it in Steve’s voice.
Deals 1100 damage, plus 73 for each Team Cap Escalation tile, 98 per tile if target is Team Iron Man, or 105 per tile if target is Iron Man.
They stop for short rests and drinks of water, and then a longer one for some bread and apples. Tony budges over so they’re sitting pressed close. When he finishes eating he rests his head on Steve’s shoulder.
“Yeah,” Tony says, not quite a question and barely a word to which meaning can be ascribed, just a sound he makes because speaking gives him the illusion he has control of this conversation.
"I'm not sure," Tony says, more because of the way Steve is looking at him than because of the drugged haze of his mind. He can't make sense of the expression on Steve's face, though he should be able to.
Tony hugs the box to himself. “Hey, these are mine! You want Rhodes cookies, you become Rhodey’s best friend, or you suck up Mrs. Rhodes, but these are all for me.”
“So that’s it, then,” he bites out. He feels huge, brutish, standing here gnashing his teeth and lashing out in mindless rage. “Ten years of friendship, and I kill you, just like that.”
This strikes Steve as wrong—if poignant—for two reasons. One: Tony has put more of his money into charity in the last year than every other billionaire in the United States combined. Two: Steve’s ma taught him that gifts are about the thought behind them. If someone gives you a present you don’t like, you accept it graciously and thank them earnestly, knowing that what they’ve really offered is evidence that you’re in their thoughts. The object itself can always be discreetly disposed of later. So it shouldn’t matter that Tony can buy whatever he wants, because maybe someone will think of something that never occurred to him. Or, if they can’t think of anything, they could even make a donation to one of his favorite charities or just make him a simple card, but it seems insufficient, boorish even, to bring nothing at all.
“It didn’t come up,” Steve says, willing away the heat in his cheeks and immediately regretting his choice of words.
The hands retreat. Tony knows Steve is far from finished, but his body is already sagging in relief.
The next morning he sits at his usual spot at the inn’s attached diner, watching people walk their dogs, wait for the bus, and listen to music on their headphones. He thinks a woman across the street might be walking a potbellied pig on a leash.
His way slopes ever on and ever down. The stench of fetid breath pervades, as does a growing sound Tony recognizes in seeping dread to be the huffing of hogs devouring raw flesh.
Thirty-six hours before Dr. Strange was scheduled to return to his home dimension, War Machine, Falcon, and Black Widow successfully tracked down the Asgardian sorceress they had fought 3 weeks previous. The Vision and Scarlet Witch stayed at the compound to monitor James.
“Can’t Friday monitor us just well from our quarters as the doctors can in here?” Steve asked the room, cutting Tony off.
Tony doesn’t hear a peep about him stabbing a stranger in the neck, nor anything about a man vanishing quick as a wellspring in a desert. Not even from the Parker boy, who’s been poking around just across the way in Banner’s shop.
we’re supposed to pick a time in superhero history where different parts of the multiverse connected and then explain to the class what happened and how they got unconnected again
He tried to be happy that Tony invited him at all. If only Steve hadn’t had such unrealistic expectations.
“It was the liquor,” Stark says. “But it wasn’t only that. Worley, ah. Honton, that is. He saw me with a fella. Bit of a compromisin’ position.”
“You’re such a fucking mess,” Tony says approvingly, then draws Steve in and kisses him over the gag, lapping at the drool dripping out of the corners of Steve’s mouth, skimming his teeth over Steve’s lips, mouthing at the bar lodged between Steve’s teeth. “If you’re good, I’ll take this off you tomorrow. Give you some water. Let you blow me. Can you be good, Steve?”
In the final scene, Brickenn and Klithua are fatally wounded after fighting off the Star Cullers. Brickenn exhausts the scant strength he has remaining to activate the Forge of Stars, which will build a new sun to replace one that was just annihilated. It’s too late for the inhabitants of that solar system, but it will be a beacon for others—another light in the sky. It’s too late for Brickenn and Klithua, too, bleeding out faster than they can signal for help.
This earns Steve a flick on the nose. “I’m prettier, too,” Tony says through a grin. “Which sign was your favorite, then?”
There's an ache behind Tony's eyes that threatens to manifest as tears. He clenches his fists, then forcibly relaxes them. His gaze falls on the symbols written onto his skin. All he has on is a thin hospital gown, and the cuff on his left wrist covering his soulmark. It's plain, old-fashioned in style—nearly a twin to the one Steve had been wearing the day Tony's dreams had come true. The last day he remembers.
“S’pose so. Talked to a lotta people. People don’t care much what they say in front of the town spooney.”
He's a fool. He was duped so easily. Of course it wasn’t Steve who pulled Tony aside and showed Tony his soulmark. Hydra must’ve faked that somehow. It’s not supposed to be possible, but they did this to Steve and brought back Tony from injuries that should’ve left him dead; they have the resources to fake a soulmark, surely.
“Are you,” Tony begins, speaking into the mattress, letting the thorough embrace of Steve’s weight buoy him. He wants this, he wants Steve’s touch, his attention, the press of his body, just like this. He wants it. His strained legs twitch from exertion. “You’re angry with me. Because of whatever I did that I can’t remember.”
“He collapsed. Bug Woman had to practically carry him out of the Blasting Range,” Loki says, sounding excited. Steve clenches his fists and reminds him that punching Loki won’t actually improve the situation. Well, it might feel good, but it won’t help Tony. “She neglected to take a selfie to commemorate the occasion. It seems she is capable of restraining herself at times.”
“No, of course not. Hmm. When the spell makes you say you like me, are you trying to say that you don’t like me?”
I think it’s a bookshop. Or maybe someone’s house. It doesn’t seem to be organized like a library, and we keep finding empty cups of tea, but there aren’t really prices on anything.
By the end of it, Steve’s gotten a fair few rounds off, though Mugwort reacts to them like he’s been bitten by a particularly large horsefly, Slovenwood grimaces and plucks them out of his flesh like splinters, Wormseed doesn’t seem to even feel them, and Doom’s armor serves to protect him from everything but a single shot through his shoulder.
Steve gathers Tony in his arms. Tony comes easily, tucking himself against Steve’s front, resting their foreheads together.
“And Worley had it? If it’s worth that much, he needn’t've come all this way an’ try an’ get money offa me.”
“It’s a California King-sized bed,” Tony says proudly. The crimson bedspread matches the wallpaper perfectly.
“Maybe,” Tony says, laughing a little. He takes a sip of his coffee. Steve made it perfectly, like he always does, with as much sugar as Tony wants, rather than the amount he says he takes.
“You know,” Tony muses, skimming his fingernails up and down Steve’s torso, “I would have done anything for you.”
“Don’t do that to me again.” Steve’s voice rumbles over Tony’s lips. His fingers drag down Tony’s cheek, along his jaw. His other arm wraps around Tony’s waist.
She asks him why he would ever leave such a paradise, and he closes off again, replying tersely that he’ll return when his work is done.
“No sign from any of my fellow legal staffers that the new security guard might be Captain America,” Hardison supplies.
Steve can almost imagine staying, with this kind of resource and entertainment at his fingertips. But it wouldn’t be the same without Tony.
The others aren’t there for long, really. Not nearly as long as Tony was gone. Tony and his partners claim the bed, so Tony’s right in the middle, and he doesn’t push Steve away when he leans against him. Tony never takes off his shirt or pants, but Steve can feel his skin through the fabric, can feel the muscles in his arms move as he lets first the woman, then the man, ride him. Steve shuts down his mind and focuses on the points where his body touches Tony’s.
Tony's assent must have shown on his face, because Steve had barely finished speaking before he was tugging off the glove of his right hand. Tony froze, heart racing. For that action to follow that statement—but Steve couldn't be showing him what Tony hoped. Except Steve was folding the sleeve of his uniform back, and there was his wrist cuff beneath it, and—
Once Steve is settled on the couch, Tony connects to the line designated for the Leverage team. “Alright, we’re all set up. Looks like they’re not on the call yet.”
to see you? That I give a fuck whether you literally die in a fire? Shows what I know. My mistake, so if you’ll excuse me, I believe I was trying to make my exit—”
“I could’ve killed you.” He draws his gaze from Tony’s lips to his eyes and, oh. He’s about to cry, too.
Tony lets Steve take his hand again and lead him into his bedroom. Steve strips out of the bulkiest parts of his uniform and without further preamble tugs Tony into his bed. Tony must be able to read every wish and desire in Steve’s heart, but he settles against the mattress wary and frowning like he doesn’t know why he’s there. Steve wraps his limbs around Tony’s body, hoping that will be explanation enough. It feels like he’s holding a firefly in his fist and watching the light come through his fingers, knowing he’ll have to open his hand eventually.
He pictures Tony’s body in its golden coffin, momentum unchecked in the vacuum of space, ice crystals in his veins, stars going dark around him—the universe dimming and disintegrating in his absence.
“Have you noticed that when we ask questions we’re able to tell the truth?” Steve asked not long after Sam and Rhodes had departed.
Fog creeps up the edges of the sky as they approach the Pacific, but is still overwhelmed by clear blue. “It’s never like this in the Presidio,” the driver says as he takes Steve’s bag and starts carrying it toward the little inn where Steve has a room.
Tony doesn’t have the strength to move. Even shifting his weight so he settles against the bedding ignites his body in a fresh wave of pain. He grits his teeth against it and tries not to think about what’s coming next.
He reread the whole book that night while the snow fell, and in the morning dragged himself to work, sapped of heat and wakefulness, aching in new ways. Still, he started it again the next night, slowing down to savor the overwritten emotions and ostentatious alien landscapes.
Steve jogs to the marina, then hugs the coast along the edges of the Presidio, Lincoln Park, Golden Gate Park, and the Outer Sunset. At the zoo he turns toward the financial district, and at the ferry building he heads back toward his hotel.
Steve catches Tony’s eye, then, or maybe it would be more accurate to say he snags it, like a half-healed papercut against a bramble bush. Tony catches his right back and holds it, his gaze a knife against a whetstone as he searches Steve’s face. Steve takes a breath to speak, but before he can, Tony says, “Let’s check out the rooms they’ve got us in. I wanna get out of this armor and see what showering is like in outer space.”
Steve shifted, smiling at the touch, and finally opened his eyes to see Tony staring sleepily back at him. "Morning," he murmured, shifting and stretching and then placing a hand over the arc reactor at the center of Tony's chest. "Remember when you promised me that this thing wasn't going to kill you? That it's saving your life? Remember that. The next time you fly off," Steve explained, his voice rough with sleep but the thoughts sharp in his head, "I won't be beside you. I need to know you aren't going in there with a live bomb strapped to your chest. I need to know as much as I ever can that you're going to come home to me, Tony."
Scott's back arched, his mouth hanging open in a silent cry of pleasure. Maybe it should have hurt being taken hard and fast by someone as strong as Logan, but instead Scott felt nothing but heat. More often than not, Logan managed to drive thrusts directly into his prostate. Stars swam behind Scott's eyes as he finally let out a gasp of pleasure. "Fuck me, Logan... so good..." He'd never experienced anything like the intensity of being possessed by Logan, and he hadn't realized how badly he needed just that kind of release.
Steve slowly rubbed his hand over Tony's hardening cock by way of response. He really did care about Nat. He really did want to see her, but that was off the table, and for the time being, he wanted Tony even more. It was a dangerous thing to be so entangled so fast and be so willing to put Tony before the rest of the team. He watched the billionaire closely before moving down Tony's body. He pointedly ignored the man's injuries in favor of carefully hooking his thumbs into the waistband of Tony's underwear. Steve inched the fabric down so that he could kiss his lover's hip.
Scott melted against Clint's muscular body. The leather pulled at his hair, making the discomfort more intense - and by turn the sensation. He groaned and responded with another kiss that left absolutely no doubt of precisely what he wanted. "I hear you know how to take charge. Show me." Scott wondered where exactly he'd heard that, from whom. What kind of rumor mill would he have encountered going nowhere but Logan's bedroom except when his skills were needed to help with field coordination?
The suction and the feeling of Tony pressing into him were enough to leave Steve squirming beneath the other man. His cock pulsed in Tony's grip. He was lost in thoughts of how hot it was, the idea of walking around with a prominent reminder to anyone who cared to look of exactly who he belonged to. "Tony... that's... so good," he panted. "All yours." The fingers of one hand clutched at Tony's hair, and he used the other to blindly grope for the lube on the nightstand. He pressed it into Tony's hand. "Might need this."
Loki gazed back just as intently. He relaxed his mouth to let the whole of Victor's length slide easily into his mouth and finally his throat. He loved the look of bliss on the mutant's face as he let himself take what he wanted. They both wanted it, after all. They both had needs that were being met. It was obvious that despite his apparently thick skull, Victor had the good sense to be frightened of him, yet he wasn't hesitant. Loki hoped his partner for the evening was smart enough - or stupid enough, as the case might be - to forget himself and make the chase feel worthwhile for them both.
"No, thank you. I'm alright." Steve was blushing by the time the man turned his attention to the next customer and glanced over at Tony. "Well, the people are friendly. Do you come here a lot?"
Logan noted that there were a few guys already eyeing him, and glanced at Tony. "Uh, I think there was an idea about getting drinks *and* women."
Clint felt the weight lifted from him as Victor stood, but panic set in yet again. The feral mutant was stalking towards Phil now. Like Phil, the archer had no idea how much time they needed, but he was determined to buy them every minute he could. More specifically, he was going to buy it for Phil. Bruised, lacerated, and sore, Clint still pushed himself up off the ground as if it was nothing and lunged at Victor's back.
Tony nodded, taking in Steve's expression, mannerisms and the way his skin flushed warmly. The temptation to tease the other man even further proved impossible to ignore. "Well, that's a shame," he decided, giving Steve a friendly nudge, "great-looking guy like you going to waste. Doesn't seem right to me." Shifting closer, Tony's dark eyes burned as he added conversationally, "Pepper and I have what I'd call an open relationship." He noted the frown which shadowed Steve's gaze. //Time to elaborate and gauge his reaction.// "Neither one of us minds if the other takes an interest in someone else."
"I think anyone who doesn't threaten to kill me every few minutes is a bit unstable, so I may be a poor judge," Loki allowed with the faintest trace of a smile. "Perhaps you're simply a good person. Those tend to confuse me." He shifted and looked almost uneasy. "I apologize for what happened. Well, I do and I don't. If I hadn't taken you to bed, I suppose we wouldn't be speaking now, but it was... it was the wrong thing to do." Whether the loneliness was overwhelming or not, it really didn't excuse the action. Stark was the first person since he realized the depth of his brother's indifference that Loki thought he might find a true ally in. An apology was the least he could offer. "We've broken even on secrets we can keep for one another, but I owe you something beyond that. It is a debt I'll find a way to pay."
Off in a world of his own, Tony jolted at the sound of his own name. Tony hated jumping at shadows. His attempts at mustering some of his trademark cool and witty demeanor failed miserably. He did not want to see anyone, let alone talk to them. "I'm fine, Natasha," came his murmured reply. "You don't have to keep checking on me." Tony's body betrayed him, giving an involuntary shiver. He felt like a helpless kitten left out in the rain for far too long, and that made him feel even worse about everything that had happened.
"By which you mean it's nice I haven't been force-fed a tranquilizer sandwich by Fitz?" Bruce asked, though his usual sphinx-like smirk played at his lips.
"It will put you back on track to being in the field, yes. The process won't be as quick as Dr. Erskine's original formula. This works only with the serum already present in your body, so it will be slow at first. The cells will be... well, will be woken up for lack of a better explanation. Then they'll begin spreading, reproducing. It may still be painful, but it should be nothing compared to what you went through the first time." Simmons paused to let Steve absorb the news. "Are you ready, Captain Rogers?"
It didn't take long for the hard thrusts slamming against her g-spot coupled with Clint's pelvis grinding against her clit to get Nat the rest of the way there. She'd been on her way from the moment he slid home. Natasha played her second climax for all that it was worth. Good as it felt, she wanted Clint to know precisely how well he'd done and screamed her pleasure loud enough to assure that anyone with a room close enough would get an earful.
Tony leaned in and nipped at the spot behind Steve's ear that he knew could make the man squirm with a little more insistent pressure before he drew back. "I'll hold you to that," he said, his voice deeper than it had been a moment before as he gave Steve a decidedly hungry look. He pressed a much more chaste kiss to Steve's lips, then pressed their foreheads together and sighed. "Alright. Fine. But I guess if I'm going to get anything done, you're going to have to not be so distracting."
"I say that sounds fantastic," Bruce decided, standing and offering a hand to Jemma. He stepped into the warm afternoon sun, walking slowly and grateful for just how pleasantly normal it all felt. "But I thought you didn't believe in Asgardian magic," he teased as they walked. "I thought it was all just technology we don't understand."
Steve bolted upright at the cry, sure that Tony was being attacked. It took a beat for him to register that they were alone in the room and that Tony wasn't crying out in fear or pain, he was panting and hard as a rock. Steve's blood ran cold at the realization, at what it could mean. Dreams didn't have to mean anything. They might mean absolutely nothing at all, just nonsense, but then he met Tony's dark gaze, and the intensity of the guilt there left him feeling sick. "Tony... what happened?"
"Wonder how Scott's doing with Lady Sif. She seems... interesting, actually," Natasha observed. The woman was icy cold in battle, but she didn't seem like a bad sort. Of course maybe that was just the fact that she hated Loki with equal passion. It was the kind of thing that made Natasha feel closer to anyone. She eyed Clint carefully. "You and Coulson should get some rest, hit the showers. We can baby-sit him the rest of the way down."
A flicker of amusement passed over Clint's eyes as he gave the man a nod. "Here to help," he replied, sitting down in a nearby chair. He typically saved his touchy-feely moments for Nat, and those were rare. He trusted his presence was enough to show his support. It was hard to see Stark so shaken up. The man usually covered his stress up by being more abrasive and self-aggrandizing than usual. It was strange to see him look so broken, though the afterthought of thanks was definitely more familiar.
"Terrifying. Perfect." Scott laughed. He was almost shaky with relief that it had worked and, more, that he'd been able to stop it again. Impulsively, he turned and threw his arms around Logan's neck. "I can't believe I can do this. I can't believe I..." He refrained from thanking Logan. That felt too much like an admission of Logan's guilt. "It'll take a lot of getting used to. I think-" He heard a cell phone and let his hand slide down to pull Logan's from his pocket before handing it to him and releasing his hold. "Looks like you've got a message."
It took every ounce of Phil's self control not to throw himself between them. The fact was that they needed Loki's help, and even if it made him sick to allow the god to lay hands on Clint, it was for the best. He hoped.
He rolled out from under her and was about to ask what the hell Tony had done when he saw Phil holstering a strange weapon. "She's not dead. Just out. Should stay that way for awhile. Barton, you think you can help Hulk take down the walking shag rug?"
Nervous at first, Clint's muscles uncoiled as Phil slowly examined his hands. The contact was simple, soft and gentle and strangely perfect. The archer realized he'd stopped breathing and reminded himself to inhale as gentle fingers traced over hard earned calluses and scars, and Clint found himself surprised by how good it felt. It was intense and intimate on a level Clint hadn't realized existed. Looking up at Phil, his cheeks flushed faintly pink. He felt more exposed and vulnerable in that moment than he ever had in the field or with his clothes off. "Cou -  Phil... feels good," he murmured, smiling hesitantly. He couldn't remember the last time he'd felt nervous fluttering in his stomach when someone touched him. Probably when he was a teenager.
Clint squeezed Phil's hand and smiled, feeling better. He had to remind himself that relationships were a step at a time process. Trying to see things two weeks ahead was stupid, and trying to project further out was even more idiotic. "I do like you," he affirmed with no hesitation. "A lot. Still kind of feel dumb that I didn't think of this before. See, and now you're stuck, because I have enough of a clearance level that just dying won't get you out of this. So you might be stuck with me for a minute."
Steve drew in a breath and said, "Okay, that's got us. Everybody who's going, suit up. The rest of us will be here on call, hopefully with some of the X-Men within the next hour or two. Be careful." He rose, shaking each person's hand in turn and nodded to Lady Sif. "Everyone who's going with Sif, meet her out front."
Scott laughed at that and began to move. He didn't mind the commanding grip. There was something thrilling about knowing that Logan could take charge anytime he wanted. Given their situation, Scott knew he should have been scared. He'd always been smart, a survivor, but he couldn't bring himself to be scared. Instead he did his best to keep to his promise of starting off slow even as it drove him crazy not slamming himself down onto Logan and taking everything he could with every thrust.
Tony managed to drift off after an hour in which his mind ran through scenarios and specs and generally tried not to think too hard about the possibility of plan B having to be applied. He didn't really remember drifting off, but he woke easily enough. Steve had shifted onto his back in his sleep, and Tony had apparently followed him, leaving his arm draped across the blonde's chest. He pressed his lips to his lover's shoulder, watching him intently.
Natasha abandoned the blond girl to sidle up next to Scott and Logan. "I really should have taken bets on this one. I thought Clint would take longer to crack."
The door closed quietly, and Phil tried to look utterly at ease as he climbed back into the safety of Lola's driver's seat. "You're lucky you didn't get your mind melted," he commented as they started back toward home.
Natasha reached up, smoothing Scott's hair. "I think the two of you are adorable. Besides, it's more productive this way. I'm pretty sure you'd be killing each other if you weren't fucking."
"Phil," Clint whispered the man's name softly. It was a warning. He caught Coulson's gaze and shook his head. Taunting Victor seemed like the wrong idea. Clint had seen the mad dog type before, and Victor definitely fit the profile.
"Only when you're not talking." The retort came quickly and easily, and for that Coulson was grateful. If he'd given himself a chance to think, to blush, to get flustered, Clint would have smelled the strangeness a mile away. It was better to play things as cool as possible. Phil was still trying to put as much as possible of his energy into not thinking about Natasha, and he tried to chalk his sudden obsession with leering at Clint to that. His brain needed distraction. Clint was an excellent distraction. Full stop. "So not often, but... you have your moments."
They used to be friends. Tony can’t stop reminding himself of that. But this is what Steve thinks of him now.
The next day he visits Coit Tower. He climbs up and down the stairs twice before he starts getting strange looks. He wanders through the streets of Telegraph Hill, counting wild parrots. After the forth he climbs Coit Tower twice more; none of the faces he sees are the same.
“Welcome, Avengers,” she says. She sounds calm, friendly, not overly bright or gloating or surprised. She is, as far as Steve can tell, unarmed. “I’m sure you have a lot of questions.”
A week after that first arcade visit, Steve and Tony have been back to the arcade twice, met for pizza once, grabbed coffee between classes almost every day, watched old episodes of Star Trek, had drinks at Club A with Jan and Sam, and even gone a few rounds of pool together. They’ve studied together, too; Tony helped Steve with his chemistry, and somehow when Tony explained it, it was easy to see how exciting it was, to visualize how the most basic of elements could interact and create new things and how to use that to predict outcomes and solve problems and make things. Steve thinks they’re well on their way to being good friends again. Maybe best friends. Like they’d never had that stupid Civil War at all. Tony’s even made sure to ask Steve more than once to make sure he’s coming to Tony’s birthday party next month.
With his mobility limited like this, all Steve can do is try to use his neck and shoulders to draw his mouth along Tony's length. Tony quickly loses patience with this and grabs Steve by the hair, using it to drag his head up and down. Then he grows bored of that, too, and grips Steve by the back of the neck, shoving Steve’s face down onto his cock and bucking his hips so it hits the back of Steve’s throat. The freshly-shaven hair at the base of his cock scratches Steve’s dry lips.
Next is Steve’s present. He both wants Tony to open it right away, and to put it off until the end to stave off his own embarrassment. The gift is wrapped a little messily, and Tony rips through it messily too, a gleeful expression on his face. There’s a custom wooden box Steve commissioned to hold the knives, made of walnut and lined with crimson velvet. The little sound Tony makes when he sees what’s inside is one Steve will treasure forever.
Deals 2285 damage, plus 165 for each Team Iron Man Escalation tile, 190 per tile if target is Team Cap, or 235 per tile if target is Cap.
It could be nothing. Everything could be just as Steve’s said. Except Tony thinks he might remember what the smell of ammonia reminds him of.
except she also said that it’s a network connecting libraries and bookshops and you’re not either of those
except 10 minutes ago everything went wild and the numbers we got kept jumping up and down by huge amounts, seemingly at random
He nearly sobs when Tony touches him again. A hand in his hair, gentle at first, then gripping, tugging his head back.
“That’s not my home any more,” Steve says after a moment. Tony’s his home. If he can’t have that, he can go where he’s useful.
Two guys take the lane next to Steve and Tony’s, one wearing an olive green tee and faded yellow sneakers, the other in a knit purple hat, both nearly Steve’s size. They play side by side in peace for some time, long enough that thoughts of the little girl trickle out of Tony’s consciousness like droplets condensing on the outside of a glass.
Hill has been trying to get help from the sorcerers but they’re still on their field trip to the astral plane
Other times, it leaves us wondering: which part, exactly, is the lie? What information does this lie give us about this person, their motivations, and their true intentions?
“I know terrible things have happened,” Tony says. He sounds too remote, even to himself, but it’s better than the raw misery it masks. “And I hate it.”
True! But he seemed unable to perform magic, or at least unable to do so easily, now that he’s an orangutan.
Steve wouldn't leave him somewhere with no one to look after him. Not if there was any choice. Even if Steve hated him, he wouldn't deny anyone medical care. And whatever Tony's done, whatever Steve thinks of him, he was here, and he was speaking to Tony, and he promised he'd be back. That's more than when Tony woke up in Oklahoma.
Steve’s hand wraps around Tony’s throat and sinks the weight of his forearm onto Tony’s chest. The spasm of pain in Tony’s shoulder knocks the wind out of him even as the grip on his neck tightens. Steve drives into him harder, faster, rocking Tony’s whole body.
But Steve just looks at him like Tony’s a puzzlebox he’s failed to open one too many times and is ready to smash apart—and Tony has time to close his eyes after all.
Instead, the meeting followed the planned agenda. After reviewing the events of the battle—again, neither Steve nor Tony mentioned their injuries—the topic turned to the contents of the Hydra files Steve and Natasha had leaked some months prior during the destruction of the Project Insight helicarriers.
He wakes up early the next morning and takes his motorcycle into the city. Sam is already up and stretching his wings, soaring high above SHIELD headquarters and the highest reaches of Stark Tower. The hedgerows and brickwork of campus soon give way to the concrete and dense bustle of the city, and Steve loses himself in speeding through town, weaving in and out of the sparse, pre-dawn traffic, lanesplitting and swerving and probably getting in a lot of trouble with Fury but having a great time doing it. He has hours before his first class of the day—he’d picked his schedule this semester with more of a mind toward a certain tech genius’ circadian rhythm than his own, meaning that even though they don’t have many of the same classes they’re roughly on the same schedule—so he drives all the way to Park Slope to his favorite bagel shop in all of Brooklyn.
Tony’s eyes have an amber cast to them in the twilight. His lip curls. “Yeah, you’re right, I guess the only option
Honton’s cornered Stark at the hotel bar this time; Honton screeching like a banshee, Stark hissing and spitting in a voice too low for Steve to hear. He’s only on his second tumbler of the night, though it’s been full dark out for near an hour. Honton’s lucky to have caught him so early into his now-nightly drinking routine. Then Steve remembers how pretty a tale Stark tells even three sheets to the wind, the clever words that spill out of his mouth even when he’s down to only a handful of his wits, and thinks perhaps Honton’s not so lucky after all.
Bucky and Rhodey and me were going to the computer lab but I think we’re like… stuck in a stairwell now?
How many times has he awoken in the night? Fully dressed, a laptop or stack of files in his lap, overcome by a devastation that strips the air from his lungs. How many nights has he turned his face to the wall and cried?
Steve eats his corned beef sandwich and glances at them in the mirror. The fella in white catches Steve’s eye in the reflection and winks.
A man wrapped in white cloth pulls up to the shore in a small punt. Its sides are painted by algae in a noxious green like the soup Bruce’s been cooking up. The man beckons them, and, with a glance at Tony, Steve climbs into the boat. Tony follows. The boatman lifts his pole and ferries them across the river in silence.
Tony goes slow, telling Steve how good he was, the way he didn’t interfere in Tony’s fun, how he laid back and acted as decoration for Tony’s little party. Steve sobs with the joy of Tony’s cock and gives himself over to Tony’s praise.
“Everyone in Timely, come on out!” Rogers shouts. “We can take back our government right now! For too long, we've looked away as Roxxon, Fisk, and his assassins have forced us to live in terror! Come out of your houses! Come and demand to live free! Come out and say ‘no’ to the land-grabbing, come out and say ‘enough’ to the water-stealing!”
"I can do slower. Promise," Tony said, smiling down at his lover. "Also... since we don't have time to go shopping, and since I figured you might not be feeling up to going to the mall, I had Jarvis find some stuff for you. Should be in our room by the time you get back." He didn't realize he'd verbally made his room into their room, continuing softly, "I, uh... your file said you had some eye problems, so there's glasses, too. Hopefully they're your style." He gave Steve's hand a gentle squeeze as they stepped into the elevator. It still felt weird, looking down to make eye contact. Tony was fairly used to having to actually look up ever so slightly to talk to the man. He gave the blonde a faint smile as the elevator slowed to a stop a few levels lower. "I think you'll look good in them."
“Yeah. So, uh, filter. It’s probably gonna need to be backwashed and it’ll need new sand. Ideally, you backwash it after the pool’s been cleaned, but-”
Steve glanced across the room, spotting Tony lounging in the shallow end of the pool, his chin resting on the edge of the pool and watching Steve with those annoying, calculating eyes of his. Steve didn’t have it in him to come up with a smart-mouthed retort, so he pulled off his backpack, yanking the zip open. Pulling out the fish and the plastic box of vegetables, he dropped them unceremoniously by Tony’s head, ignoring the way Tony flinched back.
“There are seventeen people onboard,” JARVIS replied. “This was not a scheduled trip, and no tickets were sold. The main casino is empty, leading me to believe there are no civilians onboard.”
He dragged himself into a shower and getting dressed, foregoing the two flights of stairs to the kitchen and taking the elevator even though he knew Tony would laugh at him if he saw him. Thankfully, when he arrived in the kitchen, Tony was already there pouring coffee into a travel mug that he held out.
“I think that’s just going to make your blood pressure rise even further,” Tony chuckled. “Counter offer: we round up the gang and go clubbing tonight?”
“Stevie. You don’t think it’s a little too convenient that you told Tony Stark about my cancer and then a few weeks later, I get a place on a previously underfunded drug trial that is already showing good results?”
“Because you have this pathetic need to please people because you think if you do, they won’t leave you even though it’s never worked before.”
is that BuckyCap art by Quinn?!!! I cannot get over how amazing it is. I asked them to create this and they completely blew my expectations out of the water! If you want to check out more of their art check out their Tumblr
“Is that the crash Stark went out to?” Clint asked, nodding towards the monitor in the corner of the nurses’ station that someone had turned on to the local news. Shaky footage taken from a helicopter above the scene zoomed in on a crashed SUV with-
“-father was the head of the department when he left Yale and gave him the job over other better and more qualified applicants,” Romanoff recited, fixing Hank with a look.
“Uh… Okay, this is kinda complicated,” Steve sighed. “I need your help in looking into Stark Industries.”
“Shh,” Tony murmured. “Don’t do that to your papa. Call me if you need anything,” he told Steve. “I think we still have some of those elephant tranquillisers we used on Thor when he sprained his ankle.”
“Fixing things isn’t really my strong point,” Steve admitted. “Not unless it’s something that can be fixed by me getting my ass kicked by someone bigger and stronger than me.”
Steve took the thermometer wordlessly, sticking it under his arm and hunkering down again. Tony stroked his hair while they waited for the thermometer to cheep, wishing there was something he could do.
“We hid out in that bakery for two weeks and put on three pounds each,” Bucky reminisced with a smile. “I got Tony to take me back once, see if it was still there. It’s an apartment block now.”
A flash of red and blue highlighted Bucky’s position, the shield slicing through the air, then a burst of lightning split the sky, taking out several of the robots, and Thor appeared. Steve chewed on his thumb nail, nerves twisting in his gut like a snake, winding its way around his airway and squeezing tight.
“Fuck,” Steve growled. With a huff, he found his laptop, opening the Domino’s website and placing an order for a plain cheese pizza because he couldn’t bring himself to decide what toppings he wanted. Then, finally, he stripped out of his dirty clothes and stepped into the shower to scrub himself clean.
“You look comfortable,” a familiar voice called a few minutes later, drawing Steve’s attention from the Tumblr app on his phone.
“I may have some experience with that phenomenon,” he admitted, before leaning in to kiss Steve’s neck.
Finally they made it to the doors of the courthouse and they stepped into the cool marble of the atrium, the shouts of the reporters, relegated to wait outside, echoing behind them. Only then did Steve feel like he could breathe again. He unclenched his jaw, letting the tension bleed out.
“She’ll be fine,” Natasha assured him. “I’m pretty sure it’s just a minor fracture, but we’ll get it x-rayed just in case. The bad news is, because this is a minor injury and you’ve got such a brave girl here-” Lorna beamed at her, “-you guys are going to have to wait a while. I’m sorry.”
He wouldn’t give up his daughter for anything but there were moments when he realised how much easier it would be with someone to help. Moments like this. And he couldn’t always rely on Tony to be there to help.
He was brushing his teeth when he heard footsteps approach; a few seconds later Steve appeared, rubbing his eye and yawning.
“I’m not giving up,” MJ declared, clenching her fists. Her eyes shimmered with unshed tears. “I can’t. I’m not going back to-”
“What time is it?” he mumbled instead of opening his eyes to look at the clock that was right there.
They made their way through the lobby - Tony threw the receptionists and security team a wave on the way past - into the Avengers’ private elevator. Despite the fact they were the only ones in the elevator, they stood shoulder to shoulder. Steve turned his head to bury his nose in Tony’s hair and Tony had to fight back a grin.
Steve balanced on one foot, supporting the bag of takeout with his other knee to free up a hand to unlock his apartment. He winced, wobbling from side to side, biting back a growl because of course the lock had to choose today to stick. Without warning, it swung open and Steve stumbled into the apartment. Glaring at the door, Steve kicked it closed with a, “Yeah, well, screw you.”
“Because if there is proof, it’s going to be on his computer. Probably in a ghost drive. Do you know what a ghost drive is?”
“Wow,” Steve exclaimed when Angie opened her bedroom door, the fringes of her dress swinging, the sequins catching the light with every move. “You look hot!”
Tony stared at him, like he couldn’t believe Steve was real. He cupped his cheek, kissed him with a kiss that somehow succeeded in being both hard and gentle all at once, fanning the fire in Steve’s veins higher until he was scrabbling at Tony’s shoulders leaving pink lines where his nails were digging into Tony’s skin.
Gary huffed. “Mom, I’ll call you back, but don’t delete anything, okay? Okay. Love you too, bye. What do you want, Barton?”
“I have something I need to tell you,” Sharon interrupted. “I was scared to bring it up but then I realised I was being stupid. Chances are, all my worrying is going to be for nothing. So here goes.”
Steve’s face lit up, and Tony made the decision then and there to do whatever he could to make Steve smile like that for as long as he lived.
Tony watched Steve’s throat bob as he swallowed, his tongue darting out to wet his lips. His hair was sticking to his forehead and he looked so beautifully debauched, Tony wished he could capture it forever.
With a sigh, he rolled off of the couch, padding across the apartment to make a BLT. His phone buzzed across the room as he returned the lettuce to the fridge. Licking mustard from the heel of his palm, Steve sat back on the couch and picked up his phone. He had a new message from Peggy with a video of Zoey dancing with Daniel.
Tony released the skin of Steve’s neck, running his teeth over the reddened mark and feeling a thrill skate across his spine when Steve whined and writhed below him. His mouth fell open, the muscles in his abs dancing with each shallow pant.
And, Steve was beginning to realise, there were worse things to be than just Tony Stark’s boyfriend.
“Tony. I love you, but you’re wrong,” Bucky replied. “You need something. Someone. You don’t do well on your own.”
“Four-thirty,” Steve replied, his voice a quiet rumble in the warmth of their bedroom, before pressing another kiss to Tony’s spine.
with claws?” Tony said. He shared a smile with Steve, squeezing his hand reassuringly, and Steve found himself slowly beginning to relax.
Steve rooming with Bucky bothered Tony more than he cared to admit. There was no jealousy, but he feared for Steve's safety. Unstable did not even begin to describe Bucky Barnes' condition. Although Tony had been loathe to delve into the background of the man, a part of him wanted to understand more about Bucky. "Just promise me you'll be careful," he told Steve somberly. "I know you're capable of looking after yourself, but I don't trust what he may or may not do."
"Alright, it's a deal then," Tony agreed, parking his expensive sports car. "You know what that means, don't you? You're going to owe me one."  He smiled and clapped a hand on Steve's shoulder, noting the mass of coiled muscle beneath his palm. "Don't worry - your undying admiration will suffice." Stepping out of the vehicle, Tony joined Steve on the other side and led him into the house. Almost at once Jarvis' voice welcomed him home and acknowledged Steve as well. "Make yourself at home while I slip into something a little more comfortable." Tony paused, regarding the other man thoughtfully for a moment. "Care to borrow some of my clothes? If you want to shed that monkey suit, you're more than welcome to."
One sappy borderline chick-flick later, Tony was giving Steve a sort of judgmental, sideways look as they made their way back out to the parking lot. "I'd say I want that ninety minutes of my life back, but at least there were some hot people in that movie, and I got to cuddle you." He glanced in the rearview mirror as they drove away, then frowned. "Same pair of headlights. Goody. We've got at least one set of camera-fucks following us," he noted.
Bruce grinned broadly at that. "I thought I was supposed to be the old, wise one here," he teased, grabbing a bite of muffin. "Alright, fine. So we're alright with the possibility of an impromptu third wheel, then. And you're right: I don't get to talk to many people that can keep up with me and who also happen to be cute and single." He blushed a little a second after the words were out, but didn't retract them. "So, I think I promised to tell you about my recent vacation. Anything in particular you're curious about? Keeping in mind that I didn't get much of a chance to stop and smell the... well, whatever they have up there that passes for roses."
"Oh, yes, right." She put her shoulders back and grinned. "Agents Coulson and Barton are back. They're safe. Well, relatively. They went to medical, but it was routine, I suppose, and they're still being debriefed, but they're back!"
The archer had the weapon on the plane's deck between his feet, fiddling idly with the strap while Thor sat across the aisle from him, watching him uncomfortably closely. Clint leaned hard against Phil, not wanting any space between them. He didn't yet feel much of the tug from the hammer, though he did experience an unusual surge of confidence every time he touched it.
Steve wondered briefly if it was too much or not nearly enough and blushed at the thought. He reminded himself that he had sworn off lusting after coworkers, but that was easier said than done when Tony was drinking and flirting rather shamelessly. He tried to focus on his Coke for a minute and only succeeded in catching the bartender's eye. The man smiled warmly and offered, "You sure you don't want something harder, sweetie? Something tells me there's plenty of guys who wouldn't mind you getting a little tipsy."
Tony raised an eyebrow but didn't argue. He was raising his hand to knock on Fury's door when it opened on its own.
Logan glanced at Scott. "Maybe we could call in some o' the X-Men to at least hold down the fort while the rest of us go to... uh..."
Being reminded that he'd be getting Steve with lunch served to motivate Tony significantly, and he grabbed for his phone with a smirk. FOOD? I'LL EAT ANYTHING. JUST KEEP IN MIND THERE'S AN AUDIENCE DOWN HERE.
With Steve out of the armor, it was an exercise in every ounce of discipline he didn't have for Tony to remain still long enough for Simmons to make sure he was alright. The second she gave him permission to move again, he was across the room and tugging Steve up against him. He didn't give half a damn that the man was covered in sweat or that there was a significant audience. He needed to feel his lover against him, to breathe him in and touch him.
The man - bulky, hairy, balding, and terrifyingly Eastern European - shrugged one tattooed shoulder. "I have special. Only one. You not like," he said in an unplaceable accent.
Already pale after the attack, the remaining color drained from Bucky’s face as he balked at Steve. “Better? How could me remember doing God knows what possibly be better?” The outburst pained him, but it kept on rolling like a runaway train. “Don’t you get it? If what just happened was a preview, then I don’t want to remember!” He drew himself away from Steve, feeling not only angry but a sense of betrayal. “If Tony Stark was sitting here I’ll bet you wouldn’t be putting him through this.” The words stung, and Bucky promptly shut himself up. Where had that come from? “Steve,” he started, ashamed of his actions. “Look, I’m sorry. Hell, I don’t know what’s wrong with me. No, that’s not true. I do know.” Bucky glanced up, his eyes dark and filled with regret. “I’m jealous. Jealous of the feelings you have for Tony. It’s what I’ve always wanted you to feel for me, but I never had the guts to come out and tell you back then.”
The words spoken in such a dark growl had Steve gasping even before Tony started to fuck him open. Steve clutched at the sheets and rocked carefully back against his lover. "Tony, it... Tony..." There weren't any words, really, and Steve gave up trying to find them. He knew there was a distinct chance he'd regret what they were doing the next time he tried to sit down too fast, but he didn't care. "You feel so good," he finally panted.
"You could say that," Clint dead panned. "I assume you're not just calling to ask me about my daily routine."
Clint raised an eyebrow. "Made out on the dance floor?" he echoed before he had the decency to remember that it sounded a little judgmental. Steve had neglected to mention that part, and Clint sure as hell wouldn't have guessed. Coulson seemed to be dealing with the news fairly well, though. //Good to know he's open-minded, at least.// Then again, the idea of someone working at SHIELD simultaneously dealing with random aliens, mutants, and science experiments and being homophobic was kind of the real paradox, when he thought about it. When the other two men looked at him, Clint gave them a sheepish grin. "Sorry. Forgot to take my smart phone with me for my morning dump. Missed the headlines. And... I mean, Steve... Again, you've completely crushed all my assumptions about you."
Logan raised an eyebrow. "You rebel, you," he deadpanned as he started to dry himself off. "Never would'a pegged you as someone who'd snooze through a meeting. I'd figure that'd be tough to pull off with the Professor around." Tossing the towel carelessly on the floor, Logan sidled up beside his lover and gave Scott's ass a squeeze and his shoulder a nip before he moved back to the bedroom, stretching and settling on the edge of the bed. "So now what? When're you going to try out your new eyes?"
Tony picked up a shirt, started to pull it on, then reconsidered when he tried to raise his arms above his head. "Y'know, this didn't hurt as much a few minutes ago. Maybe I should take some aspirin. Or gin."
Tony didn't give anyone a chance to argue further, especially when Nat had the decency to smirk at Steve's near-sneaky tactics. He grabbed the blonde by the hand and tugged him out of the room. "I think thirty minutes was a little bit conservative, but I have to give you points for craftiness," Tony admitted, smirking proudly.
"Pretty sure Stark's a semi-functioning alcoholic," Logan said, handing Scott a beer from the fridge before getting his own and settling on the edge of the pool table. “He's functioning just well enough to know better than to get into my stuff." He paused to take a swig before he thought about Scott's other questions. "I dunno. They're kind of nothin' you'd expect. Cap and Ton-- Stark have a... wild side," he said, thinking back to when they'd met. "Hawkeye's got anger issues, Hulk's some kind of zen master, and I haven't met Thor. I hear he's dumb."
He sat back a bit, still apparently unconcerned to be lounging undressed in front of the mortal. They were well beyond modesty so far as he was concerned. "I never fought for power because I thought that in the end we would share it, that we would rule together. For years he came to me night after night, and I thought... I foolishly thought that one day it would stop being a secret that he hid and become something more. Once I stopped lying to myself, began asking for what I wanted, the visits stopped too. I couldn't lie to myself anymore, and I realized that the only one who would ever defend me against his ridiculous friends or fight for a place for me was me. My brother had no intention of doing more than using me when it was convenient, and so I decided to return the favor."
Thor looked a little disappointed, but mostly he pitied Steve. Clearly, the man was hurting. The god glanced at Sif, then wordlessly gathered his hammer and took his leave, intent on contacting his mother to see if he could gain any helpful information. The Hawk's life - or at least his sanity - depended on it.
Steve managed a faint smile at that, at Tony asking about someone else just to keep the attention away when usually he was so happy to have it fully focused on himself. “Awful,” Steve admitted as he came to rest in the chair closest to Tony’s bed. He could sense the man withdrawing, but he wasn’t going to let Tony fold in on himself if he could help it. “I’ve been just... waiting, really. You in here and...” He stopped, realizing that talking about Bucky’s situation wasn’t going to make Tony feel any better. “I’m just glad you’re awake.”
Clint didn't even bother to knock. He'd barely talked himself out of charging in, bow drawn, and demanding Scott prove he wasn't compromised. His eyes swept the room and fixed on Scott. "I'm guessing you know Logan just turned himself in. As well as he was able to, anyway," he said, watching the other man for any signs of aggression.
"Oh, you love it," Tony said, reaching for the bag of pastries. "You're never happier than when you're commanding a meeting." He passed a napkin to Steve, and then allowed him a chance to make a selection. "I'm thinking of letting my pal here," Tony indicated the other man with a nod, "move in for a while." Knowing full well the news would take Steve by surprise, Tony munched happily on a chocolate croissant. "I don't think Cap's too comfortable with S.H.E.I.L.D.'s accommodations," he told Pepper. "Plus, I made him a promise to help him get a little more settled into our bright and progressive twenty-first century."
"Mmm," Phil agreed, his back braced against the tree and his arm carefully closed around Clint. He hadn't been sure at first if that would be alright, but the feeling of Clint's body molding itself to his was enough to tell Phil that it certainly was. The day was quickly becoming one of Phil's favorites. It didn't matter what they did or that the band was more mediocre than talented. The only thing that struck a chord was the man by his side. Given that they were one of the more mundane-looking couples in the place, they drew relatively little attention. The lack of scrutiny made Phil feel pleasantly lost in the crowd, luxuriating in being with Clint instead of worrying for once. "This? This is perfect."
"It's the best we've got," he agreed, tone suggesting that he hated the plan every bit as much as Natasha did. Steve swallowed hard. He was about to ask another team member to risk losing his mind if not his life on the same fool's errand that had taken Tony away from him. "What do you think, Clint? It's your call. We can ask you to do it, but not one of us would make you. It's a lot to risk over a maybe."
Steve’s already got his feet in the stirrups and started toward town. “Star looks good on you,” he calls over his shoulder.
“C’mon Tony, even regular pilots can’t be colorblind. I can’t see normally, I can’t hear normally, I can’t breathe normally, you don’t have to pretend I can actually help anyone just to make me feel better.”
“Like it was yesterday,” Tony says, and he thinks he’s going to remember Steve’s shy smile and pink ears but instead there’s gold at the edges of his vision, like he’s looking through a gleaming mask, and there are ice crystals on Steve’s eyelashes, and Tony thinks,
Tony inhales sharply but then his muscles go lax and he nestles into the crook of Steve’s shoulder, silent, and Steve’s asleep seconds later.
He can’t untangle the knot of fondness, exasperation, and familiarity he feels seeing Steve here, in his workspace, forcing food on him when Tony’s told him how excited he was to work on this vintage European model, and how the parts for it had just come in that morning.
He accepts the bottle and takes a long pull of it. It tastes faintly of white tea and ginger. Carol watches him, then nods, her mouth twisting. “Okay,” she says. “We don’t have to talk.”
They don’t stop running even once they’re inside Tony’s forge. “Arm yourself, Stark! That's an order.”
“I’ll just be a moment getting everything set up. I’ll come fetch you when it’s ready,” Ensign Sindrison says. “Make yourselves comfortable.” He indicates the couch, armchairs, and screens around the room. Then he’s gone.
Tony knows Steve’s brave, but he hadn’t been expecting this. If Steve can promise to rethink his ideals, to admit he might be wrong, to commit himself this way, it’s the least Tony can do to promise the same. He can’t think of a time Steve’s backed down like this before. He still doesn’t know how this could possibly be happening, but he doesn’t need to for now.
“Don’t let us keep you—” Tony starts to say, just as Steve says, “Anything out of the ordinary happening in town?”
They hang his shackles from a hook on the ceiling, high enough that he can’t rest on the flats of his feet. For all that Tony can’t bear the thought of letting his weight sink onto his protesting feet, of setting his soles against the rough concrete floor, he knows that whatever they have planned for him next won’t leave him grateful.
There’s nowhere else Jan would take Tony if he wasn’t feeling well, and if they came from the Blasting Range, there’s no way Steve could’ve beaten them to the tower. “I know he’s here,” Steve says, hating how whiny his voice sounds. “I’m worried about him.”
Steve’s at the Asgardian Forge, working on his shield, when Loki’s there, lounging against a golden anvil. Steve tries to ignore her.
She gets to her feet after the train lurches away from UN Plaza, removing her phone from her handbag and then zipping it up again. She unlocks it, taps the screen a few times, then unzips the purse, replaces the phone, and zips it up again. As Steve watches, the mauve circles under her eyes fade away into smooth, tawny skin. A scar on her forehead— Steve didn’t even realize he’d noticed it—disappears. Her breasts and ass swell, filling out her clothes. There’s definition to her arms, now, and she looks not so much scrawny as slender and elegant.
“But I’ll already be there,” Steve points out. “In this hypothetical scenario, I mean. So is there at least something I could do before Jan or Rhodey got there? If we’re at my dorm or practicing or something, should I bring you here?”
He can’t indulge in anger right now, Tony tells himself. He can do this. Steve is listening, he said he’d listen. So what if Tony sounds desperate; they can’t keep going on like they have. Something needs to change, whether Tony survives the rest of the day or not.
The rest of the invasion stutters by in flashes and skitters to a stop. An uncanny post-battle quiet settles over Manhattan. The Skrull threat is over.
He remembers Tony undressing him, spreading him out in one of his many bedrooms, pulling the cheeks of Steve’s ass apart. The way he worked Steve open with toys, sloppy with lube, refusing Steve the feel of his skin until he shoved his cock inside, hard and huge and bare. He remembers the names Tony called him, the relentless way Tony took him, hour after hour, Extremis getting him hard again moments after coming, telling Steve about the way his needy hole sucked him in, how tight and desperate and then how loose and sloppy his ass was, how only Tony could fill him up right. He never touched Steve's cock, but didn't stop him from humping the mattress until he came, and kept fucking him into the wet spot like it hadn't even happened.
