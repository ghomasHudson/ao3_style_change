“When we’re done with this we can go see Bucky and bring this out to them. Sound good?”
“Let’s go, huh?” Tony put his arm around Steve, walking them to the elevator.
“Oh, baby, come here.” Tony pulled him out of his blanket cocoon and onto his lap, hugging him close. Indy grabbed onto Tony’s shirt in two fists as he cried harder. Tony ran his hand through Indy’s hair as he felt his shirt getting damp from the boys tears. “I love you so much, sweetheart. Calm down, it’s okay. I need you to listen because this is really, really important.” He pushed Indy back a little so he could see his face. Indy gasped in a stuttering breath as he tried to stop crying. Tony wiped the boys tears with his thumbs. “ I know I’ve spent all my time with the baby since we got back but that’s only because she’s so little she needs a lot of care right now. But you, Indy, you’re my son. Nothing will ever change that. I love you more than anything in the whole world.” Tony kissed his forehead.
“I shouldn’t have to tell him that!” Tony snapped. “I fucked this up. I’m sorry. Steve, I’m sorry.”
“Wow. Thank you Indy, that’s very nice of you,” Bucky said, stepping forward so he was within reach and kissing the blonde hair on the little boys head. “I’m sure she’ll love I when she wakes up.”
“New baby,” he answered with a slight nod. “Come here?”
Full disclosure: The baby’s name is from Animal Crossing. ;)
“Cap?” Peter called through the comms.
“Sir. Do you need assistance?”
“We’ll read it later definitely but you have more things to open,” he gestured to the pile.
“I agree,” Steve added quickly. “And I am sorry, Tony. About everything. About today. About your parents. You have every right to be upset.” Tony stepped back then sat next to Steve on the end of the bed. “Indy wanted to say goodnight to you tonight.”
“I know. I mean, if you had been a few inches closer or he moved his arm differently when he swung he could have hit you in the chest. What If he hit the reactor? Or even next to it. Jesus, Tony this could have been so much worse.”
“Hey, Tony,” Pepper greeted with a kiss to his cheek.
Considering the outside of the building looked abandoned, the inside was about as high tech as it could get. They spread out so they could cover as much space as possible, subduing Hydra agents as they went, securing them and leaving them for the agents Shield sent along as backup to collect.
“Careful,” he told Tony as he turned to get 2 mugs from the cupboard. Tony set to work meticulously cutting the peppers, needing to do well to please Steve. Steve poured the tea once it had steeped and set one in front of Tony, who had just finished with the peppers. He looked up, pushing the board forward a bit for approval.
“No,” Indy whined.
“Save it, Cap. We’re almost done here,” Tony said shortly.
“Okay, I hope she stays sleepy, wish me luck,” Bucky said.
“Here.” Bucky held the doll out to Indy, who took it gratefully.
“Buppy,” Indy shouted, recognizing that name of course.
They broke apart and looked over to see Luca laughing as Steve made the bear give him kisses all over his face. Steve looked up when he felt their gaze on him. He smiled at Tony.
“Thanks,” he whispered. Clint said good bye to both men and with that they left. Happy stood up next.
“Love Da,” Indy said seriously.
“It’s okay. Santa came, come here.” Steve picked him up and brought him closer to the tree as Tony followed. “You were such a good boy this year that Santa thought you deserved some nice things. And there’s something from Papa and Daddy. And I think Bucky and Poppy got you a gift too.”
“Hey, sweetheart. You’re okay. Did you have a good nap?” Tony wiggled his arms out of the blanket and out to Steve who picked him up right away. Tony curled up against him in a little ball so Steve arranged him so he was holding him sideways, more like a baby. “You are just a little peanut aren’t you?” Tony put his thumb in his mouth and looked up at Steve who kissed him on his forehead.
Steve took it and held it to Tony’s lips. “Take a small sip and I’ll tip it okay?” Steve slowly lifted the cup and Tony sipped the juice, licking his lips when Steve pulled the cup back.
“You asked me yesterday if I wanted to live here,” Bucky stated.
“No, Da. No leave.” Indy pulled his hood back to show his dad, sounding just on the edge of nervous, like he wasn’t 100% sure it was a joke anymore. Tony caught on to that because he dropped the charade immediately.
Steve smiled. “He’s good. He got some fluids through an IV and he’s all cleaned up. You wanna hold him?” Tony nodded and held his arms out. Steve placed their son in Tony’s arms, careful not to jostle the IV that was still in Tony’s forearm. Luca yawned but didn’t even bother opening his eyes, just snuggled into the new chest he was placed on. “How do you feel?”
“Um. No,” Bucky answered nervously.
“Okay, shh, let’s not get upset again,” Steve comforted. He looked over to Tony who had sat on the edge of the bed watching him. “Tony, do you think you’d mind if he slept with us tonight?” Steve asked hesitantly.
Bucky ended the call and headed back to Tony’s room. “Happy’s on his way,” he told Steve who was holding Tony’s hand as it rested on Indy who was still curled against the man in the hospital bed.
“No, not Cap,” Steve insisted, not wanting to be called a title just because Tony was trying to push him away. “Come on, get over here. Please.” Tony sighed heavily but stepped up in front of the sofa. “What did he say to you before I came downstairs?”
“Looks worse than it is,” Bucky said quickly. “You’ll be fine.” Tony didn’t seem convinced. Bucky sat up all the way this time and removed Tony’s hand from his shirt. “Hold on a sec, I’m not leaving.” He reached over to the discarded clothes grabbing one of adult Tony’s socks and then turned back to the boy. “I’m going to tie this around your cut okay? To keep the dirt out.” Tony nodded. Bucky tied the sock around the kids leg, he was able to knot it without any issue because the boy was so small. The bleeding had mostly stopped so he didn’t need a tourniquet, just a loose pressure to keep it from opening again.  “There.”
“Yeah. I mean, no. But it’s expected.”  Steve unbuckled Indy’s seatbelt and lifted the straps over his head. “We’ll handle it.” Tony got out and opened Indy’s door.
“Puzzle now?” Indy asked. “Buppy. Puzzle,” Indy pointed to Annie’s bag.
“Sir,” JARVIS called out. “Captain Rogers is awake and seems to be distressed.”
“Love you too. Good night.”
“Where are you?” Tony asked, already trying to come up with an excuse to tell Indy why his parents would both be away for awhile.
Tony squeezed Steve’s shoulder reassuringly “What do you need me to do?”
“You were such a good boy while we were shopping,” Tony said, hoping to distract him as he brought the straps over Indy’s head.
“Tony, if you feel anything weird, anything bothers you at all I need you to tell me, okay? We’ll go see Bruce after but I need to know that you’re okay now. Promise me,” Steve pleaded.
“What do you need?”
“No, Bubba. Just your friends,” he answered with a smile. “And JARVIS. You can talk to him.”
“Hand her over,” Natasha said, putting her hands out for the baby girl. “We’ve got them, you go.”
“Why don’t I hold her while Bruce looks at her ear? That way she doesn’t associate the discomfort with you,” he explained, purposely not using the word pain. “You can sit in front of her and try to keep her distracted. It’ll just be a minute, right Bruce?” Bruce nodded. Bucky looked vey unsure but Tony decided to go ahead and try to take her into his arms. Bucky let it happen. He got Poppy situated in his arms then used his free hand to grab Bucky’s. “Come on.” He pulled him to the sofa and arranged Poppy so the affected ear was facing Bruce where he knelt in front of the sofa. Bucky sat at Tony’s side so his daughter was facing him. He reached out and held her ankle, rubbing his thumb along the side of her knee soothingly as she stared at him. Tony nodded to Bruce so they could get this over with.
They couldn’t have asked for better weather. A spring day, bright and sunny, but not too warm. Bucky was on Indy duty, and the boy was currently excitedly bouncing around Bucky who was trying to get Poppy dressed. He had just managed to get her white leggings on over her diaper when Indy jumped up on to the bed next to her to tickle her. Poppy giggled and waved her arms around.
“Hi Peanut. I’m glad you’re here,” Tony smiled at him. Indy turned to Bucky and reached out for the blue bear.
“Tony. Sweetheart. How do you feel?”
Steve looked at the teen next to him and put his arm out. Peter scooted closer and leaned into his side and Steve put his arm down around the boy and gripped his bicep with his hand where it rested. “Thanks, Pete. I’m okay, but it means a lot that you’re trying to help. I’m glad you’re here.”
“Tony,” Bucky said softly. “He thinks you and Indy were killed. Obviously I told him you weren’t and that he’d see you soon but, like I said, he’s a mess.”
“I’ll leave you guys alone.”
“What is it, Buck?” Steve asked.
"Hell yeah," Bucky replied breathlessly. Tony looked back and forth between them shaking his head.
“Pa,” he said hesitantly, still pointing. Steve picked up the small light beige colored teddy bear.
“I think Bucky found some juice. You thirsty?” Steve asked.
“Sorry to interrupt, sirs, but Miss Potts is at the door,” JARVIS announced.
“If that so much as even crossed his mind then I have done something very wrong,” Tony breathed deeply, feeling the beginning of anxiety attack coming and trying to stave it off. “Take her,” he said suddenly, turning closer to Steve to transfer the baby.
Bucky chuckled and grabbed the khaki shorts, pulling them on and tucking the shirt in then buttoning them up. “You’re gonna be a great ring-bearer. Your Da and Papa know you can handle the responsibility.”
"Use whatever you want," he replied tersely, head down and focused on the arm.
“You’re going to have to unhook your feet from behind my back so I can sit us down, Bubba.” Tony dropped his legs down by Steve’s sides without a word and Steve sat down slowly.
“Sap,” Tony mumbled but he was blinking quickly trying to avoid more tears.
The next morning came and Steve could practically feel the anxiety pouring off of Tony. To the point where he started to second guess his plan. Tony was in the nursery changing Luca out of his pajamas looking about as stressed as he’d ever seen him. He walked up behind him and circled his arms around the smaller mans waist, resting his chin on Tony’s shoulder. Tony didn’t really acknowledge him he just continued trying to maneuver Luca’s arms and legs into his clean onesie.
“Hey, hey. Tony. It’s only been a little over a day and yeah you’ve spent all your time with her but someone had to and she likes you best. He’s just a toddler that doesn’t understand. You’ll explain everything and he’ll be fine, okay?”
Steve came over with Indy’s small blue bowl filled with oatmeal and the matching blue plastic spoon. “You excited about seeing everyone, baby?”
“Those are adorable, Pepper,” Steve said from his spot on the sofa. Indy was kicking is feet up and down staring at them in wonder. “They seem to be a hit,” Steve laughed. Pepper laughed too.
Tony rolled his eyes. “I like the name,” he mumbled, it didn’t elaborate. Steve sighed, running his hand through his hair.
“I’ll uh, just,” he pointed back the way he came and started to turn away. Steve stepped forward instantly.
Indy shrugged, spitting out the pacifier. “Pa and Da and Buppy,” he said, pointing at the them as he said it.
Indy smiled. “Love Da,” he said softly. “And ah-ma!” he added louder, giggling. Tony laughed with him, feeling now that they really would be okay.
Aside from the bassinet, Tony had also ordered a bunch of the basics - diapers, bottles, formula, onesies, etc. “I’m going to give Indy his snack and put this together while I watch the movie with him. I’ll bring it out when I’m done.”
“I make her list, Buppy,” he said softly.
“What?” He replied, feigning innocence.
“Yeah, sweetheart. Me and Dad are gonna get married,” Steve smiled softly.
Peter takes Tony’s hand as he leads him to the shared bedroom of the two men. He’s so tired but he’s also super wide awake. Steve sits up when Tony brings in Peter “Tony did you get him?” he asks.
They start to move on to a different spider when Peter feels something pinch the back of his neck, his hand goes back to swat whatever it was away and rub the spot the hurts.  Peter notices that he’s falling behind so he rushes to catch up with the group leaving a grumpy radioactive spider to crawl on the floor. Peter watches all of the different spiders crawl around in their cases before they move on to some other stupid thing.
“We did discipline, he has been punished accordingly and knows what he did was wrong. He shouldn't have hurt those boys  even if it was within good reason” Nat starts.
“Ms. Skye, anyways nice to meet you too! Your son is a genius!” She gasps out as she moves towards her desk “he has solved all of the math homework sheets that I have and that even exceed three more grade levels!”
“Wait he was being bullied?!” Tony looks at Steve confused.
“Tony!” Bruce whisper shouts.
“Are you enrolled in any schools near by Peter?” Steve looks back at the six year old, he would be in about first grade now right?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“What kind of drinks do they want” Gramps looks back down to his glass that he’s cleaning.
“Will do” he says before hanging up “Steve check his wallet” Tony looks at Peter and wipes off the drying tears “and you little man stop crying” he chuckles at the boy.
“I’m sure that’s not what he meant” Wade tries to defend.
“I have eaten, yesterday that is.” Tony says as he continues to tinker.
“Oouff” Steve huffs before laughing “people shoved my head into a toilet and flushed” he explains.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Sure thing Dad!” Wade Laughs changing the game from single to multiplayer.
“We don't want to hear any excuses mister you're grounded for a month” Steve cuts him off.
A redhead walks into the bar with a kid around his age, he can’t really see who the kid is due to the dim lighting and the crowd.  The redhead and the kid make their way over to the man with the metal arm, the blonde boy starts to look really familiar to jack  so he has to go check out the kid.
Peter hugs Steve then turns to hug Tony “you guys be safe at work today” he says before going to out his seat.
“Oh? Um I’m Steve it’s nice to meet you ms…” Steve stares at the frantic woman holding his hands.
“Of course you can bud” Tony say moving him out of his lap before getting up “come on Stebe’s waiting” he laughs softly helping Peter up.
Jack Made his way back over to the bar “who’s the kid?” Gramps asks glaring at him.
“Will you leave me alone?” He huffs getting up from the couch and moves to the other end.
“I can’t get into the system sir” the third guy comments.
With the Asgardian family gone, and Thor having left a bottle of mead on the table, Tony saw an opportunity and popped the cork.
“I’m sorry for saying you're a bad parent Bruce, you're a good father to this boy and Wade I’m sorry for accusing you of being a bad influence on Peter you’re a good kid I see that now.. Will you please forgive me for being so incompetent?” Tony asks hopefully.
Peter nods as he pulls the men towards the doors of the mall “that doesn't matter now, come on let’s go!”
“Two root beers the soda no alcohol” Jack says.
“Well then kick his ass” Nat jokingly throws the suggestion his way.
“what's it to you?” he glares
“Tony you are out of line” Bruce stands up now.
“Got everything?” Wade asks Peter.
Steve couldn't blame the kid, from the looks of it the kid seemed to have a lot of injuries all over him. The feeling of anger fills Steve’s gut, this kid must have gone through hell. Tony doesn't seem to take notice of the boy's wounds and helps him take the food to the table. Steve sighs how could they do this? Were they ready to be married and have a son?
As Peter runs to the lab he hears Bruce talking to Tony. Peter stops at the door to eavesdrop before he decides to interrupt them.
Peter looks up in confusion at Steve. What could he mean by this? What does that say about him? What does it tell Steve? “What?” Peter asks not understanding where Steve is going with this.
Tony sat there for a minute, he watches Steve with Peter in the most recent stores they have gone too. They’re looking at pajamas onesies to be exact, ones with the avengers all over them and some with puppies and others with spiders. The thought of what those horrible people did to such a wonderful kid pops into his head as he watches his new family. “Don’t worry Peter no one will ever hurt you again” he sighs to himself.
“And you did a good job Peter” Natasha says patting his head.
The next morning Peter goes down to Wade’s floor waiting for him and his mom to come take them to the school for the field trip. He sits at the counter as Wade sneaks up behind him. Wade grabs Peter's’ sides “Blah” he shouts causing the younger one to jump and fall onto the older one.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Peter knows that these people are good, he knows one hundred percent that they will take care of him. He still can’t shake the feeling that something is wrong, he feels off and not in a good way, if there is a good way of feeling off that is. Peter adapted a habit of dropping everything he’s doing when the sun starts going down to run to his room.
Peter get dragged away from his friend by Steve and Tony as Wade is lead out by Natasha and Bruce.
“Wait you're not going to kick me out?” Jack looks surprised
Jack makes his way back over to the three and sits with Wade after handing them their drinks
“What the hell did you do that you need lawyers?” she questions the man's antics.
The door burst open to reveal a redheaded women “Peter are you in here?”  her voice is like candy to wade’s ears.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Oh my god Steve I think he broke my back!” Tony babbles dramatically
“Clint’s at a dog show with Lucky in France, Natasha and Bruce are traveling in Europe, and the Asgardians are gone. The Tower is ours, Steve. Let’s celebrate~”
The tears in Peter’s eyes hurt more than all of the ones that came before them. He doesn't know what to do, he doesn't know what to think. His body moves on it’s own ashe runs back to the elevator.
“Please can I stay here tonight…” Peter begs.
“Peter how many other foster families have hurt you?” Steve sits down across from the boy digging into the food. The food is so good that Steve can't help but melt over it.
“Oh Peter… you're not going anywhere sweetheart” Steve says kindly.
After that Peter comes back down with his stuff “I’m ready when you guys are” he says weakly.
Guilt wrenches in Wade’s gut “okay I’ll go with you.. So you can stop with the water works” he laughs nervously.
Peter walks into the kitchen dressed and ready to go “what’s with the water works?” he looks at his two dads.
“It’s Wade” he breaths “he was experimented on by Hydra…”
Jack gets up and helps Wade up “I’m going to get your drinks so I’ll be right back” he says smiling at the three.
Peter plates the eggs and starts making some toast “it also looks like we started fostering a kid” Steve says watching the boy.
“Eww” Peter groans snuggling close to Steve.
“I’m going to stop the bleeding” Peter says with a smile “I use to get beat like that all the time by my foster families”
His breathing starts to labor, his stamina is wavering. Jack felt his energy draining as he continues to run away from the Hydra base. Wade is gone so that means that he got out thank god. Their life was hell in that facility, Wade is Jack’s best friend and only friend since they were the only to kids there.
“Peter is there anything you need help with?” The lady at the desk asks.
Wade looks at Peter then back at the adults. He grabs Peter’s hand and pulls him to his feet, they run to the elevator to go back to Peter’s floor. Wade mainly only wants to get Peter out of that situation he’s had enough bad vibes today. “Look bud you should get some rest you've had a long day” Wade says grasping Peter’s elbow.
“What are you doing here?” Wade asks
Tony sits on the couch next to Peter “So Peter right? Anyways how old are you petey?”
tears
Steve’s threat has Tony trying to pull away “How Could You~!” Tony cries dramatically as he fails to escape his significant other’s grasp.
“What we gonna do Bobby~?” a female voice chimes.
“Steve punched a guy who used to be the foster father of my son. Oh yeah on another note you’re an aunt now” Tony chimes into the phone.
“We’re here for you whenever you need us, Okay?” Steve pets Peters hair down.
Tony Stares at Peter the feeling of his heart breaking. This little boy with red puffy eyes has been hurt so terrible by one of the only people in this word he could trust. Tony felt that pain before, he was in the same spot Peter is in right now.
“I’m Peter who are you?” the boy says helping Wade sit down.
Bruce pulls her close “you did what you thought was right and I support you Nat.” He gives her a quick kiss “now I need to go run his DNA” Bruce leaves her to go fiddle with Wade’s DNA. Natasha laughs going her own way to write a report about what happened.
“No I am sorry because I hurt you and that is not okay. Tony you are my dad, I have never had anyone care about me as much as you and Steve do. What I said to you was wrong and untrue.” Peter speaks strongly even though tears are welling up in his eyes again.
Peter got up out of bed and went to the bathroom and climbed onto the counter from the toilet, he got into the medicine cabinet and get some painkillers for the two men.  He went back and gave them to Steve first then Tony. The two men quickly took the pills and drank some water not really knowing who the kid is.
“ um that's my new son.. I just adopted him just now” she says flying away.
Welp I'm going to be hated... Let The Feels Roll On!!! Let The Hate Roll In!!! I Shall Have No Regrets!!!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Why should we? It’s not like he'll care… no one really ever does” Peter says looking to the floor.
Steve want to go after him but decides to give him some pace and to keep Tony at bay. Steve takes Tony’s hand and pulls him to the couch “Tony we need to talk to him… all we got was one side of the story I mean maybe it wasn't Peter that started the fight?” he says  relaxing with his partner.
“Sandra stay here I'll get him” the first male walks over and picks Jack up “he’ll be alright right Pops?”
“Why is there a kid?” a voice asks behind him.
Wade can feel everything as it burned with pain. The boy ran over to Wade to make sure that he is okay, of course he’s not though. “Are you okay?” his voice is soft “do you need help?” so soft. Wade can’t help but lean into this boy who is he? What is he doing here? The voices comment.
The elevator opens again and Tony’s voice is heard before he is seen “Peter Where Are You?!” he yells.
“Left alone again I see?” Nat mentions as she snakes her way through the common area.
Steve and Tony wake up with the worst hangover ever and... a smaller thing in between them.
“Woah there super solider no need to bite my head off” she jokes.
Tony turns back into the elevator to go back up to his floor where he needs to make amends with his son now. Hopefully it’ll be just as easy as the last three have been.
Nat walks into the living room the next morning to see the two boys cuddled close on the couch. She could've sworn that Peter had gone back upstairs last night…. “Wade, Peter it’s time to get up for school” she says shaking the boys.
“Doesn't matter you got into a fight and got three kids suspended” she informs him.
“What do you need Bruce?” she appears around the corner.
“Tony…. It was the 30’s and 40’s we only had desks we had to carry everything” Steve sighs holding his arms open for Peter. “But I did get swirlies.”
The three sit in silence for the rest of the class. The teacher talks to the students about the upcoming field trip. The field trip is a day from now so all Peter could think about is how he’s so happy that today was his last day of detention. The detention teacher makes him do math work but to him that’s not really a punishment. He loves math, math gives a simple right or wrong.
“No actually  I sat down with my mom and dad and told them all that happened at school” Wade says smiling.
“Already? Well okay” she smiles, getting up.
Steve walks out all dressed and with wet hair “He’s not wrong Peter, you’re our son now and we will love you as such, so let’s get to know each other how bout it little guy” Steve holds out his hand to Peter smiling. Peter looks at his hand before taking it.
“Um.. I wanted… to say that I’m sorry for what I said to you..” Peter says looking away from Tony.
The stress of all of this taking it’s toll on the both of them, they finish the food and go to their shared room. Peter was just finishing up tying shoes “well I’ll be waiting in the living room” he says darting out the door that they had just come through. Steve lets out a sigh going over to his side of the drawer grabbing a change of clothes before heading to take a quick shower. Tony gets his clothes and changes into them in the room. He heads to the living room to sit with Peter.
~~~~~~~~~
“Uh no I’m still in trouble” he says declining the offer.
Natasha walks Wade into the common room with Peter “um Bruce sweetheart… I uh have some news for you” she half-heartedly laughs holding onto Wade’s shoulder.
Steve couldn't be happier, the two most important people in his life are happy again and are bonding. Bonding, without him… They have gotten so used to doing things without Steve they totally forgot about him. Why have they forgotten him? He asks himself this all week.  It’s not like he’s forgettable! He’s not little like he used to be, he’s big now and he can basically do anything he puts his mind to. So why must his son and husband forget about his existence?
Shopping? Oh yes of course because they need to make up the other room for a kid. Tony sighs “I’m so happy we did all this stuff but you were right we should have waited” he holds his head in hands.
~~~~~~~~~
“Steve it’s going to be fine he’ll do great, he’s a good kids” Tony smiles reassuringly.
“You Know What If We Didn’t, We Wouldn't Be Married And We Wouldn’t Have A Son!!” Tony’s voice is louder than Steves’.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What? I did-” Peter starts to explain
The loud noises stop and all he hears is whispering, he opens the door to the lab to see a couple of men in strange clothing. “Who are you guys?” he questions “are you supposed to be here?”
The group of kids crowd around the case looking to see the spider, one of the students looks over at the lady “I don’t see it where is it?” he asks her  moving aside for her to look.
“This is Wade Wilson… our son” she smiles petting the boy's hair “I adopted him and he needs some first aid”
Tony couldn't bear the look on this kid’s face and the words coming from him “Awe Peter” Tony springs forward and wraps Peter in a big hug “ I love you too kid” Tony says holding him close.
Bruce looks between his wife and his ‘son’ “well Wade I’m Bruce it’s nice to meet you” he says holding out his hand. Wade looks at his hand before taking it.
Wade could feels his heart break as he grabs the redheads hand “let's go mom” he says spite. Natasha picks up the two boys and goes heads towards her jet.
Peter stares at one of his adopted fathers, he was offering for him to sleep in their bed with them. And he knows about the no sleep thing… He lets out a soft sigh “I don’t feel good dad..” he stares down at his feet.
Steve chuckles at the cute gesture that has Tony both fuming and blushing “have you been left somewhere before?” he asks holding tightly onto the boy’s hand.
“oh good are you this boy's father?” she grins
“Not me at least I'm not important” he says stuffing his face full of bacon and eggs
“I wanted to-” Peter cuts him off like Tony has him.
“Well then maybe you need to get the whole story like Bruce and I did, You're being a bad Parent Tony” Nat hisses.
Peter was playing in the livingroom of his fathers’ floor, there was suddenly a black out and some loud noises coming from his dad’s lab. Peter gets up to go investigate, “Dad?” Peter calls into the room.
What?
Alright one down three to go. Tony enters the elevator again and makes his way his lab where he assumes Bruce will be. He waits quietly for the elevator to ding for him to get off.
Steve looks down at Peter shock washing over his face “like to do math?!”
“Give me one more lap Tony” Steve laughs as he rushes to get to his fourth lap around.
“Oh? So the other two boys were suspended too?” Peter cocks his head in question.
Wade laughs smiling back at him “good that’s what I was going for”
“what?” Peter’s immediate shock hurts even more.
Peter gets in a bit of trouble, Wade gets in even bigger trouble, Natasha and Bruce become parents
The two boys move to get up, Peter heads for the elevator to go get changed and grab his stuff, Wade heads for his room to go get ready. Wade changes his clothes  before grabbing his bag and heading back out to the living room.
“Yes Tony I’ll forgive you if Natasha has at least” Bruce says swatting Wade’s hand away from the toaster.
“Because it’s a bad place” Jack informs
“Why’s that?” Gramps sits with his own plate of food
Tony goes to the Kitchen where Steve is pacing back and forth “Oh Tony what if he gets in trouble? Or if he gets picked on? I’m so worried” Steve grips the shorter mans shoulders.
“I was kidnapped by your dad” Peter says and moves back over to Wade with tissues.
Tony is dragged from his daydreams when Thor smacks him on the back “Worry not Brother Tony! I’ll make sure to leave you some Asgardian Mead! For your holiday gift!” Thor laughs.
“Because they don't care” Peter says a little harshly.
“Don’t mind me I’m just going to sit here with Wade” he says to the adults.
“Yeah that sounds nice” Peter says finishing his food “ you guys need to go shopping for me anyways we can do that today too” he says hopping down from the chair.
Wade sits on the couch bored out of his mind when Peter comes barreling in from the elevator. He sits up with joy that his friend has returned only to sees his red puffy eyes and all the water works. “Peter what’s wrong?” he asks softly as Peter basically jumps into his arms.
“I’m sorry buddy, how do you want me to fix it?” Tony kneels down to his son’s level.
That’s great.
Steve and Tony talk to the teacher to see when class gets out, Steve watches Peter find a cubby for his stuff. A little girl with bright red hair walks over to Peter and introduces herself to him, Steve is ecstatic that he’s already got a new friend and points it out to Tony “look Tony he’s a ladies man” Steve chuckles teasing Tony.
Steve is torn on what to do, his new family is falling apart and he has to figure out how to put the pieces back together. What can he do Tony won’t talk to him and Peter only comes out of his room for food. How can he possibly do anything good for them if they won’t do anything for themselves.  He knew what Peter said to Tony, of course he was mad when the words reached his own ears. He had rushed in when he heard Peter yelling at Tony, he was powerless to stop the words from affecting Tony so deeply. While on the other had Tony needed to hear those words, Tony needed to understand that there needs to be a balance of yes and no when parenting.
Steve and Tony sorted everything out before going over to Peter to say good bye “Hey bud we’re leaving” Tony says patting peter’s head.
“I have a husband and I’m not sending Peter anywhere” Steve’s hands clench before he cracks his knuckles “Are you one of those jack asses that used to beat my kid?” Steve glares daggers at the man.
“Good” Bruce says grabbing the other controler “wanna play with your old man” he laughs happily.
“We’ll go tomorrow it’s the weekend by then and it’s also our field trip we’ll run away then! ” Wade says thinking of the escape plan.
“You're our son Peter we're not giving you back, we've gone through to much together to want to get rid of you, I mean I punched a guy for you” Steve laughs taking the suitcase from the boy.
Peter goes to the common area of the tower to meet up with Wade. When he gets there the place seems to be empty. Wade is on the couch playing a videogame with the volume way down. Peter sits next to him on the couch and watches him.
“Yeah he’s nervous” Tony says picking up the small boy.
Peter was so overwhelmed with joy of being called son by the two men who adopted him that he couldn't stop crying, but he’ll let them think it’s because of what happened.
Tony tenses for a moment “do you remember all of their names?” his voice is angry but his eyes are of a killer. Steve understands his feelings but hunting people down and hurting them isn't going to help anything.
“Why should I repeat myself when you didn't even bother to listen the first time!” Peter shouts running to his room and slamming the door.
“Well stuff is really interesting what kind of stuff? Video games? Drawing? Science? Robots?” He’s pushing buttons.
Tony was ecstatic on the inside, they got married and adopted a kid! How much better could this get?! He sits with the boy as Steve just stands there watching them “Steve come sit down before the food gets cold” he waves his hand at Steve.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Are you sure I can sleep with you guys?” Peter asks sadly.
Wade body slams the boy knocking him to the ground about five feet away, he turns to the other boy and slams his fist into his face. Wade punches him until he is unconscious, the other boy gets up and attacks Wade. Peter jumps in the way only to be punched in the face by the other boy himself. Wade pulls Peter away and knocks the boy’s teeth in before teachers are rushing over.
Wittle Stebe Feels weft out
Jack collapses outside a building, it’s noisy here but he just feels so tired. The noise got louder as a door opened “Oh shit Pops ain't gonna like this” a male voice say.
Gramps starts pouring the drinks then passes them to Jack “go serve them then you can hang out with your friend” Gramps grumbles.
Steve and Tony make their way back to the Avengers Tower, Tony unhappy about the walk but Steve insists it’s good for their health. Tony looks at his partner and smiles to himself, this is all thanks to his Captain America boxers that he got caught wearing. Steve looks down at the shorter man and smiles back at him. They were both very grateful to those poor in taste boxers.
“Oh that poor boy” she gasps “I'm so glad I got him out of there”
“It’s nice to meet you too” Peter looks around the room for a minute “I’ll be right back don’t move” he says before leaving Wade’s site.
Peter sat in the cart watching Steve, this man had just called him his son and defended him. He couldn't help but let the tears start streaming down his cheeks. “We- we better go check out before the cops get called” he stutters.
“What are those for?” Wade looks confused.
“Yeah I’m fine my friend Wade got the worst of it, he was suspended” Peter tells her.
“Look I know this is a big adjustment for kid, it’s a big change! You were kinda thrown into this whole big mess of things, I know this is hard for you, you’re starting school soon and you only have one person around here that’s your age, this is all just a big mess and it’s going to be hard.” Tony pulls Peter into his arms and holds him.
They are each-other's’ family now.
“Peter..” Tony steps closer to the boy.
Steve glares at the man “excuse you but I’m spending time with my son who are you to give me your input on who I’m raising?” Steve sets Peter in the cart with all of his soon-to-be new things.
“I want the Avengers and spiders” Peter hums happily.
“Yeah it is, I’m so happy.” Peter grins back at her.
“How the hell did you get out?” Wade questions him more seriously
“Okay” Peter nods letting Wade go get sleeping bags for them to use.
“Dang it Wade!” Peter says light hitting the older one.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“I’m getting in on this action!” Nat laughs getting the third controler.
“What do you mean I have been-” Steve stops Tony before he can finish.
Happy.
The world may never know. Or at least he won’t.
They have spent three hours just spending all kinds of money on this kid. Tony can feel his credit and debit cards just getting drained. His soul is being sucked out of him by this kid. Tony can’t help but keep giving him what he wants, he’s just so happy! Then Steve comes at him with whatever he finds and gives Tony the puppy dog eyes, this isn’t fair.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Wade jolts awake “Peter!” he shouts falling on top of the younger boy.
The alarm goes off and the room now has a flashing red light. Peter screams out of the sudden shock. Wade holds on to him to help calm him down “hey it’s okay it’s just the hideout is under attack we’re going to be fine” he says.
It’s a long  hour filled with nice small talk and math problems. Ms. Skye loves how much Peter enjoyed math, she felt even more ecstatic when she heard that one of his fathers is picking him up. Steve had the afternoon free so he ended up with picking Peter up from school only for him to be ambushed by the teacher Peter was with.
“You love me?” Peter asks softly.
“Oh buddy you don’t-” Tony starts only to be stopped.
Peter laughs softly snuggling close to the two men “thanks guys” Peter sighs happily “this has made me feel a lot better.”
“It’s okay Peter, I’m the one who should be sorry.. Anyways it’s time for school  so you should go get ready” she motions for them to get ready.
“Wouldn't you like to know” Steve bites bitterly.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Jack did what he could around the small two bedroom apartment and whenever the bar was closed. James was good to him, taught him how to cook some basic things like hamburgers and bacon.
“Come on Pops put me down” Peter pushes on Steve to try to escape.
“I saw that” he laughs  rushing over to his husband “Steve what the hell happened?” Tony huffs at the taller man.
“No I'm okay… actually I'm done can I have another one?” Peter smiles at her.
“Natasha Your boy got into a fight because Peter started a fight with a couple of other kids there is no good reason for that” Tony lashes back.
“He has healing abilities” he rubs her shoulder “he said he can heal from fatal and non fatal injuries”
Thank you all for reading so far, I love getting all of your comments it's great. I'm glad you all like it and I will try to update as much as I can.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Peter feels bad, Tony feels bad, We all feel bad Woo!!
“You've been going out and doing things with Peter! The two of you left me out, I feel like an unappreciated housewife!” Steve finally raises his voice.
“Yes he does, now what do you need to do to help him feel better?” Steve asks trying to get Peter to go talk to Tony.
“So are you grounded like me” Peter asks softly.
The elevator opens just as Steve is getting on to go get Tony “Oh Steve! Perfect Peter in hurt and very bloody from being pushed to the ground today by those bullies” Wade says holding Peter’s arms up to show Steve.
“Boxers with my face plastered all over them” Tony seemingly jokes
“What do you want?” the harsh words greet him as he opens the door.
Peter nods and looks over at Wade “I was looking for him when they came up to me out of the blue” he says looking back at Steve “then one of them stomped on my glasses and the other was going to hurt me even more when Wade stepped in” he explains further.
Steve laughs holding Tony close to him “you’re going to be the death of me someday”he says placing his lips against Tony’s.
“I’ll get the lawyers get the guys information” Pepper sighs.
“He don’t seem to have anything visibly wrong with him Pops” the female adds “he might just be tired or sick”
Bruce sits aside and watches Tony as he works away in the lab. Tony has been like this for about three days, Steve has tried to talk to him but to no avail. Jarvis has even tried to get him to go to bed by turning off his systems.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Oh Bucky, Mom, this is Weasel he’s was my only friend when we were at Hydra together” Wade introduces him to the adults that he’s with.
“And what could that be?” Peter asks sectical.
~~~~~~~~~~~
“I don’t know why we ever drank that blasted asgardian mead!” Steve spits at Tony.
If Tony had known having kids was going to be this hard he wouldn’t have wanted it any other way. Peter is having a hard time so that means Tony and Steve would have to be patient with the kid. “Peter come here” Tony pats the spot next to him. Peter doesn’t budge, Tony sighs.
“It’s Tony come on kid open the door” Tony says respecting boundaries as best he could.
“You don’t know what you’re talking about”Peter retaliates
The two of them make it to the lobby of the tower, they walk over to the elevator. Tony pushes the button to go up. The doors open and they step inside, Steve pushes the button to their shared floor. Ever since they became a couple Steve moved onto Tony’s floor. OF course they didn't share a room until they both felt comfortable enough to take it to that level.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The backpack is ready. The lunch is packed.  Everything is ready to go except for Peter and Steve is at wits end from rushing. Tony is picking out some clothes for Peter as the boy is in the shower “Pete bud I laid some clothes out for you hurry up or you’re going to be late” Tony says through the door.
Wade laughs at him “Weasel you're funny they aren't talking about anything important” he explains “if they were I wouldn’t be here”
“Yup, all ready for our Poppy seed.” Tony dragged it to a stop in front of where Steve and Bucky were sitting. “Test it out.”
Steve and Tony returned to the living room, Steve sat first and beckoned for Tony to cuddle up next to him. “Wanna watch a Christmas movie?”
“Clint, what happened?”
“So I can give it to him?” Bucky asked.
“That’s good to hear. I’ll just take a look and see how the healings going and then i’ll get out of your hair.”
-Not sure I care what you have to say, he wrote, and pressed send.
“Don’t you take after Daddy in that way, please,” he told him exasperated. He rounded the counter and picked up his son, kissing him on his cheek. Indy instantly rested his head on his Papa’s shoulder. “Happy Valentine’s Day, sweet boy.” Indy hugged Steve harder in response. Steve stepped up to Tony who had been stealing sips of his coffee. “Happy Valentine’s to you too, sweetheart.” Tony looked up with a smile and Steve leaned in to kiss him. The kiss deepened until Steve felt an insistent patting on the side of his head. He pulled back with a chuckle and looked at Indy who looked put out at losing his Papa’s attention.
“Buppy!”
“Yeah, of course. I’m happy, Tony. I really am. I’m glad we can do this it just hit me for a minute but I’m fine.”
Steve smiled. “Before that. About the place where Bucky found you. I know it might be scary and sad talking about that but it will really help in the long run.”
“If you pull another kid out of somewhere, Bucky, I swear to god,” Tony exclaimed. Bucky shook his head.
“No. I come,” he answered, already pushing the blanket off and scooting over to the side of the bed where Tony was standing.
"A little. It's fine," Bucky replied quickly.
“We have to,” Steve replied, nodding. “He needs this.”
“No, they said...the doctor— I can’t..”
“We don’t negotiate with terrorists, Captain Rogers. I think you know that,” Fury replied, so calmly that Steve reacted before even thinking. He charged forward the few feet that were between them slamming the palms of his hands into the other mans chest so that he stumbled back.
“See you soon, Peanut.” Steve left without another word but Bucky came up behind Tony once the elevator doors closed.
“No, he’s good. I’ll let him nap here,” Tony answered, arm tightening around the boy. Steve smiled and kissed Tony’s cheek.
“Yes,” Steve insisted. “He loves you, Buck.”
“Buck,” Steve stepped forward slowly. “He’s not going to cause her pain unnecessarily, you know that. But we want to know for sure what’s wrong right? So it can be fixed?” He was next to his friend now and he ran his hand over Poppy’s head soothingly.
“Okay, thanks.” He headed to the elevator, bag in hand, and proceeded to the main floor. “Hey, Stevie,” he greeted as he walked into the kitchen.
“Yeah, kitty.” He tucked the stuffed animal under his arm and turned back to the table. There was a small amount of heart shaped candy as a treat and a new coloring book and crayons. Indy was bouncing on his toes as he looked through the book.  Steve grabbed him around the waist and plopped him onto his lap.
"Oh come on, Tony. This is it, right here. The chance to say what you want and hear what he has to say."
“Careful, sweetheart. Chew that good,” Steve told him, wiping some blueberry juice that was dripping down his chin off with his thumb. Tony cut a few blueberries in half and put them in the oatmeal bowl.
“Yeah, this one can be yours if you want it, buddy.” Bucky crouched down to his level. “Did you want a boy or a girl?” He pulled one of each off the shelf and showed Indy.
“I stay with Da?” Indy asked.
“I’m not doing anything,” Steve replied, at a loss as to how to de-escalate the situation.
“Our room,” Tony replied sincerely.  Steve looked up at that, sighing, and closing the book on his lap. Tony walked to the end of the bed, hands in the pockets of his hoodie. “What I said about Indy. I didn’t mean it, Steve. You’re so good with him. You’re gonna be the best dad, I’m so sorry,” Tony said quickly.
“I’m not here because I think I have to be,” Tony answered somewhat indignantly.
Tony’s hand closed around his bicep before he made it to the door. “So, what? You’re gonna go running to your BFF now?”
Steve entered the kitchen where Bucky was already getting some juice for Tony. “Did he call you a peanut?” Steve asked the boy. “Are you a little peanut?” He tickled his side and Tony laughed and buried his face against Steve’s chest.
“Sweetheart,” Steve sighed. “You are my family. And if you want Indy to be your family too then nothing would make me happier. Honestly. I can’t imagine my life without you now, and Indy’s gonna need you too. I was just trying to make sure that you knew that I wasn’t assuming that you would just step into the role of being a dad with no question. That’s all, I promise.” Steve tugged Tony closer until the brunette was leaning against his side.
“No,” Indy whined. Steve looked over at Tony.
“You wanna tell Bucky about that?” Tony asked the boy, nodding in the direction of the dinosaur.
“I volunteer to go last,” Pepper offered. “Mine’s more of an end of party gift.”
“Well, good morning to you too. What are you doing in my bed?” He asked with mock outrage, tickling Indy’s belly as he said it.
“He has a name,” Steve replied with a frown. “I don’t think I could change it now. It’s the only thing he has that didn’t have to do with Hydra. Plus, I kind of like that Bucky gave it to him.”
“Look, sweetheart,” Steve nudged. Indy picked his head up off Steve’s shoulder and looked at where Steve was pointing. Indy looked positively shocked at the assortment in front of him. Steve smiled and kissed his temple. “See anything you like here?”
Tony hummed. “This is the first time she’s been sick so it makes sense.” Steve nodded.
“I’ll need you to take your shirt off so I can take a look. Do you want Indy to be here for that?” Indy heard that of course and burrowed further into Steve’s side. Tony stepped over and plucked the little boy off the sofa, gaining a whine and kick for his trouble.
Part 1: Setting up for the birthday party
“Promise I’ll be good?” He looked at Bucky hopefully. Bucky sighed and unbuckled his seatbelt.
Steve woke up the next morning with a snuggly Tony still suck to his side. He had managed to sleep through the rest of the night and didn’t look like he would be waking up anytime soon so Steve decided to get up and make them a nice breakfast.
“No,” Tony replied, weakly. Steve rolled his eyes but pressed a kiss to his fluffy brown hair. He maneuvered Tony til he was facing him on his lap. He cupped Tony’s face with both of his hands, brushing the tears away with his thumbs.
*One month later*
“You could have had JARVIS tell me to come up,” Tony said, though not accusingly because Steve had no reason to think Tony would have been receptive to that. “I’m sorry I missed that. How long’s he been asleep?”
“I know,” he replied simply which made Steve laugh
Tony sat him at his plate which was waiting for him with his waffle still on it.
Steve sighed. “Indy, I’ll lay you down here but you have to be very careful, got it?”
“I get that this is a difficult situation,” Steve said carefully. “But maybe you can start slow. Spend some time with her. Even if it’s with me or Tony.”
“And the kid?” Tony persisted, nodding at him. Bucky made eye contact for a second, sighed, and then reached down to his backpack which was beside his chair on the floor. He pulled out a file folder and slid it in front of Tony.
He then took his son from Bruce and went over to the backpack he’d packed for the rescue that he dropped by the door to the jet. He pulled Luca’s favorite blankie out, the one with puppies on it, and wrapped it sound Luca’s body leaving just his head and arms unwrapped. “There we go, all comfy with your blankie,” Steve said with a kiss to his forehead. “You’re my little puppy, huh?” Luca reached a hand to Steve’s lips and Steve pretended to eat them which got a shocked smile and giggle from his son. Steve smiled back but also teared up because it was the first smile he’d seen from his son in so long, in person or live-stream. “You’re such a good boy,” he said cuddling him close. “You were so good for Uncle Bruce, weren’t you?” Luca’s eyelids were drooping and his head kept falling into Steve’s shoulder. Steve brought his hand up, cupping Luca’s head, and keeping him flush against him. “Just sleep, sweet boy. You need to rest. Everything’s okay now.” Steve swayed and walked around the cabin of the quintet, circling Bruce and Tony so he’d be close in case Tony woke up.
“Did you really need two, sweetheart?” Steve asked, glancing to Pepper apologetically.
Clint and Natasha left and Steve resumed his spot on the sofa, nodding off here and there for seconds but always waking himself back up to watch. At 4 am Peter came out of the bedroom and rejoined him.
"And don't you forget it," she replied. Tony smiled. Bucky looked awestruck.
“Of course,” Steve agreed. “It’s fine, Tony. I’m comfortable with you in my lap, I just wanted to make sure you were.”
Steve nodded quickly. “Okay, yeah. Come on, let’s get out of the lobby.” He gestured for Bucky  to follow and Bucky picked the kid up and held him as he followed Steve, Tony and Natasha following close behind. They entered the elevator and Steve went to select the button for their personal floor but Tony pushed his hand away selecting the floor where the Avengers normally hold their meetings instead. Steve made eye contact with Tony who just shook his head and looked away.
“Love you too. Forever. Lay down next to me,” he said.
“Do you still want me?” Tony asked quietly.
“Let’s look at you, Tater Tot.” Tony stood him on the bed and kept hold of his hand to steady him while he and Steve stepped back to look. Steve went back into the bathroom and got the baby comb, came back and brushed Indy’s still damp dirty blonde hair with a part off to the side and then neatly combing it into place.
“What?”
Ignoring that, JARVIS continued. “He has a small child with him as well.” Steve was off the sofa before anyone else even thought about moving.
Bucky made quick work of finding Steve in the intensive care waiting area. “Hey,” he called out.
“Yes, your vote counts, but I think we need to ask the most important person in all this.” He reached out for his son who leaned in to his hold instantly. “We’re talking about your full name, buddy.”
Bucky looked up confused. “Morning, kiddo.”
“The doctor said he’s not out of the woods but barring any complications he should recover fully. How’s Poppy been for ya?”
“I see. Very nice,” Steve said dutifully. They had decided to get him a couple more since he loved the ones he had received for his birthday.
Steve sighed. “Tony and Luca were kidnapped this morning. We have a livestream the kidnappers sent us and there’s a ransom request that we just got and that’s what we were fighting about.” Peter looked like he was going to cry but held it together.
“I want to do this with you,” Tony replied so quietly that Steve almost missed it. He smiled. Tony looked up and Steve met his gaze and then kissed his forehead.
“I love you,” Steve murmured, voice thick with emotion. “I can’t lose you, Tony. This can’t happen again.”
“That’s not true-,” Steve started.
Tony kept up a running stream of commentary which calmed Luca as he fed, keeping his eyes on his dad. When he finished the bottle Steve propped him up on his shoulder and patted his back so he’d burp. After a couple minutes he let out a soft one and Steve bounced him a little.
“You feeling a little better?” Bucky asked him.
“Well, we started small. For this first visit I really just wanted to get a gauge for his personality, temperament, and what his level of understanding was to what we were discussing. I think we were able to get a good start.” She smiled. “I do want to say he is such a sweet boy. Very polite. Regardless of his start in life it’s very clear that he has great people taking care of him now.”
“Buppy,” Indy repeated softer. Bucky ruffled his hair.
“Yeah,” Tony said. “Nat, wanna hold this peanut for a bit?” He lifted Indy who laughed at the nickname.
“Yeah,” Tony said, and a second later Peter could see Tony’s face. Peter held the phone so he and Luca were in frame. He waved Luca’s hand at the camera.
“Of course, Captain.” JARVIS replied, startling Indy.
“It’s okay, Tony. Really. Just tell us,” Steve told him.
When they were all done Steve looked at his son and sighed. There was oatmeal and blueberry all over his face, his hands, and disturbingly, dried in his hair which looked like it was not going to be easy to scrub out.
“Yeah, might as well. Indy, so you know how Steve is your dad?” Bucky asked. Indy’s brow furrowed. He pointed at Tony.
"I think he plans to order in. They're looking at menus."
Natasha stood up, pulling Clint to his feet next to her. “I think us non-essentials will leave you to figure this out.” Clint grumbled something about wanting to stay but he followed her out.
“Yeah I smile like this!” Indy smiled wide, showing all his teeth, eyes squinted shut and Bucky snapped a pic.
“Sorry we woke you, Peanut.” Tony sat him up a little in his arms. “This is dad,” he said, pointing to Steve. “I’m going to be your dad too because Steve here is willing to share you, but you gotta call him something.”  Steve smirked.
“Come on, messy boy,” Steve picked him up. He grabbed the llama that was tucked into the seat next to Indy before the boy could protest but he held it himself so it didn’t get food all over it. “Time to get cleaned up.” Indy looked over his shoulder as Steve walked down the hall to the bathroom.
“Indy he’s really upset right now, you’ll be better off with Happy just for a little while.”
“Come on, kiddo, just pick one,” Bucky laughed.
“Hey, Cap,” Tony answered shortly, already looking back to the mass of metal parts in front of him.
Indy didn’t look up but nodded again. He nervously fidgeted with one of the pieces in his hand.
Bucky sighed. “Okay, as cute as this is we have one mission right now and that is to get ready for this wedding, so come on.” He grabbed Indy around the waist and put him back on the floor.  He took the light pink dress and pulled it over Poppy’s head. “There’s my pretty girl,” he said, and Poppy beamed at him. He took the little baby brush and combed the little hair she had and then slid the headband around the crown of her head. The little flower that was attached to it just off to the side. “All right. I think you’re done sweetheart.” He picked her up, holding her close and straightening her dress. “You look beautiful,” he whispered, getting choked up with the emotion that hit him suddenly. He kissed her temple and took a moment but knew he couldn’t linger with Indy running circles around them.
Peter huffed. “I don’t like this.”
“Depends, what do you have in mind?” He asked, but he was smiling.
Bucky brought her to his room, closing the door softly behind him. He laid her in the bassinet  that was next to his bed and she whined and waved her arms in protest.
“Oh my god,” Steve exclaimed. “He’s been tortured by Hydra for almost 3 years.” He ran his hand over his face.
“You come with me,” she told Clint who jumped up from his spot on the sofa. She kissed Tony’s cheek and leaned in to whisper to him.
"Stevie go upstairs, I'm fine," Bucky told him, nodding in the direction of the door.
"That hurt?"
“I hate to even think this but maybe he has some bad memories of being strapped down?” Tony asked hesitantly.
Bucky hissed in pain when he bent his wrist back at a certain angle. "What happened there?" Tony asked.
They arrived at the location, an abandoned industrial building in the middle of nowhere, that Coulson drove them to with Steve in the passenger seat and Natasha and Clint in the back with Graves cuffed between them.
“Okay, all done,” Bruce announced, backing away. Tony passed her back to her father who took her immediately and stood, holding her close to his chest and bouncing her gently.
Tony forced himself not to react even though his heart felt like it was about to explode. Luca was 8 months old now, he ate soft foods three times a day and breastfed around 8 times. Two feedings weren’t enough unless they got out of this quick.
If you have any ideas of situations/prompts for these characters in for other fics drop the idea in the comments!
“We’ll deal with whatever we have to, okay? But for now, don’t focus on that. Hopefully we’ll find them today or tomorrow and no harm will be done.”
“Papa, up?” Steve picked him up and they took the elevator down to the floor where there was a Stark Industries conference room. Tony had booked the therapy appointment and paid extra to have her come to them. She arrived shortly after they did, escorted by security, carrying a duffle bag filled with supplies.
“I’ll be back soon. Be good for Bucky,” Steve ruffled the boys hair. Indy waved at him and then reached back for the soup.
“Nope. I was very well behaved. As always.” He bounced Indy in his arms and walked down the hall. Steve followed, shaking his head.
“You’re gonna have to go commando, there’s no underwear here.” Tony smiled up at Steve as he helped his feet into the right holes and then slid the pants up his legs. Steve stood so Tony could pull them up to his waist and then sat back down again. Tony helped him get the sweatshirt on and then he took one last wipe and cleaned Steve’s face off.  “There. Looking good, Captain Rogers.” Steve rolled his eyes and Tony was happy to see a tiny smile. “I don’t suppose I can talk you into using a wheelchair to get out of the building?”
“Me?” He asked.
“Baby bed,” Indy told him, pointing behind himself and Tony. “All done!”
“Maybe just one pack for now. He’s not even using them yet,” he laughed. Tony debated on which one, deciding on the robots finally and dropping it in the cart. He had picked out a couple of pajama sets and a few long sleeve shirts, all of which Steve agreed they needed. Steve picked out a few more of the pajamas himself before they left that area.
Four days later the doctor released Tony from the hospital on the promise that he spend the next two weeks, at least, resting in bed or on the sofa with absolutely no strenuous work.
“Very sweet of you,” Steve told his son.
“It’s four days from now,” Clint answered.
“Boo,” Indy whispered, still staring at the string in his hand. Steve and Tony chuckled.
"I'm sorry, what? You didn't even read them." Tony was shocked.
“Tony?” Steve called softly as he walked closer from where he had stopped in the doorway. Tony’s head snapped up to look at his husband. “I’m sorry, Bubba. I’m so sorry. I have no right to rush you. You need to heal. You and Luca. If you need to keep him close there’s nothing wrong with that.” He dropped down to his knees before Tony once again. “I love you both so much. I can’t leave Tony, I can’t.” Tony broke hearing that. He started crying and Peter nervously stood up.
“Well, we’re gonna make sure we say hi and talk to everyone today, not just Bucky,” Steve replied. He pushed Indy’s food toward Tony so he could help the boy and he got up to get the package of blueberries out of the fridge for his boyfriend to snack on but also because Indy seemed to want to eat what Tony was eating at any given time, and he seemed to like blueberries last time he tried them. He opened the pack and placed them in front of Tony who instantly grabbed a handful and filled his mouth. Indy saw and reached out so Tony handed him one berry. Indy all but threw it in his mouth to copy Tony causing his parents to laugh.
Steve stood quickly and met him halfway across the empty room. He clung on to him as soon as he was close enough. Bucky wrapped his free arm around Steve’s back and held him as he shook in his grip. “It’s gonna be okay,” he said for Steve and Indy’s benefit. “I’m going to see if I can talk to the doctor okay and figure out what’s going on.” Steve nodded and pulled away reluctantly. “Sit,” Bucky ordered him and placed Indy on his lap once he did. “Indy really wanted to see you,” he said in case Steve was wondering why he ended up bringing him. “Why don’t you give your Papa some cuddles,” he told Indy who instantly curled into Steve’s chest.
Steve smiled softly and reached over to squeeze his friends shoulder. “I think he’s in the communal kitchen, I’ll go see if he can take a look.” Steve left the room and Tony leaned over so he was pressed against Bucky’s shoulder. Bucky turned Poppy so she was leaning back in his arms and Tony could see her face.
“Indy,” Steve said breathlessly. He was still having a hard time believing both Tony and his son were okay. The boy looked over.
“Wow, that’s the coolest shirt I’ve ever seen, Peanut,” he exclaimed. “And look at you speaking full sentences.” He kissed his cheek. Steve smiled at the pair of them and then gently pulled Indy’s pants off quickly swapping them for a new pair in a size 2T.
“Hi, I’m Tony Stark.” He stepped forward with his handout which she shook returning the greeting.
“Lay back, buddy.” Indy laid down and Steve pulled out a baby wipe and wiped off his chest in case there was any residual smoothie stickiness. He pulled the elastic waist jeans off of him and checked the pull up he was wearing. It was damp. He had been getting better at the potty training and would tell them when he had to go but he still had accidents and Steve assumed that, today at least, he probably had his accident during his standoff with Tony. He pulled off the pull up and wiped him clean. “Do you need to go anymore before I put the new one on?”
“No hate Da,” Indy whispered through his tears.
“Not upset,” he mumbled, even as Steve could see the tears he was blinking back. He brought his hand up to cup the side of Tony’s face and swiped a tear away with his thumb.
“Romanov and Cap got separated. She made it back to the rendezvous point where the other agents were waiting but Rogers hasn’t shown up yet. It’s been a couple hours and it looks like the Hydra camp they were trying to infiltrate is moving out.”
Bucky brought Indy outside to the top of the aisle where Pepper waited for him. She had volunteered to wait with Indy and tell him when to walk so Bucky could take his place next to Steve at the alter as Best Man. He let go of Indy’s hand and crouched down so they were eye level. “You ready little man?” Indy nodded, although he seemed much more subdued in the face of his task, seeing people on both sides in their respective seats. Noticing this Bucky added, “You’re gonna do great. You get to drop all the petals. That’s the best part right?”
Steve ran his other hand over her head, lightly ruffling the thin wisps of baby hair she had. “Her hair’s darker than Indy’s,” he said. Tony nodded in agreement.
"You're gonna be here awhile, don't starve yourself on my account," Tony supplied.
“Fine.” Tony stood up. “It’s his nap time so I’m going to try to sleep too.” Tony bent to place a quick kiss on top of Luca’s head and then left the room. Luca gurgled and waved his hand so Steve caught it and put his finger in his sons grip. Luca squeezed gently and Steve smiled at him.
“Let her in, J,” Tony replied.
“Okay, times up bud,” he said as he approached the chair. He wasn’t fully prepared for what he saw when he turned he chair back around though. Tony, who had been silent the entire time save for a sniffle here and there, was a mess. He was sobbing uncontrollably, albeit quietly. His face was red and soaked in tears, as well as the top part of his shirt. He kept swiping at his eyes with his sleeve but more tears came too quick for it to make a difference.  “Hey, come on, Tony.” He put his hands out in offering and Tony practically threw himself at Steve. Steve hoisted him up, pulling him against his chest and heading to the bathroom. “I know you’re upset, baby. You don’t have to be quiet you know? It’s okay to cry when you feel bad about something.”
The girl's mom helps her get on Steve's lap. As she does, Steve glances up, over her head, and catches Tony's eye. He smiles.
Just after 9:00, Jan calls them all together. "Okay, everyone! Head for the tree! It's time for presents!"
"You can't be serious," Steve says. It's lame, but it's all he has the strength for.
needs him.
It's very true. Part of him had worried that Tony would stay away for much longer than this. Long enough, for instance, for Steve to get over his burst of inconvenient feelings.
What he does after that though, he never really remembers.
Tony looks taken aback, as well he might. Steve is hardly the type of person to encourage shirking one's duty. But then he says, a bit reluctantly, "No, not tonight."
So because there is no point in playing that game, Steve doesn't even try. He just walks further into the armory and sits down on a stool not far from Tony's desk. There is a microscope on the table in front of him, and an assortment of petri dishes, though none of them seem to be in use at the moment. He considers them, but says nothing.
"Yeah," Tony says. His thumb rubs the back of Steve's neck. He probably doesn't even know he's doing it.
Beside him, Tony closes his eyes. His shoulders slump. "I know."
The simple truth, he thought, was that he didn’t want to be here.
What Tony does is very simple. He leaves.
No one mentions Tony Stark or Iron Man. Or the fact that the entire day was paid for by the Maria Stark Foundation.
Some gifts are better just torn into, pretty wrapping paper ripped and tossed aside. Some, though, are worth taking the time to unwrap, enjoying the experience of the unveiling, the discovery of what lies beneath the glitter.
But he has to say this. It's not fair to Tony and the rest of the team if he doesn't. So he takes a deep breath and he says, "Do you have a minute? I wanted to talk with you about something?" He can hear the way his voice rises a little, turning it into a question, but it's too late to take it back now.
But he's seen the way Tony looks at him sometimes, always when Tony thinks he isn't watching. And he's noticed, too, over the years, that whenever Tony upgrades their equipment or their costumes, Captain America's is always first on the list.
Heading for Steve.
He gets to work right away. Normally he would never dream of touching anything in here, or do anything that would take away from the order Tony has imposed on everything. To the average person the various workstations might look like random disorganization, but Steve knows that there is actually quite a precise order to it all. Tony knows where everything is, and where everything should be. If he were to move anything around, he would actually be making things worse, not helping.
But Steve stared at him, and a slow smile spread across his face. “Really?”
The line of kids waiting to see Santa extends for approximately four miles. Or so it seems to Steve, sitting there on his Santa-styled throne. All he knows is that it's long. Really long. Kids and their parents or older siblings stand around waiting with varying degrees of patience. Some of them are sucking on candy canes. Others stare wide-eyed at Thor in his sparkly Santa hat or the various empty Iron Man suits standing around dressed like snowmen. Jan flits along the line, a tiny little elf making kids smile, while Tony waits at the head of the line, last one to talk to the kids before they venture up to the chair where Santa Cap sits.
The pull eastward, toward Steve, was irresistible. Tony didn’t even try to refuse. Nor did he want to. He had been along out here too long. He needed to see Steve again. He needed to.
"I don't know yet," Steve says, "but we'll figure it out."
Steve smiles. "I knew it." He coughs again, and lets his eyes close.
He coughs, swallows back a groan and thick blood.
The silence between them now is uncomfortable. They sit on the edge of the couch, further apart than is really necessary. Steve clasps his hands between his knees. "We've been friends for a long time."
"And you don't really love me," Tony says.
“That was last week,” Tony said. A year ago. A lifetime ago. How could he ever have wandered happily through that maze of exhibits, champagne glass in one hand and a gorgeous woman on his other arm, thinking he was the king of the world? How could he have thought he had anything at all, when in truth he had had nothing?
"I don't know, tell him to go back to bed! And stop laughing!"
Until Tony's phone started to ring again.
"What-" Bucky burst into laughter, seeing Steve's feet squeezed into two sizes too small pumps.
"Man, why it is so loud in here?!"
"Bring it on, sugar," she said enticingly. Steve smiled wider and leaned down while Red put her hands on his cheeks, bringing their lips into a kiss, probably the last one before she would take the makeup off after her show. The deal was sealed. "Now, get out, I need to get ready," she said, when the kiss ended, turning back to the mirror.
"Nah. He should be relieved. Now he can go out with his friends and throw eggs at passersby or something. I am kidding!" Tony added, seeing Steve opening his mouth to deny that no son of his would behave like that. "Also, what party? He invited two friends over."
It was late evening when Tony had just finished putting the leftover veggies into the fridge and straightened up, stretching his spine out. He could call the drag queens meeting a success, but he also felt so tired. He smiled when he saw a torn out page from the fashion magazine stuck to his fridge with a magnet, a ruby red maxi dress with an open back presented on a model and Arrow's print next to it.
“Uhm, well,” Tony said when Steve let him go, looking adorably shy. “Back in my days, people tried to stay more covert.”
Steve left the bakery, holding the pink package and smiling lightly. He was hoping that Tony would love his surprise.
"Just leave me to die here."
Tony groaned and threw arms over his face, covering himself. “I hate you and your young, smooth skin,” he grunted, sounding embarrassed. The age difference between them wasn’t so big to start with, but sometimes Tony felt more bothered by it.
If Tony wanted to mess with him, Steve won't remain idle.
“Mmm, okay,” Steve agreed, kissing his boyfriend again and rolling on his side, placing Tony beside him as he felt he needed to use the bathroom. “What’s the dress code for today?” he joked, a light jab at Tony’s vast wardrobe.
"I wanted to thank you."
"Hey, Steve…"
"Just imagine how frightened I was when they both stood in the doorway looking like that! I thought someone assaulted them!"
“What is the next part?” Steve asked, walking to Red Velvet and handing her the dress and shoes.
Steve uncurled, his face less heated. Okay, it was coming to an end. Some more talking, and soon a red-haired woman in a white cosmetician coat walked out of the room. She spotted Steve and smiled, in a bit terrifying way. "She is all yours now."
He looked at the closed door, trying to remember where Tony had said the shower was because he could use a one. A very, very cold one.
“Bath bombs. You drop this into a bathtub and it fizzes and the water turns colorful and scented and amazing. You need to try one!”
God. People were staring at him. Just move along, nothing was happening here. Steve was just sitting outside Tony's changing room and curling in embarrassment. Perfectly normal.
"I am sorry for leaving you," Steve apologized again, kissing Tony's forehead and getting in bed, Tony making room for him, just to come closer when Steve lay down. Their legs tangled together and Tony put his head in the crook of Steve's neck, arms wrapped around each other, locking them in place.
The girl jutted her left hip forward and shook her head full of curly hair. Sharp eyebrows, long eyelashes, big lips colored with an electric blue lipstick giving that special pop to the look and tight black dress made from lace. Not the most extravagant look Steve had seen on a drag queen, but there was something hypnotic about it.
"What-" Tony immediately got up from bed, running to the window, hoping to see his boyfriend. It turned dark already and he didn't see much. "I am coming for you, stay where you are."
"It's been calling since you left," Tony laughed, pointing at his phone, confirming Steve's theory. Ah, phone calls with congratulations. The word spread quickly in the drag queen's world. That just gave Steve some time to make breakfast. He leaned down and quickly smooched Tony's, already puckered up lips, and walked out of the bedroom, still hearing Tony's voice.
"By twelve minutes. He loves pointing that out," Wanda hissed and Tony laughed.
Tony wasn’t sure what to think. On one hand, that wasn’t what he ordered (pun intended) and Steve instead of bringing his ass to the workshop, sent pizza as if silencing him with food. On the other hand, the hunger pangs in his stomach started and Tony efficiently had quieted them with work and caffeine, but couldn’t control it anymore, not when the scent of hot and delicious pizza was filling his whole workshop.
"Seriously," Tony huffed out, taking matters in his own hands, and forcing Steve to sit down on the small stool they had kept in the bathroom and began to comb Steve's hair, a bit too roughly, causing his boyfriend to hiss in pain. "Oh, shush. You have such great hair, and you chose the most awful hairstyles," Tony complained.
"Hey."
"I am taking those," Steve said, and before Tony could understand what Steve meant, he saw his boyfriend holding a pack of cigarettes.
“No, please,” Steve rushed in, and Tony paused. “Please let me pay. You found time for me, this is the least I can do.”
"Dirty whore," Stone commented and there was a disgusting laugh coming from two other seniors. "Time to put you back in your place. Killian! Hold his hands!"
Oh, insulted. That was a big word for the overblown offense of Figaro, their shared cat, playing with an old scrunchie. As their only child, Figaro was spoiled as a cat could be, eating the best selection of cat food, having cat towers and scratching posts in every room, and more toys a single cat could need, starting from the simplest stuffed toy mice to the fancy automatic laser lights. Yet, all that cornucopia of cat toys was no match for the stretched-out, yellow scrunchie that one day had slipped out from Thor's pocket and Figaro snatched, claiming for himself and dubbing the best thing ever. Since then, Figaro could be seen wildly pawing at the scrunchie, chasing it all over the place and when he got tired, he flopped down on the floor, the scrunchie near his face, and looked adoringly at it, clearly in love. No matter what Tony did, what he offered, he couldn't convince Figaro to play with anything else, and the only playtime he got with his cat, was when he begrudgingly tossed the yellow nightmare and Figaro kept bringing it to him, playing their version of fetch. The trend did catch on, and soon Natasha donated some of her hair ties and even Bucky added a one or two, and the collection kept growing, much to Figaro's delight and Tony's dismay, but the yellow scrunchie was the unquestionable winner and Figaro's true love. Steve wasn't quite sure if the true offense didn't lay deeper, rooted in the fact that Figaro chose Thor's belonging over many toys Tony had bought.
More silence. Tony could almost feel how tormented Steve was.
"Wanda is here with her twin brother, Pietro," Tony continued, pointing to the currently empty seat.
Tony smiled back, feeling a little insecure and overwhelmed. Clearly, Steve was not seeing what he was while looking at him. The stretch marks. The tired eyes. The way he walked like a duck.
Tony smiled, slow and beautiful before he rolled to the edge of the bed and pulled out a shoe box from underneath. He took the lid off and Steve saw a pair of black pumps, made from shiny faux leather, on an extremely high and slim heel, in Tony's size. Steve's breath immediately quickened. He and Red Velvet made out a couple of times, but fooling around with Tony while he was wearing only parts of his female side's wardrobe, was a new level of excitement.
Sam turned around, looking in surprise at Steve. "Hairnet!" he scolded, pointing to the shelve with a box of disposable hair nets.
“It is me,” Steve said, blinking more rapidly. “Steve. That’s me.”
"That's my boy," Sarah praised and Steve leaned his head for a hello kiss on his cheek. "Go wash your hands before dinner."
"What?" Tony mocked, just cracking a smile as his hips were not that sensitive, while he heard Peter kicking and laughing his heart out. "You thought this would work on me?"
"Haa! Ah ah ah! Steve, I am-!"
"Make up for it?" Steve asked in humor. "More like cramming last five years into it," he answered himself. It wasn't like he and Tony lacked romance in their relationship, it just simmered down into something more steady and comfortable in the last years. Being together for almost a decade developed their relationship from the wild and not having enough of each other into a sturdy and comfortable feeling of knowing that the other person would be always there. The love was still present and growing, not needing outbursts of feelings, but small everyday gestures of devotion. That's what their last Valentine's days embodied which took a form of a shared dinner over a movie and cuddling on the couch while in sweatpants. And it was as good as during the early years of their relationship when they had decided to meet in a hotel under fake names, romance each other all over again, and spent a wild night together.
"Can you hurry up, please?! The guys from the Xavier's School will be here any minute to pick up the cupcakes for their students!"
"Hi there."
Long story short - Steve was getting a Twitter account.
"Hey, Steve, how's your head?"
"Hey, Steve!" Bucky grinned at his friend, tilting his head up and creasing his eyebrows. "Huh, I thought you were smaller."
"Tony!" Bucky called, and Tony raised his eyebrow, not realizing that they became so close since yesterday. "Steve's - Steve's in trouble!" he managed to get out between gasps for air.
Steve blinked rapidly, the words sinking in. "That… That was really good," he said in awe, temporarily distracted from his dilemma.
“Um, yeah,” Steve nodded, walking after Tony into the crowded shop. It had a black sign above with the name of the shop in white, bold print and the shelves were in dark, almost black color, big signs above every cabinet indicating what products you could find. Steve guessed that the black interior was supposed to emphasize more the multicolored stock. In one hundred years, Steve wouldn’t guess that Tony would take him to a handmade cosmetic shop. That’s what he meant by restocking his supplies for the show. Makeup.
"That… that is mean," Steve admitted, chuckling lowly.
Figaro's ears twitched and he swooped his tail, Peter's bright eyes immediately following the movement and finding it amusing, chubby fingers trying to reach and touch the tail. Figaro didn't allow that, and walked a semi-circle around Peter's head and curled in the corner of the crib, forming a fluffy donut and closed his eyes. Peter babbled some more, turning on his tummy to better see Figaro. Somehow, the presence of the purring cat soothed him, and soon, Peter leaned his head down and closed eyes to sleep.
"Keep your mouth opened," Tiberius said, and Tony dropped his head, feeling desperate and hopeless. No, he didn't want this. Stop. A hand wrapped in his hair and yanked his head up roughly, and Tony whimpered in pain, tears rolling down his cheeks. Tiberius smiled cruelly, enjoying the sight of the other teen on his knees. "Anything you want to tell me?" he asked, giving Tony the last chance for an apology, and maybe, maybe he would go easy on him.
"Is that Tony?" Sarah asked in a surprised whisper, leaning closer to Sam and clapping enthusiastically with everyone else. Impressed was not a big enough word. She saw some of Tony's drag looks earlier, but only in photos and seeing this beautiful woman live was a different experience.
"This is all for you," Tony murmured, kissing Steve's shoulder, before putting his head back there. "And I had to eat all the burnt ones, so I am full," he said and made a displeased sound when Steve laughed, his shoulder jumping a bit and jostling Tony. "And I have a whole day planned for you! So, stock up on energy because you're gonna need it, birthday boy."
"Because you didn't allow him to invite more friends," Steve reminded, remembering Peter's offended outburst when Tony had stomped his foot and didn't agree to a wild Halloween party filled with teenage hormones under his roof.
"I thought we were going to eat."
"Yes, Tony," Sarah confirmed, meaningfully sliding a napkin closer to her son. "I bumped into him some time ago, and I asked him some more about skincare because the facial mask he recommended worked so well. Since then we stay in touch," she said and Steve could only listen and force his mouth to stay shut. He didn't know that Tony kept in touch with his mom. "It was his idea for me to start applying some makeup again and he recommended me a really good beautician and manicurist. My friends started to notice the change too, they say I look ten years younger," she laughed warmly.
"Eh," Steve shrugged it off and yawned, closing his eyes back to sleep, thinking that he didn't marry Tony for being an organized person, and his husband did have some adorable quirky qualities that made him more lovable.
“Hi, honey!” Sarah Rogers, Steve’s mom, smiled at her son. She had blond hair and blue eyes, something Steve had inherited from her and had a petite frame. Steve had to lean down when she walked over to kiss her son’s cheek as hello.
"Um, hi?" she said, not understanding the intense look.
Steve went through a mental list of what he and Tony had eaten since waking up. Scrambled eggs for breakfast, chicken and potatoes for lunch, sandwich with hummus and vegetables somewhere in between... Steve had the same and he was feeling fine.
“Hi. Double espresso, no sugar, please. And for you?”
“Huh…” Steve mused out, bits of information falling into one picture. They never discussed it, but in the back of his head, Steve had this thought that Tony enjoyed being tickled, or at least didn’t mind terribly. The way he squirmed between Steve’s tickling hands but didn’t try to run away. How he laughed and screamed for mercy whenever Steve targeted a sensitive spot and always seemed a bit disappointed when the tickling ended but masked it with a smile and complaints of being assaulted. Sometimes, Steve just felt provoked into tickling his boyfriend, like that one time, Tony had taken his sketchbook and hid away, refusing to say where he hid it and Steve had to tickle the information out of him until Tony was absolutely incoherent from laughter and breathless.
Wade looks at his dear friend and lets out a sigh “Peter I will never leave you no matter what! Okay?”
“I’m only going to be gone until three” Peter groans.
Wade sits with Peter in his room, Peter shows him all of the new things that he got recently. “You’ll be getting a whole bunch of new stuff too Wade, but until then you can have something of mine to sleep with” he says holding out his stuffed animals. “You can have anyone that you want” he smiles at Wade.
Steve looks over the work that Peter has done, Peter feels his body filling with anxiety waiting for Steve’s response to the math. Steve hands the papers to Peter “this is really good maybe you can help Tony in his lab when you’re older, not now though he tends to have things explode on him….” Steve laughs softly patting Peter’s head “come on let’s go home.”
Peter holds his arms up as Steve cleans the injuries. Peter explains how the boys pushed him down on the playground after calling him a nerd and saying he was unwanted by his real parents. Steve listens calmly as he applies bandages to Peter’s elbows “So you didn’t start a fight and Wade was just defending you?” Steve confirms with Peter.
Peter leaves them to do their own thing as he pulls a chair in front of the stove, he finds the pans and all the stuff for scrambled eggs and toast. Peter cooks breakfast for the three of them as Steve comes out to the kitchen. Steve watches the little boy cook and takes notice of little burn marks that seem to be healing “My name is Peter Parker” he says to the large man.
Thena, Thor’s daughter is laughing at Tony’s pain “well thank you Thor I’ll get you some hammer cleaner” He jokes trying to mask the shear pain in his back.
Peter wipes his eyes smiling up at the older boy “thank you Wade.”
“They don’t want me anymore” Peter crys
The drive to the school is short, the bus ride to the convention center was very boring for the boys, the whole day was planned, they would enjoy the field trip and once the classes went back to the buses the two wouldn't get on. They got split up by being in a different group from each other. This made Peter anxious, he didn't want to leave Wade’s side but the stupid teachers make him. Some guide lady directs the classes attention to a big thing of different types of spiders “then we have here a Achaearanea tepidariorum or otherwise known the common house spider” She says pointing to a glass case with twigs, grass, and other stuff for the spider. “This spider has been genetically modified with radiation, this has made it so the web is stronger, the spider itself seems to be immune to insecticides and some other nifty things” she finishes.
“Oh.. um yeah it’s what I would do whenever I was bored or trying to stay away from my foster parents…” Peter says as he starts up the second paper.
Wade and Peter sit outside the principal's office as  Natasha, Bruce, Steve, and Tony are all talking to him. Peter looks at Wade, he’s not hurt at all except for his knuckles. Wade looks at Peter and frowns “I’m sorry I let that happen to you” he looks down at his hands “I should’ve gone to pick you up from class…” he says softly.
“Lucky” Wade starts to feel a bit angry at this new boy
“Yeup I’m ready to go” Peter says smiling up at Wade.
Ms. Skye rushes to the door when the figure on the other side knocks. “Oh goodness you must be one of Peter’s fathers! I’m so happy to meet you, I have the best news about your son!” She says holding on to Steve’s hands.
“What’s wrong Steve that one always makes you laugh” Tony asks with concern.
“And do you feel ashamed of yourself for it?” Steve asks putting Peter’s belongings away.
“Only to see if what they have done has negative effects on the boy” he smiles to reassure her
“Oh yeah definitely, this school has zero tolerance or something” Gwen chimes in again.
Steve punches a person and Tony calls for "The Hounds."
“I’ll have two root beers please” she says as Wade’s and Jack’s eyes meet.
“I love you Tony~” Steve says peeking out at his boyfriend
The blood drained from Steve’s face as he watches blood slowly drip from his poor baby’s elbows “Oh No Peter!” Steve picks Peter up as fast as he can and rushes him to the bathroom “why didn't you say anything you have been in so much pain! Oh my poor baby!” Steve says frantically looking for the first aid kit.
“Wade what kind of soda do you want?” She asks him
“Okay well let’s go buy me stuff” Peter says pulling Steve to the elevator, Tony takes Steve’s other hand. The three of them stand awewarkly in the elevator waiting to let them off in the lobby.
“Ow hey you’re the one who fell onto me!” Wade laughs.
“He called our son satan spawn, said it would be better to just get rid of him, and that he used to beat him.” Steve explains like sparknotes.
“Yes you” Peter says hugging Wade “Wade… run away from home with me…” he begs.
“Yeah bud I’m hungry so I’m going to eat, go play it’ll be more fun than watching me eat” Tony laughs.
“Shit we need to go now!” the man holding him said. The three of them rush towards where they had broken in from. The lights flicker on as Peter is thrown into a helicopter, all of the men had made it safely on, he knew he was in big trouble.
“Of course we do, you are the best thing that has ever happened to us, you are so important to us, Peter do you understand why your words hurt Tony so badly now?” Steve wipes away his tears as he smiles at him.
It’s quite, warm, and dark. Jack sits up yawning. “You're finally awake” a voice startles Jack causing him to fall onto the floor.
“Is that so?” the grump wanders around his kitchen
Wade wakes up to a loud commotion outside his room, he looks over at his clock to see it was almost noon, his dad must have just gotten back from an early morning mission. He quickly gets up and dressed so he looks presentable for his father. Wade peeks out from his room to see if the coast is clear, which it is. He makes a break for the “Learning Room” or so his father calls it.
Peter refuses to even go near Tony, the guilt would probably kill him. Well at least that’s how bad he felt, Peter knows that what he said to Tony hurt him deeply that’s why they’re both hurting so much. He never meant to hurt Tony as bad as he had, he just wanted him to feel hurt like he did to him. An eye for an eye, but no Tony took an eye and Peter had taken his heart. It’s very clear that he has done something every wrong.
There is no god, life is going to be blown into oblivion, Tony and Steve were definitely dead. Tony’s head hurt like no tomorrow and he could swear he felt a smaller body next to his. Steve felt like he was never going to wake up again, the comatose feeling held his body down into his side of the bed, what the hell is that small thing next to him?
It’s not funny. “How can they possible forget about me?! I mean Tony even sleeps next to me at night but it’s like I’m not even there anymore!” Steve raises his hands in a motion as if to give up.
The boys look at each other then back at Peter before they push him down. As Peter falls down his glasses fall to the ground, one of the boys stomps on his glasses breaking the lenses. Peter lands on the hard ground busting his elbows as he reaches futilely for his glasses.
Wade is taken aback for a moment, “Friends? This kid has to be kidding! No one wants to be friends with us!” the voices chime in “Yes we’re friends” Wade glares at the air around them.
“The adults don’t like fighting of any kind” Mary Jane hums softly as she takes her seat.
“Miss Skye, you know Peter you're really good at math” She looks over his answers smiling at the paper.
~~~~~~~~~~~
“What did your real family not want you?” the other teases.
At recess Peter looks around for Wade and Weasel, Steve said that they should be in school together though those two would be in the Second Grade a year above him. Peter makes his way around the entire playground looking for Wade. In his search for his friend two bigger boys approach him. “Look at the little nerd boy with the two dads” one of them teases.
“Here take a look” Ms. Skye gives Steve the homework sheets that Peter has completed.
Tony comes back up to their floor only to see Wade standing with Steve and Peter. “Peter I Told You I Don’t Want You Hanging Out With Him!” Tony yells again.
“So Wade who is your friend” the man with the metal arm asks.
Bruce sighed  patting the boy’s head “well Wade you’re just a boy and you are now my son apparently so that mean you are to never call yourself that ever again” he smiles washing off the dried blood “you’re never going to be hurt like this by anyone of us I promise”
Peter laughs softly as he bashfully scratches the back of his head “yeah it’s kinda a hobby.” he explains.
Wade jumps over the table faster than Jack could say something to Wade. Jack is on the floor in a constrictor like embrace “OHMYFUUCK WEASEL!!!” Wade is yelling with excitement.
“Of course I do! I hate myself for what I said to Tony” Peter whimpers as the tears start to fall.
The kiss was short and sweet, the promise of many more to come laced their lips together. ‘I love you’s promise them forever and after, nothing could break the bonds that they have made. They part only for a moment before Tony places a quick peck against Steve’s lips. The doors open to their floor and Tony is the first to get off the elevator.
“Thanks Gramps” Jack gets up off the floor and moves to the table
“Hey umm Mr. Stark and Mr. Rogers… who’s going to make breakfast?” a little boys voice asks out of the blue.
The fridge is now plastered with math homework when Tony gets home. What on earth have Steve and Peter been up too? And who did all the math? Tony is about to call out for Steve when Peter and Wade magically appear next to him giggling like toddlers. “Hey Mr. Stark Peter is going to give you a run for your money” Wade laughs.
“Peter it says that you’re sorry, it tells me that you didn't mean it and that you want to stay here, you said it yourself just now you hurt someone that cares about you. Peter you know that we care about you but do you know that we love you?” Steve rubs Peter’s shoulders to help him calm down.
“I see well you have nothing to worry about sweetheart your dad and I love you very much and we’ll always want you” She smiles at him.
Steve stops as his find the first aid kit and looks at Peter “oh Peter… Of course I would care I love you sweet heart” Steve says wiping Peter’s tears away. “No will you be a big boy and hold your arms up for me” Steve asks soothingly.
“Sorry father.. But they were talking again.. I didn’t know what to do.” he could feel his voice tremble in fear.
“Listen here bub it would just be better for you and your wife to send him back to where you got him from” The man says
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Oh Peter is a math wiz! And he’s going to be helping me with my math from now on!” Wade laughs clinging to Peter.
