Steve didn’t want to wake him, things would be harder if tony was aware. Steve didn’t know why tony had insisted on staying here but he knew that was not going to be possible. Whether he liked it or not, stane was right about shield being dangerous for tony. This was no place for a teenager to be playing around.
“I feel fine” Tony insisted as he snaked up a hand behind Steve’s neck playing with the golden hair.
“I know honey, I know" Steve didn’t know what else to say or how to make this better but for now he would just do whatever Tony needed him to.
Steve was just about to close his eyes as he heard the slightest of whimpers from Tony and he was on his feet immediately,  hands hovering over his form
Steve froze for a second his heart skipping a beat and natasha gave him a slight nudge to snap out of it.
“So is that the special one?” she asked as she pointed to Tony with her chin.
“why?” tony asked , betrayal and anger combined with his labored breathing came out more as a gasp. Steve approached tony slowly his hands in front of him , and carefully took hold of Tony’s hand waiting to see of tony would allow it. Once he was certain tony wouldn’t push him away he wrapped his hands around the genius pulling him to his chest.
Tony was yet to meet thor and every time Steve mentioned the norse God Tony’s eyes bulged a little.
“why? That’s stupid” he huffed
"I didn't want you to see me like this" his voice hitched at the end of the sentence and Steve really wanted to wrap the teen with his arms.
"of course captain. Sir's temp is currently 99.8 degrees Fahrenheit"
“what I think is a fifteen year old should be kissing other fifteen year olds. I thought you were a genius” he smiled at Tony ,dropped his hand and took a step back.
“you are okay" he said softly running his hand through his hair as he took in his saddened face. He was flushed red up to his ears and Steve just let him sit there until his breaths calmed.
“You are captain America” Tony said instead
Tony let out a shaky breath as Steve trailed his fingers lightly over his straining shaft and that did it for Tony
“Who’s your frie-" Tony started “oh hi natasha" he said clearly surprised not expecting to see her.
Steve was hesitant to leave him. But this had to be done so he nodded and Bruce left after injecting something into Tony’s IV.
“yeah he really does need all the wishes he can get, Tony stark is not an easy mark to handle. “
“It’s his birthday” phil stated and Steve and clint shared a look. The look that mostly said it wasn’t going to be a very good birthday.
“Good baby, so good for me” he said pulling Tony’s legs wider apart with his feet  and Tony mewled eyes closing against his own volition and Steve stilled his fingers near Tony’s waist holding on firmly.
I dropped the wrench I was holding in my hand and walked over to him,to see what he wanted me to look at. Banner and me occasionally asked each other for insight on our projects we are working on ,it has sort of become a ritual.
“I am going to attach some leads to him, monitor his heart . Steve he needs to be propped up a little more, it will help his breathing. Clint grab the oxygen mask.” Bruce was all business, he didn’t stop to see if anyone was actually doing what they were told. He grabbed supplies for an iv and set it up dragging the pole near the bed
After another twenty minutes of pointlessly idling around his students , they finally decided that they were ready to move onto the next floor and Steve almost sighed in relief and was met with a knowing smile from Natasha. He ignored her, about to walk past her when the elevator opened and a frazzled looking pepper stepped out, her eyes scanning the floor rapidly and relaxed only when it landed on Steve’s own. She made her way quickly to him , ignoring her friends around her who tried to get her attention and stopped so close to Steve, no sense of personal boundary when  he realised that she wanted to tell him something that was not meant to be heard by the others. He frowned and leaned down so she didn’t have to crane her neck up and whisper
“No you don’t!” He argued and Steve was surprised at the tenacity in his voice “I don’t want to be treated like a child in this relationship.  I am not stupid and I don’t need you to coddle me and protect me.”
“But I can tell you now that he can go home this evening. I’ll have the nurses do the paperwork and keep you informed. Let us know if you need anything else" steve thanked him and headed towards the room Tony was kept in.
Steve considered it for a moment , Tony was in no condition to be in school today. And to be honest Steve himself didn’t know why he was here today. So he made a decision letting his hand run through his hair he got up from the chair
Careful not to apply pressure Steve ran a hand down along the front of Tony’s pants, and sighed still feeling the hardness and Tony whimpered in his sleep.  What ever drug was in his system had made him drowsy and maybe that was a good thing for now.  He just readjusted his grip on Tony and settled in.
"Are you sure it's a girl?" He asked wondering if maybe it was Tony trying to reach him through pepper's phone.
The bed big enough to accommodate both Steve and Tony and maybe even natasha. There were three more beds in the room, a couch and a lot tech to keep Tony occupied.
I am still wondering if Steve should just do it with Tony,  probably help release some tension between the two that's been going around lately.
“I am sorry, whatever I said I was clearly not thinking straight and I will apologize to Bruce I promise -" steve squeezed his arms a little to gett him to stop
“how about we go to my place huh? It’s only a 15 minute drive. Is that okay?” he asked hoping that’s what Tony meant
“then give me a kiss and make it better" Steve challenged hand still steady and grounding on his chest , Tony leaned forward without hesitation and kissed him .
“okay , good talk. I need to head to shield, have a meeting with fury. You need to get your head in order and Bruce,  do you need a ride?” Everything came to abrupt but satisfying end. He was feeling a lot better from the fuming mess he was in the morning. He realized they had actually spent all evening discussing about this. He didn’t know where tony was at the moment but he knew clint was with him.
Steve unfortunately did not have the kind of self control he had been trying to use with Tony today, because he had missed this and it had been a hard couple of days. And that one little kiss made his Cock stir in interest and Steve had to forcefully remind himself that Tony was currently recovering from heart surgery.
“I am fine for now…but it will kill me if we leave the reactor in there.”
“Kay" he mumbled and Steve knew he was falling asleep . Whatever the drug was , was making Tony drowsy and he was honestly thankful for it at the moment. He spoke quietly to him telling him some nonsensical story about his days as a teen.
He looked about ready to pass out and Steve gently pulled his legs closed and layed down next to him pulling him close , wrapping his arms around the teen.
“Just cant” he whispered .
Tony violently shook his head as the fear replaced the sadness on his face and Steve caught on immediately
He still needed to make sure it didn’t happen again, his entire team will be at risk.
“iron man! Status report ,NOW!” steve shouted his voice adding a grunt at the end as he slammed his shield effectively cutting the head off of a monster.
“Now we wait for natasha, and while we wait for natasha…” Steve said waiting for Tony to lift his head up.
The next twenty minutes went by with Tony introducing the characters and giving insight into their traits. But as the next episode started , Tony’s eyes were drooping as he fought to stay awake and Steve carefully eased him down so Tony’s Head was pillowed on Steve lap and he gently carded his hands through his hair as his breathing evened out.
“Better?” tony nodded
she threatened but even before she could mention the threat Tony took the four long steps towards her throwing his arms around her and Steve did the same but kept his distance from the two knowing natasha would need the support due to her injury.
“don’t touch  me” he said moving away as steve tried to reach out to him. He shifted sitting up on the bed , pulling the IV out and his feet landing on the floor. Steve threw his head back in frustration his eyes closed , taking in a deep breath  he asked “where are you going?” tony didn’t even look up ,he was searching for his shoes on the floor and gave up when he didn’t find them and got up anyway on his bear feet buttoning up his shirt.
Clint and Steve were just glad that she was doing all the talking.
“okay I really hope so too and don’t worry about the car, You can pick me up on the way to school tomorrow” Steve thanked him, eternally grateful for having a friend like him.
“Any idea where the ice packs are?” he asked as he rummaged through the supplies
Just as he was about to hit the redial button, the screen lit up again with Tony's incoming call.
“I am officially seventeen" he tried
He realized he was lying against someone their small thin fingers going through his greasy dirty hair . His first guess would have been natasha if it was not for his vision which finally cleared and he saw nat and Clint talking to a shield mmedic. His face caught up faster than his brain did when he turned his head a sluggish grin on his face as he eyes met Tony’s. He was lying against Tony and it seemed like the little brunette was putting in all the efforts to hold his dead weight.
tony looked saddened and Steve didn’t want to look at those eyes any longer and he quickly washed his hand and asked nat to come back inside before hitting the call button and settled down next to Tony holding him as close as possible.
“I love you and I am sorry you are currently angry with me for not telling you about stane sooner" he said wiping away the residual tear stains on his lovers face and for once Tony smiled back and returned the hug.
“What’s that?” he asked
Tony broke the kiss , hugging steve and face buried in Steve’s neck “I love you, don’t leave me"
“Bruce, is everything oka-" before he finished he heard Bruce’s panicked voice on the other end
“But …but there was blood everywhere, he was bleeding a lot just tell me please , is he de..dead?”
“You mean your classmate anna?” he nnodded and it took Steve all of three seconds to realize what happened and he couldn’t help but grin
"hmm?"
"You kill all the fun romanoff"I muttered as she and Bruce left. I wanted until they were gone to look at Steve. He was still leaning against the wall but avoiding looking at me. I stood up leaning against the table, "so…. You are mad at me." I said trying to sound as innocent as possible. Maybe he will forgive me quickly. Steve rarely gets mad, well he gets mad a lot when I dont listen to what he says during a battle. But when it comes to getting mad with me outside of the battlefield, he's not even actually mad. He's always so nice about it. That makes it even harder for me.
“He is quiet the smart alec, I’ll give you that” he said leaning against a pillar beside them and Steve silently agreed, refusing to think about how Clint knew what the two of them were talking about.
“I am not wearing that! Its ugly and it has no back" he huffed and Steve chuckled before throwing it at him anyway.
“I am perfectly fine, no more blood okay? Just lay down for a little while. Close your eyes.” He said his fingers brushing through his hair but Tony wouldn’t have it .
“You ready to go?” he asked tony who was still wilted at the table , natasha looked pointedly at him before getting as well
Steve smiled as he saw Tony jogging over to him , the upper half of his shirt was already soaked through from the rain and he held his bag above his head shielding his hair and face from the pelting rain. It was an hour past school time. Tony had needed to help Bruce with something and Steve figured it was better this way so no students would be there to see them leave together.
Bruce sighed , and they both sat for a few seconds silently before Bruce called natasha again.
Tony immediately shied away from pepper feeling wholly embarrassed about the whole situation.
“Hey" he said “all better now?” he asked as Tony took small careful steps inside the room towards the bed. He stood by the foot of the bed his fingers drumming softly on the bed frame . Steve smiled at what he was seeing, he was dressed in one of Steve’s shirts he often kept in his locker at the gym. It was almost too large on his small frame coming down mid thigh and some standard issue shield pants that were slightly short at his ankles. All in all he looked like a sheepish teenager just woken up from his long long nap.
Tony woke up throughout the night a total of six times. Each time he woke up , he would panic and want to remove all the tubes attached to him and Steve would have to gently hold him still as he fell asleep again.
“so you want me?” Steve sighed , a hesitant smile playing on his lips. of-course that’s the only part tony heard. He placed both his palms on either side of Tony’s face and pulled him in for a kiss. It wasn’t even a real kiss, just a brush of lips and tony gasped as Steve pullled back looking shocked and excited at the same time.
He had his legs tangled with the sheets away from Steve’s own and was currently occupying more than three fourths of the bed lying almost horizontal ,only his torso and face tucked up against Steve.
“It was not your fault , I still feel safe around you. And Steve that scares me even more" Tony admitted his voice small and Steve pulled him into a hug feeling absolutely wretched.
“Steve?” he felt a hand on his shoulder but he shrugged it off , not caring
Bruce and thor followed me down, and thor watched with concern as I took the reactor out and pointed to a box designed to house the reactor which Jarvis had already unlocked for Bruce to pick it up and hand it over to me. He jogged over to the reactor picked up and we switched the ones in our hands. I clicked the new one into place feeling the jolt of the reactor, and thor steadily held on to my arm to stabilize me.
“Here” Steve said trying to hand over the bowl to him but he shook his head
“ I see someone is feeling better” Steve said amused
“That is harassment and good luck talking to my parents since they are dead!” There was brief second where after he said it where tony looked smug at Steve’s shocked and guilty expression before he turned and left the restroom slamming the door behind him.
“Right, what was I thinking" he said and smirked when Tony raised his arms to be picked up again.
“how are you feeling? Still tired?” he asked remembering what Bruce had said to Tony about sleeping but couldn’t bring it up directly because handling tony was an art. You needed to know how to exactly phrase your words or Tony would get defensive and shut down.
“Steve let’s go to the tower"
“so we didn’t have a chance to explain how we are planning to place the new reactor.” He said as he watched steve adjust the sheets around Tony.
“I don’t know but he is here. Look" he said poking a finger at Steve’s arm. Steve smiled at him, holding him closer and looked at bruce “I won’t hurt him Bruce” he said and bruce didn’t nod, he didn’t shake his head . He didn’t give any reaction for that matter as he left the room.
He still didn’t look convinced so Steve added “you will even get an actual note excusing you from gym" and Tony cracked a smile at that.
Natasha walked over to the refrigerator to pull out a water bottle, taking a sip and dropping the bottle on the counter as she eyed them both carefully.
“really?” Steve said his lips tugging in a smile as Tony reached for the wrap and settled by Steve side trying to wiggle himself in between Steve’s arm.
"Jarvis? Has Tony taken any of his pills these two days?"
“He fell asleep as soon as the good nurse helped clean him up but he hasn’t woken since but they told me it was nothing to worry about and that I was never to bring him food again.” The last part was said with a hint of sadness and Steve felt the pity himself. Thor loved sharing his love for midgardian food.
Over the next few days Steve had only two things that kept kept spiralling back to his mind even though he had tried very to distract himself. One, why was Steve so amused by this fifteen year old and two, why had tony flinched. Of the two , Steve decided the more worrisome one was his fascination with tony , that sudden need to obliterate the cause for the flinch. Something had obviously frightened him that day and Steve didn’t like the idea of it. This lead to the first thought again, why was Steve so bothered by this? The cycle went on and on relentlessly in his head. He gave in two days later when he decided that it was okay to keep a subtle eye on the kid, nothing creepy ,just doing his job of making sure his students were okay. Or that’s what he told himself.
“So Tony would have to write stane in, which would mean he had to be good Tony not the other way around" steve said flipping through the other files.
"Where are you?"
“why are you telling me this now?” He had to give Bruce credit, he would have had no idea if he hadn’t just been told that Bruce had been in contact with shield. But he clearly didn’t know that Steve was shield.
“I am okay tony, we are okay” he said slowly, returning the hug.
“I have a nurses note excusing me from gym"
“What’s up rhodes?” he asked as Steve helped straighten his  shirt collar.
“Uhm, don’t we need a helmet?” He asked as Steve revved the bike a little and Tony held on tighter.
“Where are we going?” he asked as Steve gave him the sandwich and water bottle
steve face softened as he looked at Tony’s,like actually looked at him. He had been going through this all alone and Steve was being an ass. This was not the time to be angry, and he hated himself for that being his first reaction. And Tony probably knew him well enough and that’s why he had kept it from him.
“I mean, you hurting Tony that day, was that some sort of influenced need to finish the job?” bruce stood up looking at the three of them wide eyed while steve froze in shock
“right, hold on" he said as he pulled on the pants and let the top sit on his right shoulder and walked out after toweling dry his hair as much as possible. He carried another towel out to dry Tony’s hair as well.
“What?” Steve stared at him in shock
“Hey , sit here come on” he said scooting backwards on his bike to make place for Tony in the front. Tony was still looking a bit like he was going to pass out and Steve didn’t want to force any food or water into him at the moment. Generally parents let their kids sit like that in the front because they were small but Steve figured Tony was more on the petite side and Steve was big enough for Tony to just lean back against him comfortably without getting in the way of Steve’s vision. He was more worried about Tony falling asleep or passing out .
He had been taking Tony out every few days, keeping an eye out for any signs of abuse and Tony was starting to get more comfortable under Steve's scrutinizing eyes. Now he just rolls his eyes at Steve everytime he not so subtly feels around for any injuries Tony could be hiding from him. He would initially resist and try to slap away Steve's wandering hands but slowly give into the touches and then whine when Steve tried to take his hands away.
“ask the monkey to hold still” he said instead and pulling the sheet over his feet again only to have Tony to kick it off immediately.
“kay, I’ll try but can you sit here with me on the bed?’ he asked , and Steve immediately knew he was just milking it cause Tony’s eyes were glinting with excitement
“I won’t force you to do anything,  but I am asking you if you will atleast consider them" Tony looked at him finally and nodded
”I am not going with obie Steve , I want to stay with you. Are you sure you are okay?” Steve frowned again, why didn’t he want to go with stane and he seemed slightly disoriented still, Steve wanted to get him to rest for a while before having any kind of sensible conversation with him.
Turning to fury he said “ you came to me , told me the best place would be under the watchful eyes of captain America. Did it never occur to you that captain america has a dangerous job?”
Steve had wanted nothing more than to wrap his hands around Tony but it seemed like everything had taken a really harsh turn. Steve was exhausted , still in pain.
“He’s too young for heart surgery" steve said as he swung his hand in a left hook and Clint dogged it easily enough.
“I never switched it off” steve could imagine the frown on Tony’s face while he said that
He walked over sitting down and placing his own tray on the table. “hey , you look troubled. Teenagers problems?” Steve asked as Bruce gave him a weary smile.
"Not as many as you would imagine. There was one serious one before the ice. But the rest were more exploratory" Tony's skeptical looks made steve grin
“We cant hand him over to shield.” Steve said settling into one of the seats rubbing the weariness out of his eyes.
I was wondering if I should get peggy back into the picture? Let me know what you guys think and again thanks in advance!
“Steve, don’t go. Please" Tony said his fingers grasping onto the end of his shirt
“I distinctly remember being told by the medical staff that you need to be off the foot" he said pulling Tony away from her to ease the pressure on her leg.
“That's Mr.Rogers to you” Steve tried lightening the mood but tony worried at his lower lip suddenly irritated with Steve
"You okay?" I asked him quiet enough only for him to hear. But am sure both the super spy's heard as well because I noticed them turn their heads ever so slightly towards tony to see his response.
He wasn’t sure how long he had sat there , wrapped in blankets with the heater turned on until a knock on the door startled him. He had been so focused on thinking about the present that he hadn’t even realized what time it was. The dim light outside the window told him it was late afternoon. He wasn’t sure how long he had sat with Tony under the water or how long he had been sitting here.
“Do you want to go hang out with your friends today?” he asked as he watched him type something about some new exhibit.
Steve didn’t say anything, he just stared at him, needing to know if Tony really didn’t know or if he was keeping this from him.
"Bruce you know it's unstable, you saw what it did to my reactor" Tony said as they both walked into the room.
“I really thought that…" Tony gasped slightly catching his breath
“You need to get out of here. Is he good?” Steve still hazy in his mind blinked a couple of times before looking down at Tony’s face, he seemed completely relaxed now the flush almost gone from his face.
“Go to sleep, tomorrow we are going to talk about your insecurities and self preservation instincts.” He said blandly and Tony looked at him expectantly and Steve was fuming internally not understanding what more he wanted him to say
Tony whined a little trying to pull at Steve’s hand but Steve slapped his hand away
“Tasha!” pushing himself upright with steves chest as the support he pushed off the covers so he could hug her but realized midway that he was only clad in his boxers and his dress shirt hanging off his shoulders.
“Steve am sorry. We don’t ever have to sex again if that means you won’t be sad. I know you have been really sad ever since” Tony was going to be the death of him. That much he was sure of.
“is it because I am sixteen and not seventeen like you thought?” Steve eyes widened
“I hate you” He mumbled and Steve choked on his breath when he heard those words
“its out tony, come on calm down for me now" he said holding him close arms still wrapped around him. Steve pulled the covers away and lifted his gown up and spoke quietly to him
Alarmed , he raked his eyes scanning him up and down suddenly angry at his team for bringing him here knowing how dangerous it could be for a civilian.
Okay, so Tony’s joke had gotten a better response than Steve’s as the class laughed as he sat down again , but the laughter had only started after the students realised that Steve hadn’t taken offence and was only amused.
Steve carefully but firmly pushed Tony back so he sitting on the edge of the bed again as he let tony hold onto his arms
“Steve hey you with me?” Tony asked and Steve found it rather stupid because he should be the one taking care of tony right  now and not the other way around.
“Tony, we cant push this off any further” he sighed getting exasperated. “I know, I will tell you I promise. Wait for me today after school?” he asked getting up from his chair leaning over to kiss Steve again.
Thing? There ? Steve knew he was by no means a stranger to sex and he has had his fair share of experience but what the hell was Tony talking about?  Steve didn’t reply , he knew his face looked constipated right now and it was not even funny .
“yeah?”
she nodded tugging on Tony’s legs to straighten them , running her fingers over the pants to make sure he wasn’t hurt anywhere they couldn’t see. “We were told to release him in the care of one Obadiah stane after”
“Yeah" his voice trembled ever so slightly and Clint patted him on his thigh
“Yup, from what I have heard he’s been doing exceptionally well in other subjects as well. Seems like we may finally have one student we can make a difference with. But there is something off about the child, he doesn’t listen in class but yet is so bright I don’t know how to help him.”
"He may be right" tony quipped pulling away "but I assure you it was definitely not me" he made a pouty face at Bruce who just shrugged back.
“ I cant believe you thought this would all it would take for me to hate you” She told him while trying to balance on her uninjured leg trying to make it look like she was fine. But Steve saw right through her little charade
“steve!” was the last thing he heard before he pulled the door closed behind him and entered the biting cold of the morning air.
It had been two days since they had told tony about stane selling weapons under the table. He had taken it surprisingly well , but steve knew by now that Tony hid his emotions very well when required.
“are you really so out of shape or are you milking this?” he asked him sitting next to allowing Tony to cozy up to his side.
“I admit I have been better.” He said smiling again but Tony looked so worried and all Steve wanted to do was hold him close for ever.
“I will be back , in the morning. I’ll ask bruce to stop by, I have no right to tell you what to discuss with him.”
“How is that possible, and how can he frame me? I am not even in the picture and obie wouldn’t do that to me” tony had been in denial for the past half hour and they had repeated it over and over again until he seemed to accept it.
There was a light sting to his cheek , his ears ringing as he suddenly opened his eyes again ,when had they closed? To look at natasha who was now now trying to pry his hands off the sleeping teen.
“That child Is the heir to SI. I hope you know what you are getting yourself into.” He said before Steve gave a single nod and walked away.
“us!” clint said pulling nat with him towards the beds “we have a bet to see whose bag fills up first" clint gleamed as they both sat on their beds leaning against the pillows.
“That’s not something for you to worry about” he replied turning to swipe the wet mop of hair falling against his forehead before dropping a kiss. His lips lingered a moment almost sighing at the comforting heat.
Surprisingly , there were no calls from school or shield . Not just for Steve but also for natasha and Clint  steve suspected that coulson had something to do with it .
“steveeeee” he whined and whimpered like he couldn’t get get comfortable
“Good luck Steve” Phil said as he nodded once and took off towards the docking quinjet.
“No" Tony said
“honey we both know you haven’t,”
"You are right. Let's try something else okay? Come on" steve said after taking a deep breath, extending a hand out for Tony to grasp.
“Steve you need to talk about exactly what happened. It will help keep his mind from having to fill in the blanks with its own thoughts.” Clint said as he kneeled down next to natasha holding a first aid kit which Steve recognized as the shield mandated kit.
“You with me?” He asked as he lowered his head to Tony’s eye level and Tony nodded jerkily finally looking up at the people behind Steve.
Tony tucked his head back against his neck and sighed and Steve turned his head just slightly towards Tony’s ear and said quietly “I am sorry I didn’t realize sooner but we will find a way to help you feel better"
“hey, look at me honey” tony refused to look up and Steve’s heart was racing , he needed to call Natasha and Clint . Have them find out what was going on. They had been so wrong about tony being safe with stane. There was no way Steve was going to let him take tony now.
“somehow I feel I am making it worse for him" he replied sighing as he reached for the water bottle
He unbuckled Tony’s pants , and pulled them off throwing them carefully down onto the floor and his eyes caught sight of the wet patch on his underwear.
“You were kissing pepper yesterday” Words that were meant to stay in his mind left his mouth unfiltered and Steve almost smacked his forehead. What he should have said instead should have been something along the lines of ‘ I am your teacher, you are only sixteen, besides that didn’t mean anything and I was only trying to help‘
“I don’t know what you are talking about," he said and if he sounded a little gleeful then it was hardly his fault.
Tony whined a little but he held back leaning against a desk his hands fidgeting with the hem of his shirt. Steve pointed back to Tony’s chair “sit, we need to talk” he said as he looked at his watch , he had about ten minutes before the bell rang and Tony had to get to physics.
“I know , trust me I am trying to understand your situation. It’s not ideal but let’s face it, there is a lot of work to get done and we can’t afford to have you tied down like this.” She said matter of factly, trust natasha to not sugar coat anything.
Steve had a few more questions, those regarding Howard's will and ofcourse one that's been plaguing his mind was why Tony hadn't told anyone about the abuse. But he figured this was a good start and didnt want to push his luck.
He had been exhausted these past few days, time from Tony had actually given him time to get things done on his end and to get back on track with school work and shield things.
"Oh sweetheart" Steve was aghast. Tony had been wearing the sweatshirt since Steve saw him first in the bar. That was more than an hour ago.
“Shit" clint mumbled and surprisingly thor was the first one to move but the moment thor turned to go Steve held him back, shaking his head
“he saw you in your uniform” she stated
“don’t call me that.”
"steve" I said moving my hand to push his hair out of his face. It was getting longer. But I liked it this way, so I am not going to complain.
"Uhm, excuse me captain, there is a girl named pepper trying to reach you on your phone" Fury gave him a dirty look but Steve ignored him as he got up and walked out of the room suddenly concerned and confused how she got his number and why she was calling.
He wasn’t sure why Tony was defending Stane when he clearly had some role in this abuse. Every time he remembered how stane had walked in yesterday Steve felt the need to shatter something. He kept his hands carefully around Tony, one carding through his hair and the other on his waist, thumb slowly stroking the bare , soft skin. It had a calming effect on him and Steve reveled in that fact and as soon as Steve had pushed him away to patch up his abused hand , the rage had started to kindle again.
“No thank you" his lips pursed like a five year old throwing a tantrum
“will you take the shot now?” and Tony pouted and Steve kissed the pout off his face
“How are you feeling?” he asked as he ran his hands up and down his thighs under the covers and Tony shrugged
“Tony , sweetheart I didn’t mean it like that. You were going through something so I just thought my problems can wait until we have sorted yours out okay?” tony sniffled against him and Steve was not sure if it was from a cold he was catching or from something else but Steve rubbed his palm against his back anyway in a gentle motion.  “in fact , I am feeling so much better now that you are here with me.” He finally dropped a kiss to the brunette hair and Tony hummed against him but Steve knew there was something that Tony had wanted to say but didn’t.
Tony’s little gasp was worth the wait.
Tony on the other hand was still rooted in place, still glaring. At this rate, he is going to give himself a headache, Steve thought sighing and rolled his eyes. They had spoken about telling rhodey and pepper about the situation at Tony’s home. About stane and rumlow and Tony had admitted that he trusted them both enough to clue them in, just in case. And Steve had hundred percent agreed.
Heat , he needed heat.
“You okay?” Steve briefly considered coming clean and telling Bruce everything about Tony’s injury but he remembered how tony had pleaded with him to not tell anyone.
Nat,very sneaky indeed. I grumbled some more before I reached over and stole Bruce's as he gave me mildly irritated look but didn't seem to mind.I ate my muffin in peace and tried to quickly get away from Steve's 'eat your salad!don't make me hold you and force it down'.
"You know Tony, it's not very nice if you don't participate in your own party" I turned towards Bruce who sat down on the stool next to me. He turned to the bartender and said "that's enough for him "and cut me off.
“Its controlled by an energy source that’s not from earth.”
“I want it out!” he screamed suddenly trashing on the bed and as Steve’s hands ran over his legs feeling the tube running along his leg he immediately figured out what had happened.
“you developed a chest infection after swallowing the ocean water yesterday, do you want to sit up?”steve asked as he carded his fingers through Tony’s hair. Tony frowned looking down at himself, the monitors , the dress shirt that was still hanging around his shoulders ,the IV .  He cocked his head away from Steve’s hand in his hair looking at natasha and then at Steve “did you drug me?!” he said as the monitors started beeping a little faster and tony ripped the leads from his chest the anger showing in his eyes.
“Not here,” he whined but Steve didn’t give in and quickly unbuttoned his pants and used one hand to lift his butt up so he could slide his pants down.
“tony , you stay where you are" he said because he didn’t know if Tony would take it as a joke or not.
Tony was dressed in one of Steve’s shirt he knew came from his locker at the gym and a pair of shields standard issue pants that were bunched up at his ankles sweeping the floor.
He got up pulling the blanket with him as he smashed his lips against Steve’s surprised ones pulling away only when he needed the air
“I love you sweetheart, happy birthday” he said softly before kissing him, long and soft and gentle. Steve released him , and tony smiled widely at him and wrapped his arms around his neck , giving him a good hug “thank you" he said genuinely and Steve couldn’t resist kissing him again.
“listen to me Tony, this infatuation you have with me is not real, it’s just a phase. You deserve better , you deserve a lot more than this" he said waving at Tony’s bruised body.
After a long conversation of backstories , Steve caught them up on who Bucky was to him . The whole time, Bucky seemed to be battling an inner battle within himself like he was fighting an unseen force that was tampering with his head. They had him chained and his hands and feet bound to a solid rebar on the quinjet.
“I need another shirt" he said pulling on the fabric holding it away from his body. Steve groaned when he realized there was pasta sauce in his hair as well.
Tony was now struggling to breathe and Steve pulled Tony’s back against his own chest and bent down to bring his lips to his ear
“He’s taking a shower" he said sighing as he wiped his hands on a towel before going back in to his closet to change his shirt.
But when steve saw the teen, the concern and worry only increased. He was sat between his two friends the side of his head resting on his wrist which was propped up on the table with his elbow. He looked even more tired and worn out than he did yesterday his eyes lazily looking into his phone as rhodey and pepper spoke over him to each other.
“Same holds good for almost seventeen year olds” Tony’s face fell for the second time that day and Steve’s hand reached up involuntarily to brush a thumb across the saddened cheeks , but he midway changed the motion to straighten the collar on Tony’s shirt.
“How have your classes been going Bruce?” he smiled “same old, same old. Although there is this new kid , Anthony . Quiet the genius if I may say so.”
Steve walked over picking up their food with an amused smile and sat himself down against the headboard next to Tony’s head.
Steve was now genuinely concerned for his health as he sat down again feeling Tony’s forehead for a fever.
“I need a break from myself” he corrected and Tony nodded still apprehensive.
Generally he would never spend this kind of money on something like shoes but this was not for him, he was going to take Tony for a jog tonight and he wanted to give him some motivation.  He hoped the neon colors were the right choice. The next thing he did buy oddly enough were two pairs of briefs, again not for him but for Tony. He needed some support in that area area after what happened today. Atleast for two days. The shopkeeper looked at him funny when he asked for briefs for a sixteen year old because apparently sixteen year olds do their own underwear shopping and he looked at him even weirder when Steve made some odd choices of pink and green ones. I mean he just thought Tony would look good in them , the shopkeeper didn’t have to know that though. So he quickly bought his things and headed for the tower. It was already dark out and if he was going to be making Tony jog then he better get there sooner. He was really hoping to try Buckys advice and wear the teen out.
“Clint , did they send back the quinjet?” natasha asked and he shook his head while both thor and Clint cleared the bed so they could lay Tony down.
Off all the things Steve thought he would be experiencing emotionally in that second, he never thought fear would be one of them. A sense of cold washed over him as he realized that he was indeed much bigger than Tony, literally in size and strength and if he has one second of lapse in control he could hurt tony beyond repair.
“Steve, don’t do this to yourself” Natasha said as she closed the door behind her softly unlike Steve who had just slammed it.
“I need you to drink some water for me” he said , and natasha bought the bottle up to his lips giving it a little nudge until they parted and tipped the bottle up letting a few drops through.
Tony’s fear often showed as anger, anger that he hadn’t yet learnt how to project so it often seemed like a stubborn childish mannerism and he knew very well where today’s fear was coming from.
“I told you this would happen!” he screamed the moment steve walked in.
“Tony, come on” he said rolling him back to face Steve and tony squinted his eyes looking at Steve and he smiled down at him waiting for recognition to hit. He yawned and stretched as much as possible on the couch and ended up elbowing Steve in the knees .
“Stop trying to make me sleep, I am not a child” steve sighed giving up as he pulled them upright, with tony resisting.
“Ok I’ll see you guys in the morning she said” before hugging Steve a moment too long like she was just taking in the fact that he was alive and Steve wasn’t ashamed to say that he clung to her for just as long.
“will you believe me if I showed you?” Tony nodded eyes wide and expectant.
“Why don’t you take a nap and then we can take a walk" he asked as brushed his fingers through Tony’s hair ,but Tony was not having it.
“Spies don’t knock”, natasha said and everyone watched Tony’s expression change from blushing to eyes bulging with excitement
“so uhm" tony started as he brought his mug down , and sidled a little closer to Steve, “we found out why I was not feeling too great these past few weeks" he cleared his throat and Steve stiffened next him as tony chanced a peek at his face
“You are supposed to be dead” Steve’s eyes snapped back to Tony’s, the expresssion he caught on Tony’s face was nothing short of wonder and disbelief.
“Tasha says my fever ridden body might just be the perfect body warmer for you right now" he said quietly pursing his lips and Steve smirked at him
“Are you okay?” he asked as he took a few steps towards the window because he suddenly felt like he needed to make sure there was no threat waiting outside.
now you want to play basketball?” tony rolled his eyes at him picking at his pizza
"well, looks like someone's had too much to drink!"clint said, always ,always interrupting these little moments.
“trust me, he knew.” She said with some amount of confidence that it did make Steve feel better.
He pulled the blanket down from around my shoulder letting it drop in my lap. I sighed knowing what was coming. I hated this. I was a genius for god's sake! A genius with a needle phobia! It brought too many memories of Afghanistan. I had hated anything to do with a hospital after the traumatic event of people cutting into my chest while i was wide awake.
that was something Steve had not considered even, that tony had seen the weak side of him. To everyone , even tony captain America would be this hero and Tony had witnessed the fall of the captain and that would have jarred him.
He took a deep breath, shook his head to clear his mind “okay pepper you did a good thing by telling me” he said trying to calm her down as he followed her quick steps to the men’s room. His heart dropped ,however, when his eyes fell on the brunette.
“Hear me out first okay?” tony reluctantly nodded
“what time did I sleep?” he asked all the heat from his anger of sedating him gone
“What?” he asked his fingers restless around the screwdriver he was holding. Natasha gently placed all the items on the counter and came up next to Steve who had Tony trapped in his arms.
He flipped Tony around so that he was lying facedown on Steve’s lap and Steve pulled the briefs higher to check more closely.
“I like that it’s a part of you" and Tony smiled dopily “it’s beautiful Tony, like you are, and it reflects just what you are capable of”
“how are you okay? You were not okay” he mumbled to himself like he was trying to figure out something
“we won’t do anything you don’t want to do, just enough to help you okay? Please baby , let me help” he tried again but this time Tony physically pushed his hands away
“but the timing of it Steve, if it doesn’t work out you can't walk out, it will do him more harm than good” steve pursed his lips at clint wondering when he became the smart one.
“Is he coming in here or?” Steve asked as he unconsciously tightened his told on the teen currently passed out on his chest.
“I don’t know, maybe" he turned to steve “what’s going on stevie?”
“I don’t want to be here” he whined
“I just came back from a mission and found him sitting here staring at the food" Clint said pointing to the plate of untouched food.
“Okay that’s fine, can you tell me what happened?” he asked as he gently reached for Tony’s ha d again and Tony didn’t pull away this time but actually held on tighter.
“How?” he himself had not known for a long while , bisexuality was not condoned in the forties but once he got a fresh start, steve didn’t plan to let that window slide. His family now, clint , natasha , thor and a few others had been so good to him that he often forgot how hard it was in the forties.
“oh thank god!” he heard her exclaim “ Rhodey he’s on the line!” he heard her say away from the phone
“calm down cap, it’s just a paint gun a very accurate ,very cool paint gun" he said watching Tony’s smile get larger. Steve shook his head at the two of them trying to piece back the small piece of ceramic that cracked under his fingers.
“I graded one of his papers just now, and I have to say that boy can go places.”
They had changed him out of Steve’s clothes and put him in a hospital gown, he looked small in the big bed with an IV attached to his hand.
Tony was blushing so hard now, Steve could see the red travelling down along his neck and disappearing  beneath his open collar and Steve wanted to chuckle so badly at what Tony had just admitted but he kept his face straight seeing as how much this was seeming to trouble him.
“Better?” Steve asked his own heartbeat finally slowing enough to focusing on other things like the awkward way Tony was listing.
“you look like you are about to keel over tony, have you taken your meds?”
“you hear things, their death is still on the news, magazines, everybody knows. When I read it , the way they were found in the car.” His voice was barely above a whisper when he then said “it wasn’t hard to put two and two together"
"tony? babe, I need you tell me what's wrong" again with the slapping
"If I don't hear a proper excuse and apology from the both of you then detention will be the best thing you are facing today" he stated firmly. Steve could be very scary if he intended to and he knew that. It's sort of what kept his students in line and the fact that he hardly behaved strict with them is what made him popular among the students. He would like to keep it that way though, but these kinds of incidents seemed to bring out the worst in him.
“Fine but only you no natasha" that would do as long as he was talking. “can we go to your place today after school?”
He walked tony into the bathroom and hesitated at the door not sure if Tony would want him there or not and as predicted Tony shooed him out closing the door behind him.
“it’s okay , you are okay” he murmured as he held the bottle in one hand Tony with the other.
“Yeah, just a sec" he said reaching for something inside his bag and pulled out the dog tags and slipped them on.
“No I just need you here with me right now" he said or more like pleaded and Steve frowned as he rubbed his palm on Tony’s back
Tony looked at him then looked to the side again and sighed
“there we go, you are doing so good. Keep that up, you are going to be just fine" Steve uttered nonsense for the next two minutes that it took for Tony to finally regulate his breathing enough to start matching Steve’s.
“you miss him?” steve didn’t want to know the answer to that but he knew he needed to hear it. He cannot control what Tony wants and he should have known better than to take charge of it. Tony looked at him silently not giving any indication of an answer and Steve understood.
“Mr. Roger’s! I need to speak with you immediately” he heard the panicked voice of rhodey on the other side and he quickly opened the door and pepper and rhodey rushed in.
“Tony , I need you to promise something to me.”  Tony looked at him quizzically trying to figure what had shaken him so much all of a sudden.
"Okay listen to me Ms.Potts, I want all three of you there waiting for me when I get there. I don't want any of you drinking anymore and eat something if possible. I will be there in twenty. Understand?" He barked out allowing the anger the show through.
“Anthony Edward stark. Ring any bells?’
“I need to break a few punching bags” he said but didn’,t make a move to leave.
“What?” he snapped his finger itching to break something
“I found Tony and his two close friends pepper and Rhodey at the back of the compound while I was looking for some samples to show the kids under the microscope, during the third period.”
“I think I am jealous of Tony’s book” apparantly bruce didn’t thinking was as funny as he thought it was
“looks like you are the one that needs the hall pass to the nurse huh Mr. Rogers?” he said pulling out the slip from last week and handing it over to Steve.
______________________________________________________
From the past few months Steve had learnt that Tony was touch starved, but he was also very hesitant to accept it from just anybody. He had been reluctant with Steve as well in the beginning but he had learnt that it takes a little bit of coaxing on Steve’s part and once he accepts it , tony will milk the most out of it shamelessly and Steve loved that part of it.
“don’t Lock it" he said walking away to remove the mousse from the bag.
He took his bike keys heading out of the tower , school was an extra twenty minute ride but he didn’t mind. Once he got to school , he was disappointed that Tony wasn’t in his morning class. He was distracted throughout the whole class unable to focus.
“let me take you home” he insisted and this time tony moved away from him
“I will feel even better if I get a few kisses" tony didn’t even hesitate,  he pushed his bony elbows against Steve’s solid chest and planted his lips against his for good measure. The warmth soaking straight through Steve’s brain.
“you didn’t stay yesterday either when I asked you” he stated
“we will be just fine" he pressed his smiling lips to Tony’s one last time before picking him up off the counter and just as he turned , the towel around Tony’s waist caught onto the counter pulling away from the both of them and Tony blushed pressing his face against Steve’s neck before Steve even realized what had happened.
“Is he okay? Where is he now?”
this always happens, steve is used to it. He doesn’t care for it  but somehow today he just took it. He wanted the distraction, any distraction for that matter that would keep his eyes from wandering over to Tony who also sat in the same cafeteria , nose into a book while pepper and rhodey talked over him.
“You probably have heard of us, black widow and hawk-“
“What is it, are you okay??” he asked immediately trying to turn Tony’s face towards him so he could see but Tony was blushing , he was red all over and the last time he had looked this embarrassed and oh!
Steve rubbed his hand over his face taking deep breaths
Tony relaxed slightly and he smiled against Steve’s lips as he leaned forward again “tomorrow, I promise I’ll tell you tomorrow” he said
“Yeah, he’s okay. Steve you need medical?” she asked still fiddling with the chains.
he jumped, startled as the door opened moving closer to Steve. When they reached for him, he shrugged off their hands “ no touching” he insisted leaving everyone to frown
“okay , but I thought we agreed it was safer for him to be..” she trailed off noticing Tony’s silence through the new conversation and frowned at him. Something was wrong and it had to do with Tony.
“Oww! Widow don’t be a bitch" that snapped him right out of his thoughts as he stalked out of the kitchen
“you a-are so big!” he gasped momentarily forgetting about his own predicament.
“Three weeks?” he asked biting his lower lip
She reached out and put her hand on his “maybe that’s what he needs steve,” she said softly and Steve knew that she was right but he just couldn’t.
“Good, come here ,I have waited long enough" he said noticing how fast his own voice dropped pitch with pure need.
Steve with Natasha’s help got them both settled into the bed again, but Tony flinched when natasha tried to get the nasal cannula back on him.
“Which bar are you at?” he asked as he turned back to an agent asking for some car keys.
Eyes swollen,  puffy like he has been crying for days. He looked thinner or maybe it was the shirt he was wearing that was too large. His fingers were trembling as they hovered above Steve’s chest.
Steve decided that maybe he needed a change in scenario and what better way to do so by taking the kids to the museum of natural history. The students were not that young but it would be nice to see how they appreciate the information at this age.
"but tony" Bruce started but I cut him off. pointing to the reactor and hopping off the jet to get to my lab as quickly as possible.
Thanks in advance! :)
“She’s scary”
“ Hey. I am Tony. I am originally from here but was in boarding school up until last year. I am looking forward to enjoying the remainder of my schooling here” he said flashing his teeth and sat back down after a few cheers of “welcome Tony!” “oh man you have so come to wrong place then!” Steve just shook his head and turned the page in his book.
Just as he made his way back to the Medbay he was stopped by none other than the man in charge “ I told you to stay away from him, what am I going to tell stane?” Steve rolled his eyes at him, barely caring.
"Obie is very verbal but he has never actually hurt me" steve took several deep breaths while nosing Tony's hair.
“Nggg ah! Steve!” he felt Tony’s whole body shudder and arch forward  as he squeezed a nipple between two fingers and rubbed a thumb over the tip.
He took exaggerated breaths and Tony slowly picked up on it trying to match his breaths to Steve’s.
“Eat, growing boys need food"
“just like a bandage" he said gently like he was coaxing a toddler to take medicine.
“I never said that, I wouldn’t have said that” he mumbled and now Steve knew it was real. He took several deep breaths to carefully contemplate how to handle this. He had expected it and yet it was still just as shocking and jarring.
Tony yawned as he snuggled closer to his aunt and Steve almost wished it was him un her place , instead he said “Tony  ,I spoke to your doctor.”
“only geniuses can understand”Steve rolled his eyes at him running his fingers through Tony’s hair.
"Hmm?"
“It has been busy, I finally applied for the grant on my radiation study and currently waiting for it to go through” he said fixing his glasses and asking for his own schedule.
“Good to know.” Tony nodded tucking his hands between Steve’s and his chest. Steve felt his forehead, his skin still worryingly hot to the touch.
"I can help you with this sweetheart, will you let me?" It took tony a second to understand what steve was implying and the moment he did he shook his head violently and Steve backed away a step.
Steve's POV
“-eve" steve head shot up to meet Tony’s at the sudden fear and tremble in his voice and they both stood up quickly hands hovering waiting to help
It made steve want to kiss him senseless.
“I have some friends willing to help me monitor them, I am sure we will be able to handle it if you can okay this for me” the principal did not look too happy with Steve today ,normally he was always very pro anything with Steve because he knows Steve’s secret and nobody denied captain America anything.
“there’s the genius” Steve nodded kissing the boys head again.
“He needs to have a Foley’s inserted and an IV line” steve told her and she she made an “ah" sound looking down at Tony who was avoiding both their gazes.
"Tony.." I waited patiently for the five seconds it took for him to actually look up, I ran my hand through his messy hair, and let my thumb stroke his ear trying to calm him down.
"Good morning sir, Captain rogers has asked me to remind you of your morning iron pills, If you turn to your left you will find them on the nightstand." Oh joy!
Tony’s baby pink shorts were thankfully not harmed and Steve’s ears burned at the thought and he quickly grabbed hand towels from the kitchen giving one to Clint and using the other to clean Tony up as much as possible .
“Uhm she also mentioned that my fever ridden body might be the best thing for you right now" steve grinned, motioning for Tony to come to him.
"Although he does seem more coherent now" Clint said. "He's probably just tired like he said"
"Who the fuck do you think you are!" Steve jolted at the voice his head snapping up to see the commotion happening in his class. He shouldn't have been surprised that one of the parties involved was Tony and the other was ofcourse the other bratty kid Ty stone. Pepper was trying to pry Tony away from the other kid who only looked smug and Steve wanted to knock him in the head. To be honest steve never liked that kid, he was snobbish and bratty and caused unnecessary trouble.
His mind was hazing over with lust and the glimpse he had got of Tony’s tiny little puckered hole this morning was becoming a constant reminder in his mind pushing everything else to the back.
“Yeah, but he said I have to find what works for me" he grumbled clearly not satisfied
“I know , it won’t happen-" and now Steve was smirking . Rhodey was so confidently giving false promises and pepper was frantically nodding her head beside him neither one of then aware of Tony’s silent laughter behind them.
“You doing okay?” Steve asked once they were out of the room and Steve had carefully slid the door shut behind them .
“I am going to give him a sedative, nothing too strong , just to pacify him" he said as he uncapped the the IV port. Either tony didn’t hear him or he was okay with it because he didn’t even seem to care.
“It doesn’t hurt , its fine" he said stubbornly now thumbing Steve’s hand on his arm nervously
“to my place” he said casually as he watched tony almost choke on his sandwich and Steve slowed down so he could drink some soda.
“I promise you Tony,  that everything is going to be okay.”
“once, he tried but nothing-“ Steve had stood up and was out the door before tony finished that sentence “-happened”
Steve dropped a kiss to his forehead before carefully easing out to change into the clothes  natasha had brought them all from the tower this morning. His hand was mostly healed, just a little sore.
“It’s three am” tony said as he eyed the spoon that came towards him.
They sat in silence , steve relishing the heat emanating from the body next to him. He kept a firm grip on the teen,  tony returning the child with a tight grip on his shirt.
“okay, Tony. Just let me have one look make sure you are okay and we can pretend this never happened”
“Why didn’t you wake me up?” Steve asked him and Tony shrugged
“Yeah?” he muttered as he took in his surrounding, he must have also fallen asleep because the last thing he remembered was Tony holding his hand hostage before falling asleep.
“That’s all I ask" he said and dropped a kiss to his hair. His hair , which steve was realizing was sweaty and sticky and he needed a bath.
A lack of response was normal , during battle , the avenger in question usually would reply immediately once able. But the concern was only growing as the gurgling Sound turned to a choking sound.
well that is until Tony doesn’t actually do anything about it or if something happens to the kid Steve would step-in in a heartbeat no matter what it does to their relationship.  Because making sure Tony was alright was number one priority.
He was quickly becoming hysterical his lips turning pale and Steve shifted his hold on Tony such that they could see each other .
“Tell me what happened"
He looked some what better than yesterday though , Steve kissed his temple and sighed getting up from kneeling on the floor. Tony watched him silently as Steve dragged a nearby chair plopped down next to him Watching him wearily.
He pulled his legs away from her wandering hands like the touch burned him “I am not going with obie, I want to stay here with you”
Steve’s thoughts could not have been more organized as he woke the following morning . He had slept in his own bed after four days  of staying at shield and alternating between laying down on Tony’s hospital bed and the extra beds they had set up there.
“Twenty minutes max" he heard before the line clicked but Steve knew all he needed to get back on line was to use his comm link in his wallet.
“No! Don’t leave me” he said rushed and panicked
I sat down next to Tony on the other side and Bruce settled on the edge of the coffee table in front of Tony.
“Steve … you have to understand that one clause we made with obadiah is that he doesn’t know any of this and that includes anything about the real you.” Natasha said gauging his reaction .
“no I don’t, and I don’t need meds because I am not in pain” Steve sighed , giving in for the moment and dropped the sandwich and soda on Tony’s lap.
“Steve" Tony all but whimpered his feet kicking the air helplessly. He knew Bucky was somehow enhanced just like him, so he knew one wrong move on his part and he could snap Tony’s neck in a second.
“it fucking hurt to pee for so long and I haven’t ever since tried to…”
But that didn't mean I was ready for it. It's not fair that I am anemic. He was Iron man for god'sake! Nat had given me the "I will not hesitate to prick you with no foreseen warning!" I knew she was capable after she had once given him a shot when he had palladium poisoning.
“You …I..just" he was blushing now and Steve rearranged them so Tony was now seated sideways along the length of the bed and he moved forward till Tony was tucked into his chest his heading resting against his shoulder
“I told you already, because nat told me you and Bucky were close before the well ….ice"
“who’s there?” tony slurred turning to look and he almost threw himself out of the bed trying to get to his friends. Steve caught the genius in time to keep him from toppling off the bed.
“Bucky, its Steve.  You need to look at me . It’s me,  its stevie. Remember the days you held my hand while ma made hot soup ? You said it was because you didn’t want me catch pneumonia from the cold. Bucky please, look at me" he said now desperate and finally , though agonizing slowly he turned and locked eyes with Steve.
“Hey stop with the joking , I am trying to have a serious conversation here" he turned himself on the chair facing Tony his salad forgotten
”what is it?” he asked hands fisting the cloth in his hands
He quickly dried off , reached for his phone and called up nat who had promised him that Tony was in good hands but refused to tell him who.
"Okay, I am ready let's go! Happy is already waiting for us with the car. Are Clint and Tasha coming with us or are they driving on their own?" He said walking in dressed dashingly as always finally back with his usual finesse. I couldn't help stop for a moment and take him in. Tony stark in all his glory, and he was all mine. I grabbed his hand as he walked towards me and put my other arm around his waist pulling him in for a kiss. God how I loved this man. "Mm do you have any idea how much I love you?" I said nipping at his lip. I felt him relax in my hold as he melted against me sighing, our foreheads touching.
“Okay, let’s do that” Steve said knowing it was not necessary but if it helped Tony feel better then It was fine.
“or he is already in trouble and needs someone to frame and who better than his trusting godson whose company it is anyway?” natasha finished and Steve’s heart did a flip as he realized how easily Tony’s life would be ruined even before it actually started.
What steve didn't know was what the circular opacity was in the center of the sternum , just at the location of the heart.
"Steve"
She sighed sitting down again “Tony , how far did it go? Has it only been physical or something sexual…” she cut her self off again not knowing how to finish that question but Tony was the calm one this time.
Most likely Tony wouldn’t be going home today, but Steve didn’t want to make any promises to Tony right now . He was not sure how he would take it in his exhausted state of mind. Natasha would have already have a team of agents working on figuring out what was going on. Steve trusted her with it, and he has to first make sure that Tony is alright first.
“nothing”
By the time Steve made it down both natasha and Tony were very seriously working together , natasha holding a bunch of things Tony no doubt had taken out from the oven and Tony had his head inside the machine.
“You have already seen it all before Tony, there’s nothing new here" he told him pulling at Tony’s drawstrings to get them open and pulled the pants down to his ankles. Tony fought him every step of the way until the pants finally tugged free of his ankles.
“did that feel okay?” he asked as Tony pulled his legs together and closer to his chest and then said monosyllablly “good" his voice was hoarse and Steve reached for the water bottle he had on his nightstand and handed it to him. He took a small sip before closing it and throwing it onto the other side of the bed.
He realized the mistake he made when his eyes landed on the tiny little puckered hole and the reaction was immediate as he felt himself hardening.
“No, no I am very glad. Just…you know what? I am really happy. Come here.” He said grinning as he pulled Tony towards him letting him sit on his lap.
“Yes"
“Tony, we need to talk about what happened yesterday.” He said and Tony’s face immediately fell like he actually hadn’t been expecting an explanation from steve and that seemed to confuse him even more.
“Its psychology 101” he said shrugging  and .natsha pursed her lips shrugging her shoulders.
“Still feverish, he doesn’t know he is sick and he remembers everything from last night” the last part took her by surprise
"it's fine j, do your thing!" I nodded and as the mechanical arms grabbed at my gauntlets. Bruce and thor was still looking at me concerned "man of iron, do you need the medical facilities?"
“but that’s exactly what you are doing” that made him turn his back surprised that tony had raised his voice. He looked back once to make sure no one was lingering in the hallway. “you are hurting me by letting me go”
So Steve chose this time around to make a difference by teaching, educating the young minds who would be the future. As captain America Steve has had a lot of experience with children and has also learnt patience. He thoroughly enjoyed his day job . Shield had made sure to keep his identity a secret, everyone knew captain America but no one knew Steve Rogers and that worked out great. He had to occasionally go help out in the superhero fashion, when things came down to it but it kept him sane knowing he could do both at the same time.
“Steve?” he was so surprised to hear Tony’s immediate response that he ended up pulling the little device out the voice in his ear jarring him.
“Hey there”
“I’ll answer all your questions once we make sure you are okay.” He said carding his fingers through Tony’s hair again.
Tony sighed “hmph" nosing Steve’s torso and then he pushed himself up , the covers falling from his shoulders and pooling around his waist. He squinted at Steve through the light.
“You are not fine, you passed out yesterday Tony! How long have you both known? Why was I not told?” he voice raised and Tony flinched ever so lightly.
Steve kissed the small frown on Tony's forehead and resumed brushing his fingers through Tony's hair feeling Tony sigh and relax completely.
(See the end of the chapter for
It seemed to take him a moment to focus and Steve explained to him that it was Natasha ata the door. He stiffened immediately when Steve yelled for her to come in.
So that left him in the here and now with natasha and Clint who had sat with him stubbornly even when Steve had told then it’s okay for them to go do their things. Two hours in, clint had picked up rhodey and pepper from school because they wanted to be there.
“I won’t tell if you won’t” he said as he smiled watching Tony eagerly pull the lid off of the cup so he can dig in.
“there was just a complete shutdown of shield’s systems. We were hacked.”
“I’ll tell you what, if you will allow me to,  I will show you how good it can be” he said lowering his voice and reaching for Tony's shirts top button.
“I am just thinking, what if rumlow and stane are after SI , that makes sense right? If you think about it, Tony would have been the direct heir to SI after Howard and Maria died. It would explain why stane saved him and why he’s been looking after him. Why he is trying to keep him away from us.”  Clint explained rubbing his chin with his fingers
“but why and how did stane get his hands on the tape?” tony raised a hand that was holding the spoon and  waved it around before saying
“if I ever hurt you in any way physically and don’t realize it because of my strength I want you to promise me that you will let me know” hurt and fear flashed through Tony’s face as he gripped Steve’s hands tightly
“you haven’t been sleeping lately" steve said, not asked allowing no room for Tony to deny.
Steve didn’t make a move to follow Tony as he walked through the foyer and Tony turned back waving him over to follow him
”I am not so sure you can handle a bike ride at the moment” he said and tony frowned at him after they were seated and buckled in.
"Tony"
"He went to bring you a change of clothes from your room." Okay, but why couldn't he just go up to his room and change there? And then sleep on his own bed?
Tony was blushing, he was red all the way down to his chest. It was adorable and Steve wanted to kiss every part of him. He pulled away, as tony sat shy all of a sudden as Steve pulled the blanket over the teen and guided him to lay down.
“is this why you brought me here, to get my out of my clothes?” He said voice steely, fingers fidgeting and Steve reeled back taking his hands away from the teen.
“Go back to sleep Tony” tony ignored him and stretched as much as he was able to , and turned to look at bruce.
“You and me Tony, just the two of us in the room honey.” He ran his fingers tips across Tony’s chest and and repeated the pattern again and again giving Tony something to familiarize on.
“Okay, where is the jet?” he asked as he fished out a toothbrush and some fancy looking paste and soap.
“Can I see your neck?”
Steve didn’t have much food that would be appealing to a teenager. It was mostly healthy food the least of them being a bag of baked chips. So he grabbed that, and made them both a wrap stuffed with whatever veggies Steve could find.
He didn’t expect the anger and rage to show through on her face, she was usually very much in control but it was honestly very comforting to know that Natasha was on his side.
“yeah , I will go take a shower . How about you get us something to eat?” he asked pointing to the little menu card that was lying nearby the telephone. Tony nodded
There was one more thing Steve needed to talk to bruce about, more as a friend than anything . He caught him just as they were about to leave “bruce” he placed a hand on his sleeve and Bruce slowed down and sat down on the table knowing Steve needed something from him.
“You need to sleep, come on “ Steve said picking up the blanket and the water bottle that was discarded now on the floor.
“its cold, don’t go” Tony said making grabby hands at him and Steve gave him a few more minutes to cling to him before he really had to leave.
“Good?” he asked as he raised himself up higher onto the bed closer to Tony’s face and then pulled them both upright.
Tony always had walls up, always getting into trouble for arguing with teachers or everyone, he was defensive and displayed a don’t care attitude. But today , Steve had seen it crumble, and tony was nothing what he thought he would be when stripped off the mask.
“I love you , you are not an asshole and I don’t appreciate you calling yourself that and I don’t regret any of it" steve didn’t reply , because he didn’t agree with Tony.
A few minutes and Tony calmed down fully and Steve slowly entangled from him , shaking tony awake
"Fucking use your goddamn-" tony was screaming at him not even caring that the teacher was still in the room. Steve walked up quickly shoving an arm between them.
“Tony, you with me?” he asked firmly holding his chin so Tony would look at him.
“Tony, what’s going on baby?” he said when he finally felt his own erection settle enough for Steve to reach out and pull Tony to him and he came with burying his face in his chest and held him tight.
The first time they had done this, Steve had been so worried and emotionally wrecked he had not actually concentrated on what he had been doing. This time he really wanted to show Tony how good it can be. He was all too aware of his mind telling him not to do it all but when Tony begged like that there wasn’t much Steve could do but give him what he wants and really, it was Steve’s fault Tony was even in this state of needing to plead.
“It gives you better access, see I am being good” he said waving an arm at himself and Steve just rolled his eyes as he carefully peeled the wrap open. Tony watched silently as Steve pulled it apart. It was clear that he was nervous about something but Steve didn’t comment on it.
"Fine." He huffed not looking at him and Steve ran a hand through Tony's hair and gave him another kiss.
“Why the hell did you bring Tony here?” second things second. He glared at both of them but all he got were concerned looks.
“he comes home a lot, and there are a lot of parties and launches . Rumlow and obie are best friends” he said , he sounded small hiding in Steve’s arms.
He had a little while before the doctor would come in to check on him and Bruce too. He didn’t know if Tony had spoken to bruce yet but it didn’t matter Steve had decided last night.
“I don’t want you to" he said looking down .
Steve felt the pain before he realized what was happening to him.
“Can you give us a minute? And close the door behind you” he asked the nurse who nodded sympathetically at them ,
“three glasses at the most “ he said his sweaty hands grasping tightly at the sides of the chair.
"That's for desert, I want pizza" be said patting the pocket where he had kept the chocolate.
“My head hurts , and I am soooo tired” Tony grumbled
“I don’t want him to know about this, until we can confirm it" he was surprised that it came out as a command , the time making him realize that he indeed needed to step up and take lead.
“ I was enjoying my life with you" Tony said his voice firm not wavering and Steve gave him a small smile
Steve cocked his head to the side, unsure where this was going as he waited patiently for him to explain “I liked it when you called me sweetheart” he mumbled, this was the softest tone he had heard tony speak in so far and it tugged at Steve’s heart.
suddenly Natasha stiffened just a smidge and before he could trace her eyes to look at what she was seeing, she leaned in , kissed him softly and whispered in his ear “twelve o clock”
I felt Steve squeezing my shoulder to let me know he's off to meet some people. I nodded at him and watched him disappear. Seeing pepper at the bar I called out to her and headed towards her.
Steve's POV
“That doesn’t make me feel any better , come on. What’s the harm huh? Besides do you really want me to be losing focus on a dangerous mission?” that did the trick , but now Steve realized he had just made a mistake.
“No!” Tony said again but there was slight hesitation before he said it.
He was still covered in grease from last night and when Tony noticed what he was wearing he blushed red tucking into steve side “why am I not wearing any pants? What did you do to me?”
“Bucky, let go of him. Hey Bucky look at me come pn" he said his voice trembling as Tony started wheezing . But Bucky didn’t even glance at Steve his focus solely on the struggling boy.
You could see Tony visibly relax as nat picked up “this better be important Steve, or I swear to-"
Tony’s eyes drifted and seemed fixated on something on Steve’s arm and when Steve looked down he saw a red angry mark from the battle and Tony thumbed at it the skin blanching under his touch .
“Did someone throw up in here?” Clint asked his nose scrunching up
“I promise I am not mad, I know it’s scary. Believe me , I really do. But I need to go now and when I am back , you and me are going to sit down and figure out how we can make this better for the both of us okay?” tony just wrapped his arms around Steve hugging him tightly for an entire minute before he let go.
“Do you think it’s possible Stanr ordered the killing of howard and maria?” he asked natasha and when he said it, the recognition took on her face too and she pulled out her phone bring up a picture of stane and showed it to Bucky.
“Its fine, I am fine"
"Mr. Stark! What can you reveal about the new SI upgrade?" and so began the evening of paparazzi and drinks. I just wanted tony to have a little fun tonight.
“How long?” Steve asked suddenly realizing that Tony had been wearing the sweatshirt since the bar and his stiff walking. Tony was still avoiding Steve's gaze and Clint got up from the floor leaving the room silently along with the rest of them pulling the door closed softly behind him.
“I need you to sit down with me and nat and answer a few questions for us" tony was shaking his even before Steve was done talking
Tony shuffled around a little while before giving up and finally opening his eyes. He found steve immediately and Steve didn’t dare open his mouth unsure of exactly what Tony needed him to say.
I walked into the kitchen, Bruce and Steve were sitting at the table opposite each other, talking. Natasha was talking on her phone and toasting bread simultaneously. I sauntered over and sat down on the chair adjacent to Steve. Bruce had a plate full of food eating, I was right on time for lunch. They all looked up at me, steve smiled at me sweetly.
“He has a certain charm about him" steve said shrugging and they all just silently agreed sipping their coffees.
“children" Steve said faking exasperation and rolling his eyes as he rubbed the area he had injected with his thumb. He dragged Tony back into lying down again as he gently carded his fingers through his hair.
“Steve get over it, you had a momentary lapse . Happens to everyone” Clint said breaking his train of thought handing over some fries that Steve found too greasy for his liking.
“Steve, what’s going on? Why is this kid from school all of a sudden so important to you?” Natasha said, and that was just it Steve didn’t know why.
He sat down on the floor at Tony’s feet Indian style and reached out to grasp Tony’s thighs and just dropped his face into his legs . Because he really didn’t know what to do at the moment and his shoulders relaxed as he felt Tony’s hand sink into his dirty hair and grasp onto the roots ,not tight but just enough to let him feel something.
Tony’s face emerged from under the covers neck craning to see what Steve had and grimaced.
“what can I do to help?”
He secured the tube to his thigh with tape. Before he could pull his gown back down tony gasped
“ Steve, slow down. “ Natasha said as he gulped his morning coffee in one go
He whined but let me go snuggling into the pillows. Why was Steve still asleep? It's rare that I am ever awake before he is.
Steve counted to ten before he felt himself fall slack , chin falling to his chest. He vaguely felt something vibrate at his inner thigh before his vision blacked out entirely.
“you are not guilty here , because you didn’t do anything wrong. You didn’t fucking rape me Steve! it was all consensual!" Steve flinched hard at the word but it looked like it affected tony more than himself.
Alarm bells went of in Steve’s head as he quickly pushed away looking at Tony who was unable to stop the tears from flowing.
Steve didn’t hear what Clint replied ..he was just too tired for his ears to pickup on Natasha’s earpiece sounds at the moment.
“shaken up, he thought I was dead. How did no one bother to tell him” Steve said, it was not accusing he was just not sure what happened after he had lost conciousness.
“Listen,  Mr. Rogers. We really didn’t mean to be drinking yesterday. It’s just that we thought Tony needed us and well it-" Rhodey and Pepper were standing in front of Steve’s table pepper clutching at her backpack nervously . There was still fifteen minutes to go for the class to begin. Rhodey and Pepper had shown up early like Steve had asked them to. Tony stood behind them fidgeting with his phone as they tried to give an explanation.
“I need you to take some nice deep breaths for me buddy” tony didn’t seem to register what he was saying , So Steve gently tipped his head back to look at him and he could make out that he was clearly still zoning in and out of reality probably still processing what had happened. It hurt him to think tony had been left alone in this state the whole time he had been unconscious.
“what if I don’t want an option?” tony asked his voice unsure and Steve sighed
Tony had told him about the sexual abuse and then Steve had proceeded to stroke him into orgasming and stane would know and would have heard everything.
Steve has been teaching history since almost five years now. Waking up after 11 years, shield had made sure to be kind enough to let Steve be what he wanted to be.
Tony whimpered at the intrusion his breathing picking up again and Steve gave her a pleading look as she made her way over to them. She sat down on the other side of tony , fingers find his hand and holding on firmly.
Steve was going to miss his short summer break. I mean don’t get him wrong ,he loved his job, but anyone would need a break from being around hormonal teenagers all year. This year’s break was perfect, normally there was always a long mission that would ruin his downtime . But finally, for once, thank Thor! fury hadn’t needed him on anything other than his occasional shield training programmes and such and no aliens had decidedly crashed his summer break.
“I should be the one who is sorry, I am really sorry that I didn’t realize what was going on sooner" tony didn’t say anything after that , he sniffled a little but otherwise kept quiet.
By now natasha was watching the two intently, looking for signs of distress and so she caught the reaction even if it was subtle when she mentioned stane coming for Tony.
Tony surprisingly nodded “Kay, but it was not obie , it’s not his fault. Don’t call him . Promise me you won’t call him.” He said his eyes flitting between Steve’s face and the phone he had picked up.
“We are going to fix this” he felt tony shaking his head and pushing him away , Steve let him.
The three of them realized the problem immediately, all three sets of eyes zeroing in on the tent of Tony's pants.
Sharply dressed, hair clean and set , the brunette squared his shoulders and took a breath “my name’s Tony, I am a transfer student. History is boring, “ said the brunette ,eyes meeting Steve’s amused one’s daring him to say something “ I am a futurist myself, so I’ll be happy to share my future with you guys instead” Steve bit his lip to keep from smirking at the pompous kid while he gave a slight pause for dramatic effect “it’s gonna be awesome”
“Clint you idiot,  I only asked you to check in on them not wake then up" he heard natasha say as Steve rubbed his hand over his face getting the sleep out of it.
Steve felt his hands snaking down under his shirt ,tugging on it until Steve gave up and helped him take  it off.
“I don’t want to get everything wet" he said still wiping his shoes on the doormat.
The surgeon , along with bruce visited early in the morning he had learned from Clint. They hadn’t wanted to wake Steve because he looked like he needed the rest apparently. Steve was not even mad. He was just happy to see Tony awake and tracking unlike the times he had woken up last night.
“Natasha made a personal request that I come, and when it pertains to Tony I seldom refuse”
“Fine,” he mumbled and when Steve calmly wrapped his fingers around Tony’s to still them, his breaths started to come in tiny gasps and natasha said something about being in shock and getting a sedative and vanished.
I woke fully alert at that letting them know I was awake " No one is calling pepper!"
“NO. You are not leaving. I just got you back. You are not going anywhere. You can stay here in my apartment as long as you want , I wont bring  him here, I will move in with shield for the time being. You are not leaving, let me help you Bucky please"
steve carefully pried his fingers out of Tony’s, “I am going to show you okay?” He said pulling his shirt over his head and Tony’s jaw dropped , there was a resounding pop as his lips parted. He reached his hand out hesitantly letting it hover over Steve’s chest, the angry scar running across it.
“Okay now enough stalling tell me what happened” he asked and Steve pulled out his phone from his pocket setting it beside them.
Howard and bruce did this more often than not. Bruce usually does yoga or something and Howard used to drink his thoughts away and Steve had been there to pick up after him everytime.
“I don’t…steve please dont tell anyone please…i shouldn’t have told you i..shit” he pulled on his shorts quickly backing away from near steves proximity.
“Did you eat your lunch?” he asked as he watched him pack his bag and Tony rolled his eyes
“Steeve, it tickles” he said breathily and Steve pulled him down between his legs until Tony’s lips were in line with his
“can we come in?the food is getting cold.” Clint said poking his head through the door. Impeccable timing.
“And so history repeats itself as you find yourself back in my class” he heard a few chuckles and multiple groans and he smiled back pleased at the cheeky introduction he had managed to pull off.
“no, steve took care of them. But I remember being used by someone else but like I said before I don’t know who" steve snapped out of his trance when he realized something
“You called me sweetheart” Steve’s hand froze over the paper, the red ink creating an ugly mark on the neatly written words. Until this moment, Steve hadn’t even realised he had said it but now the memory of it was suddenly startlingly clear in his head.
“Oh really?”
“That’s normal for teenagers, I don’t see why that’s a problem” he said casually not making a big deal out of it
Tony took a half step back when Steve approached him, he was sure his ribs were at least bruised if not actually cracked.
“I am not lying to him anymore. He knows” Steve said tersely “actually, he figured it out” he received unimpressed looks from the assassins.
“Same old same old. Although there is this new kid , Anthony stark. A real smart kid if I may say so” Steve frowned , it shouldn’t bother him but it did. So tony liked physics but didn’t like history. That’s okay, students were allowed to have favourite subjects and clearly history wasn’t his. “He seems so uninterested in class but-“ Steve’s heart did a little flip, that was unexpected. “But I just graded one of his papers and there is stuff here that even I had to look up” he said pointing to the bundle of papers on the table Bruce had brought with him.
“Give me one good reason why and I don’t want to hear about there being nothing anyone can do for it” he said glaring at the kid, his tone had turned authoritative and it made tony stiffen in his seat.
“Kay, but I have to get to physics” he said sitting down his lips still a flush red and inviting. Steve shook his head slightly to clear his head and nodded
“Tony!” steve panicked when Tony became dead weight in his arms.
“Huh okay" he said nose crinkling, “everything is hurting" he whined after a pause and when Steve was about to suggest that it may have been his fault for falling asleep on the couch he blamed it on steve
“steve”
“You volunteered” bruce cut short and Steve smirked at both of them before giving tony a once over. He had been doing that a lot lately ever since he collapsed from exhaustion. He wasn’t yet fully recovered and Steve felt responsible and guilty .
“Just in case this a dream, I am not sleeping” Steve barked out a laugh.
“you with me?” He asked painfully aware of Tony’s weight on his own erection.
“Okay now you are scaring me, tell me what’s happening please” he begged as he pulled them both upright
“Look at me tony” he asked as he ground his hips down watching Tony squirm at the friction and Tony’s body spasmed beneath his and he had his squeezed shut and Steve was surprised as he pulled away , leaving some space between them.
He looked up  and immediately Steve pulled him in for a kiss. He kissed him hard, passionate, nothing like they had ever kissed before. The pencil in Tony’s hand clattered to the floor and Steve caught Tony’s hand wrapping his fingers tight around his small wrist.
“Couple of reasons, we need to talk about your housing situation and then figure out what to do about stane.”
“Fine now" he mumbled looking away from Steve and around the room.
Reaching into his nightstand he pulled out a small rectangular box , about the size of his palm and he crouched in front for Tony and handed it over to him.
"I want to go back home, don't want to stay here" steve frowned wondering what had changed suddenly. He pulled away to look at the teen , his eyes were closed and he was on the brink of falling asleep, steve could feel the exhaustion radiating from him.
“Did they check you over? Let me see" Tony said pushing away Steve’s hands and getting up.
“what is so interesting in that book anyway? I know you both have been spending every minute together discussing the arc reactor. Bruce please tell me he is okay" bruce sighed exasperated because this is not the first time Steve had asked him ,more like the tenth in the past week.
"he is alright, captain. Exhausted, and in need of rest, his iron levels need to be tested again. But he will otherwise be okay." I beamed up at the ceiling "thank you Jarvis"
“tony, you said you weren’t feeling good. Do you need a hospital?”
“Good morning,” she said “steve we need to talk to you, asap" see normally she would be more subtle, but the panic in her eyes was unsettling and Steve gently pulled the covers firmly around Tony,
The mission was simple, they had Intel of this assassins whereabouts. They were to trap him and bring him back to shield.  But everytime Steve thinks something is simple it becomes anything but.
Steve reached for Tony, holding onto his upper arm “that reaction said otherwise. What’s going on?” Steve asked in his no nonsense tone.
“What is this thing that no one can help with?” He asked him folding his arms around his chest giving him a stern look
“I love you sweetheart" he said as Tony’s eyes opened , he looked completely out of it and smiled sloppily at Steve nails digging into skin on his back.
He knew he couldn’t go all the way, atleast not the first time and Steve didn’t actually have to, halfway in and he hit his prostrate and Tony was whimpering in pleasure rather than pain. He held still waiting for Tony to calm down and start tracking again
“She’s down, went hard on her ankle. Wasn’t there to back her up” shit, this was Steve’s fault , if he had been there then they could have split up properly.
“same holds good for seventeen year olds"
Day five they had touched ground and Steve had managed to get Bucky in his apartment without incident. It wasn’t until there was a knock on the door that had Buckys eyes go glazed and focused laser sharp as he headed for the door while Steve was in the kitchen trying to put together something to eat that it all went to hell.
“Yeah?”
"Come here" he said and Tony shook his head staying rooted in place . He was flushed, his cheeks redder than he had ever seen. Eyes glazed over and was sweating ever so lightly. He looked completely inebriated.
“Ms Jones, can you hear me?” he tried as he gently shook her shoulder but she didn’t show any signs of waking up.
Besides, clint and natasha and thor were his most trusted teammates, he functioned best with them.
“How did this happen?” he growled and Tony retreated a step back and Steve had to remind himself to calm down.
Thor woke to the sound of the hamper shutting close and Steve gave him a small smile as he watched the Norse god fumble around trying not to fall off the small bed.
“Fuckk" Tony muttered as he pushed himself completely against the headboard and Steve was about to chastise him but Tony put a hand to his mouth “sorry!” he said and Steve rolled his eyes.
“Are you alright? you seem rather distracted?”
"let's not tell Steve about this little incident okay? He has been enough worried lately. I don't want to trouble him on my account"
“Since I cuddled with her with a hard on" he muttered , his cheeks going a scarlet red
“Oh" was all Tony said , he sounded so sad ,it was terrible to hear .
Tony sat himself down on the bed immediately pulling apart the covers and over his lap and looked around the room
“Try the gym showers, its usually a quiet place. Tony likes hanging around there knowing no one will disturb him when he really has to get work done.” Steve smiled gratefully at him taking off.
“Or do you want to skip it because you have a test in physics?” Tony grumbled while Steve chuckled at him and they both startled when the door pushed open.
“handsome?” he felt Tony nod ,his face safely tucked away into Steve’s shirt to avoid showing his emotions to Steve.
“Shut the fuck up, no way!” and Clint grinned from ear to ear happy at Tony’s reaction to their superhero alternative.
Tipping his chin up , Steve moved in closer, their lips almost touching he whispered “will you be good for me while I am gone?”
“he’s not breathing right, he needs to be on oxygen.” Bruce said and steve looked up alarmed as Bruce explained “ sounded like he swallowed a lot of the ocean water, his lungs are compromised. He probably already has an infection which is why he is wheezing. He’s going to wear himself out at this rate. Did he feel warm to you?” he asked steve as everyone sat more upright in their chairs with full attention.
“If I had known that this is all it took to get you all hot and bothered I would have worn it all the time” he said his voice a little more nervous as he finally caught on.
“No needles please” he said and Steve relented as he dropped the suture and needle back into the bag holding his arms out and Tony relaxed.
“Okay, come on let’s get you get you back to bed"
“How are you feeling now?” he asked instead
He took the remaining steps quietly so as not startle the boy awake and crouched down in front of him.
“Yeah it is” Steve said as he yelled for natasha to come in knowing she has a key.
“What’s wrong?” he asked as Tony shifted back on the couch away from Steve and said
He took a second and made a decision,  if he reveals to Bucky that he knew Tony then incase things went south there was chance that Bucky might go after him.
“I’ll send a nurse with a shot of painkillers and we were told to release him after that in the care of obadiah stane.”
“Can we get this out then?” he asked sticking his arm out that had IV.
“we had the school principal call him and insist that Tony stay here. That he is doing extremely well in school and would like to see how far they can help him. It’s not much but it will buy us some time. Atleast enough time to figure out a way to convince stane that we are good for him. “
“Bucky, you with me?” he asked after a minute of complete silence and it took a few seconds for him actually look up at him amd when he did he looked terribly saddened and Steve knew in that moment that he probably had done something he regretted deeply.
“What did you do before?”
“And since when do you have a medical degree?” He received a spectacular glare from tony for that.
Steve stood rooted near the entrance, he didn’t want Tony to take what happened for granted . He needed to apologize and he needed to know that Tony understands that it won’t happen again.
(See the end of the chapter for
He flexed his neck and shoulders trying to relive the stress built up from sleeping too long.
“he went to the restroom” and Steve nodded again looking the two of them
Tony sighed closing his eyes against the cool of his hand and Steve dropped a kiss to his head before nodding towards the bowl for natasha to hand over to him.
He found him , thankfully still asleep and thanked natasha for sitting with him , he pushed the railing down on his side of the bed, sat down beside tony and shook him gently.
“Help me Steve..help" he let out but didn’t move a muscle as he sat there trembling and Steve quickly dropped the railing on his side of the bed and sat down on the bed hand going to his face trying to comprehend what he was saying
“Are we done? I ordered my pizza two hours ago” came clint's voice over the com. He had surprisingly stayed silent during his and Natasha’s conversation.
Steve had never even known that he should have questioned his relationship with Bucky. He found himself often having to wonder what if ? But ever since he found Tony  things had changed a lot, he hadn’t really been thinking about the others, bucky, peggy, the first time he was embraced by a man after being unfrozen.. , well he was thinking. A lot. About tony, but that was a good thing right?
“They knew you were okay , everyone knew . Except for me ..I don’t know if I can do this anymore. I can’t do this" Steve’s emotions scattered like a million humming birds and he took a step closer to reach out to take his hand and tell him it’s going to be okay and Tony pulled his hand back and still didn’t look up to meet Steve’s eyes.
Bruce shrugged "we are all mostly fine, just a few bruises here and there" he said looking at Tony, which was Bruce's way of telling me I should currently be paying more attention to the man now snuggled into my arms.
But Tony didn’t come out of the bathroom after ten minutes and Steve knew he was stalling so he turned the knob and entered without warning to find Tony on his phone leaning against the sink.
“Its none of your business” he snipped and ouch, that hurt but Steve deserved it.
“obie lied to me all these years, I can’t go home. Home is not even home anymore” he said so quietly it tugged at Steve’s heart.
Steve sighed in frustration as nat moved away from the door, “go tell him you are on his side. I am going to go talk to coulson and find out what I can” she said and he thanked her silently watching her go.
“Steve , what do you expect us to do with him ?” Clint asked tracking Buckys every small movement.
Steve stayed back in the gym , a few rounds with a punching bag would do him some good to at least let him take out his anger with stane and his best friend.  Three broken punching bags later, Steve left feeling calmer. That night Steve slept with his phone right by his pillow, hoping to not receive any kind of distress call from Tony. It terrified him to think that even after knowing he had let Tony go back there. Sleep came with difficulty,  and it was not restful whatsoever.
Steve said as he got up to leave the room. "Okay" The thought of breakfast made me feel nauseous ,still hung over from the small amount of scotch I had yesterday night at the gala,
“hi” he said bashful all of a sudden “what time is it? I feel so tired urgh” and steve was suddenly worried he had taken it too far.
“I don’t know.”
“Please" tony whispered and this time Steve wrapped his hand around his waist ,and used the other to pull
but Tony’s breathing was not calming and he was still gripping Steve’s arms in a death grip and Steve’s heart was breaking as he gathered the boy into his arms lifted him and sat on the bed with him on his lap.
"Definitely not as much as how much I love you" He said breathily. "But probably close."
Steve got up from his desk and walked over to Tony leaning against the bench behind him
“Why?” Tony got defensive as he looked up and shot a look to Steve as if he had expected it to have been his idea and Steve shook his lightly at him before tipping his chin towards the spies.
"You are mad" Steve barked a laugh at him
He also picked up the hospital gown along with the other supplies and carried them over to the table he had rolled over next to Tony’s bed. Bruce had already told him that would have to monitor his urine output because he would be on some pretty heavy medication including angiotensin receptor blockers which would affect his kidney function as well.
Waking up to an empty bed sucks. It has been only 4 hours since Steve woke me up to kiss me goodbye with a promise of me giving him a daily update. We are generally not a clingy couple ,always allowing each other the required space when one needed it, but ever since I was diagnosed anemic (which also sucks) Steve has been giving attention to me with full force, daily cuddling and all. He gets edgy when I don't respond back with the same amount of attention. But it's always his fault really, he only ever asks me these things when I am in the middle of a breakthrough in the lab.
“good morning?” Bruce asked as he got into his car, he had promised he would pick him up as he had taken Bruce’s car last afternoon to take Tony home.
“That’s the point. There are towels in the cabinet and I will be right outside if you need me" steve said trying very hard to control his face from showing the worry.
“Do you really want to see obie?” steve watches his face for any clue knowing tony was currently open to the world with his emotions.
“Tony, it’s just me sweetheart. You are okay" tony relaxed against him , leaning back against him trying to get the kinks out of his neck. Steve wrapped a large warm palm behind the nape of his neck kneading the muscles there.
“It wasn’t like that, I was afraid Bucky would hurt him more if I tried to do something. I figured if I pretended not to know him he wont have a reason to. Or if in case later-"
“wait, you knew my dad?” Tony was on in his knees, suddenly excited and Steve sighed rubbing his palm over his weary face.
“the poisoning is..?” steve wasn’t able to form complete sentences as one of the nurses pulled Tony’s sheets out of the way , to reveal that he was completely naked underneath and Steve had promised he would be there , with him the whole time and made sure no one touched him without his permission. Before she could touch the catheter , steve was on his feet.
“I told you CPS will want to do it, let’s get it over with.”
Steve was a little alarmed at hearing that, cause that may have just confirmed an injury that Steve was suspecting based on how he was sitting before Tony noticed him.
I groaned trying to get up "I am fine, the energy overload must have shorted out the reactor. I need to get to the tower, the spare one is in my lab." I said looking down at the reactor which seemed to be flickering consistently, I could feel the jittery movement of my heart from the abnormal impulse it was receiving from the reactor. Steve was going to be so mad, but only if someone told him right?
steve resisted the urge to kiss him. It was the last thing Tony needed ,besides having Tony sitting on his lap was not particularly helping either, but at the moment all Steve wanted was to make Tony feel safe. Safe enough that Tony would never hesitate to come to him for help again.
“Yeah clint , see I am fine. I don’t need this" he said waving the arm with the IV again and both Clint and Steve tried very hard not to roll their eyes.
“Yeah I mean think about it, why would you change your clothes before bed when you address going to shower in the morning anyway.”
“I couldn’t sleep, so I went down to fix your microwave" and Steve sighed in relief closing his eyes for a brief second and it only lasted a second because Tony also apparently remembered the sedation
Before Steve could tell him that no this was something he could actually talk to Tony about he continued
Tony looked surprised when Steve waved a bowl of ice cream in front of his face as they settled down onto the couch, tony immediately pushing himself as far as possible into the couch.
Steve was walking back to his class his mind an absolute mess of everything Tony had just shared with him that he didn’t notice Bruce until he smacked straight into him sending the papers he was carrying askew.
“That’s great to hear, I am happy for you. Does that mean I won’t be seeing you at school anymore?” Steve couldn’t deny that even if he was happy for Bruce, the thought of his only good friend here at school might be leaving was saddening.
Tony’s eyes went wide for a second as he realized who it was. He shuffled a little letting the books in his hands fall to the floor. He smiled at Steve,  gave a small wave with his hand but did nothing more.
Tony loved bruce , they got along really well and Bruce had taken to Tony just as quickly
"I put lotion on them, feels good" Bruce gave me a disapproving look shaking his head.
After that, Steve spent the rest of the day finding himself constantly looking over at tony while tony did the exact opposite.
it took him another five minutes to find some shirt and pants with shield logos brightly printed on them. He never liked the fit, but he wasn’t going to complain.
“Tony, please for me. You know I cannot concentrate on my mission knowing I won’t be there for you if you need me.”
“what? Why are you guys in a bar? Why did they let you in?!” he almost shouted Into the phone his concern replaced with disappointment and irritation that not only had Tony been drinking but that he had roped his friends in as well.
"my heart rate sensors recorded during the night tells me captain Roger's did not actually sleep at night, but was just lying in bed with you sir." I groaned knowing exactly why he did not sleep. He would have stayed up all night worrying about the arc reactor failure.
“Yes, what’s it to you?” Clint asked
Steve didn’t think it was okay and didn’t want to tell him that so he said instead “you are tired, let’s just get some sleep for today"
He needs a haircut , tony was looking nothing like the sharp well dressed teen he had been when he first joined school off late ,but then again he had been through a lot in that time.
Neither of them could actually get drunk because of the serum but they had come to like the taste of it.
Stane on the other hand had gone berserk when CPS came forward with original birth certificate and had denied any claims regarding the fake one saying that it was what Howard had left him with.
”take the time you need and give the button another ring ,I’ll come back for the IV" she said and left
“Don’t call anyone, I am fine” the words left his mouth in a rushed manner and he turned away from Steve before he added a “please”
“I am not leaving tony here" he said stubbornly
“Hey bruce!” he said smiling at the man as he adjusted his glasses
He tried the door and found it unlocked and he opened it half way and just in case said “I am coming in" and then gave a pause waiting for any reply and when he didn’t receive one he pushed his way inside.
“this game has been going on for an entire year now, what fury doesn’t know won’t hurt him”
He pushed him self up before he could get carried away and Tony whined at the loss of contact making grabby fingers at him
Steve asked the gears turning in his head as he tried to put pieces together.
Bruce gasped as I neared him " Tony! Your arm!" looking down I saw the red blistering mess on my arm, and felt the same burn along my torso. I let him examine my arm, but stopped him as he moved to lift up the undershirt.
“Have I told you how much love these?” he asked and before Tony could answer he Steve licked at his nipple , his fingers tweaking the other one and Tony’s body arched away from the bed and it only turned Steve on the more moans that Tony let escape from his mouth.
“to where?” he asked looking up his forehead now covered in a thin layer of sweat.
Steve panicked just a little bit when he saw only the agent that was meant to be with Tony  but no Tony.
Pain laced through his fingers travelling down to his arms and his ears buzzed as he felt the blue light flash bright behind his closed eyes. There was a moment of complete silence where all Steve could hear was his own scream before he blacked out.
Steve groaned when he suddenly realized that he had forgotten to check in on tony. It was the weekend and Steve knew he was going to be busy with shield. So he probably wouldn't get to see Tony until Monday.
