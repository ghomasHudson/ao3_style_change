“I know, isn’t it great?” She linked arms with him. “I think you’re going to be my new best friend.”
“I like your coyness but come now, Steve, surely you’re more creative than that. Don’t get boring on me now.”
“Perhaps. I do not know. My brother and I moved here four years ago. We were the newest here till you. From Sokovia.”
Meandering around, Steve decided to fill up some free time before Tony’s departure by exploring. The household filled up roughly four-stories of space, not including the gym. Smaller apartments filled up other floors and that were in use but the occupants were not presently in. Apparently, they were very good friends of Tony’s and acted as business partners within a certain sector of Stark Industries.
“I am still ready to find a broom and break your ribs.” Steve muttered, his face hot. He knew he had nothing to feel ashamed over. But he still couldn’t help but feel foolish for his worry.
Tony’s hands reached down and found Steve’s own. They were calloused but quite slender. Artist’s hands. Tony remembered that Steve wanted to be an artist before the war started. There were old sketches of his in some museums while the rest belonged to Peggy in her London home. He made another mental note to have Jarvis order anything any aspiring artist would need and to convert part of the lab into a studio. They could always work together. The thought was a pleasant sucker-punch. “Don’t think I didn’t notice the term physical. What about mental?”
His fingers, cut and burned from tending to the fire and starting on projects to keep the family warmed, screamed a him and every move he made. He stared at them forlornly and tried to image they were covered in charcoal and paint rather than callouses and bruises.
His head snapped to full attention at Steve, his teeth sharp in something that read as excitement. “You’ve heard of me.”
“Man, you are perfect for him.” A breathless Clint noted as he came over, throwing his arm around Steve’s shoulders. “Didn’t think they made people like you anymore.”
“I’ll see if there is anyway to get a telegram. I do not believe we should be excluded from news.” Brock noted, stretching himself before he popped up to his feet. “I’ll compose a letter for Schmidt to see if he could help us not go insane while here.”
“Well enough. Mom was a strong woman. She knew she was in a comfortable but not the most loving relationship. She handled it well. She was a great support to him and he to her. I think on some level they were really good friends, possibly best friends, and cared deeply for one another.”
Steve kept his smile pleasant as Tony’s hand came up to the back of his neck and started to massage his scalp. It made something inside him quiver again. He just wasn’t sure if it was good or bad.
At least, that was the hope. Steve desperately needed that kindness if all of what surrounded him was true.
“I’ve seen a lot of injuries. I’m a bit more familiar with medical science than almost any other, I’m afraid.”
?!” He was still laughing. “Babe, my eyes were constantly on your ass. I commented about you and Pilates. I asked if someone kissed me, looking deadass at you, when I woke up from getting the wind knocked out of me.”
“Dumbass top.” Steve retorted easily, sharing a smile when Tony beamed. Of course the smartass loved it when he kept up with his sarcasm. “But, if we ever want to give it a try…we know how quickly I recover,” he tilted a brow, “wonder how it would be if I just rode you until you pass out.”
“So, talking…to the best of our abilities.” He went back to looking awkward. “I have…I have an idea on what I want but I am worried other things may be discovered…and, well…”
“Relax, dollface.” He whispered against Steve’s ear and continued to rub Steve’s erection painfully, “I can see you’re already close. Did getting your pretty mouth ruined by me get you like this? Taking care of me? Giving me this pleasure?” His teeth grazed over Steve’s neck. “You’re such a sweetheart. Such a giver. You get off by making others feel good, don’t you?”
A tingle of interest started but Steve tried to scratch it out of his chest. He could feel his book rubbing against his fingers, pressed protectively in his jacket, and thought it best that Sam did not see it and know of his interests in horror and fairies. “I struggle to believe a house could be an issue.”
"Yeah, yeah. Keep your panties on, old man." Tony sneered, twirling his blades before sheathing them into their place at his thighs and hips. He wasn't allowed to keep the guns in his room--apparently he could construct something to escape with them or something like that.
Steve was ready to sing it, especially when he felt the head of Tony’s cock pressing up against him and started to push in. In his current state, he could not quite figure out many creative pleas, things were about to get pathetically repetitive as his mind was suffocated by lust that made him stupid…but he didn’t care. He’ll give Tony anything and would do most anything to get that large, gorgeous cock inside him and make him whole.
“I’m,” he swallowed and he found his fingers were trembling. For the first time in years he was nervous. He felt something akin to fear. An overwhelming surge of emotions plagued his mind and the supreme leader simply had no concept on how to control it all. “I’m about to throw up. But I can’t throw up, it has germs, and this is a hospital and he’s sick…” He sputtered out.
“Baby, no.” Tony scolded, kissing over his face again. “I’ve told you to stop agreeing with everything I say about our relationship without talking. I appreciate you trusting me having more experience but you need to understand things before you agree to it.”
"You are my heir. You have will deserve what it is you wish. Tell me, my son, what is you desire the most?"
"Like I give a shit what people think. You're not even here so I am already insane looking as it is. Why not throw a daddy-kink in for the hell of it?"
“Furious.” Tony started to nibble up to Steve’s ear, his voice low and his hips started to press against Steve’s own.
It was probably best not to let Steve know the advancement Tony had made with his weapons with it. Or that he had used the weapons to threaten and crush governments to his will. Something told him the patriot would not yet know to appreciate the tactical and necessary move.
“And it will. But you know,” the older doctor sat down next to him in the cave, their forced experiments around their feet, “sometimes happiness gets lost too and needs someone to find it.”
“Most find the risk work it.” Tony’s voice was breathy. “Others have found the risk well worth the reward I give them.”
“I have all of the medical files on him.” Pepper said from his side. Occasionally she would press a finger on his shoulder when his bouncing became too much. She was very talented controlling his hyper vibrations while simultaneously reading on one of their tablets. “Good news, we can take him home tonight.”
“Yes?” She tipped her sharp glasses down her nose to stare at Steve. Up close, she was beautiful and even more imposing but Steve found he quite liked that.
“He’s the best animated creation ever to exist. I would be a fool not to get him.” Clint looked down at his samurai and decided, yeah, it needed a friend on the other side. And there was no better friend than Totoro. His plan for the Mandalorian one can be on his calf. Or maybe with Totoro…that would be an awesome piece. Star Wars and Studio Ghibli? Muah, chef’s kiss galore.
Pierce rolled his eyes. “Fine, fine. Hurry up, Steven. We have had nothing but tea and bread. We still expect dinner by six sharp.”
“I’m surprised you’re not more grateful. You say you wish to kill me, yes? I am training you for this very opportunity.”
Gulping, his throat feeling dried, and his skin itched something fierce. He was in the dark, struggling to see anything that Tony refused to let him see. There was so much more going on but what was it? What did any of it mean?
“Where’s a blaster? I’ll shove it so far up his--” Thor covered the raccoon’s mouth to get him under control.
Steve moaned at the wake-up, blinking himself awake to see Tony looking at him with a very familiar expression. “T-Tony…”
A terrible chill ran down his spine and he straightened up, slowly turning to look up at the large circular window. He paled when he saw a dark figure, standing and staring. He was laughing, Steve realized, as he watched the blond deal with his terror. Tony gave a playful bow, seeing himself caught, and then was gone.
And the sooner Thor ruled over Asgard the better it would be for Tony. Now that his rule over the Earth’s governments was finalized and secured he could progress to the next phase of his plan and it was one he was looking forward to but he wasn’t cocky enough to think he didn’t need all the help the Avengers could provide.
“Thanks?” Steve tried not to step back as he drew closer. His knees quivered but he kept his blue eyes forward and now, up close, he could see the true eyes behind the glasses.
Steve worked hard to keep his teeth from snapping against each other. He remembered watching some of the nurses and doctors within camps try and talk to men in shock from the battle, asking very simple tasks and questions. Was he in shock?
Steve needed no introduction; there was no doubt that this was the supposed god of thunder in the flesh. This man, Thor, was larger in height and width and had Steve not be completely enamored with Tony there would be heart-eyes galore. Tony’s point of using his suit to pin Steve down was not off the mark in being sexy; it was something Steve really enjoyed the idea of…and this man could do it without any issue.
“We just need to get this place cleaned up a bit and sold. Zemo is heading to Harvard in just shy of a year and despite our…situation,” Brock’s eyes darkened into a fearsome glower towards Steve, “father and myself still have connections that will bring us back into the spin of things soon enough. We’re here three years at the most, I predict. An unfortunate occurrence but one we can make due with.”
“Ooh! OOH! Totoro in a Mandalorian helmet!” Clint continued to screech. “This is the fluffy, neighborly way, bitch!”
“Big guy will have our help from Asgard by then. Maybe you two,” he pointed between Natasha and Thor, “could get together and come up with some new techniques for the audience’s viewing pleasure.”
"I am Tony Stark." He hissed to himself as he stepped out of his room to head to the training room. "I am Iron Man."
Groaning, he tried to get comfortable, tried not to think of ghostly arms or the new surroundings or how hungry he was, but his mind continued to talk to him. He groaned miserably.
Without the use of lube, even with his own saliva, Steve felt ripped apart as Tony sunk in. Unlike the fingers that burned this genuinely hurt and for one brief moment of panic thought he was about to start bleeding.
Pepper shook her head but gave him a smile in defeat. “Ok. Ok. Your present isn’t here quite yet but I just needed to let you know about it. We'll have to go pick it up.”
“Well,” Sam shifted on the seat. He did not sound quite prepared to let the topic go but what could he say? They were still practically strangers and they couldn’t impose themselves on one another. “If you need anything you know where to find me.”
Thanos pulled up his ruined hand, still melted into the Infinity Gauntlet, "This will also be in affect. What better way for you to use the stones with some of their power already flowing through you? You have a chance of using them without such intense consequences as I faced this way."
"I wouldn't want your money even if you had it. That's not why I do it and you know it. Besides, baby, you're a hero who is the reason myself and many others are alive today. So think of it as me paying
“Tony,” Steve went after him, feeling the spark of something akin to annoyance hitting the air—a rather normal reaction whenever Steve got too close to the handsome inventor. But it was something. He had waited, for a few seconds, to allow Steve to catch up. He wasn’t shooing the awkward young man away. There were no intense, spiteful glares or closed doors or anything like what Steve expected. “I was just showing everyone--”
Perhaps it was just the paranoia of his new acquaintance, but staring at the house as he came back felt like he was walking into the mouth of a hungry creature.
“Holy shit.” Steve yelped, looking at the ground and then at Tony who was carrying him bridal style to the bed. “Holy fucking hell.”
Clapping his hands he got the group’s attention “Thor, bring them in. Now! Everyone, time for fun. Lights, camera,” he could not fight the eager grin spreading over his face, “action.”
Everything about himself, from his skin to his bones to his mind, felt like brittle glass. There were moments during the day where he’d simply be reaching for a glass within the kitchen, as if it were something he had done for years, and get cornered by the overwhelming feeling of loss. He was not home. He was not where he was meant to be. He had died before he could do anything he’d promised to do and was revived after the work was done.
“Yeah…worked in his favor often.” Howard smiled again and sat down on his chair. “Did I tell you of the time he embarrassed a senator publically?”
“Babe, we’re finally going to give you time to get looked over and healed mentally. We’re going to talk, you and me, about things. You’re going to see a professional. You’re going to get to be treated fairly and act like a kid, for once.”
The unnamed man approached him and sat on his bedside and gently took his hand. Normally, Steve was not one for touching, especially with strangers, but he found he really appreciated the handholding. It was difficult to breathe and every time he blinked he felt a sick terror enter his belly that he’d reopen them to find the frigid water roaring up to his face, ready to swallow him whole and consume his lungs.
“I do not do what I do out of the kindness of my own heart. I have been told on a few occasions I do not have one.” Tony finally picked up his own cup and sipped his coffee.
Tony looked over the files before he slowly nodded his head. “Give them word I wish to see them within the upcoming week. Make no hint of this assignment but I do want to meet with them face to face.”
Tony grinned and came up, wrapping his arms around Steve’s waist, “I am glad you like it…it is, you know, an important piece of me. Not just the suit but all of it.”
“He really wanted to be here.” Clint noted. “He’s trying to get better at finding veins during, he still feels bad about the mess last time, but that only happens when he gets
"Because I...well, most all of them are from my own choices. I shouldn't let myself to ever forget them and what I did."
“Right?” Steve knew of their desperate grasp on the lifestyle from New York but he hadn’t been aware they were so confident they could rise back up. He had assumed this was a permanent move.
Instantly the grumpiness melted and Tony gave him a look of open adoration and Steve had to look away. He learned Tony was greedy for compliments and since Steve could not yet give anything back to the man for his generosity, he gave them in plenty as well. Usually easy-going ones that were honest but not meant to be necessarily loving. It would be things he would have been comfortable enough giving to anyone under his command back…well, back home.
“Later.” Tony kissed him again. “Now,” his attention went down to the exposed chest and numbers, "Start from the beginning. I want to hear about all of them."
"Well," he cleared his throat, his brown eyes looking everywhere but those earnest, honest pretty blues. "That blue square was being a right to dick to us both."
His boss did not respond. Sam wanted to run for the hills but kept his knees straight in prevention. The silence was overwhelming and he knew the bearded man to the right of him would not break. So Sam did it with his humor and prayed it was enough to keep him alive.
“What about the Shields?” He remembered something had happened but he thought it had just been something sad but mundane. Was it something else? Did that mean Pierce knew about the tales and rumors? The bleak history?
Steve nodded, hooking his fingers in the loops of Tony’s jeans as he couldn’t help but get his thoughts jumbled up again. ‘Guess it does make sense…with power, technology, and intelligence that could create something like
Something cold gripped Tony’s insides. “You’ll just need to kill me. It won’t happen. It won’t happen.”
“Go wash your hands. I made stuff you do like, you know.” Steve said as he took the girl from his husband’s hands, gave her a kiss on the head, and placed her down to the ground.
He did not want to keep Pepper waiting so he turned away from the capital of his kingdom and continued his way up to his penthouse in the tower. ‘Fuck, I’m glad she caught me before I drank any further. These stairs suck. Why don't I have an escalator? Jarvis, put in an escalator. Jarvis?...oh yeah, I'm talking in my head.’ He was very pleased Pepper stopped him from drinking any more.
"I'm more fun than Ms. Potts will be if you actually spend time, money, and resources on making penguins fly and into assassins."
“Figure I was already a bit in over my head. What the hell…if I’m doomed I might as well enjoy something.” Steve took a bit of the sweets to make his point. “I mean, I called you a bastard.”
“Bruce suffered from an experiment gone wrong and now when he gets supremely angry he literally turns into a ten-foot tall bulking monster with green skin and little control over a violence tick.”
“Ok, ok…” Steve tenderly placed a hand on Tony’s hair. “Fine.” He smirked, “We’ll just table the conversation for later. OW!” He glared down at Tony who had bit him on the shoulder. “That may need to stop.”
“I don’t like bullies.” Steve admitted. “I only know stories of your folk…but I know my own can be cruel and piss-poor company.”
She rolled backwards, arching her shoulders just right to not take a terrible brunt of pain to her back. Natasha finished a roll and jumped back, getting into a crouched position, hands protecting her face, and held up her hand to stop.
“Someone has to be out there looking for him.” He was exhausted. He had little energy to argue as heatedly as he had at the start. His chest was not doing well and though he knew a lot of it had to do with the emotional turmoil and stress of his loss and battle, a lot had to do with the fact that a few thousand volts of alien energy had surged through his body numerous times. His burns and bruises were still around and tender.
“And you need to unload everything. Don’t pay the man for anything more than bringing you here.” Pierce dropped a few coins on the ground and then snapped his fingers. “Hurry up.” He then walked back inside.
He had prepared for a lot of reactions once he found Tony. Almost all of them dealt with fury and rejection. This…well, not even in his wildest fantasies did he allow an image to take that low of a voice.
“You don’t quite understand yet, darling. You are thinking it through, aren’t you? Bright little thing. Especially for a…” He paused and smiled, refusing to finish whatever his thought was.  “You’ll have it figured out soon enough, won’t you?”
Grunting, he flopped back into the soft mattress. It still made no sense how a bed that was at least thirty years old, if more, was still so untouched and clean. If he was not careful, he could sleep the day away in it and that would be trouble.
Steve made a point to unnecessarily look around his surroundings and returned Tony's look with an unimpressed arched brow. “You don’t say.”
,” and that was a nasty tone that made something freeze deep in Steve’s pit of a stomach, “words…Steven, was it?”
Tony always had a bit of a possessive streak. He tried to work on it throughout his life but it just had a tendency of coming out more like a spoiled brat who didn't want to share attention than anything...dark.
“No.” He answered before he gave it much thought. Something deep in his stomach knew something was off but could not imagine Tony hurting him. Tony was blinding and far too intense but he did not come across as someone cruel.
Sam teased, “Besides the two of you constantly throwing heart-eyes at each other? It’s hard to miss that. When I'm around you two I have to resist the ultimate temptation of singing the K-I-S-S-I-N-G-song. It's been in my head since I met you both.”
“Do I need to inform Mr. Stark of your current state?” Jarvis asked. His voice sounded kindly, as if there were a real human within the walls of the house.
Instead of anything romantic Tony simply dragged himself into the kitchen, drank his coffee like a hard shot, gave Steve a sweet little kiss on the head, sat near the counter and smacked his own head against the cool surface and didn’t move. He certainly moaned plenty.
“T-Tony?” Steve cleared his throat to get his stuttered under control. The man still looked a little lost in his own world so Steve provided some endearment, something the genius always appreciated, “Hey, love, come on, what is it?”
Tony chuckled. “A bit. You’ll find I like giving people nicknames. Everyone on my team has one. You are a very special though.”
“You fuckng freak. You disgusting, moronic, piece of shit.” Tony growled. “She didn’t sacrifice herself; you murdered her. And if you think I’d ever be something as revolting as your heir, you are more insane than I first gave you credit for.”
With another laugh, he gave her a pat on the back as he crossed they crossed his California mansion to get to the kitchen where Steve would be. “Someone has some words to say to you, babe.”
“Yes, Bruce is green. Purple for Clint. Red for Natasha…I know you use mostly red in your scheme but,” he shrugged, unsure how to really continue. “I felt gold suited you more.”
As he made his way back up, he paused before Natasha’s desk. He wasn’t sure exactly what he was wishing to inquire but he pinched his lips tight when she looked up at him with a certain expression of
Steve reached up, as Tony was now a bit taller than Steve, to touch at his neck, caressing over where his regular Tony connected with this impossible metal. “So, nanotech?”
The man gave a little noise and shifted in his bed, muttering something nonsensical. He was perfection and fit around Tony and in his arms so well; they were made for each other.
Steve grunted and looked around and, sure enough, he was in one of the comfortable beds rigged up to act as a medical station. Along with the sedative, Natasha had hooked him up to an IV. He hadn’t noticed any of it.
“People will smell me on you. Your ass will be dripping and sore,” to emphasize his point he reached around and hungrily grabbed Steve’s backside, squeezing. “God, I am going to make you wail for me.”
, Jarvis. Fuck, the bastard said Hydra.” His eyes moved over the screen as words, newsfeeds, and files popped up. “And not even a week after I found Steve.”
Thanos shared a soft smile, “You see it too. He was burdened with a power but his naiviety was taken advantage of by others. They turned his good into their own.”
Some more laughter, softer than before, “True. I must say I am still surprised how well you are handling me.”
Clint was trying to fit four Oreo cookies in his jaw when Bruce and Tony finally came out of their lab to refill their caffeine addiction.
“You needed me from the start, but I was too much of a fucking coward to do anything about it. I knew,
“I like your attention and you fulfilling your filthy promises in exploring your kinks with me. Tony, you have got to move or I will go insane.”
,” Tony whispered hotly, his breath against Steve’s ear. “I knew you were different the moment I saw your pretty eyes look up at the arc. Most barely see, let alone observe, the world around them. I weakened my glamour only slightly and you sensed it. You could smell and taste and touch my power.”
“Yes, yes, so good.” He started to gently thrust his finger, pleased at the reaction. It probably burned his lover, made him uncomfortable and overwhelmed, and it was so wonderful. Steve had always been so receptive in their bedroom activities and he was always so, so sensitive. Tony had known the young man would enjoy a bit of pain and roughness with the pleasure.
The hands holding him were back, one now covering his own smaller one and the other pressed against his hips. Lips were on Steve’s ear and the low voice purred, “You do not have to pull back. I will allow you to touch anything you want.”
The two entered. One man, Happy, gave a nod to Tony and then took place by the door with his hands crossed in front of him. He looked a bit heavy-set and had a face that deserved a smile than something so serious but apparently he was playing the role of bodyguard right now.
. If you behave as anything other than a man on the edge of death, we are all doomed.” His worst fear was that Steve would hear about the poisoning and attack Stane, which would ruin everything. “Understand?”
Tony shrugged. “I don’t understand how other people don’t. If I didn’t, I’d be bored out of my mind, and that is a fate worse than death.” Tony ripped off another piece of bread and chewed it, staring at Steve thoughtfully. “What about you? I know you’re not the wine, women, and song type, so what do you do in your free time? Do you stand at street corners and preach about sin? You have the disapproving scowl for it.” The smile on Tony’s face took the sting out of the words, and Steve suppressed the childish urge to stick his tongue out at him.
“Impossible,” Steve protested, and Stark made a gesture for him to settle down so he swallowed down his angry words.
Thomas fished a folded piece of paper out of a pocket and passed it down to Steve.  Steve turned it over in his hands, recognizing Stark’s seal in the embossed wax holding the paper closed.  “The Iron Cardinal wants you to give that to the Abbot,” Thomas explained, snapping the reins and clucking to his horse.
“You look dyspeptic, Steve,” Tony said, shuffling his papers together and setting them aside. “What’s the matter?”
“I got this,” she said, inserting what looked like a long, thin needle into the lock of the door. There was a minute of tiny clicking noises as her eyebrows drew together in concentration, then the lock finally popped open.
“I tried to rob him,” Thomas said shortly.  Clearly he was not a man of many words, Steve reflected, but his curiosity was too strong for him to take the hint and let him drive the wagon in peace.
you here?” Steve growled, surging to his feet. The sudden flare of panic-driven anger was a force beyond his control, hot and scary, like being on a runaway horse. “You don’t even know Bucky. You’re telling me you left your silk sheets and bedmates to come sleep on the ground out of the goodness of your heart?”
“Right.  Well, good thing you’re above such petty behavior,” Bucky said dryly. “Come on. If we hurry we can get in a few rounds in the training salle before I have to meet with the Grandmaster.”
When daylight woke him from his slumber again, he heard voices talking softly outside the room. Bucky was still fast asleep so Steve crept out of the room, rubbing his eyes tiredly.
Steve could well imagine, given Tony’s position in the treacherous world of royal politics. “I barely know who I am without Bucky. Without the…well, you know.” He touched his chest without thinking, where the Templar cross should have been emblazoned in bright red on white.
“The message I have for him is urgent,” Steve growled, taking a step forward so that he was looming over the young man.
It was only the work of a moment before the hinges were out and Tony and Steve had to catch the heavy wooden door as it sagged to keep it from hitting the floor. They leaned it carefully against the wall, then Steve took the candle and headed into the cellar. “Bucky?” he whispered as he crept inside; the cellar was deep, and the front part was still piled over with bags of onions, potatoes, carrots, and who knew what else. But in the back a large space had been cleared away, and after a moment the flickering candlelight revealed dark haired man slumped against the wall, hands chained above his head.
“What about you?” Steve said.  “If they suspect you are hiding me, and suddenly I vanish, won’t you be in trouble as well?” Stark stared at him as if that hadn’t occurred to him, then he started swearing so profusely that even Steve, a battle-tested warrior, felt his ears burning.  “I’m sorry,” he said inadequately as he realized the scope of the problems he’d made for Stark by just being here, not to mention this latest act of foolishness.
“You’re talking about the powers of God,” Steve said, aghast. “That’s blasphemy. And also impossible.”
Tony wrinkled his nose and waved a hand dismissively.  “Boring.  Is there anything else you need me for before I leave?”
“Wasn’t easy, but the Grand Master insisted on knowing who he was so I spent hours trying to uncover his identity. Talking to people, following his couriers, lurking outside places he was known to frequent. Very dull business, spying.”
“He’s certainly a Templar,” Sister Natasha said, “but he is sticking to his story with an admirable tenacity. Too much so, if you ask me, like he’d been prepared for questioning.”
“Oh?” Tony said, darkly amused. “My father would have disagreed with you.” He pushed himself up from his chair and crossed the room to a table on the far side. There was a tray there, with an untouched plate of food on it, but it had a bottle of wine on it as well and that's what Tony reached for.
But Tony saw his glance and suddenly smiled. “Is it the bed? I suppose this is our first night in a room together,” he mused. “But we are just two men of the cloth sharing a bed out of necessity. Nothing scandalous about that, right?”
“Seriously?” Steve hissed to Brother Peter.  The compartment looked like he would barely fit inside.
"More than that, though, we need to figure out what to do with Stane," Steve pointed out. "He will be extremely suspicious if you turn up completely healthy, and having tried to kill you once, he will almost certainly do it again."
“You said that the relics could give their owner the kind of power to change the future of Christiandom,” Steve said. He felt like he was watching himself, horrified by the bilious spite spilling from him but unable to stop. “Do you want them for yourself? Is that it?”
“Probably the root cellar, I can’t see him giving up his wine cellar,” Tony said musingly, eyes distant. The man fidgeted at the table for a little while Tony thought, and finally Tony’s gaze refocused on the man. “You can go. Thank you.”
“What in God’s name is that?” Steve said, staring down the table at the utensil in Stark’s hand. Bucky lifted his head from his meal and followed Steve’s gaze down the table. He made a thoughtful noise as he chewed, watching as Stark held his steak steady with the exotic, filigreed silver utensil as he cut and then used it to carry his food to his mouth. As he swallowed, Bucky looked down at his own plainer wood utensil. “It has two prongs,” he noted, looking back and forth between the two.
“Yes, Your Grace.” Belatedly, Steve remembered Stark’s instructions from last time and dropped to his knees. As a reward, Stark made a noise of approval and rested his hand on Steve’s head, fingers carding through his hair. Steve found himself starting to relax under the touch, letting out the breath he'd been unconsciously holding as fear bled away to leave only a trembling excitement in its wake. He was in Stark’s hands now and he knew Stark would give him what he needed.
An older man and woman came outside as Tony slid off his horse. “Lord Antoine?” the lady said. “What a surprise! What are you-”
Steve was still steaming an hour later, cutting into his food so furiously he threatened to hit the scarred wooden table under his trencher. “I don’t know why you let Stark get on your nerves so much,” Bucky said as they ate, crammed shoulder to hip with scores of laborers on their lunch break.  “He’s hardly the only impious priest in Paris.”
“I don’t understand what this one man has to do with Bucky and the treasure,” Steve protested.  “He told me something only Bucky would know, doesn’t that mean-“
“A bit of business,” Tony said. “I’m going to need some privacy tonight, but before we leave tomorrow, I am going to need you to help me get one of those mead barrels off the wagon.”
After eating, they banked the fire and laid down, Tony on his pillow and Steve on the soft grass with his blanket below him. “The stars are bright tonight,” Tony commented, and Steve opened his eyes to see that he was right; the moon was a thin sliver low in the sky, making the stars seem brighter by comparison.
“You’re awake!” Steve said joyfully, pausing just long enough to set down a tray of food before almost tackling Tony back into bed with a hug. Tony oophed at the impact but had to grin, happy to feel Steve in his arms. “How are you feeling?” Steve took a step back but kept his hands on Tony’s shoulders, like he couldn’t bear to stop touching him, as he studied Tony critically.
“Not like that.” When Tony arched his brow and gave him a pointed look, Steve flushed and amended, “Not
“Lord Antoine, when will you stop bringing home strays?” The man scolded gently as Tony laughed. He put his hands on Tony’s shoulders and studied him, taking in his short hair and monk’s robes with a look of exasperation. “What mischief are you up to now?”
“I am plagued by the – by lustful thoughts,” Steve forced out, turning his gaze to the hem of Stark’s gown so he wouldn’t lose his nerve. He’d managed to stay away for three days since the last time he’d felt Stark’s hands on him, scared both of what he wanted and how much he wanted it, but like a moth to flame he found himself here again, vibrating with need. “I fear I might be cursed,” he added in a low voice, because truly his hunger alarmed him sometimes, with what he was willing to risk to keep coming here.
“It’ll be fine,” Sister Natasha said without sympathy.  “Look at it this way – maybe you’ll get to see him naked.” And it was a measure of how upset Tony was that even the prospect of that couldn’t cheer him up.
Steve’s steps stuttered as he realized he was getting hard. He squeezed his eyes shut as he tried to continue with the Lord’s Prayer, but his mind and body had other plans; no matter how much he pressed the palms of his hands to his eyes, he couldn’t erase the images of Tony’s body, sweaty and flushed, moving against that of a faceless stranger.  How he would look in the throes of passion, head thrown back, eyes dark with pleasure.
Steve shook his head in disapproval and looked away so Stark couldn't see his reluctant smile. The amiable mood lasted for rest of the day, with Stark greeting and making conversation with almost everyone they met on the road as they traded the responsibility for driving. They never passed through a town big enough to have an inn, however, so when the sun was getting low in the sky Steve pulled them off at a grassy clearing next to the road. Steve gathered wood for a fire while Stark unhitched the horse from the wagon, putting it on a lead so it could graze. When Steve returned, setting down an armful of branches, he saw Stark pull out a pair of small pillows and blankets from the trunk in the back of the wagon. To Steve's surprise, Stark tossed one of the pillows to him.
Tony snorted. "Well, my father is definitely why I joined the church," Tony said, lip curling. But Steve had a point. Tony had clawed his way to the top of the Church so that his father had to choke on his success, visibly gloating every time his father had to kiss his ring when he attended services at Notre Dame. An entirely unchristian sentiment, Tony knew, but he never claimed to be a good Christian.
“You’re going to have to carry him,” Tony said, moving the candle to Barnes’s feet so that Steve could see what he’d seen. Steve nodded grimly and gingerly gathered Barnes into his arms, face going white at his pained whimpers.
“No one believes the confessions,” he said, taking a sip of wine.  “Not when they are made from inside an Iron Maiden. But they are making it difficult to defend the Templars, at least publically.”
“Showtime,” Tony said with a grimace, waiving away the painter. Tony pulled himself to his feet and the footman handed him his walking cane, a vanity one that he’d purchased in order to make a statement when he was acting as the Iron Cardinal. Tony leaned on it heavily as he made his way to the study, reminding himself of the stakes involved in this meeting every time he had to stop to catch his breath.
Tony opened his mouth a couple of times, then finally sighed. “Well, it’s not like I can argue with results,” he said finally. “But I want to see this grail for myself.”
Steve’s felt his face flame as he dropped to his knees. “Good,” Cardinal Stark said approvingly. The heat from his face spread down his neck and chest at the praise, until his whole body felt hot and flushed. He kept his gaze on the floor though his senses seemed entirely attuned to Stark, listening to the soft susurration of his robes as he walked around his desk.
“I don’t know,” Steve confessed. His heart was pounding so hard he thought perhaps Tony could hear it, breath coming so fast and shallow that he felt light-headed. He was surprised to realize he was achingly aroused, hard as a rock, after just those chaste kisses.
“I’m not sick, I’m just stressed out,” Tony insisted. “Overworked. There’s just so much to do I can hardly take a break.”
“Fine,” Steve said, relenting. He sat down on one of the empty beds sullenly, aware of Bucky’s eyes on him.
Steve stared blankly, unsure of what to say. Tony seemed surprised too, but recovered faster. “Hassam, your courage humbles me, but even if we were planning to track down this organization – which we aren’t,” which was true, for now at least, because Bucky was the priority, “this isn’t your fight. We don’t even know if this is truly the Hydra.”
“I’m sorry,” Tony said again after a long moment, and this time guilt was a rock in his stomach. “You’re right. I promise I’ll do better.”
“And philosophy?” When Steve looked at him, Tony said, “Brother Peter told me that you were borrowing philosophy books from my library.”
Steve didn’t like the narrow-eyed look Sam was giving them and braced himself for an argument. But after a moment, the look vanished and Sam bowed his head. “If that’s truly what you think is best, I defer to your judgment.”
Tony held his hands up and retreated in the face of Natasha’s righteous fury. “If I had said anything, you both would have rushed down here,” he protested. “And that would have put you in Stane’s path. I wasn’t going to risk you.”
Steve sat back on his heels, swallowing back his disappointment. He nodded and stood, stooping to retrieve the bottle of wine as he walked to the door. “I’m taking this with me,” he said, taking a swallow. He’d never drunk his sorrows away before, but now seemed like a good time to start.
“Friendships like yours are a blessing,” Stark said with a smile. “Please, have a glass of wine while we wait for the other guests to arrive.”
“You think I want to draw this out any longer than necessary?” Tony snapped. He struggled to a chair and sat down as if he were too weak to stand any longer, something that was sadly not too far from the truth. “I even took the time to mark the most likely location of the relics. In fact, I’ve done everything but dump the damn things in your lap. As you can see, I’m hardly in any condition to go haring off on a treasure hunt. Though if you gave me the antidote, and more time…” Tony trailed off suggestively. This was it, the moment on which everything hinged; was Stane greedy and arrogant enough to buy it? Had Tony dangled a tempting enough lure, spun a sufficiently convincing story? The moment stretched as Stane studied the page, flipping it over to read the clues and notes Tony had written on the back; when he finally refolded it, Tony let out a silent breathe of relief at the satisfied look on Stane’s face.
“Listen, Steve.” Bucky shifted, trying to sit up straighter, lips tightening a little with pain. “What’s the fifth commandment?”
Stane had left only a short while before they’d raided his castle. That explained why the rescue had gone relatively easily; everyone had been less alert without the lord in residence. But that still didn't explain what they had been doing here. Tony was so lost in his thoughts that he didn’t even realize that they were done until he noticed that the page was watching him expectantly. Glancing down, he saw that the boy had done a good job, securing the clothes without creasing the silk. “Excellent,” he said with an approving nod, and the boy beamed. Tony dismissed him with the sinking realization that the boy was now his responsibility, along with the steward, the butler, the footmen, the guards, every last servant down to the milkmaids and scullery boys.
They watched until Hassam and his wagon were out of sight before they climbed into their own and headed towards Chatellerault. The first part of the day was spent in silence, broken only by the jangling of the horse’s harness and the clop of its hooves. Tony kept his eyes on the road the entire time, jaw set with a thin line between his brows.
With shaking hands Steve pulled his tunic over his head, then stood to strip off his leggings and braes. The way Stark’s gaze lingered on his body made Steve flush, and his cock, already thickening, grew even harder. He wanted to touch himself as he had last time, remembered how Stark had watched, but he hadn’t been told to do that so instead he knelt again, the carpet slightly rough against his knees.
But Bucky was already shaking his head as he pulled away. “We will attract more attention together. I’ll find you,” he said again, setting his foot into the stirrup and climbing into the saddle. “Until then, watch your back.”
Steve nodded as he sat down at the table with her while Edwin stirred a pot of porridge over the fire. “I think his fever broke, though, so we should be able to get some answers next time he wakes up,” he said, resting his head in his hands. He must have been up with Bucky longer than he had thought, to be so tired today. “Where’s Tony?”
“Yes, to everything you could remotely say that’s negative or embarrassing.” Natasha smiled. “Anyone tell you that you are gorgeous?”
“Very. Listen, Steve, I don’t know what is happening within that house. I don’t really know what has transpired there for sure. All I know is, there is something wrong with it and I do not want to risk my own sanity.” They slowed down to the front of the home again. Lights filtered out from candles in the windows but Steve had seen the electrical lamps and knew he’d need to find a way to get it up and running again.
That was an awkward question with no honest answer available that would not lead to awkward pity. So he settled on the vague, but truthful, “it is just how it is.”
Steve weighed his options, his thoughts rushing over the possibilities. He was no scholar in this. It was all based on interest and rare free-time passion due to his mother. Was there any danger? Well, of course there was. Most any thing that popped into his head should not be played with…but there was not much choice at the moment, now was there. But guessing wrong or right should not make a difference…he hoped.
His fingers now went over the arch of his brows and scowled when Steve's forehead felt warm. “Does he have a fever?”
All this time, whatever this time was, and still those blue eyes haunted him. He could still remember that scent that made him imagine a cabin surrounded by pine woods in the snow, filled with vanilla and warm fires. How Steve’s cheeks and ears burned pink when complimented and his rare crooked smiles lit up his face. How his guarded face completely melted at a sight of a dog and how his brow softened when he started to draw or bake.
‘Perhaps I’m more affected than I want to believe.’ It wasn’t just the crash that kept him awake at night after all. Many nights he dreamt of screams for mothers and pleas to God to live. Other times it was the tortured, empty look of survivors he and his team could free from camps. Or Bucky, slipping through his fingers to meet a sad, lonely death at the bottom of a never-ending cliff.
Tony kissed the back of his neck. “You’re such a sweetheart, ah, now one of the most important people of my life.” Tony pressed his chin on Steve’s shoulder to look at the picture. “This is mom.”
Steve could not see his eyes, they were hidden by circular dark glasses that had a demonic red shade to them, but he could feel them burning at his paler skin. The man’s lips were twisted into hungry smirk.
“Perhaps you should check my hardwire, sir. I’d hate for something to be amiss and not to your liking. Ah, Barton is calling. Do you want me to patch him through?”
“Not just yet, but I have a good guess. I’m confident Mr. President has no clue. This was probably more military power. The way they attacked made me think they wanted to destroy the product and not use it. I think any government official who has to uphold a reputation would not stoop so low.”
Steve laughed, “Well, I guess that does sound better than a conversation about being mentally healthy. But since you’re so old and frail,” he grinned when Tony bit him again in warning, “I could do a bit more of the work.” And then flipped them over so he was on top, using gravity so Tony slid even deeper. “That acceptable for you, daddy?”
“Steve, please.” Steve smiled and was ready to get up and shake his hand but Tony’s hold told him to stay in place.
“I think so, yes. I plan on getting into the attic in the morning to check and ensure everything is stable then I’ll start on the bedrooms and then work from there.”
Tony’s lips then broke into a grin. “Fuck, I am good. I had some worries about you, Wilson…that you’d make this all about me or you’d use Steve to worm into the Avengers. But I had a feeling you were right for it.” He flicked his own collar, thoroughly impressed with himself. “I pick perfect people.”
“Tonight, we walked in a dream, but reality waits.” Tony lamented with a small smile, pausing at the gate. Stefen nodded, turning his head to look up at the house where light spilled out from the windows along with the sound of music, laughter, and many voices talking at once.
Father looked better now that he was clean, and he was shivering less with his fever abated somewhat, but it was only a marginal improvement.  They both watched helplessly as Bucky attempted to spoon feed him some soup without any success. Father’s throat was too raw to swallow, and he was too delirious to respond to any of their prompts to do it anyway.
Prince Thorson turned keen light eyes on him as they approached. Steve stiffened at the penetrating stare those eyes gave him, wary now of the prince's request to for a private audience with him. A lot was riding on their negotiations. He only hoped he could convince the Prince it was in Norway’s best interest to help them.
Steve perked up, the set of the man’s shoulders, the timber of his voice, hell the subject matter alone indicating that as unexpectedly as the conversation had started that it was important. Steve knew the sound of a man with something important on his mind and prepared himself to listen.
There was only one place that Tony knew he could look for answers and that was Stefen's study. His very locked study. Good thing Tony hadn't met a lock yet that could keep him out.
Sieger’s gaze flickered back over Fräulein Regenbogen. He nodded and asked her for what must have been the fourth time in the last half hour, if she was all right. Did she need anything? It was almost funny how he went back in forth between pretending not to know her and mother fussing like a worried mother.
Luck seemed to be with them as they turned the dark corner, but Péter didn't stop to see if the car would stop where they'd abandoned their things or turn down the road after them, running toward the main street where there was more light.
He pushed it all down, telling himself that of course a man as out of his depth where children were concerned as Stefen would be terrified of losing the help hired to deal with them.
He heard the sound of rioters chanting and making a ruckus somewhere close on the main street. They were shielded back here, but there was no telling for how long.
The soldier waving the paper barked something harsh into his handheld transceiver and the gate began to creak open.
Steve glanced down with a blink. Charlotte was watching him intently, her bright brown eyes roaming over his face. Steve gave her a tiny smile and straightened his back.
“No, you certainly don’t feel delicate, and good thing too. Lovemaking is not always a delicate business.”
Péter shot toward him and they collided like waves, Tony rocking as his shaking legs threatened to buckle under him, but he held on. Péter clutched to him with stifling force, his camera digging into Tony’s back as he pressed his face against Tony’s chest, body shuddering. He was crying, Tony noticed through his own tear-filled eyes. Silent tears clung to Péter’s dark lashes and leaked out of the corner of his eyes, smudging his cheeks.
“Sorry. They’re so good.” Péter apologized with a sheepish grin when Tony rejoined him, and Tony chuckled, shaking his head. Luckily, they found Pepper without too much trouble after. Just in time to watch her haggle the price down on a set of lace place markers she insisted weren’t home spun as the vendor claimed.
Even after he drained the tub his normally playful little boy did nothing but shake and cling to him while Steve dried him off.
Bucky jerked his head towards the music room and promptly lost which way was up for a moment. No sudden head movements. Got it.
Tony nodded stiffly in reply and continued on his way, in no mood to risk being stopped for a neighborly chat. He grit his teeth and wrapped his arms around himself to ward off the chill as he quickened his step.
Just to be sure they didn't, boys from the youth program were tasked with patrolling both ends of the street to make sure everyone kept the peace, and that no Jews tried to do anything illegal like going someplace they weren't wanted or walking about without their designated stars.
One pudgy hand slapped onto his chest and the other tried to pry one of his eye open (none too gently). Tony batted the hand away, rubbing his sore eye.
“Are you alright?” Péter, whose hands had darted out to steady his cup of juice, was looking at Bucky like he’d just declared himself the queen of England.
“Then why does he have to go away? He’s a very good gardener. He knows tons about bugs and he lets Maria help with the flowers.”
He remembered Nona begging him to come home to them, to people who loved him, his people, and her assurances that things were different in Pola now that it was Italian again. She’d told him to bring his children. He wondered how she’d known him so well after so long apart.
“I’m James! Why do you call uncle Bucky that?” James asked, wrinkling his nose like he’d smelled something foul and Péter gave him a very exasperated look. Natacha just looked like she was already tuning out their conversation and was just waiting for them to talk about something more interesting.
A small smirk tilted the corner of his mouth upward as he added, “Far less, I imagine, since I expect I’ll enjoy getting on my knees more now than I ever did before. There are certain holies I could see my way towards becoming devout for… but even so, it would be just another box for me to hide away in and that is where the line between living with yourself and living with your sensibilities ends.”
“She lied Tony! He and the Klein boys left for Poland hours ago!” Steve barked, his chest aching around the words. Tony’s face went white, horror creeping over his expression.
“They’ve been expecting you in Admiral Erhard’s office. Sub-Lieutenant Amsel will show you the way.” The officer nodded crisply to his comrade who gave Tony a nod of acknowledgment before clicking his heels and setting off, clearly expecting Tony to follow.
“Father would have told us if we were getting a new tutor, and Tony wouldn't just quit without saying goodbye."
Grig tried to reassure him that Tony was fine, but Steve knew to trust his instincts by now, and every instinct he had told him that something was wrong. He made sure the children were taken care of at home first, ignoring how frightened they looked at the news that Tony was missing, while he instructed Antonia to take them and meet him in the emperor’s wood if trouble should come in his absence.
! Why was he… why couldn’t he? He’d never told her about the suffering and death that awaited those sent to the camps, but she saw and observed so much. What if she kept doing this? What if she got caught!
Tony licked his lips, nerves dancing in his stomach suddenly. Stefen had been saying for weeks that Tony could do or have whatever he liked, but Tony had just figured the man was desperate not to be alone at that ghastly dinner and would have said anything to get Tony to agree to make the trip. He might change his mind once he heard what Tony wanted to do to the spare sitting room.
The smile felt frigid on his face even to him but Tony saw no other option but to smile, nod and say yes. It was a tried and true method for avoiding early conflict. Where was the Captain? He wasn’t sure how much more he could take of this man. If he was lucky he wouldn't have to see much of Hammer’s pompous ass.
"Vis, good to see you. You weren't followed?" Bucky asked after shaking the man's hand, peering past him toward the door which Lang had already shut behind the departing priest as if he half expected gestapo to come charging up the hall. Vis shook his head and answered Bucky in a low voice, "We were careful. I've brought the papers. Any word from the tailor?" He reached inside his breast pocket and withdrew a small packet of papers extending them towards Bucky who took them with a short shake of his head.
"Did I overlook some holiday?" Tony asked aloud, still puzzling why Stefen would have let them all go at once and determined not to let it go unquestioned. When Pepper didn't answer he thought she must not have heard, but when he turned back into the kitchen to see her filling up a large pot for heating on the stove, he couldn't help but notice the stiff way she held herself, or the tightness of her lips as the poignant silence stretched.
“We’re cutting it close taking the ‘bird over thirteen hundred miles as it is! Even with the weight we saved stripping the bombs. I – hey! What did I say about touching my tools Stark!”
“Yes, Sub-prior of course. Brother Aldrich was supposed to see to it, but Brother Antony insisted that you had instructed that he take over, only he has been nowhere to be found all day.” Nik closed his eyes, imagining himself far away from the monastery and upon the waves of the deep blue sea surrounding his home land, and not having to deal with a problem like Antony Stark. He'd loved the ocean as a boy, and even now as a man it was still his preferred place of refuge. Antony would have had something fresh to say about that no doubt, he did so like to liken Nik to a pirate.
Bucky was deep in his thoughts, but not so deep that he wasn’t paying keen attention to his surroundings. Letting your guard down for even a second was a good way to get ambushed. A flicker of color in the window of a shop snared his attention – he couldn’t say why. But he turned and slowed until he was facing the window, a giant poster with a photo of Stefen’s face had been freshly slapped.
First Lieutenant Dieter Stevens had been an officer in the state police, stationed in Salzburg for four years. He'd gotten his start after the war as a constable in the Municipal Police near his home town of Heiligenblut. Many of the comrades he'd served with had found it hard to return home after the fighting and assimilate back into a changed country, that many felt had betrayed the men giving their lives on the battle front with a politically expedient surrender. Turning to law enforcement had seemed like the natural conclusion. The only way forward in the new Austria.
“The Captain wanted to dismiss you yesterday, Herr Stark.” It wasn’t a surprise to Tony but still the words somehow managed to cause a flash of hurt.  Frau Hogan took a step closer to him, something passionate returning to her voice as she spoke lowly, for his ears alone. “I spoke up for you, because the children seem to like you and god knows they need a friend… But these are dangerous times and their best hope is in their father’s ability to protect them. Stefen cannot do that without your help.”
He took the seat across from where Bucky had sprawled out on the couch, feet propped up in Steve’s lap. Steve continued to sip on his drink watching as one of Tony’s dexterous hands unbuttoning his vest.
Tony nearly jumped out of his skin at the sound of the unexpected voice. He hoped that with his back turned Bakhuizen would not notice his struggle for composure.
No. He wanted his father to stay but that was wrong somehow, like wishing Peter wasn’t smart enough to go off to school.
He'd even read it to Stefen, who had asked about the faraway look in his eyes and Tony had digressed into stories about his mama and the adventures they’d take visiting her family in the Jewish quarter of the city. He found himself telling Stefen more than he’d ever told anyone, about his grandparents, and the aunt and uncle who lived close by but always just out of reach.
Steve checked into the hotel that night and stayed in, the letter continuing to burn a hole in his pocket and his anxiousness to be rid of it only growing. The next morning he woke late from a fitful sleep and after telephoning the house to check in with Virginia on the welfare of the children he made his way to the Cafe Mozart in leopoldstadt where he was to meet Bucky. The coffeehouse was crowded with noonday patrons when Steve walked in. As the bell above the door chimed a familiar face looked up and started at the sight of him.
It was a likely story, but the warden naturally wasn't buying a word of it. He was accusing the church of treason as well as sabotage, and threatening to have the abbey razed to the ground. Tony was thankful that their bets had paid off and the threat of undermining the Führer’s tentative negotiations with Rome had proved greater than the wardens need for immediate retribution. He could only imagine how much trouble the man was in with his superiors, who would want to find the culprits quickly before their actions weakened the power of the Reich in the public eye and encouraged more rebellion. Tony didn’t kid himself that the SS wouldn’t have every man they could spare out looking for the one insurgent they could identify: himself.
“My mother told me I’d understand one day,” Tony acknowledged with a sad smile. “But that took twenty years of grief and loss that could have been avoided if my father had just a little less pride. The only thing that makes it slightly bearable is knowing that they didn’t choose it. But what you’re doing right now Stefen is a choice.”
“I shall keep my men on their guard,” he finally allowed and Neuman smiled down at him with stiff satisfaction. It angered the lieutenant. Made him want to strike the other man. It would have been tantamount to suicide, but it would have felt clean.
Well the desk was the most obvious place to begin, Tony thought. He was thankful he did not meet more locks as he rifled through its drawers, discovering mostly log books tallying household expenses, staff salaries, and various literature from the children’s doctor and their previous governess.  In the bottom drawer there was paper, boxes of pencils and charcoals, as well as a few old gentlemen’s magazines proclaiming that a man’s cigar could tell you what kind of partner he’d make in business, which Tony snorted at and ignored much the same as he imagined Stefen did as the useless things had charcoal smudges all over their covers. He did give pause at the small worn leather book nestled between a block of canvas and the drawers edge, it’s place in the drawer and not on the shelf somehow granting it the importance the magazines so clearly lacked.
“She can’t!” Tony’s wild eyes darted to James and then to Ian. He clutched Maria closer. Maria let loose a small wail and Steve tensed, firmer in his command and more insistent as he reached for her.
Péter felt his new tutor’s eyes on his back as he got up and quickly departed from the table. Herr Stark’s watchful gaze reminded him a bit of Frauline Glass, whose furtive eyes had seemed never to miss a moment, unless of course they were too busy simpering at Péter’s father to notice much of anything. Women could be awefully silly when it came to that sort of thing. It was one of the reasons why Natacha always said that if it weren’t for Frau Hogan she’d be terrified of growing up.
“Wrap that.” Tony said to the injured man who was holding his bleeding arm. “The rest of you grab what you can find. We need to slow the water coming in.”
"I must admit, before I came, I had my reservations about undertaking the education of seven children, Captain.” He licked lips gone dry and took a small breath. “But they have proved to be fine students. I’m fond of them but… I worry for them."
That night when Tony told them it was time for bed and ushered them all up the ladder into the loft, Ian asked for a story. Natacha looked at him oddly and Ian felt his face turn pink – usually it was Artur or one of the other little ones who asked Tony for stories or songs to help them get to sleep. They helped Ian too, but he was a man of twelve now and he’d never have said so if he weren’t desperate.
"They helped me stuff newspapers in my shoes and Giselle painted stubble on my chin." Stefen drawled and Tony couldn't help but laugh, nearly choking on a swallow of stew. "It was Uncle Bucky that the youngest one, Lara, was sweet on. He told her he was going to come back from the war a hero and marry her."
Tony nodded. He’d take care of them. Never mind the necessity for his own survival he’d never intended anything else.
It was signed in bold calligraphy ‘Thorson Christian Donald Carlson Blake Axel, Crown Prince of Norway’ and stamped with the royal seal.
"Merry Christmas, all of you." Steve returned with a small smile, accepting the seat next to Julia that Bucky pointed out to him, his cheeks stuffed full of food.
“Cappuccino.” Tony insisted pertly and he didn’t miss the small huff Stefen let out under his breath or the roll of his eyes.
Philips cabin sat nestled on the side of the mountain, close to its highest point, in a pocket of thick trees. An unassuming little lodge. Kept up, but quiet and still in the way a house got when it spent long months without a resident.
now. Move!” At the command, James released his death grip and fell back. Uncle Bucky grabbed his hand and began shoving his way toward the back of the train, glancing over his shoulder every now and again to be sure the others were close behind.
They had a few pounds of the hirsch left, but they were on their last can of vegetables. Not that the children would miss the mushy and pickled part of their diets, but they couldn’t just survive on smoked meat without inviting something like scurvy.
“We’ll lean against the wall here.” Steve jerked his head toward the house and drew Tony with him by the elbow.
"You sure Captain Adventure can handle that kind of heat?" Bucky asked quietly and Steve looked up from his sketch, where he'd been filling in the brown of Captain Adventure's eyes, attempting to capture the right sense of warmth and intelligence.
“Oh Christ, you are a marvel,” Tony panted one hand falling from the headboard to thread through Steve’s hair as he slowly inched his way down the length of Tony’s cock. Tony could feel every spasm as his throat adjusted to the slow intrusion, even the way Steve’s mouth twisted with discomfort. He pulled on Steve’s hair, an unspoken suggestion to pull back, but there was a methodical determination to the way he held on with all his strength and worked to take one inch after the other. Pulling back suddenly when he needed to breath and diving back in almost before he’d taken a full breath.
Steve drew a measured breath and tried to unclench his jaw, frustration, fear, and anger warring within him.
A troubling growl rumbled in Bucky’s throat and Steve gripped his arm, shaking his head in warning. Now was not the time. Thor thankfully seemed to agree, waving away his brother’s warning and turning from the window with a prowl in his step, like a lion on the hunt.
of thousands, had fled to the U.K. for safety when Hitler rose to power and many more since the war started. Now they were all to be imprisoned indefinitely? Tony did not fool himself into thinking for a moment that the same governors who regarded them with universal suspicion would be fair or speedy with their judgments.
“Oh, between Stefen and James I wager I know you better than you think Herr Stark,” she returned with a wink, and after a quick glance to be sure that Frau Ursala was no longer in earshot she whispered with a small shudder, “That horrible woman is the chief marriage counselor at the registrar’s office in Vienna. She stamped me a half breed and told my husband he should divorce me.”
Tony admired the woman’s ability to deliver such a scathing set down behind neatly packaged politeness. He nodded in deference but did not apologize for the misstep. Pepper’s loyalty to her employer was admirable but something had clearly been
He could hardly make out what more was being said, but a moment later he could hear the distinct murmur of Harold’s voice and then an altogether too loud giggle from Tony.
Bucky thought it was just the mounting pressure from the tour and the mounting rescue attempt of the Dachau prisoners, but he thought differently when Lou finished wrapping up Péter’s gift and announced that the second item Steve had dropped off was also ready if he’d like to pay for it now. Bucky had known about the camera (apparently some friend of his at school had one and Péter mentioned often in his letters a growing interest in the things) but a second gift was news to him. So he’d been curious, and then utterly knocked off his chair when Lou had come from the back of the shop with a jewelry box.
Bucky paced anxiously, waiting for the priest to rouse from his bed and answer his door. Bonhef knew the procedure well, and would lead anyone with the correct password up to the attic without asking questions. It seemed like an eternity before there was a gentle knock on the door and the priest entered, Jann trailing behind him. She waited for the priest to shut the door behind himself before sweeping off her cap and letting her dark hair spill out around her ears. She smiled at Bucky, tired and worn at the edges but familiar and cheeky, and Bucky swore she’d never looked more beautiful. He crossed the room in a few quick strides and hugged her hard, but released her quickly when she gasped, flinching with discomfort.
“You’ve got to slow down.” Stefan corrected Tony’s hands again, indiscreet, nothing he hadn't done for all three of his boys save for the way his fingers seemed to linger on Tony’s. Alright so Tony’s intentions weren't a hundred percent altruistic but who could fault him? He could feel Stefen’s every shift behind him, close enough that he could smell the aftershave he had used that morning. A combination of talc and sandalwood and something distinctly Stefen.
me,” Tony snapped in reply, but he took a seat anyway. “You give me that whole song and dance about the danger of leaving the abbey and then you invite a Nazi for tea?”
Péter should know that it had never been like the stories they told about him. They weren't true at all, he was no hero.
He glanced down at the sketch of a young boy being lowered into the fiery depths of a volcano. In the next panel the boy's mother was pleading with the adventurer Stefen had created to feature as his title character in the series. He nodded.
“A more condensed syrup may help. We can use the sap. My worry is that the virus and the asthma are exasperating each other. We can’t treat one without considering the other, and we don’t have much to work with here.” Tony replied and Péter slowly nodded, understanding at once.
Only the one! And it wasn’t as if Tony’s secret were some small thing without much consequence attached.
"Hang on Ian, It's your birthday!" Péter announced, sounding as surprised by that fact as Ian looked, and Ian's cheeks flushed with something other than exertion. The younger boy shrugged mumbling, “Maria’s was last month. Everyone forgot.” Tony’s lips tightened into a scowl.
“They’ve shown great improvement.” Stefen answered tonelessly and Schmidt’s face spread into a humorless smile.
Péter slowed them only when they'd reached the main road, because if a patrol was nearby it wouldn't do to come running out and draw attention to themselves.
“Do they have any idea what they plan to do with the children?” Pepper asked and Harold glanced over his shoulder nervously before answering.
1.It's true Peggy is often sidelined or reduced to "poor dead girlfriend/wife" in fics, but there was no getting around that the Captain's wife had died. Not only that, our story demanded that she be one of the great loves of his life. Someone whose passing would leave him almost irreversibly devastated. We ship no one with Steve so much as we do Tony, but in a very close second (for me at least, I think Bucky wins out for TFIOT) is Peggy. The Sound of Music does also call for Steve to be courting a Baroness and while we toyed with the idea of having Peggy becoming the Baroness and Sharon stepping into the shoes of late wife, neither of us liked the idea of Peggy getting jilted very much. It just simply didn't work the same way. Peggy was the obvious winner of the dubious honor of being profound in death. *holds* Sorry Peg.
“Tony! How come Ian gets to sing a solo at the Christmas Pageant?” Artur whined from the back seat of the car. They were loading up to make their way into the city to practice with Nigel Frank for their recital. The mood in the schoolroom that morning had been dark and glum, the way that it had been every day since discovering that Péter and the Klein brothers had run away in the night. Artur and the two youngest didn’t quite understand what was so bad about Péter having gone to Poland, only that he’d left without telling anybody when he was supposed to go back to school and it had upset their father.
"If I wanted my son making all my mistakes, I'd be a fool Bucky." Stefen grumbled, reaching for the abandoned paper at the edge of his plate. He looked back at Péter who was staring back mulishly, lips clamped together tightly. "Where were you all day?"
“What was that?” He asked, and terror flashed through Péter’s eyes before he could stuff it down and insist that it was nothing.
“The little French boy outside, he was a nice touch.” Steve grunted and for the first-time Coulson’s lips stretched into a visible smile.
“Well, some people say it is important to listen to the wisdom of our mothers and learn from the follies of our fathers. It sounds like good advise so lets not question it.”
Tacha said they liked him and that he had to do something about it, and that the best thing to do was to either start walking one of them home or say he was saving himself for God and country. When Ian told his father that he looked startled before he laughed.
Stefen’s jaw clenched as the band began their first tune and Janneke’s lovely voice to fill the room. He looked tired to Tony and well in need of a sit down, but unless he was willing to cause a scene – or do something drastic like punch Charlotte’s old man right in his pointed nose like he was so clearly aching to do – he wasn’t going to get out of dancing with his fiancé at his own engagement party. Reputation for a dislike of dancing or no.
“That’s exactly what they’ll do.” That was the show. They’d pass them out to members of their party. People who would make sure they learned their lines, said all the right things, stamped all the rebellion out of them.
Peter was very quiet on the way to the station the morning he was to depart for Switzerland. The quiet was an unwelcome contrast to the chaos of that morning full of its goodbyes and last-minute tantrums on behalf of James – it was like James thought that Peter would hear his bad-tempered screaming and just up and decide not to go.
“Look at what Fraulein Braun gave me! She said it would bring me luck.” Maria explained gleefully as she bobbed up and down on her toes. He schooled his face as best he could, painfully locking away his panic.
But here they were, sending Himmler's very best rushing to the man's bedside to beat back his imminent demise, when command had sent Dvorak there with clear instructions to escort him back to base to resume active duty. Clearly not everyone was operating on the same page.
Harrison appeared off to his right and Bucky flashed him a grin just before he shot one of the soldiers rushing toward them out of the back of an armored truck. As they’d hoped, it looked like the motorcade had given up the idea of trying to get around them somehow and men were pouring out of the vehicles now, intent on eliminating them altogether. But Bucky and his men had the advantage of the trees and sooner or later they’d realize they’d have to venture deeper into the wood to avoid being picked off by enemy snipers. All Bucky needed to do was get to Stefen.
! Steve crashed to his knees as he went down, hands and knees scraping the pavement as he rushed to reach them, his heart still slamming away in his chest.
“Stark,” Bucky drew in a wheezing breath and closed his eyes. “That’s- I mean...you know what I mean.” he finished softly.
“Get moving. That morphine won’t last forever and Schmidt will be right behind me.” he heard Dvorak say as the man grabbed the back of his shirt and hauled him to his feet. Morphine? Steve struggled to understand what was happening even as Dvorak shoved him forward and he took his first stumbling steps.
Tony pressed his mouth to Stefen’s shoulder, debating on whether or not to keep pressing the subject.
He reminded himself every day and made a point to look at the card with the American lawyer’s name on it every morning just to start the day off on solid footing. Nevertheless, his incorrigible heart continued to long after the captain and fall further in love with the children, and his own bullheaded nature saw him reaching for the untenable: a place in Stefen’s life that could only be occupied by a lover.
That snap had come from outside and not from within. He’d broken the rope tying him to the post, he realized dizzily. For all the good it did him. Steve was too weak to move so much as a muscle. He couldn’t even lift his own neck enough to breathe free of dirt and mud. He lay there on the ground, gasping and huffing desperately for air as he waited for the woman to strike.
He rifled in his drawer, pulling out a pen and piece of parchment. Pen poised Steve searched for the right words to write to Father Farkas. Though he thought he’d been perfectly clear regarding his needs, apparently he’d been grievously misunderstood.
“Billy?” Bucky questioned Stefen, further confirming Tony’s leap of logic and Stefen nodded. Bucky released a small huff of breath, but his brow furrowed thoughtfully.
Bitterness settled glum in Charlotte's stomach. She was confident of her ability to handle them, but she hadn’t assumed that she would have to do it all on her own.
“Forget him! Forget him you fools! After Rogers!” Schmidt paused to scream into his radio, and that was all Dvorak needed. Dashing out from his cover he fired two shots. One for Helene and one for Rene.
James found his tongue, glaring up at Tony with tears beginning to slide down his cheeks as he sputtered, “Y-you…you can’t do this to me!”
It was dizzying trying to keep up with the boy’s chatter. Steve caught himself wishing that Bucky had come home with him. It had always been easier to arrange his thoughts against Bucky’s stubborn opposition, even when his advice stung. Sometimes especially then.
“There’s every reason.” Steve bit out. More reason than Sam could possibly know. “We’ve no idea when they’ll close the borders.”
He stood there, a torrent of emotions rushing through him and tried to catch his breath. Alright, alright, don't trip, you’ll spill it all out. He chuckled mirthlessly.
The children in question looked at each other uncertainly but Tony could see the idea taking root. Péter shifted forward in his seat, giving Tony more attention than he had in the last twenty four hours alone. This was good. He could work with this.
"Ian, you get the ropes ready. Péter and I'll start on the lower branches" Tony instructed, waving tiredly with the ax at Ian, who'd waited patiently off to the side with the sled out of harm's way. But when Ian pulled Phillips’ sled up beside the felled tree, Péter tapped him on the shoulder and handed the younger boy the ax, saying, "Here, you have a go at it. I'm better with knots."
The woman’s muffled scream aborted as his arm pressed against her neck. She stared at him with wide terrified eyes already full of tears. They weren’t so cloudy that he couldn’t see his reflection in them, looming over her like the beast from all her nightmares. He hated her a little in that moment. This gadje girl with her soft buttermilk skin, who stood safely on the same ground his brother had been chased from, fleeing for his life.
because he saw that as his responsibility. He took careful notes on all their lessons, he was the first to notice if the little girl’s shoes came untied and the first to stoop down and help them with them.
Dvořák had heard that the assault men in the Gebirgsjäger treated rank differently. So far in the mountains away from any sort of high command, their leaders often had to make their own decisions independent of higher superiors. Back then, Rogers had been used to doing simply whatever he thought was right and had only limited respect for rank structure.
"Here," he said, thrusting the small suitcase he’d brought against Clint’s chest, the boy’s arms coming up in instinctively to hold it. "They're going to check us for weapons and before you blow the family jewels try this. Trust me it is better."
“Aunt.” Tony chuckled, trying unsuccessfully to extract himself from her grasp. “Antonia, I can’t breathe.”
He’d get so worried that he wouldn’t eat, sleep, or talk, which would make him sick and Mama would have to call the doctor. No matter what Dr. Erskine said or tried Ian never perked up till his father was home again.
Steve’s face was on fire and he rushed to interrupt Bucky, grinding out in Romany, “-this is not about the baroness, you idiot!
“I hear you say something like that again I’ll smack you. Understand me čhavo?” Bucky growled at him. “Damn it, Péter you don’t know the first thing about what he’s sacrificed for you, so that you don’t grow up like we did.”
“Shhh. Don’t worry about that right now. Just breathe.” Tony hushed him, hands holding him firmly. It wasn’t Tony shaking he realized. It was him.
Steve was on high alert, but he had not expected that ‘anything’ would come in the form of Tony’s cousin Grig. He showed up at the house that evening, late to dinner. The family had already mostly finished eating, all except Antonia who was too worried to do more than pick at her plate between watching the clock and bickering with her husband.
His heart fractured, Tony gestured sadly with his free hands for the group to come to him and the children circled around him, pressing close.
It was inevitable perhaps that a small part of him jumped in hope every time he caught a glimpse of dark hair and a quick smile. But the disappointment each time was sour, and not helping him any. Tony wasn't there, wasn’t
“Then there will be war. I’m not afraid of it. Are you? Péter you’ve always had more courage than anyone else I know. We’re not boys anymore. Are you really going to let your father make a coward out of you?”
“Historically Great Brittan has had the naval advantage in sheer numbers. Hitler intends to overthrow that balance and having been on a Stark made vessel, I can assure you that this is something that you do not want. The Navy suffered after the untimely death of their master ship builder during the great war. Had he lived perhaps that war would have ended differently. All the information I’ve received indicates that the company has stabilized and is eager to meet these new demands.”
“Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, assist me in my last agony,” Tony finished for him, voice shaking as the man’s eyes slipped closed.
His eyes met Tony’s in the dark just as Natacha’s frightened voice came from his left, asking what they were going to do. She was grabbing his sleeve and he let go of Sara’s shoulders to grasp her hand and in as calm a voice as he could manage answered, “It’s all right, I’ve got a plan. You have to trust me; do you trust me?”
“If I’m not a good boy you mean?” Tony shot back, accusing. He was breathing heavily, his breaths sounding ragged to his own ears but he couldn’t let this go. Couldn’t let Niklas Farkas get away with thinking that Tony didn’t know the truth. “It was not my choice to come here! I never wanted to get caught up in your war games Farkas! That was you and that was Hughard! You made Yinsen a promise you couldn’t keep and you sent him to the lion’s den!”
The click of the lock turning filled the hall like the toll of a bell and relief flooded through Steve’s whole body.  Steve gripped the knob, turning it and opening the door slowly.
“Captain Rogers and Herr Bakhuizen I presume?” a voice inquired behind them and Stefen’s neck prickled, his whole body going suddenly tense. Still he turned slowly, almost idlily. The man who had approached them immediately struck Steve as non-assuming. Slight of build with thinning medium brown hair, he wore a well pressed suit suitable for any man of business but to Steve his grey eyes looked uncommonly calculating. His gut told him this was the man they’d been waiting for but he’d not seemed all that surprised by Bucky’s presence there and that was alarming. It meant they’d been watching Stefen far longer than he’d anticipated.
He grimaced, disgust turning in his stomach. It wasn't the first time it had happened after a dream like that. He knew, intellectually, that when the blood was high a man couldn’t always choose how his body reacted, had said as much to embarrassed men under his command in the past, but it never failed to make him feel sick when it came to his own body.
"I do." Tony finally offered in reply with a dry swallow, forcing his hand to steady as he raised the knife, and began to peel once more. “Apparently more than my own life.”
Thankfully, Coulson didn’t mince words. He reached inside the briefcase at his feet and pulled from it a little leather-bound book, which he set carefully in his lap before he looked back up at them.
It wasn’t the explanation that drained Tony’s anger and left him feeling wrung, because that remained ridiculous (the idea that Artur could hurt his sister in such away over something as silly as a pet frog he’d owned for all of a few hours infuriating). It was the way Artur sobbed the word leave as if all he knew was the sting of abandonment (as if everyone he’d ever loved had left him).
Fascinated Tony turned to the pictures. Most of them where formal photos, depicting the different divisions Captain Rogers had served in. Tony peered closer looking for Rogers among them. He’d heard so many stories about the man since the Great War - about how he’d joined the army a sickly youth and grown into the exploits and stature of a modern Hercules - that he was halfway expecting his younger self to be all of three feet tall. While it was true that the young soldier near the far right of the lineup was indeed small he was not as small as legend would have you believe.
Bobby was the first one to spot the Rogers car and he nudged Harry. The two boys stood up straighter and waved at him. Peter gulped, his hand shaking as he reached for the door handle. He paused without turning it, breathing shallowly.
As Bruce set about untying her, Tony began clearing away the bramble and netting Bucky had used to hide her from view, grunting with the effort. The others helped, including Bucky who stubbornly insisted on moving his arm despite several entreaties to stay back by the others. Tony worried about the wan color he’d taken on by the time they'd finished.
"Don't talk garbage or I’ll do it again!" He admonished, and James glared hotly at him, but to everyone’s surprise he quelled his reply when Charlotte cleared her throat and gave them each a very stern look.
"A home somewhere else?"  Pietro cut him off, his dark head of hair whipping up as he glared furiously at Péter. The other boy leaned over and spat violently on the ground before he continued. "Is that what they’re calling the camps? Is that what you’d call a place where men and women are piled on top of each other like logs, where they are forced to work until they drop, the women are raped and young and old fester in their own shit until they die of disease? That sounds like a home to you Nazi boy?!"
And they did. From the elevator ride down to the lobby to the carriage ride (Maria begged as soon as she heard the horses tinkling harness) over to the small intimate shops near the Old University. It was easy to fall in love with the old buildings, with their scarred walls (many that had survived the middle ages) and baroque finishings. It was a place with history echoing in every footstep, like an old mother full of stories just waiting for eager ears.
As the other children promised to work very hard and pay close attention to their music lessons, Péter stayed quiet, his brow furrowed in thought. The intense focus of his stare made Stefen's neck itch.
For a time Tony and the children just lay, letting the sun shine down on them and the sweet summer breeze tickle their faces. Eventually though stomachs began to grumble, reminding them of their hunger and one by one the children attacked the spread of food like the seven ravenous little monsters they were and Tony grinned.
"Christ!" Tony cursed, heart pounding and palm stinging as he struggled to wrench the tool away from his attacker. The boy was strong for his slight build and quick thinking too. In a flash of movement he'd let go of his weapon to send Tony sprawling back on his ass. In seconds he had wedged himself between his sister and Tony, kicking the older man sharply in the gut with the heel of his foot to drive him further away.
“Clever girl,” he muttered with a half-smile, because despite everything he still felt proud of how she used her sharp wits. He’d probably still be proud when he was swinging by his neck, and if that didn’t say how utterly attached Tony had become to the Rogers children he didn’t know what would.
“We’d only just married, before the Germans came. My silly idea. I thought it would make us stronger somehow, facing the future together. But it was divorce quietly or lose his job and possibly face imprisonment for betraying his blood; Hank is very attached to his work.”
Tony had to clench and unclench his hands, forcing a deep breath in and out before he was calm enough to answer.
She was still a child, he reassured himself. God in heaven, could she just be safe from at least that one thing!
Steve strode to the door and jerked it open and straightened to his full height, filling the frame in a way he was sure blocked the captain’s view of his family.
Janneke cleared her throat poignantly and Bucky’s eyes flickered to the gleeful faces on the children and he sighed.
“I'm off to Vienna in the morning and that's the way it is.” As he said it he caught Stark’s gaze from across the table.
A tremor ran through his last words and Tony reached with his right hand to cover Stefen’s with his and squeezed. Stefen’s lips curled in a small grateful smile and he brought Tony’s knuckles up close to his lips and kissed, sending a slow wave of warmth through Tony’s body that was better than hot coco and warm blankets.
He was standing at the bedside of a dark-skinned man along with two other men in lab coats. Tony was relieved to find that the trio fit the descriptions he’d been given of the two doctors, Leshnerr and Richter, as well as the prisoner Lucas Deurr.
“Everyone's fine." He replied, grateful that his voice had returned to steadiness. "How are the Osborns?”
Herr stark. He's even gone so far as to tear the curtains. They’ll have to be replaced. And it's not the first time either is it, master Ian?”
“He can’t say it himself right now, so I will. I know I am a poor substitute, but please hear me out. Your father’s only hope for you in this life is that you get to cherish it without carrying the world on your shoulders. I want the same for you, and I hope you will think on it and decide you want that too. Darling, you deserve more goodness than a single life can hold.”
“I want to sleep with you Tony!” Artur insisted clutching onto Tony’s leg, and Sara didn’t need words to make her views known, because as soon as the word bed had come up she’d latched onto the other one like a limpet and had yet to let go.
He was determined to find real answers now, and no longer willing to believe that Stanislov had been completely forthcoming with him regarding their fate. It was more than time that Tony take his life back into his own hands. Farkas had admitted that Tony’s father had put things away for his future, and Tony wanted to know the full details (because he wasn’t about to leave his fate in the one eyed Abbots hands either).
Robert spotted him first and gave Tony a polite nod of recognition. Harry bid him good evening. Johan twisted to see who had caught the other’s attention and quickly gave up interest with a bored sneer when he recognized who it was.
“You can’t stop him.” Bucky warned. “If he loves something the stupid punk just goes for it, face first, damn the consequences. Hopeless romantic and fool extraordinaire, my fucking prala.” Charlotte let her hand fall, sympathy bleeding away, her face hardening into something brittle? Had she really not seen it for herself yet, Bucky wondered, or was she just trying her hardest to stay in denial?
Scott, hopping down from the truck bed shook his head, staring at the bodies of the two men lying beside the car and glancing at Bucky with a kind of wary awe.
"Stefen, I know how much you care for James," Charlotte's voice was softer now, some of the warmth back in her eyes as she looked at Natacha's father with a piteous expression. "But you can't just leave. You have orders. You know what they’ll do if you don’t follow them."
Bucky had found him that morning already neck deep in intel. He only knew Stefen had made it to bed at all the night before because he’d ushered him there himself. He wasn’t surprised by it. They left for Vienna the next day, and there was still a lot to put together before then.
Steve woke with a jerk, sitting up off the floor. He felt something laying over his legs, and panicked, grabbing the thing twisted around his legs and shoving it off of himself. He dragged in a breath, but the taste of blood was sharp in his mouth. He jerked his head around, wild eyes scanning for danger.
Hammer gasped like a dying fish and the air crackled between Tony and Rogers like a sky full of fireworks. The Captain looked as if he wished to throttle him and Tony’s pulse leapt, though he wasn’t sure it was all for appropriate reasons. He had a nasty habit of poking sleeping giants (Farkas always said so) and never seemed to learn his lesson.
Tony expected it when Péter looked excited but it was James who lit up like someone had declared Christmas was coming twice that year.
His eyes scanned the dark hall methodically, leaving no shadow unpenetrated. It was a quick check of all the rooms, a count of bodies, and then back to do another patrol of the grounds.  He opened the door of the room the three boys shared and counted three bodies asleep in their beds. Two blonde heads and one red. He gritted his teeth. It would be better if they were all in one place. There were too many rooms. Too many places for an enemy to hide for Steve’s peace of mind; but he’d promised Tony that he’d get the children back on their routine.
The children had already finished dinner by the time that Steve and Charlotte made it back to the villa. The pair found them all in the sitting room with Bucky, the television playing a news reel on low while the children played or read quietly around him.
Ian turned at the sound of Tony's voice to find their tutor leaning against the door frame watching him with a strange look on his face. Tony was thinking again, those thoughts that made him stay in the garage hours on end, the ones that made lessons hard to follow and Tony brittle at meal times.
“As any sane man would be.” Bruce interjected. “And if it wasn’t the Captain who roped you into it, then I have to wonder why you’d want to put yourself at such risk.”
This time it was Brother Tiberius, the monastery treasurer, who was hurrying towards where Nik had been standing with brother Filip, a furious step to his gate. Filip Coulson’s visage remained smooth and unruffled despite the dark cloud the younger monk was undoubtedly bringing with him, but that was Fil for you- religiously unruffled.
Steve let the jacket fall around his arms, breath constricting in his chest as he watched Tony reach for his tie and slowly begin untying the knot. Once he’d managed to free him of that it was only moments before he had the silk shirt open and was pressing kisses against the flushed skin above the undershirt.
”… due to the fact that they sometimes commit serious crimes because of their innate nature and methods of organization and due to the possibility that among them there are elements capable of carrying out anti-national activities, it is indispensable that all Gypsies are controlled … It is ordered that those of Italian nationality, either confirmed or presumed, who are still in circulation are to be rounded up as quickly as possible and concentrated under vigorous surveillance in a suitable locality in every province … apart from the more dangerous or suspicious elements who are to be sent to the islands or regions…”
He looked at her, hoping the way felt wasn’t in his eyes, hoping for her sake that she couldn’t see how close he was to starting to scream with no intention of stopping when the back door opened, Harold coming in from the outside with a blast of cold air.
“I was just telling Ian that I was about his age when I learned to swim. You wouldn’t mind helping me teach the boys would you?”
The rattle of dishes startled Steve out of his dark memories. He glanced up as Kurt placed a cup and saucer down in front of him.
Good Simone might marvel at the saints who lay in their cushioned beds, in their bejeweled robes, but that didn't mean he had any great desire to join them.
“It is good they come to me. We’ve made such a terrible mess of our bloodlines, there’s any number of closets for skeletons to hide in.” She tutted, looking away from where Janneke was holding court and giving Tony a slow thorough appraisal. “Even the great Hughard Stark had a few of his own.”
They sang of their favorite things, girls in white dresses and their blue satin sashes. They sang of the spring and summer rolling by, full of mishap and laughter.
Engelszell abbey consisted of one rectangular building, a modest but beautifully constructed steeple a simple steeple, and a long short rectangular building at near the back where Tony knew the monks would live and study.  The whole campus sat at the bottom of the tree covered hills, bare limbed and covered lightly with freshly fallen snow, blue mountains rising above the reach of their tallest branches. It was surrounded by snow covered pasture that ran right up to the river, where a small well-worn dock had been built for the brothers to fish.
"I mean he probably knows where you've been. He's not going to stick around waiting for the shoe to drop." Bucky insisted as gently as he could manage because Steve was taking this whole thing much harder than he’d expected. Bucky privately didn’t think he was that lucky but he hoped he was right. Stark had proven himself scrappy and the first rule of being scrappy was being smart. The second was saving your own skin, which was pretty much the first rule. With any luck Stark had packed his bags as soon as Steve had left to meet Coulson and was long gone by now. Of course, then there was Steve who was a rule breaker on the best of days Bucky thought with tired amusement. With Bucky’s luck the idiot would just do something crazy like go after him.
Stane blinked, clearly surprised by the question. “He didn’t say why he wanted to come here,” he said after a moment. “But when I found out he was in residence, I decided to come visit.”
“In a moment, Edwin,” Tony said, glancing at Natasha. Edwin nodded in understanding and went inside to give them some privacy.
Bucky was too weak to explain, breath short from the exertion of speaking so much already, so the discussion was tabled as Steve patiently spooned the broth into his mouth; when the bowl was finally empty, Bucky lay back against the bed with a long sigh, mumbling something but already falling asleep again from the herbs in Ana’s tisane. Tony stared at him with bemusement as he slept, then shook his head and stood. “I wonder why Bucky would think that
Stark’s hands stilled, and as he looked up Steve could tell that he had some cutting remark planned, but the words seemed to die on Stark’s tongue when he met Steve’s eyes. Steve felt naked under Stark’s thoughtful gaze, but he lifted his chin and refused to look away.  “And what if the person you gave your oath to is faithless and untrue? Does that relieve you of your vow?” Stark said after a long moment. “What if Grand Master Molay and other leaders of your Temple were in fact practicing heresy?”
Steve spent a great deal of effort to keep his face neutral when his stomach was churning and heart was pounding with some emotion he couldn’t name. “That’s fine,” he repeated. He picked up his fork again, forcing himself to continue eating so Tony would know how fine everything was. He could feel Tony’s eyes on him, so he kept his motions light and easy even though he wanted to drive his eating knife through the wooden table.
Natasha frowned thoughtfully and started to pace, ticking off her thoughts on her fingers. “So Stane gets involved with this cult somehow. They want the Temple’s relics, but the Templars don’t allow anyone access except a select few.”
“Follow me,” Tony whispered, voice almost noiseless. They removed their shoes so they wouldn’t be heard as they crept through the dark corridors, having wrapped their weapons in cloth to dampen all noise. Tony led them by memory and prayed that Stane hadn’t done any redecorating since the last time they’d been here, feeling their way around furniture and through doorways that were barely discernible patches of black on black. It wasn’t until they were approaching the cellars, when the light from outside vanished completely, that Tony took the risk of lighting a candle.
“I think you have come to me because you are bearing a heavy burden,” Tony said, making sure his voice was measured even though his heart was pounding. “You are seeking release, are you not?”
Tony’s enthusiasm was strong enough that Steve didn’t have the energy to argue with him, especially since he didn’t have a good reason to protest. Tony went inside to negotiate for a place to sleep while Steve took care of the horse and wagon.
The rest of dinner was spent in oppressive silence, until Steve bid Stark good evening and spent the rest of the night sleepless in his room.
“Then where does the Church get the right to send us off to fight and die in their Holy Wars? It doesn’t say, ‘thou shalt not kill unless it’s Muslims, then it’s ok.’ And in which commandment does it tell you who to love? If He felt it was that important, why didn’t he make it a commandment? Why doesn’t Jesus ever say anything about it?” Bucky challenged. “I think it’s because maybe God doesn’t care who you love as long as you aren’t hurting anyone.”
“Well done.” Stark moved away for a moment and when he returned, he set a wide, flat pillow on the floor in front of Steve. It was a prayer pillow, and Steve started to move to kneel on it when Stark stopped him with a hand on his shoulder. The hand slid from his shoulder to the nape of his neck, spreading heat in its wake, and then there was pressure, forcing Steve’s head down. “Now it’s time for you to prostrate yourself before your Lord,” Stark ordered, voice low and rough, and Steve shuddered as he obeyed, resting his forehead and hands on the pillow. He felt exposed and vulnerable in the chill, dim air of Stark’s chambers, naked and achingly hard; he imagined he must look like some sort of pagan offering presented for Stark’s pleasure. He closed his eyes and his hands closed into fists as the thought made heat flare under his skin. “Before we begin, do you swear that you are giving yourself willingly, and with your whole heart?” Stark asked.
As soon as Steve realized what Tony was asking he felt his face get red and was glad that it was too dark to see. “Just a friend,” he said stiffly. “He’s not – I mean –“
“She’s covering our tracks,” Tony said shortly when he saw Steve looking around for her. “She took the horses to try to lead any pursuers in the wrong direction.”
“Lord Stark,” the footman said as he opened the front door, clearly surprised and strangely, dismayed, to see him. “We, ah, we didn’t expect you so soon.”
“You are a prideful man,” Stark agreed. He walked behind Steve and the whip followed him, a brief caress against his back before it fell away. There was a sharp crack as Stark flicked it once, and Steve bit back a whimper. “Are you ready?”
When he looked up, Steve saw Bucky studying him thoughtfully. When Bucky took a breath to speak, Steve braced himself, but all Bucky said was, “Well, I suppose you would know,” and then turned to speak to the man on his other side, leaving Steve to wonder what exactly he meant by that.
” Tony said, pressing a hand to his side where the laughter had caused a jab of pain. “With paint and other artistry. Like the beggars use to look more miserable.” Steve visibly relaxed, and Tony saw the gleam of the fire along his jaw as he nodded. “However, there is one thing that you need to understand that is critically important.”
“You and I are moving on to the next safe house,” Stark said. “This place is good for a short stay, but it is still too close to Paris. I was thinking of going to the coast, maybe down south.”
Tony thought about that. “That's true,” he said thoughtfully. “For some reason when most people disapprove of me it makes me angry, but when Rodgers does it, it's just entertaining.”
“Do you want to?” For the first time, Steve saw uncertainty in Stark’s eyes, vulnerability in his voice.
“Are there many songs about the Iron Cardinal?” Steve asked, suddenly realizing why Tony had been so shifty a few days ago about where Steve had heard about the Iron Cardinal.
“Even if he mentions James.” Tony prayed that the reminder would help Steve appreciate the stakes. Over the past week, Bucky had managed to do short walks around the property and his bruises had started fading from purple to a sickly mottled green; he was healing well but was still a telling testament to what Stane was capable of.
Steve was silent for a while, trying to understand how that could be true. “How?” he finally asked. “What could the King do with them that is so dire?”
“Oh my God,” Steve said in shock. It wasn’t that he hadn’t believed Tony all those times that he’d said people were searching for him, but it was another thing to see the evidence of that before his eyes. “We’re rescuing them too, right? We can't leave them here.”
The image of Tony surrounded by a bunch of toddlers trying to scam him for treats made a smile tug on Steve’s lips. “Is that what you like about them? The honesty?”
In the bedroom and out of Tony’s sight, Steve raked his hands through his too-long hair, suddenly realizing that they were shaking. He was still shocked by his own daring at saying the words aloud but also by how good it felt. It felt like he’d been at confession, like pulling out a splinter or lancing a wound. He felt lighter, freer, and, despite everything, was struck by the sudden urge to laugh.
he'd told Steve in a fit of hurt anger. Now, not even two days later he was talking like there was some kind of future where they were still on speaking terms.
Bucky bowed over Stark’s hand, brushing his lips respectfully across Stark’s ring of office. “Since we were children,” he said. “We joined the Order together and have been to hell and back. He’s like a brother to me.”
“Well, he’s going to be asleep for at least ten hours. I recommend putting him on a ship at Calais.”
James frowned as he considered the question. “You mean, what if the grail only heals some people? Like it chooses who to heal?”
“If I say no, would you do it by yourself?” Tony said dryly, and Steve didn’t disagree. “We need to make a plan, though. Not here, though. We’ll finish eating first.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve finally managed to say, having practiced the words in his head all morning. “I know it’s not…I know it doesn’t make up for what I said, but for what it’s worth, I am sorry.”
Stark’s words punched the air from Steve’s lungs, the thought thrilling and terrifying and unbearably arousing, and then with a cracked moan Steve was spilling over Stark’s fingers in a hot rush, hips jerking and fingers digging into Stark’s arms as he climaxed; the waves of pleasure that broke over him feel like they were drawn all the way from his toes, leaving him feeling washed clean and limp as a wet rag. Stark released him right before he became too sensitive, and pulled out a handkerchief to clean them both off. Steve tried to sit up from where he was slumped against Stark, but Stark tugged him back down and Steve was glad of it, feeling like his thoughts had been washed out to sea with the force of his release. They breathed together for a while until Steve stirred, feeling like he was waking up from a long sleep. This time when he straightened, Stark let him, then stood, pulled him to his feet, and helped him redress. As Steve buckled his sword belt and slung his shield across his back, Stark leaned against his desk and watched.
“The charges of heresy that your friend mentioned are patently ridiculous.  I’ve never met a more uptight band of Christian men in my entire life; I think the vast majority of you might faint dead away if confronted with a true heresy.” Steve frowned at that but was unsure what to protest. “No, what this is likely about the millions of francs that the King owes the Templars that he doesn’t want to repay.  The King might think he’s above the law, but he should never get pretensions that he is above his debts or, for that matter, above the Church.”  Stark shuffled some of his papers together and stood, which made Steve realized that in the distance bells were starting to ring for matins.  “I have business to attend to, but when Brother Peter returns tell him that you are to be given a room until this business is straightened out.”
Tony frowned as he folded the papers and set them aside. “What do you mean?” he asked as he handed over the instructions and information that he’d prepared for Sister Virginia and Captain Rhodes. He also pulled out a sheet of parchment and quickly wrote out the information that he’d gotten from the innkeeper for Natasha to take back with her for analysis.
” Tony bit out. He took another drink, the light of the fire glinting through the dark bottle. “The truth is, I never wanted to join the Church. My father forced me into it after a youthful indiscretion. I only agreed because I thought I would be protecting someone I loved, but after I took my vows that I learned that my lover had taken a small fortune from my father and moved to Marseille.”
"Oh, we have plans for Stane," Natasha said, voice hard. "He won't get away with this. We're just trying to track down his associates first."
Natasha snorted. “He may think you’re a dirty sinner, but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t want to do any dirty sinning with you.”
Steve was silent for a long time, thinking about that. “So why send the relics to him after you left Paris?”
“Until now,” Stark echoed. “You’re just one fugitive Templar Knight, and normally Phillip could be convinced to look the other way, but…”
Bucky laughed at that, as he was meant to, and then they were bidding each other goodnight. But the question lingered in Steve's mind off and on for days afterwards; he had the feeling that if he could answer that one question, the rest of that infuriating man would make sense.
“The grail I used when my horse came up lame with an inflamed hoof; I was miles from town and desperate because the King’s men were on my trail. And this one, the crown of thorns, I used on the man that I entrusted with the relics.” Bucky let the piece of paper fall to his lap and pushed it towards Tony, clearly growing tired. “No one of evil intent should get their hands on these,” he said emphatically. “Because with them, they could destroy the world.”
“Is Paris under attack?” Steve hesitated, glancing around the sparsely decorated room that had been his home for the past year.  He was accustomed to traveling light, so after a moment he reached for his sketchbook, an illustrated copy of the Bible that was the only thing he owned of his father’s, and his mother’s wedding ring that he often wore on a chain under his armor.  He slung his shield over his back and his sword around his waist.  “I’m ready,” he said, and Bucky gestured for him to follow as they rushed through the halls of the keep towards the stables.
“Do you feel absolved?” Stark asked when Steve was dressed again. His dressing gown was wrapped around him once more, tidy and straight as if nothing had happened, while Steve felt like he’d been taken apart and put back together again as someone completely different. “Did you find the relief you were looking for?”
“Was your decision to become a priest part of this pulling away?” he asked. “Did you do it to spite him?”
“Bucky?” Steve turned from where he had been staring out of the window of the infirmary and sat down on the edge of Bucky’s bed. “I’m here. How are you feeling?”
“No.” Stane leaned over Tony's shoulder to tap the picture of Barnes, and Tony barely managed not to flinch away from Stane’s proximity. “I have this man, but he refuses to give up their location. We think perhaps this other man might know where they are, but I haven’t found him yet.”
There were no chairs in the room but the table was low enough to be used by someone sitting on the floor, so Stark sat on it and put the candle behind him so the light wouldn’t show under the door. “No unusual visitors?”
Steve stepped back just in time for Tony to be almost tackled again, this time by Natasha. Only instead of being followed with a kiss Tony got a tirade. “I cannot
“Here, my friend,” Ana said as Steve helped Bucky sit up so that she could carefully bring the mug to Bucky’s mouth for him to sip carefully, since his hands were still too thickly bandaged to hold anything. “There,” she said when he finished. “I imagine you’re hungry, too.” When Bucky nodded, she stood. “I will bring you dinner."
She put her hand on his arm, trying to turn him around, but he shrugged her off. “Then I’m going with you.”
Tony waited silently and Steve tried again, clearing his throat. Even still his voice came out like rust. Tony closed his eyes as Steve repeated familiar words, reminding them both of his convictions and the ideals he would always be willing to put down his life for, only opening them to turn and pin Steve with his gaze once more when Steve had finished. The look in his eyes made Steve’s breath catch in his throat.
"What's wrong?" He asked with a frown and Ian turned his head toward him, his mouth setting in a grim line.
“The legal one will be leaving Genoa and headed to Shanghai at the end of the week; but no one thinks it is wise for refugees to wait on legal means. Every day the German’s put more pressure on our government to hand us over to them. They’d never send Italians of course, but all these poor people who come here to get away, they are vulnerable.”
She felt a flicker of regret, at having to destroy his illusions, but there was no helping it. No way to make this easier for any of them.
At that very moment, with a clack of heels against the polished floor, a tall woman with a businesslike air came bustling into the hall from the direction that Captain Rogers had disappeared in. Her hair was not as red as Natacha’s but she was far more freckled, the becoming spots dotting her pretty nose like pepper in a way that Tony was sure her beaus had adored. It was a shame that she was already married. A dalliance here or there might have made his stay here less stressful on his nerves.
"I appreciate that Natacha," he was sure to tell her, so incredibly fond in that moment he had a hard time figuring out how to tell her, besides to smile and hope she knew.  “But don’t risk your health. Short visits, and if they need anything longer or show signs of worsening you fetch Virginia immediately. You hear me?”
“We’ve got a truck and ammunition. Wolfe will handle the diversion but we’ll only have a window of thirty minutes to get in and get out. Coulson’s got their paperwork sorted with the British embassy. They’ll have full asylum if we can just get them on British soil.”
"Why on earth would you? Perish the thought," she scoffed with a scathing laugh in reply. She did not want to be pitied, especially by Virginia Hogan. A housekeeper of all things. A woman who would leave no mark on the world besides what squalling infants she could drop into it, who would be tossed about and battered by the whims of governments and powerful men for the rest of her life with no means to rise above it.
“Do remember that Dr. Erskine has not come by in months Herr Hammer. It is hard to injure a man you haven’t tended to in over half a year.” She snapped, flicking her gaze to the butler for the briefest of moments before turning back to Dr. Fischer. “It is very kind of the army to send you, Herr doctor, but I wish you would have sent word ahead. I’m afraid today is not a good day for the major to have visitors.”
"Sam's family came from Deutsch-Ostafrika. His grandfather migrated here from Berlin as a young man.” Stefen explained stiffly. “Though Sam and the rest of his kin were born here in Austria, prejudices being what they are can make finding fair wages difficult. I was happy to help him."
The old man tripped again, the bucket of water clearly too heavy for him. It slipped from his gnarled hand and fell to the cobblestones with a thud and a clatter sending sudsy water spilling over the street and splashing their shoes.
Ian watched him work, eyes stinging for a completely different reason now, but it was easier this time to take a deep breath and just keep breathing.
Now… Steve didn’t know what to do. How was he meant to keep Tony safe? Hell, he could barely get Tony to stay in the same room! Was he going to have to chain him to the furniture to keep him from endangering himself? Going to Dachau with the resistance, running off the way Péter had done…
“What is it he is supposed to have done?” Fil asked with the patience of a saint and he and Nik waited as Tiberius puffed up like a posturing bird and launched into another tirade.
“Will the snow start melting soon do you think?” James would like to have the sled perfect before they used it, but it was okay if they had to wait until spring came to finish it. Building was not about how fast something happened, but about what you wanted to happen. James liked that about it. When he was building things, he could do it his own way at his own pace. And Tony was always happy to see the things he’d made. James might have liked that part most of all. He didn’t need Tony to like the things he made of course; James didn’t need anybody but himself. But it was nice.
On the little stage the little goatherd danced away with a trio of goats and Tony could be heard hissing under his breath for Artur to lower the next backdrop and cueing Sara to animate the prince.
His eyes immediately flew to Susann, who was watching him closely, and then to Tony who was paying attention to neither of them. If he’d seen he didn’t show any sign of it.
“Hunting? “Tony asked into the silence. Steve resisted the urge to bury his head in his hands. He leaned forward watching the door creek nearly closed.
Bucky'd had Steve’s back from the first day they’d met. Sara and her odd little family had settled outside a new town, joining up with a small caravan of Bayesh, thankful at not being turned away when they could not fail to note her husband was
Slender hands reached down and tugged roughly at the hem of her skirt, hiding her banged up knees from view. Steve looked up, his eyes catching hers. Her expression was smoother than glass, giving away no hint of anything, and though it was Tony’s question she answered, her eyes continued to hold Steve’s. She was challenging him, but only she knew the stakes and the rules of the game.
“We are not done with this conversation.” Tony hissed lowly, turning sharply on his heel. If he slammed the door on his way out, it was only as good as the idiot deserved.
“I don’t know, bambina.” he finally managed to get out, forcing a smile on his face. “I very much hope so.”
Beautiful or not, it was a strange gift to give another man, and despite his earlier teasing Tony didn’t really count wearing feminine items high on his list of vices; but he resolved himself not to get upset until Stefen gave him an explanation. What he held was full of meaning for Stefen, Tony didn’t have to understand it to see it writ in every line of his face.
Steve laughed, a bubble of happiness catching and bursting somewhere under his ribs. Unable to resist, he kissed the side of Tony’s mouth. Not enough. Not nearly enough, but it would have to do.
The monk finished quietly before he quietly left the cockpit, leaving Tony alone with his thoughts. The food was beginning to taste like ash in Tony's mouth but he kept eating.
Ian had declared, glaring at James like he might punch him and Artur had nodded in relief. He was scared, but he agreed with Ian. He did not want to stay in Austria if it meant he had to do it without vati.
“You’re being a colossal idiot Péter. But if you’re going then I’m going with you.” She declared, sounding too close to resolve for his liking.
Additionally, we meet other rom in this chapter (Yay!) and we just want to remind you that the only people who can tell you 100% what it is like to be rom are Roma people. As they tend to be private with their culture and are made up of a whole tapestry of different groups with varying histories and practices, we chose to pay homage by blending many traditions together. Please do not walk away from this story thinking it is going to make you an expert. Rather we hope it opens your heart to a forgotten victim of the Holocaust and inspires you toward wanting to be closer to your fellow man and hear their stories.
Artur had crawled into Tony’s lap at the start of the meal and now refused to be moved. Both he and Sara were clutching at parts of Tony’s shirt with dazed expressions.
"I'd cram my fist down your throat for that, if I wasn't so happy to hear you speak in Romany again." Bucky drawled in their native tongue with an indolent smile and Steve started, glancing around as if he expected to find someone else in the room, but of course Bucky was still talking to him and that meant he had to have just been shouting at his best friend in Romany.
Surprisingly, there were some pictures of himself; some during his time in the army, one during one of his USO tours, and one of him smiling sheepishly to the camera surrounded by the Commandos.
“Well,” Tony cleared his throat. “I know I still have some people who believes me as a tyrant and I’d rather not confirm that just yet. It took me twenty years to get this far and I’d rather have this last as long as possible. Having people willingly become mine will make the reign last longer, right?”
“Indeed he is. But please keep me informed, sir. We do not want to overlook these little moments as they may well be signs of a bigger attack coming.”
She nodded and he wasn’t sure there was any interest left. He awkwardly cleared his throat and waved the papers up. “I’ll put these back up before I leave. Thank you again, ma’am.”
“And the questions it’s sure to spark?” Tony tilted his head. “There are still people who don’t approve of me, Wilson. I want to keep Steve as far away from them as possible. The less he knows the better.”
“I believe that is just your paranoia, sir. You care for him and want him safe. You’ve always been fiercely overprotective over those you care for. Remember the incident when Ms. Potts started seeing that gentleman from HR? You threatened him so terribly Ms. Potts sued you on his behalf.” Jarvis comforted, somewhat. It was never pleasant to remember Pepper’s wrath. “Please do not let this spark something unhealthy is all I ask. If this is Hydra you will take them down before Mr. Rogers is the wiser.”
His father could complain all he wanted. The idea of ruling sounded so dull. All he wanted was Steve and their family more than anything else.
There something did catch his eye, even though it was nothing of a surprise; it seemed his room had direct access to the attack level. There looked to be a door right across the foot of his bed. He hadn’t noticed it the night before, but it was dark and he had been freezing and exhausted. Besides just a bleary peak around, Steve had gone straight to bed in preparation for his shopping trip.
“This world has been dangerous and…dirty since you left it, Steve. There have been some positive progresses, sure, but not enough. Your death,” he hissed the term out so hatefully that Steve nearly jumped in surprise, “started a trend of unusual and terrible happenings in this world.”
Dvorak fired wildly at Rogers back, striking trees and snow around the fleeing man with deadly precision, mentally tallying his remaining bullets.  He was ignored by the general and the oncoming soldiers. Schmidt lead the charge in the first car. Dvorak could hear him screeching over the radio.
“No.” he answered with a slow breath. “I am not going to tell your father, on one condition. You and I are going to a show. Not a word of complaint or the deal is off.”
He was more relaxed than Tony had ever seen him as Bakhuizen played his violin for them while they ate, telling jokes and stories from their boyhood. Bakhuizen had an easy charm and a somewhat sharp wit that he seemed more than happy to poke Stefen with at any given opportunity and Tony found himself enjoying it.
Maybe he'd realize that playing hero never did their father any good either and find his way home. She only let herself dwell on it for a moment, because she knew what unfounded hope felt like by now and there wasn't time for that kind of foolishness. Péter would come home, or he wouldn't. The family would go to Switzerland with or without him and there was nothing she could do about it either way. Father would come out of his dark mood or he wouldn't, and whether he did or didn't, somebody needed to find an excuse for why he was ignoring his orders.
"Well that's a shame," Bakhuizen scoffed. "Your Da and I were catching rabbits when we were smaller than you. Hey Stark, did Willamina pack us any vegetables? "
"Tony? Now I'm very hungry." Artur piped up and Tony sighed. Right then. The respite had been good while it lasted.
Tony exhaled in a hot rush against his mouth as he captured Steve’s lower lip, his hands sinking into Steve’s hair and gripping tight. Oh. That was just...that was. Steve growled as he pulled Tony closer, hungry for more of him, unable to stop himself, holding onto him for dear life as he pressed his body over Tony’s, desperate to feel him. The piano gave a fitful squall of protest as Tony’s back bore down against the keys and they jerked away from each other in shock. In the sudden quiet Steve thought he heard the sound of footsteps and both their eyes flew to the door, still just the way Artur had left it, but there was no sign of anyone in the hall beyond.
The chill was being chased away now by a fierce warmth blooming in her chest as he guided her arm, showing her how to strike and thrust, explaining patiently what angles to use on imagined foes of various heights.
There was the matter of Samuel, it was his last day on the grounds. Steve was to escort him to Vienna that evening. He should be up packing his things. Sam had told him he wanted to finish out the day in the garden but had he finished? Did he need anything for the journey?
They found Tony bent over the piano, concentrating fully on the music he was plying from its keys. Over the weeks the sharp pang Steve felt every time he heard the sound of his wife’s piano being played after all these years had lessoned into a dull thud, like a bruise, but it ached sharply now for an entirely different reason. Tony and the children had slowly infiltrated the room.
There wasn't need for much talk as their eyes roved over the prints. Soren seemed most fascinated by the ones from Péter's recent adventures: his friends in their HJ uniforms, a beautiful girl with red lips and grit in her smile, pictures of farmers and their farms, railroad tracks and the trains carrying cars loaded with people to destinations unknown; but Péter and Tony were engrossed in the delightful discovery that the roll of film had not been empty when Stefen had fished the kodak out of the attic to gift it to him.
Wind pressed against the sides of the wooden box as the truck hustled down the road. Steve bounced again, grunting in pain as his ribs jostled against the side of the crate, he was stuffed in. His lower body was covered with a deep layer of hay and fertilizer. The stench of it was thick all around him, clawing up his throat.
With a single blow, in the eyes of the public Tony would go from a man fighting for his rightful inheritance to a nasty tempered Jew trying to steal the jewel of the German Navy.
,” Stanislov waved his hand generously with a slight grimace, “It’s nothing we can’t sort out together. I’m here to help you get back to where you belong. Your little misadventure can be explained away by rebel sabotage. They attacked, you got away but were severely injured and confused. Once your head cleared you contacted me.”
“What about you? You like arachnids. You remind me of one of the brothers, I think you’d like him, brother Banner-”
Phillips had been gruff. Impatient even. But under the growl, Steve had seen the compassion that made it impossible for the man to look the other way when all the others had.
"Captain. Captain I'm so sorry. I have no idea where he found this trash but he wouldn't stop!" Hammer immediately launched in but Stefen's eyes were on Tony who was tightly gripping the hands of Wanda and Pietro Lehnsherr who both looked as if they wanted to flee for their lives.
The day dragged on but the sun finally did set and when the hour approached Tony crept back up to the attic and prayed that his unconventional feat of engineering wasn’t going to backfire on him now.
When Artur tugged on his hand for his attention Tony ignored the squabbling of his brothers for the moment to focus on the younger boy. He figured it was safe enough, as there were no projectiles being thrown yet and no blood.
“Evidently not. What is all this?” Steve demanded waving to all the boards and the tools scattered about. Now that he and Bucky were close he was somewhat alarmed to see Péter operating a heavy looking saw and the smooth handled chisel in Natacha’s hands had his heart racing.
Ian flushed with embarrassment but his eyes flicked between Péter and their father with indecision. He knew something, Tony realized.
“He’s a fool. Czechoslovakia won’t be enough.” Tony announced instead, and Stefen nodded slowly in agreement.
Artur cried for an hour and gone missing for three. It had taken all of Péter, Frau Hogan and Steve’s efforts to find him. Though it had been the first and the only time - Steve had promised the boy so fervently - Artur still behaved sometimes as if he expected Steve to scream at him for the smallest infraction. To be struck...
“I need you to report the captain’s movements to me. Any intelligence drops into your lap I want to know.”
Tony was tempted to lie, or come up with some half-truth to placate the captain’s curiosity, only... he didn’t want to. Stefen had trusted him with so much already and proven himself to be a better man than Tony could ever hope to be. And more honestly he was greedy.
“Surely nothing horrible? “he asked hesitantly. “The men in the caravan, they would have beat me and left me for dead. I always knew that. But I always thought it was different for your sort.”
“Grig, is everything alright?” Antonia was already halfway out of her seat by the time Tony’s cousin got to the table. Grig spared his mother a reassuring glance and patted her arm, but his tone was grim as he announced to the room at large, “I’ve heard from my friend Carlo, the police are organizing a roundup. Everyone will need to be careful. The streets will be dangerous for a while.”
Stefen took a small breath and Tony waited, wondering at the strange sense of hesitancy that had returned to the captain’s manner. The children were instinctively quiet. Despite the story’s clear conclusion, they did not make a sound.
She shook her head slowly and Péter held still captivated as she drew his hand toward the patch of earth she'd yanked up and guided his palm to press it flat upon the dirt.
Stefen pressed his lips to Tony’s once more in a hard kiss that felt one shade claim and the other plea, before he pulled away to look down at him. His fingers threaded through the hair curling at Tony’s nape, and Tony leaned into him.
?” Stefen made the word sound so abhorrent, so foreign as to incite fury at its mere suggestion. Perhaps unconsciously he took a step around the desk, shortening the distance between them. “When the hell have I ever treated you like you were that?”
That’s another thing the movie left out. They bickered constantly. I used to think they’d go to their graves that way, shoulder to shoulder arguing about who said what and which of them was right about this or that. Like a ridiculous old couple. That was how I knew my father loved him. You can only be that ridiculous over someone you truly care about.
“Tony.” Steve protested, thinking of the early hour and the time he could be spending with the children, but Tony shook his head.
He was close. Tony could tell by the sound of each ragged breath. He could feel Stefen shaking against him, and at first he thought it was from how very close he was to completion, but when Tony looked into his eyes again they’d changed.
Natacha gave him a sharp look and Péter winced, grumbling under his breath. Tony suspected she’d stomped on his foot.
“Twenty years changes a man,” Tony replied. He couldn’t help but dig, at least a little, but he softened the words with a smile for the admiral and his other guest, a fellow with greying hair in a sharp business suit and hat.
Charlotte had come to see her, to help with the children even when both of their mothers had refused, for fear of catching it themselves. Her mother had been terribly upset with her for putting herself at risk that way, but Charlotte had never regretted it.
"I'd like to hunt rabbits. I think it sounds fun." Said Natacha, from over by the pit that Bakhuizen had dug for the fire. She was still patting her hair dry but looked up long enough to smirk in Tony's direction. "You never know when such a skill might come in handy."
Steve stiffened as the two women closest to them perked in interest at his name. He nodded stiffly at them, biting out another apology as he made his exit.
"Oh, Stefen. How good of you to drop by," Charlotte exclaimed as she extended her hand, tone suggesting they hardly ever saw each other. He supposed that was honest. Her smile stayed friendly enough, though there was a hint of strain around the edges.
“Cross? I can hardly imagine it.” Tony murmured with a serious frown. Stefen blinked at him but Tony didn’t break until the man’s shoulders twitched and suddenly a rusty chuckle rumbled from his chest. Tony grinned victoriously.
