"So it's two hours until the shit actually hits the fan, got it," Steve said conversationally, trying to look casual.  DeSoto frowned.  "I mean the auction," clarified Steve.
"They want to kill Tony. Can't let them..." Steve trailed off, almost sounding drunk.
"Sure, I'll introduce you two when he comes back in. They're going to start the auction soon-- see that gal up there?  That's Gail, she runs the auction every year." Gail was an Alpha. Of course. Tony considered how bad for him image it would be if he slapped a skinny sixty-year-old woman.  He loathed Gail and, based on her frequent disapproving frowns in Tony's direction, she loathed him right back. She was wearing a lovely dress and scarf and Tony was certain she was a snob of the worst type.
Steve let out quiet little whines with every roll of Tony's hips. His grip on the other's shoulders loosened, his nails leaving faint crescent shapes in their retreat. One leg fell down by Tony's side, no longer curled around him. Steve felt fuzzy and was only distantly ware of his own erection.
"I hate history," Sixteen said, pulling a face. "It's so depressing."
Aria laughed gently. "I think Tony can handle romance just fine. I think, in the end, it's how he sees what he's entitled to. And I kind of blame his dad for that, going by what Steve's told me… there's some stuff about Howard he hasn't actually told Tony. His memory of his father is tainted enough," she sighed and moved to get them two wine glasses.
Another phone call came through suddenly: Phil.
"No-- he can feel-- it's fine."  Tony was staring at the ground, trying to get ahold of himself.  He didn't want to have a panic attack in front of Steve's crew, and he didn't want to have one here, on the sidewalk outside in the middle of downtown LA.  It was a clear day and Tony was struggling to orient himself. Skyscrapers. Blue skies. He was in a city, outside, not in a desert, underground. He was okay.
, would want you."  He ran his hands over Steve's arms and added, almost casually, "
"Because you're bleeding all over the damn carpet!"
Phil gripped his sides, laughing even harder at the idea of Howard Stark reading
"My condolences about your mate," said Tony.
Sometimes Steve did think things would have gone differently if he'd known Bucky was alive. Not that he would have chosen him, necessarily, more that he could have never knowingly pulled Tony into this mess. He didn't deserve all Steve's baggage; he didn't deserve to literally have his life under threat all because he'd chosen to mate Steve.
Rhodes jumped.
"Well, it was also about you illegally crossing national borders and getting a half-dozen SHIELD agents to invade a sovereign country without authorization, but tomatoes, tomahtoes, right?" said Tony brightly.
Tony would have given anything in the world for Steve not to be there.  He didn't dare more, worried that doing so would break the fragile dam that was holding back a deluge of emotions.
"My shield isn't mine anymore, kiddo," Steve broke it to Cooper and stood up. The kid pouted.
Wanda put her hands up.  "Say the word," she whispered to Pietro, wiggling her fingers.
"Er..." He looked down at himself. "I'm not coming out before I shower."
Tony wiggled his body against Steve's.
Richards blinked in surprise. "I, er..." He glanced over at Coulson almost nervously. The omega agent shuffled in his seat.
, than he had in ages.  Being with Steve again had filled a hole in his heart that he hadn't even known was there.
"...and then he said... let there be light," murmured Tony, fitting a film reel into the projector and hitting the switch.
Tony brushed his fingers through Steve's hair, being as gentle as he could, considering he was in metal gloves.
Steve's eyes narrowed. "Anyone could hand Waffle's ass to him. He's a kid," he stated flatly. DeSoto had the decency to look a little uncomfortable when he said that. "'
"Okay, I'm here, I-- oh, Lord," said Pepper, walking in.  Her hand flew to her mouth.
Brennan and Brazinski exchanged a look.
"Come on, you gotta help me carry him," Natasha said and Sam nodded, moving with a wince to grab one side of Steve whilst she grabbed the other. Even with the weight he'd lost in captivity, Steve was still built like a bull and weighed a hell of a lot. And even sharing the weight didn't make it much better.
"Hey, lover," called Tony, climbing heavily down the last few stairs and crossing the room slowly.  He wrapped his arms around Steve's waist.  "...what are you looking at?"  He peeked over Steve's shoulder.  He was in a good mood, maybe because of what a gorgeous day it was, or maybe because he had a good excuse to toss out the tulips now that they'd been dropped.
Steve shivered at the wet drag of tongue involuntarily. He braced his hands against Bucky's chest, either in comfort or to push him away. He wasn't sure. His vision was losing focus. A heat and malnutrition really were a terrible combination. He groaned, more in pain than pleasure and tried to look up at Bucky, his hands fisting in the other's jacket. "Buck..." he tried to get out but that was all he could manage.
Steve opened a letter and began to read, his heart in his throat. He ran a hand over his face. "I think...I think I know what kind of charity I want to create," he whispered.
She looked across the lot, watching a few people unloading a set piece off the back of a truck.  She knew that Aria's question came from a place of concern, but what else could she say? Tony's life had never had the slightest bit of normalcy or consistency, and he was emotionally stunted, immature, self-absorbed, and had terrible judgement.  This was the longest monogamous stretch Pepper had ever witnessed; Tony's relationships usually lasted an average of two or three months and ended in an explosive fight that often involved alcohol. Steve had been an incredible stabilizing force, but no one person, super or otherwise, could reverse decades of damage.  She was rooting for them, but if she'd been asked to bet money on everything working out neatly... well, she wasn't so sure.
Eric shrugged.  "It's not for everyone.  Maybe he's waiting to meet the right--"
"Steve, honey, you never look awful," Aria assured him and stood, gathering all the take away boxes to throw into the bin. "Now I hope you use tonight to work out some of your
my dad was married."
"Maybe I've decided that dragging you out of bed is no longer the most persuasive technique." Steve shrugged innocently as he dropped down the tie with everything else. His tongue darted out to wet his bottom lip briefly. "I think it's better to get you to take a little gumption of your own. You're a lot less grumpy when you get yourself out of bed."
It felt good to just say it. Because the press probably wouldn't believe him anyway. Or the therapist.
Tony's smile disappeared.  "...Steve isn't
"Is that the orchid Boswell and Backsy gave you?" asked Clint from atop the fridge, eyeing the little orchid in Tony's hands.
"Come on... come on, let's get you cleaned up, I've got you, we've got this..."
T'Chaka nodded quietly, more in understanding than agreement.  "To be sure, this is a tragedy that affects us all. I hope you can abide a request for me, on behalf of my country."
that.  Jarvis was special, irreplaceable.  Steve had bullied his way into the position of Tony's assistant and now he was acting like he'd been there forever.  Tony knew very little about him and he didn't trust him.  Tony had learned the hard way that you couldn't ever really trust anyone, ever.  He'd known Stane for thirty years, had trusted him, and look at what had happened.
auction, but shouldn't we try to stop all of 'em?  This shit's illegal! And even if it weren't, it's fucked up.  I wanna put
," Mackenzie pointed out.
"Sounds like people are already getting their hands on him," replied Ian, who had wandered over to listen in.  "Until Bennett sells him for good, he's obviously renting him out."
He shined a pen light in Steve's eyes.  "Well, he's not having a stroke. His reflexes are working just fine."
She hadn't forgotten about Steve, either; she'd gotten him a giant jar of marshmallow fluff. (She knew the way to Steve's heart.  The jar was already a quarter gone.)
His vision began to fuzz at the edges again and he hit the side of his head to try and wake himself up. How long had it been since he'd eaten? How much sleep had he even gotten over these past few... days? Was it days?  It had only been a few days, right?  "Bucky. Come on..."
The man in question was currently chatting with Clint at the other side of the room. Steve pulled back, his expression bemused as he raised a brow at him. "I don't know. You'll have to ask him yourself."
, sometimes that happens!"
He punched in his keycode and slipped in.  When the bulletproof door shut behind them, it was eerily quiet.  Tony led Steve across the shop and toward another flight of stairs.  Steve knew there were two levels below this one; there was Tony's hall of suits and, below that, a wine cellar.  They descended the circular steps toward the wine cellar and crossed it, into the server room (or as Tony sometimes called it, "JARVIS's room").
"No, Steve's heats come on fast.  The sooner you get this interview over, the better," said Pepper, pinching the bridge of her nose.  "Tony, please stop humping him."
"Bigger than this?  Did you see what he did down there?" demanded Clint.
Tony’s second smoothie of the day was left on the side for him as well as another shot of espresso and the BLT sandwich he had asked for.
.  It's like, when I don't think about it, I can think about it, but once I start thinking about it, I can't think about it anymore," said Tony in frustration, pressing his fingers into his temples as if he could squeeze the information out of his mind like juice from an orange.
"Did I mention I missed you like crazy?" asked Bucky, standing up.  Steve had gotten taller. A lot taller. They were eye-to-eye. Maybe Bucky had an inch on him, but he was no longer
"...yeah, you be my messenger.  She'll kill me if I tell her myself.  I think this'll be the third time I blew off that meeting..."
When Steve saw all the envelopes in Tony's hands he knew it was bad. He'd heard Gideon's message and he'd felt a little bit sick. The fact that the guy was that desperate to sleep with him, though? That was petty funny. Or at least would be after this shit storm was over. He'd slept in as late as he could get away with, dressed in just a tee, boxers and dressing gown. He'd actually put on Tony's gown by mistake but hadn't bothered to correct himself.
"You know, you really make it far too easy." The voice was crisp and lightly accented. Steve instantly didn't like it. "'Megas in battle. It's stupid. All it takes is one little heat inducer and pop! You're useless."  He kept the grenade launcher trained on them, a second, smaller gun slung over his shoulder. "The funniest part is I'm going to run away from all this and there's nothing you can do to stop me."
Bucky rolled down the window before lighting his cigarette.  He put his good arm out the window, enjoying the taste of the cigarette and the cool air on his skin.  "Oh, look, Steve," he said, pulling his arm back into the car. "...there's a ladybug on my hand."
to play in that poker game.
And so that's the choice Tony made, even though it killed him to turn away from Steve at that moment, to ignore the lifeless, crumpled body on the ground and turn his attention toward Vanko.
Had he understood correctly?  No one?
Fortunately, when Steve began to weave through the crowd, people stopped scuffling, or at least the omegas did. Steve wore a serious expression; he was one of the only real soldiers in the room. He could have them all on the floor in minutes, possibly seconds.
Everyone stared at it.
He'd overstepped; Donner was hunched up again, shaking his head violently.  "No. No, I don't want to talk to him, he's-- he's not a good omega."
"...early thirties, huh?" he said.  "...I bet this squirrel costume helps knock off a few years, too... y'know, I think it's actually a chipmunk or a hedgehog or something.  No tail, see? Well, there's a nub... you think Malick is gonna have to
Steve didn't want to admit it, but he kind of missed Fury's secret missions. He'd enjoyed the rush and the thrill. He'd enjoyed feeling like he was
Tony clung to Steve's hand.  He didn't want to be left with any of these people.  The thing that scared him most was that Tony, who had graduated in '87, a mere four years after arranged bondings were banned, could have very well been on the other end of things.  His parents had died when he was 16, but if they had lived, who knew if his father would have tried to set him up with an omega? He could imagine himself at 18, being led into a room for a "scenting," picking out one he liked, taking them home... it sent shivers up his spine and made him sick.  And like George, he wouldn't have really known better. Until recently in Tony's life, he'd never questioned omegas being servants.
"It's not about Christmas Tony," Steve said softly. He didn't lean away from his touch but he didn't lean into it either. He sank down on the mattress, his head in his hands as he tried to push away the threatening migraine and sudden fatigue. It wouldn't go away; that empty feeling Bucky left him with every time Steve heard the shrill laugh of a girl he brought home.
. "The answer's in this room. And I know it hurts, in more ways than one. But you can ponder over the past another time," he breathed. "Right now I'm more concerned with your future, and making sure you
This was yet another reason Tony was itching the join the team.  Not just to protect Steve, but to prove to Steve he wasn't just a spoiled brat in a business suit.  He could get low and dirty, he could throw and take a punch.  He wanted to prove to Steve that he was more than capable of protecting them, of being a good Alpha who could assert himself and throw down when it was time for that sort of thing.  Tony wasn't sure what Sam's deal was but he was confident his suits would blow Sam's gear out of the water.
He nodded. "Did...Phil make this all by himself?"
Tony looked up; Pepper was waving.  His face broke into a grin. "Pepper!  Didja see--"
.  Suppressant abuse is like, one of the number-one pharmaceutical issues-- Steve, you should talk about that, next!" said the woman, accepting a drink from one of Trey's brothers.  He handed Steve a drink, too; the smell was intense. It might as well have been pure ethanol. He beamed at Steve, clearly proud of his concoction.
Tony pulled a flask out of his jacket and took a lot drink, then sat heavily on the spare bed and looked away.  "I'm an Alpha. And a man."
He walked over, reached over her shoulders, and began typing silently, his fingers a bit slow on the keyboard because of the armor.  A moment later, the computer pinged.
for him." Because this was on Steve. If he'd never been at that conference then Donner wouldn't have been tossed away.
"Sure, he might have said my name a few times on an operating table in Azzano, but that didn't mean much."
"Oh my God!" a girl in the crowd shrieked. Pepper pulled her hand back and the moment was gone. The music had died down.
"If you don't wanna be an Avenger, then obviously I can't make you," Steve said gently. "And you'd have to follow my lead, Tony, and I'm not sure how you'd feel about that exactly..." he stretched his legs along the length of his couch. "My job isn't to judge people on their past, Tony. It's about the present. Natasha and Clint have pretty dodgy histories, too...for the record. But they're focusing on what they can do for the world, not what they've already done for it...
He felt the hairs on the back of his neck rise.
The soldier froze.  He wasn't in the habit of
He blinked.
The memory froze him for a split second; it was long enough for the other man to fling him off.  Tony hit the ground with a shriek of pain; he scrambled to his feet and lunged back into the fight.
Tony wasn't sure why the hell they were meeting these people because, as he tried to point out, fruitlessly, he and Steve no longer worked for SHIELD or Fury.  Wisdom seemed thoroughly unconcerned. Maybe he knew something they didn't.
Before Steve could answer, JARVIS was nagging them.
The two of them collapsed against each other, weeping.
"Steve, Piper, go get us some drinks, will you?" demanded Tony.  He gave Steve an apologetic look but then realized Steve may not be able to see it behind his sunglasses.
Tony saw a chance and he took it.  He'd always been about taking chances.
A block away, Pietro and the soldier were staring into a display case.
at the end of each report. Steve soon skipped the reports and moved onto blueprints of the outside of the base, which were detailed enough to need some deciphering. His mind was soon churning through ideas and identifying infiltration points, the experiment report forgotten in place of the task at hand.
"...well, for the most part, yes, but there's always going to be dissenters," said Pepper.  "There's a couple of nice signs in there too, if you look..."
A lot of Tony's initial fury had subsided because of Steve's posturing.  Steve's body language was incredibly submissive; he rarely groveled, but seeing him speak softly and avoid eye contact and kneel, all of it made Tony hard-wired to forgive him and reassure him.
"Will you do it, or not?"
help," Steve pointed out, frustrated as ever. It was frankly ridiculous. There were bigoted Alphas everywhere; was Tony going to fight every one of them on the floor? Or was this still about the fact that Hammer had hit on him last time they'd met?
"Tony, Tony, Tony, you just can't stay out of trouble!" said Lowenstein, beaming.  "This is our new junior partner, Mr. Narayan--"
Doug shook his head and flipped one of the pancakes, looking thoroughly flattered to be snapped at by Tony Stark and part of a conversation between him and Steve Rogers.  He was literally shaking. He looked like he might cry with gratitude. Tony seemed oblivious to it; he had picked up a single pancake with his hands and sampled it.  For a forty-two thousand dollar pricetag, it was decent.
?  Steve needs to get caught on the classics."
Tony frowned.  Normally he would have begun an argument but he didn't.  He took Steve's hand lightly and followed Happy out to the car.  Pepper was in the backseat, scanning through a ledger. She handed Tony a folder when he got in beside her.  "Here's your itinerary."
"I got a call from Ty.  He wanted to extend his congratulations.  Your phones are back at the hotel, I assume?"
"We found most of him.  The suits self-destructed.  Four confirmed causalities, about three dozen injuries.  ...you okay, Tony?"
Lila looked up at Natasha and beamed.  "Swing me, Aunna Nanasha."
"I'll be careful," Steve promised. "I just wanna talk to them, not make them uncomfortable.  I've been careful of that. Or I thought I had. I don't think I got Donner into trouble, at least, but I managed to apologise to him for before.  I was grateful for that."
"You don't understand!" shouted Tony.  He knew he didn't need to shout; they were talking through a headset, after all, but he was panicking too much to keep the volume down.  "All these people are in danger, we gotta get them out of here, he's working with Vanko, Hammer and Vanko, the suits, the reactors, Vanko called me--"
being submissive."
"Well... she's mad about how I've been... acting like a dick lately," said Tony.  "Seemed surprised I pair-bonded.  ...frankly, I'm surprised, too.  Commitment isn't really my style."  He shrugged one shoulder.  "We didn't talk for long.  I just kind of filled her in and then hung up.  She probably needs time to process it, anyway."  Tony looked down at his mug.  "Her and I... we're real different.  But she's been... I dunno.  More than an assistant or a friend, Steve.  She's... she's kind of been my anchor.  I need someone to rein me in.  You might have noticed but I'm not the most stable of individuals."  He looked up.  "We'll see her tomorrow... at the Expo.  ...for what it's worth, she's all about omega rights.  Always has been.  Surprisingly socially progressive, that one."
On the third day of his heat it already felt like it was over. Steve had feeling the next day he would be free from it already. He didn't think about Gideon, or rather, he decided not to. But then that evening they got a call. To Steve's surprise, it was Nick delivering the bad news personally.
"...you a homophobe?"
Steve let out a quiet sound of approval as Tony nuzzled at his crotch and Steve's dick twitched in his pants in response. Dammit. His resolve was quickly crumbling, especially by the point that Tony had reached up to undo his zipper. Steve let him do it. God; why would he ever stop him.
. You act like I did this on purpose but do you seriously think I would have done this to you if I'd known the truth? I spent the last months of my life thinking I wasn't even mated anymore. And it was shit. It was the most degrading thing I've ever experienced in my entire life.  And maybe, okay, I didn't deserve a second chance. But I wanted one. I thought I was dead and then I wasn't and then you came along and you wanted me and I thought that maybe, after everything, I could finally have what I always dreamed of...but then no. Bucky has to come and fuck it up again. Because he won't let me go...and do you think I'm
"...you don't look especially happy to see me, Captain.  If I didn't know better, I'd think you had a chip on your shoulder," said Fury, fixing Steve with his usual one-eyed glare.  In July, Fury's long coat and gloves seemed out of place.  He looked like an assassin who hadn't yet perfected the art of blending in.
Tony was watching both Steve and Lydia over the top of his glass with a critical eye.  Steve had a look on his face and Tony wondered if he meant he wanted the whole collar in something other than metal.  Tony had no idea what the heck you'd make a collar from, if not some sort of metal. Besides, they were at a jeweler's... Cartier and Bulgari and the rest of them wouldn't make anything that wasn't a precious metal.
"M'fine. Just need a bathroom. I'm sorry, I didn't have time to change into anything else. It's been a long day."
Steve had stared at her, expressionless, when she'd informed him.  She might as well have been talking Japanese for all of the comprehension he showed.  After asking him a few delicate questions, she offered to leave him alone, and he nodded numbly.
"...no, you don't, James.  Remember, ads can't give orders."
"How is that the yooj?"
"Good, good idea..." Steve hummed, but he was already way ahead of him as he leaned his forehead against the car window and let his eyes slowly slip shut.
"I'm only into Alphas," said Sam, still pressed into the corner.  A pause, then he added, almost embarrassed, "I can't help... this.  It's a reflex."
"Captain Rogers?"
?  What the
Tony clung to Steve throughout the ride home.  Despite his size, Steve curled up like a typical omega, letting Tony shelter him.  Tony couldn't stop stroking his skin, nuzzling his hair, kissing his face and neck,  He stayed away from the back of Steve's neck, focusing on his throat instead, not sure what the protocol was for that area anymore.
"Steve?  ...Steve?"  Bucky wasn't sure what was going on but he could hear the other Alpha and he was feeling less and less confident by the second.  His top priority was Steve's safety and he could not, at present, guarantee that. Not with that other Alpha there. "Steve, I need you to go somewhere safe until I get there.  You need to get away from--"
wondered Tony) glided over.  She was wearing dress pants and a blue button-up blouse that matched her hijab.  She shook Steve's hand, then extended one to Tony.  Tony didn't move.  He hated shaking hands and his hand was occupied with Steve's.  She dropped her hand after a moment.
You didn't have to be a math genius to figure out that, with six appointments, if Tony got the VIP treatment at each one, he would have imbibed eighteen glasses of scotch by the end of the day.  Tony wished he and Steve had talked more about what they wanted before going on this excursion; he didn't think even he could handle this much alcohol and braless redheads being thrown his way. No doubt all of the other jewelers, each vying for business, were going to try to get on his good side with similar techniques.
"Aside from when you were force-bonded, of course." Steve's smile fell. "How did that affect your relationship?"
"...yeah but who cares?" said Rhodey.  "His heart's in the right place."
"What do you mean, Malick deployed the STRIKE team to pick up Rogers?" demanded Pierce.  "No, we didn't hear anything about that! Rogers isn't even our concern as long as he's not off ruining international treaties!  ...get the Ventura base commander on the phone, I need to know what the hell's going on."
The other man was still smiling.  By the time he realized Tony was reeling him in, it was too late; Tony wrapped the cables around his arms, his torso, yanking them closer, entangling them.  They were face-to-face; Tony yanked, pulling down the other man's body, then fell to his knees on top of him, reaching up and grabbing the reactor on his chest.
Dr. Gleason would come up with something, if he was as brilliant as he seemed to be.
By the time they got home it was a small wonder they hadn't wrecked the car.  Both of them were nodding off.
"Do you remember the plane to Monaco?" Steve breathed, stretching his legs out onto the seat in front of him (because yes, they were long enough to reach; Tony's plane had great leg room, for a regular person, but Steve was not a regular person and he often had to arrange himself into bizarre configurations to get comfortable). "You slapped my ass and it took every fiber of my being not to turn around and tell you where to stick it."
"It'd be just like giving an interview by ourselves, I guess.  We'd just be shoulder-to-shoulder," said Tony, hands still running hypnotically over Steve's arms.  "They'd ask you a question, then me, then you... then probably both of us and we'd try to answer at the same time and laugh and everyone would think it was cute.  Just like any other pair-bond."  Tony placed his lips on Steve's shoulder.  Not quite a kiss.  Just a loving, possessive gesture.  "They'll probably start asking about kids soon.  They always do, when someone famous bonds.  'When are you gonna knock up your omega?'   Ask us about our
"Crap," Steve whispered and leaned his head forward, bringing his hands up to rest his forehead against them.
," he groaned into the sheets. "I hate you."
"Mr. Stark, we think we've located Captain Rogers."
There was a pause.  Steve didn't seem satisfied with the answer, so DeSoto elaborated, sounding apologetic.  "Okay, well, this was... when things started to get really bad. Alpha and Trickshot got into a big fight-- see, Trickshot thought Alpha was taking him to some conference in Iowa, where he was originally from, and Alpha decided not to take him after all.  Both of them started yelling, and Alpha told me to go take care of Trickshot. He stormed right out the front door, like he was an Alpha himself or something!"
"Good luck out there," Steve said, his voice warm. He thought recognized the name. He was remembering a firework song, or something? JARVIS played him a lot of random shit in the gym.
Steve walked back over to the group of kids, some of the boys making fun of Edgar because Judy told him off in front of everyone. He sighed internally.
Teeth gritted, Tony wrapped his arm around the cable, watching sparks fly, listening to the metallic grinding as his suit failed him.  He took a staggering step forward, the cable twisting over his shoulder, the electricity scrambling the suit's circuits, burning him out.
personal.  Clint would rather not have you hanging around his safehouse.  You have a record of making things much less safe. Plus you're kind of a jerk to him."
Steve hadn't even realised he'd been shivering. What was that about? He didn't have a heat due and he wasn't sick; there was no reason for him to. Steve stood quickly, eager to warm up. He didn't like feeling like his body was betraying him. Growing up he'd been at war with his body, his entire existence just a fight to survive. Now Steve shouldn't have to worry and he shouldn't be shivering.
He stood up and grabbed Steve, for a split second almost picking him up.  His bad shoulder, the right one, made a crack of protest. He winced, flexed it (another pop-crack), and grinned sheepishly down at Steve.  "Right. You're huge. ...c'mon. Kitchen."
right to. So back the
Fury did, too; he cocked an eyebrow at her.  "If I recall correctly, yours took place in the middle of one of Barton's special assignments and delayed his return by a week."
It took him a few hours to read the paper; he worked through it slowly, taking time to consider each piece. By the time he'd finished it the sun had risen in the sky, bleeding out a pink hue that peeked through cotton clouds. Steve stared out the window, transfixed by the view for a brief moment. Then he heard the door open and recognized the scent as Dr. Brennan. She was quite distinctive.
Didn't matter now. All that mattered was putting on foot in front of the other.
The man and the woman both went white.
"Confirmed, one injured.  What's the nature of his injury?" asked someone on the other end of the walkie-talkie.
"Tony. I need you to get us access," Steve murmured into comms, pressed up against a wall as guards patrolled down the corridor. Natasha had run out of darts at this point, so it was time to fight if they got spotted.  (Admittedly, Steve couldn't wait.)  The guards' flashlights were darting over every white, sleek wall as they walked by. One dragged by less than an inch from Natasha's face; Steve heard her breath hitch.
"...just putting your omega back to bed.  He had a bad dream," said Tiberius with forced lightness.
"You have a jack hammer stored with the scrap in bank 2 of garage level 1."
"The suit's kind of... not designed for non-lethal combat," said Tony.  He shrugged, a weird, bulky gesture within the arm. He wasn't going to cry over that.  He didn't know how many people he'd killed in his life and didn't want to. "Come on, let's find the others."
He set his/Tony's tray down on the bedside table before moving to get dressed himself. Smart dark jeans, a white tee. His leather jacket would finish it. He liked to look put-together for SHIELD (he was a captain inside those walls, after all) but he also wanted it to be clear that he wasn't there in any official capacity. He fixed his hair in the mirror with a tiny bit of Tony's gel to keep it in place, but only a little. He hated it shiny. It reminded him of the old Aphas in pinstriped suits that used to march around the city streets, absolutely full of themselves.
One of the guards stopped; the other nearly plowed into him.
He picked up his beer and took a sip, watching Steve over the edge.  It shouldn't matter if he and Bucky went out ever lousy night; Bucky was no longer part of their lives.  But Tony couldn't help but compare himself to Steve's other Alpha... it was a natural thing. He wanted to find ways he was superior to Bucky, to combat the ever-present knowledge that Bucky was a lot more dominant than him... that Steve's body, when given a choice, had initially chosen Bucky over him.
"That's more than six times the recommended dose," said Pepper.
funny.
sorry," said Tony.  "I... wanna do right by you, Steve.  So far I feel like... like I keep fucking up, big time.  Don't get me wrong, I'm known for fucking things up, making things difficult- you can ask Pepper, but... but this is pretty large-scale, even by Stark standards.  I've been attacked twice in a week.  Hell.  You were probably safer
his family.  Steve had been a consistent force for good in his life and he'd been there for a solid seven months.
"His mate was pointing a gun at this other omega, 'the badly behaved one'. He was drunk and then accidentally shot DeSoto in the arm," Steve said.
"I took Lola and I got the hell out of there."
He paused for a moment, reflecting.  "Although the auction thing, they can't say that's not fucked up."
He'd thought it was bad before, the first time he'd experienced Steve's heat.  And that was on the other side of a door, with two of his friends talking him through it... that was back before they'd been bonded... lying with his face pressed into the back of Steve's head, smelling him, touching him,
As if sensing he was being watching, he looked over, caught Steve's eye, smiled, and gestured for him to come over.
Maybe, he reflected, that was how Natasha and Clint did it.  By separating their battle personas from their real ones. Then again, as far as he could tell, both of them lived for their jobs.  He'd never seen Natasha wearing anything but tactical gear, and Clint had been away for months now. Maybe there was no separation after all, and they just didn't mind seeing the other one killing people.  Maybe they'd become numb to it.
It was mid-May and no one, except perhaps Pepper, had noticed that Tony wasn't excitedly talking about his birthday.  It would be his forty-first, but there was little planning or fanfare. Tony seemed far more interested in celebrating his and Steve's first anniversary together, which was a nice change of pace from his usual manic insistence on over-the-top parties.  Perhaps his last one had been a bit much, even for him.
"If he's scared it probably means they haven't hurt him yet. Fear comes before pain. And if he was in pain, you would feel it," Natasha tried to reassure him. Sam was flying the jet; they thought giving him something to focus on would help calm him down after the fight with Tony.
"We want to take your statement as soon as we can, Steve, so you don't forget any details," Maria explained calmly. "SHIELD is taking this very seriously, as is the WSC. We really want to get to the bottom of what happened here, Steve."
If he was being logical, yes, Tony knew this was his hormones going wild, completely out of control, but of course, he wasn't being logical, not at all; Steve's smell was intoxicating and he practically felt high and he was already hard and rubbing himself against Steve's leg, basking in the feelings of the new bond.
Pepper grabbed a tablet and opened up her own emails. "It's...good! No one seems to have noticed that you were going into a preheat by the end of it. Small mercies at least."
kind of old-fashioned, too?"
.  This was all way too complicated.
Steve trembled, whining and shaking as Tony licked at his sensitive cock.
Steve squeaked when Tony shoved a hand into his pants.
Gideon's eyes narrowed. "Let them in as they are," he said; surprising a lot of Alphas around them. "It is more important that Stark learn than be dressed appropriately."
or a life that revolves around
"Well, they're flyin' the flag."
The Bugle was tragically behind.  Their headlines were about Tony, not Steve..  (
Tony didn't know yet, not consciously, but he was already acting reckless and strange, even for him.
"Hey, you ever had a Blue Ocean?" asked Trey's brother, who clearly was enjoying showing off his mixing abilities.  He handed Steve a third drink. Steve didn't remember drinking the second one, but it was gone. "It's my take on a Blue Ocean--"
"Every year we do the lodge on Christmas Eve and then we have Stark Party New Year," insisted Tony as he followed Pepper out toward the pool deck.  "That's
"Yeah, sure."
him."
"You never let a subject get into you head.  That's Interrogation 101," said Natasha darkly.  "You think you're special because you got raped in a cave?  You think you're the only one who's been forced to drink saline or had vinegar put in your eyes?
Outside, Bucky woke to find himself alone.  Huh.
"Yeah. I dream about him a bit. He shot me. So what. He's not
Steve watched Tony peel his boxers down more intently than he should have, crunching away at the Red Delicious. It wasn't like he hadn't seen Tony naked since he'd gotten back; the other was pretty relaxed about this sort of thing after all. But so far Steve had only seen him when he was getting dressed, or into the shower... and now Tony was just
"Yes. I get that." Steve breathed. Jesus. Howard sounded like a bad father. Natasha had laughed at his face when she'd told Steve he'd had a son because that news alone had been shocking. Howard with a child... the image wouldn't sit in Steve's mind. "When we sat there with Gideon you were amazing. And your idea for the conference was amazing too. You're not just 'trying' Tony; you're good at this and I know that when I go to meet those omega lawyers tomorrow they're not going to think less of me for being with an Alpha like you. Quite the opposite."
had a shower," he mumbled, fully aware he'd brought this upon himself (he had no regrets either.)
Natasha had pulled up the car out front but there was still a decent swarm of reporters. The flashes started before they even stepped outside. Steve was beginning to understand by Tony called them vultures. They'd both just nearly died; did these people have no respect? Were they this bad in the forties? Steve wasn't sure he remembered.
"I'm going to look like a jerk who still thinks I have the right to be Cap when I
"I don't know," Steve said, straightening up. "We'll figure it out later; right now, we need to get everyone to safety."
"Both," Brazinski answered easily. "The fact that you took that upon yourself and only yourself to bring the Winter Soldier in is another display of very self-destructive tendencies, Captain."
lied about being a virgin, Tony, or-- or not experiencing love.  Our bond was basically just a-- an arrangement, I guess.  He didn't want me, or if he did, he didn't understand how. I thought I wasn't bonded anymore. And that's why...that's why I can't do triads and shit. I won't be anyone's commodity ever again."
"Is he gonna bet you?" Lola asked, the wine clearly not holding her back.
"No, sir.  He was declared dead in 1944."
"Captain," said a female voice behind him.
"If I help you-" More Cheerios were consumed. "-things are going to happen that no one will like. Firstly, Tony will get angsty as hell because, shockingly, the torture victim survivor has anxiety.  I don't know if I want to put my mate through that.  And then well, it's...really hit or miss. The Winter Soldier will kill me, we kill him, or we take him, or... he takes me.  And I don't really like any of those options."
"SHIELD's main concern is the contraception not working," Sitwell said. "It would make for an...awkward situation."
Tony's actions were controlled, precise.  They had to be.  The moment he let go, he knew he wasn't going to be able to recapture control.  He wanted to go home to his beachside mansion, the one that was missing walls, and call Pepper and beg her forgiveness for how stupid he'd been, how stupid he'd been over an omega he barely knew, grovel at her feet and admit that he'd only done that because he had thought they were bonded, but they weren't, because Tony was broken, a broken shell of a man and the omega in question already had an Alpha, and he needed her calm, firm, patient presence. Needed someone to just sit next to him while he processed this, someone to stabilize his world, which was spinning out of control, which no longer made sense.  He needed someone or something to
"Thank you for being so amazing about this," Steve murmured. "Most people wouldn't be.  I mean, the culture shock, the press-"
It kinda hurt to disappoint him, but this was reality.  Steve was no better than anyone else.  He was just as brutal and violent as Tony or anyone else.
"-hang out, y'know."
Also, I would like to pre-emptively say to everyone who comments about Tony being a dick in this chapter: yes.  He is a dick.  A huge, immature dick who is honestly not really emotionally capable of dealing with an Alpha/omega bond.  If you haven't picked up on that yet, hopefully by now it's clear.  And I know I keep saying it, but I swear, he does mature.  Somewhat.  For him, anyway.
, not what he was doing. It was sweet, actually.
Gideon laughed, the sound rumbling up from deep in his throat. "You've been spending too much time around Romanoff, I see."
Two guards burst into the room.
"Yeah, no, she's great," said Tony.  "Is she covering how your contract got canceled?"
"Anything you want, just name it," said Tony, shuffling around some of the larger orchids to block the tulips from sight.  "As long as it's not work, I don't want to deal with SHIELD or the expo fallout or anything involving your civil rights crusade... no offense... I just really wanna have a few days that are just us, you know?"
"I would like a minute alone with Tony,
He cried out when Tony first thrust into him, the head of his dick pressed just against Steve's prostate. His fingers dug into the couch. He was pretty sure he heard a ripping sound...
"Since when were ice sculptures a thing?" Steve frowned. "Surely they melt..."
"We're not about to have another Yemen situation, are we, Nick?" asked Pierce wryly.
. He changed back into his jeans and tee.  The cabin crew had enough sense to leave them entirely on their own. They were sat in one of the back cabins, Steve's laid out with his head in Tony's lap, his eyes half drooping shut. Tony raked his fingers through the short blond hair and felt a weird sense of... loss, almost.  He loved long hair.  He loved running his fingers through a woman's long, silky hair and here he was, bonded to a male omega who had just miscarried and who was already bonded to some other guy.
The shower was quick. It was his second that morning and Steve knew he'd have to face Donner sooner or later. He grabbed his phone but didn't check the screen.
"I LOVE YOU, CAPTAIN AMERICA!" yelled someone.
as you put it, with the Society.  We appreciate them as the first society to care for omega rights and we appreciate their getting us the vote, but nowadays, they don't do much at all.  Their head councilman is a houseomega."
"You're my Preferred Adviser.  C'mon, help me."  He beamed at Steve.  "Wait 'til you see what I've got in the works, it's amazing!"
"You look really, really familiar.  Have you been in something?" asked Sean, squinting at Tony.
"Well, he's definitely feeling better, if he's making pop culture references," said Pepper.  She glanced up at Steve, and added, for his benefit, "The priest thing, that's from a movie called
Tony sighed and closed the binder he had been making notes in.  "I'm better at business than relationships."
"I'm only a computer program and therefore a moral relativist, so I cannot determine if you are good without a basis for comparison," replied JARVIS.
Tony nibbled a cucumber sandwich delicately, flipping open the program.  He pointed to the glossy page in front of them. "Yeah, there's some workshops that let in omegas.  It says beneath the title... see...
." Steve threw his head back, his eyes rolling back as Tony's knot stretched inside of him. He clenched around his dick greedily, his arms curled around Tony's shoulders as he fucked into him in good, thorough thrusts. "I need it. Please. Please, come on. You gotta- -you gotta..." He was breathless, panting and trembling underneath him. Steve's legs came up to curl around Tony, the heels pressing into the small of his back only during him in deeper.
"Stark?  You got a room for me?"
"Personally, I don't believe we ought to be giving out special privileges..." muttered Malick as Agent Carter let Steve pull up his pant leg.   Steve felt the weight drop and the monitor clunked to the floor.
"About how often?"
"I'll make sure they get done!" Steve said as Pepper walked out, and she shot him a look that was something like gratitude over her shoulder as she went.
"Honestly my neck hurts too much to feel other people's thoughts or emotions right now," Steve murmured. "And I don't know. Before... after HYDRA, I couldn't feel him even in the forties. It was like there was this empty space where a person had been. Even if I could technically feel him, that doesn't mean I'll actually
Across the room, Tony was leaving the
"That's gotta suck."
Phil slithered up beside Steve, hands clasped neatly behind his back.  "Captain," he greeted him with a small, tense smile. "...happy birthday."
"No.  Come upstairs.  Be with Steve."
"Y'know, Pep, unless you're proposing a triad, I don't know why you're so goddamn involved in
"Tony?" Steve felt a lump well up in his own throat. "Please."
His heart was beating faster in his chest. Steve needed to focus, but Bucky was here, he was alive, he was okay, he was--
Iron Man?  Emphasis on
In an odd way Clint sometimes reminded him of Dugan, even though one was an Alpha and was one an omega... it didn't matter. They were both such warm-hearted people, and they let Steve in. So many soldiers and agents were closed off. They weren't like that.  He bet Clint and Dum-Dum would have been friends, if Dum-Dum were still alive.
"Okay," he sighed and moved forward to run a hand through Tony's hair, pushing it back from his forehead. "But at least get dressed first.  And... I'm gonna stay in here, maybe. I don't know if I want to watch. I don't really want to see you like that."
On the tarmac, there was a driver from Stark Industries waiting for them in a company car, and a huge smattering of people with cameras, microphones, and notepads, clamoring for a story.  Tony made a mental note to say thanks to Happy for the jeans. Before they disembarked, Pepper offered him a pair of sunglasses, which he took gratefully. They weren't prescription but Tony cared more about hiding behind them than the faint blurriness he was experiencing.
Tony felt a pang in his heart.  "...trust me, Pepper. It's worth it.  Please. Please? You're my accountant, you're my CFO, you're my golden girl... if anyone can free up ten million, it's you."
“And I never expected anything different from you, Mr. Stark.  I knew what your business was before I got into it.”  He’d read the dossier four times over the day he’d received it.  “And, for the record, I don’t feel
...sex?
"But your mom didn't want you to have an arranged bonding?" Pepper asked, straightening up after leaving ice outside of the den again.
Everyone laughed, loudly.  Taylor threw an arm around Steve and pulled out her phone.  "Selfie!" she announced.
Steve smiled patiently.  "What if I let you use something like a piece of ribbon? It's not a collar, but you could still tie it around and it would look close enough that you could pretend."
He put a hand on the back of the truck and sprang out, feeling happy and excited.  Karpov threw an arm around him and dragged him toward the edge of the road, flipping open the book with a sigh.  The soldier was still grinning. Karpov offered him a cigarette and he took it. He cupped the flame of a match in his hands to light it; Karpov was reading from the book.  "Желание. Ржавый. Семнадцать--"
"Are you ticklish?"
?" repeated Tony in horror, his voice going higher pitched than either of them were aware of.
That was out of line.  My bad.  Let's... er, let's go upstairs and tell them we cracked it."
They were barely outside for two minutes when Tony was gone and Steve realised with alarm that the crowd had taken him. It was omegas and betas with a splattering of Alphas amongst them. "Tony!" he yelled.  "Tony?!"  Someone tried to hand Steve a sign; he shoved them away, pushing into the crowd to find his mate.  He found him on the ground, getting kicked by at least five or six protesters.  "Let him go! What the hell do you think you're doing?!" Steve's 'captain' voice really was quite intimidating. The young crowd ignored him aside from a few at the edges. They turned to face Steve, instead of hollering abuse at Tony.
"Okay, fine.  Let's do it.  Let's rock n' roll."
On the seat beside Steve, Tony was running his hands all over the blond, practically purring.  Pepper was keeping a half-eye on them to make sure things stayed PG-13. She could tolerate a lot, but she drew the line at sitting next to Tony while he made love to his partner.
He curled an arm around Natasha's waist, catching her in the middle of the dance floor. "Enjoying terrorising the guests?" he teased gently as Natasha curled her arms around his neck.  He’d seen the accidental drink spill. Her smile was innocent but the glint in her eyes was wicked.
He was still deaf but that didn't matter.  The threat was over.
"...which is what qualifies you to run Rogers's charity!" said Tony, beaming.
"You might have worried people, but you kept Bucky and Tony apart. That would have been messy," Phil pointed out.
Steve hadn't expected that reaction. He didn't quite know what to think of it. If he hadn't had the serum in him Tony's tight grip probably would have left bruises. And then there was his top. "You can't just stop ruining my shirts, can you?" He asked, trying to joke weakly to calm Tony down.
Some of the things they got up to in the bedroom felt intimate not just because of the sex itself but because of the trust they put in each other.  They had both done and said things that would ruin them if it was put out in public. Steve in heat was not a pretty sight, certainly not that of strong, independent omega.  And Tony had done his fair share of dirty talking; if anyone ever heard half of the things he said to Steve in bed, they'd probably tear him to pieces.
"I was wondering what kind of fund raiser you were planning on doing," Banksy piped up. "You've got a lot of options."
The talk with Pepper... it had stirred up a lot of old memories, ones he'd buried long ago.  He'd never admitted his (quite genius, actually) mathematical model to anyone before. Pepper was a brilliant accountant and when she had said it wouldn't work...
ed again at Steve.
His mouth flooded and he choked, swallowed about half, then pulled off and gagged the rest into the sand.  Oh, fuck he could taste it.
. That was until the pain. He rubbed at the back of his neck subconsciously, Tony's scar a comforting bump in his skin.
"I think he feels pretty lost right now;" Steve murmured. "It's hard to tell what's Tony and what's not but...wherever he is, I'm not sure Bucky knows where he's going. My main fear now is that HYDRA could snap him up again and that could be it."
Tony drummed his fingers on his armrest, staring out the window as the plane made its way east.
Steve watched her go and then turned back, heading towards the bedroom. He swallowed and then knocked on the door before moving to open it. "Tony?" He called out. "Can I come in?"
So he
"Finally!  Christ! You people!" shouted Tony into the phone.  He turned to Donner. "Come on, get your shoes, we're going to pick up Steve."  He turned back to his cell. "Where is he? I'm getting my keys."
Tony climbed out of bed and approached Steve instead to get a better look at him.  He ran his hands over Steve, down his arms and down his sides, drinking in the sight of that uniform.
"So who did?" demanded Steve.
The van was gone.  He ran along the rooftops, following one van, then another, not sure where Karpov was.  He couldn't feel him.  Why couldn't he feel him?
"I don't think you need to think of it as a choice," disagreed Clint.  "The whole point of me inviting you here, Steve, was to show you that omegas don't have to be limited.  I think you need to talk it over with Tony and you two need to make a decision. And obviously, you need to protect yourself.  But hell... if you want two Alphas, I say go for it. It's not the forties anymore and it's okay for an omega to double-bond."
Steve took the plate and began to eat. It felt good to have something in his belly. He guessed now he was hanging up his shield he wouldn't need to keep eating shit-tons of protein and working out for hours and hours everyday. What was the point of keeping himself so stacked if he had nothing to do with it? Sure, the serum would always keep him fit, but his lack of discipline over the last two months had made him noticeably less bulky. Of course, he was still huge but his clothes weren't quite as tight on the shoulders as they used to be.
"Tony?"
His whole display was blinking red, as if he might have missed getting a grenade thrown at him and then bouncing off a couple of concrete walls.
When Donner got out of the car, he paused for a moment, looking down the street.  It was late enough that there were no people and very little traffic; the night was cool, but not overly so, and the streetlamps glowed resolutely, giving the world a warm hue.  The look on his face was hard to read, but it looked like he was suddenly aware of a wider world, one where people didn't shuttle him to and fro places... one that he could run away into.
Tony came to sputtering, all the fight out of him in an instant.
"...what's the
Since perusing her work, Tony couldn't get it off his mind.  He ordered Steve around all the time, but then again, he also ordered around Happy and Pepper (who were betas), and even Rhodey (who was an Alpha and more dominant than Tony was).
Perhaps "women" was hyperbole.  She was more likely a teenager, but her expression was an adult's and there were dark circles under her eyes that made her appear older initially.
Most of the plants had lost their flowers but about a third were already re-blooming.  Hopefully by June more than half would be in bloom. There were only a few Tony planned to keep: the one from Pepper, for example, had been lovingly placed in his workshop and was given particular amounts of attention compared to the rest.
"Me too," agreed Tony.
"Tony.  Steve is missing--"
!  If not for Steve, then for
"Hey, mithter!"
"So how about you guys all go out and give me and Steve some private time?"
He shook his head.  "No. Let him choose.  This is important," he said.  "This is him getting better."
"The Mark V. I need to talk to the Mark V- connect us, connect our headsets, right now. Find Rhodey--"
Wanda looked at Pietro.  She couldn't tell but she suspected a rabbit.  The man was lean, and he was blond. Omegas had an overwhelming tendency (thirty to fifty percent) to be blonds.
"They didn't. Oh my God, they didn't!" Steve fisted a hand in his hair and groaned. "JARVIS!  Call Tony down here!"
"He's with him!  He's with his other Alpha!  His
Also, Tony was increasingly aware of the divide in the omega rights movement.  He'd been doing his research. Status Alliance was much more extreme than The Horseshoe Society; Irshad Nazari was the head of the UN's Omega Rights Council, which technically bore no alliance to either organization.  But she seemed far more inclined toward the moderate, low-key activism of The Horseshoe Society, which had gotten omegas the right to vote, to go to universities. Jeffrey Walker, the head councilman of the society, was a low-key guy, and his mate, Brent, was likable.  Plus, Brent was a lawyer; Tony hoped he was one of the volunteers. He couldn't help but worry that Steve, whose activism seemed like the more extreme kind of activism, was getting overly cozy with Ty and Banksy. Status Alliance didn't even allow Alphas in, and it attracted a younger, more liberal crowd that probably hated Tony on principle.  Then again, Tony happened to like the members of the SA that he'd met so far. But he didn't want to have to win them over one by one.
"Mm-hm."
Tony sighed at the interruption.  "What, pal?"
healing, taking on the distinctive shape of a human bite mark.  Two half-circles, about eight marks in either crescent. Almost a circle.  The top bite deeper than the lower.
Oh, God.  SHIELD.
"Trust me, Steve, drinking helps me win. Besides, one shot won't make a difference." He ran a hand over Steve's arm, looking down at the rippling muscle.
"I've got connections.  They were... renting him out, essentially. We paid a lot for him but we got him out of there."
Tony, surprisingly, didn't react.  Or at least, not negatively. Instead, he replied, "Well, on such short notice, the Winter Soldier wasn't available.  He had an Elk Club meeting to get to."
Steve nodded.
too.  And I played D&D in college.  So I guess I can't talk, huh?"
want you."
"Pitbull is just a stage name," explained someone else.  For a split second, the idea of someone with a name like "Pitbull" called to mind all the omegas out there with silly little pet names, like DeSoto and Donner and Waffles.
She turned to glance at them, then did a double-take at Steve.  Alerted by her movements, the man turned as well.
"Exactly.  Which means he's still bonded to Barnes."
"...you're not going to iron them yourself?"
Poor Donner, who looked just like Steve, who was so small and cowed.  Who spoke in a soft, halting way, whose head was always ducked and shoulders always hunched.  Donner's only crime had been to check on some other omegas during the walk-out. Poor, gentle Donner hadn't walked out himself.  He'd only gone to speak with some others and said no to Gideon when called. And that one little word... that might have been his downfall.
"Who's Lola, another omega?"
"Heck," Steve whispered.
"Okay."
"I'm sorry, Colonel."
"Did he assault him?" asked Tony, point-blank.
He managed to pin him against the counter.  He could only hope that someone would tranq him, and fast.  He still hadn't eliminated the other target.
"Now, if you have to phone it in, and leave early, I don't really care," said Fury.  "But I've worked too hard to make the Avengers Initiative a reality.  I'm not going to let Howard Stark's son waltz in here, stick his dick into my team, and tear it to pieces.  So at least do me the favor, Steve, of
Why was he even thinking about it?
"It's not a matter of trusting
The fact that the Expo was destroyed, both physically and in reputation, didn't bother Tony in the slightest.  As he soared upward and it faded below him, he could see the drones starting to go off, but it didn't matter to him what Vanko did anymore, because the battle was over and won and everyone had been evacuated, at least as far as Tony knew.  He would have traded a hundred Expos for Steve's well-being; he couldn't shake the guilt, knowing that any injuries Steve had were entirely his fault, that he'd brought them here and Vanko had been after him.  He didn't care if Vanko was alive or dead, didn't care that Hammer had slithered off, and didn't care that tomorrow, the massive attack was probably going to be heavily reported on.  He only cared about Steve.  He was second-guessing himself, wondering if, in the moment Vanko had thrown Steve, he should have gone to Steve after all instead of Vanko, if he'd chosen incorrectly.
Steve looked shocked at himself. Shocked he'd actually said that. Because sure, he'd
The dust settled as he opened up a hole in the ceiling, and Clint, Natasha, and Phil peered down at him curiously.
"Got to be careful. You've got nice hands. Don't want to hurt your hands, Steve." It was interesting. Phil seemed far more concerned with Steve than any of the Alphas in the room, despite being in heat.
There had to be a better solution.
... someone should've told you...
"Sure thing."
Tony tried to call Pepper two more times; then his phone died and he took it as a sign to give up.  He closed his eyes and sat in the carpeted hall of the highrise, pressed against Steve's door, setting up a vigil for his omega.  Waiting for him to come home to him.
never been to a charity gala before," said Tony, rolling his eyes a little and clapping along with everyone else.
"...my room?" he suggested quietly.
Steve hesitated. "Well, I'm sorry about the consequences..  If Nick ever calls me government property again then I'm not coming back to SHIELD," he promised him, jaw tight.
Tony had barely gone a half-block before two SUVs pulled up.
Every Alpha in the immediate vicinity reacted like Tony had just told them the collar was poisoned and slowly killing them.  Donner had a brief smile that quickly disappeared, and he went back down to staring at the floor quietly, two steps behind Gideon.
"I can't believe I'm saying this, but I sure hope it's another subpoena," said Tony.  He crossed his fingers and pulled open the door himself.
The Alpha spoke for his mate, putting a loving hand on her arm.  "We don't care, so long as it's healthy and an Alpha."
"Tony?" she asked.
felt too hot. He felt ready to explode.
"An... infiltration?" Steve echoed, rubbing at his face as he tried to understand.
"So... mostly, we'll just be filming things as they come to us.  This is a very candid interview and a few other omega celebrities are being featured in this documentary.  But I understand Steve would also like an independent segment that's a bit more formal.  So we'd like Steve on the couch here," said Louis, gesturing toward Tony's sleek white sofa, "with one of the orchids on the side table there.  I think it'll be a nice back-drop, a little reminder of your being bonded and all. Ah... would you rather wear something less...?" He trailed off.  Steve was in work-out clothes.
A group of nurses walked past in the corridor. They were chatting amongst themselves; they quieted when they glanced in and saw Steve's sleeping form.  Tony glared back protectively, arms wrapped around his omega.
"Steve." Fury sighed. "Nothing is black and white, remember. There's good and bad in everything. I know the tesseract caused a lot of harm-"
, but hey, look, you were spying on me, too.  Forgive and forget if it'll get me on the team.  ...I wanna be there with you, Steve."
Diane laughed.  "I know, I know, it comes naturally to them, but still,
When they laid down Tony sprawled out over Steve's back because that was the most comfortable position they could muster.
Steve spotted a park nearby. He didn't know it but he was sure it was probably a semi-famous one. The weather was mild, or at least, it wasn't raining. Sunlight tickled through the clouds but it was still a little cold for Steve's liking.
"I thought we didn't do home visits anymore?" he tried to joke.
Pepper reached out and picked it up, examining it.  A well-worn, sepia-toned photo showed two men on a pier, smiling, arms around each other.  One was handsome, in uniform. The other was a head shorter, with light hair, wearing slacks and a white button-up and suspenders: civilian clothes.  It took her a moment, but there was no mistaking the likeness. The civilian was Steve.
He called Fury.  "Hey, Nick. Barnes's vitals are elevated today.  He might be waking up again."
"It's not a long drive," Rhodey said. "Right?"
"Hey, is that..." Steve's eyes narrowed as he spotted something big and got up. He ripped off a corner of paper wrapping. "It's a canvas!" exclaimed in surprise and excitement.  He dragged the paper back, revealing the painting.
Steve actually fell asleep on Tony shortly after throwing his phone against the wall. He'd been up for over twelve hours after the dream having woken him and his session in the gym. Tony had slept far more through out the day and it was about time Steve played catch up. Fortunately, he didn't dream. His mind was merciful for the few stray hours. Steve shifted a little in his sleep, let out a few mumbles and quiet sounds but he still didn't dream.
"I think he wanted to be taken in. Or he wanted a fight. Either way, that's where he ended up." Jasper said. "I swear. This is all I know. Please! I don't know anything else!"
Steve let out a frustrated huff.  "Tony, slow down, where are you--"
"I like people who work with people.  If you get my drift."
"Captain.  You're obviously not thinking very clearly."  Rumlow's voice dropped so that it was quiet. "You're in preheat and you're emotional.  You need to come with me. You can't just sit out here; people are noticing. And if you lash out, you could hurt someone.  Come on, I'm on a STRIKE team with Agent Romanov. You can trust me." He gave Steve a very gentle tug, them repeated, "It's not just for your safety or for the safety of your image, Captain.  It's for the safety of the people. You've already got about a dozen civilian onlookers, and you're going to attract some Alphas."
"Not a conventional dad, yeah, I get it. You're not asking Tony to have kids now, you just want him to understand that there could be a possibility for it. Whatever."
Steve shrugged sheepishly and sipped at his drink. Bands that a lot of people fawned over didn't hold the same nostalgia for Steve. He often found it hard to appreciate why some bands were legendary and others weren't.
Steve whimpered as Tony began to mouth at him in earnest. They didn't do this to often, or rather...Tony didn't too often to him. But Steve
Her attention had gotten the notice of a few other people at the bar and Tony could see patrons being to mill around, craning their necks, trying to get a glimpse, discussing Steve and Tony's presence in hushed, excited voices.  He should have known their anonymity wouldn't last long. Steve, after all, had been stirring things up for a year, and Tony had had a couple of tours in the Middle East in his Iron Man suit. You'd have to live under a rock not to know the two of them.
The omega was weeping softly in his cell.
at him. "Oh," she breathed, lips twitching up in a half smile. "You are good at this." Then she pulled back. "I see there's a lot of bad habits to iron out. Goodness knows why he thinks he's in charge."
Tony scratched his elbow idly as he lit the fireplace.  "Much better," he sighed, rubbing his left arm subconsciously.
Tony stood up and put a hand on Steve's shoulder, unhappily noting that Steve was taller.  "Steve." His voice was stern. "Sit down."
"Do you still have Bunny?"
Tony was still, somehow, alive.  Still breathing.  He felt betrayed by his own body for somehow being able to maintain its aliveness even though his world was crashing down around his shoulders.  His heart was aching, aching like it was going to claw out of his chest.  He looked down, wondering if it was the arc reactor, but no, the device looked stable.  Tony's eyes wandered down to his hands and he observed with mild interest that he was shaking violently.  Every breath hurt; icy needles... was this a panic attack?  If so, it was like nothing Tony had ever felt before.
"You two are a thing?  But she's like-- like a nine out of ten!  And you're a six on a good day!"
Tony lasted a full twelve seconds post-knotting, which was, honestly, remarkably given the circumstances.  He thrust into his omega, hard and fast and sharp, and when he finally reached climax, he buried his cock, pumping his semen into the other, his mouth clamped firmly over Steve's neck, groaning low with the satisfaction of release.
Tony's mouth twitched a little.  "A little bit," he conceded, turning slightly to return the kiss.  "M'glad you don't think I'm an ass. Well, I mean, I am, obviously, but not for this."  He rolled over to face Steve. "...you know why omegas originally wore collars?" he asked quietly, suddenly serious.  "I was reading about the history on Wikipedia... it was to protect their necks. Because if you were wearing a thick metal collar, no other Alpha could bond you.  And if you were... if you were sold at auction or force-bonded, and then met an Alpha you actually liked... whose scent appealed to you... it wouldn't matter. You couldn't be rebonded."  Tony's voice had gone quiet. "I mean, it was a way to keep forced bonds intact." Tony lapsed into silence. He was thinking of Boswell and Banksy, who seemed so happy together, but whose bond had been forced.  In all likelihood, Banksy had been sold to Boswell, like a dog or a dressage horse.
"--okay, but, men and women wear wedding rings, and no one cares about that, right?"
In any case, his hackles were up, and his arms were out protectively, shielding the girl.
"That's a good idea," Steve affirmed. "But Jesus...that means we have a lot of orchids. I thought maybe the old tradition would have died out by now...or maybe it's because I'm old. I don't know," he mused, turning his head as his gaze flitted around the room. "Rich people really will buy anything, won't they?"
Tony laughed breathlessly.  He loved hearing his name, and he loved hearing Steve beg for him. Seeing Steve in ecstasy was almost as good as the actual physical sensation of fucking him.  He was more than happy to comply, to do whatever things Steve wanted, as long as it kept Steve moaning and squirming under him.  He shifted slightly, finding the perfect angle to stroke Steve's prostate, delighting in the way his fingers curled into Tony's hair and the whimpering, shuddering gasps he made under Tony.
"You not gonna tell me about what it was like revisiting the forties for the weekend?" Sam teased gently. Steve could hear rustling in the background,; perhaps he was eating chips.
Steve smiled a little.  "Well, yeah, but I didn't want to shoot anyone.  I didn't romanticize it.  ...my point is, people nowadays glorify my war.  War World II. And they're doing the same to you, about Afghanistan. And I'm sorry."
Natasha snorted.  "You couldn't just stay at home like most people, could you?"
"F-fuck..." Steve groaned, hands clenching into the fabric of the sofa.
Tony nodded solemnly.  ";Cause of the gland," he said, wisely.
been busy.
Natasha, Sam, Clint, and Tony crouched in a dark storage area, crowded behind a couple of barrels marked with biohazard stickers.  Natasha had taken the lead; she'd obtained a truck (undoubtedly stolen; Tony noted with admiration that she'd hot-wired it); she'd gotten them into the facility, dropping two guards silently, one with a shank to the kidney and another with a ruthlessly efficient twist to the neck.  They were now in possession of a key card, though it wasn't clear what level of access a look-out would have. Probably not to any of the lower levels, which is where they all guessed someone like Steve would be held.
Steve thanked him and assured him that,
Steve whined as Tony got up behind him. his front draping over his back. Steve gripped the cushions of the sofa for purchase, his forehead pressed against the edge as he offered up his neck to Tony. He trembled at the first drag of teeth and then moaned as Tony's teeth sank down into his neck. He got wetter, the sensation a delight. "Yours. Yours. Please Tony, I need-" He choked a little as Tony nudged against his entrance.
Tony's brain was moving sluggishly but it was able to come up with a half-dozen scenarios already.  He was hoping they were going to get a hearty congratulations and then be left alone, but it was more likely that they needed Iron Man for some bullshit international conflict involving terrorists with rocket launchers; or they needed Captain America to come handle a hostage crisis; or they wanted an emergency briefing on what, exactly, had gone down at the Expo.
But Steve hadn't stepped outside, away from the school, to check his messages.
"...Tony and Steve's house," said Rhodey, and Donner visibly cringed at the mention of Steve; Rhodey quickly backtracked.  "There'll be other omegas there, too. There's a guy named George and a guy named David--"
It was a weird question.  Tony's fingers paused, still touching the overlap of the two marks.
Steve refused to face Tony; Tony rubbed his back soothingly.  Tony couldn't help but feel a little bit hurt because he understood why Steve felt so confused.  Steve wanted to be good for his Alpha, but subconsciously, that was Bucky.
, from the soft blond hair to the relatively hairless jawline.  (Steve maintained sideburns that had taken him well over eight months to actually grow.)
"Drive," Steve told Bucky matter-of-factly. He was about to add 'they'll be tracking us' when he realised.
"Steve--" Banksy patted his arm. "Just have fun tonight, okay? You earned it. And so did you." He bopped Tony on the nose with his forefinger. "All the best people are here. You're gonna love it. Come on, come on...let me introduce you into some people. And drinks! Someone get Steve and Tony drinks!"
Time to accomplish something.
"Absolutely not," said Tony.  "Steve, there's a swarm of vultures- sorry, I meant reporters- standing outside this hospital waiting for us to leave.  I don't want to look hurt.  Besides,  I'm
"Ours names aren't stupid," said the boy.
Steve let out a quiet sound as Tony's knot squeezed out. He shivered, feeling a little spent slip out down the curve of his thigh like a claim. "If anyone can handle this, it's us," he murmured in agreement. "We've got this. We really do."
was a great unifying force.  Rhodey saw an opportunity and took it.  "You like
"You don't know what will happen
A lot of things were different in the 21st century, but not the way omegas were treated.  Not a lot, anyway.
"--which in turn triggers pheromones that affect the Alpha."
?  Open your ears, boy!  Light!  Here!"
JARVIS was silent.
"Obie said that once," said Tony in a distant voice.  "Hey, can you hand me that Satsuma vase?"
He lunged over the counter; the other blonde was scrambling across the floor toward the first.
"Fuck it," he said hoarsely.  "I'll buy a new bath.. Steve... Steve, that was amazing..."  Tony reached up shakily to touch Steve's cheek and suddenly he felt a weird lump in his throat and his eyes were brimming with tears.  "...f-fuck... fuck, you really... you really spangled my stars, Captain, holy shit, that was good..."
"I think so."  Her voice sounded quieter. More distant.  "His mind is very scattered."
"I'm not supposed to tell anyone the location of the bases," mumbled Bucky.  He was being asked to go against his very programming. Karpov would never let him tell Steve their coordinates, he knew that.  "...would... would it be with tongue?" he asked, remembering how upset Steve was about the tongue thing.
"Mm-hm.  Him and Hammer got into a bidding war.  It was intense."
"Sure!  They love him!" said John.  He was almost shouting. Nearly every sentence he said with a sort of aggressive enthusiasm.
what the fuck--"
Steve was seated on the edge of the bed, his head in his hands. His shoulders were shaking a little. He lifted his head up and steepled his hands beneath his chin, his eyes watering a little, but he wasn't crying. He stared at the wall straight ahead and didn't look at Phil when he came in.
"Thank you," he replied quietly, his smile not quite meeting his eyes. "Well, they were going to find out anyway."
Brock sighed next to him. "It's just water, Steve. You gotta trust us."
It took Tony's mind a moment to process Steve's words because his mouth was watering.  He suddenly desperately wanted sex. The faint slipperiness on the fingers from Steve's glands expressing themselves was disgusting but also insanely sexy.
"--you said sold."
Boswell Mackabee strolled into the room trailed a dozen people.  He was dressed in one of his usual dour suits, a dark grey pinstripe with a dark burgundy tie.  He held a glass of scotch in one hand. And Tony was surprised to discover that, although he was just as tall as Tony had imagined, he was not the overly dominating Alpha Tony would have assumed.  He, like Tony, didn't exude dominance.
. Isn't that how it works? I'm confused. Has someone been lying to me?  These are my orchids, aren't they?"
"I believe I already have," Steve murmured with a small, genuine smile. He offered Ellis a small nod, which was returned.
He stared out the window, brooding; Steve's phone pinged again.  Tony glanced down.  "You gonna answer that?" he asked.  He didn't mean to sound irritated but it came off that way.  He felt like he'd aged years in the span of one day.  Steve had been right about the simulation being isolating.  And he was still trying to shake off the effects, try to sort through his memories.
On the radio, three people were having a heated argument about omega rights.
"Of course you do... Steve. Pee on one of them-"
Tony pointed up at the stage and turned to a woman beside him.  "That's
He could feel his pain and anguish and roiling confusion; it tugged at Steve's chest like asthma and ice. He stumbled a little, falling heavily in the doorway as he clutched at the wall. "Fuck,"  Steve whispered and looked down at himself. Something was wrong.  He felt a weird tremor of nausea deep in his gut.  He felt... strange inside. He ran a hand down himself, but he couldn't find any injuries. He pushed on.
She laughed a little.  "Oh, so you and Captain America are on holiday, are you?"
Pepper's voice left no room for negotiation.  Tony dropped it, looking sour. He knew that there was no point in arguing.  At least he could say, truthfully, that he liked all the bodyguards. Except maybe Bethany.  Well, no, that wasn't true, he liked Bethany a lot. Too much, actually. He'd slept with her years ago, had a whirlwind affair, been briefly engaged (for literally less than twenty-four hours), released a sex tape with, and gotten into multiple out-and-out drunken fistfights, some publicly, before finally breaking up.  Tony hadn't seen her in over a decade and could only conclude that Pepper's inclusion of her on guard detail was probably some sort of petty revenge. They'd never gotten along. Probably because they were both redheads and Tony frequently dropped hints about which one was his "favorite" in the hopes of sparking a sexy catfight.  The catfight never happened, but not for lack of trying.
"Ha. Of course." He pressed the button for the fourth floor. "Bet Mr. Stark is regretting betting himself instead of you now, if he's been stuck in the garage."
Wanda waved a hand and the television turned off.  Bucky hit the power button on the remote; Pietro took the remote away, and Wanda turned the television off again.
"What are you talking about, Steve?"
"Tony-" Steve turned back to face him. "Come on. They've seen enough. Don't upset Pepper. You're better than this."
When Tony curled his fingers around his cock Steve literally cried out and arced up into the touch, his feet pressing into the alpha's back all the more because of it. "Tony-Tony...ah,
"Steve.  That file you sent me... we have a problem."  Phil took a deep breath. "First of all, the WSC has enough shit on you and Tony to put you both away for life.  Could we get Gideon fired? Possibly. Would he retaliate? Yes. Is it worth it? No. Second of all, you're the one who was... was... what was that,
"Tell Tony to bid on me!  I'm good!" cried Sixteen.
"Tony's doing well, considering, but it's the twenty-fifth anniversary of... you-know-what, so he's just kind of out of it all the time."
Tony watched Steve undoing his belt with interest.  His shorts were so tight that they might as well have been painted on.
Natasha gave him an incredulous look.  Coulson shrugged slightly.
"Like a billion dollars," said Tony lazily, smiling back at Steve.  "Did you have a good secret meeting?  Was it about me?  Was it with SHIELD?  Is that the good news?  ...you forged my signature and put in an application and now I'm officially an Avenger?  Because I already told you, I don't play nice with others.  ...you look tired.  I smell something amazing.  Did you buy a cake?  Is that the surprise?  A cake?  Is a sexy lady going to pop out of it?"  Tony paused to take a breath, then pulled back the covers invitingly.  "...wanna nap with me?  I kept the bed warm for you.  Also, I jacked off on one of your shirts.  I'm not going to apologize for that, though.  Most people would
He clapped his hand together and rubbed them together, and looked down at the charred remains of the film reel.  He stared at it for a moment.  "JARVIS?  ...were you... did you happen to record...?"
He was confused about Fury wanting him to make contact with anyone in MI-13. Steve thought he was out of the game?  Why was SHIELD telling him to do anything anymore?
"Well, where do female omegas go?"
"Yes you were," Steve disagreed softly.  He curled an arm around him, letting Banksy slump against him. "That's what a bond means. You were there with him. You're always with him. Even till the end of the line."
The collar looked brutal. Not deceivingly beautiful like all the gemmed and shiny collars at the conference. It looked heavy and oppressive and...inescapable.
. He'd been sweating no less than ten minutes ago and now he was shivering, his face pale.
He offered Tony a stack of pancakes, but Tony, who was sitting on the counter, had frozen and was staring off into the distance.  The hand gripping his drink was white-knuckled. "...Mr. Stark?" James looked at Steve, confused. Tony had turned off like a robot.  "Hey, uh, Mr. Stark? ...hello...?"
," said Natasha.  Sam did, but a moment later, Natasha was defending Tony again.  "You think anyone around here was thrilled when Clint brought me back?  Huh?  You think Clint didn't hear everyone telling him he could do better than some Soviet assassin?  You think we didn't deal with rumors about me being a spy or a mole or something for
.."  The fact that the interview had been planned for months didn't matter.  Tony hated mornings and hated morning people. Steve was always up at the crack of dawn.  There was no doubt in his mind that Pepper and Aria were downstairs already, cups of coffee in one hand and Blackberries in the other.
Brent was scribbling notes down like a maniac, holding out a recorder to the phone.
Tony's brain cycled through emotions rapidly.  Surprise at Steve's sudden movement; fear at feeling his hand grabbed; excitement as Steve body-checked him.
Tony rubbed his back soothingly.  "It's not your fault Gideon Malick is a fucking asshole.  Donner was a goner from the moment he was bonded. ...wow, try saying that five times fast.  Happy, take us downtown. Steve... it's okay. We're going to go find him, right now."
The two shared a grin like they'd just made a hilarious inside joke.
"My name is Richard Thompson, thank you," said George.
Tony spotted the drink in his hand and glared, checking his watch.  It wasn't even nine in the morning yet.  He felt the back of his neck bristle.
"It wasn't you that put me in danger Tony. I put myself in danger," Steve pointed out calmly, his voice quiet but steady.
"Love you too," Steve whispered, finally managing to get his words out, his eyes glazed over with arousal and something more. "So much-
. Let go of my other arm."
Tony fell asleep holding onto Steve, his face pressed into Steve's neck, savoring the comfort of the other man's body, every thought blissful as he drifted off.
The girl held out a paper cup to him.  "Coffee helps headaches," she said.
The idea of distracting themselves and focusing on each other was appealing. It was exactly what Steve needed in that moment. They grabbed towels on the way out (and the condoms; Steve did, admittedly, turn a little pink when he grabbed them.) Then they headed down to the pool. The gardens had high walls around them so there was a sense of security and privacy. Steve felt safe here, despite being outside.  The only part of Tony's estate not protected by fences, hedges, and high-tech security was the western border, which was a sheer cliff-face that fell into the Pacific ocean.  There was a tiny strip of beach down there but as far as Steve knew, it was utterly inaccessible from Tony's house.
"Howard." Steve's hand snapped up, catching the other's wrist. He could easily break it. But he wouldn't. Steve stood and moved away from him. His head throbbed. He was confused. Since when did Howard come into his room unannounced and give him clothes to wear? And since when was he on
Tony snarled suddenly.  "Since when were you a pop psychologist?  Leave me alone, Pepper."
Tony glared at her.  He accepted a glass of water.
"Piper's turning eighteen next April."
"He didn't mean that, Steve.  He's drunk," said Pepper, who had been watching the alcohol level in Tony's body slowly approach the bottom.  She set a comforting hand on Steve's shaking shoulder.
Tony set his chin on Steve's shoulder, kissing his neck.  "Amazing," he mumbled hoarsely.  Steve's body was broad and warm and solid beneath him.  Better than any mattress.
He looked up.  It was dark.  Yinsen was quiet.
He fell back into a usual routine. In the morning he went jogging, but that was all. Maybe he would lose some of the more intense muscle definition he had but he didn't really mind. There was no point spending six hours a day in the gym if he wasn't going to do anything with it. Besides, now Steve had bigger things on his mind: like Project Eighty-Four. At the moment he was just spending half his days on the phone to lawyers, mostly omega ones, that Aria had put him in touch with. It was slow starting, it was just conversations, but it was a promise of what was to come.
She scanned the crowd imperiously.  "
"Yes.  Do it," demanded Tony.  He dropped onto the white leather couch in his boxers and motioned Steve over.  "Let me see the photo shoot. You work your omega charm... Rhodey'll do it for you."  Tony didn't add that if Rhodey didn't, they were probably screwed. He didn't know many unbonded Alpha males.  At his age, most were bonded. And since his mating to Steve, there were a lot more omegas and betas in his life than there ever had been.
The man didn't look remotely tired for 3am. Perhaps he never even slept. Steve wouldn't be surprised.
"Don't you
"Thanks," said Tony, pointing at him and then going back to his cake.  "The subpoenas are on the table... go ahead and help yourself. I super-hate going to court so if you can just absorb, deflect, and delay all of them as much as possible...?"
"I'll come by early tomorrow morning. Shower for nine, and smart clothes!" she shouted and then she was heading out.
The next hour went by, slowly, uncomfortably.  When Tony's phone beeped, he jumped.
Selfishly, sometimes he wished Steve were smaller.
!" exclaimed Pepper, throwing up her hands.
He could see Clint in him. He could see it immediately. Except he looked naked and afraid and ready to throw the cup that had supposedly come with the plate.
Tony ignored her, only because his mouth was full of turkey and he couldn't have gotten out a retort if he wanted to.
He couldn't help but look down at Tony stroking his own erection, blue eyes dark as his throat went Steve. He hesitated, clearly wanting to touch Tony, please him in some way, but he complied. He wasn't entirely sure what Tony would want them to do, but he was excited to find out.
He wanted it. Steve had missed it. He wanted to feel Tony inside of him again. They'd made love so much, and it was sweet when it was tender...but he wanted them to
Everyone else was chatting, like this was just a normal business venture; the pizza boxes were passed around, over the tops of cubicles and around desks.  Brent tossed his tie over his shoulder so he wouldn't get sauce on it.
Tony watched Steve wiggle into his underwear, his hips movingly enticingly, not moving to put on his clothes.  Steve tucked his shirt in and began tying his tie, brow furrowed, tongue out, with military precision. The dark blue made his eyes look brighter than ever; when he looked over at Tony, Tony stared, taking a moment to process the question.
," added Freak viciously, like this was one of the worst things she could think of to say about someone.  "I bet he
Steve was a little disturbed at the request but soon realized Bucky's intention as he held his lighter up to the material of his shirt. He blinked and almost smiled. Bucky might just be onto something. They might just get out of here.
"Sorry, had to thin out the fan club... I'm heading over to the main stage to see if I can find Hammer... he'll know where Vanko is.  JARVIS, can I get a status update?"
On the other side, someone banged several times in response, as if worried Tony and Vim might give up.
Tony's bodyguards dispersed, giving Tony and Steve a clear line; Malick had beaten them there and was already sitting at a table by the window.
"That's right," said Pepper.
"He only needs a few minutes to kill him."
tell me you want to wear my collar.  My collar that we were
Karpov nodded to Steve and then to the director.  The director glared. "You're late."
Maria whipped around; the camera crew, Gleason, Pepper, and Aria were all far too involved with Steve and Tony to notice anything amiss.  Yet.
"Now!"
"Sorry, sorry, sorry," said Phil, a little too quickly, moving the pieces of confetti around the table with all the anxious self-seriousness of a hamster.
Steve turned to look at Tony. "That was amazing," he breathed. "Was that over... like, did he say he supported camps and shit?"
here just to talk about Steve Rogers?"
Steve's mind was still reeling, but he was dragged back to the present when Pepper burst in, quickly tugging up the sheets to cover up his naked thigh. He liked to try and keep himself at least partly decent around Pepper, even though he had been naked that one time and thrown up on her.
Fury reached over and tapped on the glass.
"Thanks, boss," said Happy sarcastically.  It was lost on Tony, whose dander was up. He looked over at Steve in alarm, as if to ask if he knew about this.
Tony had a trail of beautiful women in his life. Steve didn't know why he'd kindled that flicker of hope that maybe
He looked up at Tony when the question was asked, the blue of his eyes just discernible in the dimmed lights. "If you what?" Steve asked softly.
Natasha didn't say anything.  She didn't need to.  Her expression spoke volumes.
There was a gentle splash and Pepper glanced outside automatically. "Oh Lord," she muttered at seeing a very naked Steve. At least
Now it was Trickshot's turn to be confused.  "No, because he's deaf."
Carter, I was thinking.  About SHIELD.  You know, part of the reason it's weird for me to join is, I don't want to just follow in my dad's footsteps.  Sometimes I feel like I don't have a lot of... control over my life.  Like, it seems like I keep getting dragged into things he was involved with.  The company, and now SHIELD..."  He shrugged a little.
And he also knew that Steve's anger was coming from a place of horror.  Because both of them were imagining where the hell Donner was, what had happened to him.
"They're
"How could I
Maybe it was against the stereotype. Alphas were supposed to protect their mates. But Steve felt it went both ways- they were both responsible for each other. He would die for Tony in a heartbeat. Maybe that made him a little insane. But he was okay with being a little insane for Tony.
"I made my decision a very long time ago, Nat," Steve breathed and then made his way out of the gym.
He got up suddenly and crossed the room.  He grabbed a book off the table and tore out a page from the back, then walked back over to the bed.  He tore a long strip of paper, twisted it, licked the ends, and stuck them together. "...
"Steve--" Nick sighed. He barely ever called him just
"So what's left? If he can't go to SHIELD then where can he go? We can't just leave him out there! HYDRA will get him eventually."
Rhodey looked at him incredulously.  "Who are you, and what have you done with the real Tony Stark?"
Tony was unable to keep from rolling his eyes.  "Spare me the speech, Cap. No offense but you have no idea what it's like from the Alpha perspective.  It's like if I gave you a wedding ring and then one day saw you traded it for someone else's. I
The woman looked alarmed.  "I'm taking the children to breakfast."
"About you, baby.  What else?" he said.  He gave a single, lazy kick, drifting slowly across the pool.  He paused. "...you... you felt it, didn't you? That you were turning me on?  I'm sorry, Steve, I'm trying to be sensitive to all the shit you're going through, but... but I haven't seen in you in the flesh for months and now you're here in my pool and I forgot how goddamned hot you are.  I was just gonna go rub one out but... yeah, no, it's fine." Tony twisted, righting himself suddenly, treading water. "Hey, Steve? Remember how when I asked to see your neck you made me promise not to hate you?  You know I could never hate you for that, right? I mean, you didn't make that decision to accept the mark. Your body did. And it did what it did for a very legit biological reason, which is, let's face it, Barnes is a hell of a lot more dominant than me."
"Steve, I don't... I don't want to break the bond, I'm sorry I upset you," he choked out, burying his face into Steve's neck.  Steve's whole body was shining with sweat even though he was naked. Tony's teeth brushed against Steve's skin, his throat... he found Steve's hand and tangled their fingers together.  "This sucks, this fucking sucks, in movies and porn and stuff, heats are always fun and sexy..." whined Tony, pushing Steve down. He kneed Steve's legs apart and pulled away from Steve's neck to observe his face.
Aria continued to ignore Tony.  On her phone, there were six calls from Clint already.  Clearly, he'd been spooked by Tony's text about his having a family and wanted to figure out what was going on from Steve.
It was a struggle getting Steve all the way out to the car when he couldn't support his own body weight. Steve was obviously upset, but proud of Donner. Still sedated and struggling to control his own limbs, he felt devastated by his own weakness, scared, violated, dirty, relieved, and fiercely satisfied with Donner finally standing up for himself.  It was a confusing state of mind for his preheat. The sergeant helped Steve sit down in the back seat of the car, his feet hanging out.
Tony glared at them as they left.  First agents Barton and Romanoff, the two of them looking deadly in their tactical gear.  Then agent Coulson, looking crisp and professional in his well-cut suit.  And finally, the odd man out, Steve, his leather biking jacket thrown over his once white button-up shirt.  Steve paused at the door and turned, as if expecting Tony to change his mind.  Tony kept his arms folded and his glare fixed, and then Steve turned and left.
didn't get me. I'm here. I came straight to you."
Now a dog wasn't a bad idea. Maybe Steve could get one big enough to go running with him...
"...I still love you.  Just let me feel bad about it, okay?  It's an Alpha territory thing."
"...Steve, I work as a publicist in Southern California," said Aria with a hint of exasperation in her voice.  She steered the conversation, expertly, away from herself. "I'm more worried about Stark's drinking. That man had a problem.  I had a chat with his ex, Beth. She's great. ...but Tony's addiction problems, those seem like they're pretty far-reaching. So.  Your anniversary. Virginia and I were thinking somewhere in Europe. What do you think?"
?” said Tony, staring at Steve incredulously, lowering the carton of juice.  Steve gave a sheepish shrug.
"C'mon," said Pepper wearily, pulling his arm around her shoulders to drag him out of the crowd.  She nodded to Aria; Aria swooped in to grab Steve.
He gave Steve a push and Steve flopped readily down, as compliant as ever.  Tony pointed the dildo at him. "You want this?"
Tony's dander rose.  In fact, it spiked like it hadn't since the last time he had been fighting in the suit, in Yemen.  The collar pressed down on the sensitive hair, and it was painful enough to make Tony's eyes water slightly.
.  Dad's probably rolling in his grave," murmured Tony.  He gave Steve's neck a slow, gentle kiss.  Despite his words, he was too love-drunk to actually feel any real concern.  No.  There wasn't a single ounce of doubt in Tony's mind.  He felt like he should be freaking out--
Tony let out a breathy moan when Steve pushed himself down over his cock.  "You are good," he murmured, putting his hands on Steve's hips. He ran his hands over his sides briefly before he began moving him.  They found each other's rhythm in an instant, their bodies in tune, knowing what they wanted and how to get it. Tony closed his eyes, moaning blissfully at the way Steve's body milked his knot, massaging it, the warmth and pressure from his omega creating just the right amount of friction and smoothness.
Tony growled in response, baring his teeth, hair up and muscles tensed.
"Hey, if it's Nat, you should ask to talk to Clint.  One omega to another," suggested Tony from the kitchette. "...I'm pretty sure he would agree with me, though.  Putting yourself through this, it's not proving anything, man. Like, you don't need to hit your hand with a hammer to show off how high your pain tolerance is, you know?  Fuck Malick, don't do this just to prove a point." Tony rummaged around the fridge. He was starving.
"Watch it, spade," said the man without turning.
Nicky's eyebrows rose. "You didn't mention that before."
"Steve, Dr. Gleason called and left a message, he'd like you to call him back, and Natasha wants to see you before Christmas," Pepper informed him, tapping away on her BlackBerry.  "Tony, you were actually likeable for once, good job, guys, so far we're getting a lot of positive reviews..."
"...of course he did," she said, her friendly tone evaporating.
"Dad's pretty bad at video games," said Cooper off-handedly, tearing across to another part of the room.  "And this is a real antler I found in the woods from a deer. Dad helped me clean it. I have to keep it on the shelf so Lucky doesn't chew it up.  ...or Lila."
"...well... c'mon. Let's get you to your little omega kindergarten."  Tony looked at Steve apologetically. Rubbing shoulders with rich conservative assholes, drinking, and gambling were all things Tony excelled at. He felt bad that Steve was going to be in some other hall with a bunch of Stockholm-syndrome-having nobodies.
"Thanks for coming over.  You're welcome here anytime," said Natasha, wrapping an arm around him, her other arm gripping Lila, who was not-quite-crying but definitely working herself up.
lie.  And that's not the man I am. So get out."
.  The word was strange and heavy in his mouth.  Tony only dated women.  But Steve was an omega.  That changed things, right?  Tony was curious to see how the media represented this.  Tony was bonded, which was unexpected.  He was bonded to an unnaturally powerful omega who was also Captain America, recently outed- also quite unexpected.  And they were both men, which didn't really matter for pair-bonds, but mattered to Tony, who had always been fairly emphatic about being straight as an arrow.  He was hoping no one misrepresented his sudden bonding to a man to mean that he'd been on the down-low this whole time.  It wasn't like he'd gotten to choose, really.  Their bodies had chosen for them, their pheromones pairing them up like some sort of evolutionary match-maker.
Tony and Boswell had long since finished primping and they were on their second glass of scotch, chatting like old friends. Tony had discovered that Boswell, despite his hang-dog face and serious mannerisms, was actually pretty friendly.  He reminded Tony of Stane back before he'd...
"So he's ninety-two?  Awesome," said Tony.  A look of realization crossed his face; his eyes widened.  "Wait a second.  You were born on Independence Day?
Steve felt head as Tom guided his hands down and around his cock. He stroked him slowly, his expression one of awe as he felt his own member twitch. He felt wet between his thighs and shivered. Steve looked up at him with dark eyes, lips parted. Suddenly the blankets around them felt too hot.
Tony saw a flicker of hesitation before Steve got up and went to grab the condoms.  He settled onto the bed, smirking, feeling content; Steve returned and lobbed the box next to him.
"Sorry. I was kinda busy. And I threw my phone against a wall."
His brain was telling him that the best two ways to get it were by being ass-kissingly kind to Steve and by tearing apart anyone who dared look at Steve.  Since the second one was impossible (it was just the two of them), Tony was focused on the first one.  If Steve had told him to jump out the window, suitless, Tony would have launched himself off the seventeenth-story balcony in a heartbeat.  He wanted to impress Steve, to show him that he was the
"...better," said Pepper.
For the first time since 1943, he could feel Bucky.
Tony had to admit, he liked Natasha in that moment.  Tony had always considered himself a libertarian, someone who was socially progressive but who felt government was inherently corrupting and that society was better off without any of the meddlesome agencies that tried to restrain it.
Steve was still shaking visibly. He'd never felt so disgusted in his entire life. It just kept getting worse. They'd thought the auction on tonight was bad enough, and now this... this was the kind of shit SHIELD would deal with. Steve didn't want a bring a load of lawsuits against the kind of people who would abuse and mutilate these abandoned omegas. He wanted to hunt them down and
"It was on this floor, right?" Natasha asked softly, gun extended.
"Headed to the jet. Less than five minutes away," came Natasha's voice over the comms as Steve and Tony made their way through the first level.  They had seen no guards, presumably because most of the base was evacuating. "We'll come pick you up. What's your position?"
The corner of her mouth twitched.  "Oh, God... it was awful," she said, struggling not to smile.
Steve still looked shocked.
If you wanted to be Freudian about it, he suspected you could blame his parents, and especially his father, because the Stark household hadn't been an overly friendly one; they didn't hug, didn't tell each other they loved one another, didn't do family vacations or even really family activities.  Howard was too busy working, and Maria was too busy with her charities, and Tony preferred to be left alone so that he could destroy various electronics.
"Confirm!" he barked automatically.
and it rankled Tony to see Pepper treating Steve like he was her equal.
"That would be great, if we could find a supplier.  But human trafficking is ironically hard to traffic," said Brent, crossing his arms.  "We need a source."
"Come on... let's just relax the rest of the day... forget the collar thing, Steve, it was stupid anyway..." said Tony.  Steve looked a lot calmer but Tony didn't care; as far as he was concerned, they were through looking at collars. It wasn't worth seeing his mate freaking out like this.
The morning of the security council meeting Steve was actually kind of excited. He couldn't wait to be free of the stupid ankle monitor. He dressed in dark jeans and a white shirt and his new jacket (which he would probably be wearing for the next week straight. He really liked it.)
Malick's eyebrow cocked.  "I'm of the opinion that, if an omega isn't being happy being an omega, they should be afforded the opportunity to be something better.  Certainly, most are content in their roles. It's in their nature. But for those with aspirations above their station, why not give them a fair chance?  I'm sure, if we told Steve here we could fix him, make him the Alpha he so clearly wants to be, he'd snap at the opportunity."
Speaking of which.
"Yes, after they're bonded.  This is Vixen," he said, gesturing toward an omega who was holding his program and drink for him, standing rigidly, eyes unfocused.  Like a mannequin.
"See, now, that's a smart move," he said.
"I don't scar easily," Steve whispered and watched her work, her movements diligent and efficient.
Steve hesitated, visibly. "I'm not here to discuss what I do in my private life."
Stark?  Howard Stark, the guy in the photo?  The guy who had upset the girl at Baby's and paraded around Captain Rogers?
The young man was unfazed.  "Wow, I just... I can't believe you're here, you're like my hero, I mean, even before Iron Man, but then, when you came back from Afghanistan--"  A muscle in Tony's jaw jumped but his face remained fixed.  "--I was just, completely blown away, like, wow, you know,
"Sir, Miss Potts would like me to remind you--" began JARVIS suddenly.
He paused.
, and good riddance!  The guy is a psychopath!" said Tony.  They were zipping north at over ninety miles an hour, which is the fastest Tony could go while weaving in and out of traffic.  "We should get Pepper to get a restraining order for Steve again Malick, too, that guy is completely fucking-- stop apologizing!"
people," he muttered to Steve.
He felt satisfied with Steve, at least for now.  Steve had a weird way of triggering sudden urges in him.
"We want as much information as possible from the lab itself but we have to prioritize anything on the Winter Soldier and anything on their enhancement work."
Steve almost jumped when both the girls essentially began feeling him up. Maria squeezed his arm and Joan put a hand on his chest. "Oh my! It's
Tony was too far gone to think of whether or not the poured concrete floor was an appropriate place to fuck Steve; it was like their first time all over again, rough and hard and fast and perfect.  Tony was only passingly aware of Steve making sounds, maybe words; the tone was clear; Tony could smell his sweat, his slick, his precum, all of them mixing into a delicious bouquet of sexual delight, and when he felt his knot finally penetrate Steve he nearly came then and there.  Steve was so tight yet so lovingly accepting; his body was hot, a million degrees, squirming under Tony's with unabashed pleasure.  Tony still had a mouthful of skin and his face was buried his Steve's hair, and when he felt Steve's body shudder suddenly, Steve clenching around the base of his cock, he let out a strangled cry and followed Steve, pumping his seed into the omega, riding out his climax with sharp jerks of his hips, the tension slowly leaving his body.
"Seriously though, I don't think anything can be worse than Gideon. I can deal with it," Steve said, leaning against the wall as he took a sip of his drink. Aria immediately grabbed him and made him stand up straight, muttering something about him crinkling his suit.
Stone barked out a laugh.  "Friends? We were never friends.  We sat together at lunch because we didn't have anyone else and when I disappeared I doubt you blinked an eye.  I've kept up with
Both he and Tony had concussions; a throbbing headache had developed behind Steve's eyes and he was desperate for sleep.
Pepper blinked.  "...
is the first one I ever got.  It's just a regular Nidorian. Jason gave it to me."
enough to make up for the weeks of secrecy, the weeks of spying on him and reporting on him.  This was the real Steve, the Steve who didn't want to hide anymore.  As a person who took a lot of pride in having his personal life on display for the public, Tony couldn't have been prouder.
He should have known there would be board members here.  Dan Rabinowitz was one of the senior executives of Stark Industries.
"Yeah... yeah, you do... my sweet omega slut..." moaned Tony, shoving his knot into Steve.  Steve cried out; Tony's eyes were closed, his hands firm on Steve's hips, and he fucked him lovingly, with reckless abandon, every tug on his knot sending electric jolts of pleasure all the way up his abdomen.  "Fuck... oh,
The journey back to the car from the lounge was much the same as their entrance had been. People were yelling; the signs were foul. But this time Steve didn't wear his sunglasses.  He didn't need to.  What fear or trepidation he'd felt walking in had been replaced with righteous indignation, and he was able to brave the crowd with his head held high.  Still, when they were finally back inside the cars there was a collective sigh of relief.
"Can you believe that?" said Natasha.  "...I guess they saved money. Oh, but they put a tracker on Phil, since he's not bonded.  Said they couldn't trust an unbonded omega."
Steve looked up and he could see the shape of a man-- no, a boy-- standing over them. He did the only thing he could think to do. He tried to kick out his ankle.
Gleason frowned in thought. "Right. I'll...get back to you on that. I'll have to have a think. If Mr Stark was to have a real vasectomy that would obviously solve the issue. But it's a little early on for either of you to be making such serious decisions."
The twins exchanged a look.  "...Krauts?"
Badass.  Right.  Another thing on the to-do list: contact IUPAC and get badassium put into the periodic table of elements.  They were going to have to have a long discussion about its symbol, since barium had already laid claim to Ba.
