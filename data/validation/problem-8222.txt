“So..ugh what do you wanna do now? Tony asked as he felt Steve’s hand wrap around his fingers that were busy combing him. Steve hadn’t answered right away as he continued to gaze at Tony. “ i wanna kiss you...” Steve blurted out with the softest expression he could give before his eyes widening in horror at the realization of what he had just said. Tony blinked at him a few times at what he had said. “A kiss? So soon?...well i guess there really isn’t much after holding hands..i never kissed anyone before...so this really could be a big help” Tony thought out loud with a blush as he placed one of his hand over his mouth which made Steve redden as well.
This surpised update after a year, im a bit insecure right now since i haven’t written in a long time..so your thoughts are very important to me
Steve had ram inside Tony as best as he could, cumming inside the demon five times that night as he wanted Tony to know that he could take care of him. When morning came Steve couldn’t help but smile as he woke up with the tiny demon in his arms, skin all glowing and cheeks all red. A perfect sign of a well fed incubus.  Steve himself had never felt so refreshed and alive! Even though him and Tony had done it till the early morning, he woke up with so much energy that he decided he wanted to start running again, Something he hadn’t done in a while. Looks like Tony had done his part in being Steve’s as well. but one look at the sleeping demon below him, and Steve couldn’t help but to reconsider his plan as he gently wrapped his arms around the tiny demon. Loving the way his demon purred and unconsciously cuddled closer. Oh he should really think of something to give Natasha.
———————————————————————-
Everyone cheered as the young teen blew off his candles from the giant six layered cake that was placed in the middle of the massive backyard of his brothers friend’s mansion. It had been a great party that Tony had surprised him with.
————————————————————-
Steve wasn’t like all the others Tony had ever seen before. His species were always more lean and fit, more bulkier and taller compared to him. Yet he was certainly Glad he had found him last night while walking home. The poor guy looked absolutely beat up, tired and hungry.

(See the end of the chapter for
Thank you for your question! Well actually they are perfectly capable of getting jobs and cooking and cleaning.. basically take care of themselves..but the thing is with them..even though they are cat hybrids they are generally very submissive and crave a humans touch and approval. Instinctively wanting to cater and be with their humans rather than live on their own..No one knows where the cat hybrids really came from but they’ve been with humans since the building of the pyramids, Seen next to Pharos in hieroglyphics. It was said that the Cat Hybrids were gifts from Gods to the humans who worshiped them everyday. For some reason the Gods thought humans needed companionship. And at the same time wanted them to feel how the God’s felt with mortal souls. Thus creating a species designed to love and obey their owners as humans do to Gods. The humans eventually made them into pets and cared for them as the Gods care for the humans who worship them.
“Brock dumped him!” Nat answered his questioning look. “What?…that dick!” Bruce gasped as he stared at their singing friend. “Always was…” Nat yelled as a few people started to sing along the drunk blond. “What was the reason? I mean wasn’t he the one who asked Clint out first?” Bruce asked as he tried to ignore Thor climbing on the table and joining the other blond. “Said he found his soulmate…” Nat rolled her eyes as she took another beer.
Tony’s thoughts were interrupted when a knock came through the door. “Doors open” Tony called out. “Heeeyyy Steve...happy birthday!” Bruce greeted as he opened the door. “I got you a little something...” Bruce smiled as he tossed his gift at the giant blond who instinctively caught it. Smiling happily as the other hybrids gaped at it. “It’s a new pair of sneakers..i know how much he loves to run” the smiling vet said as came near Tony who gave him a slice of cake. “Thanks, I’m sure he’ll love it!” Tony smiled as he watch Steve unwrapped the present. Sharon and pepper had given Steve a pair of shirts while Rhodey had bought him a bunch of new video games that he knew the blond liked. While Clint had bought him a small bag of catnip that Steve didn’t seem to appreciate since he didn’t really know what it was. Tony tucked the bag away for safe keeping thinking he’d probably make good use of it someday.
I hope that answered your wonder question! And please feel free to ask more! I am always open to them..gosh you were right XD i seemed to answer more than what i was planning on answering
The blond whispered as he suddenly stopped. Leaving the omega beneath him panting for air before finaly managing to say a word. “Steve..im bonded. To Obadiah Stane! He’s-mmm..” Tony couldn’t even finish his sentence as the alpha had suddenly crush their mouths together in a brutal manner. Tongues clashing in a fierce battle before the blond finally pulled away for air. Blue eyes dark and dangerous as they stared into their prey.
Tony was not okay, his jaw dropped right away when he had caught sight of a tall, well built blond start to walk towards them. Instantly he recognized the omega’s  face as he smiled at him. No, it can’t be..
“So what do we do first?..” Tony asked with a smile as he looked up at Steve who didn’t look back at him as he said “fist lesson today is...Date...we’re going on a date...”
Steve shifted at his side as he felt Tony settle on his side of the bed. Turning around the hybrid saw the brunette hold up a large blue box with a large red ribbon on top if it in front of him. Steve stared at the box for a second before accepting it. Tony bit his lips as he watched Steve untie the red ribbon and opened the top. With a small gasp and wide eyes Steve turned to him with sparkles in his eyes. Inside the box was a bunch of art Supplies that he knew Steve would love. He had often seen the Hybrid sit near the window and start sketching on his own. He’d been absolutely breathless when he saw how wonderfully remarkable Steve’s works were. He had a talent he had told him.
If you’re wondering what the half breed kids looks like...
A servant had knocked for her presence to be known by the two royals. Announcing that the ceremony was about begin. And that the King was waiting for them. The two said their thanks as they headed out to follow the servant girl.
“Nnngg..Steve..”
Tony didn’t hear the last part as the part where Bruce had said that anyone could of spotted Steve, that anyone could of done something with him. The thought alone made him want to vomit as he stared at the tiny awkward hybrid sitting in the chair. Hating how anything could of happened to the small blond. He was snapped out of his thoughts when he heard Bruce repeat his name. “I’m sorry what?” He asked as he snapped his head to look at the vet. “ i said if you want you can leave him here and I could help find him someone to take care of him”
When Steve had pulled away he had a breathless face that seemed to radiate with so much joy that Tony couldn’t help but feel the butterflies in his stomach start to fly inside. Wow, Steve was absolutely handsome. If he hadn’t been so infatuated with Bucky, he would of really fallen head over heals for Steve...he thought with a pout. No, he couldn’t do that, and besides he had to remind himself that Steve was only being with him because of Bucky, and vice versa. Right Bucky...Bucky Barnes...James Bucky Bar-gosh Steve smelled really nice. What is he wearing?
——————————————————————
Somehow it was already lunchtime and Bucky, Steve nor the girls from yesterday had said anything about Tony’s notepad. No one had come up to him and told or even made fun of him with the stupid things he wrote. Maybe they didn’t know it was his after all. Maybe he was safe after all. Thank God, He breathed as he got up from the grass after finishing his lunch.
But he did have Tony..and having Tony was more than enough for him.
Tony moaned in absolute pleasure as Steve jabbed into him with as much force as gravity would let him, bucking his hips faster and harsher into the mewling Prince. Sweat and pre-cum dripping off them as he continued his assault on the brunette's poor hole that had pre-cum already leaking out of it. Tony gasped as Steve pinched his erect nipples, playing with them as he trailed his tongue on the side of Tony's neck below his golden collar.
“Wow...i cant believe it’s already been a year since you found him” Pepper smiled as Tony started to cut the cake. Steve excitedly staring at the slice that was given to him. “I know right!” Tony beamed as he handed the slice to Steve. “I remember that night very well, Steve was like a little sick but adorable kitten back then” Clint teased as he grabbed a plate for Natasha who mewled in gratitude. “Wow..i still cant imagine him so thin..i mean I’ve seen the pictures hang up on your wall with him still small..but just seeing him so big and healthy now..” Sharon mused with a smile as She grabbed two sets of plates  for her two hybrids. Tony beamed brighter at that. He was proud looking at Steve so healthy and happy now. The blond didn’t even flinch anymore when someone tried to touch him. Steve had become more confident and more friendlier to approach since Tony had first met him. Not only had the hybrid’s personality change but also his physical size had tripled dramatically ever since he’d been given food regularly with in between snacks everyday. Tony had made sure to give him all his vitamins and shots he had probably missed since they’d met. From a scrawny sick 5’4 in height to a well built healthy 6’4. It didn’t even seem so real how fast Steve had grown and changed within a year. Bruce had guessed that it wasn’t just the healthy meals and long walks that helped the hybrid get to his full development. It was the love, time and effort Tony had given him that had triggered his hormones to finally burst and start working properly.
He had promised to make Prince Tony his soon...he didn’t expect it would be this soon..he’d have to thank the bitch somehow
This was for the best he reminded himself.
The music had gotten louder making it hard for the brunette to hear the tall blond standing in front of him. “WHAT?!” Tony yelled as he tried to clear out the music in his head. Steve moved even closer yelling something that Tony couldn’t seem to catch. “WHAT WAS THAT?…I CANT HEAR YOU!”
Azure blue eyes had had been his only memory as he winced at the pain he felt in his head. He really hated being left alone for too long, as an omega Tony always craved attention. weather it was from people who claimed to be his fans who sometimes grabbed at him at the streets, from his teammates who would hover over him like the doting beta’s and alpha’s they were. Or simply if it was from his pack Alpha Steve, Captain America who would constantly cuddle him whenever they were together.
“You see Bucky...no one can take better care of my brother than me” Steve said as he glanced at his brother with a soft look before staring back at his best friend. Bucky seemed to want to say something as he began to open his mouth but decided against it. Steve took that opportunity yo finally turned around, pulling a very distressed Tony away with him.
Tony immediately turned around at seeing his brother go near the other brunette. Not wanting to see anything else, he didn’t want to ruin his day this early in the morning. And so like what his older brother had been doing for the last couple of months since the start of the school year, he did his best not to glance at the blond whenever he’d notice Steve and Peggy walking together in the hallways. It was actually pretty easy since Bruce, Rhodney and Pepper were always there to distract him. Once school had ended and Tony was finally alone inside their house with Steve, the blond had immediately showed him how much he had missed him during the day. As if he wasn’t spending most of his time with his friends and Peggy, as if he didn’t notice Tony walking down the corridor just inches from him and still not noticing him. But Tony couldn’t seem to care at all as his older brother was busy giving him all his needed attention from the entire day.
How some nights he’d find Tony letting her into his chambers and not leaving till morning. He hated how she always seemed to catch the young Prince’s attention so easily. And right now she was doing just that, Getting every bit of the prince’s attention.
It was indeed a very successful wedding night.
“Happy anniversary Tony..i love you my omega”
Steve grinned at that, tightening his grip on the trembling dick. "Do you love me enough to bend down for me in front of the whole kingdom?"a small choke escaped the Prince as he sobbed knowing very well Steve already knew the answer to that was still a no.
Clint was already sucking him off while the others started to play with his body. Sam greedily lapping at one of his nipples. While Thor had somehow guided his shakey hands towards his rock hard cock. His brain melting away at every touch and kiss his teammates gave him. Tongues and fingers fighting off the heat driven pain all across his body. And when Loki had carefully thrusted inside of him. Making him see stars. That was when he knew that there was no turning back. They were all going to have him.
“Holy crap! I’m sorry, watch were you aim that thing Steve..”
This will be told in Thor and Loki's point of view for now..since a lot of my Stories haven't had the chance to have these two i wanted to give them a lil intro here
And now that they were finally settled inside Steve’s home. which might he add is absolutely cozy and lovely. Tony couldn’t help the shiver that went through him as Steve began to take off the robe that had been covering his slender body. It was almost funny how shy Steve was earlier when they had met. Now though that Tony was his and inside his home. All the shyness had seemed to wash away as he eagerly drank the omega’s now naked body.
——————————————————-
Steve couldn’t help but feel himself get hard at that. 19 years of being bonded together and having kids and Tony still knew how to make Steve hard as a rock. Or and most especially made his heart flutter. 19 years...and forever was never going to be enough as he captured Tony’s soft lips again.
This had put a small frown on the older teens face as he grudgingly agreed and backed away. Putting both hands in his pocket as he turned around, deciding to leave as to not further embarass the birthday boy. Since he knew he’d have a hard time keeping his hands to himself when around him.
That didn’t seem to lighten the blond’s mood though as he continued to glare dangerously at his best friend before glancing back at his little brother who seemed to flinched at his gaze a bit. Blue eyes instantly sadden at the sight, not liking how Tony was reacting to him. With a sigh Steve stared back at the other brunette as he was finally able to even his breathing. “ Come on Stevie...I’d never do anything to Tony...You know that, i honestly just wanted to take care of him...and then we just kinda kissed...” Bucky tried again, this time Steve just closed his eyes as he began to breath properly.
Tony moaned into his heated kiss with Loki when he felt Steve’s dick twitch inside him, hitting his prostate dead on as the blond thrusted faster into him, pace becoming brutal and erratic as he moaned Tony’s name repeatedly. Words of praises escaping his lips as he told Tony how beautiful he was, how much he loved him and only did all those things because he loves him. His words were too much that the brunette immediately broke away from the sloppy kiss he shared with Loki, glancing back instead at his blushing King Who’s eyes were burning holes into him. With his lust filled eyes Tony leaned into his king’s face as he begged for a kiss. Licking and nipping the blonds closed lips, wishing for entrance into them. With a low groan Steve obliged as he opened his lips, letting the pink appendage in to ravish the inside of his mouth. The king grinned when he felt Tony’s hole start to clenched tight around him, indicating that the Brunette was already coming. With a harsh thrust Steve spread Tony’s ass cheeks wider as he hit Tony’s prostate brutally, making the brunette part his lips from his with a loud cry of ecstasy as he shuttered in the hydra’s arms. His cum spilling all Steve who moaned at feeling Tony clench around him even tighter. Making him thrust in brutally a few more times before cumming inside the fucked out brunette. A few of his cum pouring out of Tony’s abused hole.
On the first day of Summer Steve and Tony had rented a cozy cottage with two rooms in the middle of the woods for a week with their friends. The two wanting to spend as much time together before Steve goes to boot camp. Clint a beta had teased the two numerous times that they should just get on with it whole they were all away from their overbearing parents. the blond beta would always get a smack from Natasha, a red head Alpha who just like Tony wasn’t a knot-head like all the other Alpha’s in school. Bruce and Thor would then teased the beta and alpha of how perfect they would be together. Making the two very uncomfortable. Steve thought it was cute since Nat for some reason also shared Tony’s shyness when it came to Clint. That was one of the reasons Steve loved being around the redhead alpha. She didn’t feel she had the right to claim or belittle anyone just because she was an alpha.
———————————————————-
“WAIT!” Steve screamed as he tried to pry the door open, immediately sliding his left leg on the doors open space. Tony was shaking a bit as he let the blond open the door. Not use to how rough the other’s voice was at the moment. The blond was still staring at him when he had successfully pried the door wide open. “ why didn’t you go to the science lab like i asked?” the shorter teen had immediately frozen at hearing those words. “I...i-you..you wrote that?” Brown eyes wide with shock. Without an answer Steve had let himself in, closing the door behind him as he lifted the small notepad out of his pocket. Making the brunette swallow hard as he slowly backed away from the intruding blond. “Yeah...and i was so upset when i saw you running away from school when you passed me by the hallway..thought you were braver than that..” steve huffed as he cornered the shorter teen against a wall.
You know what? I’ll edit this later if i see any mistakes..i just feel like i owe you guys this chapter...again so sorry for the wait
“To friends!” Thor cheered as he raised his beer. “To friends!” Everyone laughed as they tossed their bottles into the air. “But seriously Steve. You and Tony here? Should really start distancing yourselves from each other a bit…” Clint started as he took a sip of his beer. Tony gasped at that as he clung to Steve’s side. Face all hurt. “I’m serious!” Clint laughed as Nat finally sat down after finishing her song. “He’s right though” the redhead stated as she stared seriously at the two across the table. “What? Nat, you too?…” Steve smiled as he wrapped an arm around the frowning brunette and brought him closer. “Oh God! No joke! Look at you two! How are your soulmates going to react to that?” Clint laughed as he pointed at the two. Bruce shook his head at that as he smirked. Thor humming in agreement beside him.
When the pancakes and eggs were served Steve had leaned very close to the brunette and offered him more of his pancakes. Tony being a man who could never resist anything his hybrid had to offer immediately leaned closer as well before opening his mouth and taking in the delicious treat. Moaning as his eyes sparkled from the taste. “I swear Steve I don’t know what I would ever do without you!” Tony said in between bites as he stabbed a fork on his pancakes. Steve beaming at his owners praise, glancing ever so slowly at the other hybrid who was busy stuffing himself as well. “Yes! He certainly is a good cook! My master would love your cooking too! Thank you for this wonderful breakfast Steve” Thor smiled as he gobbled his sunny side up. Steve smiled wearily at that, not expecting Thor to say that to him. Maybe Thor wasn’t so bad after all-. “Dearest Tony..i see you love the pancakes so much...as a thank you i shall give mine to you..” Thor offered as he got up and gave his pancake to the engineer. Tony smiling brilliantly at getting more of the delicious breakfast. “You know i cant say no to that...and you know what Thor? your really something aren’t you...you even have this funny way of talking..tell me, are you a royal blooded hybrid? You look like one but i wasn’t really sure at first...” Tony asked with fascination. “Indeed i am..i was bought by my Master for twelve hundred thousand dollars from my parents owners..” Thor boasted. “Oh my god! Your owner must be very wealthy to have that much money to buy a hybrid...god! And a royal blooded one!” Tony gawked as he didn’t even notice Steve stabbing him with a fork anymore. The engineer and the ‘royal hybrid now busily talking about his background’ a vain had popped on Steve’s forehead as he watched Tony get so thrilled at hearing more about Thor. Okay...he takes it back Thor was BAD!  BAD! BAD NEWS! with a pout Steve stood up and left the table as his tail swished irritably behind him as he listened to the two talk.
The flinch didn’t go unnoticed as the omega frown at him. Tony redden at the realization as he didn’t want Steve to think he was actually scared of him. It was just that he was so unused to seeing Steve so strong that he’d instinctively flinch when Steve had just finished punching another alpha in front of him.
Tony was actually considering it! He had actually planned for them to do a kiss after a few dates, perhaps on the 6th or 7th but seeing the brunette’s face so close to his had made him blurt out what he really had been thinking of what he wanted to do at the moment. He was about to take it back when he realized Tony was actually okay with it. “So...how do we do it?” Tony asked as he tilted his head to the side, giving Steve a bit of a nice view of his collarbone. Steve stared at the exposed skin for a second before snapping his full attention back at Tony who was waiting with a cute pout. “I ugh...well we...lean next to each other and press our lips together..” Steve managed as he felt himself shake nervously. He had never really kissed someone before, he had a lot of girls and even guys try to kiss him on the lips, but it always ended with them either kissing his chin or his neck since he would always get too nervous at their forwardness and start avoiding their advances.
“Mom! Morgan’s putting her broccoli’s in my plate again!” Tony’s first born whined as he tried to put the vegetables back on his sister’s plate. Tony turned around to give his daughter a stern look “Honey...you know better than to not eat your veggies” Tony warned before turning back to finish his stirring. The tiny half breed brunette scratched her chubby cheeks a bit as she moaned how she already ate one. Harley Quickly pulling out his tongue to make a face at her.
He couldn’t help the smile curving his face whenever he remembered how the blond had taught him to kiss and hold hands last Saturday. Even though they were suppose to be just lessons..they actually felt so real. The way Steve would lean into his face and not let go until they needed air, the way the blond’s adorable baby blue eyes would stare at him like he was actually inlove with Tony. all those did wonders to the tiny nerds heart. He couldn’t even believe that he use to think of Steve as scary when in fact the big jock was actually just an adorable puppy who liked to help others like Tony and Bucky out.
Yes, there was absolutely nothing to be nervous about as long as they were together.
——————————————————
Steve Rogers, the tall, bulky and most popular guy in school was huffing with sweat as he stared at him with that strange look again that always seemed to make Tony squirm. He did not like this, he did not like this...what was the star quarter back doing in the middle of his door step, in front of his house. “Ca-can i help you?” Tony asked as he blinked up at the blond. Steve seemed to be thinking about something as his eyes seemed to be unfocused. Only snapping out of his thoughts when Tony had tried closing the door on his face. Out of pure reflex as he didn’t know what to do with the scary way Steve had been staring at him.
Tony nodded as he bit his lips. Hands gripping on strong shoulders as he felt Steve’s hard on grind against his. “Come on baby…you know all i want in return for everything is your ass on my dick…” Steve breathed as he bit on a collar bone. Making Tony gasp in surprise.
Now however that he was finally alone with the other Steve, Tony couldn’t help but flush as he smelled the Alpha’s scent. His arousal filling the air immediately, making the commander’s nostrils flair. The omega whimpered a bit as he cautiously leaned against the blond standing beside him on the bed.
Tony was absolutely grateful that Steve had let Nat and Bucky visit them when Tony’s labour would just be around the corner. being this late in his pregnancy he and Steve couldn’t afford to roam around outside their cottage when there were many dark creatures lurking around the woods surrounding them. A pregnant omega always had a strong and delicious smell that did things to the creatures living in the dark forest. So Tony had to stay indoors at all cost. Maybe once their child was a year old they could finally come out again as Steve would be there by their side incase any creature would try to come near them. Omega human’s and their children were safe to go out as long as their Hydra’s were by their side. Since the other creatures knew how territorial and protective Hydra’s were with their mates.
(See the end of the chapter for
But not the one Tony really needed. Steve thought as he took a sip from his orange juice. No, Tony needed someone who had his back. Weather it was here in their personal life. Or at the battlefield. He needed someone who could cary him when he needed to be carried. He needed someone stronger and had more experiences with the world around them. He needed someone like…Steve.
the omega whimper in his arms before, tears trailing down his cheeks as he clung desperately at Steve’s sides.finally relaxing as Steve released a lot of his pheromones. making Tony finally feeling all his pint up exhaustion from the days before. when the kiss had ended all Tony could do was close his eyes as Steve cradled his head on his chest, just like he use to when they were younger. Steve pressed Tony’s head against his chest a bit more, letting the omega smell his pheromones more. A smile formed on his face when Tony had finally fell asleep.
Tony breathed as he tried to squirm away but was held tighter by Steve’s large hand.
The two heads snapped up as he continued to stare down at them. “ tonight you will bow down to me in front of the entire kingdom to see..and lady Pepper the best view” Steve finished with a predatory smile before yanking Tony harshly off of the red head. “Now..” he trailed as he squeezed the brunette tight against him. “Take her away” he snapped for his guards to drag a red eyed pepper away. “Who knows...maybe one day I’ll have good use of her” he said with a lethal grin.
As he walked to his locker he thought of a couple of things he’d like to buy later after school. Not noticing the small note that was placed in front of his locker right away. When he did noticed it though, his eyes widen as he read what was written on the small piece
Was all he could really think about as he nuzzled closer to the blond’s chest. He had questions but they could wait. Right now all he needed was his omega as he buried himself in his arms.
I hope you guys liked this chap...please tell me what you think with their situation, I’d love to hear
He quickly went out as he closed the bedroom door and stood behind it. Just maybe he could get to do that with Tony once he got back. He would really like to, he would really love too..And if he knew Tony would love it too. With a wide smile Steve was forming a plan.
Strolling into bed and flopping tiredly in it he took out his phone again and opened his gallery. Pictures of Steve appeared in the small screen as he brows through a hundred of them, stopping when he saw the one where Steve was still a small skinny thing sitting at the park with a scowl on his face while looking at the distance, Tony smiled looking at it. Steve barely smiled back then, barely made a sound too. It was common for hybrids to stay silent and simply observe when in the presence with humans they didn’t know well enough. Pet hybrids usually only liked to talk with their owners or other hybrids they were comfortable with. So Tony didn’t really mind when Steve use to stay quiet around him back then. Because what Steve lacked in words, he made up for in affection . The tiny blond would always cling to him even back then, especially in the mornings after waking up. Always cuddling and nuzzling his nose on Tony’s chest which made Tony’s morning unbelievably wonderful and at the same time a nightmare. Always doing his best to maneuver his hard on away from the clingy blond was a challenge every waking morning. Afraid in scaring the poor guy, that got harder overtime when Steve had gotten bigger though. Forcing Tony to sleep facing the nightstand and away from the hybrid, so Steve wouldn’t feel his little jr down there rise up. The problem with the new position was that Steve was always spooning him now. Which made everything a hundred times harder for the brunette.
Before he could bang his head on the bleachers however, steve had arrived with his usual goofy smile. “Sorry..did you wait long?” Steve asked as he sat next to the brunette. “Oh...ugh..no not really...sorry i kinda spaced out...is practice done?” Tony asked with a blush as he tried not to think too much anymore. The rest of the football team were already heading for the showers. Leaving only The two on the bleachers as Tony started wiping off the sweat off the others face. “Thanks..” Steve breathed as he tried to lean in for a kiss, Tony had instantly lean away from him. Making the tall blond frown a bit. “Oh ugh..s-sorry...it’s just that um...your sweaty...don’t wanna get all dirty..” Tony lied as he wrinkled his nose adorably making the jock laugh as he nodded his head. “Just let me shower first and then maybe we could get something to eat? Im actually really hungry from all that workout..” Steve said as he got up when Bucky had called him. Tony nodded at him as he watched the jock run towards his friend.
After that incident the two hadn’t had anymore further physical contact than touching and kissing inside any of their houses. Their parents had made it their sole purpose to interfere with the two teenagers as much as they could. Steve eventually easing down on his advances as most of the omega’s had gotten the hint that he wasn’t backing down for no one. Only a few brave souls would try and flirt with the alpha by the end of the school year. Not caring if they’d get a broken nose from the tiny blond. It also helped that Steve actually gained a bit of meat in him, it wasn’t much but at least he wasn’t as thin as when he and Tony met. On the last day of school though Steve had to remind a few omega’s again that Tony was his when he had spotted them smothering the Alpha with hugs and letters ( that Steve immediately threw away ) The said omega’s threw him the old stink eye as he stomped his way between them and his flustered alpha. Giving them hard looks before going soft when he turned to his alpha who was already clutching at his side. The poor rejected omega’s crying in the hallway when Steve had left victorious once more.

And so that’s what he did. After school had ended the brunette had immediately dashed towards his house. Slamming the door shut as he panted for breath. He was safe now, and he’d didn’t need to worry anymore because he was never going back ever again.
“Oh my God Steve! It’s just you...” Peggy breathed with relief as she climbed off someone else’s lap. Tony’s brown eyes widen even more when he realized it was Daniel Sousa who Peggy had just been straddling, the school principal’s son who had just recently graduated high school last year. Tony furrowed his brows at the sight of the two together inside the car. What was Peggy doing on Daniel’s lap? Wasn’t she together with Steve? His thoughts were cut off when he heard his older brother start to talk.
“Oh! No…absolutely not…well, i just thought i’d bring you some pizza since you’ve been working so hard..” Pepper said as she offered the box infront of the two men. “It’s okay…Steve brought me coffee and donuts…” the brunette gestured to his desk. “And thanks to his magical fingers im all up and ready to finish up in here. Just give me an hour and i will be all done!” Tony smiled as he started to botton up his shirt back.

..................................................................
Steve felt his heart stop as he stiffened behind Tony. Startled at the brunette suddenly saying his name. “T-Tony?...” Steve stuttered as he leaned in glanced down to take a look at the other. Tony turned his head a bit but was still asleep. Cheeks flushed as he parted his lips. “  Steve...” Tony moaned again as he snuggled closer to the blond. His bulge now pressed against Steve’s erection. Blue eyes turning wide, Was Tony moaning out his name in his sleep? Was he dreaming of Steve while Steve was literally grinding against him? Another moan escaped the brunette as he unconsciously grinded his bulged against Steve’s, holy Shit he was! The sudden realization sent a thrill though out the hybrid’s entire body, tail swirling excitedly from behind as he felt his heart beat rapidly. Tony was dreaming of him. Tony wanted this. Wanted this as much as he did! So he was right in thinking Tony would want them both to do what Nat and Clint had done. Oh thank the Gods! They would finally do it! Well...Steve didn’t really know how they would do it since Tony didn’t seem to have that other hole he saw on Nat. But he was sure they would figure it out. And it wasn’t like they couldn’t feel satisfaction from pressing their erections together. He was sure they’d both love that. Steve bit his lips as he tried to slide the brunette’s pajama down, wanting to see the man’s erection and press it against his.
“Steve? It’s the middle of the night…what are you doing here?…” Tony asked as he tried to get up and greet his surprise guess. But Steve was fast. Hand right away placing the box of donuts infront of the alpha, while the other hand handed him the freshly brewed coffee. Giving the omega enough time to push the alpha back down on his chair. Fingers gently gripping the sides of each shoulder before slowly working their magic.
Tony really didn’t think he liked Sharon, or any of her friends. They kinda looked stuck up and snobbish, and right now he wasn’t liking how she was leaning too closely to Steve. Even though Tony had to admit they did look like a pretty good couple. In fact everyone in the table looked absolutely good for Steve, he was the only who looked so out of place. Maybe he should just go and leave Steve with the other popular students. This really wasn’t his scene. And he didn’t really think he was getting any lesson today. But before he could tell Steve that he had to leave, Daniel had arrived with their fries and drinks. Sharon instantly taking Steve’s coke when he was about to get it. “Oh my gosh thank you...i am so thirsty..it’s okay that we share this right?” Sharon asked as she blinked up at Steve a few times. Tony frown a bit at that, not liking how rude Sharon was being. Steve didn’t seem to mind however as he simply smiled at the other blond. “It’s alright...me and Tony can share his drink instead..you can have that one..” Sharon’s bright smile had turned instantly into an angry frown at that as she unconsciously gripped the coke a little too hard. Screaming when the drink had splattered all over her and Steve’s shirt. “Oh crap!” Steve cursed as he got up. Tony by his side immediately as he took some tissues to try and clean the jock. Sharon standing up as well as she ran towards the girls room all soaking wet from the drink. pissed off that Steve didn’t even check on her as he was too busy worrying about the stupid nerd. a few of her girls hurriedly followed her as she slammed the door. “God...Sharon really needs to be more careful...” Steve said with a frown as he got some tissues as well. “Sorry girls we gotta go...dont wanna ruin this shirt..you okay Tony?...” he asked as he grabbed their fries, grinning when Tony had nodded at him. “You didn’t get wet now did you?” Steve asked some more as he placed both hands on Tony’s side. The small brunette had smiled as he tried to reassure Steve that he was fine. When the blond was sure that Tony was alright he gently placed his hand on Tony’s arm as he started to head out the door. The small brunette only had enough time to place a fifty dollar bill on the table before being pulled by The giant jock.
But the alpha ignored it. Instead deciding to settle back next to the distressed omega. Heart thumping loudly as Steve had suddenly placed his head agaisnt the alpha’s lap. And before Tony knew it, he had finally relaxed once again. Hands playing with Steve’s locks as he wanted the omega to be the one being pampered this time around.
————————————————————————
And Tony was weak, he was too weak to even try and resist his brother. Because deep down in his heart he knew he really wanted this. No matter how wrong it was. He wanted Steve just as bad as Steve wanted him. With trembling hands he clung on to the blond even more as he leaned into the kiss with his tip toes. Loving every bit of it as he finally was able to welcome the blond’s words into his heart. Because for some unknown reason, kissing Steve never felt so right. It was nothing at all like kissing Bucky, his heart didn’t beat as fast as it did now..his mind didn’t fog up at the sweet sensations he was feeling at the moment, and his body didn’t melt at the mere touches of Steve’s hands. And before he knew it Steve had already picked him up by the waist, making him yelp a bit as he tried to straddle his legs around the bigger teens waist. A moan escaping his lips again when Steve had started to kiss and suck at his neck.
“You know..I haven’t given you my birthday gift yet..” Tony tried.
Once she had left the two boys alone in the room again. Steve could only smile in embarrassement, unsure of what had just happened between them. “So…ugh yeah…lessons over for the day…ahem…i see you’ve improved on how to kiss…” Steve drooled. Tony beamed at the praise. “Well, i did learn from the best…” he chuckled before the two fell silent again. “So…um…wanna help out ma downstairs? Bet she’s waiting on us” Steve smiled, making the other nod as he went out to go downstairs. Steve following after but not before straighting his pants first.
Finally! THURSDAY!
Speaking of which…
Hope you guys forgive me for the long wait.. there's more to come from these two and poor Pepper..hope to hear your thoughts on what's happening
“Clint!” Nat whimpered as she gripped on the bed sheets, her ass high up in the air with her tail twirling around impatiently for her owner. “I’m here! I’m here Nat...sorry..” Clint rushed to her side kneeling beside her on the bed whispering soft praises. Steve had seen them before during Nat’s heat the first time when he couldn’t do anything. But the scene and smell were always overwhelming. He swallowed hard as he watched Clint gently push a finger in her. How he whispered soft praises while placing kisses around the back of her neck before biting her harsh. Making Nat tremble and moan in pleasure. He wondered if He and Tony could have that. Could experience what Clint and Nat were experiencing. It looked so much more intimate than simply hugging or licking. But it seemed a bit far fetch as Tony never went into heat as a human. And as a male Hybrid as well he didn’t have heats like females did..a male hybrid would only be triggered sexually when smelling a females arousal. Which for some reason he never got from Natasha. But Tony always got aroused he thought. Maybe..if he could just corner the brunette maybe he could- “Ohhhh Clinnnttt ahhhh” Natasha’s loud moan cut him off his thoughts as he realized he was still standing there stupidly watching Clint tend to his needy hybrid.
“Wow...there sure are a lot of people here..” Tony said as he pressed closer to Bucky who had his arms wrapped around him while looking around. “Yeah...these are senior party’s doll...get real wild sometimes..can’t blame Steve why he never brought you with us..” he smirked as he glanced down at Tony who grinned at him. He and Bucky had only met a few hours ago at a diner for dinner because Tony didn’t want to be alone when a few seniors had noticed them and invited them to join them in going to a party. Bucky had been hesitant as he wanted to bring Tony home early and safe, but the brunette had smiled at the opportunity to go to a senior party, since Steve never let him. And since the blond wasn’t going to be home till probably later than nine. He begged the older brunette to take him, it took a lot of persuasion till Bucky finally said yes.
Blushing widely Tony obeyed as he stuck up his ass a bit, shivering as two strong arms started spreading his cheeks wide apart. Gasping when he felt a oil coated finger start to press inside of him. “Ahh..Steve..” Tony moaned as he tried closing his eyes but opened them wide again when Steve had ordered him to look at him. “Look at me when i take you Tony...my love..” The king breathed as he captured soft lips, kissing Tony intensely as he thrusted his finger in and out of the brunette before adding a second one. Loki and Thor not far behind as Thor had began scissoring Loki’s ass. Stretching him wide before inserting a third one making the dark haired prince squirm and moan with delight. Cock rubbing deliciously against his abs as he continued to finger fuck him. Both getting started a bit as Tony let out a loud moan as he impaled himself onto Steve’s enormous dick. “Fuck...that’s it my sweet..ride me..” Steve groaned as he watched intently how Tony rode him. Water splashing around them as Tony moaned wantonly, mind clouded with lust as Steve started to play with his neglected erection while sucking harshly on his shoulder. Completely forgetting that there were two other royals beside them watching with lust filled eyes as they too started playing with each other.
Opening the door Clint stared in wonder as he saw his neighbor across the hall rummaging through his pockets, probably looking for his Keys. It wasn't unusual for the man to come home this late at night. What was unusual was that there was a very unhealthy looking blond cat hybrid standing behind him. The tiny blonds ears twitched in his direction. Clint stiffen when the small blond turned to him with a venomous hiss, startling his neighbor who turned to face him as well. "Hey Tony..." he greeted as he gave a weary smile before glancing back at the brunette's companion who looked like he was ready to pounce on him any minute. "Hey, No! No! his a friend...his nice...hey Clint..uh..this is Steve..." Tony said as he tried to sooth the alarmed Blond who's tail looked like it had been struck by lightning. "It's okay...i wont hurt you.." Clint reassured the small blond as well as he held his hands up to show he wasn't a threat. Sensing Clint's discomfort Natasha made herself known as she walked pass her owner and went straight towards the tiny fuming blond. "Nat...be careful..." Clint cautioned even though he knew very well that Nat was very capable of defending herself.
“STEVE!”
With a cough he got the brunette’s attention again. Face positively serious as he didn’t want to give off anything to the other in front of him. “So...you like vanilla ice cream...” Steve commented as he remembered what Tony had ordered. The younger teen immediately smiled at that with a soft nod. “Yeah...especially when drenched with salted butter caramel..” he said with a goofy grin that made Steve’s heart soar. “ um...anything else? Nuts...sprinkles?” Steve drawled as he started writing on his notebook. “Um...no..but i guess those are good too...i mean who doesn’t like sprinkles?” Tony had grinned as he watched Steve scribble on his notebook. “And you like cheese burger...right?” He questioned as he remembered the brunette’s order again. “It’s my favorite actually...really fast and easy to get and eat...” Tony answered as he glanced down at The blond scribbling away again.
So NO..he couldn’t afford to wait that long to be claimed by Tony. Not when every freaking omega they meet wants to get their hands on the adorable alpha. and what really pissed him was that he wasn’t as capable of defending his Alpha from those omega’s. Not with his weak and pathetic excuse of a body anyways. Call him insecure because he really was..but every time he’d get a glimpse of another more healthier omega coming near Tony, he’d have this sinking feeling that they’d actually have the chance to snatch Tony from him. That’s why he had made it his mission to get his sick body in order. he had already asked his mother for help on that, the omega mother supporting him enthusiastically.
“Thats Tony, and your right...I can’t really keep two. One of them might starve if i cant feed them both enough...clearly it’s gonna be this big guy since he’s so protective of his lil brother..” Natasha trailed as she gave the incubus sitting by her side a gentle pet. “That’s why i called you here...I’m giving Tony to you!” She then turned with a wide smile. Making Steve’s eyes widen. “W-what?!! you’re giving him to me? W-why? I don’-“ Steve stuttered as he wasn’t sure he would be able to take care of a demon. The red head rolled her eyes at him before giving him a look. “Look Steve...you’re over worked. You have no fun. And your a total kill joy to be around when you don’t get laid which is always..you need him, Tony could really help you out!” the blond couldn’t help but scowl and blush at his friends words. Mouth opening and closing as he didn’t know if he should defend himself or admit that he was all those things.
Tony was free now..free from the hurt of his own father, free from the pain that he suffered from his own people, free to be his...and he would keep it that way..and he swore no one would free Tony from him.
The gang all laughed as the brunette cried out for his science bro to help him out as he tried to escape Steve’s clutches.
‘Knock’
Stupid Alpha’s...they really needed their brains check if they thought that Steve would ever chose them and their stuck up self centered egos over his sweet and gentle Tony. Speaking of Tony...Steve‘s face drew tighter when he realized that the stupid alpha’s interference had given another omega a chance to go and flirt with his innocent alpha, who as always was oblivious to the omega’s advances. God he hated how everything had been going with him and Tony since he got back. Thanks to his new new physical appearance all types of alpha’s were trying to get it on with him leaving him a bit occupied to chase them away. In those tiny moments Steve noticed the omega’s that had been waiting for their chance to be with Tony had grabbed those moments as their opportunity to get his alpha’s attention for a little bit. It was frustrating to say the least. Steve had to guard his precious alpha even more now. With an irritated look Steve marched right on up behind Tony who was facing the annoying omega. the omega’s face instantly fell the moment she saw Steve glaring death daggers at her. His muscles flexing as he stood on his full height, looking absolutely intimidating.
Little did he know that a certain bulky blond had already entered the diner they were eating in. blue eyes scanning the place before spotting him. With a wide smile forming on his face the omega started to move towards them.
———————————————————
the small ceremonial bond had ended with Steve biting the small omega’s gland bond. Releasing as much of his venom and scent into the small omaga’s body as best as he could. Making Tony whimper and release his now bounded mate’s scent around him. Protecting him from other alpha’s of all types and low level creatures that wouldn’t think twice of killing or playing with him in the black forest if he didn’t have Steve’s scent. After Steve was pleased with his newly bonded omega’s scent. He then bowed down on the temple floor as he finally unbounded himself from the village grounds. The mark on his chest finally disappearing as he finally stood up to his full height from the holy grounds, Towering over his human mate and the two village elders who’s heads only reached his chest. His time here was done and there was nothing left for him to do than take his prized omega and go back into the dark forest.
“Why are there two demons watching TV inside your house?” Steve asked as he sat down on the sofa. Eyes never leaving the two horned brunettes leisurely sitting on the floor. long tails circling around each other as they continued to watch the commercial that was being shown on the flat screen. Completely ignoring the intruder as if knowing that Steve was no threat to their owner. “Oh...i bought them off a demon auction, you know I’ve always wanted a demon but just never had the time to go find one...and look! finally i did!...” the redhead grinned as she sat down the sofa next to him. Steve cock an eye at that. “Yeah...two...why would you think getting two demons would be okay? You can’t even fully take care of yourself. Let alone two demons?” Natasha rolled her eyes at that as she snapped her hands to get their attentions. The two brunettes instantly turned their heads at their owner. Making Steve widen his eyes.
"You like that sweety?" Steve asked as he bucked his hips up once more into the trembling brunette.
“I asked where you were since you weren’t at your lab…JARVIS told me you were at your office so i thought i’d bring you some snacks to help you with your work..i know how preoccupied you get and lose track of time…” the omega trailed as he continued to stroke his fingers on the other’s shoulders. “Did you forget to eat again?” Steve asked with a sad tone this time. A tone that would usually make Alpha’s want to dominate them.
His heart pounded wildly inside his ribcage at the mere memory of their encounters. Hazel brown eyes never leaving his mind as he continued to watch the omega trying to get move. With a smile forming in his face, he ordered one of his guards to open the door as he couldn’t wait anymore to say hello to the omega.
His hands curled into fist at the thought of that, shouting louder as he stomped across the woods. No, Tony was happy with him. The omega had made it clear to Steve that he was happy with him. No! Tony didn’t..wouldn’t leave him...

Inspired from the song “i try” by Macy Gray
“Umm...what are you writing?” Tony couldn’t help but asked as he leaned forward a bit to get a good look at what Steve was writing. The blond instantly jolted at that as he held the notebook tight against his chest. “Ugh...notes...” he blurted with a light blush before realizing what he looked like and acted all calm again. Tony wrinkled his nose at that which made Steve wanna smile goofily at him. “Notes of what?” He asked as he tilted his head to the side, curious of what Steve is really planning. “Um...the things you like..” Steve embarrassingly admitted as he placed the notebook back on the table. “Oh....well, why do you need to write down what i like?” Tony pressed as he tried to take the notebook only for Steve to grab at it and stuff it in his bag again. “Well...if I’m going to be teaching you lessons like dates...i should at least know what you like...it would only be right...this would be also good for Bucky when you two finally have a real date...” Steve answered quickly as he glanced around the place, not really looking at Tony who was staring at him with awe. “Wow...your so considerate, thank you Steve..” if Steve were an anime character right now he would of had a nosebleed from how cute the brunette had said that to him. “Yeah...it’s nothing really, i just need to ask you a couple of important questions and all you have to do is answer them alright?” Steve managed to say with a straight face as he stared seriously at Tony who nodded with a serious face as well. God Steve wanted to pinch his cheeks. The blond coughed a bit before he asked his third question. “So...what’s your favorite color?”
By Sunday Pepper’s uncle had arrived at their doorstep asking for the young teen to come home. With a frown Pepper had gave Tony a hug and a kiss before grudgingly going inside his uncles car, Tony frowned as he watched his friend go before closing the door and startling when he realized Steve had been standing there behind him. “You okay Tony?” The blond teen asked as he placed an arm around the shorter one. Tony just nodded as Steve guided them to the kitchen, it was already dinner time and Steve had finished making some spaghetti.
I hope to hear how this whole story had made you guys feel because this was just warm and butterfly hugs for me 😊❤️
“Hi! I’m Steve! Are you Tony? My dad has told me all about you!” the blond boy asked as he held the blushing brunette tight. Tony could only nod as he tried and failed to open his mouth at the very touchy omega. The grin on Steve’s face widen as he glanced back at his father. “His really cute..I really like him...” he said before turning back around to smile widely at Tony who blushed even more at his bluntness. “I...ah...thank you...” was all he could say before he yelped in surprise when Steve had started running into the garden, pulling him along as he waved at his father who was laughing with the older Rogers.
Coming back to this morning Tony cursed as Steve woke up startled and alert at hearing A loud beeping. “It’s okay, its okay..it’s just my alarm clock...I’m sorry” Tony tried to calm him as he stared at the brunette who got up to turn off the loud annoying beeping. “ wanna get breakfast? I make a mean omelette” Tony offered with a charming smile as he helped the hybrid off the bed. Steve just simply tilted his head as he didn’t seem to understand what Tony was talking about. Tony made a gesturing movement with his hand and mouth. Steve’s face light up as he realized the other was offering him food again. Tony swore he’d get a nose bleed at the adorable sight.
I’m awful :(
I wasn’t sure if i was gonna continue this story but since ditasitepu35 asked so nicely here it is! i hope you like it 😊
The younger sibling had been so worried that his brother had been doing something iligal that he wouldn’t stop asking where the 23 year old had gotten all of the money from. Only to find out that Steve had been helping them from the goodness of his own heart. “I’ve got money to burn, so there’s no need to worry on repaying me. Your safety and Tony’s friendship is enough for me…” the handsome business man had said when he couldn’t understand why he was doing all this.
———————————————————-
“You like him?..” Steve asked as he glanced at the brunette who blinked a few times before glancing back at him with startled eyes. Not expecting him to say ask. “I...i do...he’s nice..he gave me this..” he gestured to the diamond necklace hanging around his neck. Steve narrowed his eyes at the necklace before glancing back at him. “That really doesn’t suit you though..” he wrinkled his nose with a cute smile making Tony laugh and slap him. “Shut up..” he smiled before yelping a bit when Steve had suddenly rolled on top of him. “I’m serious...he really doesn’t know you that well if he gives you a fancy thing like that...that wouldn’t really make you happy..” he said as he nudged his nose against the omega’s. Tony could feel his breath on him, swallowing a bit as he tried to talk without shaking. “It’s for our wedding tomorrow...something new..” he managed to say as he felt Steve’s azure eyes pierce through him. “Oh yeah?...well how bout this...” Steve said as he sat up a bit, taking his old dog tag off his neck from when he trained in the military. Hanging it in front of Tony before placing it around the omega’s neck. Startling The brunette a bit.
‘Mate, Mate, Mate...’ his brain kept telling him as he unconsciously leaned closer to the blond who finally settled besides him, Purring when large hands had started touching him gently. “So beautiful...” the commander had whispered, making Tony shiver at how familiar his voice sounded.
As she stumbled forward, Steve rose to his feet. Knuckles cracking as he was ready to crush her windpipes. But as he was about to grab the skinny woman’s neck Tony had ran to cover Her with his body. The king’s jaw clenched as he ordered the prince to get out of the way.
He was pathetic. He really shouldn’t be wasting his time waiting for his brother who was probably out getting a girlfriend right now. The thought instantly left a huge ache in his chest. Which confused the teen, he really didn’t know why it hurt to even think of Steve kissing someone else, let alone asking them to be his girlfriend. Steve was his brother and their kisses were of brotherly love, or at least that’s what he tried to tell himself.
But before he could successfully pull it all the way down a loud crash outside their bedroom door had startled the brunette awake , brown eyes filled with panic as he scurried out of bed. Steve covering his erection and willing it away as he jumped off behind him. Curious as to what had caused the loud noise this early in the morning.
After a few games and a few more chats the party had ended and everyone had finally went home. Tony had collapsed on the sofa as he felt absolutely tired now. Steve quick to jump on the tiny sofa and settle himself on top of Tony’s lower half. Purring happily as Tony’s hand traveled to his furry ear and played with it. “ did you enjoy the party Stevie? I hope you did” Tony said with a tired smile. Steve nodded his head as he closed his eyes to the brunettes smooth touch. Tony carefully grabbed the remote on the coffee table before clicking on it and a black and white movie had appeared. Steve nestled his head on Tonys waist as the two of them pleasantly watched the movie together. The man in the television was saying something about how he wanted nothing better to do than love the woman for the rest of his life. The woman beamed and kissed him breathlessly, Steve glanced at that at Tony who was now rubbing his eyes as he felt himself start to doze off a bit. “Lets say we hit the sack huh Steve?” Tony ask as he reached for the remote again to turn the T.V off. Yelping when he'd realized how close Steve’s face was all of a sudden. Tony raised an eyebrow as he felt the
The smooth voice had stilled the stunned omega as he stopped his movements to carefully glance behind him. Familiar blue orbs stared intensely at him with a familiar charming smile. Tony couldn’t help but swallow as he realized who had just entered.
Raging with jealousy, he barked for her to step forward. He didn’t know how she had managed to escape but he was certainly grateful she was here now. Now he could kill her himself and finally have the Prince’s attention on him.
For a few short seconds everything was silent as they both started to eat their dinner before Tony finally looked up to stare at Steve who immediately noticed and stared back at him. Tony blinked a few times before having the courage to ask his brother the dreaded question that had been in his mind for weeks now. “Do you love someone...i mean like right now?” The words stumbled out of his lips as he felt himself tremble a bit, Anxious to find out the answer. Steve stared at him for a long period of time, face stoic as possible. Emotions masked as he looked at Tony before smiling that winning smile that always made Tony melt. “I do actually...” he said with that smile. Tony nodded at that as he continued with his food. “How bout you?...you inlove with anyone?” Steve asked as he finished swallowing a meatball. Tony merely stared up the ceiling at that, shrugging his shoulders as he answered a “ I don’t know...really..” the blond had chuckled at that as he stared with tender eyes at his brother. Tony chuckled as well as he tried to play with his meatball. Before he could managed to place it in his mouth Steve had stood up from his chair and leaned down on Tony’s side as he placed his fingers on the brunette’s chin. wiping the younger teen’s cheeks with his thumb, “you’re such a messy eater...what would you do without me..” Steve whispered with lidded eyes as he leaned in closer to Tony’s space. The brunette’s breath hitched at how close they were, so close that he could feel Steve’s breath on him. A shiver ran down his spine as he tried to control his heart. He wanted this, he wanted his brother to kiss so bad. He had never initiated their kisses, it was always Steve who kissed first. But right now he was willing to take that chance as he leaned into to the blond, just as their lips were about to touch Steve’s phone rang, startling them as Steve got up from his side.
Don’t hate me for making Sharon a bit of a bitch here XD
“Tony’s right…you don’t need to go home. If you want, i got an extra room next to the master bedroom…you can take a rest there if your tired.” Steve offered with a warm smile. “I’m also talking bout your friend here of course.”
Clint was about to open his mouth when Thor had suddenly interrupted him. “Back in Asgard, we alpha’s are known to take absolute good care with our mates. Seeing as Steve is nowhere in sight…i believe it would be best if me and my brother were to…..help. In this situation.” Thor explained. Hands slowly reaching out to touch at the moaning omega’s side as Loki continued to play with his nipples.
The omega’s arousal had suddenly filled the room, making the Alpha’s dick harden. The brunette was presenting, Blue eyes instantly widen at that. The omega wanted this, wanted him. Without a second thought Steve had reached a large hand and placed it on the omega’s head. making the omega whimper again as Steve guided his head to the side, exposing just enough of the bond gland to be shown. If the commander’s lips were dry before now they left like the desert, hot and greedy for the pool of blood that would soon quench them. With a few licks to the side of the gland he could feel the omega shiver as he began to press and suckle at the sensitive gland. A burning in his heart rose as he finally sank his teeth and blood began to spill. Big hands pinning the whining omega desperately against the bed as he felt the other begin to shift and turn from the pain. Tongue quickly darting out to clean and apologize as the bond gland was finally broken.
"I am very happy to have you be the one to have captured me from my kingdom then..." Loki whispered as he felt Thor's hands start to Caresse his waist. "As am i..." Thor hummed.
The two were frowning at him though, confusion on their faces as they stared at their tired uncle. “Wait...did you say..introduced us to each other?” Steve questioned as he leaned towards his uncle who raised a brow at him. “Yes...i did...you see the thing is...you two aren’t really brothers...”
Steve couldn’t help but smile as he walked across the city streets with the small incubus by his side, the adorable demon was openly glancing around as he held his new master’s hand tight. Clearly enjoying the little stroll as much as Steve was. His little wings that didn’t seem to be meant for flying flapped cutely from behind him. It was a sight to behold really.
“I just...i really just want to feel you more..just before you go away next week...if-if it’s okay with you..” was all he could say as he waited for the omega who smiled widely at him with a nod. With Steve’s permission Tony leaned closer and pressed his lips against Steve’s agains. The omega shivered in delight as he leaned into the kiss, Loving how Tony’s trembling hands were roaming his body. Before he knew it Tony was gently laying him down on the ground as his hand started to play with the omega’s erect nipple. Steve gasping when Tony’s lips had began to travel down his throat, kissing and sucking pale skin before leaving small marks on them. The Alpha Moaned when Steve’s hand had traveled down his clothed crotch. Palming him as he bucked his hips downward. Loving how Steve also lifted up his hips to press his bulge against the alpha’s thighs.

When it was finally lunch time, the two sat down on the grass, eating the delicious lasagna Tony had brought. Steve smiling brilliantly as he tried feeding the brunette from his fork. Heart thumping loudly when the smaller teen eagerly opened his mouth to take it. Tony hadn’t even realized that half the students outside were gawking at them, with their mouths wide open as Steve fed Tony more lasagna. Ohhh the envy everyone had as they stared longingly at the hot blond. Why couldn’t that be them Steve was hanging out with. Why didn’t Steve looked at them lovingly like he looked at that Stark nerd. What did he even see in the loser? With his messy curly hair and big framed glasses? A few of the cheerleaders were already narrowing their eyes at the tiny nerd. Who the heck did he think he was stealing the hot Jock’s attention all to himself?.
—————————————————————
For those thinking that i twisted stuff and made this feel like it isn’t incest anymore, i tagged it incest since the first few chapters i knew there would be readers telling me that this needs to be tagged incest..i really had a hard time with that as I didn’t want to spoil the whole plot...so this is my apology if anyone thinks i made this into something it’s not..
When he had told Steve this, as he sat on his lap. The blond had only smiled as he took a slice of the pie and placed it in his mouth, telling Tony that the man might of been an angel. And that that angel was probably back in heaven by now. Tony couldn’t help but chuckle at that as he nuzzled comfortably against his king’s chest. All happy and unaware of what truly happened to his poor savior.
Because while Steve didn’t have the chance to accidentally feel his crotch anymore, he was absolutely feeling Steve’s massive one press behind him. It was his usual wake up call ever since Steve had started spooning him. To make things worst the hybrid would unconsciously hump him in his sleep, making Tony stiffen and bite his lips. There had been four incidences where Tony had actually came in his pants sweating and panting as Steve humped his massive hard dick against his bottom. His small noise and smell waking up the hybrid immediately giving him the chance to loosen the hybrids grip and scattering away into the bathroom.
For Crap’s sake he couldn’t even go near the blond and just talk to him in front of everyone. For some reason every time he did Steve would have this look on his face that Tony couldn’t read, before sputtering that he had to go. Leaving Tony hurt and confused. So if that’s how it was going to be like then Tony didn’t care anymore. He was tired of constantly dying inside at the sight of his brother being happy with someone else in public. If Steve wanted to be cold towards him in public he wanted to be cold towards him at home too..But that was easier said than done as he felt his knees go weak every time Steve would go near him when they were alone..would start touching him, kissing him the way the blond knew he liked it.

I hope you guys liked this one..please share your thoughts on this chapter I’d love to hear them
Peter quickly spun around and lectured the other teen about kissing him in public. Especially when his brother was around.
“Steve...let me go please...ugh, your hurting me..Steve! Ugh...let go!” Tony snapped as he tried to pull his wrist away from the blond’s strong grip while Steve lead them down the stairs, through a bunch of drunk seniors. When they had almost reached the door Tony had tried to pull harder as he didn’t like how Steve was treating him. shouting for the blond to let him go through the loud music. Steve had instantly turned to stare at him with raging blue eyes. “SO WHAT?! You can go get even more drunk and go back up there and make out some more with Bucky?!” Steve snapped as he towered over his little brother, grip tightening even more as Tony tried to pull away once again. “So what?! At least he doesn’t just fucking leave me alone for hours, while coming home drunk and ignoring me whenever were out in public! AT LEAST HE’S NOT MY BROTHER!” Tony yelled as he fought the tears that were trying to escape, Not caring who heard him anymore. Which he guessed no one did since the music was too loud and most of the people inside were already wasted or passed out.

Tony sigh as he wasn’t listening anymore as it probably was none of his concern what the man was talking about to his King. Instead the brunette had leaned his head against the Hydra kings thigh as he felt Steve’s large fingers start to play with his locks. Making him feel sleepy as he tried to ignore the man’s voice. It had been two weeks since Steve and him were married. And a week since Loki and Thor had said their farewells as well. He would be eternally grateful for the dark haired prince who had saved Pepper’s life in the dessert and had given him small advices on his wedding night before they had entered the bath. When it was time for the two Asgardian royals to bid goodbye Tony hugged the dark haired one tight. getting a bit of a frown from Steve but nothing else than that. for whatever reason after he had accepted his love for the man, Tony had been more brave and relax beside his King. This seemed to do good to the blond as well as he was smiling more now that Tony wasn’t so afraid of him. Steve had even made Pepper one of Tony’s hand maidens as Tony had assured him that there was nothing going on between him and the redhead. Yes maybe everything would be smooth sailing from now own between them. Tony thought as he drifted away on the kings lap.
Unaware of blue eyes staring at them from the corner of the room.
A giant grin spread on the Hydra’s face as he loosen his hold on the woman and drop her next to Tony who crawled to hug her as she coughed for air. “You’ll knell for me? You say..” Steve asked as he watched Tony look up at him. A short nod was all the Brunette could do as he answered a ‘yes’ to the King. “Just...please..let her live...” Tony begged with his cracked voice. Pepper burrowed her face in his arms as he tried to protect her.
Tony smiled brilliantly as he saw Steve appear on his phone’s screen. Pepper by his side rolled her eyes as the man had called and texted Steve eight times that day, and now that they were finally back at their hotel Tony had asked Steve to have a video call with him. Tony had explained that it was really so Steve wouldn’t worry too much about him, when in reality Pepper knew it was Tony who was getting all caught up in knowing how Steve was doing. The man couldn’t live a second without knowing what the blond was up to. It was cute but a bit annoying. She stopped her eye roll though when Steve smiled at her with his adorable tail twirling around in the background. Well..with a Hybrid like that who wouldn’t be obsessed.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony never batted an eye as he let the whispers pass him by until he reached the King’s throne. Blue eyes stared straight through him, intent on making him want to squirm. With his knees feeling weak he dropped to the floor with his head held high. Eyes never breaking away from Steve’s as he slowly began to bow his head. The entire kingdom went silent in anticipation as King Steve rose from his Thorn. He got up to stand in front of the kneeling prince, face hard to read as a rock. After a brief second of staring Tony lifted his hands to reach up and reveal the king’s enormous erection that had only been covered by the small material. Sucking in a breath Tony closed his eyes as he stuck out his tongue to try and lick the tip of the monstrous erection facing him
Clint yawned as he stretched his arms and legs on the big purple sofa, startling the sleepy red head settled peacefully on his lap. "Oh..sorry Nat..did i wake you?" The blond ask as he stroked Nat's furry ear while glancing at the clock, it read 10:55pm and Clint cursed as he rubbed his eyes " Come on..we better get to bed now.." Clint whispered as he maneuvered his annoyed red head who's tail was now swishing around. "Come on Natasha...you know we cant sleep here.. I'd get stiff-necked" Natasha only stared at him with tired eyes yawning until her ears twitched, alertness suddenly in her eyes before turning her head and then jumping on all four off Clint's lap. The blond tilted his head before standing up and following the other into the main hall. "Nat?" Clint asked as he reached the red head who was busy staring at the door on all fours, her tail twirling around behind her. Curious, the Blond decided to open the door and see what had gotten Natasha all riled up this time at night.
Tony couldn’t help but to give the man his thanks for saving him from a broken leg or nose.  The man had smiled at that as he as held the Queen a little bit tighter, too awe struck of how beautiful Tony was to realize that a certain king was standing behind them. When Steve had cleared out his throat to get their attention, Tony had beamed instantly as he jumped off the servant’s arm as he ran to give his king a warm hug.
The two were absolutely close at home, but when they were in school, things were a bit different. Steve mostly didn’t interact with Tony that much whenever they’d bump into each other. The blond mostly steering clear of the brunette as best as he could for some reason. Which Tony didn’t mind really..he had other things to think about and other people to talk to. Plus he always had Steve all to himself whenever they were finally at home again.
Steve was grinning like a drunken fool when he saw the beautiful brunette arrive on the bleachers. He couldn’t help but wave at Tony as the cute nerd shyly waved back. His teammates (including Bucky) had whistled at him when they realized that Tony was there to watch Steve. The whole team had already seen the two walk around campus together. With Steve’s arm wrapped around the smaller teens waist. Face like a victorious warrior that had just claimed his prize.  There were a few teases here and there but Steve really didn’t mind as long as he had Tony with him. “Come on Rogers, get back here..you can be a lover boy later..” the coach shouted when Steve had started running towards Tony. The blond Instantly groaned when he remembered he still needed to practice. Tony had awkwardly smiled at Steve as he gave him two thumbs up making the blond grin stupidly before turning back.
Right now the two were walking hand in hand as Steve held his head high, flaunting his exposed and bruised skin for the other omega’s to see. A few gave him the stink eye before glancing longingly at Tony who didn’t seem to notice as he was too busy glancing at Steve’s bruised skin. Still dumbstruck that Steve would let him mark him. And even more so that Steve was proud to show off that he was Tony’s. All while a few omega’s were trailing them behind. Boy was Tony an adorable oblivious alpha.
Tony hummed as Steve grunted his release. Making Tony drink every single drop of his seed till the very last one.
A few moments later a knock on the door had startled him. He stared at the clock, it was past seven already, they usually never had anyone of their friends come over at this time. He wondered who could be knocking his door, Steve had a key so he didn’t need to knock to be let in. Once Tony turned the doorknob he was surprised to see familiar blue’s staring at him.
“Yeah?...” the redhead asked as she glanced up at him before turning around to where he was staring. immediately she felt her heart strings getting pulled at the sight.
“I’ll get us something warm to drink...tea?” Pepper asked as she got up the small couch. “Coffee is fine..boiling hot please” Tony answered with glee, making Pepper shake her head with a grin. Coffee had no affect on the brunette when he decided to sleep anyways so there was no problem. “So..what are you up to over there?” Tony asked with a smile. “ i just finished making some dinner for us..” Steve answered awkwardly after hearing a light moan in the background. Tony furrowed his brows at that with his cheeks a bit tinted. Steve had already told him about Natasha’s situation earlier so he didn’t have to ask what that noise was, especially since Steve was looking all too flushed as well. after a few seconds of staring at each other’s redden faces Clint suddenly appeared into view in the camera, waving at Tony. He was in his boxers eating a banana. Tony waved back asking how Nat was while sipping the hot coffee Pepper had given him.
“Tony, what are you still doing in bed? Come on your going to make us late.” Steve had barged into his room and grabbed his pillow, making Tony whine as he tried not to look at his brother, for someone who should be having a hang over Steve was doing pretty well.  “Come on cute face...get up..” Tony stilled as he felt Steve’s hot breath against his cheeks, heart thumping fast as he closed his eyes shut while feeling the blond’s lips pressed onto his. Tongue licking his lips a bit, asking for entrance. Tony felt like melting at the sensation and couldn’t help but obey as he opened his mouth for the blond to explore.
Movie night was team bounding night.
“Why don’t you join us in the small living room, as we tell each other stories of ourselves my friend!”
———————————————————-
——————————————————-
“Tony, what have you been doing inside your room all afternoon?” Steve asked with a smirk as opened the door to Tony’s room, the brunette instantly jolted at that as he quickly hid his phone underneath his pillow which Steve eyed right away. “What’s that?” The blond asked as he started to walk towards the younger teen’s bed. “Ummm...nothing...just my phone really..” Tony admitted in a dull tone. “Well why are you hiding it?” Steve asked with a raise brow as his hand started to reach for the pillow that made Tony instantly grabbed his phone from under, “i’m not hiding it!” Tony exclaimed as he placed the phone against his chest. Steve almost growled at that as he stared at Tony with an almost pissed off expression. Tony mirrored him as he held the phone tight. “My phone! My room! Get out!” He snapped as he started to wiggled his knees and feet out of the bed when Steve had started to press his knees on it. Steve frowned at that as he stepped back with hands held high up in the air. “Okay...okay...I won’t push...just come down stairs and hang out with me for a few minutes, i feel like you’ve been spending way too much time inside here...” he pleaded with a soft voice. Tony felt a bit guilty at that since he really was trying to avoid Steve inside their house, but then he’d remembered how Steve had been avoiding him in school for the past few months and didn’t seem all that guilty with how he treated Tony.
With all his thinking, he hadn’t even realized that he was already at the demon shop. Tony’s eyes had widen at all the objects that were being shown inside the window. There were gags, and whips for Demons who misbehaved. There were also books, collars and delicious looking dildos that made the tiny demon swallow.
But  with his abnormally small size and pale skin Tony had to hand it to him, the tiny blond sure could stand his ground. Ready more than ever to take up a fight as he saw the brunette approach him. All Tony could do was hold both hands up as he slowly walked towards the fuming blond who’s eyes were already turning beat red in the dark. Luckily he had remembered his muffin that he had just bought and decided to try and give it as a peace offering to the angry Hybrid.
Then an idea had hit him. The idea that he could actually make Tony fall inlove with him instead of Bucky..and then they’d both get who they wanted. It was so simple.
“Dad! Dad! I saw Peter and Wade kissing behind the big tree outside our house the other day!” Morgan suddenly said with small crumbs on her cheeks. Harley’s eyes widen at his sister’s words as he quickly whispered to her that it was suppose to be their secret. With a swift move Steve was out of the house making Tony groan in frustration. “Morgan...we need to talk after this..” he said sternly before walking near the door and calling out for the blond hydra who was quickly disappearing into the woods.
With a groan Steve finally placed the burger near Tony’s mouth again, making the alpha smile with a small ‘yey’. “Okay...I’ll talk to him...but your not leaving my sight ever again” “i thought I already was?” The alpha blinked up at him innocently. Making the omega suddenly feel wet, yup..he was going to apologize to Bucky, he couldn’t blame his best friend or any other alpha’s if they felt the same way..but this just proved that he had to be more extra vigilant in taking care of his alpha because damn it. Tony was just too cute to not get a hard on, or in his case also get wet..oh he’d never let the alpha out of his sight again.
“Tony? Anything wrong?” He asked, concern written all over his gorgeous face. The alpha couldn’t help but smile at that. “No…just a bit tired is all…my eyes are playing tricks with me again…i think i better hit the sack..” Tony yawned as he tried to stand up. But the omega had other plans as he gently tugged the other’s arm back down again. Pleading with big puppy dog eyes for the alpha to stay. “ im really enjoying this movie…but im not very close with the rest of the team as i am with you…please stay, i…i just don’t really wanna feel alone again…”
———————————————————
At the middle of the day Bucky had arrived to play video games with Steve, right away noticing the younger brunette’s friend wearing his jammies. “Looks like someone had a good night..” Bucky joked as he tried not to glanced at Steves younger brother. Steve furrowed his brows at that as he said that Tony had offered Pepper a place to stay for a while, filling him in on why she needed a place to stay. Tony had blushed when his brother’s friend had smirked at with charmingly. Telling him that he was such an angel and that Pepper was lucky to have a friend like him. The blush didn’t go unnoticed by his older brother though as Steve gave Tony a look making the brunette sit up straight as he tried not to look at Bucky again, Who was chuckling.
Once they had arrived at the front of the brunette’s house, Steve had hesitantly let go of the smaller teens hand. “Um...thank you for the date...even though i really didn’t see what the point of that was..i mean we just ate...”  Tony said as he scratched his head a bit. Steve huffed at that, looking offended. “The point of that date was me getting valuable informations from you for our next dates...” Tony stared at him a bit at that since he really didn’t think knowing his favorite color was really valuable information. But instead he blurted out “next date?...y-you mean we have to go on more dates?” He asked with wide eyes. Steve nodded as he stared seriously at him. “Of course, you didn’t think one date was enough to get you prepared for the real thing did you? From what i could tell you never had a date in your entire life...you wouldn’t want to bore Bucky to death with you just eating and glancing around uncomfortably would you?” Steve stated as he cocked a brow at Tony who shook his head frantically at him. “No!...oh my gosh was i that bad?” He asked as he placed both his hands over his face. “No...and don’t worry...tomorrow we’ll have our second date..” Steve said as he placed a hand on Tony’s shoulder, making the shorter teen look up from under his hands. “Tomorrow’s Saturday...” He asked from under his lashes. Steve smirked at that as he nodded. “That’s why tomorrow we go to the park...have a nice picnic...and get to know each other mo-i mean I’ll give you some information on Bu-Bucky...” Steve stuttered as he quickly took his hand back and placed it inside his pocket.
Tony walked down the large hall with as much jewelry as he could carry. His head held high as he walked steadily to the king’s well polished throne. Steve was seated waiting and ready for Tony to approach him, and Just like Tony he had wore nothing but the dark silk around his waist. His large magnificent chest bare for the world to see. Tony swallowed as he saw the large handsome king’s perfect physic, Muscles everywhere as his bright blue eyes grew dark as he stared intensely at Tony.
Steve frown at that, his ears dropping low in concern. his face just looking undeniably adorable, Tony swore his heart forgot to beat at the sight. “I’m fine Steve...” he assured the worried hybrid. “You don’t know how glad i am Steve’s here Tones...he’s been helping out here with Nat’s heat real good!” Clint said as he patted Steve’s broad shoulder. Tony made a face at that, making Steve Blush at realizing what he might of been thinking. “I mean with the apartment Tony...Steve here had done his best taking care of everything while i got busy tending to Nat..it’s really hard sometimes when she gets into her heats..i practically cant do anything around..” a faint smile appeared in the hybrids face hearing the praise from the other blond . “I’m sure he’s done good over there..” Tony winked before yawning a bit. It was already late in L.A, glancing a bit he saw Pepper already laying on her bed tea forgotten on the coffee table near her bed. “Well..i better Hit the sack now..Peppers already snoring..” a slipper was thrown right beside his head at that “you three take care now..see you on Thursday Steve I’ll bring you some caps here for your collection” Tony smiled tiredly when Steve beamed at that. “Love you, bye!” Tony said and made kissing noises “bye Tones..Clint said with a blushing Steve waving at him before ending the call.
“What? Wait..he seriously never jumped at her during her heat?” Sharon asked wide eye as her two hybrids looked at Steve wide eyed as well. The big blond couldn’t help but blush as he squirmed uncomfortably in his chair. “Well....his body was a bit messed up when Tony bought him to me...” Bruce answered.  “Speaking of heat..I’ve got to stack up on my food supplies again..poor Nats gonna be in heat again this week..” Clint scratched his head as he glanced down at his hybrid who was busy playing with Steve’s toys. “Oh...would you love for one of the boys to come help Nat out?..” Sharon offered. “No it’s okay...i always take care of her during her heats...I wouldn’t want them wreaking the place..you know how They are when around a female in heat” Clint squinted his eyes and furrowed his brows at the thought. “Yeah..i get it..” Sharon agreed.
“Tony?”
Steve and Thor had wide broad smiles plastered on their handsome faces as they sat on the edge of the pool inside the spacious bath chamber connected to the king’s chamber. Steve could feel his heart thump inside his chest as he watched his beautiful bride walk slowly towards him. His tiny red silk cloth hang loosely around his waist, no doubt Loki’s doing. He needed to remind himself to thank the dark haired Asgardian Prince. It was clear he wanted Tony to look absolutely fuckable for Steve that night. He could barely control himself as he watched with lust filled eyes as Tony and Loki stepped into the water slowly taking off their only piece of clothing, revealing their half hard erections that looked absolutely delicious. Especially Tony’s, Steve thought with a smirk. Tony yelped a bit when Steve had impatiently pulled him down onto his lap. Splashing a bit of water outside the pool in doing so. Thor chuckling at them before he glanced at Loki who had settled himself on his lap.
His father had left him there until the Hydra army had arrived and asked for him. With a spat Howard barked for them to leave! Closing his gates as a sign of broken bounds, But the hydra king didn’t budge trying to negotiate until he had lost his temper at the stubborn Stark. With a final offer he shouted that if Howard would not bring Tony to him he would burn the entire kingdom down, killing every man women and children in sight. Only sparing them in exchange for the Prince.
Steve glanced at the clock where it said 7:30pm. The blond Hybrid sigh as he tried to finish his painting. Tony was supposed to be home 15 minutes ago, like he always did after work. The food that Steve had prepared had gotten cold and he guessed he’d have to microwave it once Tony got home. Steve always wanted to greet the man with warm home cooked meals, ever since had found out that Tony wasn’t really a good cook, Knowing only how to cook eggs. he made it his goal to learn how to bake and cook for the wonderful yet sometimes overly worked brunette. Tony was an engineer and always had blue prints and tools laying around the apartment which Steve was always happy to clean up after. He’d worry sometimes as the man would forget to sleep whenever he was designing something for a client or talking on the phone with his men or pepper. But no matter how busy Tony always got at work, he had always come Home on time for Steve to greet him. The Hybrid frowned as he swished his tail while waiting for his owner.
That morning Steve had been extra attentive and pampered Tony with lots of kisses and touches. The brunette had immediately felt better as Steve fed him breakfast. This was all he really wanted, for his brother to be with him. Be right next to him. When they were about to get up from the bus Steve had lingered on their kiss a little more before pulling away, making the brunette feel a bit light headed as he tried to breath normally again. But just as they had got out of the bus, Steve immediately drifted away from him the moment his friends (along with Peggy) had greeted him.
“S-steve…Aaah…” Tony moaned out loud as the alpha above him, continued to thrust brutally into his abused hole. Licking and sucking harshly on the already broken bound gland.
Tony swallowed hard as his new Hydra husband started undressing him. Gently pulling apart his robe which he had worn earlier that day. Tonight was their first night as husband and wife, and although Steve had assured him that it was okay if they didn’t do it tonight. Tony was determined to do his duties as Steve’s chosen mate.
Thursday...
Fuck! This wasn’t what was supposed to happen. He was supposed to be happy today of all days but now all he could think about was Steve. Maybe he shouldn’t of said it like that maybe if he had-what? Oh god he was a mess..he really really hated himself right now. “Hey Tony! Hows-ugh you feeling okay?” A red haired beta ask as he came closer to him. “Not really...i think i might have the jitters Pep..” Tony said as he tried not to vomit. Pepper frowned at that “oh...i know things like this can be overwhelming sometimes but-“ before she could continue Tony had held his hand up in front of her “hold that thought-mmmm” “oh my god...” Pepper wince as she watched Tony disappear into the crowd looking like he was about to poke. Well could be worst...She thought.
“aahhh…s-stop! Ah! Steve! N-no…oh! Ah!!! The brunette protested weakly through moans as large hands continued to ravish his body. “Are you in-ah..ah…sane?…i’ve just been bo-bounded…ahh…”
Next chappy will be up in about one or two days...pls leave a comment and gibe me your thoughts! I honestly hope you guy's are still interested
Maybe it was because he just wasn’t use to seeing his friend hitting on a random stranger in the middle of a bar. And what if he was, it wasn’t like they’d end up together. Steve and him had promised each other that they’d both wait for their soulmates and never go on dates with other people until then. Call them hopeless romantics, ( which they really were ) but they really did believe in waiting for the right one. For the perfect match that would finally make them whole. Yes, they read the books..and the old stories Steve’s ma told them about love at first sight. Sparks flying in the air and wrist suddenly feeling like their getting pulled towards each other. And boy did they want that. After hearing the stories, both young men swore to never have distractions as they’d wait for the one that was meant for them.
“Very well..”
Tony nodded at that, not minding the small blush that had appeared on the blond’s face. He must really feel awkward with Tony doing something like that. “So what do we do then?...how are you going to help me and Bucky get together?” Tony asked curiously as he tilted his head. A smile had appeared on the blond’s face at that, making Tony go red a bit. He had not expected to see the blond smile like that at him. Steve really was handsome, especially if he was smiling..especially if that smile was directed at him.
When the battle had ended Steve had returned home bloody and tired, One of the maidens, a red headed woman had ran to the king’s general’s side when she noticed he was barely breathing and missing an arm. The gruesome battle had lasted 16 days with Steve and his alley coming out victorious as he ran a spear through the invading king’s heart.
Peter smiled at that before hearing Ned call him from the pool. “HEY BIRTHDAY BOY! COME ON! WE’RE GONNA PLAY SPIN THE BOTTLE! I THINK SOME OF THE GIRLS HERE WANNA GIVE YOU A BIG KISS!” the other people started to cheer and laugh as Peter chuckled at them. But not missing the way Wade was looking at him fondly. “Come on…your birthday’s not over yet…” Wade said with a grin as he wiggled his brows at him. Peter couldn’t help but take the older teen’s hand and tangle it with his as they walked towards the geoup of people waiting for them.
He inhaled as he glanced down at the sleeping blond who for once since he’d found him last night, looked absolutely peaceful. He looked younger and more cuter now that his face wasn’t covered in a scowl. Unconsciously he traced a finger on the tiny blonds hair, twirling a strand as he took in the adorable sight in front of him.
Tony blushed as he stared dazed at the handsome adonis he had just shared his first kiss with, That had been the most amazing feeling he had ever had in his entire life. He hadn’t known kissing could feel that good. His mother had always told him that kissing only felt good when you did it with someone you loved. Boy was she wrong..because Steve was no Bucky, but damn it that had felt amazing. He wondered what it would feel like when he was doing it with Bucky. If it felt this good with Steve, it would probably feel like heaven with Bucky. A frown had suddenly appeared at the blond’s face all of a sudden making Tony wonder what was wrong for a moment. “He might not think the same way as you since he’s kissed more than enough people to actually make it feel special for him anymore” Steve said with a scowl, which made Tony’s eyes open wide. Crap, did he actually said that out loud for Steve to tell him that?
A groan escaped the king’s mouth as he bucked his hips forward at the sweet sensation. His large hand quick to wrap around the princes dark curly locks. Making Tony choke as he buried His cock deep inside the Princes warm mouth. Tears trailed down the Princes flush cheeks as Steve began face fucking the quivering brunette. His pace becoming more jerky as he pounded into the Princes mouth.
this story really isn’t about them being related or not..it’s the story of their uncontrollable love for each other, weather they were related or not...
Right now though Steve’s main mission was to finish all this up before lunch time because he was already starving. It must past noon already. He groaned again as he bent down to get his axe, only to stop when he had noticed his omega’s scent.
Tony frowned as he glanced at the clock on the wall. It was already ten at night, a school night in fact. Steve still hadn’t come home yet or even given him a call. He hated this feeling he had right now. his insecurities rising up at the thought that Steve could actually live with out him. The blond had said when they were younger that he had wanted Tony to be with him forever, but his actions recently were telling Tony he was probably having second thoughts on that. Ever since Steve had started his senior year he had acted more distance towards Tony. A year ago they didn’t really kiss or even hold hands anymore in public, yet the blond had still made sure to go over the brunette’s locker. He had always made time to walk pass his class and wave at him, even eat lunch with him from time to time. But now Steve was all of a sudden too busy to notice him walking in the hallway, in too much of a hurry to wave at him whenever he pass by Tony’s class. even at lunch Tony would find Steve sitting in a full table with his friends not batting an eye at him. It was okay really, Tony didn’t mind. Steve after all had a life of his own. He didn’t need to always hover over Tony like Tony was some little kid that needed to always be taken care of. But it still hurt when Tony thought about it. When he was finally alone and had no one to occupy his mind from the blond’s recent actions. And now Steve had been coming home later on most nights which was really starting to nag at the brunette. What Tony hated most though was the fact that whenever Steve would come home he would act like nothing was wrong, like he hadn’t been distant at all. He would place soft kisses and pamper Tony, making the younger teen feel better and forget all the bad thoughts right away.
———————————————————
Steve frowned at the Brunette's sudden silence. Deciding to Smack the Prince's round ass as he pinched the bruised nipples even harder. Tony cried at the harsh treatment before coming hard as the King continued to thrust up inside of him.
The two royal guards who stood on opposite side's of the Throne room's door, glanced at each other with silent knowing looks as groans and muffled moans escaped through the slightly opened door. The king made sure for all the kingdom to hear of the Prince's pleasures coming from him. As he let the guards open up all the windows in the throne room before he ordered them to step outside and leave the Doors slightly open.
Steve smiled brilliantly at the large banquet table filled with meats, pastries and wine. decorated with lavish gold, petals and wild fruits from the palace gardens. Tony had never been so full in his entire life as Steve fed him different kinds of sweets and dishes that where only grown and harvested in the Hydra’s lands. Back at his old kingdom his father had never let him eat too much as it was improper for a Stark prince to eat his fill, saying that noble bloods should never give in to gluttony as it was one of the disgusting sins that turned one into an absolute wreck. Steve however was having none of it as the brunette had known the hydra loved to over indulge in what the table had to offer, though seeing him train and fight in combat Tony knew why he did so.
“You certainly have caught yourself a beautiful one my friend...he is as you’ve described him, Congratulations again on the wonderful ceremony!” Thor said with a smile as he raised his golden cup at the king and his newly crowned bride. Loki did so as well as he eyed the small prince unknowingly getting the attention of the blond hydra who pressed Tony closer against his massive chest, not liking how the dark haired Asgardian was eying his bride. Tony made that moment to leaned his head against his neck making Steve snap his attention back to him, Tony had been seated at his lap. Fully stuffed and cheeks even pinker than usual from all the exertion of eating with brown eyes half lidded. The sight alone was enough to make Steve glee with pride knowing the beautiful prince was finally his.
Steve had warned Tony to stay away from his other self, his pack Alpha had seen the way Tony and his duplicate would stare at each other while everyone else was fighting. ‘Mate’... Tony’s mind would tell him every time he would get too close to the other blond. His knees would go weak while his body would begin to present in front of the other Steve, slick would begin to drip along his thighs as the adrenaline and emotion would be too much at that moment. Making him feel weak and powerless as his mind would tell him not to hurt his mate.
The omega waived goodbye as he stepped inside the elevator. Smile as innocent as an omega can give before disappearing through metal doors.
Peter right away elbowed the older teen in the stomach. Making Wade wince in pain at the sudden action. “H-he’s just kidding…besides if we decided to stay, we’ll just hang out with the rest of our friends…” Peter chuckled nervously as he rolled his eyes. “Oh ugh…um, good..i hope you kids have fun…” Tony trailed as he tried to smile at the two. Cheeks still bright red. Steve on the other hand gave a short nod at that before clearing his throat.
——————————————————-
Strangely every time he’d get out of the bathroom the Hybrid would have this weird look on his face inhaling rapidly like he was sniffing out drugs from their room. His face would always be hard and unreadable, Eyes dark and pupils dilated making Tony feel a bit uncomfortable. The hybrid would snap out of it however once he’d hear Tony call him. Face looking all soft and innocent once again as he’d smile at him. Tonight was the first night In a year Tony wouldn’t have the hybrids massive hands around him.
“As a friend?...” Steve pressed which made Tony frown at his food. “Yes...of course..” he answered without glancing up. “Okay.” Was the only reply he got after that.
Take in note this is pure fiction! So please dont get offended or angry at anyone. And this is just me having a different take on the whole Steve finds bucky and forgets about Tony angst. Here Tony isn’t going to be all sad and insecure when Steve’s away with Buck.
“I thought you lived alone?”
“P-please…it’s alright…i really can handle this…t-thank you for everything but you can all lea-mmmnnn…” Tony couldn’t help but moaned when Loki had suddenly kissed him passionately. Heart racing fast as it felt so good when he felt the other’s tongue dance around his. When Loki had finally withdrawn from the heated liplock. Tony couldn’t help to whimper at the lost of contact, unconscioly following the smirking alpha’s retreating lips.
Glad things are finally sorted out with the two blonds right?
Steve immediately snapped up his head at the man who dared interrupt him with his queen. blue eyes narrowing dangerously as he growled at him. “WHAT?!” The man immediately stepped back a bit as his eyes widen at the kings vicious look. “My king...as i keep reminding you we do need-“
"Steve please..." he whispered through thick fingers that traced his face. "Husshhh...my Love" Steve whispered as he carefully placed Tony on his lap. "But Steve...there are innocent people there...children..." Tony begun as he clutched at the muscular shoulder. "They did not seem all that innocent when they all spat at you." A growl rumbled from the Hydra King's chest. "Th-they didn't know any better...Steve.." the prince pleaded as he wrapped his slender arms around the hydra kings neck. Showing as much submission as he could, The larger man only smiled and shook his head at the beautiful prince. "They don't deserve your mercy Tony.. they never did!" He growled angrily before he kissed the other's nose and leaned on his head. screams could be heard as the city Tony once knew burned to ashes. Weil's and screams from men, women and even children echoed out to where Steve and Tony were settled
“Um…Steve?”
The diner was packed when they arrived. Luckily Sharon and her gang had waved at Steve when he had entered with Tony by his side. The group of girls had instantly made room for the jock but none for Tony who remained standing when Sharon had pulled Steve down to sit next to her. “Oh sorry...we only have room for Stevie here..” Sharon said apologetically as she leaned towards the jock. Tony nodded at that as he started to look around if there were any available table’s else where. Steve had blinked at that. “It’s alright...Tony can sit on my lap..” Steve offered innocently as he patted his knee for emphasis. Sharon and the rest of the girls had immediately widen their eyes at that. With Tony blushing hard as he stared at Steve’s lap. “No! no...ugh it’s okay...i think I’m just gonna go and sit somewhere else..” Tony trailed as he tried to look around again. Steve frowned at that as he started to stand up. “Then I’ll go with you..” before he could fully stand up however Sharon had instantly pulled him down again. “You know what?! I think Sunset actually needs to go home now..right Sunny?” Sharon said sweetly, her smile stretched so wide that it looked like it hurt. Sunset frown at that. “What? I don’t ha-“ before she could finish her sentence one of the girls had kicked her off the table, making enough room for Tony to slide right next to Steve who immediately wrap his arm around his shoulder.
Tony inhaled sharply as the servants had finished decorating him with jewelry. He only wore a red silk wrapped around his waist while the rest of his body lay bare for the whole kingdom to see. His arms and chest were draped with  extravagant jewelry. Head placed with a small thin golden crown as his hair was neatly combed for the occasion, Even though his curls would stick out eventually.
Now if only Tony and the rest of the gang were having an easier time getting in touch Thor’s master.
Tony had immidiately made a face at the blond’s surprise offer. Cheeks tinting with a bit of red as he asked the billioner if he was sure about that? “Yeah im sure…my walls are soundproof so there’s no need to worry…” Steve said with a wink.
But Steve was always okay with it. Even seeming to enjoy it! He thinks with a sigh. what if Steve actually found his soulmate? Would it still be okay for Tony to be clingy then? Would they even still live together? He’s sure the two would probably want to find a place of their own to start a family.
But no matter how much they cared for each other the two didn’t always see eye to eye on things, especially when it came to Steve. Tony was head over heals for him and yet Pepper had always been a little on edge ever whenever the blond hydra was with them, whispering to Tony she had a bad feeling about the man but Tony had brushed it off as he was so infatuated by the Hydras charm and pleasing personality. He was like a knight in shining armor ready to rescue Tony from whatever prison he was in.
He couldn’t think further about it though when Tony had started to arch his back. Begging Steve to play with him some more as he presented his beautiful pink nipples to him. With a low groan Steve greedily sucked on the offered buds. Suckling each one as if his life depended on it. His dick hardening as he heard the tiny demon moan out his pleasure. With a grin Steve’s tongue twirled around the bruised tit as one of his hands started to go down on the demons ass. fingers quickly parting smooth ass cheeks, only to find that it was already slick. Fuck...Tony was so wet...Steve didn’t even have to prepare him anymore, well he was a sex demon. With a grunt the blond began to position his demon’s legs on top of his shoulders. His hands quickly freeing his throbbing erection as watched the small demon lick his lips at the sight. “You want this sweetheart?” Steve asked with a husky voice as he positioned his cock at the demons entrance, not really waiting for an answer as he began to enter his twitching dick inside the wet warm hole. Tony had shivered at the hot sensation, he hadn’t seemed to have a dick as big as Steve’s before. Since he was clearly a bit in pain, the blond really hoped Tony didn’t have that much sexual experience even for an incubus. Even though he knew he was being silly at the thought. but the mere image of someone as cute as Tony being taken advantage of by someone else was making Steve a bit angry. and come to think of it, Steve was sure the demons brother Bucky had probably had a go with him as well. The way the older demon had licked him shamelessly in front of them. Steve couldn’t help but wonder if the two had actually ever fed off each other. The image of Tony’s bigger brother penetrating him was enough to make Steve growl as he snapped his hips in a brutally harsh pace, making the incubus cry out in pure pleasure as Steve began to hit him right where he wanted.
When they had arrived at the brunette’s class Steve was ready to turn and walk towards his own class when Tony had suddenly tugged at his arm, startling the blond as he turned to look at the junior. “Um...is it okay if we sit together later at lunch? I um...I actually bought some lasagna...i have it at my locker, you told me on Saturday that it’s your favorite...i figured I’d give you something you like since you keep giving me free food.” Tony said with a small smile. Steve just stood silently in front of him, blue eyes a bit wide as he stared at the younger teen. “Um...ugh or not if y-you don’t wa-“ Tony stuttered nervously when he realized the blond probably didn’t want to sit with him. “I’d love too! I mean..i..yeah, sure let’s sit together at lunch later...I’m cool with that...” Steve said instantly making Tony smile back at him again. “Really?” Tony asked with such an adorable face that Steve couldn’t help but smile in a goofy way. “Yeah yeah...I can’t believe you bought me lasagna..” Steve said with a stupid grin. Tony just giggled at that as he told the blond that he wasn’t the only one taking down notes. The blond had rubbed his head sheepishly again at that before turning around and walking towards his own classroom. But not before giving the smaller teen a quick kiss.
“It’s fucking Tony Stark man! He was just so adorable panting and sweating like that!”
"Night Tony! And uh...Steve.." Clint nodded as he waved at them, "Night Clint! Nat!" Tony smiled as Steve who was tagging at his coat slowly followed him inside before closing the door. Clint grinned before closing his door as well, yawning  "So? What were we doing earlier?" Clint asked as he watched Natasha swish her tail lazily while getting inside the bedroom. "Oh yeah...sleep... finally.." he said as he closed the lights.
“I can’t wait to take you now as my husband Tony...you don’t know how happy you’ve made me feel today..” Steve whispered huskily as he bit the brunette’s earlobe. A shiver went through the other’s body at that, making Steve grin as he started playing with Tony’s curls. Glancing a bit at his friend who was busy tracing kisses on his lover’s face. “Thank you again for joining us tonight Thor...you two shall be our witness as we consummate our marriage..” Steve smiled genuinely. Thor glanced back at him as he finished placing a small kiss on Loki’s nose. “We are honored to be your witnesses tonight dear friend...it is tradition to have another royal couple see to it that the wedding night goes well..and we are pleased that you have chosen us Steve” Thor smiled before he glanced at Loki again who was busy pouring a bottle of oil on his hands and spreading it on to the blond’s chest. Steve nodded thoughtful at that as he turned to watch Tony who was also busy rubbing oil on Steve’s broad chest.
Steve pinned Tony against a wall, inside the massive hallway leading to the master bedroom. Tony moaned before trying to get away from the hungry blond’s mouth that had settled to nibble on his earlobe instead. “Steve wait…not here please…the kid’s mig-mmm..” Steve greedily devoured his lips again. Tongue exploring the insides  of Tony’s mouth before pulling away with a devilish grin. “You know i’ve been waiting all day to finally have you all to myself again…” Steve breathed as he decided to trail his tongue down the other’s neck.
“I wouldn’t do that if i were you...”
Tony could only nod as he shut his eye's. a Harsh pinch on one of his nipples made him jolt and moan out a sloppy 'yes' before being fucked roughly on the King's lap. " do you love it when i take you Tony? Do you..Fuck...love me.." the blond asked as he trailed his hand down to wrap around the Prince's neglected dick. "Y-yes...Stev–ahhh!!!...yeesss...i love you..." Tony moaned as he felt his release grew near.
Yes, Tony IS his now..and would forever be bound to him as they both began chanting the ancient prayers that would bound Tony to him eternally. He felt his heart skip a beat when he saw Tony blush a bit while saying the lines ‘my body and soul for his to keep’. Not a hint of his facial expression telling Steve that he was afraid of him.
Tony had known that Steve would be his mate, he could feel it when they were together, weather it was fighting side by side or simply lodging at home. The intensity of what they felt for each other was enough to tell them both that they were for each other. But even then Steve had been very old fashioned as he didn’t mark Tony like some Alpha’s tended to do right away, he instead took his time as he wanted their bonding moment to be special and sacred. Even when Steve had found his first omega Bucky and had brought him back from hydra, the Alpha had become even more caring and loving towards the brunette. Never letting Tony feel left out as Steve would cuddle him and Bucky at the same time. Tony didn’t even really mind when Steve’s first bonded omega had arrived since Bucky was also very touchy towards him. Making Tony feel instantly relaxed when around him. Which was a really good outcome for their team since Everyone felt happy and Tony felt loved and protected.
Tony blinked a few times at that as he felt warm lips pressed against his cheeks, making him grin a bit before yawning as he tried to stretch his arms and legs as best as he could while a hard body was pressed on top of him. “Morning Steve...” he whispered tiredly, eyes squinting a bit making him look absolutely adorable to the blond who was grinning down at him. “Breakfast is ready...” Steve announced as he pulled Tony off the bed. The small brunette giggled as he wrapped his arms around his older brother’s neck. Burying his face against the blond’s chest as he tried to catch a few Z’s while Steve lead them down the kitchen.
“Yeah?”
After the brief staring and cooing the blond eventually yet very hesitantly grabbed the muffin before scrambling away a few feet. Relaxing after a few bites of the delicious treat while Tony slowly came near again with reassuring rambling, Trying his best to convince the hybrid that he really meant well. The poor guy must of had a rough experience with humans for him to be so weary of his presence. But after a few given words the blond had already seemed to let Tony in his personal space. A small victory Tony thought as he kneeled in front of the now full blond.

Once he had mounted off his horse the many servants had quickly gathered to help the injured king. But He had asked his servants to take care of his general first as he headed out to find his queen.
King Steve had a dangerously handsome frown plastered on his face. Tony had frozen in utter silence at the unexpected present his two visitors had given him.
Tony had blushed when Steve had leaned into him, wiping a smudge on his chin as he teased him that he looked like a little kid while eating. Ohhh...how the head cheerleader hated the sight. “What do think we should do about him Sharon?” one of the cheerleaders asked with narrowed eyes as she glanced at the blond cheerleader captain. “Ugh simple! We’ll just simple remind him were his place is...” Sharon said with an evil grin plastered on her pretty face.
“Steve...Steve..come on now, were all friends here..Thor just needs a place to stay for a while okay?” The brunette promised as he tried to calm the angry hybrid that was holding too tight. Steve merely glanced at him before glaring back at the other blond hybrid. Well so much for  trying to talk with him. Honestly Tony should of seen it coming, this wasn’t really the first time Steve had shown his possessiveness towards the brunette. Even when he was a skinny thing back then he had bit one of Tony’s dates ears when the guy had tried to give Tony a kiss. Even one of his client’s had ran out the door when Steve suddenly attacked him when he attempted to pin Tony against the wall. It should of been frustrating since Tony hadn’t been able to find a date since then but honestly seeing his tiny hybrid get so possessive and territorial was just too adorable for the brunette to get upset about. He had always thought it was due to Steve not really trusting anyone but him back then. The hybrid use to be so weary around other people. That all change how ever when he had decided to take had a little stroll around the park with the more muscular Steve , who unexpectedly scratched a hybrid on the face when he had gotten too close to Tony, Purring contently when the engineer had petted him. The two unaware Unaware of a fuming muscular Steve behind them as they interacted. The little stunt his now Supposed to be friendlier hybrid had done had perplex Tony since Steve hadn’t shown any aggression towards other’s since he’d been with him for six months.
“Steve?...” Tony called making the hybrid snapped his head at him. “ me and Clint and the rest of the guys are gonna start hunting for Thor’s owner tomorrow..by what Thor’s told me i think his owner is gonna be easy as pie to find..” Tony winked, the words had sent a smile to form on the blond’s face. They were going to find Thor’s owner! Tony was going to find Thor’s owner! And then everything would be back to normal! “I knew you’d be happy to hear that...and guess what? You, Nat and Thor will be staying at Sharon’s place tomorrow! Isn’t that great?...Sam’s forgiven you for his black eye by the way Bucky..” Tony turned to glanced at the other hybrid who smirked at him, Nat rolling her eyes as she smacked Bucky. Steve on the other hand was staring wide eye at Tony...did he just say Thor was going to be there as well? With a curious glanced he watched as the big blond bursted with a loud laugh as he shared how he had went to London with his parents owner so that he could meet other royal hybrids there, With a heavy sigh Steve frowned with irritation. Tomorrow was going to be a looonnnggg day.
Peter swore he saw Tony’s face grew even redder with what looked like a ‘panic expression on his face’.
Both staring at each other’s lips before carefully pressing them together, Steve’s entire mind and body shivered with delight at how soft Tony’s lips were. unable to hold himself, he began to glide his tongue out, licking lushes pink lips as he closed his eyes, feeling the sensation melt him inside out as he begged and demanded for entrance, which thankfully Tony obliged. For a few short moments their tongues twirled around each other, playfully meeting and sliding against each other till Steve felt himself get stiff down his pants. Regretfully he pulled away from the panting brunette, A strand of saliva connecting both their mouths together as he did. “Wow..” Tony breathed as he tried to regain his breathing, panting as he stared with soft eyes at Steve. The blond couldn’t help but smirk at that as he too couldn’t breath properly.
Before Tony could snap out of his thoughts a huge object had hit him square in the face. Making his whole world spin as he fell on his back.
“Oh my god, Steve?..”
Tony giggled as he watched the blond join his team in the field again. Bucky was there too, all charm and smiles as always, and Tony would stare at him with dreamy eyes. But every so often he’d find himself glancing back at Steve who was busy shouted and running with the rest of the team, looking all sweaty and happy as he passed the ball to another player. A small blush would creep up the brunette’s face whenever the blond would look at him, grinning like a cute little kid that had a lollipop.
oh dear sweet God, he repeats..he was eternally grateful to have Steve. Beautiful, Sweet, considerate and unselfish Steve. The Alpha right away obeyed his omega as he closed his eyes and leaned into Steve’s broad shoulder. Completely unaware of the unconscious Alpha being carried away by a few beta’s from behind them. as well as the omega from earlier sulking on the corner of the bleachers, staring longingly at him.
The night went on as fun and carefree as it began. Tony snickered when he realized how drunk Steve had gotten when he saw the blond hitting on a brunette haired girl from across the bar. “He must think that’s Tony…” Nat teased, elbowing Bruce who chuckled besides Tony.
“Seriously…you’re lucky you got a mom that actually knows how to bake…my mom only knows how to make margareta’s” Tony crinkled his nose as he laughed. The adorable expression made Steve feel like he had a mini heart attack.
“Tony...I’m so sorry if i ever made you feel like i didn’t love you...i just got so caught up with my own feelings that I didn’t stop to think of yours...” a tear began to fall down the brunette’s cheeks again as he tried to peek at his brother’s face. “I’ve been trying to walk away from you but i keep on stumbling...and I’ve been trying to hide it when it’s so clear that my whole world just crumbles when you aren’t here with me...and i know this is so selfish and stupid but...i love you Tony...i love you so much that if ever you were to go away and i had to say goodbye I’d choke...I wouldn’t be able to let go of you...so please...don't leave me..stay with me and be mine..” Steve begged, eyes red and nose stuffy as he held Tony’s face against his. All the brunette could do was cling to him as tears also trailed his cheeks. “God i love you too Steve..but...but we can’t..we shouldn’t-mmm” Tony was cut off as Steve captured his lips once more. chest aching too much to stop what he was doing, He needed this. He needed Tony. He couldn’t handle the brunette’s rejection as he lunged himself at him. Showing the brunette how much he really meant to him.
So i put in five chaps but decided to add this little filler...i hope you liked reading about the kids and Tony and Steve as parents.
In the large open field temple, just outside the large village where the human’s live. Near the entrance to the dark Forest where dark creatures roam. Two souls sit opposite each other as the chosen omega human finally meets the hydra beast that had protected their village for five years now. For every five years a different creature from the hydra lands is chosen by one of the high ranking creatures that have claimed themselves as the protectors and peacekeepers of the whole realm. Including the humans that need as much protection from stupid feral or low leveled hydra creature’s who wish nothing than to kill anything weaker than them just to feel superior. The human’s have been under the protection of the higher ranked hydra creatures for over four hundred years now when they had made a deal.
Tony’s face flushed as he had a dazed look on his face when Steve had finished rubbing against him. The scrawny blond omega trying to get the dazed out alpha’s scent on him as best as he could as he finished rubbing their clothed erections together. Tony whimpering a bit when Steve had finally parted from him, smirking mischievously as the blond omega quietly lead them both back into the hallway. The two had been together now for a year and a half and still Tony would blush like a tomato whenever Steve would Start to scent him. Or even and especially when Steve would ask for him to bite him near his bond gland again. The omega tended to request that whenever they both met at school. Insuring that everyone in their school knew that Tony was his and he was Tony’s. Steve could get very possessive whenever another omega would come near his Alpha. Right away stumping with his skinny legs as best as he could and scent the alpha right then and there. Daring any omega to come between them. Often times his actions have caused him a bit of trouble from his father who keeps telling him to refrain from too much physical contact as he and Tony were not supposed to mark each other until they turned 20. The omega would scowl at that.
Sam had sat down next to Loki at that point. Eyes filled with hunger as he bit his bottom lips. Making Loki growl at him  before nibbling on the omega’s earlobe. Tony mewl in approval. Leaning into the sweet feeling. Giving Thor a chance to place tender kisses on his neck. A starttled groan escaping his lips when he felt something warm and inviting suddenly devour his already harden cock.
All seemed usual to the blond hydra until he heard his little brunette choke. Snapping his head at the startled prince he glanced to where Tony was staring wide eyed. And just like that a vain appeared on his forehead. There on the farthest side of the line was a thin red haired woman staring right back at Tony with big pleading puppy dog eyes. He immediately growled at the prince by his side who had given all his attention to the beautiful red haired woman. Tony flinched as Steve made his irritation known by slamming his fist hard against the throne’s arms.
———————————————————-
The two demons were absolutely beautiful. their eyes incredibly mesmerizing as they blinked up at him. Cheeks naturally tinted, just as the colors of their lips that looked like they were ready to be eaten. Clearly they were brothers as they shared a few similar treats with each other, though Steve could tell the longer haired demon was the older one out of the two. His jaw and cheekbone more sharper than that of the curly haired one. His muscles more leaner and bulkier as well. Steve didn’t miss the way the bigger one was Carefully maneuvering his broader frame, as if trying to hide the smaller one from the blond’s prying eyes. For some strange reason the smaller of the two, had a much softer look on his face. He looked nothing like any demon Steve’s ever since. Even for their kind his face was just too innocent to look like he could actually be what Steve thought he was. No wonder the bigger one was trying to hide him.
Tony was practically radiating with joy when he strolled through the airport. in about half an hour from now he’d soon be with his darling hybrid. He was sure Steve would right away cling to him and never let go as soon as he’d step foot in their building. Pepper was smirking as she stared at the goofy smile Tony had across his face. “Thank you again for going with me Tony..i know how much you missed Steve the whole time we were away..” Pepper mused as she placed a kiss on the engineer’s cheek. Tony just gave her a look saying ‘anything for you’ with a mix of ‘you owe me more coffee and donuts’. The red head just grinned and quickly called for a cab headed their way. Immediately once the cab pulled over, the cab driver got out and helped them with their lag-gage. Pepper getting in right away as she started typing on her phone. Tony was about to get in too when he suddenly spotted something from across the road that made him look twice and stop what he was doing.
In a spacious hallway a certain blond alpha had been standing near a one-way window, blue orbs staring intently at the stirring omega who had been unconscious for over a few hours. He had finally done it. He had finally captured the famous omega, Tony Stark. He had been waiting patiently for this day to come when the omega would finally be his. His other self had made it a damn hell of a process, but it was all worth it now that Tony was here.
“Just now really...you know how Strict his father is...She’s been calling me none stop asking for favors, tryna get me to help her get on dates with him on ungodly hours since their being really sneaky about it..” Steve said with an exasperated smile. Tony was stunned, he couldn’t believe what he was hearing that Peggy all this time he had thought was with Steve, was actually calling the blond for favors. “ but...i see you all the time with her at school..you guys just look so...close..” Tony said as he ducked his head, trying to hide his embarrassment at admitting that he’s been watching the other when he wasn’t looking. “Just like how close you are with Pepper and Rhodey? I’ve seen the way you three interact with each other..you don’t know how many times i tried to remind myself that you guys are just friends..” Steve confessed with a shy smile, Fingers trying to get the brunette to look up at him.
With a small smile, Tony too began undressing his monster of an Alpha. Pulling off the large royal blue robe that Steve had been wearing throughout the day. exposing a wide and muscular chest filled with scars that made the small omega shiver even more at the sight. And before he could even think of doing anything further the Hydra had leaned down to place a kiss on his lips. Making Tony melt as the blond beast had began roaming his body. “Don’t worry..I’ll be gentle..” was all the warning Tony needed when Steve had laid them both on the large futon that was spread on the wooden floor.
Natasha would glance back at the two once or twice through the whole movie duration. Eyes looking suspecious as shed’ cock a brow at the blond. Steve would only stare back in response as he didn’t really care as to what she had to say.
The deal was that the higher ranked elders would chose one of their kind to protect the village from lower forms that loved to terrorize and hunt humans for no good reason than to feel stronger than they really were, as long as the humans in turn let the their protector chose a sacrifice in return the sacrifice being an omega human which the hydra’s knew were better mates and mother’s to their offsprings than their omega counterparts. Hydra omega’s tended to be very unfaithful thanks to their superior strength over their alpha’s. Tending to leave their alpha and offsprings if they got tired of them or found a more interesting Alpha. Alpha’s didn’t have the pheromones that omega’s had to calm or comfortable a sick offspring. So often when an omega leaves her offsprings they die within a month. Human omega’s however seemed to be better in staying loyal to their hydra mates as they know they wouldn’t survive one minute in the hydra land without the larger creatures protection.  And so the higher ranks agreed to protect the humans as the chosen protector would watch over the village for a period of five years. After that he would have the right to claim one of the village omega’s.
The smaller sibling couldn’t help but wonder what was going on as he felt Steve’s strong arms wrap possessively around him, not giving him the chance to squeeze and break free from him. He could feel his heart beat rapidly as he felt Steve start to kiss the back of his head, a habit the blond tended to do when he felt like Tony was upset. A small blush had appeared on Tony’s face as he realized Peggy had glanced at them with a soft all too knowing smile on her face while stroking Daniel’s hair. “Is it okay if you tell us what happened?” Peggy asked as she darter her gaze at the two boys in the backseat. Tony wanted to squirm away as him and Steve had never been this close with someone else watching them before, but Steve wouldn’t budge as his grip on Tony’s waist and shoulder tighten. “Maybe some other time Peg..” Steve answered with a serious tone making the other nod and turn around.

With a weak sight the omega tried to speak reassuringly at the four arguing avengers.
“Us?”
When Tony had found him on that alley way he was a small weak pathetic thing that never trusted anyone. Everyone had tried to hurt him. Tried to trick him into thinking they wouldn’t hurt him before throwing things at him, laughing when he’d stumble to the ground. After that He had learned to stay away and fight off any human who would dare get near him...Until Tony had found him. Steve had been ready to fight him when all of a sudden Tony had Smiled warmly and offered him food..food, when everyone else had thrown rocks and garbage at him. Tony had offered him a delicious freshly baked muffin, something Steve hadn’t tasted in a long time. After that Tony had offered him more than he could ever imagine, he had offered Steve a home..and his love..even if it wasn’t the same kind of love Steve had been feeling for the past few months. Tony had offered him the one thing Steve had thought he would never get.  And Steve would be damned if it would ever be taken away from him...but would it? Would Thor take away Tony’s love for him? What if Tony would love Thor more than he loved Steve?
I know, i know it was supposed to be just till chap two but then stuff happen so the story is till chapter 3 🙃
“Because it was too hot!”
Thank you so much for reading this short little sweet fic that i wrote within three or four days...this was just pure fluff and so fun to write!
It was one of those nights where Steve had Tony mostly to himself since Pepper was never present for these events. So Steve had made it his mission to always sit right next to Tony whenever it was time to start.
Steve pouted as he glanced every now and then at his master who was busy twirling his fingers around blond hair. Long blond hair, that wasn’t his. The hybrid had stumbled back into the brunette’s lap again when Tony had sat down. Steve stiffened at the sight and wanted to pull the hybrid away and snuggle next to HIS master. But Tony had told him to share and behave himself. The look Tony had given him was enough to make the hybrid want to hide and cry. Tony had looked so disappointed in him, and he had never  once made Tony feel that way about him. It was all that stupid Thor’s fault. If he would just stop clinging to Tony like he was Tony’s hybrid, Steve wouldn’t be so pissed off.
Soon..he promised with a grin..soon.
A smile crossed his face when he had bent down to pick the tiny omega up, lifting the brunette gently onto his chest. Blushing a bit when Tony didn’t seem to mind and even snuggled closer against his chest. He quicken his steps as he watched the sun start to set. By nightfall a new village protector would arrive to take his place. And he would be an instant threat to the other as he had no bond to the village anymore.
“I SAID I…” more loud music…And Tony just had had enough of that and instantly wrapped his arms around the tall blond’s neck. Swinging lightly before being held in place. Leaning in closer as best as he could.
However with Tony right now he couldn’t wait to go in and kiss him like how those girls and guys had tried kissing him, Tony seemed pretty eager as well but only because he thought he thought that this was practice for the real thing. Would he even consider this his first real kiss? Before Steve could go any further with what he was thinking he had suddenly placed both his hands around Tony’s face, loving how soft the smaller teen’s skin felt. He could feel Tony tremble a bit but didn’t make any move to get away as he simply smiled nervously at Steve who also smiled nervously at him. “Okay...so...I’m going to lean in now okay?” Steve said as he hesitantly began to lean in, Tony nodded at that as he leaned into Steve as well.
That’s why during the summer he had made it his mission to be more outspoken, more straightforward because heck even if he didn’t look like an alpha, didn’t mean he couldn’t act like one. Who knows maybe some of the alpha’s might back off of him if he started talking like them. Then Steve wouldn’t get so upset whenever he’d catch them bullying him. So that was that, tomorrow He’d be the alpha Steve truly deserved. Oh he couldn’t wait to show his tiny yet feisty omega what an alpha he could be for him tomorrow. He inwardly smiled as he finished drinking his milkshake. While the others started throwing fries at Clint.
———————————————————
A vain was about to pop on the blond omega’s head as he scowled at an alpha who had suddenly blocked his view of Tony who was waiting for him at the bleachers. Tony hadn’t seen him yet and Steve had wanted to surprise him with a kiss when an over self-confident alpha had suddenly appeared right in front of him. The blond omega immediately scowled at the obnoxious looking alpha. Steve really didn’t have time to explain to the knot-head that he wasn’t interested. Especially since Steve knew the Alpha could smell Tony’s scent on him. “Your in my way...MOVE! Now!” he barked as the Alpha stupidly replied a ‘aw com’ on sugar...you know i can show you a better time than that alpha you go-arck!” The alpha couldn’t even finish his sentence as Steve had knocked his windpipes out of him.
Tony groaned as he stretched his tired arms over his head, as he sat at his office desk. It had been a long stressful week with all the missions and paperworks pepper had push onto him. Thankfully Steve had had his back through it all. It was nice having an omega around. Especially since that omega was a supersoldier that didn’t seem to get tired of attending to everyone at Stark’s tower.
A low growl escaped the tired alpha as he let the omega continue what he was doing. Steve couldn’t help to smirk as he heard the evelator door open.
Tony spread out on his office chair with half his shirt undone. While Steve was gently sliding his hands in and out of it. There was a flush on her boyfriends face while Steve grinned at her.
(See the end of the chapter for
Before he entered the dark forest, he stopped to give his new mate a chance to say goodbye to his old life as they would now begin their new one together in his lands. Tony merely glanced at the now distant village before glancing up at the larger creature carrying him. Smiling and nodding that he was ready to leave his old home behind. Steve smiled at that, bending his neck a bit to lean down and give his new mate a kiss, loving how his tiny mate leaned in to it. It was just a quick kiss. But enough to reassure him that Tony  was taking all this well. And a wide grin on his blushing face. Steve finally sprinted into the forest, ready to start his and Tony’s new life together as human and beast.
Right now though there was no point in hiding what he was feeling as he continued pressing his dick harder and faster against the sleeping brunette. Moaning and gasping as he smelled Tony’s arousal ger stronger.
