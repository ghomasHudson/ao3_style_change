As he walked into the lab and there was no lilting British voice to greet him, he was unnerved. It was bad enough that there was no sign of the team, but there hasn’t been time since he created JARVIS shortly after graduating from MIT that the AI hasn’t been there. He only time he was ever so thoroughly silenced was when Obi-
Tony got sick of the pleasantries. They had a long drive back to the tower and he was eager to put whatever was going on behind him and climb into bed with his favorite, soft space heater. He was also wanted to find out what the hell was going on with this woman who set off all his warning bells despite never having met her before. The agent herself wasn’t threatening- he didn’t expect her to outright attack him. But there was something about seeing her that made him feel like he was in danger. It didn’t make sense. He was honestly ok with taking the tech back to the tower and pissing off the agent, but there was something needling at the back of his mind. Like there was something he forgot, but with his eidetic memory forgetting things wasn’t something that happened often. It was REALLY starting to bother him and he was beginning to think that maybe Nick Fury had the answer, if the order to keep them apart was any indication. “What gives, Fury? I’m finally trying to play well with others and you’re kicking kids out of the sand box. That’s not very team player of you.”
Coulson sighed. “No, it isn’t. I’m asking as your friend, Steve.”
For the first time in his life, he was utterly alone. From the day he was born until he was in college, he had Edwin Jarvis- a man who was more of a father to him than his actual father. In college, he met Rhodey who supported him when his parents died and then again when he was devastated by the loss of Jarvis’ wife, Anna, and then Jarvis himself. After Rhodey, he hired Happy, then Pepper. Then came the Avengers and Steve. He’s had periods where one or some or most were mad at him, but there was always at least one person in his corner. In Afghanistan, he had Yinsen, which wasn’t quite the same, but still a solid presence backing him up and he knew that out there, somewhere, his friends were looking for him.
Today was a day of firsts for Tony in regards to Steven Grant Rogers. Earlier, for the first time in his life, he feared him. Now, for the first time, he loathed him.
“Steve, stop-“
“JARVIS may have proof. JARVIS?”
The silence on the other end of the line was deafening. Fury seemed to recovery quickly enough, though. “I’m guessing we’re talking about Angela Serafin.”
With Tony asleep and wrapped in his arms, Steve slowly stood up, trying his best not to jostle him as he walked from the bathroom back into their bedroom. He gently set the sleeping man amongst the sheets and blankets, pulling them over top of him to keep him warm, then made his way to the closet to pull out some underwear and pajama pants for himself. He debated also grabbing a pair for Tony and attempting to dress him but he didn’t want to run the risk of waking him and possibly triggering another attack.
Tony finally turned his attention from the end of the hallway and gave his science bro what he hoped was a reassuring smile, though it felt more like a grimace.
“Did something happen to you? Did someone hurt you?”
Steve winced. “You don’t remember?”
“You now have 5 text messages and 1 voicemail from Director Coulson, Sir.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony made a noise that could be best described as a “squee” and gave a slight shake of both his fists that was more than a little reminiscent of a gesture a teenage girl would make after finding out that Justin Bieber was coming to their town for a concert- though he would fervently deny it if ever accused of doing it. “Road trip with my favorite people!? Fantastic! I’ll text Happy and cancel the car. He’ll be, well, happy, that he doesn’t have to miss this week’s episode of ‘Downton Abby.’ But first, coffee.”
“No promises,” Tony replied with a smirk, which earned him an eye-roll in return. Before the door closed behind Steve as he stepped into the “library”, Tony hollered “be sure to check out ‘Hogwarts: A History’ for a bit a light reading!” Tony didn’t get to hear the fond, exasperated sigh that came from his team leader.
“-that your obvious attempts to change your image was just you grasping at straws and some semblance of good PR. The ‘Merchant of Death’ was a good moniker for you- all you do is leave a trail of bodies and broken hearts in your wake.”
A tiny nod of his head was the only sign he showed JARVIS’ camera that he’d heard him (Steve was always mildly disturbed by a camera in the bathroom) before his shaky legs gave out from underneath him and collapsed to the floor, not noticing that his left pinky finger had been hooked into the strap of his shaving kit and toppling it off the counter with the rest of him. At first bracing himself with his arms behind him, the pain in his right arm brought him back to himself slightly and he let his body go all in, splaying his arms out to his sides letting his head hit the floor with a small thump. The small, fleeting thought that he was grateful his bathroom was large enough to allow him to starfish in the middle of it passed through his mind and was gone just as quickly. The buzzing in his ears eased up slightly since his heart no longer had to fight gravity to get blood to his brain. The cool tile felt good on his back, colder on his neck where a stress sweat had accumulated.
“What? Tony, just answer my damn question!”
“Mute.”
Unfortunately, it’s already been established that his curiosity would be the death of him and he couldn’t resist picking up his phone to check the message.
Tony ignored the dig and closed his eyes in ecstasy as he took another bite. “You’re so good to me.”
Tony balked. “Is that necessary? I’m coming quietly.”
She arched an eyebrow at him. “You’re under arrest for murder of an agent, Stark. Probably the only reason you haven’t been beaten bloody is because you’re Iron Man and have an impressive posse.”
Silence reigned for a moment. “Sir, if I may ask, what IS happening? You have injuries I cannot account for and the information I’ve accessed from the S.H.I.E.L.D. database suggests unusual circumstances surrounding Doctor Serafin’s death.”
Ever since that day at SHIELD, Tony has been acting
Tony heaved a put-upon sigh and raised his right hand as though about to take an oath. “Fine. I, Anthony Edward Stark, do solemnly swear to be on my best behavior and to make an honest effort to not anger the She-Devil.”
Italics are dream sequences and phone conversations. It's easy to tell which is which.
The others nodded their acquiescence and Bruce said, “I’ll be sure to make plenty so you can have your fill when you’re finished.”
“Christ, they seriously already have me pegged as the murderer, don’t they? I’m surprised they’re even bothering with an investigation. I’m a dead man. They clearly have no fucking clue what actually happened to her. What’s,” he swallowed, bracing himself to admit it, “what’s happening to me.”
“We don’t have 9 minutes…”
JARVIS had been monitoring the conversation and chimed in. “Sir, I strongly recommend you don’t do this. Captain Rogers will not be pleased and you promised to join everyone for dinner. You have approximately three minutes to message back to decline her invitation and get your ‘iron tush’ to the dinner table.”
The agents looked unimpressed.
Two minutes later, the door opened revealing Coulson who gestured for them to come inside. Tony began to sweat- Agent Serafin apparently got her wish to confront him.
There was a tense silence. Tony interrupted it by asking, “Why don’t you ask him?”
“She was crying, bawling actually. I’ve never heard her so upset, I thought I’d be telling my superiors I’d be leaving to go home for a funeral before I finally got her calm enough to tell me what happened.” Rhodey’s voice was calm and collected, but with an undercurrent of rage like it took all of his self-control to not tear into Tony like he obviously wanted to.
“Coulson activated it? Oh, I will SO sue him and his damn shady agency over this.” Tony made his way back to the kitchen and leaned against the counter again, this time needing support for a different reason. He pinched the bridge of his nose and closed his eyes. “We aren’t even associated with them anymore!”
Tony gripped his mug a little tighter but angled his chair to convey to Steve that he was listening. He owed him that much since he’d at least been kind enough to give Tony some time to recover his wits before bringing it up. See, he could be a mature adult when he tried. And Steve made him want to try.
“It’s true,” Steve grunted, as he reached farther over the consul to reach the locking mechanism on the door. “I’ve also seen him struggle with lids to medicine bottles.”
----------
Steve wasn’t buying it and looked to Bruce, who just shrugged. Obviously, Bruce knew about what had happened earlier, but he couldn’t figure out why it would upset his friend so badly.
He left a stunned room in his wake.
Tony dug around in the corner cabinet looking for a suitable replacement to the Iron Man mug that sat abandoned in the lab. Ravishing Steve was about the only activity that could distract him so thoroughly that he forgot about his morning coffee. He was about to place the Stark Industries cup onto the counter when the words that came out of Bruce’s mouth next almost made him drop it.
Wrenching open the fridge door with way more force than was necessary and then leaning almost his entire body weight on it, he reached for the nearest sugary beverage- Steve’s orange juice. He unscrewed the top then collapsed on the floor, drinking straight from the carton. Again, he had a fleeting thought that Steve would disapprove of his behavior but instead of worry his pretty little head about it, he leaned against the cabinets that made up the kitchen island and, with the lip of the carton still against his lips, threw the middle finger of his battered right arm at the front door which was the only sense of his former fiancé’s direction he could muster.
“The thought crossed my mind,” Coulson replied.
“ETA?”
“She told you what happened, huh? She was there? She knows EXACTLY what happened? That’s fantastic, maybe she can tell me. She can blow this murder investigation WIDE OPEN, case closed, call Coulson.”
When he didn’t deserve it, like right now, it just made him angry.
Tony’s mouth opened and closed. Then opened and closed again. “Still not following.”
Tony slowly stood from his kneeled position on the floor, realizing he still held the damn carton of orange juice. He hurled it at the door, but given that it was empty it didn’t give him a tiniest bit of satisfaction. It also didn’t help that, while the OJ helped with the light-headedness from the blood-loss, it did nothing to wipe the sluggishness he felt throughout his body and the throw barely made the carton clear the kitchen area. He rubbed his eyes, hoping the adrenaline from the danger he felt from being helpless without his suits would reinvigorate him but the sleepless nights were catching up with him. He used to be able to go longer and harder than this, especially during his college days. He would go whole semesters with only a few winks every other night while he worked day and night completing projects and theses, fueled only by Ritalin, coffee, and his desire to prove his worth to his father. When he was desperate, he’d find a dealer and snort some cocaine though that usually only had the effects of making his writing even more illegible and upsetting Rhodey.
Tony mentally ran away from that thought as fast as his neurons could carry him and promptly made his way over to the computer that had access to JARVIS’ mainframe to get to work. After 20 mins, his trusty companion was back in working order.
Steve’s other hand came up to cup his face. “The reaction you had last night. It seemed like a flashback. Did someone force themselves on you?”
He reached for the hand Tony still held to his chest and whispered,
“What Bruce, you don’t want to have to explain to the God of Thunder the wonder of the human colon?” Tony was clutching a cup of coffee that Steve had poured for him to his chest, breathing in the delicious, aromatic steam but not quite seeming to relax.
“You know it, J. Take us to bed.”
“JARVIS, my floor. Now.” When the doors opened to Bruce’s floor, he practically sprinted out of the elevator and to his bedroom.
Coulson heaved a long-suffering sigh and pinched the bridge of his nose. “Give me a minute.” Then he swiped his badge, got the little green light, and disappeared inside the lab.
“Andorra, Estonia, Sokovia, and Moldova are looking the most promising.”
“We’re losing him…”
Tony turned back to Steve, the heat that he’d leveled at Clint not dissipating at all. “NOT. GONNA. HAPPEN. End of discussion.”
“Now THAT I could get sick of. In fact I’m already sick of it. Horribly sick, it may be contagious. You might’ve caught it. Oh, no. You’re sick, can’t go in to work today.”
“Coulson does. You said it yourself, her notes on the project are impressive and Bruce told me how competent her work seems to be. You were willing to work with her before.”
Tony was getting ready to protest the interruption and reaching for the screwdriver in Steve’s hand when his stomach loudly rumbled. He stopped and sighed. “Betrayed by my own body. What’d you bring me?”
“No, Sir. I was watching you the entire time and never saw anything happen that would explain your injury.”
Tony clasped his chest in fake hurt as he struggled to unbuckle his belt while still in a sleepy haze. “You wound me, Bruce. Oh ye of little faith, I’ll get you back.”
It took a few minutes, but eventually his breathing evened out and he removed his hands from his eyes. A soft, high-pitched whirring noise to his right told him DUM-E was hovering nearby, worried about his creator. Tony patted the nearest strut, murmuring “Good boy.” DUM-E rolled closer, opening and closing his tri-fingered claw, and reached out to execute what could best be described as an affectionate nuzzle at Tony’s temple and hairline. “I’m okay, buddy.” Tony gave another pat to calm the bot. “Why don’t you make me some more coffee? You did a good job with that this morning. Daddy’s gonna get back to work.” The bot gave some happy whirs and beeps, twirled around in place, then made his way over to the kitchenette.
Clint literally slid off of his chair and was laying on the floor in hysterics by the point.
----------
Steve started in with a forceful, “Enough.”
He sneered. “Just like you made every effort to take down HYDRA just to have them spring up under your noses?” Cheater or not, Steve was incredibly angry on Tony’s behalf. "Why does the code even exist? What is it meant to be used for?"
Tony looked devastated as he took another step forward. “Please, you don’t understand. I was going to explain everything to you yesterday morning. I should’ve explained it sooner, but I-“ he shook his head, “I should have told you sooner, but SO MUCH has been going on and I didn’t understand it myself. I still don’t, but we could figure it out together if you just let me-“
Steve stood staring at the garbage shoot for a few moments after Tony left the room, his face a mixture of horror and anger. Clint jumped off of his perch and made his was over to him the same time Natasha did. Thor stood rooted at his spot near the fridge and Bruce was still seated at the table, his orange abandoned as he focused on calmly breathing- in through his nose, out through his mouth.
Convinced that Tony wasn’t going to give them any trouble and that the Avengers weren’t going to feel the need to attack to defend him, Hill and the four agents lowered and holstered their weapons. Once the agents were as unarmed as they were going to get, the Avengers relaxed slightly and lowered their own, Thor setting his hammer down with a loud, metallic THUD on the table.
As Steve’s mind wandered over the enigma that was his future husband, he didn’t notice the man himself wander in from the elevator and make his way over. Before he had a chance to react, he had a lap full of genius, who immediately hooked his hand around to the back of Steve’s neck and pulled him down for a kiss.
Steve shook his head and leaned back into the car over the driver seat and the consul to reach the latch and free Tony, who repaid him with a wet kiss to the cheek and a sickly sweet, “My hero!” Tony then reached for the handle, only to jar his hand and shoulder when the door wouldn’t budge due to lock still being engaged.
“You don’t get to talk right now. I’ve heard enough.” Steve gave a hollow laugh and shook his head. “You know, I actually WORRIED about you and whatever has been upsetting you lately, but now I know it was just your guilt. Apparently you DO have a conscience, you just choose not to listen to it and I’m done picking up the pieces from your bad decisions. I trusted my heart and look what it got me. I should’ve listened to everyone who told me otherwise, that I needed to be leery of you and your MAN-WHORE ways.” Steve spat out the word and Tony paled at the insult that had been slung at him since he was old enough to pitch a tent.
Tony knew he was in trouble and opened his mouth to speak. Before he could get a word out, Pepper interrupted him.
“What?” Apparently, he was still a little bit fuzzy.
----------
The AI may not tell Tony where he was, but he didn’t want to run the chance that he’d be able to find him on his own accord.
Tony rubbed his eyes one more time, then turned to his work station and waved his hands to open up the holographic displays showing the schematics of the control collars and the waffle iron-shaped remote he’d already input this morning. Pushing the unease that Agent Serafin brought out in him to the back of his mind, he did what he did best when confronted with emotions that he didn’t understand- he ignored them.
Steve reached over and put his hand on Tony’s knee. “I hate it when you talk about yourself like that, and I hate it even more to hear someone like Fury use anything like that against you. You’re not a ‘slut’ or a ‘man-whore’ and never were. I just wanted to let you know that NO ONE who’s worth their weight, especially me or anyone on this team or even Coulson and Hill, thinks of you like that.”
Tony finally spoke up, “since when has that stopped SHIELD?”
That left Ritalin, his old friend. Diagnosed with ADHD during the first wave of over-medicating children in the early 80s, Tony has always had a prescription handy since the tender age of 10 when his father finally convinced his mother that he was too old for his hyper-activity to be considered “cute” anymore. The recommended dosage had the desired effect of calming him while just a little bit more pushed him beyond his usual limits and made him almost manic. When he was in grade school, the school nurses insisted on only giving him the prescribed amount and Tony had hated it. It made him slow. Granted, his slow was still faster than all his peers, but Tony hated that he was forced to function at less than what he was capable of. He learned quickly how to hide the pill in his cheek, then spit it out when he left the nurses suite to stash away for an inventing bender. In college, he was left to his own devices and the pills were never used as prescribed again. He went through them quickly during his senior year but he also knew what doctors could be persuaded to call in early refills with a little bit of monetary incentive. He’s Tony Stark- not very many people could tell him no, especially when he was younger and gave absolutely zero fucks.
“What?” Tony pulled his arm away from his face and held it a few inches away so he could take a look at it. Now that his attention had been brought to it, there was no way he could miss the stinging pain and the blood that streamed from a very deep gash across his right forearm. “JARVIS, did DUM-E cut me? Accidentally, did he bump me while I was passed out?” He stood up quickly, ignoring the way his vision swam, and made his way to the lab bathroom.
Suddenly remembering his nightmare, he called out, “JARVIS?”
“Sir wishes to speak with you.”
Tony finally heaved himself into a sitting position and took stock of his right forearm. He’d pulled some of the superglued areas apart when he’d collapsed and it was bleeding again, though not nearly as bad as before. He reached ahead of him to the cabinet under the sink, opened the door and pulled out a clean washcloth, then reached to his left and grabbed the shaving kit. He managed to get his feet under him and using the sink to balance pulled himself up and turned the hot tap on, tossing the clean cloth under to get wet. He unzipped the kit and pulled out the bottle of Ritalin. Noting the expired date and the low quantity of pills, he filled a nearby glass with the still running water and popped two in his mouth before washing them down.
“You went to the diner first?” Coulson made a note in a file he brought in.
“Ah, yes. I was telling our comrades how comfortable I am in my room here at the tower since Stark so kindly decorated it to remind me of home and we were discussing-“
Steve was the first to move as he stood up to comfort Tony, who was very visibly upset by Fury labeling him a ‘man-whore.’ The hand on his shoulder that moved to pull him into a hug seemed to finally loosen Tony’s tongue as he started sputtering and muttering, “How dare he?” over and over.
A heated office meeting and a strange dream...
Tony smirked at him. “Who said anything about sleeping?” Then he pounced.
Bruce winced. “You said you were going to talk to him about it this morning before breakfast!”
They rode up the first few floors in tired silence before Tony smirked, turning to his fiancé and sidling up to him as seductively as he could manage in his half-asleep state. “You think getting it on in the elevator right now would be sufficient payback for his rude wake-up call? He woke me up, we give him nightmares, all’s fair.”
Coulson cut him off.
Tony swallowed and steeled himself. “I take it then she told you about the shit-storm here, then? The ridiculous accusations leveled against me-“
Tony released his bated breath and lay back down, rolling onto his back. He was going to give it a minute before he tried standing up. “Good to hear your voice. How long was I out?”
When the black, SHIELD issued sedan pulled up into the tower’s public garage at promptly 1:00, it wasn’t just Steve and Bruce waiting to “greet” Agent Serafin- they were also joined by two superspies and a Demi-God. Steve only allowed them to accompany them after wrangling out promises to behave that were similar to the one he’d managed from Tony, though in all honestly he probably wouldn’t have been able to stop them. Clint would’ve just lurked in the vents with an arrow notched in his bow, Natasha would undoubtedly be near enough to deliver crippling blows even if she wasn’t seen, and Thor was actually a good match for Steve, brute strength-wise.
There's a reason I went into so much detail with the in-between. It's important in later chapters and since it isn't canon (that I know of, though I wouldn't be surprised if Tony had more access points to the workshop than what we see in the MCU) I felt it needed to be described.
Tony froze. “He wouldn’t.” Willing his body to move so he could sink to his knees before he fell over, Tony lowered himself to the floor. “He doesn’t even had the code, only Coulson-.”
Tony was left in the back of one of the SHIELD vehicles with one of the unnamed agents for what felt like forever. Tony assumed Coulson, Hill, and the other three agents had gone with Steve up to their penthouse to retrieve the clothing Tony had worn last night. They didn’t have a warrant but Tony had given his permission and so they didn’t need one. Anyway, he was sure Coulson would’ve found a way to get away with improper search and seizure so there was no need fighting it. He was a little upset when he saw a tow truck pull into the tower parking garage and then come out with his beloved orange Audi about 10 minutes later. He turned to the agent who was left to babysit him and growled, “There better not be even a nick on her when I get her back.” The agent didn’t bother to respond, but did give a smirk. Tony suspected that if the agent had his way, his beloved car would be smashed with a wrecking ball. SHIELD didn’t like Tony on a good day, and this definitely wasn’t a good day.
Tony saw Steve tense beside him. He whipped his head back and forth once or twice between the man at the island and the one at the stove before finally grounding out, “What!?”
“Oh, my God. What did I just do?” Steve brought his hands up to his face and slumped against the island.
Text messages are in
Tony’s meandering thoughts on his coming nuptials were cut short with the slam of the back hatch and the opening of one of the side doors as Bruce climbed in, rubbing his hands together to warm them. Tony felt a bit bad that he hadn’t helped load, but the tremor he felt in his hands that had nothing to do with the cold, reminded him of why handling irreplaceable alien technology in his current state was a bad idea. He glanced back at Bruce to apologize for his lack of assistance, but the sorry smile Bruce gave him as he turned around made the words die on his throat. He nodded and went back to staring out the window at Steve and Coulson, who’d been joined by Hill. Judging by how everyone was starting to angle their feet away from each other told Tony the conversation was winding down and Steve would be joining them shortly to start the long, awkward ride home. He loved Steve, but he had this annoying habit of wanting to talk about feelings, usually when it was the last thing that Tony wanted. He’d gotten better over the years, since Pepper. He often blamed his inability to maintain that relationship on his desire to not talk about things. Granted, the fact that the poor woman- a very squishy, normal human being, NOT a hardy super soldier- kept getting put into harm’s way simply by association with Tony, with IRON MAN, was most definitely another one of the very big nails in the coffin of that relationship.
“What happened!?”
“That wasn’t quite what I meant.”
“Blame your honey. We we’re discussing interior decorating before you two came in,” Clint said around another mouthful.
Steve was wild with need after only a few minutes, wanting to return all the love and attention that Tony was giving him. He wrapped his arms around his lover and flipped him onto his back. He reached for his hands and pinned them gently above his head as he started kissing down his neck, over his collar bone and down his chest, going further and further south.
When the flow of blood from his arm finally stopped, Tony tossed the red (formerly white) towel on the floor near the small shower stall. Well, small by Tony Stark standards, but larger than those found in most homes. His mind not having caught up his heart, he thought for a moment that Steve would get huffy if he found the discarded towel on the floor. He started to pick it up, then remembered that Steve no longer gave a damn what the state of his lab bathroom was and dropped it again out of spite. Steve doesn’t care that there’s a towel on the floor and he certainly wouldn’t care that it was covered in such a vital body fluid as his former fiancée’s blood. A lot of blood, actually, Tony realized as he swayed a bit on his feet and grabbed onto the lip of the sink for support. His gaze travelled down to where his hands clung to the edge with a white knuckled grip, his eyes catching on the lighter band of skin where there used to a ring blocking the sunlight from darkening it to an even more olive hue.
Tony stopped halfway in his tracks, recognition making its way slowly to his brain. He knew that voice. That voice meant safety and warmth. He whirled back to look at where he had come from, still expecting to see an attacker. Or a birthmark. But instead he saw only Steve kneeling in the middle of the bed with blankets, sheets, and a random bath towel pooling near his knees and the pillows strewn every which way- the one from Tony’s side tilted halfway off the mattress and grazing the floor. The half-dressed blonde was holding his hands up in a placating manner. There was a slight trickle of blood coming from his nose that looked to already have stopped before reaching the cupid’s bow above his upper lip. Tony took in the scene in front of him, his quick mind putting the pieces together despite the haze of the nightmare lingering in his mind, and he took a step back in horror.
Her cocky façade only cracked a smidge when Thor let loose another booming laugh and clapped one of his massive hands on her much smaller shoulder, actually making her crumple slightly to the affected side. “You have been bested in battle, Hawkeye. To the victor goes the spoils.”
Comments and Kudos give me life and motivation! *cough*hint*cough*
“You don’t know that! None of you know that for sure!” Bruce stood up, waving his hands frantically as though he wanted to slap them all.
Upon entering his old home, he went straight for the bathroom and began tearing apart the under-sink cabinet. He was rewarded with a bar of Irish Spring that had fallen to the back. As he started the water and began to undress, he called out, “JARVIS, lock down my floor.”
Hill was unmoved. “What about a lawyer? I’m sure you have a whole team on retainer.”
Tony gasped trying to suck air into his lungs for the second time that day. The suits were his ONLY protection. Against the Ten Rings, against Obi, Vanko, against the Chitauri- oh, god, what if they came back? What if they came back and he couldn’t- he wouldn’t be able to- oh god. The Mandarin. He gave the Mandarin his address, what if he blew up his home again? No one would protect him-
----------
Now it was Tony’s turn to stare. They wanted a rise out of him and he wasn’t going to give them one. Of course Steve was upset, Tony know he would be when he found out that he’d lied about where he was going and who he was meeting. But he was confident that when he explained everything to him- the dreams and Angela’s connection to them- that Steve would calm down. Things might be tense for awhile, but their relationship was strong enough that Tony believed they would work it out.
The scientist was an average looking but pretty woman about his age, if the slightly greying in her hair and faint hints of frown lines were any indication. She wore kitten heels, a skirt, and a lab coat over a button down blouse- though Tony wasn’t about to discount her fighting abilities based on her attire. He’d seen Natasha take down men twice her size with graceful maneuvers while dressed in much more constricting clothes and sky-high stilettos; however that could’ve been more of a Natasha thing than a SHIELD agent thing. The lab coat was form fitting enough on her thin figure that he should’ve been able to see any suspicious gun-shaped lumps, but there were none. While that didn’t mean she wasn’t armed, it did mean he stood a greater chance of her needing to be within arms-reach to do any actual damage. He noticed her loosely pulled up mousy, brown hair and slightly down-turned green eyes that burned bright with fury much like Bruce’s when he’s struggling to keep Jolly Green from making an appearance. A light spattering of freckles across her cheeks and birthmark across the bridge of her nose-
“Of course, no one manages to hide food in MY tower- I know where all the best hiding places are.”
“Of course, Sir.” A beat of silence. “Sir, may I point out that you left the workshop door to the in-between open?”
“They’ve ALL already decided. These four are actually the least biased of the most qualified we have. Steve, it looks bad for him. We haven’t received the results of our forensic and DNA testing, but if ANY of it comes back incriminating it won’t bode well for him. I need your cooperation. For Tony’s sake AND to get justice for Agent Serafin. She deserves that much.”
Fortunately, Nat and Clint’s history with SHIELD left them with a lot of respect for Coulson, who they wouldn’t want to disappoint by acting up, and Thor could be expected to be respectful of a “lady” and fellow “sister-in-arms.”
Clint lost it.
“The part that implied I didn’t need to take it from other people. This is more fun. Consider it training, I’m practicing my stealth.”
Coulson waited patiently on the line while Steve brought up the screen as directed. When he got to the text box, he hesitated. Once he did this, there was no going back. He thought of Tony and his attachment to his suits. They made him feel safe. Steve used to invoke that same feeling, but he wouldn’t have that anymore, either. But they needed Tony to behave to get this mess cleaned up. He felt another twinge of guilt at disrespecting Agent Serafin’s memory by referring to catching her killer as a ‘mess,’ but he brushed it off. He needed to worry about the living. Even if Tony was no longer his fiancé, he was still a teammate. With a heavy heart, he typed in the code and hit 'enter.' "Ok, it's done."
“If it makes you feel any better, Nat, Clint and Thor are just as angry as we are after we filled them in on the situation. If Agent Satan makes even the slightest distasteful remark about you, she has a team of angry and protective Avengers who’ll shut her down in a heartbeat. I’d also recommend to Fury that he make no attempt to join us for any meals or movie nights in the near-future.”
The rest of the meeting was a blur of voices discussing things that Tony couldn’t be bothered with now that he had his “job” to do, which was figuring out exactly what the hell the HYDRA goons had been trying to build. Funnily enough, it did look remarkably like a very large waffle iron but judging from the shotty photos (seriously, couldn’t SHIELD hire a decent photographer or at least use a StarkPhone to take the pics, it looked like they used a Nokia) the exposed circuitry looked more like something geared towards controlling smaller devices. Before the meeting even ended, Bruce and Tony had both come to the conclusion that it warranted a closer inspection and they wouldn’t be able to decipher what it was supposed to control without seeing the rest of the recovered tech.
“Of course I have, Sir. From the moment you were arrested, I’ve been monitoring all intelligence gathered involving you, Doctor Serafin, and the investigation for evidence proving your innocence.”
“Always a pleasure hearing from you, Phil,” Fury cut him off again and hung up.
“That would be the exact opposite of what I just said.” The AI paused. “Sir, your arm!”
Steve chuckled and looked around at the table tops that were covered with very alien-looking pieces. “I take it you don’t need the team’s help unloading, then?”
Stealing food from Bruce was a safer bet, so Tony snurched a piece of cantaloupe from his bowl instead.

“Steve.” Coulson got up and locked the door then returned to his seat. “You didn’t see what we saw. We aren’t talking a dainty strangulation here, this was bloody and brutal.” Steve was about to open his mouth again, when Coulson held up a hand silencing him. “It isn’t something I’d think Tony Stark capable of. I don’t think he’s capable of ‘clean’ murder either. Whoever did this to her was hate-filled and vicious- unhinged, even. But we have no other suspects and her fellow agents want to see justice. I do, too, but I’m not looking to nail an innocent man to the cross which is why I need you to work with me, here. Despite his, well, personal failings, Tony Stark doesn’t deserve to hang for a crime he didn’t commit.”
20 minutes later, Tony made his way from the penthouse to the common floor. JARVIS had already informed him that Steve wasn’t happy and he was about to make the poor guy’s mood worse.
Another rut had Steve growling again as his hands went from Tony’s hips to cup his ass, and in one swift movement he’d lifted and pulled him against his groin and chest, standing and kicking the chair out from underneath him. He made his way out of the lab and to the elevator, moans falling from his lips as Tony continued his ministrations on the tender skin under his jaw. He braced Tony against the back wall of the elevator and used the added leverage to grind against him, dragging a breath-y groan from his lover who dug his fingernails into his back in response. “JARVIS, ughn, God, penthouse,” he panted.
Tony spread his hands. “It’s the truth. Sorry it’s so anticlimactic.”
I'm re-editing this piece as well. No big changes to the story, just clarifying the timeline a bit by adding actual dates. I re-read the story in it's entirety and realized that some parts were a bit confusing ("did Angela die on the second day or the third day at tower?" for example. The answer is the third day.) I'm also changing the chapter titles for fun- it was an idea I had awhile ago, back when I first started this story and finally decided to go ahead and do it. Check them out if you'd like to see what I'm doing :) I'm posting this chapter first, so give it a few hours before looking at other chapter for changes.
Hill harrumphed and rolled her eyes, but she gestured to one of the cameras behind Tony. “Room service will be here shortly. Is there anything else we can get you to make your stay more pleasant? A fluffy robe, some slippers?”
“And yes, the interior design in mine and Steve’s suite is very pleasing to the eye.”
“Knowing you, it’s the same thing. Tony Stark doesn’t meet a woman in her motel room and not have sex with her.” Coulson delivered the last line with a cold stare.
Tony placed another kiss on Steve’s cheek before FINALLY climbing out of the car that all of sudden seemed to spite him. He gestured to the back and said, “Leave it. This is our private garage, it’s secure. We can recruit the rest of the troops at a less ungodly hour to help.”
Director Coulson- not Phil, not right now- sat in the chair next to him and crossed his ankle over the opposing knee in an open posture. He meant to be as non-threatening as possible but it wasn’t working. Steve was on edge and Coulson knew it.
Clint rolled his eyes. “Yes, Mom.”
Tony moved towards him, turning his back on the rest of the room. “Steve, I need to talk to you! It’s not true. I wouldn’t cheat on you! Baby, please-“
Tony sat cross-legged on the floor of the penthouse kitchen, clutching the newly-emptied carton of OJ like his life depended on it, when the tell-tale sound of helicopter blades whirring past the windows and away from the tower caught his attention. With a groan, he grabbed the edge of the counter in front of him with his good arm while he loosely held the carton in his right and heaved himself into a standing position, pleased that his vision didn’t swim. Wondering who had the audacity to ignore his protected airspace, he made his way to window just in time to recognize the unmarked SHIELD helicopter before it turned it tail towards the tower and made its way back to D.C.
He finished up shaving his van dyke into its usual neatness, brushed his teeth and checked again in the mirror to make sure he was presentable. He couldn’t do much about his pallor or the bags under his eyes unless he wanted to mess around with the makeup he used before public functions to cover up his weariness or the occasional cut or bruise from a battle. Deciding he didn’t want to waste more time and hoping that his pitiful state might help his case that he needed to meet with Dr. Serafin in order to rectify the nightmares he was having, Tony instructed JARVIS to turn off the lights and he made his way down to the communal kitchen.
Tony seemed to sense the presence of his favorite beverage from his favorite café and looked up from his work. “Brucie-Bear! You brought me coffee! This is why you’re my favorite.” He was grabbing the cup out of the carrier before Bruce had a chance to set it down on the table. He brought the cup to his lips and took a sip, then swallowed, smacked his lips together and went, “Ahhhhhhhh!”
- cocaine wasn’t exactly something he kept stocked anymore and leaving the Tower to purchase narcotics probably wouldn’t look good given that he’s currently a suspect in a murder investigation (and a (suspended)superhero, though apparently no one was ever fooled into thinking he was actually worth that label), and
Steve wrinkled his nose at the mental image, but instead of expressing his disgust he pulled up another rolling chair and sat within arms-reach of Tony. This did not bode well. Sure enough…
Bruce took the lead with the science talk since Tony remained silent. “We believe they’re control collars, meant to contain enhanced individuals. Which means HYDRA could be illegally experimenting on people to create more enhanced. It could also be that they’re meant to contain enhanced threats against HYDRA, such as you and me. Agent Serafin may have the most experience with these devices, but Tony and I have the most experience reverse engineering Chitauri tech which is the basis of these devices. Not to mention, that while I trust Coulson and Hill, I don’t think I feel comfortable leaving control collars meant to restrain people like ME with an agency that had a pest problem with HYDRA in the recent past.”
“I’m sorry, Mr. Stark, I didn’t mean to waste your time in coming here. It appears there’s been a bit of a mix up and your lab clearance has been revoked. Give us a day or two and we’ll see what we can do. In the meantime, Dr. Banner is more than welcome to accompany me inside and he can get started-“
“I want to talk about yesterday.”
That made the decision a lot easier. “Take me to my floor. My OLD floor. And don’t tell Tony where I am.”
A few minutes past 6:00, Tony was still hunched over his workstation when JARVIS spoke up.
No one else on the team made an attempt to shake her hand, though both Bruce and Thor gave curt nods in greeting. Steve made a mental note that if ever he needed someone other than Bruce or JARVIS to interact with her, Thor would be the best bet.
“Wait, you’re coming too?”
Tony wants to tell Steve what's been going on, but things go downhill before he get's a chance to.
Ok, so I'm starting to realize that this story is going to be alot longer than I initially thought. Not that that's a bad thing, but it does mean that it's taking a bit longer to get to the actual "horror" part of the story than I initially planned.
“Thank, God. I need sleep,” Bruce mumbled as he made his way to elevator.
Tony hesitated. He hated lying to Steve. “You’re gonna hate me. Pepper called, she was livid. I completely forgot I have a dinner with some investors at 6:15 at Casa Negro. I’m obviously running REALLY late and have to run.” He was already walking backwards, towards the elevator, hoping Steve didn’t see the tell-tale cold sweat that had broken out across his brow. “I’m sorry, Sweetheart, really. It smells delicious and I’m jealous. I’ll make it up to you. Tomorrow. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner. All family affairs, I’ll be up for every meal. Promise. I love you!” The door closed before Steve could reply and as Tony rode the elevator car down to the garage, he ran a shaking hand across his forehead to mop up the sweat. Eh, this jacket needed to go to the cleaners anyway.
“I’m afraid it wasn’t Coulson who activated it, Sir.”
Steve, relatively defenseless, moved entirely in front of Tony and raised his fists as though they could stop bullets. Tony grew horrified and moved around Steve, stepping forward with his hands raised. He was not about to let his fiancé get killed in their own kitchen by their supposed allies without even knowing what the hell was going on.
A sign of things to come...
We're getting close to revealing the baddie- not yet though. Possibly by chapter 13. Btw, I've come to the conclusion that this is gonna be a really long story. Buckle up kiddos.
“I think you had a different desire.”
Eventually, Coulson and Hill entered and took seats on the opposite side of the table from him. Tony heaved a sigh of relief. “Never thought I’d be happy to see you two. I’m going stir crazy in here. Thought maybe you’d left me to rot.”
This was enough to set Agent Serafin off as she gave a dark laugh and arched her eyebrow with a high-pitched, “REALLY?” She huffed. “You’re really surprised by that? You kind of have a well-earned reputation, Stark.”
Tony shot up in his seat as he startled awake. Steve had his hand on his shoulder where he was gently shaking him, trying to wake him where he’d fallen asleep on the car ride home; however, instead of looking at Tony, he was sending a disdainful look at Bruce who was standing outside the Escalade with a sheepish look on his face.
Tony puttered around as he set about putting on another pot of coffee. “Just for that, Tweety Bird, no more bacon for you when Steve cooks up the next batch.”
“I brought you some lunch.”
“Not only did you cheat on your fiancé, who happens to be the BEST THING that has EVER happened to you, but you used me to do it.”
Coulson coughed again and he felt Bruce give a slight tug on his elbow. “Hey, Tony, are you alright?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve shook and his voice wavered as he choked out an anguished, “They fucking called it.” As a tear escaped and trailed down his cheek, Nat scooted closer and wiped it away for him, pulling his head down onto her shoulder and wrapping an arm around him.
Still no triggering content, though the dream sequences are starting to get a bit disturbing.
Bruce groaned and Natasha guffawed.
“I don’t give a flying FUCK if she resigns.”
“Please, Sir, don’t do this.”
“If we listen to it again, you might get sick of it and then we’re back to square one of annoying the DJ by not having our song list finished.”
----------
“Director Coulson gave it to him, Sir. I’m sorry.”
JARVIS began reciting calmly that Tony was in his lab, in the tower, and that he was safe. That it was 9:36am on Tuesday, January 30th. He continued listing facts about the present to help ground him and bring him back- the weather outside, where everyone in the tower was located, SI stock information, how many emails he had waiting for him, etc. It had become a routine that had started shortly after Tony flew a nuke through the wormhole and began having attacks. Being a bodiless AI, there was only so much JARVIS could do to aid him without summoning someone else.
Hill spoke up. “Is that what he told you? Because the video we have from the camera mounted in the hallway of Dr. Serafin’s motel clearly shows Stark entering her room with her and then leaving alone about an hour later.”
“Hmm? I’m fine, just chilly. This lab is freezing.” Tony leaned out of his embrace and began putting the items on the desk in some semblance of order to avoid looking Steve in the eye. He was a decent liar- had to be after a lifetime of hiding his real self from the soul-sucking media- but after all these years Steve knew his tells.
“I appreciate your professional courtesy,” Tony sneered, holding out his wrists. “Who says saving New York and the planet didn’t have its perks?”
There is no triggering content in this chapter.
“Pepper called me. Pepper never calls me when I’m away on a mission unless you’re presumed dead or dying.”
Natasha smiled wistfully and traced her friends’ faces with her delicate fingers. Then she frowned as she realized that Bruce was right. Even if the case against Tony fell apart and they found out he hadn’t cheated on Steve, things would never be the same. Not after today. Probably never again.
Hill looked incredulous. “That’s makes no sense, whatsoever. You’re a genius and that’s the best you can come up with?”
Bruce laughed even harder at the dramatic betrayal on Tony’s face.
Steve’s expression didn’t change.
Unfortunately, given Tony’s habit of flirting with everyone and everything simply for the sake of keeping up appearances and out of habit, most people who weren’t in Tony’s inner circle didn’t know that Tony was actually a very loyal lover.
Before he slipped into oblivion, his eyes alighted on and tried to focus on a lone, small figure standing a few feet in front of him. A boy, with chocolate soulful eyes and an unruly mess of tangled dark-brown curls, came a few steps forward then kneeled in front of him. The blue sweater he wore was embroidered with a logo that he couldn’t make out in his haze, the boy’s khaki shorts falling to just above his dirty, skinned knees. He brought a finger to his lips and went,
“Yes. Even though I could not communicate or carry out anything other than basic operations after I was hacked by Director Coulson and his team, I was still aware of the goings on in the tower. Agent Hill called approximately four hours ago to inform them that Miss Potts had posted your bail and that you should be returning this morning.”
“Right, because that ended SO WELL for you last time,” Natasha said, with a perfectly-groomed, arched eyebrow.
DUM-E was squealing nearby on his left, in obvious distress, his beeps as high pitched as Tony had ever heard them.
“Traitor,” Tony threw out, glancing up to the ceiling at one of JARVIS’ mounted cameras as he sipped his favorite beverage.
Steve just smiled and shook his head. He was used to having to repeat himself when Tony got himself into the science zone. As infuriating as it could be sometimes, it was also adorably endearing. “Coulson’s team recovered some maps from the HYDRA base, I want to take a look at them and see if they correlate with some routes that HYDRA had been known to take when moving equipment. Might help us narrow down the scepter’s location even quicker.”
Tony paled. “Steve, don’t. Just please, don’t. Don’t try to help.”
“They’ll get the gist, or at least Tony will. Trust me.”
“When DID you two discuss it? You both seem to know a lot more about this than I do.” There was no heat in his voice, just curiosity. He didn’t look up from the workstation.
Tony finally looked up, with a look of indignation on his face. “I most certainly do not drool. Or snore. Or bawl. I am the picture of relaxed elegance when I sleep, like a magazine spread for Sleep Number beds. Anyone who tells you otherwise is lying.”
“-61991.”
He sat in a horrible plastic chair that he was pretty sure doubled as a torture device as he was left with only his thoughts to occupy him. There was no two-way mirror but four cameras, one mounted in each corner- no blind spots. He knew SOMEONE was watching, so he tried asking a few times for a cup of coffee but no one ever came in to respond.
“You were unconscious for approximately 32 minutes. Had it not been for the protocol in place, I would have contacted Dr. Banner immediately. Your vitals were highly erratic the entire time and have been yet to go back to a normal level.”
Tony felt his eyes dry up as he went numb, the only sensation making its way into his brain was the pain in his chest and the tingling of his hands as he continued to stare down at the ring on the floor. He couldn’t breathe. The only sound in the room was Steve’s heavy pants that he forced the air through his nose, his mouth drawn into a tight line. After a few erratic beats of his breaking heart, Tony bent down to pick up the neglected piece of jewelry with a shaking hand- a symbol of his love that Steve had promised to never remove from his finger.
Steve immediately flushed and ducked his head further into the fridge where he pretended to look for the eggs that sat front and center on the top shelf.
“I need Bruce, now! Something’s wrong,” Steve said into the air, alternating between watching as he ran and glancing down at the limp body in his arms.
“Why does that bother you so much?” Coulson tilted his head, as though simply curious. You’d think they were discussing the weather and his nonchalance made Tony want to slap him. And people said HE was unfeeling.
Feeling utterly abandoned, Tony felt a pang for the one person he knew would never leave him. Rhodey had been through everything with Tony- every triumph, every failure, every heartbreak, and every fuckup. Even when Tony was at his worst, his best friend had been there for him holding his proverbial hair back or even his beer when Tony had been able to convince him to join in his shenanigans. For all of Rhodey’s claims that Tony had been the bad influence, he knew better and knew Rhodey had been on-board and encouraging for plenty of their misadventures. If there was anyone who would stand by him now, it would be James Rhodes. Tony started to feel safer already, imagining Rhodey in gleaming War Machine armor (he refused to call him Iron Patriot), standing sentinel in front of him, protecting him from even the might of the Avengers. He’d never TELL Rhodey that, knowing he’d be teased unmercifully for imagining him as a his literal knight in shining armor, but it still made him feel better.
When Steve finally spoke up, his voice was from hoarse with his emotions. “You didn’t see him that night. Everything about him was off. The desire to go to bed early. The guilt in his eyes. The panic attack-“ he cut himself off, struggling to continue.  He looked down at the mat, steeling himself. When he looked back up, his eyes were wet. “I was worried about him. I thought someone had hurt him. But it was just another manifestation of his guilt.”
“Ouch. Never mind, I take it back.” Tony tapped the spot where the reactor used to be, waiting for some sort of response. None was forthcoming as Coulson and Hill stared impassively at him. “So, obviously I’m here to tell you my side of the story. But could a guy get a cup of coffee first? At the rate we’re going, I have a feeling we’re gonna be here awhile.”
Tony gets a reaction that he wasn't expecting.
He closed his eyes and fisted his hands, willing the tears back. Steve had softened him. He used to be brash, tough as nails- “Stark men are made of iron,” Howard used to say. Tony never used to cry at the drop of a hat- or a ring. He survived a missile to the chest and capture in Afghanistan, an alien invasion, the destruction of his home while he’d still been in it. He survived his mentor and father-figure ripping his figurative heart out of his chest, poisoning by his own (accidental) design, Pepper walking away from him. He would survive this. He would survive Steve.
“Hey,” he tried to coo at him, but his voice was hoarse. He cleared his throat and tried again. “Hey, Buddy, I’m okay.” He reached out his left hand to him and DUM-E rolled forward. “Everything’s okay. Shhhh.” When the bot moved, Tony saw that a pile of equipment that had been knocked off the table was laying all over the floor. “Did you do that? Such a klutz. Careful or I’ll make good on my promise to donate you to community college.” There was no heat in his threat. He mostly said it to make DUM-E realize that he was fine. The little bot dipped his head and made a soft whir. “I know you’re sorry. You’re always sorry.” He started to pat one of the bots struts to calm him, but then pulled his hand back as he realized that it hurt to do so. He took a look at one hand and then the other, seeing that his palms were red and tender. Like they’d been mildly burned...
“Mute.”
Tony’s jaw dropped. “EXCUSE me!? How dare y-”
Natasha looked down at the bandage, then released Tony, throwing him back and making him stagger to regain his footing.
“She preferred Doctor, or Angela, and that’s simple, we were talking.”
Without another word, Tony stormed out of the kitchen, coffee forgotten.
For a minute nobody moved. Steve itching to go to Tony and Tony wanting nothing more than to run from the room. But he was naked. That needed to be remedied first. With a whirl of flailing limbs, Tony stood from the floor and moved over the dresser, pulling drawers with enough force to remove them entirely from the piece of furniture if it weren’t for the drawer stops keeping that from happening. He pulled on a pair of sweat pants, nearly falling over again but steadying himself on the dresser’s edge at the last moment. He pulled a ratty band t-shirt over his head and slipped a pair of loafers on while hobbling over to the door, steps unsteady because of his roiling emotions and the backs of the loafers not situated correctly on his heels.
“Great, now open up the in-between, I need to change real quick.”
The tension surrounding the lot was palpable as the object of their displeasure stepped out of the car and made her way towards them. Steve noticed that she looked just as tense as they felt and seemed tired, if the slightly-discolored circles under her eyes were anything to go by. He’d seen much the same look on Tony and Bruce’s faces many times before. Must be a science thing.
“Why’s that, Stark? I thought Cap blushing got you all hot and bothered.”
Laying on the floor of his bathroom, his world falling apart around him, that last thing he felt was any pride. He didn’t trust his body not to betray him, though, and stayed where he was.
Yes, the team would help Steve see reason and then Tony would be able to explain what was going on to him. He needed to be smelling decent when they kissed and made up.
“Because his reason was bullshit! There had to be more to it!”
Tony sat stone-faced in the front passenger seat of the Escalade they had driven in from the tower. While they’d normally take one his sports cars for a trip to SHIELD, they had agreed to drive one of the bigger vehicles since the photos they’d received this morning didn’t give much of an idea of the size of what they’d been hoping to be able to bring home with them. He liked to plan ahead when it came to the possibility of raiding SHIELD’s play things. Earlier, on the drive down to D.C., Tony had bemoaned the excessively spacious interior. He’d sat in the back with Bruce so they could continue going over the data and photos from Coulson on his StarkPad, but he’d loudly complained several times that Steve felt ‘too far away’ as he played chauffeur. It eventually grated on his companions nerves enough that Bruce had declared the end of science time after pulling over to hit Starbucks and had insisted Tony leave him alone in the back to get some sleep and Tony could finally sit in the front within hand-holding distance of Steve. Tony pouted at the declaration of no more science-ing but quickly melted as soon as Steve reached over with an open palm and a pout of his own.
Tony scowled. “I think we’re done here. I told you my side, and when the forensics come back I hope you feel like an ass.”
“Sit and enjoy your breakfast, I’ll make something for me and Tony,” Steve said, when he saw Bruce move to set down his tea.
“Why didn’t you call me? I’ve been home almost all day, Pepper’s the one who picked me up, I’ve sure she mentioned it. Why didn’t you call me?”
“Please don’t bring me into this, Dr. Banner.”
Tony heard Bruce let out a long-suffering sigh on his other side. Poor Brucie-Bear did that a lot when dealing with his science bro. “I knew they should’ve waited to send that info. You zoned out the entire second half of the meeting didn’t you?”
A vague, “Hm,” was all the response he got. He might be aware Steve was there, or at least that SOMEONE was there, but Tony’s mind was obviously still somewhere in Science Land. Honestly, Loki could’ve been sitting on Tony’s shoulders with knife pressed to his neck and he would still have been oblivious. With the tip of his tongue peeking out of the corner of his mouth, hair sticking up at all angles after roughly running his hand through too many times to count, oil stains spattering the well-fitting tank top and jeans, and smudges of grease on the side of his nose and all over his arms, Steve thought Tony always looked adorable like this. And remarkably attractive. Very, very attractive. Tony in his engineering element was a beautiful thing to behold. Steve has immortalized many scenes just like this in his sketch book, his favorites being any involving the Iron Man suit. He had an armor kink, so sue him.
“No, Nat. Let’s not sugarcoat it, okay? I was idiot to believe his lies, all of them. That he loved me, that he would never hurt me. What do you call this? I’m pretty fucking hurt. It was everyone else who told me otherwise that I should’ve listened to. The journalists, the TV show hosts- everyone who laughed when news broke of our engagement. They all said that Tony Stark was a playboy who couldn’t be tamed, that I was delusional if I believed that my pretty face and six-pack abs would keep Stark in our marital bed. That he’d tire of my old-timey ways and run off to find someone more his speed. I brushed them off and now look where we are. They called it.”
Time seemed to slow down at Tony watched the ring arc through the air, bounce off the spot on his chest that Steve had thrown it at and fall down to the floor. It rolled in an arc, first away from his feet then back towards him, bouncing off the toe of his shoe and then rotating in place, making a sickening sweet sound that rang as loud as church bells in Tony’s ear as it finally came to a stop, glinting in the sunlight. The glare from the sun right at Tony’s cornea made him blink, as his unshed tears made the reflection blind him completely.
“I always play nice.”
Tony cleared his throat. “Good afternoon.” No one looked up. He walked further into the room to the kitchen table and leaned his hip against it, letting his knuckles hang down on to the wood and give a light distracted rap. “So, yesterday sucked. How’s Steve?”
“For an ‘obvious’ answer, that was not helpful in the slightest.”
The room was silent. No one knew what to say. They’d all believed Tony would never cheat on Steve but the evidence that they’d seen so far was pretty irrefutable.
“Oh, yeah, and you did such a GOOD JOB reading Tony when you were spying on him a few years ago.” Natasha narrowed her eyes at him. “’Iron Man: yes. Tony Stark: Not Recommended.’ Remember that? We all took your assessment of him to heart and then we were all proven wrong when he risked his life to fly a nuke through a wormhole. You may be great at reading 99.99% of the people you come across, but you got Tony wrong then. Who’s to say you’re not wrong now?” Bruce ran a frustrated hand through his hair. “We have been proven wrong over and over again when it comes to making assumptions about him. I’m not saying he’s innocent but I’m not going to assume he’s guilty either.” He gestured at Steve, “You’re Mister Truth and Justice, but in the American justice system people are presumed innocent until proven guilty.” Steve shrank back onto himself. “I may be wrong, maybe he DID have sex her. But what if YOU’RE wrong? Do you understand what happened then, in that context?” He looked around the room, but only Thor and Steve looked marginally guilty. “You,” he pointed again at Steve, “used EVERYTHING Tony has ever hated about himself against him. You created a really bad ‘best case scenario.’ Worst case- he’s guilty of infidelity, he’s guilty of murder, and he goes to prison. Best case- he’s innocent of everything but all of our relationships with him are ruined. Either way, we lose Tony and the team loses Iron Man. Those jibes about him not deserving to be on the team go through his head regularly and you just confirmed for him, incorrectly, that we feel the same way.” He breathed heavily through his nose, his face tinting green again. Hulk REALLY wanted to come out. “I need to leave.” He moved away from the table, about to head for the reinforced room Tony had built for him whenever “Jolly Green” wanted to come out to play. Before he left, he turned back to Steve, his face softening a bit and his voice losing the edge it had during his tirade. “I’m sorry. I know you’re really hurting right now and I wish there was something we could do to fix it. But this,” he gestured to the room, “was not the way to go.”
Tony vaguely heard Steve mention something about maps and unmistakably heard Thor go on a small, but loud, speech about the possibility of finally being able to get his hands on his ill-tempered but sorely missed brother’s scepter, and finally they all filed out of the conference room. Tony calculated that he had enough time grab a coffee before Happy’s arrival as he fell into step next to Steve and Bruce heading in the direction of the communal kitchen and his precious, precious caffeine.
Leaving Bruce to get DOCTOR Serafin settled into his lab, Steve made his way to the communal kitchen to make two plates of sandwiches for himself and Tony. Clint, Nat, and Thor had already gone their separate ways, having made their point that they were a united front in defense of their favorite engineer without ever having to say a word. The wary looks that Agent/Doctor/Angela Serafin kept sending their way obviously conveyed that she’d received the message loud and clear. Fortunately, she had also behaved herself. The only time she made any indication of being inconvenienced was when she saw that the control collars were taken apart and left in pieces in a box that Tony had sent up from his lab before she got there. Steve had given her the run-down of how communication was to be maintained while the trio “worked together” and wrote down Tony’s cell phone number. He also gave her his number, as well, in case any problems came up that he could nip in the bud before they escalated. Dr. Serafin murmured her thanks as Steve left the two scientists to their own devices.
“I’m afraid they are on lock-down and inaccessible. My apologies, Sir.”
Without waiting for a response, Tony walked away and stepped into the elevator. No one said a word as the doors closed on the devastated remains of their leaders’ relationship.
Tony opened his eyes, looking down at the tangle of limbs that he and his lover became every night. Fortunately, it seemed the only part of Steve he’d have to move to wiggle himself free of was his arm; their legs not yet jumbled together. They must not have been asleep for very long.
A scowl from Steve shut Clint up and delighted Coulson. He loved Cap’s mission face.
----------
Following Bruce’s outburst, the team had dispersed, everyone heading for their separate floors. No one had an appetite anymore and the food was wrapped up by Natasha and put away.
“Correct, sir. I have Tony Stark here in my office, as well as Rogers and Banner. They’re investigating some tech we’ve acquired but we’ve hit a snag. It seems Mr. Stark and our lead scientist can’t be in the same room together, by your orders. Anything we should be aware of?”
“- and making sure that the shag is the proper length in the all the right places. Well groomed, you would say.”
“Done. Sir, please-.”
Tony sighed and reached over to turn up the flow of hot air coming from the dash and turned up the seat heater from the mild 2 to more toasty 4. He was reminded by the nasty nip in the air coming the large open hatch at the back of the vehicle why road trips in late January are a lot less fun than during the summer months. Why on Earth Steve had been dead-set on a honeymoon in Paris, where it would still be cold in the Northern Hemisphere in early March was beyond him. Honeymooning in one of the most romantic cities in the world is ridiculously appealing, though. Steve had argued that instead of changing the venue, they should change the date to a warmer month, but Tony was as steadfast with the date as Steve was with their honeymoon locale. Six months was a reasonable enough time to get everything planned while still not having his patience wear thin while waiting. He’d waited long enough to make the super soldier his and they lived risky lives. Paris in late winter/early spring it was. Maybe they’d get lucky and there’d be an early heat-wave. Steve was excited about the prospect of the trees budding and his artist’s fingers were itching to draw Paris in the early stages of a spring blossom. He’d never deny Steve that opportunity.
After everything he’d done, Tony could wait.
Eventually the room calmed down enough that breakfast could continue. Steve didn’t want to drop it until he “understood that reference,” so Tony promised to explain it later when they went back upstairs. The wagging he did of his eyebrows only served to confuse the "man out of time" even more.
“I, uh…” he struggled to get any words out, his mouth suddenly going dry. “I- yeah, ok. Ok. I’ll come with you.”
As he stepped out of the elevator, Natasha gave a wolf whistle.
“Let you spew more lies about where you’ve been, what you’ve been doing and who you’ve been doing them with? I’m done with your flimsy excuses.”
“She should be here around 1:00. Bruce and I will meet her when she comes. We discussed it and figure the best course of action is to set her up in his lab instead of yours.”
“Steve-“
----------
Tony heaved a sigh of relief at hearing his beloved AI’s voice, at least one thing having been righted in his world. “Not right now, J. Where are the others? Where’s Steve? I need to talk to him.” More drumming of his fingers on his chest. Fixing JARVIS was easy, it was fixing things with Steve that would be more difficult and his stomach knotted at the thought that his fiancé spent all night with the idea that he had cheated floating in his mind. This was all Coulson and Hill’s fault. Granted Tony had lied but if he’d had a chance to explain to Steve before they had gotten to him, it wouldn’t have spiraled out of control. The fact that it had been Pepper to retrieve him from SHIELD and not Steve spoke volumes about the strained status of their relationship. But Steve was patient and understood him better than anyone, even more than he understood himself sometimes. Steve had also been wanting to help him with his nightmares and Tony knew that once he explained that what he had done had been BECAUSE of the nightmares that he would forgive him. He just needed to talk to him.
Steve reached slowly around Tony so as not to startle him and gently removed the screwdriver he was holding from his hand. As much he loathe to interrupt him when he got like this- a science-binging Tony was a happy Tony, and a happy Tony was a happy Steve- he knew that he needed to eat. “Come. Food. Eat.”
Tony fumed and stepped away from Steve to approach the agent, despite the ball of anxiety pooling in his stomach as he neared her. Anger trumps fear, any day. “Call me paranoid. I was looking for suspicious, weapon-shaped bumps.”
“Certainly.”
Tony sighed. “I AM mad, but not at you.” He turned back to the workstation and picked his tools up to go back to fiddling with the tech.
The last brick in Tony's foundation crumbles before he decides to take matters into his own hands.
As Hill and another agent led a handcuffed Tony away to go downstairs to the waiting SHIELD vehicles and read him his Miranda rights, he refused to look over at Steve. He knew the situation looked and sounded bad but he also knew he didn’t do anything wrong, at least nothing as bad as what Coulson and Hill were implying. He just needed to play nice and let them collect their evidence so it could prove he was innocent. At the end of the day, he’d be released then explain everything to Steve and they’d move on from this. That was what he told himself, anyway.
“I vote we make sure we’re not here when he does,” Clint said. Everyone, sans Bruce, nodded but no one stood up, waiting for Steve to make the first move to leave.
Bruce was surprised to find that working alongside Dr. Serafin was actually quite pleasant. None of the nastiness he’d seen when he first met her at SHIELD made an appearance, and the initial deduction that he and Tony had made about her level of intelligence had been accurate. No snarky comments about his friend had been made and she was very polite. She’d even gone so far to praise Tony’s work, though it had been offhand and under her breath as though saying it out loud was admitting she’d been in the wrong. Bruce still heard it and had smiled to himself. He loved seeing the moment when people had realized their assumptions about Tony had been incorrect.
So how is everyone liking it? Please feel free to leave comments with your theories, criticisms and praises. The bad guy will be revealed relatively soon but I'd like to hear what everyone is thinking is going on before I do so. Click that button!
“You didn’t even look.”
As the phone rang through the intercom in the penthouse, Tony made his way to the bathroom to splash some water on his face and worked up a mental checklist:
No one would protect him, hell they’d probably give him away just to be rid of him. No Black Widow, no Hawkeye, no Thor, no Hulk. No Captain America. He was alone, all alone. They hated him. Pepper hated him. Happy hated him. Rhodey! Rhodey might come for him. Yes, Rhodey loved him. Rhodey would protect Tony. But then Rhodey could die. Tony wouldn’t let Rhodey die for him. Rhodey can’t die-
“Why the hell is there a note that we’re not to work together? Obviously I know who he is, everyone does, but I’ve never met him before in my life.”
“Tony.”
She was not deterred. “No, seriously, if it wasn’t for the fact that I’m now going to lose my research to a playboy, I’d be happy to point out that the note is well-founded. You practically eye-fucked me as soon as I stepped out of the lab.”
“Mmmmmm. I’d never get sick of this.”
Tony sat up with a jolt, his heart in his throat and unable to breathe. He felt something weighing him down, around his waist and his legs and he started to thrash, trying to free himself from whatever had him trapped.
Coulson didn’t look amused by the insinuation that his people were lacking but it was also understood that compared to the genius of Tony Stark, most people on the planet were lacking. “I’ll be sure to warn them ahead of time.”
Tony was in the corner of his cell, sitting on his cot with his back to the wall when Maria Hill showed up in the morning outside his door, unlocking it with the swipe of one of those damn key cards. He couldn’t see it, but he knew a little green light lit up before the door slid open.
Steve continued his rampage. If he realized the fear he was inflicting on Tony, he made no indication of wanting to stop. “All this time I DEFENDED you. I PROTECTED you. It turns out it was myself who I should have been protecting from YOU.” He didn’t seem to realize the irony in his words as Tony cowed. “They were right! Everything that the media has said about you. That you were a slut, a selfish egotistical bastard who didn’t deserve a spot on the Avengers because you are the LAST PERSON anyone should look up to as a role model-“
“Better tell that to your agents, then. They have judge, jury, and executioner written all over their faces, and they seem to have already made up their minds.”
Just as they were loading up their arms to make their way inside, Natasha, Clint and Thor showed up to help do the heavy lifting. Aside from acknowledging nods, the group was silent as they made their way to the set of rooms- personal and business- that the Director and his team would be using the duration of their stay. The whole affair had a somber mood.
Tony debated internally if he really wanted to tell Steve about the weird feelings he got from the agent. Part of him did- he didn’t like keeping things like that from him. Unfortunately, he wasn’t sure he could appropriately articulate exactly WHAT had happened and he certainly didn’t know WHY. He had hoped Fury and his note could shed some light on it, but he didn’t know what it WAS. Just a feeling of unsettling familiarity that his memory couldn’t account for, and it made him very on edge. He settled for saying, “Curiosity, I guess,” with a shrug.
Steve hadn’t said anything the night before, still in shock from what had happened at the facility in D.C. They’d followed the SHIELD jet and immediately after landing went about trying to find out more information about where Tony was and details about Dr. Serafin’s murder. Director Coulson and Agent Hill had been sympathetic and taken them to a conference room to fill them in on what they could- it was still an open investigation. Afterwards, they’d questioned them about what had happened on their end, about any interactions between the victim and suspect they might have witnessed and what they knew of Tony’s whereabouts the previous evening. Bruce told them everything he knew about their interactions, which hadn’t been a lot. Steve had reiterated that Tony had an alibi and only wavered slightly when confronted with the video of him at Dr. Serafin’s motel. It wasn’t until they put in a conference call to Pepper Potts and she’d informed them that there had been no such dinner meeting that Steve started to crack. They started gently questioning if Tony had been acting weird and Steve’s expression spoke volumes. With a bit more prodding (and obvious embarrassment), he opened up about what had happened in their bedroom that night after Tony came home from his “dinner meeting” and the following morning. He described the guilty looks that he had brushed off as Tony feeling bad for missing dinner with the team. By the end of it, everyone could tell that Steve was barely containing his upset and they decided to end the conversation after garnering assurances from him and the rest of them that they would call if they remembered anything else of importance. They all agreed that while the circumstances were EXTREMELY suspicious, Tony wasn’t a murderer. The other agreement about him apparently being a cheater went unspoken. Even Clint, who never missed a chance to crack about Tony, was stoic. Before they left the conference room, Coulson offered to let them watch the interrogation. They found Tony’s nonchalance and flimsy excuses to be revolting and his claim that Dr. Serafin had come onto him laughable. After Coulson and Hill exited the interrogation room, the team departed and returned to the tower. Steve didn’t speak the entire ride home- no one did- and silently went to the floor that had been his before moving in with Tony.
“That’s not an option.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“What just happened?”
“I was worried you were mad at me.”
“Seriously, what did happen? Ya know, I thought I knew since I was actually the only person who was there, but everyone else seems to believe something different, so obviously I’m wrong.”
The table was silent as they sat at an impasse.
A sigh from the other end. “Tony. Please. Just tell me what you were doing at that motel room.”
Tony would be lying if he told himself he wasn’t starting to freak out slightly. After storming out of the kitchen, he barely made it to the elevator and up to his lab before the beginnings of yet another anxiety attack gripped him. He sat in the rolling chair he had vacated earlier when he straddled Steve and pressed the heels of his palms to his eyes, taking deep breaths. “JARVIS, lockdown the lab and engage privacy mode.” He couldn’t see it with his eyes closed, but he assumed the windows that served as walls had darkened, blocking anyone outside from seeing in. He didn’t need anyone to see him having a freak out, especially when he didn’t know what was causing it.
Bruce was about to say something else when all three of them could hear a commotion coming from behind the double doors. The agent, who Tony dubbed “Miss Trunchbull” in his mind, moved closer to the door and kept a wary eye on her charges to make sure they didn’t try to intervene; as though they could get through the double doors with the little red light and unhappy sounds. Honestly, they probably could, but not without time to hack it or Hulk knocking it down. Instead, Tony and Bruce kept quiet in an attempt to hear what was being said in the lab, but it was too muffled pick up actual words. Whoever was speaking- yelling, honestly- sounded like a woman, and a very angry woman at that. They assumed that whenever there were pauses in the woman’s tirade, Coulson must’ve been on the other end of the argument though they couldn’t hear anything to confirm their theory. In the years they’ve been working with the man, no one on the team had ever heard him raise his voice. His level of snark and threats of tasering anyone were the best indicators of where he was on the frustration scale.
Brown eyes met blue and he nodded.
Hill had her lips pressed into a thin line. “I don’t buy it. We talked to Steve-“
“Good morning, Sir. It is 11:46am on Saturday, February 3rd and it is currently 27 degrees and sunny. There is a 30% chance of precipitation this evening beginning at 6pm, with no notable accumulation to be expected. Would you like information on the closing stocks from last evening?”
No triggering content in this chapter.
Tony stuck his tongue out at Clint while Steve was focused on the rest of what Coulson was saying and then went back to picking through the information that Coulson or Maria Hill had already sent him on the recovered Chitauri tech before Clint could tattle on him. A firm grip on his shoulder from Steve told him he’d still seen it though and Clint looked slightly smug when he noticed. Worth it. Bruce made his way over to peer over Tony’s other shoulder that was not being taken up by Captain America’s death grip that was there as a reminder to behave himself “or else.” Sometimes Tony liked to push his luck anyway because it made for delightfully rough and tumble times in the bedroom after getting Steve particularly riled up. Tony suspected that he knew that he did it intentionally sometimes, but Steve definitely didn’t seem to mind. In fact, he was pretty sure that it was tactic Steve used himself- Captain America was, after all, a skillful tactician.
“Sir? Is there any way I can be of assistance?”
JARVIS tried again, “Sir, please, let me help you with your breathing. In for five seconds… out for five seconds…” Tony continued to ignore him until the AI threatened to alert Bruce, fearing he would pass out.
This time when there was no answer from JARVIS, there was no panic, remembering instantly that he had silenced J’s mother-henning and insistence on calling Bruce. He debated unmuting him for the sake of avoiding everyone else, weighing the pros and cons of avoiding everyone that he was trying to avoid, his AI included. Needless to say, avoiding the others took precedence but he still didn’t want to listen to his ever present AI needle him about asking for help that he didn’t want. He opted for Plan C and made his way to the dark, back corner of his lab, towards an inconspicuous door that was perfectly flush with the wall and blended in almost completely with its surroundings. You couldn’t see it if you didn’t know it was there and no one- not even Steve- knew of its existence. Hell, he barely even used the thing. Sneaking out to get dressed to meet Dr. Serafin had been the only time he used it in the last several years. Since becoming better friends with the other Avengers, he didn’t feel the need to use it to sneak back and forth.
Exhausted from his unusually emotional night, Steve sighed and settled his head and neck against the pillows. He stayed on his side and wrapped himself around Tony, hoping it will provide enough comfort to keep the nightmares at bay and drifted off to sleep.
Coulson caught him glance to the sky and assured him that was all.
Tony gave Bruce a blank look, then shook his head. “No, she didn’t.”
Steve, not realizing that the mood had changed and assuming his lovers movements were the result of ecstasy, dug his fingers into Tony’s hips as he writhed. He was caught off guard and taken aback when suddenly a fist came down hard on his shoulder. It wasn’t enough to bruise the super soldier but it caught his attention. He released his hold of Tony’s hips and pulled his mouth off of his cock. As he looked up and caught sight of the brunette’s anguished face, he jumped off of him and to the other side of the bed in shock. There were tears streaming from his tightly shut eyes and running down into the hair at his temples, his lips moved as he repeated “No, no,” like a mantra. One hand clutched the sheets in a death grip and the other was formed into a fist and floated like a guard over his chest, which was heaving up and down as he hyperventilated. His legs, released from Steve’s weight over them, bent at the knees as though ready to kick if he was approached. Steve was horrified.
They both read their respective devices and, sure enough, it was Coulson with directions to conference video call him with the others. As they headed to one of the tower’s many, but most used conference rooms, Steve couldn’t help but ask, “Are YOU the one who ate Clint’s potato chips? He already confronted me about it but I’m innocent. If they were sour cream and onion, though, I’d be all over them.”
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“I don’t know. The note was made by Director Fury and can’t be amended. I tried to but I keep getting denied.”
“I’ve gotten BETTER at playing nice.”
“Son of a BITCH! JARVIS! Unmute. What the hell-.”
Three hours later, Steve found Bruce and Tony still in the lab taking apart the control collars and comparing what they found to Agent Serafin’s notes. Both were pleasantly surprised to find the notes to be very thorough and that they came to the same conclusions that she had. It was refreshing to find someone who actually knew what they were doing in SHIELD’s science division. If it wasn’t for her obvious distaste of Tony- which neither blamed her, they’d be mad if they were kicked out of their own labs as well- they probably would’ve been very happy to collaborate with her in the future.
“Yes, Sweetheart, I brought you food. You need to eat. After vomiting up last night’s supper and missing breakfast this morning, you must be starving.”
“Night Brucie-Bear! Sweet dreams!”
“What nature would that be?”
“Tony, can you hear me? Tony, if you can hear me, squeeze my hand…”
Tony's been a bad boy keeping secret meetings from Steve, but that's just the beginning. He's good at hiding things and it just may get him killed. Things are going to start going downhill fast in the next chapter, so stay tuned...
“Agent Serafin believes them to be containment devices.”
As soon as the elevator doors closed, Tony sunk to the floor, fisting his hair in one hand and grasping at his chest with the other. He couldn’t breathe. He closed his eyes, seeing the ring laying on the kitchen floor- discarded, but still beautiful.
Tony snorted a laugh, the dream already being rubbed from this eyes by the finger pads of his right hand. “It’s all good Brucie-Bear, I’ll just be sure to rouse you some unexpected morning with an air horn.”
A rude gesture thrown over his shoulder was Bruce’s response as the doors closed behind him on his fearless team leader’s playful laughter.
Tony ignored him and instead opened his eyes, the lab extending beyond the doors and beckoning him. He stood up on unsteady feet and lurched into the space, almost bumping into DUM-E who had come rolling over immediately, concern for the man who gave him life making him even more clumsy. Tony collapsed again in the middle of the floor and placed his forehead on the cool granite, trying to draw in air as his body was wracked by sobs.
“No, THEY’RE watching a movie. YOU were impersonating a space cadet. Do you even know what’s on the screen?”
On the one hand, Steve had deeply wounded Tony but on the other hand, Tony was currently splayed out on the bathroom floor in obvious emotional and physical distress. Tony understood. He both really wanted to punch the man while simultaneously curl into his arms. He quickly shut that down with a firm, “NO.” Pulling his hand closer to him to see if the red and white spots had faded, he continued rubbing his fingertips together. The tingling has almost completely faded. “Why is Coulson and his band of merry men and women here at the tower? They already collected any evidence I’d have brought home with me.”
With a sigh to put Coulson’s previous one to shame, Steve stood up and made his way for the door. With his hand on the knob, he turned back. “I’ll do what I can to help you find Agent Serafin’s murderer. But understand that I will NOT help you incriminate an innocent man.”
“No, Sir, he is in deep REM sleep and gives no indication of waking.”
“Wait, what?” Clint interrupted. “Now FURY’s discussing your sex life? Was that over supper?” Heated glares from Tony, Steve, and even Bruce, shut him up.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“...cardiac arrest…”
“Captain Rogers is currently on floor 67, in a meeting with Director Coulson. Would you like me to contact him for assistance?” JARVIS actually sounded both hopeful and hesitant at the same time, if that was possible for a human, much less and artificial intelligence.
“Is this an interrogation, Director?”
From JARVIS' muted speakers, there came no warning that the next time Tony stepped foot outside the lab, the doors would be locked even to him.
Bruce backed away from both groups, breathing heavily through his nose, trying to keep Hulk at bay.
Rhodey knew him well. Calm and collected did more to rattle Tony than rage ever did. Tony could battle rage, has done it repeatedly, with his usual snark and perfectly-timed insults. Tony’s only ever heard Rhodey use this tone with him twice before; Once, when he’d been given a newly minted driver’s license and made the stupid mistake of getting shit-faced and crashing spectacularly, nearly killing himself and almost taking an innocent family of four with him. The other time was only about a year later, after Tony was released from a very private hospital. Tony would never forget Rhodey’s voice- or his face- as he described the horror of finding him on his dorm-room bed, unresponsive, in a puddle of his own vomit with an empty bottle of pills, empty bottle of scotch, and a hastily scrawled note. That tone of voice had an impact on Tony and could cow him like nothing ever would.
Bruce gave an awkward cough and said, “If you’ll follow us, we’ll show you to where you’ll be working.”
“NO! I believed you when you said that you weren’t like that anymore-“
“Shall we, then? I’ll show you to the workstations we’ve set up with our new acquisitions.” Coulson opened the doors again with another swipe and stepped through, nodding at Tour Guide Trunchbull in dismissal. Tony and Bruce followed, the latter still feeling as though he wanted to crawl out of his skin and not being able to pin point why.
“What THE HELL were you thinking!?”
“I don’t know,” Coulson gestured his confusion with his hands, “I’ve never had that happen before.”
“Your forgiving heart will get you burned.”
----------
Bruce nodded and rubbed a hand over his tired face.
----------
“Sir-.”
As he entered, he could see Tony bent over some delicate-looking circuitry and wiring of one of the control collars. Holo-displays floated nearby, filled with numbers and equations that Steve had no hope of even vaguely understanding. Tony set down the small tools in his hands and turned to give him his attention as he said, “Sorry, I forgot I had JARVIS initiate lockdown. I just needed some time to cool down and I didn’t know if you were hot on my heels after I left.” He tilted his head up a bit to give Steve a kiss when the super soldier stopped next to him.
As he and Bruce followed the agent, who Tony had noticed had embarrassedly looked away when Steve had kissed him, the rest of the way to the science labs, Tony could’ve sworn the place got even more dreary. Though, that could’ve been because he no longer had the pleasant view of Steve’s backside, which always made even the most drab of locations look sunnier.
“Before she tore me to shreds in that office! She’s not staying HERE. I’m not working with her.”
Tony glared.
“Don’t encourage him, Tony.”
Silence.
“A firm, unmoving hand in a non-vulnerable area should help ground him instead of making it worse.”
Tony woke with a gasp, sweat beading on his forehead. He couldn’t stop his shaking as he struggled to sit up off of the floor of his lab- which most definitely was not burning. Everything looked normal.
Tony woke with a start, his heart pounding in his chest and blood pulsing in his ears. It took a moment for his eyes to adjust and to remember where he was. He could feel the pull of nausea on his stomach stretching up to the back of his throat as he put a hand over his mouth and squeezed his eyes shut to try to suppress it. With his eyes shut, he focused on what he could feel to try to calm himself and breathed deeply through his nose. The feel of the expensive, high thread-count sheets pulled up to his underarms; the heat of the front of Steve’s body nestled close to his back and the weight of his arm where it wrapped gently, but securely, around Tony’s waist. He could feel the moist warmth of Steve’s breath against his neck where he had nuzzled his face in.
“… en route…”
“Captain Rogers wishes to not be disturbed at this time.”
“You’re losing your edge, Rogers,” he said, stopping in front of Steve. “Should probably go back to target practice. Your aim was off.” Tony pulled open a small door that was built into the pillar and tossed the ring that he still had in his hand into the bucket that unfolded every time the door was opened. “You missed the garbage shoot.” As he shut the door, everyone in the room could hear the faint clattering that the vibranium jewelry made as it traveled down to inevitably disappear into the waiting dumpster below.
Some of you may argue that Steve is OOC but I believe his reaction is an understandable one. We've all seen in the movies that when Steve is angry or hurt, he can be a vindictive little SOB. Just look at their interaction on the helicarrier in the first Avengers movie. There's something about Tony that makes people want to take him down a few pegs and I think that having his heart broken would give Steve plenty of reason to be cruel. Tony hurt him and he wants to hurt him back. Sorry if it upset anyone.
Thor joined in. “You don’t know that for certain. The reaction you described is more reminiscent of being injured than infidelity.”
The elevator started to go up, JARVIS silent and understanding that his creator needed his safe space. As it arrived at the lab, the doors slid open but Tony stayed where he was. He finally released a shaky exhale, followed by a short inhale then another sharp exhale. The AI recognized the signs. “Sir, you need to calm your breathing. You’re hyperventilating. Follow my lead and let me guide you. Breathe in, five second count… now out, five second count… in, five seconds… out, five seconds…”
When they arrived to SHIELD headquarters, Tony voluntarily was finger printed and had his cheek swabbed to supply DNA to compare any evidence to. He also submitted to a physical exam, where a physician examined every inch of skin, looking for any defensive wounds. He didn’t like it, but he would do what he had to do to prove he was innocent. Tony only hesitated when they started taking pictures of his body, expressing how regretful SHIELD would be if any of them ended up online. Hill, who’d been hovering nearby the entire time making Tony incredibly uncomfortable, assured him the pictures would stay in SHIELD custody.
“Oh please, you can’t fool me. Those were NOT the kind of ‘bumps’ you were interested in.”
“Actually, he has a point…”
“-for the murder of SHIELD Agent Angela Serafin.”
Steve looked up from angrily poking at a poor, defenseless tomato and arched an eyebrow. “What’s with the suit?”
“I’m not the one to ask. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ll leave you two to do what you do. If you have any more questions, you know where my office is.” Coulson turned on his heels and left through the double doors without a backward glance.
Tony looked down at his feet. “Yeah, well, she bought me coffee.”
Steve gave Tony two hours to calm down before following him to the lab. He understood why the genius was upset but he was still surprised to find the lab in lockdown and the windows blacked-out. Before inputting his security override code and possibly angering Tony by ignoring his obvious desire to be left alone, Steve called out to JARVIS to ask for permission to enter. To his pleasant surprise, the windows immediately lightened and the door clicked as it unlocked and the automatic opening mechanism was engaged.
