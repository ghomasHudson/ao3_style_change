“I don’t think that’s helping Tony.”
You can’t help but gape at the man as he takes the stand but he doesn’t even glance in your direction.
Slowly your surroundings take shape and you notice that someone is holding your arms behind your back and everything hurts. Natasha, Steve and Sam stand in a half circle in front of you. They look worried but ready to fight.
As if on cue FRIDAY’s bodiless voice fills the hall.
“No, he has to learn his lesson. He likes to poke people and that would be fine but one day he will poke Bruce on a bad day and there really is no reasoning with the big green guy. Now go, clean something or whatever you menaces do when you don’t harass my guests.” Stark makes a shooing motion and the robot rolls away beeping happily again.
“What do you want?” you ask, once you are settled on the armchair and Steve on the couch.
Here comes another chapter. A bit later than I anticipated but better than none I hope :D
Lots of love
Tony carefully comes closer and really slowly puts his hand on your arm, projecting his intentions clearly. You let it happen and the touch soothes you, grounds you in the present and you can’t help but crumble forward and then Tony is there. He holds you with his strong arms and you feel safe there, sobbing into his chest.
Sarah
After that, there is only silence while Tony opens your restraints and plugs out the IV needle. He shoves you to the side carefully and slips under the sheets next to you, burying his face in the crook of your neck. After a minute his tears have soaked through your shirt.
You walk further into the hall, the good arm held at the side, palm forward to show that you have no weapons. You are no threat. Then you sink to your knees but your eyes stay focused on Stark’s. The man raises an eyebrow, questioningly, but you remain stoic.
A steady stream of doctors and lawyers and psychologists find their way to you now every day and you answer a lot of questions that are mostly inappropriate but you answer anyway because you know the truth is important. Clint and Natasha come by occasionally. Stark never shows up.
“Buck – I mean James. Is James okay?” Rogers asks and he looks kind of lost as well and you just nod. James is fine.
Silence fills the room after that and you think about everything. Steve sounds honest and he looks like someone kicked his puppy and maybe it wasn’t his fault alone anyway.
Two days later there is a knock on your door and when you open it you look directly into Steve’s face and you slam the door shut again.
The shot makes your ears ring and it hurts like a bitch but it’s just a flesh wound in your shoulder, the good one, and you are confused. The Soldier is roaring now, hammering against the confines you built in your mind and you have to squeeze your eyes shut to regain control.
“I’m sorry for how things went, okay? I... when Steve kissed me I was just as surprised as everyone else. I won’t lie to you and say I didn’t like it or that I didn’t want it. I love Steve. But I know that you still have feelings for him as well and I never meant to hurt you. Because the truth is, I have feelings for you as well Tony and it’s nothing but a mess since I told Steve. And I never planned acting on any of it because I was content with being your friend. But now I’m afraid that I messed that up as well.” It feels good to tell Tony the truth in a way but the silence stretches and you can’t bear to look at the man.
It’s a marvel, you think as you observe her retreating form. You have never seen Pepper Potts flee.
When Bruce comes in the next day he brings Pepper. You don’t know how she managed to get an okay but you don’t want to know. She doesn’t speak but clutches your hand painfully, nails digging into your still tender skin but you don’t complain. Her eyes are bloodshot and puffy but as the first tear starts to fall she turns around and hurries out of the room.
A few hours later she bullies you into getting dinner and before you leave the room she turns to you.
Your voice breaks on the last word because Tony is so much more than a friend and you realise now that you would never be happy with just Steve or just Tony and isn’t that just fucking great. Because you can’t leave well enough alone and now you have to go get greedy on top of everything else. The first sob escapes you before you can stop it but Natasha just hugs you tighter and you know she doesn’t judge.
The Avengers are split into two parties now. Team Captain America and Team Iron Man, as Clint likes to call them. (Okay, so you remembered the name. What’s the big deal?) Ironically you are on Team Iron Man because let’s be honest here, you are not the good guy and you have no idea what Rogers’ agenda is but you have a feeling that he is chasing shadows. Clint just nods solemnly when you tell him this. It’s the most you have spoken to him since he started to drop into your room from the vents.
The first weeks are a blur. You stay wherever you find yourself, mostly in abandoned buildings or in the streets. You stay away from crowds and overpopulated cities because people scare you and there are just so many. Plus it’s easier to hide your arm that way. You never stay anywhere more than two days though because you can see the shadows moving and shifting around you and you are, like 80 percent certain it is not just your imagination. HYDRA is chasing you and SHIELD is chasing you and the name Steve Rogers triggers a burst of memories. (At least you think they are memories but you can’t really be sure with a head as messed up as yours.) Fights in back alleys, a scrawny guy half dead from his many illnesses, so much time spent together, a kiss. But the guy in the maybe-memories, the one who is supposed to be you, you don’t recognize him anymore. You are not him and so you run, not only from SHIELD but also from Steve Rogers.
“You should carry him up to his suite. If you wake him up now he will just run back to the lab and he looks like he needs a good night’s sleep.” You see that Steve aims for nonchalant and misses by a mile but his statement is probably true.
“So, you two made up already? Why am I here then?” You can see him shutting down immediately, eyes turning hard and his jaw sets.
Her tone is pleasant enough but there is a threatening undertone and not a second later the doors open and Tony walks into the room. Rhodey follows him, dragging a struggling Steve along and the door is shut after them, by FRIDAY most certainly, and you are sure that no one will enter or leave this place in the foreseeable future.
When you finally come to for good the sheets have been changed and the vomit is wiped away. You take in your surroundings carefully. The bed you lie on is a standard hospital one but it’s been reinforced to hold your restraints. You can’t move your arms or feet more than a few inches. There are machines all around you, beeping and whirring and for all that it looks like a hospital room. It even smells like one. But there is no mistaking the transparent walls of the Hulk containment chamber.
“I was wrong, James. Not saying anything back then. I was just confused and I really needed to think about it. I’m not… Pepper said you think I’m disgusted by you but that’s not true. I could never be disgusted by you. I was surprised, yes. But not disgusted.”
“Do you have feelings for Steve?” Natasha asks.
You don’t try again.
Bruce is the only doctor allowed inside because he is the only one who can defend himself against the Winter Soldier. You don’t bother to tell anyone that the soldier is no threat anymore. He is gone, you can feel it. You don’t know how or why but the place in your mind where darkness had lingered before is empty now and you can’t help but feel like you are not whole anymore. It’s no use anyway. You did what you did and you had your second chance.
Lots of love
“Mr Stark, I only have one question for you”, the attorney, Brad Caldwell, starts. “It is common knowledge that James Buchanan Barnes killed your parents.”
Clint actually looks kind of pale and you just look at Natasha with a raised eyebrow.
Being back in the workshop feels like coming home and Tony was certainly not lying about the bots because they ambush you the second you step through the doorway and keep following you around for almost an hour before Tony’s patience snaps and he sends them running (or wheeling) to the other end of the workshop with a very serious threat.
So you run and Clint is there beside you but he doesn’t stop you. He shoots two guards with his tranquilizer arrows and you don’t question it and so you run together.
He stutters badly at the end and then just stops talking abruptly. You can see his whole face turning red and how he suddenly finds his hands really interesting and it strikes you that maybe you have been unfair to him as well. All the time you just were angry because he wanted to pressure you into being someone else. But he is just as lost in this world as you are. And you –
“What’s the big plan, Barnes?” Stark’s voice is rough and deep and you can detect the anger without problem.
“What did she do?”
“Boss, your access has been revoked.”
– until you lock yourself in your room.
You aren’t really sure what to think of that offer. Of course you miss your arm. It’s hard to do everything with just one arm but you can cope. It’s a small price to pay for everything you have done. And do you really want Stark to build you a new arm? Stark, whose parents you have killed?
“Honestly? No. I won’t say that I’ll never come back but right now I’m good where I am. And I’m not a member of the Avengers anyway so I really shouldn’t live in the Avengers Tower.” You chuckle and he scoffs.
You are dozing in and out of awareness when you notice a commotion by the doors. There are shouts and orders and it takes a moment for you to understand what is going on but then you start to make out different voices.
After that you remember nothing for a long time because after more than a year the control on your mind slips and darkness takes over.
Bruce asks questions but you don’t answer, just nod or shake your head when necessary and the one time you make the mistake to look him in the eyes you see the same despair you saw in Natasha’s only a day ago.
Shortly after that the elevator spits out Stark and a woman who can only be Ms Potts. You have heard about her but this is the first time you see her and now you know what Clint meant when he said that you better not cross her. She looks nice enough and she smiles at you but you were taught how to assess people and the Winter Soldier would have classified her as a threat even though she has no super powers at all. What she has are sharp eyes and a no-nonsense attitude and well, you vow then and there that you will never get on her bad side.
Of course he had been upset. Steve and Tony had been together before you came back from the dead and you are pretty sure that Tony still has feelings for Steve because after all the time that has passed he is still avoiding the man if you are not around. And you had been so focused on your own feelings for both men that you never thought about what would happen if you acted on any of those feelings. And now Steve has made the first step and your friendship with Tony is probably ruined.
“Would you consider coming back to the lab to help me out again?” He avoids your gaze and it means the question is important to him. So you consider it, carefully weighing the pros and cons in your head. You love the lab and the work there. You miss the robots and most of all FRIDAY and it’s probably a good way to salvage your friendship. You also remember how Pepper told you how you isolate yourself and maybe showing up in the tower from time to time will be good after all.
– that would turn you into the Winter Soldier again. You can feel him clawing in your mind, the relief from just a minute ago gone again. People start screaming around you but Ms Fields stays relaxed as does Stark and you take a deep breath, calming yourself down and look the attorney straight in the eyes. Nothing happens, of course it doesn’t, because Stark had modulated your memories with his newest invention (well, technically he had never been there in the room with you but it was still his work) and now those words can do nothing to you anymore. They are just words.
“I wouldn’t want to be Steve or Tony right now”, is all she adds with a shrug.
He leaves shortly after because he is a busy man, much like Pepper is a busy woman, but not before you promise to come by the lab this weekend. You close the door behind him and you smile because your life isn’t such a mess after all.
She is smiling at you and it feels good to finally get those things out because you needed to hear them from yourself.
“Do what you have to do, Stark. It will be easier for everyone when I’m gone.” Your voice is rough too, from disuse but it’s neutral and devoid of any emotions.
“James, look at me. Come on. Cap is gone, it’s fine.”
“You are alive.” It comes out raspy because you haven’t talked in over two months and tears are still spilling down your face and Tony’s head snaps up sharply.
“Let’s just say Pepper is a very scary woman when she is out for someone’s hide and leave it at that.”
a new Chapter!
She sounds so sure and you can’t help but start crying again.
– is the only thing he has from a past that no one here remembers and of course Rogers had tried to hold onto that. And maybe you don’t remember most of it, but he is also the only thing that you have from the past.
“At first, yes. I told Steve the truth and his reaction”, you pause to search for the right words. “It could have been better. I decided to move out to give everyone some space and to clear my head but I realised pretty soon that this is something I wanted. A life of my own. Having a job, paying the bills. Taking on responsibility. After everything that happened in my life this feels really good. I’m happy.”
The video of you killing the villain had gone viral in under one hour and a witch hunt had started. A lot of people out there were on your side, claiming that the guy had had it coming for him for almost killing Iron Man and that no one would be sorry he was gone. But high ranking politicians and military personnel had seen it as a chance to attack the Avengers again, blaming them for harbouring a well-known war criminal. They wanted James’s head on a stake and would stop short of nothing to get it. At the moment the Avengers had the status of war criminals as well, SHIELD was trying to mediate but the government just started to attack them as well. People were protesting in the streets, some in their favour, others against them. But it was a mess out there with no chance of being sorted out anytime soon.
“Neither did I, to be honest.” You consider sitting down as well but you are far too nervous to sit still now and so you busy yourself with making hot chocolate.
You vomit right then and there and finally give in to the pain of your burned body, falling unconscious immediately.
!WARNING!
After the movie is over everyone shuffles out of the room, mumbling their goodbyes. Tony is still fast asleep and in the end only he and Steve remain in the living room.
He pauses there and you stare blankly at him, not really sure if you want to hear the rest. Steve looks calm but you have noticed a slight tremble in his voice. Natasha stands totally still, her hand hovering over her gun, but her eyes flicker around almost nervously. Sam looks outright uncomfortable and even Thor is tense and the guy loves a good fight. Something is terribly wrong.
It doesn’t even hurt when you take a look at the newspaper one morning and see them together, on the red carpet for some charity event, Steve’s arm casually draped across Tony’s shoulders.
You try to run but it’s useless. A guy all in black tries to kill you and you can’t help to think that his outfit looks like he bought it in one of those kinky sex shops. Then of course Steve Rogers comes to rescue you in all his Captain-America-glory and you try to run again but in the end SHIELD captures you all and they lock you away.
You know that as well.
Even though people are talking to you again, nobody tells you what is happening outside. And you are too afraid to ask. The room and the containment chamber slowly become a fort. FRIDAY has taken full control of the tower, effectively throwing everyone out who has no business being there. Avengers come and go and they bring with them food supplies, water and medicine. Shortly after that Clint and Natasha drop in through the vents with a shitload of weapons and other military supply. Steve and Sam go out to grab mattresses from the deserted rooms and build a kind of blanket fort in the far end of the containment chamber. Ms Fields drops by occasionally and talks in hushed voices with Tony.
“Works for me”, he exclaims after looking from you to Steve and the unceremoniously plants his head in your lap and his feet in Steve’s and ten seconds later his soft snores underline the movie.
You just manage a tight nod but Stark doesn’t seem to catch up on your discomfort.
“How can I be of assistance, boss?”
After two more hours things seem to take a turn for the better before they go spectacularly wrong, of course. You don’t know what happens exactly but you can make out Tony in the armour, dragging the last bot he dismantled to the pile of already taken down bots. He drops it before he seems to freeze in midair and the last thing you see is him firing up all his blasters, trying to get away from the pile of broken bots. Then there is a big explosion and the noises from the TV mix with the real noises outside and the tower actually shakes. It feels like slow motion as you jump up from the couch, staring at the screen incredulously. You can hear Pepper gasp and her chair topple over as she jumps up as well, fingers digging hard into the wooden desk.
Then Stark is off again and you saunter over to the old couch and carefully sit on the edge. You still don’t know why you are here. FRIDAY had relayed the invitation this morning but had refused to give you any further information and you are kind of nervous. The trial was one and a half weeks ago and you haven’t seen Stark since then and you are really unsure on where the both of you stand.
“I’m so sorry, James.”
Sometimes he looks at you with these big brown eyes and you just want to pull him close and kiss him. But then you think about how far you have come from him hating you and you don’t want to risk this friendship and so you don’t.
(See the end of the chapter for
For the next week or so he avoids you. Tony has locked himself in the lab and life is miserable again. Clint and Natasha try to get you out of your room as often as possible but you just feel empty and broken and somehow you messed everything up again. Not for the first time that week you think about how much easier it would have been if Tony had just shot you in the head back then.
“You don’t have to talk to me, you know. I was here and that is what Pepper requested so.” Tony fidgets with his newest Stark phone, avoiding your eyes.
The first time you step into Stark’s lab is fantastic. The man is surrounded by blue holograms and everything looks so futuristic and awe-inspiring that you can’t help but stare. Then something sharp pokes your leg and you turn around, ready to fight. The robot pokes you again, in the belly this time, totally unfazed by your fighting stance and beeps in a way that almost sounds excited.
It starts innocent, like every story, with another fight in a back alley and more bruises and a sprained wrist. But it turns to your very first kiss and you remember the memory that popped up in your head. But there are just pictures and no feelings and you can see all of his emotions, just there in his eyes, plain as day. And you can’t take it.
The trial goes as well as expected. There are many experts talking about brainwashing and torture and you can’t help but cringe when they show videos and pictures from your files. They are just the most harmless clips but it is torture and agony nonetheless and you curl in on yourself when you remember the pain. There are people testifying against you as well, people whose families or loved ones you killed, military officers and politicians. Ms Fields had informed you how this would roll and everything is as she said it would be until she calls the last witness for the defence and it’s none other than Tony fucking Stark.
“You are going to what, Rogers?”
“That was just rude, James”, he jokes.
Steve still isn’t talking to you but the other Avengers are almost back to their normal selves and you count that as a win.
“What? he grumbled, not particularly keen on answering the coming question.
“I wasn’t going to waste a perfectly good meal,” informed Tony although in all honesty the meat that night had been a little dry.
“Are you sure that you should be questioning his commitment issues because I think that your’s are slightly more problematic.” Clint had barely finished the sentence before Natasha leaned over and pinched him. Hard.
“Your sense of smell is that heightened and yet you didn’t find the smell of putrefaction overwhelming?” Steve asked, knowing that his own sense of smell wasn’t strong enough to smell the things that Tony could. Although right now it was certainly strong enough to catch wisps on Tony’s aftershave, something he found very intoxicating. Steve had to shove his hands under his legs to stop himself from reaching over and pulling Tony close in order to press his nose against the man’s neck.
Tony muttered a curse under his breath.
Thank you for the response to this crazy little idea I had in my head!
So not incredibly long I know but the next chapter will be and I'll try to get it up pretty soon.
“You have no idea,” Clint whispered, low enough to be unheard by any super hearing.
Tony smirked back in response. “Because you’re my science bro and you know me so well.”
“Clever,” Natasha murmured, recalling past missions were a skill like that would have been useful. She was starting to feel really uncomfortable with how off her previous assessment of Tony had been. Tony Stark not recommended. It was almost comical at how wrong that was.
“Really Tony?” Steve groaned, feeling slightly embarrassed for the genius at how oblivious and also obvious he was being.
“A little archaic isn’t it to be performing a sacrifice,” Bruce muttered, the film intriguing him even further.
“You said that your skills are something that sticks with you through all your lives” Steve began, his mind thinking of the tactical advantages Tony’s skills could be used for. “So you can do it in this life?”
Natasha rolled her eyes. “Right, not a crush. What would you call it when you pay extra attention to him when he comes on and the way you practically swoon and sigh as you hear his clues and listen to his singing?”
Tony sent an apologetic look to Bruce in response to the man’s glare. “Would you believe me if I said it wasn’t my intention to antagonise him?”
“Poor man,” winced Bruce in sympathy at being unable to stop the force that is Tony Stark.
“Damn Nat, I wished you had told me before,” Clint whistled, slightly hurt that his oldest friend hadn’t told him this significant part of her history.
“Yeah, no. How about we don’t phrase it like that and just perhaps say beat him?”
Bruce huffed in realisation. “You were just trying to get a reaction from him.”
“Never take your eyes of your opponent,” Clint offered, his eyes meeting Natasha’s across the room as they knew how a mistake like that could nearly cost you your life.
“Brittany sage?” questioned Thor, not quite familiar with all the various herbs and spices that Midgard used.
Steve tensed up at the knife at Watson’s throat. He may not exactly be the man’s biggest fan but that didn’t mean he wanted to see the man go in such a manner. Although judging by the almost bored look on Tony’s face, he figured that he didn’t have much to worry about. Steve frowned slightly at the sight of Tony’s face. The look was similar to how his past self had worn and something about it concerned Steve. It was almost as though Tony was distancing himself by appearing unaffected by matters.
Happy reading and I hope you enjoy it!
Cheeks blushing in slight mortification at being put to bed like a child by his crush, he mumbled out a no whilst shuffling to the bathroom. He would have honestly thought that after a year of living with the man that he would have been able to shake off the attraction that he felt towards the super soldier. Instead the attraction had grown into something more, something which Tony didn’t want to put a name too because he knew that his feelings wouldn’t be reciprocated.
Hulk shook his head vigorously in disagreement. “NO. TIN MAN LIKE TO DO STUPID THINGS LIKE FLYING HIMSELF INTO SPACE AND HAVING HULK SAVE HIM.”
The guys nodded their agreement sheepishly, knowing that the assassin was right.
“I want one,” Clint exclaimed, picturing himself looking mighty fine with a weapon like that. Everyone else though thought differently but were willing to humour him so that they could make fun of him in the future.
“I would say that you’re becoming childish and avoiding the subject at hand,” Steve noted, trying not to smile at the affronted look on Tony’s face.
“And there it is,” whispered Natasha, pleased that these revelations were coming to light at last and that Tony was finally realising what they had all known and accepted a while ago.
Tony thought back to that headline. London had indeed been in terror at the revelation of what had happened at Blackwood’s tomb and Tony had felt as though he was the reason to blame for the fear and terror spreading like wildfire across the city. If he had thought ahead and ensured that all the loose ends were tied up, then people would have continued to feel safe.
“We both do,” Natasha chimed in, “but we’ve never been able to master it. Do you think you could teach us?”
Steve knew right then he was going to hate this scene whilst Natasha stared at the woman in confusion. The way the woman looked at Tony reminded her of how she acted when she was playing a mark. Although there did seem to be a hint of something genuine in her gaze but Natasha wasn’t sure what it was exactly.
This chapter for some reason was really difficult to write, maybe because there was a lack of dialogue and I may go back and change some parts later but for now I'm reasonably happy with it. Also I apologise if any of the French is wrong in this chapter, I used translate as I do not know the language. That being said I give you my first chapter of 2018...
“Uh oh,” Tony squeaked as he tried to get up from the couch before he was made a permanent part of it. He silently cursed himself for not thinking that the film would push Bruce to his absolute limits. He had desperately distanced and tried to forget that particular life so much that he had essentially blocked certain memories and emotions attached with that time period. It had seemed like the only logical option back then when he had begun his life after being Sherlock Holmes that he had easily dissociated from the past and now Bruce was paying the price for that dissociation.
True to Natasha’s observation, instead of the expected smashing, the Hulk carefully manoeuvred the wide-eyed genius onto his lap, keeping the genius within eye sight of the team.
“I thought that we were a team. That we trusted each other with our secrets and our lives and yet you didn’t tell us because you thought that we couldn’t handle it. Do we mean so little too you Tony?”
A frown marred the Thunder god’s features as he was certain that he had seen that book before. Both his mother and Loki had an extensive collection of magical tomes and records, so it hadn’t been an unusual sight for him to see one in their hands on Asgard during all times of the day. He tried to rack his memory and knew he could sense it on the edge of his consciousness but for some reason he just could not pull up the memory, something that had never happened before.
Bruce watched the dirty man with thinly veiled disgust. “Some drunk not knowing where he’s going I would say.”
“Maybe,” he mumbled.
“That’s for me to know and you to find out,” grinned Tony, challenge lacing his tone that Natasha had every intention of winning.
Tony grinned back, not apologetic in the slightest. “It’s just my charming personality.”
Bruce looked at Tony in concern for a slight moment. In that simple sentence Tony had sounded an awful lot like his British counterpart. Bruce saw Natasha give the same look to Tony and made a mental note to keep an eye on the engineer.
“That made me angry,” Tony ground out behind clenched teeth at the insult to his long dead best friend.
“Did they actually believe that the Temple of the Four Orders was responsible for the course of history?” Steve asked, not liking that these men who were in high positions of power as well as secret societies with hidden agendas, were responsible for the running of governments.
Clint chimed in at this point taking over whilst the show went to a commercial before the next performance. “Tasha and I watch it to use our spy skills to work out the celebrity although we’re forbidden from using SHIELD or JARVIS to figure it, we have to use other means to figure it out.”
“See I didn’t kill the dog,” Tony informed them as he rolled his eyes at their collective sighs of relief.
“After you’re done with Bruce’s presentation on what you should be putting in your mouth, you and I are having a talk about what you can and can’t say to people.” Steve’s tone was firm and unwavering, leaving no room for argument.
Natasha scrunched her nose up in disgust at the way the Inspector phrased that threat.
Steve also gasped slightly but his reasons were slightly different. Even though his mind was starting to deal with the idea that Tony loved another, his body hadn't gotten the message and he found himself slightly turned on by the sight of a sweaty Tony. Shifting slightly in his seat to hide the evidence, he failed to see the amused glances of the team as they tried to conceal their laughter.
“Oooh,” Clint mocked with a large smile, “Tony’s gonna get schooled.”
Seeing the wince Natasha raised an eyebrow. “It can’t be that bad if you're willing to tell us about your past lives.”
“And did you forget about the landing you thought you could stick back in Vegas that involved the suit, a rabbit and a Captain America impersonator?”
“You should not stoke that man’s ego,” scolded Thor.
“No worse than your socks after a mission,” Tony shot back.
Tony remembered the anger that he had felt at the fact that those poor girls were not the first and that he had not known about the other murders. He had of course suspected that they were not the first that Blackwood had killed due to the profile that he created on the man, but he hadn’t had it confirmed until that point. The detective had tried to uncover the poor souls who had become victims of this unnecessary business, but they had been covered up so well that he could not find a single trace of the murders. It was just another unforgivable failure of his that still haunts him to this day.
Finally the result was announced and the team held their breath as the winner was revealed.
“Exactly!”
“I, uh, oh what the hell, I’m just going to say it.” Tony turned to Steve, briefly catching the super soldier’s eyes before dropping his gaze. “Steve, I’ve loved you since that day when you came up to me and apologised about the things said on the Heli-carrier, even though neither of us were at fault. The way that you scuffed your feet on the floor as you stumbled through the apology and the way that you smiled at me after and I invited you to hang out in the lab. The way that you treat the bots as though they are my children and the way that you accept my flaws as part of me such as workshop binges and the way that you take me around New York to try new food places and how you light up in awe of the world around you. I love you Steve.”
“She’s laying it on a bit thick isn’t she?” stated Natasha as she studied the woman who she assumed was trying to make a good impression.
“Great,” Tony muttered, “now we’re going to have Thor pretending to be Jackie Chan. Better hope the news cameras stay away.”
“At what?”
“It’s a Midgardian thing Thor,” Tony responded, his eyes promising that if the rest of the Avenger’s disagreed with him, then there would be hell to pay.
“Yep, the one who loaded the gun is my esteemed colleague John Watson while the other fella is Inspector Lestrade.” Tony answered with a fond smile on his face at the sight of the man he hadn't seen in nearly a hundred years, his smile turning sad when he remembered that his friend was no longer around.
“Is everything a joke to you?” Steve asked, half seriously and half fondly, this time the words not holding any bite. He tried not to show how humorous he found the names given to the men.
“So, Tony I was planning on doing some team exercises today and we’re going to need you to wear the suit to practice some air drills,” Steve said erasing the hurt look on his face with one of determination.
“Back then money was slightly different, so those pieces of paper were essentially bank notes,” Tony explained.
“You are of royalty Friend Natasha?”
Natasha wrinkled her nose in disgust. She knew full well what had just been chucked and felt her stomach churn slightly.
“Not when people’s lives are on the line,” replied Tony seriously. “I’m not going to risk people’s lives because someone made a stupid mistake. If they can’t handle being told how to avoid it in the future so people don’t die, then they can leave and find a job where a mistake doesn't equate to a life.”
Here's the next chapter since I found myself on a roll from the last one and wanted to give you all something a bit longer than before.
“TIN MAN MAKE PUNY BRUCE MAD!”
“I don’t think masochist is in your vocabulary to be honest,” Bruce said with a straight face, carefully observing Tony who had started squirming.
“Have Clint show you later,” Bruce responded, not looking the least inclined to explain the whole variety of cosmetic surgery.
“My laundry is not dirty at the moment,” pouted Thor, thinking that he was going to miss out on a fun team exercise.
Tony choked a little at the phrasing of Thor’s statement.
Tony sighed. “She was clever, intelligent and beautiful which she wasn't afraid to use. She could have easily settled down and had a great life but instead she was a criminal. She would marry men and divorce them for riches or to gain information.”
“Good old protesters,” Clint commented in approval at the sight of the people who were shouting horrible things about Blackwood.
However, Tony wasn’t deterred and once again voiced his question as to what on earth was happening. Seriously, it wasn’t a normal sight to see five of the most feared superheroes on Earth and perhaps the universe, sitting around a TV watching a giant bright pink flamingo strutting across a stage whilst belting out Proud Mary.
Thor felt his anger rise at the sight of his Shield Brother being held up in such a way. He swore to himself there and then that he would do everything in his power to make sure that Tony would never again have to deal with someone placing their hands on him in such a manner. If he failed then there were going to be consequences.
Holmes chases Irene as Blackwood decides to change up the game.
“Well that’s not entirely true,” disagreed Tony with a grimace. “I’ve never disregarded magic due to my condition and I had no proof to confirm or deny its existence. The ever so miniscule amounts of contempt that they were picking up came from their ridiculous notions of importance through their belief in their system and their practices.”
The Avengers sans Tony raised their collective eyebrows at the woman’s prediction, clearly engaged with the scene playing before them.
Tony raised an eyebrow at that revelation. “So the super spy twins weren’t able to deduce that it was me from the clues or voice?”
“Aye Loki is a trickster by nature but his actions are usually fuelled by a semblance of truth. I do not think that he would deviate from this.”
Thor smiled brightly at the noise, finding it quite interesting and inspiring. “That is indeed a most intriguing noise you just made Friend Tony. I shall endeavour to use it in our next battle.”
Steve turned to stare at him curiously until Tony waved him off.
Clint just leaned back in his seat and mimed zipping his lips up, amusement still dancing in his eyes.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” shifted Tony uncomfortably in his seat at the disapproving stares.
Everyone in the room apart from Tony are on the edge of the seats as though they could lean forward enough to see into the coffin themselves.
“I wasn’t doing it on purpose!” Tony defended, trying to wiggle out of Hulk’s lap with no success. “Things just happened and I unfortunately happened to be in the middle of it all!”
With that she turned back to the screen, where indeed a panel where complimenting the Flamingo on her performance and throwing out guesses at her identity. Tony blinked for a second, before shrugging and making his way over to the team. Steve saw him coming and scooted over, making enough room for Tony with a shy smile that never failed to take Tony’s breath away. Tony graciously took the seat next to Steve, just enough space made that they ended up touching from shoulder to knee, not that Tony was complaining. He had had a crush on Steve for the past six months and wasn’t going to pass up any opportunity to have physical contact with the man.
Natasha smiled at the Thunder God’s innocence at certain things. “That may be Thor but they couldn't afford the luxury of waiting for the men to face their fear on their own. They needed to know what was going on there and then.”
“I wish you would too,” Natasha grumbled, her head starting to pound slightly with all the twists and turns of the movie.
Tony sneaked a peek at Steve once he had finished his explanation, allowing the team to wrap their heads around that. What he saw pleasantly surprised Tony. Steve had an expression of understanding of which Tony took to be that Steve knew what it was like to stumble through a new time period whilst having memories of a previous one. That was partially the reason why it was so easy for Tony to help the super soldier in adjusting to the 21st century as Tony had many years of experience behind him. Although helping Steve had the unfortunate side effect of Tony falling for him since they ended up spending hours watching films alone in Tony’s penthouse.
Steve frowned at Tony’s response. He was pretty sure that the mechanic was lying at it had been made apparent that he had almost perfect recall, so why would he feel the need to look at Steve and lie?
“Oh, you’re definitely not impressed with them and you’re basically passively aggressively saying that to keep the conversation going since you don’t actually believe them,” Natasha murmured. She remembered that Pepper had used certain language and phrasing during her time as an assistant. The red head recalled that Pepper had used that phrase four times during a conversation with Hammer as the man refused to take a hint. It made sense now why Pepper used that phrase a lot if she heard it from Tony.
“I would not have wished him a good trip Friend Tony,” Thor began as the time jerked in surprise before remembering that the Prince had the power of All Speak. “Although I have bad feelings about that man and urge you to make your get away as soon as possible.”
“JARVIS? Alpha Tango Three Six Charlie Nine.”
“Wait, you said in one of your clues that Hawkeye was the pansiest of the Avengers and that Merida could take his place you bitch!”
This is a slightly shorter chapter but I felt that the cut off point should be here as the next chapter will be dinner and a fight so that one will be slightly longer.
“And there is the real reason for the fish and chip stand,” noted Natasha, becoming more and more impressed with how well Tony was at manipulation. Although it scared her a little that it came naturally to Tony like breathing did to her.
“She found my weak spot.”
The movie begins and the team still aren't prepared for the surprises coming their way. Old friends are introduced and Clint has trouble keeping his mouth shut.
Tony scooted closer to Steve, silently offering the larger man comfort with his presence instead of his words which the soldier accepted graciously.
Next chapter will be next weekend as I'm really busy this week with both my jobs :(
Steve closed his eyes at the barrage of noises, his mind finding it slightly overwhelming. Feeling a warm hand on his shoulder, he opened them and smiled at Tony to signal that he was okay. Tony made to move his hand away but Steve shook his head. Tony just shrugged and made no further move to remove the hand.
“I still stand by my actions,” the genius muttered, receiving looks of disbelief in response.
Tony had honestly wanted in that moment to whack the Inspector on the head a few times to see if it was possible for him to grow some brain cells because seriously, stating the obvious at every opportunity was very trying on his temper. Luckily the Inspector’s predictability at times had come in useful so Tony had often let it go without much more than a comment.
“It’s Tony Stark!” The presenter shouted as Tony’s grinning face was revealed on the screen as the winner, his face slightly shiny with sweat from the heat of the mask.
“It had been a while since we had seen Irene so he most probably couldn't easily recognise her and I hadn’t told him that I saw her at the fighting match.” The only reason that he hadn't told Watson about Irene that night was because he had first thought that he was imaging her and then when he realised she was real, he hadn't wanted to deal with all of the teasing that would follow.
This chapter is slightly longer in terms of translating the movie and we are now over half an hour into the film!
Clint felt his own surprise creep on him at the woman’s comment. What were the chances that the two would stumble upon someone with psychic abilities? Was it possible that there were actual supernatural elements to the whole situation?
“I bit you on the Helicarrier when we were fighting,” Natasha said quietly, her face completely void of emotion whilst Clint’s face turned white as a ghost.
“Indeed Friend Tony, these stories most be told over ale and a feast. We shall see if they rival my own!”
Natasha recalled back to the beginning of the film and how Tony had entered the building only after opening the doors wide open.
Bruce thought that he understood why Watson wasn't rejoicing at the sight of Blackwood’s end. Even though it was slightly satisfying seeing a murderer get what he deserved, as a doctor it was hard to see someone die whilst doing nothing to help. It essentially went against everything that as a doctor you fought for.
Tony could see that the team didn't quite get how the man made Irene unsettled and why it was such a big thing. With a sigh he began to explain. “If it makes things easier think of Irene as the Victorian version of Natasha just without the super spy fighting style.”
Clint snorted. “Just proves my point on the fact that you have the worst landings ever.”
Tony noticed her questioning eyes and heaved a heavy sigh. “The one time that I didn't do that, was the one time that I got shot. Luckily Watson noticed the shine of the gun and pushed me to the side so that the bullet only hit my shoulder but it was a close one. That’s why I always open doors and then check before entering a room.”
“Nice dig ‘Tasha,” Tony snorted. “Now that we’ve established that Nat’s a long lost Princess, how about we get back to the film and then air out all our dirty laundry.”
Bruce started stammering his denials which fell on deaf ears as the team already knew about the brownies.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Fe fi fo fum,” Clint whispered, trying to ease the tension that he could feel building in the room.
Steve frowned at the fact that it seemed Tony was never able to lead a normal life in any of his lives but pushed his questions aside to ask a more relevant question. “What exactly is the big deal about Lord Rotheram being the Lord Chief Justice?”
“She doesn’t seem so bad,” Steve started cautiously until he was cut off by Tony’s vigorous head shake.
The giant rage monster vigorously shook his head before Steve even finished his question, deciding to turn his body so that he was facing the TV with Tony still firmly planted in his lap. “HULK KEEP TIN MAN SAFE UNTIL PUNY BRUCE BACK. TIN MAN DO STUPID THINGS WITHOUT HULK.”
“Are you going to say anything Cap?” Tony slightly snarked falling back on his masks to cover the hurt that he was feeling and also, he wanted to get some form of a reaction from the super soldier.
“He must have put up with a lot to be able to ignore your shenanigans,” Bruce sighed well aware how dramatic Tony could be at times in the lab.
“Figuring out how to use it no, figuring out what it was took a bit longer,” Tony admitted slightly sheepishly.
Thor eagerly began pointing back to the screen. “You are in luck Friend Tony, here comes the one that we are all rooting for and that none of us have been able to figure out.” The whole room fell into a hush as the Eagle took to the stage.
Just another person hurt because of his careless mistakes. It was like the cycle never ended.
“Good riddance,” Clint murmured, unaware that the film was soon to deliver the first of many twists.
“What the hell was that?” Clint exclaimed looking around the room to try and find the source of the light.
“What year was this again?” Steve wondered, his eyes lit up in fascination at the sight of the past.
The team looked on in amusement at the show, finding it slightly funny how Tony was reacting to a seemingly inconspicuous old lady.
“At the fact that you admitted that you didn’t quite understand what he wanted. By what we’ve seen so far I would have assumed that you would have used that moment as an opportunity to preen.” Natasha made her point and watched as Tony rolled his neck slightly in agitation before sighing.
The smile that Clint was sporting from his joke turned wicked as he thought about all the things that he could show the Thunder God. That could be even more fun than the film he thought, not aware of what was yet to come.
“Well he’s got a point there,” grinned Clint, a gleeful gleam in his eyes at Tony’s predicament. He desperately wished that he had his phone on him right now to capture this moment. Natasha huffed in agreement and the rest of the team decided that there was no harm in letting the Hulk hold Tony until Bruce came back. Although Steve did make sure that he was sitting a little bit closer to the two, a move that did not go unnoticed by a certain demi-god.
“Stop it you fool,” muttered Bruce, even though he knew that Tony was fully aware of what he has doing.
Thor and Natasha noted the flash of anger pass over Tony’s face before it was covered up.
Natasha took the armchair on Tony’s left with the only free space left in the room being on the couch with Tony. Glaring at Natasha who only smiled innocently in response, Tony watched at Steve took his place next to him, leaving barely any space between the two men since Steve wasn't a small guy by any means.
Before he could comment on the lie, Clint let out a cackle and pointed a finger at Tony in amusement. “You are one sly dog, you seriously made a joke like that in that time period and in a prison no less?!”
His question was met with silence as JARVIS failed to reply.
“Just how bad was his gambling problem?” Bruce asked.
Taking a deep breath before releasing it, Natasha began to read the words written to the rest of the Avengers.
Everyone turned to look at the super soldier in surprise to which Steve blushed in embarrassment. “My ma tried her hand at making one when I was a kid with some spare fabric, we spent the whole afternoon trying to figure it out before we gave up. It’s one of my favourite memories of her.”
Various exclamations arose from the team, ranging from loud expletives from Clint to Steve mumbling that it wasn't possible. Tony was slightly surprised at how much disbelief and shock that the team kept showing at the movie. You wouldn't have thought that this was the same group of people who had fought of an alien invasion led by a Norse God with the reactions. It wasn’t as if what was happening on the screen was anything amazing or special Tony thought bitterly, remembering how things changed so quickly, destroying any happiness he may have found back then.
“That’s a mixture of Latin and Hebrew,” Natasha noticed, recognising the sounds from her studies of languages.
Tony winced at the fact that his past actions had riled up the usually in control physicist so much, that his alter ego was in fact calmer in comparison. Bruce was never going to let him live this down or leave his sights ever.
“TIN MAN DOESN’T UNDERSTAND. TIN MAN BEING SILLY,” grumbled Hulk, having no trouble in reading the emotions and meaning behind the actions in the scene.
Half the team looked a bit green at the sight of the bugs crawling on the man’s face and it wasn’t a Hulk shade of green either.
It wasn’t the first time that Tony had considered his condition to be a result of magic since he wasn't able to remember his first life so anything was possible. Although he had never really pursued that avenue as he had always been a man of science and up until a year ago had never seen magic exist. To have Thor who was essentially a magical being say that he could possibly find out Tony’s condition made Tony feel slightly conflicted. He wanted to know why he went through life like this and why he had never met anyone else like him but after not having answers for so long, the idea of knowing scared him. What if it turned out that he had done something to deserve this?
Without any warning to the rest of the team, Hulk turned back into Bruce, with the transformation being much quicker than usual due to the calm environment. The team stared in surprise at the action, watching as Bruce once more appeared, clad only in the stretchy shorts that had been created for Hulk transformations and nothing else apart from Tony still sitting in his lap.
“That’s just nasty.” Steve looked a little pale at the dead rats which Tony found fascinating considering the guy had gone through a war. All the blood, guts and other nasty things should have given the man an iron stomach. Although in all honesty, the mechanic found everything about Steve fascinating so really he didn’t find it strange in the long run.
Bruce looked on at his friend in amazement. It was truly amazing to see the skills that his friend had but Bruce had to wonder how Tony could even operate on a day to day basis when he noticed every single tiny detail. It must be overwhelming and exhausting, yet it never showed. Not once had Tony ever shown any discomfort around the team even though in the movie it was obvious that his skills took a toll. Bruce realised that there was still a lot that Tony was hiding from them and he wasn’t sure if the movie was going to break down those barriers that Tony was keeping up.
With a teasing grin, Tony just patted the super soldier’s knee, leaving his hand there as he turned back to the film. “All in good time Cap.”
“I personally do not find the smell of putrefaction pleasant and I’m finding it difficult to understand how you do Friend Tony.” Thor’s nose was wrinkled as he witnessed how easy Tony found it to breathe in the presence of such a stench.
“And you never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity to criticise someone for something that you could have done better,” Natasha noted, easily recalling several instances where Tony had criticised or pointed out a fault during a mission.
Clint tilted his head in thought. “You do have a point there, asides from trying to reel him into helping you. Something like that would have very negative consequences for his career.”
For a moment Thor thought that he recognised the strangely drawn creature on the panel but the drawing disappeared before he could get a strong handle on the thought. He should have paid more attention to his studies like Loki did rather than skip them in favour of fighting.
Tony patted Hulk’s arm gently. “I understand you buddy. I feel the same way and I promise you that I will never leave you or Bruce and that you will always have a place here for as long as you want. No one can break that up.” Hulk smiled as he heard the honesty and love in Tony’s voice, his grip tightening as he brought his other arm around to hug the inventor closer to him. Tony reciprocated the action and clung tightly for a few seconds as the team watched fondly, patiently waiting for the future where they too could declare how Tony had helped them become a family.
Blackwood's execution arrives but he has a few words for Holmes before he goes. Some concerns are raised within the team for different reasons and Clint really hates Blackwood.
“Because of the way that you’re looking at me right now, the look that says that I’ve finally gone of the deep end so to speak. There wasn't any way to prove it to you and I haven't had good experiences in telling people. The last person that I told who I trusted explicitly accused me of witchcraft and let’s just say that it didn't end very well for me. As for how Loki found out well I most certainly didn’t tell him so don’t think that I did okay.”
“I mean that in this life I created JARVIS who is programmed with the ability to run the same simulations of fights the way that I do in my head. JARVIS is essentially an extension of myself so I wasn’t lying when I said that sort off okay?!” Tony burst out.
Tony woke with a snort, finding himself in his bedroom even though he distinctly remembered passing out on the couch in his lab.
“For a supposed genius that was a slightly childish response,” Natasha teased although she knew why the genius in question had a bad comeback.
The men except for Clint gave her a curious stare at her explanation.
Natasha sighed in in commiseration for Watson, she knew what it was like to have a partner that turned every situation upside down, darting a quick glance to Clint who waggled his eyebrows at her as he knew what she was thinking.
“Just accept your punishment Clint so we can carry on with the film,” Bruce chimed, his voice barely containing his humour at Clint’s predicament.
Clint handed over ten dollars to Natasha, whilst Natasha wore a smug look on her face that screamed I told you so.
“Wait so you guys are fully on-board the whole Tony’s lived hundreds of past lives train?” Tony interjected wanting to make sure that they really understood what he was saying.
“This is going to get worse before it gets better,” Bruce paused before turning to Tony. “It is going to get better, right?”
Once pointed out to her it became obvious as to how Natasha had recognised the body. She remembered seeing the photograph of the man from Irene’s letter. The question was now, how was Irene’s case related to Blackwood?
“Come on,” Clint urged as though he was talking to a two year old, “you can get the word out.”
Clint raised an eyebrow, stealing Natasha’s signature move for a moment. “Over react much?”
“I would like to know some time in the future Friend Tony, perhaps we could go through it chronologically as I believe that it would make more sense.” Thor sounded so sincere and earnest that Tony didn’t have it in him to say no.
Bruce picked up the case, his eyes widening as he saw the image on the case. He kept flicking his eyes from the case to Tony, not knowing what to say.
Steve ground his teeth at the wink.
“Why the hell is Loki leaving us this joke of a letter? I thought that he was locked up on Asgard!”
“No can do guys, in case you’ve forgotten but we can’t leave until we watch the film.”
Steve cringed at the loud crash as he wondered if the man was going to help Tony out of whatever predicament he’d just found himself in.
“Any bets on who he wants to see,” Clint snorted.
“So that’s what it looked like,” Tony absently mused to himself, not noticing how the other occupants of the room were freaking out.
“You had best shut your mouth now Barton before I rig your arrows to explode and set fire to your ass,” Tony threatened darkly.
“You're such a stalker,” Clint commented again.
Steve turned a disapproving glance at Tony at the sight of the theft whilst everyone else looked on either impressed with how easy Tony had taken it or with acceptance as they themselves had stolen things.
Tony sent a grateful look in Bruce’s direction which was acknowledged with a wry head shake.
“I don’t think we need to start on my sexual preferences right now,” Tony growled, only catching a brief look of anger on Steve’s face before it disappeared. Huh. Maybe Steve was just as annoyed and uncomfortable at talking about sex in a public setting he thought. That must be it Tony though with only a small amount of certainty since there wasn't any other reason why Steve would be angry at that.
“Look at sleeping beauty,” Clint cooed before ducking from a cushion thrown by Tony.
“You deliberately misread her to cast her in a bad light. That was pure jealousy right there.”
“Yeah and I’m fucking Hansel from Hansel and Gretel. Hell, we’re all fictional characters come to life, it's so obvious now!”
“What a coincidence,” drawled Thor, repeating the same words that Watson had earlier said but unlike Watson, he actually meant the words.
Seeing that the disc had been placed into the DVD player, Tony took a deep breath and pressed the play button.
“Nothing,” shot Tony too quickly for anyone to believe.
“Are you two really having a conversation whilst choking a man?” Bruce mumbled, regretting his question when he sees the look of grief pass over Tony’s face before being covered with a mask.
Hulk shook Tony gently, causing the genius to turn his head slightly to make eye contact. “WHAT WAS THE JOKE?”
“You had friends back then? As in plural?” Clint asks, his tone laced with scepticism. He loved Tony and would most definitely call him one of his closest friends, but watching him on screen, he found it difficult to believe that he endeared himself to many back then.
“What the hell?” Bruce gasped.
“Awkward,” Clint muttered at the two men.
Well, that explained why four of them were watching, leaving only Steve to explain. Tony turned to the super soldier in question, surprised to find the man in question blushing lightly.
“Of course, it just has a British accent is all.” Tony responded not understanding why she needed the clarification.
“What does VR mean?” Natasha questioned.
“Oh dear,” breathed Bruce as he tried to get his breathing under control from the earlier surprise, trying to think of how a medical doctor could misdiagnose a death.
Luckily before Natasha could inflict any bodily harm on Thor, Bruce stepped in. “I think what Thor meant to say is that it is not the fact that she is a woman. It’s the fact that with the time period and social expectations, her ability to fight and protect herself caught us by surprise.”
Steve smiled inwardly, proud that Tony wouldn’t compromise his values and morals for these men. No, Steve could tell that Tony was doing it for the girls murdered and the common people that were unfortunately put into harms way.
“I don’t think I would have been brave enough to smell that,” shuddered Steve since he had once had the unpleasant experience of drinking what he had thought was coffee in Tony’s lab. When he had spat the drink out in realisation that it wasn't coffee, he had been hesitant to ever drink anything in Tony’s lab again.
“Bruce?” Nat asked softly preparing herself for the possibility of a Hulk out.
“I do not like the sound of that,” Thor grumbled, “he should still be cowering in fear at how you have conquered and topped him!”
Bruce just stared at him wordlessly, some part of him appreciating the advanced warning and some part of him just wanted to shake some sense into his science bro.
At Natasha’s words Tony’s mouth snapped shut with an audible snap, a blush rising on his face as he watched Steve duck his head away shyly at the comment. The team knew about Tony’s feelings about Steve, he’d had to endure endless teasing from Clint about the playboy being unable to muster up the courage to ask Steve out. The only one who seemed to be unable to figure it out was the buff blond himself and Tony suspected that it was because he was from the 1940’s and therefore the idea of Tony liking Steve had never occurred to him. Alas another reason why Tony had to keep his feelings to himself.
“See,” Tony said waving his hand in the air, “JARVIS said it himself, it’s a wonder why he hasn't been made an official Avenger yet with all the work that he does.”
“Is that what you meant by history?” Clint asked with a waggling of his eyebrows.
“Eagle will you please take off your mask!” Bodies leant into the screen as the Eagle reached up to pull of his mask. A few tense moments passed as the mask was worked off and gasps spread across the room.
(See the end of the chapter for
I love writing this story but when you have to watch a scene multiple times to get the structure of the chapter and then think of different reactions without making the story repetitive and then edit the chapter, it can sometimes be a little bit off putting. Also I don't have a beta so I feel as though it takes me twice as long to try and get through certain things such as editing or remembering to add certain parts or even remembering to do the writing!
Bruce couldn't blame the men for not rushing to go into the tomb. Even he would be hesitant to go into a dark tomb that may or may not hold the body of a man who was a serial killer and used magic to accomplish such killings.
Steve flushed slightly at the sight of the glasses. For some reason whenever he saw the billionaire wearing sunglasses, it caused slightly inappropriate thoughts to run rampant through his mind. The sight of a kinda rough looking Tony with longer, shaggy hair and those glasses, well that was an image Steve was certainly going to treasure.
Clint barked out a low laugh. “Summoning? I’ve never heard kidnapping described as summoning before, appropriating or borrowing I can get behind but summoning just sounds creepy.”
Tony shifted in his seat, uncomfortable about the reasons why he usually hesitated when drinking or eating with Irene. “Drinking with Irene was mostly a game of roulette. There were several instances were things would spiral out of control if you weren’t careful.”
“I mean are you sure that the light didn't do more damage than shown or have you finally gone off the rails?”
“I didn’t need to pretend that I knew everything since I had nothing to prove. Besides at that point I wasn’t ruling anything out, so I in fact had many options which at that moment caused me to be unsure of what was happening. I wasn’t going to let my ego stand in the way of figuring something out.”
Tony huffed at the reasoning behind Watson’s conclusion. They both had known why Watson continually followed Tony and it wasn’t because of a mental condition but instead because of the brotherly bond they had.
“Don’t rub it in Tony, none of us have heard you sing before so we didn’t relate the clues back to you,” growled out Natasha in both annoyance at having been duped as well as appreciation at being out manoeuvred. “Although the colours on the wings now make sense,” Natasha finished with a quick glance at Steve.
“I believe you too, I mean I turn into a giant green rage monster so for me anything is possible. I would like to do some tests with you if that was okay, maybe another pair of eyes could prove useful.”
“You’re an alien, aren’t you?” Clint exclaimed his fingers twitching in nervousness at the thought that Tony wasn't possibly human.
“Well then,” Tony started, his voice kept carefully neutral lest he gave away his emotions. “I can’t wait to see who the lucky person is that managed to gain your respect without even showing his face.”
Maybe he could fire a repulsor blast in Loki’s face, Tony thought sullenly as he resigned himself to the fact that it was time to let the demons out of the closet.
“Fifty bucks says that it’s the other way round,” Natasha whispered back with a mischievous gleam in her eye.
“Fine,” Tony huffed, no real heat behind the word as he knew that he did.
Blackwood's origins are revealed and the plot thickens on both side of the story.
“Remember when I said that he had cost us the rent more than once,” pausing to allow the team to nod in acknowledgment Tony continued, “well more than once was about five times, so that bad.”
Tony let Clint continue his rant knowing that the archer needed to vent his disbelief. This wasn't the first time that he had told somebody but it was definitely going better than the previous times.
“We could use that image as a before and after plastic surgery advert!” Laughed Clint, who seemed to be the only one who found his joke funny.
There came his science bro who was not only accepting Tony but also offering up his help but still being respectful. Tony knew Bruce wouldn't treat him like a science experiment since Bruce wouldn't ever want anyone to go through what he had so Tony felt confident in nodding his consent to Bruce’s request. Clint who was standing next to Bruce was still shaking his head in disbelief although Tony could see that he was starting to come around to the others train of thought.
Natasha watched passively as she observed Tony using an action that he still used to this day. She wondered whether or not back then he had worn the shades to hide his emotions from the outside world like he did today.
“Well he tried to use the glow stick of destiny on me and then proceeded to throw me out of a window so I would the yay on the touching.” Tony replied.
Deciding that he had enough of the social interaction that he had been forced into, Tony started to make his way back to the elevator. However, once he reached the doors they didn’t open.
Just one person left Tony thought knowing that this person’s opinion would mean the most to him. Taking the plunge, he raised his eyes towards the buff blond and almost looked away in hurt at the way Steve was looking at him.
“You’re not going to go through this alone Tony, we’ll be here with you and will take necessary pauses if you need to take a moment, no one will judge you for that.”
Words can not express what I am feeling but I urge you all to just take a moment out of your day to be grateful and thankful for those around you and I hope that one day I can come back to this platform.
Bruce laughed. “Smooth Tony.”
Steve felt as though he couldn’t deny that, so he wisely left it and returned back to the movie, a smile tugging at the corner of his lips.
The team all appeared shocked at the display of modesty shown.
Clint yelped and jumped back from Natasha’s steel fingers. “What was that for?”
Hi everyone! I know it's been a while since I've updated but I've just stared uni and had to kind of put everything on hold as I moved to a new place and dealt with all the welcome talks and first couple of weeks. I tried to make this chapter longer as I don't know when I'll next be able to update.
He winced, and sat opposite her. “I have a tendency to open my mouth before I think.”
At one point, Tony looked over and saw the blur racing towards them.
Pepper snorted, a half laugh, half sob, squeezing his hand even tighter.
“Well, you go by Hulk, and 'Tasha's Black Widow, I've got Iron Man...”
“Mph,” he said.
Steve sighed. “Wanda,” he said quietly, “I understand that you have many reasons to be upset. But I swear that if you don't start to even try and get along, I will kick you off this team so fast, your head will spin.”
“In a different one, I was a woman. We married, you and I.”
Tony gave them a look, but took off his tunic. Immediately, the dwarf began to babble about the runes, and though Natasha didn't really understand much about what she said, Tony did, and so did Bruce. She watched, bemused, as they threw ideas around.
They still didn't know where Kou led them, but they didn't have much time to talk, either.
“Dude, really?” asked Sam.
And then he moved his hands. One hand glowed.  They were both staring at it, before they both noticed him smiling.
Bucky stopped. “Keep going, on your own. I'll keep him off ya as long as possible.”
“Complex?” he finally finished with a shrug.
“You're awake.”
And Steve smirked at him; not smiling, smirking.
Steve punched the first Nobody that tried to slash them. Tony, still feeling disoriented from the sudden drop, shook his head.
“They're too young for this,” whispered Steve.
“Yes, and since you're known for your computer skills....”
“You think this idea will work?” Rhodey asked.
~~ And everyone's looking round
“I said no. You know what? My whole damn life has been a huge shit show in front of the media, so for once in my life, I'm not going to let anyone know what happened there, except my family. And you are not my family, Fury.”
And the smirk returned.
Hawkeye sighed. “Isn't it obvious? We go around helping people who the Inquisition can't help. Defenders of justice, righters of the wrong, blah blah.”
“I'm not sure if it's a good idea to open it if you can, Tony. Who knows what'll be behind it.”
“Wait,” Sam said, then flew off.
“And so you sleep, not even aware of what goes on around you, my heart. Soon...”
“Do not make me stuff this food down your throat,” replied Natasha.
“It's pretty,” said Namine.
“Of course,” said Tony, rubbing his temples. Steve gently massaged his neck, causing the genius to slump in his chair just a little. He startled a little when Axel dropped something into his lap. Tony looked at the crystal, then up at the redhead, who shrugged a bit.
“Or, I would have just gone out and started the fight anyway,” said Tony, his voice wavering just a little bit.
“It's odd, though, right?” he said, doodling imaginary drawings on the table with his fingers to keep occupied. “They gave me the brand, so I should hate the idea. I did hate it. Hated them so much when they took me away from 'Tasha...my sister.”
“Who...?”
He looked like his father, except for the white, long hair.
“That might not  have been so bad,” replied Steve. Tony glared at him, then turned to their guest.
'If you could pick a path, what would it be?'
“Quite. Now, do be good, darlings, and try not to be too loud.”
“Out of the frying pan?” Tony said, after catching his breath.
Tony sat down. “There's more, isn't there?”
In some ways, it was good. He ordered a giant futon to place in one of the rooms, with lots and lots of pillows, so that when everyone wanted to cuddle, they could. Steve and him still slept in the same room, though they didn't discuss anything further yet. Sometimes the girls joined them, usually accompanied by Natasha, sometimes with a few others. Spiderman came to live with them, including his aunt, which was an experience all of itself to tell her what her nephew had been up to...
The girl nodded her head, and held out a hand. Inside, she held a similar trinket as to the one he had, and though a part of him realized he could be too trusting, he knew she sent him the items that led them  here.
Steve stilled, finally. Was that a bad thing? Did he say the wrong thing, again? Would they fight?
Still wide-eyed, Tony hesitantly moved close.
“If you were a genius,” she had hissed, “you wouldn't have provoked them in the first place.”
“You died. You didn't even hesitate for a moment, did you? You always put your life on the line for us, for me...you....”
“You're dead. You can't be alive.” Tony tried to move, but the more he struggled, the greater the burning.
“Captain, if that item was with him...”
Steve frowned. “Then why did you ask us?”
Xigbar's eyebrows shot upwards, his mouth opening silently, before once more they lowered. “That's not good. We'll have to find that person and...”
“I'm sorry. I should have warned you. They didn't force me to do this. I...I chose...”
The pain burned through him, like an all-consuming fever. Thoughts scattered through his mind, images he didn't understand. He reached out...
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hi,” Natasha replied. “So tell me, who did it?”
Fury cleared his throat. “If you two could please stop eye fucking, can we focus on the fact you admitted to being a mutate?”
~~Nothing's like before~~
“It's a pleasure to meet you, too, Solas. You are...a member of the Inquisition? Everything's a bit...”
Tony made a face, but began to remove the armor on his arm, wincing. Immediately, Steve began to prod and poke, ignoring the protests of the other man. Not a deep cut, and thankfully, the wrist wasn't broken, but definitely lots of bruising...
Finally, they rescue Tony
“No,” said Tony. “Absolutely not. You two are going to keep training here with Aqua and Ramuh.”
“And the rest died,” croaked Tony.
He hesitated a moment, gave a little shrugged, and dived in.
“I'm sure you'll notice the gigantic hole if we blow something up,” replied Sam, dryly.
“I find it a place that soothes me, though for others, not as much. The Inquisitor prefers to walk around, rather than sit.”
The laugh Steve gave was humorless. “I was very sick at the time. Not the healthiest individual anyway, and on top of it, lyrium as a templar...I figured I'd die anyway. Why not give my life to possibly help someone else? Maker, how stupid and idealistic. I didn't know until much later that I wasn't the first and only test subject.”
He nearly ignored the fact that red templars were surrounding them, just so he could punch that smug look off Stane's face.
“My name is Solas. I apologize for entering your dream. I was merely walking the Fade when I felt your pain.”
They didn't. Clint led him out, and then out of the mall.
“In this world, yes.”
“About fucking time!” said Bucky. Steve looked around.
Natasha snorted, once more leading him in a zigzag of streets.
Steve took Tony's hand, squeezing it.
“I don't even know who I am anymore,” said Tony, not turning. “Though Namine didn't erase my memories, she shared so much, showed me what could have been. In one world, you and I almost killed each other over Bucky, because when I found out he killed my parents, I went after him. We broke the Avengers. Because we couldn't talk.”
Natasha lowered the knife, but didn't let go.
“Each world is sealed, so you can't just randomly move between them,” said Aqua. “It's like a lock, that you can close or open. When the doors are opened, the darkness, the Heartless, can flood that world, try to take the hearts of that world.”
“That sounds familiar,” said Tony.
“Xion! They're friends!”
Steve only took two steps before everything darkened.
“He said he'd be here,” said Natasha, her whole body tense. Steve knew that she had taken it upon herself to watch over their brilliant inventor, who had the tendency to forget that taking care of the team meant also taking care of himself. After they had reformed, the two had spent hours talking
His eyes widened, and he turned. The warmth became drenched in a bucket of ice water, sprinkling down his back. Steven stood, tense, as he looked between the pair.
“Oh, that's right. Poor thing couldn't hold a staff for a week, I remember.”
“I just thought...you guys saw me as some bastard who threw money around to make people happy...”
Steve sighed, rubbing his neck. “Not particularly. We could swim to one of the larger islands, something I'm not terribly keen on, given that we have no idea where we are, what's in the water, and what we'll meet. We don't know how long or if the others can find us here...”
Steve's hands slipped under the pants to cup his ass, and then pulled them down, fingers teasing as the clothes from his lower half slide down and off.
Lightening danced across the streets, while shadows danced, and a woman, laughed, but what scared Steve the most...
“It's all right, Tony. He is...what was that title...Sorcerer Supreme. He'll find out, eventually.”
Xigbar's frown deepened. “You think it was Axel or Natasha? I know we locked that fucker out, but I could see Widow break in, and they did get Siren...”
“You mean Natasha?”
“This is my personal keyblade, Waterfall.”
“Lord Leviathan,” began Raiden.
He remembered how they began such a rocky start, how Steve...
No matter what he did, all they could ever see was a man, a smart man, who threw money at problems, who was careless, who could never love...
And then Vexen came...
The lull before the storm
“No, it's not,” he agreed. He didn't drink it, but he didn't put it down either. Slowly, he walked to the window, staring out at the endless dots and streams of light.
“Captain?” interrupted FRIDAY. “Mr. Stephen Strange is here,” she continued, and for an AI, she managed to drip enough ice to keep several drinks cold. Vision gave a small smile.
“Mmm,” said Natasha. Tony translated that to “yes, but I'm not telling.”
“Because we didn't look bad enough as we are, now let's give us more power,” said Sam, bitterly.
“Though perhaps not always the wisest decision, it is sometimes the truer response. To put you at ease, I agree with you. We need the Circles. What I am curious is your full stance on the matter that was rudely interrupted by that disdainful outburst.”
“The Avengers, of course.
“I thought to myself, this bond we have, this gift I've been given, to share everything with you, your pain and happiness and everything in between, is more important than any ceremony. Close your mouth, Tony. I'm not done. It's more important, more precious than anything, but I want to marry you, too.
“Sir. Shall we?”
Tentatively, she handed him what looked like a wayfinder, made of shells he had never seen before, with a face drawn on one of them.
They had plenty of time to practice with the new toys. A few bandits decided to attempt to rob them, but overall, Clint and Natasha made sure the area before them remained clear of animals.
“You were hurt,” mumbled Tony. He thought nobody heard. Stupid him...
“We tried to kill each other,” Tony gritted out. “You went with Bucky...”
“I'm sorry?” he tried.
Silently, they took out the pack.
It didn't help that Xion called a keyblade hours after the first meeting, a massive thing, taller than she was, simplistic, except that the metal looked like molten hematite.
“Then we better hurry up, Anthony,” replied Steve, shield in hand.
Steve sighed, and went back to making breakfast.
Tony touched it, feeling a familiar warmth spread through him, calling to a part of him. It was part of the mixture of blood given in his infusion, the fire that seeped in his veins.
~~That nothing is whole, and nothing is broken~~
"G'night."
But the more time they spent, the greater the chance of discovery. He prayed they didn't dispose of her as they did that other Howard.
He knew that they should rest, after everything,  just sleep.
Strange cleared his throat. “Quite. And powerful.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve took a breath, gave Tony just a bit of a smile, and removed his shirt.
“I wish I wasn't. When a person has their soul heart stolen, they become creatures of darkness, Heartless, searching for another heart.”
~~You're giving me too many things~~
~~In you and I there's a new land~~
~~Just open your eyes...~~
“We're allowed to help you get as far away as possible, except Bruce for obvious reasons, and to distract Steve if you need to get away. We're not restricted like you are, and can use any non-lethal weapons and attacks against him, and no damage to buildings and/or people. Once he's beaten us, and he will, we can no longer help you.”
“You'll probably be in the thick of things,” said Tony. “It would be bad if you got killed.”
“So there needs to be options for those people.”
“I thought about adding something new into their lives. Really brings people together...”
Vivienne and Natasha are a force to be reckoned with, just so you know. :)
He jumped out of the Quinjet, to the muffled cursing of a few of his teammates, but he felt the need to run.
The game was almost done.
“Bring it on, old man.”
The sound of the fork lightly tapping the plate followed this statement. Steve glared at Clint, even as he continued with the plate abuse.
“If this is the afterlife, I'm not enjoying it.”
After a pause, Steve said softly, “May I talk to you in my quarters privately, Tony?”
~An unbreakable connection...~
“And don't worry about the media,” replied Pepper. “It'll be taken care of. I'll be there, too.”
Sometimes, they would give silly little plays, sometimes, they'd fight with wooden swords, but sometimes, they remained silent, curled up together, as Maria sang to them, trying to sooth their pains.
Natasha merely smirked when he tried to pry the information.
“Hey, buddy.”
His heart raced as they flew silently, the news telling very little. He just wanted to tell Tony sorry, to hold him, know he was alive...
“'Tasha...” said Tony, reaching up for her arm. To be honest, he was somewhat flattered at Bull's interest, and very scared. Sure, he had played in the Circle a bit, before Meredith came along and sucked the life out of all of them, but Bull looked like he could snap his neck in two without effort. Not that Tony couldn't flambe him, but not so soon after getting his powers back.
“Kingdom Hearts...it can't be all dark or all light, if its made of the Hearts of worlds and people.”
The smile he got, even if his heart still felt heavy, was worth this evening...
'So this is how I die,' Tony thought, as everything fell away, fading into gentle arms.
“It's bad luck to see me in the wedding dress before time, Steve,” Tony said.
“This is oddly adorable,” admitted Pepper, as Tony did his best to hide his face.
His heart pounding, Steve opened the note.
“No way,” he said. “No matter where we go or do, I'll always find a way back to you guys, no matter how long it takes.”
“Captain?” asked Leliana.
Steve tensed, felt a wave of confusion and panic roll over him from Tony, though the man remained still and silent. How many emotions did Tony hide, rolling through him, threatening to sweep him under, and never showing anything on his face.
"You couldn't've said something?"
They only paused for a few moments before walking onto the roof.
Again.
And then they go back home to find Fury and Agent Coulson at the entrance to their home. Silently, begrudgingly, they let them in.
“Yes! I'm a mage, so I wished to talk to her about some runes.”
“And will all the Avengers learn this magic, keep it to themselves?”
Xigbar saluted.
“Tony?”
Thank goodness he hadn't entirely slacked on training...
He turned the boot around in his hand, not looking at his sister.
“I ask myself that every day,” Steve mumbled, and then continued to make breakfast for two.
Steve never felt quite as useless as he did now. Even when they fought any sort of magic, he could always fight back in some way, whether fists or shield. Now, he could only watch as Wanda and Dr. Strange tried to track Tony.
The idea, or so she understood, was to fix the physical damage. Perhaps Vexen thought Namine rewrote his memories, and therefore wanted to make him an even more powerful fighter.
“You should have left me, 'Tasha,” said Tony again. “How many times did we get in trouble because you wouldn't leave me?”
In seconds, he was gone...
“You can't fix the shit that happened in Kirkwall,” said Natasha.
~~Whatever lies beyond this morning...~~
Everyone watched Fury, who in turn looked at each member of the Avengers, plus Pepper.
Steve and Tony have a talk...
“Oh....” A shy smile that Steve hadn't ever seen, sweet, unsure... “Okay...”
Still, the man understood, somewhat. They didn't have time to dally.
The feeling that something was behind him, and he whirled around. The creature was all darkness, shadows, and sorrowful, downcast eyes, looming over him.
“Phoneix, Raiden, peace,” came another voice, and the command immediately calmed Kou, who landed on Tony's shoulder.
One held the arc reactor, and his hand immediately went to his chest. He felt just a bit relieved to feel it in his chest. The middle cradled Bucky's bionic arm, and the last...
Steve had to hand it to the creators that the chilling introduction drew the player in, with it's eerie imagery, and hauntingly sad music. Creating a character was fun, and though the enemies were a bit irritating, it didn't seem too bad...
“Since you know about this game, what are the rules? Other than me not being allowed to use my armor.”
Good thing Tony loved his beds several sizes larger than normal....
The hint of a smile returned to her lips. “I've heard about you, and your skills with runes. You may be young, but you aren't stupid, either.”
“Forgive me. My given name is Adaar, but many call me The Hulk. I was going to be on security duty at the Conclave, but I had a bit of a mishap. Lucky of me, really, but I felt that since I survived, I should join in the fight with the Inquisitor. You two are new?”
“Yes, I slept. You were crying in the middle of the night, but eventually you calmed down. The healers were concerned for a bit.”
Tony tilted his head, confused at the sudden change in topic, but called it to his hand. Bucky leaned forward, a grin on his face.
Steve continued to hold Tony.
Feeling the warmth that spread through him, mixed with the coldness of sorrow, the hint of surprise...and they pulled apart, staring at each other...
“Steve? There's a bottle in the water....it looks like there's a message in it.”
They landed, surrounded by the darkness, but at least they fell together.
In lyrium. On Steve.
Before he could say a word, Xion grabbed another donut, and ran.
“You remember the darkness?” asked Steve.
After the man left, Edax stood up, striding to a door. His pet Nobody, a creature in the shape of a white lion, followed him down the hallways. He entered the freezing room, carefully making his way to the figure in the center, encased in ice.
Steve gave Dr. Strange a bit of credit for not faltering too much when all the team and Pepper simply stared at him as he entered.
“Don't make me sing the song, Steve. I will do it, if I have to.”
Natasha finished bandaging his arm, kissed Tony's forehead, then pulled Vision outside the door.
“Yeah. You seem like me,” said Axel. “Fire is part of your element, if I'm any judge. And she's a good sort, needs a good home...”
“You say you know what's going on?” asked Rhodey.
For now, he would leave the practice for later. He could still use magic, could even focus the energy in his gauntlets, so that would suffice for now.
Writer's block+mood+computer being a pain.....
“We have to get out of here,” said Strange, blasting a creature back.
“You flirt a lot with me,” came the interruption, “but I don't know if you mean it, or it's just a defense mechanism.”
“A door,” he repeated. Light filtered from the entrance to the cave, and Phoenix flared her tails. At the other corner of the cave was indeed a door. It seemed almost drawn on to the rock, and yet...
Being alive...
“Well, I did have an idea,” said Axel. “Which involves sneaking into Castle Oblivion and hacking into their system.”
“Nat's down,” he said, as they walked quickly. “Apparently she decided to get a cheeseburger with Steve.”
And Tony was pulled down into darkness...
“But...” he was silenced with a kiss. Tony frowned at him. “You can't just kiss me to make me shut up.”
“You can ignore it if you want, but it isn't going to disappear. You've already attracted the Nobodies, so it's only a matter of time.”
“Fuck,” replied Tony. “He's on his way.”
He had always thought there was no other survivors of that particular experiment, just Fenris, who he had the displeasure of meeting a few times. He didn't judge him, knowing the story behind the Lyrium Ghost...
~~I wish I could prove I love you~~
“They better have my cheeseburger,” mumbled Tony, even as they continued to leap and fly across the roofs.
Steve was surprised when the door opened. Slowly, he opened it, not sure what to expect.
Well, Strange did say it was magic...
“Clint!”
“Yes,” said Aqua, placing the box of bagels on the table, opening it and removing some cream cheeses, her back fully turned to them. She didn't seem nervous that some of the Avengers carried weapons. Tony and the girls moved to the table.
“You'll go away, like mama and papa,” whispered Namine, hiding her face.
Tony almost wished they didn't.
A few of the Chargers snickered.
"Goodnight, Tony."
Tony lay upon the ground, staring at the ceiling, and attempting to figure out if getting up really was worth it.
“Wait...what? Invaded by Dark Spirit PrplHwk? What?”
Natasha noticed Rook tapping the table, slightly agitated.
“In my world,” he continued, “you died. That...monstrosity in your chest...you never got that. The shrapnel killed you before you could stop it. But now that I'm here, I will make you into something better, something stronger.”
A chuckle, then, “Hey...can you wake up just a bit?”
“You mean 'Doctor' Strange?” asked Bruce, his own smile on his lips.
If Steve hadn't seen some of it for himself, he didn't hold Tony in his arms now in, what he understood, was his esper form, he wouldn't believe it.
“Do you...you want to go back?” Tony asked, softly. “I'm not really...really related, though...but...”
Tony stared at him as if the man grew another head. Or maybe lost in the Fade...
“Aqua's right,” said Steve. The Captain dragged him out. “You're too focused on trying to force things, instead of giving them time.”
They didn't wait to fight the hoard. They pushed their way through and kept running.
“And we're going up for...what? The Quinjet?”
“You goddamn sap. C'mon. Let's find our way home!”
“Tony?” came the question, with a soft caress on his face.
In the corner of the Hall, a small group of individuals were talking. Bruce stood with them, and so did the gorgeous Steven. Anthony rubbed his chest, feeling his heart speeding up just a little. It had been years since he felt anything, and what seemed so easy before felt nearly overwhelming.
“Who's 'they?'” asked Wanda.
Tony decided that though Aqua didn't curse, her anger was far more scary than an angry Fury.
“It's all right. We were just going to have a nice chat, weren't we, Steven?” Tony asked. Steve hummed in response.
Ramuh nodded. “Yes, that is one of our names. We have been called many things; esper, aeon, monsters, just to name a few.”
They saw a being zing-zag over to their player, and smash down with a giant hammer. Tony tried to evade. It took less than a minute before “You Died” appeared.
“I don't know who she was,” said Tony, softly, again, after they had been questioned. “I wasn't lying. She didn't say anything. Just kept laughing...killing people...I couldn't do anything...Steve, I couldn't do anything again. I failed again.”
It didn't always work, they discovered. They'd talk about whatever came to mind, how much they hated some of the other scientists, how magic worked, their old home...
“That's good. I need not remind you what will happen if you harm him, Captain?”
“It'll be hard to swing it around,” said Kairi.
Tony's eyes went to the star on Steve's chest, then up, to meet his eyes.
“Boss is...in his room...”
Or perhaps that was the power of her glare, something that she couldn't really perform properly with her eyes blurred with tears.
Natasha got the drinks, carrying a tray of the drinks easily. Tony tapped his fingers on the table top, numerous ideas racing through his head, armor and weapons at the forefront. Not for the first time, he thought he should carry paper and ink to write notes. Of course, he'd get distracted and would lose most of it anyway.
“I’d pay money to see that,” crowed Clint, “and then I could take a turn!”
“See, that was impolite,” Tony pointed out happily, glad that he could prove he did have some form of manners.
Steve’s opinion of the woman dipped down even further.
“Shakespeare, Henry V, interesting choice of words,” Bruce noted recognising the words from his time in high school.
“Do you always have to go around and provoke people in authority? Natasha asked Tony, a small grin on her face as she remembered the last time he had made a fool out of officials.
“Crap” Tony said realising that he couldn't keep up the charade anymore. Silently cursing Loki, Tony took in the faces of the people who had become more than a team to him over the year and wishing that they wouldn't hate him for what was about to be revealed.
“I liked to have a friendly fight sometimes and it earned me some money on the side,” Tony defended. Only Thor nodded his understanding since he took it as another way of sparring. The others were doubtful that this was a friendly fight due to the look on the other mans face but declined to say anything.
The Avengers let out a collective gasp as it was confirmed that Blackwood was indeed no longer dead. Natasha noticed that the man in the coffin looked oddly familiar but she couldn't quite place where she had seen him before.
“I think that I can speak for everyone hear when I say that we understand where you're coming from and that even though the circumstances weren't ideal, we’re glad that we know the truth.”
Tony broke into a smile at her words, mostly in happiness but partly in relief that the assassin wasn't going to give him an ass whopping.
Tony recognised the gesture and shot a thankful look in Steve’s direction at the distraction.
“The animal does not look impressed with either of you,” Thor laughed.
“Did you not see my landing during the 2010 Stark Expo?” Tony responded with narrowed eyes.
Tony looked almost proud of the way Irene had handled herself on screen. “Did you guys seriously think that she couldn't handle herself. She’s a criminal for Thor’s sake!”
“Yep," Tony replied. “Construction began in 1886 and it officially opened in 1894. It really was quite remarkable engineering for the time when you consider the factors and skills used."
“He has a point there,” Natasha remarked, not in the least bit surprised at the looks the men gave her in return. “Come on, how many of us have been dead or presumed dead, only to come back stronger than ever?”
“He was a veteran of the Second Afghan War and even though he survived he suffered some trauma to his leg that resulted in the limp that you can see.”
“Fine,” Tony sighed. “What’s the DVD called anyway?”
“We had a pretty good system going on by that point, more friends than colleagues. Our banter was a big part of our friendship and it seemed to normally happen at inopportune moments,” Tony breathed his eyes becoming slightly glassy with unshed tears.
“Why do I get the feeling that whatever you’re going to find or do will exceed his ten minute limit?” Bruce asked Tony with a raised eyebrow.
“Huh,” was all that Tony said at the sight of the costume before the singing began.
“Tony, why does that man look like you and who is Sherlock Holmes?” Steve asked, his eyes pleading with Tony to explain the situation truthfully.
Unbeta'd so all mistakes are my own.
Steve breathed in awe at the sight before him. “It’s amazing,” he whispered at the sight of history, receiving a puzzled glance from Tony.
“Basically a chromatic scale has twelve pitches which are semi tones apart, they are equally spaced. Atonal is ignoring conventional harmonies and lacks a tonal centre. So what he’s discovered is that following something regimented elicits no response whereas playing something that does not follow a set key or tone causes the order of the flies.”
"Screw waiting to see the crow again," Natasha began, “I may just shoot you now.”
Finally, today is my birthday (cheers to being 24!) so here's a new chapter as my gift to all of you! It's not the best chapter since I haven't written in who know how long but it felt good to get back into it and further the story in a way that I hadn't planned. This story is officially of hiatus but I don't know how often I'll update but I do have new plans for the direction of this story.
“Yeah man,” Clint added taking the focus off Bruce. “I mean Nat and I are trained to spot that kind of thing and you totally got one over on us.”
Clint turned to Natasha. “Even Budapest wasn’t as bad as that!”
Tony chuckled in response. “That was polite Steve.”
“Well now that we have that sorted, how about letting Bruce come back out to play?” Tony asked, slightly uncomfortable with the show of emotion as he tried to extricate himself out of the Hulk’s lap as carefully as possible.
Thor found himself grinning at the word, making a mental note to use it on a daily basis.
“You most certainly have not changed much Friend Tony,” chuckled Thor.
“What the hell is that?” Tony asked as he came up from his lab after reviewing and signing off on paperwork that Pepper had dropped off.
Let me know what you would prefer!:)
Tony only smiled sadly in confirmation, knowing that his reaction back then hadn’t been to thank Watson. He realised now that in many ways he had taken Watson for granted and wished he had shown his appreciation and thanks for the man much more often.
I will really try to get the next chapter up with the next few weeks even if its a small chapter.
“I’m surprised,” smirked Natasha, her eyes alight as she took in the scene.
Tony stood up and took a deep bow at the praise. All of a sudden, his arms started flailing as he was pulled back down by Steve with an exasperated smile.
Until next time!
The costume easily recognisable as the animal that it was meant to be except with a few changes to the colour of the feathers on the wings. Instead of the usual tones found on eagles, the wings of this singer were in beautiful shades of red and blue, interspaced with white and on the very tips were flecks of gold.
I'm not completely happy with this chapter as some part of me feels like its kind of a filler but I've been sitting on it for two days and haven't changed it so I decided to just release it.
Thank you all so much for the response to the last chapter, reading and replying to all your comments has really made my day after a hard shift at work :)
Tony interrupted before Clint could finish the question. “You ever call me that and I will destroy you.” The mechanic’s voice contained a slight trace of amusement but underneath lay a slightly dangerous undercurrent.
“JARVIS,” Tony began, drawing the attention of the Avengers to himself, “would you be a dear and open the doors for me?”
Steve looked at Tony as though he was a complete stranger that he didn't know how to interact with.
Poor Steve right? Don't worry he'll be set on track as soon as Tony comes to terms with his own emotions which means he'll have his own revelations soon enough ;)
Tony shrugged. “I don’t remember.”
“I could have told you that,” Bruce muttered darkly, his brain conjuring the unwanted memories of his drunk father’s lack of coordination when inebriated. Unfortunately though his father didn’t have any issues with coordination when laying a hand on someone else.
Clint growled lowly, his fingers twitching for his bow and arrow. “I just want to put an arrow right between those bushy eyebrows."
Tony barked out a laugh at Bruce’s comment, not explaining why he found the comment about a random stranger funny.
Catching Natasha’s smirk, Tony smiled. He had a feeling he knew what the master assassin was thinking and began preparing himself for the observations she would be making on him as he knew that the fact he had been able to play her irked her a little.
“No one is blaming you for anything Thor, it’s just that its caught us by surprise since we thought that if he ever escaped he would attack and not leave us a cryptic message. Speaking of the message Tony do you know what he was talking about when he said that you were keeping something from us?” Steve interjected trying to get a handle on the situation.
Steve noticed Tony’s reaction and he too felt something in his body. A feeling that had intensified from the dinner scene although he still couldn’t put a name to it. Of course there would be someone else that captured his attention and it would be a stunningly beautiful woman.
“I thank Franklin for that one,” Tony recalled absently, his eyes slightly unfocused as he remembered something the team were not privy to. Natasha shared a concerned glance with the team and wondered how the film was taking a toll on Tony. They had no idea what the man was thinking as he watched this since he was capable of fooling everyone.
Tony felt his heart freeze at those words even as he fought to keep a smile on his face. It would do no good for the team to see how much those five words hurt him. “It’s not a crush,’ growled Steve, although his still blushing cheeks and avoidance of anyone’s eyes caused no one to believe him.
“Nope,” was all he said, ignoring the looks of disbelief in response.
“So what would you do if someone truly angered you?” Natasha asked as a faint spike of fear went though her at the thoughts.
Hope you enjoyed it :)
“In many lives I did,” Tony commented absently.
Thor was still slightly confused with Midgard’s weight system but he gathered by the looks on his teammates faces that half a tonne was quite significant.
“I was just returning his property!”
“In simplest terms, the Lord Chief Justice represents the views of the country to Parliament as well as being the highest judge in the system outside of the Supreme Court and Lord Chancellor. He held a lot of power and had a lot of connections that would have made him a very important man.” Tony answered with a faint tone of disgust in his voice.
“Still,” Clint continued as Bruce figured out another piece of the Tony puzzle, “you thought that you could scare him out of commitment with lace doilies and china figurines?”
“You’re going to need a lot more wine,” laughed Clint.
Tony remembered Watson’s attitude on the way to the grave yard. The man had barely uttered a word in the carriage, angry at Tony for manipulating him into coming and angry at the thought that Blackwood was possibly still alive. Many people thought that Tony had been the one to be feared when angry when in actually fact it had been Watson, since he was much harder to anger. Tony had learned that the hard way during their first encounter. Luckily though they worked past that event and became best friends but it still made Tony wary.
“She didn’t take any of your crap, did she?” crowed Clint, his eyes alight with humour.
Recognising the statement as a half truth, Steve put a stop to the questioning before more truths came out that he didn’t want to hear. “Let’s just watch the movie,” he growled ignoring the looks of concern. He just wanted to finish watching the movie so that he could go and deal with his broken heart.
“And the winner of season two of The Masked Singer is… Eagle!” The team whooped and clapped at the result, happy that their favourite had won and now anxiously waiting for the reveal of the one that had captured the ‘respect’ of their Captain.
“Why do you speak like that Friend Tony? Is there something that ails you?”
Tony exited his bedroom and made his way to the elevator that would take him to the communal floor, JARVIS already having the door open without Tony’s prompting. He was just going to go down, show everyone that he was alive and steal some coffee. He wasn't in the mood for socialising today and just wanted to be left alone for a couple of hours with some heavy metal pounding down his ears.
“Let it be known that the best fish and chips will always be in England,” Tony pointed out, his stomach giving a slight rumble at the thought of battered fish. Maybe once the film was finished he could take a quick trip to London to satisfy his cravings.
Clint noted the way Tony called Blackwood dangerous. Sure the man had killed five women and he didn't want to belittle that but he had been easily stopped by Holmes and Watson alone, how did that equate to dangerous?
“Is he reading something from the Bible?” Steve questioned, trying to recall his Catholic upbringing, but drawing a blank.
Bruce just sighed and raised an eyebrow at Tony sitting in his lap with no shame and a beaming smile. “What did I miss?

Steve cleared his throat, breaking the little bubble that Tony and Hulk had seemingly fallen in. “Not that Tony didn’t have the comments coming,” Steve received a dirty look from Tony to which it was ignored, “but do you think you could let him go so that we can continue the movie?”
Tony nodded. “Revelations.”
“He insulted your honour,” Thor grumbled in a serious tone at the disrespect of his shield brother.
“So many questions right now,” Clint moaned, trying to curb his desire to sprout question after question at Tony. Seriously the suspense at not knowing what exactly was going on was starting to take it’s toll on his impulse control.
“It’s a little weird,” Clint said a goofy smile beginning to lighten up his face, “but I fully expect to hear stories from those past lives, I bet that you totally used a bow and arrow since you didn't have any fancy technology!”
“It was complicated,” was all Tony said, signalling the end of the conversation.
That being said, I finally forced myself to finish this chapter and move on with the movie which will hopefully kickstart me back into writing as it's a new scene and chapter.
“Because back then Lord’s had a higher social standing than most and were therefore seen to be better than the common criminal. The fact that the murders were committed by him made the case a lot more intriguing although because he was a Lord most of the attention was on him afterward and not the women that he murdered.” Tony replied bitterly at the memory, feeling angry for the women who were forgotten, to be associated with a killer in the history books.
“Well let’s go get our drink on then, who wants to hear about my life as a man named Charlie Chaplin?”
Bruce started the calming breaths that Tony suggested earlier, his thoughts half focused on keeping the rising anger at the movie at bay.
“Nanny,” Tony hissed at the sight of the woman, visibly recoiling from the screen.
“Ding dong the witch is dead,” Clint proclaimed, his voice imitating that of a munchkin.
Anybody still out there?
“Indeed,” Thor agreed. “Although I am at a loss at to why it was your last case together when you both work well with each other.”
Natasha recognised that tactic for what it was. “You just wanted to catch them off guard instead of the other way around.”
Receiving mumbles of yeah’s around the room, Steve teared his gaze away from Tony and resumed the film.
A stab of shame shot through Thor as he linked that statement to what he had said about Loki being adopted on the Helicarrier as well as his Father’s deception of Loki’s parentage. He had spent much time reflecting on his brother’s (and he will always be his brother no matter what Loki says) in light of having his true heritage be hidden due to shame and fear of a society. Not that other people’s actions and beliefs excuse what both Loki and subsequently Blackwood’s did, the thunder god mused solemnly, but it did help to understand what led them to seek a darker path.
“I pretty much make a name for myself in every life, it’s not intentional, it just seems that something out there forces me into situations where I literally become a household name,” Tony shrugged his shoulders as if to say what could he do about it.
“Explain,” Natasha commanded, her arms folded in a no nonsense type of way, obviously not in the mood for games.
“Not anymore,” she mumbled under her breath which only caused more puzzled looks to be sent her way. “The Romanov’s ruled Russia for just over four hundred years until 1917. In 1918 the main members of the Romanov family were murdered and the rest were exiled. I happen to be a descendant of one of the men who was exiled and I do carry the family name but any claim to royalty is long gone.”
Natasha smiled sadly. “It’s not something that you can casually bring up in a conversation. Besides we’re all allowed to have some secrets, even if they do have to come to light at some point.”
“I watch it to learn more about your race and your traditions and hope to learn enough to take this back to Asgard with me!” At this, the Asgardian turned to give Tony a cheeky grin and wink, that Tony couldn’t help to chuckle at as he imagined a group of hardened Asgardian warriors dress up in what they consider to be costumes in front of Odin.
“It’s the truth Clint. My life is something you would call unusual. I’m not over a hundred years old for one, I was called Sherlock in the 1800’s but I was born in 1970.”
“See!” exclaimed Clint, pointing dramatically at the screen. “I’m not the only one who jumps to the conclusion that Tony isn’t human when faced with the facts!”
“You need to get up Tony, all you need to do is get up and out the way,” Steve pleaded in desperation, missing the way that Tony looked at him with a soft, adoring expression.
(See the end of the chapter for
Every member of the team sent a glare at Tony at the reminder of his experiments of Gladstone. “He was never harmed and was my dog too,” Tony sighed in response.
“Deal.”
All eyes turned to Tony whilst Tony’s eyes turned to Thor.
The team minus Tony gasped at the sight of the ‘dead’ dog, shooting Tony dark looks. Tony just shook his head and pointed at the screen.
“TIN MAN IS STUPID. PUNY BRUCE AND HULK NEED TIN MAN. WILL ALWAYS NEED TIN MAN.”
“Is that who I think it is if I remember the stories right?” Bruce asked to Tony.
“I just like the singing,” Steve mumbled refusing to meet anyone’s eyes. Tony raised an eyebrow, doubting that was the reason and turned back to the team to find them grinning at Steve’s expense.
“Holy Hannah,” Clint murmured, shocked at the level of hostility shown in such a small encounter.
Natasha smirked at the safe hidden behind the painting. “That’s the first place any thief would search for money.”
“Say that you are telling the truth then why didn't you tell us this before?” Natasha asked breaking her silence to ask the question that Tony had been dreading for fear that the team wouldn't understand his reasoning for keeping it a secret.
“Indeed, Watson seemed like a fine soldier, he would have made a great addition to any team,” Thor boomed. Thor received a glowing smile from Tony at the compliment.
Bruce grimaced in thought at the idea of what Tony could get up to if left to his own devices.
“Back then my observation skills were unparalleled. By noticing a few tiny details, I was able to calculate the odds of a situation and predict the most likely outcome.” Tony explains, not thinking anything extraordinary of it.
I was informed yesterday that my best friend who I met at uni in September 2017 and have spent the past two and a half years being inseparable with passed away in an unfortunate accident yesterday. The past 24 hours have been some of the worst hours of my life and I can not find it in myself to write when my world has completely changed.
“A distraction is always good,” nods Natasha in approval.
“So you can take a moment to think about what your drinking before you actually put it in your body” Bruce observed.
“Oh come on Cap, you’re all thinking the same thing, the Genius Billionaire Playboy Philanthropist can now add Madman to his resume because there is no way he is over a hundred years old.”
All mistakes are my own so happy reading!
“Like he could have stopped me,” Tony muttered.
The two parted and smiled at each other, Steve’s eye sparkling with love and affection. “I had been hoping it was you as I felt bad for having a crush on the Eagle when I had feelings for you. I just felt this connection to him and everything about him reminded me of you, from the colours on his wings to when he said that pineapple on pizza was his favourite just like you. That day when you let me into your lab was the day that I knew that I couldn’t live without you, you were willing to help me learn and it wasn’t the world that I was in awe off, it was you Tony. At how you were everything that I had hoped that future would be, I love you too Tony, but I never knew how to come out and say it.”
Thor felt his anger rise at the sight of the sophisticated coffin. Why should such a lowlife get an upscale burial when he had committed such atrocities? If his crimes had taken place on Asgard then he would have been stripped of his title and denied his resting place with his ancestors.
“What is in your top five then?” Bruce asked as he adjusted his glasses. Ducking his head as his cheeks flushed slightly, Tony mumbled something that the team couldn't quite catch.
“The music is pretty catchy by the way,” Clint remarked, a dead serious look on his face, provoking a laugh out of Tony at the randomness of the statement. The rest of the team joined in after a few seconds, relishing in the opportunity to laugh. They weren't sure if they would get the chance to again during the film.
“Shouldn’t you be pointing that evidence out to the officers?” Thor questioned, confused at Tony’s lack of following the chain of evidence, especially as Thor had strictly been told that on missions he was to report any evidence he found.
Secondly this story hit over 400 kudos, so another big thank you as I didn't think that this was going to be something that people were interested in.
“That would do it then,” Steve said with a wince, as he knew what men went through during times of war.
“Maybe because they’re about to execute someone?” Clint answered, slightly baffled as to why Steve even needed to ask.
“He didn't even blink an eye at your antics,” Natasha mused, impressed with how well Watson seemed to deal with said antics.
Until next time :)
"How the hell did you survive a ship running over you?!” Clint demanded, trying to get his heart to slow down from all the commotion on the screen.
As promised the next chapter before Friday!
He had sworn to himself that he would never let himself feel this way about another group of people after what happened with Moriarty, but he couldn’t deny that the group of people surrounding him had somehow wiggled their way into his long closed off heart without him realising.
“Mainly the direction of the scuffs and the amount of imprints in the area,” answers Tony, remembering feeling impressed that Watson had been the one to point out the fault. “Also there were several shoe prints in the area that corresponded to the officer’s shoes and due to the amount, any evidence that once laid there was erased.”
Tony gave Hulk a grin that promised the answers to many of life’s unanswered questions. “It’s a very distinctive bump.”
Thor opened his mouth to question the meaning of the musical phrases when Natasha answered the unspoken question.
Turning back around to face the Avengers who were in various stages of tension from watching Tony fail to contact JARVIS, he was about to inform the team of what he knew about the situation so far, when a bright flash of green light exploded within the room. All of the occupants let out a yell that comprised of a mixture of shock and pain as the light surprised them all.
Hulk didn’t like the sound of that type of relationship. “DOESN’T SOUND NICE. MORE LIKELY TO GET HURT THAT WAY.”
The question of Blackwood's state is answered and Steve has a strange kink for Tony in sunglasses.
