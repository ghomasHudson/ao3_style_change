“Why did you say yes?”
The Avengers were adored by not just their city but by the whole Greecian world. No heroes had defeated so many monsters so easily before. They were paid by the city, given gifts of gold, and earned royalty money. The people of New Thebes City had even built the Avengers a huge villa that branched off their already existing training yard. For The Avengers had become quite the superstars.
Steve explained what had happened and then the two talked everything over. Tony told Steve about his involvement in Loki’s plan; and Steve told Tony all about Peggy and his acceptance of her death. Afterwards they just laid with each other.
When Tony eventually returned home from his time in Hel, he was ready to combat Steve. Ready for whatever argument Steve may have at Tony’s running away. However he was just met with a smile and a genuine question of “are you feeling better now?”
“Oh great goddess!” Maria moaned from the floor. “I know you,” She broke off to allow a sob to work it’s way out, “You mean this as a gift. But-” She shook her head still not looking back up at Tony. “But this is almost a punishment!”
Natasha and Bucky shared a glance at each other then both of them turned back to Steve. The three seemed to be having a conversation with their eyes. Bucky and Nat would glance at Tony, back to Steve, towards the fog around them, then back to Tony and then Steve. Meanwhile Steve would soften his eyes then harden them and minutely shake his head.
“You tell him!” Bucky cheered.
The funeral procession was a blur. Steve felt like he lived in a fog and no matter what he did he couldn’t clear it. The only solid memory he had was being led into her bedroom where her now still body laid. He had cried over her. He knows he spoke but he couldn’t quite remember what he said. He does remember her ring. For awhile he just held her hand, not being strong enough to remove it. Finally, as he was leaving he had removed it and it felt like he had gotten sucker-punched.
“Who’s Ana?” Steve asked.
“Though it is odd the guy has a statue of Lord Loki.” Clint mused as he shovelled eggs into his mouth. Natasha smacked his arm for talking with his mouth full. “Ow! Damn woman!”
Loki appeared unconvinced and the Avengers appeared ready to draw their weapons.
“Really?”
“Please hurry back.” Bruce urged looking at Thor.
“With all due respect I think I will have to-”
Tony blinked and did a quick glance of everyone in the room. They all tried to look as if they weren’t watching them, save for Thor who openly watched them with a smile on his face.
Thor’s grin faltered “What were you looking for?”
1. Poor Sam. In MCU he’s roped into fighting basically the whole government and in here he’s roped into standing against the god of the dead.
Steve didn’t want to get married. They were young, there was so much they could do, so much they could still explore and yet marriage seemed like a rock to have tied to your back. A chain. Steve loved Tony, but he wasn’t ready for a commitment of that magnitude.
After the first year and a half, Tony and Loki had gotten somewhat used to their new normality. Tony’s tasks continued to be minimal, take care of Loki’s favored pets and serve Loki wine. He also did a lot of cleaning and putting stuff away in the rooms Loki ordered him to. However he was under no circumstances allowed into Loki’s private chambers.
Clint shrugged and popped some berries into his mouth. “I just realized we never got your last name.”
The next big announcement came from Jan who announced her and her long time boyfriend Hank were moving to England. She said it wouldn’t be long, a year at most. She had a fashion show lined up and Hank would do some research that involved European insects. She even gave them all preshow tickets that she had made up herself since the actual show wasn’t scheduled yet. However she promised them all a seat and since her and Tony both owned their own jets and homes in Europe everything but the date was arranged. So even though the group lost one, things still carried one. Then another surprising development was announced, Pepper and Happy began dating. Tony -who had been helping Happy try to woo Pepper unsuccessfully; until Steve came in and gave some actual helpful advice- had been ecstatic when they had told everyone.
“...No.” Loki answered and his whole body sagged, confirming Tony’s suspicion.
“Um...sure.” Tony smiled and gave a one-shoulder shrug.
“Well that's the difference between being a god and a witch, isn’t it.” Tony commented flippantly and Amora’s anger rose.
Good gods, Tony wished he was back in Hel.
“Well we only know his first name so maybe you have heard of him. We just don’t know it yet.” Sam put in, earning a nod of agreement from Clint.
“I know you don’t want to do this.” Loki said not unkindly but not warmly either, the result was more of an awkward tone. Loki couldn’t see but he knew the brunette rolled his eyes. “But if you do this for me. If you bring me Steve Roger’s weakness,” He handed Tony the pot and the human instinctively grabbed it. “I will give you what you crave most in the entire cosmos...” Tony looked at the pot, this one only had Steve’s face painted on it.
“Anything?”
Sam meanwhile turned back to his friends to see if they needed help and did a double take. “Oh my gods.” He groaned.
“The reason I got into this, all of us into this, was selfish. I just wanted Peggy back and I wanted to be absolved. I didn’t care that she told me to leave it, I didn’t care that going down this path endangered my friends. I just cared about my needs. My wants.” He locked eyes with Howard. “That’s the definition of selfish.”
“You don’t have to accept my apology or even forgive me.” He paused, “But please don’t give up on Steve.”
“No! You’re not allowed to throw yourself at death. I...I...Tony I don’t want you to die... ”
“Oh no.” Loki whispered as he looked the child over. “Ooooh no. You need to hide!” Loki commanded sternly.
However tonight she seemed warm. She moved her plate and drink over to the seat next to Steve and wrapped him in a tight hug.
“Wow…” Tony breathed. “That’s a lot to take in.”
He thought, panic fastly taking over his mind.
“I was doing an experiment based on what some of the shades told me, but I think I miscalculated or something.” Tony explained while Loki’s anger and frustration only increased, causing the room to become colder as his skin took on a dark shade of blue and his eyes a stormy red.
Amora still looked lost, and Tony thought for a brief second
Everything Tony had done was for nothing. The Avengers weren’t sleeping with Thor. Once the year finished out, Tony wouldn’t be getting his freedom but would be going back to Hel and doing whatever tasks Loki and himself could think up to earn it.
Everyone was quiet for a moment as that thought sunk in. They had known Monster Bog was where most monsters lived but they never thought of it from the monsters point of view. They were living their lives here, not bothering anyone, just living. Then people (like the 5 of them) would come in and invade their home.
“I thank you for your honesty!” Thor boomed then took off back to Avengers mansion.
!” Amora screeched then shot both her hands forward, directly at Tony’s chest.
“No, no, no, no!” Tony shook his head and waved his arms in the negative. “This is a terrible idea!”
Steve groaned as the brunette wiggled his eyebrows. “Please stop.” He begged. “I think that ship has sailed, got attacked by raiders, and then plunged into the sea.”
“The map says to follow the yellow path, and the path goes on that way!” Bucky argued.
“It’s not forever.” Loki answered blithely. “I just need them long enough to kill you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“He lives here?! In New Thebes City?” Clint yelled.
“What?! You need decorations and what better than a statue of your favorite god?”
Thor turned his downtrodden face towards Tony and looked liked someone just stole his favorite sweet. “I apologize if I overwhelmed you, it was not my intention.”
1. Clint and Natasha have joined the party, hurray! I know it was kinda rushed at the end but ‘eh I like it enough.
Thor gave his mother a look of pure awe. Frigga did not dawn her armor often, but each time she did she left everyone speechless. Her grace and elegance shone even when dressed in heavy armor and poised to kill.
Amora’s shoulders rose in anger then she turned and stormed off. Tony watched her leave then slowly turned back to Loki who now had all his focus on Tony.
All the while he kept squashing down the panicked concern that was trying to overcome him.
"Hold on, honey, just give me a sec," Tony said, grunting as he reached over to the bedside table for their nearly-empty bottle of lube. He quickly squeezed a generous amount into his palm before taking hold of their cocks again, his free hand sliding down Steve's back to squeeze his ass.
"Yeah, okay," Tony said quickly. "JARVIS?"
Which they hadn't. Thanks to Helen Cho and her top-notch medical connections, after an extremely delicate and complicated surgery followed by a series of very bulky—and annoying—casts, Steve's foot was technically completely healed, with no traces of any lingering injury visible on X-ray or MRI.
"Hmm," Tony said, warily eyeing his father. "So that's it, right? The dude went from being half-mad to completely cuckoo afterwards?"
"Steve," James suddenly called from behind him, sending a freezing cold bolt of fear down his spine. Slowly, Steve turned, still holding onto Peter's lifeless body as his eyes landed on Tony, his head lying in James's lap, his armoured body completely motionless.
"As long as it doesn't get too much colder out here," answered Tony. "Otherwise, I'm gonna head back inside and you two nanuuks can stay out here and watch 'em by yourselves."
"Not yet, but JARVIS is working on it," Tony said. "If nothing else, we'll at least have one of the drones targeting those coordinates by the time we get there."
This is all my fault.  If I hadn’t ordered the drone, this wouldn’t’ve happened.
"No, no, don't you be looking at me," Tony replied. "Call it, Captain."
Justin Hammer, a complete asshole who never had an original idea in his life, compare his slapped together monstrosities built with stolen alien tech with the Iron Man armour that Tony built to personally exact revenge on the terrorists who tortured his beloved boy and killed Yinsen?
"Yeah, Peter couldn't decide what to wear," Ned said, his jaw dropping slightly as he caught sight of Betty standing with some of their Decathlon friends. "I finally had to threaten to come without him if he didn't hurry up."
"Not calling you out when you saved him at the movie theatre," Dad continued. "Trying to butter Steve and I up, asking if we need anything and then offering to pick you up from school? It all fits, Pete!"
There was nothing but silence.
"Hmm…" Tony murmured as he leaned back in his chair, his expression morphing into his
"Well, I just meant, don't you need them to actually see?" Gwen asked as they stepped inside the classroom, the cold, dry air practically slapping Peter in the face as they took their seats. "I've just noticed that you squint sometimes when you're not wearing them."
"You think so, do ya?" he asked, lifting his head to stare into his husband's eyes, so bright blue—with just the lightest touch of green—in the late-morning sun that they almost didn't seem real. The very same sun that was filtering through Steve's blond hair, giving him an almost halo-like effect.
"All right, all right," Steve cut in. Witnessing yet another lovers' spat at the breakfast table was not part of his plan for that morning, no matter how tongue-in-cheek it might be. "Why don't we just try and focus on what we'll be doing later, hmm?"
"Long as you keep him alive, JARVIS," Tony said in a rush. "Just keep him alive."
Steve bit down hard on his bottom lip, studying the distant mountains for several heartbeats. "Who?" he finally asked. "Who would do it?"
"Who, Spider-Man?" said Mr Stacy.
"Oh, yeah. Loads," answered Peter, which Tony knew was not only a flat-out lie, but one meant to attempt to draw attention away from himself, as Peter often did.
"But, yeah, I think they should be fine," Natasha finished. "They're usually pretty easy on us."
"Looking good, Danvers!" called Lorne. "She handles pretty well, hmm?"
“Yeah, Dad, I do,” Peter said quietly.  He tipped his head back against his locker, squeezing his eyes closed as he tried to think of what to say next that wasn't just another whiny complaint.  “I just…”
"Come in!" he said, so fast that he nearly tripped over his tongue.
"No way, that's awesome!" Peter exclaimed. "How many pieces?"
"You are correct, sir," answered JARVIS. "Master Peter is currently sleeping comfortably, and his vital signs are within his normal parameters."
"Well, we all have our quirks, as you know," Natasha said with a smirk. "Even you."
Stark, and I—"
He had to be right about this.  He just
"You and Sam have been together for what, two years now?" Steve asked.
All he wanted was for the battle to be over, so he could take his husband and son home.
"Beats me, but you know what Colonel O'Brien always says about bugging out early, so we probably should wait till we hear something official," answered Joseph. He sucked in a deep breath as he checked his fuel gauge, located right next to the printed photograph of his wife. "Just hope he doesn't take too long, I'm already almost running on fumes."
"Yes, sir. Director Fury anticipated that that would be your response."
"Mmm, maybe not," grumbled Dad. "But it's apparently perfectly fine for Fury to put Steve in harm's way. Again."
not knowing exactly what was done to Peter during his captivity, but all Peter could clearly remember was the shocking reveal of the video, the sharp ice bolt that raced down his spine a couple seconds before Obie and the Winter Soldiers broke into their apartment and immobilised them, and the sound of Obie's slimy voice as he loomed over Papa, taunting him before they were all knocked out and taken away. But after that, aside from a few memories of Uncle Bucky's voice echoing around in his head and a whole truckload of pain, things were mostly just one big blur.
"Oh, you do, do you?" barked Tony. "And what're you gonna do, just sit around on your ass and watch while we work?"
"Pardon me, Mr Stark?" said Captain Wilson through Tony's headset. "Did you say something?"
"I am currently unaware of Thor's whereabouts," replied JARVIS.
Peter grinned as he took one of Uncle Bucky's pawns with his bishop. "He thought it was pretty funny, actually. And I'm pretty sure Uncle Clint hasn't let him hear the end of it yet."
Thank you so much for all of the wonderful comments on the first chapter!  I’m so glad you guys are enjoying the story! 💖
“Yes, Tony,” he said.  “I do.”
But he wasn't. He and Peter were somewhere out there in space, no doubt engaged in their very own battle for the Time Stone.
Had he ever seen such intense blue eyes before?
Steve looked over at Tony, raising an eyebrow.
"Stand by!" Steve sharply whispered, watching through narrowed eyes as Thanos carefully moved the stone over to the gauntlet, dropping it down into its awaiting slot. Almost immediately, his entire body seized, the bellowing cry he let out as the combined power of the six stones surged through him just as jarring to Steve as it had been the first time.
"Tony, they'll be fish in a barrel inside that building," Sam said. "We've gotta try and keep the suits out in the open or else we'll have to call a Code Green, and I really don't want to have to do that."
"Yeah, yeah," Tony said as he scrubbed his palm down his face. "The theory is that he wouldn't have to hold the weight for much longer than that, but… what would happen if we increased the density of the titanium in the alloy mixture by five percent?"
Something that Steve could definitely relate to.
😭 = I got you right in the feels
"All right," Tony said, pursing his lips. "Then let's do it."
This chapter contains clinical descriptions of some pretty severe injuries.  It is nothing that I would consider overtly graphic, but please be aware if you are sensitive to that kind of thing.  💖
“I love you too, honey.”  As the screen went blank, Tony pressed his palm over the arc reactor, his fingertips tracing along the chain that framed it.  On the chain hung the dog tags Steve had presented to him after they spent their first night together, tags that Tony hadn't taken off since.  He had known how much of a romantic Steve was pretty much from the get-go, when, after their first date, he informed Tony that he was going to demonstrate for Peter the proper way to court his “best guy”.  But Tony had shed honest-to-goodness tears that morning when Steve presented him with his dog tags, set in the middle of a breakfast tray complete with two plates of perfectly scrambled eggs, two homemade bagels loaded with melted butter, and two perfect cups of coffee.
“Mmm,” Tony says as he burrows down again.  “S-sounds g-good.”
How Steve could possibly be interested in Tony was another matter altogether, but he supposed there was no harm in looking halfway decent when he picked up his son.
It'd been bad enough having to say goodbye to his sweet son the first time, but after Thor's dramatic arrival at the Tower and the grim proclamation that followed, saying goodbye the second time had been even more difficult. The intense fear that Steve had seen in Peter's eyes had been even worse after Thor dropped his bombshells, and it had taken nearly all of Steve's strength to put on as brave a face as he could as he tucked Peter back into bed before the team departed.
Steve gave a quick nod. "Yes. He's got a… genetic mutation that allows him to heal quickly. His healing factor is similar to mine."
More than
"Ah, I see," said Uncle Sam, giving Uncle Bucky a knowing glance. "Well, then I guess you're just outta luck now, hmm, Sir Bucky?"
"So nice of them, since it almost did anyway," Peter grumbled as he continued to scroll through the file, physically forcing his eyelids to stay open.
"You know, this was not part of my plan," Steve said as he practically ripped Tony's shirt from his body, dipping his head to trail kisses all across the scars littering Tony's sternum, framed by the chain that held Steve's dog tags. "You're just incorrigible. You know that, right? What am I going to do with you?"
They had gone back to Hel and Tony grabbed some of his things and told Rhodey, Jarvis, and Pepper about what had transpired.
“More reason for me to go with you.” Thor tightened his grip. “You may have dominion over dead mortals, but I am the protector of living mortals. It is my right to protect all living mortals. Even from you.”
“Then that’s all.” Peggy cut in, gently gesturing to Steve’s hand.
“It’s a big city.” Betty reasoned but Clint hemmed and hawed while shaking his head.
“I wonder what happened that last visit.” Jarvis mussed.
Thor wasn’t cheating on Loki. Steve hasn’t been sleeping with Thor. Thor hadn’t slept with
“I couldn’t think of anything else!”
“ENOUGH!” Loki shot up from his throne, blue bleeding over his face and arms. “Take it or leave it Thor!”
Steve thought.
5. Yes Fandral is the Aphrodite of this story. Also hope you enjoyed my remix of the Minotaur myth. I picture Minos to be Senator Stern from MCU. Also I did not make up the Minotaur’s name, Asterion is his actual name (google it).
Loki thought viciously. He then sat up straighter on his throne, “You will have three days.” Loki waved his hand and a scroll appeared in his hand, he floated it over to Howard who grabbed it. “That is a map that will show you how to meanuever in the underworld and where you can find the underworld entrances. They are hidden all over in the land of the living.”
“Goodnight Captain.”
“No deal!”  Natasha yelled. Everyone looked at her in surprise, including Loki who arched an eyebrow at the woman.
Finally Thor had had enough and decided to silence Loki the only way possible. He wrestled Loki against the wall, braved the winter's touch on his skin once Loki unleashed it upon him. He was immortal he would heal from the frostbite. Then Thor began to rip at Loki’s clothes. Loki, in turn, began to tear at Thor’s armor, cursing him the entire time. Eventually he dropped his winters touch but kept his angry blue skin. After divesting themselves of clothing, they jumped each other and went at it against the wall. Loki had stayed blue the entire time. His anger never wavering even after they both climaxed.
“Loki!” Tony greeted with a fake smile, hoping to stay off the gods anger. “It’s not as bad as it looks.”
The fog then cleared leaving the Avengers to stare off into the distance.
“I doubt the god of the Dead will just let her go.” Steve reasoned after a few seconds of silence.
“No!” Tony rushed, “Just… not something I thought you’d pick.” He confessed almost hesitantly, but Steve just gave a small smile in return.
“Loki which room?” Thor questioned, sounding closer than before.
“See? They always come crawling back.” For reasons unknown to Steve or Erskine, Bucky burst out laughing at this, and shoved the gods shoulder.
Thor glared “What is it you need me to fetch?”
After a moment of silence passed Sam turned to Steve. “Why is he calling you ‘Captain’?”
Bruce actually laughed and nodded in the affirmative. “Yes, yes, and yes! I’ve only ever seen him in red chitons. It’s got to be his favorite color.”
“Rhodey-bear is my best friend.” Tony proclaimed proudly and patted the man’s back. Said man threw Tony a smile.
“This is merely precautionary.” Thor assured again as he walked away from his friends. “I’m sure Tony is fine, I just wish to rule this out.”
“Finally home?” Loki called from where he was lounging on the couch cushions. “I have been here for awhile, waiting on you.”
The Avengers were greeted formally, given a few bedrooms for them to share, then a feast was held in their honor. During the feast the Avengers saw the Queen and she looked like a shell of a woman. Throughout the dinner they noticed the Queen was never really addressed, ever. The court would not even acknowledge her and the woman made no effort to be seen. She just looked defeated and worn down. It was as much confirmation as the Avengers needed and their blood boiled in anger at the grinning and jovial King Minos.
“What has happened?”
After Loki had calmed down from Thor storming out of Hel. Loki had summoned Tony back to the throne room. He then explained that he had found a way for Tony to earn his freedom. Tony had immediately plowed Loki over with questions and exclamations till Loki was forced to use his magic to restrain and silence him.
“Everyone?! WHAT?!” Steve screeched releasing Tony’s one hand so as to run a hand through his own hair.
“He’s been sleeping with Thor and now he wants to take Tony?!” Rhodey screeched then turned his full glare on the blonde, who looked exasperated.
Loki scoffed and rolled his eyes but then found Thor yanking him over and dipping him for a kiss. Breaking the kiss Loki slapped weakly at Thor’s face.
“Don’t worry about it Cap.” Tony gave a small smile and the blonde let out a breathy laugh.
“How long do I have?” The shade asked not looking at the god but at the ground.
“Seriously?! You never noticed that Jörmungandr is afraid of you! Your lightning and thunder scare him!” Tony groaned and a look of enlightenment took over Thor’s features.
“I can’t believe you know Lord Thor!” Clint gushed, the thought of knowing a god personally was mind boggling and beyond his imagination.
“And yet you still call me Mr. Stark.” Howard shook his head ruefully at Steve’s bashful smile. “I know I’m old son,” He gestured to his full head of white hair. “But I don't want to be made to feel older.”
“It’s a magic map. Once you open it, it starts detailing the area around you. If you want a larger view you simply,” Howard opened the scroll more and the map expanded. “Open it some more.”
“If this ends up killing us Punk, I will haunt you.”
“Creatures in Monster Bog! It is I Lord Thor, god of Thunder and fertility! I have a question to ask and I expect truthful answers or you will face my wrath.” Thor boomed loudly, making sure his voice carried so all could hear it.
Loki had not left his blue form in awhile. Tony had made overtures to talk to Loki in order to try and calm him, to no avail. As more time passed, Tony began to truly believe what Loki had already cemented in his head. Thor was sleeping with the humans and Odin approved.
But all the wolf did was lick him. Several times.
Loki waved the staff in front of Howard, and the blue orb glowed bright then dimmed. Howard instinctively jumped back and went into a fighting stance. However he quickly relaxed as Loki pulled the staff back to himself and calmly walked to his throne.
“Keep moving Junior!” Tony cut in harshly throwing Steve a glare.
“Do you guys see that?” Clint asked.
“He has a point.” Natasha quipped and Bucky chuckled as Sam threw his arms out in defeat.
Tony gave the god a helpless shrug. To which Loki glared harder. Loki then teleported himself and Tony back to the palace.
This isn’t the end. There’s one more chapter and then I’m gonna add chap 27 for the memes :D
Steve hefted his shield and everyone else got a firmer grip on their weapons.
However, Pepper darted in front of Steve, shielding him bodily.
Loki only slid his eyes to Steve in response. Everyone’s attention then zeroed in on the blonde, who hadn’t looked away from Tony. Suddenly sensing everyone’s attention, Steve squared his shoulders.
“Don’t mother me, I’m fine.” He waved Steve’s hands away as he got into a sitting position. Both friends then sat on Bucky’s bed and stared at nothing for a few moments.
“Erskine has lived through many things. He has gained valuable knowledge, but he is still mortal and knows how to teach you. Steve, he is who will train you to become a True Hero.” Thor declared.
“Do you get it now?” He asked harshly. “Loki knows they haven’t slept with Thor and still wants them dead.”
“You could get killed!”
“Tomorrow, we teach you how to use your new physique.” Erskine stated, and that’s the last Steve heard before he fell unconscious.
“Cut off one head, and three more grow in its place.” Steve spoke and then three heads burst forth from the neck stub.
Steve looked over the group appraisingly and walked around correcting some forms and movements as he went.
“What do you know?” Natasha asked as they walked.
“LIES!” King Minos screamed. “Guards seize them!”
Hope you all are staying safe during the quarantine!
Tony’s heartbeat was in his ears it was so loud. And his head kept getting lighter and lighter. He vaguely heard sounds but couldn’t make them out over his heartbeat. Suddenly he was popped back into Hel. Right into Loki’s throne room.
Loki rolled his eyes and waved his hand dismissively. “Shut up.”
“Let the oaf search for hours.” He chuckled, then turned back to the scroll in his hand.
“Oh wow.” He breathed then pulled Steve’s face back towards his own.
“Bud,” Bucky grabbed the blonde’s shoulder but Steve shook it off and stomped a pace away.
“Oh come on Rhodey!” Tony threw his hands up.
“What’s wrong?!” Natasha yelled as she and the other Avengers turned to Tony and Steve.
They walked through the city more and by nightfall they were walking along the beach. They had spent a majority of the day in each other’s company talking, laughing, and occasionally lapsing into comfortable silences. Well Steve interpreted them as comfortable silences, Tony interpreted them as time to think of new conversation topics.
Bucky gave him a startled look and mouthed “what are you doing?”. Steve spared him a glance then looked back at the god of the Dead and made his case.
“... Maybe we need to go about this in a different way.”  Amora added with a thoughtful look on her face. Tony looked at her in surprise and Loki sent her a glare but she shook her head at them “I’m not agreeing with Anthony.” She clarified. “I’m saying we need to take a different approach. We’ve just been throwing monsters at them because that usually kills heroes, but that’s not working here. We need to throw something else at them.”
“Loki wants them dead, and they didn’t even sleep with Thor.” Tony explained and Amora’s jaw dropped.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony blinked his eyes open and gave Steve a confused look while glancing at the blonde’s mouth. “What?” Tony breathed.
“We will see.”
“You and Amora and Rhodey all think I’m so easy to manipulate! But really
“Yeah.” Tony rolled his shoulders then put on an unaffected face. “I’m using his affections as an in. I’ll get the homewreckers weaknesses then give them to Loki.” He smacked his lips and hands together. “And everyone wins.”
“What?” All the Avengers voiced in various tones and volumes.
The blonde let out a deep sigh and made himself more comfortable. “It’s dumb but the sea, to me. Is a reminder that I was….useless. I couldn't do anything.” Steve seemed to be lost in his own world again as Tony sat silently next to him.
Steve bolted over to Tony and took up the spot Bruce had vacated once he turned into his hulk form. Bruce and the others were fighting Amora but Steve couldn’t take his eyes off Tony long enough to notice.
“I think he has someone over.” Steve said slowly.
Steve’s hands landed on Tony’s hips and began to control their movements. Pulling them down for deep slow drags then faster shallower one. Tony then moved his own hands down and started pulling on Steve’s smallclothes.
Fenrir shrunk down to a puppy size and pawed at Loki’s feet in excitement. Loki smiled and then he reached out his hand, Fenrir grew so his head would be at the same level as Loki’s hand so the god wouldn’t have to bend over.
Steve then surged forward and pulled Tony into a kiss, who more than happily returned it.
“The restless shade I presume?” Loki asked examining the human soul that was currently yelling at another underworld minion. The minion that was leading Loki nodded and then went back to their post in directing the weary and accepting souls.
Sam was the next to bring it up, while they walked his and Bucky’s dog. The feeling overtook Steve and he went off.
“Really?” Sam had butted in. Bucky gripped his arm and gave him a glare that Sam returned and shook off before glaring at Tony. “You’re not inviting your
“It’s the map!” Sam cried then pointed to where their own map was tucked away and back to the one a younger looking Howard was holding.
Once in the land of the living Tony was overjoyed by everything. Years with only the underworlds ethereal glow and no direct sunlight, had made him forget how great the actual sun felt on his skin. He laid in the grass, ran through the fields, tumbled down some hills. He thoroughly enjoyed all the things the land of the living had that Hel did not. Everything except people.
Loki immediately stiffened and blue began to creep over his body. “What.” His tone was ice and the room began to drop in temperature. “Was that name, again?”
This had then turned into telling all the Avengers about how Steve had been a sickly weak boy. From there it divulged into a fun night of swapping backstories. All except Howard who only listened and laughed but never shared.
He didn’t even make up a great excuse, just got up and made for the door saying “Just remembered I’ve got a thing I have to get to. See you later Steve, bye!”
Unfortunately he was still owned by Loki. While he wasn’t chained to the palace or Loki’s side, he wasn’t free to run off and do whatever he wanted. He had duties and responsibilities he had to see to before he could do anything.
Rhodey was also thrilled Tony would be getting his freedom. “Good! Loki’s getting more and more unhinged thanks to this mess. I’m glad you’re getting out of the firing zone.”
“I’m not going to let you sleep alone Buck.” Steve said calmly while Bucky hastily pulled the blankets off his bed.
“You have two shades waiting anxiously for you in your room.” Loki pointed to the door again. “Go!”

“Stevey”
“What did you do?!” Loki yelled as he scanned the now decimated room. Loki’s angry eyes began to turn red as he glanced all around the room, taking in the utter destruction the 13 year old wrought.
“She’s just inside.” Steve assured as he walked Tony over towards their friends.
Loki shrugged. “I’ve been able to track time easier recently.”
Sam and Bruce had laid the brunette down on the beach. Sam had been propping the brunettes back up in order to keep his injury in the back from touching the ground. But when Steve had arrived the blonde had pulled Tony’s upper body towards himself.
After regaining their sight everyone looked towards the monster only to see it’s body limp and the last head completely charred. And there in front of it was the god of Thunder and Fertility Thor.
“Tony! Tony!” Steve panted as his pace somehow increased even more.
“I’m sorry again about that.” Steve offered as they walked the streets of the city. “It’s crazy, I can’t go anywhere without being mobbed.” The blonde ducked his head in embarrassment thus missing the annoyed eye roll Tony couldn't suppress.

’ He nodded then threw Natasha, who had glanced at him, a smile.
“Steve, you need to live your life.” Peggy said gently and framed the blonde's face. “I want you to go on adventures, make stories, and fall in love.” Steve closed his eyes and looked as if he was going to say something but Peggy continued on. “I mean it. I’m ordering you to move forward.”
Tony was silent for a few seconds then let out a sigh. “Got it.”
“No! Dad!” Tony cried trying to grab the man but never being able to find purchase.
“Did you know he has wings?!”  Clint continued as the two raced after their new friends.
Steve had to relearn everything. His new body was completely foreign to him. He couldn’t control his strength in any aspect. When he tried to go for a casual run he found he couldn’t stop when he wanted to, as he didn’t take his new speed into account. Which ended up in him smacking into a tree and that tree getting cracked in half. When going to give Bucky a playful shove, he had shoved his friend a good few feet away. When then offering a hand to help him up, he ripped Bucky’s arm out of its socket.
“WHAT!?” Steve shouted looking between his two now gaping and blushing friends. “Since when?!”
Tony then ran as if to charge and tackle the woman. However she just whipped her head over to his direction and smirked.
Steve’s voice broke through Tony’s panic and he whipped his head over to the blonde that was now on his other side.
“Bucky what’s wrong?” Steve ran to meet the shaken brunette. Just from a glance, everyone could tell something was wrong.
The Avengers fame was not to be taken lightly and so they had tours that had occurred around their home and some training sessions. They also hosted other events: Clint taught archery, Sam and Natasha helped out with the homeless and currently Steve was hosting his Self Defense Session (not Buns of Bronze, Clint). The tours however were a very regular thing and usually Phil or Betty hosted them.
“I mean it.” Steve whispered into the decreasing space between their faces, as both of them leaned towards each other. “I would never hurt you.” He whispered again as Tony closed his eyes.
“Yeah when he had magic Asgardian water in him...but he doesn’t now! He’s just a regular mortal.” Tony barked a laugh “And you can’t control him.” He gave her a disappointed look.
“No. No I’m going to stay here and fiddle around a bit.”
“Just tired.” Steve tried to assure but looked confused. “But I don’t know why.”
“Bruce I meant what I said.” Steve came up to the man’s other side and gave him a calming smile. “I want to help you. We can help you get your control over your Hulk form so you don’t have to fear it, but embrace it.”
“Is the Queen alive?” Steve asked looking at Phil.
Steve also reflected back on the Civil War and knew there were many things he could’ve done differently. He should have listened to Sam; he should have talked in private. Instead he got all his friends caught up in this. Clint and Natasha never talked about the Civil War, and she seemed to really analyze everything they all said even more than she had previously.
“Boo.” Clint whined sticking out his tongue. “You’re no fun.”
“Goodnight Tony.”
“I’ll earn it another way.”
There were too many of them for Thor and Sam to fly over in one shift. And they wanted to conserve their strength. They had no idea how Loki would react to them all being in the underworld, and demanding Tony back. So they needed to be prepared for a fight.
Steve let out a sound of betrayal and then a groan at his friends responding laughter.
“Boy,” Loki called, gaining Tony’s attention. “What is your name?” He asked gently.
“My friends…” Thor said but didn’t know what else to say.
“Amora, I can’t believe you haven’t figured it out. I’ve only been witness to this stuff for the past few years and I figured it out.” Amora glared at him and rolled her shoulders in anger. “I used to wonder why Loki let you throw yourself at Thor all the time. At first I thought it was because he knew you weren’t a threat. I mean you greeted him completely nude that one time and he didn’t even bat an eye!” Tony shrugged and Amora’s hands dropped to her sides.
“Are they for real?”
He had gone over ways to handle all the other Avengers. Ideally he would sway all their attention elsewhere or on others and then focus his attention on Steve. But Thor had ruined those plans with his mere presence. Tony didn’t know how to act around him! And honestly, he felt as if he already knew Thor; from what Loki would tell him and from what he’d sometimes accidentally overhear. He had to make sure he didn’t leak any of that information out.
“I think so?” Steve answered a little unsure but that seemed to be enough for Clint.
“What?!”
New York City for all it’s grander was still in a small world, so of course Steve’s side and Tony’s side would run in to each other from time to time. Greetings, if given, were stiff and partings awkward. Tony and Steve ran crossed paths but it never ended well.
He wasn’t a glory hoarding hero. He listened to others, took advice and kept an open mind. He was willing to throw his reputation and glory to the fire if it meant doing the right thing. He did what was right because it was the right thing to do. He was a True Hero.
“This has to be awkward for you.” Jarvis continued on then turned to Tony in concern. “I feel awkward.”
“Let me get sick! I don’t care! I just want to be with her!” Steve cried as he broke down into sobs.
“Woah! You’re not blue!” Tony barked a laugh. “Been awhile.”
Steve and Bucky gasped in shock as a map began to magically appear.
He then told the mortals to stay where they were and went into the mists. When he returned he came back with an ethereal looking man. He looked to be an older man in his early 70s. His hair was white but his beard still had brown coloring, and he wore a floor length chiton. On top of everything, the man seemed to almost glow a light blue. As soon as the ethereal man appeared in front of the two friends, the ever turning mist vanished.
“Pack your stuff, you're leaving.” Loki ordered, breaking up the tension that had replaced all the ice the Throne Room previously had.
They had been going out for sometime. Steve had wanted to do something special for Peggy so he had planned an outing where they went to the seaside and spent the whole day by the beach. Lounging near the water they had planned their future together, where their dream house would be (“A house right by the water, so we can fall asleep to the sound of the waves”), what they would be doing (“You’ll be running the whole Grecian world.” “Then you can be my kept man”), how many children they’d have (“Two”). It was then Peggy that had pulled a ring out.
“Lord Loki.” Steve gasped.
“Of course he’s fine! He’s so fine that he’s out running through all of New York from dawn until dusk to run away from everything that’s so GREAT and FINE in his life!”
“Tony listen. I love you, I do. But I am needed.” Tony started shaking his head but Howard gave him a brief shake and continued on “Too much is at stake for me to let my emotions cloud me. I am needed to end this war Tony. I have to live again.”
“I don’t!” Steve quickly added, his arms up in surrender. “Bruce said he thought you were creating a compendium about the Monsters of the world, is that wrong?”
“Great.” Bucky groaned. “Another awkward and awful visit to the Palace of Hel.” Bucky gave a mock glare to Steve. “You make it hard to be your friend.”
“I’m not that tiny!”
Natasha nodded her head and in a more apologetic tone said “I’m sorry.”
“Another perfect plan.” She mused to herself, then created a dagger and held it out. “Grab the dagger.” She commanded and Steve complied.
Loki then turned his attention back to Thor. The blonde saw a number of emotions and thoughts flutter through Loki’s eyes before the trickster god seemed to settle on one.
“You have to do this Tony! I have to do this!” Howard finally snapped. “I. Am. Needed!” With that Howard shoved Tony away so hard the boy fell to the floor.
They shared a meal together to further help break Sam into the group. During which Erskine said he would also share his knowledge with Sam. That had sent Bucky into a coughing fit as he accidentally inhaled an olive.
The Avengers and Tony walked into the main hall of the Palace. All the gathered nobles bowed and King Minos beamed at them from his throne. King Minos was a portly man, not to the point of excess but enough to show he didn’t do much (if any) manual work. His hair was kept nicely trimmed,and was mostly brunette, save for the white just above his ears and in the wisps of his hair.
“Yes.” Loki  lounged on his throne now, feeling he’s tested Howard’s desperate ‘anything’ as far as it could go. “You must bring back to me either your wife or your son.”
“Please those heroes are loving this.” Tony rolled his eyes, remembering all the stuff he had seen about the Avengers the last time he had gone up to the land of the living. “They just want to get love and praise from the masses. And all these fights are just boosting their appeal to Thor
A picture of the Hel crew, Tony, Rhodey and Loki
“I do not doubt that.” Thor said and patted Bucky on the arm. “But I feel it’s best if I talk with him on your behalf.”
“What are you guys doing?!” Tony yelled from the hallway connecting the skylight room and the garden.
“Ugh...This is all your fault!” Tony grumbled and Loki quirked an eyebrow. “If you didn’t check on me, Bucky wouldn’t have seen you. And then none of this would have happened.”
The Avengers went back home to inform Bruce of everything and to get some well deserved rest. Rhodey had stayed with Steve and the two had talked for awhile. They had cleared the air and agreed to start off fresh. However, Rhodey had made it clear that Tony was his family and he would not let the brunette get hurt.
If Bruce and Sam hadn’t been restraining Tony, the brunette surely would have been shot back with the momentum of the blast. However, since all he could move was back a foot or so, the blast had gone clean through him.
“Maybe he went to the Monster Bog.” Bruce suggested. “It’s been awhile since he’s been able to work. Maybe he went to do some research and didn’t notice the time.”
“We’re here to kill the Hulk.” Clint answered and shrugged when everyone glared at him.
” Loki yelled and blue began to creep over him. “You’re going to die and I’m going to enjoy every minute of it!”
“And you roll with that information from there.” Tony finished.
“The path kept going!” He defended himself.
“EXCUSE ME?!” Loki yelled again and ice immediately began to form in the Throne Room.
“And what, pray tell, is so funny?” Amora asked in a bored tone.
“Oh that’s not good.” Bucky admitted.
With one last squeeze they separated and then Tony jogged back to Steve and smiled at the blonde. Steve smiled back then reached out and grabbed Tony’s hand. Unlike with Peggy, Steve could feel Tony’s hand. Then, with very little fanfare, Tony’s color returned to him and he seemed whole and hale.
Tony had then dove into doing whatever he could to earn as much freedom as possible. He had revamped the Monster Village, which had boosted moral and positive reviews of job postings in Hel. He had then gone on recruitment missions. He traveled to the Monster Bog in the land of the living and proved to be excellent in recruiting monsters. He also helped implement more effective underworld systems that accommodated all the employees of Hel. He had done such a good job revamping Hel’s systems that Amora’s job appeared to be moot as everything ran like a fine tune machine. Which backfired on him in the aspect of Amora loitering around the Palace now more than ever. But Tony refused to let her get to him, because he would be free.
“He’s lived here all this time and only just now is showing up again?” Bucky questioned.
“I don’t regret helping Steve and the Avengers.” Tony’s soul said honestly. Tony then looked off into the distance, “I just hope I managed to actually help them.”
“How am I a hypocrite?”
Steve smiled, that soft smile that only Tony ever saw, his arms tightening around Tony's waist. "Thank you, sweetheart."
And whoever was in there messing around was pretty good, Peter had to admit, but they still weren't as good as him. As long as he could keep ahead of them, he should hopefully be able to get JARVIS back up and running.
"I will try, okay?" he finally said. "I honestly can't promise that I'll be able to get away tomorrow, but I definitely will the day after. All right?"
you. It's not easy to see you like this, and I know it's been hard for Pete too. He loves you so much, honey, it's hard for him to see you struggling."
So what’s this whole other-way-round thing you’ve got going on here?”
"Thank you, Helen," Tony said, breathing out a sigh of relief. The last thing he wanted was to have to argue with his stubborn-as-hell husband over the best way to treat his multiple injuries.
The next chapter will post by Wednesday, January 27th 😊
Peter repeated the mantra three more times before slowly opening his eyes, sucking in a deep breath as he tipped his head to the side to glance up at the clock, which had continued with its incessant ticking as if it was its soul purpose for existence. With an annoyed huff, Peter rolled his eyes and dragged his attention back to studying Gwen's hair. His patience with school wasn't often the greatest anyway, but it had been even worse ever since they came home from Wakanda. Most of it was jealousy, as petty as that was. The technology that Shuri and her family had access to down in Wakanda was just so advanced that there was no way the Stark-influenced tech and equipment Peter used at Midtown could compare.
"Yeah, there is," said Tony. Of course Peter wouldn't program his own health issues into JARVIS's matrix. He still was under the impression that his life wasn't worth any more than anyone else's, which was absolutely ridiculous. Peter was arguably the most intelligent person that Langara had ever seen, and the thought of losing someone like him before he'd even reached puberty was—well—
Dr Strange had said. And while Peter supposed he could just chalk it up to the wizard's overall weirdness—and really, was there a wizard out there who
Quill! You got any tools on that ship of yours?"
"Pete! Let's get moving!" Dad called as he took off towards the top of a destroyed building. "Time to get into position!"
"Peter!" Gwen exclaimed as soon as her face appeared on the screen. "Oh my God, are you okay? My dad saw what happened on the news and at first we didn't want to believe it, but—"
"Pretty much," Steve agreed. "Sam, you and Tony will start at these two towers and work counterclockwise while Nat, Clint, and I take position here, by the entrance. As soon as the towers are clear, Clint'll take out any remaining guards by the entrance and we'll all head inside. Bruce will stay here with the jet on standby, either for a code green or to assist with evac if there's a problem. Any questions?"
Tony's breath lodged in his throat at Peter's statement, at how much he sounded like Steve as he said it. He cupped his son's cheeks in both hands, unable to even form words as he stared at him in awe.
"So… Steve shows up here out of the blue. Then the next day he goes to Dad's class on the X-302s and he obviously would've learned Dad's name, but I never told Steve my last name and Ms Sharon told me that they're not allowed to tell anyone who isn't family, and Dad's not allowed to talk about anything personal at work, so…" He tapped his chin, trying to force his tired mind to work.
"Then there's not even any leftover shit for him to have to deal with," Tony finished.
"No, Птер, you can't sleep right now," Bucky pleaded. "We need you to stay awake and finish this."
don't think you need to be worrying about anything like that," he said gently. "And you know it makes Papa sad to even hear you talk like that, so… why?"
But the only reply was the slam of the heavy metal door.
Tony’s Adam’s apple bobs as he swallows.  “You trust me?”
"No, but this also means that JARVIS was a lot more complicated than they'd originally thought," Peter said. "Which means I might still have time to fix him."
"Once we know how to win, then we go back in before the point in our time where we branched off from the winning timeline, and fix things," explained Tony. "Think of it like a tree, where a bunch of different timelines are all branching out from a single trunk. At a certain point they all started out in the same spot, so—"
"Ah," Gwen whispered back. "I still don't get it."
"All right, here we are," Dad said as he pulled into the driveway at what JARVIS had indicated was Liz's address. He frowned as he scanned the large, sprawling house with floor-to-ceiling windows across nearly the entire front, through which Peter could see the brightly flashing lights from the DJ station. Peter had always guessed that Liz's family was on the wealthier side based on her clothes and the car her mom drove, but he hadn't thought that she was quite this wealthy.
And in the meantime this Doctor List person was still conducting his experiments, and no one had any idea where he was or how many other people he had managed to hurt in the process.
"I always am, babe, and you know it," Tony said, his eyebrows knitting together into a frown. "And you also know that there's a very fine line between being cautious and being useless, and I absolutely refuse to be useless. That's not how we work."
And, as much as Tony liked to complain—good naturedly, at least—about how much Thor liked to eat and the occasional power surges when he was messing around with his hammer, he had to admit that having him around had been especially good for both Peter and Steve. Peter's nightmares had been pretty bad ever since the water monster incident, and hadn't been responding to any of their usual tricks until Thor volunteered to start sparring with Peter, hoping that it would help tire him out enough to sleep a bit better. Peter had been sparring with Steve from time to time before the incident at the lake, but ever since Steve's horrible dream of seeing Peter as a Winter Soldier he hadn't been able to bring himself to fight against him, even if it was only in training.
"Yeah, okay," Peter said. "But if you change your mind, I definitely don't mind talking to my dad about it. I'm sure he'd be thrilled to have such an intelligent intern on his staff."
“Oh, nah,” Tony replied.  “There's no building in New York that's more secure than this Tower, and since your store’s only a few blocks away, Pete’ll be just fine.  I trust him.  He’s a good kid.”
"'Cause she said her mom wanted to meet me."
quotes:
"Yeah," said Tony. "Yeah, that's—that's fine. I just—" He pressed a kiss to the top of Peter's head, squeezing him one final time. "I just—I just needed to make sure you were okay, bud. That's all."
Steve gave a solemn nod. "I promise."
"Tony—"
"At approximately 1900 hours, when you all enjoyed your evening meal."
Someone was trying to get Ultron, whatever it was, to completely take over the Phoenix satellites, and that was something that Peter could not allow. Having the Phoenix system in the hands of anyone besides JARVIS would be such a massive catastrophe that it would put the Battle of the Continents to shame, setting the entire planet right back to where they started.
It was yet another thing that Steve could empathise with. Possessing an eidetic memory had made it very easy for Steve to do well in school since he only had to read something once for it to become locked in his mind. It had also helped him greatly during his time with the Air Corps, allowing him to memorise flight manuals and briefing reports after only a single read-through.
"Ah huh," Dad said warily. "Except if Stacy's friend knew that information then it probably means that he's another HYDRA agent, which also means that Stacy could be a HYDRA agent, which means that—"
"Uncle Thor!" Steve suddenly heard from behind him, just before Peter launched himself into Thor's arms, all skinny arms and legs as Thor lifted him up from the ground, laughing.
"Oh no!" he cried as he immediately launched himself at it, managing to grab it just before it would've shattered against the wall. StarkPhones were durable, and Dad had made his even more so since he'd already managed to break so many of them. But not even Dad could build a phone that was completely Spider-Man proof, and especially not when his bedroom walls were reinforced so he didn't accidentally crash through them during his occasional sleepwalking or otherwise sleepy walking incidents.
"Do you have any plans to expand the Avengers, Captain? Add new members? Perhaps this Spider-Man fellow that keeps popping up from time to time? And wasn't he at one point rumoured to be none other than Peter Stark, the very boy you saved out in the desert?"
Gwen gave a shrug, smirking as she popped the rest of her apple into her mouth and reached for a French fry. "My dad says I have good instincts, says I get it from him, which is pretty important if you're a police officer." She leaned closer, whispering, "And he's always had eyes in the back of his head. He says that his instincts are one of the things he relies on the most for his work, so…"
“Yes, sir,” replied JARVIS.  “However, I do believe Mr Stane will be pleased with the results of your successful simulation.”
Now, though, after Steve’s meltdown and Peter’s busted-up finger, Tony literally had no idea what to do.  Leaving Steve sprawled out on the floor of his bookstore as he begged for forgiveness had been one of the hardest things Tony had ever done in his life, but he knew he couldn't just brush aside what had happened either.  Steve needed help, more help than Tony or Peter could give him, and Tony just couldn't risk the possibility that something worse might happen if Steve continued to refuse to get the help that he needed.
"But then he told me that he liked to draw, so…" Steve's arms flopped to his sides, his bottom lip caught between his teeth. "It'd been a pretty long time since anyone had been impressed with the fact that I can draw, and I—well… I guess I liked it. And he's just so sweet, Tony. He's the sweetest kid I've ever met, and—"
"You are most welcome."
"The rest of the team's on their way, babe," Tony said a few seconds later.
❤ = you wish you could kudos again
But the man only coughed again, sending a geyser of the slimy fluid shooting out of his mouth and splashing down onto the blanket. Steve shrank back as Tony leaned closer, almost right into the man's face.
"C'mon, Bucky," he murmured. "C'mon, you can do this!"
"You okay there, buddy?" Dad asked with a frown. "Rough day?"
“The very second we’ve shipped out the last of our outstanding orders, I want you to power down all of the assembly lines assigned to weaponry,” Tony said.  “All of ‘em.  You got that?”
She broke off, but Steve understood her anyway. Pietro had made it. But Wanda, his twin, had not.
It was another thing to discover that he was going to die not because he was too far gone to save, but because there was no one who could actually save him.
“It’s exactly what it says it is,” he replied, relieved when his voice didn't quiver.  “It’s called a pharmaceutical printer.”
Natasha gave a stuttered nod, her lips tightly pursed. "Steve, I have to believe it, for Clint and Pietro's sake. Otherwise… what're we even doing here?"
And, now there were two other people out there like Peter. A pair of siblings who had been found to be genetically enhanced from birth, and so far the only people to have survived Doctor List's experiments.
Peter gave a nod. "Yeah, me too." He honestly couldn't imagine how worried Papa must be, while still trying to coordinate the rest of the team with the Wakandans.
"Excellent, Ned, that's correct!" Gwen exclaimed with a wide smile. "Now, Peter, can you tell me the atomic mass of tungsten?"
“Yeah.  Um… I need you to disconnect the alarm for Steve’s store for me,” Tony said, scratching at the back of his neck.  “He’s got an ADT basic setup with auto locks, according to the panel that I’ve seen on the inside, so it shouldn't be too hard for you to override.”
“All right, we go in on my mark,” he says, readying his shield.  “Three… two… one… mark!”
"All right, Captain?" Colonel Phillips said as soon as Steve arrived in the hangar. He could see Tony up in the observation room, his beautiful face etched in worry. With the trial space mission behind them there was no more need for Tony to conduct his daily simulator rotations, so he had told Steve that Colonel Phillips had requested him to remain in the hangar during the patrols to ensure that there would be no further problems with the X-302 aircraft.
They’re finally going to meet!  We’ll get to see that in the next chapter. 😊
"This is… really nice!" Gwen stated as she worked her way down the food line, taking a bit of everything as Peter piled his plate high with shrimp, meatballs, and wings. "You sure seem like you're hungry!"
Tony's lower lip started to shake, his eyebrows knitting together into the look of anguish that Steve had come to dread.
"Shh, big guy, it's all right," Tony said. "I've got you."
We’re getting close to the end!
"Ah huh," whispered Tony as he aimed his repulsor, targeting one of his monitors. He felt the suit power up and the targeting system take aim, waiting for his command.
"Sounds good," Steve said, giving Tony's shoulder a squeeze. "Then let's get started. Tomorrow morning, 0800 at the training dome. I'll inform Natasha and Clint. And Thor too, maybe this'll give him the jolt of energy he needs to get back on his feet."
"Oh, that sounds good. I'm looking forward to it," Peter said. He looked down at his unfinished dinner, shoving a few more bites of fish into his mouth so he didn't look too rude, even though everything he'd already eaten was just sitting in the pit of his stomach like a massive brick.
"Yeah," Peter murmured as he cupped her cheek in his palm. He leaned in, pressing their lips together in a kiss that instantly sent a burst of warm fuzzies scattering throughout his body, and had him panting by the time they broke apart.
"I don't
"Nah, the actual Decathlon competition isn't even until April, so I have loads of time to finish the essay. I'm just—"
"Yeah, I got it, Pete. But you know Phillips isn't the real problem, right?"
Steve swallowed hard, squaring his shoulders. "I will, Mr Stark. That's a promise."
But on the other hand, just like Stacy had said about Gwen, Steve knew how much Peter adored Gwen, and how devastated he would be if they were forced to end their relationship against their will. Gwen complimented Peter in ways that reminded Steve of his and Tony's relationship, and to lose her would not only break Peter's heart, but Steve and Tony's as well.
"Oh, shit!" Peter murmured under his breath, shivering as his Spider Sense activated, sending a series of icy bolts down his back.
"Kid?" Mr Toomes said, tilting his head. "You lost or something?"
"No, no, you didn't wake me," she said, brushing the damp hair from his eyes. "I was just on my way to check your vitals when I heard you coughing."
He was just getting started on his closing procedures when Tony walked through the door, looking absolutely exhausted.
The woman's glare intensified, her fists clenched at her sides. "I've been in places a lot more secure than this one," she said, jerking her head towards the pager. "Why do you have that? Where's Fury?"
All of which were made worse by Tony's constant worry over Peter, and the millions of unanswered questions they had about what was happening to him.
The truth was, the blaring alarm clock aside, Tony had felt none of the usual awkwardness he'd always had when disentangling after sex, none of the panic he'd always felt when anyone had tried to get too close to him in the past, and, despite the fact that Steve was built like a literal god, none of the self-consciousness that he'd expected to feel during their sexual activities. While Tony knew that he wasn't exactly anything to sneeze at physically, he also knew there was no way he could compare to someone like Steve. But either Steve hadn't noticed or just didn't care, because over the course of their three lovemaking sessions during the night, Steve had showered Tony with more affection and passion than Tony had ever experienced ever in his life. Tony had always thought that he was a generous lover, but for someone who'd been as inexperienced as Steve had said he was, he was definitely a quick learner.
Phillips might even include a nice something in his post-race lecture, since Steve is the first swimmer he’s ever coached to an Olympic gold.  Maybe that will finally be enough to earn a break from his usual grumpy critiques about Steve’s stroke form, and his turns, and his touches.
"Course you have, Pete," Dad cut in.
Steve shot him a frown over the wall of his shower stall. "Well, that's comforting. Do you guys always sit around and talk about me when I'm not there?"
"Hey, babe," Tony said as Steve stepped inside his office, the cramped, stuffy room reminding him a lot of the cockpit of the first aircraft that he flew after joining the Air Corps, one that had not been designed by Tony.
"Whereas you're innately enhanced, like Pietro and Wanda. Yeah, we've been over this a million times already," Gwen said. She frowned as she tugged on her long, blonde ponytail. "What's up with you this morning?"
Tony watched as Steve's already pale face paled even more. "Well, it's my real name on that list, and Bucky's, and even Peter's… it even says Peter Stark-Rogers instead of Peter Stark, so… there's no harm in trying."
With a quick nod in Sharon's direction, Steve hurried from the room and out of the hospital, barely pausing to take a breath until he was on his motorcycle and racing back towards the barracks. It was so unlike him to lose himself in a conversation like that—and with a kid, no less, one that he'd never even met before—and it was throwing him for a far bigger loop than he cared to let on.
"Mmm, okay," Peter said warily. He jerked his head towards Barnes—
"Well, you might say I'm a volunteer of sorts," he said. "My friend, Sharon, who's your nurse, invites me to come and visit with the sick kids sometimes. She says it helps them to feel better."
He was shushed by Tony's armoured fingers brushing across his lips, his beautiful face etched in concern mixed with frustration. "I know what you want, babe, but I've already told you a million times that it ain't gonna happen. There's no way in hell I'm letting you do these raids without me, so you're just gonna have to let that idea go. We're in this thing together, right?"
"Peter's on a ventilator, Tony," Rhodey said. "He's still alive, but barely, and—"
"Oh, give me a break," said Natasha. "Weren't you just grumbling earlier today about how early the twins have to get up for school?"
particular point in time could only be described as fate. Nothing more, nothing less.
"All right," said Rogers, and Tony could've sworn that the flush on Rogers' cheeks grew even deeper, right along with the deep wrinkle between his eyebrows.
Peter thought as he closed his eyes, finally giving in to his exhaustion.
"I'm fine, Tony," Steve said, trying not to sound impatient. He hadn't been finished yet, but he had a feeling that Tony was going to insist that he was.
"Then make sure you guys watch your backs," Sam said, swooping over Tony's head, his dual guns blazing. "I don't really feel like having any civilian casualties on my hands today."
“Tony!” he cried, his fingernails digging into Tony’s skin.  “Sweetheart, I’m gonna come!”
"Thanks, Rhodey," he whispered. He tore off a chunk of the muffin, shoving it into his mouth as he reached for the pills and the coffee cup. He tossed the pills back, swallowing them down with a big gulp of coffee, which was so hot that it burned a raw path down his throat as he swallowed it. Tony didn't care, though. At least it helped remind him that he was still alive.
"Yeah, that's what I thought," James muttered, rolling his eyes. "JARVIS, tell Bruce to meet us in the infirmary, will ya?"
Pushing himself up from his chair, Tony dropped the tablet onto the table with a clatter and shuffled back over to Peter's bed, climbing in next to him and brushing the hair off his forehead. His heart gave a leap when he thought he saw Peter's lips twitch at his touch, but it was there and gone again so fast that he realised a moment later he had probably only imagined it.
Peter thought frantically.
As if the original battle hadn't been just that.
"Papa?" he whispered.
Papa looked over at Dad, his eyes scanning Dad’s face.  “Tony—”
"And if I'm right, which I always am," he said. "Then it'll not only be able to help you, but Pete and Bucky as well."
—they absolutely had to continue with the status quo, no matter how hard it was going to be.
"All right people, just don't let it slip your minds while you're up there playing that you actually have a patrol to conduct," said Phillips over the comm. "See ya back at the barn."
"Yep. I'll be there."
Which only made the fact that Steve was now missing all that much worse.  The thought of having to tell Peter that his papa was missing, maybe even presumed dead—
And now, with Thanos' defeat, they could all hopefully find some peace.
"Damn right."
"Oh gods, Pete, don't say stuff like that," Tony rasped. "Now's not the time to be giving up."
" Tony exclaimed, his eyebrows shooting up. "Who authorised you to do that?"
"You're sure I look okay though?" Steve asked. He'd chosen his favourite blue t-shirt and a pair of soft, well-worn jeans since they were going to be outside on the grass, but he was already second-guessing himself. Or more like tenth-guessing, if he was honest.
Tony thought as he crouched down to retrieve the soap.
"Don't be afraid to grovel," said Bucky. He gave Steve a rather knowing wink. "Just between you and me, I've been known to do that from time to time."
Really?"
"I think it's a great idea," Tony said, giving Steve a playful glare. "Otherwise you'll have to court-martial that stomach of yours for insubordination, and I am certain that's a hassle you don't need."
"I'm just thinking, honey, okay?" Tony said, trying to not sound too snippy. "Got a bit on my mind."
"Very good, sir."
All Tony knew for sure was that he had never felt so helpless in his entire life.  Not even the awful half a year after Regina’s deception was discovered, and he was regularly getting peeled out of muddy ditches in Jersey after trashing nightclubs, compared to this.
that I am going to any doctor or hospital, so you can just get that right outta your head right the hell now!"
"Here we go," Steve said under his breath as T'Challa took off running. A heartbeat later Steve took off as well, matching T'Challa stride for stride as the entire plain filled with the sound of thundering footsteps, drowning out the hair-raising snarl of the war dogs.
"Then it'll have to do," said Sam. "Let's move out."
"Yes, ma'am. Very clear."
“Shh, honey, I know.  Just… c’mere, yeah?” Tony murmured as he tugged on Steve’s shoulder, relief slamming into him like a tsunami when Steve unwound his frozen limbs and turned towards him.  As best as he could, Tony gathered Steve into his arms, tucking his head under his chin.  “I know you need help, and I know you can’t do it alone.  That's why I’m promising you right now that I’m not gonna leave your side.  We’re gonna beat this thing back whatever it takes, okay?  You, me, and Pete.  Together.”
From Ma's stories, the initial days following the Battle of the Continents were some of the darkest days that Langara had ever seen. Aside from being literally thrown into the dark by the loss of the main power plant, leaving the country without any reliable sources of electricity, the death of both President Whitmore and General Hammond had caused the military to descend into such chaos that until Colonel O'Brien stepped in to take the reigns, almost ninety-five percent of the population feared that Meridia was only days away from eliminating them completely.
Grandpa shook his head, laying a wrinkled hand on Peter's shoulder. "Ah don't worry about me, young man, it's you that we should be worried about. At least that's what Tony's always saying."
"Well, at least he got that right," Tony said.
Peter thinks.
“Yeah.”  Releasing Steve’s hand, Tony stepped back, giving Steve a final once-over.  “Well, I gotta say,
Steve shook his head, shrugging. "I was scared," he admitted. "Once I realised that he was your son I just panicked because I thought you'd get upset if you knew that I was visiting with him when you couldn't. I know how protective you are with him, and with his condition I didn't want to do anything that might upset either of you."
He just really wished he could be part of it.
But somehow, as Peter slowly pulled on some clean clothes and ran his wet fingers through his unruly curls, he also had the sinking feeling that it was only a matter of time before the bill became law, and then—
"This isn't—it's not really very nice," Steve murmured as he unlocked the door to his room, leading Tony inside. Since the barracks were considered a nonessential section of the base the whole building was dark, the moonlight shining through the window the only thing illuminating the rather small but extremely tidy room. A floor-to-ceiling bookshelf stood against the cement-block wall opposite the double bed, with a small bedside table, a footlocker, and a narrow door that led to what Tony assumed was the sink and toilet over in the opposite corner.
, which, Peter quickly decided, he was
Tony's brown eyes were glassy as he reached his left hand up to cover Steve's. "You know I can't. But, honey, what if we just end up screwing things up even more? What if we—?"
Tony watched in awe as the hologram began to shrink, the nanites absorbing into the holographic container like they had been vacuumed up until the container was the only thing remaining. Then he stepped forward, aligning the container against his mid-chest, directly over his scars from the arc reactor.
"Yeah, that's my Uncle James, he's been staying with me," answered Peter. "Well, one of my Uncle Jameses. I actually have two of 'em."
More tears poured down Peter's cheeks as he clung to his father, his mind racing with all the horrible ways that HYDRA could make his papa suffer for trying to destroy them.
"Oh. 'Cause that doesn't sound ominous or anything," James muttered. "Maybe you ought to add that part to your bedtime story, hmm?"
Dad rolled his eyes, glowering at Dr Strange's back as the wizard turned a corner, out of sight. Then he turned to Peter and raised his right hand, tapping him first on his left shoulder, then on his right, almost like he was knighting him.
"Home. That sounds like a plan," Tony murmured. He spun around, winding his arms around Steve's neck. "Damn, but you really scared the hell out of me! Don't you ever do that again!"
Steve glanced over at Tony, who gave an almost imperceptible nod.
“All right, honey,” he said, clutching Steve’s hand.  “You said this guy’s name is Sam?”
With a final nod, Steve hurried back to the rest of the team, still huddled underneath the wizards' shields.
"No, I wasn't asleep yet," Peter said. "Trying to finish up another drawing first."
It’s definitely something he’ll never get tired of hearing.  And after today, as long as things go Steve’s way, he’ll be hearing it for the next four years too.
"I thought I'd give you a little rubdown first," he whispered into Tony's ear as he placed his hands on Tony's shoulders, carefully digging into his worry-tightened muscles. "Just try and relax, sweetheart. I'm gonna take good care of you."
"It doesn't matter," Peter cut in. "Just… send that exact position to my phone, please."
"That's right. And you love me for it," said Steve. "And because of that, I'm going to be setting some rules, all right? First, you're gonna let me take care of you until JARVIS and I both say you're completely better, is that understood?" He raised his hand, cutting off Tony's attempted protest. "No arguing, sweetheart."
Tony stood back as the pilots filtered out of the room, collecting his notes and trying very hard to not notice that Captain Rogers' standard-issue Air Corps plain white t-shirt did absolutely nothing to hide the rippling muscles across his back and shoulders.
Despite all of Steve and Tony's attempts to ignore the inevitable, Peter was growing up, and it wouldn't be too much longer before he went away to college and mornings like these would only be a memory. And Steve was determined to enjoy every single possible second he got with Peter before that happened.
Davis gave a short nod. "And asked by whom?"
But if that was the case, why would those shipments include exploding bullets?  And why would anyone need bullets that explode in the first place?  Why not just use a bomb?
Steve's luscious lips curled into a slight smile. "Yes, I'm sure I will. And I do understand about the suit. It's just that usually you have me try out a new suit in training a couple times before I take it on a mission."
Loki and Rhodes looked at the boy, who’s color was now also draining, his face becoming very pale. Tony grabbed his head and he started feeling light-headed. He then went over everything that was said. It was almost background noise when everyone was talking as he just panicked and focused on his father apparently being dead. Now he brought it the forefront of his mind and went over each word.
Tony leaned against Rhodey’s flank and gave a dramatic sigh.
Steve and Sam shared a look and Steve was about to reach for his shield when an arrow lodged itself in the leaders neck. The bandits and three friends stared in shock as the man grabbed his throat. Suddenly the bandit next to the leader had their throat slashed. They also grabbed their throat but quickly fell to the ground. Just as quickly the other bandits either had arrows suddenly poking out from their necks or were being slashed and stabbed. Until it was over, just as quickly as it had began and the three were left with the bodies.
Tony walked through the portal and held up a hand to stave off any words Loki may be ready to throw at him.
“Of course I am!”
Clint had been the one to spot Tony incapacitate two of the bandits. Afterwards he didn’t share his findings so as to save face with the merchants. The Avengers couldn’t gush that, ‘wow one of them could fight really well’. That should be a given.
His mother had given him such a look at that. Though she may agree (Thor was uncertain but felt she did) she and he knew that was a hot button for Odin. And so the argument had carried on and grown in volume.
Luckily everyone was still whole and hail. They had some close calls but no one had been grabbed or seriously damaged by Jörmungandr. Though Tony had been right, it was impossible to pin the creature down. He kept shrinking and growing in order to dodge, evaid, and strike.
A few months later, Bucky and Sam had gotten a dog together. Both guys weren’t into the idea of marriage.  Plus they had been together for so long they were already considered a married couple. So to solidify their partnership they got a dog. Clint, who had his own dog (Lucky), was ecstatic because now Lucky had a playmate. Pepper and Happy were in the middle of moving in together and Bruce was just showing off the engagement ring he had bought for Betty. An idea started to buzz around in Tony’s head and a feeling began to form in Steve.
“Just a few.” Steve teased.
“...I feel like a keep failing everyone I love. I loved my parents and failed them. I loved Peggy and now I failed her to.” A beat of silence passed then Steve let out “I couldn’t save, or even help, any of them….I couldn’t do anything! I can’t do anything.”
“I may throw up.” Tony attempted to joke but it sounded more honest than he meant it to.
“I just want to help people. I hope we run into bandits so we can deal with them rather than the next person.” Bucky and Sam nodded in agreement.
“Asgard is the birthplace of the gods, Steven. It’s water has mystical properties. I have used it before and seen it’s results. It will change your body into that of the perfect soldier boy.”
“We need a name.” Clint complained as they traveled.
Thor sat up, and gave his lover a puzzled look. “I merely said your bed head is similar-”
With minimal reluctance everyone ran around the house towards the back. Finally, once everyone was in view they saw Tony riding on the back of a black, dark skinned, centaur. The two appeared to be doing tricks, as Tony would stand or do other acrobatics while on the centaurs back. Though it may have been a game, as the two kept shouting numbers at each other and sometimes “point” or “denied”, followed by laughter and some good natured teasing.
Loki let out a mean laugh. “Did he tell you that?!”
“...And for what?!” Steve barked, looking crazed for a moment. “Just so he could keep living!”
That being said if someone could help me in getting rid of the giant spaces between paragraphs, please do so. I am lost. TWO THUMBS WAY WAY UP For deadgloves! THANK YOU SO MUCH for helping me with this!!!
“As long as he listens to what I told him, the night should go great.” Natasha said confidently.
Howard then touched a crack in a boulder and the map glowed, then the crack fissured into a black and green swirling portal.
“No!” Tony bit back. “I don’t. But I do know that we’ll need him. So we need to go beseech him.” With that Tony began walking towards Thor’s temple.
“Evade. We only came for the Hulk.”
“Shit!” Sam swore, rubbing his forehead.
“Nay. I am not.” Thor confessed then ran a hand through his hair. “I have been trying to figure out how Loki could have owned Tony.”
The Scepter of the Dead allowed the wielder to look into the story of the shade it examined. It also showed the souls linked to the shade, who they are, and how they were tied together.
“Yes!” Bucky proclaimed in a self-righteous manner. “Stevey do you know how many people I’ve had in my bed?”
“So you’ll let me talk to father?”
doubt, Lord Odin was power hungry. He was the heir! He would have gotten everything eventually! If that was true all he had to do was wait, not start and win a rebellion against Bestla.”
Steve lied. Steve didn’t love him. He was an idiot! He fell for the “i’d never hurt you” cliche. He fell for all the cliches. He fell in love with Steve and thus never asked the right questions. No wonder Rhodey and Loki and everyone thought he could be manipulated so easily. Because it was true.
“Yes!” Bucky shot back then returned his attention to Steve “You ran in without a plan, acted all flustered, I mean Stevey; you couldn’t even put a sentence together!”
“What is this?” Steve gasped.
At first she didn’t react and Tony assumed she hadn’t heard him. He couldn’t seem to get his voice to work, his voice was quieter than he wanted it to be but his nerves prevented him from raising it to the volume he wanted.
“Thor my darling!” She greeted cheerfully. “What a surprise!” She made her way to him but Thor side stepped her.
Steve tried to touch Tony but the man flinched away from him. Still gaping and looking like his whole world was rocked Tony stumbled away.
Never look back, only forward!
“I need you to do some recruiting.” Loki said in form of greeting. They were in the study and Loki was looking through a few papers. Though he gave Tony a glance as he gave his orders. “I have a candidate in mind I just need you to get him to sign on.”
“You have been the one always keeping everything from me!” Thor yelled. “But you doubt me? I should doubt you! Words mean nothing to you! How am I to know you have not broken our promise?!”
Loki had recruited a handful of monsters but trying to get them to do anything other than torture lost/deserving shades was a useless endeavor. Even his favorite pets wouldn’t do as he requested. Fenrir only growled at shades and tried to use them as chew toys. And Jörmungandr was even worse, he would lay about and coil in odd areas, impeding shades travels rather than help them.
“Everyone?!” Sam echoed.
“It’s a monster. Probably trying to lure us over so it can kill us.” Bucky surmised and Steve gave a nod of agreement and they made to turn around.
Thor landed in the Palace of Hel and found the throne room empty.
“So I say again.” Thor broke in with a bright grin “We must have him over!”
For a while both Tony and Loki just breathed, stewing in their anger. Eventually, Loki’s blue began to recede. Tony ran his fingers through his hair in order to calm his own anger. They locked eyes for a moment and Loki could see Tony still believed in those mortals words. Loki let out a frustrated breath then thought over everything Tony said. Suddenly something clicked and he looked over to Tony who gave him a guarded but questioning look.
Like it or not, Peter was going to space.
"Okay, but here's the thing, Scott," said Bruce from his perch just inside the van's dual back doors. "Tony and I understand the basic premise behind what you call the Ant-Man suit. But what you're describing, this whole Quantum Realm thing, it just goes against all the laws of physics that we know."
"You two go on, one of my convoy foremen has some more questions about the routes for the rest of the week," Dad said with a frown. "I'm gonna have to call him once we get upstairs."
This chapter is a bit on the fluffier side, as I think our boys deserve a bit of a break! Please also be aware that I have changed the rating from T to M, as there is a scene about 2/3 of the way through that I felt pushed the T-rating a bit too far. :)  To me it’s not much more detailed than what I’ve previously written, I just wanted to be on the safe side.  😊
"No, no no!" Steve exclaimed as he felt the all-too-familiar tug behind his naval, indicating he was about to be yanked out of the tunnel. "No, please! Not yet!"
"It's nothing, mo grá," Steve said quickly. "But Peter's doing just fine. Bucky told me last night that they've been getting in all kinds of trouble."
One of the many ways he resembled Steve.
"I'm not hurt, honey," Tony said quickly. "I just…" He trailed off, unable to find the words.
Emoji Key for those who don't know what to say in the comments!
“What in the goddamn
As if in slow motion, Steve watched his son fall, bracing himself for the explosion that he knew was coming.
"Well, can't say that I blame ya," said Tony. "But if he is telling the truth, it can't hurt to have the support. I know he's not exactly the mayor or anything, but he does run one of the largest police precincts in the city."
"Mmm." The fact that Peter couldn't even seem to look him in the eye just reinforced that something else was wrong, but unfortunately now was not the time to be delving any deeper into it.
"It's only seventy-eight days, right? We can do this."
"Sweetheart?" Steve suddenly said from behind him, curling an arm around his waist. "Are you okay?"
Rogers' gaze flicked to Tony then, and as the two brilliant pools of perfect azure blue met his own, a flash of something that Tony hadn't felt in a very long time lit up deep inside his gut, so strongly that it almost frightened him. Tony gulped as he instinctively tried to stamp down the unfamiliar sensation, locking it back away where it belonged. Now was
“Which is exactly how Dr Erskine would've wanted it,” Steve rasped.  His discussions with the slight, kindly German-American doctor may have been few due to his gruesome murder by HYDRA, but Steve had still been able to glean enough information in those discussions to know that Dr Erskine would have never wanted his serum formula to fall into anyone’s hands who he deemed less than trustworthy.
"I ran out and got them some more, but it has been awhile since we've been to the grocery store, so I was thinking we could go tomorrow night after dinner," added Papa. "As long as you're done with your homework."
"I'm so sorry, little guy," he sobbed, his tears dripping down to wet Peter's blankets. "I am so sorry that we weren't here with you."
"Yeah, yeah, I know," Tony muttered. "Just… work as fast as you can, but no cutting corners, yeah? We can't risk anything getting into the Tower's systems that's not supposed to be there."
A trust that Steve had not even come close to breaking.
"What?" protested Tony. "No—!"
"Yeah, I know, but… why'd he listen to you?"
"I swear to God, big guy, you had better have called me in here for something more than this," Tony interrupted. "'Cause I'm sure it's no surprise that my patience is wearing a bit thin lately, so—"
"Is he?" Steve whispered, so softly it was barely audible, his eyes flicking up towards Peter. "Are you sure he's—?"
It took about three more seconds for Steve's mind to finally catch up with itself, and he was barely able to stop his eyebrows before they knitted together into a frown. Tony had suspected that O'Brien's insistence on a personal meeting couldn't mean anything good, and while Steve had tried to assure him that his concerns were unwarranted, his usual optimism, already tempered by his own guilt, just didn't seem to want to cooperate.
"All right," repeated Sam. "How so?"
"That's what our readings are telling us down here too, honey," said Tony. "Carol's first satellite should deploy in about sixteen minutes."
Pressing his fingers to his lips, Tony blew Peter a kiss before turning towards his own bedroom, setting his stuff down on the desk and activating the small oil lamp he kept for his nighttime work. The lamp flickered for a few seconds before finally illuminating, and Tony groaned as he noticed the low level of the lamp's oil reserves. He'd have to pick up some more the next time he was at the market.
"Oh, shit!" Rhodey exclaimed as one of Hammer's suits started to lift off from the floor. "Tony, whatever you're gonna do you better do it now, 'cause I'm pretty sure we're out of time!"
“Yeah,” Peter whispered.  “Daddy, do you think Obie’s selling weapons to the insurgents in Sokovia?  I mean… that’s where all the signs seem to be pointing here.”
"Well, you've been using that excuse ever since the school year started, so pardon me if I don't quite believe you," said Gwen. "Did something new happen?"
Peter had to make sure that Papa got home. Whatever it took.
"Young Starkson!" Thor exclaimed as he pulled Peter into such a tight hug that Peter's back cracked. "It is so, so good to see you again!"
Tony nodded as he took a sip from the cup of coffee Rhodey had brought him about half an hour ago, along with the news that Steve's patrol shift was going to be cut short by one hour so that the X-302 aircraft could undergo a more thorough maintenance check.
"Yeah," he muttered. "Sorry."
Natasha said, low and tight. "I know, because we're all there. We're all feeling the exact same way. Stunned, horrified, shocked, whatever word you feel like using. But I just can't shake the feeling that this isn't it. That this isn't the whole story. And if whoever's on the other end of that pager can offer us some more information, then I think it's at least worth a try."
Which was pretty much the same thing the military government did when they took power. From what Grandpa had told Peter, the restrictions that they imposed on the civilian population were so severe that they were basically unsustainable, but that no one was able to push back against them because there was such an overwhelming sense of panic due to the horrific Battle of the Continents and the nationwide power outage. By the time the outage had been addressed—with the temporary fix that was still in place to that day—the time for concerted pushback had long passed, and anyone who dared to try and complain was quickly "taken care of".
"But… that doesn't make any sense?" said Bucky. "He's only a kid! What good does it do to punish a kid for something his grandfather did?"
"Rhodey!" Tony shouted as he dove towards the ground. From what he had already seen of the Hammer suits in action he could tell that they couldn't bank worth a damn, just like the Chitauri equipment on which they were based.
Or during the entire year when Peter was missing?
The very wormhole that was causing all of their current problems was proof of it.
"Not like we can do anything about it," Peter grumbled. "And we were here first anyway, so…"
Tony's face was ashen as he nodded, his hand clutching Steve's in a vice-like grip.
Steve thought as he started to drift off. Because for all of their talk about saving the universe, if he and Tony hadn't been able to bring Peter back in the process, Steve was absolutely certain that Tony wouldn't have survived it.
Loki just rolled his eyes again then smiled when he felt his magic find Jörmungandr. Turning around Jörmungandr popped into the center of the Throne Room. Loki reached out his arms and Jörmungandr slithered over to him and wrapped his body around Loki’s arm and then neck. Loki stroked the snake and smiled.
“Not enough time to move it. Can you fit into that pot?”
Tony flinched and averted his face in guilt. But then he lifted it back up. “I had to.” He admitted, “But you know what? You didn’t have to.” His tone became cold as did his glare. Steve however met the look straight on and didn’t seem impressed or intimidated.
“It’s not ideal but this is the best plan.” Steve argued. “We know that it’s not perfect!” He almost shouted, the frustration of this continued debate shining through. “But we don’t have a lot to stand on here! We can’t accuse Minos of everything so openly.”
“Tones, not everyone is like that. Heros are all over and they aren’t-”
Tony and the Avengers watched the wolf run away, Tony with a wistful smile and the Avengers with absolute bafflement. Tony then took a deep breath to steel himself and turned to face them. His face quickly turned to one of concern as he took in Sam’s bloody leg.
“We do need Thor. You and I will go to his temple and get his help.”
“You’re a True Hero! You can use your boon to get him back!” Clint and the rest of the Avengers seemed hopeful at this idea, all except Steve and Thor.
“It’s the hair!” Bucky barked out and that sent Thor into laughter.
Tony raised an eyebrow as the wild haired brunette ran into battle. He then turned to the other man standing next to him.
Rhodey had needled the god about missing them; but Loki had retorted that Rhodey would need them to come back to work. And Tony would of course want a break from the insufferable land of the living every now and then, and he would always have his room in Hel open to him. Loki had also brought up Fenrir and Jörmungandr but Rhodey had tuned him out and just kept giving an over-the-top nod of understanding, which he knew frustrated Loki to no end.
Happy Holidays everyone!!
Currently, Pepper, Tony, Rhodey, and Jarvis were all relaxing as Tony complained about Loki’s moods. Thor’s last visit did not help matters like Tony had hoped they would. Instead for the past year Loki seemed more angry and irritable than ever.
“Really? You’re going to deny it?! Even now?!” Tony gestured all around as if to encompass the chaos of their situation.
“Stop!” Tony begged, turning to give Loki a pleading look but Loki didn’t look away from the Avengers.
“Hard to miss that, with how well we have you all advertised.” Betty laughed.
“I failed again.” Steve whispered, glancing up at the sea. He then went back and clung to Tony. “I’m so sorry Tony.”
“Why don’t we start with you.” She pointed her finger at Steve and Tony pulled harder.  “Yes!” She smiled wider.
“Tony!”
“I’ve thought about this for...a long time now.” Steve confessed still staring at the rings. “Peggy told me not to go after her.” A deep inhale “She said to only carry her ring, nothing else.” He swallowed a large lump in his throat and Sam got up to sit next to his friend.
“Steve, no!” She fired back, looking the blonde dead in the eyes. “He’s the god of the dead AND mischief. He’ll let Tony go then stab him in the back.”
Steve jogged to catch up to his friends. Clint and Sam seemed to have a race going on, as they were far ahead of everyone. While Natasha and Bruce were walking with Bucky, watching to make sure he didn’t stumble on the cliff side.
“It’s the crowd!” Bruce deduced. Sam, Bucky, and Clint immediately formed a barrier around Tony and Steve and began ushering the crowd back.
Pepper shook her head as she followed the Avengers up towards the palace. Clint was right, this was a bad idea. Happy had sent his note to Tony, however Loki of course got it first. To say he was angry at hearing the very much alive Avengers were in his realm was an understatement. He had stormed into Tony’s room and demanded Pepper follow him back to the throne room. He then put a magical seal on Tony’s door keeping Tony and Jarvis trapped inside. In the Throne Room, the god had told Pepper of the Avenger’s and Happy’s request for aide. Loki then ordered her to guide the Avengers to Peggy’s soul. He wanted them gone and was adamant that she only return when they had departed.
“Well let’s continue to get him packed up then, shall we?” Jarvis spoke into the following silence.
“Well, I never liked bullys. I’ve always tried to stand up to them but,” He gestured to himself. “Never made much of a difference. So I guess I’ll now be able to stand up to them and make a difference.”
Tony professed how he couldn’t imagine life without Steve and never wanted to. Cameras from passerby’s phones were already up and on the couple. Tony looked so scared, so hopefully. Steve loved Tony so of course he said yes.
Tony and Steve were two people that should have never met, but they did. A fateful rainy day involving a broken motorcycle and a run from the paparazzi ended up with them meeting, talking, and exchanging information. Then it seemed once they had spoken to each other they couldn’t stop. Lunch breaks, late night calls, coffee runs, and movie nights; all these things tumbled together till both Tony’s and Steve’s friends became curious and met the respective new friend.
“You?! You have no authority here!” He laughed and gestured to Hel. “This is not your realm. You have no deal you could offer.”
“Tony! Wait!” Steve called but Thor grabbed the blonde and held him back. Steve gave Thor a questioning look but the god only gave a small ‘no’ head shake.
“He’s over here.” Bucky announced as he exited the carriage. The kid then ran to give the hero a hug.
“Loki” Thor whined. “Put the scrolls down. Much time has passed since we last saw each other and I do not wish to waste it.” Thor whined as he wrapped his arms around the dark haired gods waist.
“He just likes them!” Tony shouted, making sure to get Amora to focus back on him. “Thor’s spent all this time here with them. Because he likes them. As friends. That’s it!”
Steve was ripped. He was taller and filled out. He had bulging muscles, that were still pulsing from the transformation. He definitely beat Bucky in physical form now. He wasn’t as buff as Thor but still, he was more defined than Bucky ever thought possible.
“There! Let me finish.” He reprimanded. “You can earn your freedom, but you must do just that. You must
It was like a small village. Huts and homes of various sizes sat next to each other, all housing different creatures. At first Tony was terrified of the place and stayed glued to Rhodes back when they were there. It didn’t help that after some creatures found out Tony was Loki’s slave they thought that entitled them to use him as they wanted as well. Ordering him to fetch them items, and demeaning him. Rhodey had stood up for his charge but he knew Tony still dreaded every minute spent in the Village.
“Uh-yeah, I gu-ESS!” Tony gasped as Thor gave him a tighter squeeze. The blonde then released a staggering Tony and marched inside.
“Are you going to be ok?”
“It really was.” Bucky agreed.
They answered at the same time.
Howard knelt in front of Tony and attempted to grab his shoulders but his hands fell through. He threw Loki a pleading look and with a wave of Loki’s hand his color returned and his body was whole again.
Tony swore he meant to pull away and not to deepen the kiss. But the man was weak. Other than a few incubuses that worked in Hel, he had little experience in kissing (incubuses didn’t quite care for kissing). He definitely had no experience in kissing people. And Steve was a great kisser.
Frigga gave a smile filled with mirth. “I will bestow the title myself.”
“Howard must have gone alone and fallen for Loki’s tricks thus resulting in him failing.”
(See the end of the chapter for
1. I like Bruce and Betty <3 I don’t understand why they’re not a more popular couple.
Loki’s eyes were wide and his mouth hung open in devastation as he swayed back a few steps. Tony made to reach out to him also looking pained.
“Tony,” Steve began softly, rubbing circles on their clasped hands. “I know we didn’t start off great. And I’ve probably shown you the worst in me already but…” He looked over Tony’s face as if taking stock of every detail. Then in a sincere and firm yet gentle tone he continued. “I want you to know. I would never,
Tony stood stock still but was soon accompanied by an older looking shade. The man scanned the room then gave a shrewd look to Tony.
“I don’t have my freedom now. You know that right?” Tony laughed as he followed the shade into his room.
“I missed you Mama!” Tony cried as he continued to cling to her.
“Huh? How do you feel useless?”
