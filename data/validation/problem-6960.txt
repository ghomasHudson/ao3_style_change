Then Steve heard it again — a low, miserable whimper of pain, followed by the sound of someone being sick in the toilet. Steve was running to the bathroom before he was even aware his feet were moving. "Tony—?" Steve gasped, skidding on the tile.
"Hey, hey," Steve shushed, brushing a few damp locks from Tony's face. "It's all good, Shellhead. I like seeing you gone on it." And,
, Tony thought with a giggle as Steve slammed her head into the wall. She dropped like a sack of potatoes, hitting the floor with a heavy
"Hey, don't worry about me," Tony said, looking up at Steve with a small, self-deprecating smile. "I'll be okay in no time, Winghead, yeah?"
Tony waited a moment for any kind of follow-up, but after about thirty seconds of silence Tony made a face, propping a hand on his hip. "So… I guess I'll just go get him then?"
Tony sighed, blissed. "I," he started with a conspiratory whisper, "am going to give you so many blowjobs."
"Okay," Tony said simply, reaching out to drop the bottle of lube in Steve's hand, to curl Steve's fingers proprietarily around the clear plastic. He shifted backwards, his legs splaying, and Steve zeroed in on the bob of Tony's half-hard cock against his thigh. Tony shifted, moved to turn over on his stomach, and Steve reached out a hand, settled it gently over the curve of Tony's hip. "O-oh," Tony murmured, a gentle blush slipping over his cheekbones. "I thought—?"
Steve rolled his head to the side so he could look up from under his golden lashes at Tony, all wet and dark and clumped together. "That's a boy," Tony murmured. "Okay, listen, Steve, listen very carefully to me, darling, you, you can't keep putting your fist through the wall, alright? You're beating yourself up faster than you can heal—"
"I'll have you know those dates are sometimes the highlight of my day," Tony sniffed, grabbing some of the industrial grade soap and scrub brushes from the shelf across from him. Beside him, Cap grunted again, pulling a shard of glass out of his half-healed skin and Tony cursed. "Oh, hell, Cap, let me do that."
," Tony moaned, palming himself a bit more urgently through his slacks, fighting against the whimper that wanted to rise up in his throat. "Oh honey, yes, yes,
Steve huffed out a laugh. "Right, right," he grumbled and smacked one final kiss to Tony's lips. Tony laughed, pushing at his chest and twirling on his toes.
"Steve," Tony said again, and Steve finally turned back to look at Tony, his feet stomping to either side of the treadmill. The sound of it was agony to his migraine. Steve's fingers tightened around his wrist, and Tony imagined he could hear his bones creaking. "Steve, I would like for you to let go of me now," Tony said, very slowly, pulling back on his hand.
"No slippers or tequila in the decon pack, sorry," Jan said, sticking her tongue out with a little smirk.
person—would be trying to find someone Steve would actually want were he capable of consenting, not— not thinking about offering himself up on a silver platter for the man. A good man would go find a nice good girl for Steve to fuck, and then another nice girl when the first one got tired, and so on and so forth.
, with Tony's body soft and open and yielding beneath him just made Tony feel so proud and accomplished that
Tony moaned, shuddered again down to his toes, felt his asshole spasm weakly around Steve. More come leaked out of him, and Tony whimpered into his fists. "
"Jarvis," Tony started, sipping at a martini. "Will you bring me my pills? And some Zofran, if you would."
"I gotcha honey," Tony said again, grabbing at the elastic and easing it down over Steve's cock, under his balls. It was already glistening with precome, a trail of it oozing from the head, and Tony couldn't help himself, he leaned forward and sucked it up so gently, like it was the sweetest of candies.
Tony shuddered. "Come now, darling— all this time we've spent together and you haven't figured out I like it when you rough me up?" he rasped, shivering under Steve's attentions. His mind was— was starting to feel soupy again, soft and unfocused and completely the opposite of what he needed right now.
It must have been the right call. Tony shuddered again, melting back into Steve, pressing his head into the crook of Steve's neck. Steve could hear the sounds of the monitors picking up, tied to Tony's O₂ stats, his heartbeat. Steve reached back, grabbed the lube from his pocket again. Pressed so tight together like this, Steve could feel every twitch, every hitch in his breath. He could feel Tony's tight hole, hot under his fingertip, slicky smeared with cold lube. Tony was always so tight, at first — tough to to relax, to unclench every muscle he kept on lockdown. Bottoming was harder on Tony, Steve knew; and not just physically, but mentally, as well. He got anxious (both about the actual penetration and his body's reaction to it), which certainly didn't help matters, and Steve had the distinct impression that he'd had lovers who'd treated him… poorly, in the past, to say the least. Then there was also the matter of how damn big Steve was. Honestly it was a gift, being able to make love to Tony like that, considering the numerous odds stacked against them and this time was no different, regardless of whether or not Tony's body would cooperate with them.
could make himself vulnerable for Steve, then so could he. "Excited," Steve clarified, and even saying that much sent that same tingling rush of anticipation singing through his veins. "I was excited— I
— a bone-deep ache that Tony felt from his shoulders all the way down to his feet. "Please, you still need—"
"Shh," Tony whispered; his lips, dry but warm, slid sweetly against his own, almost chaste in comparison to all their kisses until now. "You just lie there and let me take care of you, my darling. Don't come just yet. I'll tell you when." Tony shifted, and before Steve had time to panic that Tony wasn't touching them anymore, Steve could feel him again, lying between his spread legs, his forearms resting on either side of his hips. "Did you wash up like I asked you to?" Tony asked, his breath ghosting along the underside of his cock.
"What? Don't have to make my guy feel good?" Steve asked, angling the plug in purposefully towards Tony's prostate; Tony choked on his spit then, bowed his back sharply as he moaned, tossing his head in the sheets. "Don't have to thank you for showin' me such a good time?" Steve continued. The widest part of the plug slipped past Tony's hot, leaking asshole, all the way in to the base, and Steve pressed his hand to it, rocking the tip against Tony's prostate in the most intimate, almost-too-much massage that had Tony sobbing in his throat, kicking his feet back against the bed. "Yeah, I bet it's sensitive, isn't it?" Steve sympathised, rolling his palm in slow, deep circles around the base of the plug. Tony cried out, clung to the sheets as the fingers of Steve's other hand came up to play at the head of his cock, purple and swollen and slick with precome . "I really used you tonight," Steve whispered, lips curling into a small as Tony shuddered and whimpered underneath him. "Yeah, I did, didn't I, Shellhead? Used you all up, stuffed you full a' me." Steve's thumb swiped across the head of Tony's dick, spreading the slick there, knuckling in against Tony's perineum with his other hand.
Tony suddenly burst out laughing and said, “We usually kiss like this when we are trying to take our clothes
“Don't change the subject,” Steve sighed. “You can pretend to work for them. Delay them until someone comes to help.”
“You alright?” Panzer asked, lightly grasping his shoulder. Steve and the plane were gone and they were driving through the woods with the rest of the convoy around them. Tony gasped, “J-just a dream.”
“We should add more base,” Eddie said, reaching for the stopcock. Peter’s hand shot forward and grabbed Eddie’s arm before he could touch their experiment. He hissed, “If we add too much base it’ll dilute the solution and turn it to liquid! Wait, Ed!”
Used to his eccentrics, Logan leaned on the wall beside him and grunted in response. He was drinking out of a beer can that Wade recognized as being one of Logan’s favorites from Canada. Aw, Stark thought of everyone.
Steve watched him go with gritted teeth and it took all of his willpower not to slam his helmet on the ground or crush it in his hands. The man was infuriating! He seemed to know how to just get under his skin and make him feel like a belittled child.
He looked exactly like the man standing only a yard away from Tony…In the decades that had passed, this futuristic Bucky seemingly hadn’t aged a day. He looked like the same old Bucky…except…
Steve laughed but went back to kissing him and pressed his body into Tony’s, rocking his hips, and kneading Tony’s muscles with his hands. Tony all but melted under the touch.
“What about Tony??” A missile was shot from one of the helicopters and was going straight to the mansion.
! Just imagining Steve hurt usually upset Tony but imagining this – Tony felt like his stomach acids were eating him alive at the mere thought.
“Sorry, sweetie,” Peter murmured and leaned forward. His mask parted and he lightly kissed Wade. Wade was in his Deadpool suit so Peter’s kiss was on his mask and it was a handsome mask but Wade wanted to feel those lips.
Tony watched Steve out of the corner of his eye as they walked. His super soldier was happy. Since they left, he had been wearing a small, pleased smile and it delighted Tony to no end.
Tony pushed his friend aside and stalked up to the Winter Soldier. He ripped his cell phone out of his pocket and turned it on to display the image of his lock screen. The picture was of Steve, smiling bashfully at the camera, but smiling happily all the same.
How could he tell the man he loved he couldn’t be with him because he wouldn’t hold him back from falling in love with Sam?
wrong. Was there some kind of dastardly villain headed their way? Or was his mother’s lab going to explode?
“Come here, Peter,” his mother called and he did as she asked and sprinted to her side but every step made the tingling worse.
Tony had a safe house tucked away in Northern New York. It was deep into the Adirondacks, in the part of the woods with no roads and access only came from the sky. He had it built on the sly to originally escape the press but now, apparently, he needed it to escape the Nazi
It took Tony that same week to topple Hydra from the safety of his laptop as he sat next to Steve’s bedside.
He was wearing black tactical gear and had muck on his legs like he’d been running through the sewers. Peter eyed the black gear, knowing it was Venom. The Avengers had been keeping a close eye on Brock and, when the SHIELD doctors failed to separate them, he’d been sent to the super-human prison facility, the Vault, and kept him locked up until Eddie gained control over the symbiote. He’d been out since October and under FBI monitoring and supposedly helping them with their investigations…
Jim crossed his arms over his chest and murmured, “The way Steve was going on, I thought you were about to die…”
His hand met only open air and his eyes snapped open from the shock of it. He didn’t recognize the room and he immediately could tell something was off. Everything was too artificial and that radio broadcast…he sharply sat up and continued to listen. Yes, that was a game he had attended. They were playing a recording, trying to trick him into thinking he was safe.
Steve kissed his forehead and grasped the back of his head so he could press his lips deep into his flesh. They had lived at the tower for less than a year but it was already home. Steve promised, “Wish granted.” And Peter smiled happily at him.
Tony buried his face into Steve’s chest and clung onto him as he added in a soft voice, “Yensen didn’t make it.”
Steve sighed unhappily and pulled back from him. He noted, “You’re not happy that I mentioned Wade.”
He didn’t seem able to voice it and Tony didn’t want to say it either so he gently cupped Steve’s jaw and pulled him back to Tony’s face. Tony’s future was screwed no matter what so he did not really think much about the consequences as he brought their lips together. They gently kissed and held each other, almost afraid to let go. But the kiss ended and then Steve buried his face in the crook of Tony’s neck and tightened his arms around him.
He didn’t want to give it to Eddie. He shouldn’t have to hand it over to Eddie. He could keep it. He could refuse Eddie. Even better,
Instead the doctor came back with a rectangular item, smaller than a handheld radio and held it out to Steve. Steve stared at it blankly.
“And I don’t hear you objecting, Bionic Man,” Tony replied. When Bucky did not retort, Tony turned back to Steve, he said, “Part 6 is definitely going to work. Now that Natasha knows we can take a more direct approach. We just need Peter to do his wall crawling deal, carrying my awesome robot backpack, and th—.”
“Here’s the plan,” he stated. “We’re going to split into three teams. Natasha and Clint. Sam and Coulson. And Tony and I. Hopefully, we will get to the carriers while they are down but if they go airborne, Sam and Tony can fly us out and Clint can use one of his grappling arrows to get the two of you out before the helicarriers go down. These chips need to go into the motherboard in all three helicarriers or this mission is lost. Are we all ready?”
Tony made a choking noise and then shuddered against Steve with his release. As his shudders dwindled, he sunk further onto Steve until he was nothing but a heavy mass sitting on top of him. But his hand remained between them and he continued to jerk Steve off until he came too.
Venom stumbled to its knees, making groaning noises. The intercom was still on so it heard Tony gasp, “
They made love again and again. As he rocked his hips against Tony, he happened to notice something on his chest and paused mid-thrust.
Tony broke the kiss with a happy sigh and, when he opened his eyes, Steve still had his eyes closed like he expected Tony to keep kissing him. Tony smiled sweetly at his super soldier and teasingly reminded him, “The bedroom.”
For the press, all the Avengers shared small antidotes about Steve but it was nothing like the personal accounts they shared in the private ceremony but they exulted their friend’s courage and strength all the same.
Steve hissed and clutched his head. Blood began to seep from a laceration on his forehead. His eyes flickered to Tony inside the car. His boyfriend was enraged and by the way his hand went to his door handle Steve knew Tony was going to cause a scene.
Wade smirked and ran his head over his scalp. He seriously retorted, “I don’t want you being dragged in the mud with me…I’m just as different on the outside as I am on the inside and people don’t like different.”
Peter’s muscles tightened a fraction at the mention of Venom but he forced himself to relax and replied, “Wade saved my life. It’s a fact and I would be happy to clear up any rumors that state otherwise.”
“Yes, please!” Tony gasped and leaned heavily into his side. Steve wrapped an arm around him to better support him and to have an excuse just to touch him.
When they entered the crowded halls, Tony kept an eye out for Steve and listened to Howard as he updated him on his mother’s condition and asked his opinion on the flowers he purchased for her.
The doorbell rang and Bucky jumped to his feet and grabbed a vase off the side table beside him. He slammed it against the same table and had a weapon ready in seconds.
Peter flushed and glanced away from his dad and he replied, “Maybe? I don’t know…I was…I was thinking about spending the night at Wade’s…”
Steve nodded as his heart fluttered madly within his chest. He still couldn't believe this was happening – that this man was interested in Steve more than just his body. He could almost feel his heart reaching out to Tony's, yearning for that intimate contact that only people in love could share. They hadn't really progressed that far into the relationship but he was ready and his heart was already falling for the easygoing man with the most amazing smile.
When it originally got out that Tony found his soulmate and it was a man, the media went nuts. They reported that same-sex soulmates were outnumbered 1 to every 30 heterosexual couples in the country. They were rare but not unheard of, but, it was even rarer for it to happen to one of the select few the media deemed newsworthy.
“This place looks worse for wear than our old place,” Steve observed. He tried to smile and make it come out as sort of a joke but his voice was hoarse and he only sounded sad.
The mere sound of his voice was a precious treasure to Tony. He had never thought he’d hear it again. He still couldn’t believe he was here and he was going to hear that strong tone every day.
“We’ll still find time together…When we can,” Tony whispered, his voice nearly drowned out by the sound of the tumbling coals.
“I don’t understand how you can listen to my son’s adorable laughter and not be effected,” Steve retorted and Bucky threw back his head and laughed.
It had been over month since Pops was buried and in a couple weeks, Peter was going to turn seven-years-old and a week later he was to go back to school. Such things were bizarre. How could he go back to pretending everything was alright when it wasn’t? Pops was dead. He died to save Peter from Venom, the monster that had nearly killed him and forced him to feast on humans.
!” Someone announced and the rest of the car cheered in agreement. Steve muffled a chuckle as the truck moved out.
Steve’s fingers dug into his shoulders and Tony groaned in frustration, wanting his mate’s hands elsewhere. He dragged his hands down Steve chest and slipped them back behind him. He dug his fingers into Steve’s ass, pushing his hips toward his as Tony thrust up. Rubbing them together roughly and hard.
Tony was directing him to zodiac constellations now, drawing them with their combined point, not letting go of Steve, not that Steve wanted him to. He could stay out there all night if it meant lying beside Tony and simply holding his hand…
“I have no idea what you are referring to,” Tony replied airlessly, not wanting to admit it yet. He’d hurt Peter and Wade because of his stubbornness to disbelieve what was now so obvious. He wanted to apologize, truly apologize, and let them know his eyes are open. For now, he’d dance around it with Steve, but Wade and Peter deserved the admission from Tony first.
Steve expected to go home and sleep, with Tony snuggling into his side, instead they came home to anarchy.
But Steve knew he couldn’t do any of that right now without affecting the future. He had to wait for Tony’s sake. It was going to be the hardest thing Steve had ever done but he’d do it for Tony.
Tony eventually was able to maneuver the super soldier into the sand and climbed atop Steve. He whispered into his ear, “I prepared myself before we left.”
The man was covered head to toe in the white extinguisher foam and, with his beard and long hair, looked like a ghostly hippie.
“I’m sorry, babe,” Steve whispered, emotion clogging his voice now as he shared in Tony’s past torment.
For once in this century, he was trying to be inconspicuous. He didn’t want to draw the media, SHIELD, or Hydra’s attention. He wanted the day to go smoothly for Bucky and give the man the chance to remember and maybe even grieve for his long-lost friend.
Tony paused when he saw Steve. It was almost like a normal morning. Steve was cooking at the stove like always.
Every night, Steve never immediately put up the barrier. He always gave Tony a chance to give up. When he finally did, Steve expected a sulky Tony, refusing to talk to him would be the sign that their fight was over.
It was during this, he discovered his father had accidentally slid a few confidential files where they weren’t supposed to be and now Tony wanted more. Tony continued, “I know he left a lot with you guys, especially all the material on Project Rebirth…Most of it is still in the paper files and I am sad to say I can’t plead the fifth with any of it.”
He made his way to a bookcase and cracked open an old textbook and lazily perused through it. He even allowed himself to shortly geek out over the fact he now operated a private lab that was large enough to have a bookcase with reference texts.
Tony slowly fell back onto the bed, never breaking their mouths, and Steve settled himself on top of Tony, stapling his knees on either side of Tony’s hips.
Below him, he heard his uncle get on the phone. By the tone of his voice, he knew he was speaking to Aunt Tasha. His aunt was busy calling together the rest of the Avengers together. They were all to go to the community floor to wait for his uncle and pops’ return…so Peter only had a small window to work with.
“How can two guys who call themselves ‘Chewie’ and ‘Solo’ be so hard to find?!” Tony finally cracked, slamming his fist into the desk in front of him.
Flushing slightly, Steve murmured, “I said some things to you that were uncalled for before…this.” Steve waved to his soul implant and continued, “You are not incompetent. You are a good man and I am sorry for insinuating any differently.”
Oh yeah, like most romantic comedies, they start off hating each other. Only difference now, this wasn’t a movie. The fact that they were soulmates wasn’t going to solve the disagreements they had with each other. To top it off, when Cap realized they were mates, he looked like Tony had just stabbed a red, white, and blue puppy in front of him with a quadruple bladed swastika.
He was overflowing with curiosity and he had to force himself to not blurt out any unwanted questions. Bucky didn’t want to talk about that and Tony was going to respect his wishes…even though he was practically dying of curiosity because of it!
“It’s how I feel,” Steve whispered, his words heavy with emotion. Steve lightly touched one of Tony’s forearms and Tony did not flinch back this time. Steve continued, “I love you, Tony Stark…”
It was hard and raw just like their emotions at that moment. And despite their relative safety, Steve understood Tony’s need for a fast release…the last time they tried to make love it had been disastrous.
…You referred to Hydra in the present tense…” Steve’s grip was tight on Tony but he barely noticed because he was too focused on what Steve was saying. Steve gulped and whispered, “Hydra still exists in this future?”
“—and he was so strong…so stro—.” The speech he had prepared slipped from his mind like leaves to the wind and he stared starkly at the people before him.
Wade squeezed him lightly across the waist and murmured, “Shhh. No, it’s okay, Peter. I knew this going into the relationship. And, seriously, I don’t mind stopping, especially if you’re the end result." He practically purred the last bit and tightened his arms around Peter's waist. He continued, "But I’m still going to do mercenary work. It's how I make a living and I can't change that. I am willing to downgrade myself to the B-list with no killing but I can make no promises about hurting people or the legalities of my business…”
Peter turned and saw Harry waiting for him at the exit door to the roof. Peter ran over to him and, as he slowed down, Harry asked, “Why are you here? Don’t you usually go to your Uncle Ben’s when the Avengers are fighting?”
Wade fell back into the door with a groan and clutched his head. He fucked up again! How did he keep doing this?!
Steve did not seem excited by the photos. In fact, as soon as Tony mentioned them his expression went blank and his hold on Tony lax. Steve’s smile slowly slid off his face and Tony’s grin mirrored the action and disappeared.
As he kissed him, Steve whispered, “It’s nothing…Forget it…We’re friends with benefits, nothing more…Forget it, Tony…Forget it…”
Tony did not acknowledge Steve's statement but his heart did feel a little lighter knowing Peter was not fighting on the streets anymore.
“Let’s focus on two words in that statement,” Tony growled. “One: fractures, as in the hundreds of fractures that are lining nearly every inch of your femur, tibia, fibula, and the majority of your ribs! Two: growing, as in your skin, as in the left side of your head is pretty much devoid of it. And you want to leave this safe, sanitized space to do what exactly?”
Tony’s stomach dropped. Sensitive information? What was wrong with Steve? He was going to die, wasn’t he? Tony killed him. He killed Steve. He was going to be sick.
“Hey, Cap.” Tony walked up to him, wiping his wet hair out of his face. He was soaking wet and his face was flushed from doing a number a cannonballs into the water. He wore bright red swim trunks that were so small and tight they might as well have been speedos. Steve tried to look anywhere but the swim trunks as his friend took up position beside him.
A giant black plane suddenly appeared over them and Steve watch in stunned disbelief as it deftly turned and began to land straight down like a helicopter. Tony even paused in dressing to watch it and he gasped, “Please say I built that.”
Steve laughed and Tony watched him with a warm expression. Once he stopped laughing, Tony asked, “So I take it tonight is a go?”
Tony’s problem now was what he was going to gift his son. Like Steve, Peter did not like expensive or flashy things, which made them both the hardest people to shop for.
He looked down at her with those same wide eyes, but, as his gaze focused on her, his eyes returned to normal. He stuttered a reply, “Down the hall. There’s a cold room there. They put me in there before putting me on the machine. It weakened me and it's probably doing the same to him.”
He was on a huge barge made to ship shipping-containers. He hung between one of the many cranes that moved those metal containers, stories over the deck of the barge. The room he and Pepper were held in was twice the size of one of those containers and hovered over two hundred feet above the barge.
He closed his eyes and he irrevocably lost himself in the memory of Bucky holding and kissing him. The act had erased Steve’s mind once. Maybe it could happen again…
“Bucky?” Steve asked sleepily, pushing himself up. Tony slid off Steve’s chest and to his lap. He grumbled sleepily, wrapped his arms around Steve’s waist, and buried his face into the flesh of his abdomen. Steve glanced at the clock on his bedside table, it was a little past three in the morning.
“Hey, Steve!” Tony cheerfully replied, trying to defuse the situation. Pepper would be having an aneurism by now. Probably because the welder was supposed to not be hanging off his person by its handhold as it was not designed for such purposes, but, hey, Tony was innovative. Steve, hopefully, didn’t know the full extent of its injury capabilities…
“Look at me! Look at you!” Tony retorted, “What are you doing to that machine?! It is my only ticket home and you’re picking it apart!”
“Holy shit,” Clint cursed and his gaze repeatedly shot from Peter to Steve as he took in their familiar characteristics.
“Your father made this especially for you, Peter,” the dark haired woman continued. She carefully removed the cap to the cylinder and whispered, “He wanted you to reach your full potential…”
“Alright, I ain't blind. What's going on between you two right now?” Bucky asked, putting down his cards.
Natasha wordlessly launched herself forward again, this time going in for a straightforward assault. Peter used his Spidey-Sense this time and stepped aside to dodge her. His sense flared when, a baton came out of nowhere when she was closest to him. She must have had a few strapped to her back to take him by surprise.
Tony picked up his head and cupped Steve’s cheek. Steve dipped his head and kissed his husband. Tony’s hands tightened on him, as if to preserve the moment for as long as possible.
With the passing of midnight and the official start of a new day, Steve’s prior hopes of finding a way to separate Peter from Venom were beginning to dwindle. What if there was no cure? What if Peter, his beautiful baby boy, was really gone?
“Fuck,” Tony hissed under his breath. His heartbeat started to pick up and he could feel a panic attack on the verge of starting.
Steve grasped his wrist sharply and hissed, “I do need you, Bucky! ‘Till the end of the line,’ remember? I want you in my life. I want you in my son’s life. You are my best friend.
. Has he already hurt himself to get this solution? And I want all his lab reports… and I want to know every move he makes, and—.”
Holy shit, Natasha was going to be babysitting them fulltime, right? She must be some kind of witch because she made Bucky smile less than a minute into meeting him. What the hell??
Steve’s face was bright red and his embarrassment was clearly on display. He stared at the coffee table between them, refusing to look at any of his friends’ expressions.
,” Steve threw back his head, bunched his eyes closed, and groaned heatedly as Tony’s mouth wrapped around his cock. He bucked his hips deeper into Tony’s mouth and Tony moaned, the sound vibrating in his mouth and along his cock.
At the end of it, she was quiet for several moments until she finally whispered, “You’re so much more stronger than I thought you were…to bear this for all these years, to not tell anyone, and to still love him…”
He thought Steve was here as the next in rotation to sit with Tony to keep an eye on him in his sickness. Steve lightly shook his head and murmured, “I need to speak with Tony,
Later, they lay together on the couch in his workshop. Tony was snoring lightly and Steve was running his hand through Tony’s thick hair. The smile he greeted Tony with was gone. His thoughts turned dark with Tony’s safe arrival.
Venom took that moment to jump out at Wade with a screeching fury. It stayed connected to Peter by just one wrist and jerked him forward in its attack, wrenching Peter’s shoulder even more.
Steve pouted and Tony forced a frown, when he clearly wanted to pout too. Yet as Tony looked at him he suddenly smirk and said, “I’m making you dirty too.” He licked a thumb and rubbed something off the side of Steve’s mouth. Steve looked down at himself and saw Tony left behind a trail of dirty grime wherever he touched him.
Peter finally returned to his parents’ apartment and a strange cluster of emotions began to grow within him. On the one hand, he was excited to see Wade and introduce him as his boyfriend to his parents…on the other, he was wary how Wade and his parents would get along, Tony and Wade especially.
“Great,” Tony moaned sarcastically. Did they have Tylenol in the 40s? Because, if so, he was going to need like 50 capsules…
“Jeez, I have to come in after that?” Clint grumbled as Thor stepped back. He knelt in from on Peter and said, “Happy birthday, little man. Uh, let’s say I inserted an inspiring quote here, remember I am your coolest Uncle, and have an awesome birthday!” Clint rubbed Peter’s head, making his hair stand on end and making Peter laugh.
Steve slipped out of the car and Tony bound toward him. They did not pause to think. One moment their eyes were just meeting and the next their arms were around each other and their mouths were connecting like magnets.
They went back into the motions of boxing. Whereas Natasha demonstrated to Peter how to move and explained what they were doing, Steve wordlessly showed Tony by attacking him until he got it right. Tony stubbornly stuck to it, something Steve admired and he focused all his attention into showing Tony how to properly box because of it until he heard Bucky.
In the back of him mind, Tony’s words reverberated the rest of the night. The lab could easily be repaired but loosing either Peter or Tony would have destroyed Steve. Both of them unknowingly possessed a piece of his very soul.
,” Wade gasped into his mouth as he let Peter’s legs pull him in. Feeling all of Wade laid out above him made his heart race with excitement and uncertainty and adrenaline and…just
Steve tore himself from Thor’s hold and snatched Peter from Tony’s grasp. He held his son tightly to his chest. Peter was shaking but silent. He could feel their tension and anger in the air.
Bruce silently cleaned up after himself and then cleaned up the small puddle of morphine on the floor. By the time he was done, Tony was sleeping. Peter was still awake and was staring at Tony with an unreadable expression.
It felt weird flirting back in front of an audience, but Tony had already done it so he replied, “Not as nice as hazel.”
Tony looked at Wade and no longer saw the mercenary that had been trying to corrupt his son. Instead, he saw a man, a man standing on the edge of a precipice just as Tony had been. He saw a reflection of himself in Wade.
“Ignore it solider,” his master commanded. “We gave you a fake implant to better disguise you. A zeroed out implant stands out too much.”
His heart had weathered the pain from those consequences more than once now and he felt like he was ready for the next time.
“You, my soulmate, have really cute bed hair,” Tony murmured and then started kissing Steve down his neck.
Peter dropped his gaze and he circled the top of his coffee with the tips of his fingers again. He would like his autonomy from SHIELD but he did not believe it was possible. He asked, “How can I be sure you are telling me the truth right now? For all I know, SHIELD knows but isn’t saying anything to me until I’m backed into a corner.”
But her mate ignored the weapons in favor of drawing back the sleeve on his right arm, fully exposing his implant to her.
Metal shutters started covering the windows all around the mansion, blocking out the last rays of sun. The interior lights automatically turned on to compensate.
Bucky tightly grabbed his arm and pulled him to a violent stop. Bucky hissed, “One of the first things Tony warned us about was saying anything to his dad! I wasn’t raised by him like Tony and even I know that man would abuse the knowledge he’d gain from the future!”
His fingers traced her jawline and then cupped her cheek. She leaned into his hold and placed her hand over his.
Steve clutched Tony’s head with one hand and bit deeply into the other hand to muffle his moans because...Jesus...his mouth... He'd been blown before but all of those instances had been nothing -
They did not hear anything lockdown like one would hear with a car when its locks were engaged with a loud click but Steve trusted that the room was secure and no one would be disturbing them.
“Peter is one of the sweetest boys I have ever met. He loves to make May laugh and he’s always asking me questions, he’s inquisitive, like you.”
And then he finally cried for his mom…and dad, whose deaths were so much worse than he imagined. At that point his eyes were raw and his throat hoarse so he moaned and whimpered more than wept.
“Do you just add water?” Tony guessed. The Captain looked at him like he was a crazy person so Tony must have guessed wrong...
Tony turned off the water and opened the shower door, releasing some of the white fog that had gathered inside. Tony pulled a white towel off the wall then left it on his shoulders, ignoring his wet body and half hard cock.
Steve carded his fingers through Tony’s hand and looked at him with this warm, gooey smile that made Tony feel like he was melting under the sunny rays of his gaze. It was full of love and joy and so much excitement. Tony stared at his husband’s face and couldn’t help but remember all the impossible years they’d been together and how much light Steve brought into Tony’s life. Tony hadn’t known the true meaning of joy and content…until that day he met this legendary super solider and was ordered not to flirt with him. Out of all the rules and orders to break, that one changed the entire course of his life and he was so glad he did it. If he hadn’t flirted with Steve, not only would he have not had Steve but, he’d also probably still be drinking and still avoiding the fact that he had a son. Steve was the very precursor to Tony’s life story.
Silence blanketed the table and Steve tensed, waiting for Natasha’s explosive anger. Steve stared tensely at her but her face was blank, revealing nothing. She stared at the flowers and her lips thinned.
Without any warning, bullets shattered the windows to the caretaker’s shed and Steve dove to the ground. He covered himself the best he could with his shield and waited for an end to the onslaught.
Steve rubbed his hips into Tony’s and gradually drew his hands down Tony’s chest and under his shirt. They went back to kissing but Steve gasped between the breaths they took between each kiss, “We…are…g-going…to…be…late.”
He took a step toward them and wobbled as his body tried to work through whatever damage Venom had wrought. He gasped to his husband, “He’s right there, Steve.”
Steve did a quick interview with a news crew and then Sam guided him through the hospital. No news crews were there as Steve comforted patients and exchanged words with worried or grieving families.
“Sounds nice,” Steve chuckled, pulling up on the bottom of Tony shirt. Tony lifted his arms to let the super soldier pull it off and the blanket fell from his shoulders.  The light from his reactor grew brighter, bathing Steve in blue.
Steve sat down with a heavy sigh and Tony stated, “You two are ridiculous and it is the best thing to watch.”
“Captain Rogers?” One of the secret service agents approached him and Steve directed his attention to him. The man handed him a few papers and said, “Here is the President’s itinerary. You will be shadowing him the rest of the day.”
The truck caring their food supply had fresh bullet holes marring its side. Soldiers were unloading the supplies and checking for damage. They came to attention when Steve ran up to them.
As Colonel Phillips went over the days deployment plans in the command tent, Peggy looked like she was dying to speak to him privately but Steve purposely stood near the front of the gathered group so she wouldn’t be able to get a quiet word with him so easily. He could even feel Bucky’s eyes burning two parallel holes into the back of his head but he did not acknowledge his best friend’s stare either.
He could hear people follow him into the tunnel but, as Steve took more turns, their voices became more distant until he lost them altogether. After a few minutes of just hearing his own heavy breathing and the splash of his feet, he finally slowed to an unhurried walk and gasped for air as he clutched at his heart.
With a frown, Tony scolded, “I don’t care if you’re able to fight. I want to know if you feel sick or are hurting because then I’ll find a way to make it go away!”
Tony sighed heavily and answered, “We were not allowed to see her because we are not ‘family’ so, before you pulled your little stunt, we called your Uncle Ben and he agreed to stop by Oscorp tomorrow. If it’s really her, he’s going to try to set up a meeting with me and Pops.”
If that were the case, then Peter was already dead and the man he'd been with was merely an alien clone.
“Both options are tempting…” Tony murmured. His fantasies as a child had obviously not involved the Iron Man suit but it was also his most valuable asset.
In less than a minute, Bruce found the solution, cleaned both Tony’s arm and the needle with an alcohol swab, and had the drug pumping back into him. As the morphine did its work, Tony’s face relaxed and he released another pent up sigh.
He ran his fingers through Steve’s hair and Steve wound his arms around Tony and pressed his forehead to his.
The AI had originally asked Tony to verbally give approval but all he was able to do was grunt. It was a struggle to breathe nonetheless talk. The moving shrapnel in his chest were making his muscles twitch and contract wildly so he was only able to make the shallowest of gasps as he tried to breathe.
Would Sam Wilson be waiting for Steve? Could he be waiting here already?….Was he with Steve when it happened?
And then he wept for Bucky…he cried for his friend because Hydra had broken him just as they had done to Steve in the alternative future. They erased the man he once was with years of torture…according to the files on the Winter Soldier, it took them twenty years –
Norman had changed in the year since Steve had last seen him. The man used to look strong, handsome, and had been oozing with arrogance. Whatever sickness that had taken hold of him had done a number on him. Norman had aged, he was pale, and his once salon perfect hair was in a disarray. Steve would have thought him weak too until he met his eyes. The strength of his gaze revealed his unflinching determination that was the core of Oscorp’s business power. Norman may have been sick in body but he was no way weakened in his mind.
Steve nodded stiffly and stepped back to let the medical personnel do their jobs. It took all of Steve’s willpower not to muscle his way back in and hold onto Tony.
Steve pressed his face into Tony’s shoulder to escape his gaze. His heart was overfilling with so much love that his lips trembled with the sentiment. He knew if he kept staring at Tony’s devout gaze, he’d confess again. At that moment, when he was on the edge of orgasm, he wanted to tell Tony he loved him so much. He wanted to whisper it to him constantly…
Everyone got back to their feet feeling elated. The fight was won and the bad guys were strewn across the field, defeated. As soon as they were both standing again, Steve embraced Tony, holding him tightly to help his heart slow down.
“…I know many people have told you that it is not your fault –.” Bruce paused wondering how to phrase this and murmured, “But that isn’t the truth is it?”
He heard his aunt bound up the stairs and then she entered his room without pausing to knock. Her face was stark white and her big blue eyes focused on him and she repeated in a whisper, “Peter…”
Tony ran his thumb over his lips to clean up and teased, "Such a dirty mouth...Now, are you going to get out of that bath or am I going to have to blow you again?"
Steve was tempted to blurt out that Tony made an amazing father but bit back the words. He and Tony never discussed Tony’s role with Peter. They started dating when Peter was two-years-old so Peter and Tony were always constants in each other’s lives. Their dating was so natural that they did not even have to explain that they were dating to Peter or what it meant to be gay. To Peter, it was normal and Tony was just of a father to him as Steve was. Tony doted on Peter but Steve was scared to bring up parenthood with Tony. They’d been dating for over a year but they were only boyfriends. They were not married. Tony did not really have any responsibility to Peter and he did not want to unnecessarily impose it on him.
Peter had to make sure and read several more articles. Most of them were about the Parker takeover of Stark Industries’ biological department and the others were gossip rags about the fight between Richard Parker and Tony Stark. Those articles came with pictures of both men from far away. Tony Stark had a black eye and Peter’s father had a cut lip.
“How about you, me, and Uncle Tony go to the park?” They did not need to wait for the weekend to go with Ben and May.
Once inside, he tapped his foot impatiently as he waited for the elevator to crawl up the shaft and mentally added to his To-Do List giving additional speed to the elevators.
Pepper snatched back the paper and put her hand over the mouthpiece on her phone. She put the paper on the desk and stated, “Friday, scan the names and send out the electronic invitations.”
He and Bucky had started off with bullies in alleyways but, with the war, Steve knew he was destined to fight. Anyone with a zeroed out implant were encouraged to fight…but Steve kept getting denied for his ailments.
Nor how his heart would react to such an amazing man who actually cared for Tony as a person and not the name or reputation or money he had.
“What kind of host would I be if I didn’t treat?” Tony admonished. He motioned to the stack of boxes, sitting by the delivery boy’s feet, and said, “But you can help out. I think you can handle the heavy lifting.”
Steve watched him go with a pinched brow. He was fascinated by his ability to fly but was also perturbed by his interaction with him. The man had an easygoing attitude that was borderline mad with a dash of haughtiness. Steve wasn’t so sure how he felt about Howard’s son.
Cameras and individual lenses and other accessories lined the walls and counters but Peter bypassed it all. He went up to the counter the man stood behind and said, “I need some parts for my camera.”
She’d probably wear the same expression when he eventually got the shield and conveniently forgot to tell her. She’d walk in on him scanning it or, afterwards, and spot it hanging on the wall and ask him about it. He chuckled to himself as he imagined the resulting lecture she’d give him. But first he had to get that shield…
Steve became sufficiently distracted by their impending date and, as he was put in charge of their dinner, he grilled Tony on what he felt like eating. Tony teased him by being indecisive but internally he was radiating relief. He hated seeing Steve so upset and even if this date relieved only a tenth of the pressure Steve was under, Tony was glad to have thought it up.
“At the Tower,” Bruce explained. “Me, Clint, and Tony mostly but the others stop in from time to time. Thor treats it like a vacation home. Natasha treats it like a free hotel but she has been stopping by more frequently…We all were hoping you’d rethink Tony’s offer and join us. It would be nice to have the team together and everyone will
“And this is my colleague, Tony Stark,” Steve said, motioning to Twitchy. Twitchy removed his baseball cap but left his glasses on, nonetheless, Peter now recognized him as the infamous Tony Stark, billionaire, inventor, and Avenger. Peter’s jaw dropped upon the second reveal. Tony Stark was just as famous as Steve Rogers. Not only was he a genius, famed for one-of-a-kind inventions, but he was also the first superhero to disclose his identity to the world. He was one of the reasons Peter felt brave enough to make a costume and go out superheroing himself.
They still needed to talk about it, however, because, otherwise, it would fester between them and worsen their relationship overtime. And Steve did not want to make what they had between them any worse than it already was…in fact, he was hoping there was a way for them to salvage the tentative bond they shared.
As the doors closed behind him, he turned back around and faced Tony. Tony stood by the table and was grinning smugly at Steve. The last thing he saw was Tony blowing him a kiss.
“How did you get down here?” Peter hissed. There were numerous security checkpoints and Wade had no clearance to get past any of them.
Peter cried out when Wade was hurt again. But, despite the multiple impalements, Wade did not let go of him and gurgled, “P-Pe-t-terrr.”
Peter fell back into the bed, groaning, “It feels like I was up all night! Even my muscles are sore!”
Steve pushed the screen toward him when he caught sight of himself on it and playfully asked, “What is that?”
“So…” Tony dragged out the word. He cleared his throat again and Steve’s eyebrow rose in question. Yeah, Tony was acting weird. He quickly continued, “I was thinking…” He kept one of his hands in Steve’s and then knelt down and reached under the worktable. He pulled out the box with the ring in it, it was a plain metal box he made after he made the ring. It did not look like the usual velvet ring box so Steve looked at it questionably. He was still kneeling as he held up the box and said, “For our 5 year, 3-month anniversary, I wanted…I was wondering, if you wanted to tie the knot?”
“Eh, if you say so. I remember just flashes of what happened and I’m pretty sure I was the world’s bossiest bottom.”
“Oh, good point.” Tony sat up in bed and pulled his shirt up over his head. “But I could just blow you now. I don’t have to finish getting naked for that. But you do.” He waggled his eyebrows.
Loki waved a hand dismissively. “That pales in comparison to what might have been done. Do you know how powerful some of these potions are? I’ve made potions that could disintegrate a bilgesnipe on contact.”
Tony spent almost an hour pointing out every interaction where he had mentioned even in an offhand way that Steve was hot or had made a joking reference to the two of them hooking up. He had even brought up all the times Natasha had teased them for fighting like an old married couple. Steve understood Tony really wanted to make it clear that he had had feelings all along, but this was overkill. And no amount of gentle persuasion could get Tony to change the subject. Even though it had been important to make sure Tony wasn’t under a love spell, Steve almost regretted bringing it up.
He had a point. Steve had tried playing chess with both Clint and Bucky and it had been a disaster each time. The two of them could sit in a sniper’s nest for hours, but they didn’t have the patience to sit through a single chess game.
It didn’t take long for him to feel close to the edge. Tony was damn good, knew just how to take Steve apart and he quickly felt himself spiraling out of control.
Steve had never seen Tony move so fast. One second he was in front of the bookshelf, and the next, he was sprawled across Steve’s bed.
“And you’re not?” Loki deftly moved his knight, capturing Steve’s rook. “Strategy is your forte, is it not, Captain? And I’m sure you would rather me than he rest of your merry band of idiots.”
“Hey, I think my dick’s getting back into things,” Tony said with delight. He was already sporting a semi.
“Slow isn’t in my vocabulary,” Tony muttered. He braced his hands on either side of Steve’s thighs and carefully lowered himself down.
After all the whining Tony had done, Steve had assumed Tony would pretty much jump him as soon as they made it into Steve’s bedroom. But once Steve pushed open the door, Tony immediately rushed over to the single bookcase in the corner and started lamenting about Steve’s lack of
Steve came with a punched out groan. There was a warm, wet feeling against his leg and he supposed Tony must have come too, just from sucking him off.
Steve sighed. “No, Tony. I’m just trying to figure out what this all means. If we put stock in your theory, we’re soulmates so we were always meant to fall in love anyway and there were already feelings between us.”
Tony focused on his task, his dark eyes intense as they watched Steve’s every reaction. Tony had don e this before, had done this with lots of people, probably. He knew what he was doing. But he was paying attention to make sure it would be exactly right for Steve. Every lick, every swallow, every bit of pressure was calculated specifically to make Steve feel good. It was an incredible turn-on. But as Steve’s gaze drifted lower, he realized Tony had a hand wrapped around his own erection and he was jerking it in time with his sucks.
Tony was practically vibrating with excitement as they piled into the elevator. “Next stop, pound town.”
“You think I’m going to be traumatized when this is all over? Oh please. It takes a lot more than sex to traumatize me. So what if I’m a little more impulsive than usual? This thing isn’t going to suddenly give me an interest in anal if I hated it before. Which, by the way, definitely don’t hate. Nothing better than a good, deep dicking. Not that dicks are end all, be all. I’m pansexual as fuck and Pepper and I always had a good time when we were together.”
Marcel sighed heavily and turned toward both of them as he slid his bag onto his shoulder. He explained, “I know and I am sorry for not noticing it sooner. I have been kicking myself since we discovered it. Last night, I had one of my boys looking into the dress, to see if there was some twisted symbolism Tyler could have used. I thought the blue rose might have stood for something that could have backed up her insanity…yet, in the end it made us realize she could not possibly have worn the dress in the Tower.”
Growing up, he’d seen some bad rashes on Steve, but Tony’s sickness was painful just to look at. Bucky quickly wrapped him up and helped him back into his shirt. All of Tony’s movements were stiff but he moved faster as he began to move around.
Jarvis stated over the loudspeakers in the tower, “The Jarvis uplink at the Malibu house has been disconnected, Master Rogers. I cannot tell you how much longer the structure will hold but I am still connected to the Mark 42. The armor is heavily damaged but Sir currently has only minor injuries so far. However, his blood pressure is at a dangerously high level as is his respiratory rate.”
“Ugh,” Tony groaned, turning in the cot to face away from the absolutely ridiculous, younger version of his father.
“Typically a superhero prevents danger and does not invite danger to his front door,” Steve retorted smartly.
“It’s just a photo! There’s no demand! What do they want?? And where are my kids??? What do I say??”
Despite the layers of clothing between them, he felt both of their pulses pick up. Both of them noticed at the same time and tensed but Steve did not relinquish his hold on the smaller man.
Tony lost his virginity almost two weeks later. After that, Tony was convinced he was in love with this girl and talked to Steve about the future he wanted with her.
His shirt fell back into place and Steve cleared his throat. Bucky turned to him, his emotionless mask in place. Steve held out the paper without meeting his eyes and whispered, “Please keep this, Bucky…. Please.”
“Or maybe I’m just taking pity on you,” Peter teased. His phone buzzed and he looked down at it. It was a single message from his dad, stating, “Showtime: main hall – 10 minutes.”
The prosecution was staring at Marcel with absolute astonishment and Steve had to do all within his power not to launch himself at the man. Steve grinned ecstatically at Marcel as he walked back to their table.
Steve was made more uneasy by Tony’s silence. To break it, he asked, “Has this ever happened before?”
His eyes met Steve’s as he returned to the table and he reassessed that prior thought…this era wasn’t completely limited.
“It would never hold up in court,” Tony cut him off apologetically. “Alien evidence would never be accepted, no matter their weight in proof…”
Nearly every night, Tony convulsed and screams strangled his throat, made silent by his clenched jaw. His body would be drenched in sweat and, if he happened to be holding Steve when he fell asleep, his hands would claw into Steve’s flesh. His nightmares never seemed to wake him and dragged out until Steve woke him. Tony tried to brush it off at first and deny it was happening. Yet when Steve realized it was a common occurrence he demanded answers.
Sam blinked a few times then stepped back and said, “Yeah, yeah, come in!” As soon as all of them were in, Sam looked around outside and then closed the door.
Peter’s eyes broke away first and he stared at the ground. He wanted to get to know Tony. He wanted to know who this man was. Yet, actually meeting with him was so surreal that Peter was afraid to approach him. Tony Stark had been his idol, a charismatic genius and amazing superhero. Never in his wildest dreams did Peter think he would meet him or any of the other Avengers. Nevertheless, Tony Stark was his father and Peter had yet to come to terms with that factor.
“He was an ass,” Eddie elaborated. “I don’t think anyone else would do it, even with the seminar we did yesterday. The rest of them are cool.”
Freezing wind hit him and the cold sunk deeper into his skin, making him nauseous. Yet he stepped out into it and wrapped his arms around himself to better ward off the cold.
Tony nodded to both of them one last time and hustled out of the apartment as quickly as he could without looking at either of them.
The van door opened and Peter had returned with the clothes. He too was back in his civilian clothes and even wore some glasses. He seemed unfazed by their intimate cuddling. He handed over the clothes and said, “I got Pops’ old jeans, but the rest is ‘future wear’ and has been inspected by Fury and deemed okay to wear. He words exactly being ‘So I won’t have to see a naked Stark running around’.”
“Thank you for coming out here and waiting, Happy,” Steve said graciously. He would be sure to thank Tony later too.
Steve affectionately rubbed Peter’s head as he straightened then went over to the kitchen to prepare him and Tony some food. When Steve went to greet his son, Tony went straight to the coffee pot and was already inhaling the liquid from a mug.
Her teammates nodded, even Clint, but his son whined upon Natasha’s suggestion and Clint immediately rubbed comfortingly at his shoulder. He whispered to his son, “I’ll be okay. I’ve got to go save Cap and Iron Man. They’re useless without me. And Mommy has her gun and if anyone comes near she’s going to show them how well a two-time gold winning sharp shooter can handle a 40 caliber.”
Eventually, Pepper stood and murmured, “I’m going to make some coffee and then we’ll do whatever it is you’re up for, okay?”
Coulson wouldn’t have considered it a year ago but…since he met Thor, it seemed like anything was possible. He shook his head at the silly thought. Cap had the serum running through his veins. It had amazing healing factors and maybe, just maybe it was what saved him.
A couple photos were sitting upright on the dresser. He made a beeline to them before he could start second guessing himself again. The largest picture was of the Avengers. It was of their final meeting, before Thor departed, all of them were in high spirits and smiling widely. It had been taken a week after Tony and Steve’s affair began and Steve and Tony had their arms wrapped around each other’s waists and were leaning into each other in the middle of the group.
Finally, she gave in one morning over breakfast. The usual silence was too maddening and she broke it by mumbling, “Natasha.”
It hurt but, God, it felt so amazing that he barely paid attention to the pain. Once he was fully sheathed, Tony stopped moving to let Steve adjust to his presence.
“Oh Lord,” Steve gasped and buried his face in his hands to muffle his blush. Maybe taking Tony up on a date was not such a good idea.
The Winter Soldier dropped his gun and held out his hand. A grenade launcher that was placed in his grasp and Steve gasped, “Tony!”
Howard woke suddenly at the hoarse voice but groaned when the muscles in his neck strained. He’d fallen asleep in the chair next to Tony’s bed and it was his son’s voice that woke him.
He nodded but seemed diminished, like being near the chair had hurt him. She pulled him to the only other door and he picked up his step once he was far enough away.
Maybe this was a summer home? Or maybe this Peter had created Friday? Tony liked the idea of that, his son making an AI just like he had.
“Stark lives and, as always, he is complicating our lives,” Coulson sighed heavily as he pulled the tablet back towards himself.
Tony knew this already, but it still excited him to hear Steve say it. He tucked his head against Steve’s shoulder and replied, “This is your hourly reminder that I love you, beloved.”
Like most of his generation, Steve hated using his fingertip so Tony got him a stylus pen for the touchscreen. Tony teased him about it relentlessly but Steve would not forgo it. Tony could not help but smile whenever he saw Steve tapping away on his tablet with the stylus.
It was Tony's turn to turn bright red. He had, had a reputation for being playboy but he'd never been confessed to in such an
Tony smiled warmly but then sarcastically said, “After all of my wooing, it’s the lube that does it?”
Bucky was halfway up the stairs when they stepped out. Natasha was close behind him and both had their guns drawn. They froze when they stepped out. Bucky’s eyes nearly bugged out of his skull and he gasped, “Jesus Christ, what happened to your face? And what were those explosions??”
When he finally sorted his mind, his entire body was instantly consumed with adrenaline filled foreboding. What happened?? The last things he remembered were seeing Peter and hearing Steve’s voice call out to him. What had the Goblin done??
Steve was originally going to bring it up with Tony but when Tony excused himself to grab Peter’s new toy in his workshop he had called Steve “Captain Handsome.” Now Steve could not think of Tony without remembering the pet name and he automatically blushed furiously.
Peter humphed and stared beadily at what was left of his strawberry ice cream. Looking at the toddler, Steve knew if Tony offered, it would be impossible to deny his boy another.
“Sir, the tower is under attack,” Jarvis informed them as the tower shook with another rumble. “It is being done by a group of super humans…From the few I have been able to scan, it seems these are what remains of the detainees who escaped SHIELD last year.”
Regrettably, they had to breathe and end it. They broke with exaggerated moans and happy chuckled and then just stared into each other’s eyes, living in the love of the other’s gaze.
His heart squeezed painfully. He knew the adults had a rational argument but it did not matter to Peter. Pops had never betrayed Peter like that before…it hurt. It felt like Pops was taking something from him almost out of spite.
The Hydra scientists introduced painfully shocks to their specimen whenever he cried and he quickly learned to shut up. Norman wished he could have done the same to his own son and reclaimed more sleep.
“Small caliber bullet. It breaks the spine but doesn’t kill. I found that out when I tried to kill your friend,” the Red Skull stated.
How was he supposed to help the ones he loved if he was crippled as he was with these anxieties and even more so with the reactor in his chest?
Steve chuckled and sat up with Tony to help search the sheets of the expansive bed. “Help” being the operative word. The man leaned into Tony’s side the entire time and spent most of it stealing kisses.
Steve crawled away from the flap, tearing off his bomber jacket, and gasped, “So very stupid.” Steve jumped on top of Tony and cupped his head to bring their mouths together in a hot, needy kiss. Tony ripped off Steve’s shirt, popping off a few buttons. Steve trailed his kisses down Tony’s neck and Tony bit down on his lip to smother his groan. The noise vibrated in his throat and Steve nibbled down on his larynx and hushed, “Shhhh, we need to be quiet.”
The doctor smirk and said, “I don’t know my boss’s number either. Cell phones, you know? How about you call your family and they can call your ranking officer?”
