He was free and soon Zola wouldn’t be.
Tomorrow would be there before he knew it and he had to face a new reality with Steve. It was going to be near impossible to remain just-friends now. His body figuratively felt a pull toward Steve whenever they were in the same area.
“Of course, Peter!” Steve replied, ignoring Tony’s theatrics.
One evening, he receives a message from Shuri. She informs him that something came up in Wakanda, and she couldn’t work on “Operation Bucky”, but now she’s back on track.
run straight into Stark’s arms?”
The situation is almost a comical parody ‒ like they are her parents she has just caught fighting.
Then, he catches Steve sneaking up on him. He looks startled, like a deer in a headlights, staring at Steve. “Uh huh, you know what, I got to go. Yeah, I’ll call you tomorrow. Bye!”
Sam drops his head in his hands. “Fuck,” he breathes.
He thinks of Pepper, the mourning brave widow in the future. Pepper fighting in the Rescue armor. And little Morgan, bright-eyed child who had always called him Uncle Steve. Little Morgan who'd have to grow up without her father, who had loved her more than anything.
“Baby steps,” Tony echoes.
Steve wastes no time – no, he's wasted that enough – and lifts Tony, carries him into Tony's bedroom with hurried steps. He's trying to remove Tony's shirt even before Tony hits the sheets.
The cottage is miserable and cold, far from homey, but it’ll do for now.
It feels like Sam and Wanda’s stares are boring holes into his skin.
”You don't have to lie to me, Rogers,” Tony says, his usually warm-toned voice cold as ice. When he turns back around to face Steve, his eyes look defeated and lightless.
Princess Shuri is waiting for him when he enters the ship base.
No, even though Captain America had ceased to exist the moment he had dropped the vibranium shield for Tony to pick up and hang on his wall, Steve Rogers is still a man of action.
There's no news of Bucky. Steve excepts none. Bucky will resurface when it's the time.
Now or never.
“You can go see him any time you want,” Tony points out.
They wind up in the common room, no Wanda or Lisa-Marie in sight. Actually, Steve thinks Lisa-Marie has gone home already.
“Bucky, I’ve had feelings for him for years,” Steve says. It actually feels good to admit that. The only time he had gone close to speaking those exact words out loud was when Natasha was trying set him up with basically everyone she knew.
It startles Steve who had been brushing his teeth. He grabs the phone from the pocket of his sweatpants, almost breaking it in his grip. First, he thinks it’s Sam, or Sharon, or Shuri, even though they
She tilts her head towards a tall woman standing further next to the a shiny modern ship.
”Motherf-,” says Fury.
“I’m glad,” Steve smiles.
“Hold on, the kid?”
“Oh,” Bucky says, “Well, that won’t do. Wanda, you can’t go outside! What if you get caught? And Shuri, no sixteen-year-old girl should be outside at this hour!”
, seeing those bright brown eyes flash in his mind, seeing the light in them disappear, makes Steve's heart clench painfully.
He thinks of the power Carol holds.
Wanda smiles softly, saying, “I assume you mean Tony, not Peter. He’s… Well, we don’t talk much. We weren’t that friendly to begin with. I think he’s afraid me, or at least of my powers. The vision is showed him… Anyway, I think he’s lonely. Did you know he broke up with his girlfriend? They’re still friends, but it’s awkward. Colonel Rhodes is all he has. And Vision ‒ but Vis is forced to stay in the facility so that no suspicions will rise. I would rather have him here, and he wishes so as well, and so does Tony, but…”
”Thank you, Jarvis. I'm just tired,” he replies.
Steve, knowing Tony's habits of spending hours in the workshop without eating, states, ”Tony, you have to eat. See you in the kitchen in a minute or two?”
”You're leaving,” he keeps repeating.
The thought tempted Steve, but he had made up his mind. Bucky would understand. Bucky would follow him, T’Challa would take care of that.
“No problem,” Sharon says with a genuine smile. She has helped Steve so much during everything that she has earned his trust. She knows well enough it was Steve who assisted the prison break, and she hasn’t asked about Scott or Clint or Wanda.
Go to the world without Tony Stark.
Then, Tony runs off to lick his wounds somewhere else. Probably the workshop. Steve leaves him be, knowing Tony wouldn't let him in either way. He retreats back to the couch, calls Natasha – no news – and then starts a drawing that quickly turns into a picture of Sam holding the Captain America shield.
Steve can't help but chuckle, stroking Tony's face.
“It is,” Lisa-Marie agrees, “Shall we get inside? It might start raining soon, and Ms. Maximoff is waiting.”
Steve thinks.
Steve huffs, “Let’s not drag Pepper into this. Besides, they’re not together anymore.”
”Everything’s fine.” Steve tries to smile. He thinks his facial muscles have forgotten how to smile but then, he can't help it. Slowly, they start to work.
One evening, Natasha arrives at the tower, unannounced. It's a quiet calm evening. Steve likes those evenings, the two of them retreated in the workshop, Tony's music playing in low volume so that they can still talk if they want to. Sometimes they don't, which is fine.
dangerous woman, but on the other hand she’s only a girl who has a hard time understanding her powers.
“Stark,” Clint elaborates with a grunt, “He came when we first had been locked up. I thought he was there to boast. Preach about his victory. But-“
Steve cries tears of relief, doesn't answer.
he copies Steve’s strained and longing tone of voice.
Steve nods against Tony's shoulder. The future has been changed. The next thing Steve has to do is prevent Ultron. They have yet to receive the mission to retrieve Loki's scepter.
“Don’t you dare touch me!” Tony hisses, “The last time you touched me, I got hurt!”
“Yeah, you know Black Panther? T’Challa? His country.”
“I think I could get us to the facility unseen,” Shuri points out.
call him, only text.
”Steve?” It's Natasha, standing unsure in the doorway, holding a bottle. Her hair sticks to the sheen of sweat on her face and neck.
“What? Do you think you can walk across the continent of Africa and then swim across the Atlantic Ocean? I doubt even Captain America could do that.”
As five seconds crawl past.
Cautious, she first points a gun at them when they arrive on her doorstep, but soon the tension in her shoulders eases and she agrees to help them.
Steve almost chokes on his burger. He knows he’s turned bright red.
”Alright,” Steve says, ”I'll be here. Waiting.”
Sam starts to splutter, but a strict glare from Wanda makes a stop to it.
“You don’t need to-“ T’Challa makes a shushing gesture towards Steve and then smiles, saying,
“Alive. He was. I don’t know how he’s doing now,” Sam knows.
”Tony,” Natasha says, sounding understanding for the first time. She smiles. Steve remembers the tears he shed for her.
”I love you so much,” Steve whispers against Tony's hairline, pulling him closer.
Tony’s voice cracks. Steve notices his hands are shaking, so he attempts to catch one.
Thanos is gone. He has Tony, his team, and Bucky, eventually.
Wanda is completely dumbfounded, her gaze going back and forth from Steve and Tony.
“He’s right,” Steve says. Wanda shifts her gaze at him. Her eyes say,
Steve – Steve doesn't even know what he's pleading for. A piece of Tony. Even a tiny one. He has already gotten more than he ever had before and it keeps him going.
”You better not be kidding. Or Pepper and Rhodey will have to deal with your kneecaps, and there's this kid, Harley, who'll gladly join, I'm sure.”
Steve knows he's being selfish. He knows Sam and another Bucky are waiting for him, five seconds away. He knows
he almost says, but that would only infuriate Tony further. Instead, he tries to convey it with his eyes.
He can’t help but to think what the situation resembles: like they’re two tired husbands trying get a few minutes alone at the end of the day. Asking the how are yous, talking about the kids… In a way, Steve and Tony are the parents ‒ then there’s the rogue daughter Wanda, the zealous son Peter who’s calls are a routine part of the day, and grumpy uncle Bucky, and Shuri who is Shuri.
Taking a moment, Steve answers, “No. He never was. We had a big ugly disagreement, that’s true, but I never hated him. And I hope he never hated me.”
”Rogers? Are you listening to me? Why have you gone all pale?” Fury asks, crossing his arms across his chest.
”I won't, sweetheart. I won't,” Steve replies, hugging him tighter, pressing his face into Tony's hair.
“And I don’t presume you will.” He offers an understanding smile. “Baby steps.”
Tony’s eyes soften. “Wanda, you’re a wanted criminal. If they catch you, you’re going back to the Raft, and maybe never getting out again.”
like Sam had mimicked.
”But you're here,” Tony continues quietly, looking at his hands. The tone of his voice sounds wondrous and Steve's heart skips a beat.
Natasha Romanoff is an observant person, so naturally, she sees something is off with Steve. Steve feels her pale eyes bore into him, analyzing him. Steve thanks whatever power there might be for his good memory, so he doesn't appear too suspicious to her.
After that, Steve goes home.
Steve trains and draws. He considers to leave to seek Bucky with Natasha and Sam, but he can't leave the tower.
Tony sighs, sipping his coffee. “Although I do regret bringing him into our fight. Well ‒ we were short of choices then. Should’ve tried to summon Thor or something… That guy sure loves to fight.”
“Yeah,” Steve says, thinking back to the days when he was just a small boy from Brooklyn. “I never saw this coming.”
Yes, Clint and Natasha were friends that had to momentarily turn against each other, but Steve was a man whose heart beat for Tony Stark.
“What are you going to do about it?” Shuri says, crossing her arms.
”Oh. You're back. Here to pick up your sketchbook?” Tony says, voice flat.
here?”
“No.” Wanda shakes her head. “I think T’Challa would come to aid. And there’s the new guy, Strange.”
“I just thought,” Shuri continues, “It’ll take me a few more weeks, at least.” She grimaces at her words, as if it was a disgrace it would take that long. Steve had nothing to complain. Shuri had worked and worked, and as much as Steve wanted to see Bucky up and about again, they weren’t in a hurry.
And now is the time for
“Why did you call me?” Steve has to ask, squeezing his shut. Suddenly, he feels asthmatic again, almost forgetting how to breathe. Tony doesn’t answer. The only sounds Steve can hear are his neighbors’ muffled shouts coming from upstairs.
Shuri is grinning wildly, eyeing Wanda as if she’s asking her
Steve deals with his doppelgänger.
They sit down, and Steve asks, “Where’s Natasha?”
That's what Steve thinks as he sits opposite to Tony, eating breakfast, listening to Tony telling anecdotes about him and Rhodey. Steve is blissfully happy, looking at Tony talking animatedly, so
When Steve had seen her during their little side-quest in the 70s, he had wondered. Peggy had been as beautiful as ever – ethereal, but Steve had only felt a feeble tickle of nostalgia when he had silently watched her. He wondered – what could have been, wondered if Peggy would've accepted that Steve had fallen for another in the end.
Captain America and the Hulk deal with a minor situation in Queens. Then, Bruce leaves. Thor arrives the day after, apologizing he wasn't there to help. Steve says it was nothing.
”Nat is going, but I'm staying here. With you,” Steve replies, desperate for Tony to know.
It all feels natural to Steve, to live and be with Tony. Them alone together in the tower, watching movies, cooking, Steve listening to the music Tony plays him. Steve talking to Tony about Bucky, Peggy, Sam. Sharing his life with him. Tony is a good listener, attentive, those gorgeous brown eyes always sharp and understanding.
Steve sighs, ”Are you snooping in my head, Wanda?”
Carol's eyes move from Steve to Tony. Then, she says, ”I have a family to visit. If you'll excuse me…”
“It’s new,” Sharon continues, “But I’m really happy with her. This could lead somewhere.”
”Sam has promised to look for him,” Steve says.
And Steve isn’t good at chess, anyway.
“Morning.”
“Me and Stark what?” Steve replies, willing away a blush.
Tony, Jarvis?” Steve asks softly. His heart pangs as he stands in the darkness, knowing Tony is just in his reach.
They kiss and kiss, until Tony lets out a yelp, taking a step back from Steve. Steve tries to following him, but Tony gestures towards the window, eyes wide.
It burns Steve’s heart and throat.
It’s silent again, until,
Tony doesn't react to the affectionate nickname that escapes from Steve's lips. He only shivers in Steve's embrace, clutching Steve's shirt.
”Cap- Steve?” Pepper says, genuinely surprised. ”Hi, what are you doing here?”
Steve doesn’t take Sharon’s advice. He’s scared, terrified, but not sure of what.
”Tony,” Steve whispers, his whole presence full to the brim with worry.
“He never comes here anymore, it should be empty,” Sam explains as they make their way through the forest, Wanda swatting bugs away with her red bursts of energy.
Both of them need a little time to heal.
did this happen?”
Tony whispers: so light it's just a gust of air passing through his lips. ”Why are you suddenly here, all sweet on me? What is up with you? What happened in D.C.?”
Bruce comes to stay for a couple of days. It's nice to have company. Steve can only imagine how lonely Tony had felt, completely alone in the tower.
”Tony, I don't know what you're talking about,” Steve says.
It’s the only answer Steve considers in his elated state of mind.
Tears well up in Steve's eyes. He can't tell Tony, he
“Tony, you know I can’t get drunk,” Steve says calmly.
- Aftermath of suicide
“Iron man I’m sending widow to help, give me your location” Captain America replied while signaling to Widow to move.
“Black widow here, fourth rat is neutralized, looks like everyone is okay, Widow out”
He was over the rat, when the rat jumped and twisted in midair. Biting down on the suit. Tony began to feel the suit start digging into him.
Because maybe Tony wasn’t even worthy of having his blood on Captain America’s hand.
. Something that could shine when Tony was lost. But now he was lost, and it wasn’t and would never be there anymore. And Tony couldn’t even seem to care. He knew what or more like who was lacking. And for all Tony Stark could do, it was something he could never get back.
And somehow the letter, only made it worse.
He didn’t know why the team was in his house (Tony was uncomfortable with having them in his home)
He really did hate having to take on a new shirt, but then again walking around soaking in coffee wasn’t all that enjoyable either.
Steve was smiling. Because Tony stayed, something he never did. So maybe this meant that the movie-night proposal had worked.
“I suppose it would be rude to say no”
Tony quickly took survey of his surroundings. Noticing the jet was close he moved to engage.
bleeding. Jarvis had tried to warn him, like the good little caretaker he is, but Tony had muted him. Because Tony needed to stay. Even though it hurt, and he would much rather lay down on his sofa in the workshop and sleep.
Steve was on his way to team breakfast. It wasn’t a new thing, but this time it was with a different team. Sam provided the meal since he was the only one of them that could cook a decent meal. And well, their former cook wasn’t here. Steve was still angry at Tony for going against him. Tony had listened to him talk countless times about how he missed his old life back in the forties. How broken he felt every time he found something that Bucky would have liked, only to remember a second later that Bucky had died in a time long gone by for everyone else. Tony could always find just the right things to say to him that somehow always made him feel a bit better.
Steve still tried to keep up with the news even though they fugitives.
was nothing.
higher than his own boyfriend, then what did that say about the state of Tony Stark’s conscience?
“We are so sorry to say this but Tony Stark has been found dead, the evidence points to a suicide by gun.” Everheart said with a genuine sad smile “Miss Potts, Mr. Stark’s good friend and CEO of Stark Industries, have said that a small funeral will be held at Friday, but people are welcomed to show up after to show their condolences. Miss Potts will also like to inform any members of the former Avengers team that sided with the fugitive Captain America will not be welcome, and if they choose to come then they will be prosecuted and put on trial for various criminal acts.
lifted from his shoulders.
Tony needed something to make his thoughts disappear.
“Guys, shut up for a second”
“Okay Widow, we can see you now. Shield is on their way with cleanup” Informed the good captain.
True to Steve’s word Clint had made his legendary popcorn. He just had a knack for picking the exact time for the popcorn to be done. They weren’t under-popped, nor were they beginning to turn black and gray.
All that coupled with multiple days with no sustainable food and no sleep, meant that his body shut down and he collapsed.
People always did say he cared for machines more than he did people. In truth he just understood the one more than the he did other. People were weird, that was all there was to it, there were emotions and feelings. With machines you had a code you could understand and make better. Everything was so much easier when it was just code and math.
Well technically he wasn’t all that ordinary a
The doctor said that he had some broken ribs, and two more who was a little bent. He had a large gash on his right leg from his armor caving in, and teeth marks from the rat, that was on their way to becoming infected. The dust from the building probably didn’t help anything either.
Steve was entering. Jarvis had let him in with what suspiciously sounded like a “thank you, and good luck”.
It trailed of until a gunshot could be heard. It went straight to Peppers bone’s and send a jolt through her.
Bruce looked all this over wanting to feel useful and came to the same conclusion.
Now, Tony knew that Iron Man was the part of him that everyone looked to, and that was okay, he wanted it that way. People wouldn’t, could not, look to a former “Merchant of death”, so he had wanted Iron man to become everything Tony stark couldn’t be, but everything he wanted to be. And Tony knew he was only of use while being Iron man. Yeah sure, he could make the team weapons and modify their gear to protect them better, but they would be able to survive on Shield tech, besides Tony had looked into several people who would be able to help the team out, if something were to happen to him. Conclusion he was expendable, and he was willing to take the more dangerous risks of the job, if it meant they didn’t have to.
It kept happening, but he got a lid on it, so it was only super spies that noticed the small flinches he would make when people came from behind him. Well at least Bruce didn’t notice. Because yeah, he arrived like two days after Natasha, at Tony’s own asking this time though. Since Tony figured he might at least have a little control over the situation. Now it was just Steve.
He met up with Natasha and answered her assessing glance to his armor with an “I’m fine”, and that seemed to be enough to satisfy her.
much more like an enhanced one.
. So really why shouldn’t he?
For the first time in a long time, Tony had a real smile on his lips.
God, she needed to call Rhodey and Happy and Everheart if she wanted the truth to get out controlled. She would tolerate no tabloids taking advantage of this.
“Clint cut the chatter, Tony give me status on civilian’s” Captain America demanded when Tony reached the scene.
Well, the workshop was his home. Home was the feeling he got, when Dumm-E messed up again, and nearly killed him with a motor oil-smoothie, and Jarvis Butterfingers and U taking care of him in their own way.
Not even the bas of whatever rock song he had made it to on his playlist could drown it out. He just wanted it all
“Iron man report, Widow get to him now. We will meet you there, ETA is five minutes” Captain America said, while killing the last of their rats. Steve was worried about Tony, but he also knew that he could take care of himself, maybe, in any rate black widow would be with him shortly, if she weren’t here already.
Steve never did return.
The bedroom was lacking something. There had always been a certain light to it
Tony deciding, he couldn’t wait for widow without risking civilian’s lives started shooting.
He didn’t know if he should join Tony or not.
All he could feel was round metal hitting his chest. Steve’s determined eyes drilling into his soul, unyielding and uncaring. He didn’t even care if he hit the reactor powering his suit leaving him immobile and without help. Steve walking away with his old friend under his arm, leaving an old one behind. Because that was all Tony apparently was to him. Something to fill the whole. And now Steve didn’t need him for that anymore, because he find something else, something much better. Throwing away the shield like it was nothing, like
Wade held out his hand and introduced himself, “Wade Wilson.”
Tony chuckled, “Whatever you say J. It’s good to be connected to the real you again.”
The video paused with his soulmate frozen in his torment.
Steve was happy for him and he was still elated that Tony was going to live. They were kissing again within seconds and it took only a moment for one of them to imagine a bed before they toppled into it. They laughed and kissed and one of them groaned for a particular good kiss and then their clothes were gone and then they were making love again.
Steve went to walk away, wanting to be alone, but Bruce launched himself across the room and gasped, “No! Wait!”
And there he was, he had shorter hair and a more carefree expression, but it was her James. It had been the first time she’d seen him in the years since she lost him and she had sobbed her heart out when she saw him. She printed all the ones containing James and locked them away in her burrow. She had considered telling Steve but decided against it. She didn’t want anyone’s pity or more heartbreak.
They had no idea what the perpetrators were after. Tony’s lab was in a disarray but nothing seemed to be missing. The rest of the rooms were unaffected. The only clue left to them was the USB.
Steve was laughing so hard that he didn’t even notice the reporters outside the Tower when they exited the building.
“Steve and I can continue this elsewhere,” Tony teased and pinched Steve’s shirt arm, lightly pulling him in his direction.
Tony smirked and murmured, “Welcome to the future, beloved. Now tip back your head.”
“Midgardians live by such odd standards,” Thor murmured, shaking his head in confusion.
It was so intense that the dream wavered around them and then Tony started to move and Steve could only hold on as his orgasm began to build again. He wrapped his arms and legs around his lover and prayed the night would never end.
He wasn’t damaged. His genes weren’t bad. He could find someone to love and start a family.
[You destroy everything you touch.]
Steve smirked and all thoughts on his other life vanished. Even if he had used the fake name, he wouldn’t have been able to live a quiet life, his shield was proof enough. Steve grasped his defensive weapon and slipped it on to his arm. It was a part of him and without it he felt helpless.
Tony sighed and slipped out of Steve’s arms, grumbling, “I’ll go put on some pants…”
Tony scrambled to his feet. Steve only had the shield, he had no armor, and one hit physically or with lightning could hurt or kill him! All of Tony’s anger evaporated and his fear laced his blood with acid as the hammer came down on Steve.
“It’s Vibranium, like your shield,” Tony explained. Tony pulled out his ring and stated, “And like the core of my heart.” Steve wordlessly took the ring from Tony and slid it onto Tony’s finger. Steve took the same hand and kissed its palm. Tony watched it all with a hooded gaze then met Steve’s eyes and smiled.
“We need to see what’s waiting for us inside to see what they have. We have no idea what their motive is. For all we know, as soon as we open those doors, they’ll open fire,” Steve said.
Steve sputtered an unintelligible excuse to deny him and a myriad of feelings assaulted him ranging from guilt to longing.
“Stark refers to your father and you are the ‘son’,” Jarvis replied. It tilted its head again. Jarvis never displayed so many ‘human’ inclinations while operating the armor. It was always ‘professional’ and seeing these human mannerisms sickened Tony. If his suit and AI changed this much what else happened??
Peter put down his phone with a smile and then rolled onto his back to stare up at his ceiling. He thought back to the prior night and the kisses they shared. He lightly touched his lips as he remembered the soft feel of Wade’s. He thought he would feel weird about kissing Wade, he was a man after all, but…the thought hadn’t even crossed his mind in the moment. Peter wanted to kiss him again and he wanted to do it properly, with no masks, but he didn’t know how he was going to do that without bringing him to the Tower and he didn’t think he was ready to reveal to the team, nonetheless his father, that he was dating the infamous Merc with a Mouth.
Wade sat himself on his elbows as Peter willed his shirt off him. The
“The only reason I let you live was because you were an obedient dog, but here you are, chewing through your leash. I should put you down and train the bitch to take your place instead,” the monster hissed.
“I am not going to let you sacrifice yourself needlessly,” Natasha retorted, sounding just as angry. Tony looked between the two in confusion. Wasn’t Barnes trying to kill her? Why did he care if she followed?
“He’s grown so used to flirting that it’s probably ingrained in his soul and he doesn’t even realize he’s doing it. Don’t overthink it. He’s been looking for you for decades…Don’t doubt he’d throw that all away for a dizzy waitress.”
Tony frowned, no longer in a joking mood. He ran his tongue over the back of his teeth as he regarded Pepper. She was the only one who knew everything about him with the exception of his true feelings toward Steve.
Peter fell back into the bed, groaning, “It feels like I was up all night! Even my muscles are sore!”
Bucky might be watching him right now or was tracking him down. Steve paused before the brownstone and peered up at the building. His eyes were drawn to the single window that had been in their apartment. It was on the second story, second from the right. Back then they could not afford curtains but the current owner could and those white curtains blocked his view of the inside. Steve briefly wondered who took up residence there now and if those occupants knew of its infamous past residents.
Bucky sat him down on a piece of rubble that resembled a bench and fussed over Steve and his arm, making sure he was fine. Steve shook his head and assured his friend he was alright.
Rogers totally lowered his shield and gasped, “You recognize me?”
“No,” Bucky growled into his neck, baring his teeth in a snarl. Bucky dug his fingers into Steve’s torso as if daring him to ask him to stop again.
“If he’s nineteen then he’s old enough to decide on his own what he wants,” Steve retorted.
Eddie exhaled deeply, like he had been holding his breath, and leaned heavily onto the counter beside him. He gasped, “Thank God!”
Tony cracked open the door and, as soon as he saw it was him, he opened the door for him. He was clean and, with his hair wet, Steve realized how poofy it had been when dry. Steve’s large clothes also sagged on Tony’s thin frame and the arc reactor was peeking out from behind the collar of the undershirt. Steve tried not to stare but the mechanism was beautiful with its glow and linear flower-like design. His fingers itched to sketch it.
Venom took Peter's chosen form of the black Spider-Man and Peter grinned to himself as he admired how cool he looked.
~~Takes place a few months after the events of Captain America 2, Steve is depressed. He's called into SHIELD and thinks it's for a mission but it is actually so Agent Hill can sit him down to tell him when he was frozen the Hydra agents in SHIELD took part in his extraction from the ice. Hydra tried to recreate a super soldier and with Steve's sperm is able to impregnate several women, in the end, only one baby survives. The boy is without a doubt Steve's son and Hydra doused him with gamma-radiated spider DNA to make him stronger than Steve. Agent Hill asks Steve if he wants to see him to which Steve says yes. When he sees his son, he instantly is smitten... and that's the foundation for Building a Superfamily series!~~
“Captain Rogers, Sir only drinks once a year,” Jarvis stated.
The best part, this was all him. It had no part in Howard’s legacy and with these suits he was going to make so much more of a difference than Howard ever did.
Natasha went to Steve’s side and Clint went straight to Tyler. Tyler was unsteadily trying to get to her feet but she snarled at the archer as he approached and Clint punched her right between the eyes, knocking her out.
Peter joined him and looked down at the people below. It was dark so his eyes were mostly drawn to the busy traffic in the streets as the lights of the cars and street lamps illuminated the movement.
Peter met Tony’s gaze. The older man was sitting up straight and had his hands clenched in front of him. He looked nervous. He always looked nervous around Peter. It made Peter more nervous than he already was.
So I've written y'all a super angsty chapter as an apology for being gone so long! ^_^
“You’re in a recovery room in New York City,” she replied with a reassuring tone.
Peter fell back onto the couch behind him and buried his head in his hands. The mask flopped over the top of his head and the angled, glass eyes glared at Tony.
He asked Friday which option was harder, like the answer would somehow make things easier.
away from it.”
“Where did he go??” Tony demanded, hoping for a miracle.
He only lost the momentum when he was able to see the balcony through the glass and…and then see him.
Tony got up and asked, “It isn’t serious, is it? Do you need the Avengers?”
Steve gulped and nodded, afraid to speak.
“I don't need Jarvis to babysit me,” Tony stated stubbornly. “Give me a gun and hiking boots and I'm ready to go.”
“No and yes,” Tony replied for Ben. He had read the same records Steve did on Mary Parker. “They served SHIELD as both spies and scientists…scientists mostly according to the files.”
It was at that moment, Peter felt the sickening tingling at the back of his neck and his heart lurched.
Steve cringed. Peter had inherited his super strength and it was both a blessing and a curse. Steve did not have worry about hurting Peter with his own superior strength but Peter did not know how to control his own power.
So this was Tony’s touch.
He was still wary about Tony’s endgame but Tony wanting to talk about “stuff” was encouraging. At that moment, all he cared about was that Tony had done this for them and not the cameras.
Steve’s face crumbled as soon as his eyes fell on the image. Tony only saw the deep sadness in his eyes for a second before Steve masked it all away.
He also discovered how giving he was when Steve told Tony about devouring the food at the shelter, Tony sprang to his feet and gasped, “Of course! Your metabolism!”
He assumed Steve was not interested in being more than his friend and that he was participating in this fake relationship to help out his case…Could he be wrong about Steve?
By feeding Venom was better able to bond with his host. He could access the boy’s memories and intelligence. He used it to move around the city and evade capture.
“Are you okay?” Steve asked, feeling guilty.
“Steve!?” Bucky went to stop him again, but Steve wouldn’t let himself falter and kept striving forward. Bucky’s grip on him broke but his stride don’t break. Bucky followed close behind, cursing Steve’s stubbornness under his breath.
Peter sat up slowly, careful to not wake Wade. His boyfriend didn't stir and Peter smiled down at him.
“And if a solution to this is never found?” She countered, “Would you stay cryogenically frozen
Mark III.
He went back to his lab and gazed around it. His mind was abuzz with possibilities and he was already drawing up schematics for possible machinery Bruce might need. At the moment he was thinking of possible cure drug deliveries: liquid (some kind of injecting system), gaseous (a ventilation system), etc. If they came up with a solution to destroy Venom, Tony wanted to be prepared.
Tony decided Fury was an insane maniac who was trying to start World War III.
The situation with Ross when the man was trying to killing Peter and then later when he and Bucky kissed all heightened his emotions. He was an emotional wreck and was not thinking as clearly as he was right now. It was the only reason why he reacted to Bucky so strongly! He was out of his mind and he turned to the only source of love that had been a center for him for the majority of his life. From even when he had nothing he had Bucky. Bucky had always been his right-hand man and when he was in such an emotional turmoil it was no wonder he turned to Bucky for support and latched onto it, thinking it romantic love.
Steve chuckled dryly, “I thought you did not remember that night…”
He was crying.
Howard sighed and looked back to Tony and murmured ironically, “Time’s all my son has.”
On a side note, since I started writing this I kept telling myself to start posting things to tumblr and now I am finally going to start! I'm mostly going to be posting small excerpts from future chapters before actually posting them here (keep in mind I am writing two fics right now so there will be content from both of them [the other fic being Steve/Bucky]). If you want to follow me on tumblr you can find me
“Hmm?” Tony looked at him then blinked rapidly as if his mind was catching up to his body. He stared at Steve for a moment, then asked, “Are you sure there is no one, Steve? Do you really want to do this with me? And not just the kissing…the fake relationship even?”
Tony continued, “My dad says that you’re my soulmate if we share dreams. He says I can only dream if you’re also dreaming…He doesn’t believe that I dream as soon as I go to sleep…that there’s never darkness. Dad says that it is ‘virt-virtually impossible.’” Tony struggled with the larger words. He had obviously imitated whatever his father had said. Tony continued, “He says there are nights where you are awake or I am awake so I should have experienced some darkness. He doesn't think you’re real. He said you should be my age so you must be an ima-imaginary friend I made up…”
He shouldered the pain the best he could and forced himself to focus elsewhere. If he survived this he knew he was going to have horrible nightmares about burning alive.
Steve visibly relaxed and looked miserable all at once but continued to sign all the dotted lines she had marked off for him.
“Fanfare?” Steve asked as finished his inspection.
“I don’t like this,” Peter murmured, the very fringes of his spidey-sense was tingling. It was probably from his apprehension so Peter ignored it and focused on the task at hand as he argued, “This is stealing! It’s Mac’s work!”
Steve did not look away from the image on the screen and he interrupted Bruce, “This is the only way…you said so yourself. Peter is an innocent boy, he barely lived his life. I won’t let Venom take that away from him…”
Tony’s fingers dug into Steve’s chest and Steve placed his hand over Tony’s and squeezed it lightly.
“Sir, you and Master Rogers are trending on Twitter,” Jarvis informed him.
When he reached the man’s side, the President grinned and said, “You look quite formidable now! The Mandarin would be a fool to go after me with you
He dropped his head and painfully gasped, “I just
. He could get his father to go as far to kick Eddie out of the program. The lab and Venom could be his alone.
“But now it’s dark again,” Steve hissed into the comforter. Tony was dead. Bucky was no longer Bucky. Steve wondered if Peter would be enough to bring back the light again but he instantly threw away the thought. Before Steve found Peter, he thought himself cursed. People died around him and nothing went in his favor. His joy with Peter and Tony clouded him from it and he thought it was over, but he was wrong. He was still cursed. Peter could not be that light because then Steve would clearly be marking him for death.
“I’m close,” Tony reasoned. “It won’t do much for you.”
“…And why would I wear a hammock as I dance? And isn’t a lap dance something strippers do?” Steve asked extremely confused. He envisioned himself wearing a hammock like a toga. Why would
“Hi,” Peter’s voice still broke but this time it was from a combination of being dry and overwhelmed with emotion as he stared into Wades beautiful blue eyes. He muttered, “Do I really look bad?”
“I can’t get you a bunk tonight. You’ll have to be assigned one by your superior and I have yet to inform the head of mechanics he’s got a new guy as he’s asleep.”
Wade ripped off his mask and pressed his face into Peter’s hair and wetly gasped, “I love you too, Peter.”
Jarvis was busily hacking into and monitoring all the security cameras in the city and Tony had hired a handful of PIs to search homeless shelters.
Tony blinked in surprise then looked up from the coffee. When he saw it was Steve he smiled warmly and said, “Hey there.”
She huffed out a weak excuse for a chuckle and whispered, “You are wrong on both accounts. The names you listed are all names the Academy gave us. I want you to tell me the names we had before the Academy, the names we spoke only when we were alone…”
“Nineteen, yesterday” Tony whispered.
“…Can someone tell us what the bloody hell is going on?” Monty demanded.
Tony did not counter his declaration. He just held him tighter. They were no longer denying it nor pretending there was a way to save him. They had tried and failed and saw with their own eyes their son give up.
And then horror.
Peter’s eyes went back to his costume and took it all in. To Peter, both of the primary colors had always been representative of his fathers and the morals they taught him which he planned to carry with him as a hero.
“More like a couple of damn owls kept me up last night with all their hooting.”
Thanks for reading! :)
Tony’s heart clenched as he irrevocably remembered the video Schmidt sent him.
“Let’s focus on two words in that statement,” Tony growled. “One: fractures, as in the hundreds of fractures that are lining nearly every inch of your femur, tibia, fibula, and the majority of your ribs! Two: growing, as in your skin, as in the left side of your head is pretty much devoid of it. And you want to leave this safe, sanitized space to do what exactly?”
“Hello, Stark. Nice to hear from you. How am I you ask? Having a pretty shitty day,” Fury sarcastically replied in just a loud of a voice. “Why you ask? Well, a defrosted super solider just escaped one of the most secure facilities in the world and we have no idea where he’s going or the state of his mental condition. Is this worrisome? Maybe. Why? Probably because I keep having flashbacks of two months ago when Bruce Banner, another super powered human, Hulked out practically destroyed Harlem. Should I be worried about what a man who is emotionally compromised by the situation thinks? I think the fuck not.”
After Venom’s first attack, Bruce had said they thought the symbiote was trying to fuse with Peter. Did-Did it try and succeed this time? Peter felt sick and wanted to rip the symbiote off him like the leech it was at that moment.
The sight alone was enough to turn Steve’s blood cold but feeling the blood made his heart freeze over and spurned Steve to jog over to the doctors.
He needed to make Bucky’s old hangover remedy.
“I’m preoccupied,” Wade retorted, rubbing his face against the side of Peter’s. Peter smirked and leaned deeper into Wade's hold.
The entrance to the building was mostly glass so he found it easily enough and was outside a couple of minutes after breaking free. He kept running down the street, not slowing in the slightest until, well, until he started to recognize the street signs and then realized he was truly in New York. He stumbled a little over his own feet but regained his pace, taking in the sight because…because this was not the New York he remembered.
“Wow,” Tony gasped, his voice breathless. Was that a good “wow”?
They had been so close – so close to squashing that little menace for the bug that he was.
Bucky didn’t reply and Tony took that as another memory lost to him so he said, “When we get the chance, let’s scan this thing and see how it ticks.”
Pepper led the way as he and Steve followed, holding each other’s hands. Both of them were jittery with nerves and excitement. They only let go of each other when they were both pulled aside to be outfitted with microphones and the connecting battery packs that hooked onto the back of their belts under their jackets.
Steve sat down and held the edge of the comforter. The winds carried the blanket over the edge and it billowed and flapped madly in his grip. He watched the world go by with the red comforter always in the edge of his vision. Vehicles would stop and go at the whim of the traffic lights and the pedestrians were an ever moving mass, indistinguishable from such a height.
Steve put his hand over Tony’s, pressing Tony’s hand into his cheek. Steve whispered, “It is different. This is more than friendship. I’m in love with you, Tony. I’ve been in love with you for years but did not act on it because - because I’m dead. I didn’t want you to feel as if you had to commit to me or trap you. But...” Steve caressed the back of Tony’s knuckles with his thumb. “Almost losing you...it doesn’t matter anymore. I didn’t want us to separate without you knowing...I love you so much. You are my everything, you-.”
Peter sat up with a sigh and said, “If I take it off, will you be willing to continue?”
Steve surged forward and kissed him again. Tony staggered a little under the push but he readily wrapped his arms around Steve and returned the kiss.
“Holy shit,” Clint cursed and his gaze repeatedly shot from Peter to Steve as he took in their familiar characteristics.
“Peter,” she whispered, her voice filled with distress. “Peter, your father, Richard, he raised you, he loved you, but…”
Steve hummed in agreement and let out a small, tired sigh as he settled down for sleep again. Tony’s adrenaline was still up from being shocked awake but he did try to relax too. He shifted his head over Steve’s chest to better hear his steady heartbeat and feel the rise and fall of his chest as he breathed.
He paused as he remembered the nano suit. He could still feel the odd sensation of the millions of tiny robots crawling on his skin.
“Tony, you are a Godsend,” Steve gasped at one point.
“You two were a little stiff up there,” Pepper stated. “Some noticed but most are attributing it to the trauma of forcibly being ousted…Twitter has already tweeted a formal apology and supports you two in your relationship and your stance in the accusation…Where did Tony go?”
Steve lifted his head and smiled sadly at his friend. He whispered, “There’s nothing you can do…”
him. It said he was too weak, that Peter was a better host…but Peter didn’t even want it…
“Jeez, you two look like a couple of saps mourning over an old ex,” Dum Dum said as he trotted up to the fire, holding a stack of MREs.
Howard put the core on the ground and began to curse under his breath as he lowered the sharp flame to it.
Tony went to pull out of their embrace but Howard stopped him by grasping his arms. Tony looked at his father questionably. The man was smiling widely at him and he whispered, “I thought I was sending you away to a desolate future but you ended up finding your happily ever after?”
He rushed the larger man and then pushed him out of the locker room, practically tripping over his feet as he whined, “But they’re so sexy, Petey!”
They helped each other up and then Tony picked up the blanket and shook it out. Steve helped him refold it and, when they pressed together the last fold, they were within each other’s space again only they were facing each other. They didn’t pull away but lingered with their hands just barely touching where they each held their ends of the blanket.
“What do we do?” Steve demanded of the scientists. “Is it Peter who is awake or –?”
better kisser.”
“That I’m dead?” Steve easily guessed.
Steve and the others laughed. He pulled Tony into a half hug and said, “Welcome to the team!”
“We brought you here for a myriad of reasons but, mainly, we want to make sure you are alright,” Coulson replied.
All at once, Tony was elated and crushed. Peter was safe but Steve must have…
Norman stared at the boy and wondered what had happened. Harry knew not to disturb him when he was in his office. He also knew he should not approach Norman with trivial matters and was to wait until Norman asked him of his needs.
“J…bring up the footage from the night Steven fell into our lives,” Tony commanded.
“Yup,” Tony said, stepping next to her as she stared into the container.
“Not without Uncle Clint to watch,” Steve replied, making Peter sigh. Steve asked him, “How long have you been able to crawl on walls?”
Steve was tense.
Tony reached out to Steve and he tightly grasped Tony’s hand. Bucky rounded Tony and stood next to Howard, ready to jump on Tony if needed.
Steve turned off the shower with a renewed sense of purpose. He wanted Tony. He should try Tony’s way. Maybe it was all he needed.
They kissed again, more deeply than Steve and Tony had ever attempted before, like they were trying to show each other the true depth of their love but it was unattainable through the kiss alone.
Tony.
have paid me to impersonate one of the Avengers and rob a bank.”
Steve snorted and replied, No, you?”
Steve looked up and was shocked to see Sam. He had forgotten he was there.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony sighed in relief and Steve grasped his hand. Tony turned to his soulmate with a smile. Steve smiled back and then turned and stated to everyone, “And next to fall will be Hydra, but first…can someone find me some proper pants?”
me,” Bucky hissed to Steve. “It looked like you two were five seconds from sucking on each other's faces.” He leaned in closer to Steve and in an even lower voice, grumbled, “
“Mary!” Ben grasped her hands and whispered, “Please, I know this a lot to take in but Steve and Peter want you in their lives. They’re good people. And May and I want you back in ours. Please, leave this tower. Steve and the rest of the Avengers would never let anything bad happen to you. Hydra is gone. Haven’t you been watching the news? They were washed out from SHIELD years ago.”
“–It was pa-palladium?” Steve drove on, not wanting to hear it and he repeated what he heard from Tony’s sarcastic question to Jarvis. Steve did not let go of Tony, but turned to Peggy and asked, “Do we have anything like that? Maybe Howard?”
. Steve maybe be an old man at that point but he was going to be apart of it.
Steve parked his bike and walked up to the building where he and Bucky lived in together. When they lived in the building it had been crumbing and looked like it would not stand for much longer. Since then, it had been retrofitted. The building still looked fairly old but it no longer appeared it was on the verge of collapse. It was only three stories and the top two stories looked like they were apartments. The bottom floor was an Italian deli.
Steve tensed and he automatically grasped Peter.
Get to know the man who had an affair with his mom and then left her once she got pregnant with Peter?
Many on the list were their friends, agents of SHIELD, and noted figures in the superhero community.
“I take it I already have a statement ready and waiting for me,” Tony dryly asked, laying his head on Steve’s shoulder.
Steve shook his head and said, “You didn’t see his face after I…I kissed him. He looked so shocked. I think he suspects I was more than practicing and was creeped out…”
“No,” Uncle Bucky retorted. “You are daft. We need to lock you away so you don’t hurt yourself.”
I believe you.”
Steve moved back and draped a blanket over Tony. He rubbed his arms and murmured, “Ready to go to bed?”
Both Peter and Wade jolted and looked up to the open car door Peter had come in through. Stark was standing there with his arms crossed over his chest and frowning.
Howard’s question stumped him. Steve didn’t know how to reply. Yes, Steve loved Tony but what did that love amount to if Tony had let Bucky die? Steve was too much of an emotional wreck at that moment to even begin to comprehend where they stood now.
The stranger saw them and then cheerfully waved, “Hey guys! Woah! Wow. You two are super hot! I mean you’re already hot but right now you are smokin! Where are your clothes? Did I just interrupt some sexy times?”
He sat up sharply, gasping to air. Bucky, Sam, and Peter all leapt to their feet and surrounded his bedside in seconds. Peter lunged forward and embraced him. Steve returned the embrace with one arm and hissed when he went to move the other. He fell back onto the angled bed and saw his entire left side was bandaged.
The Winter Soldier got up in the meanwhile and walked across the bridge, to where Steve had knocked away his gun, and picked it up.
Tony slipped off his work gloves and tossed them on the counter next to him. He walked over to the bathroom and pulled his shirt off over his head. Steve merely glimpsed Tony’s structured back muscles before he dropped his gaze. He heard enter the bathroom and the shower turn on. Tony yelled out, “Hey Cap! Can you grab one of my suits out of the closet? It’s by the bots’ charge-stations. Open the door, will you Jarvis?”
nothing! The past is gone! There's nothing you can change about it! I am not the same man I was ten years ago and I gladly let it go. And
Tony rubbed his face into Steve’s belly as his hands squeezed his ass and murmured, “You like me when I’m dirty.”
Together, the three of them went to where the rest of the Commandos were. Bucky wasn’t too thrilled to see Steve awake. Unsurprisingly, Steve and Tony’s eyes locked and stayed so as the distance dwindled between them.
Tony let out a huff that was a cross between a chuckle and a sigh. He rubbed the back out his neck and said, “Well Project Winterwidow One was a bust…Don’t worry man, Project Two will do much better!”
Steve looked up at him. They weren't this close to each other physically since yesterday. Their eyes met and they both searched each other’s gazes. Steve had no idea what Tony was looking for but Steve was looking for the reason behind his words. Why did he risk himself for Steve? Was it more than friendship or comradery?
How did their lives come to this?
Tony eyed his outstretched hand for a long moment then grasped it, shaking it in acceptance. He murmured, “No problem, Terminator.”
“You – You goddamn, jerk,” Steve cried. He wasn’t sure which of them moved first but one moment they were both staring at each other and the next there were crushing each other in a tight embrace.
“If Bucky is fine with it…” Steve started to say but Tony clapped his hands together before he could continue.
He was in the future and Tony shared his bed.
They smiled at each other bashfully then Tony suggested, “Why don’t we get a little closer?”
“Such a romantic as always,” Peter sighed but his heart was already longing for it. He felt better with his eyes closed. Maybe it really was time for bed. He continued, “I just got to say my good-byes and then we can head up to my room.”
Everything would have been perfect…If it were not for Natasha and Bucky’s relationship.
Steve’s gaze was soft and his words were rational. Tony fell into Steve’s side and sighed, “I know…”
“This is Happy’s favorite car, isn’t it?” Steve asked him in a hushed voice.
Coulson’s brows shot up in surprise. He probably thought Peter did not remember him and would be as shy as when they last met. Coulson look awkwardly down to where Peter had attached himself to his leg and said, “Hello Peter. Happy birthday.”
Howard looked pissed and looked like he wanted to argue further but Tony murmured, “Let’s just get down to why we are here in the first place and get it over with…”
“Stevie, even if he was…he’s going to be like all the others. He’s not going to stay. He has another life, decades away…”
Sure, he’d have matches but whenever he met up with them, their timers remained unchanging.
“He’s no good for Peter,” Tony argued to the plate in front of him. Steve still stood behind him and Tony dared not turn around to see his expression.
Tony tossed the uniform back on the table with a groan.
“That does not change the fact that you are still dangerous,” Fury countered.
,” Venom hissed back. “
“That’s our son,” Steve whispered with an edge of awe.
He opened a new board and pretended his mind did not wander in…
They laid back down, this time closer, with their chests pressed so tightly together that they could feel each other’s heartbeats. Peter nestled his face against Wade’s and closed his eyes as he listened to him breathe.
“Make him extremely happy?” Peter countered.
"I am sorry, Sir. I took the liberty of recording your response live and sent it to Master Parker."
Steve’s hold on him tightened and Steve repeated, “All of it?”
No longer burdened with fear and the need for silence. Steve was loud with his moans and gasped the sweetest words of encouragement that made Tony pause a few times just to kiss his super soldier silent to help his heart rate lower enough so it would not explode out of his chest from the sentiment.
“Pepper wants you to give them a quick address just to calm them down,” Tony said.
Venom turned to the source of the voice. A massive, green beast stood at one end of the sewer. For a moment, Venom thought it was the Hulk, returned to attack him again, but then he noticed the beast’s eyes glowed red not green.
He wasn’t going to have to worry about the press or being Tony Stark’s son. Tonight, he was just going to be Peter and he was going to spend time with Wade.
“Secure line? Are you serious?” Tony retorted, slightly offended.
Steve lay back down and collected Tony closer to him, entangling their legs and tucking their faces together. He lightly kissed the top of Tony’s nose before tucking his nose along his making Tony chuckle.
He missed Tony desperately…but he wasn’t going to risk his life just to see him.
Steve slipped a glance at her arm but her implant was hidden beneath her gloves…he actually had
“What did you think would happen?” Tony retorted angrily on his behalf. He had been just as worried and devastated as Steve had been when they got the alert.
“Worse?”
James was dead but she would avenge him.
“It said it will let us know if it found the Red Skull or not. Either way it will have to come back because the time machine is here,” Steve commented, holding back his smile with his final add on.
It didn’t bother her too much however.
“Dad…Pops…please disregard everything said in the last thirty seconds,” Peter said in a muffled voice as his hand still covered his face.
He was just liking this jerk…but now the other boy was going to treat him differently. Touching the soul implant in his arm, Steve replied truthfully, “They went after me cause I told them I didn’t do no crying because I’m not gonna meet my soulmate…and they decided they were gonna make me cry.”
“We have civilians running to the subways. The rats are trying to follow, but they are too big. I’ve counted four, but I can’t see them all so i’m moving higher. Iron man out”
Clint mostly spent the time in his nest (though he refused to call it that) and Tony was fine with that, really, he was.
Steve for all his want of getting to know Tony better, had no idea how to approach a subject they could talk about. Everything seemed to personal. He couldn’t ask about Pepper, for all he knew she was still upset at Tony for nearly getting himself killed. Even though the invasion was close to two months ago, that woman could hold a grudge like nothing Steve had ever seen. And he couldn’t really talk about anything political since he wasn’t up to date yet, and simply asking ‘how have your day been’ seemed wrong.
. While to Tony he had been so much more. But no one understood that.
“Jarvis prep the suits, daddy is going out, and please turn of the damn alarm” Tony said already making his way towards the workshops, knowing that the suit would meet him on the way.
He threw some khaki trousers that Steve looked absolutely ridiculous in but he still always wore because it reminded him of his old clothing, when a small black box came free.
Because Tony had—
He remembered how it felt when Steve betrayed him. Telling him “he is my friend” like Tony meant nothing to him. Like everything they had together was meaningless. How it felt when Steve hit him with the shield over and over not stopping even when Tony held up his arms in defense. He couldn’t bring himself to take the shot, even when the shield was hitting his suits reactor, making a crack that he could
Steve had
He just needed it all to end.
Still it was only awkward a few seconds. Steve could deal with that in the big scale of things.
The doctors concluded that even without all the drugs, Tony was most likely going to sleep for a long time, but not to worry, because it was just his body catching up on lost sleep and trying to get some energy back.
Steve was most definitely not smiling anymore quite the contrary, he was worried.  He kept thinking, when should he have taken action, what could have been prevented if he had seen enough to realize the stench of his teammates injuries (he didn’t want to presume he was his friend, though he did hope that with time they could move beyond teammates and maybe even friends, to become something much more united).
It did not make it any easier to bear though.
She couldn’t do anything than rocking back and forth trying to get air into her lungs.
He was done dealing with it all. He was tired. Tired of pretending like everything was fine. Like he doesn’t spend the nights waking up soaked in sweat. Like his heart hadn’t been shattered into a million pieces.
sitting in his goddamn kitchen yes,
He wondered why he shouldn’t do it. The media hated him. Steve hated him. The entire team hated him. His only everlasting friend was in the hospital because
What he did not expect where
His clothes even still had a fragrance of the shampoo Steve always used.
It was a beautiful mix between blue and rec. Their two colors. Entwined with each other, like they would stay together forever.
She did not think she could cry more than she already did. She belatedly wondered if she should search for attackers. Maybe Hydra had come in here and— God, she couldn’t even say the words in her own mind. She would think that was what happened if he didn’t have the goddamn most peaceful look she had ever seen on his face ever. Like something heavy was
Tony was hovering over his worktable, multiple bits and pieces lying around. The room cast in a blue light from the holo touchpads, and vibrating with some kind of rock song, from a time Steve haven’t caught up on yet.
He couldn’t but hope whenever he walked into their (former) shared bedroom that Stew would walk out of the bedroom any minute, wearing nothing but a towel hugging his hips, and his body glistening with water. And then it would hit him all over again.
Tony didn’t notice it at first, but the sound of rain hitting the floor brought his attention. And then he saw it.
Piles of clothing lay all over the bedroom floor. Thrown away by a man that had been broken so many times he lost count.
The doctor had set his broken ribs, so his whole torso was wrapped up. Furthermore, they had to give antibiotics to battle the upcoming infection. They also gave him something for the pain and to keep him under, while they stitched up the leg. Some basic nutrients were also added since the little to no food meant he was well on his way to becoming malnourished.
Tony couldn’t concentrate. The briefing was boring, but he doesn’t think that is the reason why he can’t focus on anything. His ears are roaring, like a thousand bees buzzing around him. Except there are no bees, if there are he can’t see them. Tony can feel himself being pulled down, but he can’t really muster the strength to resist. The buzzing is getting louder, they begin to fill his vision too, until everything he can see if black.
couldn’t even love him, so what hope did he have left? If America’s golden boy couldn’t love him, then what did that say about him? If the man that was famous for being sweet and kind, would hold the murderer of his
All she could think about was the blood. And the smile,
That was what Tony and Steve emerged to. The sound of popping popcorn from the kitchen, and people fighting over the choice of what they movie they were going to watch. And all Tony could wonder was,
But Steve was also sad, because Tony was still important to him.
The ‘looks like everyone is okay’ didn’t sit right with him, but he would see shortly how they were holding up. He was worried about Tony. He knew Tony was strong in and out of the armor, it still worried him when Tony threw himself into a battle, more when he was without backup ready to assist him. Which Tony did often. So yeah, Steve was probably going to be permanently worried because of one sole man.
He held Tony’s limb hand in his, listening to the heart monitor and feeling his pulse against his fingertips. Everything to make sure he hadn’t lost another one he cared about. One more face to long for when sleep eluded him. For once he didn’t care about what others might think of him if they saw him weak and seeking reassurances. He needed to have the pulse right where he could feel it.
Steve had never wanted to hit anyone so much, but instead he got up and walked away.
Again, Tony was not that good at
“Jarvis what have we got, open com link please”
Sometimes he wonders if Steve would have continued. The shield hitting soft flesh and going down to the bone. Not caring what he did to Tony. Sometimes he clawed away from the flashback with red marks on his chest. Tony couldn’t even bring himself to care anymore.
He could hear the sound of the jet landing. The rest of the team moved quickly and fluidly, Natasha taking to stealth and moving in the shadows. Clint taking a ride with Tony was deposited on one of the roofs, where he had a clear view over everything. Steve was meeting them head on, assisted by Hulk, swinging with his shield and hulk with his fists. Meanwhile, Tony took them down from the air, while trying to locate the fourth rat.
Tony could see more than hear Natasha. His ears were ringing, but it was starting to lessen.
He was ripped out of the rat’s mouth. Tony seized the opportunity and shot the rat clean through with his repulser beam.
Natasha was parading around the hallways, whispering in Russian about how much of an idiot he was, scaring many doctors and nurses.
the future (He was far more better in protecting it). But in all honesty, he couldn’t have predicted giant rats running wild.
“It seems sir, that giant rats have crawled out from the underground.”
“Sir, Mr. Rogers is asking if he could be let in”
had just called him something
Clint had sat himself up on the closet, so he had a nice and big view over the entrance and Tony.
He could distantly hear Friday, but he couldn’t make out what she was saying for all the buzzing in his head. There was a raspy voice telling her to “mute”, and event that feat lead precious air out. Air that he couldn’t get in again.
And well Tony might be clueless about personal stuff, but he did know Russian. But there was nothing that could convince him that
She had seen how his smiles had seemed to big. He was beginning to linger in his touches, but always pulling away quickly when he was afraid people didn’t want it (though Pepper made a point to not notice so he continued with the touch he needed). She had tried to do everything in her power to help him, making sure Tony knew that she did it because she wanted to, and not because she felt like she had to. Taking most of the media of his back and trying to get the truth out with the help of her former rival now turned friend Christine Everheart. Most likely raising a few blood pressures wherever team cap was now (though she couldn’t honestly care about them). Putting lawyers to work on the Accords even though she hated doing it, since she knew the reason why Tony wanted them changed was for trying to get Steve back. And Pepper was firm in her belief that Tony deserved so much better than him.
Not the one on her own floor, but Tony’s very own kitchen on his own goddamn floor.
Tony knew that there were people in his house. Knew that it was pulsating, with something he had never been able to give it. Not when it had only ever been him and Jarvis, and for a very short time Pepper too. Pepper who still hurt. A lot. She was still his friend. He just did not understand. Why? She was supposed to be the one who would stay.
The others quickly made move to get their own gear. Well except for Bruce that made move to the jet.
It hurt like hell.
He skimmed the left side, having already looked at the right side and finding nothing.
Rogers came in looking like a soldier would. Stiff back and ready to execute a plan. Apparently that plan was to socialize Tony Stark. Since Steve was asking if he would join them at movie night, because everyone was getting tired of Natasha picking Disney movies. It was said with such a sincere smile and those puppy dog eyes that Tony could just not say no to. So, that was how he found himself nervously tapping his foot (he refused to tap the arc reactor, since it would put more attention to it). He was very bad at socializing when business wasn’t involved.
And Tony wanted it all burned and buried. Every piece that was a reminder of something he couldn’t have anymore.
The rat was quick though.
Maybe he could let himself believe he could have this?
“Yeah sure. Jarvis save everything and run the simulation for that explosive arrow would you, thanks buddy”
Clint was their sharpshooter. Bruce the only able to take care of their injuries, since every Avenger hated medical. Steve was their captain, and well Captain America. Thor were a god and Natasha was her usual badass. So really, Tony was the only one left.
He moved over to the side, not sneaking up on Tony. Because he knew how much Tony disliked that, even if he never said anything. His steps were clouded over by the drum solo though, so Tony didn’t notice him.
He still couldn’t see the fourth rat, and it bugged him. A lot.
He usually didn’t spend the Tuesdays’ with movie-nigh. Well, most days he was not even aware of what day it was.
People always did leave.
- Graphic descriptions of suicide
It was a Tuesday, and Steve didn’t really fancy being worried on movie night, but he was and there was nothing he could do about it.
He didn’t even know where he got it from.
(See the end of the chapter for
But at the moment she couldn’t deal with that.
People were chatting around him, but he was to engrossed in eating his food and watching the news.
But it turned out to be fine, Tony just hid in the ‘shop a little more than usual. He did spend most of his time there already, so it wasn’t like people were going to worry.
Steve was still running through the words in his head. They didn’t make sense; Tony couldn’t be dead. He could not. He was supposed to realize he was wrong and then come to him.
Now she guesses she wouldn’t be able to glare at him that way again…
“Your social skills are as impeccable as ever, sir”
Several workers were cowering behind their desk and anything they could get behind.
Steve came in with a kicked puppy look that Tony just could not withstand. In truth should Tony maybe have asked him, but the thought of Howard hanging over him again kept putting him of. But it was a dick move, he could tell from how Natasha eyed him. Tony was just really happy that he could tell what that glare at him meant. It wasn’t everyday he knew that.
Pepper and Tony had been many things, but first and foremost they were friends in every sense of the word. Well, Tony had been a friend to her. Pepper didn’t think she could be worthy of calling her his friend anymore. What kind of friend was she if she hadn’t seen this coming?
“Nothing- “he said, suddenly feeling a little embarrassed, “just wanted to know if you’re ready for movie night. Plus, Clint is making his really good popcorn, that you don’t want to miss” He added with an afterthought, afraid if Tony was going to say no, even though he had already said yes.
Remember the first kiss they ever shared. Rushed because they didn’t know if a shield agent was about to walk into the conference room. Steve hesitant and Tony wondering if Steve was going to survive having him as a boyfriend. All his good ol’ insecurities acting up. Always trying to make life harder for him. Their many dates and nights spend together. Many of the night spent in silence while they clung to each other’s company. Coffee dates where Steve tried Tony to eat at least a little slice of a bagel, before he had to go back to his engineering binge.
She didn’t say anything as she crept over to him. Her eyes narrowed at his forehead making it feel like he had a target there. “Where are your eyebrows?” There it was.
“Yeah. You’ve said that before. How do you know his feelings haven’t changed, huh? He went on that date with Enchantress,” Sam quipped. Natasha gave him a wry smile.
“Y-yes,” her voiced cracked. “Listen, we can fix this. I’m sure the Professor has something that can take this right off. I can go check right now.” Before he could say anything, she shrunk before zooming out of the room.
“I just really wanted to see if we could work, you know? I always hate when we fight and when we’re being friends it’s just so good. The little smile that he has when I actually say something funny, but he doesn’t want to admit it. The way we can actually laugh at things together and hang out. When he listens to me when I say maybe he should go to bed. I just wish that could be all the time.”
“Yeah well good job, Nat. He went and got rejected thanks to you.”
Then there was a knock on the door to his apartment. He assumed it was Jan coming back, probably to apologize because Pym didn’t have anything to fix his face. Tony made his way into the living room with a sour look on his face. “It better be good news, Jan.” He opened the door with a jerk.
“Wait. Before you laugh. Just hear me out, okay?” That voice could only belong to one person. Tony’s sometime rival, sometime friend, Steven Grant Rogers. Who was holding a teddy bear the size of Tony. With a sign asking him to prom. The explosion had actually killed him. It was the only explanation. Tony had died and had somehow gained entrance to heaven.
“Oh man. You got it bad. You know I usually wouldn’t say this, but maybe you should try again. Without the teddy bear.”
“Jan. How long does it take for eyebrows to grow back?” He was worried that he didn’t want to know the answer.
“Oh Sam, Sam, Sam. Even Steve-O went on a date with her. She has magic coercion powers, Wilson. She hypnotizes Tony all the time. It doesn’t matter anyways. He may flirt with everyone, but he only has a plush of one star spangled man.” She cast a glance at Steve who flushed at the look.
“Suit? What suit?” If he had eyebrows, they would have been pulled down for his questioning face. Jan gave him a sympathetic look.
“They’re gone. Not forever, but definitely for a while,” he sighed. It wasn’t a new experience to burn off parts of one brow, but for them to be fully gone… that was new. He shuffled past her before flopping onto his bed with a harrumph. “I was hoping to hide out here till I could figure out what to do about them. So, what’re you doing here Jan?”
Tony was left all alone to question whether he should look in a mirror at the mess that was his face or to just wallow in self-pity on his bed. The wallowing sounded a lot better, but he had to see the damage for himself. He wished he had just wallowed. It was bad. One side looked semi-normal. More like a line than a curve. The other was the disaster. Apparently, when he laughed it caused her hand to jiggle up and down before shooting down the side of his face. It looked like he had let a child draw on him. And it was all in black Sharpie.
“Well loverboy, you’re wrong. Without him saying it explicitly, it wasn’t really a no. In other instances it might be different, but this is Tony. I know every one of his little secrets and I know he likes you, too.”
“A plush. It’s a soft doll that you can cuddle. And I know Stark cuddles it quite frequently.”
“Steve man. What’s wrong? I haven’t seen you this dejected since Shellhead went out on that date with Enchantress.” Sam still couldn’t believe his best friend’s crush on the annoying playboy. Tony was irresponsible and pushy to the limit where Sam wanted to clock him one, but Steve really liked the guy. So he let it slide sometimes.
“Jan. Just tell me…”
No, wait. Hell. Because here was Steven Grant Rogers, the Captain America, asking Tony to prom when he had no eyebrows. Steve had yet to see Tony’s face, so he slammed the door in Steve’s face.
“Oh good. So they should be back at least half way.”
Steve stood reaching for the bear. He had it specially made for Tony. Behind the cue card you could see the arc reactor in its chest, which glowed softly with a led light. It was big and small, just like Tony. Steve’s chin could rest on its head when he stood them up. He had done it multiple times the days before. Imagining doing it to the real thing. “I really like him. Like maybe…”
“I uh… I messed up, Sam,” he murmured. Steve ran a hand through his hair for the fifth time since Sam had come over. His hair was disheveled and sticking up in multiple places.
“For Prom. You know the thing happening in two weeks? The one where you’re one of the candidates for Prom King?” As soon as she said prom, Tony’s face fell. Was it really that time of the year? Sure he was caught up in his project, but for him to forget prom? Janet and he had been planning their prom night since… since when? A long time.
Tony made a pitiful whine as he dropped onto his side. “Jaaaan, I look like a naked mole rat. Everyone is going to laugh at me. Genius, billionaire, playboy, mole rat philanthropist.” He dropped his face into his pillow.
“He has a what?” Sam’s eyebrows drew down.
“Jan! What are you doing here?!”
“Really?” He asked muffled in his pillow.
“No. It’s not Tony’s fault. I just went over there without telling him and…”
He set it down gently with a cough. “Well, not in words. He slammed the door in my face then went on lockdown. Pretty much a no.”
“Oh hun. It’s not that bad. Maybe we can just use a marker to fill them back in,” she cooed placing a hand on his head.
“I’m gonna ask him out again,” Steve said clenching his fists. “I just need to go about it in a better way.”
“Um,” he started.
“Was that a permanent marker?”
“Jarvis! Seal the doors! Only allow Jan in!” Tony ran into his room to promptly hide under the covers. “I can’t let Steve see me like this.” He blushed in his humiliation. He had just slammed a door in his crush’s face, who had been asking him to prom. Tony’s day had gotten a lot worse.
“I knew it was a bad idea. Damn Nat for trying to convince me.” He left the tower dragging the teddy bear behind him in defeat. Any who saw him wondered who hurt Steve enough to make him look like a wounded puppy. Sam wondered the same thing when he visited Steve’s room an hour after he got back.
“Well a doll of you.”
“Love?” Another voice piped in. Steve and Sam whipped around to see Natasha standing at the door with a knowing look on her face. “I keep telling you, Rogers.”
“Yeah. It can’t be that hard.”
A light smile dawns on Wanda’s face. “Thank you,” she says. Then, after a pause, “That’s not all there is?”
“It was still these hands,” Bucky says, lifting them. His new metal one glints in the light. Steve can recognize it’s made of vibranium. “He will never be unable to see the blood in them. And I will never be able to completely wash it away.”
“Yes,” Steve says without a doubt. It’ll be good ‒ Tony needs people around him, to stop loneliness from eating him alive, and Steve knows he doesn’t feel resentment towards Wanda either. He may even be sorry for locking her in the facility.
“Who made him a new arm?” Tony suddenly says. He’s come forward, eyeing Bucky’s arm warily because it’s attached to the killer of his parents, but clearly impressed. Bucky puts his arm behind his back like a child.
Steve tries to lift up Tony's shirt to see the damage, but Tony's quick hand grabs Steve's wrist. His eyes spit fire at Steve.
He doesn’t realize he’s crying until the phone starts ringing again.
Lisa-Marie is back, calling to Steve, “Captain Rogers! Let me show you to your chambers.”
Shuri just smiles walking past them towards the estate, Bucky and T’Challa hesitantly following her.
“Pardon?”
It’s Bucky, shuffling past them to the fridge. Both Steve and Tony take a step backwards. Tony starts to rub his neck, looking at anything else but Steve.
”Hmm,” Tony mumbles. The corners of his mouth turn upwards. A content smile. ”Maybe I love you a little, too.”
“T’Challa has a job for me,” Steve hears Shuri answer to Bucky when he asks her why she’s still here. “But I thought I’d first spend a couple of days here. Just out of curiosity.”
“Stark,” Bucky grunts, nodding at Tony. He looks at Wanda as well, but can’t conjure up her name. Then, his gaze returns to Steve, quietly signaling something like
A breath of utter relief escapes Steve's lips. He stumbles backwards until he's sitting on the bed.
“I think so,” Steve answers even more quietly.
With a snap of his fingers, Tony had turned Thanos and his army to dust.
How to get in contact with Tony has established itself as the problem. They can’t just march Wanda into the facility. They do trust Tony to take her in and take care of her. They trust him to hide her so that no one will know her location, but there are two things they have to take into account: the fact there could be someone who’s not on their side ‒ they’re all three wanted criminals, after all ‒ and that Steve, well, couldn’t handle facing Tony, despite the ache in his chest.
”Barton… I don't know. And I think you know better where Natasha is, don't you?”
“Why not?” Steve says, taking the coffee. “Maybe he needs some superhero friends his age.”
“Well,” Steve chuckles, “It’s a small world.”
Steve chuckles. The fact that Shuri had made Bucky a perfectly operable arm seemed to bug Tony somehow. When Bucky had mentioned to Steve how light his new arm was compared to the one HYDRA had given him, Tony had suddenly been there, offering to make the arm heavier.
Right. That Strange, again.
”How much did you hear?” Steve asks, closing his eyes. He can't stand to look at another ghost.
The words ‘precious best pal Barnes’ come out as venomous spits.
“I don’t know why I called you,” Tony says before Steve can get a word in. Tony’s voice is rushed; fast and laced with anxiety. There’s nothing Steve wants to do more than appear on his side, wrap an arm around his shoulders, soothe him, let him know everything will be alright. “I honestly don’t know. What I know, is that I can’t stop thinking about you.”
One evening, Steve sits in his room, holding the time GPS in his hand.
There’s no use for him here. Sure, Wakanda is an excellent hiding place, perhaps the best, secluded and safe, but it’s not Steve’s place to be.
”I need to go. I need to think,” Tony mutters, carding his fingers through his already messy hair.
Tony leaves. Exhaling, Steve leans against the counter, staring at the cup of coffee Tony left behind. It’s Captain America mug, a gift from Maria Hill, if Steve recalls correctly.
“Peggy,” they both finish, then laugh.
“I hurt him, Sam,” Steve says and his voice cracks.
Alone. Lonely. One letter away from lovely.
But Steve is ready to sacrifice himself.
“I can still make it better,” Tony had said, glaring at the graceful arm.
Peter had felt like death incarnate after his big fight with Electro.
Steve went back to his room at a quicker pace as he remembered how hunger felt clutching and twisting at one’s stomach.
With a tight throat, and all the love in his heart, Wade replied, “With you? I’d go anywhere…”
“Where are you meeting him?” Tony asked, peering at his lap.
Tony strode straight to Bruce’s lab and went through the door like a man on a mission. Steve was not there but Bruce and Mary were huddled together at a holo-screen, looking at readings.
He pulled on his mask and walked out to the launch pad. He jumped off it without looking back.
“Uh, not long, I think it started at our wedding,” Steve replied.
Steve sat next to him and murmured, “How are you?”
“Friday, baby please, Mr. Wilson is my father,” Wade stated. “Please, call me ‘Dumb Ass’.”
Steve was originally going to make himself a sandwich but the sight of the Iron Man figure stole his hunger. He leaned against the counter and watched Peter.
He glanced up at Natasha but she was unreadable as she usually was.
Peter glanced down at his hands with a flush. He had wrapped both his hands around one of Wade’s unconsciously and locked them together with doubly carded fingers. He didn’t let go of Wade and Wade lightly squeezed his hand and smiled sweetly at Peter. Peter smiled back, knowing his face was an open book, portraying to MJ how much he loved this man.
The white eyes of Wade’s mask narrowed. He’d always wanted to ask how Wade did that but he also felt like it was an answer he did not want to know. Wade suspiciously stated, “You may be an Avenger BUT you’re not a Stark employee and it is impossible to break into the fair. I know, I’ve tried. Stark hires the best security every year to protect his people.”
Thor praised the bacon beast and wanted to get a hunting party together to find it. Tony was trying to explain they could not hunt for the domestic pig but got a glint in his eyes as he began to talk about the wild pigs in the southern part of the country. Steve ignored their conversation and hoped nothing ridiculous will come of it.
Tony banged on the wall and screamed for Steve to let him in, but Steve ignored his cries. He pressed his forehead against the wall with gritted teeth and prayed Tony would change his mind tomorrow night.
“Oh God, Steve, go. Forget everything I just said. Go now!” Tony gasped, his voice laced with panic. The rest of the team followed their eyes and spotted Peter. Bruce was the closest to him and he hurried over to Peter and Mary.
Steve understood immediately and winced. He lightly covered Tony’s fists with both of his hands and whispered, “Who told you? Bruce? Or Jarvis?”
“What is it?” Steve asked. Bruce also looked questionably at Tony.
“Everything okay?” Tony asked, concerned by the wild look in Bucky’s eyes.
His eyes flickered open and…his heart stopped –
“Jeez, Stevie! A guy can only handle so much bravado! You take on too much!” Bucky sighed and continued, “But seriously, I love you, punk…” Bucky leaned into his side and ran the tip of his fingers over Steve’s implant. The unfairness of it all filled him with grief.
The last couple of days had gone by similarly. Tony would come across Steve and pull him away for a quick kiss. Or he’d privately whisper endearments to him when no one else could hear. At night, they’d spend more time together in the secret embrace of the forest…but that time was dwindling to an end.
The symbiote glanced at Wade and then turned back to Brock. It didn’t take long to make its decision. The SHIELD agents yelled in startled exclamation as the symbiote jumped onto their detainee. Venom took form wrapped around Brock and then easily knocked aside the agents and hissed at the gathered superheroes.
“I’ll throw a pillow at you,” Tony threatened.
“I love you,” Steve murmured into Tony’s scalp.
“J-!” Tony squeaked, his emotions threatened to overcome him as relief that Steve was maybe still alive and worry about what was
Bucky’s dropped his gaze and peered at his hands with an unreadable expression.
This chapter is a little shorter than usual because I couldn't help but leave ya'll with this one last cliffhanger! What can I say, I like to leave ya'll hanging! :D But, this is almost done! I will be wrapping up the story soon and everyone will live fluffly ever after, I promise! <3
Tony spared Steve once last glance before stepping onto stage and his fiancé graced him with a big, happy smile in the parting.
Tony grasped his hand and led him the rest of the way to their bedroom. Once in the room, Tony spun back around and wound his arms around Steve.
Watching from the shadows, Jarvis’s systems experienced an odd fluctuation. The entire suit flickered as its energy was lost for a moment. The AI ran an intensive system’s check but everything came back as green.
“Are you here about my brother?” The older man asked.
He had raced there after the battle and begged two women to get off it, quickly explaining his need for it. They ecstatically relinquished the bench to him and hovered nearby to witness his first meeting with his soulmate. He ignored them in favor of wiping his sweaty palms on his trousers. Because of the battle, he felt completely unprepared for his mate.
“No, that’s not what I meant! I –!” Tony sighed heavily and then murmured, “You can do that for now, but I want…” Tony paused and then said, “I want you to – to gather information!”
Tony couldn’t wait to see how far down that blush could go.
Steve nodded and bit down on his tongue to not give away any emotion to Bruce. He murmured, “Thank you,” and left.
Steve kept walking, lost in his thoughts about Tony’s location, when he saw him.
Steve smiled sadly at her and replied, “You did not have to be.”
Unsurprisingly, the charges against Steve were dropped and Tyler was arrest for attempted murder and a number of other charges, including falsely accusing Steve.
Their lips parted but held each other close, looking into one another’s eyes with heightened emotions.
Steve flinched and turned to see Natasha standing at the elevator with her arms crossed over her chest. Her face was unreadable but her eyes were trained on Bucky.
“I know,” Tony whispered, burying his face deeper into Peter’s scalp. “…I know.”
“I can feed myself,” Peter murmured.
It was as if…
Once satisfied with the small fire, Steve stood and unbuckled his pants. He froze with both ends of his belt in hand when Sneaky seemingly materialized out of thin air. The robot had said it had advanced stealth technology but Steve hadn’t truly appreciated how advanced it was until that moment.
Tony chuckled and stated, “I always wondered why he called you ‘Papa.’ It’s for Pops? Why not Dad?”
Apparently, when Tony dropped his phone, it had taken one last picture.
“Sir, I must object. You are in no condition to –.”
As if he were projecting his thoughts, it was that moment that Tony charged into the apartment.
The guy was reviewing several theories. The first two or three minutes were dedicated to the first theory, that he was Tony Stark’s clone. He compared photos of Peter and Tony and debunked it, Peter after all, inherited some of his mother’s features.
He felt nauseous, like he was going to vomit his very organs. He couldn’t remember the last time he felt this sick. In the dream world, he usually only felt things he conjured up things for, like if he wanted to feel the heat of Tony’s skin, his memory would fashion together something for him.
him, Steve.”
“That will anger him,” James gasped like he was being strangled. He let go of Steve and fell into the wall. Steve staggered to the side and caught the opposite wall. His concerned focus was entirely on James.
Steve waited, biting down on his lip.
Friday helped lead Peter to an empty room on the next floor. It was a guest room Tony usually provided for his business partners. The lights turned on as soon as they entered. The room was simple by his dad’s standards with a king-sized bed, a small kitchen, eating area, and sitting area with a full entertainment system.
“What, are you going to call me an idiot too?” Tony snapped.
The traitorous sun eventually rose and he knew he was going to have to face the day. When he smelt the coffee, he knew Steve was up.
, baby boy,” Wade purred in answering.
“It is August 16th,” Tony stated, striding up to his bedside and peering down at Peter
Tony passed out again as they removed him from the suit.
Tony had invited everyone to join in on the even, including Thor, and they were all delightfully surprised but elated to hear back from their ally. He would come.
Bruce silently cleaned up after himself and then cleaned up the small puddle of morphine on the floor. By the time he was done, Tony was sleeping. Peter was still awake and was staring at Tony with an unreadable expression.
“I’d do anything for you, babe, even take a tap dancing class.”
Steve nodded and said, “The 107
Steve leaned into Bucky’s side, staring sadly at his implant, and sighed, “Then we could settle down in the same townhouse and be neighbors. Our kids could grow up together.”
It was all Steve had ever wanted until…until he started to date Tony.
Pepper, meanwhile, ran at the suit as it charged her a second time and collided with it midair. She brought it down with a single punch. She forced one of her glowing hands through the suit and slid her arm into the armored arm. She faced Kilian with a taunting smirk and Kilian changed directions and charged her with a growl.
-sin and I noticed him checking out a certain SHIELD Director’s ass at the end of the ceremony.”
“We’re all okay…scared but fine,” Howard replied with a heavy sigh. He sat down and leaned into his head as he whispered, “You were right, Peggy. All those years ago I didn’t listen and it almost cost me
Thanks for reading! :)
“I am going in with James,” Natasha stated firmly before Tony could state otherwise. She crossed her arms over her chest and glared at them, looking for anyone to challenge her.
Yet, the dream left the shadow of an impression of Tony’s lips against his.
“Furthest thing from it, babe,” Tony replied. He reached out to Steve and said, “Come to bed, I’m lonely.”`
Eventually, over an hour had passed and Steve’s voice dwindled too. The silence fell upon them again but it did not feel as oppressive as before.
In a matter of seconds, Chewie had somehow managed to cross several hundred feet, block the bullets with the shield on his back, and grab the girl from Solo’s hold. His backpack was made out of cheap material and had torn under the pressure of the high powered shots. Three distinct holes revealed the red, white, and blue shield beneath. Tony’s eyes were glued to the two points visible of the star and, in his ear, Jarvis murmured, “It is an 89.3% match now, Sir.”
Cable paused in what he was doing and looked at Steve over his shoulder with his red, glowing eye. He murmured, “I will need help with the Goblin and I know your abilities will be more than enough to assist. But…when I returned to the future and saw how broken you were over Stark…I knew you deserved the chance at revenge as well.” Cable fully turned to him and said, “I can return you to the future and I can handle this if you prefer…”
“He stole one of the scientists’ lab coasts,” Coulson sighed in explanation. “He’s somewhere in the city. Can you help us in the search?”
Yawning heavily, Steve locked the door behind him and went straight to the wood-burning stove, kicking off his shoes as he did. There was a small stack of wood next to it and he tossed a fresh piece in and poked at the embers to get a fire started and the room warmed up.
He fled the room but he felt like his body was anchored to Steve and there was a pull on his heart, trying to bring him back to Steve’s side. He hadn’t gone so far from Steve’s side since he came out of surgery but Thor was there and he clearly came there to speak to one of them.
By their glances at Clint, he guessed the archer was going to be their next victim in the drink creations.
The reporter did not do as Steve asked and persisted, “So are you denying that you are gay? You never made an official statement, only Tony Stark did. Are you trying to say Mr. Stark’s statement and those photos of you and Tony Stark are falsified??”
A car suddenly flew into the screen and slammed into a tree, making all of them jump.
Sam was wordlessly driving them out of the city and to an empty warehouse Natasha suggested for them to get all they could out of Sitwell and then form a plan of attack.
Natasha gifted Peter with a tiny karate uniform.
He’d gotten Pepper and injected her with Extremis…he tried to go after Peter too but his fiancé was able to stop the super soldiers sent after him, at a great price.
“You wouldn’t,” Tony gasped, beyond scandalized.
Steve returned to Tony’s side but replied to Peter, “We can whip up whatever you’d like or raid a pantry for a quick bite.”
Tony whispered, “No, that’s a lie…I’m far from fine. How can I be fine when my husband is trapped within a symbiote and on SHIELD’s top kill list? And Peter…I thought I was screwed up after nearly dying in the void after Loki’s attack but this…God…
“Yes – no, Steve…I’m sorry,” Tony gasped, with his face still buried in the juncture of Steve’s neck. “
Natasha shivered. She’d never say such words aloud out of fear for her own life. The Academy did not take such thoughts lightly.
“They have strawberry,” Steve murmured excitedly after quickly scanning the available flavors. “You haven’t tried strawberry yet!”
“Wade this is real.”
“Like you’re going to devour me,” Tony whispered huskily. He rose out of the chair and loomed over Steve.
“Papa!” Peter gasped, just noticing him.
“I am
Feeling secure, he continued to scroll through the movies until he came to a stop at a familiar title.
“Then we will hang it with the rest,” Tony stated. “And everytime I see you looking at it, I am going to make you happy until just looking at it reminds you of that and makes you happy.”
“It does not matter you still can’t go. Kilian might be there and—,”Tony began to say as a suit landed behind him.
Natasha did not know how she felt about that if it were the case. She grew up and trained with the belief that she would kill her mate as soon as she met him. But now she had him and she began to…
It exhausted them so that they had slept through their alarm and Jarvis’s calls. Bruce had to shake them awake. They scrambled to get their clothes on, laughing as their bodies continued to thrum with excess energy from their relief and joy. They stole quick kisses whenever they got close enough in their readying.
“Maybe you’ll get a nice tan out of this?” Wade murmured, sitting himself up with Peter.
. I only regret not knowing you thought this way…Everything you just said, I do not see that when I look at you. I’ve never see it that way.
“Yes, and I want you on your best behavior,” Steve stated, crossing his arms over his chest.
“Let’s go out today,” Steve murmured thoughtfully.
Steve lay in a hospital bed with his son nestled into his side, sleeping soundly. Tony sat in the chair by the bed, gripping Steve’s hand tightly and the rest of the team surrounded the bed in an odd half circle. Clint leaned on Tony’s chair twirling the remote in his hand. Natasha stood half a foot from him with her arms crossed over her chest and her gaze shifting from the door and Steve repeatedly. At the foot of the bed, stood Thor, gripping his hammer and eyeing Steve’s injuries critically. On the other side of the bed sat Dr. Banner, sitting in the only other chair, looking haggard and sad.
Peter had to watch the video five times before he finally was able to absorb the full context within.
If he was awake and in New York that meant Tony was somewhere nearby.
He was fighting a battle he saw no way of winning and it was against his best friend, a man he thought dead and what made it worse was the fact that Bucky had shot Tony.
Tony had no clever reply to that. Truthfully, he’d been avoiding Steve, wanting to avoid a fight or a
Tony merely snorted in response to the Winter Soldier’s threatening tone.
"He'll be fine, Steve," Sam assured him.
Tony shook his head and murmured to Steve, “Or you could have, beloved…”
Coulson felt as if the world suddenly spun off its axis. Last month he dealt with the Norse God of Thunder who, in actuality, resided from another world. Now he did not find Cap’s tomb but…but the place where Cap
Steve was exerting too much energy so Sam had to help him out of the ship after they landed. Clint ran ahead of all of them and was already inside when he reached the ground.
“You too,” Steve replied immediately.
“Tis a trap,” Thor grimly stated, getting to his feet with an air of malice.
The Commandos laughed at them and teased Jim about his messy hair but Tony didn’t really listen. He was reminded of Bucky’s early death and the sad melancholy that accompanied this fact felt like it weighed heavier on his shoulders.
Fury turned to Wade and growled, “Did you fucking time travel,
Wade chuckled and murmured, “It’s getting late, we can go to bed, screw around, and then fall asleep cuddling in our filth.”
Howard unhappily looked down at the failed formulas he worked on the night before and he once again darkly wondered what the future held for Howard and, eventually, the family he’d have.
Tony watched it all with a clenched jaw and his tight grip on Steve’s shoulder remained constant.
Steve held Tony close and helped him stay upright when the bright light disappeared and left them staggering.
“James,” Natasha whispered, her fear written clearly across her face.
He fell to the ground and picked up the paper…only to find it attached to a notebook.
“S-Steve?” Pepper asked, her voice shaking. "Oh, I'm in Tony's armor... How-?...
“Thank you, Jarvis,” Steve whispered, gratitude seeped into the words but not his posture. He was tense, unable to accept the analogy.
And by the Peter's pulse rose upon that simple utterance, he knew he was interested in the man too.
There was press around the Tower too and a couple of helicopters from the local news stations elected to film the Tower instead of traffic today. Friday informed him that his suit up was caught on camera.
Tony was an extremely smart boy and had already skipped ahead by two grades in school by age eleven. Tony loved discussing the new things he learned and, in the dreamscape, he would recreate the workshop his father had given to him. It was small but filled with dismembered computers, large crate of hand-me-down tools, and was just so uniquely Tony.
A couple photos were sitting upright on the dresser. He made a beeline to them before he could start second guessing himself again. The largest picture was of the Avengers. It was of their final meeting, before Thor departed, all of them were in high spirits and smiling widely. It had been taken a week after Tony and Steve’s affair began and Steve and Tony had their arms wrapped around each other’s waists and were leaning into each other in the middle of the group.
Which was why he felt such trepidation in Peter’s suggestion.
“Don’t put that back in you!” Steve gasped, aghast. He reached toward the reactor as if to stop Tony.
Tony looked up from his implant to Bruce and his smile expanded. He held up his arm and explained, “I officially have one month left.”
Tony smirked and grasped Steve’s chin. He pulled Steve’s face in so they were only centimeters apart and whispered, “Baby, the way I dance, you would’ve never seen it in a reputable dance hall today, nonetheless one in the forties.”
“Crap,” Tony hissed, jolting up beside Steve.
Steve looked from his soulmate’s flight path and then the portal and felt his stomach drop.
A moment later, there was pounding on the door and Fury demanding, “Stark?? Rogers?? What the hell is going on in there??”
I am going to mark this series as complete but maybe one day I will write another fic with Peter as a part of the Avengers and fighting the Goblin but, as of right now, I do not have any kind of plot for that story... Subscribe to me or this series just in case if you're interested (maybe it will happen or maybe it won't, only the future will tell)! ;)
So this chapter will begin with Steve's POV and end with Peter's! Enjoy! :)
Steve didn’t want Tony out of his sight and he tightened his hold on Tony to nonverbally show his displeasure.
“I’m almost there,” Steve replied, moving his hips to increase the friction between them.
Steve’s eyes widened and he stared at Natasha in shock. Steve’s heart began to beat furiously in his chest and he blindly reached for Tony’s hand.
Bucky froze in place and his cursing came to an immediate stop as the projection expanded to accompany the new figure into the memory.
Nonetheless, Peter found himself going into the hallway closet where Aunt May had stored their photo albums and the boxes of loose photos. He went to the bottom of the pile and pulled out the beige album.
The street his reading led him to was practically empty. Tony stepped out of the car and called out to his son, “Peter?”
“Tis a battle already lost, my friend,” Thor murmured sadly.
“Steve R…Carter. Steve Carter,” he repeated and the doctor’s eyes narrowed as he heard his hesitancy.
Tony was already sitting at the counter with a cup of coffee. He glared at his husband as he happily got to work and then picked up his tablet to continue his work and ignore the fact that Peter was at Wade’s place because he had spent the night…with Wade…all night…with Wade.
“Why am I here?” Steve gasped.
They were in a different room, not even in Tony’s house anymore.
When the main entry door came into view, Tony was a little disappointed to see it. Steve turned to him and said, “Thank you for joining me. I…I like spending time with you.”
“You can’t do this, Steve,” Tony implored, taking a step toward him. He hissed under his breath so only Steve would hear, “You can’t
“I know…” Tony sighed.
The AI had originally asked Tony to verbally give approval but all he was able to do was grunt. It was a struggle to breathe nonetheless talk. The moving shrapnel in his chest were making his muscles twitch and contract wildly so he was only able to make the shallowest of gasps as he tried to breathe.
In the other bed, Peter and flinging his limbs wildly and Wade was holding him to try to keep him from hurting himself.
!” Steve hissed to the despairingly empty room. Where was he??
“Shut up!” The first agent hissed.
The man hurried away, only to return with his superior, a woman with a scowl and wire rimmed glasses. With her scowl routed firmly in place she stated, “I strongly advise against leaving right now. You were shot twelve times, Captain.”
“Of course,” Steve replied with a chuckle. The robot was nothing like the cold, humorless machines he had read about in fiction. Steve was enjoying it and having fun imagining the environment it may have come from. “And your presence and earlier colorful commentary make me guess you didn’t find Schmidt?”
He looked to helping people to fill the emptiness in his heart instead and Bucky was always two steps behind him.
“And you, Pete?” Steve called over his shoulder as he started to remove the hot dogs from the grill.
Tony was dead because of what Steve did.
Venom surged forward with a shriek and Peter flinched back into Bucky’s arms as Tony screamed, “NOW JARVIS!”
Out of the two of them, Steve should have been able to find someone. His heart was so big and filled with so much care and love that anyone who’d take him would have been the happiest person in the world. He had always imagined Steve meeting a girl with a zeroed out implant and both of them falling in love and starting a family and getting a dog…just living the American dream, despite the odds stacked against them. If anyone could do it, it was Steve. Now he replaced that imagined woman with a man and gone were the kids, gone was the picket fence, and all he saw for Steve was more grief than he deserved.
“You don’t have to apologize, beloved,” Tony whispered. “Especially about this…”
Norman grinned at start and flames licked his lips. He hissed, “Your son is dead and, in his place,
“A server said Tony was flirting with her and she bet she could get his number and she…” Steve paused, hurt just thinking about it, and then said, “I saw him smiling at her the same way he does when he flirts with me and…”
“I’m fine,” Tony sighed but he did not pull his hand out of Bruce’s hold. Bruce glanced up at him and saw Tony staring sadly at Peter.
But his hand was stopped. He was tied down and he was laying on cold cement, not a bed. He opened his eyes and the good feeling went away and he remembered the situation he was in…His soulmate was no longer by his side. She was his target. And Steve…Steve was no longer with him either. He was the property of the Red Skull now, just like the Soldier…
to have a life, right?” Tony teased.
Steve winced as he thought of Solo. Tony got him a good defense but he was still going to get jail time. Steve wished there was something more he could do for his wayward friend. He nodded to Pepper’s question and said, “That was how Tony and I initially met.”
! Leave my boy! Don’t hurt my baby,
“I figured you would want to read up on it. It’s probably a shock to the system right now and understanding it will probably make it easier for you,” Tony said with a shrug.
“Yes,” Tony gasped as he helped Steve up.
. The notion was so spectacular that the Soldier had to step back and sit down on his cot. His limbs were trembling so hard that he could barely sit up nonetheless stand.
“…He’s running?”
“Y-You can get me a new identity? M-Make it so people don’t know I’m Captain America?” Steve gasped.
Steve bumped Tony’s leg with his and murmured, “I…I didn’t hurt your feet much from dancing, did I? Bucky says I got two left feet.”
Barnes flexed his hand and whispered, “The machine. It cannot be moved. It is too large and fragile. If they are still using it on him, he’ll be kept with it…in Washington D.C.”
“…Mary,” Tony stated, drawing both Steve’s and Mary’s eyes to him. He continued, “Mary, I like to think we were once close acquaintances, maybe even friends. You know me. We worked together in building the Cancer Genome Project.” Mary’s lips thinned and Tony eyes flickered as he noted the movement. He continued, his voice strong, “You know I would have no part in what happened in that Hydra lab and know that I would
“Tony –,” Steve suddenly whispered but his throat thankfully sealed as Tony’s fingers brushed against his.
Steve and Bucky locked gazes over Tony’s head and they both wordlessly quickened their paces.
“My pops’ stronger than Thor,” Peter pouted.
“No, thank you,” Wade replied and mentally high-fived himself for being able to slip in some manners instead of vocalizing his voice’s comment.
“Are you a Transformer? Because you’re
Bucky stood, pushed back his hood, and yelled, “EVERYONE GET OUT OF HERE!” The civilians transferred their looks of shock from Steve to Bucky and a few had took out their phones to take some pictures. Bucky snarled then tore a gun from its hidden holster under his arm and shot the ceiling a few times.
The Red Skull crossed his arms over his chest and glared at them. The monster shook his head and tutted, “Always destroying my plans, Captain.”
Steve wanted to break free from Cable’s grip and run down the highway to Tony all over again. The temptation was real and there and the only thing holding him back were Cable’s words.
“Who are you?” Tony asked, crossing his arms over his chest. “And who do you work for?”
He retained Venom’s height but Venom shaped them with a slicker body similar to Peter’s. He had a full body suit that did not expose an inch of skin and was Venom’s pure black hide. A white spider clutched his chest, marking Peter with the symbol he always associated his powers with. The only other color in his black suit was the white of his oval, glass eyes. He looked like an adult, like the superhero he always thought he would grow up to be.
, are you the ‘intricate matters’ Tony said he was working on? It all makes so much sense… And…You’ve been here all this time? For the last couple of weeks?”
Peter broke away from his uncle before he could hear another word. He ran blindly away from him. He would not let himself think about what anything that happened in the last few minutes could mean. He ran toward the source of the explosion only thinking of Pops and reaching him.
Everyone backed off Venom immediately with the exception of the Hulk. The Hulk continued his fight with Venom and did not even seem to notice Steve was there.
“Good night, Captain Rogers,” Tony said, his fingers caressing the side of Steve’s arm.
This time it was much more gentler, a promise of the sweet times to come.
“I had struck the Captain’s shield with Mjölnir in the fight,” Thor stated. Tony nodded, remembering the blast of air that had knocked him off his feet. Thor continued, “But I had not struck the Captain’s shield when I first came to Midgard. How had my hammer woken the Captain the first time?”
Peter was sitting on the couch in the living room when they entered the room. His son looked up at them with a knowing grin but forwent teasing them. He folded his arms behind his head and loftily said, “My and Eddie’s hypothesis is correct.”
After a beat of silence, Tony said, “For once I’m extremely grateful for our celebrity. No normal couple would’ve been allowed to foster a kid, no question…”
Tony bit down on his lip and murmured, “We should probably go to bed.”
“…Or I can help?”
He tore his eyes from the window and instinctually ran to the lab.
“What about Tony?” Steve demanded. The Goblin could be approaching him right now.
He got off the couch and escaped to his lab, hoping to find solace there.
Tony could feel his resolve crumbling. Steve never spoke to him like this before…He never begged, dragging out “
His father was still silent which was a bad sign and Peter dared not to look at him to see how much this was destroying him.
Tony snorted and settle back on to the pillow with a smile on his face. He was starting to settle down but then he could hear the faint sound of music coming from Peter’s room. His smile expanded into a face splitting grin and he proudly whispered, “Peter likes Classic Rock.”
His joy doubled as Steve took his place beside him and pressed his hip against Tony’s. Would this overjoyed reaction always be like this? He didn't think he would ever not be grateful to not have Steve back.
“Probably, because they were right next to my tent…”
Ben knelt in front of them and enveloped his arm around Steve’s shoulders and placed a hand on the side of Peter’s face. Steve wrapped his free arm around Ben and pulled him tightly against him, burying his face in Ben’s neck. Ben’s cologne was sharp, nothing like Tony’s. Tony’s was brisk with a spicy hint but it was always subdued by the scent of motor oil and coffee.
Tony sat across from them and Peter glanced nervously at his dad, wondering what was going on in his mind.
“Yeah…I'm sticking with the Commandos,” Tony dryly murmured to his father and Steve grinned triumphantly at Howard. Howard melodramatically shook his head and sulked off. Tony had to hold in his laughter at the sight.
“…Peter,” Tony whispered.
Peter’s shoulders fell and all his weak denials crumbled away from him like a landslide.
When Peter woke, he found Wade’s limbs were wrapped around Peter like an octopus and his face was buried in Peter’s hair. He was still asleep and breathing evenly, his exhales moving Peter’s hair with every breath. Peter shifted closer to Wade and the older man sighed contently. Peter smiled and pressed his face into Wade’s neck. He inhaled deeply and decided he liked the way Wade smelt. His natural smell was now stronger having sweat and slept in it. Peter slowly traced his nose along Wade’s neck, enjoying his boyfriend’s natural musk.
He stared at her and silence grew between them.
“Ish not hurted,” Peter assured them then he tore the thick cushion in half and dropped the larger of the two.
“Thanks, sweetheart,” Steve murmured,
A beat of silence finally passed between them as they both processed what the mad time traveler had said.
When Tony pulled away, Steve’s thoughts escaped him on a rush of that content warm air, saying, “I love you so much.”
The Hydra soldiers fired immediately and Steve ducked his head down, bringing his face over Tony’s with centimeters to spare. Their breaths intermingled in hot gusts and all Steve could think about was the sensation on his lips from where Tony’s lips had touched his just seconds ago. He could feel blood rushing to his cheeks but could not look away from Tony’s piercing gaze.
“Cut the sarcasm J and open the damn door” Tony said with a pleased voice, because Jarvis and sarcasm always made his day or night.
Pepper was the one that found him. She had decided to come to him, since he didn’t answer any of her calls. Which yeah, he had done plenty of times before, but he always called back when she hit the 10th call, so Pepper knew he was okay. If he truly was too busy he got Jarvis to do it, but it still calmed her nerves that something had happened. From there Pepper usually visited him after a day or an hour varying on how pressing the matter was with her I-am- disapproving -of-you face. A face Tony hated, because he never could figure out what it was he had done wrong to deserve that face.
“I wasn’t you. It was HYDRA, using you,” Steve says sternly. He’s not going to let Bucky feel bad about this. If he must, he’s going to spend the rest of his life reminding Bucky ‒ and Tony ‒ that Bucky wasn’t at fault.
”Tony,” Steve whispers.
Instead, Fury had ran off to consult Carol Danvers. And maybe she could find the Guardians and Thor should go with them, and they could deal with Thanos,
Throwing one last scrutinizing look at Steve, Natasha lets it go. Probably thinks he's thinking about Bucky, but Steve's mind chants
Thanos isn't their problem. Thanos is the problem of the entire universe. There are three infinity stones on Earth. Three too much.
Maybe Tony would start to hate him again. That would serve Steve right, messing with time, with Tony's life.
“He came to visit us, you know,” says Clint as they’re on their way to his farm. Sam is piloting the ship, humming to himself to fill the quiet. Wanda is dozing off, and Clint had been inspecting his arrows, brow furrowed, for the past half an hour.
Steve catches them arguing playfully one morning when he walks into the kitchen area.
Steve does something brave. He reaches to place his hand on Tony’s cheek, slowly and gently, seeking consent in Tony’s eyes. Tony doesn’t flinch away, he stares at Steve, transfixed.
Tony doesn’t answer. He takes deep breaths, making Steve grow worried. What if this is causing him an anxiety attack?
Steve hates his own selfishness.
Peggy was crying silently. Steve hated that he did that to her: went into the ice and came back as a different man, told her he loved another.
”Huh.”
Bucky hauls her on his shoulder. Shuri lets out a surprised squeal that turns into laughter. Bucky starts to walk away, taking her with him. Before following them, Wanda lays one last glance at Tony.
“I don’t know,” Steve admits. He only wishes Tony would call, so he glances at the phone again. Sam notices, and rolls his eyes.
This isn’t it, at Steve so happy he could burst.
“Good to see you, Steve,” he mutters, patting Steve’s back.
It’s a long way to go, but Steve thinks it’s possible.
”Absolutely fine,” Steve brushes it off, ”What did Pepper want?”
“No,” Steve repeats, “I really needed to hear your voice.”
“Of course she did,” Tony says, “She’s Shuri. She can do anything, including make a new arm for the former Winter Soldier.”
After watching the sunset in Wakanda, Steve ponders for a moment. Then, he requests to see T’Challa. The prince ‒ the
Peggy opened her mouth, once, twice. Her eyes glistened, that beautiful face twisted in the expression of sympathy and heartbreak for Steve. She was at loss of words.
Tony's hands are underneath Steve's shirt, thumbs running over his abs. And Steve’s hands - they're
The threat isn't over and it had been hard for Steve to remain vague enough, to not to reveal the truth to anyone. If Fury had found out, he'd for sure made sure that Steve returned to where he came from.
”Don't leave me,” Tony says next, collapsing against Steve. ”I like you here. Don't leave me.”
He doesn’t know what to say. He’s freezing, feeling colder than in Siberia, colder than when he was sleeping in the ice for 70 years.
Tony doesn't seem to even see him.
“Hey,” Sharon says, punching his arm gently, “Stop thanking me! I want to help. And don’t worry ‒ I’m good at this. SHIELD will never know.”
”I asked: What's for dinner?”
As Steve is scrutinizing Bucky, Bucky is watching over Steve’s shoulder instead, eyes calculating, mouth twitching.
“Are you trying to go see Vision again?” Tony continues. So this isn’t a one time thing.
“I don’t know. She seems like a kind woman,” Steve replies.
”Carol… Carol is a friend of Fury's,” Steve explains, pulling Tony closer to him. Tony comes willingly, landing on Steve's lap.
“Tomorrow,” Tony promises, nodding at her.
”Um,” Steve mumbles, rubbing the back of his head. He hadn't known Carol well, but had missed her as much as the others. She looks exactly the same as the day she appeared in the Avengers facility with wild eyes, demanding to know where Nick Fury was.
There’s no use for him here ‒ even Bucky is deep asleep, resembling dead more than alive. He’s alone. He would be alone anywhere else too, but what was he going to do, just sit and sketch while T’Challa’s people kept him fed and comfortable?
”Tony,” Steve says solemnly. He can't hold it anymore. Tony needs to know the truth about his parents and Bucky.
“Time,” Bucky huffs, “Did you ever see this coming? Us two, lost in time? We’ve lost 70 years, Steve.”
But saying what he felt to Peggy – that would've been too much.
Just a nightmare, not real. Tony is here. Tony's heart beats and Steve can even pretend it's for him.
he thinks, tracing the bracelet with his fingers. He stares at it and sees Tony, speeding to the compound.
When the door opens, Steve runs. Tony looks startled, baffled, and the look on his face makes Steve slow down.
This is where he finally breaks down. When Tony had been taken from him, he had wanted to scream, to rave, but instead he had went on. Numb.
“Christ…” Steve huffs again.
When Nat has gone to her room, Steve takes a shower and returns to the workshop where he finds Tony working as hard as ever, quietly muttering things to the bots.
How would she react if she knew the truth?
“You fought Natasha ‒ do you hate her guts?”
”Sir, Agent Romanoff has just entered the building,” Jarvis announces.
Steve stays silent. He actually has no idea where Nat is right now. He ought to text her.
room – and draws. It's the only way to get the images out of his mind. The friends and allies he left behind. He sketches a picture of Stormbreaker, recalling how powerful he had felt wielding it.
