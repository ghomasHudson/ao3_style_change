Tony turned the radio on too loud, and they drove home, neither one speaking a word as the road unspooled behind them. Steve just watched the scenery pass by. They were the same tall pines and close, lush, green underbrush as when they came up, but it didn’t seem as magical now. Now it seemed darker, scarier, more sinister, and he was glad when it started to recede. When the city started to reassert itself. When the billboards popped up, and the first warehouses came into view. When the skyscrapers showed up on the horizon. The traffic got worse. It was what he was used to. It was home.
“There’s still chicken from last night,” Steve said, and Tony closed his eyes.  “Or would you rather do something else?”
He nodded again, thoughts of Steve--worried, scared thoughts, in spite of what Sam said--taking over everything else. “Okay,” he said. “I’m sorry, but I really do need to get over there.”
As if only waiting for the command, Steve bent his head, capturing Tony’s mouth with his own. He worked the knot with dexterous ease and slid the tie from around Tony’s neck just as they reached the bed and tumbled down onto it. Steve punched out a breath as Tony fell on top of him, but it was okay because Tony’s mouth was there. Tony was breathing into him, giving him his own breath even while stealing more, a delicious give and take that grew more heated as Tony rolled his hips against Steve’s.
“No, I don’t,” Tony said.  “I think you’re doing what you need to do.  If that means we don’t ever discuss it, then we never discuss it.  I don’t care.
Howard raised an eyebrow, and Tony’s stomach clenched. That look was too familiar. He had seen it too many times. Including in the mirror. “You’d better shut your mouth, son. Right now. You’re skating on thin ice.”
Tony nodded. Her words and soothing way calmed him more than he thought possible, but he still wanted to get in there. He still wanted--needed--to see him. But he needed to take care of one tiny detail first. One tiny, monumental detail.
Steve drew in a breath and let it out.  An air of happiness, of contentment settled around him.  Tony wrapped himself up in it, just like he wrapped himself up in Steve’s arms every night.
Steve hugged him one more time, then retreated back down the hallway. His mind was a swirling tempest, throwing up images of his mother, Tony, Jonathon Juniper, Howard Stark, even his own father, dredging them up from the pits of his subconscious where they slumbered ninety-nine percent of the time, only coming out when he was in intense pain. When he was at his lowest.
Okay, we're getting there now, I promise! Next chapter will probably be up next week. Thank you for reading, I really do just love you all so much!!
Steve shifted under his hand, made an unintelligible sound-- “Huzzzit?”--that was undoubtedly a question.  Tony was afraid to answer it.  Afraid not to.
--Steve had felt with Morgan grew, as he watched her lead Dodger down the hallway, then just kept growing when Tony came toward him, put his arm around his neck, and pulled him in for a kiss. It was brief, friendly, and sweet. Steve’s heart thumped crazily in his chest.
Tony sat up a little straighter, pulled Steve’s leather jacket aside--but just barely.  He didn’t want to relinquish that warmth, that comfort completely--and took the paper in his hand.
He’d been standing out here for five minutes. It wasn’t cold, but there was a chill in the air now that hadn’t been there even two weeks ago that said fall was on the way. In California, he wouldn’t be feeling that chill at all. Not really, anyway. Not like here. He wasn’t sure if that made him feel better or worse about it. He wasn’t sure if he relished that change in temperature or hated it. Both, maybe. A little of both. But one thing was for sure, it was definitely there, that chill. And for a moment, a brief, frightening moment, he wondered if he was really only feeling it because he was here, standing in front of this door instead of back in his hotel room with Pepper. He’d be working at the desk now, if he was. She would probably be down in the gym, or maybe at the pool. She would come back in later, and they’d go over some more paperwork while they ate their room-service dinner, then make a couple calls, then crawl into bed together. They would probably have sex--they usually did, anyway--then they’d go to sleep, and the whole business would happen again in the morning. They had a routine, he and Pepper. It was a good one. A quiet, peaceful, predictable one. He liked it. He liked the stability of it. He needed it. He needed her.
He drew Steve into his arms and kissed him. “It really is okay, baby,” he said. “I do understand. It’s not your fault. Hell, it’s not Carlos’s fault either. I’ve had to swerve to avoid hitting a kid on a longboard fifty times. Guess I’m lucky there’s never been another car close to me before.”
They gave off a strong, comforting parent-vibe.  They had always acted almost like parental figures to Steve and Tony, as well.  Tony liked that, and was glad it hadn't changed when Jeff passed away.
Tony held the phone, but he didn’t dial anything yet. He just sat with it in his hand. His tongue stole out and probed the corner of his mouth. There was a small cut there too. A shallow gash over his right eyebrow. His clothes--t-shirt, jeans, leather jacket--were wrinkled and dusty. “What do I say?” he asked, his voice and face both dejected and sad. He looked up at the cop. “What do other people say?”
Steve lay on the floor, his back heaving up and down as he breathed.  His hands moved at his sides, coming up, his left palm flat on the ground, his right curled, but still useful, still helping him rise.
Steve ran a hand through his hair. It was damp with sweat, and his nose wrinkled unconsciously. He usually showered as soon as he got back to the apartment, but this was more important. “I only heard a few words, but it sounds like the boy is staying. At least for a while.”
“They wanted to push him.  See how much he could take.  They wanted to see how far he would go before--”
He got out of the elevator and jogged up the few steps leading to the roof, already yanking at his tie. The whole way home, he had thought of nothing but how the water was going to feel on his overheated skin. How smooth and cool it would be. How
Tony pressed his foot solidly against Steve’s wishing desperately that he could take his hand instead, or climb into his lap and cuddle him.  He’d never gotten the chance to sit in Steve’s lap since they’d been together.  He just realized that.  Before they were an item, he had occasionally thrown himself down on top of him.  Just to get a reaction, of course.  Just to see him nervous, to see that pretty red blush heat up his cheeks and darken his eyes.  But now that he was technically
Steve drug himself up against the headboard, and leaned over to look at the screen in Tony’s hand.  He laughed a little under his breath and laid his head on Tony’s shoulder.  “You finally Googled it,” he said, watching the scaly little creatures wandering here and there, their clawed forelegs held out in front of them.  Even as Steve watched, one rolled abruptly into a ball.
Tony lifted their still-clasped hands and kissed Steve’s knuckles over the red silk. “Oh baby,” he said. “We both know you’ll do it. I know your weakness now. I can get you to say yes.”
“Oh for fuck’s sake, Steve,” Tony muttered, then turned the menu around so Steve could see it, and stabbed his finger at the pumpkin sticker they had slapped onto it. “This, baby,” he said. “
The kid held the twenty in his palm like it was the Holy Grail.  “Thanks, Iron Man.  Damn.  Thanks.  I was gonna call in sick today.”
“Well, listen harder.  I love Pepper,” he said, and when Steve looked away, Tony squeezed his hand maybe a bit harder than necessary until he looked back.  “I’ve loved her for years and I always will love her.  But being with you?  Baby, I didn’t have a choice.”
“I love you guys,” Steve sighed.  “Tell Wanda for me, too, okay?  Please?  Being with you, the three of you--” His head fell back onto the grass.  His throat worked.  He shuddered.
Steve shrugged one shoulder.  “I was strong.  Direct.  I tried to do the right things.”  He swallowed, Tony saw it in the glow of the moonlight, the bob of his Adam’s apple a shifting shadow.  “I’m not the smartest guy in the world, but I’m not stupid.  And…” he shifted uncomfortably, “I know what I look like,” he finished with reluctance and something that was very nearly distaste, as if the thought of his own good looks was something to be ashamed of rather than admired.
Steve ducked his head, putting a hand to his mouth to hide his smile.  A blush creeped out of the collar of his t-shirt, deep red against the white fabric.
“How can you say that, though?” Steve asked. “How can you-” he swallowed, ran a hand through his hair. “How can you let me be around your daughter? Knowing that? Knowing that I lose time, that I’m an alcoholic, that I’ve seen things--
Steve let out a happy breath.  “Oh.  That’s good.  I’m glad.”  He turned to Sam.  “Remember that cow in Brussels?”
Bruce came from behind the car--nothing fancy, just an older-model Prius, nothing like Rhodey’s Lexus or Tony’s gas-guzzling, gorgeous old Bentley.  Tony grabbed him in a bear-hug and Bruce looked both shocked and pleased.  Tony released him, grabbed his face in his hand and said, “What did I do without this face, huh?  You’re so cute, I could eat you up.”
“No,” Steve said bluntly.  “For this?  No.  He’s busy, Tony.  If Ross wants everybody in for a couple of days, I’m sure Doctor Strange is going too.”
She insisted she’d been kidding about the shoes, but he did pay for lunch.  They went to the Four Seasons and scarfed down course after course of food that was far too rich for two o’clock in the afternoon, but Tony kept it coming.  Things were always better with a belly full of Porterhouse and butter-poached tiger prawns.
eyes were there, that familiar, deep, whiskey brown, and Steve kissed Tony's bicep, his shoulder.  He touched the arc reactor with gentle, reverent fingers while his lips found Tony's neck, his chin, his cheek, his forehead, and at last, his lips.  He pressed his mouth to Tony's, and Tony's shaking hand rose to cup the back of his head and fist lightly in his hair for a second before falling back to the coverlet.
Steve stood up, grabbed his jeans and pulled them on. Thad watched, anger flitting around his mouth and eyes now.
Sam met him at the door, and hugged him hard. They’d talked on the phone a lot, texted, messaged back and forth, but this was the first time they’d seen each other in a long time, and when they parted, both of them wiped their eyes.
Steve looked away, looked at Natasha by his side, and felt her hand creep into his under the table.  He squeezed it.
Tony listened to the door open and close, then took the box out of his pocket. It was silver, engraved with a scrolled TS and SR on the lid. He had made the box in the shop, working on it while Steve was at work. He’d finished it two days ago, and tucked the ring into it this morning. Nat had helped him pick out the ring. It was made from silver, mother of pearl, and the wood from a redwood tree. It wasn’t expensive, but it was
“Just,” he began, then bit his lip again, the image of Steve in one of those less-functional costumes now firmly fixed in the front of his mind. “Just give me the most recent Captain America designs, huh?"
Steve pulled him roughly into his arms. He held him bone-crushingly tight, his mouth pressed into Tony’s neck, clutching him as tightly to him as he could. “No, Tony,” he rasped. “No, that’s never going to happen again. Never. Wherever I am, wherever they send me, I’ll walk home to you, if I have to. I’ll crawl. Nothing will ever keep me away from you again, okay? Nothing
Tony ran his hand through Steve’s blond hair, relishing its silky texture.  “Of course, I don’t mind.  Go to sleep.  I won’t be much longer.”
Tony glanced at Steve again, his smooth cheek, his closed eyelids, his red, parted lips.  He worked so hard, deserved so much…
“You don't have to keep your hands to yourself," Steve said, glancing shyly up at him, then closing his eyes again. "I like it when you touch me."
He gave her a brusque kiss, then stood up and jogged to where Steve was standing. His expression had changed too, devolving into bewildered concentration. Tony grabbed his coat, high up on his arm. There wasn’t much extra fabric. The bicep beneath it was distractingly large.
Jen grasped his wrist.  "Make up, sweetheart," she said.  "It's not worth it. Whatever it is, it's not worth it."
He looked down at what he’d drawn in the dust. An arrow with a “T” above it and an “S” below it. He looked at it for a while, and then he drew a heart around the whole thing, turning it into a physical declaration of...what? He was too young to be in love. He knew that. But he thought if he could ever love anybody, it would probably be Tony.
Steve laughed. “Yeah. That’d be a real bad example. You know, going to work instead of playing hooky to hang out with me.”
She brushed past Tony and clambered up onto the big bed. Steve pulled the covers up over her. She held up her arms. “Kisses.” He kissed her, smiling when her little arms closed around his neck and hugged him tight, tight, tight.
“Yeah, I can see that,” Tony said, eyeing him.  Steve was suddenly furiously glad he’d shaved his beard before Tony had seen it.  He would have hated it.  “Fit as a fucking fiddle, as per usual.”
Tony laughed sourly.  “Hey, it’s alright.  Any port in a storm, right?  I mean, golden-boy Steve Rogers and worthless Tony Stark?  It’s crazy.  Howard’s probably rolling in his grave.”
get with Steve, so he’d stay. He’d stay, and just enjoy the last little while he’d have before becoming an adult. Howard wanted him to intern at SI this summer, but Tony didn’t want to. He wanted to spend the summer with Steve. And Sam. And Nat and Clint. Just hanging around. Going to the movies. Going to Coney Island. Maybe taking a drive up north for a few days. Howard never went to the lake house. Tony could take a bunch of friends up and spend a week and Howard would probably never even know about it. God, that would be nice. A week with his friends
“Are you sure it’s his father?” Steve asked. He knew how stupid that sounded, but it seemed insane to think Howard Stark was here, in his house, this very minute. That he had parked his expensive car on the street. That he had climbed the stairs Steve had climbed every day since forever. That he was standing, or even stranger,
So what if he couldn’t always get it up for her after a long day on the beach?  He had his prescription.  And on the nights when even that didn’t really help, he had the thought of blue, Irish eyes, of a finger hooked though his belt-loop, of a sun-warm deck and a face turned casually up for a kiss hello.
I wasn't going to write this. I was just going to skip right to the birthday, but I was feeling like a big, old sap and couldn't resist it. It's short, because it's not really super important. It's mostly just a little bit of relationship-building and normal morning stuff, but occasionally, I am a sucker for that kind of thing, and I guess today is one of those kinds of days.
Tony pressed more of those not-kisses onto his chest.  “You kicked me out of your room.”  A little sweep of his tongue against Steve’s neck.  “I can take a hint.”
“Can you two please fuck it out later?” Clint said mildly.  “How ‘bout giving someone else the floor?”
“It won’t be forever. It’s just that when we had to rush, it meant that we only had one night.” Steve kissed Tony again, kept him close, kept him in his arms. “I don’t want it to feel like we only have one night.”
He picked at his bread, used the pad of his thumb to gather up a stray crumb.  He looked out the window again. "Yeah," he said reluctantly. "We had one."
“It’s not just doctors that get inside a person’s head,” Bruce said carefully.  He glanced at Tony, then at Natasha.  “Wanda never did anything, did she?  While you guys were...gone?”
,” Tony said, and now he was running his hands over Steve’s body. He hadn’t put a shirt on when he got out of the shower. He’d thrown on sweats, but his chest was bare, and Tony’s hands felt like heaven against his skin. “Talk later, okay, baby? Fuck first, talk later.”
“I don’t know, you two,” he said.  “Having her poke around in his head while he’s already compromised?  I don’t think it’s safe.  And I’m pretty positive Stephen won’t.”
The smile. God. The smile was back. The real one. The one Tony craved above all others. The one that Steve saved for him. Just him. Like he was looking at his favorite thing in the entire world. “‘Kay,” Steve said “See you at breakfast?”
“Smartass,” Steve sighed, and shook his head with a very familiar look on his face, half-irritated, half-fond.  Tony would never be able to calculate the number of times he’d seen it, and he was a genius.  It was only recently that he’d realized how often the fond part outweighed the irritation.
Steve put his hands on Tony’s hips and maneuvered him back slightly. “This isn’t exactly glacial,” he said, and Tony scoffed.
Out of the corner of his eye, Steve--Sergeant Rogers. He was Sergeant Rogers now--saw a few of his men standing up, saw Gabe being supported by Manelli and Rebel Ralston. They looked shaken and dirty, and Gabe was holding his leg at a strange angle, but they looked okay. He didn’t see Bucky, though. Or Jonathan Juniper. Where the fuck were they? Bucky, his best friend here, and Juniper who was just a kid...not that any of them were really more than kids.
“You may not pass him anything or accept anything he may try to pass to you.  No physical contact is permitted.  You must be quiet and respectful at all times.  If you break any of these rules, you will be asked to leave, and you may not return.  Do you understand?”
“Oh, I do.  I don’t see the point in watching a bunch of grown men play catch and spit all over everything, but SI donated some money to one of the same charities the Yankees did, and they gave me season tickets.  Apparently, they’re starting to get pissed that no one has used them yet.”
The guard, a kid of maybe twenty-one, flushed under his uniform cap.  “It’s not necessary for you to call me ‘sir’, Mr. Stark,” he said.
“Yeah, for about ten seconds.  Until the snot and the poop and the sticky hands come into play.  Then, I’m out.”
And never did he feel it more than when Steve broke their kiss and buried his face against the side of Tony’s neck. Steve’s arms went around his waist, and held him with a tightness that was almost too much.
He sped down the dirt driveway, that was now the mud driveway, tearing huge ruts in it with the heavy car.  Good, old-fashioned metal.  None of this fiberglass shit for him.  He was an Iron Man, through and through.
“It doesn’t have to be today,” Tony said, pressing his forehead against Steve’s. “Or tomorrow. Or next week. Or even next year.” He put his hand back on Steve’s cheek, holding him in place. Both of their heads were on the pillow, foreheads together, mouths an inch apart. Steve would be leaving soon. Too soon. In just a couple short hours. Then Tony would not see him for...who knew how long? Maybe never. But he wanted this. He wanted everything. Ever since he saw Steve walk through the door of the bar tonight, he had wanted, and wanted, and wanted. And he knew it was selfish. He knew that he was asking Steve for a lot, but if--
“It’s been a long time since I was my own boss, Tony,” Steve said softly.  “Since I didn’t have to ask somebody’s permission.”
“Ooh,” Tony sighed, “but you could come,” he said in a way that sounded like a huge burden had been removed from his shoulders.
Sir Purr jumped down from the stool and ran to Tony’s side, ready to be picked up and cuddled.  Tony reached down, pet him once, but never stopped moving.
Steve raised his hand and brushed the back of it along Tony’s jaw.  Tony took it in his own and held it against his cheek, taking in the sensation of his touch, memorizing it, burning it into his mind, into his heart.
Steve cocked an eyebrow at him. There was a little smile playing around his lips. He loved it when Tony got excited over weird little things. It made him happy to see him so happy. “Yeah?”
Steve nodded, sitting as far away as he possibly could within the confines of the seat.  It wasn’t really that far, considering, but after the warmth they’d shared during the last three hours, it felt very far indeed.
Steve obeyed, getting his knees underneath him, then allowing Tony to position him exactly the way he needed him to be. Allowing Tony to just take over completely, moaning brazenly as he slid into him. He dropped his forehead down onto the bed where his forearms were braced against the mattress. He could feel the silk of the tie still covering his eyes rubbing against his skin every time Tony thrust forward, and it was both grounding to him, and yet the most freeing experience he had ever had. He was floating. Flying. Tethered to the earth by only the most tenuous of strings--a string of pure silk--and some unknown time later, when Tony came deep inside him, Steve held tight to that string, held tight for fear that he might just disappear into the deep blue of the sky and never return.
Steve sighed and shook his head.  “Prison was the consequence, Tony.  It was the effect, not the cause.”
.  Just in the heartbeat before he stood up and walked away, just after he’d told Steve it was his call.  What might Tony have done if Steve had reached out and put his hand on Tony’s hip as he’d done with Natasha?  Would his word of whispered thanks have brought about the same result from Tony as it had with Nat?  What would Tony’s fingers feel like on his cheek?  What would his mouth feel like on his?
Bruce reached out and gently touched one screen with his finger.  The other sections disappeared and this one expanded to fill the monitor.  Bruce touched it again and, with a measured flick of his finger, threw the image up into the air in front of them.
Steve laughed and leaned in to kiss Tony’s mouth. “I don’t know,” he said. “She’s seventy, but she told my mom she’s been married five times. She might be more than you can handle.”
--that it was going to be on his skin again very shortly was enough to drive him almost mad with want.
“Fine. I’ll send you a mission update from the primary team as soon as possible. Keep me informed of any changes.”
“As far as Tony knows, everything is fine,” Howard said. He leaned back in Mr. Barker’s chair. Whenever Mr. Barker did that, it looked like it would fall over, but not now. Not with Howard Stark sitting in it. Steve got the idea that that chair would never
He laughed shakily to himself. Breathed in then out. Once. Twice. Three times. The surety of that thought didn’t go away. It intensified, even. Thank god. Thank
Steve laughed. It was more bait. He knew what Josh was doing, and while he didn’t blame him for trying to win this little battle by any means necessary, he wasn’t going to just hand the victory over to him without a fight. Because really, he knew who was going to win. It was by default--Steve was leaving tomorrow and Josh would still be here--but Josh was going to win in the end. Steve just wanted to make him work for it a little. “Nah,” he said. “No college would ever take me. I wouldn’t even have graduated high school if it wasn’t for Tony.”
Tony knew a command when he heard it.  Especially when it came from that mouth.  He’d heard enough of them over the years.  And if he was being honest with himself, it sounded almost good.  Like old times.  Iron Man and Captain America instead of Tony and Steve.  It was almost nostalgic.  Like hearing a song on the radio that took him back to a different time  A time when he was a different person.  He didn’t want to go back there, but it was nice to remember what it was like, if only for a moment.  What they had been like.  It made him appreciate today all the more.
“No,” Steve said quietly, glancing around at the other soldiers. “That’s probably not the best idea.”
Steve kissed his hand, holding it in place as Tony’s thumb stroked his cheek.  “No,” he agreed.  “You just put it in a climate-controlled, bullet-proof case.” He laughed, his breath warm against Tony’s skin, intoxicating.  “Is that what you want to do to me, Tony?”
“Don’t be mad, Rhodey, okay?  Please?” Tony babbled as Rhodey helped him inside, holding him up, holding him close in spite of the ripe smell of alcohol and sweat and sadness coming off him.
“Don’t worry, Tony,” Bruce said.  “You don’t really have to do anything.  You just need to stand there and look pretty.  We’ll all handle the rest.”
“Look,” Tony began, “not that I don’t love waking up to find you lurking out here, but was there something you wanted?”
Tony’s lids closed and when they opened, those eyes rested on Steve’s at last.  Sad and older, yes, that was true, but Steve saw pure, clean hate there too, and a swirl of fear.  Those things had not been there for Nat.  Certainly not for Bruce or Rhodey, but for Steve, Steve who had lied, Steve who had betrayed, Steve who had nearly killed him, in those eyes, it was all he could see.
He shook and shuddered his way through his orgasm, and at the height of it, fisted his hand painfully in Tony’s hair, and sunk his teeth into his own forearm, drawing a circle of tiny beads of blood on his skin.
“‘Bout how it felt the other night when you kissed me,” Steve said, his hand moving over his cock, teasing the head with his thumb, using the gathering wetness to ease his way. “How your mouth tasted. How much I wanted to get down on my knees right there in the kitchen and taste you again for real.”
Instead of chewing it, Steve put it out of reach by wrapping his arms around Tony’s waist and pulling him closer.  He rested his forehead on his chest, right next to the reactor.  It’s glow lit Steve’s hair in eldritch blue.
something he wanted to feel in connection with Tony. Even if he was trying hard to forget him, he didn’t want to feel repelled by him. He never wanted to feel that. Ever.
Hands shot in the air. Clint. Nat. Bruce. Thor, who didn’t seem to know what he was voting for, but looked happy to join in. Sam. Pepper. Hill.
.  Easily.  But I don’t want to.”  She smiled down at him with sympathy, petting his hair.  It was fine.  Blonde.  Insubstantial.  Running her fingers through it after Bruce’s coarse, thick locks felt like a travesty, but she did it anyway.  He was calming a little under her touch.  Almost in spite of himself.  That was her power.
“Pleeease?” Steve said, drawing it out, hoping Tony could be swayed by a little bit of shameless charm. Teenage-Tony would have been. Hopefully Adult-Tony hadn’t grown out of that.
She was standing by the front door. He felt bad, felt like he’d abandoned her for a moment, but he’d make it up to her. He’d apologize later, but for now, he got to do this. Got to give her this.
If he stretched, Tony could just reach Steve’s foot with his own.  He nudged him with his toe.  “Goodnight, Steve.”
“I headed up to the checkout counter,” Steve said, and he frowned, three worry-lines appearing between his brows. “I was thinking about...stuff. After-the-party stuff.” His hand tightened on Tony’s with a sudden, fierce strength. “And from a couple aisles over, I heard this kid.”
. I don’t know. I just-I’ve been hard on you. I know. With the Thad stuff, and everything else. And now we hardly ever even see each other, and-and I’m worried, I guess.”
Tony nodded.  He didn’t trust himself to speak.  Steve must have understood, because he smiled.  His own little half-smile that reduced Tony to jelly.
Steve smiled a tiny, secret smile as Tony and Sam started talking about horizontal and vertical vectors, and gravity, and time. Tony did most of the talking, but Sam seemed to understand. All of it was completely above and beyond Steve’s head, but he liked listening to them talk, liked hearing the way their voices complemented and combined into a soothing, calm background hum as they walked toward the cafeteria, the three of them side-by-side, Steve in the middle, Tony and Sam bookending him neatly. Steve didn’t think he had felt such a sense of warmth and belonging in years. Especially when Tony brushed his shoulder against Steve’s as he walked. Steve was sure it was accidental--definitely not on purpose--but it still felt good.
Tony feels hate for a single moment and it terrifies him. But when there was anyone he still had Rhodey, he never left him and his friend was with him in everything that matters. James was the one that found him, who didn’t stop to search for him when everybody gave him for lost.
Also Mr. Rogers seemed to adapt to his own peculiarities, they made an amazing team, or that was the other personnel said.
People was afraid and when cornered it’s obvious that they would react. Laura wondered if Clint thought of that.
Because there was Steve Rogers with that sweet smile of him and blue-blue eyes, being the perfect being that he was, saving lost dogs in his free time it seems. If Tony were not already half in love with the blond, he would be now; could someone be more perfect and unreachable?
“Are you sure that you wanted to move in with me?” Tony asked, “I was hard to manage in bigger doses.”
Maybe that was one of the reasons he didn’t went to Aunt Peggy’s funeral, that and that he wasn’t really family, not the way Sharon is or the connection that Steve had. Even if Sharon called him telling him the hour and place and asking if he wanted to say something. He didn’t deserve that privilege.
Someone coughed in his near vicinity and Tony remembered about the stranger. So for this time he would do what a normal person would do.
He had seen the end of his relationship with Pepper long ago, before the Mandarin, after his trip to the wormhole. But he tried, because that woman was one of the best things that happened in his life…he loved her and he wasted a lot of years with his head in his ass and not seeing, even then Pepper loved him and she was wonderful for that reason and thousands more.
The God of Thunder smiled sadly, “It was not the lack of love, but neither it was another thing. It’s fate, is something too old to be understood even from Gods. It was each decision, a fix point that could change the fate of a person in an irreversible way. But a soulmate has been chosen to fulfill the needs of the other person and that goes both ways, so for example when a person dies their mate lost their mark…because they aren’t there to fit their role. So that someone lost their soulmate mark with his mate alive is strange, that only one of them did it is stranger”
The puppies barked, or tried to bark, moving franticly inside the box happy with the attention. They were a little wet, the box didn’t offer much of protection against the rain, but their fur were not too dirty so he could see their color, one of them was a light gray with black spots and the other was totally black or at least it seemed that way; Tony didn’t know which race they could be, the nearer he had been of a dog was Thor’s Golden Retriever ¾a crazy dog with a friendly attitude that matched its owner¾, but if his limited knowledge was correct, they must be a mix…they were more common to be abandoned.
He saw red, he hadn’t thought beyond killing the man that assassinated his mother, Tony forgot about all the programming and HYDRA’s orders, he only wanted the blood of the man that strangulated Maria…the one that left him an orphan at nineteen.
Tony walked leisurely towards the restaurant, trying to give his mind more time to compose himself. He didn’t know why he was so affected by this, when there were other times or more explicit glimpses of his boss love life.
Then Tony was asleep. Steve set his alarm, then drifted off too. There were no nightmares. No real fear of them either. He hadn’t had a nightmare in weeks. Not since the night before the party. Not since Tony had told him he loved him. He knew they would still happen--he wasn’t naive enough to believe they’d never happen again--but he hoped they would be fewer now. Fewer and farther between. He thought they might be. With Tony here, he thought they might be.
Tony arched his back, increasing the pressure, and dug his fingers into Steve’s back.  “I want to feel you, baby,” he said.  “Come on.  Please.”
He sighed.  “Come on, Steve,” he said softly.  “You do look tired.  And you can have the bed, ‘kay?  I’ll sleep on the couch.”
And Steve couldn’t help the way his eyes found Tony where he sat out in the congregation with a pretty redhead by his side, holding his hand. He couldn’t help the way his heart burned inside his chest, leaving it nothing but a tiny cinder when Tony looked back. He couldn’t help the way that tiny cinder still sped up, still doing what it was created for, still pounding within the cage of his ribs, beating out Tony’s name like it had done for years and years. And he didn’t even try to stop it. There was no point.
“Not often,” she said softly. “Every couple of months. Just for a minute or two.” She frowned, her face filled with sorrow. “I’ll stop if it bothers you,” she said. “I’ll tell him-”
Tony shook his head, pulled him closer again. “You don’t have to remember the words. Just what you meant. You remember that, right?”
Steve nodded. “Yeah.”  He reached up and touched one of the buttons on Tony’s shirt. “You were going to work,” he said with a wry smile. “Why didn’t you tell me you were going to work?”
“I just need to tread carefully.  He’ll tell me, he always does, he just needs to do it in his own time.  His own way.”
Tony stopped talking as Steve’s eyes met his and held.  The same crystalline blue that had stopped his mouth and stopped his heart forever did so again now.  His voice was the same too, if slightly cracked from disuse.
Tony swept the little guy up in his arms, making him squeal, then landed him next to Natasha. She curled her arm around him and he lay against her. His thumb crept into his mouth. Nat smoothed her hand over his head and kissed him.
Steve slid into him with long, slow thrusts, that were agonizingly good, hitting his prostate with unerring accuracy.  He was sweating, his skin golden and shimmery in the lamp-light.
Steve watched him carefully, his brows contracting a little. Now he looked uncertain, as if he’d said something wrong. The blush Tony had expected earlier came now, but not his favorite pale, pretty pink. No, this time it was a dull, brick red. And Steve’s eyes were darker too. Dark and worried the way they got when he got hung up on a tough history question.
Steve blinked a few times fast, trying to clear his eyes in case it was just a trick of the light and this was some other guy standing here looking anxiously down at him. But it must not have been. Tony still stayed Tony. Slim, elegant even in his t-shirt and jeans, eyes dark and watchful. In a word--beautiful.
“My god,” Tony breathed, looking at him. He let his own fingers run across Steve’s torso, breath quickening as he touched his chest, his abdominals, the v-cut line above his jeans.
Morgan smiled, and shook her head. Steve nodded, and held his hand out. “Shake on it?” She giggled, and put her tiny hand into his large one. Steve shook it up and down twice. When he tried to let go, she held on, holding it as tightly as she held Tony’s.
in a pleasant mood.  There was none of the low-grade fever jumping and sizzling through his veins like there usually was pre-mission.  He felt an air of quiet contentment.  Part of it was Tony, part of it was Nat being home, part of it was all of them being together this morning, but none of that could account for the entirety of the peace he felt.  Most of it was that he knew they were going to win.  He’d woken up with the knowledge inside of him, nestled in his brain like a slumbering animal.  He knew something else too--someone
Tony blinked, startled out of his little daydream--he was already getting down to business in his head--and finally saw Howard sitting there, perpetual glass of rye in his hand, staring hard at him.
Steve nodded, and as he did, it felt like a huge weight--maybe the only real weight left on his shoulders--was suddenly gone.  “Yeah.  Give it to them.  All of it.”
“Steve?” Tony said, and the look in his eye, kind of anxious and eager, made those thoughts fly out the window.
He hung up the phone, took two bites of his cereal, then picked up the phone again.  He didn’t have to search his contacts--this number was on speed-dial.  Number 3, to be exact.
Dodger whined, trying to remind them he was here and wanted some attention too, and Morgan dropped to her knees to hug him around the neck. “Hi, Dodger,” she said, and he bumped her cheek with his nose. She let out a high-pitched string of giggles, and that
Steve opened his mouth, but Tony overrode him.  “He was working out.  I helped.  The things he can do…”  Tony slung an arm around Rhodey’s shoulder.  “It’s a shame you weren’t down here to see it.”
Blood sheeted down his neck, his chest, pattering to the floor in great, huge drops.  Tony fell to his knees, grabbing the tablecloth with one hand and yanking it down.  Plates, silverware, the vase with FRIDAY’s daisies in it, all clattered to the ground.  Two glasses shattered unimportantly as Tony pressed the tablecloth to Steve’s throat.
Tony lifted Steve’s hand to his mouth. “Yeah,” he whispered. “In July.” He kissed Steve’s hand, then scrubbed away a tear with the back of his own. “In July, we’ll bring spray paint, and breadcrumbs, and we’ll go swimming.”
“Josh, huh?” Steve repeated, but kept his eyes firmly fixed on Natasha’s face. He didn’t want to look over there anymore. He didn’t want to see Tony and
Tony ran his hand through Steve’s hair. “Yay,” he said in a giddy tone that made Steve’s heart thump double-time. “
They fell silent, those words hanging in the air between them. After a while, Tony propped himself up on his elbow and tapped a finger on the middle of Steve’s forehead. “What’s going on in there?” he asked.
“Do I?” he asked.  “‘Cause I don’t think so.  I think if you’re not working, you go crazy.  There’s so much in your head, so much stuff in there, if you don’t have something to focus on you start to fall to pieces.”  He was talking faster now, the words spilling out of him.  “You’ve got the biggest heart of anybody I ever met,” Steve went on, “but I’m not an MIT grad student.  I’m not a small-town pizza man.  I’m not a-a
Tony fidgeted as he watched the other inmates with their families.  They were mostly men, the visitors mostly women.  Their wives, Tony assumed, or maybe their sisters.  There were a few who could only be mothers, women with tears on their faces and hands that reached out to touch a pale cheek, but caught themselves at the last moment and quickly pulled back.
“-Talk about coordinating humanitarian outreach in the Middle East,” Tony said, his memory of their previous conversation finally kicking in. “Which is why we were having breakfast and not lunch today. Fuck.”
Steve nodded again. Sighed. Nat and Clint were a good team. He paired well with either one whenever he was position one, but the two of them together were like a well-oiled machine. He was glad they were on this. If he couldn’t be in control, they were the next best option. “Okay. Keep me in the loop.”
“If that was true, we would be in a very different position right now,” Tony mumbled. His voice was sleepy though, eyelids drooping.
Steve laid hold of the razor and put the tip under his ear.  He drew it across his throat, ending its short, deadly journey at the exact spot Tony had claimed as his own.
There was a low light in here, coming from a tiny emergency bulb.  All the better to see you on our cameras, and shit, Tony hadn’t thought about the cameras.
Tony brought his hand up and laid it against the side of Steve’s neck, touched his bottom lip with his thumb, then trailed it over his chin. Steve smiled more naturally then. His heart didn’t heal, but the cracks didn’t get any deeper either. “I love you,” Tony mouthed, with barely a whisper of sound, but Steve still heard it. And maybe some of those cracks healed a little, after all.
“Good,” Ross said, and smiled.  It was warm, genuine, and for a moment, Tony thought Steve had been right, after all.  Ross
Tony narrowed his eyes at Steve.  “You owe me.”  Steve nodded.  “FRIDAY, let Rhodey in.  And do whatever Captain Virtue here asks from now on, okay?  Pretty please?”
He got his phone out and looked at it. Thad had bought it for him when they started dating. Steve had tried to turn it down, but Thad insisted. He had bought him new clothes too. A Ralph Lauren camel-hair coat. A watch. Steve had drawn the line at the car he’d wanted to buy. It was too much. He couldn’t accept it. Thad sulked for a while but he got over it when Steve got on his knees and first apologized, then let him fuck his mouth until he came down Steve’s throat. When Steve tried to pull away, Thad clenched his fist in his hair, and said, “No. You’re going to stay here for a while. If you really want me to be happy, stay here and keep me happy.”
Sam reached out and clasped his shoulder.  “Don’t beat yourself up.  This isn’t your fault,” he said, and Tony felt a surge of gratitude.  No wonder Steve loved this guy so much.
him.  He had wanted so much to tell Wanda yes, do it, fix me, but he couldn’t.  Because that wasn’t the right way.  That was the cheap way, the easy way, the slap-a-band-aid-on-a-massive-head-wound way, and he couldn’t do that.
“Vintage Versace,” Strange said.  “I’d hate to ruin it, too.”  He nodded at her.  “Especially since it looks so beautiful on you.”
Steve walked out of the gym.  Tony followed, staying a step behind him the whole way.  When they reached the stairwell and the door closed behind them, Steve reached for Tony’s hand.  He gave it reluctantly.
Steve braced his stronger right foot on the ground, grabbed the headboard with his hands, and pulled, using his foot as little as possible for balance.  His left leg moved a little, but still hung mostly useless yet, not impeding him--he’d learned to work around it--just being a nuisance, instead.
. He wrapped his arms tightly around Tony, hugging him with sudden, fierce strength. “I love you,” he said. “God, Tony, I love you so much.”
The blush deepened across Steve’s cheeks.  God, Tony adored that pale, Irish skin.  “You fell asleep on the couch while we were watching that dumb movie, and I just sort of did it.”  He looked down at their linked hands, then back up at Tony.  “I knew I shouldn’t, but I just...wanted to.”  He fixed Tony with a glum expression, looking like an eight-year-old with his hand caught in the old proverbial cookie jar.  “I’m sorry.”
And that wasn’t fair. To Tony or to him. But that was his fault too, wasn’t it? He should have told him. He should have given him the promises he’d asked for. Steve had felt it back then. Had always felt it. Was afraid he would always feel it, no matter what. But it was too late. Wasn’t it? There was no way Tony still loved him. Three years--six, really, discounting their one-night stand--was a very long time. Especially when you’re young. Especially when you don’t really understand how fast time goes by, or how precious it is. How easy it is to lose everything you have in the blink of an eye.
day,” Tony agreed. He pushed his face into Steve’s neck and kissed his smooth skin. “I missed you so much.”
Steve grinned, ducked his head, and grinned some more.  He laughed, just a little, no more than a chuckle, but it was all Tony needed.  Well, that, and one other thing.
Jen nodded.  "Yes. I just wish they'd done it while Jeff was still here.  He always wanted the kids to come home."
. The talking. And him not doing it was hurting Steve in a weird way he didn’t quite get. All he knew was that Tony wasn’t talking. And he looked sad. Really sad. And that hurt Steve too. He didn’t want Tony to look sad. He didn’t want him to
Tony had laughed bitterly, pressing his cheek into her shoulder and clutching her tightly. “Yeah. He’s stubborn, all right. But he’s nothing compared to my dad, Mrs. Rogers. Nothing. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. If he hadn’t met me...if we’d never…”
Howard chuckled again and drank some of his coffee. He drank it black, Steve noticed, just like he did. “Sometimes it’s the perks that make a job the most worthwhile.”
He’d wheeled into the bedroom, just glancing at the maple armoire and large, quilt-covered bed, before making sure the chair would fit into the bathroom.  Tony knew it would, had measured it three times himself, but let Steve check on his own.  When Tony asked him if it was okay, Steve had just smiled and said it was perfect.
Tony thought distractedly, then sighed. No. There was no way. No way someone who was perfection personified would ever be interested in him. At least not for more than a quick fuck, and Tony couldn’t do that. At least not
“Are you armed?” Bucky asked, and it was almost casual.  As if the answer didn’t matter.  As if asking if Tony wanted to catch a movie later.
He pushed the 'Cuda up to 100, and everything flew by.  The trees, the derelict, pock-marked road signs. One startled deer bolted into the woods as he passed, and soon there were outlying farms.  Mailboxes on the side of the road. A few billboards. Then more houses, more buildings, and he was forced to slow down because there was a yellow sign that read "Children at Play", and no matter how badly he wanted to be at the hospital right this second, he would never do anything to endanger a child.
memories about his father. He knew it was fucked up beyond belief. He knew it was something that he would never admit to anyone. Not even himself most days. But, when Howard stepped toward him when he was angry was the only time he ever came close to Tony at all, and part of him craved that. Part of him would always crave that. Part of him wanted Howard to step closer and be in the same space with him, and if it couldn’t be out of love or affection, Tony had gotten to a place where he was okay with it being out of anger. At least Howard came close to him then. At least Tony got to meet his eyes. At least Tony got to feel the warmth from his body. At least he got to smell him--a mixture of aftershave and alcohol that would always scream
Tony laughed in the back of his throat. He kept petting Steve’s hip, and bent his neck enough to kiss the smooth skin of his forearm. “You wouldn’t do that,” he chided.
“Oh, god, Rhodey, no,” Tony said sincerely.  “He’d kill himself before he ever hurt me again.  It was nothing like that.”
Steve scratched down a few notes on the margin of his textbook.  It pained him in a vague way to do that.  When his professor had said in their first class that not only did he
The door to the bedroom was open, the tv flickering blue-white on the rumpled white duvet. Tony was curled up underneath it, his shoulder, clad in Steve’s old t-shirt, stuck out. Steve could see it move with his sleeping breath.
He sighed and put his forehead against Tony's stomach.  "Okay. Yes, I did. But I shouldn't have said it. I wasn't trying to hurt you, Tony.  I
“I can’t,” he said softly.  “I have to do this the right way.  I have to put the work in.”  He looked at each of them, his eyes flitting past Tony’s before settling on Nat’s again.  “Thank you, all of you, for wanting to help, but,” he sighed, “I have to do this on my own.”
After a while, Tony left a string of kisses from Steve’s shoulder up to his ear. “I felt it too, you know,” he said. “That connection. Right from the start. From the very first minute I met you.”
Behind him, Bucky collapsed on the ground in tears.  Natasha knelt next to him and took him into her arms as best she could.  Sam hesitated only a moment before joining them, slipping one arm around Nat’s waist and the other across Bucky’s heaving shoulders.
Steve grinned and yanked Tony toward him and into his arms.  Tony melted against him, holding on tightly.  “I meant Strange,” he whispered, and Steve laughed in his ear, then kissed him.
She grabbed a water bottle and a towel from the table.  She took a swallow and handed him the bottle.  He drank deeply.
Tony let out a breath he didn’t know he’d been holding.  His chest hurt.  He put a hand to it and kneaded a little.  He thought he might have been holding that breath ever since Strange and Shuri had come out of her operating room and said Steve was alive.
Steve frowned, those three vertical lines between his brows.  He opened his mouth, then closed it again.  He sighed.  “Yeah.”
He shook his head, the corner of his mouth lifting slightly. “Don’t look at me,” he said. “I’m abstaining. At least until the beard goes.”
Tony closed his eyes, listening as Steve went into the bathroom. He heard the shower start up, and allowed himself to drift while he waited for Steve to come back. It wasn’t difficult. It had never been difficult here. This had always been such a comfortable place. So easy. So warm. He had always felt good here. Like the person he wanted to be, and he wanted to feel that way again. He wanted to feel that way with Steve.
Tony jerked his head back down the hallway.  “Come on,” he said, but Steve didn’t move.  Tony rolled his eyes.  “What, you want to do it out here?”
Morgan looked up at her, and Sarah looked back. There were tears in the corners of Sarah’s eyes, but she smiled with a brilliance that made Tony almost want to start crying again himself.
Steve’s lips moved against the back of his neck, leaving small tender kisses there.  Tony stroked his arm, running his fingers along the muscle, reached back and touched his hip, his thigh.
“No,” Steve said, shaking his head. "You were right about me. It’s Tony you underestimated.” He started away, back toward the door, back toward his mother, and his career, and Pietro, back to the life he was trying very hard to build. The life without Tony Stark. But before he got there, he spoke one last time. “You should call him,” he said. “Tell him what’s going on with you. He’d want to hear. Want to help.”
He let his eyes flick to the cup sitting by Steve’s hand. “That for me?” he asked, and Steve nodded.
The thud of Steve’s heart was a comforting beat.  Slow, soft, steady.  As upsetting as they’d been, for the time being, Tony had forgotten the things Steve had said.  He’d forgotten they were in a prison cell.  They could be anywhere.  The cabin, the Tower, Hawaii, Peru, fucking Antarctica.  It didn’t matter.  Steve planted a kiss on the top of his head.  His hand stole under the hem of Tony’s shirt and caressed his skin.  Tony lifted Steve’s other hand and kissed the pad of each finger, then the middle of the palm.
They had written a few times after spending the night together a while back, but it hadn’t lasted long. Tony wrote about school, and work, and his friends, and the weather back in New York, and how he and Howard had rewritten some of the contracts with foreign distributors, and how he was working on a source of clean energy within SI, and a hundred other things. He signed the letters,
Tony closed the rest of the distance between them and took the sheet from Steve’s hands. “No,” he said, shaking his head. “No, honey, please don’t. Don’t put it away.”
He came around the couch and kissed her cheek. Dodger followed him, and when Steve sat down beside his mother, he flopped down on the floor on top of his feet.
Tony drifted off not long after that, and Steve lay quiet, thinking about how he had gotten here. Thinking about all the years that had passed since he’d first met that small, dark-haired boy in an elementary school cafeteria. Years since they’d kissed on that tree stump behind the school. Years since they’d met again, in high school this time. Since they’d kissed again. Since they’d made love. Since they’d
Steve flinched, squeezing his eyes shut, as the lights came on.  The bullet struck home in his upper arm.  His grip loosened on the razor, but he didn’t drop it.  Tony rolled instinctively in front of Steve, then jumped to his feet, shielding him from another bullet.
he kissed that mouth?  He should have been keeping track, recording every time he’d touched those lips, ran his fingers through that hair.
“Tony,” he said, and his voice was the same.  That same baritone that, for a while, at least, had meant everything was right in Tony’s world.
“‘Scuse me,” Tony said, and shouldered his way out of the crowd, putting the phone up to his ear. “Sam?” he said. “What’s going on? What’s wrong?”
Strange drank some of his coffee.  Tony got the impression he was being punished for insolence, and he kept silent, enduring.  This was one of the games they played.  Battling for dominance.  Tony wasn’t much into mind-games though, these days.  That’s why he liked Steve.  They fought, they argued, but in the end, they compromised and worked together.  He and Strange would do that too.  It just might take them a little longer.  They didn’t have the love-thing to fall back on like he and Steve did.  Or the sex-thing.
, baby, I’m not sorry.  Not for bringing you here.  Not for being with you, not for wanting you, or loving you.  I could never be sorry for that.  Not for any of those things.”
She pressed her lips briefly against the top of his head and walked back to the front of the jet, leaving him alone. He curled into himself and closed his eyes, hearing her answer in his head as if she had spoken it aloud.
“He thinks you’re going to blow me,” Tony said when they were alone in the cell, then added hopefully, “Are you going to blow me?”
A brief image popped into his head.  He and Steve lying on a blanket outside.  Steve kissing him while Tony stroked him lazily, and all the while Bucky’s body lay decomposing under six inches of dirt behind the warehouse.
“Oh, I think you can.”  He kissed Steve’s neck, ran his tongue along his jawline.  “You can do anything.  I have complete faith in you.”
At the end of the path was a little wooded area where Dr. Banner sometimes took his classes. He said it was to study the natural world around them, and maybe that was part of it, but Steve kind of thought Dr. Banner just liked being out of the classroom. He always seemed a little calmer when they were out there. A little easier in his skin.
“What do you mean?” Tony whispered.  His steps were soft, silent as cat paws as he crossed the living room.
Sam laughed. “Dude. Don’t. I’ve got chemistry, and trig, and physics to deal with this year. I’m pretty much fucked no matter what I do.”
Tony kissed his neck, rubbed his shoulders, turning Steve to putty in his hands.  “No, Steve, you really don’t.  You don’t have to say anything.  Just leave it alone.  You don’t owe him anything.”
blankets--and just laid there, trying not to think until the sky outside the window began to lighten.
“You’ve lost weight too. I know you’re worried, but fuck, man, you’ve got to take better care of yourself. You’ve got to eat. And sleep. And-”
Steve did, and smiled a little.  Just the corner of his mouth, but it was a good one.  Tony loved that half-smile.  It was rapidly becoming one of his all-time favorite things.
The image in front of them moved as Steve shifted in his sleep.  His brow contracted, his head turned fretfully.  His tongue came out and wet his lips, then slipped back inside his mouth.  He hitched in a deep breath, then sighed it out again, and then he was still.  But his face retained that pinched, worried look.  It always did when this happened.  Unless Tony took him in his arms and soothed it away with whispered words and kisses, it would stay for a while.
“This is a good page,” Tony said.  “I like this page.  We need to stay on this page for a very long time.”
Steve saw something flit over Howard’s face, something he couldn’t quite name, but he didn’t look angry. “Perhaps I could entertain you,” he said, and Steve frowned deeper.
“We were looking for a kitten,” Steve said.  “This thing’s old.  And...you know, it looks really pissed off.”
“And what if it’s me who dies?” Tony asked.  “Or Nat?  Or Bruce?  You’re telling me you’d be fine with that?”
Steve squeezed Tony’s hand one more time then let it go.  He sat Wanda up, then held her face in his large hands.  “Are you sure about this, red?”
He ran his thumb over it now. It was a twenty-four-hour number. It didn’t matter that it was nine o’clock on a Wednesday night. It didn’t matter that most other government agencies were closed at this hour. All that mattered, was those numbers. And those words. Especially the one word. The “mediocrity” word. Would calling this number now help get rid of that? Would he still be mediocre if he was a man in uniform, protecting and defending his country against all enemies both foreign and domestic? Would Howard Stark see his worth if he was doing those things? Would Tony?
“It’s okay, Dodger,” Steve said, hoping he wasn’t lying. “Mom?” He put a tentative hand on her knee. “Mom? You okay?”
Steve came closer and put his hand on Pietro’s hip. Pietro didn’t push him away, but he didn’t soften either. “I never wanted to hurt you,” Steve whispered. “That’s the last thing I wanted.”
Tony toyed with the ends of Steve’s tie. It was smooth silk. Soft in his hand. He wished he could reach up and touch Steve’s neck to see if his skin felt the same, but he didn’t
Steve blinked and shifted.  A pink blush had crept onto his cheeks.  His blue eyes found the door, planning his escape.  Tony was both hurt and relieved.
“We can do something tomorrow, if you want,” Steve said.  He was turned toward Tony in his seat, back against the door--seatbelt be damned--head against the seat, curled up like a cat.  Tony could feel the weight of his eyes in his bones.  It didn’t feel like a sexual thing, although Steve could do that quite well when he wanted to.  This was just looking.  Just watching.  Just a comfortable, existing-together look.  Tony thought he’d never felt a look so warm.  He didn’t ever want it to stop.
Steve got up and got dressed. He washed and brushed his teeth, and when he came out of the bathroom, the bed was empty. He could smell coffee though, and he followed the scent to the kitchen.
Steve cracked an eye open.  Tony was looking at him, his glasses flashed with reflected light from his tablet.  Steve rubbed his eyes.
And it must have flipped the right combination of switches, because suddenly he was very aware that he was just standing here staring at a very naked Steve Rogers. He did an abrupt about-face, turning his back with near military precision. “Fuck,” he said. “Steve. I’m sorry. I wasn’t staring. I wasn’t. I promise.” He heard the sound of water sloshing as Steve moved toward the edge of the pool, then the louder sound of him boosting himself up onto the tile. “I...um, at least, I didn’t
Steve ducked his head, hiding it from Tony.  “Get your pizza, Tony,” he said in a voice that was too husky, too raw.
“You got any other surprises for me, Thad?” Tony asked.  “Don’t lie.  FRIDAY can sweep the room and if she sees something, you and I will have to take a little trip behind the woodshed.”
“Are you okay?” Steve asked, his eyes flashed in the semi-gloom, searching Tony’s.  Those three worry-lines were between his brows.
He was quiet, listening to the other guys bullshit back and forth while they walked. He was almost always quiet unless he was giving orders. It was one of the things they all liked about him. That they all admired. Steve wasn’t prone to a bunch of talk--which was why when he
was in the mail.”  He gestured sharply at the letter Tony still held.  “And I could feel everything slipping away.  Everything we have here, everything we’ve
Tony rolled off Steve’s back, pulling gently out of him. Steve moaned, a quiet sound of surrender. “It’s okay, baby,” Tony breathed, and urged him near again. “Come here.”
But, then he moved a little, shifted his bag from one shoulder to the other, and the illusion was broken.  Steve sighed, and those strain-lines appeared around his eyes again.  “Maybe someday,” he said tiredly.  “But not tonight.”
He rubbed his smooth cheek against Tony's shoulder, then kissed him there before lying against him again.  "You're so smart. Have I ever told you how much I love that? How smart you are?"
Tony closed his fingers over Steve’s.  There was a tiny bead of blood under his thumbnail.  Tony wiped it away gently.  “No, it doesn’t.”
Silence spun out between them.  Outside the open window, crickets trilled their nighttime song.  Steve looked at the window, the dark pressing against it.  His face was blank, unreadable even to Tony who was probably closer to him than anyone now, save one.  He wanted this to be over, suddenly.  It had gone on too long, had gotten too ugly.  He wanted nothing more than to take Steve’s hand and mend this breach between them.  Steve looked at his own hands.  Tony watched him as he lifted one, curled it into a loose fist, then let it drop.  When he looked up at Tony again, his eyes were blue, the black cast gone.  They were big and blue and vulnerable.
In his mind, Tony saw himself rushing forward and spitting in the man’s face. He saw himself punching him in the mouth, screaming at him for fucking up the one good thing he had in his life. But in reality, he didn’t do those things. He just looked at his father, then said in a tone that was dull and lifeless. “I’m not your son anymore.”
Clint cleared his throat loudly, and Tony dragged his gaze away from Steve’s. “What do you want, Barton?”
He hadn’t really expected their date to happen on Steve’s floor--they usually hung out on the common floor or up in the penthouse--but Steve had texted him and told him where to be, so now here he was, waiting outside his date’s door.
“You too,” she said, smiling, and kissed his mouth before putting her arms around him.  Tony hugged her firmly, then turned to Sam.
Steve’s hands clenched on his shirt. He shoved his head through the hole and pulled it on. “It doesn’t have anything to do with Tony,” he muttered.
can take care of her.’ That’s what he said, Tony.” He laughed again, but this time it was harsh and uneven, nothing like his sweet, natural laugh. “He said they were
Steve laughed as Tony wrapped his arms and legs around him, clutching him in a vise-like octopus grip. “I’d tell you,” he said into Tony’s shoulder, “but I can’t breathe.”
Steve glanced up.  His face was still lost in shadow, but Tony could hear the smile in his voice.  “Fuck you.”
Steve didn’t answer. He just moved aside and let Tony brush past him into the apartment. Tony heard the door close, the locks, three of them--
being on the receiving end. But since he’d met Steve, he had discovered the unique thrill of being the one who
I thought of this scene really early on in the story. I thought it would be a fun little ending to the whole "Thad" situation, and I was really excited about writing it. I live in America, and as most of you are aware, a lot of shit involving the police has happened here since then. A lot of bad shit. And I debated for weeks about whether I should write the scene the way I had conceived it earlier, or if I should try and change it to just exclude the whole thing. It's not a huge part of the story, and I would not want to offend anyone, but I decided to leave it in. I'm not sure if I made the right choice, but, it's the choice I made. I was going to just have this be a part of the whole long last chapter, but I decided to post this part on its own, so we can have the good part--the happy ending I have promised from day one--be its own thing without this part, in case it bothers anyone. I kept it super light, because this is fiction, and light is the whole tone I wanted from the time I thought of this scene in the first place.
Steve shook his head, that tiny Cheshire Cat smile back on his lips.  “It’s okay,” he said for a third time, and his thumb edged under the hem of Tony’s t-shirt so it could touch bare skin.  The feeling was like controlled lightning in a bottle.
“The cowboy guys with the triangle things,” he said, his shoulders lifting in an embarrassed shrug.  “It’s called a chuckwagon.”
None of them spoke. Not a single word. Steve could hear a couple of people letting out watery little sniffs, and he understood completely. He was almost on the verge of tears himself, but for now, he was able to keep them at bay. He sat with his head pressed against the window, just watching the darkness pass. He was exhausted. He missed home. He missed Tony. And Morgan. His mom and Dodger. And yeah, he knew he was going to be home soon--Christ, he’d
"I'm okay," Steve said, and he knew Tony wasn't just asking about this particular moment in time. He knew about what had happened. Of course he did. How could he not? Steve just wasn't sure how much he knew about
And if there was ever a time Tony thanked god she liked Steve better than him, it was right that second.
Tony laughed as he ran his hands up and down the line of Steve’s back. The fabric of his sweater was so soft, the muscles beneath it were so hard, and Steve smelled so good--fabric softener, and menthol shaving lotion, and a hint of that cedar rose bath oil, which meant he’d taken a solitary bath at some point in the last few hours--that it was making him feel a little delirious. Almost drunk.
Tony snorted and looked across the bar to where Natasha still sat with Bucky. She had his hand in hers, her finger tracing the line on his palm, like she was pretending to read his life-line. “Miss Romanov just gave you the whole scoop, didn’t she?”
Tony smiled to himself.  He hadn't been fishing for a compliment, but he wasn't going to turn it down, either.
“You asked for it off, Steve,” Tony went on. “You told them you had to have it. We have plans...I made
Tony looked out the window.  The hatch leading down into the prison was still closed.  It was closed 99% of the time.  Not much use opening it when you were surrounded by hundreds of miles of water in every direction.  Not even Steve could swim that far.  At least not in these temperatures.
“Okay.  Good.”  Steve turned on his side and curled into Tony.  They were both a sweaty, sticky mess, but neither cared.  They’d clean up later.  Steve was nearly asleep beside him, and Tony was falling fast, but he needed to know something first.  Had to ask.
Thad stood up. He was nearly as tall as Steve, but not as muscular, not as broad. He did, however, exude an authoritative air that Steve could not deny. It reminded him of his father. “What did you just say to me?” Thad asked, his voice edged with ice.
Tony nodded. “Downtime is a waste of time,” he said automatically, and Steve’s smile disappeared altogether.
“Yeah,” he said, and turned so he was facing Steve. His eyes were lit up, looking excited. “Yeah. Please? Please come with me to my boring, monotonous, ridiculously gaudy Stark Industries birthday-thing?” He grasped Steve’s hand and clutched it to his chest, batting his eyes until Steve chuckled. “God, baby, please?”
Tony frowned, suddenly uncomfortable, suddenly worried it was too much.  There were a lot of zeros on that check.
for them, sometimes it was easier when they were out of the room.  Understood that being with them didn’t automatically equal contentment. Understood that sometimes being with them was lonelier than being alone.
“I didn’t say I don’t know how.  I’m just saying it-” he lifted the paper covered in scratched-out words, “-
Tony shook his head.  Through the window, he saw Steve turn the corner.  Where was he staying?  Was he living here now?  Had Fury found him a place?  Had Nat known?  Was that what she was going to tell him?  “No.  It wasn’t.”
Tony glanced out the window at Steve.  The sun was out and his hair was lit with golden highlights.  God, he was beautiful.
Steve tilted his head back against the wall again and drew his knees up.  He clasped his arms loosely around them, and looked at Tony.  “Why are you here?” he asked.
“Nothing,” he said, looking back down at the table. “I was just thinking...maybe we could study somewhere else today.”
Morgan jumped up. “Pancakes!” she shouted, and Dodger leapt to his feet and chased her out the door.
Steve swept him into his arms again, devouring him, lifting him enough to let Tony wrap his legs around his waist, then carrying him the rest of the way into the bedroom. He didn’t bother closing the door. They never had. Too wrapped up in each other to worry about Sarah walking in on them. Tony had never realized that before. That they had worried more about offending Mrs. Perkins’s delicate ears with their moans and cries than about Steve’s mother actually seeing them in the act of it. At another time, he might have found that funny, but right now there was nothing funny here. There was too much hunger in his heart, too much want, too much passion. It drove away the laughter. He might re-discover it again later, but for now, all he wanted was Steve’s mouth on him, his hands on him.
and not just a father. That part wanted to tell him. Wanted Howard to be happy for him. And happy for Steve too. But he wasn’t quite sure if they were there yet. Which sucked because the party was in roughly three hours. They were running out of time, but so what? Like Howard had said, it was
Tony clenched his hand in Steve’s shirt, then stretched up to kiss him. His eyes were still closed, his mouth soft and supple with sleep. “I like waking up with you,” he said, then slipped back down until his head was on Steve’s chest again.
Steve laughed again and gave him a shove. “Get off me,” he grumbled, a blush starting to crawl out of the collar of his sweater.
Eyes still closed, Steve took the hand from his hair, held it in his, brought it to his mouth, kissed the fingers, the palm, the forearm.  He opened his eyes now, finally daring to look, and
“You’re fucking crazy, Jones,” Bucky was saying. “We all know that Babe Ruth was the greatest player ever.”
Sam and Nat brought out the cake around nine. It was covered with candles. Tony had told them to do that. Sam had wanted to just put one on there, but Tony had insisted they put on as many as would fit. They only had enough room for 70, but Steve laughed and blushed when he saw it. Tony knew he would. He laughed more when Sam and Natasha raced each other with lighters trying to get them all lit before the others burned out.
There was a beat of silence where they just looked at each other, and then Tony’s eyes grew wide, filled with a wild intensity, and he threw an arm around Steve’s neck and yanked him roughly down on top of him. “Jesus,” he said, hugging him dangerously tight. “Jesus Christ. Steve. What the fuck? When did you get here?”
“No,” Tony said. “It was perfect. Everything you said was perfect. It was exactly what she needed to hear.”
Steve leaned forward abruptly and kissed first her right cheek, and then her left.  “Alright,” he relented.  “Alright, little red.  Let’s do it.  You and me.”
“Okay.  No, you’re not like everybody else.  I know that, Steve.  If anybody knows that, it’s me,” Tony answered.  “You’re special.”
. Hot and stuffy in his stupid, fucking office, wearing his stupid, fucking suit and tie, and shouldn’t there be a moratorium on jackets and ties in the summer? Even with the central air on and the sun hours down, it was still muggy and miserable.
Tony nodded. He looked past Sam’s shoulder to where Steve still sat, obliviously reading his book in the sun. “Georgia,” he said quietly.
Tony could see the wheels turning in Howard’s mind. That was nothing new. His wheels were always turning. Tony thought they even turned in his sleep. Tony watched them turn, not dropping his eyes, but not giving him anything either. This was all he would give him. If Howard said no, if he didn’t agree to the terms Tony had laid out, he would just leave. He’d turn back around, leave the keys to his car and the apartment on the table, and leave. He’d never ridden the bus before--Howard had been right about that--but he thought he could figure it out well enough to make it to Clint or Nat’s house.
“Get the fuck out of here,” Clint said, good-naturedly, flapping his hand at the group like they were nothing more than a bunch of troublesome flies.
for fuck’s sake. Sure, he may not have come out of that one unscathed, but he was doing okay. Mostly.
“I’m serious, Steve,” Tony said.  “I have heard more than one rousing speech out of your mouth, so don’t sit there and act like you don’t know how to talk.”
Tony let his head fall back. He knotted one hand in Steve’s hair. The other scrabbled uselessly, thoughtlessly against the wood of the door behind him. He felt like all reason had deserted him. All higher functions. Ego? Superego? Fuck ‘em. He was all id now. Cavorting and clamoring for instant gratification, shouting out its desires in full voice.
"You would, huh?" Steve asked, a blush heating his cheeks.  He hoped he was the only one Tony talked to like this when he was on his meds, but judging from the sly smiles the nurses gave him when he passed them in the hallways, he was not.
He waved and nodded.  He turned back to Tony and clasped his hand briefly.  “I’ll bring Stephen.  We’ll figure this out.”
He tossed his keys into the bowl at the door, feeling a familiar pang when no Sir Purr came running, then went to the bedroom.  Steve wasn't there, but the mirror was still fogged over from his shower, the scent of Skin Bracer sharp and intoxicating in the air.
Steve nodded, pressed his forehead against Tony’s. “I will.” He touched Tony’s chest with his hand, felt the edge of his own dog-tags beneath Tony’s shirt. “I promise.”
the thought of private school. He knew he was destined for the Ivy League after graduation, and he wanted to spend as much time being a regular kid as he could before he was set on the path of the Ivies, followed by Stark Industries, followed by...death. Fifty cold years and three heart attacks later, if he was to follow in his father’s footsteps like the old man wanted.
.  Once.  They both had.  But seeing him here in the window, told Tony once and for all that neither of them really belonged here anymore.  But here they were.  They hadn’t been together in this room since before the final fight.  Since before Steve died.
“Especially in public,” Steve went on.  “That old lady in the grocery store yesterday was about a second away from whacking me over the head with her cane.”
he had gotten so lucky.  It was a funny thought, considering where they were currently sitting, but it was there, all the same.
“No,” he said, and his voice was rigid.  Unshakable.  “It has to be for you.  I won’t do it if it’s for me.”
the work. He needed to work. He needed to keep his mind busy, and all he had was work. Because he didn’t date. He didn’t have the time. Or the desire. He needed work. Just work.
Stane grunted, and glanced at the boy who was apparently his godson. “Tony has no manners or tact and confuses that with charm,” he said. “Isn’t that right, Tony?”
Steve smiled and laid his head down onto the table, resting it on top of their clasped hands. “You deserve a damn medal for all you put up with from me,” he said.
The bed was large, but the room itself was sparse, almost monastic.  There was a dresser.  A chair.  A TV.  It was very much like the room Steve had lived in at the hospital.  Steve might have thought so, too.  His eyes moved restlessly, taking in the familiar walls, the bed, the few books on the shelf.  A lone Yankees pennant hung on the wall.
“‘Kay,” Tony said, and stepped back. Finally. Back toward the iron railing. “Well, guess I’ll see you in the morning, then. Like at ten?”
The warehouse buried in ivy would make a gorgeous picture.  Tony could hang it in the garage next to the one of the Bentley and the half dozen others he had begged, sweet-talked, or outright stolen from Steve over the months they’d been together.
“I’m not accusing her of anything,” Bruce said in a neutral tone.  “I’m just pointing out that she’s not completely innocent.”
.” He held Tony tighter, and now there was no way to stop the tears. They came hard and fast. “We graduate in two days. Me and my mom are leaving as soon as the ceremony is over. We’ll be gone for three weeks, and by the time we get back, you’ll be gone. Then by the time
They both got to their feet and slouched out of the cell. None of the other guys even looked their way. Neither Tony nor Sam looked back. They just followed the officer back down to the outer office. Tony didn’t look up on the way either. He just watched his feet, how they automatically moved one in front of the other. He would have walked that same way if he were going down a country highway, or a church aisle, or the long green hallway that led down to the electric chair.
It didn’t take long to take care of things, and six hours later, everyone was assembled on the rooftop deck of the Tower, beers on ice, burgers on the grill, Bruce’s pasta salad sequestered in a cooler away from everyone’s stealthy, olive-filching fingers.
“It’s okay,” Steve said, and while the pout was still there, it was now duking it out with a smile. The same smile that was always there whenever he looked at Tony. Soft and adoring.
He watched her drive away, then got into his own car.  It was a Ferrari.  He’d retired the Bentley for the moment.  It didn’t feel right without Steve in the passenger seat.  He keyed the engine into loud, growling life and pulled out of the lot.  He drove home fast.  Not because there was anyone there to meet him, just because he wanted to.  There was something about the city that just made him want to go fast.
him.  Steve deserved so much more.  He deserved someone who would fight tooth and nail to keep him, not run away when the going got rough.
“I love you,” he breathed, as his hands slipped under Tony’s shirt.  “I love you so much, Tony.  I’ve never loved anything the way I love you.”
Natasha shot him a venomous look.  Tony was very glad Bruce had asked that question and not him.  Although, he wouldn’t want to be in his shoes right now.
Steve’s face was drawn and uncertain.  He was listening, though, the full force of  his concentration fixed on Tony.  That hadn’t happened very many times over the years they’d known each other.  Usually at least part of his mind was elsewhere.  Tony remembered trying to get his attention, snarking, taunting, doing everything he could think of to get those eyes on him, that laser-focus on him.  When he succeeded, when he had it, it was thrilling.  And terrifying.  It still was.
“This is Secretary Ross.  I need a police escort for one Steven Grant Rogers.  He needs to be taken into custody.  He just assaulted me at Tony Stark’s country residence.”
Tony rubbed his face with one hand and drummed the fingers of his other against Steve’s thigh.  “Okay,” he said, sighing.  “Okay.  It’s okay.”
Tony turned his head enough to brush his lips against Steve’s arm. The skin beneath his lips was smooth like silk. Soft like silk. “I was just thinking,” he sighed.
Weak laughter bubbled out of Steve’s mouth.  “Probably not as many times as I’m going to.  If you ever let me.”
Tony smiled up at him, and Steve's heart was lighter, heavier, brighter, darker.  It beat in his chest like a thunder, and the sound of it in his ears was a name, just a name: Tony Tony Tony.
Steve stepped closer.  “Of course, I do,” he said.  “I always need you.  I’ll never not need you.  But he’s your best friend, and you two have known each other a lot longer than you and I have.”
“I mean, what if you went to Sam and Nat’s, and got all your stuff, and you brought all your stuff here, and, you know, you
He knew it was supposed to be one of the most brilliant films ever made. He knew it spoke volumes about man’s journey through birth, life, and death...or something?
He sat up straight, and then she was there, crawling into his lap, curling herself into a tight ball, sobbing helplessly into his thigh.  Steve wrapped his arms around her and held her fast.  “Shh,” he soothed, tenderly rubbing her back in a way Tony remembered his mother doing with him after a fight with Howard.  “Shh, red, it’s okay.  Everything’s okay.”
Tony came out of the bedroom, leaving Steve napping on their bed.  Nat, Sam, and Bruce had cleaned up the crystal shards and finished the dishes but were nowhere to be seen.  He went outside and saw them loading their go-bags into Bruce’s Prius.
She reached out and grasped Steve’s hand in her free one. The bus was sitting at the curb, idling in the early-morning dim. Other families crowded around their own departing soldiers, little knots of people hugging and kissing young men and women who all looked excited but nervous, their eyes making darting little glances at the bus and their watches, gauging the last few seconds they had before they were swallowed up inside of it and taken to the airport where they would fly to Georgia.
Tony let out a breath, raising an eyebrow.  Steve didn't ask for that very often, and Tony craved it when he did, so he would say yes, no matter what.  Of course, he would. He would
When she finally released him, she touched his face again, then his shoulders, almost as if she was reassuring herself that he was still there, still there and whole. She kept her hand on his arm even as she kissed Tony again, giving him a dazzling smile. “Come inside,” she said. “Everybody’s in here.”
It wasn’t the first time this had happened. It had been during one of these times that Pietro had finally gotten fed up and decided to call it quits. Steve had understood. He really had. Thinking back on it, he could see how badly he’d treated Pietro, especially in the weeks leading up to their break-up. Could see how little he’d given him. How short he’d been with him. How he’d spent more time with his mother and Sam or Bucky than with the guy he was supposed to be in love with.
Steve blinked, surprised, but the corner of his mouth quirked up too. “I don’t really think I’m crazy,” he said. “Just like to get up early.”
Steve snuggled his head deeper into Tony’s stomach. “You think you know,” he murmured, and when Tony chuckled and kissed the top of his head, Steve let his eyes fall closed.
Even to his own ears, it sounded like too much.  It sounded like more emotion than a first kiss should illicit, and he loosened his grip on Tony’s waist and stepped back.  “I’m sorry,” he said.
He stopped talking. Tony could see a fine sheen of sweat covering his forehead now. His grip was tight to the point of pain, but Tony didn’t even try to get him to let go. “Steve,” he began, “you don’t have to-”
by you too. For the same reason. And I realized I’d misjudged you. And I kind of wanted to make it up to you, ‘cause that thing? That connection? It didn’t go away when I realized it was you. It got stronger. And I wanted to try and make things easier for you, if I could. If you’d let me. I wanted to-” he squeezed Tony’s hand, “-make you smile. For real, though. Not the PR one you gave the waitress. A real one.”
She came into the lab, hard eyes softening as they took in Steve’s sleeping image.  She’d know about the worried look, of course.  She’d shared his bed far longer than Tony ever had.
Gggaaaaaahhhhh. I'm the worst. I have re-written this five hundred times in my head, and five times in reality. It's not done. There's still some left on this section, but I have to get this away from me. I can't re-write it anymore. So, here's this part of the section. I'll post the second part of it in a couple days as a new chapter. If you want to wait and read them both together as one, that would totally work, but I think this was the best breaking-point. Sorry.
,” she said, and sat back next to Sam. She put her head on his shoulder and curled against him like a cat. He slipped his arm comfortably around her shoulders and rested his head on top of hers.
Howard looked down at his own hands, then nodded again. “You really are right, Steven. She and I have nothing in common.”
, they were still together.  He hoped Steve would keep that in mind while he was locked away.  Like a tiger in a cage.
miles per hour--to do that. But then he’d have to deal with all kinds of paradoxes and time-travel issues…”
Tony expected him to be angry, maybe even yell at him. They’d certainly done it before--descending into shouting matches--but not this time. This time, Steve curled his arm tighter around Tony’s body, and kissed the top of his head instead. “I know,” he said. “I’m sorry.”
Tony couldn’t take it anymore. “What the fuck are you doing?” he asked, and even though he wanted it to come out a furious shout, in actuality, it just sounded bewildered.
Steve fell back a step. It almost felt like Tony had punched him in the face. “Oh,” he muttered. “Oh. Okay. Okay. Sorry.” He blinked, kept his head down, then shrugged past Tony and down the hall.
He was both thrilled and frightened of seeing him.  Of seeing him here in this place so far away from anywhere and any context in which he’d seen him before.  Of course, he’d seen him in a hospital--had spent a month beside his bed in one not very long ago--but this was different.  That Steve, while physically broken, had still been
“When we fight,” Steve began, “we’re going to win.  Everyone’s going to come home.  I know it.  I feel it.  Don’t you?”
Steve lowered his head, looking at Tony from under his lush eyelashes. “Me too. For a long time now. A really long time.”
.--to the lonely, cold, frightening time he’d spent at The Raft.  It’s what she wanted for Ross.  To be treated the same.  To be pumped full of drugs until he barely knew his own name, then shoved away in a dark, dank hole.  It was what he deserved.  Better than he deserved.  Strange had thought of this.  What they were doing now.  Coming in here, forcibly removing Ross from the house, threatening him, then bringing him publicly, loudly to justice for his crimes.
“I’m going to go check the download, alright?” she said.  “You’re going to be quiet, aren’t you, Doctor?”
Quick as a cat, she came for him.  She ducked his fist and pounced on his back.  Although she was agile and light, he was still able to grab her arm.  She hit him twice in the face, sacrificing power for speed, and he threw her to the ground, pinning her again.
Tony laughed, and sat down on the bed with a bounce. It creaked a little--not much, but enough--and Tony laughed again. “I was kind of thinking about Mrs. Perkins...you know?”
, finally, nibbling it, tonguing it, with Steve’s hand on the back of his head, and Steve’s breath in his ear.  “And then we see how many times I can make you come before one of us passes out.”
Tony sat in the middle of them all, holding court like a king. He was their center. The hub of all the activity around him. The funniest, the wildest, the most beautiful of the beautiful people, and Steve wasn’t the only person in the room who stared whenever he was around. He wasn’t the only person staring now. Glancing around the room, at least a dozen others were staring at Tony. Steve could see the same look that was currently on his own face on their faces too, so he felt safe staring a little. If Tony felt eyes on him, Steve had only a one in thirteen chance of Tony catching him, so yeah, he felt safe. After all, who was he now? Just some guy. Steve had been right. Tony hadn’t recognized him. Hadn’t remembered him. In spite of their close friendship before, now he was just some guy in a sea of people busy eating and talking and bitching about homework assignments and football games.
Josh had moved away from him a bit, but now he cuddled closer again. He was Tony’s height. Thin, lithe, dark hair, green eyes. Very red lips. Very easy to look at. They had met in chemistry class, and Tony had been intrigued by how intelligent he was. How he was always either a point ahead or a point behind Tony when their grades were posted. He’d asked him out for a drink six months ago, and when Josh asked him back to his apartment afterward, Tony had said yes with no qualms. And why not? He and Pepper saw each other a little, but it wasn’t exclusive. Neither one of them were very interested in being exclusive with each other at this point in their lives, and he always carried plenty of condoms, so he was happy to go up to Josh’s room with him. Happy to get on his knees for a while. Happy to roll one of those condoms onto his cock and--even though he usually preferred to be the fuckee instead of the fucker when it came to men--slide into Josh, making him moan out his name.
Steve’s tears caught in the moonlight coming through the window. They left shining tracks down his once-pale cheeks. He clutched Tony’s hand in his. “A family,” he said in a quavering voice, that came through the smile still on his lips. “That’s great, Tony. Really.” He shook his head and breathed out. He didn’t brush his tears away. He must have known there would be no point. “I can’t give you that. I could never give you that.” He kissed Tony’s hand again, pressing his lips hard against his fingers. “See?” he said when he pulled away. “It really is for the best.”
Steve smiled and slipped closer to Tony, resting more fully against him.  He rubbed his cheek against Tony’s shoulder, then kissed it and closed his eyes.
Steve hummed against him, and the vibration of his lips sent a jolt down Tony’s spine. “Yeah,” Steve breathed. “Talking. Or something.”
worked. When Steve slid it across the table to him at the end of lunch hour, Tony smiled and told him he liked it. He folded it up carefully and tucked it away in his backpack. The smile went with it, though. Tony looked sad again as soon as it was out of sight, and that made Steve sad again.
“Yeah, to our faces, but they all would have gone home wishing they’d thought of it.” Tony wiped his mouth with a cheap little napkin. “Then they’d all do it for their next party. We’d be trend-setters.”
Nat walked over and crouched beside him.  She lifted her hand and Doctor Baxter cowered back as far as his restraints allowed.  It wasn’t much.  She’d tied them tight.
Steve grasped Tony’s arms in his hands and tried to catch his eye.  “You’re not, but I am.  I signed up for this.  A few times.”  He laughed a little.  “I said I was from
“Getting ready,” Tony snapped. “God, if I’d known this was how this call was going to go down, I would have put on something a little sexier than Batman pajama bottoms and an old t-shirt.”
Her eyes grew dark.  He remembered that look.  It was a dangerous look.  “I run our business, Tony.  And that has nothing to do with this.”
“We don’t have to do it again,” Tony said, and how had Steve never fully appreciated just how deep and
Steve shook his head. “No,” he answered, and swiped at his eyes. “It wasn’t good, Tony.” He reverently took the ring out of the box, handed it to Tony, and held out his hand so Tony could slip it onto his finger. “It was perfect.”
Yeah. Essential. Those moments when Steve was just sitting with him. Just holding him. Just lying with his feet in Tony’s lap while they listened to music or watched some stupid show on tv. They were essential. Steve was essential.
Tony thought of Ross.  Of the one other thing they had agreed to.  The one truly personal thing that Tony had insisted upon before their deal was complete.
But it wasn’t Sergeant Rogers that stopped on the side of the road on the way to some busywork assignment. It was Steve. Sergeant Rogers would not have stopped. Steve had to.
“Honey,” she sobbed, and collapsed into his arms, clutching him around the neck, crying into his shoulder.
“Fuck,” Tony muttered.  “You’re right.  That’s not enough.  They’re the most trafficked mammal in the
“I wouldn’t say that,” Tony breathed against him, then ran his tongue along the column of his throat.  Steve moaned, fisting his hand in Tony’s hair.  “I just wondered what the...situation is,” Tony said.  “Can you…” He looked at Steve and raised an eyebrow.  “
Sam put a hand to his forehead and rubbed his temples. “Christ, you two are stupid,” he murmured incredulously.
Tony threw himself to the side, the razor, meant to deliver a killing slash, grazed his cheek instead.  He felt his skin part, felt the blood as it began to flow.
Tony brought Steve’s hand to his mouth and kissed the knuckles.  “I know, baby.  I know there’s something wrong.  Bruce and I talked about it, and he’s bringing help, okay?  We’re going to get you sorted out.”
“Take your clothes off,” Tony said. Steve sat up on his knees, straddling one of Tony’s thighs, and started to strip his shirt off, but Tony put his hand on his arm and he stopped. “Wait, nevermind,” Tony said, bending his knee to rub against him. “Finish taking mine off first. I can’t wait anymore. I need your hands on me.”
He fought his way back from the cold, from that lonely, dark bunker where he and Tony--his friend, his
Steve smiled at him, suddenly looking nervous. “No. We should, but…” His eyes connected with Tony’s, jumped nimbly away, then came back.
“This house contains sensitive, top-secret Avengers-related information.  It is essentially an Avengers outpost.”  There was a gleam in his eye as Ross spoke, one that was dark and capering.  “As per our agreement,  you are not allowed in any building that houses Avengers’ material.”
Silence around him.  Before, FRIDAY would speak now, asking how he was then wishing him a nice afternoon when he got off.  Instead, that other voice came back.  “Rogers.  Steven, Grant.  Access Code 112-A accepted.”
Nat touched his wrist.  “You should.  You’ve been a hermit the last couple months.  You need to see people.”
Steve’s mind went blank. For a moment, he was once again back on the floor with that can of tomatoes. He looked down at his hands--just in case--but the Lucky Charms leprechaun was grinning cheekily up at him, promising that his breakfast was going to be magically delicious. It wasn’t tomatoes. It wasn’t.
“‘Kay,” Steve said, and held him. Just held him, breathing with him, surrounding him with security, and strength, and...something else.
Gina tugged Tony closer and put her head on his shoulder.  It was a quietly possessive gesture, one Tony wasn’t even sure she knew she was making.  “Oh.  That’s nice.  Are you in town for Christmas?”
His head was reeling. It was such a switch. Going from thinking Steve didn’t want him at all to this. This gentle look. This soft, hesitant touch of his hand. And Christ, wasn’t that the way it had always been between them? Hot and cold. Red light, green light. Never steady, no way of knowing exactly where they stood from one moment to the next. Part of him loved it. Loved playing the game. But another part of him didn’t want to play anymore. That part just wanted something sure. Stable.
Tony stood up and took Steve’s hand. He wasn’t going to let this chance go by. A chance for them to be together. Alone. Without sitting in bucket seats with a gear-shift between them. Especially since it was Steve who had suggested it. Tony would give him anything he wanted.
“I’m thinking about her again,” he said, and pleasure so intense it bordered on pain exploded through him. “Stop,” he said weakly. “Stop, or I’m going to come and then this will be over. I’m not twenty anymore, Steve, in case you didn’t notice.”
“Um,” he said, and tore his eyes away from Steve’s with a Herculean effort. He squeezed his daughter’s hand, using it to bring himself back to the here and now. It worked. Just enough. “Remember what you’re supposed to do before petting a dog?” he asked, and she smiled up at him, brighter than the sun that was still playing teasing games with the clouds.
He pulled back long enough to say, “Let’s get rid of this,” then pulled Tony’s shirt over his head and tossed it away.  He bent over Tony’s chest, kissed the arc reactor, then licked the scarred flesh around it, worshipping it with his tongue.  From the reactor, Steve moved on to Tony’s nipple.  He took it in his mouth, grazing it with his teeth until it pebbled.  Tony muttered, “Oh god, baby, yes,” under his breath, unaware he had even spoken as Steve turned his attention to the other one.  He caught it between his teeth, then ran his tongue over it.  Tony fisted his hand in Steve’s hair and held him in place with a guttural moan.
He didn’t really have the words to say that, though. It seemed too hard, too strange a question to ask someone--
?” Tony asked. He sounded tired. And sad. Steve wanted to kill whoever it was that made him sound like that. Even if it was himself. He’d die if it meant Tony didn’t sound so defeated anymore. It would be worth it.
“I’ve had a good run,” he told Tony, brushing his fingertips along the arm that held him. “Especially last night.  With you.  I’d be going out on a high, you know?”
“‘Truth, justice, and the American way’, Fury?  Don’t throw taglines in my face and call them ideals.”
“I know a place.  It’s an old-timey diner.  Right up your alley.  They have amazing fried chicken, and since Barton ate my KFC…”
Tony grinned, relieved in spite of himself.  “Fuck regrets, huh?” he said, and they sat smiling at each other while the birds sang, and the lake lapped at the sandy shore.  It was a good moment.  Quiet and good.
Sitting here now, Tony knew Strange had been right to stop him from out and out murder.  He didn’t like it, but he knew it.  However, he wasn’t sure if the plan they had come up with was right, either.  He wasn’t sure if, when he had the chance to think it over later, if Steve, himself, would approve.
Tony took a step toward him, reached out his hand to take Steve’s, but then Howard called, “Tony. Time’s up. Get in the car.”
Tony would run, but he didn’t know, and he didn’t want to take the chance of losing him just when things were getting so good.
His left hand clenched automatically. He looked at the fingers. Thought about how long it had taken him to get used to wearing a wedding band once upon a time. And then how long it had taken him to get used to
“Shut up, Buck,” Steve said, and out of the corner of his eye--sometimes he fucking hated peripheral vision--he saw Tony’s date kiss his cheek, then his ear.
It was given out to the public that Thaddeus Ross had decided to take an extended leave from his post in Washington.  A year’s sabbatical to spend time in quiet contemplation, and then he would return, if the country still needed and wanted him.  The press conference had been a good one.  There were tears and a long ovation at the end, and a half-hearted hug from the president himself, who said, of course, Ross could come back.  The country would always need him, always want him.
It was a Lexus, low-slung and sexy, but not as flashy as the Bentley even for all its fresh-off-the-lot newness.  It had D.C. plates.  Tony’s brow furrowed and he wished heartily for a gauntlet.
“What do you need from me?” Strange asked.  “A character reference?  Medical records?  What does he need?  I’ll do what I can for him.”
Steve nodded again. It was enough, he supposed. It had to be. There was no other answer but that plain and simple one.
Tony drew in a deep breath. “I loved you so much back then. I didn’t think it was possible for me to love you any more than I did then.”
Tony gave her his most sincere Stark smile.  It had gotten him a long way during his lifetime.  Jarvis had been immune, but his mother had been a sucker for it.  As had all the pretty coeds, both male and female, he’d talked into bed his junior and senior years at school.  After that, he’d pretty much dropped the sincerity and just went full-on selfish.  The irony was, he got laid twice as much.  Of course, the money and the drugs may have had something to do with that.
Steve was across the room before either of them knew he was moving.  Tony flinched as Steve’s large hand closed over his elbow, but he didn’t pull away.  Steve’s touch was gentle.
Tony twined his fingers of one hand with Steve’s, but lifted the other and rubbed his temples. “Oh, don’t say that, Steve. That kid was so fucked up.”
,” Tony said, and Steve laughed again. God, Tony loved it when he laughed. Loved being the thing that made him laugh.
Sam nodded, and then she was hugging him, and kissing him fiercely once before smacking him on the arm and starting in with the lecture. Tony could tell it was a lecture. But he could also tell that it was a gentle one. He looked hopefully at Steve.
“Good.  You don’t have any reason to be.”  He reached back and touched Tony’s hand.  “It’s only you.  It’s only
Tony came into the bathroom and leaned over the back of the chair.  He put his arms around Steve’s broad shoulders and nibbled at his neck under his right ear.  It was a good spot.  It was his spot.  He’d claimed it the night before when kissing it, Steve had clutched his hair, held his head in place, and told him--not asked, told him--not to stop.
Tony crawled up and pressed his lips against Steve’s.  Steve pulled him on top of his chest and kissed him hungrily back.  His eyes were closed, but his mouth devoured Tony’s by touch alone, his tongue licking into his soft, wet heat.
Tony stood in front of him, worked his magic in the form of the Eldredge Knot, then turned Bruce toward the mirror.  “How’s that?”
“Tony,” she said patiently.  “This is one of the reasons why he didn’t want to tell you he was going.  Don’t you get that?”
Her eyes were dark and still hollow with sleep as she looked down at him. “Honey, you need to get up. Both of you. Tony’s father is here.”
.  It was his heart.  The serum hadn’t changed that.  It had enhanced his body, but not his spirit.  That was all him.
He heard movement at the end of the hallway, and he leaned against the sink, waiting. He didn’t even try to make it look like he wasn’t. Why should he hide it? He’d been waiting for fifteen years.
She looked at him with flat worry. He knew she came by it honestly, but he still felt bad that it was there. That he'd put it there. “You can talk to me, honey,” she said, gripping his hand in hers. “You know that, don't you? I want you to talk to me when you need to. Anytime. About anything.”
And while neither man would ever say so to anyone, not even themselves, they both felt a little piece of themselves crumble away, lost to the love of another man.
He led him by the hand into the bedroom the way he had always done. He watched Tony strip off his jacket and shirt. Watched him sit on the edge of the bed and kick his shoes off. Watched as he slid easily back until his head was on the pillow, then raised his hand to Steve, opening it and closing it a few times in a silent request--command?--for him to join him. And Steve did. He didn’t bother with his clothes. He just took Tony’s hand and climbed onto the bed after him. He laid down, tucking his head up under Tony’s chin, and held him.
Halfway through, he heard Tony’s voice through the closed door, and relief flooded through him. Tony was here. Finally. He didn’t know why he’d been afraid he wouldn’t come, but he had been. It was silly, feeling like that, but he had. He knew this was hard for Tony. They hadn’t talked about it much--Tony didn’t want to--but he’d been clingy and on-edge all week. He’d pick a fight with Steve just to fight, then at bedtime, crawl up into his lap and kiss him senseless, apologizing over and over for being a moody asshole.
Tony stood up and switched seats easily, slipping into the one beside him.  He raised the armrest so there was no barrier between them.  He touched Steve’s shoulder.  Shook him gently.  He wasn’t afraid.  He’d never believed those old-wives tales about waking someone having a nightmare.
“It isn’t, though,” Steve said, looking at him from the corner of his eye. “You made plans, and reservations and stuff, and went to all this trouble…” He tugged at his hair again, fretfully. “This sucks, Tony. I’m so sorry.”
Steve shrugged.  “Go back to work.  They still need you.  I know Fury wants you back.  I heard him ask you.”
Steve looked at him from the corner of his eye. His head was lowered, that little smile still on his lips. “How do you do that?” he asked quietly.
Tony wet his lips, put his hand on Steve’s thigh.  “She’s going to fix you,” he said.  “Magic all that bad shit right out of your head.”
Tony wanted to grab him and shake him, but instead, he put his hand on Steve’s back.  Gently.  He moved his thumb in little, soothing arcs.  “I don’t like it,” he whispered, and Steve turned his head to meet his eye.  The humor was gone.  Now he looked sad, sadness touched with worry.  Tony edged closer.  “Will you please put it out?”
Tony gave him a peculiar smile. One he could not completely read. “The plan is the same,” Tony said. “I’m just thinking about changing the venue.”
Clint stood up.  His fingers brushed the salt again.  “Do you think they’re hurting?  Wherever they are?”
Thor put his hand on Steve’s shoulder.  “Many of those I love are gone, as well.  Our reasons to go to war may change, but rarely the need for it.  It’s our duty to find some reason, however small, to keep fighting.”
“More than anything,” Steve said, and he could hear the same desperation in his own voice. The same need. The same hot, wild craving. “Tony. Tony, I want you so much. I want all of you. I want to feel you, and taste you. I wanna lay you down and...and--oh god, Tony.”
Tony latched onto Steve’s arm and shook it with gleeful joy.  “I knew it!” he crowed.  “I knew you thought of him as our baby.”  He drug Sir Purr over Steve’s lap and into his own arms to cuddle him.  “Did you hear that, Sir Purr?  Daddy
Okay, here's another one that I have to get away from me. This is really only half the chapter, but I'm splitting it up for my own peace of mind. I'll post the next half in a few days. I'm shooting for Thursday. Let's see if I make it.
“Fair enough,” Tony said.  He put the soldering iron down and adjusted some miniscule bit of wire by hand.  “It’s none of my business, whatever’s with you and Nat,” he said.  “I didn’t mean to say anything bad about her.  You know that, right?”
Tony gave him a withering look over his shoulder, but slid off of Steve’s lap. He took his hand away from his mouth too. Tony had a feeling he might have overstepped a line here. A line that he was not one hundred percent sure who had drawn. And maybe he immediately missed the feeling of closeness between them, the way Steve’s chest had felt pressed up against his own, the beat of his heart, the heat of his breath, the sparkle in his eyes, but Tony would never tell anyone that. He’d just keep it to himself. Being with Steve--really being
His eyes were drawn back to that hand lying on the cushion.  How could a hand that crafted such dangerous, wonderful things look so innocent and defenseless?  Steve’s own hands began to shake, and he watched, mesmerized, as his finger reached out toward Tony’s.  It touched the pads of each of Tony’s fingers in turn, then slipped into the curve of his palm and lightly traced the lines that crisscrossed the surface.
--here with him. Thinking how it had felt to be in his arms, to have his fingers in his hair and caressing his neck. Thinking about the way he smelled. How big he was. How solid. How warm. How sweet.
“Yup. Eat,” he said, then scowled at the coffee cup half-hidden behind a small pile of scrap metal. “And no more coffee. There’s water in the fridge.”
Steve cocked his head. “I think ‘long lost evil twin’ might take precedence over me swimming naked, Tony.”
“I just-” his eyes flicked to Tony again. Tony’s were still on him. His mouth was still doing that little thing, that little smile, but now it seemed more amused, like he was enjoying this show immensely. A hot blush crept out of Steve’s collar. “I just gotta go. See you later,” he said, and then he was running--
Tony nodded. He inched closer to Steve, held his hand tighter. “When I was finally able to, I ran over to her. She was starting to move by then. She started taking in these big gasps of air, and crying.” He shook his head again. “She said my name. Or, like,
“Nothing happened while we were together, Pepper,” he said.  “Please, honey, you’ve got to believe me.”
She got up in a slow stretch of limbs and crossed the deck to where Steve now stood. She didn’t say anything, just wrapped him in a hug from behind and settled her cheek on his back.
“Hey,” Steve said, and Tony looked up, his hand hovering over the screen.  “Make sure you do it anonymously.”
a genius, after all. “Come here,” he said, and kissed Steve’s sweet mouth. When he pulled back, Tony touched Steve’s kiss-swollen bottom lip. “They cheated,” he said, and Steve laughed again.
He thought about the hours that lay ahead, the long empty hours, the days, the weeks, the years.  All of the time he had left to think about the way Steve felt in his arms, his eyes, his smile, his kiss…
Tony watched him sleep.  Watched the rise and fall of his chest, the twitch of his fingers, the subtle movement behind his closed lids as his brain shifted into the REM cycle.  What would they say when they spoke?  I love you?  I need you?  I don’t want my life to be without you?  Or would it be “Thanks for the ride, Tony.  I’ll see you around”?  He had no idea.  Wasn’t sure what would be best, even now, seeing him sleeping so peacefully across from him.  What did Steve want?  Or, better question, what did Steve
He smiled, feeling lighter than he had for a long time. Between her and Tony, he felt almost light enough to float away. “Can I color with you?” he asked, and she nodded. She was smiling now too. And god, that made him even lighter. “How ‘bout the blue?” he asked. “Can I have the blue?”
And then he was there, standing in the doorway smiling, and Tony let the breath out, calm rolling over him. That was new too. Nobody settled him the way Steve settled him.
“And on that note.” Tony stood up smoothly from Natasha’s lap and straightened the lapels of his jacket. “I’ll talk to Happy in a minute and make sure all’s well. I’ve got FRIDAY vetting all the wait-staff and caterers. There had to be an inside man. But you two,” he said sternly, “need to chill out and enjoy the party.”
Steve put his hand over Tony’s.  “Yeah.  That’d be nice.  If we could take a little time.  Just us.”  His eyes darkened a little.  “If that’s okay?  You don’t mind it just being the two of us for a while again, do you?”
Nick jotted a few notes, asked a couple follow-up questions, then told him he could go. Steve nodded and stood up.
He kicked his shoes off and got into the bed, climbing over Steve to get where he wanted, and pressed against him.  He threw his arm over Steve’s stomach, his leg over Steve’s leg, and nestled his head onto Steve’s shoulder.  Steve’s arms came around him, and they lay quietly together on the big bed, both crowded onto the left side, leaving Tony’s untouched.
“You look good,” Steve said.  Because that was what you said, wasn’t it?  When you saw an ex in public?
Steve frowned a little, looking at him, scrutinizing his face, and if anything, the frown only made him look even more beautiful. More perfect. “You’re okay though, right?” he asked.
kill you, Barton’,” he mimicked, and Natasha shook her head, as they manhandled Baxter into the back of their transport.  She couldn’t help the faint blush that crept up onto her cheeks or the way her mouth curved into a small, secret smile.  He was teasing.  She knew that.  But there was an under-current of jealousy there, too.  Hearing it was as good as the thought of three weeks lounging beach-side with her tan, decidedly lab-coat-free
Laura and the Tiny Bartons picked bunches of wildflowers and attached them to the chairs along the aisle and arranged some at the altar near the lake where the ceremony would take place.  When they were done, and the kids started to get bored, Bruce showed them how to fold origami cranes, and they spent the evening folding paper like mad.  One thousand made wishes come true.  They didn’t quite make it, but it was okay.  It wasn’t really the number that mattered, Bruce told the disappointed kids, kindly.  It was the feeling behind it.
“I’m a good multi-tasker,” Tony said, reaching for Steve’s waistband.  “I can jerk you off and listen at the same time.”
Tony closed his hand over the coin. It felt warm. Heavy. He tightened his grip on it. “I...I don’t really know what to say right now.”
, but no one suggested that this year, especially Tony who was generally a sucker for tradition.  At least the ones they had created together, their little Avengers family.
The rain had started a few hours ago and had not let up since.  It wasn’t a hard, pounding, driving rain, but it was persistent.  It fell in a steady drizzle.  The sound came through the open window, calming, soothing in the hour just after midnight.
Tony huddled closer against his side. He pressed his lips to his chest again. “I’m sorry too. I didn’t mean it that way. I’d never think that, baby.”
Steve knew he should protest. But he didn’t. He didn’t want to. Howard could say what he wanted, think what he wanted, and Steve knew that he was right, but right now, he didn’t care if it was selfish. He
Tony drew in a deep breath. Steve could see the wheels in his head turning. He let it happen. Just sipped his drink and let it happen. Just enjoyed the show while it lasted. He hadn’t liked the first act of tonight’s Tony Stark Show one bit, but act two certainly had its merits.
He went into the bathroom, and a minute later, Tony heard the water in the shower start drumming against the tile. Tony touched the door, let his fingers linger on it, feeling the wood grain. He’d been smiling when Steve went into the bathroom, but he wasn’t smiling anymore. His eyes flashed with bright, brilliant hate. His skin was pale but for a spot of color high on his cheekbones. His brows were drawn together in a sharp frown. If he had looked in a mirror in that moment, he would have been terrified. He had never looked more like Howard in his life.
. Like...like...Tony had no fucking clue anymore. “I’m certain he’s watching us right now,” Howard went on. “Making sure I’m being nice.”
Natasha and Sam got into the car.  Bruce hung back, accepted Tony’s hug, then said, “I’ll talk to Strange.  He’ll probably be at the Compound and I can give him an idea of what’s going on.”  He wrung his hands, looking worried.  “I hate leaving you here.  There’s something wrong, Tony.  If I didn’t know better…”
Tony nodded. “Alright. Fine. You can change it however you want. But one thing has to stay exactly where it is, okay? I insist.”
sad. He wanted him happy. He wanted him talking and happy and smiling and laughing. He didn’t like this other way. He still liked
“Don’t know,” Steve said, sipping his drink. “Maybe. Maybe Bucky and Nat thought I’d rip off their valuables or something and they hired you to come check and see.”
“And what would that be?” He heard Steve breathing behind him.  It was steady, intense, and deep.  Tony did not move his hand.
“We’ll let you in on it someday,” Steve assured him, sliding a pancake onto his plate. “And speaking of bathrooms. Remind me to get a toothbrush.”
He took her hand and led her back down the hall. “Mine are good. I make ‘em every morning. Hundreds of them.”
How many times had he thought of this?  Their bodies moving together, sliding against each other in a smooth, synchronized rhythm, their breathing raw and harsh, hands exploring, mouths open, eyes closed?  How many times had he imagined Steve writhing on a bed beneath him?  Never this bed--that had been beyond his foresight--but some bed, somewhere.  Tony’s name fell from Steve’s lips like an invocation.  Steve’s came from his own in a Pagan chant.  They mixed together to create something more holy than either ever could have achieved alone.
Dugan nodded, and Steve started back the way they had come, carrying Bucky on his back. The other men in his unit were with him. He could hear them coming along behind him, could hear their hushed voices, their shuffling steps. Steve blocked them out. He didn’t want to hear. He didn’t want to see. He kept his eyes forward.
“I know,” he said. “I know you have to work, but...don’t you think you should come with me? This is hard on Mom. She needs us.”
“Yeah, but maybe it would have been easier.”  He looked down at his hands again.  “If I hadn’t...that way, you and Pepper…”
Steve smiled against him and his hand slipped underneath Tony’s shirt to touch the bare skin of his back.
Steve closed his arms tighter.  “Nobody’s going to...talk about it, are they?” he asked.  “I don’t want to talk about it.”
“Not too slow,” Steve said quietly, urgently.  He put his hand in Tony’s hair.  “Please.  Okay, Tony?  I need you.”
He took the chicken out of the fridge and pounded it thin, then set up a breading station--flour, beaten egg, Panko bread crumbs--and breaded the chicken.
Steve felt a flash of anger at the word, but immediately following that, coolness flowed over him. He welcomed it. Sometimes he hated it. Especially when it happened when he was talking to his mom or Pietro, but this time, he embraced it whole-heartedly, because it meant Steve Rogers was no longer in charge. Sergeant Rogers was.
When Steve finally closed the cover, Tony volunteered to do the dishes. Steve helped, drying and putting things away, watching with an amused eye while Tony splashed around in the suds like a kid. Steve thought it was pretty obvious Tony had never washed dishes before, but he was glad he enjoyed it as much as he seemed to.
We're getting closer to the end, guys, but there's still a little ways to go.  Thanks for sticking with me through the ups and downs!
“We should do it this year,” Tony said.  “All of us.  Christmas tree, presents, Santa, the whole business.”
Tony laughed.  “Fuck no!  John McClane would have beat the shit out of Cal, steered the ship himself, and gotten everybody to New York in time for happy hour.”
Steve ran a quick hand through his hair, over his eyes, scrubbed across his cheek. Tony could see the lines of exhaustion around his eyes and mouth. “I should go, I guess,” he said. “Mom and Sam wanted me to go home and rest for a little while. I wasn’t going to, but maybe I will.”
“Come here,” he murmured, and Steve came to him, giving in to Tony’s insistent fingers until they stood flush against each other.  Steve, taller, broader, looming over Tony’s slighter frame.
Steve stood up, and brushed his hands on his jeans. Not like it mattered. His jeans were as wet as Dodger’s fur had been. Dodger looked up at him, dancing on his paws, and Steve jerked his head. “Go on,” he said, and Dodger barked once and ran away, Morgan following, laughing and calling him.
Tony fell quickly back to sleep, but for Steve, it wasn’t so easy. He lay quietly, drawing in long, flat breaths, trying to calm himself. It worked--mostly--but he knew there would be no more sleep for him that night. He looked at his watch and saw that it was four AM. That didn’t seem unreasonable to him. He usually got up at five-thirty, so it was not that far off from normal, but he didn’t want to get up just yet. He wanted to lie here with Tony, feeling his heart beating against his chest, sharing his sweet bed-warmth, smelling his scent, filling his lungs with it.
“No.  Red, I don’t want you to feel those things.  I remember enough of what it was like to know I don’t want
Tony stripped his t-shirt over his head and cleaned them both up as best he could, then threw it on the floor.  He lay back down and Steve rolled them so they were on their sides, Steve pressed up against Tony’s back, his arm around him, his face in the back of Tony’s neck.
you mad? Last night? ‘Cause I know Morgan comes first, Tony. I know that. She has to. She’s your daughter. And I’m good with that, okay? I just want you to know that I’m good with that. I always will be.”
Howard continued to say nothing. He just gazed at him from over the tops of his glasses. He didn’t even reach for his drink. He just sat, looking at him. Tony didn't think he had ever had his complete and utter attention before. Yesterday--or even two hours ago--that would have meant something to him.
I debated with myself all day about that argument between them, but I decided to keep it mostly because i wanted Steve to start being strong enough to be able to stand up for himself a little, and I wanted Tony to see that Steve will always come home to him, even when there's rough times.
was the beautiful one in this situation. Perfect. Better than anything Steve had ever even imagined. Better than he deserved, he knew that. But knowing it didn’t mean he would give him up. Hell no. He would fight tooth and nail to keep him. Snarl, bite, claw,
“Doesn’t that seem a little strange?  That we’ve known each other this long and have never done this?”
Tony laughed, his eyes falling closed as sleep started to overtake him. “Sleepy-Steve is mushy-Steve. I like it.”
Steve turned abruptly and went inside. He went to bed early. The voices came through the wall, and he let them soothe him. He fell asleep quickly. There were no dreams.
So, neither of them said it. Both of them felt it, though. Both of them felt like this was the best thing they had ever had in their entire lives. And they were right.
Beside him, Wanda was as full of nervous energy as he was.  Her fingers drummed lightly against her thigh, her eyes darted from place to place, never lighting on anyone or anything for longer than a second before leaping nimbly away again.
child, hurt him. Hurt him in ways he could barely fathom. He remembered lying in bed with him, looking at him, trying so hard to not let his entire world shatter again, telling Tony he could never give him a family. That being apart was for the best because Pepper could.
More tears fell, and Steve scrubbed them away with the back of his hand. “We are? I mean, yeah. Yeah. We are.”
Tony kissed Steve again then settled back against him. The beat of his heart was soothing in his ear. The perfect sound. The perfect feeling. “Just give them to me now.”
The guy extended his hand, but he looked a little nervous. “I’m John Peterson. I’m sorry I’m late. I spoke to a Ms. Potts earlier. She said she’d explain what happened.”
“That’s right, baby,” he said, then cocked an eyebrow, letting his eyes drift down Steve’s naked form. “And, um...about that. How would you feel about wearing a cheerleader outfit at some point?”
Steve closed the compass in his fist.  “But she’s gone,” he said quietly.  “Honestly, I don’t know why I’m fighting anymore.”
After perfecting the Kevlar placement in Steve’s extremely functional uniform and sending it off to production, Tony switched to another project. And another. And another. The hours slipped by one by one, punctuated by repeated journeys to the coffee machine. Time didn’t mean much when he was working. It seemed like as soon as he stepped over the threshold into the lab, time almost ceased to exist. If he had been in the mindset to ponder that, he might have been concerned about how quickly it flew by--especially considering he was definitely not getting any younger--but he never thought about it. It never even entered his mind. Time didn’t matter when it was well-spent. Or at least when he was keeping busy. He liked to stay busy. Up until Steve had come into his life, ‘busy’ had always been his favorite state of being. He had never enjoyed downtime before. Downtime was a
They had gotten intel of hostile activity in a small town a few miles from camp, and Colonel Phillips sent Steve and his unit to check it out. He didn’t actually think there was much to it, but he sent them anyway. Ever since 9/11, every bit of intel was checked out, even if it was just rumor. And there was another reason too. The month or two around the holidays were hard ones. Everyone was missing home. Missing their parents, their spouses, their hometowns. Phillips kept them moving as often as he could. Kept them busy. Busy hands made for peaceful minds. Or productive minds, anyway.
“Umm. That’s great.” He folded the sheet with jerky movements. “I’ll clean this up,” he said quickly. “I shouldn’t have it out. I know. I’m sorry. I just...I’ll clean it up. Okay? Sorry. I didn’t think you’d be home for a while. I’m sorry.”
Steve thought of her again, thought of her red lips, how they’d tasted.  His hand still tingled.  He clenched his fist and another jolt of that raw, powerful electricity ran up his arm.  “No,” he whispered.  “She was anything but that.”
They held each other tightly, Steve in his sleep, Tony on the verges of it, and that sense of rightness was so intense, so heightened, that Tony could not hold it in anymore.
Steve stopped laughing. A smile remained around his mouth, but his eyes were sharp and alert. “You’re serious.”
Tony could smell the scent of his lingering aftershave, feel the heat from his shoulder pressing into his. He could also sense how sorry Steve really was. Tony knew he was. It was written in every syllable he said, every breath he took.
Tony and Sam sat next to each other, a couple of drunks and a twitchy little drug-dealer sat across the way. None of them spoke. None of them had spoken for a while. That was good, too. Tony didn’t want to listen to some guy on a meth-addled tirade. He didn’t want to listen to anything. He just wanted to sit quietly and wait for the cavalry.
“Thanks,” Tony said.  “Call me, or come over, or whatever.  Pepper’s access code will get you in.  I’ll tell FRIDAY.”
At the end of his shift, Steve put it all away. He put away his knives, and his apron, and his thoughts. He put it all away. He had other stuff he had to attend to right now. Other stuff that needed his full attention.
“Then you shouldn’t go tomorrow,” she said, curling up against his side. “Daddy will get lonely when you’re gone. You need to stay
a compliment. And I owe you another one too,” he went on, sitting back and crossing his legs. “Your mother showed me some of your work the other night.”
“Rhodey,” she said.  “Bruce.  He had a woman with him, too.  An alien...or maybe a robot, I’m not one hundred percent sure, but Rocket knew her.  He said she was Gamora’s sister.”  She shrugged.  “I can’t keep all these names straight.”
“I wish you could have too,” Steve answered on a wistful breath. “They were-” He cleared his throat. “They were good guys. Smart. Strong. Just...just
They spent the morning going over party stuff, then Howard asked if he wanted to grab a slice of pizza for lunch. Tony said yes. He said yes pretty often now. When he’d first moved back, he’d said no a lot. Howard never got upset. He’d just say “Maybe next time, kiddo,” and leave Tony alone...
But, that was over now.  Even when he came back from prison, he could never let himself come here again.  Tony deserved more.  Better.
, Thad,” Steve said, running his hand through his hair. “Just...maybe take a little breather. A little time. Apart.”
Tony sighed and pressed his forehead against Steve's. He could feel his breath on his mouth, on his cheek. Tony touched his face, looked steadily into his eyes. "I trust you, baby," he said. "I know you wouldn't hurt me. And I hope you know I'd never hurt you."
“Okay. Good,” Tony said, but when Steve started to lean into him, he pulled back a little. Steve frowned, and Tony squeezed his hand. “Have you ever tried it,” he ran his free hand through his hair, “you know, for
His own room was at the end of the hall, large, spacious, luxurious, but Tony stopped at a different door and pushed it open.
Steve dug a toe into the drop-cloth. “But I shouldn’t have it out here,” he muttered. “It’s messy, and...I could get paint on your furniture. I’m sorry, Tony, I-”
Steve cleared his throat.  He was sweating lightly, his nerves on edge.  “Rogers.  Steven, Grant.  Access Code 112-A.”
Tony wandered the streets until dawn.  Alone.  He didn’t wait for the ladies, didn’t wait to hear how he’d fucked up and made Steve decide that his precious pride was more important than being with his family.  Because that’s what it was--just pure, grade A, seven deadly sins-style pride.  To hell with everything else.  To hell with every
Steve stood up straight. Ran a hand through his hair. “I gotta go, but I’ll see you tonight, okay? And we can talk about it?”
“Oh. No. Sorry, Tony.” He gestured at the paperwork in front of him. The legal pads covered in a scrawl of numbers, either crossed-out or circled. The open books. The light from his laptop lit his face in a blue-white glow. “I just...I’m sorry. What did you say?”
“No,” Steve said quickly, hating how nervous Tony sounded all of a sudden. “No. Tony. I was kidding. I like it. I always liked it.”
“Of course, he did,” Sam said.  “He didn’t talk about you much, but sometimes we’d see something, and he’d say, ‘Tony should see that.’  Or we’d need something, and he’d get frustrated and say ‘God, if Tony was here…’”  He shrugged.  “He thought about you a lot.”
Better to just relax a little. Better to just wait and see. Sam was his constant. His rock. His backbone. He had been for the last four years, since they’d been paired as partners in math class. He knew he could count on Sam. Sam was solid.
As if reading his mind, Bucky stepped back, back toward the shadows.  “You should go.  Steve’s waiting.”
“That’s what they tell me,” Steve said softly.  He propped himself up on his forearms, relieving some of the pressure on Tony’s chest.  Tony wasn’t sure how he felt about that.  He kissed Tony’s mouth thoroughly.  “Can I move now?” Steve asked.  “Or am I supposed to be your human blanket all night?”
Steve glanced at his mother sleeping peacefully on the bed beside him. He thought about how much he loved her. How much she loved him. How much she wanted for him. How much he owed her. He tried not to think about Tony, but he couldn’t quite do it.
Tony kissed him. It was all he could do. There were no words in his head, no words on his tongue. Rarely was he stripped so completely of the ability to speak, but it was gone now, lost in the abyss of whatever this was that he was feeling. He didn’t dare call it love. He wasn't sure anymore if Steve would want him to, but in his deepest heart, he knew that’s what it was. Love. The simplest, most profound emotion available to the human heart. And he was, once again, overwhelmed by its strength. Its beauty. Its terrible, frightening fragility. He kissed him. He kissed him and let his body say what his voice could not.
Gina came back to the table, glanced cursorily at Strange, then turned her big eyes back to Tony.  They were hazel.  Thank god.  “Are you ordering lunch, Mr. Stark?”
Tony held him tightly, hands clutching him, moving over him, feeling the smooth expanse of his back, the brush of his hair under his fingertips.  He kissed his neck, his cheek, his lips, anywhere, everywhere.  “Shh.  I know,” he said in between kisses.  “I know, baby.  It’s okay.  I got you.”  There was no way he could hold back the tears anymore.  He let them fall as Steve held him dangerously tight.
Steve kissed Tony thoroughly, their hands still moving along the cat’s smooth back.  “I’m not adorable.  That’s a terrible thing to call someone,” he whispered.
Steve’s arm came around him, his hand settling onto its old place on his hip.  Tony could hear the smile in his voice when he said, “I don’t have to pretend.  I like you.”
Steve went back to the bed and picked up his last box, then put it down again and picked up one of the photographs. It was of the two of them, Pietro looking at Steve, Steve looking at the camera, smiling, the sun in his eyes, his arm around Pietro’s shoulders.
Tony shook his head, scrubbed a hand through his hair.  “I don’t know, you guys.  What the fuck?  He’s fine one minute, he’s...whatever the next.”  He sighed.  “I’m trying not to freak out, but honestly?  I’m freaking out.  Hard.”
Steve shrugged, ignoring the first part of what he’d said. “A lot of the guys over there smoke. I just sort of picked up the habit.”
“Are you going to go over and say hi?” Josh asked. His hand had found its way back onto Tony’s thigh. He kissed his cheek. His ear.
“Stop calling me ‘sir’,” Steve said sharply, and the guard snapped unconsciously to attention.  Like Tony, he knew a command when he heard it.
Steve’s other hand--the one not already holding Tony’s--moved to rest on his knee. “Yeah,” he agreed. “There is.”
Tony reached over, grabbed Rhodey’s arm, latching onto him and shaking him a little.  “God, it’s good to see you.”
Steve brushed his fingers against Tony’s, barely touching him, but feeling it throughout his entire body. “Me too.”
Steve smiled like a cat that had gotten into the cream, total satisfaction on his face.  He put his head in his one unhurt hand.  “I miss that.”
Steve looked around.  Thor stood above him looking at Peggy over his shoulder.  “This is the one I’ve heard of, the woman you loved?”
“I haven’t been able to stop thinking about you,” he whispered. “I can’t eat. I haven’t been able to sleep. I-”
than before.  If he hadn’t been in reasonable shape, he would have been worried about his health.  Even so, he did worry a little.  Exponentially more than he had before.
Rhodey sat back again and shook his head.  “I don’t envy you.”  He paused.  “Or maybe I do.  I never noticed before, but those eyes
“I know.  I know, but stay still for me.”  She was babbling, she knew she was babbling, but was powerless to stop it.  All of her training, all of her carefully moderated inflections were torn asunder in the face of the scene playing out here.  She was undone, shaken to the core in the bright April afternoon.  Nothing she had endured in either the Red Room or her life outside of it had prepared her for this.
Steve didn’t know. Even now, sitting here in this bar, thinking about how senseless and stupid what happened was, he didn’t know. Thinking about how, if he had been taking care of his men the way he should have been doing, this wouldn’t have happened. Thinking of Tony. And Bucky. And Jonathon. And Natasha. And his mother. Thinking it would have been better if he had been the one to step on that pressure plate. Thinking it would have been a relief.
Bruce went to one of Tony’s computers and started typing.  He typed fast, staring hard at the keys, still worrying a problem in his mind.
“Okay,” she said, and pulled him down to hug him fiercely. He let her, putting his own free arm around her waist, hugging her just as tightly. He kept holding Tony’s hand, though. He didn’t let go, even though the hug went on for a long time--a very long time, even by her standards.
He shrugged, that dimple teasing in and out of existence. “You,” he said, and Steve blinked at the plain way he spoke. The guy smiled again. “I’m Jack.”
And the second the thought was fully formed in his mind, Steve knew for certain that it was true. Tony should know. He deserved to know, and Sarah deserved to have him know. He thought about calling him, but he didn’t think he could do that. They hadn’t spoken in a long time. It seemed a little strange to just call him up out of the blue, especially with news like this.
“He is to me. He’ll always be little to me.” She looked at Sam. “And Sam will always be a gangly kid with braces.”
"Oh no, baby," Tony exhaled, crawling back up his body almost like a lion stalking its prey. "I think I'll take just as much time as I want. We've got all night, right?"
Steve had parked the car down the block, and when they reached it, Tony automatically went for the driver's seat. Then he remembered, and retreated to the passenger side. He wasn't in the driver's seat tonight. Steve was. And he still looked pissed.
break down and give him a treat. He couldn’t bear the sad eyes Dodger kept giving him over the empty bowl.
Steve shook his head. His eyes were open now, gazing into Tony’s. Tony remembered how clear they had been before. His emotions had always been so cleanly laid out, so easy for Tony to read, but not now. Now they were cloudy, hidden, and Tony found himself feeling a little afraid. Afraid of Steve, and afraid
This time the laugh was softer, muffled by Steve’s chest as Tony snuggled deeper into him. “Just my feelings a little,” he said. “I’ll heal.”
Steve took a sip of his beer, watching Tony closely out of the corner of his eye, watching the guy crawl all over him, watching Tony’s hands settle on his hips. He remembered doing that with Tony himself. Remembered the way Tony’s skin had felt under the pads of his fingers. Soft. Almost silky. He took another sip and drug his eyes away.
“Don’t say that, Nat.”  His brow furrowed into a disapproving frown.  “Of course, we’ll see him again.  He’s probably just holed up somewhere.”
was probably just fine up there all by himself.  He probably felt pretty pleased with himself that he had let Tony work himself up and then left him all alone down here.
Tony leaned his cheek against the top  of Steve’s head and moved his hand up to brush through his hair.  “I’m getting there,” he said.
Beside him, Tony could see Bruce sneaking little peeks at the mirror. It was the same way he usually watched a sex-scene during movie night, and Tony couldn’t help but smile a little at it. In his way, he was as shy as Steve. Or, as shy as Steve used to be anyway. He’d gotten a little more bold since Tony had gotten his hands on him. And his mouth. And every other part of his body.
Tony swallowed past the block in his throat.  As much as he loved what just happened, he knew it wasn’t real.  It wasn’t for him.  It was just muscle-memory.
“Don’t get greedy,” Tony teased.  “I’m not that easy.”  He pulled Steve’s head down to kiss his forehead.  Steve’s laughter was a puff of breath against Tony’s throat.
He reached over and picked up the blanket he’d folded.  It was a short reach.  After the first night out here, he’d moved the recliner closer to the couch, but Steve had made no attempt to touch him in the night, so Tony hadn’t either.  They slept virtually side by side, but the space between them felt like a vast desert that neither of them were capable of crossing.
Shaking, calloused fingers moved through blond hair, smoothing it back from his brow.  “Hey, soldier,” he whispered.  “Open your eyes for me, huh?”
“Mom-” he began, but she shook her head. Her tears were flowing, mixing with the rain on her cheeks.
Steve came up the driveway just as Rhodey was leaving.  He invited him to stay just as Tony had done, but Rhodey turned him down, too.  Meetings and missions, he said.
“You know, I worried all night about what I would do if you kissed me.  Every time you held the door for me or brushed up against me, I thought you might do it.”  He smiled and sighed.  “I was a fucking wreck by the time we got home.  You were tearing me apart, you jerk.”
Eyes still on Tony’s, still huge and dark, the irises eating up the blue surrounding them, Steve kissed the top of his boot. Once, twice, three times, lingering a little between kisses with his mouth hovering over the leather. Tony could see the pink of his tongue between his lips, and when it touched his boot, leaving a damp trail as Steve licked it, Tony’s mind whited out.
“But I wanted you,” Steve went on softly. He touched Tony’s head, ran his hand through his hair. “I mean, I always want you, but I
Hot threads of lust traced through Tony’s core and tangled in his stomach.  He wanted that, too.  Wanted it, but hadn’t dared to think it, let alone say it.
Tony closed his eyes and nodded.  Steve felt a little pang of regret but quashed it at once.  He knew this was right.  He didn’t like it, but he knew it.
Steve chuckled under his breath, but that was all. He tried to stay neutral on his guys’s little squabbles--but he kind of thought Gabe had a point. Steve missed the triumphant grin Bucky sent Dugan when he laughed, though. Dum Dum flashed Bucky his middle finger, but silently chalked up another point for him in their little game. March. He’d take the lead in March for sure.
But, saying no had thrown him off balance, so when Dr. Greene, his psychiatrist, had come in, he’d requested to see him and patiently explained what happened.  Strange had been wrong.  He hadn’t “reported” his friends--he’d went to his session.  He’d assumed his words would fall under doctor-patient privilege, but apparently, Dr. Greene had not felt the same.  And now, here was Thaddeus Ross standing in Dr. Greene’s office screaming at Stephen Strange and Nick Fury.  And it all boiled down to the Accords.  Again.  And his hatred of Steve Rogers.  Again.  And his desire to see him pay for what he’d done so long ago.
Tony put his hand on Steve’s back. “I’ll get her in her pjs,” he said quietly. “Don’t call that cab just yet, okay?”
They sat in silence for a bit, the pizza hot and good--not New York good, Steve thought, but good.  Some of that sexual charge had leached away, leaving a mix of sensuality and contentment in its wake.
They walked out together, the three of them, and crossed to the back door.  Sun streamed through the window set into it, hitting the shimmer in Nat’s dress.  She looked like she was wearing a garment made of diamonds.  Steve’s mind cast back to Sam’s apartment the morning after Hydra had nearly killed them in Zola’s New Jersey lab.  She’d asked him if he trusted her.  Strange now, to think that was a question she’d ever had to ask.
It was another command.  And in the face of it, Tony could hold on no longer.  He cried out with the force of it, painting Steve’s chest with it, his breath panting in and out of his lungs, muscles clenching, head thrown back.
“I, um, I didn’t sleep very well last night,” he admitted quietly, and Tony’s worried frown didn’t go away. Steve put his hand over Tony’s and held it against his cheek. “I’m okay now,” he went on. “Mostly. But yeah. It was rough last night.”
“How did you let this happen?” Ross raged.  “I thought you told me you had this Rogers situation firmly in hand.  Now I find out that not only did he try to murder Tony Stark--which I could understand, if not condone--but it happened almost
“Too many fights. Too many late nights. Too much fucking around.” He ran a hand through his hair. “Me, not her. But you knew that.”
Some of that charged, breathless feeling was dissipating.  Steve was glad to see it go.  This was better.  This banter and back-and-forth.  It was easier.  It was safer.
Tony rubbed his face.  “Dude, why do you have to make this so hard?” he asked wearily.  “It’s late.  I’m tired.  Wanda’s tired.  Fuck,
“Oh god, Steve,” Tony panted. “God, baby, you’re so good. So beautiful. So-” he heaved in a sudden breath as Steve’s hand found his balls and squeezed softly. “Fuck. Oh fuck.” Steve cried out in soft protest when he pulled out of his mouth. “Turn over, baby,” Tony said, grasping his hip insistently. “I want you. I want to be inside you.”
Steve's eyes remained troubled, dark, probing into Tony's in the night air.  "Has it been worth it, Tony?" he asked. "Being with me? It's okay if you say no, I know there's been a lot of-"
They left for the hospital at five o’clock the next day. Since Sarah worked at the hospital, the admission process was quicker than it ordinarily would have been, and she was in her room by six. Steve sat in the hallway while she dressed in her softest pajamas, then came back into her room and settled himself in the chair by her bed.
“No one wants to be reminded of that, Tony.  It was a dark time.  For all of us.”  He steepled his fingers.  “For Steve and yourself, most of all.  I’m not trying to be cruel.  I just want you to understand why it was wrong then and maybe less wrong now.”
,” Steve said. “‘Everyone should have a cell phone.’ You didn’t put a date-stamp on it. You said everyone.”
Tony gestured to him. “Come here,” he said, and Steve came to him. Tony took his hand. “Short and sweet,” he said easily. But he kept his sunglasses on. “Play nice with the other kids. Be in before dark. Early to bed, early to rise. All that shit.”
Steve laughed a little.  Softly. Sadly. "No, Tony.  That's not what I want for you.  Or for me. I was frozen once. I don't think I could do it again."
Steve sat the flowers carefully down on the countertop and touched Tony’s forehead with his warm fingers, feeling for a temperature. The gentleness of it made Tony feel like crying. “Do you feel alright?” Steve asked. “You seem weird all of a sudden.”
Tony sunk his teeth into Steve’s neck just a tad too hard.  Steve sucked in a breath.  “Quit while you’re ahead, Steve.”
“Um,” Steve said, biting his lip. “I don’t know. I don’t know if that’s something I can do right now.”
Steve glanced up at him, smiled, then turned his attention back to his task. “Nah,” he said. “I’ll come. Don’t worry.”
He didn’t laugh. He didn’t smile. He barely spoke. That was the worst of it all. Because Tony always talked. Always. It was his
Steve felt the bed dip as Tony knelt on the mattress behind him, then the warmth of him as he pressed against his back. “You know, I had an entirely different scenario in mind for this,” Tony whispered, his breath tickling Steve’s ear. “But…” Steve inhaled sharply as the silk slipped around his neck. “But I think you might need it tonight.” Tony kissed the lobe of his ear. “What are your thoughts on that, baby?” he asked. “Do you want to try?”
“Steve?” And her voice was still like a queen. She still held herself like a queen. “Are you alright, honey?” She put her hand on his back.
Tony thought, affection tugging at him, but he kept watch, in case this was going to escalate.  Sometimes it did.  Sometimes it didn’t.
When he came out, they cooked dinner together just like they used to. Steve watched his mother while they chopped vegetables and pan-fried chicken breasts. He watched her face, and the way she moved, loving the familiarity of it on one hand, but growing worried on the other.
He slept most of the way around the clock.  His head felt huge when he sat up.  Huge and stuffed with wasps that buzzed and stung at will.  He moaned.  A drink would quiet them.  It usually did.
Tony stepped away, relinquishing Steve’s closeness and heat reluctantly.  “Ha. Ha.  You’re hilarious.”  He reached into his pocket and pulled out a silver lighter.  T.S. was engraved on it in a swirl of scrollwork.  He’d had it since he was seventeen.  Had used it to light cigarettes, and hash-pipes, and on more than one occasion, used it to cook heroin in a silver spoon.  He didn’t use it much anymore.  The last time had been to light candles on some politician’s kid’s birthday cake, but he kept it with him.  Not as a good-luck charm, but as a way to remember how far he’d come since he got it.  Now he tossed it unceremoniously to Steve who caught it one-handed.
“It has to happen,” Pepper insisted. “He’s a member of the Clean Energy Commission. We need his approval on the reactor tech or-”
Steve didn’t hear anyone coming as he sat on the bench reading his book. Well...maybe not reading. Looking at. He was trying to read, but it wasn’t working. His mind kept wandering away from the words on the page, the letters swimming before his eyes, black letters swirling in a sea of white, changing to spell out a name over and over.
Tony sunk his teeth gently into Steve’s lower lip.  “Very nice of us,” he agreed.  “But back to the task at hand, so to speak,” Tony said, then pulled back to look Steve warily in the eye.  “Just tell me without mentioning him if you can, ‘kay?  It’s a real mood-killer.  The dude looks like a praying mantis.”
Tony slipped up the darkened stairwell, making as little noise as possible.  That was one thing about not wearing the suit that he’d come to appreciate:  the ability to move silently.  No thrusters giving away his movements.  However, incognito had never been Iron Man’s style.  He was an in-your-face kind of guy.  Tony Stark had grown to enjoy a quieter life.
They wheeled her out of her room early the next morning. Dr. Mickelsen came in first, and they went over the surgery again, just so they all knew what was going to happen. Steve wasn’t sure if this was SOP for all patients, or if Sarah was getting a little more personalized treatment since she worked here, and he didn’t care. All he knew was that he was grateful. He liked knowing there was a clear-cut plan. The doctor seemed methodical and precise, and Steve liked that too. It called to his own military mind-set. It put him even more at ease.
“There you two are,” Tony said.  “I thought you’d run away together.  Nat and I were just debating whether
Jack put his hand in Steve’s hair, holding him in place. “That feels so good, baby,” he said softly.
Tony raised his hands in surrender.  He was trying desperately to keep this light.  He did not want Steve to go.  Emphatically
“No, it is,” he said quietly.  “And it’s okay.  I can handle it.  It’s just harder.  I was scared when I was in the other place.  I was scared all the time, but I wasn’t lonely.  It’s different here.”
Warning: a little bit of dubious science-y stuff ahead.  I know nothing, I'm just making it up as I go. I deal in feelings not facts, guys! I just want to write sad stories😉.
“No,” Tony said, shaking his head.  “No, no, it’s not.”  He moved one sneakered foot until it rested against Steve’s.  He didn’t know if he could feel it, but it was a good place to start, an initial point of contact.  “Do you know when I first thought there might be something between us?”
When he and Steve had moved in before, the cabin had been one bedroom, one bathroom, a living room, a kitchen, a loft.  Pretty decent, as far as cabin-living went, but now there were three new bedrooms, two new bathrooms, and a lab with all the same toys as the one in the Tower.  He’d left the garage as it was--he liked the old-timey feel of it.  It reminded him of his mother--but had connected it to the house by a glassed-in walkway that stayed warm even in this frigid cold.  He liked walking to the garage in his shirt sleeves and bare feet.  He liked stopping on the way there and looking out at the cold morning through the ice-laced glass.  It made him happy in the same indistinct way solving an obscure coding riddle made him happy.
he thought, and bundled the blankets around himself, trying to approximate the feeling of a soft super-soldier behind him, but he couldn’t do it.  Perhaps it was the lack of breath at the back of his neck, or maybe just his scent, but either way, Tony was alone and he knew it.
They reached down and dragged Baxter to his feet, holding him between them.  He scrabbled with his feet, but they didn’t do much to either help or hinder their progress.
Steve hesitated to call him. He’d texted him once at 11:15, asking if he should go in and get the popcorn, but Tony didn’t text back.  Tony
an apology anyway? Tony thought it was probably just as rude to expect an apology as it was to do something that maybe required an apology, so they were even. Even Steven.
They were holed up in his and Tony’s bedroom, and when there was a knock on the door, Steve jumped.  Nat, characteristically, was cool-headed.  She just patted his shoulder and went to answer the door.
Tony backed toward the cabin door, pulling Steve by the hand. “Then come on,” he said. He pulled his keys out of his pocket and opened the door. “Come inside.” Steve shuddered out a breath, his eyes never leaving Tony’s face, but getting darker. Darker with need, with
Tony felt him trembling, but whether it was from desire or nerves, he didn’t know. He used the hand on Steve’s cheek to draw him forward, closer, wanting to go slowly, wanting to feel every little thing. Steve said they had one night. Just one. Just tonight. If that was all they had, then he wanted to give. And give. And give. Everything he had. He tilted his head just right, his muscles knowing what to do, even after all this time, knowing exactly the angle that would benefit them both the most. He stretched up, his own desire pooling in his stomach, a great red haze that obliterated everything else, and he found himself reflecting that for all the times he had touched Josh--touched
Steve closed his eyes.  He drew in a deep breath and let it out slowly.  “I’m sorry I’m like this,” he whispered.  “You didn’t sign up for this.”
“Sure,” he said.  He was still seventy percent asleep, so he hoped the question wasn’t too important.
I'm the worst. Sorry. Stuff keeps getting in the way of me writing and actually finishing this thing, so here's another half of a chapter. I hope you don't hate me. I'm trying. I just a;sdlkfjas;lfj
But Steve didn’t answer. He held him though. For a long time. Held him in his gentle, rock-hard arms, and Tony felt it. Felt his love for him pouring out, wrapping around him, cocooning him. He felt its warmth, its sweetness, its steady, never-ending
He dropped the dog’s leash, and Dodger nudged his cheek with his muzzle before trotting off toward Morgan. She brightened considerably when she saw him coming, and knelt to hug him again. Tony smiled. He couldn’t help it. He didn’t like dogs--or maybe he was scared of them...whatever--but he didn’t mind this one. And Morgan was over the moon for him. He could see that. He was
Tony took him into the bedroom and helped him onto the bed.  Steve let him help, and that was more telling than anything.  He never let Tony help him do anything he was able to do on his own.  Tony knew why now.  Deep down, he had always known, but it had solidified for him as he watched Bruce push Steve back up the lawn toward him that morning.  Steve didn’t care as much what Bruce, or even Sam or Nat, thought of him.  He could be more physically vulnerable with them because, in his mind, if push came to shove, he didn’t have to protect them.  They were his family, but Tony was his partner.  Tony was his
“Whether you’re going to break up with me now or three years from now.” He let go of Tony’s hand and used it to pet Dodger again. When he spoke, his eyes were on the dog. “I’d appreciate it if you just do it now, though. Save us both the time. And the hurt.”
“Nat made me,” Tony accused. “She said you’d already seen it so it didn’t matter. I disagreed, but deferred to her judgement.”
“We could have been hanging out at the beach right now if we’d gone to Cayman,” Clint pointed out. He cracked open a beer and passed it to Natasha who was lying on a lounge chair.
There was a silence on Nat's end, and Steve let it play out.  Let her interpret it however she liked. If she wanted clarity, she'd ask.  At some point--maybe in a day, maybe in a year--she would ask, and he would tell her.  They'd done it for her too, after all. Her, and Bruce, and everyone else. The family.
Tony touched him, keeping his movements small, soothing. Steve had never talked to him about his past before. At least not anything personal like that, and the thought that he would open up to him, even just a little bit, made Tony’s heart pound. “I wish I could have met them,” he said slowly.
“And we acted like it wasn’t a date, but I think we both kind of wondered if it was a date.  Didn’t we?”
?  Adonis?  Steve put them to shame.  With his head thrown back, his bottom lip between his teeth, his pale cheek tinted pink, he was perfection.  And he was Tony’s.
He called Jeff from his bowling team and asked him to keep an eye on the house.  “I got called away suddenly.  I’m sorry to leave you guys in the lurch, but it’s really unavoidable.”
--he wasn’t sure what they’d do.  He and Steve could still watch, he supposed, but fireworks felt like a party thing, something meant for a crowd.  He wasn’t sure if it would be as interesting with just the two of them.
scary. It was heavenly. “But I’ll tell you what. Why don’t I go tuck you back in bed, and when you wake up again, me and Dodger will make you pancakes for breakfast? How does that sound?”
“A few.  I don’t know.  He only came while I was under.  I don’t remember how many.  Please, Tony.  Please.”
They lapsed into a warm, affectionate silence, sipping their beers, watching the insects bump and tumble over the lights, the sound of the lake casting itself onto the beach a quiet constant.
Nat finally convinced him to start the movie, citing the fact that everyone but Tony had already seen it at least three times. Tony reluctantly agreed and sat in the chair, keeping one eye on the screen, and the other on his phone, waiting to see if Steve would text him again.
A moment later, the door opened on the lobby level.  No one was down here now except the doorman snoozing away in his chair.  Steve touched the wall of the elevator.  He knew it wasn’t her, and even if it was, she wouldn’t feel it, but he had to touch something.
Bruce put his head in his tented fingers, hiding his face from the couple in the corner who were currently sucking each other’s souls out through their mouths. Or trying to, anyway. Tony met his eye, and mouthed the word
Steve kissed his shoulder, relishing the heat of Tony’s skin under his lips.  He licked the same spot, tasting him, burning it into his memory, then kissed him there again.  He had no right to do it.  He knew that.  Tony was no longer his.  He had a young, pretty girlfriend.  He had a life that did not include Steve Rogers anymore.  But he couldn’t stop.  Couldn’t stop his traitorous hands from caressing his stomach, from settling on the cool, blue glow of the reactor.  Couldn’t stop his mouth from travelling over his skin.  Couldn’t stop his heart from beating out the rhythm of Tony’s name just as it had for years and years.  As it would continue to do for the rest of his life.
“They’re not hypothetical, Tony. You already met them. They’re there. They’re there, and at MIT, you’re going to be with them every single day. You’re going to see them, and talk to them, and go out for coffee with them after class. While I’d be back here stocking shelves, you’d be doing projects with them, and experiments, and-” he gestured with one hand, taking in everything and nothing, “-and telling them jokes you can’t tell me because I wouldn’t understand them in a thousand years. And pretty soon-”
When Nemo was found and the credits began to roll, Tony used the remote control to turn off the DVD. Morgan was sound asleep, sprawled halfway in Steve’s lap. Tony stood up and stretched his arms above his head, revealing that sliver of skin Steve remembered so well from when they were kids.
“I know, this economy’s hard on everyone,” Tony said solemnly into the phone.  “It’s the small businesses that get hit the hardest.”  He walked past Steve, prowling the room with his phone in his hand, his eyes far away.  He was, Steve was sure, conjuring a mental picture of his new-found confidante.  Giving him a face, a persona, hell, a
Tony nodded. “I’d offer to send my masseuse over, but massage isn’t recommended during the first trimester. It adds to morning sickness.”
Tony helped her move him to the couch then gave her a blanket as she curled up in Tony’s old, ugly, surprisingly comfy recliner.
The chill night air enveloped him as he stepped out the door. He zipped his jacket up against it, and walked down the street a little ways. He wouldn’t go far. He didn’t want to walk out on Bucky without at least telling him first, but he needed air. And a cigarette. It had been too hot in there, especially after talking to Tony, then watching him dance with
Steve’s smile was small and sad.  “Doesn’t change anything, though.  I’ve been Captain America for...ever.  Sometimes it feels like I was born with that shield in my hands.”  He looked into Tony’s face, his eyes pleading silently.  “And I love it.  God help me, Tony, I
“Dodger,” he said seriously, and propped himself up on his elbow. “I’m sorry. You seem like a very decent dog. But-” Dodger perked his ears up, and Tony deliberately schooled his features into a stern countenance, “-you shed. That’s nothing against you. It’s not your fault. Dogs shed. All dogs shed. Tha-”
be doing it, so he just kept his mind busy with other things. His brain didn’t need to be bothered with that part right now. It had other things to focus on. His body said he needed it. His shaking hands said he needed it. His slow, stupid tongue said he needed it. His heart thumping gamely along in spite of everything said he needed it, so he shut his brain out of the equation and just let his body decide this one for now. It needed it, so he did it. He’d let his brain in on the situation some day. Just not today.
Tony leapt to his feet and grasped her arm.  “Where are you going?” he asked.  “Come on.  Do your thing.  Fix him.”
He turned on his side and grabbed his phone off the bedside table. He had programmed Nat’s number into it after the first night they’d had dinner, and a moment later her phone was ringing in his ear.
Tony melted back against him, clasping Steve’s hand in his, using it to hold him tight. “I hate that you’re right,” he whispered, and tipped his head back onto Steve’s shoulder, just enough that he could lick a little stripe along his throat.
Sometimes it wasn’t okay.  Like when Steve had a nightmare while napping on the couch and Tony went to comfort him.  Steve threw Tony’s hand away, yelled “I’m none of your fucking business, Tony, remember?” and stomped off.  Or when Tony heard Steve and FRIDAY speaking to each other in a soft, gentle way, like old friends--old
But they were headed inside now, climbing the narrow stairs, Steve going first because there was no way those broad shoulders would allow for Tony to walk beside him, and they went up the first flight, then the second, then the third.
He opened the door and stepped through into the apartment. His mind was so preoccupied with sweet thoughts of jerking off to Steve’s deep voice, maybe having a sandwich afterward, that he didn’t even notice Howard sitting on the sofa until he spoke.
Steve laughed. He couldn’t help it. He missed Sam like fire, but having Bucky around helped. It wasn’t the same. It would never be the same, and he couldn’t wait until he and Sam could see each other again, but Bucky was a great friend. A great guy. He made Steve laugh, and he needed that sometimes. Like a drug, he needed that. Sam had gotten that. Bucky got it. Tony used to get it too. It looked like Tony was getting a lot of other stuff instead these days.
They ate in the kitchen at the butcher-block island, the three of them on stools, Dodger wandering between them, trying his best to get a bite. No one gave him one, at Tony’s insistence that he not be fed at the table, but that didn’t stop him from trying. When they finished eating, Tony said, “Ugh, fine,” and scraped the last few bites of his own lasagna into a bowl and put it on the floor near the sink. Dodger wagged his tail in thanks and scarfed it down.
He brushed one finger along the thin skin under Steve’s eye. It had looked a little bruised when Steve looked in the mirror this morning. He had convinced himself it wasn’t noticeable. No one at work mentioned it, although Sarah had asked if he felt alright when he popped up to tell her good-bye before leaving for the evening.
“Yes. Your paintings. I admit I don’t know much about art,” he said, looking at Steve seriously, “but I was impressed. Very impressed.”
“Thanks, Mom,” he said, then kissed them both goodbye. He promised Dodger he’d be up for him again first thing in the morning, and even though he whined a little when Steve closed the door, he thought it would be okay. He still thought Dodger could read his mind, and knew he was telling the truth. Making promises to the ones he loved was starting to come a little easier to him. Now that he was pretty sure he could keep them.
Tony held Steve tighter. He thought he could tell where this story was going, and he was glad Steve was lying on top of him. His weight was comforting. Needed. He ran a hand through Steve’s hair, and whispered, “Then what?” in his ear.
. It hurt his heart, seeing that, but in a way it was probably better. He was pretty sure he would have really broken down if there’d been more to it.
code still worked too.  He had full access to, not only the common areas of the Tower, but even Tony’s much more private ones.  The lab, the garage, the control room, even the basement levels where he kept a lot of the personal things that had once belonged to Howard and Maria.  Steve could get in anywhere in the Tower.  All he had to do was use his code, say his name, let FRIDAY do her full-body scan thing that she did so well, and he was off.  He was like Charlie Bucket in that old Willy Wonka movie.  And that was funny in more ways than one.  Little, pre-serum Steve had even
--” Tony began then stopped and dropped his forehead against Steve’s chest. “Yeah. Okay. Whatever you say.”
The song ended, and Tony must have made some small sound in the quiet that rushed in, because Steve glanced up from his work. They locked eyes across the room. Cool blue and warm brown. So different, but god, they were so similar too.
“So, you don’t want me to say anything?” he asked innocently, knowing full well how it would affect Tony. “You just want me to be quiet? Not talk? Not tell you how much I’ve been thinking about you all night long? How much I wanted to see you?”
feel bad for Howard.  Because as much as the courageous, stalwart, American icon was Steve Rogers, those other things were also him--
He looked older, but not old. His hair had been mostly gray the last time Steve had seen him at graduation, and it was almost white now, but it didn’t make him look “old”. More distinguished, if anything. His eyes were the same too. The color of Tony’s, but a bit cooler, a bit harder. He was thinner, though. He’d always been thin, but he was verging on skinny now. His clothing fit well, but Steve could see he’d changed even so.
On his knees, Steve was directly eye-level with Tony. Tony loved that. Loved that, for now at least, they were completely equal. Completely on the same level. Tony touched Steve’s face, his cheek, brushed down the slope of his nose, touched the center of his bottom lip. Steve’s mouth opened obediently at that gentle touch, and Tony let his finger come in contact with the warmth of Steve’s tongue. Steve’s eyes never left his as he gently suckled just the tip of Tony’s finger.
. Remember?” Tony said. “You’re mine, and I’m yours. That’s why neither of us have ever really been...whole. Ever. Because we weren’t together. And we needed to be together. We need each other. Don’t we?”
Steve showered and dressed and made a perfunctory tour of the common floor.  He knew Tony wouldn’t be there, but he looked anyway.  When he was sure Tony wasn’t up here, he got on the elevator and pushed the button for the lab.  When upset, Steve ran for the gym.  When Tony was upset, he retreated to the lab.  It was funny when he thought about it.  As different as they were, they did have common ground.
