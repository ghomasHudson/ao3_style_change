“Well, obviously. We don’t need to state the obvious here, babe. Okay, fine, second best thing.” Tony conceded. God, how was Steve so handsome? All these years and he was still the best thing Tony had ever seen.
“God, he loved this song so much. His taste in music was so bad…” Tony reminisced, “so blue-collar…”
Tony always thought he was well past the age of taking naps. But having an active three year-old son and a newborn baby sapped all the energy out of him. So when the boys were down for their naps, Tony made the strategic decision to take a nap with them too. To be clear, he didn’t actually set out to take a nap, but the carpeted floor of the nursery was so comfortable. He was just lying there after putting Ulysses and Joe in their respective cribs, intending to get a fifteen minute shuteye before working on the pile of paperwork Pepper had just foisted on him. But the fifteen minute shuteye turned to a three hour nap. When he woke up, Joe wasn’t in his crib anymore and before he could panic, JARVIS was quick to inform him that “Captain Rogers has arrived home and Young Master Joseph is currently in the living room doing baby calisthenics”. Ulysses was still sleeping soundly in his crib, but Tony should probably wake him up if he wanted the boy to have a full eight hours sleep tonight.
“I’m not,” Tony says, honest as anything. He takes a deep breath, as if to prepare himself, and just for a second there, Steve can see through the cool exterior, can see that Tony’s actually
It’s unfair, really, how Steve can maintain a poker face in the most dire of times, can keep secrets even the government wishes they could know, but one look at Tony and he just unravels into a tomato-faced mess.
“Ah,” Tony said, his grin almost smug as he settled against the hard back of his chair and crossed his arms over his chest. Osborn knew he’d figured it out, by the way his expression seemed to lose some of its previous irritation; still, Tony could see through it, could see how much Osborn resented having to ask for this. “You need someone to bankroll your dinosaur safari.”
Reaching over to ease the flask out of Tony’s grip, and looking for all the world like he was scared of getting his hand bitten off in the process, Scott flipped it over to reveal that the other side had been taped over and Sharpied.
Tony stood, ignoring the mud that was now staining the left knee of his jeans, and took inventory of what they had — and more, importantly, what they didn’t. With the suit and his phone lying somewhere in the T-Rex enclosure, and all the power systems in the park shut down, they were basically clean out of tech, save for the arc reactor. But Tony wasn’t about to take that apart and use it for scraps anytime soon. They had no food, no clean water, nothing except for the clothes on their back, which, with the rain still damp on their skin and the temperature dropping to a steady cool, wasn’t quite enough. And, to top it all off, they had no weapons to defend themselves — and Tony didn’t think punching out dinosaurs with his bare fists was really the best idea.
— if he could play it cool without giving away everything he’d worked so hard to plan, if he could take one look at his boyfriend and avoid turning into a bumbling, lovesick idiot.
Tony had been at boarding school long enough to have perfected the art of crying silently. But here, his sobs were loud, wet, echoing throughout the cave enough to drown out the ambient sounds of the nightlife outside, though he couldn’t bring himself to care in the slightest.
It’s circled, underlined, highlighted. Surrounded by tiny hearts, little doodles, variations of both of their names.
It didn’t take much more convincing than that, though Bruce did offer a smile that was a little too melancholy before he left.
Tony pressed a kiss to Steve’s forehead, brushing his knuckles lightly against his boyfriend’s cheek. “Sorry. I mean, I was being honest, I have faith in this to work out, but— Say your piece, I’m listening.”
“So,” Tony said without dedicating as many calculations to the problem as the rest of Earth’s mightiest heroes, “what you’re saying is, two to a bed and one on the couch?”
There was a thud, and the velociraptor that Tony was sure was going to kill him immediately dropped, hitting the ground like a sack of potatoes.
“For what you called that T-Rex,” Harry explained, and he was so dead serious Tony couldn’t help the amused, under-the-breath laugh that left his lips. “That’s another two dollars in the swear jar.”
“I don’t have a ring,” he confesses, after another moment passes. “I mean, I do have a ring, I just... don’t have it here. It’s down in the lab.” Tony chuckles, bashful and apologetic, taking a moment to look down at himself. He looks kind of ridiculous, but in a way that Steve finds hopelessly endearing: his hair’s mussed without any pomade keeping it in place, he’s wearing Captain America socks with matching shield boxers, and he lifts his hands like he’s not quite sure what to do with them before finally settling them on Steve’s knees, meeting his gaze once more. “I didn’t expect to be proposing tonight, I’m a little under-prepared. If I had known in advance, I might’ve kept my pants on.”
He’d been ready to, more than once, over the course of the past month. He’d taken the time to draft a heartfelt speech, writing and rewriting and memorizing it whenever he had a moment to himself; he’d forged a ring that would hold up even if Steve had to use his shield while wearing it; he’d booked reservations at all of Steve’s favourite restaurants, arranged for hot air balloon rides, cooked a homemade dinner on more than one occasion.
“I love you, too,” Tony said, taking Steve’s hand in his, intertwining their fingers together. The cool metal brushed against his skin and a shiver of delight ran down Tony’s spine at the thought of wearing a matching band, of showing off to the world that they belonged to each other. “Steve,” he breathed, dizzy with excitement, affection, with the almost intoxicating truth rolling so smoothly off his tongue. “You’re the best thing that ever happened to me.”
After a pointed glare from Natasha that Steve hadn’t failed to catch (he doubted anyone in the room did, really), Thor piped up in that booming voice of his, loud enough to wake the kids upstairs, “It would be an honor to take the couch of such a humble host. Captain, Man of Iron, I shall leave the last bed for you.” He clapped a hand on Steve’s shoulder, the other on Tony’s, grinning between his two teammates. “
Osborn scoffed, but didn’t protest, and Tony left the matter at that. Bruce didn’t say a word the entire tour, but at least his meditation techniques must’ve worked because he was still small and mild-mannered by the time the ride was over.
“Come on, Hulk up. Get angry,” Tony said, slipping a hand into the gauntlet. It was more snug than he remembered, and a piece of metal was digging uncomfortably into his thumb, but he hardly noticed as he aimed and took fire.
When Bruce took a step forward, it took all Tony had not to step back. At least now his expression had changed from cruel to curious, and Tony had never been good at crisis resolution, but there was something reassuring about the furrow of Bruce’s brow that prompted Tony to continue, soothing and gentle.
He was breathless by the time Steve pulled back, but Tony didn’t let him get too far, nudging Steve’s nose with his own, letting their foreheads rest against each other.
And for a while there, it actually worked. Tony’s hands, steady as ever, wove the sutures through skin, and it was only when he reached the halfway point that he was finally drawn out of his bubble of concentration by a stifled groan. Tony paused, letting a hand skim Steve’s ankle, thumb rubbing soothingly at his socked heel.
“So, who is this?” Natasha was the first to break out of the embrace and noticed Anthony standing behind them. Anthony was nervously standing behind them, trying not to be noticed, and he was watching them with wistful eyes, like longing for something he wanted but never had a chance to obtain. Steven released his siblings and stepped closer to Anthony, wrapping the prince up in his arms and pulling him closer.
Right now it’s late enough that the kids have been put to sleep and Tony finally told them his current situation with Steve.
Jarvis was rechecking all of the logistics and inventories necessary before they open for business. . As was usual, he and Bruce were in charge with the bar’s infrastructure, which includes lighting and sound system. As Jarvis went to set up the sound system over on the stage at the far side of the bar, he heard Bruce came up behind him.
“I see how it is. We’re such an old mated couple that when we have a couple hours to spare, we’ll just use it to sleep.”
Plus if i recount the whole story of IM1, the story progression would be too slow. I hope you guys understand.
“They found Loki. Stark and Banner’s algorithm managed to track him down.” Steve looked back at Tony. Their eyes met in silent conversation on what they were going to do about this.
The fact that Steve was a sickly child was widely known by his family. What they might not know was that he was an avid reader, because when stuck in bed for days on end reading and later drawing became Steve’s only reprieve from boredom. So he read voraciously. By the time he was twelve years old, he had read all of the books in the Brooklyn public library’s collection. Granted, it wasn’t that big of a collection in the first place, so sometimes Steve read the same books three or four times. He read biographies of presidents and world leaders, works of fictions, short stories, Shakespearean screenplays, works by Euripides, Sophocles, Homer, Virgil, Dante and others. Steve read a lot back then, and he continued that hobby even today.
“What did you see when you were up there, Tony?” Steve asked him. It was something that he had been dying to know, because he knew Tony saw something up there. The look in his eyes when he first came to among the rubbles on the streets of New York was one Steve recognized and knew all too well: the gaze of a soldier who had seen something troubling, something that would haunt them for the rest of their lives, leaving them shell-shocked. There was no doubt in his mind that Tony was going through the same thing and Steve hated that he was helpless in the face of such trauma.
Steve drove his motorcycle up the winding road leading up to Tony’s Malibu mansion. When Tony said that he needed to go back to California, because that was where he actually lived, it was no question that Steve would be following him there. There was nothing keeping him in New York, sadly, and there was no way in hell he would be living clear across the country from his partner.
And that was a thought, being something like co-workers with Captain America. Tony might’ve resented the idea before he’d gotten to know the guy, or before he had his life saved by him, but now… Now, not so much. He was warming up to Steve at a frankly alarming rate, though he didn’t worry quite as much as he should’ve. He suspected that was partly because of all the epinephrine getting his wires crossed somewhere, anyway, and not entirely because of Steve’s lopsided little smile.
“Right. Okay. Good,” Tony said, but placed a hand on Steve’s chest, just to pause him before he started to lean in again. “I was actually— I was wondering if you wanted to go to dinner sometime. With me. Not tonight, obviously, I think we both need some rest and you need to go to medical, but—”
Fury was the one who brought this whole thing to a close, and Steve doubted breakfast was thanks enough.
“It’s, what, a couple hours away,” Bruce pointed out, though he didn’t waste any time surveying the area for predators. “And that’s even if we hurry.”
Fury, from where he was still leaning against the counter, still drinking OJ, still looking like he had much to say but didn’t want to, asked oh-so-casually, “How long have you two been fucking?”
“God, yeah, of course. Sometimes I just lie awake beside you, and I look over at you, drooling and snoring and hogging all the blankets, and I can’t imagine sleeping next to anyone else. Can’t imagine waking up without you,” Tony admitted. He’d had it memorized, his flowery and sentimental speech, but the more he let himself ramble on, the more of it disappeared, and all he could do was speak from the heart and pray that he didn’t fumble over his words. “Before I met you, I never wanted anything like this. A real relationship, a family, white-picket fence, all of it. But now… Every time someone asks me where I want to be in five years, ten, twenty, you’re always the first thing I think of. You’re my everything, Steve. My life, my future. My
The next morning, while Tony’s still asleep, Steve sneaks into the lab, right before he goes out to meet Sam for their daily run. Luckily, the desk is messy enough to hide the fact that Steve has to dig around a little before he finds his sketchbook, hidden under a stack of blueprints, and quickly replaces it with the planner. He hopes Tony hasn’t noticed its absence, and when a day passes, then two, then three, without Tony bringing it up at all, Steve considers himself in the clear.
One of the velociraptors lunged forward, jaws snapping, and Tony’s reflexes were just swift enough to pull Harry a step back before the dinosaur’s teeth could graze him. “Stay calm,” he murmured under his breath. He assumed he was murmuring, in any case. It was growing increasingly difficult for even his thoughts to be heard over the desperate pounding in his ears, the reactor working in double-time. “No waterworks this time around, alright? Can you do that for me?”
Peter and Harry took up the front of their procession, after being appointed the party’s official lookouts, and Tony and Bruce followed closely behind them, the former keeping an eye on the kids while the latter offered directions every so often.
It’s Steve’s turn to be speechless now, and it takes a handful of half-finished sentences before he manages to find the right words. “If you’re doing this just to humor me...”
Tony willed his heart to beat slowly and sat on the booth opposite from Adonis, making sure he sat far away from the Japanese grandpa that sassed him yesterday and closer to Adonis’ booth.
In the earliest hours of the night, if he was alone or if the person he was having a one-night stand with was finally asleep, he would snuck out to the workshop where he would stay for the rest of the night leaving Pepper to deal with the enviable task of sending them packing, and pondered on the path he was taking. Dad’s untimely death and the distance between them meant that they never had a chance to have a serious conversation about the future of Stark Industries. How did he envision this company to be like in the future? Would Dad have been okay with the direction SI was going under Tony’s leadership? Tony had nothing to rely on but the anecdotes Obie would tell him about his father’s beliefs, his convictions. Tony might as well have learned about his own father from reading one of the many biographical books written on Howard Stark by some military historian.
As Tony sobbed, Clint awkwardly patted his back in a poor attempt to console his friend. Quill was making up some excuse to their guest. “Sorry, sorry. Our friend’s not feeling well. His, uh, dog just died…”
Steve shook his head in annoyance and dejection. The SI board members weren’t really known for their progressive stance toward gender roles. Some of them still maintained that an omega’s place was at home. After news of his and Steve’s mating broke, many of the board members tried to give Steve power of attorney over Tony, stating that as the Alpha he would be better equipped to make decisions logically. This move was quickly and efficiently squashed by Steve, with Steve making it clear once and for all that Stark Industries was Tony’s, not his, and as such Tony should be the only one making decisions about the company’s trajectory and future directions, not anybody else.
“Really?” Loki asked incredulously, mouthing “dammit” silently as Thor’s shiny blue eyes was focused to the stage.
Seconds pass and still no sign of Tony. With each passing second, Steve lost hope. The chilly iciness that he felt every single day he was awake in this new era started creeping up his spine, the despair he felt every day before meeting Tony was back. Steve wanted to tear everything down, destroy everything that took his love from a second time and when everything was gone, he would follow Tony. But Steve still had a duty, to humanity, to the rest of the world, and mostly to Tony. He would not let Tony’s sacrifice be in vain, “Close it.” he told Natasha. She did so without hesitation. The portal closed quickly, and in the millisecond before it disappeared completely from the Manhattan skyline, a small figure could be seen hurling backwards towards Earth.
But over the break there were so many comments (!!), I'm so touched and encouraged by each and every one of your comments, so thank you for making me want to write again! I love you all!!
“Because then we can finally be the Powerpuff Girls!” Ulysses cheered, lifting his hands up high in the air.
Out of options, Peter did the only thing he thought would preserve his superhero secret identity in the midst of the milling of their many classmates walking through the hallway: dragging Jamie by the arm to an empty classroom in an impressive show of his enhanced strength.
“Yes. I’ve been away for long enough. I know not what Alexander might have done in my absence. I worry for them.” Steven said, “Anthony, when I met you on that beach I had never thought that you would want to come away with me, let alone ask me to marry you. I fell for you irrevocably. I had hoped that you would come with me, but know this, my beautiful prince, I may have the blood of royalty but I am not one. I’m just a simple fisherman, I live in a fishing village with my parents who are also simple coastal people. I can’t offer you life in the lap of luxury, no servants to wait on you other than myself,” his words brought a chuckle from Anthony, “it would be a hard life, my love. A commoner’s life. And I don’t want to thrust you into a life that you would resent, a life that would not bring you happiness and would hinder you from achieving your true potential, your desire to contribute to society.”
” Tony cooed at his son and was rewarded with a high pitched giggle and bright blue eyes, identical to Steve’s, fixed at his own brown ones followed by a squeal and the boy throwing up his arms to be lifted up.
“Knock yourself out.” Tony grinned, slipping his hands in Steve’s warm grasp. Steve brought Tony’s hands closer to his nose and took a deep breath.
“And you didn’t tell the police?” Tony asked him. Next to him, Natasha stared at Clint and Coulson’s disheveled appearance, knowing exactly what they’ve been up to and Steve just resigned himself to another one of his employee obstructing justice.
“He said that Bucky works for him too.” And Tony knew his mate well, so he knew that Steve would be mad, to say the least. Honestly, the Audi getting away with a dented steering wheel was good enough in Tony’s books.
The problem was Tony was sure Steve didn’t kill this man. Tony knew Steve would kill for him, make no mistake about that, but Steve wasn’t even aware of this man’s existence until today. Another piece of the puzzle to consider was the fact that the murderer proceeded to frame Tony, which was something Steve wouldn’t do.
As the band played, more patrons started to gravitate towards the center stage. Steve solemnly observed the band’s performance, as Tony’s disapproving stance started to soften a little as he got into the groove provided by the bass and Coulson’s cello. Thor walked over to the bar to stand next to Loki and watch Clint performed.
“Of course. My apologies, Commander Rogers.” Steve conceded, a smile on his face indicating his amusement at his son’s antics. Tony laughed again at Ulysses’ self-proclamation as the leader.
A couple of minutes passed before JARVIS once more announced, “Approaching Coulomb barrier energy.” Tony held his breath, he didn’t realize he was holding it until JARVIS informed him once again that, “The Coulomb barriers have been surpassed.”
was displayed, but instead of the river Seine, it was set in Central Park. There was also an abstract painting that was supposed to resemble the arc reactor, Stark Industries’ trademarked technology. They might not be art students but they understood beautiful artworks. The lobby was starting to be emptier too, as it was nearing dinner time, and the rain started to let up enough for people to go outdoor and walked around again.
Steve Rogers turned around from his position sprawled face down on their bed towards the source of the sound waking him. It was early, but not as early as he’d usually get up when he heard the tell tale sounds of Tony coming home. He felt Tony’s side of the bed dipped signaling another occupant in the bed and turned towards his mate.
“Ulysses is awake? I thought he had prom last night,” Tony wondered, “I still can’t get over the fact that Sam’s rank was a master sergeant.” Tony snickered. Steve quirked his lips up in amusement.
Not first name, of course. God knew Rhodey (and Barnes too apparently, according to Steve) would get cocky over it. And if Barnes ever came back to them, having him and Rhodey argued about who the baby was named after would be hilarious to say the least.
God, he loved Steve so much. He didn’t know what he would do if something were to happen to him. They had just found each other again, for God’s sakes. It would be too cruel of the Fates to have them separate again so soon. Tony would rather watch the whole world burn down in flames than to lose Steve. He refused to live in a world without Steve again.
Jamie laughed again, his continuous exposure to Peter’s ramblings has endeared him to them. Peter was like the little brother he never had, being an only child. And Jamie found that that was something he looked forward to.
By the way he let out a quiet gasp in response, Tony thought that his boyfriend was just dumbfounded by the gesture, overwhelmed even, until Steve’s breath hitched in a funny way and Tony realized it was because he couldn’t breathe.
Tony clapped him on the shoulder. “Well, that sounds like Osborn’s problem now. Speaking of which, I don’t know about you, but I’m kinda leaning toward not endorsing the park.”
It wasn’t a total win, though, because one of the other velociraptors quickly took its place, jaw snapping a little too close to Tony for comfort, and he fired again, this time at the second dinosaur’s chest. But the gauntlet was quickly running out of juice, and the shaky beam had practically no effect.
Although, not without first admitting to Bruce that, once, in college, he’d drank an entire bottle of perfume, thinking it was scotch, and explaining how, that same night, he’d done the walk of shame across campus in nothing but a pair of high-tops and Fruit of the Loom tighty-whiteys, but hey, all things considered, there were much worse confessions he could’ve made in the name of science.
Even though Tony had explicitly called shotgun, he and Bruce were stuck in the backseat of the Jeep, while Osborn and his driver were in front.
“Sometimes I think you don’t see just how amazing you really are, but, if you’ll let me, I want to spend the rest of my life showing you.”
Tony knew this was his last chance to take back his tech, so without thinking, he reached out and snatched the gauntlet from the velociraptor’s grip, stood up, and motioned for them all to make a quick getaway.
actually was — Osborn was entirely evasive when asked about the park, stating the same platitudes over and over again:
He’s not, really. Steve’s still a little let down and a little embarrassed, mostly by his own idiocy—for a strategist, he sure has an awful habit of not thinking things through sometimes, and today’s no different—but he thought he’d be able to hide it, just enough to recollect himself and move past this whole thing. And preferably before Tony says anything about it.
Steve sat down painstakingly slowly, leaning back against the cold cave wall, right beside his shield.
Steve shook his head. “Probably not. But it’s fine,” he rushed to assure. “I’ll be fine. I’ve gotten stitches before.”
Bruce gave him a dry look, then pushed the brim of his hat down to shadow the embarrassed wash of pink that settled on his cheeks.
“I have nightmares sometimes too,” Steve admitted, after a moment. “Granted, they’re usually not as bad as yours, but. It happens to the best of us. Nothing to beat yourself up over.”
He let out a small sigh of relief, grinning even as he leaned in to steal a kiss, their noses bumping and teeth clashing, laughing into each other’s mouths. “Yeah? It wasn’t too corny, was it? I had this whole romantic speech written out, but I couldn’t remember it for the life of me.”
According to Osborn, they had a long flight ahead of them, followed by a short helicopter ride, and only belatedly did Tony realize he should’ve updated his last will and testament while he still had the chance.
And as soon as Steve nodded, it was like a starting pistol had gone off, Harry and Peter rushing over to him with an incredible but understandable enthusiasm and about a million questions each. It was good to see that, despite everything, they still hadn’t come out of the experience bitter and jaded. Tony was going to put them on the Stark Industries payroll one day, he already knew it — the company needed bright, young, curious minds like theirs, and while Harry might take a little more convincing, it’d be well worth the effort.
Tony shoves the pasta into his mouth, finally, and chews as he speaks. Which would usually earn him a light reprimand from Steve, but he lets it go this time, too distracted to pay it much mind. “Oh, yeah, I gave a presentation on all of it today. Even made a PowerPoint and everything. Loads of pictures, nice clean theme. And I guess it worked because R&D seemed to really like the proposal.”
Steve blinks. In the flurry of Tony’s enthusiastic explanation, one word in particular stands out like a sore thumb, and Steve has to play the conversation back a little to make sure he’s not just hearing things.
“Please tell me you haven’t been wearing that on all your missions,” Tony continued, popping open the Altoids tin and rifling through its contents. A suture kit, band-aids, aspirin, gauze, razor blades. With this level of preparedness, Tony would put good money on Steve being a Scout as a kid. Were Boy Scouts a thing in the thirties?
Tony caught Steve’s hand, raising it to his lips to press a kiss to his knuckles. “I know, I know, but… I want this. Anybody can
Because right there, standing in the middle of one of the open plains, was a Brachiosaurus, its long neck extending up into the trees. It slowly plucked leaves off the branches, chewing carefully before swallowing.
“Mr. Stark,” Harry whispered, a tremor just barely noticeable in his voice. “I don’t know if that’s gonna make a difference. T-Rexes have really good vision.”
Steve laughs, but his tone is earnest as he says, “I don’t need a ring. Or pants. All I need is you.”
. And if there was any doubt in his mind as to what exactly that meant, the logo also included a helpful little outline of the skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
When they exited the theatre, returning back to the large and looming hall of the main building, near the display of the Tyrannosaurus Rex fossil, the first sound that greeted them was the patter of footsteps against tile.
Any response Tony might’ve given was immediately cut off by a strike of lightning, and seconds later, there was another clap of thunder. Again, it seemed to echo, powerfully enough that the vibrations pulsed through the car. They were evenly spaced, seeming to get stronger the more they went on. They sounded almost like—
“The effort’s appreciated, but we beat them to the punch by a couple of months,” Tony concurred, half sprawled over the larger man. He rested his head on Steve’s chest and from that vantage could probably hear his heartbeat through the thin layer of cotton-polyester. “I’d like to see what they think once they know we’ve been going at it for this long.”
, and so it didn’t seem too unreasonable to want to figure out just how in the hell this was even possible.
Cap, distracted, whirled around, and the velociraptor he’d just hit in the chest retaliated by kicking him in the calf, the claw on one of its toes—
, eyes dropping down to the carpet as he collects his thoughts, biting his lip out of habit, and when he looks up at Steve again, his smile’s soft and fond. “Believe me, I’ve wanted to do this for a long time. I’ve actually—god, this is embarrassing, and it’s a real testament to how much I love you, the fact that I’m telling you this—but I’ve wanted to marry Captain America since I was two years old and dressed up as you for Halloween for the first time,” Tony admits, a pink tint to his cheeks. He gives Steve’s hand a light squeeze. “And I’ve wanted to marry Steve Rogers since I was forty-two and I watched you fall asleep in the middle of the shawarma place after New York.
“They’re gonna be more intuitive than anything on the market right now. More accessible, easier to use, and all at a way lower cost, too,” Tony rambles on, like he’s prone to do when he’s especially excited. He gesticulates with the fork in his hand, fusilli speared on the tines. “I’ve already drafted up a proposal and showed it to the guys down at R&D today. They say that it’s definitely doable. We might even be able to get a beta out by the end of the quarter, and if all goes well, a full product launch by the end of the year.”
Steve nodded, breathing in time with Tony. It took a moment before he finally said, “Sorry, that— That hasn’t happened in a long time.”
“I can’t just— It’s not a party trick, you know, I can’t just Hulk out whenever I feel like it,” Bruce told him, his voice taking on a desperate edge when the velociraptors stalked forward. “I have to be absolutely furious. And to be honest, I’m not feeling mad right now, I’m mostly just scared and tired—”
It’s short and sweet, the two of them smiling against each other’s lips too much to really deepen it, and when Tony finally pulls back, it’s just enough to murmur, “Is that a yes?”
“I meant it when I said that your looks aren’t what I fell in love with. Don’t get me wrong, they’re a definite bonus, but they’re not what’s important. What I really, truly love about you is how you make me laugh, how you know exactly what to say after I’ve had a long day. How you take care of me. I love it when you sing in the shower and play footsie with me under the conference table during briefings and talk to the bots like they’re human when you come down to the lab. You make me so damn happy, sweetheart, and more than that, you make me a better person. At least I think so. I hope so. In any case, it’s not an easy thing to do, but you make it seem so simple.
“Yeah, no, I know that now. But...” Steve sighs, scrubbing a hand over his face, before he finally looks over at Tony. “I got it in my head that you were going to propose to me today.”
Tony just clapped him on the shoulder. “Well, then we’d better get a move on before our only chance of getting off this fucking island gets lost out here too.”
Everyone else was upstairs, save for Thor, whose snores drifted in from the other side of the house. If only they weren’t all stuck in the middle of nowhere, the Asgardian would be quite exceptional in battle tomorrow, it seemed.
The man nodded politely, pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose before reaching out to give Tony’s hand a firm shake. “Bruce Banner.”
Tony scrubbed his hands over his face, breathing in deeply, gulping down air like a starved man. The worst part about all of this—and it was difficult to choose just one—was that he really thought he’d been doing okay, thought he was finally getting better. Back in New York, JARVIS had just figured out which conditions to keep the bedroom so this exact kind of thing wouldn’t happen, and for a while there, the nightmares had stopped. Not entirely, but they came less frequently, and sometimes Tony could make it through the night without thrashing around fitfully. He knew that he needed to give it more time, his trauma, and he knew that it wouldn’t just up and disappear like he kept wishing it would, but this just seemed like a step backwards for his progress.
The screen on the dashboard flickered with static for a moment before shutting off altogether, and Tony gave it a good firm whack. It was primitive technology anyway; the only reason they’d kept the damn thing on this long was because the kids got a kick out of mimicking the faux, computerized David Attenborough providing the tour. But the screen remained black, and the car came to an abrupt halt right in the middle of the trail.
Tony bites his lip, and with that sweet, nervous little smile, finally holds out the small velvet box. He pops it open, and sitting on the plush cushion is the most gorgeous ring Steve’s ever seen. It’s plain, just a simple silver band, and for a second, he thinks it might be made out of vibranium, the way it reflects off the bright lights in the lab.
And that was it. Those were all the tricks Tony had up his sleeve, and as he slowly tried to back away, only to find the current lapping at his feet again, his calves, his knees, he sent one last silent goodbye out to Pepper, Rhodey, and Happy, and prayed to— to
Tony was back in Afghanistan, lungs burning as they plunged his head into a bucket of water, as he hoped, not for the first time, that the car battery he was hooked up to would just electrocute him already. He was tied down to a chair, bruised and bloody, staring down the lens of a camera and the barrel of a gun. He was waking up on a rickety cot, Yinsen wrist-deep into his chest, ribs broken, tongue tasting like pennies, every nerve in his body firing at the same time, the pain so forceful he could feel himself slipping back into unconsciousness—
The way they’d done it, in essence, was by cloning DNA they’d extracted from ancient, preserved mosquitos, and then using frog DNA to fill in any gaps in the sequence. Which was scrappy and ingenious and resourceful, as advancements in science often were — but also incredibly batshit crazy. And morally wrong. And Tony could talk into the morning about how impressed and terrified he was in equal measures, because dinosaurs? Also scrappy and resourceful, and if Oscorp didn’t think they’d all get a case of cabin fever sooner or later, they were in way over their heads.
Tony had been hoping to let it through pass his system without any mention to Steve, not wanting him to worry too much, especially when he had enough of his own problems to deal with at the moment. But, now that he was thinking about it, maybe it was better this way. He’d learned pretty early on in their relationship that there wasn’t much he could hide from Steve anyway, and since he’d already reached that quota of secrets until he actually, eventually proposed, it wouldn’t hurt to have Steve be a little more cautious about what he said around Tony in the meantime.
“I took a peek at your planner the other day,” he starts, once he feels the bed dip beside him and Tony’s hand running soothingly over his back. “I didn’t mean to—it looks exactly the same as my sketchbook—but I saw that under today’s date, you wrote ‘
And listen, Tony had looked death right in the eye more times than he could count, so his life had long stopped flashing before him. But that didn’t mean he wasn’t scared shitless: as much work as he’d done on the arc reactor, rebuilding and replacing the damn thing over and over again, he was sure that it would give out at any second, what with the way his heart was trying to break out of his chest like a battering ram. He could feel his shirt vibrating with his pulse, the open collar flapping against his throat, and his hands were shaking like when he itched for a bottle.
Tony, not knowing what else to do and relying solely on a cocktail of instinct and adrenaline, punched the velociraptor in the snout hard enough that his hand hurt even through the gauntlet. The velociraptor didn’t take that too kindly, and reached out to grab the gauntlet between its teeth — Tony had just enough time to pull his hand out of it before it was crushed like an aluminum can and subsequently spit out.
Tony hums dubiously, and when Steve turns back around, hoping to slip out of the room without making a bigger deal of the situation than need be, Tony stops him dead in his tracks with a gentle hand on Steve’s chest.
Mere moments after Tony had started to think that this would all turn out fine, that they’d get back to the resort without incident, completely intact, the velociraptors showed up.
“A truth serum,” Tony repeated dryly, as he looked from the half-empty mug of what he’d assumed was Irish coffee, to the flask sitting on the counter, to the expression on Scott’s face, growing increasingly concerned. Now, to be fair, Tony knew that he was prone to being more reckless and idiotic than usual when he’d been holed up in the lab for over fifty consecutive hours, but, at least this time around, he was pretty sure that he wasn’t the one at fault here. “You spiked my coffee with a
And for the first time since he got to Isla Nublar—for the first time in months, really—Tony knew wholeheartedly that everything was going to be okay.
The remaining four velociraptors seemed to get the hint quickly enough, bolting for the trees, and Tony let out an exhale, hands on his knees, just making sure he had enough breath in his lungs. “Bruce, buddy, you have no idea how glad I am—”
It landed about three steps away, just out of reach, and both Cap and the velociraptor followed its trajectory to the ground, leaving a circular indent in the sand around it.
All of them were definitely in need of a distraction, something to keep their minds off Ultron as they tucked themselves away in hiding at Clint’s farm. For Tony, that meant repairing the tractor out in the barn; for Steve, chopping firewood.
Steve huffed out a small laugh as he shifted in Tony’s arms, turning around so they could face each other. His eyes were still the same, the rich blue easy to get lost in, as Tony so often did, and so was his smile, though it faltered ever-so-slightly as their gazes finally met.
Steve, still a little bit shaky, a little bit breathless, managed a smile bright enough to give the stars a run for their money. “Really?”
“You okay?” he asked, and the question hadn’t gotten any less loaded now that they were in the relative safety of the quinjet. “I mean, what happened after I left?”
“Because you seem kinda... off,” Tony continues, leaning against the door to the walk-in closet as he unfastens his cufflinks and unbuttons his shirt. “You were spaced out for most of dinner, and you’ve been... I don’t know, weirdly jumpy the past week, and you keep giving me this look like I forgot to wish you happy birthday. Except I didn’t, because your birthday’s next month.”
“Mr. Stark?” Peter, this time. His voice had come out as a quiet kind of squeak, swallowed almost entirely by the rhythmic
“No, no, you didn’t, it’s okay. I couldn’t sleep.” A moment passed, but just when Tony was about to speak up again, Steve beat him to it, adding, “Bruce texted me earlier. He, uh, told me about the truth serum, kept me updated while you guys were running tests.”
“You mean the world to me, you know that? When I’m with you, I feel so happy and so lucky and so loved, and all I want is to spend the rest of my life making you feel the same way.
“They’re trying to set us up, you know,” Steve said, keeping his voice soft even though he doubted the rest of the house could hear him over Thor’s lack of a nasal strip.
Once Bruce was no longer naked and afraid, he caught them up on what had happened back at the resort. Apparently, sometime last night, as Tony and the kids were out on the last leg of their tour, the power grid and security systems were completely shut off, and while it was possible that it had something to do with the storm, Osborn had insisted, instead, that it was the work of a disgruntled employee. Which Tony could understand, not wanting to work for Osborn, but even he had to admit, this was getting to be a little over-the-top.
Peter didn’t tell Joe or Uly about the close call on his identity being revealed last night. Uly was in the middle of midterms at Harvard and Joe was already asleep by the time Peter got home. And anyway, Peter handled it just fine. He left before he could blabbed some more about who he was behind the mask. No need to make his big brothers worry over nothing.
...Or at least until Christmas next year when Steve came back from a mission in South America to a giant stuffed rabbit dressed as Captain America, complete with a pin around its neck proclaiming “Merry Christmas Steve” on the front lawn of the Malibu mansion.
Tony raised vacant brown eyes up towards him and Steve was scared as he looked to that beloved face. He felt Tony slipping away from him with each silent tears his mate shed as he stared blankly at Steve.
Once he took cover, Tony searched for his phone, flipping it open to call for help when a shooting sound was heard and bomb landed next to him. His eyes widened in shock as he saw his name prominently displayed on the bomb. The bad guys were using his stuff?
They sat in silence then. Clint having finished his cereal was now dozing on the couch, and Tony drinking his coffee while fiddling with the StarkPad he brought from the workshop to catch up on some emails from R&D and Pepper. The anchor on the television was talking about how the Vice President has met with front runners to fill the Supreme Court vacancy. The screen then changed to display the pictures of the nominees: one female judge and two male judges.
“Sweetheart, stop. I wanna come with you inside me,” Tony whispered, his voice sounded hoarse and wrecked. All that gasping and moaning Steve elicited from him was wreaking havoc on his vocal chords.
“I’m old, Steve! Hell, all this time I thought I’ve finally entered menopause. No more pesky heat cycles for me anymore. But then this happens, so I guess I’m not.”
Tony was silent as Steve relayed the stories of his father’s life, the only sign that he was listening was his slow stroking of Steve’s cheekbones as he talked. “He sounded like a one man warrior.”
“Hey, buddy, ready to go?” Steven greeted the horse as they approached closer, rubbing his hand down Groot’s flank. Groot neighed happily, bumping his head to Steven’s chest affectionately, “Thank you for your help. I couldn’t have done it without you, but now I think we should get out of here. Anthony’s coming with us.”
Quill came towards them carrying a big box with him followed by two men whose features Tony couldn’t make out from his position on the tarmac.
They didn’t end up going anywhere that night. Clothes ended up on the floor, projects were left abandoned in the middle of rendering, and Steve and Tony ended up in the small cot that Tony kept in the workshop for naptime purposes, entwined with each other so tightly it was impossible to tell where Steve ended and Tony began.
“I’ll be here.” Anthony answered him, his beautiful brown eyes shone with delight, mischief, and dare Steven say, affection. “And one more thing,” Anthony pulled him closer and in a flash pressed an unexpected kiss to Steven’s cheek, “a favor for the brave knight fighting on my behalf.” he winked cheekily.
“Wow.” Jamie felt powerless from the earth shattering revelation that Peter just blabbed out to him. He never thought, not in a million years, that Joe would have reciprocate his feelings or that he would feel the same way that Jamie felt for him. He wasn’t imagining things, wasn’t imagining this gravitational pull, this visceral need to be near Joe. Joe, according to Peter, felt the same way and has been since at least three years ago. “I thought it was just me. I thought it was wishful thinking leading me to believe that I might have a chance with Joe. I mean, Joe is Joe, y’know. He’s so awesome and sweet and kind and so, so smart. And pretty…”
“Bruce, no...you don’t understand. I have to go to Steve. I have to be with him…” Tony pleaded. Bruce was pushing him back down to the bed, his eyes were bloodshot and red rimmed like he’d been crying.
It all started with an off hand comment from Clint, like everything weird always did. That morning it was just the two in the kitchen, eating breakfast. Steve, Natasha and Sam were off on a mission out of the country, while Bruce, Thor and Bucky were still sleeping. Tony was feeding Ulysses and talking to him in Italian, because he wanted Ulysses to grow up just like he did: speaking his Mother’s mother tongue. Clint was playing on his phone, a bowl of cereal and orange juice in front of him.
“I want to thank you for last night, for saving my mom. I was worried when she didn’t come home when she was supposed to.”
So yes, Tony’s pretty invested in Hawai’i. And after relinquishing the CEO throne to Pepper, taking the position of Chief Technological Officer and Head of R&D of Stark Industries, he was here to stay.
“No, Master Peter. The Tower is as structurally sound as it has always been. Any changes that occurred overnight happened with you, Sir.”
“The thing is, uh Clint, it’s a bar. It’s an Irish bar. And people, they need to be able to dance, not just--” Steve started to say.
“Speaking of life-saving and secrets…”Jamie glanced discreetly at Peter who was gesticulating wildly at Ned and Aaron, “I found out last night that the apple doesn’t fall far from the Superhuman trees.”
On his way back to the car, Tony took a detour to the production plant to see the arc reactor that partially powered their factory. The ethereal blue glow of the reactor was soothing and familiar. Tony had a niggling sense of
Never let it be said that Tony was a sore loser. He had always accepted his victory gracefully and dealt with his losses graciously.
“Whoa, okay…” Tony warily looked over at Natasha, “What’s with the homicidal impulse so early in the morning? Are you okay?”
Bucky threw a bunch of pictures onto the table in front of Maria. She reached forward taking one of the pictures and seeing it as pictures of the crime scene.
Steve stepped in to stand beside him and reached down to the crib to caress his baby’s cheek. “Seems like he grew bigger than when I saw him this morning.”
Tony poked his stomach in retaliation and snuggled up closer to Steve. He breathed in Steve’s scent, seeking comfort and solace after weeks of separation. His fears from before were somewhat abated with Steve by his side. Steve would support him just like he did with Ulysses, Tony wouldn’t have to do this alone.
“Tony,” Steve’s voice drew him back from the scene in front of him to his mate. Tony gasped as Steve started to kneel in front of him, holding one of Tony’s hand in his own as he gazed reverently into Tony’s eyes. He could feel tears started to gather in his eyes as he started to realize what was happening around him, “Tony, the past eighteen years have been the best years of my life. And it’s all because of you. At the beginning, we started this relationship on shaky grounds. Several things that were out of our control happened,” Steve said, alluding to the painful revelation about Tony’s parents’ death, “but we weathered through it and were stronger for it. I didn’t want to lose you so soon after I just got you back so we went to the City Hall the next day and that was that. But Tony, sweetheart, you deserve so much more than a shotgun bonding at city hall. You deserve the world.”
“-- his plane leaves every night?” Tony interjected, looking at Quill, “there’s only one problem with that.”
Tony reached out to squeeze Steve’s hand in his own before letting it go. The Alpha’s hand is cold, the room was being kept at lower than room temperature to balance Steve’s higher than usual body temperature. “You need to wake up for me, soldier. We’re so close.”
“I never seem to have a reason to, I guess. I never knew him. He died before I was born in the Great War. Mustard gas attack was what they told Ma.”
“Yes, Captain. My apologies, I didn’t mean to alarm you, it is only my judgement that you would like to hear what the argument was about from Master Stark himself.”
“What are you thinking about?” Tony jostled the hand that was still in Steve’s hold, bringing Steve back from his musings.
Tony used to think being able to spend all day in bed would be the greatest thing in the world. Turned out, it was the most boring thing in the world. He was mandated to stay in bed and not do anything more strenuous than walk the ten feet journey from his bed to the bathroom. There were some noises from Bruce about hooking Tony up to a catheter, but he immediately and prejudicially vetoed that idea. Being on bedrest was one thing, but being hooked up to a catheter was where Tony drew the line.
It has been a busy summer to say the least. My cousin got married and everybody in the family was ass over head busy running around taking care of last minute wedding prep stuff. Plus I had to travel back home for the wedding so I haven't had much of a chance for writing.
Peter had just finished patrolling the neighborhood, rushing back home by swinging from the skyscrapers that littered the island of Manhattan, because he, Uly and Joe were going to go out for a Mets game soon. He made it to Park Avenue where Avengers Tower was located and started scaling up the building to the penthouse where his room was located. Locating the hinge he made outside for easy sneaking in and out, Peter dropped down from the ceiling in his Spiderman costume and stripped his cowl off, intending to change before his brothers could come and fetch him for the game.
Just then an elevator located near the back of the lobby opened, and out came a visibly distressed Steve Rogers holding a hyperventilating and massively pregnant Tony Stark in his arms to the lobby.
“What? No, no, no. let me read it,” Tony reached out and flatten the pages so he could read it. “‘We made love tonight. Though it was our first time, it was incredible. I never felt such a connection with another human being before in my life. We need to do this more often!!!’” Tony recited. By the time Tony was finished reciting what Steve wrote, Steve was blushing.
“She was in the elevator when I wanted to go down to answer the call. You guys left her in the elevator, didn’t you?”
“And then he threatens Tony. He sends this guy Rumlow on the job. But you don’t see it, because you don’t use your head. You think everything that you feel is true and that the world works the way you wanted it to.”
“He’s a man of principles,” Pierce countered derisively, “and I mean that as a terrible insult, by the way. Now if he had just paid me off, none of this would have happened. ”
“I left him behind, Tony. when you collapsed, I panicked and-- I had tunnel vision, the only thing that mattered was getting you some help and I left him behind in my studio. What kind of father would ever do that, Tony? He was alone.” Steve reached out to caress Ulysses’ head. The boy, feeling Steve’s hand, caressing his head, turned around to look at his father and smiled, offering a piece of beef he was chewing to Steve, which he took indulgently.
“Your Highness, please, I’ll explain everything to you later, but for now we should focus on the monster right in front of us.” Steven said again. His heart was beating thunderously, and not because of the man-eating monster threatening to devour them both. The feeling and proximity of the Crown Prince holding on to him, his lithe body pressed up intimately against Steven’s own was causing him to become flustered and out of sorts. The young prince’s body felt so good against his, his scent permeating Steven’s every pore. It wasn’t the right time nor the right place, but Steven couldn’t help how his body was reacting.
“Avengers assemble!” Bruce screamed into the panic button despite the lack of speaker on the button.
Steve came in the room with Ulysses in his arms. He had took the baby back to the nursery to change his diaper. Ulysses look bright eyed and happy. His blue, blue eyes so much like Steve’s and the curious expression on his face as he scanned the room looking at his aunt and uncles. He lit up when he spotted Tony on the couch, letting out a cooing sound and reaching out his pudgy hands towards his father.
“Julia, that looks great.” Steve complemented one of his students as they attempted to paint a still-life of the flower bouquet and fruit basket display that was set up in front of them. Steve really liked teaching art and seeing how his students channel their unique perspective and life experiences into their art.
Stacy seemed mollified by Tony’s answer, “Okay. Then goodbye, Tony. How about one last kiss for the road?” She closed her eyes and pursed her lips and started to lean in to Tony.
“Yes, Steven, squat. It helps with the labor. Oh, there,” he pointed to the Avengers statue, “let’s go over there. That’s a good spot.”
“Good God, you're a woman. I honestly...I couldn't have called that. I mean, I'd apologize, but isn't that what we're going for here? I thought of you as a soldier first.” Tony tried to compliment her.
“When Thor does his sweep, he never checks the Lost and Found,” Clint announced as he led them to the coat closet that also doubled as the Lost and Found counter of the bar.
Steve pressed a soft kiss to his forehead, smiling down at Tony. He knew Tony hasn’t been feeling his best lately, that he was self-conscious of his body postpartum but to Steve, he had never looked more beautiful than he was right now. It was proof that Tony had just given them the greatest gift of all, their son. And damn, if Steve couldn’t make him see that he desired Tony just as much now as he did before Ulysses came. They might not be able to do much now, on account of the afterbirth discharge, but once that was done all bets were off.
“Three weeks ago. Said he didn’t wanna be a burden to me and James anymore. I don’t know. He made up his mind. Ain’t nobody could change it once that kid made up his mind.” Joe continued, “You know what, he’s doing great over there. Started teaching art classes for the others and he gets to paint every day. Actually, I heard he’s even singing again.”
“Steeeebeeee….!!” Tony screeched out when he spotted his mate, looking like an irate housewife with both his hands propped on his hips, “Stebe, I miss youuu…” Tony jumped off the table, confident even in his inebriated state that Steve would catch him. And catch Tony he did, Steve’s arms supporting his waist and back, holding Tony close to him.
Thor hemmed and hawed for a bit, but his decision was made for him when Steve dragged him up to his feet, slinging Thor’s beefy arm around his shoulders and dragged him out of the gym, Tony chattering to them endlessly about the new modifications to the Iron Man armor. Thor might have lost his girlfriend, but his family was still here and they would have his back no matter what.
Or until they decided to take another picture to reflect the new addition to their family two years later.
“Hey,” she greeted Ellie, then looked at the painting in front of her, “oh, wow. This is amazing. Who’s the artist?”
The Teacher turned her attention to Lucas, whose lower lip was wobbling. Lucas bit it in an attempt not to cry. Hammer Men Were Made Of Metal. He couldn't cry. What would happen if his Dad found out? Ohgodohgodohgod.
Tony grabbed her gear and wandered back into the kitchen. Sarah was still talking a mile a minute and Tony picked her up by under her armpits and placed her on his lap.
As Steve relaxed, he could feel the tension seeping out of his shoulders. He watched as the fire crackled gently, his attention then turned to Tony and Harry who were unaware they were being watched. Harry was attempting to make a Sandcastle but Tony kept a bucket of water and poured it over the castle, making Harry burst in hysterical giggles.
Alex smiled briefly, opening the box. Then he tipped the box over and ran his hands through the bits and pieces.
He wondered if the other kids were going to go outside. Maybe not, maybe so. Toby had more of a fascination with an Xbox than getting himself cold outside and Ryan didn't really understand what he was supposed to do.
Sarah quickly nodded and shot off for the kitchen like fire was on her heels and started chatting at a very morning ruffled, confused Pops.
"Yeah, but I was going to watch a movie," Nick said, stubborn. "It's a good one and I can't move just to get food!"
Apparently, puzzles. Tony walked into the living in a red dressing gown and black slippers, holding a Coffee in his hand. He looked towards where his husband was with their adopted son, who was originally from China.
Tony blinked twice, and turned to find Sarah looking up at him with big blue eyes. "Sweetpea? I thought you wanted to watch that show."
"Hey, kiddo?" Steve said, prompting Xander to look up with childish curiosity. He bent down to Xanders height and pointed at Tony. "Why don't you go help Papa, hm? Remember what I taught you."
Eventually, their peace was ended. The kids had found something else that had caught their attentions - Building snowmen. They ran through the halls until they reached where Tony and Steve were resting. Steve, cooking for Dinner tonight and Tony spacing out, watching the snow fall rather peacefully.
"Do you think she will be back anytime soon?" Tony asked, curious as he heard laughing and giggling coming from behind the porch door.
His favourite thing to do was puzzles, and it was his way of communicating rather than through sign language since he couldn't formulate many English words yet. The little kiddo had only came in with ratty old clothes which Tony chucked out and ordered him expensive, fashionable kid clothes, one proudly declaring "Iron Man" in big bold letters, on top of a red jumper.
Lucas pushed away from the Teacher and ran into the halls. Soon enough, Mike followed him into the boys bathroom.
"I was wondering if we could get some popcorn," Nick replied, following them into the Kitchen like a lost puppy where his Pops was beginning to make noodles.
Puzzles were a simple, fun thing to do on an early morning on a Sunday. He relaxed a little in relief, that he didn't have any business with Stark Industries and he could go find what his family were up to...
When they were done, the Teacher had thought it was great. Mike was beaming at him and Lucas smiled shyly at him.
Mike sat his table which was red and his chair was a lightish blue. He listened intently as the Teacher explained what they were going to do today. Pro tip, she was obsessed with Christmas and she still thought it was the Christmas season even though that passed a long time ago. Well, a month ago...Nevermind.
Tony smiled warmly at him, plopping down onto the couch. He sighed in contentment and picked up his drink. He inhaled, "Mm. Smells exactly like my Mothers recipe."
Steve covered his chest as Tony started slapping him. "We did this the same last year!" Steve said, ruffling his hair and holding a sleepy Harry to his side.
Xander nodded, glee breaking out on his face. He went down to the ground with his Papa, picking up another onion and doing the exact same thing Tony did. Tony watched him, learning more.
A couple months later, Justin Hammer was forced to hand over all parental rights and was sent to jail for child abuse. Tony and Steve adopted Lucas a few days after that.
"Michael!" The Teacher shouted from where she stood at the whiteboard. "How could you punch someone in the nose?"
Steve laughed in the background, having gone back to read or make breakfast now that Alex was entertained.
When Schools were back in full swing, Steve and his husband Tony were always very busy with things like packing lunchboxes for Mike, waking up a fussy Hasden for Nursery, getting a pissed off teenager to High School every Monday 8:10 sharp and also getting Adam to keep his eyes open for at least an hour.
"Umm.." Pops said smartly. "Fine. What are you watching?" Pops hastily gestured to Dad to grab the Popcorn out of the cupboard. Dad did so, went to the popcorn machine, dumped it in and turned it on.
Their house was located in Brooklyn, and their house was very much home for them all. Tony sat by the window, a hand resting on his baby bump and one hand placed underneath his chin as he watched the snow fall like little droplets of rain. The ground was covered, he could see children playing in their gardens doors over. The neighbourhood they stayed in was very friendly and mostly peaceful during their time there.
"Yes!" She yelled in excitement as she saw her clothes, wiggling out of her Daddys lap and grabbing everything she needed. Steve chuckled at her, pulling her back before she could go anywhere.
"Wow!" Exclaimed Lucas happily, holding the Snowflake in front of him by a distance. "I like playing with you, Mike." He whispered quietly.
Just before he could turn around, he felt someones arm around his waist and turned around just to be met with the face of his husband.
One of the students, Peter, walked around the whole classroom and passed out white pieces of paper that had a cut out shape of a Snowflake on it. Intrigued, Mike reached for the Scissors that were scattered in the middle of the table inside a small sphere shaped box but before he could another student knocked his hand away. He winced. He had always hated Lucas Hammer, Justin Hammers kid because he was as self centered as his Dad.
Mikes Pops went over to Lucas and asked if he wanted help. Lucas told him he did because it hurt so bad. Mikes Pops face darkened considerably before his face softened and he helped.
"I want to be friends with you!" Mike replied happily. "And-and then I can help you with your Snowflake." He paused. "Your Dad might like it."
"Like!" Alex said, shoving the piece underneath Tonys nose. Tony nodded, encouraging him to go on. He picked up another white plastic card, "WHERE?".
Suddenly, his phone notified him that the drinks were made and he went back inside unnoticed by his husband or child who were too caught up in playing with the sand. Steve smiled thinking about it as trudged up the steps into their house and makes way to the kitchen. On his way, he is bombarded by two hyperactive dogs, his retired German Shepherd army dog Marcus and Tonys Labrador Benji. He patted them for a coupe minutes before heading forward to the kitchen where he picked up the cups.
Nickolas Niko Stark Rogers didn't have much time to spend with his family because of the end of his High School career, homework and his friends trying to set him up with females that he told them before that he disliked them. Anyway, so here he was and it was finally the weekend so maybe just maybe he could feel a spot in his busy schedule to go to watch a new movie or do something or other.
How to plant onions? Honestly, Tony didn't know. He didn't know why he was out in the garden Steve had freshned up, holding a bucket of a fresh onions that Steve had felt the need to pull out of the ground (once fully grown) and plant them somewhere else. Tony looked back at the bucket, then at the ground. He could feel Steves eyes burning a whole into his head, his blonde haired kid Xander doing the exact same thing since he wanted to be just like Daddy.
Tony hmmed, tapping his chin thoughtfully. Alex let out a delighted laugh, another plastic card, showing it; "FUN!".
Dad raised his head from where he was fixing his hair. Always the diva, and smirked at him. "You're not thirteen anymore, kiddo. In fact, you're eighteen. Don't you have a job at that Bar?"
Now, the house was still bustling with activity. Ryan, who was one, was playing his playpen. Toby, who was eleven, was running around the house trying to find his Winter clothes so he could go outside and Sarah, who was three, was sitting calmly in front of the fire watching cartoons on their very large TV Tony insisted on.
Making Paper Snowflakes was meant to be simple but turns into something much darker when its revealed that Justin Hammer hurts his son, Lucas Hammer.
Alex made a questioning noise and looked at the big puzzle into a slot, making up half a tigers ear.
A few weeks later, Mike turned nine and invited Lucas over. Lucas showed up, but he had lots of bruises. Mike watched him sadly.
Oh god, not Frozen. He smiled at her, ruffling her messy blonde locks. "Why don't you ask your Pops where your wellies are while I go grab your winter gear, hon?"
His Dad did say he took after Pops. Smug with that thought, he stood up and leaned over the desk. He reared his fist back and punched the dumby in his big nose! Then he sat down, grabbed a Scissor and began attempting to carefully cut around the edges. His tongue was stuck out in concentration.
Mike went up to his Pops and whispered in his ear. His Pops was confused but went to retrieve it anyway, handing it to Mike. Mike went back over to Lucas and told him to apply it where it hurts most.
"The TV showed me Snowmen! I wanna build one, Daddy!" Sarah insisted, nearly begging. Tony couldn't say no to those eyes, but...
Tony took a deep breath, and went into a crouching mode. He dug into the ground with his tools (whatever Steve had called it), and made a hole. He gently placed the first onion into the ground, tongue stuck out in concentration. Then, he looked up at Steve, seeking approval. Steve gave a thumbs up, granting it. Xander looked curiously on.
“His name is Ulysses.” Steve showed a picture of smiling baby surrounded by small alphabet blocks. The baby was looking at the camera with big blue eyes that looked exactly like Steve’s. “Ulysses James.”
“Marry me,” Anthony gasped out as they broke the kiss. His eyes were bright and happy, his smile intoxicating and wide. He looked like everything Steven didn’t know he wanted but now that they met, Steven couldn’t imagine how he was able to live before this moment, “Marry me and take me away from this godforsaken place.”
“Um, you know-- it’s an endearment. You know, people use endearments to people they...love.” Anthony’s blush was fetching and Steven vowed he would dedicate each day of his life to elicit that blush on his face.
“I can certainly see that.” Tony nodded his assent. Steve still look puzzled until Tony told JARVIS to bring up the 411 on the Powerpuff Girls. Steve studied the cartoon for awhile before asking Ulysses, “So which are you then, Uly?”
“You got it,” Nick acquiesced, heading back to the kitchen. On his way, he passed by Adonis’ booth and greeted, “Aloha, Steve.”
” Peter sputtered in embarrassment, shooting a glare at Joe who was smirking unapologetically back at him, “she’s no one.” Peter tried in vain to hide the blush that he was pretty sure was creeping up his skin right now. Dang it, why couldn’t he have inherited Babbo’s olive-toned skin considering that the gene carrying that trait would be more dominant compared to Papa’s Irish skin gene?
“Just play, Clint.” Tony immediately cut him off. Taking Tony’s cue, the band then started up the opening chord. Surprisingly, Coulson was a part of the band as the cellist.
They were silent for awhile. Steve knew Bucky still wanted to argue with him about his decisions, but Joe silenced him.
He found Tony in the workshop, but not on his desk, tinkering on a prototype or anywhere near his car collections where he could sometimes be found playing around and making modifications on his cars. Steve spied the custom-made Chevy Camaro Tony was building for Ulysses’ 18th birthday was shoved in the furthest corner of the workshop, hidden under a tarp to hide it from prying eyes of their eldest son. He thought Tony would be working on it tonight, but instead Tony was laying down on the cot that a long time ago has been designated as Steve’s spot in the workshop.
“Seriously, uncanny.” Tony said from behind him, laying his head on Steve’s shoulder, “I feel like I just robbed the cradle. That kid is like, twenty years younger than me.”
His baby boy was waiting on the sidewalk with the chaperone and his fellow classmates, all waiting to be picked up by their own parents. Ulysses was holding a pile of papers, looking very adorable in his Hulk t-shirt and baby jeans. His face brightened up as he spotted his Babbo’s car. Ulysses bounded up to the passenger door and waited obediently for Tony to open the sliding door.
Adonis looked at the chains firmly binding Anthony to the rock, studying it. He took a step forward, putting his face closer to Anthony and this way he could see the lushness of the eyelashes framing his blue, blue eyes. Anthony was entranced, this man was unlike anyone he’d ever met before and that was a compliment. He smiled softly at Anthony and placed his big hands on the chains and said, “May I?”
The first hint that something was different was the fact that he was able to see clearly without his glasses on. Peter hadn’t been able to see without his glasses since he was 10 years old. So that was weird. Nice, but weird.
Omg you guys. I can't believe this story has been viewed more than 700 times since I first published it. I'm so grateful to everyone who took a chance on this novice writer and took the time to read and comment on the story. I'm eternally grateful <3
“What are we watching?” Tony asked. He had a jar of pickles and a tub of Miracle Whip with him. His cravings have started.
“Ugh, please stop eyefucking in front of the family. My eyes are too pure for that.” Clint whined as he walked to where they were all assembled in front of the fireplace.
Since its reconstruction after the Chitauri invasion, Avengers Tower has become something of a tourist attraction. Anyone who came to New York City for a vacation would always stop by the tower and take pictures, whether it was the outside view or the lobby.
As soon as the words left Steve’s mouth, Tony sat up in alarm, Steve’s arms grounded him to the bed, “Coulson, oh my god! Is he--”
Ulysses started to fuss, most likely getting hungry. Noticing his nephew fussing, Thor stood up and held his arm out for Tony to give the baby to him. Tony smiled appreciatively at the God of Thunder giving him a bit of reprieve while he drank his coffee. Thor set about to take the bottle out from the fridge and warmed it up in the microwave, not forgetting to test it on his wrist to make sure it wouldn’t scald Ulysses’ tongue as he drank it.
Steve regained consciousness slowly, like trying to swim to the surface but in a pool of molasses, instead of water. His head felt heavy, he felt like he was in a haze, not unlike when he first woke up from his coma after he first encountered the Winter Soldier and his whole body was sore. What the hell happened?
Thirty minutes of waiting later, they were finally released. The TSA officer apologizing to them for not believing Bucky and complemented Bucky on his metal arm. They walked to where they thought the family would be waiting. When they couldn’t find anyone at the gate, they walked to the hangar where the jet was being refueled only to find an empty hangar. Bucky and Ulysses didn’t speak for a couple of moments, eyes squinting at the lack of airplane in the hangar and trying to figure out what was going on.
Tony chuckled sardonically, “Oh yeah? And how much is that gonna set us back?” Steve continued eating his oatmeal, deciding to ignore the man’s presence and not wanting to deal with a crooked politician so early in the morning.
“Thank you, JARVIS. It’s good to be home,” Steve greeted back. It still amazed him after all these months living with Tony just how lifelike JARVIS sounded. Another testament to the genius of Tony Stark, “It went as well as we would have expected.” Which was to say it went to shit in the first five minutes, but Steve wasn’t a master strategist for nothing.
It hasn’t escaped his attention that he now had the abilities of a spider. When Uly and Joe found out about this, they would be giving him so much crap for it. But whatever, Peter thought. He’s the one with the superpower now, not them. Out of the three of them, he was the one closest to realizing their lifelong dreams of becoming a Powerpuff Girl and an Avenger, so really, Uly and Joe could bite Peter’s dust. His parents might be scared shitless though. Tony and Steve had stated numerous times that they wanted their children to have a more “normal” life, one that didn’t involve being attacked by a giant squid while walking down the streets or fighting off alien invasions on any given Sunday.  They might be less than thrilled with Peter’s new powers or might even sought to “cure” Peter of his newfound abilities.
Groot neighed again and looked at Anthony. His intelligent brown eyes zeroed in on Anthony, standing there next to Steven still holding his hand, and seemed to be studying him. Today was Anthony experienced a lot of firsts in his life, not the least of which being studied and judged by a flying winged horse. Rhodey would never believe him if he ever told him what happened to him on this day. Groot finally deemed Anthony suitable enough to accompany him and Steven, apparently, for he snorted from his nose and lowered his massive wings to the ground to let them mount him.
“I won’t tell anyone. I swear on my Ma’s life, Joe. I ain’t gonna tell,” he lowered his voice so only the two of them would be privy to the conversation, Jamie’s voice taking on that deeper baritone that made Joe shiver inside, “your secret’s safe with me.”
“Perhaps I shouldn’t be too upset about what happened since it brought me to you,” Steven chuckled, eliciting a small smile from Anthony, “I was out at sea, fishing as I usually do everyday. Clint and Natasha was accompanying me as they sometimes did. We were chatting, conversing about things that had happened, when Clint suddenly told me that I needed to go back home. When I got back, the Seriphos king, Alexander, was there along with his legions of sadistic army, in the process of forcefully taking my mother away, to forcefully marry her. They’ve beaten my father, he was laid up on the ground, bloodied and bruised, helpless to fight the violence they wrought upon him. So I stepped in, told Alexander that I was to be my mother’s champion and he challenged me to slay the Gorgon Medusa and bring her severed head to him. Only then would he release his claim on my mother and leave our family alone. I know he meant to kill me by sending me on such a fool’s errand, but I had help from some of my siblings. So I killed the Gorgon.”
The affection in Steve’s gaze was so clear it was almost overwhelming, his expression full of astonishment, of wonder, like Tony had thrown a lasso around the moon and pulled it down just for him. “You’re only saying that,” he murmured, strangely shy, hesitant. Unsure.
“I’m sorry,” Tony said immediately. He felt himself go red at the rejection, and God, when was the last time that had happened? Usually Tony was shameless, or at least unashamed, but there was something about Steve that just made him flush at the tiniest thing. “We can just ignore that. I thought... I don’t know what I thought, but yeah. Let’s just. Rewind a bit, forget that ever happened.”
Tony was far too exhausted to be embarrassed about any of it, but he still didn’t look Steve in the eyes as he sighed with a certain air of finality, an announcement that he was all done. And when Steve wrapped an arm around him, seeming suddenly so much closer than he’d been just a moment ago, Tony didn’t let himself think too much as he dropped his head onto Steve’s shoulder, resisting the urge to bury his face in Steve’s neck. “I’m sorry,” he murmured, deflated.
Tony hummed, knowing and sympathetic, and reached up to cup Steve’s cheek, thumb sweeping over the apple of it. “Hey, what’s up? You okay?” he asked, even though he already had a pretty good idea of what Steve’s answer was likely to be. He hadn’t been taking it too well, the transformation back into his pre-serum body, though it wasn't hard to understand why — Tony couldn’t even imagine what it must’ve been like, all of Steve’s old ailments flooding back, all of his insecurities and self-deprecations. He’d been benched until they could find a way to get reverse the spell, and that was the biggest kick in the teeth of all, Steve had admitted the first night after that battle, feeling so small and worthless, especially next to all these extraordinary people who could do extraordinary things.
Steve offered a sheepish, apologetic smile when he met Tony’s gaze again, and Tony couldn’t help but return it, handing him gauze pads and tape as directed, and trying not to notice how the sunlight would catch on Steve’s eyelashes whenever he looked up in thanks.
with kids, really—he’d already expended a week’s worth of patience just talking to Osborn over breakfast and didn’t have enough in his reserve to be playing babysitter all day.
There it was again, the crooked hint of a grin. “In their defense, I don’t think they knew about the dinosaurs.”
Tony doesn’t say anything after that, but Steve can practically hear the cogs turning up in that big brain of his.
It’s one of Tony’s own, which he’s probably just using as a bookmark, and when Steve opens the page to this month’s calendar to put it back, he freezes as he catches sight of a reminder in the space for next Friday, exactly a week from now.
Tony picked up the radio, about to tell Osborn off for his shitty tech breaking down way too easily, but was only met with more static.
Tony had a feeling, as soon as he shook hands with Bruce on the plane, that he’d meet the Hulk sometime over the course of the trip, but he never imagined he’d be so entirely relieved about it.
They’d spent the rest of the afternoon talking—between phases of Steve stubbornly insisting they still had time to make it back to the quinjet by evening, then nearly falling over as he tried to hobble out of the cave—which was… Well, to be honest, it was probably the most fun Tony had in the last couple months. The last year, even. It was both relieving and relaxing not have to put on a face for Steve, to be himself without expectation. To be scared so openly, frustrated, hurt. To be tired and dirty and disheveled. Steve had already seen his bare, bruised, beating heart without running in the opposite direction so Tony thought he was doing okay, for once.
“Yeah,” Tony agreed belatedly, unable to help the laugh that escaped him as he thought about just how ridiculous his life was becoming. What was next — aliens?
But before Steve could even finish his sentence, Tony shut him up with a loud, smacking kiss, all but tackling him to the mattress. They rolled back onto their sides, laughing and nuzzling their noses together, stealing kisses wherever they could reach, pulling away only enough for Tony to slip the ring onto Steve’s finger.
“Alright, big guy, relax, I’ve got you,” he said, as Steve, with a wince, slung an arm around Tony’s shoulders. “Barney & Friends managed to get a couple of good hits in. You’re bleeding.”
The facts were these: Tony couldn’t outright lie, which was a given — but he also couldn’t write down anything dishonest either, couldn’t withhold information if he was being asked about it directly, couldn’t even ask questions of his own if he was a hundred percent sure the person would answer falsely. Whenever he so much as tried, the truth would fly out of his mouth anyway, his tongue loose but his inhibitions intact, and it felt like the worst parts of being drunk. It was almost as if he were being compelled to speak more, too, to speak candidly, even when he didn’t have to. It had taken him aback, at first, and Tony’s surprise only succeeded in letting even more secrets slip through; but the more he got used to it, to the strange, dizzying feeling of the truth serum pumping through his veins, the easier it was to reel himself back in.
“You are,” he insisted. “God, look at you, you’re still as gorgeous as you were a week ago. Still kind and caring and sweet. Funny.
Honestly, there were so many reasons Tony didn’t even know where to start. “For waking you up, probably. If it wasn’t the— I don’t know, whatever pitiful sounds I was making in my sleep, it was the light from the reactor. I know I’m not the easiest bedfellow,” he said, trying for humour but falling flat. “And then, y’know. That whole breakdown just a minute ago.”
the right time to think back to his age-old crush on the guy, Tony reminded himself, if there even was a good time for these sorts of things.
Tony smiled against Steve’s skin. He took the hint. “I’ve been better,” he said, surprised by how easily the words came out, considering that was his go-to response whenever someone asked. He supposed they did ring true, though. “I don’t feel any different. A bit more anxious than usual, maybe, that I’ll say something stupid or embarrassing or something I didn’t mean to. It’s weird, actually having to think before I speak.”
“Tony! Clint!” Steve bellowed at the two men, currently standing on the bar counter singing (yelling) an Avril Lavigne song loudly and off-key. Honestly it was only 1 PM and they were already drunk of their asses and singing songs on a bar counter.
JARVIS took a couple minutes to perform all the necessary calculation. When he finished, the displayed results floated in front of Tony, lines of mathematical equations that are as familiar to Tony as every breath he took.
? You’re looking a little flushed.” he said charmingly, using that damn endearment that Steve liked so much.
“I realized then, that I have become part of system that’s comfortable with zero accountability. We do defense contracting but who are we really protecting?” he paused, “Am I really in this to protect American lives, or am I comfortable with gaining profits and protecting the bottom line at the expense of someone else’s life. I just felt like I have more to offer the world than to make things go boom, you know. Not that there’s anything with making weapons or things to explode. Hell, I like some good ole fashioned explosions myself, and I support our troops but I don’t want that to be my only legacy.”
Steve sat next to Ulysses holding his son’s gaze, blue looking into blue. Tony still standing behind their son, one hand caressing Ulysses’ hair and the other gently rubbing his back, “Ulysses, I know your first love seems like your
But it’s better than not feeling that. It’s better than living their whole life without companionship, without compassion, without having someone who always got your back until the end of the line, without having someone who fills that gaping hole you know exists inside your heart. To feel complete, you would search the ends of the Earth for that person. You would endure another seven decades (
They were left alone in their suite after the boys’ left with Clint to the beach. Steve, in contrast to his daily routine of running and working out in the morning, was laying down on one of the poolside chairs by the infinity pool that came with their room, topless and with his sunglasses on. With his hot body and handsome face, he looked like every inch of the trophy husband that other men and women Tony’s age would be clamoring to have. Tony thanked his lucky stars each and every day that someone like him would ever be worthy to be loved by someone like Steve. Brave, handsome, chivalrous, loving and amazing father Steve.
Steve was in the hospital for three months. The whole time he was there, Joe and James had to watch the light drained away from Steve’s eyes when he realized that he would never have a normal life, as they tell them again and again what had happened to him. When they took him home, Joe came up with a crazy idea to let Steve believe that it was still Saturday three months ago. He enlisted James’ help to keep up the ruse, sequestering Steve away from his friends, his life before the accident, his students and anyone that wasn’t in Steve’s life on October 13th.
“Captain Rogers, welcome.” he greeted them as they filed into the church. Easter service just concluded, judging by the amount of cars and people milling around outside. They were surprised at the Avengers’ presence in their church, rightly so. It wasn’t everyday that Earth’s Mightiest Heroes came to their neck of the woods.
“About how lucky I am. How I never in a million years could have dreamt up something as perfect as this life I now have with you. Tony, I always thought I wouldn’t live past twenty five, but here I am now: about to embark on the most exciting journey of my life with you.”
Tony looked up at Steve, deep brown eyes swimming in tears, and he looked beyond devastated and in pain. As Tony hoarsely said, “I’m sorry, Steve. I lost it.” Steve felt his heart broke along with Tony’s, grieving with him at the loss of a child they loved wholeheartedly but would never meet.
“Yeah.” Tony nodded, absently. Admittedly, he wasn’t expecting this. He knew of Steve’s faith but he wasn’t expecting Steve to be pro-choice. But hearing how the issue was perceived at the time Steve was growing up and who Steve had as a mother, it was not too surprising for him to be more understanding on the issue than most Alphas and Betas were. Tony should have known better, Steve lived to surprise him after all.
” Peter greeted them, swiping an apple from a fruit bowl on the counter for a snack later on the field trip.
Tony deflated at Steve’s words and sighed harshly. Coulson shouldn’t have died, Tony should have been stronger. He should have been able to heal him, but was all should haves and they wouldn’t bring Coulson back. Tony was just not strong enough, period. From the moment he failed Yinsen to not being strong enough to prevent the death of a good man like Coulson.
Tony rolled his eyes and Joe just drooled into Tony’s shirt, unimpressed by everything that just occurred around him.
“I’m gonna make him an offer he can’t refuse.” he said in a poor imitation of Brando’s accent while petting the cat.
“I feel like you're driving me to a court-martial. This is crazy. What did I do?” Tony was in Afghanistan for a weapons demo for the Army higher ups, demonstrating the newest weapon in SI’s pipeline, the Jericho missile. It was a good demo, if Tony said so himself. They were impressed, as if they could ever be anything other than impressed, and now he was on the way back to Bagram Air Base for the flight back stateside. But before that, he had to deal with these Army kids, intimidated by his reputation, “I feel like you're going to pull over and snuff me. What, you're not allowed to talk? Hey, Forrest!”
“Good,” Dr. Rosenberg said, “we’ll see how we’re doing in a couple of weeks and reassess the situation again. Don’t be too alarmed, Tony and Steve. As I’ve said, we caught it early and now we can monitor it more closely before anything else happen.”
“You’re right, Steve. Jane never was fond of my attachments here with the Avengers. I don’t think she ever accepted my decision to move to New York to live with you all. She never understood that you are all my family, not just a group of people I fought with.”
“No!” Tony vehemently denied, “there’s nothing to be guilty about, like I told Steve before. Barnes was under HYDRA control. You can’t hold someone accountable for what they’d done under someone’s coercion. I forgave him for that a long time ago.”
They went to a Tiffany’s that morning to pick up the mating bands. Tony chose a sensible plain golden ring for Steve, hefty and solid in his hands, just the way Steve preferred it. A solid reminder of Tony’s love and their bond in his hand, day in and day out. For Tony, Steve chose a platinum mating band, strong, durable and without any embellishments that would interfere with Tony’s work in the shop. Tony smiled fondly at him at his consideration and leaned his body close to Steve’s placing his arms around Steve’s waist and whispered to him, “You know me so well.” They had the rings engraved: Steve’s with Tony’s name and Tony’s ring bore Steve’s name. They went to a Washington DC city hall, filed the paperwork for a mating license then had a justice of peace officiate the ceremony with two of the city clerks as witnesses. It was simple, it was uncomplicated, it was what they wanted their relationship to be.
“Really, Peter?” Jamie’s left eyebrow arched in disbelief, “We really gonna do this? I know it was you, Peter. First you said my name, then proceed to ramble about it like there’s no tomorrow. Then you called my mom Mrs. Wilde, plus there’s no ignoring the fact that you tried to make your voice sound deeper but it only made you sound like that time you had a sore throat from strep infection. Also now that I have a chance to see you in broad daylight, Spiderman looks to be about your height and build. Am I wrong, Peter?”
Tony was futilely holding back tears as he listened to Steve’s speech. There was only one answer he would be giving but the emotions welling up inside was making it hard to speak. He just squeezed Steve’s hand in response.
Steve squeezed his hand and kissed him chastely on the lips. “Three boys. What am I gonna do with three boys?” Steve shook his head disbelievingly.
In hindsight, Tony shouldn’t have been surprised by the fact that it happened, only that it took this long to happen at all. He and Steve had been lucky so far. Guess the Fates were trying to be lenient to them after all the clusterfuck that was their lives leading up to meeting each other (and some time after that). But as the old adage said nothing lasted forever.
Tony. It was Tony. That lovely voice, that beautiful face, that mesmerizing scent. It could be none other than Steve’s mate, the center of his universe.
When the call came to relocate to Hawai’i, Sarah took it in stride while Steve, at the tender age of 6, was upset for having to leave Brooklyn behind. Joe assured him that Steve would still get to visit Grandda and Grandma on Summer vacations and that Hawai’i has a lot of fun places to explore during the school year. So they moved, and the Marines gave them a house in Kane’ohe, near the base. During their first years in Hawai’i, Sarah noticed that Steve’s asthma attacks became more infrequent. It seemed the clean Hawai’ian air, free of smog and pollution, was good on their son. As years went by, Steve’s health issues seemed to lessen. He was still skinny and small for his age, but Joe and Sarah were no longer worried that their son wouldn’t live to see 25.
“You gonna have to get off me if you want me to get it, though.” The pounding intensified, trying to remind them that whoever it was was still there outside of their apartment.
” Ulysses cried out pitifully at the mention of his father. He looked around hoping to find him, but to no avail. Then he looked back at Steve, “
Tony returned to their apartment that night feeling all out of sorts. The truth was he didn’t know how to feel. One one hand, he felt awed and humbled at the great lengths to which his employees went through to cover up what they thought murder committed by himself and Steve. Tony had always believed this band of ragtag misfits that worked for them were a solid group. To him and Steve, they felt more like family than people they worked with. These latest showing of obstruction of justice and deceit to the police showed how strongly they had each others’ backs, working as a strong unit, a phalanx defending and shielding each other. Even though what they managed to accomplish was obfuscation based on preconceived notions of what the current facts showed, Tony felt relieved that he could count on them to watch his and Steve’s back. It’s quite worrying how their friends easily believed that Steve would be capable of killing someone for Tony. Clint’s words when he showed them the Lost and Found echoed in Tony’s mind.
And Joe could do naught but nodded. Looking at Steve, he remembered the message his late father imparted to him when they found out that Sarah was pregnant. His father had said that his “children didn’t ask to be born into this world, they exist because you will them to and because of that you made a pact with this new life you’re creating to take care of them always, until you can’t anymore and it’s their turn to take care of you, if the choose to do so.”
Grabbing a deep red patterned dressing robe that was a size too small for him, Steve tied the sash around his waist to preserve a modicum of modesty, though at this point Steve wasn’t really concerned. Anyone who’s coming to his house before 7 AM and disturbing his mate’s much needed sleep could deal with his nudity. Steve walked to the front door.
Steve rolled his eyes, wounding his arms around Tony, hugging him tightly and reveling in the rightness of Tony in his arms, “Let’s try and enjoy this rare moment as Tony and Steve, not Babbo and Papa for once. Have I told you how amazing you look tonight?”
“Let me walk you to class?” Joe was powerless to say no. And to be honest, he didn’t really want to.
“You’re you.” Tony gestured up and down to his whole body, “you have hipster sense of humor before hipster was even a thing. You’re O.G. hipster. Of course that book with all its weird ass humor would be right up your alley.”
All in all, it was a fucking impressive statue, fit to be displayed in the Louvre or maybe the Trevi fountain, if Tony said so himself. The artist, a local New Yorker who went to Steve’s alma mater, did an amazing job at sculpting their likeness and with picking the poses so they looked very dynamic though they were stationary. Adding to the majesty of the statue was the thousands of origami paper cranes suspended above the statue symbolizing the people who lost their lives during the Invasion. At night, the cranes would become illuminated with fairy lights, lending a more solemn, hallowed countenance to the whole display.
-- took the final plunge to move their relationship to the next level. What the fuck, Steve, talk about dropping a Jericho-missile sized revelation on someone. Tony didn’t know what to do, didn’t know what to feel. It felt a lot like he was whiplashed in a car accident.
“So, I’m unfaithful and you’re a murderer. We’re a very exciting couple.” Tony exclaimed, eyes gleaming with amusement at the ridiculous notion. “And here I thought everything goes downhill after mating.”
Anyways, writing this chapter was nice. because I get to be in denial that Steve and Tony are still happy and will stay alive for a long long long time.
The thing was Jane and Thor looked like they had an expiration date. Despite Steve’s pep talk the other day, and Thor’s efforts to fight to save their relationship, things seemed doomed to fail. Jane seemed her affable and approachable self. She chatted extensively with Bruce earlier when she arrived, talking about her latest endeavour in studying the Einstein-Rosen bridge, with Tony chiming in once in awhile in the conversation. When Thor came by to take her out for lunch, however things started to go down hill. The light and exuberance that were in her eyes shuttered down, leaving only slight annoyance and resignation at Thor’s interruption. Jane plastered on a fake smile, one that Thor mirrored.
This was the worst that could happen, Tony thought. Stranded at the Pali highway, with a broken down car. Dammit, he knew he shouldn’t have taken the car out for a drive. She wasn’t ready! This was the last time he’d ever, ever take Nat’s advice on anything mechanical. Thankfully, he managed to get ahold of Happy, but the man was currently all the way over on the Windward side of the island, being forehead of security, and Tony hadn’t wanted to bother any of his Stark Resilient employees in Honolulu, since it wasn’t in their job description to pick the boss up from the side of the highway. So now, he has at least one hour to kill and with nothing else to do, he decided he might as well get some late breakfast at one of the roadside diner he spied along the way.
Tony’s eyes widened in horror at the thought of spending the night with Thor and Jane. He could just imagine how awkward the meal would be. From Steve’s position on the couch, he sat facing Tony while Thor had his back to him and readily saw his mate shaking his head frantically, silently signaling to Steve to reject the offer with extreme prejudice. He added his frantic head shake with an arm gesticulating wildly and making a throat slitting motion telling Steve to nip everything in the bud. Unfortunately that was the moment Joe spotted his Babbo and the baby, unaware of the significance of Tony’s arm movements, thinking it was a wild and amusing dance move, squealed brightly in amusement and drawing Thor’s attention to Tony.
Maybe that’s why he decided to name this new artificial intelligence system he’s developing after his late companion. JARVIS, Just A Rather Very Intelligent System. Tony chuckled, Jarvis would have gotten a laugh out of it. Tony stretched his back, he fell asleep on the drafting table again, working on the latest simulation for the arc reactor’s newest prototype. He was close to getting a working model, an efficient one that would be able to power the entirety of the Stark’s factory in Long Island and Irvine. The finished simulation showed that he was indeed close. He solved the efficiency problem, just not as cost effective as one would like. Oh well, gotta pay for progress right?
“So what else did the myths get right?” Anthony asked his betrothed (because Steven was his betrothed, thank you very much. It was only a matter of time) as they broke through a clump of fluffy clouds to fly above the skies, “Did Athena really sprung out from Zeus’ head, fully armored? Was Aphrodite really formed from sea foams? Does Hera truly hate all the demigods that Zeus sired with mortal women? Oh, but you’re one of those demigods. You know, ignore that last question. That sounds very offensive when I say it out loud.”
“Hi Peter,” the deep baritone calling out his name stopped Peter in the middle of retrieving his Physics textbook from his locker. He turned around to come face to face with none other than Jamie Wilde leaning against the row of lockers, hands in his pockets and a bland and sort of neutral smile etched on his face. Peter’s newly christened ‘Spidey sense’ didn’t go haywire as it was wont to do whenever there was a threat near. At school those threats usually came in the form of Flash Thompson or one of the meaner jocks and pretty girls, but never from Jamie. Jamie might be a jock but he was always kind to Peter and his group of friends. He never bullied them or call them names and was actually one of the few who stood up for them, telling his fellow football players that bullying was off limits and would result in them getting kicked off the team.
“You never talk about him. I’m just curious.” Tony shrugged, his brown eyes lifted up to gaze into Steve’s blue ones.
It was then that Tony realized something was off. He felt nauseous. He glanced down at the styrofoam container filled with cold noodles in front of him and the nausea dissipated. He glanced back up to the counter and the nausea came back in full force. Glanced down, no nausea. Stared back up, nausea again. He moved his head up and down a few times, trying to make sure that it wasn’t all in his head.
.” Tony pointed at his head for emphasis, “I wasn’t afraid you were gonna run out with him in that sense, but more in the sense that you’d realize that the past was better than the future, and then I’d have to raise Ulysses by myself.”
She and her friend, Brianna Wang, were visiting New York City for their winter break. It was a good way to spend break before heading back to school where a mountain of work awaited them. They had booked tickets to go see the Statue of Liberty long before their trip, only to find out that on the day of their reservation, it would be raining the whole day. So they went to Liberty Island in spite of the rain, took pictures under the gloomy clouds and went around the city afterwards, cold, wet and annoyed.
Tony gaped at Steve’s words, clearly a reference to what Tony said to him when they were arguing back in the lab, “Wha-- Ste-- I mean, Rogers, don’t take that to heart, I was just--”
Barton came in next, he looked like he was still sleeping judging by the closed eyes. But he managed to find the fridge with great accuracy, not once tripping or bumping other furnitures in his way, and took out a box of orange juice and drank it straight from the carton.
Also, I totally took the "robbing the cradle and the retirement home" line from Wordsplat. I have such a writer crush on her. She's so amazing
Peter was on patrol in Williamsburg that night. It was pretty uneventful as far as patrol night went. There was only one cat stuck up a tree which Peter easily rescued and delivered back to the loving arms of the nine year old girl who owned him. There was a false alarm for a car thief which turned out to just be some dude who was tipsy and was looking for his keys. It turned out the bartender took his keys when it looked like he was on the verge of intoxication and had called him an Uber, so Peter decided to wait with the guy until the Uber came, listening to drunk guy lament on the sorry state of his love life, chiming in every now and then with words of consolation. All in all, it was a pretty successful night of patrol.
Steve carried Tony carefully up to their room after Tony told him that the cramps have let up. Tony curled in towards Steve’s body, squeezing him tightly and the slight hitchings of his breath told Steve that his mate was holding back his tears. Tony was in pain, both physically and emotionally. Steve couldn’t even begin to imagine how heartbroken Tony was at this moment. If Steve was reeling from this loss, then Tony’s grief must be a thousand times more devastating than his. Tony was the one who had to feel his own body rejecting their baby. No, it wasn’t a baby. It was a zygote, a fertilized egg with no ability to perceive pain. It hasn’t reached viability.
“Mm-hmm, tight and form fitting, just the way every warm blooded Betas and Omegas, and some Alphas like you in it.” Tony winked at Steve.
“We’ll make sure of that, doctor.” Natasha answered for them. Steve was busy looking at his reflection in the mirror they provided him, trying to find the resemblance to Johnny Storm like Tony and Natasha declared earlier.
to be. But after meeting Steven, Anthony didn’t know what was mythical and what was real anymore. Honestly he shouldn’t have been so surprised by anything that was happening in his life. The appearance of the sea monster should have been the primary clue that nothing in this world was ever as it seemed. Steven’s appearance in his life was a blessing, his existence a sign of the wonders that occured in this world away from prying eyes. Now Anthony wanted to know more, wanted to know everything there was to know about Steven and his life, how he came to cross paths with Anthony, what his family was like, what was it like to grow up as a demigod in a human’s world. So many questions to ask, Anthony was nothing if not curious and precocious. It’s what made him a good scientist and engineer.
With the boba, oranges and now meatballs, it became clear that Tony now has an aversion to spherical objects. For some reason, he just couldn’t stand the sight of it. He couldn’t watch a soccer game (not that he watch too many of those games anyway) or a basketball game. Baseball games were a bit okay because the ball was too small to look at from the television screen or from the seats in the stadium, if Tony and Steve went to a baseball game for date night.
“I’m a trained chef. Finest culinary schools in Europe, I’m a James Beard nominated Chef and I interned with freaking Wolfgang Puck
“You want to name our child after a novel? That James Joyce novel nobody in the English speaking world could understand?”
“Oh, you guys are back.” Bruce’s voice filtered into the room, “I made butter chicken for dinner tonight. I know it’s your favorite, Thor. Hope it can help cheer you up,” the way Bruce said it piqued Tony’s interest, and he opened his eyes to see Bruce staring bashfully at Thor. and what’s even more interesting was Thor returning said smile wholly and gleefully.
“When I was pregnant with Pete. And you had just been blown up by AIM and was working on regrowing 75% of the skin on the left side of your body, Steve. So forgive me if I made the executive decision not to tell you about something that wasn’t relevant anymore since Bruce had cleared me of any complications by that point. What was the point in worrying with something inconsequential?”
“You need to grow up, Steve!” was the last thing he heard Bucky said to him. Which was probably the only truth he said to Steve that night.
“Hi, Papa!” the people gathered around them giggled at Ulysses’ antics. Joe started clapping as he saw his father’s likeness on the bronze statue before him and started squirming and whining to be let out of the stroller so he could be closer to the statue.
After walking for 2 miles, he reached the diner sporting a banner proclaiming to be the Hukilau Cafe. Tony went inside, and sat on the counter. He checked his phone while waiting to be served. Nothing noteworthy going on in the world, Happy was still on the way, and the angry text he sent Natasha blaming her about his car breaking down was only answered with laughing emoji.
“I don’t know,” Joe placed his hand on Peter’s heart, relieved to feel the twitching of Peter’s pulse on his fingers, “he’s still breathing,” Joe breathed out. “Oh thank God,” he sighed with relief.
“Stop swearing in front of the baby,” Natasha chastised him. She was sitting in the center on the chaise they dragged up here, resplendent in a purple floor length gown.
“Hey guys,” Joe greeted them, and four pairs of eyes snapped up to meet his own, “did I miss something? Have we been transported to a parallel universe where nerdiness and geekdom are the cool thing to be?”
As he gazed down at the beloved face of his son, he felt an overwhelming sense of love and protectiveness. There was nothing he wouldn’t do for his son, his life would be the least of whatever he would give up for him.
“If you want me to call you ‘Steve’, then you must call me Vincent.” the priest answered Steve jokingly.
The maintenance crew finally announced that the jet had finished refueling and the engine had passed inspection for the next leg of journey. The Avengers then proceeded to board the plane. Steve carrying Tony over his shoulder and Joe wrapped around his torso like a spider monkey. Peter carried his Papa’s art portfolio case that contained the shield, feeling proud that he was entrusted with such an important task. As they all piled in on to the jet, nobody seemed to be noticing that they were missing two of their family members. Both of whom were still held for questioning by the TSA.
Steve stared silently at his brother. His face probably looked pathetic right now. “This is what happened. They get into a thing. Goes south. Tony figures that it’s not true love, that Killian only wanted him for your bar.” Steve abruptly stood up, he couldn’t listen to this shit. Not from his own brother, the man he trusted with his life as he spouted lies about his mate.
“Yes, Steve, it’s fine. Might be awhile before he’s comfortable with Ulysses by himself and vice versa but we’ll cross that bridge when we get there.” Tony said.
“Tony,” Steve reached out to him, gently placing his hand on Tony’s clenched fist, “Sweetheart, do you not want this?”
“Yesterday, me and Uncle Sam were watching cartoons. And then-- then the Powerpuff Girls came on. And they were so cool, Babbo! They’re little, like me and Joe, but they have super powers, just like you and Papa and the ‘Vengers! Uncle Sam said that real men watch Powerpuff Girls.”
“He can be petty AF and holds grudges,” Peter dismissed it, “He still harps on Uly for breaking his homemade telescope, and that happened twelve years ago.”
Speechless, Steven disbelievingly put a hand on the cheek Anthony just kissed, eyes wide open in astonishment. It felt warm, Anthony’s touch light as it were stoked the flames within him. “Be on your way now, soldier. Time waits for no man.”
“With Clint,” Tony answered with a sigh, “He found out that Ulysses can count cards. They’re playing Blackjack right now.”
“Steve? Babe, what’s going on? Are you okay?” Tony must have noticed his presence and seen how he was gaping like a fish out of water at the corner of his workshop. Tony tentatively took  a step towards him, unsure if his touch was welcomed and Steve-- Steve couldn’t stand the thought of Tony thinking Steve would ever deny him his touches.
Steve smiled down at Tony and his new son, his heart swelling with uncontainable love and affection. He beckoned Clint and Bucky to bring Ulysses and Joe to them, to let them meet their newest brother. Ulysses ran toward them immediately, cuddling up to Tony to see his new little brother closer. Clint gave Joe to Steve, the boy now held in Steve’s free arm, as his other one was curled around Tony. Joe’s baby blue eyes took in the sight in front of him, the boy cooing in curiosity at the newcomer.
“I mean he can deny it all he wants but he was super upset when you started dating that cheerleader. Everybody in the family thought he was being morose because some knothead asshole said some mean words to him, but really, it was because he saw Cheryl Feinberg changed her relationship status on Facebook from ‘single’ to ‘in a relationship’ with you. I think he’s still upset, actually.”
“I think I know why he’s home and not out with his friends.” Tony walked to the kitchen, Steve following suit, to saw one of the saddest things he’s ever seen in his life. Clint and Sam was seated at the counter, staring pityingly at their oldest nephew who had laid his head despondently on the kitchen counter. They looked up as they saw Tony approached his son, their faces communicated just how weirded out they felt by Ulysses’ behavior. Peter playing games on his tablet, casting worried glances at his brother.
“Yes. And then she died from injuries sustained from HYDRA attack and trying to heal everyone on base. Seventy years later, I saw you do the same thing. Do you think it’s a coincidence, Tony?” Steve asked him rhetorically, already knowing what Tony would say in response. Tony had hoped that it wouldn’t come to this. He hoped that he would have more time to slowly ease Steve into it, or never tell him about any of it. But of course, life had to fuck him up once again by making him show his little secret in front of Steve.
Tony shot Steve a look that said ‘I know what we’ll be doing once Ulysses was down for his nap’. Steve flushed a fetching shade of red much to his amusement.
“Come on…” Peter started pulling on Joe’s arm, the one not holding the bowl, urging him to finish up so they could go.
They bought another television to install in the bedroom, and somehow Steve and Tony’s bedroom now became the common room during the daytime. All of the Avengers seemed to gravitate towards their bedroom when they didn’t have any prior engagements, or out on a mission. They would take turns accompanying Tony, especially if Steve had to head upstate for some urgent business at the headquarters.
A few minutes later, the raucous footsteps that signalled the arrival of the buffalo herd Steve and Tony had for sons could be heard approaching the master bedroom. The bedroom door slammed open and Steve winced as the boys were apparently caught up in an argument about who would win a fight, Godzilla or King Ghidorah, if Godzilla didn’t have humans helping him.
“It’s Jamie Wilson from the football team. The quarterback,” Peter piped up, ignoring Joe’s glare at him the whole time.
“Oh I know,” Peter concurred, “it’s been hardcore pining for the last nine years. It’s like the floodgates have busted open now and they’re making up for nine years of not being able to be disgustingly sweet with each other.”
“Yes, nobody can see you, brother.” Natasha appeared next to Clint, her face impassive but her eyes betrayed her, “we have no idea what happened to you after you entered the cave.”
Adonis had the nerve to blush, making Anthony more infatuated with him, “I’m Steven of Seriphos. And you are?”
Horrified at the prospect of Tony upchucking on their lunch, Sam hurriedly threw a towel on the fruit bowl. Tony breathed a sigh of relief as his nausea abated, but when he looked across the counter at Natasha, he said “Can you also cover up the bobas? I can’t look at them right now.”
“No, of course not. Maybe, I’m just scared. Scared that now he had the one thing that connects him to the past back, he wouldn’t want his future anymore. I know, it’s illogical but fears and doubts aren’t known to be rational.”
Jamie’s brain was working on overdrive all the way home. That voice and that rambling devoid of any pause was familiar. There was only one person in the whole wide world who sounded and talked just like Spiderman did. The kid didn’t even bother doing anything to disguise his voice other than the sad attempt of making his voice sounded deeper, which to Jamie just sounded like he was having a sore throat more than anything.
Steven chuckled in response and hugged him tighter, “But still, in a roundabout way Clint brought you to my life. If he didn’t heal my sickness as a child, I would be dead. And if he didn’t direct his priestess and your father to sacrifice you, I might have never met you.”
“Steve, what is all this?” Tony asked, wide eyed in astonishment at the set up in front of them. And there were their families. Clint was standing under the wooden gate, a lei around his neck and wearing a garish Hawaiian shirt of koi fishes and plumerias. Natasha was standing by the chairs, in a beautiful red sundress, her hair braided with fresh flowers, hand in hand with Bucky, who was also wearing a Hawaiian shirt and lei. Bruce and Thor stood on the other side of the aisle, across from Natasha and Bucky. Aurora in their arms, looking like the prettiest baby in the universe with her dress and the flowers in her hair. Sam and Rhodey (oh, my God Rhodey was here!) were also there with them, and completing the picture was Tony’s sons, Ulysses, Joe and Peter standing at the very end of the aisle, bright smiles on their faces and Joe carrying a bouquet of white peonies, pink roses and succulents, fidgeting exuberantly in his place.
“Uh, you sure, Thor?” Steve asked, “Bruce bought some more of that Eggos you like. I can heat some up for you if you want.”
In the seventeen years since he took over executive and scientific leadership of Stark Industries, Tony managed to make the company grew even bigger. Since Obie said that weapons were their thing, their bread and butter, Tony took that adage to heart and developed better and smarter weapons, better than any available in the market. Growing and expanding SI’s market shares and catapulting them as the number one weapons contractor for the US Department of Defense. And from the profits of the weapons sales, Tony funded his true passion: SI’s research programs; developed a new subsidiary of Stark Industries that specialized in medical devices and medical technologies; funded the Maria Stark Foundation to provide scholarships and fellowships for underprivileged students across the country to pursue higher education; established research institutes devoted for sustainable energy and biomedical researches.
“What brings you here? I told your Dad and Barnes that I’ll be back in the afternoon to pick you up so we can hang out.” Steve smiled and tilted his head, acknowledging Tony’s words. “I needed to see you,” he started. Steve was nervous, he started fiddling the journal he brought with him.
Tony was torn between relief and sadness at the fact that Steve was away from home. On one hand, he was glad that his lover wasn’t here to witness another pathetic episode of Tony having nightmares, yet at the same time he longed for those warm arms to comfort him. Steve’s deep baritone soothing him, telling him that it was just a dream, the beat of Steve’s heart assuring Tony that he was real and that he was here with Tony and that he wouldn’t let anything hurt Tony anymore. Not the invading aliens, not the terrorists that waterboarded him, not HYDRA. Nothing would get past Steve.
“I’ve told you little about myself. How I came to be, other than how I’m one of Zeus’ progeny.” Steven steeled himself for telling the whole story, “My mother, Sarah, was-- is, I presume, the Princess of Argos. Her father, Thaddeus of Argos, in an effort to obtain a male heir went to the Oracle at Delphi for advice but received none of that. He came home and the first thing he did was to lock up my mother in a tower sequestered from any human contact. But then Zeus saw her and then I was born. After I was born, Thaddeus locked us up in a wooden chest and set us adrift on the ocean. To die. But we washed ashore on Seriphos and the man I came to know as my father, Joseph, found us and gave us a home. And for the last twenty five years, our lives were peaceful until a few days ago when something awful happened.”
“He takes the fun out of everything.” Tony whispered conspiratorially at an amused Jane, eliciting a laughter out of the astrophysicist. Thor rolled his eyes, more than used to Tony’s antics and ushered Jane out of the room with a hand resting on the small of her back.
It was lunch time and since Steve still couldn’t move his left hand, Tony had been the one feeding him his breakfast, lunch, dinner and everything in between. Steve vacillated between embarrassed and delighted at how much Tony was catering to his every whim.
“Steve’s the best for you. But I’ll take second place gracefully.” Bruce smiled softly before he went to fetch said wheelchair.
“Honest Abe, huh?” Tony stopped his wandering of the Memorial in front of the statue. Lincoln’s solemn face gave him no answer. “Have you really never told a lie? Not even a white lie? A lie of omission? Not even when comforting Mary Todd about the carriage accident that might have been an assassination plot on you? Even national icons lie, you know. Found that out pretty recently myself.”
My apologies for the late update. I guess I was just feeling meh about this story since there wasn't that many kudos and comments on it, so I thought no one was interested, and I worked on other stories instead.
Their breakfast lasted long into brunch then lunch and all the way to early afternoon, which was when the restaurant kicked them out when they stopped serving dim sum and had to close to prepare for dinner. After that, they went to Coney Island, where Ulysses, Joe and Peter rode the cyclone with Bucky and Clint while Steve steered clear from any roller coasters and opted to play shooting games, winning a huge stuffed rabbit for Tony much to the billionaire’s amusement. The highlight of the day was when Thor played the strongman game and in his excitement hit the mallet so hard, the puck came flying off the tower, crashing onto one of the shooting game stands that cheated Sam out of his money. Sam laughed his ass off, claiming it was karma against the carnie, while Tony good naturedly compensated both vendors in exchange for them not suing the Avengers for destruction of civilian properties.
“Where’s Uly?” Steve asked him as he assembled the sandwiches for both him and Tony. A smaller portion of bite size corned beef in a plastic dinosaur shaped bowl prepared for Ulysses' lunch.
Jamie felt the soft hands on his cheeks, he didn’t expect to feel the soft press of Joe’s lips on his, however. It was better than he ever imagined. Joe was soft and pliant in his arms, his scent filling up Jamie’s every senses, filling up each and every empty space he didn’t knew existed within him or around him.
Bucky Barnes didn’t know what to expect when he first turned himself in to the Avengers at Stark Tower. Over the year and with his fact-finding mission, he started to remember most of everything that occurred when he was under HYDRA influence. And more importantly he started to remember his life when he was still Sergeant Bucky Barnes of the 107th Battalion. He remembered fighting with Steve, his fall in the Alps and everything that came after that. With the fall of SHIELD, and HYDRA within it, it left him with a void. Now, for the first time as long as he could remember, there were no missions.
“Aww, Buck, you’re good.” Steve commiserate, “ It’s almost as if you’re the football player and not me. You should be a coach,” Steve stood up and left the room to clean up the paints before dinner.
“Yes, someone smashed the victim’s head against the wall. Knocked him out.” Jarvis replied absentmindedly. He was preoccupied with the numerous cables and plugs he needed to sort out for the stage. “And then came back, finished him off with a shot to the chest. Very cold blooded execution, that.” He turned to face Bruce. His friend’s mouth was gaping open, not unlike a goldfish as Jarvis recalled the information.
