to eradicate.” Steve moved to head-butt him but Tony dodged, and tightened his grip on Steve’s wrist in reprimand. “And now your old fuck buddy’s running around Europe killing god knows how many people and that’s
Steve hollowed out his cheeks, sucking harder, before he groaned and came. Tony could tell by the way the rhythm of his hips stuttered, how he ground his hips in as deep as he could get them. His body was taunt and his throat convulsed around Tony’s cock, and Tony whined a desperate, “Oh, oh,
feel the need to have a future-related breakdown, he has the sense to at least do it in the privacy of his own suite.
“Tony,” he says slowly, “I’ve never baked anything in my life.” Aside from the times he helped his mother by stirring batter—but surely that doesn’t count.
“Then enjoy your blue balls, ‘cause you’re not getting my mouth again.”
fuck me Tony, pound me into the mattress if you can even manage it.”
what you want or you won’t get it. You want to be good don’t you?” He reaches into his pajama bottoms and pulls out his own half-hard cock. “Call me daddy,” he says, nudging the head against Steve’s chin.
He was horrified, angry, hurt, and ashamed all at once and damn Tony for thinking it was actually kind of a good look for him. He could’ve kissed that hurt away. Or offered to reciprocate, suck Steve off and even up the score.
He dropped his forehead against Steve’s as he continued his thrusts and Steve wrapped an arm around his shoulders. This felt—it felt so fucking good, and not just the sex but being held like that, with Steve so solid and warm. This was not the Steve in his head, the Captain America of his childhood because he was no longer Captain
This is almost as good.
“You just can’t compliment anyone without complimenting yourself in the process, can you?” Steve says, focusing on tightening his hold on the armour and god
“You don’t even know what I was gonna say.”
“P’ease?”
“You’re a fucking idiot–”
“No, that was my fault,” the pretty girl sitting in front of them says, right before she holds out her hand to Tony. “Margaret Carter, but call me Peggy, please.”
,” Tony grumbles, but when Steve drops his arms to tug him closer, he goes without a fight.
God, how he tries...
“Which is it, then? You ‘Daddy’, or ‘Papa’? Hey, Remy! C’mere, boy! Love
“Can you… will you look at me? Please?”
“I’ve lost count of how many times you’ve told me th–”
It's normal for Tony to get caught up in the numbers. Whether they’re business or superhero related, he's usually down and crunching in seconds, and this time it's no different-- there's arrow adjustments for Clint that are top priority, and then he has end of the quarter figures Pepper sent him for SI, and there's a glitch in Butterfinger's code that he can't figure out no matter how many times he types in the numbers, then he has tech specs for the new Stark phone--
Tony just grins down at the baby. “Papa’s just cranky ‘cause he hasn’t had a good chance to hold you all day."
“Bite me.”
“Oh–” Steve’s eyes grow wide, “no, I– sorry, I meant– yours, I meant yours, I don’t… know why I, uh–“
“So thorough,” Tony moans loudly. Bucky pretends to gag.
“You know,” Tony points out, “you're actin’ pretty smug for a guy who almost cried on the way here--”
Stony Christmas prompt #25: "I'm not jealous."
“I can’t believe you didn’t tell me,” he says, and then winces when the wrench Tony’s holding falls to the floor with a loud clatter.
But all of that... it’s no match for the part of him that wants to open those doors and run into the arms of the only person he’s ever loved unconditionally.
“Boo,” Natasha murmurs, and giggles into Tony’s neck.
- - - - -
“Always had ‘em,” Tony answers. “But luckily, there are also these amazing little things called contacts.” Steve’s eyes haven’t stopped running all over his face, and Tony breathes a sigh. “They’re not that bad, are they, Cap?”
thing to do, and it’s so like these two to rub off on each other so much, after all the time they spend together.
“...Can I help?”
“Why are you talking to me like I’m a child?”
“Didn’t you?”
“Hey, I didn’t--” Tony starts, but then Steve’s moving away and there’s more people, and they’re probably the paramedics, he knows that, but everything’s suddenly too close and the sky is still so fucking bright and
“Fine,” Steve sighs. “One hour, and then you’re mine.”
And even with the rain still falling around them, cool and fresh, Tony welcomes the anticipation unfurling in his chest like sunshine.
“Come on--”
No. Not ‘friend’.
“Worth the cold?”
"Oh, great, they've seen us."
Then he sees his patient, and everything else falls away.
“Oh, look at this one, this was the first one I put up,” Tony pulls up a picture of their baby at her high chair in the kitchen, looking up at the camera with wide blue eyes as she gives it a gummy grin. There’s a blob of apple sauce leaking out the corner of her mouth, but she’s still the most amazing thing Tony’s ever seen.
“Thanks... I think?” Blondie smiles again.
“You know it. JARVIS, take it away,” Steve says, and when a new song starts–-
"I'm right, aren't I?" His friend’s smile only gets bigger. "Okay, it's Pepper time."
Steve’s eyes are bright and blue over the rim of his coffee mug as he takes a sip. “Last night was poker night,” he says, and--
“Well, you’re in there too, so I’m hoping it will be.”
Barnes, Sam, and Clint– and Rhodey, too, the bastard– all roar with laughter, and even Natasha lets out a tiny chuckle.
“Obviously,” he grins. “It’s the least you could do after dragging me out of bed to walk a cat. Jesus, it’s so fucking ridiculous…”
“Tony,” he whispers, every inch of him still tense where he sits.
Because Steve has a growth spurt.
Tony shrugs. “Multitasking. I’m a working man-- tell him I’m a working man, bella.”
“You’re damn fucking right it would,” Tony glares, but Steve just smiles, and goes back to counting the bills in his hand.
“Tony…” he hears Steve’s voice, soft but unwaveringly firm– like the hand resting solidly on his shoulder– and slowly but surely, it brings him back.
“Love you too, Shellhead.”
His voice breaks on the last syllable, but it doesn’t matter because a second later, Steve’s surging up to cup the back of Tony’s neck and kissing him, pouring what feels like every conceivable emotion into it.
“I can’t--
“... Okay,” Blondie says.
“I said– never mind, just get out here, please?”
“Don’t be ridiculous--”
“You can’t…” Tony looks down. “You can’t fight everyone that has shit to say about me.”
“Not usually the response I get from you,” Tony’s wide awake now, for sure, and Steve is quick to wrap his arms around the brunet’s waist.
“We’re having a moment, don’t ruin it.”
“Oh shit,” Tony breathes, heart picking up speed because he has an inkling of what’s going on and
Well, Steve’s never seen anything even half as gorgeous.
Clint looks amused and offended all at once. “I’d rather watch ‘em. And you squirming the whole time.”
The sight of an all too familiar back, broad shoulders covered in dark blue uniform and rubble, almost makes his heart stop.
“The fact that you look and sound so proud of this,” he pokes the ribbon, “is honestly making me question this relationship.”
“You should. She’s strong, and smart, and very opinionated. Leia’s a badass.”
“Where’re the proceeds going?”
“Open it,” Tony says, and Steve does, Tony can see the moment he realizes what’s inside, because he freezes so fast, it’s almost funny.
“Like...
“Whatever,” Tony waves his hand, “or one of those dolls with the smaller dolls inside! We can find the creepiest one, it’ll be awesome.”
“Sorry.”
“....No!”
“No you won’t,” Tony sing songs, and feels Steve smile into his hair.
“Tony,” she sighs, “I told you last time— the District hasn’t budged over on your proposal to ‘improve’ the school buses so that they look like
It’s not often that she stays over at the Tower these days, which is perhaps why she can’t help the yelp she gives when she’s wakes up the next morning to a pair of wide, curious green eyes inches from her face.
Tony sighs. “I don’t have food, or clothes, or toys. Or, whatever other shit kids need.”
"...Romantic ones?"
- - - - -
“You shouldn’t go repeating whatever Master Tony says,” he looks down at her. “He tends to have some... rather colorful opinions, after all.”
“Not a thing,” Steve says again. “How could I, when you’re in it?”
“But I’m right?” This time, the words are soft and low, earnest in a way only Steve can manage, and Tony feels his chest grow even warmer.
“That’s right, bunny. Yucky liver.”
on the ceiling?”
“Nope, no buts. I know how important this is to you, Tony.”
“Alright, Mr. Stark,” Sharon cuts in, patting Tony’s arm. “Good news is, it’s probably just a concussion--”
“Steve–” Tony starts, but the blond shakes his head, shoulders slumping as he sighs.
“Yeah, yeah,” Tony sighs, and opens the door to the apartment building. “But you can’t blame me for staring, babe. Your arms are a fucking wonder.”
Bucky rolls his eyes, but obeys. “Didn’t expect to see
JARVIS doesn’t answer, but the film starts playing immediately on the screen in front of them, and Steve makes a hum if approval as they settle in for the rest of the night.
“It’s not too early to back out.” The words are painful to say, but Steve meets Tony’s eyes and doesn’t look away.
“Oh, I’d definitely sneak one or two of those in there, too,” Steve laughs, wrapping his arms around Tony without hesitation.
Barnes is the first person he sees, knees pulled up to his chest as he sits on a chair of his own and stares at the room they’ve just left.
“Don’t you dare.”
He didn’t deserve any of it.
Jarvis just keeps running, and after that, Tony doesn’t know how much time he spends going after him. He tries hiding, crawling--
“Yes, sweetie?”
Steve steps further into the room. “Hi, babydoll,” he grins, and pepper’s kisses all over their daughter’s face when he lifts her into his arms. “Having tea time with Daddy?”
“No it’s not. Tony, look at me.”
“You say that every day,” he grins. “What’s the favor, then?”
“Virginia. Potts,” she replies. Her smile is friendly and professional all at once. “And don’t let him talk you into anything, either.”
“Nothin’ beats Christmas in New York City.”
“Oh, we will. But she didn’t make it easy– knocked three agents unconscious before we were able to take it from her.”
“And you decided to waste it by cuddling strangers?”
“Th-this one?” Bruce mumbles shyly, standing by the much sadder tree to their left.
“No, I didn’t plan this. Would’ve been a good idea, though, right? I’m not above doing something like that to keep you with me.”
“Did he give you his number?”
“Let it go.”
“Actually, I’m feeling a little pain, these ropes are pretty rough. Wanna play nurse?” he asks, wiggling his eyebrows suggestively, because even tied to a chair in an abandoned warehouse, Tony’s always had a fine eye for beauty, and she’s got it in spades.
, the smug bastard. But it’s worth it all just to see him groan in disappointment when Barnes hands the pile of the ‘when-will-Stark-and-Rogers-finally-bang’ pool money to Coulson.
“I’m going to take that as a compliment.”
Tony sighs. “I can handle it.”
“What’s up?” he asks, and this time, the words are softer and quieter, as peaceful as he feels every time he sees the two people he loves most in the world.
“...Tony?”
“I’ve been talking to Pepper more lately, SI business, and I don’t know, I guess I started remembering when we broke up. It doesn’t mean anything, we’re friends now, it’s all good– shit, Steve, I’m sorry.”
It takes him a couple of days to figure out how to tell Bucky, but eventually he just sits him down and does it.
Chunky Monkey.
“Then you’ll get better at it. Having something to take care of will teach you some responsibility.”
“I forgive you, Cap.”
He’s also smart and kind and dedicated— which yeah, all big pluses, of course— but the fact that he’s hot like burning just can’t be ignored.
“Ugh,” Natasha mumbles.
Steve chuckles into his chest, squares his shoulders, and looks him in the eye. “I, uh... I might have left them open all the time so Jarvis could get in, and then... Then, you’d have to come over.”
“Whose building is this?”
“A home. A family. Somethin’ worth fighting for-- worth
had?” Tony snaps. “It’s your fucking fault that we’re even in here!”
“Stevie–”
-   -   -
“It’s not you, Tony.”
“Steve–”
“Annoys me? No, sweetie,” the pet name falls from his lips without thought, and he tries to ignore the way Steve's blush makes him look so much more beautiful. “It annoyed me three years ago. Now, it's just...”
“After the stunt you both just pulled,” Tony grumbles, falling into one of the kitchen stools, “consider it payment for emotional trauma.”
Tony doesn’t say anything different, but the thought of the
“Does he?” Tony asks.
“Can I just ask, ‘cause I’m wondering: who’s idea was it to have you die in my arms?” The last words come out ragged, as weak and as broken as Tony feels right now. He knows the answer already-- he just wants to hear it out loud.
Steve’s already outside when Tony turns the street, and the sight of his best friend makes him drive just a little faster the rest of the way.
“We had t’do it b’cause--” Barnes hiccups, face pressed against a cell bar, and waves his hand in Rhodey’s direction. “
"Gonna go show my fella just how sweet I really am for him."
“Wait till I tell Miss Potts that.”
It’s somewhat of a frantic scramble as the room clears out almost immediately, and Tony’s sigh sounds much louder in the new silence.
,” Tony whispers, a faint, warm tendril of something unfurling in his chest even as his mind screams he’s lost it.
“I got you a present.”
“Yes?”
“I’m off at six.”
,” she says, smile growing to a grin, and Tony can’t stop looking at her. She’s younger than he can ever remember her being, but just as beautiful as ever. “And are you... are you happy, darling?”
“Can I kiss you?”
“Okay, I’m here,” Rhodey’s voice appears from somewhere over Steve’s shoulders, and moments later, he’s falling into step beside him. “They in the cafeteria?”
“God knows why,” Steve grumbles, and then yelps out a laugh when Tony elbows him in the chest. “I’m feelin’ a little less sorry about that snowball now.”
“I wike Macawoni,” Steve says softly, eyes growing wide and glassy as his bottom lip starts to wobble, and Tony fucking
"Is that what you were doing all the other times, too?" Pepper snickers.
“You’ll be fine, Tony,” the blond smiles, brushing Tony’s fingers with his own. “I’ll see you when you come back out.”
“Not the reaction I usually get,” he manages to get out, eyes brighter than any sky Tony’s ever seen.
“We will, Ms. Potts. I promise,” Steve nods, a friendly, earnest smile on his handsome face. Pepper almost swoons. “The last thing I wanna do is make more trouble for ya.”
hope you’ll believe me. You always like to give people the benefit of the doubt, right?” She moves her gaze above Tony’s shoulder, clearly directing the question at Steve.
“You know I do,” Steve replies, and relishes the warmth of Tony’s body as he leans back in to kiss Steve again. It’s slow and deep and utterly tender, Steve’s favorite kind, and he makes sure he pours as much love as he can into every second of it.
“Just… kiss me?”
“Jarvis, you getting this?” Clint chuckles.
“...Okay, maybe not. But she didn’t try to stop me, so, y’know, I figured I was good.”
- - - - - - - - - -
Steve lets out a watery laugh, and nods. “I
Tony rolls his eyes, and rests his cheek on the crown of Natasha’s head as he continues rocking her back and forth. “Sure you don’t, Cappuccino. Only it’s rubbing off on these guys and frankly, I haven’t been this nervous of ‘em in years,” he continues, even as he hugs Nat closer, humming a tune Steve doesn’t recognize.
Tony closes his eyes, and takes a moment to breathe and swallow the lump of emotion in his throat.
His heart picks up speed almost immediately, but Tony takes his time in lifting his eyes to meet Steve's, and Jesus, they’re wide and bright and so fucking blue that something inside Tony just comes loose, like he's breaking and coming back together all at once.
“Cats are pretty smart, Tony. And this one was raised by a genius--”
“I told you. Too late for take-backs, though!”
“Tony--” he starts, but the elevator comes to a stop with a gentle jolt, and Tony walks out with a look over his shoulder.
Civil Union Fest Prompt #14: “Have you lost your damn mind?!”
“I hate you,” Tony growls, wincing as he spots Sam jumping off the couch and onto one of the many beanbags scattered around the room. “I hate you so much right now.”
“Thought you’d enjoy ‘em.”
there.”
“Awww shucks,” Tony replies. “Guess I should go tell the team to hop back state-side, huh?”
It is
“How?”
“I’m going to find him.”
Steve’s shoulders rise and fall as he takes in a breath and releases it. “That sounds… painful.”
(See the end of the chapter for
There’s a loud, resigned sigh from inside Steve’s sleeping bag, and a second later, a blond, messy head peeks out to face him. “
“That’s what they all think,” Tony says, and he’s more than a little surprised when his voice comes out steady, and just a little bit lighter than before.
Tony fights the urge to smile, and instead crooks a finger at his pint-sized Captain. His shoulders are heaving from chasing Steve all throughout the floor, but he thinks it might be worth it for the utter joy on the little blond’s face. “Last warning, Cappy bear.”
But even if that was what Steve thought of him, the familiar lines of tension in Steve’s shoulders weren’t there. He didn’t appear particularly angry, just… resigned and weary. Everything about him looked worn, from the several days worth of stubble on his face, to his overlong, dyed brown hair, to his wrinkled hoodie and sweats. And somehow, despite all that, Steve looked

He steps closer, smiling bemusedly as he runs a thumb over ornament-Hulk’s frown and then cranes his neck, trying to see if there’s a little shield ornament, or even a little Captain America. It’d be embarrassing if there were but not necessarily in a
Tony groans. “That’s not funny the second time.”
“See, there you go!” Tony says, with a muted clap from his leather-clad hands. “Now, just use that serum’d up grace and—and you’re already on your ass.”
Cupcakes aren’t hard to figure out at all.
“No,” Steve says, just because he wants Tony to persuade him.
; Steve was a nation on his own, and so was Tony, two lonely men on their lonely islands, always at war except for just this once.
Tony doesn’t have enough shame left in him to be embarrassed, and instead just sits back on his haunches and waits. Steve’s lying on his back, arm across his eyes, and his mouth pinches closed as he stifles his giggling. He removes the arm and looks up at Tony. “Wait, you mean it?” he asks, still smiling. “That’s what you want?”
“There’s my Cap,” Tony grins, and tries to keep his heartbeat steady when Steve smiles back.
Steve just grins, and leans over the little fence to pick up a tiny white ball of fluff. "What about Annie, here?”
... Oh god, Tony," Steve whispers, and when it comes out as a sob, Tony just leans in and kisses him.
Not that he’d ever want to.
Steve looks down at their hands, and then back up with determined blue eyes. “Will you marry me?” he whispers.
“I really like the way you do a lot of things,” he says instead, and Tony’s smile turns wicked.
They leave the room with matching frowns, and when Pepper suddenly looks wary, Tony only waves her away with what he hopes is a reassuring smile. He knows he’s not in any danger but he also knows they really,
“You’re okay,” the blond sighs, and the relief in his voice makes Tony see red.
“Damn right it does,” Tony huffs, careful not to jostle the bundle in his arms too much. “You try being in charge for three hours,
“Slow down there, Shellhead,” Steve flicks Tony’s arm. “Get used to this one first, okay?”
“But I’m hungwy.”
Beside him, Steve lets out a deep, long breath. “If my Ma doesn’t make French toast, I’ll make ‘em for ya myself, alright?”
“For this,” Steve says. “For... everything. I had a wonderful Christmas.”
“I’m flattered you think so,” Steve chuckles around a grunt as he starts the slow climb up three floors. “But these arms can only hold somethin’ this big for so long.”
” Sam cackles from the couch, bumping the fist Barnes holds out to him.
“Don’t you wanna help?” Steve’s eyes are wide and blue, with a smile so hopeful, that Tony knows he’s already screwed.
“Guess I should buy another helmet then, huh?”
Tony feels a familiar warmth bloom in his chest. “If you stop molesting me, we might even get to do this
Tony nods.
“Santa!” Rhodey wails. His knuckles are pale from how hard he’s gripping the bars. “Sits’n a th-thro--”
Civil Union Fest Prompt #5: “I need a favor.”
“Cross my Star-Spangled Banner lovin’ heart, how about that?”
Maybe Tony wasn’t talking about him, Steve thinks the morning after.
“Not like it ain’t true.”
“Keep telling yourself that,” Rhodey sighs, patting Tony’s shoulder as he gets up. “I gotta meet up with Carol for the Chem project, ‘kay? I’ll meet up with you after school.”
Tony’s heart skips a beat, then another, and he reaches over to tap Pepper’s hand.
It was good to be home.
Steve takes a deep, readying breath, and starts walking toward him. “I... God, if that’s what I think it is, I might go crazy if you actually make me wait,” he laughs a little wetly, fingers fiddling in front of him as he gets closer and closer.
“The Captain wants to speak with you.”
“You betcha,” he says, and watches Tony’s lips quirk up into Steve’s favorite smile.
“You’re off to a good start then, gorgeous,” Tony winks.
“Can I ask you something?”
Steve nods, even though the glimmer of concern has yet to leave his eyes. “Sure I am. But let me go find someone to help you out, alright? Seein’ the two of you’s killin’ me.”
“I’m sure you’ll survive,” she replies. “Now keep signing.”
“Zip it, Shellhead.”
“Back atcha, Stark. And I know I’ve already thanked you for all this—”
Steve steps around Tony, and pulls him in to button the coat. “You’re enjoyin’ this, aren’t ya?”
“Old?”
“‘m tryin’ t’sleep, Tony,” Steve groans, arching away from him.
, Barton.)
Well, Tony just nods, letting the music take over the room once again. “Been a while since we’ve done this,” he says, some time later. His entire world feels reduced to the warm circle of Steve’s arms, and the comforting voice crooning out wishes of Merry Little Christmases.
Tony thinks he could look at it forever.
Pepper rolls her eyes fondly. “I did.”
“What happened to ‘winging it’?” Steve asks, tossing the coin like one would a baseball.
!” Really, Pepper should know better.
“Buck—“
- - - - -
“No chance of that, Stark. Just make it worth my while every night...”
“Sir–”
Tony pats him on the back in thanks. “I’ve got half a mind to make it long,” he says, “just to piss Howard off.”
“I dare you.”
“‘Kay.”
“Sorry doesn’t make up for the thirty-four hundred dollar recliner I’m gonna need replaced.”
“This is just–”
“Treat me to dinner, and you’ve got a deal.”
He does his run a little faster, partly because he’s feeling particularly energized, but definitely because he wants to be there when Tony wakes up.
“God, you’re really are crankier than the kids. I was hoping the pancakes would take care of that...”
“Hi,” he says, and his lips curve up into a smile before he can think to fight it. He can barely keep his eyes open, but Tony’s grin still takes his breath away.
“What–” he clears his throat, “what are you doing here? Is your head–”
-----------------------
“I love you too,” Steve breathes against Tony’s lips, then pulls back with a soft smile. “Happy?”
“If you say so, Cap.”
I'm interrupting your regularly scheduled programming to bring you MY DECEMBER CHRISTMAS PROMPTS! I'll be posting 'em all this month becausE CHRISTMAS! lmao things'll go back to normal in January, kay? :D Hope you like them!
“Oh baby, I like the sound of that,” Tony waggles his eyebrows, and feels a thrill of fondness when Steve’s cheek turn pink.
“I look…”
Tony has no idea what he’s going to tell Happy or Pepper— Christ, she’s probably halfway to crazy by now— but he thinks he won’t be too upset the next time he gets kidnapped.
“Hiya, Shellhead,” Steve slides into the space right next to him. He’s so close that their thighs and shoulders brush against each other, and goddamnit, those baby blues should be illegal.
Christmas morning, surprisingly, comes with the soft, low coos from the crib next to the bed. It’s loud enough to wake them both, but not in the loud, piercing way they’d been dreading.
,” Tony breathes. “Oh my god, Steve, I told you that was a fucking gag gift!”
“No, that’s not… we don’t need your money,” the blond says, shaking his head.
“Yep. But I know someone’s got a couple of kick ass presents from good ol’ Saint Nick.”
“Wait, but your meeting--”
“I will pay you to kill me.”
“Deal,” Tony says, reaching into his pocket to pull out his phone. “No take backs, Rogers,” he holds out his phone. “I expect to be wined and dined by the end of the week.”
“We have it in lab three,” Coulson says quietly. “Security clearance nine only.”
“You were worth every doubt I ever had-- that I wasn’t good enough, that I’d never be able do anything to make the world better. And you were worth every damn bit of pain I felt when the serum changed me. You were worth every moment of loneliness I’ve ever felt. God... you were worth every minute, every second, of those seventy years in the ice. And I’d do it all again, a thousand times. I’d do it in a heartbeat.”
If you say so.
“I... I wanted to get you somethin’ nice.”
(He doesn’t like to think of the times he can’t stay-- owning a company doesn’t get any less busy as time goes on, unfortunately-- because Steve’s eyes get big and sad, and then he tries to make Tony feel better, but his smile is thin and brief and
Steve lets out a sharp breath, and then he smiles.“Maybe you should,” he says, voice so soft and low.
“Yeah, I know. You’ve a got a coupl’a really neat ones down in your workshop.”
“I wanna hug!” Barnes yells from across the room.
“What?”
“Sounds perfect.”
if I’m going to keep up with you, don’t I?”
“Fucking hot,” Red finishes. Bucky chokes on air, and the Captain runs a hand through his hair. He’s still blushing and breathing hard, and Tony feels his pants getting tighter when he realizes he's the reason for it.
“Hmmm?”
“J-just like th-the p-plane… th’train… ‘M s’rry, Buck, ‘m sorry,” Steve whispers, a lone tear escaping the corner of his eye and falling down his cheek.
The bet,
Warnings: NONE.
Pepper rolls her eyes. “Funny, I haven’t seen anyone come around in a while.”
Steve rolls his eyes, but he’s still blushing– people are hearing this, damn it, he’s sure Sam and Bucky will be laughing their asses off when he gets home– and he’s still smiling. “I meant music, Mr. Stark.”
“I don’t know,” Tony whispers, and the words taste bitter in his mouth as his eyes, already tired and aching, start to burn again. “Fuck, I... what can I do, Steve? Tell me what to do.”
“See?” Tony grins. “I knew you could do it, gorgeous!”
“Don’t tell me the great Captain America ended up on his back.”
“Yeah?”
“Thought you might.... I dunno, maybe you’d like some company. I-- I brought you a blanket, but I can just-- I can leave it if, if you want--”
It’s like falling and flying, like breathing for the first time in his life, and nothing’s ever felt better.
“Like when we went for ice cream with Pep an’ Tony?”
Tony looks up from his textbook just in time to avoid slamming into a massive, baby blue chest, and he’s on the verge of a biting remark, annoyed at having his thought process interrupted, except he meets a pair of gorgeous blue eyes and--
“Zip it, mister.”
“Now who’s the sap?” Steve asks, laughing softly.
“You shouldn’t have to,” Steve points out, cursing the way his voice shakes ever so slightly. “And I… I wouldn’t blame you if– if you’re regretting… this.”
Warnings: NONE.
“To puppies? Not possible.”
“Steeb said we could op’n pwesents if we didn’ wake y’up,” Bucky says, eyes growing wide with glee. “Can we op’n pwesents now?”
“I hope they shoot you all.”
— is that whatever this is, it quickly grows out of the sticky notes. They start sitting together in the teacher’s lounge when their breaks coincide, sharing whatever lunch they brought with each other. They sneak in a sentence or two during Vice Principal Coulson’s weekly staff meetings, and who’d have thought Steve Rogers would be hiding all that dry wit under plaid and six-pack abs?
“That wasn’t very nice, darling,” she hears Tony say, seconds before he pops into her field of vision to scoop up the girl into his arms. “Come on, let’s get you some of Cap’s pancakes before the other gremlins gobble ‘em all up, yeah? You too, Pep. Up and at ‘em.”
“Barton, if we go with your choice, will you keep your trap shut?” Tony mumbles, and Steve flicks his back.
“Good. Because I’m going to make you
Sometimes, Steve thinks he lives to be surprised.
“Class is tomorrow, honey pie.”
“I know we’re not… not the most ideal people to get mixed up with. I’d feel bad about asking, but we got no one else to turn to. And it’d give us the chance to help keep you out of trouble.”
“I hungwy.”
“And you didn't send him back?”
“Shameless? Yeah, you’ll get used to it,” Tony says, and immediately wishes he could take them back because
“That’s good to know.”
” Rhodey runs up and shoves his remote control car in Tony’s face. “Look!”
---------------------------------------------------------
Tony burst into laughs..."captain hypocrite you blamed me for ultron when you saw that Wanda mind controlled me in creating ultron but bucky was mind controlled when he murdered my family still he is faultless. You let Wanda in who played with our fears even Hulk was trapped by her but You all still hate Loki and Me for same thing. I tried to convince you to deal with accords together but you left me bruised and damaged in an abandoned hydra base of Siberia. I always adored you but you smashed your shield on my heart...you say avengers are family...tell me Rogers what kind of family blames only one person for everything wrong with universe... I don't have any idea...so quit with your hypocrisy and let me live because being involved and trusting you guys again is worse than death for me. I am done with you all so let me live in peace and spare me. The guy who saw family in avengers died that day in Siberia...I am iron man and I only have eyes to do right with the world. I will stand with you professionally as your team member but do not expect anything anymore....I have nothing else to offer. With a gait in his walk and his masks back in place the iron man left the captain standing at his mercy...he was never going to look back again."
Steve remembered their shared conversations...the nights they argued playfully and how Tony taught him the beauty of future...Steve had got his past back but lost all his chances in future...that was first time he realised that iron man was not just his friend he meant more to him...he was the person Steve was thinking of a future with...he was in love with Tony but his decisions had lead him to a place  where he could never see Tony standing shoulder to shoulder fighting battles with him...to save one friend he had crushed the heart of other literally and metamorphically ...and he was the only one to blame...a relation had come to its end after crossing its limits and chances of reconciliation was none..
When he came back to compound he saw Steve and Bucky leaning against each other. All the avengers atleast asked how he was doing. He saw Bucky trying hard against Steve's hold to check on their other boyfriend but Steve was feeling over protective after in his words-
Since his childhood Tony admired Steve for his righteousness and stubborn attitude. He never knew that his idol who was supposed to be frozen in Antarctica would come back and destroy the only chance of family he had ever found.
Steve saw both his boyfriends cuddling together and came to join them but Tony with a nod to Bucky left the room for the final time.
Steve tried to ask Tony but he refused to talk to him about what he did wrong considering if even after all this Steve didn't realize what he had done wrong then Tony was even more stupid and mattered even less than he thought.
Road to recovery was long but nobody can understand Tony the way his Bruce can. Their friendship evolved over science and shared past experiences. Bruce told Tony about how he thought he will never become Banner again from Hulk and Tony told about his failed relationship, and civil war.
"If any of you wants to talk to me I am a busy man....I have millions of work pending so take an appointment. Whenever iron man is needed I will be following your commands as you are the leader of avengers. Here is your shield. Apart from avengers business I am not available to any of you."
When he was adopted by Howard stark and became the rightful owner of stark industries his own father considered him nothing more than his creation...and a creation that was supposed to stand up to the perfection that was one supersoldier the captain america himself.
There first mission was simple enough. All the avengers were to bring an Intel on alien technology and who was better suited than man of technology himself Iron man. While he was inside the base where those alien weapons were present he was vastly out numbered. He asked for help to both Steve, Bucky and all Avengers just to get no reply. His wits saved him sure but he got severely injured.
“You know it’s not,” Steve says. “There’s no one I’d rather do any of this with.” There’s nothing but honesty in those blue eyes, and Tony feels his grin tapering down to a soft quirk of his lips.
Warnings: NONE
“How are you?” Steve crouches down, and pats his friend’s knee. “How long’ve you been waiting? Why isn’t anyone treatin’ ya? What happened?”
“You’re lucky I’m the most stubborn son of a bitch you’ll ever meet, otherwise we’d never get anywhere. Now
Tony smiles up at the wrangled piece of metal above him before sliding out, and then--
“Then you better get in there and get some answers,” Coulson jerks his head at the window, just as the door to the other room opens and Agent Melinda May steps in.
Steve shudders. He looks like he might cry. “Obviously,” he says. “Put your hand on me.
“Well, I just never—”
Tony pushed in maybe an inch before Steve let out a hiss of pain—and what the fuck was that about? Steve barely felt pain, and he hardly ever acknowledged it. Last time he’d let Tony fuck him dry.
If he tore him up, no doubt Steve would make some joke about
Tony’s got his arms crossed, and his index finger is tapping impatiently against his arm. He looks—unsure. “Look, if you want to keep up the hermit lifestyle, that’s fine, but—”
They go to McDonald’s.
“Look at me,” he told him, taking a clanking step towards him. Steve stiffened but didn’t comply. Tony extended a gauntlet-clad hand and grabbed him by the arm, spinning him around. “Look at me when I fucking
“You trust me with your life but you won’t trust me with this?”
“I feel a little silly,” Steve admits.
“Tony,” Steve says, the name falling from his mouth like a led weight. “Tony, I’m so sorry.”
“There could be an infinite number of universes out there,” Bruce muses with a faint smile, “and I bet in every single one you’re covered in tentacle slime.”
Tony yanks off their remaining clothes, leaving them in a heap at the foot of the bed. He’s got his knees on either side of Steve’s hips but he’s not touching him, and Steve’s humping into the air, moving his hips up and down, grinding his ass onto the bed. Tony bets his asshole
Fuck. There was definitely something wrong with Steve but was also something clearly wrong with
Tony’s tapping his foot, fidgeting. “…I will admit Pepper doesn’t find it as offensive as I do.”
And Steve sends himself out into the world to go find Bucky.
Steve leaned in close, lapped at the blood on Tony’s mouth. “I think you said something about not trusting a man without a dark side?” he panted.
Tony had so many questions he wanted to ask: how he broke the others out of the Raft, where they all were, where Barnes was, why was he out here alone, but for the time being he was content to let their bodies do the talking, kissing up and down Steve’s neck as Steve tangled his fingers in Tony’s hair. He brushed Tony’s hair like a cat’s and gently scratched at his scalp, so affectionate that Tony was sure Steve was imagining he was with someone else, someone like—like
“Captain,” Tony says, snapping his fingers in front of his face and goddamn that’s rude. Such an asshole. Such an endearing, stupid asshole. “You zoned out there.”
He wrenched Steve’s sweatpants down below his hips and began unbuckling his own jeans, mouth still latched on Steve’s throat. He knew the flare of anger in his gut wasn’t rational and he therefore couldn’t act on it. He had to be gentle because they’d both
want!” Steve interrupted, trying to sit up and maybe trying to stop Tony from moving away.
“Guess that’s our cue, huh?” Steve asks. Tony tells himself that can’t be disappointment he hears in those five little words.
Because as much as he likes pretending to be annoyed, he actually thinks it’s adorable how fixated Tony is on his morning coffee. He’s the most un-morning person Steve has ever known, and no matter how much Steve coaxes him into interacting with the rest of the team over the breakfast table-- or at least acknowledging their existence-- he has yet to witness Tony breathe a word to anyone before downing one or two large mugs of scalding coffee.
Steve stands up, holding the little black box in between his suddenly trembling fingers, and takes a step towards Tony, ignoring the pang of fear when Tony steps back a second later. “Why’d you think?”
“Like always,” Tony rolls his eyes fondly.
“You’re so easy, Rogers,” Tony laughs, but leans up smack a kiss on the blond’s cheek.
“That was the idea,” Steve says, biting his lip as he fiddles with his fingers. He’s so adorable, it’s almost too much.
Barnes shrugs. “Fair enough. Now go get your man– and actually, forget the cleaning up part. I bet my arm he’s got half a mind to come down and break those doors with his shield if he doesn’t see you in the next five minutes.”
Steve’s been half-hard from the moment he saw him, and everything else about the man sure as hell isn’t helping him– dark, tousled locks Steve’s hands are itching to touch, and his smile…
“Rogers...”
“I’m not lookin’ at ya any way, mister Stark,” Steve replies, that delicious Brooklyn drawl carrying across the room until Tony can all but feel it running down his spine like a gentle kiss.
Tony tries to keep his smile from turning giddy. “Need some help there?”
Sure didn’t look like you thought it was boring last week.
Steve just rolls his eyes and walks over to place a soft kiss to the girl’s forehead. “Thank you, princess,” he says softly, before turning to Tony with eyes bright and vibrant with unconcealed gratitude. “Shellhead...”
“Why?”
Steve's Iron Man apron: www.stupid.com/assets/images/iron_man_1.jpg
“Thank God for that.”
Tony nods, even though no one’s around to see him. “Yeah.”
“Come on, mister,” Steve whispers. “I’ll tell you mine.”
“Jealous? Of what?”
Tony clears his throat. “This... this is going to sound fucking insane, okay, but I’m gonna need you to hear me out.”
”Tony--”
“I know you did, big guy…”
“‘s so
“Behave, Shellhead. Just sit tight and enjoy the view,” Steve laughs, and with his family settled around him, Tony finds it easy to do so, closing his eyes against the surprisingly gentle winter breeze.
“You already have me.” The words are out before Steve can stop them, and when Tony’s face turns the prettiest shade of pink, Steve revels in the warmth of being
“What?”
“I'm countin’ on it, Stark.”
“Most of the time,” he says pointedly.
"Here ya go,” he says, heart lurching against his chest when Steve’s eyes drop to his lips as he bites his own.
“The, uh… the walls are sort of thin? And I’d never eavesdrop, but it’s pretty easy to hear you two talking all the time.”
“Tasha!” He gasps, making grabby hands at her. “
“Yeah!” their daughter claps happily, bouncing in her seat. “You ‘n me ‘n Papa!”
,” Clint says slowly, and Steve manages to tamp down the smile threatening to break out.
The first time Tony says ‘I love you’, it just slips out.
In the loud chaos of the Stark Tower living room, Tony feels Steve’s voice brush softly against his skin as the blond whispers in his ear. He ignores Rhodey’s knowing smirk, and puts his champagne glass down as he turns to face the Captain.
“This party was
“It’s not the first time, alright?” Tony answers. “And it won’t be the last, either.”
“Want coffee,” Tony mumbles, and Pepper can’t hold back the laugh when he nuzzles Steve’s chest again.
“Mission accomplished,” Steve announces, giving him a thumbs up.
,” Tony whines, pressing himself further into Steve as he maneuvers the bed covers over the two of them. “Mhmm… that’s better, right?” he whispers into the blond’s neck, and smiles when Steve’s warmth surrounds him.
“You betcha, stud muffin. Honestly, I don’t know if I’ll leave enough for you.”
, and have them at the tower by the hour.”
“Promise me?” Tony blurts, clutching at the cushions, at his best friend, at anything that will keep him from falling down and falling apart.
“Not one bit, seeing as how I love you too,” Tony smiles, breathing around the warmth in his chest as Steve returns it with another one of his own. A particularly chilly burst of wind makes him shiver a second later, however, and Tony pulls away with a sigh. “By the way, you’re absolutely coming with me next time I pay Parker a visit,
“You’re insane, kid!” He finds himself laughing.
You almost didn’t. Lucky for you, stubborn is my middle name, even if Cap drives a hard bargain.
” Steve’s voice is firm and serious, enough to calm Tony’s nerve considerably.
“The store’s not pressing charges-- they were gonna get rid of the chair anyway. But, um, you understand we can’t let this kind of behavior go unpunished.”
“Tony.”
Tony somehow manages to control the urge to start screaming about how she got her hands on a suit like his, and instead takes the chair at the other end of the table. “I’d ask how you know who we are,” he says, “but since you stole my suit–”
Tony lifts his arm to touch his face, but only gets halfway before his muscles just give up. “’s alright,” he mumbles, and Steve still looks so heartbroken, it makes Tony giddy. “’f this’s wut I wake’p to, y’can hit me’ll th’times y’want.”
Steve, thankfully, immediately holds out the bag furthest from him, and quickly sets the others down to help Tony pour the milk on the bowls.
] Thanks, big guy! Your turn.
He’s usually one of the first to wake up, and every time Tony stumbles into the kitchen later in the mornings, the sight of his Captain smiling by the counter never fails to put a smile on his face.
“Wasn’t plannin’ on it,” Steve mumbles. “I’ve missed ya too much.”
They smell like
“I’m trying to get into the school spirit a little more, okay?” Tony tries to pull away, but Steve’s hold slips down to his waist, and he gives up with a huff.
“Depends on whether you share whatever you’ve got there,” Tony tells him, even as pulls back the covers in invitation. “Pass it over, big guy.”
“I thought it’d be funny,” Steve says. “It was. Mostly.”
“Isn’t an afternoon with me enough?”
“Everything’s... better now. It gets shitty sometimes, but-- it’s good.”
“I knew it,” she grins. “The second I saw him, I knew you’d be a goner.”
"And I said no."
He’s on his feet and walking towards the group before he even realizes what he’s doing, and the sound of Rhodey calling out his name is barely registering because right now his mind is all golden hair and sunshine and
“Um... hi?”
They look almost like… torch burns.
Then he looks back up, and stops.
, Tony thinks.
It’s disconcerting. And a little refreshing.
"Yeah."
of leaving,” he whispers, but lets himself be pulled from the chair and out the door.
“I feel like you’re hiding,” Steve finally says. “I get that you’re probably angry–”
“At least we’re better off than the other guy,” Tony says, grinning when the other man laughs and nods.
An inch or two closer to Steve.
“They’re cute,” Steve mumbles, just as the entire room erupts in laughter at the sight of half a dozen Avengers ornaments tumbling to the floor as Barnes tips the bag over.
Tony nods. There’s no room for being a coward tonight. “Stay? Just f-for...”
Prompt: “that fic with steve and the rest of the avengers comforting tony MADE MY HEART BURST WITH TEARS AND JOYY can we pleaseee have a sequel where the avengers go to fuck all the bullies up (steve and rhodey are first in line but the rest of them aren't far behind) and maybe even stevetony love confessions?”
“Didn’t have any,” Blondie replies. “And the art center’s closed for renovations, so I had a free day.”
“Tony!”
“Yeah?”
“It’s not that cold,” Steve laughs. but stretches out beside Tony to pull him into his arms.
“We’re still on the floor, Steve.”
Though not just by Tony, apparently.
“I can see why you’d think so,” the woman shrugs, “but that suit is mine. I swear.”
And so incredibly hot
“This shit doesn’t even shine,” Barnes sniffs in offense, holding up his gray-armed Winter Soldier. “I guess it’s okay, though...”
“Look, asshole. If you’re just here to mess with us--”
Rhodey groans into his hands, but Pepper just smiles. "It’s been obvious the whole time.”
All the air leaves Steve’s lungs, and he pulls back to meet burning brown eyes. “What are you saying…”
“They better. And leave the light on for me when I get back.”
"A kiss."
“Oh, fuck that,” Tony says, plopping down leisurely on the bed. “If you think I’m leaving you today--”
“Oh shit, you’re hot.” Bright blue eyes widen in surprise, and Tony feels a shiver of delicious pleasure run through him when they not so discreetly check him out. “I said that out loud, didn’t I?”
,” Steve breathes back. “So damn much.”
- - - - -
“I could buy all the fucking tree companies–”
“Tony.”
“Tony?”
“You can’t know that,” Tony shakes his head, almost cursing when a lone tear falls down his cheek and lands on his pillow because he suddenly wants so much, wants it more than he’s ever wanted anything in his life.
“Don’t you dare throw that snowba--
“Same fucking thing. Point is, you opened it. Wanna tell me why?”
Steve looks up at him through his eyelashes. “Always.”
“Not even–”
get out of it, then? Tit for tat, you said.”
“It’s Pepper to you. Always,” she replies, the words unplanned but not any less true for it. “And a very happy birthday, too.”
"You debrief?”
“Sleepin’,” Sam shrugs. “I hungwy.”
“Oh god, please don’t say anything,” Steve pleads. “Buck, I–”
“Tony–”
“Why not? I thought we were wingin’ this thing, Rogers!”
“There any bad news?” Tony jokes. “W’ll I ever walk ‘gain, Doc--”
“Merry Christmas,” Steve replies, and leans back in to press their lips together.
Steve laughs as he pulls away. “Now lemme go whip up another batch-- Nat’s gonna kill us if we don’t have anything ready.”
“I went and got an idiot for a best friend,” he laughs, wetly and more than a little breathless as he finally meets Tony’s warm, brown eyes.
“Wow, what are you, a hundred and one, or just one?”
“Do you trust me?”
“Why?”
“Sure you will, sunshine,” Tony grins, and Steve rolls his eyes at the nickname even as his cheeks turn the most delicious shade of pink. “Just give the ol’ cafeteria crones that smile, and they’ll be putty in your hands.”
“Nothing that matters, that’s what.”
Steve smiles again, nods, and tucks his head under Tony’s neck. “‘Kay.”
” Steve’s voice is tinny through the tablet speaker, but his amusement is obvious. “
“This is Sam and Bucky.”
Clint sticks out his tongue, but continues. “My little birds got me some names: Hammer, Rumlow, and Stone.”
“If you tell me you used to sing it in front of the mirror after you showered, I’m gonna fucking lose it!”
“Gentlemen,” Coulson says calmly.
“No, because it is. You’re--” he waves his hand helplessly, “-- hey, you’re still, y’know. You.”
A wedding night is only for two, after all.
“Keep it up, old man. I’ll stick this cover in a frame and hang it up.
“What do they do?”
Tony nods urgently. “He’s a softie, underneath all that scruff. I can tell.”
“‘s because you’re too short to reach all those really high shelves everywhere,” Steve replies, and then yelps out a laugh when Tony smacks him on his shoulder.
(He knows Howard rarely goes into his room, and never to snoop through his things, so it’s a safe enough place for now.)
“Worth it, though, if it gets you to smile like that,” Steve says, voice as soft as the gleam of awe in his eyes, and Tony feels his whole face grow warm.
Warnings: NONE.
“‘Course you did,” he replies into the blond’s shoulder. “I was a total shoo-in, y’know.”
] It’s boring.
“What?” he has to ask again, just to make sure.
Oooh, y’hear that, Rogers?
His? Blue.
“She’s going to kill us,” he whispers to Steve. “And it’s all your fault.”
and god, Tony’s so fucked.
“Better let me go, then,” Tony taps Steve’s hand, and climbs off him with another wink. “And don’t look at me like that!”
“Yes, sir,” he smiles.
He breaths once, twice, and then nods, but in the end, she has to pry his hands open so they can take Steve away.
“Oh my fucking god,” Clint comes in, rolling his eyes as he settles into his bean bag. “Spare us the foreplay, please.”
Tony sits up so fast, he almost gets vertigo. “...Can I go to the restroom?”
” he mimics, and the exaggerated pitch of his voice prompts a laugh out of Tony even as he rolls his eyes.
“More than you know,” Tony whispers, low enough that it doesn’t break the silence that settles around them once more.
Warnings: EXTREME FLUFF! ;)
“Sure.”
“Lost your train of thought, there?” Tony teases, and just like that, Steve’s mind clears up a little. He’s Captain America, the man with the plan, damn it.
“I’m gonna make this quick because I want to get back to this
- - - - -
“I was hoping Barton’d have to eat his arrows after all.”
“And I’m telling you now: I want to do all sorts of things for, with, and to that ass.”
“You won’t.”
“Babydoll, maybe you wanna come lie down next to me?” Steve asks her, mindful of Tony’s lungs, and the nasty cough he can hear rattling them.
"Sleep," he says, settling the bed sheet neatly over the blond.
“You’re welcome,” Steve says softly, cursing the blush that settles on his cheeks.
He needs to either stop this, or move things forward.
“Sees what?” All heads turn to the door as Steve walks inside, perfectly uniformed and composed, and every inch their Captain.
“Tony--”
“Yeah,” is all Steve can say, feeling oddly out of breath even though he’s barely moved, and he wills his hands not to shake as they clean up the small puddle in front of him.
Pepper and Happy were engaged now and Tony had given pepper few weeks vaccation for planning their wedding and he himself took over the R & D department of SI. When Bruce and Thor returned after events of Ragnarok talking about the threat of Thanos Tony smiled after long time seeing his science buddy. Like always Bruce supported Tony in his all mad/science/ let's do it Brucie Bear things.
Tony was taken aback by this question. In all the time they spent together Tony really had acquired feelings for both soldiers. And thus they decided to give their relation a chance. It was few months later when Tony realized that this was a mistake on his part. Tony had actually fallen for both super soldiers , what with goodness of Steve's heart and hope present in James's eyes of a future life ahead and together. He wanted to tell them about his feelings but it was evident that out of both soldiers only James Barnes considered Tony an equal partner. Bucky was thankful to Tony that he accepted him with all his faults but same was not the case with Steve Rogers. Tony felt as important person , a priority in the life of James Barnes but with Steve it was a lost battle.
"Rogers for you and your team I have done arrangements and since you all are under strict surveillance I demand the rent of this place for you all and your food will be charged by your active duty account."
Tony's mouth involuntary uttered the words, "so was I." But then he  thought that maybe only Tony considered Steve as his friend...his idol never returned the sentiments. Tears escaped the corner of his eyes ..due to threat of Thanos the team was back on duty and today they were returning to compound.
The same steve who ridiculed him for hiding the secret about ultron which was not just his brain child but also Wanda's magic...and the same captain who had hidden the secret of Tony's mother and father's death throughout these years they were pretending to be family...family is supposed to have your back...not like the avengers who never tried to understand Tony stark the genius, billionaire,  playboy , philanthropist who was man having everything but nothing... Who tried to repent for all his mistakes and bring positive change in the world just to be betrayed by his own people. Tony had lost the faith on people but his iron will to do good for the people was still intact...he had resigned from active duty from avengers and concentrating on technology marvels.
“Well, that probably should not make me as happy as it does,” she replies with a smile, “but you’ll understand if I don’t feel particularly sorry about that.”
“I don’t... have a present. For you.” The last part is whispered into Steve’s shirt, and he frowns when Tony tenses in his arms and looks away.
fight with Doom that I wasn't around for."
Steve breathes out a laugh, but wraps his arms around the brunet. It pushes them even closer together, and Tony lets out a soft groan, grinding his hips slightly against Steve’s. “Go for it,” Steve says.
“I don’t,” Big, Blond and Beautiful chuckles bashfully, hands fidgeting with a champagne glass of his own. “But this… this is more than I could’ve imagined. It’s an honor, Mr. Stark,” he finishes, holding out his free hand.
] It’s me.
“My hero.”
“So… if there’s even the smallest fucking chance I get any of that with you, you bet your sweet ass I’m gonna fight for it. Cuz you’re stuck with me, hon. And uh… maybe I can get stuck with you, too.”
Steve shakes his head. “Not too much,” he answers, and then gives them all a sheepish smile. “Coulson and Hill brought out some celebratory lunch, and I felt bad about declinin’. How ‘bout you?”
“I love you.”
” Tony asks, and Steve stops to take a deep breath.
Steve beams, and scoots just a little bit closer. “My Ma used to tell me that the one thing she prayed for the most, every night before she went to bed, was that I’d be happy. That I’d find something I loved to do, and find someone I’d be proud to love and be loved by. And it’s been… well, God knows it hasn’t been an easy road, but it’s been worth it, for what I have now.”
Steve rolls his eyes. “Yes, but you know you can’t make her do anything. She’s a stubborn one.”
Tony blinks. “Not this! You could’ve been
Well, I think I’ve got time for one last thing, and then I can snap a shot or two, right?
“Stop talking.”
“No you’re not.”
“Then stop wasting time, and tell me why we’re here. Not that I’m complaining. I’m all for losing a few hours with you.”
Tony sighs. “You had macaroni yesterday.”
“Keep talking, stud; see if I
Tony rolls his eyes but nods, and then breathes around a pathetic, lovesick sigh as Steve leans over to brush a kiss on his forehead. “I’ll be back,” he hears the blond whisper.
Warnings: NONE.
“Did you mean it?” Steve blurts out, and he’s suddenly
“And he’s always good for keeping the nightmares away... You couldn’t ask for a better guy.”
“Hiya, Cap,” he finally says, and thinks it must be a trick of the light, the way Steve’s eyes seem to turn just the slightest bit darker.
Steve takes a deep breath, and squares those broad, beautifully painted shoulders. “Okay,” he finally says. “I’m ready.”
"Yep.”
“—or Steve.”
A blond eyebrow peeks out from behind those shades. “How’re ya gonna get to school, then?”
"Who, Buck?"
“I swear it was an accident,” Steve shrugs, and laughs as his Mario speeds past Tony’s Yoshi and through the finish line.
Sequel to Chapter 52!
“Only f’short people!” The girl giggles, wriggling down from Steve’s hold to move a chair with a Captain America plushie to the side. “Y’can sit on th’floor, Papa.”
Steve, the bastard, just sits across from him, and holds out the Spaghetti plate. “Take however much ya want.”
Tony looks up and nods. “Have fun,” he says, smiling as Rhodey leaves with one last wave. It’s only after he’s lost sight of his best friend that he lets out a curse and runs a hand through his hair.
“Tony.”
Steve’s flush deepens, and Tony forgets all about the fleeting brushes of remembrance he’d felt just minutes ago.
He has no idea how long they stay that way, chest to chest, but eventually they pull away for air with one last, quick peck, and when he rests his head on Steve’s shoulder, he can feel it heaving beneath him. “God... It’s so goddamn unfair,” he gasps, “that your lips are always so fucking
Steve just nods because it’s too late to say no, and after both kids are inside, Tony turns to him and smiles.
“I can’t believe you did it.”
anything else. He has yet to know what her warm weight would feel like in his arms, has yet to know how soft her little blond hair would feel like against his rough, callused hands. It’s only when she’s like this, still and silent to the world, that he dares to do nothing else but look at her.
“Can’t even fill a table. Mom--” Tony clears his throat, and Steve feels the sudden pinprick of tears at the faint echo of pain he can hear. “Mom said she’d try to make it, but... I wouldn’t bet on that.”
“No, sorry, of course he’s not. Sorry.”
“It’s
“Jealous, Barnes?”
“Tony--”
“I don’t give a damn,” Tony snaps, but Sarah doesn’t even blink. “I’m the one who asked him--”
“Pretty much the only things I know how to make,” Steve says, rubbing the back of his neck bashfully. “It’s, um, Spaghetti. And I also made chicken, if you-- if you want that, too. I know it’s... it’s not much, but--”
But then, slowly, the light on his chest breaks through the chaos, soft and bright and cool, everything those three months weren’t, and with a deep, ragged breath, Tony’s mind catches up to his body.
Steve thanks each of their friends for their gifts, and then he gets to Tony’s and unsticks the tape piece by piece. Clint boos from the couch, but Tony tells him to just hurry on with it, and Steve furrows his brow when he sees the sketchbook.
here, mister…”
“I helped when I got back, didn’t I?”
“Hey, there,” he whispers, tucking her into his chest without hesitation when she nuzzles into his bicep. “You done with your card?”
“Tony--” Pepper starts.
“Wow, calm down,” he laughs, and keeps walking. “Now, what kinda shit do dogs need… Oooooh, I like that– what is that, is that a bed? Get that bed, Jim Jam, I can’t reach.”
Warnings: NONE.
“I caught the time on Agent Ward’s wristwatch just before I took him down,” she smirks. “And then I looked at yours a couple of minutes ago. That’s the one you gave him, isn’t it, Dad?”
“Did you...” Steve smiles shyly, and looks at Tony from beneath his eyelashes even though he’s, like, half a foot taller. “Does that mean you heard everything you just thought about me in my voice?”
“Yeah,” Bucky gasps, eyes wide and bright as he jumps delightedly, “Choc’ chip cookies!”
The final bell goes off before anyone can say anything else, and Steve says his goodbyes as both children run inside, and then he’s alone in the waning crowd with the old man. “Steve Rogers, nice to meet you,” he says, sticking out his hand again.
Steve does. “P-please d-don’ leav-ve m-me,” he whimpers, eyes glassy and wet, and Tony feels his heart break. “P-pleas-se, Tony, please–”
“It could be worse.”
. God, I feel like a fucking teenager,” he says. “I can’t... I can’t go up to him and just ask, Pepper.” His heart skips a beat at the thought.
“You don’t need it— you’re Tony fucking Stark. Go get your man.”
“Not sure I could,” the blond says, looking up at him through long, blond eyelashes, and Tony’s heart skips a traitorous beat. “Steve Rogers, at your service,” the man holds out his hand.
“Zip it, Buck,” Steve says, rolling his eyes when Barnes stumbles over to him as soon as the cell door is opened. “If Ma could see you now--”
"What is it, Tony?"
“Sure I will, Petey pie,” he says. “But only for a little while, okay?”
“Because you’re...” Tony waves his hand around lazily. “Distracting.”
“I’m kind of having a hard time focusing on anything else right now.”
“It’s not easy sometimes, but... you make it better,” Steve says, so quiet, Tony can barely hear him.
“If you stay in here one more day, James is going to come and drag you out of here himself.”
“Um,” Tony licks his lips, forcing the air back into his lungs. “Dog.”
“I’ll pay you to hand ‘em over.”
“Not more than me.”
Which he’s not going to think about right now, because he’s been kidnapped.
“Me?”
“Go on, then,” he says. “Out with it.”

There’s a loud clang from underneath the car Tony’s buried in, and she hears him let out a muffle curse a second later.
“What, they never get to do that– hey, no, don’t go, Cappy bear!” Tony whines, when he feels Steve start to pull away from where he’s all but splayed out on top of him. They’re the only two on the couch, and even with the rest of the team scattered around the room as they settle in for their weekly movie night, Tony only has eyes for the soothing weight above him.
“Believe me,” the blond shakes his head. “I’m really not. I’m just–
“Aren’t you gonna show all your friends?”
“Y-yeah,” he gasps, nodding his head maybe too enthusiastically, but everything is suddenly hotter and heavier and more. It feels fantastic.
“Wan’ more tea?”
Pepper smiles. “I know.”
Steve’s laughter is slightly raspy, but after a full day of bed rest, it sounds considerably healthier than before. “Tryin’ to keep me sick, Mister Stark?”
