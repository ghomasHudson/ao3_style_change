“N-Y-M-A,” Peter spelled out, his mouth half-full of cereal. He chewed and swallowed before continuing. “New York Military Academy. S’where James went.” Tony stared at him blankly. None of this meant much to him.

“You play any sports?” Tony asked, lifting up his welding mask and shouting over the impossibly loud music.
“We could have gone and done something else for the day,” Dad said. “I don’t think Peter’s having a blast either.”
“So, find the Red Skull, find the space stone,” James interjected from where he sat, sandwiched between Azari and Torrun. “No chance we have any leads on where he’s holed up?”
“Soon, yes,” Dad agreed. “We’ve been getting reports from all over about strange incidents just like this. The 50 State Initiative seems to be handling things elsewhere, and there are plenty of countries out there with their own hero teams, but I think we’re going to get stretched thin here at the epicenter of it all. But first. If we’re going to be working together, then we need to trust each other. Completely.” He took a deep breath, and let it out before speaking again. “With James’ permission, I’d like to tell you all what
Their lips might have both been cold, but that did nothing to stop the searing heat of the kiss. It was more than just a kiss—it was a revelation, and a celebration, and just as they broke apart for air, an impossibly loud cheer went up from inside.
“Uh, actually we might not be, Steve,” other Tony—who was, as were all of the Tonys Tony had met so far, a guy—looked down at his piece of equipment which looked not unlike a smartphone. He looked up at those of 3490 staring at them with a charming smile, which Tony knew meant he was nervous. “Seems we’re having an issue with the juice—he’s already moved on to 7458, but we can’t get to the next grid point just yet…our device has to recharge first.”
. Sorry, Cap. Look, I shouldn’t make fun of the shit you’ve gone through. What did you want to talk about anyway?”
“Hello, this is Nurse Maria Collins from St. Vincent’s Hospital. Am I speaking to Mrs. Bishop, please?”
“Nooo,” Peter replied. “But it’ll get done—sonofabitch! You passed me! How the hell did you pass me? You were like three miles behind me!”
“That’s fifty times better than cold cereal,” Peter said with a grin. He put down his spoon and jumped off the chair before hurrying off down another hallway that Tony knew was the quickest way to the upstairs. He was a quick kid, which made sense considering he seemed to be all leg.
snafu. This was a giant, gaping snafu, and none of the alternate avengers were going to be happy about it. She knew she wouldn’t be, were their situations reversed—hell, she wasn’t particularly happy about it in her
for the past week. She hadn’t been able to quite put her finger on it, but she hadn’t felt exactly herself. At first, she thought that the stress of being Director was finally getting to her, or that Peter’s new powers or Kate’s problems were finally driving her over the edge—but that really wasn’t it. It was more of a
“Whatever. We’ll catch you up eventually. Do you at least know the first rule of helping somebody else?” Kate asked.
“Hang on,” Tony said, swiveling on Steve, “I’m buzzed so I’m not surprised this didn’t occur to me earlier—but
“It’s why I moved here permanently from Malibu. This view. When you look out, it’s like you’re flying, don’t you think?” Steve looked out over the skyline. Tiny people dotted the sidewalks, and little pinpricks of lights from streetlamps and cell phones were so far away they were almost like stars set against the inky black of the pavement.
When Kate was seven, she remembered her dad got grievously injured. He got injured all the time, but this was the first time Kate could really remember that he had needed to stay in the hospital overnight. He’d been very badly burned, all over his back. He had been laid up in a hospital bed , stomach down, bandaging all over his body. Mom had held her and Peter’s hands and taken them in to visit. It wasn’t for her or Peter’s sake, Kate didn’t think, looking back on it. Her dad had been back (mostly) to normal just a couple of days later. They could have easily been kept at home and just told that ‘daddy is resting’ or something. No, Kate was pretty sure, thinking back on it and recalling how her dad’s face had lit up like a Christmas tree when Kate and Peter ran into the room, her mom had done it for her dad. He’d been hurt terribly and was stuck in a hospital bed—for her dad, Kate knew, there wasn’t anything that would cheer him up more than his family.
“I’ve got a strict no ditching family rule,” Dad said, amused. He turned back to James. “Did you want to leave and do something else? This is our day with you James, we don’t get those often. We want to do something you want to do, right guys?”
to yelling at you and telling you to sleep in your own bed like we’d been begging you to for weeks. But you snuggled up next to me, sniffling, and I knew that would only make everything worse. It would make me no better than—well. My father wasn’t a model parent as you know. And if I just ignored your problem and told you to get over it, it would only make everything a thousand times worse. You really
“Crisis averted,” Tony said as he picked the shield back up and tossed it across the park to Steve’s waiting hand. “Back to the rest of the crises!”
“Thanks, Cap,” Tony said sincerely, feeling his heart lighten a bit at his speech, but he still felt clouded in grief. “It’s stupid but I feel like—I feel like my sister died or something. Or that I did. Or—it’s just an odd feeling to have.”
James was speechless. He had no idea what to say. He was used to Tony making grand gestures, used to her inventing some crazy new piece of tech solely for the amusement of her children, used to her kind eccentricities—but this was something different all together. Tony’s face fell at his silence.
Tony agreed, getting up from his chair as well. He looked drained. He looked freaked out. Steve put a hand on his shoulder.
“All right. Azari, Torrun, Billy, Teddy, Francis, Tommy—go play a board game or something,” Dad said. “Please.” Wordlessly they left, though Peter could tell that Billy and Tommy in particular were itching with curiosity. Peter figured Billy would devise a way for them all to listen in anyway. As soon as they were gone, Dad looked at each of them all in turn.
“You two were ridiculously stubborn about it,” Tony said. She could not keep the smile from her face, nor did she want to. “Your father and I were at a loss as to what to do about it. You couldn’t share the same room forever, but how could we keep you from it if you didn’t want to stay in your separate rooms short of locking the doors?”
is the right word,” he said. “Come take a look.” Tony moved forward, joining Bruce behind his desk and looking at the screen he had pulled up. It was filled with results and variables, complex equations that, as much as Tony was loathe to admit it, Reed Richards would have an easier time comprehending. This was not her field of expertise.
training program for powered kids that Xavier wouldn’t take so that Stamford would never happen again. So they bought this old school and turned it into the Academy. They took in powered kids and set them up with rooms in the boardinghouse, and they trained us all together. But thing of it is—a lot of these kids were criminals. They don’t have the best records, or the best home lives, unfortunately. A lot of them have…pretty gray morality. Not all of them, of course, but…they’re not ideal Avengers, even if they’re trained to be efficient.”
“You’ve been so brave, dealing with them,” Tony said. “I’m really proud of you, James. Your father is, too. Incredibly proud.” James felt his gut twist.
“Chill,” she said. “There was no overstepping of bounds.” She finished tightening a screw and then looked back up at him. He felt frozen, unsure of whether or not to just go. “You know if this were your permanent universe I would just tell you to get out more and go date people. Actually that’s not true. If this were your permanent universe, I would tell Clint to take you to a strip club and then out clubbing and systematically desensitize you to the twenty-first century so you might be encouraged to start dating or even just engage in some casual hook ups to get your mind off things. Sadly, this is not your permanent universe and knowing your luck, you’d fall madly in love with some woman here and then get dramatically ripped away and for some reason be unable to return on pain of the collapse of the multiverse or something.” She sighed deeply. There was pain in her eyes. “I can’t help you, Steve. And that kills me, it really does, but I can’t help you. So I’m going to give you the best advice I possibly can, and please, don’t take this the wrong way.” She paused, and in her focused gaze there was enormous pain. “But stay away from me.”
“No, you ridiculous man, I think you might sleep better once those nightmares disappear,” she said. “But, sure, go ahead and read the worst in what I say if it pleases you.” Other Steve had the decency to look guilty at that.
there. You’re not there at breakfast, and you’re not there when they get home from school, and you’re not there when we sit down to dinner and it just makes your absence that much bigger.”
, Captain. I see Erskine did not fret over much about the intelligence of his lab rat. When the tesseract cast me out into the universe, it cast me all over. I wandered, for decades, maybe centuries, seeing what all of the universes in their near infinity had to offer. And found them all wanting. I found this place, where the fabric of all space and time had begun to weaken, to rip and tear from the hubris of man, and here it is that I will tear it down and remake all of space and time in my image, with none of the
“That’s the long and short of it, yes. I’d like you to be out of the house until three, if you can,” she said. She reached into her back pocket and threw down a black credit card on the table. “Go out. Have fun. Enjoy yourselves. Oh and, can you take this to Peter while you’re out? He forgot his permission form. He goes to Midtown Science.” 3490 Tony handed Pepper the slightly crinkled and well-folded form, also from her pocket. “Just stay out of the house for a bit.”
“I’ll do it,” spoke a soft, easygoing voice from the back. It was Bruce, of course. In the name of science, Bruce would do anything.
“Jesus, Pops, just drop it, I came on this little outing like you wanted didn’t I? What else do you want from me? Let’s just watch the damn game,” James snapped. Dad fell silent, as did the rest of them. Well, the rest of them minus Kate—when, the next second, their team hit another homerun she popped right back up out of her seat to scream and cheer. Dad stayed seated, that look never once leaving his face. And Peter felt anger pooling in his stomach, and then frustration and anger on top of that at his impotence, his utter inability to do anything about the situation. He couldn’t put a grin back on his dad’s face anymore than he could put one on his brother’s. He couldn’t restore cheer to the ball park, couldn’t turn it back into a place of sunshine and cheer and bubblegum. Only James could do that. And he never would.
“Ok, no, enough with the tearing me limb from limb question here,” Peter said, ending that particular line of scientific inquiry.
break all of Coulson’s fingers.” Maria, looking somewhere between embarrassed and murderous, slowly loosed her grip on Coulson’s hand.
But that was the extent of their conversation. At least, until the battle was over and they could both breathe a sigh of relief, knowing the kids and their own team would be returning shortly. Steve finally got up off the couch, ready to get some sleep. It was dark out—they would all need to get some shuteye.

,” he snapped. James did his best to swallow down his own anger. Peter was hurt. He was hurting. He was hurting all over the place and there was bound to be a casualty or two—and James had pissed him off earlier.
“This will all be over soon enough,” she said. “Before you know it, honey.” Steve just smiled back at his wife, but privately he thought nothing could be soon enough unless it was
“It was a universal bomb,” she told them when other Tony asked how she’d survived and where she’d been. “Transports people immediately near it and then blows up. It was intentionally opening a big rip in our universe. The Tower and the helicarrier both have universal beacons built into them, to attract any wanderers. Blow a universal bomb anywhere near one in our thin universe? Boom, tons of rips, threat of collapse. I tried to warn you before I got blasted into
“I didn’t marry my wife for her looks, or her wealth—or her gender. I married her for her mind, which I know quite well. You seem to be quite similar to her. And I know that, were our positions reversed, there is no way in hell Tony would be sleeping soundly by my side in our room—she’d be out, sneaking through the halls of the Other mansion, ready to hack into the workshop,” 3490 Steve replied. “Go get some sleep, Tony, as hard as that may be for you to obtain. It’ll be like Christmas when you wake up—only this time, you won’t have found all the presents first.” Tony was still reeling at the many implications of that short statement from the 3490 Captain America. He knew that every Christmas he would go hunting for his parents’ stash of Christmas presents long before they were wrapped and would, of course, find them, which was
“Our second and third weddings, respectively,” Tony said, an amused smile tugging up her lips. “We didn’t
“I don’t know!” MCU Steve protested, attempting to pry his double’s hands off his chest. “I don’t know what they want, I don’t know why they’re after me, I don’t even know who they are!” Commander Rogers wasn’t having any of it.
But Steve couldn’t ease up. He felt like a violin string pulled too taut, winding tighter and tighter and ready to snap. He would get these monsters after his family. He would wipe them from the face of the multiverse if it was the last thing he did—and he knew with a cold certainty that he would do anything needed to get there.
Peter had attended a lot of funerals in his short life. Most of the time, they were for people he’d never met before—soldiers who had died in battle and his father and family had been invited to come and maybe say a few words, foreign dignitaries his mother had known through philanthropic work, members of the fifty state initiative he’d never actually seen or spoken with. Both sets of his grandparents had been long dead by the time he’d been born. In fact, the only funeral Peter could recall with clarity that was for someone he had actually known (if only a little), had been that for Scott Lang, the Ant Man. Peter hadn’t known the man well, though. He had never lived at the manor. He’d known Cassy, though, and he could remember seeing her at the funeral with her mother, dressed head to toe in black, an all-too-solemn expression on her eight year old face.
As he watched Pepper wave goodbye to the children she so clearly wished were hers, Tony couldn’t watch anymore. He headed to the living room where he knew Antonella was. He would get answers. He had to.
“You ok, Cap?” Tony asked. “You’re catching flies and getting all glassy eyed.” Steve blinked, suddenly drawn back to the real world. He shut his mouth, which
“Landed on m’feet partially,” James spoke gruffly as Peter approached. James was on his side, his face ashen where it wasn’t covered in blood. Peter guessed it was a broken nose causing the ghastly sight. “Saved m’head. Not the legs. Right’s broken.” Peter reached over his brother, gently checking his spine for damage. He was relieved there didn’t appear to be any, but his heart still pounded with adrenaline. There was a small pool of blood forming beneath him.

that you’re older,” Kate insisted, moving her arms once again to pull him closer. Francis looked increasingly uncomfortable.
“You need to eat something, Katie,” Francis said, sitting down next to her. She could just feel herself tensing. Her right hand was balling into a fist, her nails digging into her palm almost painfully. She couldn’t process everything that had happened to them all just then, but she
“No! We don’t need an assist! We’ve got this!” Tony said, just as a doombot bodily slammed into him, its flight systems failing. Tony got knocked off course but he managed to right himself.
They were very friendly, each and every one of them. They didn’t seem all that different from her own universe’s version of them. The group consisted of Tony, Steve, Thor, Jan, Natasha, and Clint. Their Tony and Steve, to Tony’s delight, were together, for the first time in any encounters Tony had had with other universes. The first week was entirely uneventful, and the Avengers of Earth-525 were integrating exceedingly well with those of 3490. Both Steves got on like a house on fire, and spent plenty of time swapping war stories and trading tactical ideas. 525 Clint was a fantastic prankster and driving 3490 Clint nuts as he tried (and failed) to get back at him. Both Thors spent their time in much the same way the Steves did, regaling one another with stories of their triumphs. The Jans got along fairly well, too, even if 3490 Jan wasn’t always around at the mansion. The 525 Avengers played with Francis, James, Azari, and Torrun, challenging them to epic nerf gun battles that sometimes spanned across days. 525 Natasha and 3490 Natasha were the only ones who didn’t seem to get along.
“Hey,” Francis spoke, his voice still right at her ear. She looked up at him; she sat in an armchair, and he on the arm of said chair. He looked down at her with such concern.
“It was years ago—but it was my fault. I should have known. Should have had a better grip on my company. Shouldn’t have been making weapons in the first place. That’s why I switched to the green movement, to clean energy, because I saw what happens when those weapons end up in the wrong hands,” Tony took a long drink of the coffee. He set it down and poured another mug, handed it to Steve. “And now, years later, other people are still paying for my sins.”
discover those responsible for his wife’s death and bring them to justice. He was doing a remarkable job of resembling a functioning human being, a functioning commander, when his oldest son’s panicked voice shouted over the communication system that Peter was MIA.
Tony Stark was happy. Unbelievably happy. Some days she just sat and wondered how she had managed to get so lucky in life. She still had no answer to that question, but she didn’t much mind.
Steve, when we first met. Only I had the advantage of meeting him when we were both young. We had a lot to learn from each other, and I’m glad we did. I’m not half as good at anything as I am when I’m doing it with him,” she said. “I can’t speak to your Steve necessarily but, I know that I thought the guy was judging everything I was doing until I found out that a lot of that was in my head. He’s really much more open and understanding than you’d guess for a guy raised in the 20s and 30s. And he’s sharp as a tack too, learns very quickly—eidetic memory. He’s—you’re right about the moral thing, he does have high standards. But they’re the
.” Kate was yelling by the end. She was crying too, she thought, but she wasn’t sure. She’d stood up at some point. Her hands were clenched into fists at her sides, and her dad looked alarmed.
“All right,” James relented. “Just—just this once.” Torrun nodded and gave him a small smile. She left the room.
“Me? Nothing. But nothing in the universe is random, exactly. I think we might have cracked the first part of predicting when and where these leaks will appear and disappear—thank you, Dr. Jane Foster!” Tony whooped. Natasha watched the iron suit do a flip in the sky. “Now, we can—“
“My Aunt Natasha has a small white scar on her upper lip. Uncle Clint doesn’t go anywhere without his hearing aid in. Aunt Pep’s hair was shorter by several inches last week, Jane, while beautiful, is at least twenty years older than this woman here, and
“We’re getting blasted from up top,” Steve said grimly. “We’ve only got two fliers, Thor and Iron Man are doing their best.”
“Well, let me know if you need a refreshment at any point, Agent Giggles,” Senator Stark said. Pepper shot Steve a look of what was probably sympathy but possibly also exasperation, before continuing her previous discussion with her boss. Late at night they finished. Pepper kissed the Senator’s cheek before exiting out the elevator, and the Senator headed—not to bed, as Steve had expected, but also into the elevator after Pepper had left. Steve stepped inside silently with him.

“How finite life is. How fleeting. How we should focus on every minute instead of getting bogged down in petty arguments. Whenever somebody dies we remember, for a week or a month or a year, and we say to ourselves, ‘wow, I need to appreciate the people in my life more’, and then we forget. Time marches on without them and suddenly we’re back to our old selves and it’s like we never had that bit of enlightened realization at all. Back to petty fights and things unsaid and regrets,” Steve replied, opening his eyes and staring up at the blank white ceiling.
“Ow, yes,” Tony said, taking his wrist back. He wouldn’t be surprised if she left a bruise for the morning—damn super strength. She rolled her eyes.
punched his dorky, sensitive little brother on James’ watch. Especially not their father. James rounded the corner, barreling onto the scene. His hands were jammed in his pockets and he did his best to keep his expression casual even as he felt the fury rising.

It was July of 1998. His birthday had been on Saturday, and Tony had insistently driven him up to her beach house on Cape Cod after throwing a surprise party for him on Friday at her mansion. He had been surprised when she had announced that she was dropping him off when they got there, giving him a weekend of quiet at the beach—he insisted that she stay. There had been a note of awkwardness between them that year, from the time he and Bernie separated all the way until their Christmas kiss. He knew that she knew that Bernie had suspected him of cheating on him with her, that Bernie had left because of his friendship with her, because it was all-consuming in many ways. Steve knew Tony felt horribly guilty. She had tried, in increasingly extravagant ways, to make up for it. Relatively speaking, a little surprise party with his closest friends and a weekend at the beach was tame.

This was the last chapter I wrote before I took a break that was years long; this is the last thing that was written in the 2014/15 era.
“Fliers, make sure they don’t try to break off and run around the breach,” Steve ordered as the Hulk roared again and the Hydra agents fled with renewed vigor. Plenty of them ran straight through the breach without any further fight. “How long have we got, James?”
“I don’t know much help I’ll be,” Azari said as he came up to Bruce, grim-faced, “but I’ve got some basic training in field medicine.”
“You know kid it really wouldn’t hurt to get that checked out at a hospital. Unless I’ve been informed incorrectly, you
Thor threw her a look that was somewhere between exasperation and kicked golden retriever, then said,
One wouldn’t do it. Kate knew that. All she wanted was something to help her forget her life for a few hours, something to make her feel like every other average kid. But Kate couldn’t get drunk, and drugs were tricky. For them to have any effect at all, there had to be a lot of them hitting her system, all at the same time. Tudo had said
a shout and the sound of bone cracking on metal. Peter looked up—only to see his brother above on the rafters, fighting a guy his own age for a sniper rifle. Peter had no idea how either of them was still up there; they should have managed to shove each other off onto the ground, but somehow they were both still fighting in the rafters. Peter didn’t even think twice—he climbed up the nearest wall and started running on the rafters.

“I—of course,” 525 Tony agreed. “Of course.” Steve could see stars. He’d lost this fight. There would be no talking to these people. They had some kind of twisted reasoning, all of them, that Steve could not follow. There was no point in trying.
? Francis wondered. He couldn’t tell what was bothering Kate, specifically, which unnerved him. He had never felt so distanced from her before in his life. She was doing things and making decisions that were completely unexpected—like, for example, this meeting at Avengers Academy.
. I mean really, guys, come on. I could have put James, Azari, Torrun, Kate and Billy out there and it would have been cleaned up in twenty.”
“I didn’t mean it like that,” James said gently. “I didn’t mean to sound patronizing. Of course you’re grieving—we’re all grieving. I just meant—it hasn’t—it hasn’t sunk in yet. You said you can’t process—that’s what shock feels like. Shock as an emotion or lack thereof, not, you know, circulatory shock. But it will…it will pass, is what I’m saying, and I guess that doesn’t help because the rest feels worse but—shit, Pete, I’m bad at this kind of thing. I just meant that when it sinks in…everyone’s in the same boat here. I know what you’re feeling. I know what you’re going through, and—”
“YOU WEREN’T EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE OUTSIDE THE BUNKER! POT, KETTLE CAPTAIN,” MCU Tony yelled. They had been yelling for—Peter had no idea, actually, but it didn’t seem like they’d stopped arguing since they’d left the field thirty minutes ago. They probably hadn’t. That would be pretty par for the course for Tony Starks and Steve Rogers.
we all know you are with interpersonal relations,” Natasha said dryly, “but Steve’s right. If anyone’s bringing that kid back of his own free will, it’s you, Stark. I’ve got a feeling you’re the only reason we got let into the bunker in the first place.”
“Don’t tell me you already ran six miles,” Tony’s sarcastic drawl startled Steve so badly that he nearly dropped his toast.
“Sometimes we have to make hard choices, Peter,” MCU Steve said. Peter looked over at him. His eyes were far away. “We have to do what we know is right.”
” Clint cried, stretching out his arms for his daughter, who was currently clinging to Kate. Kate readily handed her over. “Oh, thank God, Kate, thank you—”
“Come on, grab my arms. Alt Steve’ll pull us up,” Kate said. Peter raised his arms up, and Kate grabbed his forearms. He grabbed hers in turn, but his grip was weak. Kate shouted up to Alt Steve, and he pulled them slowly.
“By my calculations? About a year,” Tony said. “You’re all more than welcome to stay here, or at the Triskelion, whichever you prefer. We’ll be providing you with a clothing allowance so you can set yourselves up more comfortably. We’ll take care of you while you are here, and if you feel the urge to help us with Avengers or S.H.I.E.L.D. business, we’re always grateful for it. But we’ll still provide you with shelter and clothing and food even if you just want to take the year off.”
She recognized the scene. She’d played Clara in the Nutcracker that December, the coveted title role. She’d worked the whole
Whatever James would have said, however, Steve would never know, for at that moment Thor landed in the middle of the rink cracking the thin layer of ice. He was squarely in the midst of their group of tired and battered Avengers. It wasn’t the Thor Steve knew, though—although that was difficult to tell since, really, the Thors didn’t look much different from one another. No, Steve knew because of what Thor held in his hand. It was a glove. A
endangered James’ life—” Peter slowly appeared to be melding with his seat. James’ face was ashen. Tony felt a pang of sympathy for the kid, even if he didn’t like him. He knew what it was like to be used in your parents’ arguments like a prop.
“Steve has a point,” Pepper said. She still clutched her coffee cup like it was the only thing keeping her sane. It might have been. Pepper never signed up for this insanity. “If they didn’t trust us, they wouldn’t put us with their kids.”
—James would be lying if he said he wasn’t excited. To say it was exclusive was to say the Avengers were picky about members. Largely the scene of the mutant crowd, not even Academy kids—that is to say, SHIELD Academy kids, half of whom were just a small step away from mutant—were invited. Famous people seemed to be the only non-mutants ever allowed inside. James had no idea how Kate had managed to get tickets inside, even if she
“I don’t expect you to say anything,” she said. “You’re just here. Convenient ears. All the more convenient that they’re almost just my own.” Antonella took a long drink of her sparkling grape juice as Tony tried to gather his thoughts, which seemed to have scattered to the wind.

“Morning,” her dad replied, his voice still rough. He went to the table, kissed the top of Kate’s head, and took a seat. He watched her with concern written all over his face. He asked her quietly, “How are you doing, Kate?” Kate shrugged. How did he want her to answer that, anyway? More and more people were filtering into the kitchen. When some of the younger kids showed up, she helped pass out bowls of cereal.
“I’ve got this, guys,” he said. He shoved his sunglasses down over his eyes and opened the gate in the fence, which was for some reason—laziness, probably—unlocked. Peter still stood, waiting, and looking mildly horrified. Tony just waltzed over to him and shoved the form at him. Peter took it. “Permission form. Your mother wouldn’t let us leave the house without it.”
“I’m making JARVIS play it anyway and I’m going to sit right here so you’ll have to watch me watching it so there.”
“Everyone, move to the sides so they have nowhere to go. Bruce, come at them straight on. Less smash, more… roar?” Steve suggested, though it was still unclear how much instruction the Hulk understood through Banner. He didn’t hear Bruce reply though. A few seconds later, a terrifying roar ripped through the air. It was enough to make some of the younger teens pause, even. Some of the hydra agents paused—and then they all started running as the great green monster came barreling at them. Steve jumped off the winter hut and joined his team on the left side, making sure the agents ran back into the ice rink and towards the breach.
I didn't actually have any ideas for the big battle scene back in 2014. I knew what needed to happen, but not how it was going to happen. How many times, after all, can you say "and a big scary army came and ripped up NYC and smashed stuff". So this time I tried not New York and not a city. It's 2021, I do what I want.
know it sucks. Let’s be real about it—if I want to join the Avengers one day, I’ve got a spot on the team. No question. Does it matter what skill I have, what training I’ve done? A little. Peter wouldn’t have a slot without his recent run in with a spider. But I think we all know that really, my dad will put me on the team when I’m older if it’s what I want. I have only to ask. Or hint. Or join SHIELD. It will happen for me one day. But the rest of you? Well, you’re bound for the 50 States Initiative. Or no team at all. Or Prison 42 if you make a mistake.”
If his goal was to throw her off, Tony had to admit that it had worked. She couldn’t spend long thinking about this—there were more important fights to fight than against just this one double.
His dad, Peter figured, must be feeling like that now. Everyone was going to leave and help. He’d be alone in this bunker, listening in on the comms and just waiting for everyone to come back, to pull through. Peter didn’t really like the idea of his dad with that vacant look in this cold bunker all alone.
“It was nice meeting you all,” Peter said from where he sat on the platform of the boxing ring, his sister beside him.
“I’m your father, James,” Steve said, half-defeated. “I don’t want you to get hurt. You haven’t seen active combat. You don’t know what it’s
“Hey, you three want to have a civilized conversation at the breakfast table?” Alt Steve demanded. For a moment, Peter and his brother and sister just stared, half-startled. It was, Peter thought, the first time an Alt had interfered or in any way made their presence known during a ‘family matter’. Kate was the first to laugh, but James joined her and even Peter had difficulty choking down a snigger. Alt Steve at first looked confused, then
When they had pulled up to the building, Francis had raised an eyebrow. Kate had texted every student
“I do, Commander. Hell if I know how, but the Red Skull has returned,” Fury said solemnly. “HYDRA wants my head. They didn’t want me getting the information to the rest of SHIELD.”
back in the bunker. But they were too wrapped up in one another to notice anything but themselves. It was so gross.
“I think you all know exactly why I’ve assembled you here today,” Kate said over the crowd. “You’ve seen the news. You’ve seen the streets. You’ve been in contact with SHIELD as you wait for your school to reopen. You know what’s happening. The Avengers are dealing with other problems. And me and some of your other classmates are dealing with the leaks, with anything and everything that pops into existence from the tears in our universe. But we can’t do it alone. We’re getting pummeled. We have too few people to begin with, and we’re getting hit so many times a day none of us can keep up. At this rate, we’ll be dead by the end of the week. We were almost dead this afternoon. We can’t do this alone. So I’m asking you to join us. I know you’re not even eighteen yet. And I know you’re scared. I’m scared. But we have to do something before it’s too late.”
“Twenty on that big, muscle-y dark haired guy over in the corner,” Steve said to Nat via his earpiece. Natasha was on the other side of the ballroom, looking gorgeous but deadly in a backless green dress and strappy silver stilettos.
To James, it had seemed like the sun had finally started shining again when Tony put the gauntlet on. That was probably due, in part, to the fact that when he did, a great, blinding white light washed over the whole battlefield, and by the time James had finally blinked the light out of his eyes all the ominous, dark patches of space had disappeared from the sky. The atmosphere was nothing but a beautiful bright blue, filled with fluffy clouds and chirping birds. The Hydra agents—even the dead ones—had disappeared entirely. The grime was mysteriously gone from James’ uniform. And there, on his knees still in the suit, was Tony, the gauntlet having disappeared as well.
“This wasn’t you standing up and saying no, this was you taking the opportunity to show off and be an ass right back,” Dad said. His tone hadn’t changed. There was still all that anger burning just beneath the surface—he was
,” Jane said quickly, putting Peter on the ground and taking Kate from James. “Shush, honey, it’s going to be all right, I promise. Shh.” James’ heart was pounding. If the bad men showed up, Kate would give them all away. He had to do something.
He emerged from below, opening the door over his head. He shut it and stepped away; some of Tony’s tech faded the door into the rest of the cement, looking as if it had never been. The great doors to the warehouse were open, revealing the dim orange light of the evening and the sunlit docks beyond, sparkling with reds and pinks and yellows in the sunset. He could hear the cries of gulls overhead, could smell the water and the pollution too—God, James hadn’t even realized how he’d missed these sights and sounds and smells, but now that he did he realized how much he hated the bunker, their tomb of safety. He breathed deeply even if the smell wasn’t pleasant, because it was something other than filtered air. He stepped through the empty warehouse, his foot splashing in a puddle on the ground from the leaky roof. He stepped outside into the bright sunshine and smiled briefly—but his smile was quickly cut short when he realized what he was actually seeing. He ducked back inside the warehouse, taking cover behind the wall. Out in the world of orange sunsets was a large group of AIM agents gathering. At least, James was fairly certain they were AIM. They didn’t wear a uniform or anything, but most of them had weapons, and they obviously weren’t SHIELD.
“I suppose that’s it then. All we can do for now. Fine. I’ll let 199999 get some sleep,” Tony said. She knew they must be tired. From their conversations she had gleaned that they had been in a battle shortly before arriving, and who knew how long any of them had been up before then. She was almost fond of the alternates, even as wary as she was around them. They had a certain innocence. It led, she thought, to naivete, but Tony found charm in it anyway.
“PULL BACK! EVERYONE GET BACK, AND DON’T LET THEM TOUCH YOU!” James called out. Natasha for once felt no need to question his orders. They fell back so that they could regroup for new orders—but Natasha really had no idea how you fought a Frost Giant. Loki didn’t exactly count.
in published papers, lest the general public tried to jump ship and accidentally destroy the multiverse itself.
“No,” said Bruce, who clenched and unclenched his fists and breathed deeply. Steve found it a testament to the nanite technology that, despite the close quarters, despite the fact that his own children were in the room, 3490 Steve looked entirely unconcerned with Bruce’s state.
They had only just finished their fight, really, when the alarm got pulled. And Steve knew that Tony was pissed beyond belief that he’d gotten ‘babysitting duty’ as he called it. Steve hadn’t taken too kindly to the term. There had been yet another fight and now, neither of them willing to
“Director Stark has approved your entrance,” JARVIS told him moments later as Steve heard the click of a lock coming undone. Steve opened the door slowly, then descended the stairs. It was a bit dark and glum in the lab. The floor was a simple grey concrete, likely for easy clean-up. There were a few steel tables, littered with equipment and half-finished devices. In the back, Steve could see a couple of Iron Man suits, stationary but fully assembled. There was one small area cordoned off with a sofa, a mini-fridge, a microwave, and a TV. Well, that explained how 3490 Tony was still alive, at least. The woman herself was busy working at one of the tables, screwing something violently into something else. Her hair was up high on her head in a bun that was half falling out. She just wore a grey tank top, splattered with grease stains, and sweatpants. She didn’t look up as he came in.
“Have to have a built-in defense system if you’re jumping universes,” 525 Tony said. “Can’t always bring along a briefcase.”
distraction. “Keep your eyes in the sky, Iron Man, that’s where we need you; we’ve got the ground covered.”
“I—Oh, oh, God,” she breathed. “Oh, God—Steve it’s—” She was shouting into the mic at that point, but a moment later it didn’t matter because she never finished her sentence. Flames burst out of the windows of the ninety-first story, throwing glass to the street as SI employees and the families of the Avengers screamed and scrambled to get out of the way.
“Sorry,” he apologized shortly. “I shouldn’t have—we take care of our own here, all right? We can handle it.”
“Well, it’s black and skimpy, it’s not exactly a far cry from your usual attire,” Peter said dryly. Kate punched him on the shoulder again. “I thought you couldn’t go to any Halloween parties?”
“Well, we’ll just have to keep them relatively calm then,” Tony said. She sat back on the couch. The other Steve and Tony were engaged in a rather heated argument. “My counterpart won’t be an issue. Scariest part about him is his hacking ability and he won’t be able to crack my systems. I’ll make sure of that. He hasn’t got Extremis anyway, so that makes things easier, and frankly, personality-wise I don’t think he ever left the nineties.”
off. She had tried to shrug it off, but the odd feeling persisted. She continued to be baffled by it—Extremis kept her in prime condition, after all—until Aunt Flo refused to visit.
James had to steel himself to meet his father’s gaze. He was tired. That much was clear. But he wasn’t tired in the way that he should have been from a day of crime-fighting. He wasn’t tired in the way that he would want to go to bed and sleep for a million years. He was tired in the way that he would lie down in bed and stare at the ceiling, unable to sleep. He was tired in the way that when he finally would, he would have nightmares. James knew that kind of tired. They were
She’d seen pictures before and heard the stories, but seeing that monstrous face that was, literally, just a red skull with eyes—well, Kate was once again gaining an understanding about the phrase
“THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE GRABBED SOMEONE AND GONE STRAIGHT BACK,” MCU Tony retorted. Peter moved away from the living room where they were duking it out—were he home, were they his family, he knew how the argument would end, with his mom and dad making out and everyone in the vicinity getting grossed out. These two? Well, they weren’t any different really. Nobody was blind to what was happening between the two of them—their awkward dancing around each other was ridiculously obvious.
“10-4,” James’ voice answered on the other end. “Red team in the sky, ETA sixty seconds.” Kate nodded her understanding—must have been a reflex, since James certainly couldn’t hear her.
? His tank top was far too tight on his body, and Tony had to wonder if he always wore those on purpose. Tony grunted in response. He was working on the plans he had by
“Shut up,” Tony replied affectionately. “I’ll talk to you in…I don’t know. Maybe ten hours or so, Bruce is working on setting up the computers to do all the work, and once they’re going we’ll have an exact time.”
“Oh,” Tony said. “Well. That’s simple. I was dying.” Tony started to click back into Extremis when she realized her double was still looking at her.
It was a very long thirty seconds. When it got down to five, James called them out. The barrier was flashing now—sometimes there, and sometimes not. The soldiers yelled and tried to press forward.
“A whole lot of nothing,” 3490 Steve said. He ran a hand through his hair, greasy with sweat and caked with blood. Steve didn’t want to know if it was his or not. “Dr. Richards can explain the science of it, but we’re as in the dark about this as the rest of you.”
. He was behaving completely normally. Absolutely nothing was changed. Nothing. It was perfectly normal that they’d been catapulted to another universe in which Tony was a girl and they were married.
The force and the heat alone could easily have destroyed the armor. Even if it didn’t, the armor can only take so much weight crushing in on it. It can take a lot of punishment, but not a whole damn building. If by some miracle she managed to survive, if the Avengers don’t find and rescue her in three days, she’ll die of dehydration, and that’s assuming that she has enough air in the wreckage to last that long and isn’t sealed in. Point zero one in a million. I don’t trust in faith. I trust in math. And the math isn’t coming out favorably.” MCU Steve shot a glance behind him, Peter guessed at MCU Tony, as he was the one to speak next.
Tony Stark couldn’t pretend that she wasn’t surprised when another group of Avengers suddenly appeared in the middle of the helicarrier. She knew that there was a…
Unless he wasn’t coming. Tony wondered if he’d gotten word of her plot, had heard that her order for the party to begin at four had been returned to six. She wondered if he was just planning to show up late in the evening regardless of when the party began. Tony wasn’t sure, but the possibilities made her anxious. Nevertheless, she would stand there, she resolved, until six o’clock when her duties as hostess began.
“I could send them to the Triskelion,” Tony said, looking reluctant. “But it’s easier to monitor them here. And you know what they say about keeping your friends close…”
“I know my mother loves me,” Kate said. “I just wish she could be proud of me, too.” Kate went quiet. Steve didn’t know what to say, or if he should say anything at all. It was difficult, having your teenage daughter who isn’t your daughter bare her soul to you.
Given, though, that the only other thing her parents tended to be really hush hush about had been the trauma that was 525’s collision with their universe, Kate did not want to ask and find out more.
She looked to Natasha and to Clint. Well, twenty, they could handle. She steeled herself, reaching for her next arrow, when she felt another great tremble.
“Please,” 525 Tony said, putting his hands up, and for a moment Tony thought her double was going to beg for his life. But then he got on his knees. “Please do it.”
“Well, James and Francis got quite upset with him, I think, but he’ll be ok,” Antonella said, sounding uncomfortable.
I really should say thank you a thousand times over to Aster, who has been here since the start and before. So thank you, Aster, a thousand times over.
The Avengers were in disarray. James was used to seeing his father in command mode, used to watching him shout orders and think up strategies to keep everyone safe, but now he just wore a dazed expression, barely dodging bullets. Uncle Bucky was the one getting him out of the way, covering his back. Natasha was the one throwing out orders, Natasha and MCU Captain America. The Avengers and the Alts were busy taking out the assailants, as were some of the Avenger kids. They had, after all, been to the Academy for years. They had trained for this moment.

. Like you don’t care what we would feel if you were gone! Like it’s more important to you to go be a superhero than it is to be
“Maybe,” Kate said, “but that doesn’t matter. Because you won’t tell him. Because then you’d have to tell him that you
“JARVIS?” Peter rasped. “JARVIS are you there?” There was no answer. Whatever has shorted his mic must have shorted the whole system. Peter felt his stomach sink to his feet. They would think he was dead. They had probably thought he was dead shortly before he ever even entered the building. Worse: they had no way of finding him. “Shit.”
“Yup,” Steve said. And that was all that was said on the matter until the 3490 kids came in to make breakfast of their own.
Of course, it was only a moment after his awkward statement that the bald guy pulled the trigger on his own gun. The bullet would have landed on Peter if it weren’t for the fact that Peter had been ready for it. He’d brought his webshooters, and he shot web up to the rafters before the dude could even fire. He jumped up out of harm’s way, using the web to pull himself higher. As he dropped back down, he swung down towards the thug and kicked the gun out of his hand. Unfortunately, the girl had gained her presence of mind by then and was shooting at him. The bullets were fairly easy for Peter to avoid—
Peter shifted himself up, leaning back on his elbow as he swept the room with the flashlight. Some of the metal shelves had collapsed, spilling their contents all over the ground. It was one such metal shelf that was resting on top of his leg. It hurt like a motherhugger, but he was glad his leg hadn’t been completely severed. The front half of the room was, well, squashed. Peter couldn’t see the door anymore—all he could see was collapsed plaster, and chunks of ruined concrete. The roof seemed closer than it had before. He could hear worrying crumbling noises from above.
“Mutant Growth Hormone. Designer drug. It simulates an X gene in the user for a while. So, you’re at a party, everybody’s drunk, and instead of getting high you decide it would be a hell of a lot more fun if you and your buddies could breathe fire or fly or whatever. Of course, there’s no guaranteeing your power would be cool, but—”
sessions. The real trouble’s outside. Save your strength. If you were sloppy enough to get hit in the head by one of these things—“ James held up one of the little metal orbs that flew around the room and shot tiny lasers out of an eye (a Star Wars influence, Tony had no doubt) at them, “—then you’re tired or you’re distracted or both. The goal isn’t to exhaust everyone. We just need to learn to work as a team. And I think we’re getting better.” James shrugged. “I guess we’ll find out soon enough.” He pointed to a green sterilite bin in the corner. “First Aid’s over there.” Apparently unconcerned after that, James headed out of the room, leaving Tony—of course—with Steve. The thing of it was, Tony couldn’t exactly scramble to get up and away from Steve. Not that he didn’t
So Tony followed the kid all the way back to his room. Peter didn’t even notice, which was probably a testament to how distracting the pain must be as Tony wasn’t exactly sneaking. Tony leaned up against the doorframe of his not-son’s room. The kid hadn’t bothered to shut the door and was in the process of taking his shirt off, facing the other direction. He hissed as he did so, and Tony could see why. Even from the back he could see the edge of a large, dark bruise.
for so long, so uncertainly…But we were under the mistletoe, so. I was the one to kiss him—but he was the one to dip me and sweep me off my feet after I did. It was—sappy.” Antonella smiled. “Very sappy. I miss sappy. I miss Steve.”
“Ok, Tony,” he agreed. Then he hesitated. “Is—is Dad coming?” Tony gave him a bright smile that he knew was forced, and he winced a little internally.
“I know it was more than that,” Steve said, his gut twisting horribly. James just shrugged. He wasn’t looking at him. Steve put a hand on James’ shoulder. “Look we don’t—we don’t have to do this right now. I just want you to rest up and get better. But I want you to know—I know it doesn’t matter how many times I say it if I never show it, but I
. It reminded Steve of the days before Thor and Jane moved out, before the slow trickle of Avengers left the mansion, and the mansion stopped being ‘Avengers Mansion’ and started just being his and Tony’s home. “Wish our Capsicle here’d wear it more often. Might dislodge that stick in his ass.”
it violated civil liberties, and was afraid of what superhuman registration could mean one day. But the alternative was unacceptable to me. We worked it out, but there was a period of time when I thought we wouldn’t. We could come to blows over it—literal blows, I knew. We were an inch away from an actual civil war. But you know what I realized, on the day when I thought it was really going to happen, that we were really going to go to
It was too little, too late. Like ants below, she could see that Steve had stopped fighting. Either he was dead or unconscious. They were dragging him away.
“Well,” Steve said slowly, considering, “No. I don’t think it’s really any of my business, little miss.” Kate cocked her head to one side.
“Maybe it is just a growth spurt,” Kate said with a shrug. “Super serum genes finally kicking in for him.”
“Oh yeah, you’re so much better than the rest of us,” James said, rolling his eyes. “Tell me, Pete, how has that superior intellect of yours gotten you out of regular ass-kickings at school?
“Oh no, I knew she was crazy from the start, that’s why I picked her,” Tony assured him. “Crazy in life, crazy in the sack—but the ABBA antics were a bit much. Kristi! Her name was Kristi. Kristi with a ‘k’.” The two of them just laughed for a moment. Their children had long since left. The only ones left in the kitchen were them, Steve, and—well, Steve looked around. No one else was left. It was just him. He started to slink out, embarrassed. He hadn’t meant to be intruding.
But hadn’t Steve himself deepened that fear? Hadn’t Tony seen the damage he had done with James and just tried with all her might to avoid it with Kate? Hadn’t she just been trying to preserve their relationship? Really for the first time, Steve was seeing what Tony saw. She hadn’t been seeing Howard, like Steve had accused her of. She’d seen
A trick. It had to be a trick. He would not let himself believe this, not even for a second. He could not let himself believe it, for fear of having it ripped away.
“Ugh, can we please talk about something else? I’m with Kate on this one,” Peter said, pulling a face.
standards. I promise, he’s not judging you because you sleep around. If he judges you at all it’s probably on how you act in the field, or how he perceives you spend your money—he was eleven when the Great Depression hits, he’s not a fan of big business or spending wastefully. Sometimes it’s still something we argue about.” Antonella shrugged.
“I couldn’t tell you how much,” Steve replied simply. Tony looked at the brewing pot of coffee, and then turned it off.
different. Bucky seemed darker somehow. Like a shadow was cast over him. “It’s not really—it’s not really a story for Thanksgiving. Some other time, yeah?”
more. If they did, maybe James could be convinced to take an actual break. Thinking about their fearless leader, Torrun wondered if he’d eaten anything yet that day. She doubted it—there had been a morning shift and an afternoon shift of fighting, and James had been out for them both. Quietly, while the others spoke, Torrun moved about the kitchen, making up a hearty dinner. She slipped out of the kitchen, unnoticed, as the others argued.
in about six different places—she was monitoring a few different situations via the internet, sending out texts to those who required instruction and planning for the next day. Halloween was often a busy day for SHIELD—plenty of mutants took it as the opportune time to reveal themselves, and they weren’t all wanna-be heroes and vigilantes. Not only was she keeping an eye on SHIELD operations, but the back of her mind was spinning wheels, trying to get a handle on the idea that her son, the

to one another.” Peter, for one, felt thoroughly upbraided by the comments, and found himself absently stirring his remaining bits of cereal in milk. Kate looked chastised as well. James though—well, James just looked like he’d been issued a challenge.
The funeral began. With traditional organ music, and a priest. The priest was doing a lot of talking, and there were even bouts of singing by a cantor. Lots of words. Peter wasn’t really paying attention. Peter was paying attention to his breathing, to the roaring in his ears, to the tightness in his chest. Peter was trying his level best not to cry, not to break down into sobs, because this funeral was an entire Catholic mass and he did not have it in him to cry for a solid hour straight.
Clint looked at Natasha. Natasha looked at Clint. She knew they both held the same question—what was happening in eighty-three seconds? Clint nocked an arrow but did not loose it. Natasha brought up her guns. The sound from the non-battle was almost deafening, with the red ammunition hitting the barrier with a sound like glass breaking and dissolving (they must not fear wasting bullets, Natasha noted, if they fired still), the soldiers shouting, and thunder cracking overhead and lightning landing on the ground, discouraging the soldiers from moving to the sides or jumping in the river.
holding back a little—they didn’t want 3490 to see their full hand—Steve doubted they would have been able to win these games anyway. They were, in the words of Nick Fury, hopelessly,
With that, Tony and Steve headed upstairs and then outside where the other Avengers waited. Thor had already transformed—though who the hell knew
“Well, yeah,” James said. “That’s where I can do the most good.” Torrun just stared at him, then shook her head.
choice, though. She’d called him, asking him to call her back, but he didn’t answer. She’d sent him texts, but he didn’t answer those either. It was growing steadily more infuriating.
“I noticed you were gone yesterday,” Steve said. Tony sat on the living room couch, tablet in hand. No one else was around—the kids were at school, 3490 Tony and 3490 Steve were working, Thor and Jane had flitted off to Stark Tower as per usual, and Bruce had joined them. Clint and Natasha were—actually, Steve had no idea, but he rarely knew where either of them were—they slipped in and out of the mansion at their leisure, always quiet. Even Pepper was gone. So Steve, feeling lonely in the empty mansion and still not sure what to do with himself, had wandered into the living room and found Tony.
” she could hear Francis behind her, following after her. She sped up her walk. Maybe he’d take the hint and go away. She could feel tears prickling behind her eyes. Both of her hands were balled into fists as she made her way to a bedroom. She burst in and shut the door behind her. She went straight to the bed and threw herself on it. Unfortunately, a closed door was no match for Francis. He opened it carefully and then shut it behind him again.
“Maybe because you don’t live here? Just a thought,” Kate said. She glanced at the gun. “You know, one day you’re going to blow your dick off and I’m just going to laugh. Why are you packing heat, anyway, you expect to get jumped on the way here? I know Long Island is so dangerous in the peak of broad daylight—Brookville, especially—but I think you’re a big boy with super soldier genes who can handle it.”
“…One. I think,” James said. He sounded so very out of it, and his eyes were out of focus. Peter could see that one of his pupils was more dilated than the other—concussion. Peter had to will his hands to stop shaking. They were on James’ abdomen. James couldn’t feel how freaked he was.
. I’m just not. She’s the better version of me, hands down, and I’m sick of living with that truth every day.”
“Hey, Rogers,” Jeanne Foucault shouted at her. The rest of the class was gone. Jeanne still stood on the mat in the center of the room, the blood from her nose already drying above her lip. Kate just kept stuffing her equipment in her duffel bag. “Hey,
Dad had gotten up from his seat now by this point as well, coming to stand beside Mom. His expression was difficult to read, but he looked…a bit sad. So did Mom.
“Water under the bridge, Giggles,” Stark said. Was his tone softer, or was Steve losing consciousness? The ceiling lights began to blur. Was he moving? “Giggles?”
ago if he’d really wanted to work on it, but he preferred working on it with Dad, even if all the time they had was in periods like now—a random half an hour stolen somewhere in the day.
“He’s-kind-of-old-for-him-isn’t-he? I mean like, ok, that Steve is like James’ age. But Tony’s like, still the same age,” Tommy said.
“We can call out a couple of Agents, see if they can’t give us a hand canvassing the area—you stay here, Tony, to let us know when Peter comes back, all right?” Steve said. James, for once, actually had a look of concern on his face.
“If I’m not,” Kate said, “then I don’t know what the hell my entire childhood was about. All right, if we’re set, let’s move out.” She marched into the lead, headed down the hill they’d landed on and into the trees ahead, other Clint following just one step behind. Natasha stood beside him as he just stood there for a moment.
He’d survived the fall from the train, a result of Arnim Zola’s experiments. He’d been found by the Russians and turned into a weapon, fitted with a metal arm to replace the one he had lost. He had been brainwashed and reprogramed, his memories wiped time and time again. Eventually, he’d ended up going head to head with 3490 Steve, who found a way to restore his memories. But, as Bucky had painfully explained, it had been a very rough road. Steve was filled with empathetic pain enough for 3490 Bucky, but the Natasha of his own universe gave him the worst pains—she
for that argument, too. It wasn’t all on her. She should’ve broken his nose for that dig about Bernie.
Months passed with sparse conversation between them. Steve watched over him at night, and as the campaign really got off the ground, accompanied him with Agent Romanoff to press conferences, meetings, and the like. He was glad for the change of scenery; he didn’t get out much. Still, there was
Clint regarded ten-year-old Kate with one eye, still standing in shooting stance. He lowered his bow.

on one of the command computers. Most of them were unnecessary anyway. Alas, the choice was taken from her. Nick Fury spoke.
him, even from a distance, though. To someone who didn’t know Steve as well as she did, they were probably nearly identical, but she could see how much younger he looked, and how uncertain. He didn’t yet have the air of command that he would grow into. It was strange that he didn’t, though, as Other Tony appeared to be her own age.
“My turn,” Bobbie said as Tony refilled the glasses that needed filling. “Never have I ever had a devil’s threesome. Regretfully.” This time the only ones to drink were Steve, Tony, and Other Tony (though Other Thor first needed an explanation, which he received from a slightly embarrassed Jane). And once again, while no one seemed surprised by either Tony’s participation, all the Alts stared at Steve.
“I can see it in the eyes,” 525 Steve spoke solemnly. “He’s got the same weakness mine did, the same fears. And one day, all that will translate to nothing but destruction and violence.”
“Probably ditched you as soon as you weren’t looking. Who wants their older brother hanging over them? My advice? Leave her alone,” Lizzie said.

He took his seat at the front most pew. Kate and James slid in next to him. Their father slid in last, closest to the aisle. There was no body. They’d never found one—there wasn’t one to be found, Peter knew. But they still had a dark, shiny black casket in front of them, wreathed in red and gold flowers. Peter stared at it, stared at the shiny black and felt like it might just swallow him whole.
The thing of it was, James didn’t need to ask. He already knew the answer. He had always known the answer.
“Going in where?” Steve found himself saying. He knew he should be clapping his boy on the back for his accomplishments. He knew he should be giving him a speech about how proud he was, about how good a man James was growing to be—but only one thought dominated his brain:
“Fine, fine, it’ll just be messy then,” Tony grumbled. He grabbed the lining of the jacket and ripped it open, and suddenly things became clear to Steve. He was checking for bugs.
pregnant? And why—why the kids in the first place? There are or were probably better times to ask that question. Oh well. As you said, it’s out there now.” Antonella sighed deeply, looking suddenly exhausted. Or maybe she had looked exhausted the whole time but her mood had masked it. Tony didn’t know. Antonella set her sugary drink aside.
. She couldn’t even identify the look he was giving her, though that may have been more due to the fact that it was getting harder to see through the tears than her inability to read her husband’s expressions.
Then, suddenly, his cheek stung. The tingling, sharp pain of it lit up his nerves, and suddenly, he felt his mind slamming back into his body. He touched a hand to his cheek and blinked—Natasha. Natasha was now in front of him. Bucky, off to the side, still had a hand on his shoulder and a look of pure concern—and fear—in his eyes. Steve knew that look. It was the same look he’d worn the first time Bucky had resurfaced, the same look when he wondered
“M’fine, m’fine,” Tony groused, sitting up. Billy handed Steve an ice pack, which Steve in turn put on Tony’s head. He jolted back, but it had little to do with the cold. “Agh—just—let me—” Tony swiped the ice pack for himself, putting it where Steve had seen fit to put it—yeah, that was definitely the spot that was going to bruise.
“Hm,” Tony said. “And what about you? Are you a morning person? What are you doing up right now, anyway?”
“So, you’ve never universe hopped before, huh?” Tony asked, approaching slowly. She heard a few more guns cock, preparing to protect her. She waved her hand, dismissing them, in annoyance. She was
“Yeah! Yeah, he thinks it’s permanent,” Peter said, smiling. Mom closed her eyes and let out a breath, and Peter’s smile disappeared. “Isn’t this—I mean, it’s
“Yes,” she said, but there was a little crease between her eyes. She stabbed a bit of turkey with her fork. “Francis told me you’re going overseas in January.”
“Ever heard the phrase, you can lead a horse to water but you can’t make it drink? Well, you can stand here all day mother, but I don’t have to talk to you. So why don’t you stop wasting both of our time and just go back to work or whatever it was you were doing before you decided to invade my personal space,” Kate said. Fury darkened her mother’s face, but Kate was not cowed.
“Hey gorgeous,” she said and ugh, James never wanted to hear his baby sister flirt. It was disturbing on many levels. The guy working the bar looked up. He had tattoos on his arms and spiky black hair. He had more piercings than James could count. The
“Not one of those either then, huh? It must be because you’re an android,” he concluded. Steve rolled his eyes. “Be ready by seven!” With that, Stark wandered off. Steve looked at the flyer again and sighed. At least, he figured, Natasha would be there with him.
“You might ignore him but you’re still listening,” Kate said. She checked her watch, then grabbed her own bag. “See you after school.” With that, she flitted off, leaving Peter to ponder perhaps one of the more profound things she’d ever said.
,” Tony choked out the last bit. She was struggling to keep whatever semblance of composure she had left as she quickly swiped the tears from her eyes. She could see more clearly. Steve’s expression was one of pain, horrible pain. And Tony for a moment, through her anger, felt her gut twist in agony, because no matter how upset she was, this was still her fault, too. No matter how upset she was, she hated hurting him.
noise coming from above. AIM had finally gotten the rest of their goons together. Peter wondered with terror how long it was going to take them to find him and his brother.
“I’m no Reed, though,” Peter said even as he contorted himself into a position that made even Bruce, with all his years of yoga, wince to look at. As he got up, Bruce wrote down the final pieces of their findings. The only thing left were the biological tests, most of which would not show results until the morning.
“Yeah I noticed you and yours don’t get along all that well,” she said. “Is it because he’s so…old fashioned?”
It wasn’t, of course, his shield. For a moment, Tony had thought that it was his, that he’d thrown it and forgotten to catch it, or it had come back at an unexpected angle—but it wasn’t Steve’s shield at all. It was 525 Steve’s shield, and it had caught him in the gut and thrown him backwards.
He knew this day was coming. Their country was still at war, and James, having been in military school since
“Level Six access, or so they tell us. We have no reason to believe otherwise,” Coulson said. He used a slice of bread to obscure his mouth. “Level Six is hardly the deepest layer. It’s what they feel comfortable exposing.” He took a bite. Clint picked up his own wine. He took a sip—oh, 3490 Tony really knew how to get on a guy’s good side. They were certainly trying hard enough.
“It was one of our first missions, when we’d just formed the Avengers officially. We’d been about to sit down to breakfast all together at the manor; Tony had gotten donuts. I didn’t know it at the time, but they weren’t just any donuts. She’d flown out to California, picked up Randy’s, and flown back to New York before eight in the morning. I assume she’d been up all night. But the alarms went off, and we weren’t prepared. And things—things went bad pretty fast. We hadn’t really gelled as a team yet, and we made some sloppy mistakes we wouldn’t later. But we hadn’t learned yet. And I’d told Tony before the mission that we needed to stick together and so, of course, Tony being Tony, she took off at some point and disappeared. By the time the dust cleared, we’d won the fight—and Tony had been a huge part of that—but we couldn’t raise her on the comms, and we were all afraid she wasn’t coming back.
Torrun was near James, polishing her sword and chatting with Azari who looked all prepped and ready to go. Occasionally one of the Avengers Academy kids would walk through, shouting about some vital piece of equipment and
“Well that seems reasonable,” Tony spoke. Fury turned to give her a one-eyed glare. “They can stay with us at the Mansion, like the last group did. There’s only six of them.” Tony hadn’t been terribly fond of the Steve and Tony from Earth-1610 who had landed in their universe and also been stranded for about a week. Her own double Tony didn’t mind much, but Steve’s double was an asshole—he was mysoginistic, rude, and every kind of bad-stubborn her own Steve could be without any willingness to compromise like hers had. He was stuck in the 40s, and it didn’t seem like he was as liberal and understanding and
“Because no one else can do this job,” her father said firmly, but gently. He put a hand on her shoulder, but Kate wrenched away. She was aware that the kitchen had cleared out of everyone but Clint, Peter, Francis and James, and that they were all focused on her outburst, but she didn’t care. She’d throw a fit like a toddler if she had to. She wasn’t keeping her mouth shut about any of this anymore.
compromised. I’m invoking protocol 53. You have to be taken off command Steve—this isn’t—this isn’t good for you.”
Ok. Fine. That was probably a little extreme. She was getting hyperbolic. She took a deep breath and threw the last stick in the trash with the others. She would take it out before Steve got home. She didn’t know how to tell him, or
“You’re still a bit of an enigma to me, Giggles,” Stark said, rising from his chair. He didn’t look relieved, as Steve thought he might have. He looked troubled.
When the alarm had gone off, they’d leapt out of Steve’s bed in unison, pulling on clothes with frankly impressive speed, and when Steve had shown up at the bunker’s exit, dressed for battle and ready to go, no one challenged him on it. Steve wasn’t sure if that was because everyone was far too exhausted to turn down an extra hand, or if everyone from 3490 simply would feel more comfortable if there was at least one Steve Rogers on the field.
“But…why won’t they end up on the Avengers one day? They all have powers,” Peter said, his eyebrows stuck together in confusion. “Mom and Dad they’re not…they’re not
“Powdered,” Ben Banner replied, taking a seat on the floor next to them. Kate knew that Ben was a decent chef, but there was little he could do to make powdered eggs more appealing. Kate hadn’t taken a plate, opting for a mug of coffee instead. Peter just made another face of disgust and disappointment and poked at the eggs again. Thankfully, the younger kids didn’t seem to notice that breakfast was a little less than up to their usual standard; they were watching DVDs of various cartoons that Azari had popped in for them. Kate knew they had to be reeling from the night before—not to mention upset about the fact that this was supposed to be

outside, actually take a stroll and look at the plants, so that was exactly what Steve intended to do.
“We’ll take care of it,” Kate cut in, saving them the awkward silence. Peter was fine. Kate would believe nothing else. To Alt Steve she directed him. “Hang a left, take a shortcut through the alley.” Alt Steve put on a little more gas, and they were zooming through the tiny alley. Kate had to shoot a Hydra agent as they went. She tried not to think about whether they lived or died. She tried not to think about the fact that, with Peter in danger, she didn’t much care.
Kate knew they’d found their own universe’s Nick a while back, though she hadn’t seen him. She hadn’t seen Nick Fury since well before he disappeared and handed his mother a planet’s worth of extra stress and responsibilities.
, he chanted. “Funny thing, though, they don’t stay cute for long, do they? He grew up strong. He grew up arrogant. He grew up—well, a bit of a bully.”
“Oh, that’s a non-issue. I can take care of that. Go, have fun, enjoy your day,” 3490 Tony said. “In fact,
Peter honestly had no idea of where James might be. His brother just took off after everything that went down, and Peter knew he couldn’t let him, that he couldn’t let James go with everything between them. He had to apologize. He had to make things right. He’d had no idea what his brother was going through, Peter realized with a pang of guilt. He’d been angry at the universe, and instead of taking it out on the universe, he took it out on James. It was unfair of him, and now James was gone. He couldn’t leave things there. Peter wandered through the tunnel. He was sure he wouldn’t catch his brother, and he wasn’t sure where he should start
She hadn’t really thought she’d had a great grip on who she was before all this, but now she was really grasping at straws on that end.
. Logically, it shouldn’t have been able to do much of anything. But practically, it could do anything and everything. The power of existence, rather literally in the palm of one’s hand.
“I think that’s your sister’s job,” Torrun said, shaking her head. “No point in lecturing. You have the most tactical experience besides the avengers of 199999. We need you out there. I trust them as team members, but…”
“Well excuse me, princess,” he said, mocking. “Your golden chariot got stuck in traffic.” He glanced briefly at the Avengers, as if just noticing their presence. “I thought the Alts were supposed to leave yesterday.” Kate sighed dramatically.
. Peter rounded the tree, and just as he predicted, Natasha followed him—only to be hit in the head with a sticky arrow moments later.
“So the takeaway here is that the space stone is lost, and we don’t have any leads on where the hell it is,” Uncle Bucky said bluntly.
For the rest of the flight, the Senator pestered Natasha, which suited Steve just fine. She was much more adept at keeping people happy than he was, managing to laugh and smile and joke along with him, even if that smile never quite met her eyes. Upon arrival in New York City, there was another limo waiting for them.
of you?” Tony shouted. Her expression wasn’t right. Livid was certainly one way to describe it, but her eyes were too wide and her face was too pale.
, either here or back home. The science is too valuable to leave behind.” Everyone knew how fascinated Jane was with the scientific advances in this world. She and Tony had both not stopped geeking out over the bits and pieces that 3490 allowed them to access.
that, let alone how Tony would react?” Tony demanded. Tony was not spared the Commander’s rage despite his similarity to his wife.
James was the first to break. Peter could see him, out of the corner of his eye, furiously wiping at his eyes with his sleeve until Kate started passing him tissues. Kate, for her part, looked stoically up at the priest as the mass went on. Kate, Peter thought, would outlast him, outlast them all. She’d been born with vibranium nerves; she could steel herself better than anyone he knew.
“You would’ve—you would’ve done the same, right? With me or Kate or even Francis or Torrun,” Peter stated more than asked. Their father just nodded mutely.
“Good, then you know this is one of mom’s designs pre-Extremis. It has since been integrated but stripping that code isn’t too difficult. You’ll still have JARVIS as a co-pilot, though, I can’t root him out of there, and I wouldn’t even if I could,” Kate said. The encryption screens disappeared from the tablet, and Kate set it down. She removed the hardwires from the tablet and Mark 42. She tapped on the chest plate, and the armor opened up, allowing space for Tony to step inside. For a moment he hesitated. It was one thing, to step into an armor of his own design and go flying through the air—it was another thing entirely to rely on someone
“You’re too hard on him,” Steve heard on a regular basis. He could still see her now, standing before him with her arms crossed and her lips in a hard line that bordered on a frown.
Tony was not certain whether or not that was what she was actually going to do once she finally got to give him a piece of her mind. She felt quite indecisive on what, precisely, she wished to speak with Steve about. She only knew that they
Tony hadn’t known what she was going to say to Steve before he’d gotten there, but now it seemed that she couldn’t
“Oh, no,” Kate said. “Secret identities are created for a reason. Can’t have friends over, that would be a national security risk—there’s way too much sensitive info stored in this house. We’ve had parties before, though—Mom just always rents out a place; ball rooms, laser tag, under 21 club, Chuck-E-Cheese, whatever.”
“I would never design my armor with a flaw as fatal as the exhaust pipe on the Death Star, thank you very much,” he huffed.
“I didn’t find much,” Natasha admitted. “Something about Earth 616 spying on them—how they figured out the whole multiverse puzzle in the first place. Something about Earth 1610 coming for a visit—it didn’t sound particularly pleasant. There were a couple of other universes mentioned, nothing particularly noteworthy,
to talk. The radio silence was killing her. Not only was it killing her, but the kids felt it acutely. From what she understood, Steve
to the flag. Peter had to admire her fighting style, but, unfortunately for her, it was one with which Peter was familiar, having seen his aunt in action a thousand times over. His pre-cog effect probably wasn’t fair, and Peter felt a bit bad about that but he didn’t know how to turn that particular ability off—it just sort of happened. Peter jumped and grabbed a tree branch, swinging a two-legged kick at Natasha, but she slid right under him and ended up on his other side. He barely had enough time to turn and duck as she swung at him.
“Let’s head over,” Steve said. Tony could see that his jaw was set in a way that always meant he was pissed.
“—no, Francis, I’ve had it! I hate you! You’re just—you’re just leading me on, you know that? I can’t believe you, you must have been laughing it up, getting me to fall all over you—well
He felt the fire of a fight, and he felt like every piece of his being was wound tight, a string ready to be plucked and resonate beyond itself. He had experienced everything he had trained for, and unlike Peter, who had vomited in the bathroom when they got to the bunker and had, James knew, spoken with MCU Steve for a while afterward because of the guilt he felt at killing someone in the field, unlike Kate who was despondent and almost entirely unresponsive, unlike Francis who had found the alcohol and tried to drink Torrun under the table (a bad idea all around), James felt nothing. Unlike them all, he felt no guilt at the fight, no shock at the horrors he had seen and experienced. He had no regret about what he had done, and if it would solve problems, James would gladly go and do it again. Hell, even if it wouldn’t solve any problems he was tempted to go out and find an unfortunate target.
“Maybe,” Tony said, and they lapsed into silence. Tony ate his soup. Steve’s hand never moved from his shoulder.
Steve, of course, already knew what it was. He had offered to deliver the news, if she didn’t want to, but Tony felt like this was something that would sound better coming from her, the scientist, the engineer. She was still dressed in her business clothes—a white silk shirt, a dark navy coat, and a matching navy pencil skirt with killer high heels (shoes were, after all, a bit of a weakness of hers, one she shared with Pepper). Her hair was drawn up into a simple chignon, aside from one small curl near the side of her face that had refused to cooperate that morning. Still, even dressed to the nines Tony felt naked in front of these people. They stared at her so expectantly, and like they
Tony as well and it certainly wouldn’t be wrong—returned to their home, tired and sweaty but in good spirits. While they had disappeared—to shower, they claimed, though Pepper suspected that was only half the story and did not wish to know the whole one—another Pepper had waltzed through the doors of the mansion.
you know I’m tailing the four of you,” 3490 Clint said. “It’s procedure, precaution, call it what you will, you four are dangerous people. We know intimately just
“S-sorry,” Steve spluttered. “I uh, I thought—” The naked man on top of Tony was slowly starting to turn, not quite comprehending what was going on, too caught up in a haze of lust. Steve shut the door quickly before he could gain any more consciousness. Steve pressed a finger to his earpiece.
. Tony said that I made her think it was her fault, my leaving. I was an awful husband, an awful father, and now—there’s no taking it back. There was never any taking it back, but we could have worked through it. I could have made up for it. But instead Tony—“ Steve couldn’t continue. He couldn’t say
Tony Stark’s mind was in about six different places when her double took a seat next to her on the couch. For one thing, her mind was
and maliciously putting two explosive materials together to destroy the school’s chemistry lab! And not only that, there’s a world of difference between accidentally causing an explosion and
“You see that mall over there? Meet me at that entrance in five minutes with your team. Anybody not there gets left behind, you hear me? Kate and I are going to find the others,” James said.
“Oh. Well. I’m sure they’ll be glad to have you, darling. Let’s get you a glass—” Tony grabbed a glass off Kate. Steve suppressed a groan of frustration. It wasn’t that Tony didn’t know what Camp Dwyer was—it was just her reaction that bothered Steve.
“Well, Captain,” he said dryly, “my heart’s all a-flutter. I didn’t even think you liked me.” Steve chuckled.
Steve recovered from his wound with a speed that would have been astonishing had he not been used to it. After just two weeks he was back on the job, guarding the elevator door inside of Tony’s lab. He was still a bit sore, but it was nothing Special Agent Rogers couldn’t handle. He watched Tony fiddle around with some holographic modeling of something that looked like a mechanical arm for a bit in silence, as per usual, when to his own surprise he found himself speaking.
