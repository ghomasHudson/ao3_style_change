That need in him tightened so sharply that it snapped, flooding his entire body with an immediate, overwhelming release. His arms just fell from under him as he came hard over his own chest, leaving a thick streak over the pillows in front of him – too dazed to wonder why he hadn’t fallen flat on his face. He wasn’t aware of anything but that relief rolling through him, his hips jerking back mindlessly as he tried to ride through this sensation.
And the cold sadness of realising Tony wouldn’t be there… that everything was wrong and anxious still, that Tony wasn’t his… even though he was…
, what he’d really meant was that he didn’t expect it to mean anything to Steve. Tony had – rather sensibly – warned himself, before he did this, that Steve would not react the way he did in Tony fantasies. In fact, part of the reason Tony felt so confident in doing it was that, at the start, he’d been completely sure that Steve would just shrug it off. That he wasn’t actually asking anything more of Steve than a few moments indulgence, to just sit there and listen to a diatribe he didn’t agree with or care about, because it might make Tony feel better.
“Well, finding a Hydra base might not be as simple as you’d think,” he observed, pulling himself back to the task in hand. “I spent eighteen months looking, with Sam, and Nat, and we never came up with anything… Although, now that you mention them having a totally separate system...That makes a lot more sense…”
Still, Steve was aware that this was important, enough that he was trying to sober himself up even before Bucky spoke-
“What, you didn’t trust him?” Bucky suggested. “You thought he’d rat you out or do something stupid-”
be just fine without him – that this whole obsession was a symptom of the very problem he had to fix? Should he stick with his tried and tested mantra, that this was how it had to be and how it would always be and there was no point getting upset about it?
“It’s nice.” Steve smiled politely, putting the empty glass down with the others. And the man looked at Steve for a second too long before he smiled back.
, and it was more than beautiful. It was everything that Steve loved about him. It was every warm memory they’d shared. It was everything Steve had been searching for, since long before he went into the ice-
He was sort of upset that he’d broken one of the jars, simply because Steve had liked them. Because they were one of the things Steve had noticed, the night of their date… Part of one of the very few pleasant memories that Tony had.
don’t have any right to expect that… which did make me think, you must’ve – that maybe you thought the same… And, I just thought…” and he pinched his lips, and dropped his eyes. “I don’t know if you
“I don’t mean that,” Stape groaned. “I just mean that, you know, compassion is a choice of the strong, and all that – I
But Tony knew why he wasn’t doing that just yet. There wasn’t much of this he was sure about, but he understood exactly which part of this he had to do on his own… And why.
...Not after he’d just spent three days torturing himself over whether he’d inadvertently hurt Tony already.
“Come, I’ll introduce you to the festival directors - they should be able to give you more of the details,” he suggested, pointing back toward the door he’d entered through. A prickle of anxiety ran up Tony’s spine, a physical resistance gathering between his shoulders…
“You won’t, you can’t,” Tony assured him, his fingers trembling lightly as he found the concealed fastening at the front of Steve’s uniform and slid his hand inside, gripping Steve’s cock and pulling it free. Steve keened hopelessly, jerking hard against him.
On the plus side, it seemed increasingly likely that he would literally die of shame before too long…
And then the door opened, and there was Steve - smiling at Tony as though he’d been waiting all his life to see him…
And then a more thoughtful expression came over his features, his gaze focusing on Steve’s face. And Steve was just about to worry that he’d said something wrong… when Tony smiled.
incredible, you always look beautiful,” Tony replied, entirely seriously, dropping his head to nip at Steve’s earlobe… and then kiss that sensitive spot at the back of his ear, very softly… Steve shivered, tugging at Tony’s hair as he began to work his way down the column of Steve’s throat-
promised himself that he’d give it at least one night… He wasn’t really sure why. A vague hangover from his fears of being too needy, or breaking ‘the rules’, or something…
like he really didn’t have to be Captain America – he literally felt the shift in his body, as he put down the last of that burden.
“Uh, these are a new species of Teo Torriatte,” she smiled. “I don’t know how much we know about Torriatte flowers?”
But his brain was momentarily stuck on the idea that he and Steve were essentially being dosed with a truth serum – or a speech serum, at least, because Tony still wasn’t convinced that any of what he’d said
He wanted Tony now as basically and as desperately as he’d ever wanted anything. He wasn’t even thinking of what he wanted to do
true. If he’d stopped to think about it for longer, he’d have remembered all the other things that scared him –
Tony broke the kiss and raised his arms to loop them around Steve’s neck, resting his forehead against Steve’s.
Steve groaned out loud at himself, clenching his fists hard at his sides. And then he forced himself to walk over and snatch another punching bag up from the stockpile -
thought about that. “...But that’s a mission all on its own. And… I don’t know, we might want more back up for that one…”
Pepper had always been better at getting information out of him than Rhodey was – probably because she rarely outright asked him to talk about things. She was always sneakier than that. She gathered her information indirectly and subtly, with seemingly unrelated enquires and little, innocent sounding questions when he was only half listening… Tony knew she had collected all sorts of details about Steve over the course of the last few weeks, despite his best intentions.
“Okay, that’s it. I’m going to bed,” he snapped out loud, standing up and slamming his hands down on the desk to punctate his point.
“He’s Captain America,” Rhodey reminded him, in the same deadpan tone. “He’s literally the anti-Hitler”
And Tony’s first thought was that, okay, he’s thought of something. Apparently, at some point, Tony had done something with a Post It that had pissed Steve off, and he’d just thought of it. He even scrabbled to think of what Steve was talking about – but then Steve went on.
want to be special to Tony, that he wanted to be the one to help him – that he wanted Tony to know. That he wanted Tony to like him.
He’d tried going to bed - in what was actually a very comfortable bed, in a very comfortable little house, with a lovely view of Malibu beach. Steve had felt at home here from the moment he walked through the door, despite the generic furnishing and magnolia paint that was obligatory for any corporate property… Still, somehow, it felt relaxed and lived in and...safe. Perhaps it was just that he happened to like small houses with a view of the sea, or because he preferred unshowy comfort to eye-catching design. Maybe it was just because he knew this was Tony’s house, and Tony had let him stay here… But Steve distinctly remembered thinking that, at any other time, he’d probably get a better night’s sleep here than he had in years…
But that really wasn’t the same as having an issue with anything that was going on in this place. And, if he’d been here with Sam or Nat or… literally
“Oh, we used to do this all the time in the forties,” came out straighter that Steve had intended, purely because he was nervous – but that only seemed to make Tony laugh more.
And the worst part of it all was that few minutes in the middle. That strange time when they both absolutely
And, when he got through this time, maybe he could think about it, and work through it, and maybe next time it would be
“... So, is Steve as stoned as you are?” He asked, trying to sound casual about it without really knowing why.
“Okay, I just… To be honest, I need to drink, and I’d really rather not do it when you’re here,” he tried… and watched her consider that carefully…
Well, it wasn’t a bad idea. It even helped to calm his thoughts a little, while he focused on the individual tasks of finding a towel, and setting the water to the right temperature, and undressing…
And suddenly that smell was so strong, like it was coating his tongue, like he could already taste it-
“Still not used to that?” Tony enquired, with a playful edge on his voice that struck Steve as somewhat hopeful-
Tony ran a hand through Steve’s hair, bidding him to lie close again, immediately soothed by the weight of Steve against his body.
Steve to be a thing of his past, he didn’t want to accept that there were no more chapters to this story...
Steve glanced up at him, his forehead pitched in a little frown as he repeated Tony’s sentence to himself. It was late, probably close to midnight, and he and Tony had spent the last few hours sitting on the floor of his living room, a spray of scrawled notes in the space between them, working through the specifics of the virus that Tony was programming-
But, when he lurched forward, attempting to beat Adam to it – Adam didn’t go for the phone. He threw himself forward and went for
Breathless and elated and thrumming with harmless adrenaline, Steve kicked his way to the surface - finding it was far more difficult than he’d originally thought. By the time he’d finally managed to huff and wriggle his way into an upright position, Tony had simmered down into a warm, musical giggle that seemed to vibrate through the sea of plastic and right into the centre of Steve’s chest.
It was a beautiful night, soft and warm and calm… Tony seemed to have a knack for reading these events, always able to steer Steve away from crowds before they formed and avoid awkward situations before they happened. He seemed to have picked the perfect time to leave, while the main steps were deserted save for a few loitering smokers, and the driveway was quiet…
“What?” Steve demanded, far more sharply than he intended - regretting it as soon as he saw Tony blink in surprise.
in the world have a feel for food, they can tell if ingredients are fresh from the feel of them, and they judge sauce from the exact hue of red and the texture when they stir it… Cooks are the ones who add a dash of this and a pinch of that according to taste. Like painters and musicians. I mean, there probably
“When I first came here, I was hoping to find new drugs. New ways to make myself rich. I told everyone I was going to expand human knowledge and push the limits of science and bring back things that would make the world a better place… and I suppose they all knew it was a code, for wanting to pad my own legacy and stroke my own ego… but they accepted this, all of this, because we all think that’s what happiness
Somewhere, he was already facing the temptation to throw all of his careful planning to the wind - to just break into wherever Bucky was, and slaughter anyone who stood in between them.
And then he remembered the way Steve’s eyes had widened. The hot flash of fear, in the second Tony snatched his wrist… The way it darkened into something else, as his gaze fell on Tony’s fingers.
easy, this is the bit I have always been sorry for. I am so sorry I hurt you. That’s not just an item on a debrief, that’s…
And just that was enough to make his toes curl – in an oddly familiar, almost nostalgic way, actually. God, it’d been
Another part of Steve was so impressed by Tony’s control in this situation, by how considerate and careful he was being – when part of Steve loved Tony so much, for every part of this.
The unfathomable concept of Steve living for hundreds of years, resigning himself to fleeting relationships with human beings… The idea that Tony was just the first of many people that might provide some brief comfort in a life so much bigger than his own…
“Well, give me a couple of hours snooping, probably quite a lot.” Tony considered. “There’s a hell of a lot of research data, that would probably tell us something…”
And Tony just let himself kiss Steve - as greedily and as shamelessly as he always wanted to, his hands grabbing more roughly at the curves of Steve’s body.
And then Tony positioned himself between Steve’s legs, and placed his hands firmly against Steve’s knees, and very pointedly paused for a moment. Steve came to a taut, trembling stop, as Tony ran his eyes over his body.
Steve spoke so naturally; it took Tony a second to recognise that it wasn’t an answer to his question.
it’s going to take weeks. So, no, I’m not done with this yet. Unless you can think of any way for me to weasel out of it?” He glanced back at Rhodey, hopefully.
Tony grinned again and shook his head, before stepping forward to fall in line with Steve, so that they could leave side by side.
“If we go through the side exit” Steve gestured vaguely to a door on the right, “There’s that corridor with the dead end, around a corner.”
So, either these documents had been lost over the course of the last seventy years… or else they were so confidential that Nick Fury couldn’t find them.
“Just – go and do your job, Tony,” Steve huffed, throwing the ball aside petulantly as he strode past Tony, and out the door.
The initial sensation was so intense, it was neither pleasure nor pain. It was a blinding, cleansing shock that shot right through to the bottom of his feet-
still be sitting on the end of his bed… and that it was all much of a muchness to him. That it didn’t matter whether he was here or at home, and he didn’t care what happened next.
Having already accepted that it was okay to use his spare Pym Particles for personal trips, it was easy enough to decide it was time to take another one.
After all these weeks of reminding himself not to take it out on Bucky, not to seem jealous of Bucky, not to give anyone any ammunition with regards to Bucky… Apparently, overcompensating had become second nature.
“We work in a number of areas – but we’re not interested in world domination, or mass murder, or any of the plots you usually work against.”
He tried to take a steadying breath… But it was like he could actually smell the damp concrete of that bunker, like he could feel that slightly acidic frost clawing at the back of his throat-
to talk to Steve – and acted on it. He’d come striding out of the bedroom, his mind already racing ahead to all the things he had to explain and undo and apologise for-
Of course, Tony’s head didn’t stay quiet for long enough for him to make it to his bedroom. By the time he collapsed onto his mattress the endless cycle of worries had started up again – and engaged in active combat with the exhaustion that was beginning to overwhelm him.
But now, having contemplated every possible approach to Soviet military history and quasi-organic biology and complex neurological theory, Tony was forced to conclude that he had run out of diversions. There was nothing left to distract him from the aching fatigue in his back or the dull pounding of his head…
“Oh, about three months” Possibly-Trish answered “But we’re not going to be like the people who end up staying here for
Tony felt his stomach drop. He realised, belatedly, that the solution he was merrily putting together would actually take a lot of work… Work that only he could do. Immediately, he panicked that he was just walking himself further into something that he was desperate to get out of. And then – much more unnerving – was the first stirring of an idea… that maybe he
any guards… But he got the distinct impression that there were more of them gathered at the back of the building.
...He’d never point out that Steve’s little daytime blush was actually very cute on him. Not even in jest.
to my plans, the key to everything. Not a drug made by Varians, or used by Varians, but made by me from Varian resources and Varian principles. A true collaboration of both worlds – and
And then the door clicked softly, and swung open, snapping both Steve and Bucky to straight-backed attention. A tall, shaggy-haired silhouette appeared, his features melting into detail as he walked slowly towards them.
He actually giggled at himself, as the heat flushed his face and the butterflies dive bombed the bottom of his gut-
So, powered by a blinding stab of pure adrenaline, Tony scrambled after the instinct to get the hell out of this situation before something much worse happened.
And in those hot, painful moments, when Steve was so overcome with physical need that he couldn’t think straight – and he knew that Bucky wouldn’t ask any questions.
But that whole… side of things, felt like something Steve wanted to keep for himself. Something he couldn’t explain properly, and therefore didn’t want to be out there at all.
“Honestly? I didn’t really make a pitch for Barnes,” she confessed. “I made a pitch for Steve Rogers.”
“Yours,” he promised, because it was all he could manage before his voice was swallowed up by the emotion.
Tony asked a few general questions about Steve’s week, and the team, and how Bucky’s arm was healing, as he walked them up to the kitchen on the second floor. It wasn’t until they got there that Steve realised how little of Tony’s house he’d actually seen. That there was something especially intimate about being allowed into Tony’s kitchen… maybe even more so than the bedroom. Even though, from the looks of it, Tony didn’t use it much, this still felt like a part of his day-to-day life, his
By the time Steve had made the journey from New York the sun was setting over the ocean, the brightest stars lying on the horizon like a decorative glitter. The deep red of the darkening sky was reflected on the water, the dying sunlight catching on the waves like a gold trim - which struck Steve as especially poignant. Exactly as he would have painted it.
He heard the crash of the doors being thrown open, out there in the corridor. The sound of angry footsteps.
“No, nothing like that!” The man assured him, with a warm laugh. “I’m one of the hosts here at The Facility. I try to keep track of the new arrivals – we don’t get all that many, each week. I’m Dev, by the way.” And he offered his hand to Steve.
“Okay. Good.” He murmured. And then he looked up again, and he was back to the same casual, co-worker smile. “Come on then,” He breezed. “Let’s go and get you drunk”
And, somewhere it occurred to him – he wasn’t consumed by all the things he wished he’d done differently, anymore. Which wasn’t to say there weren’t certain choices he’d make differently, or individual things he wished he could take back… But his past didn’t haunt him, the way it had before. The spectre of the life he didn’t lead didn’t unsettle him anymore.

Steve glanced up and saw that their audience thought nothing of his sudden burst of enthusiasm – which both surprised him, and didn’t surprise him, at the same time. He
“That I didn’t see how that was relevant to the incident in New Mexico, and that’s what we were really there to talk about,” Steve shrugged. “Which is the sort of thing they’ll let you get away with, when you’re wearing the uniform. But, then again, when you’re wearing the uniform, you
, this… stoic thing that you do - you’re not protecting anyone's feelings by pretending that feelings don’t exist!”
Whatever the reason, Tony couldn’t help but see that as ridiculous, now. Assuming Steve Rogers was telling the truth - and, for whatever reason, Tony simply assumed he was - then he was in an impossible position.
. “From the inside, it was so confusing – I saw this man I knew so well, and loved so much and who would never be so callous, who hated to lie, who didn’t judge and welcomed everyone and had the same pompous,

want from Tony. As far as Steve knew, he’d always been a team mate to Tony. Not a friend like Rhodey was a friend, or Happy, or Pepper. He hoped he’d eventually become someone Tony liked well enough. Someone he’d be nice to – mostly, because he was nice. Someone he would die to protect… because Tony Stark would die to protect a total stranger. Someone who, unbeknownst to Tony, watched longingly from the back of the room while he worked, sometimes…

, even then. It was an inherently dismissive, subtly mocking word. Uniquely capable of reducing the most cutting and personal of feelings to a punchline for someone else’s joke. A ready-made excuse for anyone he asked to consider his feelings or listen to his point of view. He wanted to rebel against that word, even now. Even when
In fact, as he was trying to remember the details of Tony’s inglorious introduction to SHIELD, Steve realised that he’d never even asked about it. That all he had to go on were the few acerbic comments that Tony had made, right at the beginning of the Avengers initiative, most of which Steve had rolled his eyes at…
And then he found himself thinking of the name for that tender pulsing, all over his skin. Recognising that soreness, that fragility in his bones. That warm, deep contentment, that genuine, bodily comfort…
Tony took another step closer – and Steve actually backed away. He saw Tony’s eyes widen as he settled back into his feet, obviously recognising that Steve
And then she glanced up at him, her eyes meeting his for just a second. He looked away; a basic social reflex to being caught staring. And then, more subtly, he glanced over in her general direction again-

he liked Steve so much. He wasn’t sure what he was hoping would happen, the next time they met. He couldn’t think of one actual reason it was a good idea to see him again. But, apparently, the answers to those questions didn’t really matter. Tony wanted to see him again anyway.
“Yeah, Sam, lots of times - when I first woke up in the 21st Century, and a nurse told me I was in a recovery room in New York, it never
he regrets signing them – now, he agrees it’s better to break them, and save the world. Now the people who tell Ross to fuck himself
And then Tony’s hands were on his arms, so quickly. Steve… didn’t know what had happened, or how, there was just this…movement, and then he was looking at his own wrist – the cuff locked tight around it.
“Oh, God, more, please,” Tony moaned, trying to rock back. Steve pushed a third finger into him and twisted his hand, waiting until Tony had whimpered through it before he began thrusting into him, slow and hard.
It was an instinct too ingrained to be overwhelmed by even his current mood, something he’d been trained to spot and sidestep since childhood. Something he understood long before he found the words for it-
Saying that out loud felt like ripping a rotten tooth out of his skull. For the time being, he didn’t care how much pain it had caused or even if it had done more harm than good in the long run - he was just overwhelmed with relief that it was over with.
But now that the emblem of all Tony’s disappointment and bitterness had actually turned up, a real person with actual feelings and an unnervingly earnest smile… To say that he
As his vision slowly cleared, he began to recognise individual elements of his surroundings. Exposed pipework and strip lighting… no windows… concrete walls…
But that had started to sound more and more ridiculous, as his initial high had eased into that familiar desire to be around Tony - which wasn’t even one of those new, physical impulses. This time, it was just because he liked being in Tony’s company. Because Tony had always been the welcome distraction, the thing to look forward to, the thing that mattered… Because Steve already missed him.
Rhodey had stayed until he woke up again, just like Tony knew he would. And Rhodey had poured more coffee, and made another careful attempt to get Tony to talk about it… and accepted it, kindly, when Tony realised he really didn’t want to, yet. By then, Tony had started to feel the pressure of all those issues to be dealt with, along with a nagging anxiety that he should have been dealing with it earlier. He had a lot of things to think through for himself, properly, before he could share them with anyone else.
Tony looked down at the dense mass of brightly coloured sequins in his hands, somewhere between disbelief and resignation. When he glanced up at the others, he could see them all thinking the same thing,
“Oh God, Tony,” Steve breathed, pulling his hand away from him – grabbing hold of Tony and throwing him onto his back again, before Tony could whine about the loss of contact.
Yeah, fair enough, I’m mad at the world for that – but that includes you, with your dirty looks whenever I mention an arms dealer I’ve heard of, or you telling me that I’m tearing the Avengers apart
Tony still had the nagging guilt that he’d been arguing with all week - the cold awareness that Steve was just sitting there, all alone, with no way to know if Tony was ever coming back-
Tony hadn’t quite put it together yet, but he was already thinking about the fact that SHIELD were looking for Steve, that they’d already connected Steve to him… That his relationship with Steve was the key difference between this timeline and the one they’d deviated from…
Every mission comes in difference phases. They both knew this. And, without having to say a word, they both knew they were about to start a different stage of this thing.
Steve let go of a heavy sigh. He was immediately resistant to the idea of playing along with this - not only because they could be walking into a trap, but because Steve hated the idea of endorsing this ridiculous, self-important behaviour-
There was no conflict or confusion between Tony’s mental processes anymore. No clash between his panic reaction and his conscious intention, no time wasted on choosing a priority, no difficulty thinking about several things at once. It made his own mind feel strangely distant from him, as though he’d just been programmed to get to Steve as efficiently as possible, and now he was just watching it run…
“It’s okay, it’s not your fault,” Tony sighed. “I don’t think anyone is in their right mind, right now.”
What burned brightest, as Coulson casually let himself into Tony’s home, was a sense of the unfairness in this - how obvious the parallels were, and how blindingly irritating it was that no one else saw them.
to understand that – he certainly didn’t want to pressure Tony, or make this all about himself, while Tony had so much personal stuff to work through. Steve wanted to help with that, not be an additional burden.
to fuck this up for everybody, when he could choose not to. As complicated and compromised as it was… it was also as simple as that.
So, begrudgingly, Steve had hidden himself in the shadows and watched as two former versions of himself traded blows and wisecracks…
Even if the fabric of time had already written out his formative moments… There seemed no good reason not to make
Steve could picture the shy smile tugging at his lips, the casual way he averted his eyes when he was doing something as brave or personal as offering advice. The almost imperceptible shrug that would’ve looked awkward on anyone else, but seemed so natural, almost charismatic, coming from him.
what other issues there were. There weren’t other issues. Tony had forgotten the concept of issues. Everything had been boiled down to how good this felt and how physically he needed it and how perfectly obvious it was that he was supposed to do this.
As he and Tony had discovered on their subsequent trips to the planet – there was a reason Anni Vara had been chosen as the site of The Facility. Yes, the owners of The Facility had warped the Varians culture, and commercialised it, and amended it for the tastes of their human clients… But it was obvious which parts of it had interested them in the first place.

…Steve had always known that faithfulness was simply an expression of one type of love. Not the only type of love, not the type that was best for everyone… But the type Steve wanted. And Steve had always known that, for it to have any value
“So… Lots of things happened last night…” Tony heard himself saying, most of his attention still focused on the inside of his own head. “And… Now I’m not sure if everything just changed… or if, maybe everything is exactly like I thought it was, really, and all that’s happened is that I’ve just fucked everything up…”
unsubtly to a woman at a nearby table, who was wearing a silver fishnet minidress and a bright red thong.
Maybe it was just that he was tired. An uncharacteristically sluggish mental calculation told him that he’d probably had about three hours sleep in the last two days - and he must’ve walked at least twenty miles that afternoon in laps around the workshop. Maybe he just wasn’t awake enough to muster that overwhelming, existential dread anymore.
into a situation that dangerous… and the prospect of losing him all over again, on that exact same spot…
And then, as he approached the crowd at the bar, Tony’s attention was snagged by a familiar voice, shouting over the top of the general commotion.
. At least… it had stopped him being blinded by hurt for long enough to be a bit more rational, allowed him to take back the anger that shouldn’t have been there in the first place. It had helped him see things the way he always should have – which was that yeah, Steve had made mistakes and owed him an explanation and it was right that he dealt with the anger that he’d
There were a handful of moments in Tony’s life that he knew he’d remember forever. Moments that defined a place and a time and a feeling, moments that perfectly symbolised an idea bigger than themselves...

Tony considered him for a moment. He would’ve liked to wonder what Steve had told the others about this little errand – but he didn’t want to acknowledge that he cared.

“...Okay, well, imagine that Laura, or one of the kids, accidentally stumbled across a secret of national importance,” Steve began calmly - deliberately ignoring the way Clint flinched when he mentioned his family. “And, of course, you had to take that to your bosses - when they asked you to tell them how you knew, you’d have to say you couldn’t, wouldn’t you?”
As he was talking, Steve was picking the frame up. Looking at a photograph of Tony with his arm around an admittedly very tired looking Rhodey, in full dress uniform. Tony, smiling brightly at the camera, his chest puffed up in pride. Rhodey, looking up at Tony, a wry affection in his eyes. Rhodey definitely looked younger in it… Steve couldn’t tell if Tony did. It just looked so much like Tony – an especially nice picture of Tony, actually.
Until he felt Tony press hit his prostate, sparking such a visceral, panicked need for more that it somehow dragged the words up through his throat,
as a colleague. He was angry because Steve had been unnecessarily reckless, because he didn’t have to do
“We have some tests to be getting on with,” Stape replied formally, gesturing towards the shadows at the back of the room.
And Steve knew this meant he should stop, at least for a moment. That was a basic mission protocol, hardwired since his army days – if something doesn’t feel right, you have to check it out. If you have the opportunity to pause and reassess the situation, you should. That’s how you avoid ambushes and traps and moments of madness…
In truth, Steve couldn’t muster more than an excited nervousness about the whole thing. He was already picturing Tony’s smile as he came to a polite stop at the glass partition, and raised his head to say hello to JARVIS-

Unlike other sedatives, which just have a blanket effect, this one will reduce your physical capabilities without making you equally drowsy, uncoordinated or confused.”
“You got anything in bottles? You know, so I don’t end up wearing most of it…” Tony replied, amiably-
The endless, unbearable pain it would’ve caused if they’d managed to hit him, all the hope and joy they would’ve stolen in an instant - and they didn’t even

in Nat - like he was watching the same woman who’d given her life for the universe behaving like any other amoral SHIELD pawn.
don’t have to be scared of me,” Steve blurted it out, taking himself by surprise - realising as he said it that it was the thing he dreaded most.
The world faded out of focus for… a time, as Steve forgot that it existed. He didn’t notice if Rhodey had wandered away from him, or if he’d wandered away from Rhodey.
He mocked himself in a silly, frivolous voice, “I don’t know, in hindsight that seems kinda… tone deaf, and insensitive….”
on the people here.” She stuttered back. “I mean, we run experiments, as well, on volunteers and animals and tissue samples and things – but, this place, I mean, we just collect data on what people are doing anyway. We don’t tell
like that. He felt like Steve’s plan was to just wait until Tony had gotten over his temper, to try and make him smile about other things so that he’d forget his little tantrum, to wait for it to get better with time… And Tony just couldn’t stand the idea of that working. He knew it was immature and stupid and probably hurting him more than anyone – but, right now, he’d still rather that than let Steve think he’d ‘won him over’. He just couldn’t deal with the idea of Steve smiling at him one day,
“Oh, God, yes, Tony,” Steve stammered, his fingers curling into Tony’s hair as Tony moved down over his chest-
“Steve,” Tony growled against Steve’s skin. A thousand sparks of searing heat trembled through him, that now-faded bite wound still sensitive-
And he looked them up and down, slowly, in a way that was entirely nonsexual but still triggered the same visceral discomfort…
Even when Tony dropped his head to pepper soft kisses along his neck, his hands still stroking gently over Steve’s skin. Steve groaned, and bucked his hips, and
could never unknow these inhuman ideas, or stop these relentless questions. He could never be young again. He could never have his first kiss again, or wonder what it was like to be tall, or feel the rush of shocked attraction that came with seeing Tony for the very first time.
“No, actually I’m sorry,” Steve pushed on, deliberately dropping his eyes so that he wouldn’t see Tony’s attempts to argue with him. “I shouldn’t have yelled at you like that, I…”
He changed into his old uniform as quickly as he’d ever suited up in his life, again wishing that he could’ve gotten away with wearing it into work that morning - but even his bosses would’ve noticed if he’d been wearing a kevlar body-suit under his shirt. Then he stuffed his security guards uniform into the same bag, and hid it away at the bottom of a box of liquid antibiotics. He figured there wasn’t much chance of anyone finding it before he had the chance to come back for it, but even if they did, it wouldn’t lead back to Steve in any way.
And yes, that included a very detailed recap of the time they’d spend in bed together… and in his workshop… and in various other places, including the couch in the breakroom…
Maybe he would have the space to see that the whole thing was a disaster, an impossibility – that he’d seriously dodged a bullet by getting out when he did.
Tony snorted a laugh, and made a mental note to tease him back for that, just as soon as he was able to form sentences again - but, really, he already knew.
Steve made sure to stay in character, jumping to nervous attention and appearing generally put out by the intrusion. He allowed himself to gape as four men in black wheeled a covered gurney to the back of the room, trailed by three men in suits - who were already in the middle of a heated discussion.
And in the most basic calculation Steve had ever done in his life, he worked out that it was probably better to try to prepare Tony than himself, that he’d fucked Tony a few hours ago and that might help, that…
Taking a gentle stroll on his way to replacing the Tesseract hardly felt like a symbolic act of defiance, or a moment of personal reinvention. If anything, Steve just felt awkward and slightly embarrassed to be having such difficulty with so small a step - for being too confused and too nervous to do more with this enlightenment, even now that he knew he could.
“These cameras all out of action?” Steve muttered, as Tony found the right security code on his file reader, and typed it onto the keypad.
“Does it include any details on the drugs here?” Sam asked abruptly, “Or the food and the drinks and whatever? What they are, what they do, anything like that?”
“The thing is, before the airport, I really didn’t take any of it personally. I thought everything was just turning to shit” Tony heard himself explaining – probably more curious to find out what he meant than Steve was. “I thought Wanda didn’t agree with the detainment and Clint was there because he feels a debt to Wanda, and you were doing it out of loyalty to Bucky and Sam was doing it out of loyalty to you – shit culmination of issues, but what can you do. And then I get to Germany, and you just casually drop it on me that,
, I think, is the Varian drug” And he pointed to a strange collection of symbols at the top of the page. All of them human, but almost comically out of place – like there were sections of the research written in Wingdings. “And, this is how they’ve adapted it for this particular test – I
Out of nowhere, Tony found himself panting for breath, trembling through that horrible misplaced shock that lingers when you
And Steve carried on kissing him as his hands came to the front of Tony’s shirt, unfastening the buttons with fast, fluid fingers. His movements were more confident as he swept his palms up over the bare skin of Tony’s back, and then over his shoulders, pushing his shirt back over his arms. Hands prickling with excitement, Tony unfastened Steve’s jeans, tugging them down over his hips as he pushed him backwards, encouraging Steve to step out of them and fall onto the bed.
wanted to make a better life for us, and for everyone really. And he knew that if those troops reported back what they’d found and – it was a split-second call. He had to decide whether to let them take everything from him, or use the only weapon he
world had insisted on – he remembered wondering whether most of these things needed social rules at all. Whether a lot of so-called
“Huh,” just sort of fell out of Steve’s mouth. And then he had to stop himself and swallow hard, suddenly worried he’d tear up.
“We’ve been looking for you.” Steve spoke softly, his face still turned towards Tony – playing along with her game, for the time being.
“Oh, he’s here somewhere,” Rhodey assured, gesturing out towards the crowd. “He’s with Pepper and Nat.”
He did feel confident that Tony was happy right now, that he’d liked the food and that he liked being with Steve.
Tony bit his bottom lip, forcing a third finger inside, trying in vain to create that same friction. The little ripples of sensation dissolved into a maddening, frustrating need far too quickly, teasing the impulse he was trying to sate. His whole body twitched as he recalled the sound of Steve panting, the solid power of his muscles tensing under Tony’s hand, the rush of pleasure that bordered on pain – the dizzying incomprehension that anything could feel that good.
chance to find that love again. And whatever you want to do with that information, whatever happens after this, I’ll get to live in a world where you exist. A world where you won’t die in 2023. And that will always be better than a world without you in it. So. Here I am.”
thought I’d have to convince you that I cared about you. And I know that sounds so stupid, after that list of all the things I did, but I just… didn’t think you’d even wonder about that, I didn’t. And God, the idea that it’s actually your

“Oh, right, let him in then,” Tony answered on autopilot, still trying to get his bearings. He was briefly confused, thinking that Rhodey was supposed to be in Europe – but then he worked out that, obviously, that was hours ago. “What time is it?”
“Oh my God,” he breathed, a dreamy smile washing over his features. Steve grinned, and dropped his head to kiss Tony’s neck, his lips so hot against Tony’s skin. Tony felt a giggle bubble up through his chest, a joyful, playful feeling welling up behind it.
upset me, by telling me. You can’t start feeling responsible for everyone’s reactions to everything you say…” And Tony could sort of see Steve talking a step back into his head as he was speaking, drifting into a deeper meaning as he carried on, “you can’t start feeling responsible for the hurt people experience as a consequence of their own actions. Especially if the only answer is to take that hurt on yourself…” And then, just as Tony was about to interrupt with a quip about an unrequested therapy session, Steve seemed to snap himself back to the point. He gave his head a little shake, and flashed a self-conscious smile before he finished, “
Tony smiled. Simply at how honest a reaction it was, how human. He thought he preferred it to the measured responses of before.
“Okay, but, Steve,” Bucky started, gesturing at his food with his fork, “this actually tastes like sunshine-”
But this really wasn’t funny. This was awful for so many reasons. Just being alone with Steve was awful, these days. Tense, and painful, and burdened with a thousand unspoken words…
And that sense of clarity carried on growing and expanding, far beyond its own parameters. The realisation of who he really was, and how he would naturally respond, and how he really saw things, suddenly helped him to see things beyond himself.
Tony felt an immediate, disorienting lift inside him, a sudden rush of nervous excitement and self-conscious joy.
year, we’ve got something we can deal with,” he promised. “And yeah, I know there’s still a lot, but we’ll work it out.”
Like this strange flavour of innocent optimism that somehow managed to maintain in spite of everything-
“Could say the same to you.” Nat observed, a smile hidden somewhere in her voice. “You working late?”
Tony crawled over him, so that he could kiss those lips again… and then his cheek, and then his jaw. He heard Steve’s breath catch, as he pressed a long, slow kiss to his throat. Tony could feel Steve’s blood rush to the surface, his own mouth watering in an immediate reaction to the heat of it-
An electric thrill shot through Steve’s weakened limbs, leave a deep, pulsing heat in its wake. Steve gasped softly, subconsciously leaning into Tony’s touch. Tony smiled, indulgently.
tell me how glad you am I’ve got a compound to ‘rattle around’ in. Now tell me about your faith in people who haven’t let you down. Now tell me you’re sorry that your best laid plan’s hurt my feelings, that you hope I understand-”
The team of agents on the other side froze in unison, like a crowd of animals trapped in headlights. Steve tilted his chin up and straightened his back as he walked confidently between them, a hot surge of power pulsing through his veins. The room was completely silent, save for the dull thud of Steve’s footsteps echoing off of the walls-
“What happened is that someone else used your body to do bad things. That’s the only reason you feel like you remember them,” the man goes on. “And I know that’s a… big idea to get your head around, and you don’t have to figure it all out right now - but just so you know, none of this is your fault, none of it was you, you didn’t do anything wrong.”
Or he could look into some of the educational programmes that Morita founded in his retirement, see what they developed into, if they had produced any famous alumni or groundbreaking new discoveries…
He knew it wasn’t something terrible he’d forgotten, or a subconscious sign that the world was in danger. He knew he wasn’t teetering on the edge of a nervous breakdown.
let his mind wander entirely freely, with no need of chemical encouragement, without fear for what might be lurking in the dark.
Tony felt Steve’s thighs tense up against him, rocking up in shorter and sharper motions as Tony kissed him deeper.
you disagree. Do something other than stand next to them with your hands on your belt looking sombre. Cos if you don’t want to do anything to distance yourself from any of that, then I am annoyed at you for that too.”
sorry that I didn’t call you, as soon as Vienna happened. Yeah, there were probably a lot of things I was trying to weigh up in all that… but I was swayed far too much by what I wanted to happen, or
made mistakes like the mistake Steve had made – secretly building fifty suits behind Peppers back for months wasn’t ‘one mistake’, either…
...What about in a thousand years? Would Steve even remember him? Would those forty years of slow decline seem significant to him, by then?
And then there was the vaguest shuffle beside him, as a Varian couple walked by their couch on the way back into the hall – a little snippet of their conversation floating through the air as they passed.
Eventually, Steve’s body fell apart beneath him, every ounce of tension leaving him in one euphoric rush. Tony let Steve’s cock slide free of his mouth, sitting up as Steve collapsed back against the sun lounger. For a moment, everything was just one heady swirl of senses. Every inch of him was flooded through with that sensation, his limbs lost in an onslaught of feeling, his vision blotted with stars…
He just wanted to lie here and let Tony do whatever he wanted to him, use him again and again until he’d had his fill, love Steve as nakedly and as selfishly as he wanted to-
“And you’re right, I was still so unsure when that happened, and I did it anyway, because it was happening then… and I didn’t… I couldn’t
, he hadn’t just called Steve because was about as horny as he’d ever been in his life right now. He wasn’t inviting Steve over for
“The Guardians are dealing with the Mallamens, and their staff” Rhodey short-handed “I think we might have to leave them here for a few days and then come back for them, but, that’s fine…”
Of course, he had no hope of processing a revelation that huge right now – he had far, far too many things to be happy about first, before he could think about that… But he felt it. He understood everything it made better, everything it meant…
Tony gave another yelp of surprise, which this time softened into a contented hum as Steve’s lips settled against his skin. He let his body melt closer into Steve, shifting his weight and lifting his head so that Steve could trail kisses down along his throat.
The friction of denim on the inside of his thighs – the thrill of thinking that Steve hadn’t even finished getting undressed.
A few hours later, and Steve and Tony were both still sitting awkwardly at either end of Tony’s enormous couch. Steve had his hands clasped firmly in his lap in a desperate attempt to keep them still, while Tony had his arms wrapped around his knees, his eyes slightly lowered, as though he was fighting the urge to curl up into a ball.
way Ross and everyone seemed to be pushing on with this, and the sympathy I felt for Wanda – even, I know it sounds stupid, but the fear and sympathy I felt for
Tony snorted at himself for so casually slipping into language that sounded so silly to him - and might not even be right.
There was the tell-tale, almost imperceptible dip in the pit of Tony’s stomach that let him know the jet had
Tony looked down at the case, still swaying innocently in his hand. Suddenly, it felt so much heavier…
And, at last, the scalding surge of pleasure, as Steve slid his hand into Tony’s underwear and curled his fingers around his cock.
Or, maybe it would have been fairer to say that Bucky was only now realising how strange it all was, when he was sitting on this examination table before. Thinking back to the blur of that first week was weirder than living through it, in some ways...
“But I don’t mean saying I love you” Tony clarified, quickly. “And, just so you know, I meant every word of
… and wondering, for just a moment, if he’d made a horrible mistake… And then Erskine had been shot and there was someone to chase, so the new legs just had to work, and that was that.
The way they both understood that – even when Thanos was in Wakanda, or New York was full of aliens, or Sokovia was flying – you still couldn’t maintain complete and total focus for longer than fifteen minutes. No one could. It was a physical and emotional impossibility… but until you spend two hours battling Chitauri, you just wouldn’t understand. That sometimes you
Steve knew it wouldn’t be ‘against the rules’ for him to sleep with Bucky again. If nothing else, he and Tony had actually discussed it. Steve had casually mentioned all sorts of details about his relationship with Bucky, as and when they came up, while he and Tony were chatting. And Tony had accepted those details as easily as he accepted everything else – exactly as easily as Steve had been expecting him to – and followed the conversation wherever it happened to lead.
At first, Tony was worried that maybe Steve felt like he needed to be punished, or something… That Tony had made him feel like that…
“So, are you working on that now?” Steve carried on, before Tony could say anything. The slightest hint of intention at the end there…
I will be posting a very short epilogue immediately after this, but, for all intents and purposes - IT'S FINISHED!
Which made for some beautiful views, of course. Acres of unspoiled, rolling green, stretching out to picturesque hilltops, above which a dazzling spray of stars was beginning to peek through the advancing twilight…
but…I don’t think of those other things the same way. It’s always those guards I think of, the one’s that used to run a bakery and loved their
He glanced up just in time to see the sappy smile on Bucky’s face – before he spotted Tony and covered himself, somewhat awkwardly.
“Sergeant Barnes’ baseline readings suggest he is in the process of waking up,” JARVIS explained. “I would estimate that he will be fully conscious within the hour.”
He tried to find the context around that surreal collection of images, but there was only a nauseous swirl of lights and dead space. So, he screwed his eyes shut, and told himself to start at the beginning again-
Steve nodded back and took the rice over to the sink to drain it, equally relieved to find that it was cooked properly. And he wasn’t even sure why he was so bothered – he didn’t really believe that Tony would think less of him if the meal turned out badly. They could probably make a joke of it, it might have been a funny story they told later-
And it wasn’t so much that ‘the penny dropped.’ It was more like one of those slide arcade machines, where one penny dropping into the right place can push two coins into four, moving everything one step closer to the edge. Every individual thought landed with a sharp
“Oh God no,” Steve groaned, at full volume. Rhodey, Nat and Pepper all spluttered through a shocked laugh - but, suffice to say, Rousseau was completely unaffected.
And Tony just hoped it showed on his face, how very much he’d like Steve to get into this… “They were talking about how we discourage other people from seeking such
, we’ll call him Jimmy, why not – then me, Nat and Jimmy spend a whole year following up leads on my parents murder, without telling you. And
Every surface in the workshop had been covered with precarious stacks of paper, the floor was littered with empty file boxes and the air was alive with hologram screens, layered one on top of the other. It took a second for Steve to sort it all into any kind of sense, by which time Tony had already called out to him,
He imagined being able to lie Tony out of a bed and dote on him for hours, all the wonderful details of him that Steve could run his fingertips over, all the ways that he could make Tony feel good-
Panting heavily, Tony broke away. A wave of giddiness flooded through him, his limbs turning to water in Steve’s arms – it took him a few deep, deliberate breaths before he could manage to speak,
And Steve was flooded with such a sense of relief, hearing Tony say that. A sudden feeling of rightness. Balance.
decide to end this thing after Tony became dependent on him – the hotter, brighter flash of terror at the idea that it might already have happened.
But, for now, thinking about all the horrible things that might’ve happened just made Steve even more excited about how things had actually worked out.
, Steve,” Tony whispered, as he spread Steve open, moving Steve into position. “You are everything I’ve ever wanted, the only thing I
Advanced warning, this chapter starts with a Steve/Bucky sex scene, in a reasonable amount of detail - if that's not what you're here for, and you'd prefer to skip it, all you really need to know if that Bucky is a good bro. Any questions, as ever, please feel free to contact me!
share that excitement… or he would, when he had time for it. For now, he could only hope he’d managed to at least look as though he was listening – and promise to feel appropriately bad, and make sufficient amends, just as soon as he was able.
It was like the first brick pulled out of the wall, the first little stumble on the way to the finish line - the second he gave into that feeling, there was no pulling it back. No way to stop himself from crumbling into the bliss of
He was, in the first instance, completely overwhelmed by the sheer devastating pleasure of that bite.
Well. He wasn’t sure Steve would agree with that statement. At one point they’d walked past an ‘erotic theatre performance’ in which a woman was being (quite happily) fisted – and Steve had
Tony felt his entire body surrender to it, softening under him in defeat. He carried on chastening himself, even though he already felt thoroughly ashamed,
“So, I have a theory.” Tony announced, before Steve could say anything. Steve could see the way he thought ahead of what he was saying, the way his eyes kept darting back to the papers, like the back of his head was still working on it, even as he was talking to Steve. Steve remembered the speedy, animated patter of his voice when he talked this way, he knew that any minute now Tony was going to take a little step back and open his arms, like he was at the beginning of a presentation.
“We’re not just going to let you walk out of here,” Nick informed him, in what was probably meant to be a commanding tone.
it is easy… And I know that I’m going to love you, and look out for you, for the rest of your life – which isn’t as creepy as I just made it sound, I swear,” Tony cut himself off with a frown. Steve laughed, but before he could reassure him, Tony carried on, “I know what you’re going to say, but it’s important that I say this anyway – if you told me that you wanted nothing to do with this anymore, and you never wanted to see me again… It’d break my heart, and it wouldn’t stop me looking out for you, but I’d listen to you. I appreciate there are parts of this that might be… different, and, you know, complicated… But there’s no reason in any of this for me to be a controlling, abusive bastard. Your needs as a human being aren’t less important than what I am as a vampire, and you’ve every right to expect all those human considerations… whatever else we’re doing. And I never want you to be with me – or to do
need to think about it - probably something about the way that Steve was literally hovering with delighted anticipation, he supposed…
“We’ve gotta go wider on the public awareness campaign,” Pepper interrupted his train of thought over the headset. “You need to do some press. I'm in DC tomorrow-”
“Oh, yeah,” Steve shook himself back to attention. “Yeah, just… weird to think of you and Bucky living together, I guess…”
“I will love you and look after you for as long as I live,” Steve breathed, letting his forehead rest against Tony’s.
“So…” Steve announced, nervously, as he put the grocery bag onto the counter. “I have brought tinned tomatoes,” he pulled each item out of the bag as he named it, “a bottle of soy sauce, a bag of rice, some granulated sugar, and a can of corned beef.” And, as he was saying it, Steve was again panicking that this had been a really bad idea… But Tony laughed, kindly. That laugh that Steve always felt a little bit proud to have gotten out of him.
Another giggle bubbled over Steve’s lips. Bucky grinned at him, somewhere between amused and smug. And then Bucky looked back at Tony, and Tony had that brief panic of what he was ‘supposed’ to do with his face…only to realise that he was already smiling.
He had no idea if he’d done any of that right, or if it would lead to anywhere better… But there was a truly dizzying relief when he realised that it wouldn’t end up in the
His orgasm crashed though him, surging up through his back and deep in his thighs, that pressure breaking into an overwhelming, dizzying release. He squeezed his eyes shut, his arms wrapped tight around Tony’s waist, bracing against the sheer intensity of it. And then Steve’s limbs fell away from him, his muscles falling loose as all the tension was washed out of him, leaving him entirely helpless to the shocks still running though him.
He turned to make that observation to Steve… And once again, found himself completely floored by just how lovely he looked.
“And, yeah, I guess it did turn into a bit of a ‘who’s side are you on’ thing, and… yeah, that’s not a good way to decide anything, especially something as complicated as this.” Steve smiled, self-consciously. “And, honestly, I don’t know if what I think about The Accords has changed all that much either… But
Tony looked at him, his hair still damp from the shower, his bag dangling from his shoulder… for all his commanding strength and despite everything he’d been through, there was something so pure and innocent about Steve. A simple goodness that couldn’t be complicated by anything. He had the same nervous optimism about him now as a kid leaving home for the first time…
That he already knew all the reasons he couldn’t be what Steve needed, that it would be unfair to let Steve tie himself to him…all those risks Steve would be taking… Tony tried to believe that he’d remember the importance of all those things, in time.
“It seems a lot to put on the line, to have an awkward conversation, in the same basement, with someone who has nothing to say,” Tony sighed, “And, you know, the fact that I
And he had the same instinct, that he was never supposed to be out of it like this… the same vague memory that something was important…
“Well, I wish I hadn’t mentioned your dad, especially because now I can’t think of anything to say that isn’t about your dad.” Steve babbled, and Tony felt his smile warm into something a bit more genuine.
Tony had come to think that was what love meant. That whatever his hypothetical perfect relationship was - and however unlikely that he’d really find it - it would have to begin with someone who wouldn’t try to rescue him. That would have to be built into the very foundations…
He remembered how much he’d wanted to fall into that and stay there. How much he’d wished there wasn’t still that awful thing sitting there between them…
Steve’s breath shuddered a little as he inhaled, slowly. He swallowed, hard. And then, in a tight voice, he managed,
And Tony just knew this was one of those things that would be sad, if he really thought about it. Like any of the little things he found to smile about; the positive news stories and the progress of the Avengers and the things that went right for Rhodey and Pepper… Things that could only make him happy if he didn’t stop to analyse them. If he didn’t let himself get as far as thinking that he’d never have it for himself, that he couldn’t really be a part of anything, that no one would ever know what made him smile.
Steve wiped the water from his eyes before he turned to throw Tony a glare – which failed spectacularly, because Tony was grinning so proudly that it was impossible not to grin back.
Yes, he knew there were all those questions still to answer, and all those future plans to get frustrated over, and past decisions to analyse again…
“Please do it Tony, please, please,” he begged, his voice so rough and dark it wasn’t even his own anymore. “
And the reason he’d invited Sam over was because Bucky still came to visit him, or to hang out with he and Steve occasionally – and had gushed so enthusiastically about his new relationship that Tony had actually

change to his routine would upset his numbed denial, that having any sort of connection would just remind him how lonely he was… That Steve would become an avatar for all the experiences he’d never have, and this whole arrangement would sharpen all the hurt that was already there.
. The grinding realisation that they’d had this talk so many times, that he’d hated himself for this so many times…
make sense for a human to sink their teeth into someone's throat. The reality wouldn’t convey the abstract appeal…
...He realised how many elements were at work here. How seamlessly art and music and storytelling had been blended with technical design - how many tiny moving pieces were working to create a subconscious impression of fairy dust and approaching firelight…
Steve gave his head a shake, and let go of a breath he didn’t know he was holding. He really had to get a grip. He reminded himself that he was actually supposed to be back up on a serious mission, not thinking the thoughts of someone sitting alone in a bar – and weird, self-indulgent thoughts, at that.
to remember and master, and then you also manage to fire and hit things, even though you’re flying at a million miles an hour…”
...But Steve shook it away. For one, there had never been any doubt in his mind that Pierce knew. As the Council Secretary, he knew everything - well, Steve assumed.
She slipped into a spiteful mocking tone – clearly getting carried away with her own monologue again.
Thankfully, in this reality, he just about managed to right himself, settling into his weight very deliberately as Tony… just… looked at him…
. Tony didn’t know where to begin processing that one. The fact that it shouldn’t happen. The fact that it
“I’m not going to be out in it long,” Tony answered automatically, never breaking his stride, almost at the entrance already-
Steve Rogers to intercept this one – those identities existed in a separate reality from wherever this had come from.
“Clint slow clapped me as I walked in, told me it was all on me for thinking I knew what was best for everyone… Like I’d had you arrested for not signing. Like I was the one who’d said you tore the Avengers apart with a political opinion. When all I ever did was try to bend them and sell them and shape them so that you
They had all just been there in the real world, the same people they’d always been, before everything changed for
quality in Tony, to take all of his adoration and affection and put it into that embrace, just to feel the shape of Tony against his chest…
Tony could imagine the way that smile would flicker. He could so easily picture Steve parting his lips, taking a sharp breath as Tony pushed him back against the counter-
“There are a few of those basements, where we develop different things. Those are mostly the pure medicines, the things we’re good at. Then it gets pumped up to
And then he saw that questioning expression flicker across Steve’s features, almost pleading, his fingertips still pressing against Tony’s skin…
He wasn’t going to start theorising about where it came from, or what else it might be like - not yet, anyway.
He had spent the last few hours floating on that feeling, revelling in the possibilities of simply being alive. For the first time in so long, Steve genuinely felt like he was a
They’d chosen different coping methods. They’d deflected in different ways. The expectations they were weighed down by weren’t the same…
“And who brought us here, you?” He asked, even though he hadn’t processed the answer to his first question yet. “Why? How?”
Now Steve found himself looking back over the last year of his life and wondering what exactly he’d been so afraid of. That wordless anxiety about certain topics, that instinct to flinch away from certain questions… Always
He wanted to tell Steve to just keep talking, that this whole area of discussion was captivating and thought-provoking and
Oh...Now Steve realised why this reunion was so unnerving - so different from all the other types of strange he’d come to terms with.
But when she looked back at Tony her eyes had softened, a hint of confusion in her tone as she pointed out,
And then Tony felt him surrender into that same heavy afterglow, a delighted smile washing over his face.
letting it go… He’d established that he was being irrational, okay? And part of it was the little splinter of hurt, that he’d poured his heart out to Steve like that, and Steve had just looked at him.
Maybe then Tony would have the space to think about it properly. Consider what he actually wanted, and what might really be possible, without all those other responsibilities to complicate things.
They slipped inside – both of them subconsciously putting their hands over the patches on their forearms. Tony could swear there was still a little rush of exhilaration, as they crossed the threshold… But it
Tony heard Steve cry out sharply, his hips snapping up against Tony’s mouth, his hand stroking roughly over the back of Tony’s neck.
“Hello, and Welcome,” he announced, throwing his arms wide. “My name is Scaramouche, and this is my assistant, Galileo,” he gestured to the woman, who smiled shyly and gave a little wave with her fingers, “and it is my great honour to welcome you to Bulsara.”
. And it was nothing like the nerves he had to power through at the beginning of every mission, or the queasy feeling he got before press conferences and government meetings and other things he just wanted to be over. It wasn’t that cold anxiety that still stalked him through personal conversations; it wasn’t the fear that something was about to go wrong. This was an electric, vital nervousness. A barely tempered excitement at the idea of something going
Steve’s chin tilted up instantly, like it was following the command directly, a glowing sensitivity already building up along the back of his neck. His cock twitched as soon as Tony’s fingers grazed his collarbone, the pressure coiling in his hips to the point that it ached-
The childish excitement melted away from Rhodey’s face as Tony spoke, settling into an expression of such genuine sympathy… It cooled some of Tony’s frustration, and made his ribs feel uncomfortably tight.
They found a short, bare-looking hallway, with three doors on each side – and Zan, standing impatiently, in the middle of it. She gave them a sharp nod, and turned on her heel, striding purposefully toward the door furthest from them, on the right. Steve and Tony glanced at each other briefly, and then at their surroundings, before they followed her.
it was natural even though it might be messy or confusing or intersect with societal expectations sometimes…
When Rocket gave Steve the short-hand version of Quill’s family tree, it had unsettled him just a little. The concept of a being that was also a planet who was also a God was far outside Steve’s frame of reference, even as they were trying to build a time machine… But that was okay, because it just
knew he’d done it. There was the vaguest flicker of an observation, somewhere on the peripheries, as he felt that little tug of gluey resistance… the foreign object he was distantly aware of, stuck to the outside of his thumb for a second, before it fell away…
“We’ve been trying to get hold of you,” Coulson scolded him, like he was both angry and disappointed, all but barging into Tony as he stepped out into the lobby.
sure-” was cut off when Steve kissed him again, his hands already caressing roughly over Tony’s ribs.
Once Gary was in position, Steve sprinted back up towards the refrigerator and let himself in, closing the door behind him.
There were so many things he’d been running from. Things it had seemed easier to bury… until, against all odds, a solution appeared.
run tests on all these drugs? They’ve been running trials and things to develop them in the first place – isn’t that what Dev was saying?”
“And, you know…what my line is, anyway” Tony added awkwardly. Steve nodded, shyly. “And, obviously, we don’t know how things might change when we get up there… But, so far, they seem pretty keen not to push people past any limits, so I think the best plan is to just
chasing him. And holding a gun to the head of everyone on earth. And literally in the middle of bombing him, at the exact moment he found all that out.
Tony had already opened his mouth to tell Steve it was okay. His lips were already curved around the words…
to tell Steve that he was being ridiculous. That the ‘right’ answer was to assure Steve that he didn’t have to be that paranoid, that
Wesley lived in a rundown little house on Staten Island, with weather-worn wainscotting and a rusted flagpole out front. One lonely window glowed in the encroaching darkness, flickering intermittently with the rhythm of a television screen. Immediately, Tony got the impression of a sad and solitary life.
Tony breathed a heavy sigh, and propped his elbows on the desk, and let his head fall into his hands. The temptation to give into that instinct was growing by the second…
“Well, for what it’s worth, we think this project would benefit from your input,” he smiled, in a perfectly friendly manner that set Tony’s teeth on edge. “And - this is just me - I think this might be your chance to make a real, positive change to the world, which I know is what you really want.”
wanted to tell Steve, and he wanted to tell him so very much, that he already had his phone in his hand.
“I didn’t say that,” Steve corrected. Tony paused, and caught Steve’s eye in a questioning expression,
He knew it was surreal - that, at the time, there had been all sorts of observations about why it was a ridiculous situation to find himself in...
. This was the first time that Tony had felt this in so long, and yet now he could hardly believe it had ever been anything different-
“And I know it makes you miserable, having to drink that stuff,” Steve pushed ahead. “And I get why you do that – but if there’s an alternative right there, and it’s so much better, and it can’t hurt me, and
“What did you say?” Tony heard himself ask - simply following through on the sentence he’d been forming when he fell into this trance.
, because you don’t know anything about Siberian Super Soldiers – not until we get to the fucking airport, anyway. And then you actually feel bad, for not immediately listening to that clue I threw out in the middle of a combat zone, so you do all the investigating I never gave you the chance to do earlier, and you come to help me, only to find that the whole thing was a trap. Can you imagine how that would
And that, finally, stopped him from talking. It stunned even his mind into total silence – which was the only reason he heard the computer’s next announcement.
“Woah, woah! It’s okay, it’s okay…” Steve yelled automatically, scrambling to come up with a strategy for this. He realised that only one of Bucky’s arms was fighting him, before Bucky could get the words out,
“God, you are so fucking perfect,” just slipped over Steve’s lips, as Tony fell forward, his weigh resting heavily on one arm. Tony laughed, but was too preoccupied with catching his breath to try to answer.
said, ‘accidents will happen’. And there was an image of your dad – the newspaper headline, the day after he died. Just a flash,
And, when he did briefly think back to his earlier intentions, and remembered that he wasn’t supposed to jump Steve within five minutes of him arriving… It was like remembering part of a dream. That momentary confusion when you remember the exam you were driving to or the goat you were supposed to keep an eye on or the fact that your mom is having an affair with your geography teacher – that same amused realisation that,
Her monologue was cut off as the waitress appeared beside the table, and Vanessa turned to order breakfast for all four of them – in spite of the fact that Andrew clearly didn’t want anything. Tony took the opportunity to throw Steve a sceptical look, and Steve pinched his lips,
Still, he was almost running through the Tower in a bid to get to his next appointment on time, with the exact same anxiety he used to get when he was late for Sunday School-
He stayed close to the wall, his eyes fixed on the target, reminding himself that his best chance was to commit to this completely.
Once again, I apologise that this update comes so late on a Monday - this time it was family drama 😂 But luckily everything worked out *just* in time for me to stick to schedule... I swear, I'm still aiming for a morning update each week 😂
And then he felt Steve collapse away from him, his body turning to water under Tony’s hands, and when Tony finally pulled back and gulped for air – God, he was
Secondly, it was more than just ‘nice’. It was like a work of art. Steve had found himself strangely fascinated by how flawless everything was, how effortlessly every detail worked together, how many comforts and conveniences were invisibly waiting for any possible need. How beautiful it all was.
The front door swung open, flooding the living room with grey, watery sunlight. The shapes Steve had been staring at for half an hour were instantly rendered unfamiliar, as the modest interior of Nick's neat little New York apartment came into life. An excited thrumming started up under Steve’s ribs, building as the sound of movement drew closer.
. His heart raced, high and tight in his chest. His grip on Tony loosened just a little, as his body relaxed into the relief of it-
And, just as he was scrambling for a way to end this whole thing, Tony looked back at him with an entirely different sort of focus.
And the issue had been less of an issue this time, thanks to Tony. At least Tony hadn’t spent the last two weeks suggesting alternative painkillers, like the team at NASA did – repeatedly missing the point that Bucky
But he found himself drifting back into his head, back into his memories – until it was literally those moments he was looking at, until he’d forgotten about the room he was in-
They weren’t all good minutes. In the four days since Steve left, Tony’s mood had bounced from extreme to extreme like an out of control rally car. Thoughts occurred to him like mental explosions, sudden and unpredictable, scattering ideas in all directions.
lab. They add their elements to it, and then it gets added to the water supply, and the ventilation systems.”
And then Steve pulled back to suck hard against the head of Tony’s cock, eliciting the sharp shock of pleasure that finally broke him. Tony let out a truly whorish moan as he came, hard, in Steve’s mouth, arching up off of the mattress as that surge of relief cut right through the centre of him, pulsing deep in the core of him for and endless, limitless moment…
Steve did a quick scan of the surroundings. The area at the end of both bars seemed to be where the spare crates and empty boxes got thrown, which was good – meant that the bartenders never came up to the very far end, at least… He did a quick tally of the customers waiting to be served, a brief assessment of the system each server seemed to be using, to work their way through the queue… He glanced at Tony and signalled, silently,
Which is probably the exact look that crossed Steve’s face, when he realised that Tony had been crying.
Century, and hadn’t known whether to panic about the strange new world he was in or grieve the death of every single person he’d ever known – and in the end he hadn’t gotten to do either, because a Norse God had stolen the Tesseract and New York was full of aliens. And he had been brought in specifically to deal with that threat, he was there to
a truth serum?” He sighed - a smile pulling at the corner of his lips as Nat dissolved into giggles again.
“There’s nothing like that in the guide - but I can find those details for you,” Freddie answered obligingly. “I can’t be sure how well the details will translate into Terran sensibilities, but I will bring everything that we have. You may also be interested in attending the Hans Zarkov Annual Flower Show this afternoon - you’ll find the leading experts on the Bulsaran Ecosystem there.”
His instincts still nagged at him, of course. Instincts couldn’t understand context - they had no way of knowing when you’d gotten the message, and worked out what you had to do. But Tony could understand the context, now that he knew the instinct for what it was. He
There was that wordless connection between two people who had just shared something intimate… Still felt it…
A different sort of nervousness began to gather in Steve’s chest. Something simple and physical and perfectly human… Something that felt closer to excitement than fear.
And this time Tony could only moan, surrendering to the brutal rhythm Steve had set, his head falling forward. Steve looked up at him, watching that need flash up in his eyes over and over, his lips flushed dark red…
all that, and push anyone away, and make it so hard for anyone… And you wouldn’t want someone who’d just put up with that.”
It meant sticking to the plan, and the ideals behind it, even when you didn’t feel like it today, or when a shiny new idea caught your attention, or when someone tried to talk you out of it…
Steve had already put so much thought into stopping Hydra, and saving Bucky - and so much of that planning had been about keeping Tony safe.
“Okay, no one is denying that you’re a total clusterfuck of a person,” Rhodey delivered it completely straight, which made Tony laugh again. “But liking someone because they’re pretty is not the reason. I know it’s been a while since you met any, but
point,” Steve carried on with a weary sigh. “I know we’re going to have to deal with them… And, honestly…” And he took one final glance at that kind look in Tony’s eyes, gearing himself up for this next little step. “And I know this is going to sound bad, however I say it…”
just the nicest guy on earth that happened to walk in… But, whatever. At some point in the last few weeks I just started feeling differently about him. And that was… I don’t know. Probably going to be a problem anyway. I mean, even before last night, I was already thinking it was going to be hard to get over all this…”
know all of SHIELDs secrets, so I won’t have to study to use them to my advantage,” Steve began, confidently. “I’m more likely to survive a fight with a Norse God, seeing as they’re not likely to let you wear the suit. You’re the one they’ve asked for, so it’s less likely to play into their hand if I turn up. And because,” he finished dramatically, “I have an idea.”
Tony tightened every muscle in his body to keep himself from flinching. He felt Bucky hold his breath. Then Tony loosened his grip on the built-for-purpose tweezers he’d been using, and leant away, and relaxed his arms. Taking a moment to recentre and reset himself before he tried again-
That was… Good? Was it good? It was the good things about it that struck Steve first… The fact that he’d finally found someone he could want like that. The fact that Steve
And it annoyed him that SHIELD were happy to send him as a catch-all contingency. That they thought nothing of upending his life or even putting it at risk, without having any real idea what he was even going to do. That they didn’t
of them – whether it’s your fault or not – I will hunt you down, and I’ll do something so much worse than murder you, and everyone you love,” and he bared his teeth to make the point. “So, I’d be doing everything I could to call the guards off, if I were you.”
, Steve, oh please, I’m going to-” but his voice was swallowed by a strangled cry, as Steve took the tip of his cock in his mouth, and
Steve felt like he should know that. Like it should have been an event, when it happened. Like he should really have thought about this before now. But it had been so easy to fall in love with Tony, that he’d never stopped to panic about the fact that he’d fallen in love at all.
,” he breathed an astonished laugh, his hand still playing gently over the surface of Tony’s chest, “in three days flat, with a car battery wired into your chest,
“I, uh, I don’t… not in so many…words, I don’t think…” Steve stammered awkwardly, a hot blush running up his neck-
flared up just as quickly, consuming every euphoric sensation with a frenetic desire for more of it.
And then Bucky pushed into him in one swift, smooth motion, tearing through one layer of that tension, forcing the air up out of his lungs. For a brief second, Steve’s mind went blank, all of his faculties focused on just
But none of that stopped the heat pulsing under Steve’s skin. If anything, it all just melted into one giddy, queasy sensation. Shame and desire, confusion and clarity…
Steve took the sedative cloth out of his pocket, and concealed it in his palm, and they both strolled confidently over to the staircase.
“It’s alright Wesley, I’m on first name terms with everyone at this hospital,” Tony reassured mindlessly, as he scrolled through his phone for Peppers number. “You’ll get some
He imagined Tony’s hands, pushing him down, tearing his clothes off, gripping Steve’s hips while he fucked him, just like this.
And Tony hated to think of Steve just waiting there while he ‘decided’. Or, really, it was that he hated the idea of
shit… And still you try. All on your own, with no one to ask, you try to get better, you keep trying to get it right… And then I chain you to a bed and yell at you for not being quite good enough at
And even outside of that - every ordinary, human anxiety Steve had ever felt had been eased by a day just lying in Tony’s arms. His fears that this relationship could only be complicated and painful had been replaced by an optimistic nervousness that things seemed to be going really well. His shapeless loneliness and confusion about life in the 21st Century had, at last, relented. His back even felt better.
That this was the first time he’d raised his voice to Tony since those first few weeks at the Tower…
A burst of blood filled his mouth and slid down his throat, a surge of adrenaline flooding him in its wake,
As well as their deep affinity with natural intoxicants of all kinds… or, perhaps because of it… The Varians had a very relaxed attitude to sex. It was, apparently, considered to be a perfectly natural, everyday expression of affection – possibly inappropriate in a business meeting, but certainly not out of place at a party…
And Tony couldn’t help wondering how he’d have heard that, a few days ago. What he might’ve assumed Steve’s thoughts to be, what he’d have seen when he looked at him. Somewhere, he recognised that these were the times they used to fight… he thought, probably, he’d have heard an accusation in Steve’s tone there, or some level of judgement. That his first reaction would probably have been,

example of a shift in your perception, and you’re not hallucinating, yeah?” Figaro answered, gesticulating as he spoke. “But, I mean, in that example, nothing really looks different to you - you’re seeing the same stuff, just more clearly. But there are ways to see a completely different landscape through a shift in your perception alone, if you know what I mean?”
And it suddenly Tony found himself thinking how things would have gone, if it weren’t for Zemo. What would have happened if he’d just found out one day that Steve had kept that secret for him – the way normal people get to discover these things, on an otherwise uneventful Tuesday, when you can at least focus on that one revelation…
Tony’s shoulders fell from under him, a particular self-consciousness curling in his stomach. He could so clearly picture Pepper, standing at the window or in front of one of the security monitors, watching him fidget on the doorstep until her patience wore thin…
In the end, he’d fallen into some sort of shallow compromise, drifting somewhere between awake and asleep. That strange, unsatisfying limbo, in which he was unable to direct his thoughts but still somehow aware of the time passing.
, talk like that – the way he was citing percentages and relevant comparisons and control groups. It was exactly like listening to a scientist explain this place, after
“I’ve got just the thing for you” She announced, at last. And then she glanced between them. “Come with me.”
He would’ve liked to ask exactly what Steve was implying. What he imaged Tony would be getting up to. Why he always thought the worst of him.
Steve backed the car into the specified bay behind Tony Stark’s mansion. He cut the engine, and then pulled his cell phone out of his pocket so that he could switch it off, as instructed. And then he took a moment to look up at the house…
that there was something significant about it, that there was something that should’ve occurred to him. He knew there was something…different, about the strength of Tony’s grip or how quickly he could move. Steve knew he should think more of it than the things that had immediately occurred to him-
Steve knew that he couldn’t talk to Tony - even if the laws of time travel would allow it, his current mood didn’t. Even if he’d
Steve brought Tony close to his chest again as he made the call, his hand stroking affectionately though Tony’s hair as he relayed a brief synopsis to Natasha.
, if there was no one to contradict it? Would the years in between have been real, if not for people like Steve and Bruce and Thor to vouch for them?
“So, there’s a working truth serum on earth, now?” He asked, like he knew he’d drifted off topic, but he just wanted to know.
find slavery objectionable, if no one had told you it was?” Adam challenged “Are you sure that if you were forced to look at that with fresh eyes, and listen to the arguments objectively, you’d
Tony didn’t know whether to be surprised by the resistance he suddenly felt. On the one hand, it was familiar – it was the instinct that would have made sense, at any other time in the last twenty years. But, on the other hand, there was the incongruous fact that he’d already
like the violent desperation that consumed him at the very thought of Tony drinking someone else’s blood.
And maybe Tony couldn’t control how much he wanted to hurt this person… But, if he put a lot of effort in, he could control what he did about it.
He tried again to tell Tony how good it was, how much better he felt, how much he loved him… something like that. His head was too muddled to turn the sentiments into words, his mouth too heavy to form them. It came out as a sort of slurred, muffled groan… Tony just squeezed him tighter, and hummed an affectionate smile into his hair.
“Yes, I want you, I want you inside me, please,” Tony assured him, already picturing it, his own cock hard against his stomach again.
There was a surge of release with every mouthful Tony took, a rush of elation, a feeling of total fulfilment and an immediate craving for more, all at once.
Tony groaned, low in his chest, as Steve pushed a second finger into him - which then broke into a pleading whine, as Steve twisted his hand and pushed in deeper.
about what tests he’d have to run – he was just thinking that he’d like to step out of this ever increasing clusterfuck, please. And then he realised that they were both still looking at him, expectantly.
“Is that so?” Steve grinned in response. As it turned out, Selvig was an easy man to like, and Steve had rather enjoyed his company for the last three days.
Steve might’ve felt Tony reach for the caddy, or heard him snatch something from the top of it – he didn’t really know, and he didn’t
Tony had stopped thinking of Steve as Captain America since he’d actually met him – so much so that he’d sort of forgotten he
“Great, okay, well, Joost and Zoe will be just outside if you need anything – just give them a call.” She smiled, gesturing to the doorway. “I’ll probably be passing this way again in an hour or so, so I’ll check in again, and see how you are.”
And, in his fury and his misplaced panic, his mind was capable of picking out just the moments that fit this outrage. The individual arguments and actions – whoever they came from – that had contributed to a lifetime of impotent anger. The images that could be pulled into a theme that he’d settled on anyway, a general mood, a
about it. Maybe he had been watching too many Disney Movies lately, but Bucky couldn’t help feeling like this was one of those big narrative moments… One of those choices that was going to be formative, either way.
A blush ran up Bucky’s neck, as he recognised how unsubtle that exchange was - and that he had no idea what he was going to say to cover it up.
Tony to that Bunker - especially not if Bucky was going to be there. He couldn’t play into this awful fate like that.
“Yeah. There’s a roof garden” He explained, curtly, putting his feet up and letting his head slide down to rest on the arm of the couch. “The stars are all wrong. We’re a
“You’re very sweet, you know that?” Tony told him, even though he wasn’t sure he should be saying it.
“Shhh, it’s okay baby” Steve soothed, already tugging the rest of Tony’s clothes down over his legs. And Tony writhed desperately, in a not-especially-coordinated attempt to help Steve with this, letting Steve’s voice echo in his head, hot and low and protective,
Now he knew that at least some of his most fundamental assumptions were flawed. He had seen it happen, he
“Well, the effect varies, actually, depending on who drinks it, and when.” Maribelle announced, sounding pleased with herself. And Steve
A wave of physical exhaustion rolled up his back, as he remembered that conversation with Nick, before he left for Germany.
And wanting an excuse to spend time with Tony and getting to overthink the fact that Tony had invited him and thinking that Tony looked especially lovely in that tux was probably all very silly - but it was a reason to want to be here.
“So, we either make a run for the door, or we’re back to the knocking them out plan,” he summarised.
Actually, it wasn’t anything at all. Just a high-pitched noise that broke into a low, anguished groan as his climax jerked through him.

“Grow a spine JARVIS. I’ve got plans,” he retorted - even though Coulson had already disrupted them, simply by jarring him out of his easy mood.
will enable the total collaboration of our worlds, when the time comes.” Adam explained. “It’s a drug that wipes people’s memories – but, oh, it’s so much more than that.”
“Okay, Steve is, at the moment, in a meeting with ‘Talleroy Communications’ – the same company that gave him this flyer, a few months ago,” Tony explained, with a clarity and authority that would’ve been beyond him a minute earlier. “They’ve been networking with the Avengers for months, pretending to be a ‘communications’ firm – but they aren’t. They’re a chemical weapons manufacturer, or they’re dealing in black market pharmaceuticals – whatever it is they’re doing, they’ve been working with some seriously dangerous chemicals, in enough quantities to leave traces on their paperwork,” and he gestured with the flyer again, and waited until Peppers patient compassion had melted into general confusion, and then sharped into a more focused concern.
thought he was whispering. From the way Tony’s eyes suddenly widened, Steve had to assume that’d come out louder than he’d meant it to…
And, by now, Tony was just completely lost in this. Running with it, letting one thought crash into the next, letting it all just fall out of his mouth.
this. Somehow, this just felt like the sort of complicated clusterfuck he’d promised not to get involved in anymore - that this was the life he was supposed to have left behind, when he and Pepper got together.
Steve felt himself step back into the room. His self-interested obsession was set aside, along with everything else, as he remembered all the things he was usually focused on from the outset. The things he knew Bucky was afraid of. The things they always had to argue about. They’d avoided all of that so far, because Tony had let Bucky lead the conversation – but Steve knew there was no way that Tony would just accept this one. No one did. Most people took it for granted that Bucky would want to be numbed, some even went as far as administering things without telling him – and every single one of them argued, when Bucky said he didn’t want it. They all made him struggle to explain his resistance, they always made him feel ridiculous for his objections, and most of the time they ended up getting their own way. Steve could see the entire conversation unfolding in front of him. He knew every beat off by heart-
Tony’s eyes softened. He glanced over Steve’s shoulder again, presumably checking that Sam and Bucky were still there. Then he pinched his lips and gave a little nod.
“So I see,” Peirce smiled, strolling around his desk and sitting down - glancing at the chair on the opposite side, in a silent invitation to do the same.
He felt Steve push a hand down between them, fumbling slightly as he unfastened Tony’s belt, before he helped Tony wriggle free of his clothes. They carried on stealing kisses from one another the whole time, Tony pressing his lips to Steve’s shoulder and jaw and the side of his face – just, wherever he could reach.
It took a good few minutes for his ears to stop ringing and his heart rate to return to normal. Eventually, Steve was able to take a few long, slow breaths without choking on them, and at last got to wiping his eyes – and only then discovered that he’d been crying.
“Okay sweetheart, you just rest there for a minute. Then I’ll get you some water, and we’ll get you cleaned up…” He promised, and pressed a tender kiss to Steve’s forehead. And then he carried on, more quietly, like he was simply musing to himself, “my perfect,
,” Bucky exhaled, like he was trying to keep his temper. “You’ve got to do literally anything besides
Which made this the first time Steve hadn’t woken up anxious and irritable in oh so long… but he barely even noticed, at first.
“The hard part…” Tony sighed, looking down at Steve’s hands. “The hard part is having to explain that… I understand what you’re saying about how scared this makes you - I even understand that there are bits I can’t understand. That I haven’t seen trauma like yours to
“No, maybe not” He grinned. “Maybe I just can’t wait to get this thing done with, so that we can go home, and I
“Come on, let’s go,” Tony whispered to him alone, leading him out of the house without another glance at Wesley.
falling over his lips. Tony grinned, and unfastened the first button, slowly caressing his fingertips over the glimpse of newly exposed skin.
If there was any stirring of doubt in that moment, any initial idea that something was strange… Steve had to ignore that right now. He had to focus.
. Not even filtering for the complicated bits and the contradictory bits and the I’m-not-sure-I-should-think-this bits. Just… “It’s more when it turns out that he was actually researching… I don’t know, a type of abortion, or a way to disseminate pornography, or something where half the planet think he’s immoral and half of them think he’s making a great moral stand – and it turns out that the punishment is being…
There was quite a jump in Tony’s level of irritation with this, from just a minute earlier. It didn’t help that Steve’s efforts were getting more transparent, the more desperate he became. Tony was sure, any minute now, he was going to break and outright ask,
It confused his body first. Instinctively, his hands reached out for some kind of context, and found only empty air. He braced himself to fall forwards, only to realise that he was already too close to the ground… But not as close as he expected to be, somehow…
"Uh, well, the short answer is that I got a visit from Nick Fury tonight," Tony answered shyly, like he was waiting to be teased for his reaction-
“Hm, a really good party in a chemistry lab…” Steve mused, knowingly. “Nope, can’t think how that could possibly go wrong….”
Steve could hear himself saying Tony’s name over and over again, like a prayer - and he honestly had no idea if he was doing it out loud. He could barely hear it over the rush of his pulse in his ears, and the frantic pitch of his breathing. He tried his best to push Tony deeper, but Tony wouldn’t be hurried, dragging every possible sensation out of him as he twisted two fingers into him. At last he felt Tony’s fingertips brush against his prostate, like they were teasing at that limit,
“Oh God Steve, that was incredible, you are incredible…” Tony babbled, barely aware he was doing it – using most of his focus to try and push himself up, even though his arms were still trembling. And then Steve dropped down to kiss him again, hard and deep and possessive, gripping Tony by the waist. Tony felt another low ache, another jagged spike of desire even as his body struggled to recover.
And, now that he was clean, and comfortable, he could let his mind drift to the idea of curling up in his own bed, and letting his eyes just fall shut…
that there’s no way I’d still be here to figure any of this out, if it weren’t for you two,” Tony went on. “That’s just for a start. I’d be dead without you, both of you, and I know it. And … okay, I think there
“Oh, Steve, I… I was only ever mad at you because I thought you weren’t sorry. And I was only ever hurt because I thought you didn’t care-”
” Tony hissed, as Steve pressed his fingers to that same place - and then dragged a firm, slow touch right against that fault line. Tony’s balls tightened, his cock throbbing so hard that for one startled second the thought he might actually come. When his vision cleared, he found Steve watching his face with a passionate sort of focus, his eyes dark and his lips pursed in thought…
direction,” Sam carried on, jerking his head towards the front of the building, “they might follow me?”
“I mean… I say this with love, but…” Sam started gingerly, clearly being as careful about it as his state of inebriation would allow, “but, has it ever occurred to you that maybe not everyone is a bastard?”
this, or even just feel like he did… Would Tony be forcing some horrible, unknowable risk onto Steve, if he ever let a personal argument disrupt this physical exchange?
Suddenly, Tony wanted to demand answers in a far more urgent way. He wanted to ask Steve to start again, to question every detail with this new sense of purpose…
Which was probably also a bad thought, but it seemed easier to let that one drift through his head than to stop and examine it-
the people who did this to me – or they’re on speaking terms with them, at least. That ‘evil organisation’, the one you’d have stopped if you’d been there at the time?” And he left a beat, for emphasis. “They didn’t tell they’re underlings what they were really up to, either.”
He’d been forced to accept that he really couldn’t hold Bucky responsible for the death of his parents - that he
...Steve knew he had those bases covered, even before he wearily repeated it to himself. Unlike the first time he’d taken down SHIELD, they had their own copy of Hydra’s personnel files - they knew exactly who they’d be looking for, and who their associates were, and what they’d
A pleasant, comfortable confidence began to ease into his muscles - which only wavered slightly when he raised his head, and caught sight of the serial number again…
“And I really don’t know what it is, and my brother says it doesn’t matter because he’s sure it’s something meant for Earth – and honestly, if it is, then I don’t care either, because I hate all of you and I don’t care
been entertaining ideas of lying Steve out like this and doting on him completely – an idea that flared again for a moment, as he watched Steve writhe gently against the bed. He knew that it must’ve been so long since Steve got to be somewhere safe and clean and comfortable, that he must be so weary and achy and bruised. There was still a lot of appeal in the thought of wrapping Steve in blankets, carefully soothing every inch of him…
“Look, Tony,” Rhodey went on gently, when Tony didn’t say anything. “I know there’s a lot of things you think you can’t have. And – I’m not going to get into that argument again, I promise. But… with everything else you do, it’s only about making it
“And I remember being suddenly confused about how IQ worked. Almost convincing myself that 200 was average, and trying to work it out from there – and then thinking,
But still, sometimes he’d lashed out – at Rhodey, at Obie, at total strangers… He’d drunk too much and made poor choices and behaved irresponsibly.
Tony didn’t even bother to kick himself for it. Now that he’d said it, he realised the inevitability of it – that he was
“Oh God I love you” just fell out of his mouth – and he liked that. He liked saying it. He’d completely forgotten
Steve would’ve liked to wonder about that – but as soon as he thought about texting his mind immediately went to the message burning in his pocket. Tony… Probably already lying on their bed…opening himself up for Steve-
By the time they reached Tony’s living room, Steve was so carried away with it that he could’ve just pulled Tony into his arms and kissed him again – just for something to
“Pepper just flat-out writes most of my statements these days,” he went on, not sure if he was going against his every instinct or giving into them. “And, what’s really weird is, if I ever
“I don’t expect him to stay in exile forever because I’m sensitive” Tony smiled, “It’ll just… take some work” He shrugged.
He was so overwhelmed and drained, possibly still under the influence of the very thing he was trying to work out, and
. I thought that’s what you were annoyed about – and I didn’t think you were wrong to be angry about any of it, and I… I did think there were maybe parts of that you’d… there were parts of
There was an angry shout, a spiteful collection of sounds that Steve couldn’t comprehend as words. And then, over the top of it, the very soft whisper in Tony’s voice.
He would have liked to have told her that it was all worth it - even though it would be a lie. Even though he already knew it didn’t matter… Still, he would have liked her to die knowing that she’d made a heroic sacrifice for the greater good. He would have liked to think of her thinking that they’d won.
Tony sank into it, letting it close around him and soak into him and swallow him up, the memory echoing in his mind as Steve thrust into him,
“Sorry, not familiar” He managed, barely above a whisper. Already braced for the shocked exclamation –
And it was only when he felt everyone turn to look at him that Steve realised that he’d said that last one out loud.
“Yeah, of course…” he whispered - even trying for a little smile, before he awkwardly turned to leave-
got drunk I put the suit on, blew up my own house party and then robot-fought Rhodey in the gym – so, I don’t know, maybe that doesn’t mean anything coming from me…But I’m the only one here. So.”
And then, just as he was scrabbling for a comment about the mission, he noticed a flurry of movement out of the corner of his eye. He looked up in time to see a woman in an evening dress go to stumble by him, and then turn to say something to the man behind her – and lose her footing-
words, over the frantic beating of his heart. He was a little bit worried that, if he opened his mouth to say something, he’d actually just be sick.
And then there was nothing but the almost-painful intensity of Tony hitting that sweet spot again, and again, the sensation cutting deeper into the core of him now that his body had turned to water around him. He felt Tony’s hands grip his hips tighter, pulling Steve into to meet his thrusts, harder and rougher, until at last something
with this before he let Steve in, and everything just seemed right again. Because he knew that Steve had an extraordinary – for all Tony knew,
Neither of them could see Maribelle anywhere on the lower level, so they made their way up the stairs. Not there either. They shared an impatient glance, Steve letting go of a slow breath as Tony walked to the edge of the balcony, to scan the ground floor again. They both wanted this to be over now.
Because Tony suddenly had the impression that he’d focused so hard on the places they disagreed, and the differences between them, and the experiences they didn’t share, that he’d blown them out of all proportion. That he’d somehow failed to grasp what incredibly strong foundations they’d been building, even when it’d
And Steve felt his jaw clench involuntarily, hard enough that it made his teeth ache. He’d almost said,
“Apparently my dad collected old sketches,” Tony nodded, a more animated edge on his voice. “Of the most random things… Well, I think they’re random. I keep hoping I’ll find more of them, and then some sort of pattern will emerge.”
Of course, he didn’t get to make that choice. His mind kept going back to that cabin in Canada, dragging all of his other thoughts with it.
Steve watched him go, that ripple of laughter still bubbling below the surface as he thought about that strange interlude…
. Just picturing Steve’s pretty face, soft and sleepy and happy, as he chatted away about everything and nothing. Feeling the weight of Steve pressed warm against his ribs, Steve’s hair sliding over Tony’s fingers, the heat of his breath against Tony’s skin. Letting Steve’s words drift through his memories the way he’d let them just float through the air, at the time-
Oh, but Tony had to be very careful about getting carried away with that thought, before he’d had a chance to speak to Steve about it.
long it had been, there hadn’t been a single word in Tony’s head. There was just the rhythm of his heart… or possibly Steve’s… running all through his body, the sweet taste of the air, the gentle ebb and flow of release rippling through his muscles. Like his whole being had found that sweet spot in the middle distance and was simply floating there.
There was no point, thinking back over the time they’d spent together or cataloguing the few personal insights Steve had shared. Any
that was an entirely human reaction. That impulse people have to stop a stranger from falling, the push that throws someone in front of a friend before they even think about it – the immediate, panicked response to seeing someone in trouble and knowing that the answer was simply,
just want power, and they want it so much that they’ve convinced themselves it’s going to work, when
It was three days later when Tony finally got the chance to sneak back to Steve’s house. And, since he’d decided he’d be harder to track if he went on foot, he’d had a nice, long stroll along the beach to think about all the reasons he hated himself.
Oh…Had Tony really wanted any of this tonight…? Would he have done any of that, if he hadn’t been so emotional and exhausted and overwhelmed to finally say it all out loud…
to find a different starting point, Tony had only just realised that the starting point was clearly that he’d gotten close to Steve already. These were no longer individual things that were happening.
“Yeah, I’ve decided never to ask if there’s a dress code” He said it so earnestly, Tony had to allow himself a thin little smile. And then, as Tony was scanning the room for his shoes, Steve added “So…when you say this place feels unnatural…”
hurt you…” He paused to wince at that - because, of course, that was the worst one. The nightmare he’d had so many times that sometimes it felt as though he
Steve managed to contain his smile until Tony finally turned, and he could safely close the door behind him-
Usually, Steve liked walking along the beach at night. There was something about the vast, ethereal emptiness of the ocean after dark that made Steve feel small, but in a nice way…
Maybe it was simply that it was familiar. In a world where everything was strange and wrong and required conscious thought, the confines of the war room provided a perverse sort of safe haven. Seventy years hadn’t changed nearly as much about how all this worked as they had everything else. If it weren’t for the holograms that Tony insisted on using at every opportunity, this could have been one of the strategy meetings that the Commandos had been called to in Washington.
A sharp twinge, all the way along his spine, as Steve jerked his hips again, his movement stuttering, his legs tensing against Tony’s thighs.
what we have in store for you,” Scaramouche dismissed him, turning again to the two Rousseaus with a flourish,
And then Tony’s head fell into Steve’s neck, his weight leaning into Steve’s chest, his breathing hot and laboured against Steve’s skin,
He felt the car settle into silence, blinking as he refocused his eyes on the scenery around them - vaguely surprised to find that they’d arrived.
All those nights he’d spent imagining how uncomfortable and nervous Steve must be, asking himself if Steve was cold or hungry or hurt…
“How long have you worked here?” Steve frowned, suddenly, like the thought had just occurred to him.
*Lots* of introspection in this update and, as it mostly takes place in Steve's topsy turvey head, there will again be a little bit of the unreliable narrator at play...
“But what I’m saying is…” Tony tried to start again. “If you’re thinking you stepped out of your lane today… it’s not my lane either. It’s not like you can say the wrong thing to me about being a vampire – because I don’t know what the right thing is either. I don’t really know how any of it works, or what any of it means. So, if you want to ask me whether it’s a good idea, or a dangerous idea, or a… creepy idea, or whatever… You could just as easily ask Bucky. He’d have about as much basis for an opinion on it as I would.”
“Okay, look,” Sam huffed, “I know it wasn’t my best plan. But we didn’t really make a plan, did we? And - go on then, right now, off the top of your head - what
“And… you can’t force someone to be creative.” He sighed, unhappily. “The people they have in the basement, just grinding up beads… maybe you can force people to do work like that, under a sedative. But you can’t drug people into submission and then expect them to push themselves to new discoveries… that… should’ve seemed suspicious earlier, I think…”
… Regardless of whether staying silent was the ‘right thing to do’, recognising that he was allowed to do it was a very important moment.
“This entire building is hooked up to a hydraulic gas release system,” Tony explained, authoritative and mildly impatient. Nat was the first to get over the surprise, her face hardening into concentration again almost immediately – so Tony directed the rest of his speech at her. “Best guess, several places in the building are set up to gas intruders before they can even reach for a weapon. So, you can’t go in there until that system is shut down.”
And, now that he thought about it, it reminded him of the moment he’d walked off stage at that infamous press conference - when, once again, he’d found himself risk-assessing something he’d already done, and asking himself how that whole ‘I am Iron Man’ thing might ripple…
And even as he was telling himself that yes, absolutely, he would do that, just as soon as he’d cleared his head…
“Why are we just saying things?” Steve demanded, purely for fear of what he might say instead. “Being tired and lightheaded from the trip, fine, but this isn’t… that. This isn’t normal. This isn’t even how I talk. Jesus, why can’t I stop talking?” He caught the nervous glance that the Rousseaus threw in Scaramouche’s direction. “What?”
And then Siberia… and all the times he’d woken up gasping and grasping at his chest, never sure if he’d been dreaming about the bunker or if he’d regressed to nightmares about Afghanistan. Just that dull pain in his heart…
wished he hadn’t done that… perhaps a little more forcefully than strictly necessary… Because, by then, Steve had come up with a plan. As a matter of fact, by the time Bucky dropped that bombshell, Steve was entirely preoccupied with his plan, and simply couldn’t muster up the mental energy to worry about anything else.
“Well, that’s my point” Possibly Trish agreed, eagerly. “Already ten per cent of the way through, and you’ve not worked the place out yet. It takes ten days to really
All at once, Steve felt terrible for the few minutes of mundane calm that he had managed. He felt short-sighted and selfish, ashamed to have missed so much of the big picture while he was staring at his own little part of it.
conversations… Steve had started to feel confident that he knew exactly what he wanted from this, and that Tony understood it - they would never have been here, otherwise.
,” Tony announced, decisively, putting both palms out in front of him. “Before we get to the meet and greet - I believe we were up to question,
you into wanting this? What if… I don’t know, what if you’re being influenced now, and neither of us know it?”
And then Tony braced against him, grinding hard into his lap as his body tensed into his orgasm and then trembled into the release of it, a barely audible little whimper falling over his lips - and God, Steve loved that sound-
“Why don’t you try it on,” Tony suggested, as he stood up from the couch. “I’ll be back in a minute.”
. Or, at the very least, making no effort to conceal anything, as he went off on a rant about all the things he wasn’t supposed to know.
“Well, that’s the thing - it doesn’t have to be,” Tony informed him, looking him right in the eye. “But you can’t just turn up on my doorstep and tell me the world is in peril twenty times over, and not expect me to do something. Not if you really know me at all. And since I have to deal with
“Well, some things,” Steve remembered… he liked remembering… “She made great pastry – yes, Captain America’s mom made great apple pie,” and he paused, so that Tony could laugh again. “And, to be fair to her –
But the other issue wasn’t as easy to outrun. The other question just kept echoing in his head as he tried to chit chat with…he was gonna guess Trish? He hadn’t been listening when either of them introduced themselves… He’d been too busy thinking back to breakfast.
And he saw the wry smile that had crept onto Rhodey’s face, the knowing expression in his eyes – Tony knew that Rhodey had an answer to that.
“Big project. Worked too long. Slept too long,” he shorthanded, running a hand through his hair. He knew that Rhodey had seen him do this enough times to know exactly what he was talking about.
“Yeah… I’m hungry, and I’ve been in meetings all morning,” Tony convinced himself as he spoke. “And we should probably start this thing with a clear head…”
“Okay, so, this is how it works…” Tony started, selecting and enhancing a little corner of his hologram – a video of a lumbar puncture procedure.
At some point, he’d been ground down by the fruitless, circular attempts to work out which of his impulses were alarming and which were just perfectly human. In the end, he’d accepted it all as ‘how he felt’-
more, period. I’d try to explain a bit better, I’d try explaining what I would do instead, I’d… Yeah, talk about it all a lot more.”
Pepper jumped to immediate, shocked attention, her mouth literally falling open as she stared at him.
...And then let both hands slide up, slowly folding his arms over the back of Steve’s neck, pulling himself up against his chest-
The almost hallucinations of earlier had worn off, and he’d somewhat settled back into the world around him - but the effects of the flowers still lingered, making everything seem floaty and distant and unreal…
That hopeless feeling, that all of the courage and strength of character in the world were of no use without the power to see it through.
He is separate from the world around him. He is one specific point on a map of time and space. He has an identity. A history.
“Why a map, specifically?” Steve asked Tony directly. Tony simply stared at him for a moment, one eyebrow raised in question. “You didn’t just ask for more information, you asked for a
And, really, it was just that Steve recognised the basic social cues. He took a glass because it was being offered to him… he didn’t think about it…
Steve had constructed all his thoughts and all his actions around those few basic truths. That he would have to walk away from Tony. That, somehow, he’d have to be okay afterwards. That this whole thing was all in
“I have loved you since, oh, about six weeks after I met you, I think?” And Tony said it so casually, that for a second Steve thought he couldn’t
For a moment, Tony was entirely surrendered to that feeling, unable to do anything but let it crash through him, his frame still steeled against the train of sensations-
“Hey, we were just talking about you,” Steve grinned, almost as relieved as the CEO was to have been gifted a way out of this encounter. Almost.
The wordless reverence that Steve had always commanded in Tony’s house, along with the terrible awareness that it must never be said out loud…
don’t know where any of that came from.” And he forced himself to look up at Steve, and Steve had to bite his lip, he was so scared he’d say something he could never take back. “I just…
There was a harmless resistance to leaving his comfortable haze - but no resistance to the world he was coming back into.
And if everything Steve had been through, from 1918 until right this moment, had come to lead him here…
“I’m not going to get high again until I’ve had a chance to think straight about what the hell we’re doing here,” he muttered instead, purely for his own benefit.
himself think about what he was doing, managing to flick the tube of lube open and squeeze a very generous amount of it over his fingers – even
He’d thought that Tony was angry with him, for the risks he took and the mistakes he’d made and the secrets he’d kept.
He clenched his hand a little tighter, more to feel the reality of something against his palm than to disperse any of the building adrenaline. He’d trashed a hundred punching bags before he’d convinced himself that
were there, essentially, I just… know that you’d have found out about Hydra, and Bucky, and all of that, if I’d not gotten there first – I always knew that. You were trying to investigate SHIELD when I first met you… when I told you off for… I just… Think, sometimes, that if I’d just…died, in that crash… then all the things I helped to do would still have happened – but maybe not the things I broke-”
Now he realised that he had been actively holding onto his anger and pain. That he hadn’t wanted to ‘get over it’, or ‘move on’. That he didn’t want any of it to be
Well. Tony would be devastated, and he wasn’t pretending otherwise. But, even then, last night would still have meant something.
...Sitting in a safehouse, working on his own long-winded plan to find Bucky, just waiting for Loki to turn up… Still dreaming of the day that he could win Tony’s trust.
It was a perfect snapshot of Tony… His eyes wide and playful, his lips full and almost smiling, his whole body framed by sunlight like a halo…
“...Okay,” Steve replied, looking up at Sam for any additional clues - and finding only an irritable sort of resignation.
Steve’s eyes snapped up to fix Peirce’s in a steely glare. He didn’t even have time to remind himself that this was the head of World Security - the reaction was instant.
And, I get it Steve, I do. I get that you’re scared of not being perfect and letting people down. I know why you’re scared of opening up to him and losing him. And I
been toying with the idea of going to Afghanistan. As much as he would have hated watching Tony suffer, and as hard as it would be not to tear the head off of every terrorist in that cave, part of Steve felt like it might be good for him to
going to ask what’s going on with you, when you wake up,” Bucky warned him again, “So, I dunno, you might want to make it twelve.”
And Steve had the most powerful sense of clarity. This unexplainable, unmistakable feeling that he was
Tony sighed. Even in his state of semi-inebriation, he knew it was a pretty crude plan, and likely to end in disaster…
His efforts to avoid Tony had been pretty half-assed, but they did at least stop Steve from actively planning his entire day around where Tony might be. It meant he couldn’t justify going up to the labs for no reason, or going to the breakroom in the middle of the night - not if he was
version of Natasha would never exist again. Not to him. All things going to plan, he and Nat would never take on the whole of Hydra together. They most certainly wouldn’t be collaborating on a two year search for Bucky, or going on the run together. There wasn’t going to be a universal apocalypse for them to live through together. As much as he hoped that he would get to write a different story with a different Natasha, that he would get to become her friend all over again, he knew the friendship they once had would die with her.
“Oh my God, yes, we should do that.” She announced, turning to her partner – who was obviously completely out of it. He was swaying slightly on his feet, his eyes heavy, staring through her as she spoke.
It left Steve feeling like he was the centre of the universe, and also like he just wasn’t the point of what was happening. Like he was the most important person in existence, and like he didn’t matter at all-
go with the tried and tested approach that’d gotten him through at least five potential apocalypses. The things he’d been taught as a child, and therefore came naturally. The
“I never spoke to anyone about it,” Wesley blurted, deliberately stepping behind the door. Steve put a firm hand out, pushing it open another inch.
He held his breath for a moment and strained to listen for sounds of movement on the other side of the bathroom wall, but the water was loud enough to drum out all but the sounds of his imagination.
“... I don’t know what the hell my life is going to look like in ten years time… or a hundred,” Steve accepted, sadly. “And I don’t know what this bond is, or how it works, or how it would change either of us. And I’m sorry. If I’d known any of this before I was already in it - if I’d known what the hell I was talking about, ever…”
in all these almost-recollections… Some abstract pattern that kept disappearing when he grabbed for it…
that Bucky really had forgotten about the tests, at least for a moment. That he wasn’t anxious – that he’d actually felt comfortable enough to let his mind drift to other things. Steve knew that would never have happened on the ride over to any of their previous doctors.
It seemed somewhat ominous if Tony had decided to come back so early, especially without texting Steve first…
When he didn’t make a comment about Captain America being a real disappointment, or immediately demand that someone more confident be put in charge – when he did, in fact, just shrug in an,
And yes, it was immediate and physical and overpowering - but it wasn’t strange or supernatural, like it was last night.
The sudden swell of inexplicable enthusiasm was almost enough to just push that question over Steve’s lips – but, thankfully, Tony carried on before Steve could manage it.
Tony thought, petulantly. Even putting himself in Steve’s position like that hadn’t led him to empathise with
“That.” Tony suggested dramatically “Is probably a question we should better consider when we are not drug fucked.”
-And, oh, the way the blood rushed up Steve’s neck, the way his eyes flashed, how full and perfect his lips were right now…
made, the events that didn’t fit his chosen narrative – the arguments that hadn’t made the grade, when he was cherry picking the one’s that suited him.
“Because it doesn’t mean anything,” Steve answered, with a little more passion in his voice. “There is no actual criteria for that word. People just use it to describe things that they don’t like, or that are outside of their comfort zone. Except that, if they said,
But then SHIELD fell, and there were all those new questions and anxieties to keep him from drifting off…
Steve pushed into him again, hard and sharp, the second shock running up Tony’s spine while he was still reeling from the first-
Steve’s fingers curled tighter around Tony’s torso, simply responding to this sudden possessive impulse, this desire to keep… This automatic response to feeling Tony move like
There would always be a Tony Stark who lived through all that pain and never got the ending he deserved. A man who was every bit as beautiful as the man Steve was looking at now… But different. Different even to the man that
“And you think you’d be able to tell?” Bucky asked, squinting at a sting of alien hieroglyphs on the wall.
remember doing that, but it had all happened to fast and in such unreal clarity, it didn’t feel as though it had happened at all.
Breaking societal conventions on sex and relationships and even letting someone drink his blood was one thing. And hey, Steve knew this little episode wasn’t going to make it into any of the comic books, and there were plenty of his self-proclaimed fans who’d be shocked by his behaviour – and he really didn’t care.
And all the while there was still that constant pressure against his throat; that reassuring caress that moved in time with his racing heartbeat.
And these were basically the words he’d used to apologise for lying to Tony. The tone he’d used whenever he’d talked about the whole thing. And Steve really hadn’t
Grinning now, Steve popped the pill into his mouth and swallowed it - allowing himself to drift into the calm that followed.
But then he bumped into Bucky on the third floor landing – and immediately recognised that Bucky was in uniform.
Steve would’ve liked to be outraged by Scaramouche’s casual arrogance - but he was too busy warning himself to
He’d have liked to have another go at it, really. To say some of the things he’d spent the last two hours wishing he’d said the first time…
A good old-fashioned Earth based sedative, this time. A little something that Tony had thrown together from the leftovers of his chemistry experiment, from a formula he’d learned a very long time ago. It knocked Maribelle out cold within a second of Steve putting the cloth to her face, and she just slumped as a dead weight into the wall behind her. Steve guided her gently to a sitting position on the floor, checking her pulse and her breathing before he stood up again. Then he gave Tony a little nod. She wouldn’t wake up again for at least six hours. Even if someone found her, and even if they assumed anything more than a medical problem, they wouldn’t be able to get any details out of her.
being drawn back into all his memories of Steve… And realising how still Steve was when he was sleeping, and how cool his skin was, and, yes, how long he could hold his breath for…
“Jesus, you’re so wet,” Tony whispered, as he ran his hand over the length of him. There was a delightfully guilty shiver over his skin as Tony pulled his cock free, exposing him to the air.
“Yeah, I’m up. One minute” Steve called back. He stood up, and ran his fingers through his hair, and smoothed down yesterdays T-shirt. He took a deep breath.
have been weird if, when I was twenty, my dad had suddenly decided to leave everything to me because he wanted to spend a few extra months having public sex with my mother.”
...That you simply couldn’t plan things like that, around someone like Tony. He was just too different, too far ahead, too brilliant to be planned for.
Tony concluded that that was probably the saddest part of the whole fucking thing and grabbed one of the shirts at random. The black one. And then he’d reminded himself that it really didn’t matter and resolved not to think about it again.
that Tony curled his fingers around it... the slightest hint of extra grip, the drag of Tony’s thumb over his palm…
want, or the reasons he wanted, or the complexities of where this came from and what it would mean, afterwards… In that moment, Tony knew exactly what he wanted, and he wanted it very simply – and this just wasn’t it.
that no good would come from letting Other Steve wake up, and panic, and confront the mysteries of the universe - simply to go back to the same place and the same time, either way. Especially as there would be no time to sensitively explain everything…
He looked over at the corner of the room where his bag was hidden, tucked away behind a box of eye drops.
There were now far too many disasters on Tony’s to-do list for him to be obsessing over an ancient grudge with SHIELD…
And it annoyed Tony that Steve was ignoring his feelings, and, suddenly, it annoyed him that Steve just wasn’t taking no for an answer. That he was forcing Tony to make a choice between giving Steve his own way, or telling Steve to shut up – for which he would no doubt be blamed.
“I swear to God, I don’t know,” Wesley answered, literally throwing his palms up in front of him. “They-I- I mean, I- I got into some trouble, last year. Gambling, you know. And I owed some money. And then one day, out of the blue, this guy just calls me, and says how would I like to earn half a million bucks. So, I don’t know, maybe he knows the guys I owe money to - but he didn’t even tell me his name! I didn’t know who I was working for until the camera turned up, and there was a company logo on the shipping label - I don’t even know if they’re the same people!”
…And, actually, if he was going to be in the house for another five minutes, he might as well set up an additional contingency-
” Steve carried on “I remember regretting it at the time, and thinking it wasn’t the wording I was going for there. That it must’ve seemed like… like you
Steve could be snarky and sarcastic at times, sure - but only ever in defence of a moral good, or when he was in too much of a temper to keep it in. Casually joking that he didn’t like a guy was more like something that Bucky would do… and then Steve would’ve gotten
He’d come here with a hot mess of irrational thoughts and a churning of conflicting emotions, not sure himself whether he wanted to rage or cry or just lie down in a darkened room – knowing he wanted
Steve was - what this love was, what was the right thing to do about it. He still wasn’t sure whether it was selfish, or reckless, or wrong for some reason beyond his understanding… but he had at least worked out that he never could be. And Tony had come to think that ignoring his feelings for Steve would be as risky and heartless as following through with them-
It was a drab sort of a place, with scuff marks along the skirting board and worn patches in the carpets. The couch took up one whole wall of the tiny living room/kitchen area, and one corner of the bed was propped up on an old paint can - in short, it was not the sort of place that Tony would usually have stayed.
It was a low, humming sort of energy, the kind he was barely aware of but that somehow kept him from sitting still. By late afternoon he’d fallen into that strange grey area where he was both tired and full of adrenaline, his legs throbbing gently with exertion and still rebelling against rest.
” Tony barked, like it was a swearword, or a prayer. And then there was the tight, searing heat of Steve’s finger, pushing inside him. “Oh, God-”
“You know what? I’m being ridiculous” He tried instead, exhaling heavily. “No point in talking to me when I get like this. You should wait for me to calm down. I’m sorry. I’m just upset. We should go.” He was already heading towards the door. “Come on, we’re going to be late.”
And then an unbearable guilt and grief hit him like a wall of water, as he finally realised what that meant for
, I’m attempting to design, program and integrate a secondary spinal cord? Well, no, that’s not a good metaphor-”
Having gone through the list of possibilities, Steve had concluded that this almost detached, physical mood wasn’t anything to do with any of that - but that he did now have all of those things to worry about as well, thanks.
– as he climbed on top of the covers, still fully clothed. And Steve grinned, and crawled onto the bed, just about managing to kick his shoes off before he collapsed into the mattress beside Tony. Tony wriggled closer, and Steve pulled him in, letting him settle into that space against his chest that he so perfectly fit.
He froze, his muscles still tensed in anticipation of standing, and watched as a 21 year old Bucky strolled across his field of vision, his head slightly lowered, one of his braces about to slide off of his shoulder…
And it was only Tony’s absolute responsibility to stay in control that pulled him back into the room.

It felt like too much of a liberty to dream that one day they might really be able to talk about other things. That they’d ever get back the friendship they’d once had, much less be able to build something more than that…
, Steve knew that he wasn’t supposed to tell Tony he loved him. It was like muscle memory now, a process that just happened… the frustration of it was so familiar… this was just ‘that reason’ that everything was so difficult, the natural law that meant he could never explain…
He heard Tony squeal with laughter, just behind him. Out of the corner of his eye he could see Bucky throwing his head back, exactly the same way he used to when he was a little boy. Sam snorted in surprise, a string of giggles pouring free after it.
Breaking the lock wasn’t easy – it took two full-force kicks to loosen the mechanism, and even then Steve had to put a lot of effort into pulling it apart. The whole time Tony was hovering there behind him, already in fight stance, subconsciously trying to shield Steve as much as he could.
“Because not everyone can fly it,” Steve answered, trying to ignore that same dark possessiveness that was trying to push up through his chest. “People think you can just step into it and
Bucky straighten up in confusion, without even looking at him. But Steve resolved not to look at him, not to draw attention to anything Bucky was thinking or give away anything that was in his own head. He just kept his eyes locked on Jesse, as Jesse continued to monologue,
“...I’ve heard that word before,” Steve murmured, pursing his lips as though he was repeating it in his head.
“Well, they’re going to know in a day or so, if I’ve played Nick right” Steve shrugged, bashfully. “And… I don’t know, I guess I’m starting to see the benefit of being a bit more flexible with my plans. I mean, if you want to…”
“Is this about The Avengers?” And, when Tony raised an eyebrow at her, hastily added, “Which I.. I know nothing about…”
And he saw Steve try to smile, a little shake of his head and the slightest shrug of his shoulders –
asked Tony to forgive him, he’d asked to come home – and, now that he was here, he had to figure out what he was going to say about all of that stuff. Or not.
It was how long he’d been scared of thinking that. It was the wordless feeling of responsibility he’d carried since 2016, knowing that he’d talked so many other people into sharing his point of view. Knowing that he could never change his mind, even hypothetically, without casting the same judgement on all of his friends - friends who wouldn’t have been in that mess in the first place, if it weren’t for him. That shadowy understanding was the reason his regrets were still so ominous and murky. It was the reason he couldn’t talk about that particular trauma to anyone.
have liked - loved, even - had things worked out differently… Even if they were objectively ‘good’ people, even if they still liked him, even if they had done so much for him in another life… What if he still just didn’t like them all that much?
There was a dull spike of guilt as Tony scrambled to kneel beside the photographer - although whether it was because he might’ve ignored a man with a brain haemorrhage, or because he’d left Steve’s side, Tony wasn’t sure.
Saw this whole alternative view of his life… this world in which he could just be a part of something, where he was allowed to be human, and happy…
ALSO - again, I appreciate that this update is only telling one side of the story. I would just like to reassure people that the other side of this conversation is going to happen, from both party's point of view. Also, as much as I think Steve probably would have a strong reaction to all of this - please remember that he is on drugs here, is all I'm saying... (not that I'm nervous about this update, or anything...)
In fact, for the first time since he was a teenager, Steve didn’t bully himself out of bed. He actually pulled the duvet back up over his head, and closed his eyes again - and let himself be sad…
It was gone the moment he saw Steve look at him, of course. But still, Steve knew now that Tony felt sorry for Bucky. That Tony felt sorry for
Partly, it was the legitimate nervousness he always felt on Bucky’s behalf during medical procedures – especially when it came to sedation, and pain relief.
Immediately, it reminded him of the aimless, melodramatic misery of his youth. It made him think of a time when he wasn’t obliged to rationalise and compartmentalise every emotion, a time when he
on behalf of a company – because people will remember every word of that statement. They’ll be able to use snippets of it against you in court later, if you ever contradict it. The brand will suffer, because people will forever associate your admissions with your name, it’ll mean you can never reach that standard again…” Tony went on.
that he’d reached his limit so much as simply found himself there. Whether it was right or wrong, it seemed that further analysis would just
And maybe it would calm him down, if he actually managed to focus on something for more than a few minutes. Maybe he’d feel better if he achieved
The very few times Tony had been in love before - or, at least, thought he was - it had always been a sensible, gradual thing. Something that developed as his affection and trust and comfort grew. Something he was always aware of, something he could comprehend.
It still wasn’t anything like the mental break he’d had the night Obie bit him, when Tony found himself screaming words that hadn’t gone via his head. It wasn’t like the day that he’d finally snapped and kicked Obie out of the house forever, his head entirely numb even as he was throwing things at the doorframe. Both of those times, Tony had essentially stepped outside of his own body, into a dizzying, terrifying freefall of pure feeling-
But, as it was, Steve slid that glass panel back into its slot – and accidently ran the edge of it over his fingers.
“The thing is… I used to have all these rules. Why I couldn’t even let someone new into my house. Why I could
… Whereas the rest of the building was just warming up to heavy petting and unbuttoned shirts, the air in this room was already full of urgent moaning and that scent of human bodies.
“Well, for a start, I’m feeling so completely different to how I’ve ever felt before,” Tony started, at last. “So different from how I ever thought I
“Tell you what, let’s look for anything that also mentions a ‘mortal blessing’, or the name Ahreddan…” He added, as a whole other idea started unfolding…

did, but I know it isn’t… and even if it was, I know not saying anything isn’t… I know it must seem like I just never stood up for you ever, I’m not saying I wish I didn’t have to stand up for you, or that I don’t want to, I just… I wish I just could, without it being…”
he was asking you about it?” He demanded, his voice darker now. Tony did his best to swallow the heat that was trying to rise up in his chest.
, apparently.” Tony explained, putting the tray down on the table. Steve picked one up, and saw that the clear liquid was shimmering with silver glitter. He shrugged, and swallowed it in a single mouthful. It was sharp, and slightly metallic, and he didn’t really like it much – but at least it wasn’t sweet.
“Well… We could always say that, as we are both such busy, pressured people, that actually our perfect fantasy is to just sit very quietly in a room doing nothing for a few hours.” Tony suggested, self-consciously. “Peacefully sharing each other’s company – with clothes on.”
think about it now - that he had a capacity for rational thought and a control over his reactions that had simply been beyond him last night… A capacity and control that he might lose again at any time, apparently.
Steve’s desperation for a moment, rather than getting caught up in it himself. Steve could feel that Tony was still completely in control, so solid and warm and strong in Steve’s arms – and Jesus, that just made Steve
That was probably the one moment when Steve got to recognise what a horrible violation it was. In those few fleeting seconds he’d been so very aware that every phone call he made from his apartment, every time he cried, every time he jerked off, Nicky Fury was recording it. That if he ever
And the sudden thrill of Tony’s skin on his was overwhelming. It shot through Steve’s arm and made his shoulders feel weak. Tony was only able to pull him along so easily because Steve’s legs had turned to jelly. All he could feel was the warmth of Tony’s palm against his, and his fingers wrapped around his hand-
know who we are… they can’t find it that weird that we’d be curious about it? And – not to give any full names away, or anything – but I know a few people here are in pharmaceuticals. We
He made a genuine effort to pay attention to that one. Like he knew he wouldn’t be allowed to play at all if he didn’t listen to the safety briefing.
knew that there was so much confusion and anxiety and doubt in amongst that barrage of revelations, and he knew they would all come crashing into his too-conscious mind all at once and far too noisily…
A wave of heat crashed over him, his hips snapping up instinctively as the rest of him tensed still. Every frustration bloomed out into a deep, satisfied pleasure, all at once. A thousand different sparks and shivers and ripples of sensation rolled together, all pulled into that same pulsing,
a few passages, buried in amongst the laughable science and sinister folklore, that actually… helped him to think. Gave him alternative theories to look into.
Tony gets shot, and nearly dies. There is a lot of Tony's emotional reaction to this, as well as how it physically feels to get weaker, although the actual wound/injury is not described in detail - there are, however, a lot of mentions of blood.
The wave of gratitude and wonder and promise that overwhelmed Tony – to be alive, to have saved Steve that heartache-
that everyone just takes that for granted, how lovely to just be assumed the good guy. But, oh, wait, turns out
As he led Steve back towards the car, Tony tried to get his various observations in order… But already, that focus was slipping-
Steve laughed softly, his whole body relaxing with it. He realised that actually talking to Tony wasn’t nearly as difficult as thinking about it had been. Steve felt a gentle stirring of hope, that maybe he was finally finding his feet with this thing-
He followed Steve’s movements as though they’d rehearsed this a thousand times, as though every part of this was already carved into his muscle memory, into his most basic assumptions. He pushed his weight up onto his knees, and parted his legs, and lowered his head…
