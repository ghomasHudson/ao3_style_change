He could just put it on the back burner for a while like he'd managed to do today. Being surrounded by the people that love him makes it a little bit easier to cope. To know that these people knew what he'd done and still loved him for everything he was and all that he was worth meant more to him than he thinks anyone could imagine. It made him feel... Human, knowing that these people saw him for more than what he was and what he could do.
"What about Wanda? Do you think she could help?"
All of the other kids started yelling at her to shut up, so Wade let off a round into the ceiling. It made them all jump, but Peter was almost totally unresponsive. Wade could easily tell that this girl didn't want to be a part of this, so he decided to strike a deal. He'd let her off easy if she helped him out.
Bucky ran up the stairs as fast as he could, taking them two at a time to go even faster. He couldn't believe it took him so long to figure it out! He threw open the apartment door and Nat's quick reaction meant he had a gun pointed at his head, but he paid no mind. He took two large breaths and looked over at Steve. "I know what he meant! I get it! I can't believe it took me so long."
"You're damn right I am! If you had left him here like I told you to, he'd be fine!"
"I don't want to get rid of it." He whispered.
Wade pointed at Peter in agreement. "You got me there."
Even though he wouldn't be a bother at all.
Peter continued to stare blankly at the photos in his hand for a very long time. He could see May standing across the room, with her hands in the pockets of her sundress. She was smiling, for some fucking reason. How could she be so fucking happy about this? This could be the end of Peter completely.
"That's it, come on baby..." Steve purred against Bucky's lips. Bucky, who was far past speaking, sputtered something in Russian as he pulled impossibly closer. "I've got you Bucky..."
, 3 different waterproof liquid eyeliners,
The room was nearly silent, no sounds filling the air but Bucky's cries and the grinding of the metal plates in his arm. He'd balled up his fist, and Steve knew he was angry, but Bucky looked like he was ready to speak, so he stayed silent to let him do so.
Peter whimpered. Tony was only a couple of feet away now.
If only they knew then that it wasn't that kind of sickness.
This was the way to restore some of that self-confidence that Bucky struggled with so often. Knowing that even after all they'd been through and all The Winter Soldier had done, Steve still wanted him and loved him and found him attractive was enough sometimes.
Tony let out an exasperated sigh, "Do we really have to do this now?"
The old him pulled aside a picture frame on the wall and opened a small hatch, then the memory was gone. Peter, more curious than ever, carefully stood from his chair and made his way to the picture. In it he saw the woman, May, then in memory, he saw her again,
When Bucky awoke, the first thing he noticed was the throbbing pain in his head, then all at once, the pain from all over his body hit him like waves beating against rocks on the shore. His legs ached and his chest felt heavy, and above all of that, his arm was on fucking fire. When he looked down, he felt the panic rise in him like bile when he saw that it was gone, no trace of the vibranium in sight.
Their names plagued his tongue like the copper taste of blood and drove him mad with the longing of who they used to be. He believed them both to be gone, and in a way they were. He remembers the day that the woman in the photo passed away. Her life was burdened with wars she knew that she couldn't win and a life that she could never have beaten, and she was taken not by men but by sickness uncured.
That's what he was doing now. Sitting with Tony in his lab watching over the last known footage of May. They'd combed through 62 hours of footage so far, and there was no sign so far of what happened to her... Until Tony paused the bit of footage he was looking at on his laptop. You could see the conflict on his face.
"No, I... I couldn't bear the thought of them having you too. I couldn't..." Bucky's face contorted into one of disgust, or anger, or sadness, or all of the above as he cupped Steve's cheek. "When I realized they didn't have you, I was glad... Stevie, I was glad that it was me instead of you. I was glad they couldn't hurt you."
All he could do was watch, breathing heavily as the blood seeped from his arm and dripped down to the floor. He screamed. It was all he could do. The sting in his arm intensified as the blood continued to flow. He heard Wade laugh as the little girl smeared the blood up his arm and across his face. Her laughter turned to screaming. Harsh, angry, loud screaming. There were no words, just her high-pitched voice piercing his ears.
Peter didn't quite enjoy being spoken about as if he weren't standing there and while he momentarily forgot that the two people before him were the King and Princess of Wakanda, he made sure to let them know it.
Bucky shakes his head, strands of long hair falling into his face. "I used to tell Peter stories about the things I remembered. Things from being Him. The tactics I used to use, the places I used to go."
It took all of his willpower not to bust right then and there, really. He kept bobbing his head, taking down more and more of Peter's member as he went, causing the boy to whine around his own length in return. Wade reached between them and felt Peter grab onto his hand. And he let him hold it.
for it. He wanted it all to be over. He wanted to be free of this hell. He wasn't sure how long he'd been here anymore. The torture made all of the days and nights blend together into a meaningless film, tightly wrapped around his life.
Pictures were hanging crookedly on the walls, and the first thing Steve could bring himself to do was straighten them out. His mother would be appalled at the display of crooked photos, and he had to honor her somehow. Steve remembered exactly how he'd left the apartment when he'd been here last, so it was easy to pick out what Bucky had moved when he'd been here so long ago.
Peter thanked him softly and wiped his tears before continuing with Okoye to the lab.
Peter understood what it was and nodded slowly, glancing to Wade. Wade pulled his mask up to give him a soft smile and with that, Peter went into the bathroom. Wade turned to Nat, who stared ahead while she picked at her nails.
Peter's nearly a quarter of the way through his sandwich when he speaks again, this time quietly asking Wade what they did to him back at Hydra. The merc shakes his head. "They can kill me sure, but I won't stay dead. They thought it was hilarious just killing me over and over again. They didn't even ask me anything, really. Just needed a laugh I suppose. Who better to laugh at than the comedy experiment, huh?"
Truthfully though, if one of his friends had been there, he probably wouldn't have had anything to drink at all and would have never been in this situation in the first place. Wade scratched his brow and sighed. If he'd been here in the first place nothing would have happened either. He chose work over coming to the party, and now the consequences were getting to his head.
"Then I want you to be good for me, and get down on your knees."
He looked to Natalia who was smiling widely, then back to Steve who was now holding a small box and without even seeing the ring inside, Bucky threw himself at Steve sputtering 'yes's' through his tears.
Tony rolled his eyes and sighed loudly, running his fingers through his hair. "No baby, I don't think you're stupid, I'm sorry. I'm just stressed."
Gasp! A double update has appeared!
"Mr. Barnes, then, I-" The man paused and wiped his hands on his sweat-stained jacket before excusing himself from the room. Too tired to pursue him, Bucky just sighed and turned to look at Peter's now nearly entirely healed face. It was no secret he had his powers back, especially now.
The doors at the end of the hall burst open, revealing an exhausted looking Peter Parker, with Natasha in tow. Sam was sure that this would spell trouble, and he knew he was right the minute the web-slinger threw himself up against the glass wall that separated him from them. "Stop it! Stop it, leave him alone!"
Each new strike was like a pebble into water, a ripple that crossed his whole body. Yet he refused to fight back. Sam Wilson, AKA The Falcon, and Wanda Maximoff, AKA Scarlet Witch, had never done anything to Wade before. Even now they were just doing their jobs.
:(((( nobody said the trip down memory lane was a fun one )))):
"Why do you think I did something to him?" Wade asked as he brushed Peter's hair out of his face. He could feel Peter's pulse beating steadily at his temple.
Bucky and Steve are watching with fond eyes and hearts as she treats him gently and patiently. He was still a person, and she was treating him like one. She was being calm and answering his questions to the best of her ability. When he asks where he got the mp3 player from, a voice from the door provides that he provided it.
Bucky runs his fingers through Tony's hair a couple of times before resting his metal hand on the back of Tony's head. Tony doesn't resist as Bucky guides his face into his crotch until he's smushed against the denim tent at the front of Bucky's jeans. Bucky always got off on having power in the bedroom, but he also really got off on taking care of his lovers. Right now Tony needed a little bit of hard love and a quick attitude change.
The terminology made Tony stutter and blush in both embarrassment and anger at the same time. This marks the first time Bucky has ever used sucking dick as a threat that Tony didn't like. He looked shocked and glanced to Bruce who said nothing.
He rounded another corner but stopped short. Just across the open space in front of him was Bucky over the body of an agent. He was holding a large knife and every few seconds, he would raise it and plunge it deep into the agent's chest... The only problem was, that agent looked way past dead.
Steve scooted closer, curling his wide body into itself as he sat at Bucky's feet. "What are you talking about?"
Tony just shook his head and shifted his weight before looking up at the blonde. "My old man put a lot of effort into trying to find you, you know? He searched for a long time. He knew you were alive somewhere out there. And he was waiting for you to find your way back... Your building was gonna be demolished. He bought the whole thing, made sure everything was still inside, and then he left it alone... Aunt Peggy said it was because he wanted you to have somewhere to go when you got back."
Nat laughed softly as she strode over in her silk slip. "Maybe." She leaned up and started kissing along Steve's jaw as she slipped down onto her knees between him and the counter.
Peter made him promise that he wouldn't leave him alone, and he did. He kept ahold of the boy's hand, not even letting go when Strange entered the room in scrubs. Something told him that someone alerted him of the boy's state and either asked him or let him decide to take the time to look as normal as possible.
They wanted him to go to parties and sandwich shops and to spend weekends with his friends. They wanted him to have the freedom that he didn't have here. They wanted him to have chores and an allowence and maybe even a pet if he wanted. But they didn't want to keep him fron Tony. Even if they weren't all getting along at present, Tony was still part of Peter's family, and they wouldn't be the people to keep them apart.
"Sam! Sam, hey, what happened?"
Peter liked being out because he could be in his own bubble but still be out somewhere. And despite the noise of the city, Peter knew how to make it quiet.
Now it's Wade's turn to have pink cheeks and Peter just smiles. He feels fond of this man and the things that he remembers and he's grateful that Wade does even if he doesn't. Peter thanks the murderous maniac with too much time and money before gently laying it down on the bed behind them. Wade is quick to offer Peter the next bag and the boy wonders aloud if all of these gifts have the same kind of meaning to them.
Peter felt his heart drop impossibly lower. Tony laid no claim to him as a child, this he already suspected. But to hear it out loud was another matter all on its own. In his already weakened state, his spirit was being crushed and torn apart by one of the few people he trusted to keep him safe... Maybe there was no such thing as safe anymore...
Actually, maybe more dead than that even, considering that Steve might want to kill him three or four times on his own.
With Peter at school the next day, Tony made his way to Steve in the gym. Steve didn't seem to be too happy that he was there, but Tony knew that he was listening nonetheless.
He let his eyes travel down his chest and to his side, where the wound was. He let out a long breath that hurt him so badly he whimpered. Finally alone, he could let out all the pained noises he'd been keeping in.
dedicated to @RandomSadist
He just wanted his baby safe, no matter what it took. No matter if he wasn't his baby just yet. He would be, Wade knew it. He had to. It was the only way that this could work. The only way!
I'm so sorry I'm just now getting a new chapter to you, life has been crazy with family stuff, and I moved! I really hope you guys are still out there wanting to read this. I love you guys, and this story is for you.
"Yes Wade, I'm all yours... Make me yours, Wade, please." Peter was nothing short of begging, and with the lustful look in his eye, Wade just couldn't say no.
Peter wasn't sure where Wade was going with this, so he just nodded and allowed the large (and heavy) box to be sat in his lap. He wasn't sure how the thing was being held together with all the weight inside of it.
Peter stopped dead in his tracks. Ned was sure he'd have broken his neck if he turned around any faster. Now, until this point, it could never be said that Peter Parker had ever mistreated his school books or physically harmed another student. At this moment, however, Peter dropped his books and threw himself forward.
Peter was told to stand and clean the knife before putting it back down, and he did so without question. He heard a zipper and glanced over to see it was Rumlow unzipping his pants and Peter could still feel the ache in his ass and thighs from what happened last night and he wasn't sure he could handle that again so quickly, but if he wanted to survive, he had to adapt.
"Hey. I've got it."
Thinking maybe that Peter was cold, he looked for another blanket. He wouldn't find one of course, not a good one. He touched Peter's neck and felt that he wasn't cold, but hot, and that worried him more.
Peter had endured worse pains before, but this one stung with each breath he took. It ached with every move he made. Each time he stepped, the pain traveled up his side, beating within him like a second pulse. Each time he breathed, when his chest expanded, his wound collapsed in on itself, the stitches pulling tighter. It was like a black hole with a barrier, forever trying to fold in on itself but never being able to.
. He wasn't any kind of worried about killing a man in the house of God in the slightest, and that made Bucky worry.
Nat tried the switch and there was a crackling noise above their heads before the lights came on, slowly illuminating an old life that no longer existed, between two men that never came home from the war. She watched their faces as they took in the sight of the room around them. It was almost like a museum with how old everything was. The rickety old bed, the worn out armchairs, the scuffed table. There were still yellowing newspapers stacked by the fireplace.
From the way Peter looked at their hands, Wade thought he might feel it too. Peter did feel it, and he felt his spidey-senses telling him that Wade was a bad idea, but for just one moment, he didn't care. He was hurt and sad and scared and he just wanted it all to go away and if it meant using Wade then so be it.
There wasn't any shortage of anything to listen to, as the list ranged from The Cranberries to Wham! and everything in-between.
He looked around trying to find where her voice was coming from.
Peter looks back to the screen. "Okay, so does it work like a skip code?"
Peter went to kneel down next to Wade's extremely dead body, but Rumlow pointed the gun at him, urging him not to move, lest he want to be shot too.
The day spent with Mr. Stark and Pepper was nice. They went shopping and Pepper made sure to help Peter sort his things into his own bags so he wouldn't accidentally leave without something of his.
Peter nodded and took a breath. It didn't take him long to calm down enough for Wade to finish pushing in, and when he bottomed out they both moaned. Watching Peter's face was like a goddamn blessing that Wade didn't feel like he deserved.
"He betrayed you!" Bucky all but cries over his shoulder at Steve. Tears had made their way to his face. He didn't want to be a killer anymore, but Tony betrayed two of the only people he cared about in this world, and he had to pay for it. He had to. "He's never been my favorite... To me, he's just a scientific piece of scum, but the two of ya cared for him, so I did my best, but he's betrayed ya both now, and it's my job to protect you! What the hell m'I good for if I can't protect you?"
Bruce moves to step forward and it makes Bucky's grip twitch, effectively cutting off that one little bit of airflow Tony'd had left. Nat blocks Bruce's path, fully aware that him entering the room would be a fucking bad idea.
Wade turned back into the bathroom and let off a round just beside one of the boy's heads. One of the girls was crying, nearly begging for her life. One of the other boys was begging that they be let go, but the sleazy one that said drugging Peter was 'no big deal' was just smirking. Wade asked him if he thought any of this was fucking funny, and he just laughed, being too high to comprehend what was happening. Wade had had enough.
MJ looked up when the bathroom door opened and Wade came out of it. Behind him, all of the kids began filing out of the bathroom, all looking afraid from their lives. One of the girls was shaking, and the sleazy one was covered in blood. It looked like it was his own. The kids all sprinted out of the front door and Wade crouched down by Peter, who was awake once again awake, but still mostly unresponsive.
He found Peter in his room, staring blankly at the wall. He sighed. "Hey, Pete?"
After lunch, Wade and Peter sat on opposite ends of the couch to watch a movie on Peter's laptop. Wade honestly wanted nothing more right now than to pull Peter in close and kiss the top of his fluffy hair, but he didn't move a muscle.
Steve laughed and stood up straighter. "I can't promise it'll go over the best with Tony, but I asked him to be civil... Everyone inside has someone, I figure it's only fair for you to have your someone too."
Peter doesn't realize just how much he left behind when he went away, and he's just now starting to see what his life was like before.
It didn't seem to be the response that Stark was looking for. Bucky could tell by the way his eyes widened farther and he began to claw at his metallic grasp. Bucky lifted him up so his kicking feet barely scraped the floor. Stark started to struggle harder, but it was quickly becoming clear that the more he fought, the harder Bucky gripped onto his throat. The old Bucky, The Winter Soldier, wouldn't have even taken this long to end Stark, but the closer he got to taking the life out of Stark, the less inclined he felt to do it.
Steve's cheeks heated up, and he felt like he was sixteen again and nearing a panic attack because Bucky said he loved him for the first time. He remembers clutching his chest while he fought to pull air into his lungs, but he also remembers the panic on Bucky's face realizing that the shock could literally have killed Steve then... Steve likes to pick on him for it, even now.
Peter gave him a smile as he opened the package and popped a piece of pop-tart into his mouth.
Nat sat there with him for a little while before placing a much needed call to a number that she took from Peter's phone. It rang a couple of times, but once the call started, she wasted no time in speaking.
Once Bucky had collected himself, he sat back down, toolbox in his arms as he watched Steve pass out more gifts. Bucky was very content to watch rather than participate. He didn't even mind Peter and Wade cuddling up to one another like they were... As long as they were both here, he could keep an eye on them and make sure they stayed out of trouble, especially after what Natalia told him...
Steve kept his arm around Bucky and still held his hand as he walked him from the room. Natalia joined them on their walk, an arm slung around Bucky, leaning on him while they made their way out and down the hall to their bedroom.
Bucky looked up from the floor and held eye contact with Steve for a long moment before he spoke again. His voice was quivering and he hated it, but it had to be said. "Peter's clues were right... And we were there... And he was right below us. The whole time, he was there and we just left him."
Especially not while he was stuck remembering such difficult things...
But Tony Stark? All Tony Stark had was brains and money. What was so scary about that? Sure, Stark could buy Peter's whole block in Queens in under five minutes, and his tech was out of this fucking world, but Tony Stark wasn't scary. Not to anybody. No, Tony Stark was rude and arrogant and irrational. Wade began seriously wondering what Tony Stark had done to scare Peter.
It was a burn that brought color to the surface of the skin, his blood rising to a boil in his veins. Peter's touch set him on fire and sent his heartbeat rushing like water down a stream. Peter's touch hurt. It made Wade's chest hurt. His heart beat on his ribs like a bird inside a cage that felt every miserable thump when it tried to escape. Peter's touch made his head hurt. All of the thoughts bounced around on the walls of his skull like basketballs on concrete and he couldn't focus on a single one of them.
Peter sat down on the floor at the back of the group. He didn't expect a whole lot, and that was okay. He had people who loved him and that was enough... Speaking of. Wade plopped down right beside Peter and they automatically leaned together until they were pressed side to side. Peter put his head on Wade's shoulder as Steve handed out the first round of presents.
"Let him go," was all Wade had to say before Peter was standing.
"A week... it's only been a week Stevie, but it's been too fucking long," he muttered against the slightly chapped lips of his lover. "But I remembered something, you know? Just during the ride back. I remembered something, Stevie, from the train... From all those years ago..."
"But they did hurt me, Buck... They hurt you. They had you all that time, and I... I thought you were dead. We all did. I wrote a letter to your family..." He could tell that Steve was getting choked up now, and he watched as the blonde pulled away from him and walked into their bedroom. He returned with a small, rusted compass in his hand. Inside was a photo of Peggy, but he watched as Steve bypassed it completely and pulled it from its place to reveal a small photo of Bucky himself.
And Bucky doesn't even answer all the way and Peter knows the answer just from that and his voice is hoarse as he forces himself to keep speaking. "Oh my God. She's dead? She... I'm an
All he could do was cower, but how far back can you lean from the things that are inside of you? How do you escape? How do you escape your own mind? The twisted May in front of him just laughed.
Steve shook his head. "No, we're going to find him. He's just fine, wherever he is."
He needed to act as natural as possible. Peter always prided himself on his acting as he rarely ever got caught, but these guys were the best of them all and they would be the ultimate test of his acting skills. They'd been fooled before, but this was all new territory to Peter.
He knocked a little, but the door opened before he was even finished and Wanda was there with a smile, Vision on her arm. They'd just returned from their date and they looked as happy as can be. Sometimes he wonders how they make it work, but he knows that's their business, and no matter how close he and Wanda are, he's not about to pry into her love life.
"Tony..." Bruce started gently, trying to gauge Tony's emotional state.
Peter tried to get out of bed, but he lunged forward too hard and slipped, knocking his knees on the floor as he fell. Tony rushed forward and pulled Peter to his chest, trying to gently coax answers out of Peter. All Peter could do was cling onto Tony's shirt, shaking violently with the thoughts rattling around in his mind. All he could manage to get out was 'She doesn't want me anymore'. And maybe Tony didn't understand at first, but that didn't matter.
They all knew damn good and well what Peter was capable of, especially after the training he'd been doing.
After the pair had finally calmed down, Bucky took the time to tell them about the offer to live in Wakanda, wherever that was. He told them about how he was promised a normal life for Peter, a safe place where he wouldn't be in danger all the time like he was now. A place for him to grow and thrive. And the looks on their faces made it seem like they really were considering it.
On his desk lie a smart-watch with a scratch on the screen and an old looking mp3 player. He touches them gently, afraid that they're just a memory and aren't really there, but his fingers connect and they're real and he remembers them and he knows what they are and what they meant to him. "These are mine... The watch... Shakes?"
When Peter saw him in the mirror, he froze. Bucky had shushed him before he even got the chance to ask that he didn't tell anyone.
He walked around to the other side of the table and peered at the recording over Tony's shoulder. It showed the hallway outside of May's house. Six men in all black uniforms pulled her out of her apartment while she was kicking and screaming... Following behind the group, casting a quick glance at the camera... Was Wade.
The hard part was now returning to Midtown High to go through his Sophomore year. He rejoined band and academic decathlon at the end of last year, and now with MJ as the lead, things were kinda looking up for Peter. He didn't feel like an outcast as much as he did last year.
"It's for your arm... I thought you might like having the power to be able to fix it yourself sometimes..." Peter said sheepishly.
Peter didn't dare to ask any kind of questions, fearing that the gun in the man's hands would be turned on him if he did so much as breathe too loudly. Despite all the time he's spent here, he's still so deathly afraid that he'll never make it out.
"Do it then, if you want to so badly... Kill me." He choked, already struggling for air.
He continued to struggle to breathe but she kept talking to him regardless, and as she did so she slowly started sinking towards the floor and made sure that he came with her until they were kneeling and Peter put his head in her lap. She continued to gently rub the scratch on his wrist as she played with his hair and as he relaxed, his watch vibrations slowed down.
Peter looked up. "What are yours about?"
Getting into Tony's lab wasn't hard. Peter'd seen Tony put the code in hundreds of times already... Okay, that was a lie, but he memorized the code by just seeing it once.
Rumlow scoffed as he rubbed his hands on his pants. "No. I don't suppose I would. That's why I brought you here. Nice warehouse, abandoned for the weekend... They store meat. I'm sure you know what that means."
Wade couldn't deny Peter, and he couldn't even think about teasing the boy, not now that his dick was leading his brain. He pressed against Peter and ever so slowly began to press inside of him. He couldn't help the moan of Peter's name that dripped from his lips like water over a fall. It felt like heaven having Peter's tight heat around his length again.
"Peter..." His name was drawn out and gargled in the throat of whatever monster it came from. "I knew..... You'd come for me..."
Wade took the plate back into the kitchen and when he returned, he helped Peter into his warm clothes, and then carried him to his bed, quickly tucking him under the covers so the clothes would heat the blankets a little bit and he wouldn't freeze to death.
Tony wished he knew the answer, but all he could do was hold this boy, hold his son, hold him tightly.
He remembered the smile on Bucky's face. He remembered how excited Bucky had been to see all of the science and technology. He knew this was also Bucky's last chance to chaperone those girls on their dates, and Bucky wasn't going to let them down.
Peter just laughed a little, then let Tony continue.
Regardless of who'd been coming to collect him, they were obviously too late.
And it made him wish that they'd just kill him already so he wouldn't have to deal with the harsh reality of not knowing anymore. He
Bucky said nothing as he and Steve sipped their drinks, only speaking once their cups were empty. He pointed to the ceiling above them and smirked, "Mistletoe."
I know I said I'd grind the chapters, but I got super busy and I'm so sorry :((
He remembered what happened the last time people listened to him like that. Half of the team nearly got killed and there was nothing he could do about it then, and now Nat is gone and there's not much he can do about that either, except...
He didn't want the boy to be a hero anymore. He didn't want to see the boy spend his life as they had; broken, bruised, having the world expect them to give more than they could. He didn't want to see the boy grow up under the public eye of spandex and camera flashes. He didn't want the boy's name tarnished in articles and newspapers and message boards. He didn't want the boy's failures to get more publicity than his accomplishments.
He got the child he swore to protect injured. And then he tried to blame Steve. He turned to the blonde.
"Says the man that don't know how to shut his." Bucky snapped. "Don't talk to her like that. Surely your mother taught you how to respect a woman."
Peter took a step back and was flush with the window.
His voice was just barely short of a roar now as he yelled directly into the man's covered face. He glanced to Natalia, who, though nobody else would ever be able to tell, was beginning to look concerned. He pushed himself up, using his knees as leverage.
Wade looks up at her, his mask concealing the slight shock on his face. He takes a breath and stares into her eyes while she stares back at where she thinks his eyes should be. "Don't you mean, 'people like us'?"
There weren't walls to split up the floor plan, so the kitchen, living room and office area were all parts of the same room. With a shiver, he lit the fireplace so Peter wouldn't be cold when he got up and then proceeded to set up Peter's computer and equipment on the small desk in the corner. Part of him knew that Peter would want to get to work the moment he woke up.
Tony glances over his shoulder at the two of them. "If the system shut down that means that the security and cameras were off for the whole building until FRIDAY rebooted... Is everything else accounted for?"
"You're always stressed. You're going to have to figure out how to deal with it."
Bucky lifted Tony up farther and listened to the pained attempts at air and the weak, scared whimpers... Then the door opened, and standing there was Steve, with Natalia and Bruce behind him. So Friday had alerted someone. That someone just so happened to be the one person in the world that Bucky would listen to while he was like this.
Eight days after Peter's rescue and he's spent the last four in bed mourning for a family that was taken from him before he even had the chance to remember them properly. The memories have been coming back in groups for the last few days, handfuls of his old life here and there. He remembers sitting down at a table in a restaurant sharing pointless banter. He remembers being taught to tie a tie, to tie his shoes, to write in cursive.
"Speaking of friends, where did the other one go?"
"I know baby, I miss you too, but we gotta be safe now, don't we?"
As for Steve, he trained too, just less. Most of Steve's time was either spent in a parental panic or out searching with a team for any traces of Peter. But it was nothing but useless. They weren't even sure if he was in the country anymore, let alone the same state.
While everyone sat down to breakfast, Nat could tell that something was a little but off with Peter. When nobody was looking, he just looked sad, lonely. She could see him touching his stomach every once in a while, and it didn't take a genius to figure out what had him down. It was Wade. The fact that he wasn't present had her little spider upset, and as soon as she figured it out, she started wondering what there was for her to do about it.
He curled up in a corner, the metal-armed man sitting in the one across from him, and he cried.
He was met with a photo of Tony and Pepper at a gala that happened over ten years ago, which led Peter to believe that Tony wasn't on his computer a whole lot anymore. It had all the same information that Tony's other computer had, but it was obvious that Tony hadn't put any effort into updating his background or anything of the sort in quite some time. Peter plugged a small chip into Tony's computer and a window came up.
Steve and Natalia walked Bucky into their bedroom and watched as he sat down on their bed and slumped over. They were nervous, nearly afraid of what'd just happened, and what could still happen if Bucky was in the middle of a fit... These things happened sometimes. Usually, they weren't so bad, just some snarky comments or angry glares for a little while, and then everything calmed down again and they had the real Bucky back again, but this was different. Bucky was in tears, and Steve can easily say that he hasn't seen Bucky cry since long before he went into the ice.
Steve raises a brow and smiles a little. "Yea? You get something to wear out tomorrow?"
Peter just shrugged. "I've had worse... But you knew that already, didn't you?"
Peter looked to the door as Tony pushed it open and his jaw nearly dropped to the floor. He walked inside and was met with warm air and a whole new apartment that he could call his own. The space was open but closed off enough for his privacy. The sleek furniture and wood flooring appealed to all of his aesthetics, and there were empty pots for him to grow plants in if he wanted. He could see the light bar from the compound had been installed around the whole apartment, and he could see the huge computer taking up the whole desk across the apartment.
She agreed and took both the cigarette and the trash bag from his outstretched hand before quietly going outside. Wade waits to make sure MJ stays asleep before closing the bathroom door most of the way. He turns back to Peter who's already looking up at him with innocent eyes.
royalty looking nothing shy of a fucking hobo and his cheeks flushed as he reached his hand out to shake, "Your Highness, a pleasure."
When he woke again, head pounding harshly, he was in a dimly lit room that somehow resembled a hospital room, but clearly was not. The beeping machine beside of him seemed far too loud for the space that he was occupying by himself, but there was clearly nothing that he could do about it right now beyond ignoring it.
Bucky couldn't help but chuckle. "You... You had that in there all this time?"
Rumlow chuckled and leaned his head back. "You've tried. You've stabbed me, shot me... Your boyfriend dropped a building on me... And I'm still not dead yet. I don't think you want to kill me, I think you wanna be with me."
Peter was only a kid, a little on the young side, and much too good for Wade. He was better than what Wade would ever be holy enough to deserve. Wade didn't deserve the privilege of touching Peter, of being near him. But goddamn he wished he was.
For three weeks it was just Peter, Wanda, and Mr. Banner around the base. It was maddeningly quiet, and with the only three heroes avoiding one another, it was boring as fuck.
Wade gently grabbed onto Peter's wrist and tugged until he released Wade's collar. "Your parents are fine."
Steve has a habit of joking about things that he shouldn't, but only when it's personal to him. Too broke to go to school? Make jokes. Almost died in the line of fire? Laugh it off. Go through a traumatic transformation into 'Captain America' and have people look at you like the posters until you die? Ignore it, make some jokes, pretend it doesn't bother you.
Steve leaned against the front door and closed his eyes... It was gonna be a good life, starting now.
Peter looked up with a smile. "Hey, what's up?"
"Doesn't matter. Steve will talk because I have you. If it was between say, telling me where Peter is, or me killing you... I'd bet that he'd tell me where Peter was first... And then I'd kill you anyway."
He smiles widely before sitting next to Wade again. The whole morning goes like this, and the moment the last presents are finished with, Tony stands and claps his hands together, announcing that there's one last gift, and the adults all agree. Peter is told to grab all of his gifts and he does, with the help of Wade, Nat, and Steve. Everyone follows Tony downstairs through the cold air.
Wade slips out the door and Peter stuffs his equipment back into his bag. After making sure the cell is closed again, the pair slips farther down the hallway and into another room. Peter clicks the light on and Wade finds his confiscated things. He begins stuffing his suit into his backpack, along with a couple other weapons. Peter makes his way through another door into a separate storage room and stuffs a couple of canned meals, along with old military rations into his bag.
Peter just nodded and massaged his wrists. Bucky finally spoke again. "Forget about that, where's my fucking arm?"
Bucky looked to the clock from where he sat on the floor of Peter's bedroom. It'd been exactly one week, three days, four hours and 12 minutes since Peter disappeared. Bucky knew what the new statistics were. He'd read them all over and over. He knew how the chances of finding a child under regular circumstances decreased with every hour that went by. He knew that if Peter had been taken by Hydra, their chances decreased twice as fast.
Peter took three big steps back the moment he saw them, two bright white eyes. Unblinking, they stared up from him from low to the floor, the pupil-less masses urging Peter closer without a word, but he willed himself to be still. To be sane. Doing so may have been the only way he'd stay alive.
Bucky stood on the top of an overpass and looked down. He could see the target beneath him, and for some reason standing here felt familiar but he wasn't quite sure why. He didn't particularly want to make a scene about this, but Bucky was partially considering waking the Soldier up himself just to make sure he went through with the job.
Bucky only wasted 15 minutes after Peter's hour was up, and that time was spent gathering weapons and calling Steve to go with him. The little dot had been frozen on the map for too long now. Something had to be more than wrong.
Steve noted that Peter looked pale, but Sam thought they oughta chalk it up to that having been Peter's first mission. Peter agreed that he was a little out of it, but only he knew why.
Peter checked over his web-slingers just as he was struck by the realization that his suit was not bulletproof like Tony's was. He didn't have a metal arm like Bucky, or a shield like Steve. Even Sam had his wings.
Wade took a step forward and Bucky's attention snapped to him. "Don't move."
Peter looked out into the trees and wiped his sweating hands on his shirt. "Wade?" He paused. "Wade!"
"Did you kill them?!" Peter threw Wade up against the nearest wall and Wade put his hands up in defense.
Because with Peter sitting on the couch, an arm slung over his face, Steve Rogers wanted nothing more than to be the best goddamn parent in the world.
And Bucky didn't want to refuse, it sounded amazing. Steve and Natalia took some time to deliberate the idea for a while before deciding that if Bucky wanted to do it, then it would be done, and he didn't hesitate to accept.
The tone of the voice on the other end changed when whoever it was realized that they weren't talking to Peter himself. "I suppose, who's asking?"
So he roamed the halls for what seemed like hours. He twisted and turned through different floors and passed through enough doors he figured he'd be lost from now on. He strolled right up to a glass wall that he felt he only recognized from what seemed like a dream he'd been in so long ago.
"Damn, it gets hot in there sometimes." He laughed before tossing the mask onto the bed and pulling Peter close to him.
Okoye's head was held high as they walked into the palace and despite that, she wasn't looking down on Peter or being condescending of his sadness. She seemed to understand very well. They passed the King in the halls and Peter bowed his head, partly of respect, and partly to hide his sleep-deprived and tear-stained face.
Peter's phone rang and he jumped up, excusing himself to go answer it.
With a shaking breath, he says, "Twelve people have died in Queens since Peter went missing, at the hands of people that "Spider-Man" would've taken care of... I don't want that blame on him, I don't want him to think that blood is on his hands."
Nat considered texting Wade to press for details about what happened to Peter, but for right now she needed to focus on Steve and James. Although Peter was her boy, these were her men, and they needed her too.
He didn't want to respond, but the answer was clear, beating itself off of the inside of his skull waiting to be let out like a lion in a cage. "It's mine..."
TW: gore(?), self-mutilation, technical non-con acts
They shook their heads and informed him that they sent Ned home at the same time that they made everyone else leave, and that he'd come by in the morning when he had money for a cab. Wade nodded and stood, taking this moment while Peter was still to talk to the girls. He pointed to the closet.
Bucky's eyes traveled upwards, not really focusing on anything as he lifted a gun from their makeshift table. Bucky thought this was incredibly similar to something that happened in one of those action movies that Peter showed him once. Where the 'good guys' had one of the bad guys trapped in some warehouse and were being all stoic and such... Really just proves how much of the stuff in those movies could actually happen in real life.
He sure as shit didn't expect to see Bucky in such a state... He was really in the mood for a cigarette, but he refused to move while Bucky was laying across his lap. Bucky was more important to him right now, though if he mentioned it to Bucky he'd probably agree and have one for himself... No! Steve, stop it, it's about Bucky right now.
Peter was basically crying tears of pleasure at this point, letting out little whines and cries at each of Wade's thrusts. Wade nearly matched each sound.
also tw for the word: r*pe
Wade makes his way through the trees, knowing that for now, he won't be caught. It would ruin the plan and they- his inside man- knew it. It was too soon. The plan wasn't anywhere near finished. And sure, Wade threw in some twists and turns of his own, but that just made it easier for his inside man. The less they knew, the easier it would be to act confused, well, by then it would be real confusion.
It's been 35 days since Peter's rescue and he's beginning to get restless. He wants to get out of the house, but he isn't ready for school and still barely remembers his friends. He wants to go somewhere that he's never been before. He doesn't want to relearn, he wants to be taught without issue.
The offer was, of course, still on the table if she wanted it. Given her newfound connection with Peter, they imagined that she'd take the offer.
He tried to argue that he couldn't just leave Peter, especially now, but he knew that he needed to help them. Even though it meant leaving Peter for a little bit, he knew that Steve was right. He did know the Hydra Rumlow the best, and everyone knew it. Of course, he didn't like it, being the one they could call with a Hydra problem because he had "inside knowledge", but he supposed it happened to be useful sometimes.
He asked if there were any tight spaces in his room and she says no, they made sure to make sure everything seemed open and big for him because they knew he didn't like tight spaces. He let out a breath he didn't know he'd been holding.
Eventually, he just turned his phone off, knowing that anyone else would just contact him through his watch, but even that was starting to get annoying. He was ready to go find somewhere quiet that he could be left alone for a while. Maybe he could get Flash to stick him into a locker and he can just stay there for the rest of the day.
Tony knew this was his place, on his knees in front of a powerful man like Bucky, or maybe just Bucky period. He'd fallen more out of love with Bucky and the others and now saw it more as lust holding him to the group. Steve would be heartbroken, he thinks, but it's for the best that he leaves them.
Every time he looked at the small boy floating around his heart and home, it was his first and last thought. When he saw the boy flinch at loud noises and stress out in long stretches of silence, it crossed his mind. Each time the boy jolted awake from a nightmare or zoned out to a memory, the words ended up on the tip of his tongue. He was itching to speak them but didn't quite know how.
At Peter's computer was the notebook he'd been taking notes in. Now there were a bunch of scribbles in red ink where there'd once been a blank page. On said page were a bunch of dots that Peter himself never connected. Information he never knew. There were things on this paper that weren't in any of the files on Peter's computer.
He looked back into the hollow, seeing that there were more than just these files there. Inside Bucky could see clear as day the first knife he ever gave Peter, his first Spider-Man suit, a small Lego man that looked like Darth Vader, a bottle of his old web-fluid formula, a negative pregnancy test inside of a ziplock bag, one of Wade's masks, a photo of Peter's Aunt May and Uncle Ben, Peter's birth certificate, two old dirty pairs of dog tags that once belonged to him and Steve, one of Nat's guns tucked safely into it's holster, a book of baby names, and one of the oldest models of Tony's arc reactor.
He sighed and rubbed his thumb across the barrel of his gun. "You sure do have a big mouth... I'm getting kinda tired of listening to you talk, but you're the only company for the time being so... I'm gonna regret this."
The man stood, a soft smile on his face. "King T'Challa, of Wakanda."
Tony had been working in the lab non-stop, using his AI's to search the globe for the boy. At this point he was getting so desperate he started debating if he should send a distress signal up to Asgard for help in finding Peter. He knows they could cover more distance out in space if they had assistance from someone that could freely travel through space.
For now, it was important to just get Peter home and safely tucked into his bed.
"I can't have you home yet."
Steve and Bucky shared a look before glancing back to Nat on the stairs. "Peter, who said?"
Peter takes a step backward once Tony's only a couple of feet away, but Tony follows him step for step. Peter doesn't try to speak, he's sure his voice wouldn't work now anyway. Steve's expression is softening, he can see Peter's panic. Steve reaches an arm out towards Tony, but he isn't listening. He hasn't even stopped talking yet.
When Peter woke, the lights were blinding. The pain in his side had dimmed, but the pain in his head only increased the longer he looked at the adults standing over him.
"Wade, ah, please, fuck.."
He did know one thing, and that was from now on, he and Wade were going to use protection. Religiously.
He had a crush on Wade Wilson, a killer who was at least ten years older than him. It was impractical. Dating was impractical. That's what he told himself after Liz. He wasn't wrong.
He noticed Peter got really jumpy when someone managed to sneak up behind him. He'd had his headphones up at full blast and didn't hear the door open behind him once and he'd been scared so bad that not only did he jump, but he cried and shook for over an hour. Wanda felt so bad... So Tony made it a point to have a dim light bar installed around Peter's room. It wasn't anything special, just a simple light that wrapped around the trim near the ceiling.
The poor boy looked up to Bucky as a way of double checking that the man in the flag was a good guy, and only after getting a nod in return did he say, "The man with the glowing eyes."
Bucky wants the truth, and he doesn't care what it'll take to get it. Peter thinks of a way to take matters into his own hands.
Wade didn't mind saying the kid had it bad. And if Wade is saying it, then it has to mean something. Sure, it wasn't the end of the world, but Wade knew it might feel like that to Peter right now. This was all the kid knew now. He knew how to be a genius in school and how to be Spider-Man and now he knew how to be terrified of himself. He knew how to be put down by the adults that didn't find him capable of doing more than just being a kid.
Bruce laughed and waved his hand. "Don't bother with your gun, James, you know it won't work on me. And yes, too. I can't let you walk out of here knowing that I'm your big bad villain. I think you all forget, I'm not stupid."
He could see the guilt on Steve's face, the remorse on Nat's. He just wanted to curl in on himself and stop existing for a while. He wasn't even a whole person anymore. He felt that he was much, much less than that. An object, a weight to be carried, a burden. He just wanted to be normal and he couldn't.
"It is never too late to begin confessing your sins, my child. God will be forgiving."
Then, Steve went still again, his hand falling away from Peter's arm.
"I'm dreaming, aren't I? There's no way you're real... You're from a dream."
He didn't want to ruin the child's life. Would putting it up for adoption be better for it? Surely someone else out there in the world was better suited to be a parent. Surely there was someone more prepared than he was.
Peter, who seemed more confused by Wade's talk just shook his head. "I could already make life! I'm not asking to hear more of your cryptic bullshit, Wade!"
He turned to MJ, basically claiming her as a new sidekick of sorts. "You need to get all of those other kids out of there before I start shooting everyone in their knees."
Steve had one question. "How?"
Hell, he just saved Sam's life, and Mr. Stark was only going to see him as reckless, rather than the hero that he actually was. And he wasn't about to let Mr. Stark look down on him anymore.
Tony bit his lips and Steve glanced from Tony's face to his own crotch and Tony took that as an incentive to reach down and rub Steve's dick through his jeans. Steve shifted his hips a little, arching up into Tony's hand.
He was exhausted, but nothing would put him off of the path of looking for Peter. Not the lack of sleep, or the fact that Bruce had been sneaking away from him sometimes. What he was doing at this point, Tony didn't care. Nothing mattered more to him now than finding Peter, and the woman that put him in his care in the first place.
Nat stood and gently ruffled Peter's too-long hair before asking him if he was interested in having some of Bucky's stew, and he agreed with a smile. Bucky glanced over his shoulder with a smile and made up a bowl for Peter as Nat wheeled him up to a place at the table. He said a sweet thanks for Bucky as a bowl was placed in front of him.
For what he'd done to him. For what he'd done to Steve. To Peter. To Natalia.
Wade sipped his coffee to hide his frown. "Alright."
He honestly wanted to cry, but he knew that if he showed any little hint of sadness, Mr. Stark would only ever see him as a child. With his birthday coming up, he was going to be one year closer to being an adult, and he thought it was damn near time he got treated like one.
The way Nat's shoulders seemed to lose all of the tension they'd been holding felt like enough for Steve to know that she completely agreed with the idea before she even said it. When she did, it was quiet, like she'd almost been afraid to say something. It seemed like Steve's train of thought just picked her up along the way, as she'd been thinking about it just within the last couple of days.
Peter nodded before slowly sitting up, the pain obvious on his face. Strange asked what he was doing and he said that he couldn't lay down if he was meant to get them all taken care of, which meant he'd been putting more pressure on them than they could handle and Stephen helped him to stand up.
Now I'm sure you're wondering, who is this guy on the inside? Is he someone we know? Is he an unimportant background character, or are we going to be totally surprised and betrayed when we find out who it is? Well, I don't know yet, because you're not going to meet them anytime soon. I'm keeping this little trick up my sleeve until I find the best time to use it.
"You're right, Peter, it is your fault. I mean, if you had just died, they would've let me go... Don't shake your head at me, Peter, you know it's true! You ripped me apart!"
"Yes! YOU insisted on taking him on the mission, YOU took him into the warehouse, and YOU let him get shot!"
The man had a name though, an identity. He'd heard the man talking to himself once and after he'd been caught he explained that Peter knew what he was saying because he'd heard it before. The man didn't know anything that Peter didn't know. He'd remembered, only briefly, that it was what soldiers were trained to do under torture. They were required to give their captors their name, rank, and serial number.
Wade wasted no time in undoing Peter's jeans and pushing them down to his ankles. He took even less time in turning Peter around and bending him over until Peter was taking up most of the space in the alleyway that they occupied, sweaty back to clothed chest.
Steve rose a brow. "Oh, so now I LET him get shot? Is that it?"
He got up and ran as best as he could for maybe 30 feet before leaning on a tree. "Wade!" His voice came out as little more than air.
"Я убью всех, кто положил руки моему сыну." Peter heard Bucky growl. He didn't know what it meant, but it sounded dangerous. Peter quickly learned that Bucky reverted to Russian when he was angry, but just as easily switched between languages when he was pissed. Like, really pissed off, Bucky will switch between three or four languages in the same sentence. Somehow it comes out making perfect sense to Natasha.
"There's extra blankets in there, you can make yourselves a place on the floor. I'll take care of Peter and make sure you girls get home safely in the morning, okay?"
Tony knew that Steve was right, just like he usually was. With a sigh, he left the medical bay to go and find where Peter had run off too. "Friday, locate Spider-Boy for me will you?"
And his heart sank.
Across the room, Eddie knelt on Peter's bed and touched the boy's healing face. "Seems like it's working so far. How do you feel?"
"They offered to make me a new one, but it's gonna take some time. Have'ta roll without one for now, but it can't be that bad... I'm finally all me again, Stevie."
Peter leans closer, voice dropping an octave. "They'd better be."
Bucky was a soldier. He was trained and prepared to handle any number of situations. Young Peter Parker approaching him and asking for a weapon, however, was a situation he wasn't the most prepared for. He promised not to ask any questions, as long as Peter could say with certainty that nobody was going to die.
Peter thought it was so strange that it seemed like he had four parents when one of them only cared about him for his brain, one of them dropped a ramp on him, and the other two didn't do a whole lot of speaking to him, even now.
Bucky did a glance to Steve, who just looked soft, and Nat, who looked somewhat fond. He looked back to Peter, who looked a little bit calmer now.
He looked down at the little spider and suddenly wanted to protect him with everything he had, even if it meant his life.
at the fact that Bucky might leave and never come back.
One of the tears slipped down Bucky's face and Steve kissed it away as he tried so hard to do with all of Bucky's problems. Bucky dug his fingernails into the taut skin of Steve's muscular shoulders, and just like it was so long ago, they tried to be quiet. And just as it was, they failed, but who cared? Certainly not the two of them. All they cared about right now was each other and the love that they were making.
yikes (part 2)
Rumlow took the scalpel from Peter and used it to cut away the hospital gown the boy wore before pulling Peter's oversized underwear to the side. Peter braced himself by grabbing onto the assassin's shoulders, hissing once again at the less than gentle penetration. While the boy was distracted, Rumlow digged the scalpel into his skin, dragging it along the underside of his collarbone.
"A kid who can stop a bus with his bare hands and hack into a multimillion-dollar security system that grown adults from the government couldn't even pass the firewall on." He passes through the group room and collects Natasha as the facility-wide alarm blares. He swipes a clipboard from a frantic looking S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and curses a little.
He shifts, muttering under his breath. "Spider-Man."
Bucky held Peter tighter, but only for a moment. He felt the boy wince against his chest and let him go. "What's happened to you?" Bucky asked.
He struggled as more arms wrap around him, and he felt a sting in his neck. A familiar voice said, "Don't you worry now, everything will be just fine..."
Peter stared blankly into his coffee for a long moment before nodding and turning to face Wade on the couch. Wade did the same, tucking a leg under himself and giving Peter 110% of his attention.
"You're not real..."
"Yeah, no shit." Peter walks forward to intercept Bucky, who's on his way to Wade.
He flinches when Tony's tools send a sting up his arm and Tony quickly apologizes. Vision floats down through the ceiling, and nobody even blinks at his intrusion.
Bucky's pretty hazy.
Wade, who Peter could see hiding very obviously behind a bin across the street, could hear the pain in Peter's voice as he spoke, "I wish you could be here... But they'd kill me... And I would say you, but they can't kill you, can they?"
He was having the van tracked and froze all of Peter's bank cards so his money couldn't be stolen... Though with something like this, it wasn't really about the money anyways. They'd taken Peter for a reason. What that reason was, nobody knew, but they'd all be damned if they couldn't find out.
What really mattered was that Tony sat with Peter, rocking him and coaxing him to take slow breaths, going so far as to breathe along with him until Peter got the hang of doing it for himself. Tony played with his hair, and at this moment Peter felt more like family to Tony Stark than he ever had before. Peter finally calmed down enough to breathe, and ended up falling asleep.
"If you want to keep looking, that's fine, but you need your rest. You don't want to get sleep deprived and miss something important."
"What does it do? What'd it do to me? Why am I sick?" Peter's hands were starting to shake as his watch began to vibrate.
Nat was getting more and more worried about Peter and his well-being with every day that passed by and now, she was extra worried by this, and yesterday's sickness that seemed to vanish into thin air.
He was also a little worried because the guy on the inside was close to Peter, which made him worry less at the same time. He was basically a clusterfuck of worry at this point and there was nothing to be done about it. All he could do was sit with his shitty anxiety about the situation. He didn't like having to betray Peter any more than he liked following Hydra, but there was only so much to be done at this point. He could either roll over and get Peter killed, or he could suck it up and quit being a bitch about it, singlehandedly saving Peter's life.
shit.
Wade had managed to lead Peter up onto the second basement level, leaving nothing behind but a trail of Hydra bodies. Wade had managed to snag a couple of guns off of a couple of agents a little while back and it was really making all the difference. Peter was still carrying the knife and the scalpel, and when someone grabbed him from behind, he didn't hesitate to turn and stab the knife into whatever part of the Agent was closest.
After a long minute, Steve just smiled over at Peter. "You should ask him over for Christmas."
Being choked by his jacket was bringing back the unsavory memories he'd just shook less than an hour ago. His eyes went wide as he flashed back to being crushed once more, suffocated by the rubble.
Either way, 3 days in and I've technically put out a chapter a day so far! Let's hope I can keep this up for a little bit.
Peter went to his room and stripped out of his hoodie and suit. He could see the bloodstain. He tossed his clothes onto the floor and went into the bathroom.
For a half a second Wade was worried that the name-calling was a little too far for Peter until he felt Peter twitch around him. "Oh god yes, love it so much."
Wade rolled his eyes like it should have been obvious. "Cards, music, video games, what calms you down when you get like this?"
"It gave you the ability to CARRY life, Peter. A human being, inside of you, almost like the way mothers do." Wade's heart skipped when he saw the way that Peter was looking at him. His eyes were wide and he looked so afraid.
"While Peter was doing God knows what, the systems were shut off, which meant any door in the building could be opened and closed and there'd be no record of it at all. The highest security doors could have been opened by a kindergartener."
It reminded Peter of the look on his own face when Tony re-did his suit for him. When he did all that he could to help the focus in his vision once he knew that Peter had troubles focusing on all of the input his brain was receiving at once.
Once Bucky and Natasha both were meant to go on a mission together, they told Steve, and he quickly took up the mantle of the watchful eye. Steve wasted no time in telling Tony.
"I'm gonna clean you up, Petey, you're gonna be alright. It's gonna be okay. You're gonna be all cleaned up and fed and nice and toasty in your bed before sun-up, okay?"
The little girl grinned evilly at him as she rose the knife to Peter. She grabbed onto his arm and yanked it towards her with an inhuman strength. He fought her, to no avail and she giggled as she brought the knife to his arm. He screamed again and tried to pull away, but she had him held still as a statue as she brought the knife down and dragged it across his wrist.
For a moment he could pretend that he was a regular teenager with a mom and dad and not some
Steve agreed, then asked Bucky'd been to sleep yet. He said no, and Steve suggested he get some rest too. Bucky, being the genius he is, suggested they FaceTime to sleep. He was sure Peter would be okay for a couple of hours.
Wade shakes his head. "No, NATO has one word for every letter of the alphabet. It's used so outsiders have a harder time deciphering the message. So for example, to spell your name, it'd be Papa, Echo, Tango, Echo, Romeo. P-E-T-E-R. So, Charlie, India, Alpha would spell C.I.A. and, wait what does this have to do with the C.I.A.? Petey, are we spies?"
The longer he went on, the more anxious he became, wondering if he'd ever find his bedroom. Suddenly, the idea struck him, and as bad as it was it was the only one he had.
"Would you mind if I waited for my fiance to come? I'd like to see how he feels about this."
So when Steve came into the picture, he was the only one allowed to do the talking because he knew what to omit from the media and how to keep the situation under control. But lately, he was lacking. he was losing patience with the media and everything they stood for. He hated what was going on in their country, but there was nothing he could do about it.
Dismounting the motorcycle, Bucky was already pissed off before he'd even reached the door. He passed his gun to Natalia and knelt down to unlock the large metal garage door. He slipped one of his metal fingers into a small metal hook and yanked.
So, Bucky broke the news as gently as he could. He only told Peter that he was needed for a mission back in the States, but it should take him a couple of weeks. Peter seemed to understand and only seemed slightly bummed out.
Natasha walked along the group, popping bubble-gum as if everything wasn't falling to shit around them. "VX9103 has escaped, and so has CX4376... Hopefully, they'll finally kill each other and save the rest of us a lot of trouble."
His brows knit together in confusion but he thanks Steve and makes his way back to the bedroom, knocking gently before entering. In the chair by the window sits Bucky with Natasha on his lap. They're murmuring quietly in Russian and Peter can't quite make out what they're saying, even with the little bit of Russian that he does know. He contemplates reaching up and turning his hearing-aid up but by the time the thought crosses his mind they've stopped talking and turned to him.
So is Natasha. To be clear, she pretends not to have any feelings whatsoever. She puts up a front, a wall, a shield. She hides her emotions away because she was trained not to feel anything at all. The Red Room stripped her of everything that she once was or ever could have been. Natasha never told anyone in detail about The Red Room, but Peter read all kinds of stories about a myth of an experiment and he knew it was true. And Bucky had been there once upon a time, and saved Natasha from whatever fate staying would have held for her.
He nodded, "From the news, huh?"
In Stark's storage room he'd found ziplock bags of money confiscated from the pockets of other villains, so it was obviously a no-brainer to just pack it all... Just in case.
Bucky was quick to hang up and Peter put a lot of effort into pulling himself up off of the bathroom floor and down the hall to the office. The secretary asked Peter if he'd called someone and he said yes before being offered a couch to lay on, but Peter decided that curling up on the floor would be just fine.
Bucky was the first one to notice. He seemed to have a sixth sense about this kind of thing. He'd been walking through the halls one night and happened to pass by Peter's room. He didn't know why but he was drawn to the door. He only cracked the door a little, but it was all he needed to see Peter thrashing around in his bed, blankets tangled around his limbs. At first, he wasn't going to say anything about it at all, but once he heard the boy's broken call for help, he didn't hesitate to walk into the room and sit on the bed.
"James... What's got you so worked up, honey?" He heard Natalia ask as she sat beside him. She brushed his hair back from his face and he leaned into her gentle touch. Steve and Nat and Peter were the only people in this world that knew how to treat him with any kind of gentle care. He craved the soft touches he got... Everyone else was so... Rough.
But he couldn't. He couldn't tell them that everything was fine because it wasn't. Their boy was missing and the whole base could feel it. They could feel the overwhelming panic and emptiness. Tony hadn't slept in days. Neither had Bucky. Nobody had, really.
He heard himself croak out the question that he so desperately wanted to have the answer to, the one he needed to know. "Why?" Why couldn't he come home? Why did he have to stay here? Why did she want him to come here in the first place? She wasn't anywhere near being fond of Tony Stark, but she sent the boy that was like her child to live with him, even after everything that'd happened while Peter was in his care, and now she didn't want him back? Did she ever want him in the first place, or has she felt burdened this whole time after being saddled with Peter?
Peter meets an unexpected guest. Said guest nearly gets kicked through a window.
Steve didn't know what he could have been thinking back then. He was 5'7" and 110 pounds soaking wet. He was lucky enough to even know how to throw a punch in the first place, but take a guy down? That'd be a damned miracle.
Unless there was some real divine intervention, there was no way in hell that this wasn't all part of God's brilliant plan. Right now Peter didn't give a shit what the man upstairs wanted, and he wouldn't ask to be forgiven for this, because this was not a sin. Wiping this human shit-stain off of the Earth was his civic duty and he would not pretend to be sorry. He was about to do God a favor in sending that bastard down to Hell early. God could thank him later.
Wade knelt down to be eye-level with Peter. "What do you like?"
"Where are we?"
"Your son is nothing short of a genius, and although my own sister is very smart on her own, she has wished for a second opinion, and mine will not do."
Wade laughs at the use of their inside joke but then shakes his head with a frown. "No, it's nothing like that, but... I know why you're sick... Peter, we were found out by some really bad guys when we ran away... They took me into the woods and I couldn't get back to you in time to stop them from doing what they did."
He stands, letting Peter's hand slip from his grasp. "Oh, but you are. You're JUST like me. You tell yourself not to get involved with people but you fail, and you play it close to your chest and when something happens to them, because it always does, you blame yourself, because you probably could have saved their lives and saved yourself all the heartache if you'd just listened and stayed away like you're supposed to. But you're selfish, you want to have the things that other people have. You want a regular job, and a family, and a quiet little life with the people that you love but you know that you can't. Your life and your line of work put everyone that you so much as come into contact with in immediate danger, but you lie. You lie to the people around you and to yourself, and you say that they're safe even when you know that you're not." Her chest is rising and falling now, most likely with anger as Wade stands over her spouting all of the truths that she doesn't want to have to listen to.
Rumlow watched as the boy grabbed a bar of soap from the edge of the tub. With his clumsy self and the shakes, it wasn't hard for the boy to drop the soap right into his lap. He reached right into the boy's lap but totally bypassed the soap, instead just settling for wrapping his hand around the boy's dick. This was the only attention it'd had in months, so it was no surprise when it became erect in his hand.
Peter wants to reach out and touch Wade's cheek, the way one lover might do to the other. He wants to wipe away the stray tear forming in Wade's eye and he wants to kiss him and remind him that everything is okay now... But he doesn't. He tucks his hands under his legs and rests his face on his knees. He doesn't want to give Wade his attention and affection, only for it to come out that Wade didn't see him as anything more than a fuck.
One look at the name on the screen made him look extensively furious, then he changed his expression to look happy as ever. "Wade? Oh, back are you? It's nice to hear from you, it's been a while."
She took a shaking breath. Wade seemed to know everything there was to know, so she saw no reason to try and lie to him. "In the Red Room, where I was trained they have this... Ceremony when you pass. It's not sterilization, it's a serum. It did to me what the other serums did to Steve and James. Mine just worked differently on me... Made it impossible to me for have kids... I can um... I can get pregnant, just not carry to term with them. My body won't let me... I keep those to prepare myself for the hurt. To prepare Steve and James too."
Peter was nodding along to the man's words, ignoring the way his head was being petted. He wanted those things. He didn't want to sleep in a box anymore.
"Things are fine, Peter, what'd you need?" She sounded almost, impatient, and it was strange to hear. She hasn't sounded like this in a very long time.
Peter shook his head. "Wade and... And Eddie. They saved us. We would've been killed..."
Those six words were all it took in order to shift the whole room around them. The air thickened and Peter's breath stilled. They'd found him. Finally, after all of this time.
Peter wasn't thrilled that they were gone, and he was less thrilled that they all left him behind when he could've been of use.
a brief rundown of how everyone's doing... spoiler alert: it isn't good.
Suddenly, it dawned on him. "Яблоко от яблони," He repeated, stunned. Peter'd had a plan this whole time.
?????????????????????????????????????
"Tony's orders, Peter... You ran away, you've been gone for days..." She shook her head, hair falling into her eyes. "That Mercenary brought you back to us half dead, with one of the deadliest creatures inside of this facility... I don't know what you were thinking Peter, but now we need to know where he is. We need to know where Wade Wilson is and what he's done with VX9103."
Every once in a while Peter would start thinking out loud, asking all kinds of questions that neither of them had the answers to. "Why would they hide this? Who were they really? Who would have killed them?" And so on and so forth. There were a few questions Wade didn't WANT the answers to, "Would they have come back for me? If they loved me, why would they keep leaving?"
They lay together in the bed and Peter puts a pillow between them to make sure they stay on their respective sides of the bed... If by morning the pillow is discarded on the floor and the pair are curled up together, well, nobody needs to know.
Bucky answered instantly, apparently the reception was really good in Wakanda. Steve loved listening to Bucky's voice, which is why he asked how his day went as soon as the call connected. Buck couldn't resist and dove right into talking about how advanced everything was, the science, the medicine. He said it was so nice, and the place he and Peter would stay was amazing too, and it was a shame that Peter couldn't see it yet.
New York City had a lot of one other thing: construction.
And yes, Tony will admit that somewhere inside he still had feelings for the old man, but it was too much too late now. Steve had just proposed to a man he'd been with much longer than Tony had even been alive. Tony leaned on the railing and hung his head.
Peter walks down the long hallway towards the gym, earbuds in and turned up too loud. He rolled right out of bed and into his gym shoes this morning. This morning, it turns out, all four parents are gone. Nobody told him until he walked into the kitchen this morning to see that Mr. Banner and Wanda were eating breakfast and they told him that everyone was gone for the foreseeable future. It could be weeks before they got home.
He dug into the cabinet and pulled out the rubbing alcohol and the first aid kit. He'd stocked his with a needle and thread for just such an emergency.
Bucky cursed as he crouched to grab it, but he was quick to notice the blood on the ground less than three steps away from where the watch was laying. Something bad happened here, and he needed to know what.
"But... We don't have to be afraid anymore... Everything is so different." Steve looked up with a hopeful smile and a soft look in his eyes. "We can be free here, Buck. In the same town that once would've jailed us for it. It's amazing. I wouldn't give this up for anything."
"Of course. Okoye and I will venture to the Starbucks..." He glanced to the woman who nodded, "Down the street while you deliberate with your partner. Take all the time you need, we're here for the week."
and Peter
Bucky just nods before finally standing. His knees crack as a clear sign that they haven't carried Bucky anywhere in a few hours at least. They make their way to the living room where they both plopped down on the couch. It groans under the quick application of their weight and they both stilled to let their weight settle. They were gonna go out to look for new furniture tomorrow. They had a minimalist design plan, but they wanted a little to look like a lot.
It wasn't as if he didn't already feel fucking horrible for what happened, but they weren't making it any better. They just chewed into him for over an hour without break, and he just stood there and took it in silence. There was nothing he could say, so he wouldn't try to defend himself. There's no reason that he'd try. He was a glutton for pain, and he deserved to be yelled at. He knew that he did.
The small puppy looked up at him with the utmost love in its eyes, and he smiled through his tears... This tiny thing was missing one of its front legs, and he was quick to understand. He knew that the others were looking for some kind of way to make him feel better about his arm, especially on the days where he just wished he could take it off and set it somewhere so he didn't have to be stuck with it. Technically, it was a prosthetic, and missing his arm was considered a disability... And even after all of this time, he'd never really come to terms with it, though how could he? He was never given the chance.
Steve didn't look over his shoulder and continued on the punching bag. Where was this conversation going?
Steve focused solely on the punching bag in front of him. He wasn't worried about being back at Avengers HQ and he wasn't worried about Becca sitting with Nat by the door and he wasn't worried about being in the same building as Tony Stark.
"Music, I guess. But you turned my phone off."
Wildly he thrashed, looking around like a frightened animal, and right now he was. But there they both were, alive and staring back at him with life in their eyes and in their veins and he looked down at himself and he was clean, still wearing his t-shirt and sweats from the night before and he was safe and so were they. He relaxed, suddenly realizing that it was nothing more than a dream once more.
And of course, they would not be trapped there. They would be free to leave for travel and other things whenever they pleased. They would be equals.
Wade seemed near frantic that he may have messed something up, and Peter let him go on while he rose from the bed covered in his gifts. The boy sat the box down and shook his head. "No, I love it. I love it all... You didn't have to do all of this..."
Tony was.
But he knocked on the door anyway, and when Peter opened the door, tears on his cheeks, Wade was going to console him. Tell him that everything would be okay and that their child would be alright.
He jogged down the stairs to the basement and basically sprinted down to Wade's cell. "Wade, Wade, Wade!"
Pepper looks at him like he's a small puppy and sighs. "Tony doesn't have any room to make fun of you for anything, Peter. So c'mon, what's the truth?"
Though Peter had lived in New York for such a long time, he's rarely ever left it. Aunt May had to work, so she couldn't really take him places, and Mr. Stark hasn't taken him anywhere at all. He's been on one mission out of the country, and Steve made it clear that they weren't doing any sight-seeing on that trip. So it was nice to be with Wade and see all the sights as the rode the bus out of New York.
The air inside the Quinjet was thick, tense. Everyone inside had the same thought, but nobody wanted to vocalize it. They were all sure that they'd find Peter, but their one collective thought was,
Peter didn't move.
He knew it was only lusting keeping Tony here in this room. If he thought he was in any real danger, he'd have Friday do.... whatever it was she could do in this situation. He knew there were no less than 150 S.H.I.E.L.D. agents bustling about on base at all times.
Peter looked near ready to cry. "Stop! Sam! S- Wanda, please!"
Wade smirked. "Alright baby, cum for me."
Peter felt strong, like the power of a thousand suns was burning in his veins. Peter felt light, like his lungs were full of helium and he was floating off of the ground. Peter felt soft, like he was pressed against a bed of feathers when Wade laid him down. Peter felt free, like nothing could hold him back from this moment anymore.
He didn't know what was wrong with him but he couldn't get rid of the thought of tearing his stomach open with his nails. "Dad!"
Steve sighs. "Peter is just a child, Tony, he's fragile. You have to watch how you talk to the kid."
May's laughter was distant now, echoing in his ears as he brought the shaking knife to his wrist. His body wracked with sobs as he slowly, painfully dragged it across the width of his wrist. It stung, but he wanted it, he needed it, he knew he deserved it as payment for his sins...
"It shouldn't be happening, Banner!" Tony ran his fingers through his hair and took a deep breath. "It's physically impossible. That's not possible, Bruce, it has to be a mistake!"
"I think they're right, Tony, I uh, I don't think we should keep him down here any longer... The isolation can't be good for him. Besides, he truly didn't do anything wrong that we know of. It'd be detrimental to his health and developmental stages. He is still a child."
Peter's voice cracked slightly. "And the fire was so hot... I got burned... Sometimes... Sometimes I can still feel it. Feel the flames on my skin, and it burns so bad..." Peter's fingers trailed absentmindedly over his collarbones where the scarred skin was.
Steve went into the ice, sure. Steve also got the serum, sure. But Steve chose to have his. Bucky's was tortured into him. Forced into his veins and into his mind. He never got a choice, never had a say. And he has to live with that every day of his life. The pain that his arm regularly causes him, the memories of what he'd done. There was never an escape. Never would he have a chance to escape that torment inside of him.
She jumped on the bed, just inches from his face and yelled, "You did this to me!"
He was the one arranging the missions to search for Peter. The one at all the debriefings. The one writing all the reports. He was the one still reporting for missions and debriefings for things that had nothing to do with Peter in the slightest. He wasn't free anymore, not that he ever really was, to begin with. But now he liked it. He enjoyed the distraction from the thoughts that Peter may really be gone for good.
When he next looked at her, she was looking around her gigantic lab with a soft look of wonder. "It is, isn't it?" She turned her gaze to him and smiled. "I'm not a doctor, but I'm on a team with said doctors to monitor the health of you and your baby. This has never happened before in the history of... Well ever, I suppose. But you have my word that we'll do our best for you, and for the child."
His gaze was as cold as the air outside but his heart was colder. On his hands, blood. He remembered scrubbing them until they just bled more. He kept circling back to that picture that night, staring at the other man. His blue eyes awoken something inside of his chest, a flourish he didn't remember feeling before. It hurt, but it felt beautiful, a strong bonding like love that he couldn't believe he'd ever forgotten, and a name that he held to like his closest secret.
Again, Peter nodded, not entirely sure what the man was suggesting.
When Peter was missing, finding him was Tony's number one priority, which meant that he didn't have a ton of time to hang out with anyone, and everyone but Bruce understood. He complained that Tony wasn't making time for him anymore. After the third month of Peter being missing rolled around, Bruce began to insist that they were never going to find him and even suggested giving up the search.
"I know you've been with Banner behind our backs... You can consider this your first 'n' final warnin' Tony. You get two choices... You can apologize, and break it off with Banner... Or you can be only with Banner."
...Now that he'd been with Peter again, all he had to do now was wait for the plan to be set in motion... Wade wondered if it would work this time, but if it didn't, he'd keep trying until it did.
He stopped assaulting the punching bag in favor of trying to catch his breath and wiping the sweat from his brow. Nat strode over, hips commanding the attention of the room, even though they were the only ones in it.
Peter swayed and leaned on the glass, feeling suddenly weaker than before. Bucky was quick to open the door and scoop Peter up into his arms. He turned to look at Natasha, who seemed to know what he was about to say before he even said it. "That's not our choice to make, James."
Bucky lowered his gun just as Nat and Steve appeared behind him. With a furrowed brow he spoke. "You remember who I am?"
Bucky was lucky to be so strong because he lifted the boy up with his only arm and managed to tuck him into bed. He'd put in a call to the resident doctors, and then to Strange. Because as much as he wanted to trust the people here in Wakanda, it'd be nice to have the opinion of a friend too.
"Where?"
A couple of moments passed and his legs were completely numb.
Wade thought Peter looked like a goddamn sin. His eyes were wide and he had spit on his pink lips. And when he pressed those lips to Wade's hardened length, all bets were off. Wade's fingers went right into Peter's hair, and the slightest tug got the biggest reaction out of Peter. It was simple, but it meant so much. Peter let Wade pull his head back.
Was all that Bucky could manage to say as the building began to rumble around them. Wade was closer, he knew he'd make it first no matter how quick they both were. Even as he himself tried to make it to the young boy, something black caught the corner of his eye and then the whole room shook hard enough to knock him off of his feet.
Natasha was the one who took to talking to the school board, and if she leaned threateningly over the Principal's desk and mentioned beating him the way Peter was being beaten if something didn't change, well, that wasn't anybody's business.
Tony pops off at Steve, Peter pops back off at Tony.
Bruce nods and fiddles with his sleeves as he glances at the door the boy had just been taken through. "Yeah, I did... The anomaly wasn't a malfunction..."
Eddie, moderately shocked that he was being spoken to, blinked a couple of times and then shook his head. "Uh, oh, no, no, he's not. He got out, I'm sorry. It was either him or Peter, and, well... Kind of a no-brainer, yea?"
Tony's parents are freaking out.
Peter awoke in the hospital to a reminder going off on his mostly undamaged cell phone. The cracked screen told him that his Hydra escape was just a little over two months ago, a fact that he couldn't even focus on because not only did he feel sick, but because he heard the voice of a woman that wasn't Nat.
They exited the car with no care for closing the doors and strode into the building.
Natasha heard the click of Wanda's heels and turned, smiling at them both. They really were like siblings, which made sense considering the three of them treated them both like their children. There had even once been talk of Wanda coming to live in the apartments with them once upon a time.
Peter replied with a simple
He began to feel drowsy but kept fighting despite that. He couldn't let himself be taken, not now. He promised Bucky that he'd be home!
Wade reminded Peter four times between the bathroom door and the bed that they didn't have to do anything, and Peter reminded him four times in return that he knew, and he wanted to. Wade said that he didn't want Peter to think that he had to give him any kind of sexual anything ever, and Peter said that he knew, that he wanted to do it. He wasn't totally sure why, but he did.
The adults, like always, pushed Peter from the room so they could do what they had to do, but Peter sat outside the door the whole time. He almost wanted to cry, but he knew that Bucky would want him to stay strong... Especially since Steve was already crying.
Peter jolted awake gasping for air and clawing at his chest to try and remove the knife that didn't exist. His chest hurt as though it had existed in real time. He could feel his watch but it wasn't doing anything to ground him, especially not once he inspected his hands and arms and his eyes fell on the scratch across his wrist. It sat there, red and irritated and angry, like the little girl.
He stayed there, how long he wasn't sure, until Bucky came to get him. Bucky signed the little paper and walked around the desk to carefully scoop Peter up off of the cold floor. Peter curled up to Bucky's chest and squeezed his eyes shut. He felt dizzy but held tightly onto Bucky's shoulders.
After a month and the relocation upstate, his wounds seemed to be as healed as they were going to get, left as white patches of skin across his chest and arms. He saw Peter touching them sometimes when he was studying or thinking or just zoned out. He'd been doing a lot of that lately. He'd noticed that when Peter was alone, he'd curl up on whatever chair or couch he'd been left on and his hand would go straight to the damaged skin, and he wouldn't react much, just trail his fingertips back and forth across it.
Nat's knife was carefully strapped to her thigh like it usually was and as they pulled into the dirt parking area, Steve reached over and pulled it out of its holster and checked to make sure it was loaded.
In the mirror, he could see it. His face was pale, sunken in. He looked like he hadn't eaten in so long and that he hadn't slept for longer.
When Bucky came into the room with the boy in tow, blanket wrapped around his shoulders, they couldn't help but smile.
"You don't have to talk about me like I'm some child in the next room. I'm standing right here, and I don't like being talked through."
And then Wade realized, there was nothing he liked more than complimenting him...
Wade... Would live on without him. And that thought alone is enough to scare Peter into silence. The only sound that fills the air between them is the sizzling from the stove.
They never stayed anywhere longer than they needed to. Aside from hunting down Hydra, Nat's time was spent maintaining her weapons and occasionally phoning the boys back home, maybe once a week or so. She didn't want to see them now, as she'd only be reminded of what they were missing. She saw a lot of James in the boy physically, but in spirit, he was all Steve.
Peter smiles gratefully and curls up a little, wincing at the pain coursing through his body. He could handle it, he always does. He learned from the best how to hide it, even if they thought no one else knew of their pain. Peter always knew, he just tried not to ask unless it was so painfully obvious it was like they were begging for help, for comfort. He wanted them to trust him enough to come to him first. That's how it should've been.
Peter leans his crutches by the door and limps his way to the couch, still smiling but not actively tuned into the conversation. Steve furrowed his brows and turned to Nat.
He knew that if he had a chance of getting out, he needed to find that man, that Deadpool. The line of a Michael Jackson song from his childhood made it's way into his thoughts, and he knew that it was the thought he needed to hold onto. It was the mentality that would earn him his freedom one day.
He looked down at the stubborn brainiac where he was, kneeling motionless on the floor at Bucky's feet, waiting for instructions like he was meant to do. He could see the guilt on Tony's face, he knew what he'd done to deserve whatever punishment Bucky decided to dish out to him, and he knew he needed to behave and take it like he always did.
Nat had taken to going on missions around the world, Clint and Sam in tow. She was fighting tooth and nail for any possible information on her boy, but if anyone had it, they weren't willing to share. She's been fighting so long she thinks the blood of the Hydra agents she's killed will be permanently crusted on her hands. Clint and Sam are both following in her footsteps, despite both of them giving up the hope in finding the boy on their quest.
He let the boy cry, he let the boy wail and fight and sob. He let the boy grieve for the only family he'd ever known before... The only family that could very well be gone.
Meanwhile, upstairs, Tony Stark seemed to be losing his mind for the 100th time as he paced the 5th floor balcony. A worried Bruce watched on as Tony procrastinated going back into the apartment.
"Mr. Barnes, this is who we've been waiting for, this is-"
Peter tries to recall something, anything, about what they're asking him. All he can come up with is having seen the code etched into a metal door in the basement. He makes it clear that he's never seen it anywhere else but there and they sigh but press harder for Wade's location. He can't give it to them. Even if he did know, he wouldn't tell them. If Wade was gone it was for a good reason, and if Wade left him behind, that was probably for a good reason too.
Peter wasn't mad about the ride, he was more ticked off that Wade left the GODDAMN PLANET and didn't even think to tell him that he was leaving. Wade continued to go on about he'd be back but he didn't know when.
Peter said that yes, he was kinda getting into it now, and despite some things still missing from his collection, Wade had gone above and beyond to spoil him. Tony nodded, listening intently for a few minutes before speaking.
He was on a mission with Sam and Steve. A small infiltration to a base somewhere in the middle of Russia. There were only meant to be a few people inside of the base. It was supposed to be a quick mission.
"W-Wade, ah, oh god, oh god, Wade I'm gonna, oh god..." Was heard muffled against his hand.
He glanced to the man with the arm, who reminded him that the man couldn't die. He'd make a poor shield, the bullets they had would go through him easily, but he'd do everything in his power to get Peter to the surface... He just needed to know where they were keeping him.
Bucky carded his bloody fingers through his long hair.
She shook her head, having no idea. She would've shot him and gone on her way. She knew he wouldn't die, but at least it would hurt a bit.
Just a little ways down the street, not far from him but slightly more towards the area where Steve was waiting, Bucky could see Rumlow. His back was turned, but he'd know that bastard anywhere. Steve wanted to do this the right way. He wanted to take the asshole in and go the goddamn legal route to make this man pay, but Bucky thought that was bullshit for
"No baby, you're safe. I'm not going to let anything bad happen to you. I've got you now." He kissed Peter on the head again. Peter calmly curled up to Wade's chest and let himself be held, fully aware that Wade had a hand wrapped around the handle of a gun beneath his pillow.
Peter skidded to a stop and held the chip. "I know what happened to my parents."
"Mr. Bucky, what are you going to call her?" He asked softly.
Wade pulled his mask back down and sighed. "They injected you with a type of serum... That's the blood anomaly that Wizard dude found in you. It only altered you a little, from what I can gather..."
"Tony."
Steve smiled widely at the idea and once Peter finally calmed down and sat on the floor by Bucky's feet, Nat started talking to him, using a gentle and caring tone.
....Peter wished that this was all a dream. It wasn't.
happy halloween y'all.
"He says that um... He had a dream that The Winter Soldier was back and that he um... Hurt us, while we were sleeping, and that he woke up covered in our blood."
Peter emerges into the front room just minutes after Wade decided to leave him alone for the chance to collect himself. He refused to tell Wade about his nightmare for the time being. He took a breath and was hit by the smell of garlic.
Peter is no longer keeping count of how many days he's been free of Hydra because he's now refusing to define his new life by something like that. He knows it hasn't been long, just over a month, but he's going to live the rest of his life however he damn well pleases.
But it doesn't matter now, what's done is done... Steve can easily say that when Bruce came to talk to him today, the one thing he wasn't prepared to hear was 'Tony and I have been having an affair behind your backs'. He really didn't expect to hear 'Tony and Bucky have been alone together for a while and Friday just alerted me that Tony's in danger and I need your help' either.
Peter beamed like a goddamn lighthouse. "Really?!"
Bucky didn't move. Peter whimpered. He could see the rock falling. He could feel the weight of it on top of him. Wade moved forward again, and Bucky shot him in the thigh. Peter flinched at the gunshot and Wade kept moving forward anyway, finally falling to the ground next to Peter.
Right now they were just talking, and it was gentle and it was
Nat says that torturing the man won't bring May back, and he tells her that he knows that. "I'm not going to torture him. I'm going to kill him."
Bucky didn't take his eyes off of the mound of blankets and their gentle rise and fall. "I had to pick Peter up from school today."
Peter nods, looking towards his father figures. "Was anyone hurt?"
a really really small one because it's 9 in the morning and I've been up since 8 yesterday morning and I'm exhausted but I'd feel bad if I didn't get something out quickly.
That being said, as soon as the three of them walked into the makeup store, Tony pulled one of 15 credit cards from his wallet and handed it to Peter, saying nothing more than "I'm just happy to learn."
"Thank you."
Wade looked over the table and saw the crusted blood on the tools and began fuming as he gathered them. This was all he had so far in the way of getting Peter out of here, and he was gonna fucking take it.
Peter was finally able to force words out as he sobbed. "Please, Wade, please let me cum for you, Wade please, need it so bad. Cum in me, Wade, please, want it so bad."
"Of course I care!" He exclaimed. He wasn't worried about waking Peter. He had enough drugs in his body to keep him out for days.
Bucky strolls right up to the stove and starts making breakfast for his Spiders, which consists of eggs and French toast. That's one thing Bucky can say about the future, is that there are a lot more ways to cook the same five things. Back in the day they just boiled everything and hoped to God it turned out okay.
Bucky, being the oldest of them all, took on a caring role. Once upon a time, he was also a brother, and that really showed through sometimes when he let it. As Peter thought of all of the people living on base, he couldn't help but wonder about the Butterfly Effect and where each of these people would be if it weren't for James Barnes.
On the other side of the world was Bucky, waltzing around with a smirk, acting like he owned the place because let's face it- he does. He tosses open the door to the apartment and finds Steve there, reading a book. The first thing he does is pull Steve off of the couch and into a breath-stealing kiss. He didn't miss the way Steve clung to him. How Steve tightly gripped the fabric of his shirt between his fingers, how he tried to desperately pull him closer although there was already no space between them.
Widow sounds angry as she speaks. "People like you don't care about people. You care about the job, about the money. You're in it for the glory not for setting the world straight."
Some instinct of his told him to lunge over and kick the man right out the window, and he tried, but the man easily jumped over him and when he spun around he saw a blonde man staring down at him.
Peter let out a laugh, but they both knew it was fake. They both knew that Peter didn't have it in him for laughter right now. Neither of them did, to tell the truth. All they wanted was to be together, but it would seem that the world wasn't ready for that just yet.
Peter slid his other hand up underneath Wade's shirt, fingers brushing over his chest. With a smirk, he dragged his blunt nails down Wade's skin, finally stopping at the elastic of Wade's sweats.
Finally, directly to his left was another bed with the young boy he recognized. He was strapped down too, and maybe for good reason, he looked erratic, on the brink of tears.
She insisted that she didn't really know, but if they were letting him see this guy, then he must not be so bad after all. Peter took that thought and held it close. He didn't want to think Wade was a bad guy. He remembers watching the Avengers dragging him into the base, and he remembers that he wasn't fighting. He was barely even being restrained... But everyone was so badly injured, someone had to do it.
He remembers the relieved look on Tony's face when he walked into the tower a couple of days later. The moving day had been moved back a couple of weeks due to the incident, so he was able to stay in bed for a couple of days until it didn't hurt so bad to breathe anymore.
And he felt the safest he'd ever been in his life.
Natasha shrugs. "We can ask, but I doubt Peter would like that. Besides, I'm not sure she could help for very long."
"Why me?"
It warmed their hearts to know that he held Tony so highly. They all knew that his little boy in front of them had the largest heart, and it had room for everybody.
Partway into the night, Bucky makes his way into Peter's room and takes his place next to the door, ready to end anyone that threatens his Spiders tonight. Bucky and Natasha have been together for a very long time, and he'd be damned if he let anything happen to her. He's fully aware that she can take care of herself, but he enjoys putting her first.
Peter sneaks away to see his lover.
And realized that it was empty.
Hands roamed and made quick work of Peter's shirt, perky nipples exposed to the air and to the assault from  Wade's tongue and fingers. Peter gasped, eyes fluttering closed.
this is literally just a shitty filler chapter since I haven't posted in a hot minute
"You were shot?" Wade looked... Angry.
Steve and Bucky share a look, seemingly having a thousand word conversation between them in just seconds. They knew what the other was thinking, and they could already figure what happened. Peter and Wade magically vanishing at the same time wasn't any kind of coincidence... The only thing they couldn't figure is who broke who out.
"It was, and I regretted every day I didn't ask you about it. Even after you confessed finally, I regretted not asking you sooner... We wasted so much time being afraid Steve."
He looked to the table where the cryotube sat. Etched into the side was a code... CX4376. "Of course I do..."
"And as for your...
In the end, Steve begrudgingly agreed to carry the man out and into the jet. They knew that Wade would heal on his own eventually, it was just a matter of time before he came back. Peter just sat there, curled up in a corner with Wade's body laying on the ground in front of him.
He sorta prefers their company to Bruce's now. Especially after what'd happened between them.
"FRIDAY!" He whisper-yelled towards the ceiling. There was no response for several long moments, then came the low hum of power. Rather than being answered by Friday, the answer came from somewhere in the dark. A low growl that once before only existed in the deepest recesses of Peter's subconscious was now somewhere in the room with him, the sound echoing off of the walls to surround him, hoping to scare him into surrendering to his fate.
Wade nodded. "Keep it. It's been a couple days since I saw you last, what've you been up to?"
Despite being able to weave his bike between cars and drive it up sidewalks, Bucky had a feeling that Steve wasn't very far behind him. Bucky swore that if that Wade guy had anything to do with this, he was going to kill him as many times as it took to get the point across that he wasn't the guy to be fucked with.
"She doesn't love you, Peter..."
When Steve got home everything was quiet. The silence didn't faze him anymore, he was used to Bucky being pretty quiet as is. He knew that the trauma made him even quieter. Bucky had yet to come all the way out of that shell, but that was okay. Everyone heals differently.
They walked for a little while along the coast before Peter finally asked WHERE they'd gone. Wade just smiles and says that he'll see soon enough.
Peter stiffened in Wade's grip before thrashing harder, clawing at the arm slung across his chest. He thought he was trapped again, this much Wade could tell. He could hear the desperate gasping for air and the scared whimpers leaving Peter's mouth.
Bruce fixed his glasses. "Well, that's your mistake, kid. It's a good thing Tony isn't with you, I'd hate to have to kill him too."
Bucky shook his head and sighed. "Sick."
Once the data and weapons were confiscated, Sam, Steve, and Peter returned to home base.
Their fronts were very simple, just two names in Peter's handwriting. He opened one and inside were printed files, photos, reports... These were Peter's birth parents. C.I.A. agents. These were the two people that made Peter afraid that the people in his life now might leave him at any given time. That they'd leave him somewhere and never return. These were the two that left him in May's care all those years ago.
"Peter, what happened? Where are we?"
The boy was somehow still tired and falling asleep while standing upright between them, so they took him back to bed. It was difficult for the two bigger men trying to fit in the minuscule bed, but they made it work, and when they were comfortable enough, they managed to fit Peter into the bed as well. The blankets trapped the heat and Peter was no longer shivering, and his watch was no longer vibrating.
Peter roams the halls one night after a nightmare and finds himself turning to the strangest person for help.
He heard the shuffling of feet in the room, and then the Widow was standing over them. "He was sick yesterday. So sick that he came home from school, and I don't think he's ever been that sick in his life, and... And I know he's been with you. I know he leaves campus at lunch and I know that you meet him there, I've seen your texts."
Wade rushed to Peter's side and took his hand. "Oh no baby, I would never let anything like that happen to you... No... But I wasn't fast enough to keep them from spiking your drink. they gave you a drug that would basically make sure that you wouldn't remember... Not their faces, not talking to them, nothing. Your friend MJ stayed over. She and another girl helped me take care of you, and that other girl is gonna help me take care of the guys who did this to you."
What had Wade done? How could he be behind this? How could he do this?
As soon as he came into view in the doorway, it was like something in the room shifted and suddenly his guardian angel was watching over him, his leader, his protector. He gently asked Wanda what happened, she said she didn't know.
"Listen, I think there's something wrong with the serum you gave me." On the other end, silence, but he knew he was being listened to rather intently. "His healing powers are fucked. Some kids drugged him tonight and his body isn't fighting it off as fast as it should. You either need to tell me how to remove the serum, or find me something that'll up his healing abilities back to normal. This wasn't part of the deal."
He told her to get the other girl, MJ, and try and get Peter at least into the living room from here, as he wasn't going to take his eyes off of these asshole addicts. She called for MJ and she came at once, the two of them hauling off an unmoving Peter. He instructed the girls to keep his shoulders elevated, and to make sure he was breathing all the time.
Wade was pacing the small bathroom while waiting out the final stretch of the drugs being in Peter's system. Once he was finally a little closer to normal Wade could get him cleaned up and fed, then eventually to bed. For now, though, he was preoccupied pacing and asking himself just how he managed to let Peter get into this situation in the first place. Why weren't his friends with him? If one of them had been there, maybe his drink wouldn't have been spiked.
He began searching room to room, hoping that he wouldn't stumble upon her as a corpse. Since everything was covered in dust, it was fairly easy to see the clean spots where things had been moved from. May's phone and laptop were just two of the missing things, along with a couple of pairs of shoes, her whole jewelry box and some clothes from her closet. That must mean that May was still alive somewhere.
The 'when' however, occurred in April, long after Peter had last heard from Wade at all.
Peter always had the option to pretend that this man wasn't just asking him to slice himself open for amusement, but he didn't see the point. He didn't know anyone outside of here other than the metal-armed man from inside his head. For some reason, it felt wrong even think about imagining the metal-armed man in his position.
Wade sat up, taking Peter with him before obliging to Peter's wishes and taking his red sweater off. Peter could see the remnants of what once could have been considered a tattoo of sorts, but now the skin was nothing more than burns and dark discoloration. Peter figured it had to have been from a time before Wade's mutation because Wade's healing factor probably wouldn't allow him to have tattoos now.
Steve shifted and sighed. "Yeah, it really is. I'm not gonna say it's not."
Steve's stress was slowly leaving his body as he looked after the two of them. He was quick to realize that this was all he needed, just Nat and Bucky. Stark was too complicated to deal with. Buck and Nat were both very straightforward and blunt, never hiding what they wanted. If they wanted it, they told Steve about it and he did what he could for them.
Scott was sitting next to Rhodey, and Vision sat beside Scott. Steve, to everyone's surprise, was sporting not one, but three weapons. Strapped to his thigh was a large knife, in a shoulder holster was a pistol, and in his hands was a large assault rifle. Nobody wanted to ask if he actually knew how to use it.
They had Peter laying on the floor of this tiny bathroom, quietly protesting as hands touched all over him. Wade slammed one of the boys' heads into the wall and swept a girl's feet out from underneath her as she tried to run.
"Fever?" Steve put his jacket down and Bucky shook his head.
He nods quickly. "What are they gonna do to him?"
Pepper asks what happened to his old clothes and Peter sheepishly says that they're not really his style anymore, and the weight he's put on has distributed differently than before and his pants don't quite fit right anymore. She says that's perfectly fine and she'll help him pick out some new clothes and Tony leaves them to head to the car dealership just down the way to see what's new.
They know that adopting him won't keep him all the way out of the spotlight, but it would help. If he wasn't a hero, the camera wouldn't be on him so much. The most media attention he might get would be from people wondering what it was like being the son of Captain America and Black Widow, or the son of The Winter Soldier. All of his attention wouldn't be about him at all, but about them.
And when the boy let his bloodied hospital gown fall, there was a collective gasp at his wounds. He was covered head to toe and sporting two brand-new bullet wounds.
also, spoiler, if my writing doesn't make it clear, I don't practice and I've never been in confession, so I apologize if I get everything wrong, I hope I don't butcher it too bad and offend anyone.
"You can sleep in the bed just... Stay on your side."
Peter's jaw
There was a flash of memory in his mind of the last few seconds that he saw Peter before he left. When the boy had spoken to him in the Soldier's tongue. His tongue.
MJ had managed to be the one that talked Peter into drinking in the first place and what started out as a small beer quickly turned into about 15 Jell-O shots. Peter's abilities made it a little difficult to get drunk, but this was his first time and he didn't seem to be giving up any time soon.
"And... Your ring?" He asked nervously, twiddling the one that rested on his own finger.
Peter was curled up in Steve's bed still, and he knew he didn't have a fever, so he wasn't sure what it was that was making him so sick. His Spider-sense was bouncing off of the fucking walls so much you'd think it downed 17 cans of Redbull. It was making Peter paranoid, and he couldn't stop shaking it was so bad.
Peter knew that Bucky was watching for the man, which was good because Bucky had a better eagle eye than he did, and he also had a longer attention span than Wade did. Wade at the moment, was being quiet for once, or at least Peter thinks he is... Maybe his hearing-aid isn't turned up all of the way?
Peter, who had zoned out again, blinked. "What?"
So, when he hears the bells in the distance, he asks Nat what they belong to. She tells him that it's a Church, and offers to take him to one if he wants. So, he dresses up in the only pair of pants that will fit him and borrows a button up from Nat, and she drives him to one of the few Catholic churches in Brooklynn Heights. The one that they end up at isn't at all fancy, but it looks to be nearly as old as Steve is, if not older.
. Tony accepted and drove them to the tall apartment building. The ride was quiet but peaceful.
"Do you want to talk about it, Peter?"
"Why do you keep those?" He asked her gently.
Bucky Barnes was a relatively gentle person, but when it came to his family, he would go to the ends of the Earth to protect them, even if it meant his very own life. Even now, he knew that HYDRA would be back, he could feel it in his bones. The whole, cut off one head and two more grow back, ordeal, wasn't entirely inaccurate. They were always two steps ahead, but not of Bucky.
Also, Happy 4th of July!
Crossing the room, he could see the prisoner hold his breath the closer that he got. He understood that it wasn't Natalia that he was afraid of. It was him. The prisoner was afraid of him and for good reason. After all they'd been through, it was only fitting that Bucky be the one person in the world to frighten this man.
"I did it, Mr. Stark, I deserve it... Should've done it a long time ago then... Maybe everything would be different."
And then there was Bucky. He was doing a little of everything. He was going on missions, leading the search, sitting through debriefings and interviews, filling out reports and writing weapons logs. He was keeping all of his own weapons cleaned and his arm well-maintained with the use of Peter's toolbox... Despite how everyone else is doing, they all think he's doing far worse... And they're right. But he would never let them see that.
He almost didn't remember coming here at all. But the longer he stood in front of the glass, watching the man in red, the calmer he felt. He couldn't put his finger on it.
Bucky's lips held a smile though, and his cheeks were flushed a beautiful rosy pink. Steve could never get enough of how gorgeous his boy was. It was a dream come true to be with him every day.
When he was home, he spent a lot of time in Peter's bedroom. Mostly he was just dusting and keeping everything tidy and in working order while the boy was away. He did the same for the apartment he shared with Steve, training Rebecca in the process. The pup followed Bucky's every move and was also in the middle of training to be a support animal. Nobody batted an eye when the man with the metal arm came in with his small dog in arms, quietly asking how much it would cost to have her trained the way he needed.
. The muzzle was wrapped tightly around his jaw and his smudged black makeup did nothing to hide the murderous glee in his eyes. Bucky reached up to his face only to feel the same muzzle underneath his fingertips. And he lost it. He rose like the dead from the bed full of it and stormed over to the mirror. One kick to the center shattered it and sent glass flying.
When Peter woke, he was tucked safely in his bed and for once he felt well rested. He changed and ventured out into the hallway to see Sam coming, looking battered and bruised. Sam looked... Almost frightened.
His Spidey-sense was going haywire, the absolute sheer panic invading his body like a burglar come to make off with all of his belongings. And he screamed. He kicked and he fought.
Peter is over the moon at this gift and he can't even imagine what's in the others. Some of the items come as a surprise to him, as the other bags contain things like a stuffed giant panda, along with a note that mentioned that Wade donated 3k to the World Wide Fund for Nature, three or four of Wade's own t-shirts and a zip-up hoodie that looked suspiciously like Wade's own Deadpool suit, and a brand new professional camera.
He felt weak, useless and stupid that he couldn't remember the easiest things. It wasn't even remotely his fault though, it was theirs, Hydra's. They're the ones who tortured him so badly that he lost every sense of who he was. He didn't have a grip on himself anymore, and sense of his own being. He knew what Hydra wanted him to know, even if it was all fake. He knew that not everything he remembered from there was real.
"You really are good at taking orders, Parker. Granted you needed some motivation, but here you are, obeying like a good little soldier. Just like your dad."
before he took the older man's length into his mouth. Peter made a show of deepthroating the man as far as he could manage, and then some. Rumlow's only response was the occasional grunt and then grabbing Peter's head to keep pushing the boy farther down on the length of his cock.
"Oh, I want you to come home too, Peter... But you can't." The words came as a shock. There was no logical reason why he couldn't come home. Did she not... Want him, anymore? Is that the reason she sent him here, to begin with? Because she wanted to be rid of him?
"Bucky is with Peter. Let him worry about that for now. Worry about what you can do right now. Bruce, and Rumlow. Those are your options."
They'd been curled up on the couch for a couple of hours when a cold front moved in, and you could feel it through the whole apartment. Peter came out of the bedroom around that time, wrapped in blankets but still shivering like the devil, watch vibrating on his wrist. They both stood then, encapsulating the smaller boy in their arms. Their bodies produced enough heat now that the cold wouldn't bother them nearly as much as it bothered Peter.
Baffled, Tony threw his arms up. "How can you not know, FRIDAY? You see everything that happens in this building? What does the security footage say?"
"James Barnes. I know."
And poor Peter, more confused now than before, took the paper and unfolded it... And he just stared, with and empty, blank face and heart. He couldn't comprehend exactly what he was looking at, though he could see it clear as day.
Tony shook his head. "Don't worry about it. Just take care of Peter."
Once they reached the third basement level, they traveled down a couple more long hallways that Peter thought looked the same to all the others. Tony pressed a few buttons and a glass wall swung open. Bucky and Steve threw Deadpool into the room and Tony promptly closed the door.
"Don't suppose you'd try and keep me out," he said, and all Peter did was let out a short breath of air through his nose. Of course, he couldn't keep him out, he was inside his head after all. This hallucination was the only person that treated him like a person, and he wasn't even a person at all. But he remembered things that Peter didn't. The man was a part of his subconscious, the only thing protecting his memories. When they spoke, he'd only tell Peter little bits at a time, and then he'd go quiet.
"He's not aimed to kill you... He's pointed at your legs. He'll shoot to immobilize you first... With all of the adrenaline in your body right now, you'd be able to keep going through the pain and seriously injure, if not kill him." James put his hand over Peter's to still his shaking hand.
The two continued on, making love in a rickety bed. The creaking sound of the bed frame mixed in with the sound of their moans, and it was almost like a song the way the tones pressed together, just how those boys were. Pressed together so closely that nothing could ever come between them. Lips and tongues meeting somewhere in the middle of it all, dancing together like a couple at a ball.
"I'm sure you have questions, so I'll answer the basics. As I'm sure you know, you're in an underground Hydra base at an undisclosed location. The fact that you led your... Family, here. Means that you know where we are anyways so there's no point in the formalities. You were tricked and lied to by people you trusted, they work for us. I won't tell you who, because on the very slim chance that you ever leave here, we don't want you running your mouth."
Figuring that he wouldn't be back here again for a while, he took his duffle bag from his room and his suitcase and stuffed them both full with most of the things that he left behind. He resorted to putting things in his backpack when he filled both of those up. He really had no intention of attending school today. He knew that by now his parents would all be out of the house, so it would be safe to go home.
"Not even Peggy?"
Wade gave Peter a little nudge to distract him from Stark and Peter's attention went straight back to Bucky and the Puppy, who seemed totally happy standing on her three legs and wagging her little tail.
there's smut in this one
He remembers seeing colorful lights and sparkly ornaments on a too-small tree, but nothing that happened around said tree. Well, nothing except a small dog and loud laughter and a pair of shiny shoes. The dog he remembered was now not so small and was standing by the counter with Bucky.
Steve wasn't sure why Bucky was so worked up about it, but it didn't matter. He had to think quickly, Tony only had a few more seconds at most and as much as he'd like to see him choked, he wasn't about to let Bucky go down for killing Tony Stark.
"Eddie, will you get these off of me?" Peter pleaded, watching as the blonde glanced behind him before walking over and undoing the leather straps. "Where are we?"
...And then his cries were over as suddenly as they began, and he was dead silent, eyes shifting as if he was listening for something. And he was. Very faintly Peter could hear the vibrations of his cell phone. He stormed over to it and ripped it out of his jacket pocket.
"I oughta lock you up just like that assassin back there, because that's what you could have been today Peter! That's what you-"
The next morning, Peter was pulled from his cell once again and led back to the room with the tools. Again, he was told what to use and what to do with them and once again the imaginary man with the metal arm was there, suggesting different ways to kill Rumlow and escape... There were over 200 men down here, and God knows how many floors were really above him.
Just the thought of being like- No, focus. This is for Peter. Peter. Holy shit, what'd I do to Peter? I can't believe I- Wade can't believe he did that to Peter... It wasn't going to make anything better, and he's so sure that Peter won't want anything to do with him after the second half of the plan sets into motion...
Tony looked up at him and asked, as best as he could manage, "Are you okay?"
The man feigned hurt, "Damn, you don't' recognize us? It's probably hard, I know, here."
Bucky nodded, hands over Steve's. "We can bring him home."
The call ended and she looked at Peter's phone screen for a second before putting a password lock on it and tucking it into her pocket so Peter wouldn't be tempted to do anything stupid with it, and then she let him sit back down on the ground before sitting with him.
When Wade turned around, the barrel of a gun was in his face. He felt Peter grip tighter onto him in fear, but before he could get a single word out, the trigger was pulled. Peter screamed as chunks of brain and blood splattered back and covered his face. Wade's body fell, crumbling to the floor with a sickening whump.
Bucky was off to the side, leaning against the wall next to the door. He'd done his part. He'd brought Peter in for the help that Peter himself would have refused if given the choice.
"I think next year we'll get a bigger tree. This little one's getting lost in all these gifts." She smiles, and he agrees. The only part of the poor little tree still visible is the little star on the very top.
Knowing he'd receive no verbal answer, he hung up and put his phone down. Less than a minute later a text from a blocked number came through with a time and place to meet for an additive serum to repair Peter's healing abilities. Three days from now, high noon, just a few blocks from here. Then, he'd be able to fix Peter's healing ability back to normal and hopefully wouldn't have to deal with anything like this again.
Steve didn't waste any time in undressing them, but he always took his time with Bucky. He always took the time to get him relaxed and ready, took the time to make him feel loved and beautiful. Because he was.
She was silent. She wasn't going to argue with him, not right now. Not when she was trying to handle the fact that he was just going to be up and swept away again without hardly any notice whatsoever. She was getting fed up with this life of theirs.
She looked over her shoulder and there he was, the boy she called her son, staring at them both, now wide awake.
That made Tony hurt, and that's exactly what Bucky wanted. He wanted Tony to hurt right now for those things he said to Peter.
The sobs leaving his lips were uncontrollable, bordering on hysterics, as Bucky ran into the room. Friday had seemed oddly panicked for an AI as she alerted them to Peter's heart rate and general unresponsiveness. Steve didn't think he'd ever seen Bucky clear two floors that quickly. He skidded to a stop and knelt next to Peter on his bed.
Bucky had been teaching him weapons, as had Nat. Steve taught him more hand-to-hand, as you can never be too over-prepared in this line of work. Bucky thought he was pretty good with guns, but if Peter wasn't ready, then he wasn't ready, and that was okay.
Peter was almost in hysterics, saying something along the lines of, "They said he did this to me!"
It was hard enough trying to get some sleep with all of your parents on base, but it was another thing entirely for all four of them to be away at once.
Peter emerged from the bedroom, hair still a mess and looked up at Wade with tired eyes. Wade threw together a cup of instant coffee for the little spider and Peter was thankful, to say the least. He sat on the floor by the fire and sipped from his cup.
He heard the Merc laugh before letting out a breath. "I'm Wade. Good to meet you Petey."
He was leaned against the headboard, just staring at the wall across from him. Today was definitely going to be difficult. Memories were presenting themselves to him despite a month of peaceful, ignorant bliss. No matter how much he blinked, he couldn't shake the memories he was being presented with and the fact that Wade had left at some point didn't help in the slightest.
For once in his life, it seemed, he was quiet. And then he spoke, in a hushed tone to the redhead, wherever she stood. "Did he do this to himself?"
They both knew that it was nothing they could promise. There was no guarantee that nothing would happen to them. But for now, they could pretend.
"But I-I don't... I don't know what to do..." Peter sounded nervous, but he also sounded frustrated by not knowing.
Despite his arms being in chains that hung from the wall, he tried to reach out to touch the boy. The boy flinched a little at the sudden movement and Wade apologized for startling him.
"Hey, Peter, you're okay, he's not gonna hurt you."
Peter nodded slowly, not breaking eye contact with the man in front of him. "You're the man from inside my head..."
"No, I don't want to-"
"There's no us, I am NOT like you."
"To be fair, you deserved it. But I've got no proof that you'll keep your word. You're Hydra. You betrayed the Captain, you raped Peter, you got May Parker killed. We trusted you, before. With our lives, Brock, and this is where that got us. You have to give me something else."
we love a bucky-centric chapter but y'all finna hate me
, clay-to-cream cleanser, watermelon sleeping mask,
A car pulled up next to his bike and he quickly aimed the gun at it. Steve emerged from inside, hands raised. Bucky lowered his weapon and held up the watch.
"You hear a lot, don't you Romanoff? Who'd you hear it from? If you tell me, I'll tell you who's above me."
so sorry I didn't get this out to you yesterday! I'm gonna try and get it out super early today! // what are your timezones & what time is it for you?
Once they geared up and got to where they were meant to go, they were shocked to find the building completely empty... They'd been so close... Bucky fell to his knees after they searched the building over for the third time. "He's really not here..."
"Hey, Pete... We're sorry, alright? We didn't mean to frustrate you." Steve says gently and Peter shakes his head, long strands of hair falling into his eyes.
Wade was losing himself in the feeling of fucking Peter against the wall. He got violent with it, one hand in Peter's feathery hair, his other arm around Peter's waist to hold him in place. He fucked Peter this time like it might be the last time. It was hard and quick and deep and Peter was loving it, moaning out like a cheap whore as drool dripped down his chin. He wanted to wreck Peter, wanted to make sure that he'd remember this when everything went to shit.
But why? If the bad guys did this, why would they do it at all? Why make him able to carry children? Was it a mistake? A trial serum? Or did the bad guys have a bigger plan in mind for them? Did the universe?
"Don't try and stop me, Steve, you know what he did."
"You blatantly disregarded everything I told you before you even went back there, what makes you think-"
why do people even come down this lane?
The whole base was on high-alert while Peter was missing. Every single one of those S.H.I.E.L.D. agents bustling about in the hallways knew just how protective the Supers were of the young boy. Peter, being the youngest of them all, was special. He was meant to be protected at all costs.
He could hear Bucky's breaths and he could almost feel his long exhales. He could almost see Bucky leaning against a wall with a cigarette between his fingers.
