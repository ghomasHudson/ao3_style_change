“I will haunt you with very chaotic and slightly perverted thoughts until you come back to your senses,” Tony said. “Listen, we’re supposed to be the Avengers, and we are the good guys. I want to be a good guy, don’t you?”
After nearly a year, he’s on his way to finding Steve. Why should he be concerned? The man left him high and dry and never looked back. For Christ’s sake, Tony thought he’d died in a damned fire. He found out the truth of it when Natalia or Natasha or whatever the hell her name is walked into his life and turn upside down the unsettling reality he’d been finally able to accept.  It took some time to get her to spill the beans. In other words, it took Tony finally nearly dying again because of the poisoning in his blood for her to come clean. As he watches the sights of the city run by him from the cab window, Tony recalls how he’d finally broken down and she along with her boss man finally came clean.
“Hmm. Yeah. Kinda did today,” Steve says, and the warmth of embarrassment spreads over his face.
Silence again.
Steve wanted to reach out to Tony; he would in the dream space. Why wouldn’t he now? This was the dream space, wasn’t it?  He extended his hand, leaving his palm open to Tony. “It felt like home to me too. Probably the one I miss the most.”
“Excuse me, but why not just use the Blight again?” Steve asked.
“Of course,” Steve says. He supposes that’s points for him. He’d been told the prince rarely allows the escort to stay even if he’d been on assignment for the entire week.
He seethes. “Yes, it’s Tony. Tony’s a complicated person with complicated issues. Working this assignment has been challenging.” His mind races as he tries to figure out exactly why he’s here, what he needs. It comes to him. Steve bites back his lips, not sure he should ask. There’s no way out now. “I need a favor.”
Tony chuckles. “I believe in the abolitionist’s cause but not in their practicality.  There are rights I believe in, but I’m a scientist when it comes down to it. I know there are differences between us.”
He’s amazed but he’s not saying that. “You’re close.”
His body shudders and Tony hovers close to him, slipping onto the gurney next to him. “Steve?”
“And we can find Clint,” Steve says and his doubts vanish, but the rolling river before him churns his fears. “It ain’t going to be easy.”
“Not falling is always the tricky part, but I can try.” Tony adjusts his hold and it nearly throws Steve off balance. He compensates quickly.
“Lucky me,” Steve mutters as they take the gantry and are back at the safety of the ship. Instantly, the bravado of the past half hour dissipates. He wavers on his feet, but the prince is there to catch him.
“Well then, if I’m here to defile you, I might as well get a good peek at that broad chest of yours,” Tony says and begins to unbutton Steve’s semen stained shirt. He doesn’t fight against it, he allows it, welcomes it.
The man’s brows knit together and his full lips form a grimace. He doesn’t have on a shirt, only a pair of loose pants that are slung low on his hips. “Then we start with you undressing and getting to your knees, omega. And you will not speak unless I allow it.”
Peering over his shoulder, the omega says, “I am bound by my oath not to tell you.”
Abruptly, Clint laughs and the whole scene begins to move again. It’s so dizzyingly sudden that Steve tastes bile at the back of his throat. He swallows it down with a cringe.
“No, just let him. Go ahead Sam what else do you have to say, hmm? Living here under my roof -.”
Steve whines and then says, “Fuck, just do it Tony. I want you, please.”
“No, Steve, no,” Bucky says. “You need this, you need to get away. Ever since, ever since Stark-.”
Luke grinned and for a second Steve regretted his noble decision.
He stops at the right apartment and she points to the door across the hall. “You’re visiting my neighbor?”
Sitting up straighter, Steve instructs, “Now tuck your legs around me.”
“Thank you.”
Being with Steve brings insecurities that should have been sealed up and packed into the back of a trunk somewhere forever. Tony holds onto Steve as they veer through the streets, as they head away from the city without a destination in mind. Tony wishes he didn’t need to wear the helmet. It wants to rest his cheek against the length of Steve’s back, he wants to feel the reality of the moment and know that they are, in fact, on the same trajectory. Here, clasped against Steve, he doesn’t feel isolated and alone in the darkness but suddenly aware. The rest of his life – even when he could see – has been a dull prison, but now something new and transformative has occurred. The fear that Steve might not feel it too beckons like a monster in that dark that Tony’s confined.
“But he -. All mine?”
Blu sits a distance off, licking himself dry as Tony prepares the fish and then starts a fire with the branches that he finds around their little camp. There’s not nearly enough fish for both of them, but Tony splits the fish into two portions and gives the larger one to the lion. He eats it happily and, with his large tongue, licks his lips. He paws Tony, being careful to keep his claws retracted.
Pain and purpose streaked her features. It warred there, a quiet desperation to flee and leave them behind changed the colors of her eyes. With no other recourse, he agreed and slowly released his grasp on Steve. Even if they got off this roof, the likelihood that Natasha had calculated wrong – that there would be casualties still tainted the air. How would they escape? What was the plan? Clint eyed him and waited until Tony stepped up to the elevator door, waited until Tony’s chest burned bright with the fire of his rage, waited until Tony raised his hands – already glowing – and nodded.
“JARVIS send the schedule to the duchess and the prince for final approval, please.” He wants to ensure he does this by the book. While he’s always had a problem with authority (ask Bucky and Peggy if there are any doubts), Steve also knows it’s important to confirm he didn’t miss anything that’s glaringly important to the prince. Once JARVIS verifies that the information has been sent, Steve goes to the bathroom to prepare.
They exited the building and headed toward the nearest metro. Steve glanced at Clint. “You have any luggage?”
“You sneaky little shit.”
“And what job is that, dear Sheriff?”
“I went looking for Hydra cells. SHIELD had clandestine stations all over the world. Some of them are the good guys,” he said with a shrug. “Some of them not so good.”
exactly what to do. It’s not magic, it’s not a mystical soul bond, it’s simply what anyone would do for someone they cared about that’s hurting. He climbs to his feet and stands over Steve, offering him a hand up. For a second Steve only stares at him but then he grabs Tony like a lifeline and accepts the help. Tony knows it’s only a first step, but it’s a step. He scoops up the shield for Steve and then in silent agreement they head back to the house.
“I understand,” Samantha says. “Now I’m going to give you my tablet and you can go through all of the options and select your limit.” She stands and Steve goes to follow her, but she gestures for him to stay seated. “I am going to go and pull a few files for you. You will then be able to select-.”
Steve lowers his gaze again. “I trusted you time and again, Tony. You kept doing things that I didn’t agree with. You made Ultron, and you made Vision. But I kept on believing in you. I did time and again.” Steve closes his eyes. “The world is a different place than when I grew up. You know.” He looks back at Tony. “When I was a little kid, there was this guy across the hall from us. He was in the Great War, the war to end all wars. But we weren’t allowed to ask him about it. He probably had PTSD or something. I don’t know. You just didn’t talk about things. The lady down the hall, she ended up with cancer. But no one spoke about it. You just didn’t.”
Before Steve opened his eyes, he said, “Yeah, I’m still here.”
As he begins to go through the computer program he’s writing for the suit, the door creaks and then cranks open, and he jerks around to see that the leader has decided his shorten his respite. Raza scans the room before discovering Tony at the work bench. He barks something at Tony and his soldiers hurry into the room, yanking Steve from his huddled position on the floor and dragging him – half asleep – to his knees on front of Tony.
He dreams of kneeling at Tony’s feet, letting Tony use his mouth for whatever he needs in a near devotional ritual of love. He loves the taste, the weight, the heaviness. He wants it to last forever, he sits here for every single minute of the day and night if that’s what Tony wants.
Chapter 16 will be posted near the end of October. Sorry! Still working on my BB.
He stays until dawn somedays. He watches as the sun bleeds in through the curtains of the arched window in Tony’s private room. And then it is the day, the moment of truth. They slowly bring him out of the induced coma. The doctors are standing around like it’s a freak show and Steve wants them gone. He wants to sit with Tony and watch him wake, like he always does. He wants to be that security that Tony needs when he opens his eyes and needs to orient. But he doesn’t have the luxury.
“Damn fool, is what he is,” Bucky says as he leans against the doorframe of their one room flat. “If he’d a let me come with-.”
Tony cleans up, taking extra care to wash the grease from his hands and face. He straightens his hair, puts on a new shirt and even throws on a leather jacket. When he meets Steve in the lobby, the tension he tried to wash away ratchets up. This whole romance teeters on the point of a knife and Tony can’t fathom why. He’s usually so good at this. Romance is his forte.
“Not really,” Steve says. “We’ll just watch. From here.” He stays put near the house and grabs Tony to keep him planted in place.
Ross stepped away, slipping his finger out of the stab wound. The thin blood dripped on the floor. “You know Barton never let on. He never told us it was you.” Ross snickered. “He did have some loyalty to his Captain, I suppose. I can’t blame him for that, but I will. He will suffer that we had to wait so long to figure it out.”
“All of them, Tony, all of them. One subject. Just one subject,” Pepper said, and her hands trembled as she tapped on the console.
“I’d love to see the observatory with you,” Steve whispers.
Yet, Steve couldn’t touch Tony without cringing and racing away. That happens to be the cherry on top when Tony thinks about it. The bizarre middle distance stare, the feeling as if Steve’s walking between his past and present. Maybe Tony isn’t all that Steve had hoped, maybe he’s looking for a way to go back to Logan. Tony throws down the last of his work. If this is going to work, then Steve needs to be honest with him. Starting with lunch today, Tony vows to figure out what the hell is going on.
“Just instinct and what Ma needed,” Steve whispers. “Just relax. It’s sometimes nice to have music playing in the background. But this works too.”
“Estane?” A plate is given to Steven, though he doesn’t have the variety of foods that Tony has been afforded; there’s still plenty. It is a simpler fare since even though he’s part of the executive branch, he’s still an omega and by definition a servant. Steven has porridge, fruit, and fresh bread. A mug of coffee is also offered to him which he accepts.
"Aunt Peggy," he says and crossed the distance between them. He leans down, she embraces and kisses him. It feels like acceptance and home. He feels shame.
“I’m going to scissor my fingers and open you up. You like that. Feel me opening you. You need me to open you, you’re gonna take me all in. All of you. I’m gonna pound you.” Steve quakes with need as he feels the walls of Tony’s entrance push against his long fingers. He twists and opens and twists and opens. It’s tight and Steve forces himself to wait it out.
"You talk in flowery language, sir." Tony's hands on his knees burn and he wants nothing more but to jump up and race away, but that isn't true. No. It isn't true at all. He holds back, fists his hands not to grab Tony and jerk him up and plaster his lips against that arrogant mouth. The flame of the candle flickers in Tony’s eyes.
Steve turns and looks at the beers. “I just.” He rubs at the back of his neck. “I thought maybe we could maybe sit and watch a movie. JARVIS told me you were on your way home.”
Tony shook his head. “No, I don’t care, I don’t fucking care.” He battered Steve. Hit him over and again with clenched fists against Steve’s chest. The sobbing wouldn’t stop. “He killed her. He killed my mother, my mom.”
“Sure am.” He squeezes Steve’s arm. “Can’t wait to see them pecs!” He giggles. “Pepper would kill me. I’m harassing you.”
Steve hadn’t asked for money. Or stock. He’s an artist. He works on comic books. Why would he mark Tony as someone to con. Then Tony remembers that Steve had been down to his last few bucks when he hired him. It all made sense now. Tony had been an easy mark, but then again, he’d trusted Steve with his most important secret.
“Steve,” Natasha says and wipes away the sweat on his brow. “You should have seen him when he first arrived in Wakanda. He was half crazed when he found out. He would do anything for you.”
He spells out the whole story. After he finishes, Steve says, “He was fine. We were taking a break from all the work. I thought it was a good idea for him to relax a little.”
“Spasm chasms?” Natasha asked.
“Nice.”
A shiver answered him and then Steve shifted, and Tony felt the hardness of his cock against his inner leg. Steve brought Tony closer and their chests touched, but all Tony could think of was Steve and how he responded, how he was turned on by Tony. It might be ridiculously foolish but it made him so fucking happy. “I want, I want to feel you Tony.”
Happy is not the word Steve would use when Tony decides the best plan of action is just to march down to the farm and say hello. As Steve warned him, this isn’t like playing house. Ultron is using the information on Barton – however he found it – to lure them in for some specific purpose.
“Fuck. Okay. Tell Obie not to do anything, and I mean anything, until I arrive.”
“They say, sir, that there is a hide away near the edge of the village. Out near the plateau, near the caverns,” JARVIS says.
“Well, you know what I mean,” Tony says and finishes the repair. “Now I declare it’s time for our morning coffee!”
Kneeling she says to Tony, “Move the table.”
“God, that does not sound good,” Steve said and cringed at his own voice.
“Do you mind?”
Whipping around, he’s just on time to see Tony, slowly, inexplicably, slide out of his saddle and plunge into the freezing current.
Steve muffles his reply. He studies Tony, still clad in the armor. No backpacks at all. “You lost the backpacks?”
With nothing to lose and all the information to gain, he answers, “My mother, I remembered my mother.”
“What kind of second chance is being dead?” The old anger backs up in his throat burning it with bile.
Tony lifts his chin in understanding. “It’ll get better.”
It doesn't matter what his logical brain screams at him; he's going with the irrational part of his brain that's pretending he's some super hero or better yet some knight in shining armor off to rescue his love. He's going to forgo calling pepper or Rhodey because that's all on the logical side of the equation and he's way over on the other side - probably the quantum emotional side at this point where the feeling in his gut over rules every argument in his head. It's balanced that way, right?
Of course that’s when the door crashes open. Tony leaps to his feet to be confronted by a man with dark long hair, a seething expression, and a metal arm.
It wants Tony.
She offers him a cup with a small plate of cookies. He thinks it’s something odd and strange but it helps comfort him. Samantha sips her tea and says, “I understand this is your first time here and I want to make you feel at ease. So as a sub-omega why don’t you tell me exactly what you would want?”
Whisper quiet, Tony came to stand next to him. His hands gently pulled Steve around, revealing Steve’s shame. “Tell me.”
With a dry throat, Steve said, “Yeah?”
“You’re on the frontlines?” He supposes it’s not a surprise. She’s a fit woman and intelligent.
Steve considered whether Thor might be playing him but decided to take it at face value. He thumbed behind him. “You want something to eat? I was going to make something.” Steve couldn’t remember the last time he ate, and he was famished.
“Yeah, I think we might have tried a little before, you know.” Steve leaned closer, his lips only inches from Tony’s mouth. “Maybe this time doesn’t have to be so rushed.”
Here everything glows and sparkles with shine and chrome and it’s beautiful. Where he used to live, life consisted of dust and dirt and a whole lot of hunger. Why humans ever journeyed out to the stars, Steve will never know. Seems a pretty stupid proposition to him, considering not many planets were Earth like – or so they say – Steve will never know. He’s only heard the tall tales of Earth. It’s just a legend.
“No, but I believe in something finer, better, and much more exciting?”
“Why don’t you go back to the ship? I’ll contact you soon,” Tony says. He leaves, not giving her a chance to refuse him. He doesn’t want her to follow. He doesn’t need her to follow. He wants to settle back into his rightful nature. Something he regularly denies. It will be a release to allow himself to be – to be a prime, to be a dom, to be an alpha. He hits the lift touchpad and the elevator car appears. With a short wave to Pep, he gets in and the elevator descends at his command.
Steve points to a cushioned chair and takes a seat opposite it. “No. That’s Kate across the hall. She’s a nurse. Natasha is one of my partners at SHIELD.”
Without glancing back over his shoulder, he says, “You don’t have to worry about me, Buck. You can tell Nat and Sam and whomever else is up in arms about it. I can handle Tony Stark.”
Steve had access into the compound. The retinal scan and blood sample from a finger prick opened the secured gates. Clint drove the sedan to a parking spot in the small garage and, as Steve opened the car door, he heard the doors to the garage close. Previously, Steve called Tony on the burner phone Sam gave them to detail the car and their arrival time. The whole place, the woods, the meadows, everything was rigged to spot and defend. Clint jumped out of the car and smiled at Steve. They’d known each for years now, and Steve swore he never saw Clint in the safe house – though that was to be expected since it was Tony’s and not actually the coven’s place. Tony had once said he built it years before he was turned, as a haven to get away from the paparazzi and, as far as Steve knew, it stayed secure from the eyes of the outside world.
“Should we call in Bruce?” Natasha asked as she went over some of the supplies Hill delivered to them and then excused herself.
Experiencing Steve’s fingers stroking through his hair, over his head, down around his shoulders and neck and then up to his eyes and temples calms Tony. He drifts into the memories that his mind has created for him – memories that don’t exist, but he’s constructed over the years of sightlessness. A cabin on a still lake. It’s the autumn of the year and the leaves are fiery in color, yet the birds and the insects are quiet. He watches a single leaf fall from the tree and then touch the glassine surface of the lake like a kiss. It’s all perfect as long as he never opens his eyes.
“What? Where?” Tony can’t feel his fingers; he can’t feel his body yet at the same time he tingles with anxious energy.
Instinctively, Steve knew that Tony’s inert form lay behind him. Maybe it was the soul waves or the pulse of the energy through his own neurons, but he knew, and he understood that his broken body shielded Tony against an onslaught attack by a bereaved Winter Soldier.
Steve doesn’t know why but as he stands, he says, “Why not? You are.”
“Holy shit!” Tony says and hauls Steve to his feet. “I would love to have you warm my cock anytime.”
“Don’t worry, I’ll be right there,” Tony says, and he lightly kisses Steve’s lips. “Now on to the luncheon.”
Ross paused in front of Steve before he departed, he said to Rumlow, “It is such a waste. Isn’t?”
Stark chuckles and shares a look with Banner. “I’d just cut the wire.” He shakes his head. “And I heard about you from my dad, can’t say I’m all that impressed. I don’t need this crap.”
The thick revolting liquid gurgled down his throat as he fought to keep it down. Steve shuddered, and his vision hazed and pixelated. Gooseflesh rose on his body and even the charred skin on his mid-section went cold. He downed the drink and let the tears flow. The evilness of the place he used to work hit him – a place he once thought redeemable. It wasn’t – never was. It had been infected with a parasite inside of it. The V-Corps could have served as a conduit, a go between to the two different communities, but men – men like Ross and Pierce disrupted it and infested with evil ideals.
“It’s a matter of getting the nanites to resonate with at the same quantum – let’s say – frequency for the less educated in the room,” Tony remarks.
Tony curled his arms around his torso, not allowing anyone to see the markings that wove up his arm and disappeared under his short shirt sleeve. He’d intended to wear the under armor that he had been working on, not just a Dead Head t-shirt, but time too short.
Steve suppressed the urge to whip out his Captain America voice and lecture Bruce, especially since he didn’t know what or how to do any of this. He swallowed down his qualms and nodded.
Of course, Tony couldn’t leave it alone. “What did you intend?”
Tony looks up to Natasha whose standing near the hearth and she nods. “You arrived in this place we think about 15 years ago.”
“Don’t worry Steve, you can only mess up once in these old buckets?”
It doesn’t hit the lion – it hits Tony, firing the armor’s capacitors. JARVIS warns of overload and Tony shoots off another repulsor. His aim goes wild but thankfully, it hits the vehicle. Hunter screams and runs to one of his fallen soldier, picking up a AR15 as the crackles of lightning flash over Tony’s suit. He’s lucky it hasn’t fried his skin yet. The maniac tumbles down on the roadway, semi-automatic in hand and shoots without regard to aim. The bullets go wide, but then he seems to focus targeting directly at the big cat who has turn his attention fully to his captor.
It only serves to lead him further into the tunnels, the long and lonely places of his memories.  These tunnels, the catacombs of his nightmares fill with faces of the dead, here to torment him for living, for surviving when they did not.  As he walks through the dreaded caverns, the ghosts take up a line behind him, chanting and mocking him.
“I already ate,” Steve says and rests on the blanket on the floor.
“Each group of stars is one of the souls in our pack,” Tony said. He reached up and turned the projection. “This is you, in the middle. You’re the core of it. Everything revolves around you.”
“Table? I think? Maybe my nightstand?” Tony runs a hand through his hair and Pepper exhales loudly and into his face. He coughs at her.
If he was a virgin. If he had ever had anyone before – another alpha.
“I asked for him to be here in…” She pauses and checks her watch. “In two minutes If you need anything just touch the keypad on the doorframe.”
He pushes past Barnes and goes to the single window, staring out at the world that doesn’t know, doesn’t realize how his perception of reality shifted today, a quake of seismic proportions cracked his life in two. The before and the after.
“Fine.”
“I thought you, as a perfectionist, would love this,” Tony says as he spreads his arms.
She pats his hand. “Go before I change my mind. Skye isn’t one of my girls you know, she’s her own woman.”
“Oh, yeah. You are. I didn’t leave you.”
Somewhere along the way his hat’s tumbled off and he only pauses for a second to yank off his boots before he climbs into the bed. He tries to be gentle, Tony’s only just recovering, but his brain misfires and he’s clawing at Tony, wanting so much to feel this, to feel something other than worry, pain, concern, shame, and longing. It always wraps up into a numbing ball inside of him causing him to walk around like the dead – wasted and ashen inside.
“It’s different than that, though,” Bruce remarks.
“Nice,” Natasha returned. “No. Confidant.”
Steve snickered in return. “Not necessary.” He raced off down the pathway over the hill toward the creek. He heard Sam take off into the air. The last few days had been different for Steve. Not only with Tony but with the team. Things felt different. Together on the farm, the team not only worked on their battle prowess but also bonded in other ways. Laura had taken part in it too. At night she suggested they spend time at the fire pit and they all roasted marshmallows and cooked hotdogs as Thor told stories of the Nine Realms.
“He's family.”
The army floods the plains around the fortress and Bucky has no other choice but to call on Sam for assistance. He can't get to the ramp way into the fortress without over a dozen Skull troopers spotting him. He could take out half but then the others would most certainly kill him.
Her voice came in crisp over the comm. “We got hostiles closing on positions north of the fork.”
Tony, who’s tucked into the bed with a number of dubious mechanical and other questionable things lying about him, claps his hands. “It’s nothing of the sort, Captain. I have much more dangerous things about.” He snickers and smiles at the same time. It’s disarming.
Tony slams the hammer down, because sometimes, sometimes he feels like Michelangelo and he knows he's on the precipice of greatness. He only needs to jump. The fragments of his thoughts scatter about him in large holographic displays. He sweeps his hands around and the images dance around him like a ballet. He flings the thoughts in different directions, following and chasing at the same time. He immersed himself in the elegant language, the ideas, the possibilities when he came back to the Tower - the Avengers Tower that isn't anymore. He began to work and didn't stop.
“Ambushed by terrorists who were paid for by the guy I thought of as a father,” Tony said. He snickered but didn’t elaborate. Steve prodded him. “The terrorists wanted me to build them bombs. I nearly died but they had a vampire there. He turned me. I should have died, but he saved me. I couldn’t save him, though. The terrorists gave me to Yinsen, the vampire. I can’t remember much, but I know he apologized after.” Tony stroked his hand up and down Steve’s arm, raising the hairs as he did.
Tony chuckles. It feels hollow like he’s a bird ready to fall from the sky with empty bones and no blood left. “No. Not real.” But Blu was real to Tony. In every way but in reality. “He was a little stuffed animal. I carried that toy around for years. Even when I went to college and grad school, I had Blu with me.”
The screaming echoes through the jailhouse. Every howl, every cry, every sob stabs into Steve's heart as if the dagger that pierced through Bucky's back and side sliced him instead. Doctor Banner threw him out of the room when he couldn't help any longer, when it became apparent that just the thought of what they needed to do to Bucky caused him to lose all semblance of rational thought.
Only a single terrorist enters. The figure is completely shrouded by veils. Raza has never allowed a woman in the prison before, Tony waits, measuring, weighing what’s happening. Everything seems off kilter.
“It’s not an infestation,” the caped wonder said. His stare hardened like crystal. “Magic has always been part of the universe. Believe me, I was as surprised as any other.” He dragged a finger along the table, leaving not a streak of oil in the polish but instead a lingering flare of magic. “It’s part of a bigger world, a larger universe we’re only now starting to truly understand.”
With a final glance over his shoulder, the Silver Knight cringes. They close the distance, and he might not make the Gap of Convallis. At their lead, the Silver Knight recognizes the Red Knight himself. If they capture him, then his soul be damned. He has nothing to lose. He curses his luck and screams at his riding beast. It’s not the beast’s fault that he’s been stupid and been spotted by the Black Widow. His own bad luck and ill-timed decision lie at the heart of his troubles. He knows this, but still the beast remains his only hope of surviving.
THE END.
“You need to eat. I can’t hold them off for too much longer.”
The words shocked Steve like a ram to the heart. “What?”
“There you go.” Rumlow directed the agents to get him to his feet.
She’s silent for a moment. “Okay. But please remember what I said and answer some of my text messages once in a while. Maybe pick up the phone some time.”
“You know exactly why.” Steve has no sympathy for him. “Now, take my hand and we’ll walk down the pier. You can feel the wind on your face. Listen to the gulls.”
“Well, what about you? You’re the expert in his physiology. What do you think?” Tony asked as he shook off the last grogginess of sleep.
The agents battered Steve with fists as well as superficial knife wounds over the next five minutes. No matter what Tony did, his spiritual form didn’t intervene, but then he noticed his physical body shuddering on the gurney. With no idea whether or not it was responding to his desperation, Tony concentrated on it.
“Interesting. But I hope you don’t see me as some wild animal to be tamed.”
“The Core is the Soul. The Core is in me. I am the Soul,” Steve said as Natasha, Sam, and Hill fell into step. He heard each of them chanting it along with him, even Hill who must find a simple comfort in it. When it was time to leave Natasha, he gripped her hand and said, “Keep lines open.”
“Please, Steve, please!”
He wasn’t aware that Stark had a home in town. “Hmm, yeah sure.” Instantly, he feels underdressed even in the middle of a barn. “I’ll tie up my horse and-.”
“Truths?” Tony said and left the workbench. He hadn’t missed the slip about last night. What could that mean? Should he investigate, prod, push Steve to admit what that slip actually meant? He walked around the bench and joined Steve in the open space in the U shaped workspace. “What do you mean?”
“It’s fine. Have a good time and don’t get attached.”
The Avengers are gone.
Steve takes in a breath but he can’t stop himself from trembling, from the pain of a thousand nights overcoming him and hitting him. “He didn’t mean it. He was beside himself in agony afterward when he came back to himself. He was always trying to make it up to me after. He picked up my shield and saved me on that train because he thought so little of himself. He said to me once that he would gladly die for me. That it was the least he could do for me.” He’s crying openly now and he’s not ashamed, not of that. But of the fact that he could never fully and completely forgive Bucky. He never said it, not once.
Tony nodded. “Good to see you’re feeling better, what with the lack of like everything you had when you arrived.” Tony gestured over Sam’s entire body making him frown. “Well, you’re good now. All better. Miracles and all.”
“Understandable. I get three days off a week, but I don’t take them.” He holds his finger to his lips. “Don’t tell the boss. He doesn’t know. I like my job. I want to make sure the prince is safe.”
“The rest?”
“Something about information, sharing, and you mentioned me – a lot. I didn’t expect you to crush on me so soon, Captain.” Tony doesn’t look up as he works, threading the wires into the shallow cylinder he’s holding.
Howard Stark never stopped studying the virus. It swept the Earth in a year and changed everything, but it soon died out and was no longer contagious, but Howard did find it infected the germline. While the virus dissipated in the environment, it became part of his DNA and part of his germline DNA. He passed it on to his progeny.
The man whose robust and dark haired with fair skin that looks ruddy underneath, pulsing and livid leans forward and offers his hand. “Commander Rogers, Tiberius Stone. I believe you may have met my father.”
Another pause and then Steve wrestles with the blanket Tony covered him with as if he’s fighting for purchase.
“Something wrong?” Rhodey asks as both he and Carol take their seats across from Steve.
Steve’s not going to disappoint Tony, not break him apart and break him down. Even though, his consciousness is shattering – he straightens and ignores the agony. “Together.”
Tentatively, Tony places his fingers on Steve’s face. He closes one hand to let the heat radiating off Steve’s cheek warm him. The height of his cheek muscles, the crinkle of his eyes, he gently explores – Steve’s beaming, happy. Tony did that. Tony. He smiles back.
“Where are they?” Steve said as he nodded. He got to his feet and thought the room might do a loop but it stayed surprisingly still.
Tony caressed his cheek, looked at the sketches pinned to the walls. The beautiful self-made art and knew there was so much more. He wanted it all.
“He was fucking raping you,” Tony says and every part of him vibrates; he feels like he’s shaking apart. It takes all the guts and brains he has to keep his eyes on the road.  But the words execution orders echo in his head.
Without looking at Tony, Steve tugs his horse toward the range. The trees are empty sentinels and Steve still hates the idea of traveling this late in the season. But if his luck holds out and they can cross the river without incident, then he can get them to Schmidt’s ranch.  Schmidt will be fit to be tied when he sees that Tony brought Steve along – but there will be nothing for it. He’ll allow Steve on his ranch, if only to share bedding down in the cowpunchers’ house while Tony is entertained at the main house. Tony sidles his horse up to Steve’s a brilliant smirk on his face
Boarding his private jet later that night, Pepper nuzzled up to Tony. After a quiet dinner and wine, they ended up in the bedroom in the back of the jet. He fucked her with new enthusiasm as if he was a man who’d seen his death and it stalked him. To his needy lovemaking, she gave back exactly what he needed as she always did. When he thought he would go crazy with the need to finally finish but something deeply seeded inside of him prevented it – Pepper knew what to do. She whispered in his ear and then slipped a lubed finger up his ass and he exploded into her like a teenaged boy fucking for the first time.
Steve manages to get all the sketches and gathers them together to place back in the cheap leather portfolio. “It’s just a study. Nothing more.”
“You like it?” Tony steps into Steve’s personal space. He can practically feel the racing of his heart.
“On it.”
“No, no it’s not payback. This is god damned saving your life,” Tony hisses and then rubs a hand over his mouth. “You fucked up. You know that right. You nearly took your life. You know what they do to people who are suicidal, right?”
“Okay. Why don’t you prep while I go and get you some clothes?”
“That’s-.”
“Yes but engaged.”
Steve bats Tony away. “I don’t know what’s got into you, but you need to clean up. Your schedule has you at a meet of the Lacrosse teams in the Gravity bowl in less than an hour.”
"Well, see," the boy says as he whips out a kerchief. Handing it to Steve to wipe the blood away and then curling his arm around his shoulder as they walk from the alley, he adds, "See this is your lucky day. You've just met James Buchanan Barnes.”
CHAPTER 7
“Mutilation is a strong word.” Ross tilted his head and sucked in his lips as he gazed down at Steve. An obvious power play for him to stay standing.
Tony wanted to remain inconspicuous, but still when he did show up Steve smiled at him. He tried to pretend it was only for him, but in the back of his mind he knew that he was fooling himself. Steve was nice to everyone. Tony tested it, he touched Steve’s hand when he was served, and Steve didn’t shake him off. When Steve sat next to him, Tony made sure to edge his leg next to Steve’s. Steve hadn’t moved away, but instead a blush on his cheeks appeared that reminded Tony of being sun kissed.
“Mer Stane simply said it is about the Rebirth Project. He said he will take it in hand if you do not show.”
“My father cares not for Loki, but my mother would be heartbroken if something were to happen to him out here in your American Wilds.” Thor’s shoulders slump which is a feat in and of itself.
“Thank you,” Everhart replies and the sincerity of her words is clear and surprising.
“Yes, Captain.”
“What’s weird about it?” Bruce asks. He strolls around the laboratory with his hands in his pockets and a kind of lost look on his face that shouldn’t be there anymore, especially since it’s been over a year since the Battle of New York. Bruce has kept himself busy in New York while Tony splits his time between California and New York. When Tony shows up, Bruce emerges from his self-imposed exile in the Tower and actually lives and breathes like a human. It makes Tony both self important and guilty. Being Bruce’s friend isn’t the easiest thing that Tony ever tried to do – it’s not the hardest, not by far, but hell, if it is straightforward.
“Yeah, it does.” Tony paused and made a few ‘hm’ noises. “You know, I think you got something there. We’re not getting our energy from the stars – they’re too far away. Son of a bitch.” Tony sat up. “You’re right. The sun is too close and that’s why it’s too much for our bodies to handle all of that energy. It’s not the same for vampires, but shit for the Divini – we just might need -.”
“You think he would want you? You’re death. All he’s ever wanted all his life was to escape death.” Bucky licks his lips. “And now what do you have left but being so righteous people despise you. He despises you.”
Steve tried to force the issue but when they quizzed him about whether or not he could guarantee that he was seizure free, Steve couldn’t promise anything. While he doesn’t bring them on anymore – or at least he hasn’t since Tony told him that it was dangerous and his brain was actually taking a beating with each event, Steve doesn’t know if they will come on spontaneously like they did in the diner. He doesn’t want another incident, not one that can be plastered all over the internet. So he agreed to stay where they could monitor him while the doctors took tests and checked his vitals. It leaves him completely bored and anxious at the same time. It makes for very frustrated days.
Tony scoffed. “You can’t promise that, Cap.”
!” He grunted a little. “I know, but I don’t know how to do it. Gah, I sound like an idiot.”
“Don’t think like that,” Steve said and crossed the room. “I’m not leaving you. I know it took me a long time to figure things out, but I’m not leaving. I’m right here, right now. Even when I am acting more like Captain America.”
The lion places him near the trunk of a tree and then sidles up next to him. Before Tony can clamber away, Blu plops a huge arm over him and tucks him by his side. Then slowly and meticulously starts to lick him – all over.
“I get emotional? Or I can’t really hold back my emotions as well?” Steve says as he joins Tony. Immediately, he eats.
“Tell me you didn’t have fun?” Steve laughs as he tugs off his helmet. His hair is in disarray and there’s sweat along his brow. He yanks off his jacket, and Tony sees the sweat running down his back as he places it on the bike’s seat.
Reassured, Tony tastes Steve’s nipples. They’re pert and rosy but also with every slight touch he brings a shiver of joy and anticipation to Steve. Tony’s own body responds and his erection strains against his undershorts. He loves a responsive partner in bed; Steve is just that and even more so. Yet, this is far beyond what Tony ever hoped for – this is about permanence and love. This flesh beneath him, the way it trembles, and goosebumps appear will be his, and his alone for the rest of his life. This revelation startles and humbles him at the same time. His self-admission should terrify him, but it doesn’t. This is where he belongs, with Steve.
He immediately thinks of Tony – he can’t help it. His life, though lonely, always centers on Tony. He denies revealing it to Ultron’s portrayal of Bucky.
“I used to run the servants’ entrances all the time as a kid. I grew up here.” They race down the back stairs. “To the left and then we’ll take the service elevator down to the underground parking.”
With a glance toward Hill and then one to the triage bay where he had last seen Steve, Tony went with Bruce. Waves radiated off of Bruce oscillating between calm and rage. Tony tried to wall them off, tried to get a grip on where his feelings ended and Bruce’s began.  Bruce led them to the  hospital café and they order coffee (burnt) and muffins (stale).  Bruce didn’t seem to mind the culinary state of the food or drink. He gobbled it up without pause. Tony only sipped his coffee.
“I don’t understand why Ms. Potts requested that I come. She’s the one who had me fired in the first place.”
Maybe the bonds between family were strong. Maybe that was why he didn’t need the flesh contact. He didn’t know. Maybe it was the blood that spilt between them that sealed the pack, but the bond snapped into place harder and sharper than any before it. He wrestled up enough strength to open his eyes, to raise his hand in supplication. “Bucky.” He called to no avail, because his friend, his brother, only turned his head once to peer over his shoulder and then left. He abandoned Steve even as the soul bond wove between them. The pain spiked through Steve, his injuries eating away at him, but nothing could compare to the disgust and fear he felt through the bond. His mind tried to latch onto it, to parse it and understand it, but the strength to do so failed him.
Steve seems to perk up when Tony admits defeat as far as leaving at this moment. He smiles and says, “Well, we have all the supplies we need. It should be fine. We’ll have a quiet weekend. Obviously, you need a lot of sleep considering how sleep deprived you are.”
“Well, I have had to split my time between here and Malibu. It hasn’t been easy with you on the mend.”
Bucky walked around the room as if he recognized it, slumping into a tattered sofa that probably doubled as a bed if the blankets and pillows piled on the one cushion were any indication. He waited for Tony as if there was something they were supposed to be doing here. Tony stayed put near the window.
“We know of Agent Carter,” Wong replied. He folded his hands in front of him and reminded Steve of one of the nuns from his primary school days.
“Then we take him down before he can. We got to get you out of here. There’s too much risk but we have to do it.” Tony mutters a few calculations to himself and then says, “We do this together. Right? Together.”
“I get that lots of what happened to the Captain shouldn’t have. I argued against it. I was shut out. I only found out what they did to him a little before you happened -.” The way he’d used the word happened chilled Tony. He knew then it was a set up. Somehow. “To run into him. Pierce and his yes men wanted the Captain for more than I can tell you and probably more than you want to know. Thankfully, the Captain did escape.” For a quick minute, Fury had glanced at Nat and she only tightened her mouth and said nothing.
Tony notices the smudge of gold on Steve’s cheek during battle. After, he grasps Steve’s shoulder and then wipes his hand over the stain. It doesn’t come away, though Tony sees glitter in the air around them. He sees a welling of tears in Steve’s eyes, yet keeps his questions to himself. Days later, he catches a glimpse of Steve in light. It’s like an aura around him. No one else makes mention of it. Tony thinks he might be crazy. When the scars appear on Steve’s perfect face, he realizes his error.  Scars only mean one thing. Imprint.
Bruce only scratches at his temple and shrugs.
Placing the chair back in the stack, Steve went to the semi-circle and sat down. Cross legged was something that he couldn’t achieve but he did his best. He wondered if they were going to meditate. He’d spent some time reading up on meditation techniques so he would understand what Bruce was doing to quiet the Hulk. As far as he knew from Bruce, it worked wonders.
“Don’t worry. Everything’s okay. We got Clint out of the wreck. He’s stable but not awake. Bruce is with him right now. No casualties which is a fucking miracle.” Iron Man disengaged the helmet to reveal his face. Tony looked genuinely worried about him. “Are you okay? You were out of it by the time we got here.”
“It’s rough. I am basing a lot of this on assumptions. It needs a lot of refinement like I said. Not much in the literature quantifying soul mates or packs. I really did have to start from scratch in some ways. But I’ll get it there. It will help once I can clean it up.” He needed to know a lot more about the pack, understand the character traits, and be able to quantify them better. Maybe Bruce could help.
“Can you tell me who that was? Was she part of your troop?” Tony asks, but as soon as the words are out of his mouth, he knows she isn’t a soldier. She’s something far different from a soldier.
“But you could make your lives a living hell.”
“How many other truths,” Tony whispers and slugs back the bourbon.
Steve still didn’t look at him as he bowed his head. “Nothing. Everything. I don’t want to be something wrong. I was wrong for so long.”
When he wakes in his bed at his estate, Tony pants through the last of a nightmare. He runs a hand through his sweaty hair and tries not to shiver. What the hell was that, anyhow? Large invasion forces arriving in huge ships to deliver a Titan to threaten them all. He’s been reading too many fantasies lately. He groans as he blinks away the last vestiges of the memory of the dream. Except it didn’t feel like a dream at all. He flails in the overlarge bed, realizing for the first time he’s not in his own bed. He’s in his main presentation suite in his mansion on the Stark Family estate of the Council World. He fans out his arms and notes there’s no one in bed with him and then he peers down onto the floor to see his omega exactly where he left him last night.
Steve closes his eyes and a single tear escapes. “Tony.”
“One day?” Tony hisses. He puts his glass down. “I don’t know how you do it.”
“No,” Bucky said and shook his head. His arm transformed to the metal one – the one that packed enough of a punch to level Captain America. “No! My best friend isn’t a god damned fairy and I will fucking kill him for doing this to you!”
He comforts him and looks to see Sam with Redwing and Clint to the side, silently watching over them, sentinels against the darkness.
“The Purge revolt – that was a minor riot.”
“Ha!” Tony barked at Steve. “So you do think gay people are perverts. You are a homophobic dick. And what the fuck do you think of your Beloved being a guy? Because I’m all guy, Stevie-boy. And I am fully loaded.” He grabbed at his crotch. Steve staggered away, getting out of Tony’s personal space. Even if it was crude, it was worth the absolute horror and revulsion on Rogers’ face.
“Yes?” He plucks out one earbud.
“I know,” Steve said, and a pang of guilt hit him. What Tony had been through – was there a barometer that said which was worse? Crucifixion or rape. Or was it the same thing? The violation of their bodies and their minds in every way possible.
Words failed to comfort. Steve turned to their astral projections, worked through their soul bond to offer strength and support to Tony as he wept in his arms. The memories shared through the bond, while horrifying, were something that Steve could make sense of – he could offer solace and also logical explanations. The vision given to Tony by the Maximoff twin – that was ground that Steve never tread upon in his life. Sure, he was part of a metaphysical soul pack, but that didn’t lend itself to a deeper understanding of these visions. If they were visions. Were they just something simple – like a nightmare fantasy? Or was Steve dealing with some prediction of the future?
“You fix.” He jostles Tony again.
Everyone leaves but the doctor, he lingers at the stairwell. “If you don’t mind, I’d like to go check on him again.”
“Yeah, oh,” Steve responded and the hurt he felt in the house behind him faded and a new light, a new idea began to flicker within him, around him. It perplexed him until he realized it was their souls entangled and woven together. Steve released his fear, and the bond between them flourished like a vine reaching toward the sunlight. Tony must have read the same thing, must have experienced Steve embracing the idea through their souls because he gathered Steve to him and didn’t wait for an invitation to kiss him. Steve drank the kiss in, tasted it with a new fevered hunger. Through the kiss he communicated his acceptance and his own offering. It wasn’t frustration or exhaustion with his old indoctrination, but his actions entrenched in the feelings overwhelming him and flowing through the bond. He could no more deny Tony, than he could stop breathing.
“Simple,” Steve said. He didn’t offer his hand right away. “It might not work, and that means nothing about who you are. It’s just means our astral projections-.”
“I know,” Steve said and recalled the moments he struggled to cut off the bonds, to isolate himself. His actions, he’d told himself, were altruistic. He hated the idea of any of his pack being subjected to the pain, the loss, the trauma of separation from everything he loved. He knew how that was, had experienced the bitter taste of isolation.
“What do you want to do, Steve?” Tony asked. “Do you want to fight the good fight alone or do you want this pack? Because I think we come as a package deal.”
“Going in,” Natasha says and a jolt of pain like lightning, like hotl liquid  metal, rides up his shoulder and down his arm to his fingertips at the same time.
He grips the reins tighter in his hands, urging his mount forward. The poor beast spits and hisses at him; it knows the dangers of the Forsaken Pass. Taking the ravine is fool’s play – the Silver Knight knows this – but with his escape route cut off his choices are few.
“You’re my mission.” The words sliced into Steve, not because of how it felt to be set adrift from his life and family, but because of what it meant about Bucky. Bucky was truly lost, gone, forever the hand of Hydra.
Tell him what?
Tony nodded but the melancholy wouldn’t fade from his eyes. “So we define it our way. Just don’t – I can’t handle it if you decide I’m disgusting because I want to be with another guy. I can’t handle prejudice against my sexuality.”
“Would you like a primer as you dress?”
The world around them fills the space. The gulls, the sea, the breeze sing together. The winds hit him and it’s chilled. Tony smells the saltwater and thinks maybe in the distance some seals might be around, he can smell their fishy hides. “You’re not going to lose me, Steve. No one is.”
“Then I see you again – now,” Logan hisses. “I thought you were dead and you turn up alive in New York. Shit, I didn’t think we would ever be together again. But damn, here we are.” He sits back and lets his head fall back so that he’s staring at the ceiling. “I had you for a while. I’m not going to lie to you.” Now he straightens and looks directly at Steve. “I love you. I would move the fucking world for you. I would stab Stark in the heart if I knew you would love me back. But I know – you would leave me anyhow. I’m escaping who I am – you – you’re always becoming who you are. You’re always building it, you embrace it. God, kid. I need you more than air.” He covers his face and for a long moment, Steve thinks he might be crying – slight tears. When he drops his hands, his eyes are dry but red. “You do this thing. Save yourself. Where ever you end up, you’re strong enough to build yourself up again.”
“What the hell are you doing?” Tony asks as Steve lays out the money on the table.
Tony sucked down the last of his come and then sat up. Gooseflesh marred Steve’s skin and he shivered against the cold. Tony gathered him into his arms and then caught the edge of the blanket at the foot of the bed and covered them. “Shush.”
“Steven. You must meet my mother Frigga and my father, Odin. All the way from Norway. They came in to see our set up. Decided to finance a whole line, after all. We have enough to work with you on your comic now. You can do this full time. With us!”  Thor’s joy overwhelms Steve. The idea of focusing on his comic, the one he wrote and drew tempts him. This is the break he’s been waiting for during his entire artistic career.
It slams into Tony’s chest, reverberates and saturates his senses. The air from his lungs escapes in tiny pants, and his heart races too fast against his ribs. He can smell Blu’s breath, feel the spittle of the lion on his face. Tony collapses to the ground and Blu finally stops.
He goes back to searching the room. Only the barest of essentials here with the bed, the table next to the bed with a drawer with several toys – nothing too elaborate. There’s also salve for after bonding. He picks up the tube and shakes his head. It’s expired. What else is new?
Tony leans over the candle lit table as the lights lend more shadow to the room than illuminate it. In a low timbre, Tony says, "But you are, aren't you Captain?"
“Yes. It wasn’t easy. I finished up college and did all of my grad courses at home. Luckily, we were able to convince MIT that I was still recovering from my injuries – which I was at the time. I ended up having a lab at Stark Industries and did my doctorate work there. I was only on campus for committee meetings.” Tony explains and then waits. He can imagine Steve staring at him, gaped mouth, furrowed brows.
“How can you tell?” Tony smirks and tastes the stew. It’s divine. “Do you miss her? Your mom, I mean?”
When he shows up at Asgardian Comics with his final proofs of the pages, Steve’s glad to get away from Tony for the day. Though he admits to himself as he walks through the door to the comic book publisher, his nerves want to pop out of his skin with anticipation of seeing Tony again. He’s got to get it under control.
“You’re shaking.”
It’s only a few more yards. He can make it. The winds pick up as if to deny them their victory. The rope whips against the cliff, twisting and smashing. He hears Tony curse as he hits the razor-sharp rocks. Steve stretches out with one hand and manages to grab the cliff side. He steadies them. Even in the gloves his fingers are numb while his face burns with the cold.
“Feeling better?”
One last look at Steve who just might be his future, Tony climbs to his feet and follows Bruce. Out in the hall near the nurse’s station, Tony stops and shoves his hands in his back pockets. “Yeah?” It seems foolish now, all that shit he grilled Bruce about earlier. How weird Steve acted, how he would gaze at Tony without saying anything. All that time, Steve had needed his help, probably knew something was physically wrong with him but hadn’t reached out.
Tony had the good sense to stay quiet.
Huddled close to Tony are other security guards. Most of them are engaged in keeping the paparazzi at bay and only allow a small number of people close to Tony. Steve surmises it makes things easier this way for Tony to continue his charade. Right now, only Pepper is next to Tony as they stand only three steps to the stage. The lights briefly dim in the room, signifying people should be taking their places at the tables. Appetizers and cocktails are over.
“It means something to you to kiss, doesn’t it?”
“Did you think it might be because you don’t show anything or anyone else to them?” Tony sat up. He didn’t take his focus off Steve. “In this dream space I think I’ve gotten to know you better than I ever have in the real world.” Tony winked at him as he glanced over Steve’s body. “Well in more ways than one, but I am trying to make a point here.”
“Sorry, sorry,” Tony says and stands next to the foot of the bed. “That was a low blow.” He shakes his head. “But Steve, you gotta realize, this looks bad. It is bad.”
Luke pats Steve on the back. “I think we understand one another. So, I’m gonna call you Tones. Does that work for you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve puts his finger on Tony’s lips. “That’s not necessary, Tony. I’m fine. I can take care of myself.”
Steve doubts that entirely, but he doesn’t argue. They separate but walk close to one another as they enter Prime Station. Tony eyes the crowds and Steve spots Happy not far off, he’s leading the way to the park. Steve suspects that only thoroughly vetted people will be allowed in the park with the prince. That seems a little overkill especially since Tony’s been roaming the station for nearly a week now. Steve wonders if that means some of the meetings, he hasn’t been privy to have been going off the rails.
“Ten dollar word there, Buck.”
“No, not that we know of,” Natasha said and side eyed Fury. He only grumbled at her.
“There’s no reason to pout about it. I still have the will to live, I’m not like some gazelle that just gives up, you know. And any way lionesses are the ones who hunt, you just lay around and look regal,” Tony says. He’s testing his luck, talking to a lion, but then again, the animal has no idea what the hell Tony’s is saying. “Whatever, you don’t know what the hell I’m saying.”
Without turning to look at Tony, Steve says, “You won’t like it in the morning. You’re anxious and stressed from everything that’s happened.”
“They need to operate.” He doesn’t elaborate. How is he going to explain this to anyone? And is it his story to tell? It isn’t. He knows that much. It’s Steve’s story. One he desperately needs to hear.
Steve looks down at his meal and the cold pit of the war swallows him up and the food reminds him paradoxically of walking skeletons and death. He places his silver fork to the side and his hands in his lap. "Yes, I know that."
“Well, I’m sorry but I don’t think I’m welcome and I already packed all of my clothes.” He’s sure he doesn’t have the correct wardrobe for the party anyhow.
“How the hell old is Ross?” Tony had asked but then he turned back to the point of the conversation. “So it wasn’t just the disease?”
“I’m not due for my screening for another week.”
“I made sure they were all hypo-allergic.” Tony waves his hand over the selection, and even though he tries Steve sees a slight tremor in his fingers. “You pick what you want. I want to take care of you, make this right.” He rubs at the bridge of his nose. “I’m so sorry Steve, I never realize-.”
“And Captain Rogers encountered it when he was in battle with the Red Skull?”
“I didn’t. I figured it might be a good thing to test out here before I actually made it in the real world. It was just for shits and giggles. Now it’s for real,” Tony says.
“Yes. I’m on assignment to Prince Anthony?” Steve stays stock still.
The phone rings and it takes a few rings before Jarvis answers. Tony forgot how late it is. After Jarvis greets him, Tony apologizes, “Sorry Jarvis, I forgot what time it is.”
“Sh-shouldn’t be here,” Steve murmurs but climbs to his feet. His eyes are heavily lidded, and his legs wobble. The wounds littering his body bleed. He shudders as if he’s cold.
“No,” Natasha said, but her stare was icy cold. Either she didn’t like that he submitted to the tests or she hated the idea that it hurt him – or Bruce. Whichever, it ended up with both Natasha and Fury pissed at him. “You shouldn’t let people hurt you to prove a point. Believe me, that never ends well.” She rolled her eyes and headed toward the door.
“A bond not a pack. That’s what I recall,” Natasha said with a small lift of her shoulder. “It’s weird because now I know it was a change in the timeline, a change in our reality because of Strange. It might never have been, but it is now – to me.”
“No,” Tony answered back the same word that Steve had used. “No. You are alive, and you are well. The universe didn’t call on Captain America, the universe called on Steve Rogers.”
When Steve looked up, Tony’s mouth was agape in astonishment. “You mean to tell me it was like an internal radar?”
What exactly did he mean by that – how could a specimen be company? Tony glanced around the yard. It reminded him of a prison yard. He spotted some workout stations and wondered if those were for the guards. Sawyer confirmed his suspicions.
“Sir, according to your own account, you put the reactor in your chest during your captivity in Afghanistan,” JARVIS replies.
Bucky swallows down the acidic horror of it. The barbed wires, the thing looks like a contorted version of a dog muzzle attached to Steve’s face, but it is so much worse. The face plate is a cage, plain and simple but underneath it - attached to Steve's face it is a torture device. Bucky needs to steady himself as he realizes the gruel in the bowl to the side would be impossible for Steve to eat since his mouth is partially blocked by a rod pressed horizontally across his lips like a Horse’s bit. His crack lips bleed and scab over. He groans making little sounds and then he paws at the air as if begging.
“We went to the roof,” Tony said. “After I killed everyone in the cell.” He looked down at his hands. “I drank from you-.” He stopped. “Crap that’s all backwards.” He rubbed at his face, smearing the blood tears away. He tried again, his whole demeanor brittle and broken. “They did that – you know – on the roof. After I was just a husk, nothing like I can describe to you. They brought this husk, this thing, this creature. God, it wasn’t even really me. It crawled over to you and drank and drank. It became – something. I became something.” He had been staring at the rising sun through the tinted windows, protected from its effects. “I killed them.” Turning he showed Steve his hands. “These aren’t just Christmas lights.” He laughed, and it cracked the air like a whip. “I killed them with these light beams from my hands and chest.”
“Yeah,” Steve agrees. “I suppose being a superhero it comes with the territory.”
“I dare you.” Steve waits with a raised eyebrow, knowing full well Tony is not going to back down.
"Captain, your service in the war is the stuff of legend, I should call you sir, not the other way around," Coulson says.
“Tony, Mister Stark was my father,” Tony says and catches the towel hanging on the hook near the door. He tosses it to Steve, who catches it easily. “I know where you were during those seven months the great Captain of the Union Army disappeared.”
“Nope, I know that trick, I used it enough. Have some bread,” Tony directs and tries to give Steve a stern look. He’s sure it must come off more like a scowl than anything else, but Steve ignores it and smiles.
Bucky needed relieve from the urgency in his blood. He needed that connection between an omega and an alpha. He tried. But even as he penetrated Steve again and again, he couldn’t get the relief he sought. Because he couldn’t knot. The knot is required not only for the omega but for the alpha. Without it, there is no relief.
“It does not,” Tony retorts, though he’s not 100% sure whether Pepper might have added that little sentence somewhere, stuck it in when he wasn’t looking. That’s taking advantage of a blind man.
“I didn’t have an answer for him, so I told him to call Reed Richards. I know Doctor Richards studies that kind of thing.” Bruce chews on his lower lip.
“My lord.”
Maybe he’s the father of the young girl or her grandpa or something. But that doesn’t make sense either – she’s Russian – Tony got that one for sure. He wraps up the information and tucks it away. He needs to find out more, so he continues, “Your ma, she died when you were eighteen?”
Steve waves off the offer of food. “I’ll just get some coffee.” He won’t drink it. Time is ticking and freedom slips away with every second.
“Yeah, sandwiches,” Steve said with a smile. “We would like to spend time together, just to be with one another.”
“Nope, because I’m not dead.” Tony smiles but the ache in his chest probably turns it into more of a wince if looking at Steve is any indication. “No, really, I’m good.”
“Stark isn’t going to let you do it. He’s not going to let anyone do it.” Her gaze steadies on him, powerful and penetrating. She crosses her arms, closing him off at the same time she peels him open and exposes him. “Not anyone else.”
“You can’t,” Tony said. He buried his face in Steve’s chest. “And then she gave me a vision.”
No time like the present.
“Yeah, yeah,” Steve says and waves him off.
The name exploded in Steve’s head like a bomb, but the blast had no sound. The perfection of silence enveloped him, encasing him in disbelief.
“She’s currently scanning your database, feeding your omega with all of the requested information on your family history. Including your mother’s legal fight regarding the Carbonelli inheritance and their Ownership planets.”
“Hope is my world, that’s right and it helps to have an anchor. You gotta find one Steve. You won’t survive if you don’t have something to anchor you out of the mindset. Remember sex isn’t love. It’s just sex. That’s all.” Scott sounds beaten. “I don’t want you to get broken, Cap. You’re too good for this life, you know.”
“You want to have dinner with me? Why not with Bruce?”
“It depends on the leader and the circumstances,” Strange said and left it at that. He turned to Steve. “It will be up to you. Since you have the brand of the leader, you will name each and every member.”
She huffs a little before she continues. “At some point along the way, Steve probably came out of the closet. He’s been dying to, though he’s never done it before. He came close a few times with me, but not close enough to actually tell me. A hundred year old virgin has a hard time dealing with these things.”
“Not often enough, that’s for sure,” Clint said. He closed off, his arms crossed over his chest, his shoulders hunched. “He doesn’t think he’s got a pack. We’re all his family. He’s got no one else.”
Steve tosses the gauze and tape. His ribs are a horrid color of blue and black. "Let's say I know a little more than you think I do about who you are. Let's say I know you’re smarter than my average John. Let's say that I get you're curious. Let's say all of that. But in the end it won't get you anywhere or me. Or us. If you out us, we're gone. We have to move on. I don't want to move from here. It's the best place for us to figure things out. We burned our bridges elsewhere. Please, darling, don't."
Steve frowns at the endearment. “It’s Steve.”
“I thought I needed an Omega warrior,” he laughs. She’s always been such a worrier, though if it hadn’t been for her, he’d probably be dead somewhere in the Rims or Lanes. Now the whole of their empire- their lives and fortunes – depend on him. He wouldn’t care all that much except to keep himself fed but there are worlds and systems dependent on him and the Stark family. He might be a cold hearted bastard sometimes, but he doesn’t like the idea of babies dying of hunger during his watch – even if they are lowly omegas.
A large man with a thick beard, balding head, and a paunch for a belly turns to Tony and opens his arms wide. “My boy!” He grasps Tony in a familial hug, then releases him. “I could never leave when we are on the precipice. This is going to be a historic conference on the war. I’m telling you, my prince, you are set for great things!”
He wants to ask what bridges. He wants to beg and ask what the hell is going on in modern day New York City. He doesn't. Is he a coward? A fool? Or too much in love?
“Okay,” Steve says, and Tony hears him put it into his pocket.
“When you really want to date him. Well, you’re a terrible liar, so you’re going to have to get over it and deal. Or confess to him that to you it’s a real date,” Sam says.
“All the time,” Steve said. “I just saw him last week after I came back injured from an op.”
Without further word, Steve departs.
“So that means forcing them to be mutilated?” Steve leveled his tone.
“Well, as you know Captain America died nearly seventy years ago and all, but some of us, some of us wish he didn’t. Or at least think, he shouldn’t have died.”
“Tony?” Steve’s tone edges, heavy and husky.
Tony wanted to say love, but embarrassment at his corniness won over and he shrugged. “Don’t know. Maybe because we’re relaxed.”
All he can think of is his first time with Tony. How professional and distant Tony was that time. How it felt more like a contract than a first date. Or anything like that. He loved Tony. He still does. But sometimes love isn’t met to mean happily ever after. He’s learned that now.
“Are you okay, Tony?”
Beloved – he recalled the words whispered on blood stained lips.
Steve nods, his eyes pained and the gash on his head bleeds freely. “He wants you to know that he’s going to kill me slowly when you fail.”
In the byways beyond the oceans, beyond the atmosphere of the world, Steve hears – faint and light – the hiss and thunder of his sins. He has fallen so far already – what good would it do to try and save himself physically if he’s already emotionally tied to this man before him. “I do. I mean it.”
Coulson smiles, encouraged that Steve has taken more of an interest in his story. "Let's get you out of here, and over to SHIELD."
“I need to bond with him. That will subdue him. That’s all you need to know,” Tony says and gulps back his own arousal. He hasn’t knotted since his last Urgency. He usually uses suppressants these days, but those aren’t really medically endorsed. He took his last dose over a month ago because he knew that he would end up needing an omega due to the Council meeting.
He wishes he had water or something to drink. The electrical shock left him parched and shaken. No pack, no water. He hopes Tony still has his pack, but who knows what happened. Maybe Ultron wants to watch his rat in a maze with no reward at the end. That rankles him and he ends up turned around and angry with himself that he ended up lost in thought. He needs to pay attention in order to map out the twists and turns of the maze which so far consists of dull gray rock walls with a stony path. Water puddles on the path making the idea of touching the wall even less appealing.
“And it just keeps coming,” Clint muttered.
“Shit.”
Frigga studies them, her hands folded in front of her while the metal breast plate she wears gleams in the morning light of the Soul Realm.  She regards them like the queen she’s always been. “You think you can do this? You can find one another?”
“What is?”
“Come on!” Tony tugs at his wrist and Steve allows it, he moves toward the light.
Jarvis intervenes. “If you will, sir, there’s something else.”
She smiles and her eyes twinkle and everything is right and perfect with the world. He leaves her tucked into her bed and closes the door. Steve stands there, arms folded.
That hit hard and Steve glances away trying to ease his anger.
“I might, in a way, but not in the way you think. I still think that some modified type of Accords is needed, but I do think the approach was all wrong,” Natasha says and then she scans him. “You need to go. I could help you.”
“Christ, Steve, I was terrified until you called.” Tony grasped his hand.
“If you’ll excuse me, I need to get back to the prince.” Steve pulls his arm but fails to dislodge Rumlow. “I need to go.”
“You know we can do this,” Steve says and a pain shoots through his chest. They both have to believe in order for this to work. “Do you trust me?” Tony had said that once upon a time.
Steven tilts his head and narrows his eyes as if he’s staring into a microscope and can see the finest details of Tony’s thoughts. “Maybe.”
“Let’s settle down,” Steve said and spread out his arms to keep everyone at bay. “You know that Bucky is not responsible. You’ve said it yourself.”
“Cold.” He notices the bruises Tony once harbored are completely gone.
“Yeah, I talked to him a few times when they were in Japan. I seem to remember they were together, and Steve seemed concerned about you when you broke up with Pepper. I think he even knew Logan from the war, if you can believe it.” He shrugs. “But then again.” Bruce stops and runs a hand through his already messy hair. “I don’t – he was asking weird questions.”
Back at the Tower, Tony admitted to himself he had hope though, too. Maybe too much hope. Maybe he needed to dial it back. In London, Steve wanted to go all the way, then he boomeranged back to fearing everything about a same sex relationship. Now Steve had settled somewhere in the middle, which was probably for the best. Jumping in with both feet had its benefits but Tony wasn’t sure he could withstand Steve’s resentment, if that grew from too much too soon. Tony needed to work out his own feelings anyhow.
“Snarky,” Steve mumbles and leaves his cabin. It’s only a short walk to the prince’s quarters but he finds his palms sweaty by the time he knocks on the door. JARVIS allows him entry. When he joins Tony, the prince’s demeanor is calm and quiet – all the joy gone.
Tony nods. He wipes away his tears and Steve places something in his hand. He touches it and then figures it out. “A handkerchief? You carry a hanky?” A smile curls his lips that he can’t suppress.
“Just because I am the leader of the pack doesn’t make me more important than anyone else, Sam.” Steve rejected the idea of a hierarchy in the pack. They were equals. The team – well the Avengers needed a leader, but the pack they operated on a level playing field.
Bucky runs to the prison cell and notices a weak blue light emanating from the narrow barred window. He scans the area and sees no surveillance equipment, no guards. Something’s up, something’s strange, but it doesn’t stop him. No guards, no force fields. He edges closer to the cell and jumps up, grasping the bars in his hands. He hauls himself up so he can peer into the cell.
Morgan crawls off Steve’s lap and opens her arms wide for Tony. He steps into the room and lifts her off the bed. He nuzzles her and tickles her as Steve slips off the bed.
“I figure we can go across the hall. You know about them,” Steve says. “As long as we don’t disturb anyone we should be okay.”
“Miss Darcy, you say?” Tony swings a leg over his horse and drops down. It surprises Steve how fluid his movements are. He does steady himself against the flank of the horse once he's on solid ground, but Steve thinks it might be due to his heart weakness, and it concerns him.
“Don’t do that,” Tony yells but his voice is lost as the fight escalates and the sounds of gunshots and screeching overpower him. He looks back at the screen, waiting for the computer to confirm that the power up is complete. “Come on, come on. God damned slow piece of shit.”
Tony stays stunned and frozen on the ground by the tree as Blu turns away and leaps up onto the rocky outcropping of the hill. He stops, faces Tony, and roars once again as if to make his point, then he’s gone. Tony sits there, shivers and curls his arms around himself. The momentary thoughts of serenity and peace dissipate. He wants to go back to normalcy. He wants nothing of this place anymore where he can’t have a nice bed and all the luxuries around him. He wants to leave the stink of a wild animal behind him.
“Honestly, I don’t know,” Steve said. “You’ve been around a lot longer than I have. I’m assuming that this soul bond stuff is something known.”
That was when Sam spoke up and teased the bonds, not annoyingly, not to hurt but to build and recover. He wove words to bring Steve around, asking questions, but not judging, helping Steve see the light. And when Hill appeared and asked who’s this guy – referring to Sam, Steve said it all, “Soul pack. Companion.”
Steve nods into Tony’s hand and then they kiss again. It’s becoming a necking session and part of Tony wants to float away on. It feels so good to just be in someone’s arms that he trusts and doesn’t have to be anyone else for; it’s liberating.
“I kind of have to, don’t I?” Steve tried his best to sound casual, as if none of any of this affected him as deeply and as messily as it did. Sam read right through it. The soul bond between them jittered and Steve knew it blared like a trumpet that he was covering. Sam, though, gentleman that he was, nodded.
Tony crossed the small space to the bed and sat down, his back to Steve. “I get that. I understand that. But-.” He cringed and closed his eyes. “I can’t lose you when you do this. I can’t.”
He curls on the bed as much as he can because probing at the edge of the Boundaries leaves him frigid and iced. His finger tips and toes are blue and he shudders as he calls again, “Natasha? Are you there? Are you okay? Are you even alive?”
“I promise, I’m your anchor.”
“Clyn has been your omega for how long?” Tony had asked on the second day of the Council.
Finally, courage swells through Tony and he slips one hand up to cup the back of Steve’s head and angle him more comfortable. He prods a little and suddenly, Steve opens his mouth and there’s a little moan, so quiet, so hushed that Tony barely registers it. It’s enough to urge him on, to buoy his hopes and he tastes and explores with more enthusiasm and less fear. Steve isn’t an active participate – Tony wouldn’t classify it that way at all. More of an interested bystander in his own life, but then he jolts in Tony’s arms and pulls away. He looks down and rubs at his mouth as if to clean away the foulness of the kiss.
“Sorry about that Cap. It’s the way it is. It’s nothing personal, like I said before,” Rumlow said and slowly twisted the knife. “You think I should slice you sideways and open you up like a frog on a dissecting table. I could pull out your intestines, let them hang out there. Supposed to be an awful way to die.” He chuckled. “Did you see that during the war? Kids, boys, laying out with their hands over their guts crying for their mommas. Will you cry for your momma?” He shoved the knife in farther and Steve felt it tear through the skin on his back.
“Okay, let me try again. There are worlds, dimensions might be a better word, where there are the protectors and the protected. Humans are protected because they have the potential to be more – to be immortal to transcend to our Realm, through the Boundaries.” Steve moves and his wings shuffle. It hurts but he ignores the stretch of pain. “We protect you, guide you, guard you.”
"I still don't know who you are."
“South it is, sir.”
“There you go. Now you got it,” Tony says, and his voice sounds a little drunk and sweet.
“Yeah?” Steve’s words are slightly slurred as if he’s drunk.
JARVIS continues a monologue of the game with few interrupts by Steve as he opens his closet and finds not one but three uniforms. Two of the uniforms are red and one is blue with a silver star. He’s not sure why one is a different color, so he leaves it alone and stays with the red and gold. He strips out of his clothes, thinks about the lingerie that Tony bought today but realizes that it’s still back in the prince’s quarters. Searching through his stock of undergarments, Steve settles on panties that barely hold his cock and a thin silky a-shirt. It will have to do. He slips on the uniform and considers shoving the boots aside when JARVIS comments, “Mer Rogers you will need to boots. They are used in situations where there are unstable gravity fields.”
“I think I’m going to regret this,” Steve mutters and Tony only winks at him.
Tony shrinks back, his horse follows by shuffling away a few steps from Shield.  “I know your friend is important to you,” Tony says after a time.
“Yes.” He stops short of telling her anything else. “If you could just place the beer on the floor.”
“I’m in the car now, it will take me over an hour to get there,” Tony says. “But I’ll go.”
“No, nothing like that. He’s a little upset, though, and I think that’s gotten him into this binge of work that I can’t seem to stop.” Steve sits down on the bed.
In the back of his perceptions, he hears a creak like the door’s closing and then the click of the lock being drawn in place. He stumbles to a stop, and Tony searches his face, shakes his head, his lips are bruised and swollen. “No, you don’t.” Tony warns him and drags him closer again.
They are lying in bed, spent and happy against the morning light. Tony has never known someone as strong and as forward in what he wants in bed as Steve. When Tony woke up this morning, Steve had been sitting watching him. He scooped him up and planted him on his lap, together they found their way to fruition. After then, Steve took Tony slower, preparing him, scissoring his fingers and then dragging them in and out until Tony nearly cried with need. Tears had prickled his eyes as he begged for release. Steve gave him more but made him wait. When he’d come a second time that morning it fragmented every part of his soul into shards that glittered in the morning light. Steve kissed him back to reality.
“It is badly injured. I still do not know if it will heal correctly.”
“Yes sir,” JARVIS says, and maybe Tony only imagines the softness in his voice.
Natasha placed a hand on his forearm. “I get it. It’s hard. He needs time.”
Rhodey glowers, tightens his jaw, and then nods. “That’s correct.”
He scrubs away the fatigue or tries. When he was in the army, he spent many hours on watch sleep deprived. He’s gotten soft in the area of sleep. Of course, the idea of sleeping with Tony hasn’t crossed his mind – or at least he’s denied the idea. Just holding Tony yesterday after he nearly slipped off the dock sent a thrill through him that still causes a coil deep in his groin and he has to turn the water to cold to stop from fantasizing about his boss.
“Is it safe?” Steve asks.
Wong exhausts his explanations of the Pym particles along with the virotherapy when Tony chimes in to comment, “The particles aren’t smart enough, are they?”
“Truly, he was the top of his class,” Tony says.
“No one in here has a good heart ma’am. We’re all trying to survive a nasty assignment. Don’t blame it on the men, we’re loyal to the cause.”
A sound of lust escapes Steve’s lips that signifies absolute pure, unadulterated desire. He wants this vow between them, he needs it as much as Tony does. It locks them together. A simple tap on the table in some future meeting and Tony knows, knows in the spaces within his heart that Steve will immediately go here to this moment and they will live in a secret world – where they’ve built this relationship over the last few days in a cabin in the woods. Their fever for one another – their yearning had been low, almost denied until these last days. And now – now they have this pact between them.
“Doesn’t matter right now. I have to pack up and get moving.” He goes to the water’s edge, careful of snakes. He washes the water over his face and in his hair but leaves it at that. No sense risking his life to have a bath. He finishes and heads back to the camp but notices that Steve’s sits staring at nothing but the middle distance. He trudges back and knocks him in the shoulder. The wall that formed between them is surprisingly thick and well formed in such a short time. They are strangers, really. “Come on. You want to get back to civilization, don’t you?”
All the guards and Happy depart; the doors whisper closed. Tony, sitting on the bench in front of the piano, stretches out his hand and Steve goes to him – the beckoning call silent in the quietude. The stars outside are distant and lovely, but nothing compares to Tony’s eyes, the universe is there within him. Tony grasps his waist and jostles him to the keyboard. Discordant notes sound as he’s pushed up against it. The amber liquid on the side of the piano shimmers in the dim light.
"Yeah, I learned in the war," Steve says and, for some reason, Tony doesn't think he's actually speaking about any recent war.
“And what’s the deal here, Ultron,” Tony asks because Steve’s too tongue tied to even try to advance a cognizant thought. “We’re no longer trying to keep things realistic.”
Tony tried to fathom what he wanted from Steve. Sure a soul bond as part of the Avengers team would have been nice, but did he want it for the prestige? It couldn’t be - because Steve and SHIELD didn’t advertise it at all. So what role did he hope to have defined by Steve? Sentinel? Warrior? Friend? Lover?
“No, no I did not.” Steve nodded. “But I also need to find my way in this new world. SHIELD might not be the way, but I want to serve my country. The Army isn’t the way to go for me. Not anymore.”
Something wrong about Clint unbalances Steve. The archer steps into the moonlight, except he’s not an archer anymore. There are swords crossed on his back instead of a quiver. Steve steadies his response. He needs to pass this Ultron test.
“How freaking strange is that?” Tony replied and poked at Steve.
“What’s not memorable?” Steve said and mustered his courage to cross the small space and place his hands on Tony’s hips.  If he allowed himself, then Tony’s eyes captured him. He never wanted to struggle away from that gaze, that wonder, that glittering brilliance.
Bucky ushers the man out of the small flat with a muttered, “Who the hell do you think stripped you in the first place.”
Which reminds Tony, he thought he saw a pretty nasty slash on Blu’s side during his confrontation with the Lion Hunter. He turns to investigate. “Now, I’m going to check if you’re okay. Don’t get mad at me and eat me or anything.”
When they’re finally escorted to an examining room, Steve breathes a sigh of relief. It’s a normal doctor’s office with normal equipment and examining table. All the right stuff. Steve lets out a sigh and Tony snickers as the nurse takes his vitals. When she leaves, Tony glances at Steve through his special glasses. “So, the place freaks you out?”
Steve marched right into Tony’s path and stood over him. “Don’t you even dare! I am not Hydra. Don’t you dare think that of me. And Bucky is not my boyfriend. I am not a pervert.”
Captured Hearts
“Is that why you call our lion, Blu?” Yinsen asks. His words are soft as if he’s trying to catch Tony before he crashing to the ground, but that’s not possible. Not anymore. The ground rises up and meets Tony, every night.
Sawyer bowed his head and stared at his boots as if he had something to be ashamed of. Pepper softened. “I’m sure you have a good heart.”
“Well, that’s good because neither one of us are really interested in mystical demons. We have enough on our hands with the aliens and spy stuff,” Natasha said, mimicking Wong’s pose.
“Yeah, I know. Don’t talk with your mouth full. Eat up.”
Tony knocks him with his elbow. “See I told ya.” He claps his hands. “So now what?”
“Commander?” The automated response from the lift startles him.
He shook his head. Those thoughts are for him alone, not anyone else. “The Garden was enough.”
“I would assume so. I haven’t done the math.”
“A friend wouldn’t have hidden it. A friend would have trusted me.”
Steve ignored Ross. He’d been called worse in his day. He’d been a poor bisexual man in the middle of New York City in the 30s. During his youth he’d been besieged by prejudice and hatred. Sure, it had never been as bad as vampires, but the fact remained that the laws at the time put him in the same bucket as vampires. A perversion of the norm. A disgusting creature that only needed to be hunted down and thrown away, separated from the rest of the normal, beautiful society.
“That was everything,” Tony says. He finds tears in his eyes. “It means everything to me, Steve. You mean everything to me.”
“Well, I’ll do what I can while you’re gone.” He stands up.
Tony nodded more to himself than to Steve. “Okay. Then.” He flattened his mouth and said, “I think that may be the first time I said no to someone.”
Bruce shakes his head and makes little noises that dismiss Tony’s words. “No, no, no. We all know that he met up with Logan or Wolverine or whatever that guy is called, and then spent the year with him. They traveled the States, went to Japan. From what I hear they lived together over there. They were an item.”
“Well maybe not then.” Tony stands up. The cave wobbles as he gets his legs under him. He picks up the battery. “Don’t think you should waste our food on the beast.”
The words come out of him before he's able to think about what he's saying. "No."
Clint whooped and Bruce came back to himself next to Natasha as she touched her brand to his wrist. Clint pointed to Natasha. “I told you. I told you they were doing the nasty in the barn.”
“Maybe you don’t give yourself enough,” Tony said as they headed toward his suite instead of Steve’s rooms. It seemed natural, right, that Steve wouldn’t even wonder why. “Did you ever think about your designation in this whole pack thing? I mean I know you worry about all the titles you’ve given us. From Thor as a Guide to those twins as Family, and then me as Beloved.” He waved the key card over the interface and the door unlocked. “But what about leader? You think about that?”
“inclusiveness in your day still meant separation, Captain. You have to see that there will never be equity. Not with their strength, their glamour, their immortality always in play,” Ross said as he watched Steve with a critical eye. “They represent a threat to the health and well-being of every day, good American citizens. How do we know if they’ll keep to the Treaty? That treaty was flawed from the start. They could take a mate. They will always be stronger, faster, with superhuman abilities.”
“I mean it.” Steve stands up and drops the boxers. He’s insane, possibly the pain and the torture have worn his mind to a thin ribbon barely hanging on, barely keeping his thoughts tied together. He crosses to the door, toward the open air, and captures Tony’s hands in his, He brings them close to his chest. “I would do this for you.”
He couldn’t say how or why but Tony knew it was more than a dream, more than memories mixed with half wishes. Yet, at the same time, Tony comprehended that if he walked across the room, if he opened one of the closed doors in the tenement apartment bedroom, it would open to nowhere and he would wake up. Everything would dissolve.  The dream existed outside of reality, maybe somewhere within weavings of the soul bond. A secured place for them to be together and explore who they were through this soul bond, through the linkage of Beloved.
“I need someone by my side who will be there to -.” He stops as if embarrassed to open his truths to Steve.
“Fuck! You’d seen pictures of the Red Skull, surely.”
“We have some other members of the pack who aren’t here,” Steve said.
Steve had shifted and looked directly at Tony, eyes wide with hope. “Maybe it’s something more?”
“Miss Potts, I’m here to deliver this quilt from May Parker and pick up Peter?”
“Do you really not see what just happened, Steve? Are you so used to being treated poorly that you don’t know when someone abuses you?” Tony tilts his head and narrows his eyes.
“We don’t have much time to figure out what’s up with this character, Tiberius, then,” Clint says. “As soon as you input the selection, Nat and I will be called in to the do the checks. I might have an hour, tops.”
“If he’s going after the glands for immortality, then the zombie problem isn’t secondary to him. He’s probably planning on killing those he harvests from-.” Natasha stopped and cringed. “Have any of the other covens reported missing vampires. He needs to keep vampires around for a source of the glands.”
“Captain Rogers?”
Same thing happened with vampires and mates. Logically, it made sense for vampires to be allowed one mate in a consensual relationship. But the Treaty and the laws of the US forbade it, because it meant a population that the ones in power couldn’t truly control. Too many. Vampires with their immortality, their supernatural strength, their supposed glamour, threatened the power structure of human society. If they also had mates that meant that a growing sub-population supported vampires and their existence. The ones in power refused to allow the concept to their own detriment.
Steve grimaces and shrugs. “I don’t know.”
She’s kind enough to ignore the flush to his cheeks. With a critical eye, she examines the fit, making slight tucks here and there. “The memory nanites will take the measurements and then we’ll have it fabricated for you. It won’t take too long. For your size you have amazing shoulders, so square. And your jawline is absolutely perfect, I can see why Tony’s attracted to you.” She lifts his head to check the collar. “Just make sure to use makeup to hide the hickeys please.”
“I came back for you,” Tony says and turns a bright shade of red – that Steve’s never seen on his face before in his life. He quickly tries to cover for his blunder. “For you because you need me. You can’t handle Ultron. Case in point.” He waves to Steve’s gut.
Maybe it had been the funeral. Or maybe it had been the fact that the universe decided to replace Peggy on the day of her burial, but everything closed in on Steve so fast that he clung to Tony as if he was a life line. After the funeral and the service at the side of her grave, Tony ushered all of them back to the hotel. Thor followed along, confused, a little mortified, and not a little pissed off about the soul bond. Steve didn’t even try to explain, though he knew it was his duty as the team leader, as the pack leader, to help each and every member along. Yet, Tony hushed him and told him to allow the rest of the pack to take care of things.
“I don’t want you to get hurt,” Steve said.
Steve had stood there, shocked, mortified. He couldn’t explain anything to Tony. He didn’t want to explain anything to him.
“You asked for a Personal Assistant that knows the saxophone-.” He stops because that’s still obviously wrong. “Like I said I can get out of your hair.”
Tony separates them and then Steve knows he’s made a mistake. Tony loved Pepper – and while Pepper and Morgan live on it is with them Tony will spend eternity. He spins around and faces away from Steve. Then in an exaggerated gesture, Tony throws his hands in the air and confronts Steve. His red colored eyes accentuate the anger marring his features.
“Where’s she going to go?” Tony says as he watches the pony make it back up the small hill.
That completely upends Tony’s plan for training and exerting his authority over Steven. But the truth of the matter is that Tony would have broken down and had his omega at least sleeping in the presentation suite most of the time. Plus they don’t have that much longer in flight. Some comfort and a place that’s more than the servants’ quarters might do him good. “Yes, assign him the Master of Security’s quarters and get him outfitted. Do it before the meeting today. He only has fifteen minutes.” He turns to Steven and says, “This does not mean that you are not to be ready to service me. When I say you are to go to the presentation suite. You are to submit, do you understand?”
“I will need to teach you how to reach out to one another. It will take a more purposeful connection. Right now, you know one another but you do not see one another – not as paired souls see one another.” Frigga turns to Natasha and Gamora. “You’ll have to send the message to the Soul Keeper of the Red Knight’s offer for peace.”
It’s about belief. About trust. About knowing who he is.
It’s mind boggling and dizzying to even consider. Maybe at one time as a graduate student, Tony and his pals played around with the idea of space-time but the truth of the matter is that they never really thought about it at length – there was no need to because time travel and different realities had been the stuff of science fiction. But now, an alternate Tony Stark invented some kind of nanotechnology that would trap all alternate Steve in the vortex of a singularity thereby throwing the entire reality through time and space and getting rid of the Ornari and the damage they’d done. They reset the clock while at the same time eliminating the threat. Somewhere along the lines they ended up entangling Steve and most probably Tony with their alternate selves.
“He’s fucking with me.”
Steve snorts. “What the hell does Hawkeye have to do with our relationship?”
He touches the remote and as soon as he does Samantha is back in the room.
They approach the security screen and identification console. Pep leans into the retinal scan and facial print scan. It is embedded in the wall next to the second set of doors they need to go through in order to start their acquisition. The small interface beeps and then verifies her identification. “Your turn.”
“Do I take that as a threat?”
The hologram instantly disappears with no protests detected from Richards. Tony assumes Richards will be pissed, highly pissed but won’t show it, because he’ll want to know what the hell is going on as well.  If they need Richards in the future to figure this shit out, he’ll be there, Tony’s is sure.
to Earth.
“And who’s carting your ass in?” Tony asked.
“Can you ride? Tell me Tony, please?”
When he finally pulled through the gates of his safe house, the sun touched the horizon. The safe house was situated in the middle of the Poconos Mountains. They didn’t have the chance to unload the car. They needed to get inside and be safe from the weakening damage of the ultraviolet rays. When he turned into the driveway of the stone house, Bruce started to pack up the cooler. He snapped it shut as Tony shut off the engine. Getting out of the vehicle, Tony opened the back door. Luckily the tree line of heavy pines to the east of the house blocked the direct rays of the sun. He reached in and grabbed one of the coolers. “Leave the rest of the luggage.”
“He shouldn’t have done it,” Clint said. “Do you know he didn’t even call in Bruce? Bruce is part of his fucking pack and he decided to take down all of Hydra on his own, Like he’s a fucking-.”
“She’s gone, Tony, gone,” Steve said and, as he looked up to meet Tony’s gaze, that same feeling of alienation and isolation pulsed through the bond. The anguish grew and Tony dropped to sit next to Steve, not sure he could remain standing.
He towels dry. Slipping into his sweats and t-shirt with a hoodie, he finger combs his hair and doesn’t take the time to shave.  He should try more, but right now he doesn’t give a fuck. When he finally summons the courage to go downstairs and join Steve, the aroma of stew fills the air along with freshly baked bread.
He should turn back, and he stops in mid-air. Somewhere over the coast of India, he hovers. Going back to Malibu, to his life and his problems. Steve wanted him to live a life and not be endlessly stuck in the same problem. He wanted him to do something with his life and not waste it. It might sound trite, but it’s what he has – a dying man’s wish.
Waiting to defuse the situation, Tony perked up and asked, “What magic cube?”
“This looks good. But can we drink it and not get worms?”
“Holy shit! Really?” Tony said and that distant look dissipated as he latched onto the new information. “Like it’s trying to go beyond or something?”
“I’m trying.  I got some access,” Tony reported.
“You’re one of Steve’s closest friends, Nat, who else would I call?”
Clint went up to the fireplace and placed one of his wrist bands to the stones. The image shuttered, and an elevator appeared. He keyed in the code and then they walked onto the elevator. As the doors closed the stones on the fireplace materialized again. Steve smiled ruefully.
“I know,” Tony said and then added, “We all know.”
“I thought you might be hungry. I have some work to do. So why don’t you watch the stream while I work.”  He points to the console and then nods as he looks Steve up and down. Steve’s still dressed but he did leave the robe in the bathroom.
“So is that other Steve, is he alive?” Logan asks.
Tony hums a little tune to himself and shakes his head. “No need to dwell. It doesn’t matter. We go to see Strange today.”
“Hmm. The room’s interface with the implant needs to be turned off. It’s by the fireplace,” Tony doesn’t want to talk right now. It just jogs his head more. At a slow pace Steve leads them back into the living room, telling Tony to step down into the lounge area.
Rumlow screams, "This isn't over. Your ass is mine. You goddamned slut, Captain Assfuck."  Somehow he climbs up on the old conveyer belt and riddles the place with bullets. That's when Steve wakes up.
“I know. I’ve been giving him the iron pills,” Tony replied. “And lots of red meat.”
“In other words, he remembers what Ultron remembers.”
“You could say that,” Tony says and he’s on his feet as well. “Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in physics, in the most elementary description of how sub atomic particles act. It happens with pairs of particles. When they interact or are close in a quantum state then they become linked in how you can describe them. You cannot describe one without describing the other regardless of how far they are apart, because they influence each other.”
CHAPTER 5
The rooftop observation deck has every amenity anyone could ever ask for, from telescopes to hot tubs to a small shaded area with green grass and miniature trees with an umbrella and chairs. Somehow or another, they end up on the grass, sitting there without a blanket but with cushions stolen from the lounge chairs. The hot pot is on a wooden platter and the pad Thai is on a dish. They both have chopsticks which have been abandoned for forks and spoons.
“Tony, it’s not necessary,” Steve says and pulls out a roll of aluminum foil. He rolls each potato in the foil.
“What?” he replies and knows how stupid he must sound.
Tony was his everything, though even today after six years together Steve knew that he worried about their relationship. So many times, Tony asked about consent and whether or not Steve ever regretted what happened.
Tony pulls his chair out and sits down. “Don’t know how they can call it the storm of the century when it’s literally just the start of said century.”
Tony doesn’t say he’s incapable of moving at the moment. Steve doesn’t need to know that right now. Being blind isn’t the worst of it. It’s the headaches and the pain. He can deal with blindness (no, no he can’t). What he fails at is handling the pain. His medical staff, including Doctor Strange, figures that the implant exacerbates the lasting effects of the TBI and if he would have it removed, then he would be nearly free of the pain. But that would mean living a life without sight. How can an engineer do that? How can he fucking give up his sight? He did that for the first few years until he started to wear a rudimentary transmitter (it looked like an earbud) and carried Dummy around. Dummy worked, but not like the glasses do. The glasses were a huge leap forward. Combining the technology of electronic photography, virtual reality, and bionanomaterials brought Tony closer to real sight. He knows it’s not the real thing, he knows part of what he picks up with the implant is literally configured by the nano-core in the glasses. Sometimes the backgrounds of offices or open spaces fuzz out and turn into what Tony can only describe as CGI of a video game. Most of the time it works – it works well enough for up close and personal. He can’t drive, but he can interact with people. He can still design and discover. He can do his damned job. He can be Tony Stark.
Tony clasps Steve’s fist and slowly unclenches his fingers. Lightly, he caresses the inside of Steve’s palm. “I’m sorry, I never thought of that.” Tony cringes and then looks up at him. “I forget – I mean I forget that you’re-.” He stops as if not wanting to finish the sentence.
“Cho release you?” Tony looks him up and down.
“Name?” Tony looks at Steve with his one brow arched. He has a tendency to do that instead of furrowing his brows when confused or perplexed.
“Just extra vitamins and crap. Makes you feel good about drinking a smoothie.” He picked up his cup as it was placed on the counter. “Try it. You’ll like it.”
He sighs and it hurts his chest. Everything hurts. “Don’t leave. Not now. I know you have a secret and I hate secrets. I need to know what’s going on. I need to know why you are so god damned sure about us being together. It’s like you know something, something about me, or you, or us, or our future. God, what do you know?” He picks up Steve’s hand then and holds it, grasps it like it is a lifeline toward the future.
“I would say so. Might I suggest that you stay in your originally assigned quarters.”
Bucky nods and then says, “Have a good one Steve, see you later?”
Wearily, Steve reached up and covered Tony’s hand with his own. “Not going anywhere.”
His gaze drifts through the crowd and he admits to himself, he’s searching for Tony – and he finds him. He stands out. He’s the only one wearing a white tuxedo with a sharp steel gray vest. Instead of a bow tie he has something like an amulet at his throat closing the gap at the collar of his dress shirt. It gleams with a blue light. It bathes the front of his tuxedo in an ephemeral glow, giving Tony an almost fantastical essence. By his side is Pepper and Steve swallows down the ache in his chest as he sees the sparkle in Tony’s eyes as he watches the crowd through his glasses.  He curses Strange for bringing him here. He shouldn’t have come. He was tossed aside from his employment and told he hadn’t protected Tony. His philosophy on how to be a personal assistant, a friend, maybe something more isn’t wanted here. Steve turns to leave and manages to bump right into Rhodes.
“You don’t think that’s possible, do you?”
“Don’t worry. It won’t go to waste. We recycle everything on the ship,” Tony says, and he selects what looks like an omelet and some meat that might be bacon.
Finally, he comes back to himself, and knows he has to face facts. He’s healing and his mission is to find out what happened to the Realms. If he truly wants to keep Tony safe, then he has to consider that the Boundaries are shut and the world is in danger. He swims back until he can stand and he spots Tony on the beach, watching him. Spreading his wings to catch the sun, he smiles at Tony and his heart aches. How badly he wants Tony isn’t in doubt, how he cannot have him – is painful, how he can resolve the issue is the one thing in jeopardy. If not for Tony today, Steve would have doomed them both, and that is very out of character.
“Yeah,” Tony said and invited himself to touch Steve.  Just thinking that the act of touch, the simple act of brushing his hand down Steve’s chest to the small of his waist could be so beautiful, send such thrilling sensations through him awed Tony. He wanted to leap on Steve, to kiss him everywhere, but he held back and let Steve guide them.
“Well, looks like you know everything there is to know about me.” He can’t help it, but his words sound harsh, angry.
The letter meant a certain escape. Steve had never backed down from anything in his life. He’d considered retiring from the Avengers when the Accords were brought into play, but his life had always been about service. Without a gland, he might be able to claim the freedom of choice.
The whole team awaited his call and the Legion were out in the fields in anticipation of the war games. Laura had the kids up in their rooms, watching from the windows. He was fairly certain she even popped popcorn for the occasion.
When their lips touch, the newness and the trepidation falls away while their desire and eagerness blossoms and grows. In his day, Tony’s kissed so many people, but it’s never been quite like this, never felt like he wanted it to last beyond the physical sensation, that he wanted it to develop into something deep and abiding. He thought he loved Pepper, but it was never like this, never so profoundly intense. He never knew this before in his life. The touch of Steve’s lips, the exploration and taste of his tongue sets Tony on fire not only in his body, but in his soul and his mind. His entire self yearns and wants.  He grasps hold of Steve’s shirt and holds on but knows he needs to let go; he needs to ensure they take this slow. He wants it to last, to endure.
“Yep. Hershey bars, rations.” Steve scatters his horde across the floor of the Quin Jet. “I’m ravenous like in real life.”
The ground shifts and Tony swears there is an earthquake as he stumbles backward almost falling onto the bed. His whole body rings with the onslaught of the revelation. “You- wait, what?”
“You,” the leader says and points to Steve.
Obie, who is hanging near the doorway to the workshop, pops into the vast laboratory space that Tony designed in the 5th Avenue mansion. It's in the basement and it leads into the huge garage with Tony's collection of antique cars.
On the recording Steve’s voice isn’t as strong as it normally is – it sounds cut, slashed of hope.
“Excuse you, this armor isn’t finished. And what the hell happened to your nose?”
Without breaking their locked gaze, Steve slips off his tunic and his pants throwing them to the side. The prince’s hands glide over as if gracing him with a blessing. Steve’s skin responds and he arches into the touch. It’s so very wonderful and telling. Straddling the prince, Steve reaches back and glides the plug out of his own ass and then angles his hips to tease his entrance against Tony’s cock and balls, provoking a garbled response.
“The therapist said I’m cured. Whatever that means.”
The lift swiftly descends. It’s partially open so he can see the levels of his ship speed by. As a Court vessel it is one of the largest ships of his fleet. There are three main levels off of the forward section of the ship. The bridge sits up top, the engineering and tactical areas are in the mid-section, and the servant quarters are below that. His quarters and that of his Family are in the aft section where the other luxury areas of the vessel lie. He leaves the lift as it arrives, not even waiting for the final announcement of the level.
“She gave me some meds, I’m not sure they’ll help,” Tony says and sets down the canvas bag the doctor had carried. He peers over his shoulder at the empty hall, toward the ghost of the doctor.  Turning back to Steve, he asks, “Do you know what’s spooked her? I mean what’s a Collapsing Event.”
Frigga? The Silver Knight’s mind twists as the name pops into his head along with an image of a mighty warrior that wielded a magic hammer and lightning. “Thor?”
Steve looks away and Tony spots the tears in his eyes. “I’ve spent several lifetime’s looking for my place. As a sickly man, as a soldier, as a beast among humans, and now as – whoever I am now.” He brings his gaze back to Tony. “When I saw you in that cave, everything about you changed me. I saw how hard you fought, how determined. I watched as you built a miracle machine from scraps. I followed you out and protected you because you deserved it. When you came back for me-.” He pauses and swallows hard. “When you came back, I thought I’d died and finally gone to heaven. Here you were, back and saving me. You didn’t leave me. You came back. I did everything I could to show you how much it meant to me. How much you meant to me.”
“How? How do you wipe away decades of conditioning? I think differently. I walk into a room, I immediately know the lay of the land. Just in this simple room there are 37 different ways I can kill you. Do you understand, Steve? This isn’t just something you play with.” Bucky stood up and the brawn of his muscles and shoulders, the way the metal gears of his arm whined shadowed over everything Steve knew about him.
They signed a contract, they became their go to – omega or alpha for heats/presentation cycles or an alpha’s urgency cycle. It worked out. They weren’t a couple, not really. They were just team mates helping one another. Becoming a couple, being bonded happened over the course of events in their lives. Tony’s mansion went into the ocean and Steve destroyed Hydra inside of SHIELD before they were bonded. He thought it would be happily ever after – but it wasn’t – because a nefarious force tried to assassinate Tony and Steve flew into the warrior’s rage. The Rage is well known – because an omega’s first duty is the protection of the alpha at all costs. Doggedly, Steve hunted down the small group of terrorists trying to destabilize the world – but he never thought they might come after him. They did – and they experimented. Experimented once they realized he was an omega.
“No.” She waited for him to process her simple words. “I told you he’s fine. Just changed.”
Tony stands next to Steve and hesitates before he places his hand on the small of his back. “Well, we can have sandwiches and coffee.”
Tony wants to pout but he’s too intrigued by Steve’s hypothesis. “I hadn’t considered that at all.” Does he want to go down the pathway? Is being blind in public even an option for him? For these past 10 years it hasn’t been, he’s paid hundred of thousands of dollars to ensure no one would speak of it. “Damn.”
“He was your personal assistant Tony, not your boyfriend.”
“You never knew me at all.”
“No, I just-.”
“Lots of them.” Steve turned then, not wanting Tony to see his eyes as he spoke. “I went into art instead of something that would put food on the table. I foolishly thought dreams came true.” He laughed then, a hard rock on his chest. “Then Bucky went off to war and I literally couldn’t feed myself. I had too many meds to take and had to make a choice.”
Rhodey was jittery and scanned the area like they might be attacked at any moment by a rabid vampire. Tony had laughed and told him that vampires couldn’t get rabies; they’re already dead. That was when they bumped into a vampire. The vamp must have only been in his late teens when he was turned, but he seemed older in his maturity. He agreed to escort them to the Blood Den.
When he climbed back to consciousness again, someone stood over him. He couldn’t figure out who it was. The pain blinded him. He heard whispered words of concern and the sounds solidified until he recognized the doctors’ hurried commands, and then nurses touching him and moving him. Even though the fog of pain, he knew the comfort of familiarity. The one who’d picked him up from the riverbank, the one who’d brought him away from the smoke and death of the waters stood by him, held onto him. Steve sought that one figure, that one person to stay close to him. Steve reached out, his soul aching with need and yearning, and hands clasped.
“Come on, let’s go to bed.”
“How would you like me, my lord?” His blue eyes are shot with darkness and their crystalline nature glimmer against the hyper-scape shining around them through the windows. They are sharp as shards, piercing in their anger. Though Tony has to admit, he’s breathtaking – his muscles have filled out and his shoulders are a masterpiece. His waist small and tight and his Adonis belt something that makes Tony’s mouth water with anticipation.
“I don’t want you to be my plus one. Steve is my plus one.” That sounds cruel even to his ears. He grasps her hand and squeezes it. “It’s not that I don’t love you. You know that I do. But I really – I want that connection with him.”
“Yes, it will,” Steve replies and narrows his eyes as he looks at Stane. Something is off-kilter, wrong, and imbalanced. Steve needs to get him alone; but would Tony be willing and open to it is another question. “Perhaps when we get to the Lemurian Star?”
Steve sat down on the couch, his plate heaping with pizza slices. “The Bucky reveal went horribly.” He put the plate on the coffee table. “Tony doesn’t like the idea of having Bucky as a pack mate –sounds like we are all dogs – someone who killed his parents.”
“Indefinitely. I can power the engines, believe it or not.” Tony pulled away and smiled. “I just need to be exposed to the night sky and I can power them.” He touched his chest.
“You don’t want Steve Rogers then?” She picks up her tablet, readying to wipe him off the list.
Over the past two month, Steve entertained a variety of different clients from the silent ones who just want to get down to business to the talkative ones who, to the shy and awkward ones, to the abrasive and short tempered ones. They all respond to him to different degrees. Some only grunt, others stay quiet, while others scream like they’re on fire.
“The girl and her brother. The ones who attacked,” Steve said, licked his lips, and then finished. “The ones who attacked the train.”
“Let’s go. We don’t have a lot of time,” Natasha said. “Can you get these off of him?” She’d turned to Clint and he shook his head.
“Yes, going to do it. Exactly like you say, Captain. My Captain.”
“Not sure that’s the deal.”
“But you said he wanted to find a cure for the vampire ‘disease’.” Tony used air quotes to set disease apart.
“Okay, I think I have enough,” Steve announces and Tony jerks toward him.
When he awakes again and opens his eyes, he sees a gnarled old women with knobbed hands and a pleasant, if senior face. Wiry ringlets of silver and black crown her head and she smiles at him when she notices he’s awake.
As sure as he asserts that he’ll accept the assignment, Steve instantly thinks everything in his life is about to change.
It rocks Steve down to his core. He’d asked that question once to Peggy when he sat with her. He remembers how he questioned everything, how he didn’t even know what was right anymore. But the truth remains, tied to his heart that the Revelation came to him and he sees that the Soul Keeper, the Red Skull, used him for his own nefarious purposes – there can be no right to that. “I know enough to know that you’ve used everyone. You’ve captured them as the Soul Keeper, and you’ve kept them here from moving on.”
“Because,” Tony says and then rubs at his eyes. He throws himself back in the chair. “Obie, I know what has to be done, I just don’t know if I can do it.” He climbs to his feet, and he looks older than his years. “There are things in this universe, millions of ways to get a resolution of sorts. This one, this one means I sacrifice myself. I become the Conclave and I don’t know if I’m that selfless. If I can take on that mantle and not be corrupted by it.”
“Simple, the SHIELD files, the ones you and Nat dropped onto the internet? Well, I had that and some of the bugged stuff I found – all of it JARVIS saved, sorted, analyzed. JARVIS, my man, would have put it in the correct dossier. And since Fury knew about the farm-.”
Going to the en suite, Steve peers into the cavernous room and sees Tony laying out his purchased goods on the vast dressing countertop. Almost shyly Tony says, “I thought, I thought maybe you could pick out some of the soaps and lotions, and we could shower together. I promised you a shower, earlier. As a way to relax, and I’d like to take care of you, make it up to you.”
“Please, more. More. All of you. God, I want all of you. So thick, so full.”
“Can fix yourself if there’s nothing broken,” Tony mutters and turns off the water. He tugs off his shirt and drops it on the floor. He drags himself back to the bed and falls onto it. He’ll deal with it all tomorrow.
Obie stops Tony in his tracks before he enters the box. He grabs hold of Tony’s shoulders and looks directly at him. “This isn’t any game of checkers, son. This is chess on a grand scale. If you become a pawn of some other system, what happens then to your big dreams after the war. Think about the bigger picture here, Tony. We have to play a long term strategy.”
“You sure?”
“Hmm?” He tries to clear his head but the fog has settled all around the edges. He’d thought someone else was here, someone he didn’t know. He takes the cup and drinks; he feels parched, dry like the desert sands.
Stunned at its sheer size and the line of it – it reminds him of Tony and his Iron Man armors. He scans the great ship. Bay thirty-two harbors only the largest ships and it is clear that this one has to be one of the largest ships outside the Honor Guard fleet and the Project Insight Heli-carriers. Fathoming the wealth and power behind such a large personal possession humbles him and astonishes him at the same time.  He paces down the length of the red ship with its gold accents. There’s nothing not designed and beautiful about it. This is a masterpiece of engineering and design. It is pure artistry.
“No, they’ll find you that way. I can’t have them hurt you, too.”
Yanking at him, Steve had tried to pull Bucky away from the window. “Please, damn it, Buck. He’s not hurting me.”
As he drives the car into the small parking lot near several squat buildings at the edge of the docks, he thinks he should probably call Pepper or maybe Rhodey. He’s fooling himself if he thinks he can handle this – he doesn’t even know if Steve’s here, or if this is some kind of set up to kill him.
Steve lets Tony’s erection slide from his mouth and feels the heat of embarrassment touch his cheeks. “No, not this.”
Because Steve might have saved the man, but Tony’s soul – that’s still up for grabs.  The voices of reason though pound at him, the crumpled expression on Pepper’s face, the worry lines on Rhodey’s. He has to stop, eventually. He has to give up and surrender to the idea that Steve died, and the government will continue to disavow all knowledge of a soldier they sent into harm’s way to rescue a degenerate like Tony.
Tony spits back, “Somehow I find that very hard to believe.” Steve sees it dawn on Tony that he’s leaving. “Where are you going?”
"Tell me, dear, I'm getting too old and not as bright as I used to be." She smiles and there's something lonely in her eyes.
One of the V-corps members stepped up to the vampire and nudged at his mouth. The camera zoomed in to show the fangs missing. Natasha cursed in Russian.
“None of that, I’m gamey enough,” Tony chuckles, but he hugs Blu close. He knows that things will be different; he’ll be seen as not sane, crazy. None of it matters. All that matters is that they stay together.
“God, I loved you like a brother. You brought me back from them. And now this?” Bucky mourned, and he let loose, the fist crashed into Steve’s cheekbone and it shattered, sending rockets of pain blasting through Steve’s skull.
"The SSR did not disappear. It evolved and there were people within it with their agendas. Howard, Hank they all had their agendas but then it changes. Doesn't it? They wanted him. And they -."  She stops
The voice sounds so familiar, so sweet and devoted. So wanted and loved. He turns toward the voice and Natasha stands up and out of the way. He sees a figment and he wonders if he’s hallucinating again.
“The Core is the Soul. The Core is in me. I am the Soul.” He battered the bag as he spoke each word and the memories of the last weeks slammed into him less like fond recollections and more like battering rams. “The Core is the Soul. The Core is in me. I am the Soul.” He didn’t want Natasha, or Bruce, or heaven forbid, Peggy to listen in on his scattered and slightly perverse thoughts.
Tony cannot argue, his limbs feel loose, his bones ache, and his chest feels like it might burst from the broad strips of ropes that feel like they are wrapped around it. “Yeah, you’re probably right.” He takes another draw of water that Steve offers him from a small tin cup and then lays back on the bed. One hand cradled over his chest, and the other supporting his head, he says to Steve, “You ever wonder if there’s a great beyond?”
“I know,” Tony said because he did know. He understood that Peggy was gone, that one of the last links to his time, his home, had died leaving Steve behind, and as he thought it – the idea of Steve being left behind leaked through the bond. Steve shuddered next to him and covered his face as if he experienced shame in his weakness.
He sits up, rolling his shoulders and then examines the manacles around his wrists. The chain might have been helpful, but now it’s a hinderance. He tests it.
“How the hell is Natasha here?” Tony grumbles from within the sleeping bag.
“Both Natasha and Clint are part of SHIELD. So was Coulson. I trusted Coulson. He didn’t have some underhanded agenda. He wanted to do the right thing. So does Clint, and maybe so does Natasha.” Now it was Steve’s turn to judge. “An organization is only as good as its people. And I put my trust and faith in people.”
“Well, there’s nothing for it.” Steve pulls on the skintight leggings and that clearly show the bulge of his cock. Over the black leggings he pulls on the red satin tunic and then the long sleeveless vest that reaches to his knees. It’s black and ribbed with red. The yellow embroidering on the back displays a complicated abstract symbol that reminds Steve of the Iron Man face mask. It’s not that at all, but it sure looks like it. He has to admit, the outfit is perfect.
He climbs the last of the stairs and walks over to Steve's door. He shouldn't be here in more ways than one. He never texted, he didn't set up a meeting. He just got in town and he wants to surprise Steve. He has a bag of bagels and a variety of cream cheeses. It's late morning and he figures Steve should be free and getting ready to sleep or already sleeping. He crosses to the door and, as he's about to knock, the door opens.
“It’s the Passage to the next rim.”
Tony lounges at the table with a spread of food that a catastrophe of waste. Steve frowns but tucks in and pours himself some of the coffee. He also pours Tony another cup. Tony has a tablet on his lap with his feet balanced on the edge of the table. He’s dressed in his uniform suit again, but this one’s fresh. One of the crew must have delivered it while Steve took his shower. Tony flicks through some of the hovering holographs that dance through the air above his tablet.
Collapsing onto the bench, he bends over with his head in his hands. There may be still time to stop it. He slips his one hand into his pocket to pull out his glasses, he could access Jarwin at any time and tell him to stop. He doesn’t. He sits there stupefied and paralyzed by his own indecision. The anger he feels is real – the omega denied him drink as if Tony was child and Steven his mother. And then he slung insults at him to boot. The fact that he would dare to do such a thing still stuns Tony. He deserves his punishment.
“Thanks,” he says and adjusts the bag on his shoulder.
“But in the end I had to make a choice and I’m at peace with the one I made,” Natasha says and nods. There’s only the slightest of hesitations.
Tony brushes his thumb over the angular jut of Steve’s knee cap. “You’re so big I forget how slim you are, too.” His hand travels down Steve’s calf. “Sometimes without the visual keys I don’t really have an image in my mind of how you look. I kind of link you to sound or a fragrance. Like Pepper – she’s always strawberries to me, even though she’s deathly allergic to them. She wears this perfume that has an undercurrent of strawberries to it. She doesn’t smell it. I do.”
So he decides – for now – to ignore it, bury it. “Come, the meeting is starting and I like to make an entrance.”
“I will be. Let’s get you to the offices and then I’ll meet you there. I’ll bring him up from the lobby in a bit.”
“Why are you being terminated if your bond is out?”
Natasha arrived like the dark storm she was. JAVRIS announced her arrival right before security accepted her identification and she left the car she was driving in front of the house for Happy to deal with. Thor appeared shortly thereafter with a grave look in his eyes, and the rain brewed around him. Breaking the news to Natasha meant exposing the fact that Bruce kept important information from the coven for decades. There was reason they called her the Black Widow. Bruce kept his head bowed and offered to go into stasis for his actions or inactions. Natasha only rolled her eyes.
“You don’t have to do that,” Tony said, his voice low. “Try and make me feel better about your living situation compared to mine. I know I was lucky, fortunate. I know others aren’t.” Tony stepped into the light. A mixture of emotions filtered over his face. Before Steve replied, Tony shifted the conversation. “This must be an illusion or something. I bet the rest of the team is sitting there watching and laughing their asses off at us.” He wrapped his arms around his chest. “This is not nice.”
“Most of the time?” Steve asks but his gaze is drawn to the windows. For a second, Tony wishes he could be the object of so much intensity, so much concentration. But it’s never to be. While Tony might look like the playboy to the outside world, he leaves them fairly quickly. He doesn’t want his façade to ever break down in front of the press or anyone else.
“Tony!” Steve yells as the armor launches into the air.
“Good. I’m good with it. Just have to get my bearings. I need to do some research.”
Pepper only gave him a small worried smile. Neither of them wanted to be here. They got back into the black rented SUV and then Pepper navigated into the main yard of the fortress. Several guards stood at attention near the steps of the facility. It looked like it was popped out of an old established university and plopped here in the desolate place in the Rocky Mountains.
“No. I won’t listen to any of you. You’re all my employees. All of you. I asked, no. I demand privacy and you broke that, Vision, by bringing someone into the house that-.”
“Do I? The war with the Kree is getting worse every day. Fighting an AI isn’t like anything else; it rarely makes mistakes. Not like organics. Then there’s the idea of allying with Synthezoids. If we do that, is it any better? They’re not organics, not really.” Tony trembles. It’s subtle and if Steve hadn’t been touching him, he doubts he would have noticed.
“I don’t think they’re coming.” Tony peers out through the wooden slates of the blinds at the same time he hears the telltale chirp of Steve’s phone. He cringes. It can only mean one thing – a text. Steve insists on a bird chirp for the text messages. He always grins when it goes off like some kind of idiotic monkey. A text is not a good sign.
“I’m sure. He can come to the conference. It won’t matter,” Steve says. He goes back to his desk and swings into the chair. Sweeping his hand over the console it lights up and he retrieves the diplomat listings.  The conference is huge, it isn’t a small affair; he doubts he’ll even see Tony.
Logan has been quiet. He watches both Tony and Bruce hash out the particulars. Tony knows he’s happy, if this works then Steve won’t have that link to the Steve who loved Tony. Not anymore.
“Stark, Tony Stark.”
Steve pushed forward but the chains suddenly went stiff, as if they weren’t chains at all. When he looked up, the chains had morphed into long poles with cuffs at the end. Adamantium had properties but he didn’t think it could transform like this -.
Steve drops his utensil. “What?”
Redwing bobs up and down, and then sings out.
“No-.” He wheezes again.  He needs his inhaler. Damn, what was he thinking? He can’t do this; he needs access to his inhaler. Breathing tightens his chest even further, every time he tries it cycles back to strengthen the grip on his bronchi. “No-. To-.”  He can’t keep his legs under him, and he tumbles down to his knees, grasping at Tony with his gloved hand.
Steve finishes up and cleans his hands, then brushes his teeth. He checks his hair, combing it and then leaves the bathroom. “We’ll I’m not an artist anymore.”
“Perhaps you want to be a little less vague and -.” Tony flicked his fingers in a wave at Strange. “A little less that and tell us what the hell is going on.”
“JARVIS should learn to mind his own business,” Tony commented and then reality came into focus as the last vestiges of the dreamscape dissipated. “Steve! Steve? You have updates on Steve?”
Tony finds him sitting there under the dead tree and eases down next to him. He joins Steve staring out into the glinting oranges and reds as if he sees something on the indistinct horizon that he can’t glimpse.
“What’s that?”
“Captain Rogers, it’s nice that you agree to come tonight,” Rhodes says and there’s something in his tone that stops Steve’s immediate need to escape. “Let me be the first to apologize for our over reaction to what happened with your employment.”
Tony pointed to the screen she looked at. “Is he stable? Any medical reasons not to try?”
family business is up to him to decide and not Stane or the Board of Directors.
“Fine.” Tony huffs. “How do you want to do this?”
It drifted in and out of his consciousness.
“Hmm. Thor, no?” Steve takes out the toothbrush, spits, and then wipes his face. “I’m sorry Thor. Whatever happened last night, it can’t happen again. I’m not interested in a relationship with you.”
He shifted and sat right next to Steve, wrapping an arm around those wide shoulders that always served to lift the weight of the world while no one held him. “It’s okay. Hey, I’m here.” Knowing how uncomfortable it might make Steve, Tony changed gears. “We’ll all here for you.”
They pause of a minute, both of them panting and fighting for breath. “Wh-what do you mean you hacked him?”
Tony leaves and the door partially closes. Steve ignores it, ignores everything except the view from the art room.
Tony reaches over and clasps Steve’s hand. “Then you are in for a treat!” He looks down at himself. “I’m going to get into something more appropriate. You finish up and then I’ll meet you back here in 15?”
“Do you often get drunk?” Tony knows he’s treading on territory that’s questionable for an employer. The wind blows over the table, rattling the umbrella.
Clint toggles the steering column back and the whole ship rebels. The explosions rock and lurch the ship with such force that neither Bucky nor Sam can make it back to their feet. The hull whines in protest. The electronics spark and screech.
This does not mean I am not going to write in Stony or that I am not going to write in the fandom. I will probably write Stony one shots. And I have a few Steve centric stories I will write so that's still brewing.
Rumlow smirked and cocked an eyebrow. “You so sure you want to do it this way. Looks like he hurt you pretty damn much.”
“None of them?”
“Fuck!” It’s the lion. It’s going to fucking eat him. If he had energy or any ability to move, he would scramble away. As it is, the lion simply licks him again and then opens its mouth. Tony whimpers. He wants to curl up, he wants to run, but his body freezes with fear.
Steve cleared his throat and persisted. “It hasn’t. Like you said, we don’t know if an urgency cycle is what’s happening. But I think I would be the best candidate to help him. With the serum I can withstand-”
“Yeah, yeah!” Bruce smiled. “Yeah I think that has to be it. So as the Healer of the pack – this is my job, Steve. You need to be here to finalize the bond I would think, but I have to bring Clint’s astral projection back to his body so to speak.”
He chuckles as if this whole thing is just a joke. “What else did you want them to do? Kept them entertained as long as I could. Sorry wasn’t longer.”
JARVIS translates into the local Farsi dialect.
“Not my proudest moment.”
“Maybe,” Steve says. There’s nothing for it he knows. He’s done for, finished. “I think you might be the devil.”
“Love and happiness. Really? I mean if anyone should be cynical it should be me. But you grew up with happily ever after. I grew up with something is only cool if the main character that you love dies or turns out to be the bad guy.” Tony shakes his head. “No, if anyone’s going to be the pessimist about this, it should be me.”
“I’m coming back.”
As Steve finishes testing the stew, he looks up from his spoon and says, “Do you want to start a fire. We can sit in the living room and eat, maybe?” Tony looks at the stone fireplace with the big fake fur rug in front of it. As if completely innocent, Steve ladles the stew into the big stoneware bowls as he says, “Right in front of the fire. It would almost be like we were camping out.”
“Bowling for Nazis?”
Tony mourns. He recalls how Steve fell down in front of him, worn and hopeless as the worst of the damage scorched across Tony’s right arm and the right side of his face. It could have been so much worse. The armor protected what it could. The nanites shielded him within their vibranium cores. But the battle caused weaknesses in the armor and that’s what wounded him. Even as they won, Steve crawled to his side and wept. He hadn’t known the depth of Steve’s feeling before that moment, he hadn’t even known his own. Yet, as the seconds drifted by and the world filled with ashes again, Steve curled around him, willing him to live, murmuring words that to this day Tony cannot remember. He wants to have the chance to ask Steve. He wants to know what Steve said. He wants another chance.
At Steve’s side, Tony marks the dark circles marring his features. It’s perplexing. Why would someone sleeping look so very tired?
“The mating blocks?” She shakes her head.  “Steve, you know that you can’t possibly go there and expect not to be recognized.” She folds her arms across her chest. She’s staring at him, fierce, firm. His energy, his heat, grows and he knows he might just fall on his knees in front of her and beg her to ease the pain, but he can’t. The team – or what is left of it – can’t be broken again. He can’t expect others to help him anymore. He’s on his own. He’s been there before – but he knows that’s a lie. He needs to stop lying to himself.
“It’s not about him. It’s not about the most moral man I’ve ever known. The best man. No, it’s about his last gift to us,” Howard said, his expression troubled, tormented. Tony had read enough books from the Lord of the Rings books to the Lord of the Flies to understand a haunted man.
“If you will wait, I’ll tell Master Stark that you are here to engage him in him in a business proposition.”
“Probably right,” Steve agreed. He stood there, not knowing what to do with his hands and his legs jittered. “Well, I-. I finished.” He gestured to the bed like he presented a prized cow or something equally as ridiculous in the situation.
Through gritted teeth, he snarls, “Don’t let them cut it off. Steve, don’t let them cut it off.”
“I’m not interested in your newest obsession with alpha porn,” Tony says but he stops for a moment in the hallway. Penny of all of his AIs happens to be the one that shoots from the hip and always hit her target.  “What is it?” He already knows what she’s going to say – he feels the heaviness in his gut, the tight coil in his groin.
This draws Steve to his feet and he’s taller than Tony at least by a head, but he feels dwarfed by Tony’s presence, his attitude, his self-assurance. “I don’t know Tony, this is a first for me. I haven’t ever.” He doesn’t want to admit he’s never truly given into his thoughts, his desires. He shouldn’t feel ashamed of that fact, but proud, yet somehow, in front of Tony, the embarrassment of years of lying overcomes him.
“Not leaving without you,” Sam returns. “Plus you got my bird.”
“No one said you were.”
Steve presses the icon. “Hey big guy…”
Tony chews back his words, the sharp, cutting ones he normally grabs onto in order to shield himself, like a suit of armor. “You. You don’t have to leave.” He slowly reaches up and takes off his glasses. “Not having money is something you can remedy, Steve. Not having the gift of sight is not something I can fix, apparently.” He feels the wet on his face, tears streaking down. His vulnerabilities laid bare. “You can sympathize with me, Steve. You can feel pity, but you can’t empathize. You couldn’t even if you tried your damnedest.”
The story weaves further and he hears how the world fell into war again, but this time the war threatened to end all hope, all civilization with the rise of the Third Reich and the Red Skull. That name terrifies him, and a flash of the Soul Keeper warns him to not listen. Over the din of the pain gathering in his chest, Steve concentrates on Natasha’s story.
“Go play with Nat or something and get out of my hair,” Steve says and smiles.
Tony leans into Steve and whispers, “Get me out of here.”
“And did they? Did he?” Tony never really cared much for ancient generations’ stories. What’s the point? They’re dead and gone, not really changing today at all.
Tony narrowed his focus on Steve as the vibrations along the soul bonds intensified. Steve pressed his lips into a tight line but then bobbed his head. “I know the mission is the scepter, but we also go in and try and get the twins as well as Bucky.”
EPILOGUE – Three Months after the Escape from the Triskelion
“You don’t have to believe that.” Tony’s words felt as if they hung in the air with a specific density. The room, the world around him, became heavier and thicker.
Tony furrows his brow and says, “I wonder – you called me Tony at one point. Now it’s back to formalities.”
“Well, let me clean up,” Steve says. As he starts to close up their nearly untouched lunch, he adds, “I will leave if you want me to Tony. You don’t have to-.”
“I didn’t know you had a meeting with Pepper, you should have said something,” Steve says and turns to him just as Tony spots a large truck barreling down the driveway of the building toward them. He twists the steering wheel to veer out of the way, but it’s too late, far too late.
“Your rank? Did they hit you on the head, too?”
“I think that you have to realize, Captain, that we’re not talking about people anymore.” Pierce gave him a half smile. “I can feel for you because things are changed, different than the war.”
“God, Steve, no.” A chill of loneliness crawls up Tony’s spine. There were too many bad people in Tony’s life for him to believe that Steve acted with malice. He swallows the hard pain that’s welling in him. “I wanted to protect you from what I learned – how your friend killed-.” And then his voice breaks, and he barely gets out the word mother before a sob cracks and chokes him.
For a second, Tony thinks he’s gone too far, but then Steve considers his request with a tiny grin. “Remember what you said about some people are better friends? Let’s just say it was something like that.”
“This is it, you don’t get another chance,” Fury says, his one wing arching out framing the long sill of the window behind him in the palace. “There are those amongst the Archangels who don’t think you deserve another chance, not after James.”
As Steve sank into the kiss, he allowed himself the release of the tension in his shoulders, in his gut where fear resided.  Steve found Tony’s touch familiar, a welcome home and not a reminder of what had been, of those forced to do things to him. Tony honored the trepidation Steve clung to and never pushed or prodded. Most of their touches were chaste and tender. Some were more liberal and daring. But mainly on that sunny afternoon in the Fall of the year, they re-discovered what it meant to be in love.
“Then what?” Steve asks because he just wants to forget, to sleep, to walk backward through time and tease apart the threads of his life that tangled up into knots and weave them right again.
“Yes, sir. I know, sir.” Clint remained frozen. He never stepped further into the light. He never came any closer to Steve.
Clint searched Steve’s face, looked at the dripping wound on this side. “God damn it, Steve, don’t you get it? I lost everything, everything. I did what I had to do. I did what was necessary. You don’t know. You didn’t grow up in the shadows of the vamp wars!”
, and he almost did, but then Strange threw in the last part – about the other person or persons being afflicted as well. He swallowed down the anger, the growing panic, and instead asked, “How did this all happen? When did things change? When did you change the timeline and how come we don’t already know about soul packs?”
“Halt, full stop. Time out,” Steve said. He pushed his way around Tony, and then through the mass of people hanging at the open door into the empty space of the restaurant. There was still shawarma on the table. “You don’t get to come here and baby me. I don’t need babying.”
“Yeah I got that in one. Can we move forward now? What the hell is happening?” Tony asked.
“Funny,” Tony said, and his voice was laced with melancholy. “I wanted to know the same thing.”
The wind gusts and pitches him over, but he recovers and finds his rhythm as he climbs up the slope. Tony’s nowhere in sight, which is either a good thing or a terrible thing – Steve decides to believe in the former. The latter is untenable.
“But what am I now?”
It’s Clint’s turn to roll his eyes as he follows her out of the bedroom. In the distance Steve hears Clint state, “Doesn’t matter much, won’t have any water left once--.”
“Yeah?”
“Am I?” he says it in a sing song manner.
Curiosity piqued, Tony went to Steve’s side and watched as he spread out pages and pages of a file. Most of the text was in Russian, but along the margins someone scribbled translations.
As soon as Steve was able to, he contacted Strange and asked if it would be possible for Wong to come to the Tower. The situation couldn’t be ignored anymore and needed to take front and center stage.
Part of Steve wants to believe the prince. He leans his forehead on Tony’s and cups his face with his hands. “I know, my prince.” He hates lying to Tony. It hurts far too much. What’s worse is that Tony sees it.
“Really? Just this?” Steve said and ran his thumb over Tony’s nipple.
Pepper’s nails dug into his arm. He turned to see what upset her to see the shadow next to the bench move.
“So you know a lot about dreams?” Steve asked as he dug into his breakfast.
Desperate and hot, Tony pushed at Steven until he released him. “On the floor, on the floor.”
Steve peers at him through a swollen eye. “Thought that was obvious.”
“That’s all we’re asking for,” Sam said and smiled.
Tony snickers a little. “Everyone knows what you’re thinking. The blind guy can’t hit my mouth.”
Tony sniffled and tried to catch his breath. He was all of seven years old and already in middle school. His hands shook as he tried to pick up the cookie. “The boys told me about the vampires. How they want to enslave us all. They want humans to be on a cattle ranch but without cattle. The humans will be the cattle.” He trembled and new tears had formed in his eyes. “They said they like to get them young and fatten them up. They put you in stalls and put you in a harness and force feed you until the blood is about to burst out of you.”
Rhodey coughs and says, “I’m getting coffee. You want coffee.” He pushes the chair out and it rolls, dislodging Tony. He catches himself and sits back in his chair.
Glancing around the room, his focus stopped at the man with the ridiculous cape and medallion around his neck. He considered the man and then went back to Fury. “You keep saying that, but all I can figure is that the future kind of went a little off its rocker.”
She snatched her hand away, momentarily startled but then composed herself. “Sorry, I should have known.”
The next few hours in the park present the opportunity for Steve to discover the real hold Stane possesses on the prince. Is it only sentiment or is it something more that Tony’s been hiding all along. That haunted look comes to mind as Steve walks to the expansive windows of the ship. He stares at the nebula. How beautiful and terrible it is all at once. The violence of birthing stars along with the wondrous display of creation. Steve glances over his shoulder at the door to the bedroom. Something beautiful and horrible resides in the prince’s domain.
Who the hell was Wong? Tony had no idea but he agreed nonetheless. “Yeah, we’ll be here,” Tony heard himself say as Clint hugged Natasha. He heard the archer whisper something into Natasha’s ear and she smiled.
“This is not going well,” Pep says after they’ve talked to a dozen candidates. Each pathetic prisoner sickens Tony with an ache that’s hard to even quantify. It isn’t their status but their fate than turns over in his gut and causes the sense of helplessness to overtake him. He doesn’t know why; he’s always accepted the way of biology.
The clang of blade against vibranium rings in the darkness. The gravel under Steve’s booted feet slides away, making it difficult for him to grab purchase enough to get a parry to cause Clint to fall down the slope. He has one option. Leaving his back open he targets low – Clint’s knees. Not allowing reaction time, Steve strikes again and again until the construct cries out from the open gash on his legs and tumbles down the hill. The bag falls off his shoulder – Ultron’s mistake for not writing code to keep it with him. Unfortunately, it lands a good 3 meters from Steve’s position. Steve scrambles to the bag, the gravel a constant moving force beneath him.
Inside the atmosphere is less like a circus and more like a church. Quiet, solemn. It scares Steve but he holds back his reaction as they are guided to the surgical area. Everything after that is a blur. There’s the consent forms and the anesthesiologist discussing the procedure with them as Tony sits on the gurney dressed in scrubs. Steve absently wonders where his clothes were tucked away.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Tony said and needed to escape. Hell, they were having a quiet day, Tony successfully managed to keep his doubts buried deep until Natasha barged in and dug them all up again. He would not accept that his peace, his denial, was exposed. “It’s fine.”
“I have an early start tomorrow. Raincheck?” Steve said and she shrugged.
Tony only nods and sculks away as if being told by a teacher to go sit in a corner. It almost causes Steve to change his mind, but he stops himself. He has to live on Prime after Tony’s gone. It’s bad enough Steve’s managed to piss off Rumlow – who literally works as security on the station – having Tony add to his negative reputation will only incite further problems.
“Bucky, let them help you with the pain,” Steve says but his friend clenches as his collar with a severe expression.
“Yes. As soon as I was able, once my parents died, I found Ana and brought her back. Pepper and Happy helped me nurse her back to health. She doesn’t talk about Jarvis. I don’t ask, but I think she likes to talk to AI JARVIS because he sounds like her Jarvis.” He closes his eyes and quiets. Steve holds him and swishes the water around them.
“Sometimes. I’ve gotten used to some of the conveniences. Like the internet. Streaming. All of it.”
“Think about coffee, Stark,” he mutters and starts downstairs with his mug in hand. The aroma of the coffee, eggs, and bacon mix and cause his stomach to protest in a loud growl as he walks over to the dining nook.
Steve.
“I’m fine, really,” Steve says with a raised hand to ward off Tony’s probing of the lashes. He doesn’t need Tony to figure out they’ll heal at an accelerated rate. All of his wounds will, except for the stumps of his wings. Those will never heal. He’ll either lose the ability to have wings altogether and be caste out or he’ll earn his wings and become one with the legion of Angels.
“Is there a mole?” Steve supplies. “I can’t believe the first, Tony. I’ve read about your exploits, your strategies, the tactics you’ve used. Yes, they’re bold and unconventional, but truly they’ve saved the day so many times.”
Steve clears his throat. “My prince, may I speak with you? Privately.”
“Please, move, please.”
“An omega bonds first. Don’t give me any crap, Rogers. You know it. You have to bond first,” Tony spits back. He’s no longer looking away. His face is close, so close that the glint of his eyes looks like tears. “Why won’t you bond?”
Steve sniffs – realizing now that there are tears staining his cheeks. “No, no. Just want this – this to end. I don’t want us to hurt one another. Anymore. We play around one another all the time. We never-.”
How would she guide him? He smirked – he knew.
“Christ,” he says as he opens the door to Steve’s studio apartment. The room is quickly filling with steam from the shower –which surprises him. Hot water can be a premium here. Steve never closed the door to the bathroom; it stands partially open as he showers. Tony waits for him to finish, but then after allowing ten more minutes to go by he realizes he’s not hearing the normal splash of water in the shower. It’s just a steady stream and nothing else. As if no one is actually in the shower to disturb the fall of water.
Steve only shook his head. He had no idea. The last time he’d touched their marks together, it had been to help Tony heal. Nothing like this at all had happened.
“Bet you love this,” Bucky replies and closes his eyes, his brow furrowed and speckled with perspiration.
“I tell you only what I have seen.”
“I think I’m going to go clean up. I’ll wash the dishes when I get back.”
“Well, the most recent cell I found I think you’ll be interested in,” Fury replied and then nodded to Hill.
He drops down to the stony outcropping overlooking the stream. It’s getting late and there’s still no sign of him. Tony’s talk of leaving may have upset him, but truthfully how much of it would a lion comprehend? He needs to get back to his camp and clean up, getting ready to leave tomorrow. He slowly makes his way through the underbrush and the thick bushes on the path to his tree hollow. He’s tired, and his injuries still ache. His brain doesn’t register what he’s seeing when he looks up. A flash of tan and orange. It hits him.
