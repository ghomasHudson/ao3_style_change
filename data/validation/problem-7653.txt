Enjoy!
“The Bite’s perfect?”  Immediately, Tony wished he could take the words back, undo his tone: uncertain and pleased and surprised.
Natasha looked at the PR gurus with polite interest; Bruce with ill-concealed discomfort; and Clint with an expression oddly like guilt. Steve, of course, gave them his rapt attention, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees.
Tony’s eyes glittered. “I always knew exactly where you were. Why did you think you hadn’t seen me for so long? Everybody else did.”
“Sir? Will you be at this afternoon’s meeting?” Steve asked the Director.
.  Steve peeked at him from under his lashes.  Tony’s lips were parted, he was breathing heavily, and Steve could see the outline of Tony’s cock pressed against his trousers.
“You seemed upset.”
At last: The Conversation.  I had no idea that the end of chapter two would be considered a cliff hanger-- please accept my apologies and chapter 3 by way of recompense.  Thank you for your kind words of (outraged) enthusiasm!  :-)
“I want you to stay right here, like this, for me,” Tony said softly.  “Can you do that for me, baby?”
Steve looked so overwhelmingly
Tony’s head snapped up: Steve looked embarrassed, glancing away as if he hadn’t meant to speak. Tony laughed, not the bitter ugly sound from before, and Steve turned with a tentative smile.
And, yeah, that made Tony feel warm and jealous all at the same time. (Shit. It’s serious.)
Tony set down his welding torch.
Belford smiled, pleased. “I’ll be right back.”
Tony just stared. Bruce wouldn’t meet his eyes and seemed to be breathing a little quick, a little shallow. Tony swallowed.
And lots of dead time to practice a

Steve gave her a grateful smile and finished the last of his tea.
“Forty,” Black Widow answered.
The donut was delicious.  Somehow, that only made him angrier.
“Nothing, uh, hurts where it shouldn’t?” Steve asked.
“Yeah.”
“Ah!”
“You may be in for a long wait,” Tony muttered.
Tony almost wanted to laugh—
He tore it out and began again.
He laid his head on Steve’s chest and lost himself in the movement of their dance.
“Term from Classical rhetoric,” Tony explained, “the art of understatement.”
“Oh.  That’s all you’ve read?” Tony tried to sound interested, but casual.  “So, in your process of—” he fumbled for the right word, “
“Babe, look at me,” Tony said.   With a distant sort of surprise, Steve realized he found it hard to obey—to lift his eyes-- but was glad when he did.  Tony was giving him that soft little smile again.
Steve kissed his forehead.  Then his left cheek, then his right--his hand a warm, steady weight around Tony’s exposed throat.
“Excuse me, Captain?” Tony said briskly, doing his best at a military bearing. “I’m sorry to bother you, but this just came in. It’s probably nothing, but I wanted to bring it to your attention.”
“If you say so, Cap,” Tony said with a smile, patting him on the shoulder. “When it comes to the press, sometimes honesty about the details gets in the way of the truth.” Tony shrugged. “They heard the important part. That’s all that really matters.”
“No,” she said, tone clipped as she stepped away from the bed. Her four-inch stilettos clicked against the linoleum. “You’re obsessing and it isn’t healthy.”
[Image description: Stephen Colbert at his interview desk, looking especially overjoyed.]
JARVIS didn’t answer, just complied.
accuse me of overreacting!”
“Cool.  Great,” Tony said.  “Good talk. I’ll be in the workshop, uh, working until . . . whenever.  You know, if aliens invade.  Or Clint orders Chinese. Or something.”
“Pardon me, Sir. Captain,” JARVIS began. Steve yanked away from Tony, looking embarrassed—as if they’d been walked in on. (Well, in a sense. Hm. Better update JARVIS’s bedroom etiquette for Steve.)

different, but kneeling for most of the Doms he’d fucked had meant basically nothing, far less than the affection of kneeling with Pepper.  But Steve--
(No, this is ridiculous.)  Tony loved seeing Steve on his knees, tied up, at his command.  Didn’t he?  He’d said he did.  (Oh sure, ‘cause Tony always tells the truth… Especially when it’s about what
Steve looked up, eyes a little hopeful, expression softer.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“Though he’s keeping odd hours,” Bruce added, then shrugged, “But that’s Tony after all.”
It was, in fact, an absurdly short drive. (Still worth it.) Steve got out first and held the door to Frank & Jackie’s for the entire team. The décor inside was a little schizophrenic, as if Frank wanted a campy 1950s diner, Jackie wanted an upscale bistro, and
Hope you enjoyed it!  As ever, comments are cherished. (And, yeah, I remain weirdly obsessed with hearing which parts / lines you liked best / hit hardest / etc...)

“The same-- don’t touch my chest,” Tony said automatically. “The arc reactor.” Rebecca nodded.
The adamantium chain rattled and Tony thought he heard something tear. (Impossible.)
“I am sorry,” Rogers repeated, then added with a sigh, “I just really don’t understand you.”
“Hey, Steve?” Tony said, “Could you look a little less like you’re about to face a firing squad?”
Steve was swimming through paradox, frantic but calm, desperate but content. . .   It was like being underwater, but warm not cold.  Floating, floating . . . He felt like he was being held by Tony everywhere at once.
There was a knock on the door and General Fury entered like a great shadow.
Ah, fuck.
. He took the emergency stairs because he couldn’t bear to wait for the elevator.

Tony’s lips twisted up in a wry smile.
“Good.” Steve said it with a certain satisfaction, then added, “Now stay there, just like that.”
Pepper smiled at Tony. “Mild headache aside, I’m glad we got a chance to celebrate last night.”
“Roger that, Rogers,” Tony said with a little salute.
“So,” Steve said, looking up with that shy smile Tony was starting to love, “Every now and then, I’d just say, ‘Tony, may I take you out for an old fashioned date tomorrow?’ and you’d let me know if you’re in the mood?”
Tony’s throat felt a little tight.
“So, if you’re a non-traditional unit,” Colbert asks, “Why the formality talking about your teammates?”
A pause, then she added still smiling, “Though having it’s always a danger at these things; so boring I’m tempted to stab myself.”
“It’s gonna work,” Tony said. “We’re a team now. Really.” Tony bumped his shoulder into Bruce’s and added, “I mean, look at us! We baked cookies together for fuck’s sake!”
(Fuck.). Tony’s stomach flipped again. (I really hurt you.).
“Tony!” she cried, with the beginnings of a relieved smile.
That was his Dom.
“You worry too much.” Pepper said, waving a hand.
Tony if the seat next to him was taken before sitting down, the usual distance apart.  As surreptitiously as he could, Tony watched Rogers watch the movie. Things were back to normal, whatever
“Thanks for the help, Captain Constitution,” Tony snapped. “I’ve got this.”
“Um, sure?”
Steve kissed his temple.
Tony hopped into the elevator, not waiting to see if Rogers wanted a ride to his floor. Tony leaned against the wall, that uneasy feeling lingering under his skin.
“Thirty-five, good Hawk!” Thor yelled back.
Tony turned his face to kiss Steve’s hand.
When Tony woke again, things were beeping and Pepper was sitting at his bedside still (or again). Her lipstick was a muted but somehow cheerful shade of pink, and she had changed into a crisp green sweater. She was doing something on her StarkTab when he opened his eyes.
“Yeah, that’s--”
Tony frowned. He hadn’t really thought about it.
(It was well after five. Steve
“Sure,” Tony said, “if I get to take you out for dinner tomorrow.”
“So,” Tony said, toying with his glass of shiraz once their pleasant chatter about the solarium, the Ahmadis, and the food had died down. (What did you think of my contract?)
“Steve . . . ?”
Tony blinked and picked up his fork.  (I mean, food’s there now… and getting cold.)
are playing together doesn’t mean it’s not impersonal.”
As the others turned back to the house, Steve seemed hesitant to let Tony up.
“Just want my coffee,” Tony said with a yawn. He poured himself a big mug and settled at the counter next to Steve. After a long contented sip, he added more quietly, “At least for now. Apparently you stripped me last night and I wasn’t even awake to enjoy it!”
Tony shrugged, unable to summon any of his former enthusiasm.   “He’s Steve; you’ve met him.”
He worked hard on the e-ink displays. It was good. And, well, if he was a little distracted sometimes there was nobody there (sitting on his couch, drawing quietly, reading a paper book) to notice.
“I’ll be good to you,” Steve said. He ran his hands up and down Tony’s back and pressed a kiss to Tony’s hair. “Gonna be so good to you, sweetheart. Always.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Johnny,” Tony said with a tense smile, trying hard to set aside his anger. “I mean, Agent Ishida.  I didn’t realize you would be at this meeting.”
Tony cried quietly against her stomach while she petted him. He was pretty sure she was crying too, but the steady murmur of praise went on and on and Tony let everything wash over him. He lost track of time.
Tony snorted.  They turned their attention to the menus.  A waiter—stealthy and unobtrusive as a ninja—appeared as soon as they’d decided, took their orders, and vanished.  (The motto of Marseilles seemed to be: our staff should be neither seen nor heard; if you notice them, they’re doing it wrong.)
“Don’t be silly—you look great. Er—” Steve faltered. “I mean, you look perfectly presentable.”
(Huh?  Oh! Right.)
“JARVIS?” Tony called. “Care to explain all this?”
“No,” Tony said, mouth dry. “I asked.”
“Just a
“Oh, yes,” Tony said, “By all means, let’s get on with it.  I know how SHIELD hates wasting people’s time with long, pointless meetings. So I’ll lay out the abridged essentials of our findings, dumbed down to layman’s terms and using small words for you.  Unless, of course, SHIELD would just accept a report—for maximum efficiency?”
“You can bring that with you. Hey, if you draw Dummy on your break again I’ll even give you one of these sandwiches.”
Sorry about the horrible formatting glitch.  I have no idea how that happened, but apparently trying lots of different online RTF-HTML convertors eventually produced one that worked around whatever glitch was in my word file.  Baffled and really frustrated, but at least it's fixed.  Thanks to Michelle for the first very sweet heads up!
“I see,” JARVIS said. “Very well, sir.”
But if Captain America was going to break Agent Dom Dominick’s nose, Tom was damn well gonna see it. (And then deny ever seeing a thing.)
Tony nodded in satisfaction and called up the Mark VII plans.  He had a few hours to make some progress before his date.
“And,” Francesca said softly, “Nona Anna lit a candle for you every Sunday.  Every Sunday without fail, for over forty years.”
Tony blinked. (Did he--?)
“It was always cold in France. In Germany. The cold got into your bones, like it’d stay there always. Even if you made it home.”
“Oh, yeah,” Tony said absently, “‘night, Cap!”
Scattered laugher.
(Oh yeah. Steve.) Tony drank the entire glass of water then dropped it on the floor, frowning.
.  Sometimes I can’t believe he grew up back then and is still real, you know?”

“Sent the prototype off to manufacturing earlier. Come see!”
the pizza; he'd had to remind himself that Rhodey'd been taking care of Tony long before Steve arrived on the scene and didn't need instructions. Still . . . maybe he should just drop by to make sure?
And Rogers always explicitly asked permission—and waited for an answer—before entering.  (Even before the “I think I kinda sexually harassed you and am really really sorry” thing.)
“Sure,” Johnny said, looking bemused as he gave Clint his phone.  Clint cooed a little as he swiped through the pictures.
“Great! Lovely,” Steve said as they stepped into the elevator, he still sounded uncertain.
Pepper’s mouth went tight. “One-hundred and ninety.” She paused then added, “Over half of them SHIELD agents, local law enforcement, first responders, and the National Guard. The rest were bystanders.”
******************************
“Very good, sir. Calculating.”
Tony let out a helpless little noise. He parted his lips, wanting Steve’s tongue in his mouth, hot and demanding, wanting Steve’s body curled over his, taking him and—
.  Talking had never been one of Tony's strengths; he'd never been all that good with words and got frustrated and lost his temper too easily.
“I can’t figure Rogers out,” Tony eventually blurted out, rudely cutting off Pepper’s description the new Klimt exhibit at LACMA.
He beat a hasty retreat.
Cap was digging his heels in. “I won’t apologize for wanting to look out for you,” he said mulishly.
“Really?  I find that hard to believe.  You were at least speeding!”
(Huh.) Tony looked around his kitchen uncertainly. (Where did--?)
“Pepper? Jim? I brought water for you too.”
So, the press conference was super hard to write, but I’m finally willing to accept the results and post so I can move on to the next part of the story.  Hope it works for you!
He swallowed.
“Damn straight!” Tony waved his hands. “That’s it, asshole. You’re cut off. No more gadgets!”
“Aye, my lord.”
“Nice toss, Hulk!” Steve called. He tossed the helmet to Clint who returned it to Hulk who threw it back to Tony.
Steve smiled.  “Of course.”
“Yeah.  I—yeah, I am.”
“Of course, sir.”  A pause.  “Shall I call up the documents Mr. Greenblatt sent for you?”
“Oh!”  Steve shook his head, looking embarrassed. “I didn’t mean--  I mean, I understand.  Of course,”  he hesitated a moment and gave Tony his shy smile, head tilted to the side, “I just . . . I know you don’t keep regular hours and I understand, but I was hoping that when you
----------------------------
Tony approached Steve uncertainly.
Tony sighed and ran his fingers through his hair.
“Uh . . .”
“Honestly, when you said we could watch that episode again, I didn’t expect you’d have time for quite a while,” Steve said with a smile. “I’m glad you can take the time. You work so hard.”
“Yep!”
; it couldn’t possibly take an hour. He wouldn’t let it.)
“Mmm-hmm.  Irreverent wit—it’s part of my charm.  So, move it!”
“Dr. Banner,” Fury said with a polite nod to Bruce.  “I didn’t realize you and Stark were planning to leave.”
“On your knees, Tony,” Steve said, almost babbling, “Kneel for me.  Kneel, Tony. I want . . . I want--”
“Having fun?” Pepper asked, her smile a little bemused and rapidly trending towards a frown as she looked at him.
Steve nodded.
“Mr. Stark!”
.  I’m trying.)  Pepper was looking more and more worried.  (Really, Steve’s so brave and honest and just
“Right,” Tony said.  “So, Bruce and I are gonna take our not quite enough data home to play with it.  JARVIS transmitted everything to the Tower already.”
Tony tried not to hold his breath as he waited for Steve’s answer.
Tony walked out of the armor, glad the landing pad in Malibu was still up and running. It wasn’t the same, showing up in a workshop without the bots to greet him, but there were pentalobe screwdrivers, soldering irons, and take one of the new e-ink display. Those were good company. And he’d see Pepper soon too. It would be good.
Seeing Beyond: the Life and Work of Samuel Freedman
“Oh hello, Steve,” she said with a smile that looked a little uncertain (or is he imagining that?).  “Looking for Tony?  It isn’t an emergency is it?”
Tony wasn’t sure if it was polite to press, but he did it anyway, keeping his voice soft, “When you first talked about her, I thought the two of you were together, but then you never brought her around or said anything about her, and I hated to ask . . . Did you break up?”
She said it softly, but without apology.
“Wow.”
Pepper huffed. “If you call Michael at the last minute again, he’s gonna flip.”
Tony stepped away to drape himself off the edge of the bed, then spread his knees wide and pointed to the space between them at his feet.  It was only a few steps, hardly worth standing up, so Steve crawled on his hands and knees.  Tony gasped.
Tony's chest felt a little tight.
And Tony needed to give Steve a contract—preferably well before their date. (Like, with enough time in advance that Steve could read and digest it and make his own plans . . .) And Bruce wanted Tony to come for lunch and stop by his lab to look at something. And he had training with Clint. And he needed to actually plan a date!
“Uh . . .” Tony oiled Dummy’s right front wheel.
“Uh, yes?”
(See the end of the chapter for
something like a touch screen before . . . I kept bumping “a” when I meant “b” or “c” when I meant “d” and then spent so long trying to undo it, the whole test, quote
“Tony, where’s your helmet?”  he asked, sounding put out.
Tony swallowed as Steve looked at him with wide blue eyes full of concern.
“Prince Anthony,” he said in a clear warm voice. “Welcome to Brookline Castle.”
Fury just stared back unmoved and silent.
Tony sighed a little.  (Okay.  Getting pretty tedious here.)
“You’re not injured? Or sick? Or leaving on an insanely dangerous mission from which you’re not expected to return?”
“Hey, Bruce,” Tony said, abruptly. “Could I use your tablet for a second?”
Time for a change of scenery.  He had a date to plan!
“Hmm?” Tony hit ‘save.’ “No. Finished those. If those fuckers come back, we’ll be ready to shut the portal in a matter of minutes. By remote control. No, this is the suit.”
Tony found the chicken well demolished, but he still managed to pick off a little more meat.  He nibbled on it cold, standing up in the kitchen.  (Oh, fuck that was good.)  By the time he was done, the carcass was pretty thoroughly stripped and Tony considered throwing it out for a moment.  Knowing Rogers’ sense of economy, though, he was probably saving it.  To make stock with it.  Or cook with the marrow.  Or something.  (Did people do that?)
“Yeah,” Tony said, smiling back.
Something scratchy hit Tony square in the forehead. (Huh?) It happened again. He struggled to drag his eyes open. (Shit. Fucking meds… too slow. Fuck!) Tony flailed upright and blinked as another paper ball whapped his forehead.
“Wanna take it up to the gym and put it through its paces? I could—“
Tony started moving his fingers again, in and out, mumbling soft filthy praise for Steve’s eager little hole, the words and caresses sending little sparks of joy through Steve’s body.  He lost track of time.
“Yeah, amazing stuff! It works for the planar Ising model too.”
“Stark.  We need you to come in.”
“Mr. Stark.  Dr. Banner,” Rogers said, with a nod and a glance at their bags, “Are you heading out?”
He stepped closer and stroked his thumb across Tony’s throat.
, two, three.”
“You’re so good,” Steve said softy, padding back into the bathroom, “so beautiful, kneeling for me like that.”
"No thank you, Captain," she said, her tone cold but scrupulously polite. "I'll take it from here." A slight pause. "Thank you."
**********************************************
with me.”
Steve’s elbows were slightly bent, his wrists clipped low on the headboard.  He gave a tiny, experimental tug, then went still.  (Is that okay?)  He looked at Tony uncertainly.
As Tony studied the projected statistics, he grunted with disapproval.  SHIELD had only upped Kevlar’s para-aramid ratio from 5:1 to 5.7:1.  Pathetic.  Who the hell did they have on R&D?  Tony rolled his eyes and caught sight of the BLT at the end of his table.
“You’re, uh—“ (It’s like there are Beams of Earnestness shooting from Steve’s bright blue eyes, like Superman, only--) Tony lost his train of thought for a second. “Uh, you’re welcome?”
Rhodey was still giving him a skeptical, worried look as he made his way hesitantly to the elevator.
(Yes, please, please . . . )
“You know,” Rogers said, frowning and hesitant, “I wasn’t always ‘a big strong Dom.’ ” He gestured up and down his body, then said more softly, “I know what it’s like to get backed into a corner.” He frowned as he added, voice firm, “And I don’t like bullies.”
Finally, Steve heard Tony approach and set things down behind him, but he didn’t turn around, didn’t so much as twitch, just waited eagerly for Tony to touch him, to do something.  Tony remained still and silent, out of sight, but Steve was certain he could feel Tony’s gaze, hot and heavy on his back, his bound wrists, his ass.  He took a breath and waited.  How long had it been already?  Tony still didn’t move.  Was it some sort of test?  Was he seeing how long Steve would keep still?
“And you.” Harry lingered. “Perhaps we could chat again sometime--?”
(Shit! Overkill!)
Rogers looked shocked by the grandfather; Rhodey looked delighted by the teenager.
vibe.)
(Here we go.)
“Absolutely not,” Tony cut in. “It’s too cold. Also, I have drivers on staff. What’s the point if they don’t get to drive us? Francis might feel rejected!”
Steve looked skeptical. He toyed with his pencil.
A little check mark appeared to tell him Tony’d read his message. He waited, but no little dots followed to tell him Tony was answering.
“Yeah,” Tony agreed, high and breathy. “But--” Tony laid a hand lightly on Steve’s chest and let his thigh brush against Steve’s as he murmured “—I’m asking which might please you most. The Benz? The Audi? The Lotus?”
“So, like I said,” Rhodey opened, “Pepper mentioned that you’re dating someone new.”
“Are you really telling me I can’t leave,” Bruce asked Fury, so calmly it was terrifying—a whole new spin on ‘calm before the storm.’  Tony glanced around at the Agents, some of whom
“Hell, man, that’s not far! Have Miranda tell you if she gets a little time free. Like, once Jen’s cried herself to sleep, you could swing by in War Machine!”
at the gala was developing a new product “for electronics” that might interest Stark Industries and their head of R&D . . .)
“Well, that’s all fine for Nat. You gave me sleeves!” Clint bitched without venom. “I told you bare arms!”
“Un-fucking-believable,” Tony muttered.
there was a protocol. Tony was tempted to tell him how bad it had been—that Rhodey and Pepper had worried he’d walk off the ledge one day without his suit. They’d begged him to modify JARVIS and eventually he relented, though he was certain they were wrong to worry. Even at his worst, he’d been too angry about dying to check out early on purpose; he did it for them anyway.

And then Steve actually knelt to unbutton Tony’s trousers.
Tony winced and, hating his own embarrassment, went on the offensive, snapping: “Just, knock it off, ok? He’s Captain America. Show some fucking respect.”
“Yeah, got it!” Tony said a little too brightly.  “Good, great! Team! Bonding!  Awesome.  Will zip it on the cynical stuff and innuendo.”  Tony swallowed. “But uh, if that’s enough feelings for you, then how about we go back to the good kind of bonding.  Ya know: you, me, science, and machines?  ‘Cause I think I see a pattern in the fourth grid.”
Rebecca Martinez was an art historian, codicologist, and paleographer, so she and Steve had an animated conversation about art and curation (as Tony’d hoped).  Sam and Tony talked about the Foundation & Safe House. (Tony hoped to get him on the board of directors) And he and Pepper both enjoyed talking tech and business with the Macmillians, especially Sylvia, unexpected (submissive!) heir to Tyrone’s empire.  It was a good mix and everyone was very cordial. Tony was inclined to pat himself and Pepper on the back for such a well assembled table. (And Katie and Mikie had remembered to put red roses, yellow roses, and white lilies in their centerpiece as he’d requested.)

stopped Winter Soldier from taking your Omega.
“Pepper, you will do this, and you will not object to any pose that Adam decides on.”
There are some days when l fight against my lack of choice and of not being allowed to work or go out.  But Happy shows me the error of my ways and disciplines me accordingly.  Natasha has told me that once the babies are born there is work at Stark Industries for me to do and Happy says my brother wants me to entertain some prospective clients, so I wont just be popping out brats.”
“There we go baby, momma has you.  Steve look at her, she is so beautiful, I can’t believe we made her.
“Look at you, such a little pain slut!  Could beat your ass black and blue all day and you would still be begging for more, such a dirty little meg, tits hard and leaking, cunt and asshole dripping.
Steve knew Tony was going to hate what was about to happen even more than the boardroom, but his cock was already hard at the thought of his omega suckling on his cock in full view of the other Avengers, dependant on his Alpha’s release for his nourishment.  It would also serve to show Tony he really was the lowest member of the pack and that when in their company he had to wait until everyone else had eaten before he could have sustenance.
You lack the social and mental skills to converse and interact with other adults on a daily basis in a manner that is socially acceptable to the majority of society, you have never had any boundaries set for your behaviour so regularly create situations where you fail to see the disruption and upset that your actions cause.
Pushing his cum coated fingers into Tony’s mouth, he continued thrusting up with his cock watching him begin to choke as his fingers hit the back of his throat with each thrust.  Keeping his fingers hooked in his mouth he slid him off his lap to land on the floor between his spread thighs, releasing his cock he fed it down Tony’s throat until his balls rested against his  boy's chin.
Steve’s whispered words were interspersed with strokes to his cock and fleeting kisses to the back of his neck and shoulders. No one had ever told him he was beautiful before, he felt a curl of warmth in his chest on hearing his Alpha’s approval of his appearance. Howard’s condemnation of omegas still echoed in is head, but maybe his father was wrong in his thinking, after all Steve Rogers would never lie, his morals were beyond reproach that was why Erskine had chosen him ‘a good man’ and becoming Captain America had only amplified them.
Steve smirked as he became more frantic, he could see the moment his sweet baby boy, aged up, and became his Tony.
Thor greeted the President, then led Loki over to the breeding bench, making quick work o securing his bitch to the specially adapted bench for pregnant omegas.
But then l met you and even though we got off to a bad start l knew within months that you were the one.  I got my head out of my ass and sought help.  I wanted to take things slow and court you but now l just want us to be together as a bonded pair.
The wedding was held at Mountain Rise so that Anthony Stark Rogers could attend and not have his rehabilitation therapy interrupted.  Mr Stark Rogers has been suffering from mental health problems for many years and although he had tried many different therapies it was deemed after his last breakdown that he be admitted to Mountain Rise and placed under the conservatorship of his husband Captain Rogers.  He will continue to work for Stark Industries R&D department on a consultancy basis but will no longer take an active part in running the Company.
Winter fitted Tony’s cock cage on his still swollen cock, smirking as the omega whimpered in pain as his cock was squashed and pinched tight within the cage. After fitting anal and pussy plugs he sent Tony off to the nursery to see to the pups whilst he did a security sweep of the top floors of the tower.
“No Tony! I want you to just lay still for me, no trying to move unless I tell you too.  Once your cunt is full you are going to keep my cock nice and warm whilst I massage your tits, you are going to need large full udders in order to  provide enough milk for three hungry super soldier pups.”
But maybe it was meant to happen like this who else but Captain America would be able to keep an uppity, know it all cock slut whore of an omega satisfied and in its place.”
The videos played for hours as Pepper begged and pleaded to be the one to perform and receive his praise.
5.	Always obey your Alpha.
Steve stood Tony in front of him, taking  his time stripping off his wet jeans and then the soaked pull-up. The too big t-shirt hung off his shoulder, his tiny cock head peeking out below the hem.
He stood, stretching his arms above his head to loosen his tight shoulders, there was a brief flash of light and the crack running down the center of the mirror disappeared.
Tony is punished by his Alpha but also gets sent deep into his head space.  Steve is not happy with Tony's parents or Obadiah.
Peter groaned as he slowly regained consciousness, his head throbbed with pain and everything was blurry when he finally opened his eyes. He shivered and flinched when he felt a hand brush over his stomach and then trail round to his behind, it was then that he felt the unpleasant sensation of fullness in his stomach and the intrusion in his backside.
David jerked on her leash, pulling her towards their SUV.
Pain lanced through his cheek as his face hit the glass, but it was nothing compared to the full force of Steve’s barbs as they ripped open his flesh, up until now Steve had only engaged them twice, aware that his slightly different biology meant they caused to much damage and took days to heal sufficiently for him to be able to fuck his omega again.
Covering the omega’s back, he mouthed the flushed skin surrounding the swollen omega gland, his enhanced senses could hear the frantic beating of Tony’s heart, taste the sour scent of distressed omega pheromones mixing with the beginnings of the sweet scent of arousal, omegas would always be a slave to an Alpha’s cock in the end.  The moment he felt the barbs on his cock latch on as his cock began to pulse, he bit down, sinking his teeth deep into the bonding gland.  Sweet nectar filled his mouth and he greedily sucked in the secretions, his canines releasing his own Alpha secretions to seep into the torn gland and seal the bond.  Locked in place he could feel his cock pulsing and cum flooding Tony’s channel, retracting his canines he lathed the torn skin, until the wound stopped bleeding, the healing factor in his saliva would ensure that by the morning the bonding bite would be sealed and the scaring would be minimal.
Each member of the team had afterwards tried to see or speak to Tony but he refused still to hurt and upset any trust he had given them broken by their actions.  Even two years later he was still not ready to speak to them.
This is all Pepper, not sure why I dislike her and want her to suffer in my stories
I can see from your face that you do not believe that you are an omega, you need to  have your eyes opened to the truth you have buried.
Bruce handed over Peter’s leash and left without looking back, now he could concentrate on his collaboration with the healers, Odin and not just Thor wanted a solution and time was running out, Thanos was weeks away from earth.
Chapter 10
When the vet arrived, he did another internal and declared her fully dilated.
The End.
Darcy hadn’t felt right all night, everything ached, the pain in her back had increased and her stomach felt heavier.  Unfortunately, she had no way of communicating her discomfort, there was a reason the barns were so quiet.
Tony was shocked by how long Loki’s clit was now, it was at least 5 inches, the tip hard and thicker than the length.
Two months after separation he was at peak health, both in body and mind.  His clarity of thought still amazing even now, no more rumbling and angry words in his head.  He was thankful also that physically he was on par with these Avengers, although not The Captain, as he was expected to spar and train with them, even though he was only going to be a reserve member.
Chapter 28
Sir Thomas sneered down at his wife, grabbing hold of her chin, forcing her to look up at him.
Tony suffered through the rest of the photoshoot, eyes never looking at the crew, he could hear the whispered comments and lewd jokes, it upset him that Steve did not put a stop to it but seemed to find amusement in the cruel comments.
“Now tonight is very important for Steve and the Avengers and you need look the perfect femme omega. First l need to fit your chastity belt, the plugs will vibrate all night but you are not allowed to show any reaction, it’s tight and you will not be able to sit comfortably but you will smile and look pretty next to your Alpha. These nipple clamps will bite your nubs but hold back any milk, we don’t want you leaking through your dress.”
“Please don’t hurt him, please, please let him go, I am so stupid to have forgotten Mr President’s invitation.  Sam only came to pick me up as my car is in the garage, he didn’t know that I was supposed to have supper with the President.”
"Please, please St-Steve please, need to suck your cock!”
“Clint that’s enough, tomorrow night is a surprise for Tony Pup, no need to be teasing him.
Leaving him naked he fitted a thick leather collar with a chin rest securely round his throat which would keep his head tilted back when attached by a chain to his wrist cuffs Next, he picked up an O ring mouth gag pressed it into Tony’s mouth securing it to the rings on his collar.  Attaching his leash, he motioned Tony to his hands and knees and led him to the kitchen.
“Come on Natty , did you really think he would care, he has been here for months and even has his own omega, him and the Professor work closely together and the Hulk is gone, nothing but a test tube of DNA left.
Pepper approached Tony being careful not to touch him or step in the mess on the floor.
Steve’s inner Alpha was not happy that the doctor was handling his omega’s genitalia, unfortunately with the Inspector viewing the proceedings he couldn’t give into the urge to shove the doctor away, bundle up his omega and rush him back to the privacy of the tower.
“Now I think we will start with the shake, I am going to pour it into your mouth and all you need to do is swallow until it is all gone, but I am warning you that if you spill any because you are not drinking fast enough we will start again with a full glass!”
Winter desperately tried to will himself out of existence or shut his mind down, but Armless would not allow it, he forced Winter to see and feel everything, Armless brutally mounting and breeding every cow, draining their breasts of milk to feed his ever growing addiction. Winter finally broke after years of torture and began to fully merge with Armless.
“There we go sweetie, much more comfortable for you now, more room for all these lovely new snacks. “
Tony quickly complied, stripping quickly out of the linen pants and top that he had only just dressed in whilst Steve had been preparing for the mission. Clasping his hands behind his back he widened his stance presenting himself for the Winter’s inspection.
Plus, Steve took great pleasure in fucking Tony when his belly was heavy with pups, the sight of his full tits and those thick long nipples drove him to distraction, he wanted to suck on those teats whenever he wanted and always be able to taste that sweet honey milk.
I have watched you bath a prepare yourself for me, without needing any prompting, smother your skin in cream to keep it soft and pale for me.  I have only given you a minimal number of orders, the rest have been mere suggestions or idle thoughts spoken out loud.  In fact, even with BB, the list and the time scale were not my orders, those are the processes all farm milk cows have to go through.
“Tony would you like me to wash you, l don’t mind at all, you deserve to be pampered, l do so enjoy taking care of you and you can always reward me for it later.”
Right, good head of hair thick and glossy, eyes bright and clear eye lashes any woman would kill for, skin clear of any blemishes.  I can see that his facial hair is thinning will not be long before it disappears completely just as his body hair has done.
“Alpha come inside your omega is waiting, he wants to welcome you home and is hungry for your cum. You need to fuck him hard to get the scent of Winter off him and to show him you are our Alpha.  I can feel the Soldier retreating, if you would allow me to bond in some way with your omega I believe he would be fully defeated, unable to fight the control of a forming triad bond.”
Finally, he managed to turn the handle and tug the door open just enough to squeeze through, heart thudding he wobbled along the corridor having to keep one hand on the wall for balance whilst using his other to keep Steve’s t-shirt from slipping off his shoulders.  The corridor seemed to go on for ever and his legs were getting more and more tired, he was also aware that the urge to pee was getting stronger.  Finally, he reached the double doors at the end of the corridor but try as he might he couldn’t push them open, tears of frustration rolled down his cheeks as he futilely slapped the heavy doors with his hands.
Steve standing behind him, his large hands stroking his shoulders and stomach, towered over him, he could feel the hard length of his cock pressing against his back, and wasn’t that scary to think of him shoving that up his ass. The top of his head didn’t even reach Steve’s shoulders now, he had always been short but now the difference in their sizes was shocking.
As Steve helped Tony to his feet, his omega drawers slid down, embarrassed he tried to make a grab for them but Steve’s hand covered his.
Tony howls as his insides are stuffed full, the cold metal fist punching in repeatedly, hitting his prostrate every time, driving him insane with the need to come.  It’s not going to happen though, he can only come when his is knotted now.
Steve shook his head, but Winter was curious as to the extent the regrowth of bone in their omega’s limbs.
“Think yourself luck whore that I was not given permission to shave it all off or to permanently remove it as I wanted.
Steve could sense through the bond a broad outline of what Tony was feeling.  As it was mostly all true he could not offer any comfort to his omega, it would be false and a lie.  He would however ensure that he would not crush his omega’s creativeness and drive to help others as Iron Man and to atone for his past as the Merchant of Death.
“ There we go, such an obedient slut, there is no way you are our Tony, he would never just do as he was told, the little shit would have kept on fighting and defying every order being the stubborn bastard he is. Now come!”
Bucky lowered his head so his hair covered his face and place a shaking hand upon Steve’s arm managing to crock out between wheezy breaths;
“Please Alpha, I don’t know how much longer I can hold off the Soldier, I am begging you to complete the bond.”
Chapter 23
It was strange to see Happy slide into the bench seat across from them, after all the years of him driving and even his suit was of a much higher quality than the ones he normally wore when he was his chauffer.  What shocked him the most was who was on the end of the leash in his hand, and the extreme contrast to the elegant figure Natasha cut.
Steve held Tony’s wrist up for each of the Avengers to scent mark once they had fed him a piece of cake, smiling at Tony’s offended huff when Clint deliberately fed him a tiny crumb of cake, whilst shoving the rest of the slice into his mouth.
I will finalise the details with you after speaking with Miss Potts and the Stark Industry lawyers, until then his sperm will be frozen.
Chapter 28
Now he needed to get free of the cuff and find Steve and let him know what that he was their Tony.  He would deal with everything else afterwards, he just wanted to get back to his reality, he’s mind was clearing the longer he was away from his Alpha and he could see that what had been done to him was completely barbaric and morally corrupt, he was an unwilling victim and had not stood a chance from the start, no matter that his body had responded and his mind after much coercion agreed to the mating.
Unlike normal human pregnancies omegas carry for only 6 months this means that they can be bred twice a year if their Alpha wishes as they have a mini heat a few days after the birth and are immediately fertile.
“Steve why don’t you go make use of your beautiful omega, Tony will have finished with his shower and feeding Sarah.  Don’t waste that hard on, maybe we can work on you coming untouched for me, it would give me great pleasure.  Now go fuck your omega, show your bitch that you own her.
Tony is a bundle of nerves as he sits beside Steve in the limo, they are going to pick Natasha, Happy and Pepper up from the airport and then go on to the Maria Stark Gala.  He hasn’t seen Pepper since the wedding four months ago, Natasha says she is busy with entertaining prospective customers and is tired from her pregnancy.  Happy stops by on occasion to speak with Steve and always brings him candy, which he loves, and daddy turns a blind eye too. Thor, Bruce and Clint will meet up with them at the Gala.
Still when Captain America speaks he is always right, isn't he?
He could already see the frown developing on Steve’s face the disappointment in his eyes at his loss of control turning into an angry glare.  There was going to be hell to pay for showing up his Alpha in front of the board members.  He shivered as another wave of arousal pulsed through him his whole body felt as though it was vibrating in time with the butt plug. His cock and balls throbbed with pain confined tightly in their metal prison.
Tony worked quietly on Barnes’s arm ensuring that he made no sudden movements, whenever he needed a different tool he would point to the one he needed then hand over the previously used tool.  These were makeshift repairs that would keep the arm in operation until he could build a new one, the designs already formulating in his mind.  Closing the last small service flap, he looked at the silent Alpha being careful not to look directly in his eyes, his throbbing butt reminding him of that lesson learnt the hard way.
Tony sat docilely allowing Steve to feed him each spoonful of apple sauce, he balked at the lidded sippy cup filled with water but a stern look from Steve had him drinking from the spout whenever it was held up to his lips.  When he tried to say he was full Nurse Meyer just tutted and told him that everything on the tray needed to be eaten and drunk as part of his new diet requirements.  Finally, it was over, with his hands now untied from behind his back he slumped back against his pillows cringing at the loud crinkling sound of the disposable diaper under his pyjamas and curled up on his side.
Steve placed a comforting arm round Pepper’s shoulders as she managed to squeeze a solitary tear from her eye, it would not do for the Judge to think she was a complete cold hearted bitch.  She jabbed Steve’s foot with her dagger like stiletto heel to remind him it was his turn take the stage.
back the weight he lost from being ill and that he was feeling healthier and stronger.
Later that night he smiled with satisfaction as Darcy crawled into her crate, nipples weeping milk and blood, by the following evening they would be healed, omega biology always healed their nipples quickly, protecting the food source for their pups.
If at any time you become desperate and cannot wait, you must inform me, but I will only allow a certain amount of leeway at the beginning of this training.  If you are feeling ill you must come and inform me straight away and I will remove your plug and sound for the period of illness, but if you abuse this by pretending sickness you will be punished.”
When Tony excused himself to use the bathroom, turning down four offers to ‘escort him’, he took his opportunity to blend back into the crowd.
Tony nodded. Rebecca’s words made him feel warm, both with embarrassment and with pleasure. “Yeah. All right,” Tony said, glancing away. “I promise.”
As Bruce and Steve chattered about food, and everyone served their plates, Tony couldn’t quite shake the feeling that everything maybe wasn’t quite fine after all.
It was nice. Sometimes Tony’d look up from his work, lost in thought, and would find himself staring at Steve: the way his brow furrowed very slightly when he was concentrating on his reading; the way his blue eyes caught the light of Tony’s schematics; the way his tongue would dart out from time to time to cross his lower lip; the way he’d move his head very slightly to the beat of the Duke Ellington Tony’d put on for him. And if Steve caught him looking, Tony’d just smile and Steve’d smile back.
Thank you, everyone, for your kindness and support.  I hope this story can be a comfort in dark times.
There was a long pause.
Tony’d heard Margaret Macmillan was Tyrone’s right hand, and had been since he married her late in life; surely he hadn’t--
“I know that, but it’s no reason not to—”
Tony snorted, amused despite himself.
Tony came up with theories about Rogers, one after another, then discarded them all.  They could never accommodate all the available data points.
"You told me to get out," Steve answered.
“A bet about Tony.”
“They’re still not sure,” Pepper hedged. Her hands went tight—it was one of her only tells.
Steve’s face was very near, his blue eyes full of warmth as he whispered: “Good morning, my love”
Tony yawned. “Thanks, J.”
Tony glanced over and found Clint giving them a strange look. Tony raised his eyebrow and Clint looked away abruptly.
“Mmm-hmm.”
“So, Cap, how’d you like your first flight?”
Or rather, decidedly un-fucked. Steve's '
The long version: blather on my blog: http://ms-meredith-milton.tumblr.com/post/155929617441/the-state-of-the-meredith
“Oh! I thought I was just taking you out to dinner because we’re friends and I’m terribly fond of you. Good to know that my motives are more altruistic.”
”  (High out of his mind, on endorphins and coke.) Tony’d fallen asleep almost immediately.
What the fuck had happened?  Had he really been so lost in it that he’d missed Steve’s cues so badly?  Steve had seemed fine at the earlier check ins—how long had it been since the last one?  Or, the last one Steve had seemed really coherent for?  He’d gone non-verbal at some point. Tony wasn’t sure.

“Just knock it off, would you?” Tony growled. “Just fucking stop it!”
interesting.  I’ve done a bit of reading.  And if you don’t mind going slowly, sometimes I think I could get at least part of it.”
Rogers held out the plate again and this time Tony took it. No eggs, he noticed.
First off, the book made it very clear how carefully Tony had to watch Steve.

. What’s the point of a first response team if their leader isn’t even ready?”
(Stupid.  Selfish.)
Tony was just emerging from his bathroom, bare-footed and bare-chested, fitted gray trousers slung low on his hips.  The arc reactor glowed in his chest, rising and falling with his breathing, the scars around it clearly visible in the bright light.  Tony’s hair was still wet and dripping from his shower.  They stood frozen-- staring at one another—then sprang into action.
“Dummy, if you were useful,” Tony grumbled, “you could go up there and fetch it for me.”
“Ooh, yes,” Bruce said, amused. “I agree.”
“May I come in?”
“Right.”  Tony stalled by taking another sip of scotch.  “So, what did Pep tell you?”
“How have you been?” Steve asked.
Bruce looked at him pleased, but startled. “Yeah?” he said, a little puzzled. “You too.”
“Yeah.”  Tony’s voice was a little rough.  He toyed with his empty glass and he should probably stop talking, but the words were spilling out anyway.  “I mean, it’s still hard on him, you know?  He’s okay in the Tower—it feels safe, I guess.  But in public it’s still . . . tough.  And he hates that, I can tell—he beats himself up for it every time he’s shy, but he’s trying and he’s so good to me.  And just—”  Tony waved his hand for emphasis. “--
“Yes, that’s right,” he said.
Steve was still talking, voice gentle and Tony really wanted to be angry about that, but his head was spinning a little and it made it hard to focus. “This is different. Can't you see that? I didn't give you a hard time when you had to fix those phones for Stark Industries, did I? But look at this, Tony.” Steve waved his hand around the workshop. Tony blinked. His vision swam for a moment.
“How long on the National Guard?” Cap asked as they headed back to the main perimeter.
“Hello beloved, it is wonderful to see them all together, Loki will be with you shortly, he is just finishing feeding the tiny ones.”
“F-fuck….. fuck that’s it going to fill your belly now!”
Not wanting to make a scene as he could already see people watching, he took a few sips of the cocktail, trying to ignore the press of Bucky’s erection and his warm breath on his cheek as he encouraged him to finish the first cocktail. Another one appeared, then he lost track of how many he drank, to busy grinding down on Bucky’s cock.
Tony breathed in the heady scent of his Alpha’s musk, nuzzling the semi hard cock through the material of Steve’s uniform trousers whining softly as he felt the heat begin to pool in his belly and the need for his Alpha’s cum starting to build.  Losing himself to his arousal he was shocked back to the present when he was jostled by the Avengers exiting the car.
“Omega, you will hold onto it for another 5 minutes, you need to be thoroughly cleansed.  Sir wants you empty and your passages need to be coated with a healing salve.”
,” Tony sneered.  “Let me guess, you’re still single ‘cause subs only like assholes?”  Tony snorted.  “Bored already.  Bye!”
Tony nodded. “The power of anonymity,” he said with a wry smile. “And distance. Most of them would never say things like that in person or with their real name. Never in a million years.”
“Steve, what’s—”  Tony snapped his mouth shut, not finishing his question as Steve hid his face against Tony’s shoulder, covering it with tears.  (Stupid.  Obviously he can’t tell you what’s wrong right now.)
The guards pulled open the doors and Sir James announced in a resounding voice: “Prince Anthony Stark of Italia!”
“Take care, Steve.”  The doors shut behind her.
“Okay, good. Good! We’re brainstorming! You’re right,” Bruce said, voice frantic, “So, it has to be an injection—direct into the—“
“Hi.”
“Yeah. I don't think Rhodey's been this seriously hurt since Tony gave him War Machine. I think it gave Tony a pretty bad scare.”
“Sir? Captain Rogers asks if sushi would be acceptable for this evening.”
(Huh.  Okay…)
The upside of having
“You left pretty abruptly.”

Steve wanted Tony so badly it was almost pain.  He couldn’t explain it—it didn’t make sense. (Fuck me, Tony . . . please . . . wanna feel you inside me. . .)  Steve’s chest felt tight and he was grateful Tony had ordered him to breathe. (Not enough . . . need your cock . . .)  He rocked back on Tony’s finger as much as he could without moving his knees from his chest or pulling his restraints from the headboard.  (Keep your hands there . . . Tony put them there . . .)  Steve arched and cried out as Tony crooked his finger inside him again.  (Oh, fuck me!  Take me . . . claim me. . .  make me yours . . . please . . . please, Tony)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“No! Nope. Nuh-uh.” Tony waved at the diagrams. “Bad idea! We already have a plan!”
“Beautiful stitching. Did you use a baste-stitch to start?”
No answer.  Tony shifted a little and looked down at Steve.  His eyes were shut, lashes damp against his cheeks, his mouth parted, face lax—he’d cried himself to sleep.
Tony laughed, then added wryly, “And I’m pretty sure Captain America wanted to throw him off the balcony.”
“Shit!  Not gonna last,” he panted. “You’re so good, baby.”
Tony growled.  He’d made the right call and yet somehow he’d still fucked it up.
Tony leaned up to give Steve another kiss.
Tony smirked. “Careful, Cap, you may start catching flies.”
Bruce kept perusing the Journal as Steve stood stunned before him. Now that he had got over his initial rage, it was fascinating if somewhat gruesome reading.
Tony stared in to the camera lens, slowly licking his slick soaked fingers as he spoke.  Squeezing his nipples, he allowed the droplets of milk to roll down his breasts before massaging it in to his skin. Occasionally he would run his hand down over his swollen belly to hover over his caged cock, never quite touching it he looked in to the lens smirking;
Steve looked down at his omega’s straining cock, it small head leaking drops of pre cum, swiping up the drops with his fingers he placed them against Tony’s lips pushing until Tony had no choice but to open up and suck them clean.
Humiliatingly he came twice more before Sir stopped and sat him on his lap, legs splayed over his thighs, he could feel Sir’s hard cock nudging his hole and wanted nothing more than to grind down on it but knew he couldn’t without permission.
“Please Alpha remove it, please!”
There was no way he was going to let that happen even though he could feel the alterations in his body chemistry happening already, melding his and Steve’s scents, hardwiring his mind and body to respond to anything that Steve wanted, to make his first priority serving his Alpha.  He would have no freedom to do what wanted unless Steve gave his permission.
Cap turned to the team. “The energy signature’s back—it’s hovering over Central Park. Everybody, suit up!”
gone a lot lately so I wanted to check in and
Steve set the book aside, fumbling a little in his haste, and it fell to the floor with a dull thud.  Steve leapt from his seat and began to pace.
“Who could say, really?” Bruce said, then shook his head. “I have a feeling you’ll hate it.”
Steve nodded. “Very much so.”
—but then there was another strong hand on Tony’s shoulder. His cheek squashed up against a firm chest.
“Tony?”
. . . .
Tony’d been more pissed by the chair pulling than the repeated dinner invitations—obviously, since one produced yelling and the other he’d shrugged off. Besides, Rogers took rejection politely and didn’t actually press in the moment, unlike that dick Harris. And, sure—Tony’d wondered (okay, fine:
“Relax, Cap, and sit down, would ya? I didn’t come down here to yell at you, okay?”
“So,” Pepper said.  “How have things been?  At the Tower?”
Tony laughed and gestured to the elevator. “Shall we?”
(Maybe Hypothetical 66? It had supposed the lowest radiation ratios . . . )
“Me!?!”
Tony glared at the schematics and sketches spread before him. Wasn’t like him to be so indecisive, but--
Tony hurried for the elevator, swiping his phone open as he walked just to check.
And I'm happy to report, I'm now on a little trip visiting my perfect, wonderful, amazing beta and she's taking fabulous care of me! And this means more P&P drafting and brainstorming while I'm visiting!  YAY!  I'll get to answering comments soonish, but in the meantime just, like, THANK YOU!
And when his ridiculous craving for a hot dog got too intense to be ignored, he called Happy; they went to Big Doggy and ate foot longs on the pier, talking about nothing much (after Hap yelled at him for the whole unannounced visit thing). Happy gave him three crushing hugs before dropping him back at the workshop.
“Morning, babe!” Tony called as he stepped into the kitchen.
“Yeah. We’ll figure something out. But, uh, now I’d better go. Later!”
And at that, the fight just seemed to bleed out of Rogers, leaving him exhausted. He slumped back against the punching bag for a moment, eyes closed, taking long deep breaths. Tony sat quietly.
Tony was right on time and Steve didn’t know whether to be relieved or disappointed. (Steve quite liked the idea of throwing Tony over his shoulder and carrying him away…) The intervening hours had given Steve lots of time to second guess his choice. Why had he picked 'Casablanca?' Tony would probably like 'Maltese Falcon' better. Or he should have picked something more romantic. But it was too late now—- Tony was dealing with the DVD player that hated Steve and having JARVIS adjust the something-or-others.
“No bald eagle?” Tony teased.
“Yeah right! She practically—”
“Was that good?” Tony asked huskily.
(He had to fix this.)
Steve let out a relieved little breath as subtly as possible, but knew it wouldn't escape her attention. She poured them both tea. (Such beautiful hands . . . Maybe she'd let me sketch them sometime?)
Tony smiled. “Yeah.”
“And Mariko,” he said, pointing to the equally adorable kid making a scrunchy face on the left.
“So,” he said softly, “our date’s at 7?”
“Oh, yeah, definitely,” Tony said, with no clue what he was talking about. “
(See the end of the chapter for
“I—green, but I . . .” Tony fumbled for the right words and tried to string them together. “If you don’t stop soon, I won’t be able to— I’ll . . .” His cheeks went dark. “I won’t be able to wait.”
Below him, Cap’s shield soared. Tony’d lost sight of Natasha—no doubt she was in stealth mode—but he found Clint facing off alone against a pair of spider things, retreating steadily while firing at point blank range.
And Tony was just trying to decide whether to make some innuendo out of Bruce’s remark when Captain America came striding over.
“Ok,” Steve said. “Why don’t I go start getting dinner on while Tony works his magic?”
“Mmmm-hmm,” Tony murmured and (because he’s terribly naughty) rolled his hips against Steve’s. Steve groaned and took his mouth in a deep kiss and—
Chapter 26
Hulk huffed at the mess dripping out of Tony’s ass, retrieving the shower nozzle he easily pushed the tapered head in to the loose gaping hole and set about making his little milk cow’s fuck hole, all fresh and clean. Once he was satisfied he reinserted the dildo, getting Jarvis to inflate the knot to hold it in place.
Thor made his way down to the kitchens for an early breakfast before meeting Sif and the warriors for some sparing, he had spent the night with two Alfehime omegas, vigorously fucking them until they both passed out and was feeling decidedly hungry. Just as he was going to enter, he heard the unmistakable sound of a bitch being fucked, sneaking a peak he was stunned to see Frigga being spit roasted by two burly cooks.  She looked so different now that he almost hadn’t recognised her, her long blond hair was dirty and matted, her stomach swollen with child, breasts spilling out of her dress, milk dripping from her teats.
“I think that losing the use of his hands would be the most effective punishment, being unable to work or do the everyday tasks that we all take for granted will knock the arrogance and disrespect out of him.  Having to rely on someone else and constantly have to ask for help will hopefully give him the humility he is sorely lacking.
After a frustrating week at the Compound doing routine guard duty they would finally get to see the Captain and his omega.  There was an event being held for The Maria Stark Foundation at the Compound, which would also coincide with Stark’s first public appearance as an omega.
Tony drifted up through the layers of sleep, his mind and body lethargic and unwilling to snap back to reality.  If he was awake and aware he would have to acknowledge that his Alpha was fucking him slow and deep scraping his prostrate with each thrust building up the warm heat curling in his stomach and spreading through his limbs.  Teeth grazing his scent glands the biting down sharply on his bonding mark jolted him back to full awareness.
Pepper adjusted he bra and buttoned her blouse, she would need to change her stockings and skirt before the meeting, perhaps she would forgo her knickers and give the old bastards one last thrill before she ousted the lot of them.  With the shares she had been secretly buying back and Steve having Conservatorship of Tony’s holdings they would have enough to buy out the remaining board members and have total control of the Company.
If you are happy with this we can start his new diet immediately, if you are willing I would like to be of some assistance with this, it will be fascinating to study such a unique pregnancy.”
The operation continues, very hand wavy science, totally unrealistic but that's the fun of fanfiction writing.
“Baby on your hands and knees, hold your cheeks so l can see your slutty hole.”
Steve tapped the plug a few times, ensuring that it fitted snuggly before pressing the remote.  He watched Pepper jolt as the vibrations ripped through her, her cunt lips glistening as her asshole clamped down on the plug, the ring of muscles stretching as the plug rapidly expanded.
Jolting awake he realised he was no longer in the strange padded room, but strapped to an examination table. He could see tubes connected to his arms pumping blood out and through a strange machine, and back in through another tube in his right arm.  He was naked and could feel some kind of suction on his cock, he  tried to move his limbs and shout but he was held fast and his throat was wrecked from days of shouting and screaming.
“There we go, mio bel bambino, daddy loves you, what do you say in return?”
I will not now or ever rescue you from this punishment, you deserve everything that happens, and l will watch with glee as you are consumed by your need to be constantly bred by your new pack.  I will never stoop so low as to fuck you, you are gross and disgusting.”
Over time the rarity of omegas gave them their own power, they became wealthy and independent, able to hold Alphas to ransom over mating and pups, leaders of their families in everything but fighting. But as Society evolved Omegas became arrogant and corrupted by the power they held, refusing to bond and bear pups, not wanting to be unmade on an Alpha’s knot.  During that time Omega Crates transformed into Omega Nests, luxurious and opulent, with no bars.
“Sweetheart there is no need to be embarrassed, it is a good sign that your body is letting you know that you are hungry.  Come on let’s get you sitting up so that you can enjoy a slice of the cake that Natasha has baked especially for you.”
Bruce took his time with the injections, the large needles slowly sinking into the meg’s breasts as she screamed in pain when the ice- cold fluid sank into the fatty tissue, then started the slow burn that gradually heated the flesh until her breasts were red and pulsing as the tissue rapidly expanded.
You will epitomize what is expected of an omega, failure to do so in public will incur my disappointment and you will not enjoy the consequences of that.
Bucky tensed not happy that his plans would be delayed but Stevie was a stubborn bastard, he would just have to ensure that the little bitch fucked up so he could encourage Stevie to let him show him all the inventive ways he could come up with to discipline a useless omega.  As for fucking the bitch's cunt he already knew that he could manipulate Steve into pushing the boundaries,  as he was a sucker for a bound and helpless omega.
Have decided to concentrate on finishing this one, as it is difficult remembering all the different stories and what has happened in them.  Have to keep going back and reading through them as I have an incredibly bad memory.
“That is more than enough of that kind of bad behaviour Tony, naughty boys who speak bad words get their mouths washed out with soap and their backsides spanked.  I gave you fair warning yesterday that bad behaviour will not tolerated by myself or any of the staff here to help you through your treatment.”
You need to get me to Asgard and make Thor return me to my true form, Captain America needs to rescue his omega and seek revenge against those who have wronged him.”
Drawing on years of public performances he gathered up that small flicker of strength left within him and decided to make a stand, whatever happened afterwards he would leave to fate.  He walked through the crowds it seemed to take forever to reach the Avengers, the closer he got to them the more he could feel himself trembling, his body hot and heavy his mind a swirling mass of emotions.
It was the simple collar that finally bought home to Tony that even though he was wearing an expensive item of bespoke clothing bedecked in millions of dollars of jewels, he was nothing more than an Omega Slave bound too and owned by his Alpha Master.
Once he had managed to push his cock past Tony’s pussy lips Steve returned to playing with Tony’s nipples, with each pinch of Tony’s swollen nubs he pushed in a little further.  When he had about three inches in, he clicked the release on the clamps letting them fall on to the bed.  Watching his omega intently he saw the exact moment that Tony felt the agony of blood and feeling rush back into his numb nipples.
“Thank you, Captain, if you could just keep your omega quiet and still then l can finish up.  Do you mind if l knot him, l want to see if those little nubs react differently to my cock and knot?”
" Come on you lazy bitch, time to put those milk jugs to good use, need to start them on a regular feeding schedule so they don’t interfere with your duties to the President.
Steve pulls his begging omega off his down deflated knot, pushing him down on to his knees.  Grabbing a handful of dark curls, he held Tony just out of reach of his dripping cock.
Drawing Tony to his feet he handed him some cards before standing close behind him hands resting on his shoulders.  Leaning down on the pretence of kissing his omega’s cheek he whispered;
Peter’s behind throbbed as he lay between Peppers thighs, her cock resting in his open mouth, the slightest movement of the sheet covering them sent a jolt of pain across his reddened skin.  It was going to be a long night between his aching jaw and throbbing behind, yet the curl of satisfaction deep in his gut at having his Alpha’s undivided attention was worth all the pain and discomfort.
Steve had been ecstatic when they had finally captured The Winter Soldier and discovered he was his thought to be dead best friend Bucky Barnes.   Bucky only vaguely remembered him, even  when he told him who he was, even after he shared stories of their childhood and the Howling Commando’s.  Bucky had just cocked his head and sniffed the air and growled,
“Look, Steve.  It’s kinda like learning another language.  I need to know that we’re using the same words the same way, that we have a vocabulary to communicate about BDSM.  I mean, so far we’ve been doing a lot of ‘it’ and ‘this’ and ‘this way’—all kinds of vague, between-the-lines talk, but that isn’t very clear. And clarity matters.”
But he couldn’t.  The winds were cold--nothing like the warm, gentle breezes  that shook the olive trees of Italia--and he’d heard Northmen were as harsh and cold as their climate.
“Glad I missed it,” Tony murmured.
Rogers looked pained.  “I hadn't thought about that,” he admitted quietly.
“He was tough,” Steve said quietly, eyes still unfocused. “And brave. And loyal.” Steve gave a wistful smile, “He taught me to fight. He said, ‘You tuck your thumb into your fist like that, you’re gonna break it. Thumb on the outside or you’re gonna hurt worse than the other guy.’ ”
. . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
(Shit. Steve.)
!” Then, teasingly, “Better hold me and comfort me, poor delicate little thing that I am. Come on, big guy.”
(I shouldn’t be here. I shouldn’t
“I really did want to talk , you know.”
I was going to muck it up!  Walking on eggshells, terrified I’d do something awful that I couldn’t even understand, couldn’t anticipate, because I’m all wrong here--two left feet and five thumbs-- and then you throw it all in my face and now say it’s nothing!  How can you--”
Tony deleted and retyped one of the altimiter equations exactly as it had been.  Rogers kept talking.
Hot chocolate, he thought as he entered the Tower.  He’d make himself a cup of hot chocolate and then he’d go to bed.  It was Christmas after all; it was a good time for cocoa.  He rode the elevator up and up and up to the empty common rooms, well stocked with food he never saw anybody show up to eat.
(“Are you gonna disappoint me or are you gonna really put your back into it?  Come on, you’d better fuck me like a whore, really fuck me up, handsome.”)
“Don’t you like it, Your Majesty?”  Tony asked cheekily. The King blushed and Tony felt oddly delighted by it.
.  Good to me.  And, just,
Rogers’ eyes were very blue.  “Yeah,” he said softly and took a tiny step closer, “I--”
So sorry it took me so long to get this chapter to you and thank you so much for all your encouragement!  I found this chapter unexpectedly hard to write and I've been a bit under the weather lately....
.” A pause. “I liked the buttons.”
“Uh-huh, man,” Clint said, approaching the bag next to him. “Just checking. I really don't wanna end up as collateral damage.”
“Mmmm,” he murmured, taking a sip. “Morning.”
Steve shrugged. “Nothing set in stone. Is there anything in particular you’d like to do?”
“HA!” Tony cried, triumphant but in seconds he hit the mat again.
“Was that . . . okay?” Steve asked with a nervous little frown.
“Side salad?”
“Huh?”  (Left engine seems like it’s humming a little louder.  Shit.  Better look at that soon.)  Tony dragged his eyes from his creation to glance at Rogers.  “I’ve got a stable of lawyers as my Negotiators.”
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“Oh, hey,” Clint said, clearly trying to mask his disappointment. “
“Indeed, sir.”
Tony laughed. “Sure!”
“Uh,” Tony frowned.  “I can’t think of anything.”
“Earlier,” Steve reminded him, “you said that you wanted ‘whatever I want,’ didn’t you?”
They were lingering in the foyer, holding up traffic.
“Yeah. Tony’s been outed as a Taylor Swift fan,” Clint said. “And you’re trending on, well,
“Yeah,” Tony grumbled with a dramatic eye-roll, voice heavy with sarcasm, “sure.”
“I said ‘no,’” Rogers answered more firmly. “We shouldn’t make the announcement like that. We’re a team, we should all go public together.”
Tony shrugged.
And they stood, just smiling at each other in the huge kitchen for a few long moments, before Tony clapped his hands and said briskly, “So, here’s the plan.  I’m gonna go to bed right now and sleep for the next, oh, eleven hours.  Then I’ll get up, have a shower, get dressed and at 7:30, I’m taking you on a second date.  Good?”
(It’s fine.  Things are good.  Maybe it’s not about us at all!)
Tony snorted. “You could have a battalion of eager volunteers for the job who wouldn’t mind.”
“Tony?” Bruce said, “Aren’t you coming to look at the new compound with me?”
“Yes, sir. But, just Veronica, please.”
,” but figured Steve would take it the wrong way. Instead, Tony just kissed Steve again, but Steve kept it chaste.
as I hope?”

“Status report?” Cap called to the ranking SHIELD officer as they emerged.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
With a sultry look and a little hip wiggle, Tony folded gracefully to his knees and tipped his chin. Steve reached down to caress his cheek for a moment, then guided Tony over to rest his head on Steve’s knee.
“Another?” Natasha asked with a smirk, throwing back the last of the vodka.
“I could have found the upper solarium on my own, you know,” Tony pointed out as they trailed after her.
“I’m not telling you to change,” Steve whispered.
. . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
“Do you like the sound of that?” Tony asked quietly, tilting his chin down a little more.
“Hey, babe! You ready?” Tony called, stepping onto Steve’s floor.
“Good.  You say ‘shield’ and everything stops immediately.  I’ll set you lose, stop whatever we’re doing, and take care of you until you can tell me what went wrong.  Okay?”
My heart above my head”
“Are you sure?” Tony asked uncertainly.
Tony lost track of the minutes slipping by. Finally, Steve said quietly, firmly: “You’re right. It was war. I’m proud I served my country. I’m glad we won. If I had to do it again to defeat Hitler, I wouldn’t do it differently. But I’m still sorry they died. That I killed them. Their deaths are on my conscience—I’m still working on penance.”
“Too fucking right,” Tony said. Cap finally took a sip of coffee. They were quiet for a few moments.
“The first two look to me like failed attempts,” Bruce said, “that culminated in the third and the attack. But the new ones . . .” He shrugged. “I hate to speculate, but they seem more
“Hmm.” Steve consulted some handwritten papers he had on the kitchen counter.
“Oh my God, that’s good.”  Tony stole another bite.  “Really, really good.”
Comments and cheer leading always appreciated!  Let me know if you have a favorite bit! :)
Bruce murmured with approval.  “That’s a good one.”
“I almost lost it, you know,” he said softly. Tony had to lean closer to hear. “Seeing you go through, knowing you might not— I saw red. Er,” Bruce gave a nasty, self-mocking laugh, “
“Tsk, tsk,” Tony said. “I told them to have that thing locked and loaded when we left.  Somebody’s getting demerits for preparedness.”
“As I recall he asked you first,” Tony said, with a little snort.
“So, what did you bring me?” Tony demanded.
“I’m glad you did—but I’d very much like a repeat.” Tony gave a sly grin and said in a sultry tone, “How ‘bout you finish that omelet, soldier, then carry me back to bed and strip me again?”
“--these.”
“Just so you know, I won’t be pulling my punches,” Tony said, doing his warm-up stretches in the training room. “I’m not afraid to hit an old man.”
“Yeah.  You too, Pep.  Bye.”
“You know, Betty and I met in the labs at Columbia.”
“No, no, no,” Bruce said, taking the scrub brush. “You cooked.”
“Good evening and welcome to Cucina Paradiso,” their server said with a smile at them both. “Are you ready to order?”
And this time there wasn’t much that could by called shy or uncertain in Steve’s manner.  The hand at the small of Tony’s back was firm. (Masterful.)  He didn’t hesitate at the doors or over paying for the taxi.  Tony had given him clear permission and he was happy to accept.  There was something decidedly sexy about Steve’s new confidence.
Tony took a seat as far away from Rogers as possible and glued his eyes to his phone.  He tried to answer a few emails from Pepper and Isaac, but his concentration was shot to hell.
“Cap’s floor, please, J.”
“Avengers,” Cap said, “Prepare to fall out. We’ll debrief at the Tower. Agents, tomorrow at SHIELD.” Everyone started shuffling off to their respective ships, but Steve added, “Agent James—a word.”
He twisted to look up at her and hesitated a second before adding: “You know . . . I’ll do anything in my power to help you be a mom.  Anything at all.  Just say the word.”
“Steve,” Tony answered breathlessly.
Steve licked his lips and swallowed before answering in a whisper:  “Shield.”
“And just so we’re clear, this is for me, Steve.”  Tony pressed a kiss to Steve’s neck then whispered, hot and rough into Steve’s ear: “Spread your legs.”
Steve’s smile looked like happiness—not a blinding, flashy sort of joy, but something soft and shy and gentle—and Tony could feel his own smile matching it, even as he watched Steve walking away and the elevator doors closing on his smiling face.
“That’s what I’m hoping,” Tony said.
The next chart repeated the alphabetical list of kinks while the columns detailed Tony’s experience levels with them. There were links to various little notes like “historically, didn’t combine well with a blindfold” or “particularly enjoyed with suspension bondage.”
He’d known of course--the look on Steve’s face made it obvious--but he hadn’t expected such a blunt answer.  It left him unbalanced.
“When you’re ready, Bruce,” Steve said.
“Nooo,” Steve admitted slowly, like the word was being drawn from him against his will.
“Yes.  Right.  Of course,” Rogers answered a little haltingly.  “I'm sorry I intruded.  Have a good evening.”
“Nope! Got frustrated about an hour ago and went to meditate,” Tony said with a shrug. “Something about coming back to it fresh, something yoga something something.”
“Other than that,” Steve concluded, “I’d say they’re doing well.  Basic strategy is strong.  Excellent marksmanship and hand-to-hand.  Reflexes are good, though I’m sure Agent Romanov would be more critical than I am.  Maybe bring her in for a day too.  For the most part, they all did well on tactics, with the exception of Anderson.  I put it in my write-up.”  Steve shook his head.  “He didn’t factor civilians and team safety into his plan.  Consistently.  It wasn’t a race against a ticking bomb or something—he could have included a safety factor and didn’t.”
Tony worked on the new color e-ink displays. Pepper texted him reminders to eat and, when he didn’t answer, ordered delivery for him from that sushi place on Santa Monica he loved. It was good. He was making progress.
He was proud of that move. Maybe the 21st century hadn’t seen it all quite yet.
!” should be the tagline for half of those movies. (Ew.)
Ms. Potts propped her box awkwardly against the trunk and fumbled in her bag for the keys.  Steve wanted to help--it looked like it might go crashing down, shattering bottles and spilling Tony’s fancy collection at any moment--but he knew she’d resent it.
(Was his memory blacking out? Didn't he remember Steve had carried him?)
“I know I should let you go back to work, but there was something else, actually.  If you have a minute?”
“But she does trust you,” Tony insisted.
“JARVIS has a self-harm protocol.”
Tony didn't know what to say to that.
“Right,” Steve said dubiously. Tony blazed ahead.
“I’m just—I sometimes forget how strong I am now. After the serum.”
(Mom would have loved the Safehouse . . .)
Tony pulled himself from his thoughts. “No! It’s uh, sorry. Meds, you know.”
“Yeah. Sounds good.” Tony picked up a wrench. “But you should take her out. Give me a full report—I wanna know how she rides.”
God damn it.
“Hi Steve,” Bruce said as he entered the kitchen.  “Back from SHIELD already?”
Tony fumbled his through the dark workshop over to the beat up couch in the corner, beckoning Dummy to follow. Tony flopped down low on the couch so Dummy could rest his claw on Tony’s thigh.
,if he's going to try and keep Tony in the closet, which will never work long-term! When I got Tony's text asking me to keep everything between them on the 'dl,' I wanted to march right over here and-- I don't even know!”
Steve looked at him quizzically and opened his mouth, then shut it. Tony grabbed a knife and started cutting up the melon.
Eventually, Steve drew back.
"After all," Rogers added softly, "we're not rationing for the war anymore."
.I know you do,” Pepper said.  He could tell from her voice that she was smiling.  “And you know what I mean.”
“Nah, we’re good, J.” Tony rolled his eyes again for good measure. “Gimmie some AC/DC—time to finish Nat’s uniform!”
“Guys!  Hurry up!” Clint called.  Steve and Tony joined the others in their usual seats on the vast, wide, v-shaped couch.   Natasha, Clint, and Thor on one wing, then Bruce, Tony, Steve on the next.
, he could hear Howard’s voice in his mind.)
. Tony stumbled.
“Hi,” he answered.
“Yeah,” Tony said, relieved. “Definitely.”
Steve’s face lit up.  “Anna and Luca?”
The creature was getting taller and narrower, gathering itself up. Tony braced for an attack and readied his repulsors on stun; his heart started slamming into his chest, even faster than before. As the creature grew, it was changing color too, from that slick, repellent greyish-green to a muted red, grey, and blue.
Bemused, Steve complied. Tony dropped the pillow against the couch at Pepper’s feet and folded to his knees beside her. She let out a pleased little murmur.
And it was on the tip of Tony’s tongue—“Yeah, cool. Tradition!  Let’s bring back the chariot!  Or better yet,
“And a wild boy like you must have certain . . . needs, after all,” she said with a smirk. Tony took a sharp breath; his guts clenched.
“Sure thing. Milk and sugar?”
Steve swallowed and turned a little to look at the bike and run his fingers across the smooth leather seat. He turned back to Tony with a boyish grin: “You said something about taking her for a spin?”
“Excuse me, Mr. Stark?” Rogers called out, voice loud enough to carry over Black Sabbath.  Tony was tempted to let it keep playing—Rogers probably hated it—but Tony wasn’t
“When was the last time you gave me gadgets anyhow?” Tony let out another little squawk. “And you still won’t give me more guns.”
“Go on then.  Suck my cock.”
“Humph.
“Hey, Tony,” Steve said, strolling into the genius’ workshop. Tony just grunted, soldering something and not willing to look up. Steve smiled and wandered over to take a seat in *his* chair. (He was a frequent visitor to the workshop and had his own chair. It was a Big Deal to have a chair in Tony’s space. He also got to leave his pencils and sketchpads on the side table. That was a Big Deal too.) Steve smiled. It was good to watch Tony work.
“Good.  What the fuck, man?  You’re not supposed to get hurt.   I made you a suit so you
“The next time Father Gabe made his rounds, Buck asked to come see me. Mom was at work. He stayed all afternoon. We talked and I read to him, storybooks mom brought from the library. Bucky wasn’t a very good reader yet, even though he was older than me, so eventually I helped him with homework. And he’d tell me about the fights his dad had won and how to throw a punch and we listened to the Lone Ranger on the radio, then made up the story ourselves whenever the reception cut out.”
(You didn’t forget!  You always forget.  I was going to drag you out of the workshop and push you into the shower at ten after.  And I was okay with that!)
play a few games.”
Pepper sighed and leaned back in her chair.  She set her glass down.  “Fine.  I just—you two seemed to click on a level I’ve never seen you click with anyone.  When Bruce moved in and we were—“ she swallowed, “when there were just the three of us in the Tower, I’d come down to the lab and you would be working on something together and you looked so happy, speaking science to each other in your own little world.”  Pepper gave a little shrug.  “I had no idea you and the Captain had become so close.”
. Bruce thinks it’s absurd speculation.” Tony cut up his pancakes while he talked. They had just the right amount of syrup. “He may be right--probably is--but I’m trying to think of it as an intellectual exercise. Can’t seem to stop thinking about it anyway, so—“ Tony cut himself off with a bite of pancake.
“Huh?”
“Sorry,” Steve said with a rueful smile.  He put his hands in his pockets. “I didn’t mean to interrupt you, but I thought you might have skipped dinner, so I wanted to ask if you’d like me to bring you something.”
Dom wagged his finger at the Captain.
“How’ve you been?” Tony asked, smile growing more real with every moment.  (He’d always liked Johnny…)
Happy Valentine's day!  Have an extra-speedy update as your valentine.  :-)
Bruce gave him a quizzical look. “Is everything okay?”
“Cool!”  Tony wiped his oily hands on a rag, then dabbed at Dummy as best he could.
“So,” Tony said, “I heard that you’ve been giving hand-to-hand training to everybody. Well--” he took a long sip of water, “everybody except
“All right, Mr. Stark,” Rogers said, with maybe a bit of hesitance.  “I’ll see you later.”
Steve shook his head, lips twisting a little ruefully as he said, “See, I’ve been wrong before, especially in this century, so I just wanted to make sure that this—
Steve forced himself to smile at her and he stepped out of the doorway then followed her to the elevator.
(He’d remembered food, right? That had totally been on the list. Food.)
Steve dropped his head in his hands.
“Of course,” JARVIS said smoothly. “Shall I inform your teammates?”
Tony waved a hand. “You can get anything if you know the right people. Or if your people know the right people.”
(No wonder the old man walking to the bus stop paused to stare at them for a moment.)
“Yes. Does that--”
Steve’s eyes were brimming with remembered affection.
“Gotta be more specific,” Agent Dominick said, but his smirk belied his words.
In his bedroom, Tony stripped out of his clothes and crawled into bed, naked and drained. He’d set the little dagger on his nightstand.
Steve generated an insane amount of body heat and the texture of his ridiculous khakis was surprisingly smooth under Tony’s cheek. Steve’s hand settled in his hair, carding his fingers through it gently. Tony tried to relax.
Well. He had said to drop by any time, right?
The Pierre.  (Fuck.  Ha!  Literally.) Tony hated that place. Not that the experience
“You’re so good, baby,” Tony mumbled, pressing a kiss to Steve’s thigh.
: I know. But it’d still be ok.
)—had seen it.
Natasha didn’t actually need a new, improved Bite immediately.  She didn’t even know he was working on it.  His eyes were aching.  Maybe he should get some rest and finish it up tomorrow.
In the elevator, he took off his sweatshirt and was relieved to find his temperature (and color) dropping to normal again. Another deep breath.
“Oh? You’re too kind.”
friend!); envy (of that certain bond between soldiers); surprise (that Rogers could laugh like that); unease (at such visceral proof other people’s lives had gone on in the weeks he’d been comatose, then bedridden).
(Not that Tony'd be cruel, just-- geeze, he can be so intimidating sometimes!)
“She said, you’d like it,” Rhodey reassured him.
“Well then.” Tony said, voice rich with promise.  “Shall we go inside?”
“Tony?” Steve said, laying a hand on his lover’s shoulder and holding out a bowl of chili.  (You’ve been staring.  Still tired?  Huh.  Maybe I shouldn’t have woken you up.)  “You ready?”
The Captain wrenched his comm from his ear and spun on his heel, looking ready to throw the little headset at a tree.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
“Shall we?” Steve asked. Tony nodded and rose from the table, then felt a flicker of uncertainty about whether he should have waited for Steve to get his chair. Happily, Steve didn’t seem fussed about it.
—in his home, but if Rhodey liked her she’d probably be pretty cool. Maybe.
“You make the most beautiful noises, Steve,” Tony murmured, eyes fixed intently on Steve’s face. Steve stared back at him wide-eyed, captivated.  Tony drew his finger out, then pressed in to touch that place again.
Pepper let out a little chuckle.  (Yeah, joking is okay.  Pepper likes joking around.  Not that we’re actually friends, but we’re sort of
Rhodes grinned and nodded. “Rhodey.”
“But you need to eat it with a knife and fork,” Steve protested.
Johnny frowned.  “That’s my cue,” he murmured.
(Smooth, Tony, real smooth.  That was NOT the speech we practiced in the workshop, now was it?)
“Also, Dr. Banner and Agent Barton have both asked again to visit the workshop.”
“No, you’re not.”
while you were in a coma. I was half out of my mind at the thought you might never wake up. You will NOT jeopardize your recovery in a misguided attempt at self-punishment.”
“Nah.  No need.” Tony waved him off.  “Hey, JARVIS, start the coffee in my workshop!”
“So,” Tony said, glancing up for a moment, “How’s it going? Intake interview okay?”
“Shouldn’t let your guard down,” Bruce said smugly above them. He and Natasha had used an emergency blanket to carry over Tony’s entire arsenal and dump it on them.
“. . . Steve . . .”
(Huh. Apparently, I’ve turned into Pepper.)
Tony nearly snorted.  Well, at least he hadn't asked Pepper's permission to invite Tony.
“Tony,” Steve said urgently. Tony looked back to him, startled; Steve swallowed thickly, his Dominant’s notch bobbing.
“Steve, I—“  Tony began, voice rough.  He struggled a moment, then just pulled Steve up for an intense kiss, all teeth and tongues and hard, wet heat.  Steve pressed closer, panting into Tony’s mouth, and just as he was about to climb onto Tony’s lap—
Steve shrugged and closed his eyes.
“Hey, are you ok?” Pepper asked, looking concerned. Tony stopped his tapping abruptly.
, bird brain?”
of the grey at his temples. He’d been tastefully touching up the quantity of grey for a while.) But on the red carpet . . .
“Tony?” Steve asked, nuzzling at Tony’s throat.  “I want to see you.”
“Don’t torture me by making me wait,” Tony said, then pitched his voice lower to a sultry whisper. “I want your cock, Steve. Want you to hold me here and take your pleasure. Want you to own my body.”
updated note (3/19/14): I'm going through a bit of madness at work and leaving on an unexpected trip-- this on top of finding the next chapter hard to write and being away from my lovely beta... so, please bear with the delay.  I'll be back, hopefully in early April.  Thank you for your patience!
“Ha! You think?”
“Hey, Tony,” Steve called from the doorway to the workshop. “Knock, knock?”
After a moment’s hesitation, Steve sat awkwardly beside him on the bed.
“Oh, please,” Tony said, “you can wheel and deal them with your hands tied behind your back. Besides, I bet that you’ve had your pitch and negotiations ready for days and, even if not, Samia’s a boss and can help finish up the prep. And you can practice delegating.”
“Or before. Or . . . ever.” Steve looked mortified and hid his face in his hands. “Oh, God, Tony I should have told you sooner.”
Sorry for the delay!  I was struggling with The Conversation and this chapter kept growing and growing and causing me trouble.  Also RL.  Hopefully I can get the next chapter to you more quickly!
baby now.”  Tony finished and moved on to his next glass of wine, finishing half in one long drink.
“Screens blank!”
“Hey Steve?” Tony said tentatively, glancing over to where Steve was shading something with a red colored pencil.
The silence stretched on, long but not oppressive.  Just as Steve was considering drifting back to sleep nestled in Tony’s arms, Tony spoke:
--and for once he didn’t want to be spending it in the lab doing advanced astrophysics.
(Not bad.) He poured the water into the carafe and fitted the pot in place, thinking the words he couldn’t say out loud, even alone.

“Was it . . . Ok?”
Tony wanted to point out that indoor and outdoor hot tubs were very different and, in any case, he wasn’t the one who had installed them. But he didn’t. Everything was feeling kind of awkward. (The change of location?) Maybe Clint and Natasha were still pissed at each other about movie night yesterday—they’d seemed super weird and tense about movie selection. And pizza toppings. (Whatever.)
is one of your favorite pictures,” Rogers said as he cooked.  “I can sure see why.  It was really amazing.”
“Other than finally asking Tony out on a proper date?” Steve shrugged. “Pretty much the same as usual. Working at SHIELD off and on. Minor call outs for the Avengers.”
was like an itch coursing in his veins, but he ignored it; if he was going to install upgrades or redesign it, there was really no sense doing work twice.
“Just working through some frustrations,” Natasha shrugged and sauntered out.  “Good practice.”
“I think you’ve mentioned that.”
relatives.”
“Nah. It’s good from there.” Tony plopped down on the couch between them. “Hit it, Cap.”
“Of course, sir.” Then a moment later. “I regret it is going to voicemail. Will you be leaving a message?”

was a fucking workout—anyone’d be out of breath.) He was a sweaty mess, his muscles were pleasantly sore, and there was no way he’d be getting up until Rogers let him—not with Rogers straddling him, Tony’s thighs pinned under Rogers’ shins, and his arms stretched over his head, held firmly in Rogers’ massive hands.
I won't be able to sustain a chapter a day (or anything like it) but was so excited to finish this chapter I couldn't wait to post it.  Hope you enjoyed!
Tony had no idea what that particular painting looked like, but he could picture the rest of the scene so vividly: Steve on his knees in the hay with a lantern, gazing on the Madonna with rapt and hopeful devotion, tears standing in his eyes.
“Should have done that sooner,” Clint said. “Then you wouldn’t have missed Cap.” He threw another paper ball at Tony’s face; his reflexes were still too slow to dodge it. It hit him on the nose.
Steve forced himself to unwind his wraps, slowly, methodically-- trying to let the familiar motions soothe him. He took a deep breath. The sound of Clint's punches resounded through the gym.
“So,” Tony said, eager to be done, “You want to show me respect?  Don’t do that stuff.  Other than that, we’re cool. Okay?”
“Nevermind, J! Only book the places that have private rooms. And arrange for us to come in though a more discreet entrance if possible. Let me know what they’ve got.”
Tony took long, deep, even breaths and slowly Steve began to match him.  In, out.  In, out.  After a few minutes, Tony whispered, “Steve?”
Steve rose from the couch, picking Tony up with him in a smooth motion, supporting Tony with one arm under his butt, one at the small of his back. (Phew—ok, that was hot… It was like he weighed
Tony wasn’t stupid, though.  This was obviously another “team bonding” thing, but he could do that.  He was Iron Man. He could do anything.
Tony swallowed. “Sounds like he was a hell of a guy.”
“If you want me
With that she disappeared back into the elevator. When Tony turned, Steve was just giving him this . . . this look, a muted not-quite smile, like he was trying to hold in a grin or something.
Tony’d been so certain that he was going to bed alone—and telling himself firmly that it was fine—it took a moment for his brain to catch up with Steve’s words. Steve was already filling Tony’s surprised silence with his backpedalling: “But if not, that’s fine.  I won’t be offended if you’d rath—“
Steve inhaled sharply.  (Oh fuck. Yeah, that . . . that, was just fine.)
“Not Mars— it’s actually pretty similar to earth in a lot of ways, so that wouldn’t alter photons-- but another planet or dimension.”  Rogers just nodded. Tony was sort of expecting him to freak out, had kind of been looking forward to it in fact. Tony raised one eyebrow and said, “You’re taking this pretty calmly.”
“You didn’t hurt me,” Tony repeated.  He added, voice a little thick, “You were wonderful.”  He touched Steve’s cheek the way Steve loved to touch his and murmured, “You’re so good to me.”
) He couldn’t keep his hips still.
“Hi,” Steve said. He gave Tony a half-hearted smile; his brow was creased, his expression tight.
. It was nice.
Steve’s ears went pink and his pupils dark with pleasure. He cupped Tony’s cheek in one large hand and leaned in for a kiss, a soft, gentle press of lips before he started to withdraw. But then, almost as if he couldn’t help himself, Steve was pressing forward again, lips parting and tongue coaxing; his fingers dug into Tony’s hair, holding him firmly. Tony parted his lips with a little moan and welcomed Steve in as the little kiss turned slick and urgent and hard.
Tony blinked.
Tony almost laughed. (Yeah, she must be new.)
“And I’ll start with the gnocchi burro e salvia,” Steve said, “and then the pollo parmigiano and the sautéed vegetables please.”
Tony’s heart started speeding up as soon as he stepped into the elevator.
(Because the sub’s the one who told them to have it loaded and ready?)
As Tony rode the elevator, he was mentally gloating. (See, Rhodey? I remember food on my own!) Tony was gonna turn the tables on Rhodes and drag
“In light of the latest anomaly,” Bruce said, “I’m inclined to think it’s actually a combination of the two theories.”
“Would you like some cocoa?” Steve blurted, too urgent and too loud.  He almost winced at the sound of his voice, half ashamed of how desperate he was for Tony to stay, even for just a few minutes, to ramble about his project for a while or simply sit with him in silence.
Screw them all.
(Shit.) Tony frowned. (“
“Hey, JARVIS!  Throw up a projection and give me Steve’s spreadsheet.”
“Iron Man, I’ll cover you—get Hawkeye to a new position in, three, two, one!”
“Steve . . .”
“Mmmm?”
Tony managed not to laugh, but only barely. (Seriously? This guy had nothing to be embarrassed about!)
Pepper laughed and kissed him on the cheek. “Be right back.”
Of course, while fighting spiders, Tony was also reviewing data Bruce sent him. It looked like Hypothetical 79 was probably their baby.
“His wife—“ Tony said.
After a few moments, Steve looked up and said more decisively, “Yeah, why not? JARVIS, if you don’t mind?”
“I don’t understand how I upset you,” Rogers said in an even tone.
Natasha smiled.
“Yes! Unless you wanna come see the training robots I designed.”
Steve went back to mental recitations of Dickinson.
Steve nodded as he gathered up the detritus of their delivery feast.
(Huh?)
Tony didn’t say anything; Rhodey was still talking.
Silently, JARVIS complied.  Rogers was almost exactly where Tony had left him.  He’d taken a seat on the large leather sofa, and was staring vacantly at the coffee table, unmoving, expression blank.
“You what?”
Though maybe it had been when Rhodey, yielding to Tony’s entreaties, had been passionately flailing his way through “Smooth Criminal.” (Again, fuzzy.) Rhodey really was a terrible dancer, but he
for me.”
Steve nodded, but as they entered the grand ballroom Tony felt a pang.  Steve
“And, I think it’s pretty clear Artur Avila will win one next year,” Tony said, grabbing a third tonic water.
(“Good boy. Mmmm. . . .That’s it. . .” )
“Yeah,” he agreed faintly. (Shit.) He was pretty sure the whole team had seen him doing his best stripper dance, shaking his booty left and right on the table and maybe gyrating about the living room. Tony’s cheeks flushed with unwilling embarrassment. (Whatever. There was nothing to be embarrassed about, damn it. He hadn’t done anything wrong.) Tony curled up around Pepper again, trying to hide his blush.
Rogers looked very seriously at him and then shook his head with a sigh.  “No.  I’m team leader.  Ultimately, it’s my fault the mini-spectrometer wasn’t ready.  If it had been, you and Dr. Banner would have at least the first set of readings, right?”
“Tony Stark likes to fight his own battles,” Nat said.  “Or did you think it was an accident that the electric locks ‘malfunctioned’ and left Agent Dominick stranded in a containment unit with a ‘broken’ intercom for thirteen hours?”
“Yes, of course!” Steve hastened to arrange one of the luxurious pillows on the floor for Tony as the camera skimmed the majestic mountains of the Mines of Moria.
-------------------------
“Did you see Tony?” Steve asked.
“Nine down.  No injuries.  Getting into position for a sneak attack against main target.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“No! It's fine, babe. I mean, I'm flattered, only I'm too--” Tony closed his eyes and let out a little groan. “You know what? I'm gonna shut up now.”
Hospital. Tony was in the hospital. (Tony
“I don’t think the math games—what’s it called? The numbers in boxes.”
“I never go anywhere without one,” she said, eyes intense as she offered it to him hilt first. “
“I’m surprised the Captain hasn’t dropped by the Tower yet,” Bruce said suddenly.  He poured two mugs of coffee and set one at Tony’s elbow.  “To check in with us and, you know,” Bruce added, his tone amused, “bring you coffee.  Or something.”
Steve looked startled, then he shook his head and answered, voice low and vehement: “
“Do please come in,” he said. “I’ll let Ms. Ahmadi know that you and your guest have arrived.”
“Great!” Tony said brightly. He grabbed Steve’s hand and pulled him from the elevator.
Thanks for sticking around while I dealt with all the madness in RL.  It's great to be back to writing at last!  Hope you like it. :)
“--wanna get to my run,” Cap was saying. “I’ve sort of got a new running buddy and I don’t want to miss him.”
Rebecca smirked at Tony and pinched him on the arm. “See? That’s what you get for hooking up with committed liberationists.” She looked over at Sam, her eyes brimming with affection and a certain sweet pride; Tony felt something depressingly like envy. The two of them were good together.
“Where have you placed Banner?”
His mind was constantly fuzzy, he hoped that Tony was safe and had managed to escape, although the had vague memories of him in a pretty red dress standing in his lab. He could not understand why what ever drugs they were forcing into him we’re not being burned out of his system by the serum.
“I sorry daddy, l will be a good boy, nomore naughty Tony.”
“Captain Rogers I take it that Winter has informed you that your omega’s post pregnancy mini heat is starting.  You need to calm down for a moment and listen to what I have to say, please sit down this is important.”
There was no way he was going to wait to fuck her until after dinner, he deserved to be first after all the shit she had caused the family, destroying their business.  He waited for her to dry off, do her hair and makeup before making his move as she tried to do the hooks on her bra.
“Shit Natasha he doesn’t recognises me or my voice, fuck! I really thought he was Tony, what the hell are we going to do, we only have a few days until the Portal appears. How are we going to find Tony now, we cannot go back to the Compound, they will have realised that we are missing by now and that we have Stark.”
Greg adjusted his cock as he watched Captain America reduce his omega to a puddle of goo in less than three minutes. He wondered if the Alpha would be open to fucking his omega on film or letting him have a few minutes with the bitch.
We were walking home through the park after dinner at that little diner you like because its décor is all 1930s/1940s, it was dark and we stopped by the fountain.  We sat on the edge chatting and cuddling, then you leaned in to kiss me, just at the moment our lips met one of the park police patrols stopped an shone their torches on us, you startled so badly that you lost your balance and we both fell back into the fountain.
After checking his vitals and straightening the blankets, she bustled out, informing Steve that the doctor would be along in the morning.
Steve repositioned Tony’s bound arms so they were stretched above his head, whilst a metal spreader bar attached to the floor held his ankles wide apart feet barely touching the soft carpet.  Steve admired his omega’s naked body stretched out before him, the smoothness of his groin where his cock was tucked away, the crystal beads sparkling between his spread pussy lips leaving a glittering trail to his plugged ass hole.
Loki, present yourself to Master Sira, do as she commands, you are my Jotun breeder and I would have you appropriately attired for tonight’s festivities.
I didn’t consent to any of the modification you have done to my body, yet they seem natural and why would l agree to freely bond with you?  You are a monster, who has physically and mentally abused me, but you are also to my mind and body, my Alpha.
Each smack of the paddle had their omega gasping, Winter concentrated first on the plump cheeks, when he noticed the omega deliberately pushing his reddened cheeks he changed the angle and landed the next few blows along the tops of each thigh, smirking at each howl real pain that followed.  To finish off he changed the angle of his strokes to ensure he reached the tender sit spots, and if he added another five strokes to each cheek well it wasn’t as if the little bitch could complain about the unfairness of it to anyone.
Tony wanted to curl up and die, it was so embarrassing to have to admit he was a total virgin when it came to anal sex or any physical intimacy with a man, but he knew that if he didn’t want to freak out about all that Steve had planned he needed to be honest with him and let him know.
The last thing she heard from the limo was laughter at her brother’s comment before she was left naked and shivering with cold and fear under the cold eyes of her father and half-brother.  ‘Please, please,’ she whispered, let them say the hated words.
Pepper was incandescent with rage at the sight of Peter writhing and moaning his naked butt raised up in the air as he grasped at his chastity belt, trying desperately to rip it off, whilst begging for Natasha and Clint to fuck him, not even aware they were no longer there.
“Hulk got his Daisy Cow pretty outfit to wear, I put on knickers first they Jarvis you do arms and legs with them funny nano thingies.”
“Well that just about ends this presentation of R&D for this quarter, ahh mmmh ooh shi iiit!  Sh iit!  Christ Steve what the fu uuk is the matter with you? how the hell do you expect me to get through this if you k..ke ..ep bloody dis ..dis ..tra ..cting me!!  Is not fair!!”
Steve didn’t know what to do, if he refused, he could end up being dismissed and thrown out of the Compound, but how could he abuse Tony in front of all these people.  He was dammed either way, but he could beg Tony’s forgiveness after they had rescued him, that was the end game.
Steve, Natasha and the Professor were all in agreement that this Bruce would be easily persuaded that their society was far superior to his own and the prize of getting rid of his unwanted alter ego would lead him firmly to the belief that the strict following of  Alpha/Beta/Omega  orientation created a more stable and viable society.
Chapter 86
Chapter 60
“Someone is being a naughty boy, no don’t stop, suck on your fingers, get them nice and wet then rub them over your hole.”
“Fuck! Fuck! The can’t do that Steve, what the hell!  This is ridiculous I am not going to stand for it, Pepper needs to sort this out, get the lawyers on to it, those sharks will eat those stupid judges for breakfast.  Where’s my phone Steve? I need to call Pepper straight away, can’t believe those stupid old coots think they can mess with me.”
Once we are fully mated your omega scent will combine with mine and create a unique blend of both, this along with your mating bite will clearly indicate you are a bonded omega and off limits to any other alpha.”
Steve stood pulling Tony up with him, gripping his omega’s tunic he ripped it from his body exposing his omega’s naked body to the view of the staring Alphas.
“Good grief the transformation is amazing, he looks totally different from the media images and the photos you showed me at Conservatorship meeting.
More punishment for Tony and Steve has a decision to make.
Tears streamed down his cheeks, as the trickle of piss continued, his exhausted body refusing to react to any signals sent to his muscles.
JARVIS has a plan to ensure his creator is protected, its just a bit of a shame he listened and read as gospel that Steve's view of Alpha/Omega bonding was correct.
Chapter 56
Steve sets some new rules to take into account Tony's different headspaces.
Rolling the baby cock between his fingers he ground his hard cock against Tony’s lower back, eying up the other Alphas as they watched.
Steve wrapped the rope round Pepper’s waist pulling it tight, forming a larks loop before doubling the rope round and threading he end through. Usually there would only be one knot, but he knotted a row of four, one to sit over her clit, two for her cunt and a larger on to sit over her asshole.  Tugging hard he ignores her gasp and ties it off, taking another length of rope he binds her breasts, the small mounds squeezed tight around their base and separated with a knotted straps that joins at the back of her neck, a few twists around her neck and a collar forms.
“Darling nothing would make me happier than for you to be my baby and I your Daddy, I am so sad and lonely when you push me away and spend all your time in the workshop. I hate when you drink and don’t take your medication properly, I don’t know how much longer I can take your volatile and irrational behaviour.  The things you say and do can be so hurtful even though I know you do not mean them and are just lashing out trying to protect yourself from people and the world that always asks and expects too much from you.
Thor sat next to the watcher, looking at the sleeping bitch in the mirror, he didn’t consider Steve an alpha anymore, just like he didn’t think of Winter as anything else but a breeding stud.
Sliding down to his knees after the final smack, he takes out the thick long length and tries his best to swallow it all down without choking.  Steve’s hand in his hair guides him as he slurps and sucks messily, he tries not to panic when his face is held against his crotch and he can’t breathe.
Mortified, he knelt on the cushion, spreading his thighs wide, the tiny scrap of mesh did nothing to hide that he no longer had a full size cock.  He could here the titters of the older women, wondering if he had been smoothed or just reduced.  Clasping his hands behind his back ensured that his fleshy pecs with their hard nipples are prominently displayed along with the two lines of smaller nipples.
Yes Alpha.
“Baby boy do you have something to say to your daddy?”
He was pleased to see that Tony hadn’t bothered to slip on his drawers, last night’s spanking seemed to have worked.  Not that he didn’t expect more resistance later today, with his choice of outfit or lack of one.
Steve knew that the final decision would be his, both ideas had merit but trying to pass this younger Stark of as Tony’s son would mean having to produce a whole backstory as to who was his mother, who raised him, where had he lived, and what Omega Schools he attended.  The media would go searching, if they found any discrepancies in the story then the speculation would begin, the gutter press would be relentless, they couldn’t take that risk.
He removed the O ring as the mush was a lot thicker and he would have to spoon feed Tony.  His omega could not see the size of the bowl so would have no idea of how much he was going to be forced to eat, to make it more interesting Steve had placed different size spoons by the bowl so Tony would never know how much he was going to have to swallow down at each mouthful.
Days later he screwed the last plate in place and fitted her permanent spider gag.  Feeding the second thin tube down her throat he uses the camera to ensure that he burns through her vocal cords without damaging their rest of her throat, the stretch of burnt flesh makes him palm his cock as Pepper screamed without making any sound.
Holding his position, he leaned down to suck and lave his omega’s plump hard nipples fingers massaging the swollen pecs.  Withdrawing his cock almost fully he then plunged back in setting a harsh pace aware that nothing less would keep his omega’s cunt walls stretched and stop the muscles from tightening up again.
Not wanting to drink his omega dry this time he pulls off, teeth deliberately grazing the milk drenched nipple, Tony twitches and moans beneath him legs circling his waist heels to his back pressing him deeper into his pulsing cunt.
“I had to offer that option Captain, but I have to say I am in agreement with you on breeding Tony during this heat.  Pregnancy has a calming affect on some omegas and Tony seems to fall in to that category, plus it has the added effect of keeping him needy and horny.  Between servicing his Alphas and caring for the pups he is not going to have any time for creating mischief and mayhem.”
“Good girl Petey, just relax and let me use your pretty mouth, there we go take me in all the way and hold still.”
Upping his alpha voice to the max, he asked again, watching as Steve jerked and fell to his knees, holding out the photo.
At that point it was decided to send two agents with one of our doctors to collect his private physician and his medical files, after having received permission from Ms Potts as Stark had been given a mild sedative to calm him down.  Dr Davidson seemed panicked when our agents requested he come to Shield Medical and bring Mr Stark’s medical files, once here it was decided to interview him before letting him look over his patient. Within 5 minutes he was spilling the most well, kept secret since who actually shot President Kennedy.
Tony babbled and pleaded with Steve as he tried to thrust into his Alpha’s mouth but with huge hands holding his hips still and the smallness of his cock it was easy for Alpha to continue toying with him, keeping him on the brink of orgasm.
After clasping her hands behind her back, she spread her knees wide, raising her eyes she stared at her reflection, eyes welling with tears, that began to flow as large hands stroked her head.
Steve and Winter watch as Tony crawls towards them head hanging low tears dripping, his thighs are splayed wide as he shuffles forward the massive plug and dildo preventing him from closing them. His heavy breasts hang low between his arms, nipples grazing the floor as he crawls towards them the tender nubs rubbed raw.
“Widow, get to the jet, use the tranquillisers on Hulk, l will bring Tony.”
Thor smirked when he bent to ruffle the little omegas hair, discreetly scenting him, he immediately recognised the faint scent.
His awareness faded again and he awoke to feel the comfort of his bed beneath his aching body. His Alpha’s cock was still filling his channel although he could feel that the knot was going down. A warm heat enveloped him as Steve’s arms held him tight.
Tony continued to pose and answer questions, smiling when he couldn’t give one of the set responses.  He was relieved when Winter leashed him and led him into the Ballroom, he has forgotten how ravenous the press could be when they wanted a story.
He took pity on the obviously in pain omega, it wouldn’t matter anyway as they were still tied together and would be for at least another 10 minutes.  He used his knife to rip through the sheet binding him to the rail, picking him up he carried him back into the cabin and sat on the bed.
Tony flushed red, his pussy squirting, he couldn’t help but respond to the dominant tone of Steve’s voice, red rimmed alpha eyes glaring down at him. He was mortified and simultaneously aroused by Steve’s insistence on treating him as a femme omega at this bassist level. He could hear a faint voice in his head shouting at him to resist, but the burn of arousal and the hunger for his Alpha’s knot silenced it.
Just Steve having his wicked way with Tony and poor helpless Tony not having any say in the matter.
Bruce nodded in agreement, drained his coffee leaving the kitchen muttering to himself about what brand would be the best suited to fit Tony’s needs.
“Pathetic meg! I am going to fuck your cunt dry of orgasms and then BB is going to eat your hole until everyone can hear you screaming and begging for more.
It was easy enough to slip the drug into her glass, raising a toast to their success he watched as she downed the glass, cheeks flushing as he pulled her into an embrace, kissing her hard.  His hands tightened as she fought for dominance of the kiss, nipping at his lip as she thrust her tongue into his mouth, sharp nails digging into his biceps.  Using his serum enhanced strength, he pushed her back onto the bed, smirking as she bounced on the mattress arms and legs floundering for purchase, eyes widening in panic as she realized she could not control her limbs.  Reaching down he ripped off the silk sheath dress, tossing it to the floor, leaving her naked apart from her red lace thong and black, stiletto shoes.
Tony sobbed harder with every word he heard, there was no escaping his Alpha, part of him railed at this turn of events but a larger part seemed to yearn for the security that was being offered. He was so confused he was almost certain that it was the lack of air getting to his lungs that made him feel as though submitting was the best thing for him to do. How could he want something so badly that he had fought his whole life against.
Twink Tony became a fashion icon, and even walked a few runways, with Sir’s permission.  He fell in love with shoes and spent most of his allowance on designer heels. At least now when he was hanging from Steve’s knot he could look down and admire his latest purchase.
There is still a burning heat between his thighs and he knows that the second stage of bonding will begin the minute his Alpha’s knot deflates enough for him to slip free.  For now he is content to bask in the heady scent of alpha pheromones rolling of Steve.  He can’t help letting out a mewl of satisfaction when he feels Steve’s cock paint his insides once again with another load of cum.
Now present yourself for your nightly spanking, I will double the amount tonight and for the next five nights, perhaps it will make you focus on your task.
Growling quietly as he adjusted his hard cock, he flicked the screen of his Stark pad to show a real time view of the nursery.
“I think once we have fed our omega it is time to tell him what a traditional omega pregnancy entails, also that we will be initiating War Pack bonding once these pups are born and Thor has returned from Asgard, hopefully with omega Loki under his control.”
“Bruce will you help me with the initial examination, once we have ascertained the extent of his injuries a decision can be made on whether the Cradle will need to be used.  The rest of you can take a seat in the waiting room and we will come find you when we have the results through.”
Steve wondered how much the Wolf had comprehended but decided he would just go over it again when the soldier made an appearance.  Sometimes he wondered if he should have let the vet wipe him of the soldier, but he couldn’t bear the thought of killing off what little of Bucky might be hidden deep within.
Resting his hand over his omega’s belly he could feel how his cum had passed through the breeding hole pushing up hopefully the fertilized eggs and cum into the soft belly of his breeding pouch. The softened pouch of skin was starting to bulge with his cum, he could see the outline of his cock huge against his omega’s smaller frame and could feel his captured cockhead and knot being milked of every last drop of life giving cum.
The captain smirked as an idea came to mind.
Film evening with the Pack after bonding.
Steve and Bucky had fucked him until all his holes were dripping cum, then they had taken to shooting there loads all over his head and body, massaging it into his skin and hair drowning him in their scent until was a heaving sobbing mess, his tiny cock hard and aching as it rubbed against the underneath of his belly. His nipples chaffed raw by the back of the sofa.  Gasping and panting, drowning in alpha pheromones he had only been able to give one answer when finally ordered to come.
Two mirror rings of Steve’s sat nestled in the black silk along with a plain heavy hoop with three smaller ones and a number of small bars and balls. A linked chain curled round the edge of the box.  Tony watched as Bucky placed the rings on his fingers feeling them tighten and bond to his skin, he wondered when Bucky had managed to find the time to have them made and spelled. Having secured his hand to the headboard Bucky picked out the third ring dangling it in from of Tony’s face.
“No Bucky that’s not right, I am the Primary Alpha you don’t get to fuck me, it just not done!”
If his omega was feeling needy now, he would be extremely frantic and unbridled in his craving in a few hours.
Steve pushed Tony back onto the sofa head and arms placed on the low back, on his knees his arse thrust up and out. Gripping the base of the plug he started to work it out watching the ring of muscle stretch wider and wider straining to push out the massive plug, he could have had JARVIS reduce the size but where would be the fun in that, each tug elicited a whimper and whine from his shivering omega as it brushed against his prostrate.
“Mmmmmm, w….what the hell!  Steve you can’t be serious, this is not the time to act like a complete knot head.”
Poor Tony just wants out of the treatment room.
Pepper was too tired, and her throat still ached to do more that nod her head.  She would comply for now but once back at SI she would bring the full might of her lawyers down on the Clinic and Steve Rogers.  She pushed away her father’s disappointed voice, even though her stomach clenched with anxiety.
“Right there Tony, now fuck me with your fist. Don’t stop, oh my god! It feels so good, come on, harder!”
“There you go Doll doesn’t it feel better to admit the truth?  See, how having Steve and I make all the decisions, is much more beneficial to your wellbeing.  Omegas are too unstable and emotional to be allowed to make big decisions about their health, that’s why you need to be bonded to an Alpha.  Look at the mess all you unbonded omegas made with your idiotic Omega Rights Law, thank heavens all that is behind us now.”
Tony was beyond caring what he said, he just wanted a break from everything a chance to regroup and absorb all the changes in his life over the past few months.  Time to get used to his ever changing body and the tiny lives within.  Time to adjust fully both physically and mentally to his bond with Steve, the neediness and submissive desire it created within in him that was at war with his need also for independence and the right to have a say in his life.
Dinner was everything Betty thought it would be, whilst Darcy warmed the President’s cock, Betty sat with him and enjoyed his full attention as he wined and dined her.
Buck withdrew his fingers from Tony’s hole scooping up globs of cum before pushing his cum and slick soaked metal fingers in to Tony’s mouth.
Tony yawned widely as he rolled on to his side, his back ached along with his holes.  He needed to pee right away, standing up he started towards his bathroom, only to be bought up short by the cuff and chain round his wrist.
He cried himself to sleep, hand stroking the now tattered edge of his silk sheet, he dreamt of a large dark warrior striding across the plain, coming to rescue him.  When he woke in the morning there was a pair of silk stockings hanging in the back of the chair, on the chair was a small pot of scented oil.
There was only one answer that he knew she would accept, “Thanks, sounds yummy.”
“Come on doll, doctor’s orders got to fatten you up, make sure our pups get all the nutrients they need and that you keep a good layer of fat on your skinny bones.”
Bruce smiled as he watched Steve feed his omega the whole bowl of Pretzels, in between sips of his drink.  Tony accepted every mouthful and didn’t even protest when Steve cut up his pizza slices and hand fed him those as well.  By the time they had all eaten Tony’s stomach was straining against his omega drawers, the pearl buttons taut over his rolls.
“The stories of my sexual conquests both male and female maybe somewhat exaggerated, well actually the majority of them are in fact.  Even when Pepper and I were together we only had sex a few times, she never minded as she was always tired from her work as CEO and my nightmares kept her awake, so we often slept in separate rooms.
Pepper checked up on him each day by phone to make sure he was behaving and following the instructions left by his Alpha. She never really believed his answers and always spoke to JARVIS afterwards to get confirmation that he was being a good little omega.
Ms’ Potts several shades lighter than before, short slick backed hair style, and dark masculine pant suit caused a sensation, black patent leather loafers took the place of her usual killer heels, but the fashionistas noted the red soles, the trademark of Louis Vuitton shoes. Many also noticed the lack of jewelry and the barely there, make-up, the peach color on her lips a huge departure from her usual deep shades of lip stick.
Winter smirks as Tony Pup’s howls. Tears of frustration dripping from his huge eyes, the pupils blown with lust and need.
Now as you can see his pelvis has already softened and widened to help bear the weight of his pregnancy and his developing birth canal.  You will be pleased to know that his hips will stay like this even after his pregnancy giving him a much curvier figure. His tits will reduce in size once the pups are weaned but he will never have a flat chest again.
He was an omega and his body was exactly how it was meant to be and now he had two incredible reasons to embrace fully his journey to being the best omega possible and Steve would be with him every step of the way.
He watched as his cock breached the swollen ring again, each thrust caused a moan to break free from his Omega, he would always remember this first time when he proved his dominance and took possession of Tony body and soul, ending the free reign of the Omega no one had thought would ever be claimed or tamed.
Now let’s do your hair, I think I can get it into two small bunches then we can sit, and gossip and you can ask me any questions you want about being pregnant and giving birth. I know that it can by scary, oh, do you know how many pups you are carrying?”
“Steve, I don’t need a medical and I certainly do not want to visit the Compound, Happy can drive me back to my apartment.
Tony whimpers and writhes as Winter simultaneously tweaks his nipples, thick creamy milk leaking out to drip onto the yellowed papers beneath him, Winter bites down hard on the reddened teats, watching the omega’s eyes roll back as he is rocked by another orgasm, his honey sweet scent thick and heavy in the air.
Steve gathered up his omega as he clasped Thor’s hand, as shocked as he was at the God fucking his omega he thanked him for his blessing fully aware that as a God Thor could do as he pleased and Earth needed his continued protection.
He waited for his leash to be attached to his collar as normal, only to feel hands grabbing his dangling balls, pulling the up.  He felt two sharp jabs, then searing pain, that dragged a ragged cry from his ruined throat.
Steve ignored his omega’s response, pressing the sides of the bottle to squirt the shake in to Tony’s mouth until he had no choice but to swallow or choke on the thick liquid, he continued until the bottle was finished and then picked up another one.
I will always care about you but you are not my omega and quite frankly I am tired of all your mental and emotional shit, you will thank Steve and me one day for doing this.”
Natasha’s voice repeated the rules continuously in her ear, throughout the process of dying and washing her hair.  Then the others began to voice a long litany of sexual positions that Pepper/Sex Doll was to assume, there was also a new voice interspersed throughout that she couldn’t quite place, it was vaguely familiar but one she felt that she had not heard in years.
Chapter 51
The words had hardly left his mouth, before Sira’s hand repeatedly slapped his exposed clit until he could feel nothing but burning heat, that had him begging for her to stop.
“If you love Steve then why did you disobey two of his most important rules for you, ‘Never go anywhere on your own’ and ‘Never disobey Daddy Steve’.
After a thorough investigation of your medical records concerning both your physical and mental health since birth and many discussions with your husband and Ms Potts it is clear that your extreme lack of a normal childhood and the abuse suffered at the hands of Howard Stark have greatly impacted on your ability to function as an adult.
Chapter 17
Now l want you to be open and honest with Lydia, you can’t get better if you hide your thoughts and feelings.. I will be very disappointed if you do not tell her everything that is going on inside that big brain of yours.  If you are a good boy you will get a reward tonight, but remember bad boys get punished.”
The prize money had been stuffed down the front of his dress and tucked into his red silk garters.  After that it was a blur of champagne and dancing, strong arms picking him up, silk sheets and a warm body hugging him tight.  In the morning he had woken with a thumping head, sticky thighs and still wearing the stockings and French knickers.
Dr Banner and the Captain were the two who were the opposite to their counterparts. Banner and his alter ego Professor Hulk radiated confidence and power, this was no timid Bruce or raging Hulk.  She had met Banner for her medical and he had been scarcely competent and intense.  She had been intimidated by his creepily intrusive examination and questions but had managed to hold back her shudder of fear until he had left her to get dressed. Hours later she could still feel ghostlike fingers touching her.
Tony made fifty more portal devices—with launchers and remote detonators. Bruce helped out with them quietly and coaxed Tony into drinking some smelly herb tea. It was apparently good for him. (If it tasted like that, it had better be good for him…)
“Insults?!” Tony cried. “After I landed you on your ass three times?”
“Good thinking.” Steve revved the engine and grinned. “So, you coming?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s just like you said,” Bruce told him with a shrug.  “He’s
“That won’t be necessary, Mr. Stark,” she said briskly. “Eventually, you’ll need to give an interview, but--”
"Is that a good thing?" Steve asked hesitantly.
Perhaps Natasha was right: he just had to wait.
“Yeah.” Tony glared at it.
“I’ll be rooting for her.” Tony lifted his glass. “To Mirzakhani in 2014.”
“Well, yeah,” Clint admitted. “But really, the hot dog—the New York hot dog—deserves to be its own food group, because—”
“Or you could just take me,” Tony continued, in a soft sensual voice.  “Pull my hair and fuck my face, rough and fast.  Would you like that?  I would.”
“Hey, JARVIS? Ask the new guy to grab me some breakfast for the car, would ya? Gotta get this show on the road. And coffee! Lots of coffee!”
“Have you ever tried making it with cayenne pepper?” Bruce asked Steve, joining them in the kitchen.
“What’d they do then?” Cap gasped out, eyes bright.
“What are you waiting for?” Tony asked. Seriously, he’d been working on this thing non-stop (except for
Thanks so much for reading!  We finally got to the HULK!!!  Yay!
“Good to see you, Tony,” Steve said, trying to keep his voice casual and friendly. He forced a smile. “I was starting to wonder when I might run into you.”
Tony’s coffee had gone cold. He drank it anyway.
Bruce looked at him with open shock.
“Hi,” Steve purred.
“And give me a spotlight on the eyedrops.”
“Your lack of faith in my omelet skills wounds me to the core, Captain,” Tony said casually as he sauntered in. “What? Won’t even give me a chance?”
—on the coffee table and got to his feet.
Tony’s stomach plummeted.
woman things-- or being a woman's bad or anything! (Oh geeze.) Steve shook his head and tried not to sigh.
“Hey, Cap.”
“All right.” The words came out softly. “I-- I’d like that.”
“Coming, Nat,” Clint called, “cause, I’m not sure that killing the dragon automatically means you won that round.  The way I see it--”
“I don’t want to see him get hurt.”  Clint shook his head and tried to say it calmly: “So, just, back off, ok?”
Then Steve pulled off his dick suddenly.
Steve licked his lips and took a little step back. Tony stalked closer again, pressing his advantage.
Steve followed him, only barely managing not to trip all over himself in his eagerness.
Steve recoiled, eyes wide; he leapt to this feet.
“Will do!”
Steve shuddered.
Tony shook his head. Cap had projects of his own, right? Maybe he was working on something and didn’t want to get out of the groove. Well, Tony knew what that was like. He’d ask Steve about it next time he saw him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“As in ‘separate, but equal?’ ”  Tony asked pointedly. Rogers just looked more confused.
As they took their seats on brightly colored and beautifully embroidered floor cushions, Tony said, “Well, I really hope you like it.  Seemed like you might.  I mean, it isn’t Michelin rated haute cuisine or anything, but —“
“Yes,” Steve said, word hesitant.
“Yeah. Good idea.”
“Sorry?” Rogers said.
He’d almost forgotten how much he liked Rebecca. Shame they didn’t live in New York. And that she seldom had patience for society events unless they truly required her presence.
Tony drifted away from the kitchen as Mrs. Rhodes marshaled her troops and gave them their marching orders. She knew better than to let Tony cook—Christmas 1991 has pretty much put an end to that. (What? He’d paid for the damage!)
A tall Domme with broad shoulders and a shock of red-gold hair strode across the cafeteria towards them.
“Believe what you like, Stark,” Fury said sharply, then turned back to Bruce.

“AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!”
or whatever.”
(Concentrate. You just have to concentrate.)
(See the end of the chapter for
He left a large tip in the jar and made his way stealthily towards Steve, skirting the back of the bandstand to avoid attracting attention. Tony grinned at Steve as he approached, waving the Sam Adams at him. Steve’s answering smile was lovely, at once happy and relieved.
Bruce was famous for his anger—supposedly it was what had created the Hulk—but this was the first evidence of it Tony’d ever seen. It was startling, but not frightening, though maybe it should have been.
,” Rogers repeated.  He began gathering the dishes, and carrying them over to the sink.  He turned on the tap and put a stopper in.  The movements were the least coordinated Tony’d ever seen from the graceful Captain.  Tony swallowed.
“I mean it, Tones. Don’t.”
The door opened.
“What’s up, Cap?”
gone up.)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Tony’s breath caught and he gave another little shiver.  (
“Right.”
“No,” Tony said shortly, grateful that JARVIS at least silenced the comms before giving him
“J! Why would you do that?”
“I’ll meet you in the gym.”
(Now if he could just adjust this stupid fucker . . . then . . . then . . . )
(Yeah, don't interrupt. The country needs War Machine and Tony needs to feel like Rhodey will be safe. You can drop by with lunch tomorrow, Rogers.)
“Thank you.” She stepped wide around him, as though his clumsiness were so overwhelming he might bump into her again while standing still. “Well. Have a good day.”
“I might be amenable to that.”
“No,” Tony said, holding his hand up.  (Looks like firing a repulsor blast.  Huh.)
“Of course, sir.”
“Of course not,” Steve replied. “Bad for Captain America's image. Couldn't have a drunk Irish dad could he?” He shook his head. “Besides, people didn’t talk about things like that. Not the way they do now.”
Steve was smiling as he asked: “Tony? May I take you for an old fashioned date? Tonight?”
The creature wasn’t dead. As soon as Cap lowered his shield and turned away, it sprang up, spinneret shooting a web that dragged Cap into its grasping four top legs. He tried to smash at it with his shield. He couldn’t get a good shot, but managed to keep the shield between him and its fangs--at least for now.
“You are expected at the Safehouse in roughly an hour.”
“Princess Leia,” Rogers answered instantly.  “What a pistol!”
“I’m guessing that’s a no.” Tony brightened. “Maybe I should send her a--”
“Ouph.” Jackie made a sympathetic little sound.
When Steve was done drying him off (with typical Steve thoroughness), he scooped Tony up into his arms and carried him to the bedroom where the lights were down low. Tony pressed his cheek to Steve’s bare shoulder, content to be carried.
(And he could plant it in one of the satellites he already had, of course. That wouldn’t be too hard. Just a matter of adjusting the hatch . . .)
Tony struggled weakly. "Fuck you, Rogers, fuck you, you . . . you--"
“JARVIS, what’s the date?”
“Is that okay?” Steve asked falteringly, as if he might have pulled the chair out incorrectly or with sub-par skill.

(Down, boy.)
Tony relaxed into the mat again and closed his eyes. As soon as he caught his breath, he’d voice his surrender; since he’d played possum once already, Rogers probably wouldn’t let his guard down until then. Tony’s chest was still heaving a bit, but he was just getting ready to gasp out “I yield” or “you win, big guy” or “uncle!” when Rogers suddenly leapt off of him and backed away, putting distance between them.
“Pepper! Peps!  Switch of my soul!
“Fair enough, Dr. Banner,” Dominick said with a shrug, still looking only at Bruce.  “What have you and Stark come up with?”
—smiled.
(Weird, superhero normal.)
(Wait, emergency?)
Steve groaned. “Do we have to go?”
And it was absurd the way Tony’s heart jumped as he nodded and murmured
Steve spent another two days agonizing.
That got his attention. Steve snapped, “I slept for seventy years—don’t you think that’s enough?”
“Really?” Steve brightened.  “Great! See you then!”
Tony swallowed. The garage felt too warm.
Tony was grateful for the silence.
Tony fisted Steve’s hair and made Steve shudder, pleasure coursing through him.  His orgasm, Tony’s coarse words, the fist in his hair, the cock in his mouth—everything loose and warm and floating.  (Yes, Tony, yes!)
“Not the details,” Tony reassured. “Just—generally?”
“Where’s Cap?” Tony asked.
(Jim? Cap calls him
Chapter dedicated to thatwhichyeilds and all the kind and generous readers who have helped keep me motivated.  You are wonderful!
“Nope, sorry.  Got work to do for Stark Industries.”  He didn’t want to see Bruce’s disappointed face, so he turned and gave Rogers a little slap on the arm: “At ease, Captain.”
“Ready for part two?”  (Please!)  “Yeah, good.  You’ll like this part.  Bet you’d beg for it if I asked you to.”  Tony leaned back to rest on his heels.  “But you don’t have to.  Not now.  Now you can have my cock.  You want it, don’t you?”
“You’ve been so good, baby,” Tony whispered, running his fingers through Steve’s hair then down his neck and shoulders, then up his arms.  Steve was still looking a little out of it, eyes unfocused, dazed and distant.  “So perfect for me . . .”
Hill looked at him approvingly.  (Was
Bruce sounded bitter.  He always did when he was talking about the Hulk, even indirectly.
“Tony,” she said, obviously vexed, “when I started at Stark Industries, we manufactured
“Katie!” She fell silent. “We’ve been over this before. I don’t want some media circus at the Safehouse.”
“You could say that again,” Tony said with a laugh.
(Fuck.).  Tony shook his head and raised his hands.  Steve took a step back.
Tony grimaced as he threw back the last of his coffee—long since gone cold and bitter—and scowled at the sewing machine.
Steve stared at Tony’s note, thinking of those awful videos again.  He tried to imagine Tony saying those words to him in his sex voice, but still affectionate, calling him *those* sorts of names (whore! bitch!), dropping the nasty words in with his other filthy (but loving) bedroom talk . . . it was hard to imagine, but . . . He hit control+z and left them in along with “pretty little slut.”  Then crossed them out once more.  Then hit control+z again.  (Maybe . . .?)
Steve swallowed. His ears were
“Okay, Bruce!  Come check it out!”
“Not at all,” Tony answered with a smile. “I’m really not that fragile.”
The next day, when Steve came into the communal kitchen, he found Clint and Natasha drinking coffee together and speaking softly.  He nearly retreated, since it looked like a private moment, but he was never going to get to know his team properly if he didn’t try, so he took a deep breath and said, “Good morning.”
“Good boy,” Tony growled.  (
“This one has curry in it,” Steve protested, still squinting. “Or rosemary and maple.”
“And your check-in’s?”
“Oh, honey, you should see your face! It’s priceless.” He sounded terribly smug. “Darling, since your last visit I suspected you had feelings for the Captain. Just hoped he’d have sense enough to appreciate you. And anyone who watched Colbert with half a brain could guess exactly who he was talking about.”
“Give it a rest, Rhodes!” Tony cried in exasperation, throwing his hands in the air. “Cap’s been great. And I can take care of myself, you know. If he’d taken a step out of line, I’d have let him have it. And I sure as shit wouldn’t cover for him afterwards!”
Running on instinct, Tony crossed the room to stand beside the couch. Steve looked up, maybe a little surprised, but mostly he just seemed exhausted. Tony laid a hand on his shoulder and asked again, wishing he could come up with something better to say, “Steve? Are you sure you’re okay?”
Happy Valentine's Day!  I made you porn.  :-)
Tony wondered distantly how much input Carmichael’d had on Tony’s early contracts. (How can we get ahead of the Stark problem—the drinking, the slutting, the attitude? On a scale of one-to-ten, which of Stark’s bad habits would test lowest with Avengers related focus groups?)
“I’m not very good,” Steve said, starting to turn a blank page in front of it.
at all.)
“Yes, of course,” Steve said. He was surprised to find her in the Tower. (Or willingly talking to him—their last interaction had been far from cordial.) “What can I do for you, ma’am?”
The band was tuning up and around them people were leaving their seats and heading back to the  ballroom.
“Yeah, yeah.” Pepper shook her head. “I’ll head in to the office, then if . . . you’re sure you don’t need me.”
The nastiness of the internet was familiar to Tony—after all, his public infamy predated the internet itself—and he was pretty well inoculated, but he wondered about Cap again. As a kid or young teen, had anyone called him a bitch? A slag?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
equal.  I’m a liberationist—I believe in fundamental orientational equality, but that’s not a reality in the world we live in.”  Rogers gave an acknowledging nod.  Relieved, Tony continued, “There’s a hierarchy and subs are at the bottom.  In the dirty real world, pulling out a chair isn’t just pulling out a chair; it’s a reminder that I’m the weaker orientation. Those little gestures reinforce the idea that you’re the one with power and authority-- I’m your subordinate, designed for romance, fucking, and not much else.”
AND that it’s about something you called to tell her first.” Rhodey shook his head with clear disapproval.
Steve bobbed his head, sliding his mouth up and down Tony’s dick, loving the feel and taste of it in his mouth, against his tongue.
“Sorry, Tony,” Rhodey said, pulling himself to his feet. “Gotta get back out there.”
Tony hastened to comply.
(Shit.  Am I blushing?)
(Oh, fuck. But, Pep said they’d been optimistic and--) Tony’s heart was pounding. He’d
(thank heavens!), but there was an awkward little part of him that quite liked the idea of Tony as
“Pep! You’re early!”
“Now then,” she said, pulling back, “come with me and you can put your safeword into our StarkSafe.”
“ ‘bout time,” Clint said. He was sitting in the chair Natasha’d taken earlier, crutches at his side. His ankle was in a cast and elevated across another chair back.
“Shucks,” Steve said, snapping his fingers. “Saw right through me.”
Tony turned and headed for the exit.
The captain glances anxiously at the audience and admits to Colbert, leaning forward, “I still don’t know what those are.”
“All right,” Rogers agreed.
Tony stroked Steve’s face lightly with his fingertips, then reached back to tighten his fist in Steve’s hair.  Steve gasped and tilted his head back when Tony pulled.
“Yes, sir.”
“What if I throw in a new industrial sewing machine?”
“Would you excuse me, Tony?” Harry asked, with what seemed like sincere regret, adding
Steve blushed even more.  (Silly.)  Tony’s nice suit was stained and rumpled, his van dyke was in need of maintenance, and the dark circles under his eyes looked like bruises, but he was smiling one of his truly pleased smiles.
“Excellent! I’ll just let Jarvis know.”
“Not yet, but hey! Give me a little credit, I had a dozen of our top lawyers look at the thing.  You can see it too if you want, though, uh, technically I think that might be a security breach.”
was all it took to give him a little jolt.)
And then Steve was pressing wet little kisses against Tony’s neck and shoulder, across his chest, then down Tony’s stomach, and it was rapidly turning into an even better way to wake up.  Steve hovered, caressing Tony’s hips with his large hands.
Steve left the common area so fast he was practically running, holding his breath until he turned the corner.
“Yeah. I, uh--” Steve began. (Maybe now's the time...) “And I've been thinking about doing something a little more . . . structured.”
Barton nearly did a spit take; laughing and choking in equal measure.  The others looked vaguely disapproving.  And maybe confused.  Rogers looked confused a lot.
who would be honored.”
Steve tried very hard to be professional and not let her impassivity get to him.  (Is it a test?)  Somehow it was scarier on her than it was on Fury.  Steve took a deep breath and focused on his training report.
“Thank you, Tony,” Clint said, more earnest than Tony’d ever seen him. “This is really amazing.”
It was 3 in the morning and Tony was actually sleeping. Or he had been until JARVIS woke him.
Tony lunged.
Tony hummed and pressed back against Steve’s talented fingers. (Mmmm…) Long breaths in and out. (Besides, Steve had seen him kneeling to relax with Pepper, so he knew in theory Tony liked it.)
They stared at each other for a few long moments.
“Naturally, sir.”
“Sure, but how much time do people really hang out in the gym?”
Tony shrugged.  “I never thought about it much.  For me, it happened all at once, so I never wondered about shades of virginity.”  Steve raised his eyebrows, obviously curious, so Tony continued.  “It was a party at MIT.  I was drunk and sixteen, got kissed and got laid all on the same night.”  He smiled a little ruefully.  “What can I say, I was a teenager—it was over pretty quickly.”  Tony frowned.  “Mary?  Steph?  Who knows, but I’m pretty sure she was a biochemistry major.”
Pepper smelled it and let out an approving murmur.
Steve shifted his weight, looking down between their bodies to see his cock spreading Tony open; he ran his hand across Tony’s ass, then caressed Tony’s right leg and hiked it up higher.
. We’ll just quadruple my usual order.”
“Tony?” Steve said pulling back, brow furrowed.  He looked worried.
Pepper gave a tight nod and Tony chased after Steve.
I really hope you enjoyed the new chapter and, hey, if you did now would be an extra sweet lovely time to write me a comment to say 'hi' or leave me with your musings, loves, curiosities, favorite detail, or whatever.
“Katie, please,” she said, blushing bright Irish red.
“Answer me.”
Tony’s chest felt tight and his eyes stung—they were more alike than he’d known. She looked at him with the same haunted eyes he’d seen in the glass reflection of his workshop’s walls, that pleading look—
“Aye-aye, Captain.”
“What was going on with you yesterday?” Tony asked. His voice felt just a little too loud.
Tyrone turned with a smile to look at his daughter and noticed Tony staring at him. Tyrone nodded. Tony returned the nod and looked away.
There is a lot of world-building to do in the next few chapters and there will be more, so if there are some things that are unclear in this chapter they should become clearer as the narrative progresses…  Particularly there will be more about contracts.

“Dr. Banner,” Fury said, as if Tony hadn’t spoken, “we would prefer you to remain at SHEILD.”
He frowned then replied to Tony’s note:
Thank you all for the kindness and love!
