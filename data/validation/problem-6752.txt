“Clint you watch them and get them to medical. Thor, Hulk rally on my position and go through the debris.” He ordered them and ran into the wreckage. Thanks to the Hulk they were able to uncover several large chunks of concrete and pull Tony clear from the building. Steve's heart was hammering in his chest as he knelt down, his hand settling over the cracked glass of the dim arc reactor. Steve felt at a loss...he didn't know anything about Tony's tech which meant he didn't know how to help him. As if he were in a repeat of New York Steve only this time he was the one that ripped the faceplate from Tony's armor and gazed down at his pale unmoving face.
“No I mean it. This whole evening you have been nothing but perfect, exactly what I wanted in a model. You don't complain and you are...you're beautiful and I want to draw you. I could get you out of this life Tony I don't want strangers to have their way with you. Not like...not what we just did...I want that for myself. Only if you'd let me that is.” Steve said hopefully. He knew what he was proposing was a little crazy, and there would be a lot of negative talk about him for taking in a concubine.
Steve looked up at Tony their eyes meeting again and Tony gave a brief nod. Steve tentatively touched the tips of his fingers to the velvety skin of Tony's cock and gently stroked down the length to the base, grazing over his taught sac. He wrapped his hand around the base holding firmly, and leaned over with his lips parting, hot breath puffed over the sensitive skin. Tony dropped his head back his eyes closing, and his mouth fell open with a moan as the wet pressure of Steve's tongue trailed over the length of his cock. Steve closed his lips over the head and sucked. He could taste the salty bitterness of Tony's precum.
War is hell though...After Steve lost his friend he put all efforts into the final push against Schmidt and went after the man himself, his fortress high up in the mountains to the North in the biting cold. Steve overcame the crazed conqueror, but sadly was lost for decades in the icey waters after bringing down Schmidt's doomsday flying contraption.
“How much longer am I going to have to wait?” Steve asked, shoulders sagging. He felt that miserable weight settling over him again. The gloom that came with the knowledge that he wasn't out of the woods yet.
“We'll need lube and a condom.” If he was going to show Tony how to have sex he was going to show him how to be safe about it. Steve himself was immune to diseases and infections, but he didn't want Tony to ever risk contracting something.
Tony summoned up his energy and went for Thanos, the bleeding edge armor shifted into a heavier weapon and Tony charged it up. He boosted into the air at the last second and hovered in front of Thanos and fired off a shot, but at the same time Thanos summoned another blast of that purple energy. The combined energies forced them both backwards a few feet, but Tony recovered quickly, and he boosted forward again firing off repulser shot, after repulser shot, giving it his all to try and gain the upper hand. Thanos though charged in too and with his heavy fists battered Tony's armor repeatedly. The bleeding edge couldn't repair itself fast enough and he had already lost his connection to FRIDAY.
Tony glanced at the destruction around him, Titan had already seen the destructive force of Thanos' power If he and the Avengers couldn't stop him this would be the fate of Earth as well. Thanos stalked towards Tony, his gait long and confident, his heavy footfalls sending the dust up in clouds before him. Tony narrowed his eyes on the otherworldly being, he refused to give up even in the face of a hopeless battle such as this. It was all up to him now, Spiderman, and the Guardians were no where in sight, Dr. Strange's magic was no use against the energy of the stones. Their very realities could be shifted and manipulated by the power of the stones.
“There is nothing-what did you say?Beautiful? about it Steve.” Tony stated dryly. “It serves a purpose.”
One of the screens in the lab lit up in alarm and Okoye walked over to investigate. There was an incoming aircraft, unidentified heading their way. Her first instinct was to blow the thing sky high before it had a chance to breech their borders, but there was a chance it could be survivors, perhaps even the other individuals Rogers had mentioned. She hesitated, trying to keep her mind sharp and focused, she had no time to grieve, not yet. She hit the intercom to hail the airship.
“And as I said...I want to and I know you do too.” Tony bit his lip a moment and drew his eyes up to meet with Steve's so there would be no mistake in what he was asking for. “Fuck me Captain.”
“Go on, I'm ready, can't wait to feel you stretch and fuck me.” Steve bit back a moan at hearing that. He Moved Tony's legs further apart took himself in hand, and guided himself in, pushing past the tight ring of muscle. Steve slid all the way in until he was buried to the hilt, his balls pressed right up against Tony. They both took a moment to adjust, and acclimate to one another. Steve couldn't believe he was actually in Tony like this. His body was hot, tight, warm, and wet from the lube, it felt incredible. Steve set a hard pace right out the gate, driving his cock deep into Tony repeatedly, stroking over his prostate, and making him groan.
Steve blinked a bit in surprise but he laughed lightly and gazed down at Tony with a small smile. “Yeah? Well I doubt you would have liked me in my college days. Still a short scrawny kid plus...I was an art student. I didn't exactly hang out with you smarty pants science crowd.”
With the rush of the pollen in his system Steve wasn't capable of thinking clearly he succumbed to the fiery need. The throb of his cock was too much for him to ignore, he needed to come, he had never had such an intense need to come in his life. Steve gasped and panted and began to moan wantonly as he thrust his hips, the obscene amount of precome he was already leaking was sufficient enough to create a sweet glide between the fleshy appendages.
“Tony.” Steve called while sitting up from the bed, Tony paused on his way to the door and looked back at him. “...I never thanked you...for the drink.” He said with a smile. Tony laughed, a quick bark and he shook his head a moment gazed at Steve fondly.
Tony paused mid sentence his back was towards Steve. He turned slowly to look back at the Captain. “What?”
There was no worry about the noise, the penthouse was soundproofed enough that no one would hear a thing, but in a fit of pride Steve wanted the others to know. The sounds of passion the grunting, moaning, the unmistakable sound of men fucking, there would be no question what was happening in that room. Steve didn't hold any sound back and he took it as a compliment that Tony was incapable of staying quiet. Especially once Steve had reached his arm around Tony's middle and grasped his neglected cock.
Hands were suddenly stroking through Steve's hair, flesh and metal, they gripped into the locks tugging ever so slightly for Steve to just move. Steve hummed around Tony's cock and took him in deeper. Steve apparently was blessed with a very controlled gag reflex, he took Tony's cock fully into his mouth and deep-throated to the base, saliva leaking into his beard and over his chin. The course hair scraped and scratched against Tony's balls and groin. That would probably burn in the morning but Tony didn't care, it would only serve as a reminder of this night.
“I'll give you a massage tomorrow, and maybe a nice hot bath will help.” Steve whispered sweetly in Tony's ear. “Sleep now okay?” Tony nodded against him and let his heavy lids droop closed. Soon Tony's breathing had evened out into a deep and steady rhythm. Steve stayed awake for awhile letting his mind filter through everything that had just happened. He had overstepped his boundaries, he was supposed to be a guardian, a possible even parental figure. Steve couldn't help but feel that he had somehow failed Tony by giving into his primal needs. Sill he had rather enjoyed all of it, and the idea of Tony experiencing that with anyone else made Steve feel a hint of possessive jealousy. He couldn't tie Tony down in that way though, anything exclusive would surely expose them and he had no clue what kind of hell storm that would bring about for the two of them. This was safer, it was smarter.
Tony went back to the tower after his meeting with Pepper. He had taken the time to think it over and came to the conclusion that perhaps he had overreacted that morning. Steve was an understanding kind of guy maybe they could set some ground rules and take things slow. Once Tony arrived he asked Jarvis for Steve's location, and was directed to the gym.
“Am I early my lord?” The man asked, apparently Steve had simply been standing there gawking for an uncomfortably long time.
Steve reveled in the moans from Tony it was the hottest sound he had ever heard and it drove him. He plunged his cock deep into Tony, watching it pump in and out of the other man's body at a near frantic pace. Steve's balls felt tight and ached with need for release as the heat in his core, deep in his groin burned hot with his approaching climax. The pressure steadily built up, faster, faster he was so close. Steve fucked Tony with a renewed vigor, desperate to reach that sweet release. Steve was moaning with every one of his thrusts, it all felt so good he was completely at the mercy of his baser instincts. All he could focus on was the pleasure building, the glide of his cock into the tight heat, and growing ache in his already taught sac.
Steve had to be thorough, and always insisted on taking the time to prep Tony properly for fear of hurting him. Tony had grown accustomed to receiving the mass that was Steve's cock, but the initial penetration was always intense and somewhat uncomfortable. There was always that moment of doubt that this time he'd have to tell him to stop, that his body just wasn't ready for it, but Steve would always move slow to give Tony time to acclimate. He would move and push in, his length sliding deliciously into Tony's channel until he would seat himself fully, and Tony would feel the depth, the fullness of the man's heavy and thick cock inside of him.
Tony cried out and shuddered beneath Steve's grasp. He felt so full, so used, but he didn't feel ashamed of it anymore. This was what he was made for and he loved to feel Steve in his body, the stretch and burn was welcome as it was replaced by the intensity of pleasure from his prostate. Steve took Tony at a brutal hard pace, knowing that Tony was a bit of masochist. His rock hard cock shoved into Tony's body, angling just right to strike that sweat spot that made Tony moan and whimper.
Steve hooked his fingers into the band of his boxers and tugged them down freeing his hardened dick from it's fabric confines. It curved up hard and aching, the head leaking onto his belly in anticipation. Steve took his cock in hand, swiping his thumb along the tip to collect the precome and slide it down over his length. He imagined Tony dropping to his knees, calloused hands easing up and down his sides to grasp tightly to his ass as he pressed kisses to his groin, letting out muffled moans of desire. With a gasp Steve took himself firmly in hand and gave himself a long stroke up. Steve spread his legs a bit further feeling the shame of being so exposed it made him feel dirty, but he couldn't help himself he thrust his hips up into his tightening fist as he fantasized about the brunette genius taking him into his mouth and sucking him with earnest.
Tony just stood there dumbfounded...hand going up to touch his lips. Steve had just kissed him. He used that commanding Captain America voice of his, and damn if it hadn't made Tony weak in the knees, and his cock a little hard. Tony shook his head, just a game. Steve was trying to get the upper hand, make him falter-no Tony wouldn't give in that easily. He tugged at his tie, loosening it up some as he walked to the rental car and got in. He wasn't expecting Steve to actually show at the hotel, but maybe Steve would just to confirm the win for that kiss. Tony would be ready. He drove back to the hotel and went up to his room. First going to the bathroom to splash some cold water on his face.
Steve stirred in the bed when he heard movement and the warmth in the space beside him had suddenly vanished. Steve reached over feeling over the empty spot and cracked an eye open. His sleepy vision cleared up and he focused in on Tony who was disappearing behind the bathroom door, and he heard the sound of running water from the shower. Steve rolled over onto his back and stretched his limbs and rested languidly in the bed. The images and memories of the previous day's activities floated up in his mind and he smiled lightly. Steve felt the warmth of arousal settle in his groin as he recalled it all, Tony all wet, covered in his own slick and begging for Steve to take him. Steve's cock was beginning to harden and ache for a touch.
Did he remember? Tony wasn't certain he could trust his own memory, but the soft petting of Steve's hand through his hair, the warmth and closeness of the man he adored settled Tony down. He did remember, Thanos talking of how he would ruin Tony's mind with the stones. Force him to question reality and forever live in doubt of his existence. Even if Thanos hadn't fully succeeded Tony hated that it still plagued him to this day. Steve's lips pressed softly to the side of Tony's cheek.
The two of them tumbled into Tony's bed and he took her from behind. Tony held her hips and thrust himself roughly into her, but he was no where closer to reaching climax after several minutes of pumping his cock.
“You are too...I mean...I don't know if I'd use pretty, but well not that you aren't...I...Uh” Steve fumbled. It didn't seem proper to call another man pretty, but he felt that Tony was owed some compliment. Tony smirked there was a playful light in his eyes.
Steve gave a slow nod and waited for Bruce to continue. He knew all of this already they had discovered his natural resistances to drugs back in the 40's.
Steve nodded and arched his back slightly while his breath hitched. “Y-yes don't stop!” His entire body was quaking with the pent up energy, his arousal winding tighter and tighter like a hot coil ready to release in an explosive orgasm. After so long of reaching this point Steve wanted-no-needed to come he needed Tony to push him over that edge. Steve's hips were thrusting in a desperate need to drive Tony's fingers deeper and harder into his ass. The movement was nearly instinctual at this point, it felt so good to move and rock his hips in the natural rhythm associated with love-making, with fucking.
“S-Security footage...” Tony gasped out. “I can get the footage...any angle we want if-if you want me to-nngh-see more.”
way before. Okay that was a bit of a lie he had noted that Steve was attractive, but Tony hadn't considered Steve as a viable option as a partner.
Steve ventured lower, gently pressing soft kisses over the newest forming scar on Tony's side. The one that nearly took Tony from him forever. Steve exhaled slowly and ran his hand over it carefully, a promise to make up for it. Further down he moved, the bristles of his beard scraped wonderfully against Tony's skin as he trailed his lips and tongue along muscled thighs. Steve's mouth and tongue were hot and wet and it had Tony panting, his hips shifting rhythmically in want.
“I do know, I've wanted it for so long. Please.” He breathed his eyes pleading as he leaned forward just a bit making his intent clear. Steve didn't stop him, as much as he told himself over and over that he should, that he couldn't do this with Tony. Their lips met and they kissed. Light and fleeting at first, Tony pulled back his eyes wide in surprise with his breath hitching in his throat. Then they delved in for more Steve's hands going up to stroke though Tony's hair and hold him there as his tongue delved into the young man's mouth.
Steve kissed and nipped at Tony's neck unable to stop himself he just wanted to touch and taste every bit of him. He was a beautiful sensual creature and Steve wanted, oh he wanted so much. Tony hummed pleasantly and settled his hands in Steve's hair pulling him back for a moment to meet his eyes.
Steve knew he was due back at the hotel to meet with the others in a few hours, but he needed to get away for awhile. Ever since he had left Bucky in Wakanda, and busting the others out of confinement he felt as if he had been moving at a nonstop pace without a chance to breath. He knew this was a risk being out in public, he was a wanted criminal, and it wasn't just Ross looking for him. The entire united nations had eyes out for him, and the others.
A fiery heat ignited in his body, sudden all at once. Steve nearly dropped down to a knee from the intensity of it, it felt as if his very nerve endings were on fire. It was so strong, a burning so hot all over his body. In alarm Steve wondered if this was a poison doing its work, and the centipede would soon claim him as its prey. Only the heat wasn't turning into a crippling pain as he was expecting. No this was a different rush of agony the pleasurable kind, a throbbing need that pulsed deep within his core.
Steve looked up over his tablet and tapped the screen a few times. “It's actually rather remarkable.” Bruce began, he realized how that sounded when Steve raised a skeptical eyebrow. “From a biological view was what I meant.” Bruce continued “That bug possess an incredibly potent pheromone. We don't know why Hydra was researching this creature, or if they were the ones to engineer it. Now in our experience the serum in your body counteracts all toxins at a superhuman level. That's why you don't get sick, you can't be poisoned you don't get drunk. Your ability to metabolize at such a rapid rate renders most, nearly all, outside substances innate. Even to keep you sedated we have to give you what would be considered lethal for normal people. Except for this pheromone.”
“A few.” Steve answered without going into detail he knew that Tony was probing for information and he wasn't foolish enough to fall for that.
Steve turned his head, panting and moaning as he rocked his own hips and used the bugs appendages as his own personal sex toy. “Ah-ah-ah!” Steve was moaning with each deep thrust of the shaft into his body the tip rubbing deliciously over his pleasure spot. The legs enclosed over his own cock squeezed him and the motion of his own rutting rubbed his length along the soft ridges. Steve felt nearly delirious with the pleasure coursing through him, from the sensation wrapped around his cock to the jolting, almost electric waves from the prodding of his prostate.
“So...hear me out Steve.” Tony murmured while he stilled Steve's rutting. “I have some more work to do with the centipede, but I think I have a solution to your problem. Give me a little more time and then I promise I will help you. No one else has to know about any of this, it will only be you and me.”
It didn't get better. If anything it only became worse as Steve would be caught off guard by it. The memories would pop into his mind when he was bored or allowed his mind to drift and it always returned to the night with the centipede. He hyper-focused on the moments with Tony, and at times Steve could recall the musky scent of Tony's arousal and the taste of the man's precome on his tongue. Sometimes he felt a dull ache inside, a need to have Tony behind him again and filling his ass, pumping into his channel and spilling his load inside.
“No-No I can take it...keep going just-just give me a minute.” Tony closed his eyes and exhaled out slowly as his body acclimated to the intrusion. After a few moments Tony gave Steve a brief nod for him to keep going. Steve aimed for that pleasure spot again hoping to distract Tony from the discomfort. It worked. Tony cried out, his hips bucking involuntarily as Steve caressed and prodded the bundle of nerves. It got easier, Tony still felt the ache but it was duller and more manageable he could handle it as long as he had this pleasure to take his mind off of it.
Now Sam was suggesting that he invite one to his chamber to act as a model for an evening. Which meant conversation to keep them at least somewhat entertained as they sat for him, and what would he talk about with a concubine? Tell me about your work? What do you do in your free time? If it led to anything of their bedroom activities would they ask about his experience?
“I can handle the flirting just...” He reached out for Tony to run his hands down Tony's bare arms, and take Tony's hands in his own, rubbing small circles with his thumbs.“I want you to be mine...call it what you want. Stupid alpha instinct. I just don't want anyone else to have you like I did.” Steve admitted with a light blush warming his cheeks. That day, sharing Tony's heat had been the most erotic and intimate experiences of Steve's life. He couldn't stand the thought of anyone else having that wonderful and private entry into Tony's most guarded and private secret.
There were muffled noises from down the hall, maybe he could hear Bruce talking with Tony in one of the other rooms. Steve grabbed the pillow and covered his head with it and tried to shut out the world around him. Maybe this problem of his was a lingering side affect after the fact, it would lessen with time it had to. The guilt he felt over the whole situation was enough to ruin sex forever, but every time he pictured it, despite the self loathing, his cock grew hard at the memories.
“Ah! Steve!” Tony reached down, both hands groping Steve's ass and pulling him closer. They rutted against one another, moaning and kissing Tony could already feel the tension and need in his body growing ever closer to orgasm. He didn't want this to end so soon, he wanted sex, he wanted to know what real sex was like. “Stop-stop wait” Steve backed off fearing that maybe he had hurt him somehow. Tony continued “...I-I want, I want you to be in me...when I...” Tony caught was breath and tried to will his heart to slow. “I want to know what it feels like to have your cock in me when I come.”
Once they parted Steve took in a heavy breath and he met Tony's eyes, which were dilated in arousal. Steve smiled at him and pressed another soft kiss to Tony's lips. He enjoyed hearing Tony's quiet gasp when he tightened his grip in the man's hair, and nuzzled against him inhaling his scent. Steve could smell Tony's excitement and it made his own cock stir in interest making him shift slightly on the couch. They kissed again the heat and tension increasing steadily between them this time as Tony broke away he breathed. “Alpha...” Steve smiled and carded his fingers through Tony's hair
Steve worked Tony's hole loose, stretching him to make sure he was good and ready. When he believed Tony was fully prepped he pulled his fingers out and gave Tony another heated kiss. “You think you're ready for me?”
“Well we're going to die with regrets because there is no changing what happened! They are dead, they are all dead and we are left to figure out whatever this endgame is for ourselves with no help, no-whatever! Steve what are you doing?” Steve had stepped into Tony's space his arms coming up around him. “What the?” Tony moved to shove him back, but Steve caught both of Tony's wrists in his hands.
“You feel so good.” Tony continued. “Tight and warm. You were made for this, to be fucked.” He assisted the best he could with lifting Steve up off his cock and sinking back down. The room was permeated with the wicked sounds of wet flesh slapping together, Steve's thighs were coated in lube and sweat as he sank down onto Tony. The cheeks of his ass clapping against the top of Tony's thighs as he rode him harder. Both men moaning together with every shift and slide of their bodies. Steve's cock was bouncing with his rise and fall, bobbing in rhythm with his every move.
Steve's eyes darted from the hand to Tony's face. “I didn't want you to think I was put off by it. It's really incredible, like your armor, but it isn't the same this is really sleek looking.” He trailed his fingers up from the wrist, past the elbow joints and gently rubbed soothing circles over the attachment rig on Tony's bicep.
Tony smiled down at him briefly and leaned down near Steve's ear and moved his hands from Steve's shoulders down to the front of his broad chest. “You know you don't need an excuse to get my hands on you Steve.” Tony whispered and kissed his ear which made Steve shiver pleasantly.
“Cap I can handle this.” Tony stated as the blonde approached him. He saw Steve's eyes wandering over him and Tony could almost feel his skin crawl in shame. Steve let out a slow breath at the sight. The arc reactor was chrome silver and sat flush with Tony's skin. Only the flesh around it was scarred. The scars extended out in all directions in a star like pattern around the device. One of the machines blared as the blue light flickered off and Steve became alarmed.
“I don't think you are sick, or deranged. What happened to us, it's unusual it could be described as horrific for some but I honestly don't get that feeling when I think back on it. We're Avengers we take these things in stride.”
“Well, Tony...” Steve repeated the name, he liked that name and how to easily rolled off his tongue. “For starters I want to do some warm ups and just focus on a few parts.”
“Yeah you are. God Tony I'm gonna make you feel so good.” Steve's voice was husky, a deep rumble in his chest and made Tony squirm with want.
“Yeah I suppose you're right.” Tony didn't really know why he was being so open and honest with Steve. Maybe it was the alcohol, maybe it was just Steve was so open minded that he could talk about these issues. He sat up and turned sitting cross legged on the bed and facing Steve, the booze making him feel bold. “I wish I could meet someone like you to show me.”
When Tony came, messily between their bodies he went limp against the bed as Steve finished off himself with a few more rough thrusts. They kissed again, quick and sloppy as they caught their breath. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve's neck to keep him in place, his brown eyes meeting with Steve's blues. The moonlight was filtering in through the windows casting Steve's sweat slicked skin in a heavenly beautiful glow. Tony's breath caught for a moment, at how this could possibly be his life. The emotion swelled inside of him, the warmth enveloping his very being.
Steve didn't respond right away, just frowned slightly and his brow furrowed as he examined the robotic replacement for Tony's arm.“Why'd you do it Tony?” Steve asked in a quiet disbelieving tone. Tony gave him a quizzical look as that was a bit of a loaded question. Did what exactly? He wanted to ask. Sign the accords, try to kill Bucky, replace the arc reactor? follow Thanos' Black Order into space and land on Titan? Accidentally involve some 16 year old kid into his battle? There were a number of answers that Tony had to that question. Steve though finally clarified after a brief uncomfortable pause. “Why did you cut your own arm off?”
Steve watched as Tony traced the scotch along his bottom lip his eyes followed the motion of his finger and swiped his own tongue along his lower lip in response. Tony knew how to pull the seduction card, and Steve was a little shocked that he was playing along with it as much as he was. There was no way that this game would end well for either of them, but he was curious just how far Tony would push before he called it off himself.
“Perfect...so nice.” Steve praised as he ran his hands over the firm globes of Tony's backside, massaging and groping the heated flesh. “I can't believe you want me to do this with you Tony...you could have anyone.” Steve whispered as he lined himself up. He had his left hand on Tony's hip and gripped his shaft with his right to guide himself in.
“Since always actually.” Tony replied casually. “It's Jarvis that handles all that. It's a sort of safety precaution in case anyone begins to act out of the ordinary. He monitors routines and looks for behavior that is unusual. According to Jarvis these late night gym visits are not typical for you.” Steve could hear the subtle footsteps of Tony's sneakers across the gym floor as he drew closer to him. Tony continued “Not that anyone would blame you for needing time to return to whatever had been normal before.”
There was a sharp inhale from Tony at that action. He wasn't used to someone actually paying attention to the arc reactor. Pepper had always politely ignored it.
“That-that feel good?” Tony whispered and he continued to rub his palm over the hard bulge in Steve's pants.
“It's okay to want things that may not seem entirely appropriate.” Tony moved in closer, and Steve's breath caught. He could feel the warmth of Tony's body close to his, the proximity only made him feel hazy with want. His cock twitched with excitement as a wave of arousal rushed over him and centered into a throbbing heat in his groin.
Tony remarkably found that he was still hard which should have been impossible, but something in that pollen apparently had blessed both himself and Steve with no refractory period. Steve had sighed contently beneath him, even with Tony's cock still buried balls deep inside of him. The centipede pulled away, its own protruding shaft slid out of Tony, and it wriggled itself beneath Steve. It flipped with itself belly side up its pincers and gaping maw beneath Steve's own cock, its opposite end lifted up in front of Steve's face. The centipede's penis pulsed and throbbed while more fluid flowed freely from the tip.
Steve had to draw it, he had to capture this sexy, dirty image. He set to work drawing in the detail of Tony's most private area. Steve never imagined he'd be doing this, enthusiastically, drawing in a man's erection, wondering what it felt like...the weight of it in his hand, the silky smoothness of the skin. Steve swiped his tongue over his lips, thinking of what a man's cock tasted like. That bead of fluid forming at the tip and dribbling down, pooling onto Tony's stomach. The arousal was heavy in the air Steve could smell it, so masculine, natural, he craved for a touch to Tony's skin as he etched in the lines and shadow on Tony's manhood
Steve only distantly heard the conversation but the words registered in his head slowly. Rocket had mentioned before something about hacking, and blood on the work table.
“Your system hyper-metabolized this pheromone. The serum didn't attack it like it was a harmful foreign substance, like alcohol, drugs or caffeine, your system welcomed it. As far as your body could tell you were experiencing a normal and healthy rise in adrenaline and dopamine. You went under this spell, so to speak, so rapidly because of how the serum normally functions. The second you stepped into the lab you were compromised it would have just been a matter of time.”
Steve had kept Tony on edge for so long, he had done so well for him that night. He had let Steve push him completely out of his comfort zone. Stev wrapped his hand around Tony's cock and stroked him, working up to the pace they had been at before. Tony shuddered, he braced his hands on Steve's chest and a stream of incoherent noises left his mouth. He felt raw and used and so close to his orgasm he didn't care about anything else. Steve's hand felt so good, the perfect amount of pressure along his shaft as the head of Steve;s cock rubbed up against Tony's prostate.
“We split and I don't know where they ended up, they were gonna grab the stone from KnowWhere but he obvious had all six so...I don't even know if any of them are alive.” Rocket explained.
"I-I think I think we are way too clothed for this now." Tony panted as he leaned up and gave Steve a quick kiss. "I wanna see all of you." He said tugging on the hem of Steve's shirt. Steve smirked then sat up, and pulled his shirt off tossing it to the side. He then assisted Tony in the removal of the rest of his clothing, they both laid togeher on the hotel bed naked and looking over each other.
“My alpha, please...I-I'm so...” Tony swallowed and forced the words out. “I'm so...wet...and open for you.”
Tony was still pumping his own cock with his fist watching Steve's ecstasy. Once Steve came back to himself he looked over the man still straddling his waist and his eyes trailed to the thick hard cock, Steve reached down and wrapped his own hand around Tony's length and assisted in jerking him off. The angle of his wrist was a little uncomfortable in their position, but he wanted to help he wanted to see Tony come. Tony's breath was coming out in harsh quick pants that quickened the closer he got, he let out a moan and his body jerked and tenses as he reached his own climax and came over Steve's abdomen.
Tony could see his own come leaking from Steve's used hole, it was filthy, wonderful sight. The centipede surrounded Steve as it had when Tony had first entered the workshop, its head shuffled down between Steve's legs as the rest of its body coiled around him. The pincers prodded and examined, the soft wet mouth suckled down along Steve's thigh. A few of the legs gripped at Steve's shoulder and dug into his skin as the mouth continued its exploration. The sucker like mouth grazed past Steve's cock and below his balls, lower and lower. Steve let out a surprised gasp that turned into a drawn out moan as the centipede latched onto his leaking rim.
“It looks like an arthropod of some kind possibly Myriapoda.” Bruce observed. The others gave him blank stares. “Look at how the body is segmented and it has a pair of legs per segment, it's probably some species of centipede but...”
Steve's hands tensed in Tony's and he had to bite his lip to stop any noise that may escape. Tony was staring up at Steve and he was breathing in deeply. Tony could sense Steve's arousal. An alpha sexually aroused could give off certain signals like an omega could but they could be more subtle depending on the alpha. Tony closed his eyes as he inhaled the scent of need thick in the air.
“Think you could uh...get me a towel...or...” Tony sat up and glanced over to Steve and the drying spatter of his semen on his chest.
“I didn't meant to upset you.” Steve said hurriedly. “Look I know you are supposed to serve whoever lord Pierce offers you to, but let's just say that he owes me a favor, in fact everyone here owes me for what I have done in service with the king's army.” Steve had sat up too and placed his hand on Tony's arm. “I want you to be exclusive to me, as my model and I won't touch you or anything unless it is something you want.”
The veil ended just at the base of the neck where more glittery gold chains hung against smooth olive skin. He was bare chested and Steve couldn't stop his eyes from focusing in on the golden hoop piercing in the man's left nipple. Steve's mouth felt dry and he had to swallow to moisten the sudden parched feeling in his throat. This concubine was fit, but lean, not scrawny by any means. He had strong looking shoulders and arms, and while his chest and abs weren't as sculpted as Steve's he could appreciate the subtle contours that spoke of hard work and effort. Bands of gold adorned his arms and wrists, slender hoops,that clinked together with the movement of his arms.
Steve scowled at Tony and opened his mouth to respond when Bruce spoke up. “I'm kind of with Tony on this one. If Hydra was interested in it would it be so bad if we studied it ourselves in a controlled environment? Maybe once we gather some data we will be more informed to make a factual based decision.”
“I appreciate it none-the-less. Now you, get on the bed and get comfortable.” Steve did as he was told feeling a nervous excited energy buzzing under his skin. He should feel...more uneasy about this but he didn't, he had never wanted a man like this but right then it didn't matter it didn't bother him. Tony was a concubine this was his profession he was simply using a service as it was meant, and Tony wanted him to use it.
“We managed to survive, for some reason we were spared. I don't know what for or if we can ever hope to reverse it. At least...I...” He pressed a gently kiss to Tony's cheek. “At least I had the chance to be honest with you and share this with you. Even if it's just for tonight.”
“Please-please Tony!” Steve begged as moved his hips, rubbing his rear against Tony's dripping cock. Tony was breathing heavily, his fingers tightened their grip on Steve's hips as he watched the captain acting so lewd, so unlike himself but it was such a turn on. The normally clean-cut, reserved man that was Steve Rogers reduced to acting like a cock-hungry slut, it made Tony's dick throb. Behind him the centipede clicked its pincers and crawled up close to Tony, the legs splayed out and rubbed and caressed at his warm skin along his back and hooked around his shoulders. The underbelly was warm and velvety soft its body rippled and flexed against Tony's back.
Steve's breath caught. Tony really was a handsome man. He had facial hair, dark, and sculpted to meticulous perfection. It accentuated the shape of his jaw and chin and created a picture perfect specimen of male beauty. Then the corner of Tony's mouth had lifted in a self satisfied smirk, he knew that Steve was admiring him and basked in it. Steve had to mentally chastise himself for staring and tore his gaze away from Tony and back to his blank paper.
“No...I do...” Steve remained seated on the bed with Tony standing between his legs, and his hands on Steve's shoulders. “because I want you to know how I feel and I want you to believe me when I say-” Steve settled his hand over Tony's arc reactor. “...you are a beautiful, genius of a man.”
“This can't be...No...I...” Tony sat up on his knees and ran his hands through his hair. He couldn't remember there was too much in his head, too many memories that conflicted and made no sense together. Tony looked up at Thanos in anguish. Had it all been fake? The life he had built with Steve was it only a fantasy he had conjured up?
“Tony you don't disappoint me.” Steve replied and kissed his cheek. “I know this isn't easy, but having a negative attitude will only make matters worse. Come on...” Steve nudged him so Tony would look at him.
Steve thrust his hips more haphazardly, his cries of pleasure growing in their intensity as his cock was stroked, pulled, squeezed in the warm embrace of the monster bug. Steve's balls tightened and his cock began to pulse with his come spurting out in long white ropes splashing across the underbelly of the centipede. The orgasm was ripped from him almost savagely, his mouth fell open in a silent scream for several beats before he found his voice again. The centipede released its webbing from Steve and he fell to his knees now straddling the bug as he caught his breath.
“Yes it is...we're all still human. You're not alright Steve, hell I'm not alright and seeing this happen to us to our team. We can't let this break us, tell someone what is really bothering you and maybe once you understand the cause we can all move forward.”
Tony laid back on the floor and felt his eyes drifting closed, the fatigue setting in. If he could just rest for a minute...that was all he needed, and then he could figure out what Thor was doing there. Just...for...a...minute. Tony passed out, his body completely worn out from the experience. Steve too was feeling drawn towards some much needed sleep. He relaxed next to Tony on the workshop floor, still a mess, a combination of bodily fluids smeared across his abdomen, face and leaking from his ass.
Steve's breath was coming out in harsh panting gasps, he had just experienced two mind blowing orgasms and it was taking a moment for his senses to return. For a brief moment his vision seemed to clear and the clarity of his position solidified through the haze. He was partially naked on the floor of Tony's lab, his cock wet and dripping with his own come, having been stroked and pulled off by a gigantic centipede. As if sensing Steve's better senses had been returning the centipede scuttled across the floor towards him and released another puff of its heat inducing pollen. Steve coughed again trying not to breath it in but it permeated the air around him, and he was still trying to catch his breath from before.
The wet sound of skin on leather filled the quiet of the room, Tony's breath wasn't to the point of labored panting, but was coming out shaky and strained. This is what it would feel like to have Steve jerk him off while in uniform and the knowledge of that made his cock grow even harder in his hand, he nearly came, a small spurt of precome spilled from the tip onto his stomach. Tony squeezed hard at the base to back himself from the edge he nearly tipped over.
Tony looked off to the side and focused on the wall for several long seconds. Was it? He hadn't told anyone...he had experimented but the words hadn't crossed his lips for fear of rejection. Rhodey didn't even know. Tony's heart was hammering in his chest as he thought about what to say and how to say it. Was he bisexual? Gay? Straight and just going through a phase? He really had no clue. The few experiences he had with other guys had left him wanting to know more. He masturbated frequently to thoughts of men, women still aroused him just as much, but there was also a certain individual that permeated his sexual fantasies, and he was here in this room with Tony.
"Hm good looking fella like you in a place like this and you weren't expecting someone to try and snatch you up?" Tony smirked he wanted to see if he could rile him up a bit, see how long Steve would go along with this, because now that Tony thought about it, had he seen someone like Steve sitting alone in a bar he would try his luck in taking them home. Obviously that wasn't going to happen, not with where they had left things before, not with how the Avengers had fallen apart, but for now they could pretend that wasn't them. That didn't happen to these two strangers meeting for the first time, so there was no harm in having a little fun now.
There was a long pause before Jarvis responded. “...Indeed Captain that is a compelling argument and as I am inclined to ensure Sir's safety and health I cannot deny you entry.” The door clicked open and Steve smiled in satisfaction.
“It's okay Steve, I know government work and super secret stuff you're not allowed to tell me.” In all honesty it had hurt the most when Steve had written to him and broke the news that he wouldn't be back stateside in time for the graduation. Tony hadn't been surprised by his parents unable to attend, but Steve had been the one that upset him most. At least he was apologizing. “It was boring anyways, lots of talking and sitting and more sitting and more stuffy old people droning on and on. Seriously it was a massive bore.”
“You seem awfully preoccupied with this.” Tony said, indicating the robotic replacement. He spread the fingers apart and Steve traced them with is own.
The red head narrowed her eyes on him and tapped a pen on her desk. “You know most heats last for a few days...unless you have an alpha or beta to-”
“It is.” Tony replied softly. Steve trailed his fingers down Tony's thigh and lightly grazed the tips over the smooth velvety skin of Tony's sac noting how Tony kept himself shaved and trimmed. He wasn't completely bare, which Steve liked. He wanted to think of Tony as a man, and men had hair, but he enjoyed the smoothness of Tony's balls as he lightly cupped them in his hand. Tony's breath hitched and he would gasp quietly as Steve explored him. Steve ran his fingers up from Tony's balls and along his shaft from the base to the tip making Tony shiver. He gave Tony's cock a light stroke with his hand and watched the brunette moan and buck his hips, more fluid collected at the tip and dribbled down.
No, even from the shock and pain Tony wasn't going to give up. He stood grimacing, holding his left arm in his right, and stumbled forward towards the alien conqueror. “There was an idea...” Tony stated wearily. “To bring together...a group of remarkable people.” Thanos had paused and turned back, Tony felt unbalanced, he winced from the pain but continued forward. “To work together when needed, to fight the battles that others never could.” Tony stood before Thanos, himself beaten and weak, injured, his armor failing, but every bit as defiant as ever. Tony took a halting breathing and stared at Thanos with his fierce eyes. “I'll die believing in that...in heroes...because if we cannot save the earth you can be damn sure we'll avenge it!” Tony activated the last energy that bleeding edge had left in it and formed a blade with his right gauntlet. He thrust it forward forcefully, gritting his teeth through the pain of the movement, but he wasn't fast enough. Thanos caught his arm and snapped the blade off as if it were nothing and flipped the sharp edge around and stabbed it through Tony's side.
“We can't have that now can we?” Tony purred as he snaked his hand down over his abdomen, rubbed over his cock and cupped his balls. Steve stared, watching as Tony's length stiffened further from the touch it curved beautifully up from his groin to his taught stomach. He felt his own throb with heated want for that same touch, for now though Steve did his best to ignore it. He watched in fascination as Tony gripped the base of his own cock and slowly gave his length a long stroke up to the tip then back down. In response Tony gasped softly his mouth slightly agape as he panted.
Tony flexed his hands, they fit well, a little loose on him but Steve had bigger hands than he did. He brushed the palm along his arm and hummed at the texture along his skin. A thought suddenly popped into his mind these were Steve's gloves this was something he wore often on missions and this is what it would feel like if he ever put his hands on Tony. It was a despicable thought, he should rip them off and just repair the uniform as he had promised but Tony couldn't stop himself because Steve would never touch him in the ways he wanted to be touched.
Tony sat down, so Steve was playing along. Tony wanted to laugh at the audacity of let's pretend to be strangers in a bar, but perhaps it was the safest course of action. “Here for business." Tony stated while tilting his glass in his hands and studying the amber liquid "But I'm just looking for a place to unwind that wasn't the hotel bar where likely the cause my my headache is currently staying as well. I like local places. Usually have better Scotch." he looked over to Steve. "and you? certainly don't appear to be a local yourself."
The centipede uncoiled itself from Steve's body seemingly pleased with the turn of events. Steve stood there panting heavily, his head swimming from the pollen. The Centipede wriggled between Steve's legs and reared up head first behind Steve's back, its maw opening and it spewed out four web like strands, one around each wrist and Steve's thighs. It pulled back and the webbing tightened and held Steve in place as he tried to pull against it, his arms ended up above his head and no matter how hard he pulled he couldn't free himself. Steve was trapped, exposed and horribly vulnerable.
Through the muddled lust addled thoughts Steve managed to get an arm free and attempted to shove the segmented body away from himself, but the centipede only coiled more tightly around him. Part of it was bunched up against his groin, its many legs reaching rubbing, massaging and Steve had to bite back the moan that threatened to escape his throat. He had never needed to touch himself so badly, ached so much to take his cock in hand and stroke and stroke until he came messily over his own hand. Steve needed it, his balls were drawn up tight and ached already for release that was so close, but beyond his immediate reach.
Over the course of a few days it had outgrown three different cages and it showed no signs of stopping either. At that point Steve had become concerned that the centipede may have been mutated into some sort of super bug. For what reason or purpose that would have? He didn't know, but he wouldn't put it past Hydra to try just because they could. Tony fashioned a more permanent containment feature for the centipede in the lab. Forgoing cages he installed a large glass cube in the corner of the lab so the bug could be easily monitored and have space to grow. Tony suspected if the centipede had any unique features it would be discovered once it was a matured adult after all they had only found it as a grub.
Steve took a slow breath in and rose an eyebrow as he tried to get a read on what Tony's play could be. There didn't appear to be any hostility in his demeanor so Steve decided to go with it.
Tony felt a wave of disappointment he tried to ignore, so this was how it was going to end. Oh sure he would give his hotel number as if they were going to meet up, but Steve would go on his way and that would be the end of the game. "The Hilton...6th floor, room 633. I suppose I'll meet you there?"
The man kept his gaze on Steve as if he were studying him. “You gave no direction on what you wanted so we made do.”
Steve stood in the communal living floor by the window and watched as the Avengers quin-jet took off from the tower. Inside a specialized container was the centipede and it was on its way to an isolated S.H.I.E.L.D. facility. Tony and Bruce had generated a mild antidote to combat the pollen's affects, but it wasn't perfect. Rather than risk another containment issue within the tower it was determined to be best to relocate the centipede permanently.
“Thor? Why are you...you broke my window...” Tony complained , apparently not even aware the messy picture that he and Steve presented at that moment.
“Didn't seem that tough from my perspective.” Tony couldn't help the bite in his tone. He was still reeling with emotion...they had kissed. He had kissed Steve and liked it.
“Oh-oh fuck! Oh fuck Tony I-I'm gonna-I'm gonna-aah!” Steve's muscles went taught as his back arched up from the bed, his thighs spread wide and quivered as his cock pulsed. Thick ropes of come spurted across his heaving chest, while Steve's hips rocked with every new pump of come, and moaning in pure ecstasy. Tony sat back and watched in awe as Steve came and came messily across his abdomen and chest, he really must have been desperate for it. After the fifth pump the volume decreased to smaller spurts and finally little burbles of fluid. Steve was still shaking, and softly moaning as he came down from the intensity of his orgasm.
Steve needed a distraction to keep his thoughts from straying into that territory. Maybe so long without any intimacy in his life he was growing desperate. This had been the very reason he hadn't picked a woman for fear of making a fool of himself. Talking, maybe talking with Tony would help to ground him again and keep his focus on the drawing. Only his mind was completely blank on topics, Tony picked up on the distress.
“Steve...oh my god...Jarvis lock down this floor immediately!” Steve looked over towards the voice, and blinked in the haze buzzing though his brain. Tony was standing there still in his formal tuxedo from the event he had attended. What was he doing back already? Surely Steve hadn't been here that long, and why was Tony staring at him like that? The centipede wriggled backwards and cocked its head curiously regarding Tony. It approached him slowly its pincers clicked together as its legs moved in fluid synchronization.
“My profession...Steve I'm a concubine. I am little more than a whore I exist to give my lords pleasure.” He sat up from the bed.
“Tony wait please. Let me-” He tried to protest, but Tony lifted a finger to Steve's lips to silence him and his eyes were sorrowful.
“Tony, oh Tony!” Steve started chanting with his thrusts. He reached a brutally fast pace, his hips snapping forward and pulling Tony's hips back to meet him stroke for stroke. Sweat slicked skin slapped together audibly along with the wet plunge of Steve's cock driving into Tony's ass. Sinful, dirty noises accompanied with grunts, heaving panting breaths, and moans.
During the battle of New York Steve had regretted those words mere hours after he had uttered them. Especially once he had stood helpless in the street watching as Iron Man flew a nuke through a multidimensional portal at the risk of his own life to save everyone in the city. The second time Steve gazed down at the arc reactor, his chest was tight and his stomach clenched uncomfortably in fear at the sight of the dim light. There were no words to describe the relief he felt when the Hulk roared jolting Tony awake, and Steve saw the light spark into life and remain at a steady glow.
“It will only complicate our working relationship now. Neither one of us was really in our right minds yesterday, and some things were said.” Tony rubbed his hand over his face. “...and I can't do it Pepper. I cannot let this get out. He's an alpha and not just any alpha a national fucking icon alpha! It would only be a matter of time before someone connects the dots and figures out the truth about me.”
It had been a tiring week for Steve, some minor work for Shield paired with training some new agents and added in some public relations and he was ready for an nice weekend. Of course when you were Captain America and an Avenger having a real weekend was typically non existent, but this time there were no world ending crises that needed attending to. So Steve had a free weekend and he was very much looking forward to the available time.
“Tony? What should I do?” He asked in concern. Tony gave Steve an apprehensive look for a moment before coming to terms that there was no getting out of this. Tony sighed in defeat and pointed to the workbench beside him.
“Steve-alpha please! Can I come?” Tony begged. Steve pulled off of Tony's dick and his blue defiant eyes met Tony's desperate chocolatey browns.
Tony landed hard on the compacted dirt beneath him, he raised both his hands and fired a repulser blast from each palm, but the energy didn't appear to phase Thanos at all. The conqueror only gave Tony a mocking grin as he closed his gauntlet clad hand into a first and a large blast of purple energy slammed into Tony, knocking him back, he rolled a few feet away and shook the dizziness from his head. “Boss the arc reactor cannot sustain the energy necessary to power the nanobots. Not with this amount of damage to the system.”
“Eeeh friendly-ish? I mean last time we met she sort of got us captured by the ravagers and had this whole vendetta against her sister thing which I thought they maybe worked out?” Rocket looked up at the Captain's dubious expression. “I mean yeah, yeah she's fine.” He waved him off.
“No...No we stopped you!” Tony argued. “This is over, it's been over.” Tony could feel it, he could feel Steve's hands on him, he could feel his warmth, the tickle of his breath on his skin. That had been too real, it had happened...hadn't it?
Tony sat comfortably on the patio chair upon the front porch of the house. He sipped his morning coffee sitting back against the seat, and looking out across the field and early morning light. At one time Tony had made the jest that he'd retire from the Avengers and buy Pepper a farm, a ridiculous notion then, but after saving the universe from Thanos settling down away from the city in a quiet far off place was rather appealing. Only some changes had been made to the initial plan. He sipped at the coffee, eyes trailing over to the hardworking figure in the yard chopping wood.
Bruce held his hands up. “Sorry, sorry, I was instructed to ask about that. Fury's order not mine, I've been doing what I can to keep S.H.I.E.L.D. out of this.”
Steve steadied his gaze on Tony for a moment then strode over to him, he closed the gap between them, catching Tony's lips in his in a sweet kiss. Tony made a surprised noise and froze up. This...he hadn't expected this. When Steve broke away he gave Tony an apprehensive look with those mesmerizing blue eyes and even bit his lip as he waited for Tony's reaction. Tony only stared as his brain finally caught up to him. Steve had kissed him. Why would Steve kiss him? They had been arguing about the arc reactor and Steve had been acting weird about it and touching it and...it was in that moment it all clicked into place for Tony. Steve...Steve wanted him scars, arc reactor and all. Tony felt almost overwhelmed with fear at that idea as the last person he had trusted had shattered him, but Steve was staring down at him with those perfect blue eyes and those kissable pouty lips. Tony said to hell with it and pulled Steve towards him and licked his way into the soldier's mouth.
Steve was moaning with each thrust as Tony's body hugged and clenched him in all the right ways. Tony's slick made the glide smooth and easy for Steve to thrust into him with little resistance. Already Steve could feel the building tension the heated coil growing tighter and tighter with each thrust into his lover. This was a heat he wasn't concerned with making it last. They would have plenty of time to experiment with taking it slow, but right now it was about getting off and working out the frenzy of hormones.
Tony reached his hands down and pulled the fabric covering loose, he unwrapped it from himself slowly as if he were unwrapping a gift just for Steve's eyes. Slowly the silk came undone first exposing more of that teasing trail of hair, down, down...
“Another, give me another I'm ready.” Tony ordered. Steve complied, pulling his finger out and adding more lube, this time Tony hissed and gripped the bedsheets in his fists as Steve pushed two fingers into his channel. The stretch was really starting to burn now, and Steve could see the discomfort on Tony's face. He stilled his hand once he was fully inserted to give Tony time to adjust to the intrusion.
“You know...” Tony started after the quiet had gone on long enough. “I'm glad you're still here, and like what you said before...I-I feel the same. I don't know what I would have done had I lost you with everyone else.” he admitted quietly. Tony typically wasn't the type to talk of things such as this, feelings, and fears it was territory he rarely ventured. However, surviving the battle against Thanos, not disappearing to dust with half of the world's population put a lot into perspective. Tony couldn't keep hiding forever.
“Cap?” Bruce called out, but Steve just walked away from them, saying nothing. His heart was racing in his chest as he followed the commotion of voices and bodies towards Shuri's lab. It couldn't be. Steve walked and felt as if he were moving through a dream, time was moving too slow, everything around him seemed to dull and fade to the background and all his senses focused, narrowed on the location of that voice.
“As much as I enjoy making a mess of you, sleeping in dried spunk isn't great.” When Tony finished he tossed the towel into the closet, and pulled the blankets up over Steve before joining him in the bed. Steve turned and nuzzled up to Tony, wrapping an arm around him and holding him close.
Yes, he wanted to be filled. Normally he should be horrified by the notion that this creature was inching closer and closer with its phallic appendage, but head still swimming from the pollen Steve wanted it more than anything. He gripped his own thighs and brought his legs up exposing his already loosened and wet hole, his breath shaky and uneven. The centipede's slender penis twitched, and pulsed with more fluid the tip skirted over his rim, rubbing teasingly over it, smearing more of the slick natural lubricant over his flesh.
Tony appeared to flinch at Steve's words, there was a hollowness formed in his eyes as he took a step back from the reinforced glass. “Yes we know what happened which is why I'm here...because I wanted to- to try and help you.”
Steve nodded. “Yes, I am. Did you find something then? Can you help me?” He hoped he didn't sound too eager, but his mind was already beginning to supply images and ideas of what this solution might entail. Tony was wearing a blazer jacket over a t-shirt emblazoned with some band or pop-culture reference Steve didn't understand. He watched as Tony reached into the inner pocket of the blazer, and held out a small glass vial filled with a pinkish substance.
“Been hunched over a desk the last few days, figured I could stretch my legs maybe do a quick ten minutes on the treadmill and go back with some fresh eyes.” Tony replied. “I could be asking you the same thing. This isn't your typical routine.”
Having a kid clinging to you and begging not to die left an ugly mark on the soul. So Tony was more than willing to accept that he had acted rashly in his decision, but he kept that to himself. The people of Wakanda already believed he was unstable he didn't need to give them more reason to hover around him as much as they did.
“Ah! Steve I-I think, I think I'm close.” Tony moaned. It felt as if every nerve ending was on fire. Steve's warmth above him, he could feel the subtle weight of Steve's body against him as he drove his cock into him repeatedly. Tony had been on edge since Steve had worked him open with his fingers and every push and pull was only drawing him ever closer to tipping over into that blissful edge of orgasm. Tony's own cock ached and throbbed with neglect, and precome leaked profusely from the tip dripping down onto the sheets beneath him.
"No, go ahead." He said politely gesturing to the seat next to him. "Must be new around here. Yeah?" He asked and took another drink from his glass.
“No need to be ashamed of anything with me. I'm a depraved, kinky, dirty man who loves having a needy cock-loving super soldier to fuck.” Tony growled and kissed Steve roughly. It was a demanding, domineering kiss as Tony's tongue assaulted Steve's mouth, and he found himself moaning helplessly into the kiss. Steve gave himself over, willingly, because, he wanted to be all of that for Tony. He wanted to be his, and only his to kiss, to possess to fuck.
“Hmm...you are very different than the others. So Steve...back to my initial inquiry,how would you like me tonight?” As Tony spoke there was the slightest suggestive quirk of an eyebrow, it was subtle but Steve didn't miss the not so hidden implication. The room felt a little warmer than it had before.
“Hot...burning up...” He gasped as the sweat drenched his uniform. Without a second's hesitation he tore at the fastenings of his uniform he needed air, just anything to remove the stifling heat. As if in understanding the centipede's legs began to stretched and feel, pulling at Steve's uniform hiking up the top portion and exposing his sweat covered abdomen. It didn't stop there, with his pants unfastened the centipede's contorted its body and its legs hooked into the band of Steve's pants and tugged them down. Steve's stiff cock sprung free from the confines and glistened wetly at the tip. He was so hard a near steady stream of precome leaked from the tip and down his shaft.
“It doesn't have to be.” Tony surprised even himself with that reply. “I don't know what this is, what to call it, or if we should put a label on it at all.” Tony took a stalling breath before continuing. “But, it doesn't have to be just for tonight.”
“Oh Tony...you want me? Tell me...let me hear it. How bad you need your alpha?” Steve ordered him with a growl. Tony groaned and rolled his hips back, rubbing himself against Steve.
He listened to the quiet footsteps around the room the rustle of fabric and the zipper on a suitcase. Steve expected to hear the door any moment just waiting for Tony to walk out on him and out of his life once more. He waited. Waited. There was suddenly the soft brush of lips on his cheek, and the gentle caress of fingers through his hair, Steve didn't know he could feel such a warmth and hope envelope him.
Devastated was what Pepper had been when Tony told her everything. “I didn't think I'd get you back I didn't even think I'd survive.” He had tried to explain.
Tony scrabbled his hands over Steve's uniform, searching for the releases to undress him. He wanted skin, he needed to feel another living body next to his own to be reminded that they were both here, they survived the dusting. Steve seemed to register what Tony was trying to accomplish and he pulled back just enough to assist in unbuckling and unsnapping the catches of his uniform. He shucked the top part of the uniform, his broad chest now exposed to Tony and Tony ran his hands over pectorals, palms brushing Steve's nipples and caressing his shoulders and arms. Steve shivered from the touch and his breath caught in his throat. The surface of the prosthetic he had expected to feel cold like metal, but it wasn't it was warm and left behind a subtle but pleasant tingle from the energy that thrummed through it.
Finally Steve settled back against the bed and caught his breath while his limbs went lax. Tony rubbed his hand up along Steve's flank and his arm in soothing strokes.
“Next time, Next time Tony I promise.” Soon he too tipped over that edge of release. Steve pumped himself a few more times into Tony's body before he stilled and held him flush against his waist as he emptied himself into the rubber around his cock. “Oh...my God Tony...” Steve panted.
Tony whimpered at the loss of Steve's lips when he backed up from the bed, standing at the edge still in his uniform pants and combat boots. Steve backed up and switched the lights off and the room was cast in darkness, the only light from the occasional flashes from the storm outside. The rain was coming down harder now, the droplets pattering over the window. Steve approached the bed and unfastened his belt and let it drop heavily to the floor. Tony sat back and observed, watched as Steve toed off his boots, and unbuttoned his uniform pants and slid them down and off.
Tony didn't now what to say to that. He was a master with words, he could babble on about any number of topics with expertise, but when it came to actual communication about feelings he found he was always lacking proper responses. “I'm relieved to see that you are happy again.” Tony finally said after the silence had gone on for too long. “Ever since you first woke up here from the ice you always had this whole downer thing-with good reason-even when I didn't fully get it back then. Since we decided to come here it feels like I'm seeing you truly...happy? It's such a lame simple word to use for this, but that's really all I can think when I look at you.”
Steve was surprised when Tony pushed him against the wall. His first thought was that Tony was going to blind side him, and he grabbed his shoulder to counter, but than Tony kissed him. That sent a pleasurable jolt through his stomach, and he moved his hands down Tony's chest to his waist pulling him in closer to deepen the kiss. Tony didn't quite understand where this was coming from the sudden need for Steve's hands on him, maybe he had just been alone too long. At the present moment he didn't really care, he parted his lips for Steve, letting him dominate his mouth with his tongue.
So he was alone in the family mansion, but it wasn't always all bad. This year Steve had promised to come by and see him, it had been several years since Tony had a Christmas with the famous Captain America. When he had been younger Steve had tried to make it an annual occurrence, but with Tony's schooling and Steve's unpredictable mission schedule it was difficult to follow through most years.
The concubine chuckled in amusement. “Yes Aesthetically.” He replied with a knowing tilt of his head. “So my lord how would you like me to pose for you this evening?”
“No you stay with your people Rogers and make your plans to regroup, the...furry creature can assist us if this is his crew.” Steve nodded in understanding and he, Natasha, Bruce, Thor, and Rhodey exited the lab space and stood together in one of the many rooms of the palace to discuss and plan. Steve felt the exhaustion, the defeat was evident on all their faces, and as much as he wanted to just crumple to the ground and scream his grief away...that would solve nothing. The ache in his chest, on his heart was heavy. He dared not to think of what may have happened to the others...and Tony...who had been missing since this had all began. No he refused to go there, he couldn't go there, nothing was for certain yet.
“We can watch it together... I could take you and knot you, and you can watch how well your body takes me.” Tony's cock throbbed with a spike of heat, he didn't think he could get any harder. It was nearly painful he wanted to come so bad, he felt his balls clenching, so close to release.
“You want me to what?” Tony protested. Even with his whole body buzzing with need he was still hesitant to fully comply. He had just gotten over watching Steve finger him now Steve wanted Tony to expose himself further?
“Shhh it's okay Tony it won't hurt you.” Steve said in a gentle voice. The red appendages bore into Tony, feeling, stroking, one ease its way in between buttons of Tony's shirt and pulled ripping it open. There was ripping and tearing as the centipede worked on divesting Tony of his clothing. Tony's breath was fast sharp inhales as he was slowly exposed, he struggled against the creature more, gritting his teeth in exertion.
Tony shook his head. “You don't understand Steve I cold lose everything if people knew. My company would suffer, hell even the Avengers could suffer. They could remove me from the team!”
-Fuck it-Tony thought. He was going all in...Steve would have to back out because he certainly wasn't, Steve could always say no. They were adults after all, consenting adults and Tony wanted it. Wanted Steve naked and inside him...wait what? those were new thoughts, but not entirely unwelcome. Steve held onto Tony's hips as he ran his tongue along Tony lip and explored his mouth. He groaned hearing Tony moan into the kiss, and twisted them around so Tony was now against the wall with Steve holding him there. He kissed along Tony's jaw, and down his neck grinding his hips against Tony. His arousal evident. Steve didn't expect to have such a reaction to Tony, but he had this need to take him. He ground his cock against Tony's thigh wanting him to feel how much he wanted it.
“T-Tony-wait-” Steve breathed but Tony was already slotting himself between Steve's legs and his hands settled on Steve's narrow waist.
“Wait...don't you need-” Steve cut himself off when he felt the head catch on Tony's rim, already wet and loose...oh...he had come here prepared. Tony just gave Steve a knowing smirk before he held firm and lowered his weight onto Steve. “Oh...oohh.” Steve didn't know what to do with his hands, he was clutching at the sheets, he resisted the urge to buck his hips up into the tight heat enveloping him. Tony was breathing in and out slow and easy as he slowly sank down further letting Steve's cock slide up and up into him.
Steve swiped his tongue along his lips to wet them as he noticed Tony watching him intently. He knew better, he was the adult here, and Tony was only a kid, but was he? Tony was 18 years old now a legal adult. He had grown into such a fine looking young man, it was impossible to overlook his handsome features. “Tony you can't possibly know that.”
Oh that. Tony sighed and set the tablet back down. He gazed at the red metallic surface of his prosthetic and raised his hand up clenching and unclenching the fist. That he could discuss, that was a safe topic. “Since our little disagreement two years ago...I've had some problems. Irreversible nerve damage, I've messed this arm up repeatedly and it was only a matter of time before it was one too many injuries.” He turned the hand palm out and extended the fingers to show off the full range of movement. “This last fight with Thanos he...broke my arm. Snapped it really, like a twig. I had no functionality left in it and despite needing a working arm to fight with the suit. I...I need my hands to build.”
“All I ever want is you Tony.” Steve confessed. He reached down and coaxed Tony up, holding him around the middle to help Tony sit upright onto his knees. Steve held him, his chest against Tony's warm back, his arms bracing him Tony lifted his arms up and arching his back slightly and turned his head so their lips could meet. Tony grasped at the hair on the back of Steve's head as they kissed, long and passionate. Steve's knot still settled deep and tight in his lover's body.
“Well if you're new to certain...activities...that can happen.” Steve's mouth felt dry. They shouldn't be talking about this, it wasn't appropriate and it was putting some very alarming images into Steve's mind.
“Knock yourself out Cap.” Tony called from the closet. He waited a few moments to see if Tony came out, when he didn't Steve got out of the rumpled bed and walked over to the closet.
“Had you waited we could have done something!” Shuri bit as she worked on mending Tony's stomach wound. The pain killers had finally kicked in and Tony had relaxed back against the table, fading into a drug induced sleep. Now that he wasn't flailing as much she could work more easily.
“I can stop if it's too much.” Steve looked down at Tony a moment before he answered. He recalled, hazily the centipede when it had probed him with its tongue, when he discovered it had a tongue. Even then he had thrilled at the idea of being rimmed, and the heat in his groin only grew hotter knowing that Tony wanted to lick him there.
It was certainly a man. Only his eyes were visible as he wore a red silk veil across the lower half of his face that was held in place by a gold chain. A decorative gold headpiece hung across his forehead, it was simple with a red jewel in the middle and draped along the sides of his head. His dark hair was cropped short and styled in a fashion that to Steve seemed to defy gravity.
When typical masturbation habits didn't suffice Steve switched it up to more extreme practices. He used fingers in his ass, a dildo, a vibrator, but that too proved fruitless. Steve sat on the edge of his bed feeling completely rotten. He began to wonder if there was something else that the centipede had done to him that Bruce's tests hadn't caught. Was Tony experiencing this problem as well? It wasn't as if Steve could really ask though. They didn't talk about the centipede, Tony was still performing research but he never discussed any of his findings with Steve.
Steve pulled out and slammed back into Tony, the action causing them both to moan. He did it again, and then again, and again increasing his speed with each thrust. It felt so good the way Tony's channel squeezed and tightened around his cock, the glide in and out creating a delicious friction.
Attached to the ring was a crudely designed robotic prosthetic, what had Thanos done to him? Steve felt nauseous, a sickness roiled inside of himself at the sight and unwanted images of Thanos ripping Tony's arm from the elbow filled his head.
“Okay...I guess I'll see you later then?” Steve asked but he got no further reply. He had the urge to wrench the door open and ask Tony if everything was okay between them, but he decided to give him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he really did have to meet with Pepper, and Steve was just being paranoid. Steve walked over towards the bed and picked up his clothes from the floor and headed into Tony's luxury bathroom.
Thor was still attempting to prevent the centipede from exiting its corner of the room, he held his hammer up high in a threatening stance. Steve closed his eyes too and just slowly breathed in and out as the utter exhaustion settled bone deep. The darkness enveloped him and he fell into a pleasant sleep.
“Tony” Steve said to stop him from leaving, which Tony did pause and glanced back at him through the window. “Thank you for coming here to talk to me. You have no idea how much it helped, I've been obsessing over what I would say to you and nothing ever felt right.”
Tony had gotten out of the shower and dried himself off with a towel. He stared at his reflection in the mirror noting the age lines and subtle graying in his hair and beard. Most of all though he examined the arc reactor nestled into the center of his chest and the scars spreading in a star like pattern from the device, marring up the smoothness of his olive skin. Tony suffered from a near constant ache from the scars and the sensitive flesh around the device. Not to mention he often experienced shortness of breath due to the reactor taking up space in chest cavity thus limiting his ability for full lung capacity. Tony touched it lightly, tracing the triangular bracket he had designed for better structure integrity. Sure he acted as if he had learned to accept it...but in reality Tony hated it. Pepper had only added to his insecurity and shame of the thing.
Tony heard the knock. Steve had actually shown up, surely Steve wasn't about to let Tony ravish him shamelessly, as much as that idea now interested him greatly. Steve was the responsible one he would call it off, after all as far as Tony knew Steve was straight. Even though that kiss did have him questioning that. Tony opened the door and masked his nervous/excited energy with his normal calm and self assured bravado. Tony smiled when he saw Steve standing there.
The sounds of fists on the bag had stopped and Tony glanced up to see Steve looking at him. All six foot muscled alpha perfection staring down the horny little omega. Tony couldn't do this, not now, not while his hormones were going crazy. Tony couldn't risk this happening again, what if someone else had been in the gym? Natasha? Or Clint? What if this happened while in Shield or on a mission? The risks were too high. Tony had to get a handle on himself before he talked with Steve. Tony turned around and hurried back towards the elevator.
That was part of what drew Steve to him, but he didn't want to just give up and lose this chance for something greater. He could understand wanting to keep this quiet for now, but he also didn't want to have to lie or feel as if he were some dirty secret. For now he would agree, but he would work with Tony and see if he could convince him to slowly ease off the suppressants.
Steve had always prided himself on his self control and especially his serum's ability to counteract negative affects of toxins, poisons, and other foreign substances. This experience though only left him feeling vulnerable and weak. He could have handled what had occurred had it only been himself and the bug, but since he had forcibly involved Tony...Steve could never forgive himself for that.
Tony watched him, Steve's reactions, he was so responsive and sensitive. Tony didn't last long the combined high of the pollen with the imagery had him comming quickly. Long drawn out pulses that spilled onto his own abdomen. The centipede pulled away from Steve suddenly and it reared up cocking its head inquisitively and clicking its pincers together. Tony let his body go lax, his head falling back as he regulated his breathing. Two orgasms was a feat for him, but bringing that up to three was unheard of, especially for his age and how close together. He was gonna be sore in a few hours, the fatigue was beginning to settle. The centipede made a sudden high-pitched squealing noise jerking Tony out of his haze.
“You're the catch here, I'm just a guy from Brooklyn out of my time and struggling to fit in.” Tony scooted closer to Steve while twining their fingers together. “I wanted you too, but I was too ashamed to admit it to myself before.” Steve confessed.
Steve felt himself grow hot inside and out, settling in his groin, his blood rushing down south so suddenly he nearly felt faint. It was happening all so fast he didn't understand it at first. His cock grew hard in seconds, and pressed uncomfortably against the fabric of his uniform.
So there it is, this took a great effort for me to finish and I hope that it was to everyone's liking. I hope that it was worth the year long wait.
“I'm seeing a pattern here Stark.” Thanos' voice boomed from behind. “This isn't me, you shape your reality I am only giving you the means in which to do so. This is all your own head creating your paradise.”
Tony swallowed hard. He felt Steve's fingers digging into the flesh of his behind and spreading his cheeks. He felt the cool air biting were his slick covered him. Tony reached back his own hands and placed them over Steve's and held himself open. “I can do it.” Tony replied and Steve moved back to holding Tony's hips. With a deep breath Tony turned his head and looked back in the mirror at himself.
“Tony wait!” He was gone...Steve stood alone now more confused than ever. What was all that talk about a darkness in this place? He was only more determined to get the answers that he needed. Steve was known to be a stubborn individual and he wasn't going to let Tony's cryptic message sway his decision. He'd find out exactly what was going on, and hopefully pull Tony out of whatever mess he found.
Bruce's shoulders sagged as he heaved out a small sigh. “Tony's saying the same thing. Both of you stubborn to a fault.” Steve's muscles tensed at the mention of Tony's name. Tony was refusing to talk as well? It was probably too traumatic, he wanted to forget and put it all behind him. Steve certainly didn't blame him.”
There was a snort from Tony and he quirked his mouth slightly in a half smirk. “There's not a single person that has ever fucked me like that Captain.” Steve felt a sudden warmth pool in his groin. “I never bottomed for a man before. You realize that right?” Tony continued, his eyes dark and intense. “You are the only man to ever have his cock in me, and believe me when I say that you are the only man that I will allow to fuck my ass again.” Steve's cock stirred, and was beginning to stiffen in his pants from Tony's words. It only brought back the vivid memories of Tony's heat.
Tony smiled, taking off his own jacket, loosening his tie, and tossing it to the floor. Watching Steve run his hands over himself was so sexy, an excited shiver ran through Tony at the sight. He could only imagine what that must look like if Steve were naked. Later there was time for that later Tony stood at the edge of the bed between Steve's legs, and ran his hands up his thighs to his belt.
It hadn't been that easy before. After Steve had assisted Tony with his heat, they had talked it over briefly and Steve had believed they had come to an understanding, but it was clear the next morning that Tony had some very different ideas.
“As long as no one else gets to touch you.” Tony stated, he ran a hand down to Steve's hip and slipped it under, angling his pelvis so he could grasp at the perfect globe of his ass. “This is mine. All mine.”
“Y-yes. I can hear you.” Steve croaked out, his throat felt raw and his voice rough. He swallowed hard to try and moisten the dry feeling in his mouth.
Steve smiled warmly at Tony and leaned in to kiss him, a soft and slow. Tony typically preferred the hot passionate kisses, where they couldn't get enough of each other. This though was so different, taking time to move slow and explore, so loving and sweet. When Steve finally parted his lips to grant Tony's tongue access to him, Tony was feeling hot with need. It made his chest feel tight and a warmth spread from inside his core. How was it that Steve Rogers could make him feel this way? So unlike himself? Express himself in ways he had never been capable of before?
Tony had a mischievous glint in his eyes as he smiled almost wickedly and slunk down the bed. He knelt between Steve's legs, positioning them so his knees were bent but he was splayed open and showing off everything from his hardening cock to his taught sac and messy leaking hole.
“I hope they remember you.” Thanos gripped the handle ready to twist and Tony prepared for his end, hoping that this sacrifice would make up for his past failures.
"I wasn't sure what to expect, perhaps you had just been leading me on for kicks.” Tony eyed Steve as he took his jacket off, studied him, really took the time to appreciate Steve's physique, and he truly was something to be admired. Tony had to even the odds. Steve had thrown him off with the kiss and he was trying to make him falter now. Tony walked up to him, putting his hand on Steve's arm. "After all...we did just meet." Tony pushed Steve against the wall,and pressed his lips to Steve's in a hasty kiss.
“More than sufficient that was...well I wasn't intending for this evening to go this way, but I'm not disappointed with the turn of events.” Steve replied softly with a smile. “Can I see you again? Not just for this, if you want to I won't...I mean I would like to-you know- this again, but I still want to use you as my model.” Steve stumbled over his words, his head still felt a little hazy after the explosive orgasm.
“I heard the rumors but always wanted to see for myself, god Tony you've got a nice big cock.” Steve said while nuzzling Tony's groin appreciatively. “I can just imagine what you'll feel like inside me, I wanna feel stretched and open. I want you to fuck me good, I know you'll make it so good. The centipede already prepped me, I'm so loose and open, ready to take you in. I wanna feel you come in me, make me messy, feel your come leaking from my used hole.”
“Okay...relax now...breathe...” Steve said gently as he nesteled the head of his cock against Tony's ass. He waited for Tony to breathe out and then slowly he pushed forward, the head of his shaft popping into Tony's hole and then deeper into his channel.
“Are-Are you okay?” Steve asked suddenly in alarm. He managed to snap out of his sex drunk haze for at least the moment at hearing Tony in pain.
“Oh Tony you're usually not up this early! I...I was looking for uh...this!” He said picking up a random screw-driver. “Well that's all I needed. You have a lot of tools in here took a minute to find, well I should go fix-fix the thing I needed this...for....yeah bye!” Steve rambled as he hurried out of the shop. Tony watched Steve go with a perplexed expression on his face. What on earth had Steve been doing in here? Tony walked up to the workbench that Steve had been standing by and took a glance at the items there, nothing seemed out of place-wait-
“It made me feel so good Tony.” Steve looked back at him over his shoulder a sultry little smile on his face. “You feel so much better though, you're filling me so good.” Steve finally registered what was happening behind Tony, his arms suspended above his head by the webbing and the way the centipede's body was curving in towards Tony's rear. It flexed and moved and each thrust moved Tony deep into his channel. “Oh? It's-to you too? Does it feel good? You like it Tony?”
Steve's jaw nearly dropped in surprise at how causal Tony was being about exposing himself. He tried to keep his gaze from roaming over the concubine's nude form, but he couldn't resist. His eyes slid over Tony to the prize between his legs, a finely shaped cock, half hard and resting against Tony's thigh, long, not overly thick. Steve swallowed hard, throat clicking from the sudden dryness and averted his gaze. To his horror he realized he had been staring...he had been staring at another man's cock.
Steve couldn't believe that Tony really thought all that about himself, he had been convinced he had helped to sway Tony's opinion. It was apparent now that nothing had changed in Tony's perspective. Did that mean Tony regretted what they had shared? Had their words at the end there been nothing but a giant lie? “You're not a freak I told you how special you are, how rare it is for someone like you to even exist. You're more than just your omega nature Tony, and if you gave others the chance they would see that too.”
“If this is what you want...” Steve replied and let his gaze linger over Tony's exposed member. The young man's cock was flushed and hard, his balls already drawn up tight.
"The Hilton 6th floor room 633. Alright." Steve stepped closer to Tony he'd give Tony the reassurance that he would be there. This was all a game after all. Steve took Tony's chin lightly tilting his head up and leaned closer so they were only mere inches apart. "I look forward to seeing you there Tony." Steve pressed his lips to Tony's and kissed him, it was quick and over too soon. Steve smirked and then turned away heading over to his bike.
“Yeah-yeah okay plenty of time later.” Tony planted another light kiss on Steve's lips. “Drawer the bottle we'll need that.” Steve nodded and reached over towards the night stand and pulled open the drawer. Inside was a small bottle of lubricant and a box of condoms.
Steve was determined to change Tony's perspective, and to show him that there was nothing wrong with being a male omega. His body was beautiful, and there was no shame in how he was built. To Steve it was a marvel how omegas worked, how Tony's scent alone could get him worked up in minutes. Steve's cock would throb with need and he'd be desperate to knot Tony and claim him for himself. Tony was still between suppressants and Steve was taking advantage of it. They both had an evening off, and Steve put his plan into action. Tony may hate it and it very well could backfire, but to him it was worth the risk. Tony would learn to see himself as Steve did.
Steve continued laving his tongue along Tony's length, long wet licks, running his tongue up and down as the centipede squeezed, and gently stroked Tony as it had done with Steve. Tony had shut his eyes tightly, still trying to fight the buzzing heat from the pollen altering his mind. It was difficult to ignore the wet warmth of Steve's tongue, his lips trailing over the sensitive skin of his shaft, lips warm and soft, the centipede's legs flexing. Tony's resolve was fracturing as the pollen clouded his judgment, he was sinking into the pleasure, letting it envelope him. Below him Steve was moaning, humming as he continued to trail his mouth and tongue up and down Tony's cock.
Tony winced slightly and looked off to the side while he chewed his lower lip. “You can tell?” How was it that easy for him to know?
“What? We're all thinking it.” Tony peered into the cage as the centipede scurried around on its many legs. It was approximately six inches in length, and two inches in diameter its segmented body appeared to be more organic and fleshy like a worm. It was a deep purple color, the legs and underbelly were red, Tony wasn't exactly an expert on arthropods, but he was certain something like this was probably some kind of new species. After all, why else would Hydra have the little creature in a lab in the middle of the mountains?
“I'm not looking for entertainment.” Steve stated. “Maybe just some new inspiration.” He added as he walked over to the couch. The two of them remained silent, each absorbed in his own work and trying to ignore the other. It became somewhat of a normal thing between them after that. Slowly they began to make small talk until eventually they held full conversations as they worked. Tony would often babble on about his projects finding it easier to work when he could just talk about an issue he was experiencing as he would be describing it to Steve he would have a moment of realization and pour himself into the new solution. Unknown to Tony he had become the subject of Steve's many sketches. At first Steve just drew what he saw in the shop, Tony's armor his silly little robots, tools he left strewn about. Sometimes though Steve drew Tony as he was hard at work on whatever project he was involved in.
“I'm doing fine.” Steve stated dismissively, but he kept his body turned away from Tony and towards the punching bag. Hearing Tony's voice alone was making him feel hot and needy. God what was wrong with him?
After venturing outside his room and the short elevator ride down Steve walked into the gym and towards the cubby that held various items, towels, water, and tape for his hands were among them. Steve wrapped his hands and started on the punching bag as he had done a number of times since waking from the ice. One hit, two hits, three Steve kept the count in his head until up to ten in quick succession. Left jab, right jab, repeat, left, right, repeat. It was a monotonous routine, but it was one that Steve could perform with little thought, and soon he was working up a sweat as he beat the bag.
Tony moved onto his back and Steve straddled his thighs. He splayed his hands over Tony's chest, careful of the arc reactor as Tony held himself steady for Steve to sink down onto. The penetration was slow, he had to take a lot of moments to acclimate but soon Steve was fully seated, straddling Tony's thighs and his impressive cock was buried to the hilt in his ass.
“I want you to have me.” Steve continued as he opened the vial. “I want all of that again.” He held the vial up and inhaled deeply he closed his eyes and waited as the centipede's pollen worked its way through his system. Almost immediately Steve felt the heat of arousal ignite in his core and spread out through his body to his limbs.
“Here's what we're going to do sweetheart.” Tony said in a low seductively sweet tone. “You are going to undress and let me look at this gorgeous body of yours since you've had the pleasure of staring at mine all night, I think it is only courteous to repay the favor. Then I want you to lie down on that bed over there and I'm gonna treat you real nice. Gonna make you see stars Steve.” Steve stared at Tony this wasn't how he had intended for the evening to go, but hearing Tony speak to him just plainly order him around it made Steve whimper in want. His cock grew impossibly harder, he felt himself leaking in his pants he was so turned on.
He was still obscenely wet, he could see from the sheen on his skin. His hole was slick and...open...so open...the rim swollen and puffy. His body was prepped and ready to take a cock. Tony shivered.
“Upstairs?” Tony asked, his voice husky, dripping with lust. Steve could only manage a silent nod then found himself being manhandled backwards towards the elevator. It was all hazy from there, a wild dash mixed with heated kisses and groping hands before the two men fell together onto Tony's luxurious bed. Steve trailed light kisses down Tony's neck, nipping softly at the flesh as he worked his way down to his chest. He couldn't help himself, Steve sat back to admire the device keeping Tony alive, running his fingers over it lightly in soft caresses before leaning down and kissing the center of it.
There was also the idea of Steve taking Tony while he wore the uniform. The blue fabric hugging him and showing off all of his assets, his sculpted perfect body. The leather harness framing his chest and the bite of the leather gloves on Tony's skin. Steve could hold him down so easily, unbutton his fly and pull his cock out. What an image Steve in full uniform with his huge dripping cock jutting out and exposed.
“I'd like you to be here to help me Tony. In any way that you are comfortable with.” Steve stated while he reached out and plucked the small vial from Tony's delicate grasp. He examined the powder inside a moment and huffed with a small shake of his head. This substance had caused them so much grief and here he was about to put himself through it all again. Maybe it wasn't the best solution but...if he could allow himself to indulge in his fantasy and accept what he wanted then he could move forward with his life. Steve didn't want to go through it all alone, he wanted Tony with him. He wanted Tony's hands and his mouth, his body rocking against his, his cock long and thick, penetrating him and stretching his ass.
Sweat drenched and exhausted Tony had Steve pull out of him and he collapsed onto the bed to catch his breath. Steve looked over to the beautiful man, his eyes closed, mouth agape as he breathed in and out unevenly the dark gentle curls of his hair falling over his forehead. He committed the image to his memory to draw later, there had been several other images he wanted to drawn and keep forever in his private stash. Tentatively Steve reached his hand up and stroked his fingers along Tony's cheek to the carefully trimmed hair of his beard.
“You didn't have to go through all this to help me though, you could have handed me over to Bruce and called it a day. This was..” Steve added the last part hesitantly. “This was more than what any friend would do.”
“I do...something about seeing you all wet and loose...it-it does things to me...” Steve replied in a deeper tone, almost hoarse from strain. Steve reached down then between Tony's legs and grasped the base of his own cock. Steve sighed a little as he held himself firmly with his fist and gently rubbed the head between the cleft of Tony's cheeks. “I just want you to see yourself how I see you Tony...that you should never be ashamed of what your body does” Tony watched it in the mirror, his head turned, his back starting to hurt a little from twisting so much to see, but he wanted to watch the way Steve shoved his impossibly large cock into his tight ass. Tony felt a clenching of worry and also excitement all in one at seeing the size and wondering how Steve had ever fit that into him before and how it was going to now. It didn't seem possible.
He traced a finger along Tony's crack and down between his cheeks and massaged the wet entrance while he sucked on Tony's shaft. The slick was already leaking down his thighs, coating them, his hole was already relaxed and open for an alpha to take and ravage. Steve moaned pleasantly around Tony's cock as he use his fingers to tease and play, rubbing and circling around Tony's hole, but not quite penetrating yet.
“Damn it.” He cursed quietly. “Be right there!” He called and picked up the candles quickly and threw them haphazardly back into the cabinet, only for them to roll back out. Steve caught a few then shoved them back inside and slammed the cabinet closed. Turning and not used to the way he had reorganized the room he nearly tripped over his stool and ended up hitting his knee on the edge of the chaise lounge. Limping over to the door he opened it and tried to recollect himself while wincing in pain from his knee. “Sorry for the delay please co-” Steve stopped mid sentence as he finally brought his eyes up to view his model for the evening.
“No...No Steve you didn't make the wrong call.” He took in a slow heavy breath and let it out slowly before he continued. “ I should have told you why I was avoiding you. I went to the gym intending to talk to you and being there and seeing you in all your alpha super soldier glory. I lost it. I...was experiencing symptoms you know? I had to get myself under control before I could be in the same room as you. I couldn't risk any of the others seeing me get all sex crazy and blow my secret.”
Tony shook his head and tightened his grip around Steve's cock as he stroked him from base to tip. “and I don't care if it hurts.” Tony leaned up and trailed his lips along Steve's neck to shoulder. Sucking and nipping gently across Steve's skin before he bit down harder at the juncture of shoulder and neck. Steve sucked in a surprised breath and let it out in a quiet moan, it was painful but it felt good at the same time, something inside of him twisted pleasantly and more precum beaded and drizzled from the tip. “It's a good kind of hurt.” Tony mumbled while mouthing over the forming bruise.
“Ah-ah-ahh” Steve moaned, he looked down at the sight his thick pink cock encased between the centipede's red legs, the underbelly of the creature was slick and it flexed and pulsed against his own flesh, caressing his balls and underside of his cock. It tugged and squeezed so sweetly Steve was beside himself in pleasure. His arms tenses and he pulled against the webbing, but not to break free-no-just because it all felt so fucking good. He was leaning forward now his eyes half lidded and his ass angled back towards the centipede, putting on a filthy display of himself.
“Fuck-Steve!” Tony grunted and reached down to still Steve's hand from stroking. “If that's what you want you need to stop doing that before I come.” Tony then met Steve's gaze with his eyes his pupils were blown wide with lust, nearly black with the faintest hint of brown around the edge.
“Gah!” Tony exclaimed. “ Y-you can take a break. No hurry...” Steve already was beginning to take up his previous pace.
“Right well if you want something with actual food content.” Steve stated and pushed a plate towards Tony. “Plenty to go around.”
“Steve, stop, stop!” Tony protested. “That is not what happened! You didn't rape me, you didn't force me into anything. It was that bug, that thing made you do it and remember I was affected by the pollen too. It just took longer, I was fighting it because I knew this right here would be the outcome. I know the kind of man you are and a rough and tumble random sex encounter is not the way you do things.” Tony ran a hand over his beard before he continued. “If anyone should be apologizing it should be...me...I was the one that violated you. You were not yourself and I knew that, but that pollen clouded my judgment. So. I am sorry. I'm sorry that I took advantage of you while you were in that state.”
“Fuck, oh fuck! Steve I-ah ah I'm gonna come, Steve I'm gonna come!” Tony's body went rigid. The hot pleasure that exploded within him was beyond anything he had ever experienced. The tightly wound coil finally released, his balls felt tight against his body he rocked his hips forward, and his cock pulsed with each spurt, his come splattering on sheets beneath him. Steve's hand continued to stroke over the hard flesh milking Tony of every drop causing him to gasp and buck his hips from the oversensitivity. Steve quietly moaned as Tony's walls clenched, almost vice like around his shaft, Tony was practically quivering beneath him as the intense pleasure rolled through him. He had to hold still for it to pass, and didn't move again until he felt Tony relax beneath him releasing his spent cock. Steve pressed several long kisses to Tony's neck and back, he could taste the subtle saltiness of sweat along Tony's skin.
“What can I do for you Steve?” Tony asked simply while continuing to work. Steve blinked in surprise. Tony wasn't running off, he wasn't telling him to leave he was just continuing his work. What was this? It couldn't be this easy could it? Not after the days he had agonized over everything.
“Yeah, yeah still with you.” Tony replied in a rough voice. Steve settled in close to Tony on their bed holding him protectively.
Okoye was hesitant to let them land, but perhaps in this situation the enemy of my enemy is my friend would have to do. She hit the communications channel. “You are cleared for entry there is a landing pad in front of the palace.”
“Listen to me I like you, and you have been the kindest, the sweetest and I've been honored to service you, but you don't want to get mixed up in all this Steve. There is a lot about me you don't know about, why I'm here and why Pierce would never let you to buy me from under him.”
“If that's what it is, if this is the end and we're all just going to die I don't want to die with all these regrets.”
Steve was going to have the tower to himself one evening. After a training session he'd run at S.H.I.E.L.D. he could come home and take some time to relax. Natasha and Clint were away on a mission of their own, Thor was still in Asgard. Bruce had taken some personal leave courtesy of Tony offering him a week away on his private beach on some exotic island. Tony was at some fancy event that Steve had declined to attend. He preferred to just stay in for the evening and have the tower to himself for once. Not that Steve minded having the rest of the Avengers around and he had his own floor if he really wanted to be left alone, but as the team's Captain he felt obligated to be around them when they were home.
“Ooooh god!” Tony panted as he stroked himself faster, his arm moving rapidly, rubbing his hand over his cock.
Tony's breath was coming out shallow as his deep brown eyes searched Steve's and briefly flicked down to Steve's lips and back up. “What if...I have met the perfect one...we just don't know it yet.” He whispered.
“Not yet.” Steve breathed and he pulled his fingers from Tony's ass. Tony whimpered at the loss and searched Steve's face for a hint of what was next. Steve stood up and met Tony's lips with his own in an aggressive kiss. He pushed Tony backwards onto the bed. “Turn around Tony.” Steve commanded and Tony did so instantly. Much like their first time during his heat, Tony had hated this position for a long time and had refused to do so when not experiencing a cycle. Over time they had worked on the insecurities and the shame this position had brought, and now Tony didn't hesitate when Steve asked it of him.
Tony seemed to consider the offer for a moment, he looked off towards the side of the room hie brow tense in thought. Steve waited patiently for his answer, and after that not so patiently, he began to grow a little antsy and tried to think of what else he could say.
“Yeah you always say that. Stop it. You're talented.” Sam gave him a wave and exited the dining hall. Steve tapped his fingers on the hard polished oak in thought. Now he had to build up the courage to actually ask for a concubine to be sent to his room. Also if he wanted to pick or let Master Fury decide which to send. The question too did Steve want to draw a female or a male? He was fiercely inexperienced with women, and none of them had really paid him much attention until his physical body had changed from the alchemist's potion. Still the sudden attention had only made him feel more uncomfortable. Had he been a vain man he may have taken advantage of the women's advances long ago as his fellow soldiers had done, but Steve wanted more than a brief tumble. He wanted connection.
Steve ran his hands down Tony sides and then gripped his thighs he hoisted Tony further up on the bed. The idea of taking him, and Tony asking to be taken was all Steve needed. “You got anything for this?” He asked
“Okay so I did, but I didn't plan it. It just sort of...happened.” Tony leaned forward in the chair, resting his elbows on his knees and he held his face in his hands. This time he didn't bother to hide the discomfort and grunted quietly. Pepper's face fell slightly in sympathy and worry.
Steve took a breath as he looked at his glass, he hadn't seen Tony since he rammed his shield into his armor. No doubt still angry for keeping the knowledge of his parent's murder away from him, and protecting Bucky who was responsible. He took a long drink from his glass and quickly noted escape routes should he need to use them. He began to tap his finger on the table, he didn't want to get into a fight with Tony-not again- but if Tony was there to arrest him then Steve knew he would have no other option, he was stuck. If he walked out and Tony followed him, that could lead to a fight. If he stayed put then Tony may not want to cause a scene and hurt anyone else, or a swat team was on their way to his location to take him down. There was also another option that Steve hadn't considerd maybe they were both here out of pure coincidence. Steve decided to play it safe, and he gave Tony a brief nod.
“Last I knew you weren't even on speaking terms with him. Now you're saying you've fallen for him? Another man? After he kept the truth about Barnes murdering your parents from you?”
That wasn't the case with Steve apparently. Steve touched it, kissed it, ran his tongue along the skin and scars. Tony sighed and arched his back in reaction. Although he couldn't really feel much of what Steve was doing he still found the gesture to be gratifying. Steve then sat up on his knees and with half lidded eyes on Tony grasped the hem of his own shirt and lifted it off himself. Tony hummed in appreciation as he placed his hands on Steve's narrow waist and trailed up his perfect abs and chest. With a shiver Steve closed his eyes to relish the feeling of Tony's hands on his body, Tony's hands were rough from hard work in his workshop, but it felt so good.
He didn't want to think about it, about her it still hurt too much. Tony shut off the light and went into his bedroom to rummage through the closet for a fresh set of clothes. No use in wallowing in self pity he had work to do and Avengers that were in need of equipment upgrades. Tony headed down to the communal kitchen where Natasha, Bruce and Steve already were seated and eating breakfast. He himself wasn't that hungry he just grabbed himself a cup of coffee as usual and listened to their banter with a soft smile on his face. Even with Pepper gone at least the tower didn't feel so empty with the Avengers present. Clint and Thor came and went, but the others had pretty much made it their permanent home when not on mission.
"Hmm, good I do like to hear you enjoying yourself Tony." He kissed him and brushed his thumb over the head of Tony's cock.
“You're sensitive.” Tony observed, without the pollen in his own system he really could take the time to appreciate every reaction he pulled from Steve.
“Let's face it, we're both probably a little sick for enjoying it.” Tony murmured softly. “but if you want me, I'm game.” They kissed then, a deep passionate kiss. Their lips sliding over one another, their tongues twining together and exploring. When they parted Tony huffed out a breath, the warmth tickling over Steve's wet lips. “Ride me soldier.” Tony ordered with a husky growl.
“Fine, I'm fine, it just took me by surprise. Keep going, god Steve please keep going.” Tony hissed softly as he rolled his hips and pushed himself backwards. Steve's mouth went slack as he breathed heavily, looking down at himself, at the perfect globes of Tony's ass pressed right up against him. He ran his hands over the rounded flesh, digging his fingers in and spread Tony's cheeks so he could see the base of his cock buried between. How tight and stretched the hole looked around his cock, excess lube dribbling out between them. Steve swallowed hard and replaced his hands on Tony's hips, stroking his thumbs over the hollow of the bone and then he gripped hard.
“I can't do that because no one could possibly understand!” Steve bit as he whirled around finally facing Tony, chest heaving with pent up frustration. “None of you...could ever...” He ran a hand through his hair. “The Avengers are all I have left. If I talk I know I'll be removed from the team, and I can't let that happen. I can deal with this. I am dealing with this!”
Normal but there was no normal, not after what had happened to him and what he had done to Tony. What that creature had made him do, but had the centipede really forced him into any of it? Or had it only unleashed his innermost desires? With no moral compass, no ethical understanding or inhibitions had he only acted on impulse? The answers to that were too raw for Steve to handle at that moment. “Can I get more sedatives please? It...it's starting to hurt.” The IV in Steve's arm increased the drip of the morphine and soon he drifted off again into the black void of dreamless sleep.
“You have a sensitive prostate don't you? Want me to finger you soldier? Stroke over your pleasure spot until your a spurting mess?” Tony purred into Steve's ear while still fondling his balls.
“People can try, but I'm not easy to snatch up.” Steve replied with a smile and sipped the new drink that had been set out. Tony being his usual play-boy self, and Steve was aware that Tony was trying to make him uncomfortable, he was not going to fall for it or give Tony the satisfaction. "Are you looking to snatch someone up here? Unwinding and all." He asked.
With a sigh Steve sat back in his chair and took a sip of his drink, he took a glance around at the people idly noting how it looked to be a steady night. There were a decent number of people and the voices of varied conversations filled the space, and there was Tony at the other end looking at-wait- Tony? Steve's eyes snapped back and sure enough Tony was sitting up at the bar looking straight at him. Of course the one time Steve had decided to take a moment to himself he was found. He suspected that Tony had been sent to find him and the others, was he going to attempt to arrest him here? Steve wouldn't put it past Tony to rely on using bystanders as collateral against him.
“Don't be embarrassed. I do kind of like it, but I really like when you use my name.” Steve repositioned himself on the couch, getting onto his knees and leaning over the back, draping his arms over Tony's shoulders. “Especially when I fuck you” Steve kissed him hard and Tony made a nearly obscene sound. Steve didn't talk dirty, but the few times he did it had Tony's dick rock hard in record time. “I like it when you chant my name, when I hear you moaning it when I suck you.” He kissed Tony again, his hands traveled up from Tony's shoulders to his neck and tangled in his hair again. “when I finger you, when I rim you, when I knot you. I love it when you say my name Tony...God Tony...Tony.” Steve kissed him again as he chanted his lover's name emphasizing it's affect.
“Ah too-much-too-too much! Fuck!” Steve panted as the last burbles of his come leaked from his dick, the milky white fluid dribbling down and coating the centipede's underbelly. Steve was shaking, long full body tremors, quivering from over stimulation. He gripped tighter at his thighs still holding himself open, the slick shaft still pumping into him and the legs squeezing and tugging at his sore cock. Steve felt as if he needed scream, the creature flexed and coiled its body closer to him as if to soothe, he couldn't take it anymore it needed to stop he couldn't-
“You don't have to put on the brave face in front of me Rogers. You can talk to Bruce or Natasha, Thor, Clint, anyone. Even me if you needed it.” Tony paused for a moment before continuing as if weighing his words before he spoke. “I get it, I'm possibly the worst person to be giving advice as far as seeking professional help. I've experienced my fair share of unhealthy coping mechanisms, but I recognize that wasn't the best for me and I wouldn't encourage it in others.”
“So there I am covered in mud with the Donkey, a bag full of cocaine and only three shots left in my pistol...” Natasha was finishing up a story of her many adventures with Clint. “and what does Clint sat to me? Did you remember to leave a tip?” They all burst out into laughter. Tony just shook his head obviously missing the point of the story but he still chuckled lightly to be polite. He wasn't a complete douche bag after all. When the laughter died down Steve turned to Tony his eyes flicking down to the blue light...as always it made Tony want to squirm uncomfortably.
“Mmm.” Tony hummed with a smile. He stroked Steve's length and licked him again as more fluid beaded at the tip making Steve groan.
“S-Steve!” Tony gasped and his hips began to rock forward, rutting himself into the centipede's grasp, as good as it felt though Tony wanted the warmth of Steve's mouth wrapped around his cock. -No- Tony knew he was better than that, he wouldn't give into his baser instinct as much as he had wanted something like this with Steve, intimacy, sex, this wasn't the way it should happen. It all felt so good though, Tony could feel himself slipping and falling deeper into the haze from the pollen.
“Reassemble around the hands, remove the helmet for additional support.” Tony ordered FRIDAY. He needed his repulsers if he was going to stand even a remote chance. The armor uncovered Tony's face and a portion of his right shoulder, but he regained use of his weapons. It was like a ripple extending out from the edge around his forearms fluid in its motion until it solidified into the sleek signature red and gold armor of Iron Man.
“So tense...you need to take it easy.” Tony observed as he pressed his thumbs into Steve's stiff shoulders. It felt good.
They made their way up to the penthouse, Steve carrying Tony in his strong arms his hands cupping the man's well shaped ass. Once in Tony's...no...their bedroom. It was a mad dash to remove each other's clothing. Button's flew in the air, a T-shirt was tossed to the floor, belts were removed and pants pooled at their feet. Steve's hands felt over Tony's sides and he captured Tony's lips again in a heated searing kiss. Tony felt Steve walking him backwards and he dropped down onto the bed, Tony gave his alpha a smirk as he brought his knees up, spreading his legs for Steve to get a view. Tony's cock was hard and flushed arching up from the trimmed dark hair of his groin. There was already a steady stream of precome leaking onto his abdomen, his balls pulled up tight, and his thighs glistened with fresh slick. Steve felt a wave of possessive need and want rush through him as he gazed over Tony, his omega.
Steve of course had gotten an early start and although they didn't exactly need the firewood yet he had insisted they prepare for the inevitable winter months. Tony admired the way Steve's arms flexed with each downward swing, he was of course only wearing a light t-shirt that stretched across his broad chest. He had broken into a light sweat and the fabric clung enticingly to his form only emphasizing that shoulder to waist ratio. Steve wiped his forearm across his brow and glanced back at Tony flashing him a grin on his bearded face. Tony had asked him to keep the facial hair, it was rugged, sexy, and just suited the man so well.
Steve memorized the numberh He could see it in Tony's posture that he didn't believe that Steve would show up. In reality he really shouldn't it could be dangerous, a trap even to get him into custody, but something was happening here and it had started in the bar. Steve was determined to see this through.
“Tony...I hope someday...you can see this as I see it.” Steve said while tracing his finger along the edge of the reactor. Tony remained quiet...Steve was insisting on making this emotional...and sweet and all those things that Tony actively avoided. “I know why you hate it and I'm not saying you have no reason to, but I just...I want you to understand why I love it.”
“Poor choice Stark. You cannot defeat me, this is all for the good of the universe for life itself to prosper life must be taken.”
“Good...” Tony closed his eyes and rocked his hips back, going slow at first their combined breathy moans filling the room. He increased his pace, riding Steve's cock like an expert, bouncing on him and relishing the intense heat of pleasure spiking through him with each downward thrust.
“This is you Tony.” Steve whispered in his ear, and kissed at his shoulder. He plunged his finger in and out of Tony's body. It slid in easily, and there was the wet squelch sound of slick skin against skin. Tony wanted to turn and look away, he wanted to tell Steve to stop, but Tony couldn't quite look away. Even as disgusted as he was with his own body the fact that Steve seemed to be enthralled with it made him continued to watch his reflection. “This is how it's supposed to be....look at how well you're made for me. You're built for this...and it's beautiful.”
“I know how we can contact Clint. If he's...out there.” Natasha's somber voice trailed off. If...if he survived Thanos' genocide was left unsaid, but they all knew they were thinking it.
Having enough of watching Steve have all the fun himself the centipede slithered up to him, coiling around Steve's body and rubbing and clutching at his skin almost possessively with its many fleshy legs. Steve shivered from the contact, every brush of its body against his all too sensitive skin sent shocks of pleasure though to his core and cock. Steve found himself on his back the centipede wrapped around him, cushioning his head as it settled its lower body between his legs. Steve looked down finally seeing another appendage jutting out from the centipede's lower body, it was red like the rest of the underbelly and legs, but it was thicker and it too secreted a wet fluid from the tip. It nearly pulsed rhythmically and pressed in closer to Steve's body.
“You can do it babe, come for me.” Tony encouraged through soft panting breaths. He was working his fingers in and out at a rapid pace to keep Steve on edge. Steve was moaning, and writhing on the bed. Every brush of Tony's fingers across his prostate felt incredible, the warmth pooled and grew inside the pleasure ratcheted higher and higher until he felt he couldn't take it anymore. His balls felt tight and throbbed, his cock was stiff and twitching with each stroke over the sensitive bundle of nerves inside his body.
“I'd like to yes, but it's up to you. As I said before, we don't have to.” That pinch of worry in Steve's brow had returned and Tony couldn't have that. He sat up and reached over to Steve to pull him in closer and this time Tony initiated the kiss, a sinful delicious kiss full of tongue and promise.
“Your cock.” Steve begged while splaying his legs further open. “Give me your cock, fuck me hard like before.”
Soon Steve was thrusting his hips back against Tony's wet coated fingers and crying out with each motion as Tony brushed against his spot. “Ahh ohh ohh yes.” Steve moaned. “More, Tony please give me more!”
“Another nightmare.” Steve stated quietly. He ran his fingers though Tony's hair to try and soothe him. “That's all it is Tony, just a nightmare. I know...” Steve swallowed hard. “I know...he did things to you. We nearly lost you, I nearly lost you, but we got there in time remember?”
Steve bit his lip in thought. Did he? He really knew nothing about this man, but since Tony had walked into his chambers Steve had felt as if he were at the mercy of Tony's will. Something about him, his self assured attitude, elegance, Tony knew he was desirable and flaunted it as easily as he breathed. Eventually Steve found himself nodding slowly and uttering a quiet. “...yes...”
“What are you doing?” Tony asked once he found his mouth able to form words again. Steve was fiddling with something on the floor.
Steve headed down into the workshop and punched in his code. He found Tony crouched down under the torso of an Iron Man suit and working on some wiring, Steve couldn't help but take a moment to admire. The tension in Tony's arms as he worked, his eyes focused, brow furrowed in concentration, the way his skin had a shine from sweat and the spots of grease on his arms and shoulders. Tony was truly beautiful when in his element and it took Steve a moment to remember the reason he had come down to the workshop. He shook his head and tried to force those intruding thoughts away, he was better than that.
“If I took it easy I wouldn't be tense and then I wouldn't have an excuse to receive massages from you.” Steve grinned up at him.
“No, No I-I couldn't” Steve stammered. Concubines where the pleasure hosts for the keep. They tended to the lords and guests of Alexander Pierce. Trained in seduction, entertainment, and all forms of pleasure they acted when called upon. Different from the brothels and whores that were paid for, Concubines only offered services to the elite, the highest classes and often were given special treatment by their lords. Some even lived as a sort of second spouse to the wealthy and served their lords as alternative sexual partners to wives or husbands. In return they were free to live in luxury, offered extravagant gifts, decked in jewels, satin, exotic fabrics and metals.
“Did you mean that...what you said at the...I mean when you were. At the end.” Tony's voice was quiet and hesitant. Steve stared off into the opposite end of the room, distracting himself with a poster on the wall. He swallowed in discomfort before he dared to answer.
“Is it really that bad? Please can you just try it for a week? See what happens?” Steve was referring to the suppressants. It was no secret that Steve didn't approve of Tony taking them. The problems in the bedroom had been grating on Tony's nerves as well. Steve was convinced that if Tony let those chemicals out of his system that his body would regulate to normal hormone levels. “I doubt you'll go right into heat, but these suppressants obviously are not working for you. I get that you want to stop the heat, and...the lubricating...but at what point are you just causing yourself more grief.”
“We're not done here Tony!” He said in frustration and set Tony down. “What do you want from me? From this? Do you regret it? Did I make the wrong call in helping you through the heat? I need answers Tony, because you may be capable of just walking away from it as if it were nothing, but I cannot do that. We connected...I know you felt it...we're compatible, but we'll never find out and we'll definitely never bond if you're on suppressants.” Steve ground the words out. He didn't want this to be one sided. He had felt nothing but affection for Tony during the heat, and all he wanted was to take care of Tony. Ensure he was happy and comfortable. “You let me go believing that I had hurt you, that you hate me for taking you during the heat. You never once told me why you were avoiding me.. So tell me now. Why? If it wasn't for the reason I think it was...then why?”
“I'm good, It's good Tony.” Steve panted as he worked his hips and rode Tony. Within minutes Tony was clamping his hands on Steve's waist and grinding himself up into Steve's body. Steve took a cock like a damn pro, he was tight, warm and wet with lube. The velvety walls of his ass clenched and released in a rhythmic motion as his member slid in and out, tight as if to hold him in on the outward stroke, then open and welcome for the thrust back in. Steve was also a sight to behold, beautiful with his muscles tense and his skin gleaming in a fine perspiration as he worked himself on Tony's cock.
Tony couldn't believe this was really happening, he was on his knees sucking off Captain America. What merciful force in the universe had he appeased to grant him this wonderful gift? Tony hummed around Steve's cock as he bobbed his head a few times, taking him down and backing off to the tip, swallowing around him, and using his tongue to stimulate him further. Steve's head shot back as he moaned. Tony was really doing this. Tony was really sucking him off. He clenched the sheets with one hand as he moved his other to grip Tony's hair.
The Avengers returned to the tower after that mission. Steve stayed near Tony to make sure he didn't go into sudden cardiac arrest. The reactor had been damaged in the blast, but Tony assured Steve and the others that he would be okay. Once back at the tower everyone departed to their separate rooms, Tony headed for his workshop for some needed maintenance. Steve went to his own room for a much needed shower, but he felt jittery and couldn't settle down. The images of the arc reactor dim and Tony not moving or breathing was haunting him still. After much internal debating Steve went down to the workshop to check on his friend.
“My ex girlfriend couldn't even stand to look at it, and then there are people like you always staring always making me feel like I'm under a damn microscope.”
Tony swallowed hard and felt his face heat and his stomach twisted in near revulsion. He could see the glistening wetness on his skin. Around his hole, his perineum hell even the back of his balls and inner thighs. He was leaking slick all over, and Steve was using it to finger him. He watched helplessly as Steve pushed the single digit into Tony's channel and he gasped lightly in response to the intrusion. It didn't hurt like he had expected it to, his body was already becoming more pliant to prepare to receive an alpha. It just felt new and foreign to Tony, even though he and Steve had already done this, that had been under the influence of his heat. He didn't have the head-space to really experience it all, to take the time and log away every new sensation.
“Did you?” Steve asked in wonder. He petted his hands over Tony's sides and groped and massaged the perfect globes of his omega's ass cheeks. Tight and perfect and so delectable. It made Steve want to bend down and sink his teeth into the supple flesh.
Steve arched his back, pulling Tony's hair as he moaned. "Tony that feels amazing, it's so good." He was panting. He was breathing heavily. When had Tony gotten so good at blowjobs? He wondered. Steve tried not to thrust too hard into Tony's hot mouth, but Tony was moaning around him. He liked it rough.
Before they had to be quiet for fear of anyone discovering their secret. As much as everyone had been hurting after the initial dusting they both had concerns over what the others would think of them, think of Tony for falling into Steve's bed after losing Pepper so soon. It didn't matter anymore and Tony knew Steve wanted to hear him lose control. So he did. Tony arched his back, he keened, he moaned, and let Steve drive every noise possible from him.
After Steve's morning run he still felt on edge and bothered by Tony's unusual behavior from that morning. He took to the gym to work out some of the growing frustration. He favored the punching bag for these specific situations. Steve had been at it for some time and had worked up a decent sweat from the exertion. He couldn't get the images out of his head from the previous night or the memory of the delectable noises that escaped Tony's mouth in the throes of his pleasure. There had never been any more erotic experience that Steve could compare it too.
“Steve, fuck! I'm coming! I'm coming alpha!” The warmth of Tony's come spilled over Steve's hand and he shuddered through the aftershocks of his orgasm.
Steve lightly caressed Tony's face and planted a soft kiss on his lips. “You're sure you're ready for that? It isn't always pleasant the first time.” Steve warned. The last thing he wanted was to hurt Tony, which with anal was a very high possibility.
“Spread your cheeks and look at your ass...look at how it drips...look at how loose and open you are.” Steve splayed his hands over Tony's hips and reached back to grope at the firm round globes of Tony's rear. “Or I can do it for you...”
“Ride me, ride me Tony. Fuck! Harder you can do it. Harder!” Tony was panting, groaning with every thrust backwards onto Steve's cock. It was perfect each pull back and thrust forward his own cock sliding in Steve's fist. Steve was completely out of it, all he knew was the searing pleasure. He thrust into Tony almost brutally hard as his omega tried to keep up with the pace. It was so much better like this, so much more intense and fulfilling when Tony allowed his body to be natural. Everything about it was right, the sights, the smells, the feeling of the wet heat around his cock. Steve could feel himself getting ever closer to that edge. Steve felt the flooding of sensation all at once, his balls grew tight and his cock literally jerked inside of Tony's ass as he pumped himself in a few more strokes. Steve came with a shout, short abortive little thrusts as he emptied himself, pulse after pulse of his come filling his omega.
Tony was catching his breath while his limbs trembled from the exertion of holding himself up. He felt nearly boneless and loose after the intensity of such an orgasm, but he felt that Steve was still painfully hard inside of him. Tony wanted Steve to enjoy himself as well, despite the ache he was feeling in his backside. “Steve...you can keep going.” He said with a roll of his hips, causing himself to keen quietly from his oversensitive nerves.
“Don't stop.” Tony begged. “Please, please.” Steve sucked the tip into his mouth and Tony moaned while arching his back. Steve let Tony direct him, let his hands grip and tug his hair to move him how he wanted, how deep to take him how long or short the strokes he wanted. Steve let himself be used.
Steve's mouth was flooded with the bitter load, the hot stream pulsed into his mouth and he swallowed it without complaint. He pulled back to catch his breath, Tony was still writhing beneath him and the last few spurts of cum from his cock caught on Steve's lip and chin, in his beard. Tony fell back against the bed boneless and loose, he looked down at Steve still nestled between his legs. The image of perfect debauchery his hair mussed and tangled up, his lips wet and glistening, semi swollen from the work they had performed, and the come trailing down the corner of his mouth, and caught in his beard.
“You like that idea don't you Tony?” Tony could only give a soft mewl in answer. “Say it, come on. I like it when you say dirty things. Tell me you want that.”
Before his was even finished coming his cock began to swell and the knot formed sealing itself within Tony. The two of them caught their breath, Steve still on his knees holding Tony's hips, and Tony stomach down on the bed, his head buried in his arms as he came down from the the post orgasm high.
Steve rubbed the head against Tony's hole, his precome smearing and mixing with Tony's own slick. “Don't you see how incredible you are? You're built for this...and you're perfect. Perfect for me. My omega...you're my omega Tony.” The tip caught on Tony's rim and Steve paused for moment before pushing his hips up slowly, Tony didn't dare to move, and still held his cheeks apart as just the head of Steve's length breached him. Tony moaned from the sensation, the stretch right around his rim and this was just the beginning. Steve slowly pushed himself further in, inch by inch he slipped into Tony's body. Steve lifted his hand to Tony's shoulder to coax him down.
“Tony.” Steve whispered and bent down to plant a needy kiss on his lips. Tony's hands moved down to Steve's pants and decided they both were still very much over dressed for this. With skillful hands Tony worked Steve's belt and pants open, then impatiently began to shove them down. Steve sighed in relief when his cock was freed from the tight fabric, and he shifted his weight to kick off his pants and boxers to the edge of the bed. Tony regarded Steve with envy, want and lust in his eyes as his gaze roamed over his body and focused on the man's impressive dick. Tony licked his lips almost obscenely and Steve felt another wave of hot arousal from that, his cock twitched in anticipation, and a bead of precome drizzled from the tip.
As they continued to kiss they explored one another. Tony couldn't believe Steve was actually allowing him to do this, to touch him so intimately. His hands eased under the hem of Steve's shirt and he stroked over the man's muscled back, and along his sides. He shivered pleasantly when he felt over Steve's hard abs and his impressive chest. Tony had wanted to touch him like this for so long. Steve too ran his hands over Tony's slender body, he was so much smaller than himself. Steve moved above Tony, trailing his lips down Tony's neck. In the back of his mind he knew he should stop, but it had been so long since Steve had been close to someone like this. Tony was hard and horny for him, Steve couldn't stop himself not when Tony was so desperate.
“You're the only one I really wanted Steve...now please...don't make me wait!” Tony gave a slow roll his hips back and brushed himself against the tip of Steve's leaking cock. Steve took that encouragement and ran his hand over Tony's back soothingly.
Tony shook his head, his body was spent, he felt exhausted, sore and there was an ache he knew he'd be feeling for days, but ending this now meant returning to their bleak reality. Tony wasn't read to face the darkness again just yet. “No I can handle it. I'm not missing an opportunity to see you come twice in a night.” With that Tony tensed his muscles and he clenched up, squeezing the length of Steve's cock making the man groan. “and sounds like you need it.” Steve raised up back on his knees again and with a grunt he pulled his cock free from Tony's rear. “I told you it's okay.”
Tony's cries increased in volume, while he began to thrust his own hips forward into Steve's tightening fist. Steve met the motion and rhythm with his own thrusting, and after a few strokes he felt Tony tense beneath him.
Tony raised himself up on his elbows and looked back at Steve over his shoulder. “I figured after what we had done already that maybe I could give this another try again. Let's face it. Sex is...it's so much better off the suppressants. I wanted to know if I could let myself try it again and, fuck, Steve hearing you seeing the way you look at me. All needy and wanting me...just me...” Tony gave a slow roll of his hips back against Steve and shifting his knot ever so slightly the walls of his body clenching around him. So wet, tight and warm all over. Steve's mouth fell open in a gasp.
“No, no, no, nothing like that. I just want to try something.” Tony nudged Steve with his knee and pulling out of him Steve shifted on the bed. He laid back with Tony straddling him, his hands instantly holding Tony's narrow hips. Tony got comfortable and positioned Steve's dick against his entrance and slipped down onto him with ease. The slide was quick and easy and they both groaned in the pleasure of it. “You-you like this?” Tony asked, his voice pitched low and shaky while he gave an experimental rotation of his hips. His hands braced on Steve's chest for support.
Tony slipped his arm around Steve's waist and leaned into him. “No sense dwelling on what-ifs. It happened and we're here now.”
Tony's eyes flicked down to both their hands and then back to Steve's face. “This probably is a bad idea.” He stated and Steve's expression fell to dismay. “-But when have I ever been a reasonable man? Bad idea...good idea...it doesn't matter. I have wanted you for a long time now, but I never thought you'd want me or that I even deserved you.”
“Ignore it.” Steve panted. “Not like anyone else is around to hear it either.” Steve's lips were on Tony's again in a deep plundering kiss. They both moaned into it as Steve's cock grazed over Tony's pleasure spot causing the man to clench up around Steve's shaft. “I want to hear you Tony, please.”
“I won't ask the servants, they are paid for a job which is cleaning, and cooking, I won't exploit them. I know of too many lords that do so already and I won't be one of them.” Steve replied with a frown.
In response Tony gently pushed Steve back onto the bed, and crawled over top of him and kissed Steve breathless. It was a less fierce dominating kiss, it was deep and romantic, and Steve found himself clinging to the man above him. He never wanted to let go of Tony ever again, and that wasn't only an effect of the pollen.
Steve shook his head, he wouldn't let Tony just brush it aside. He knew how Tony handled trauma, he internalized it and let it fester. Steve refused to let Tony do that. “Tony stop trying to rationalize it. We both know what happened in there!” Steve couldn't fight the burning of his eyes as the wetness welled up in them.
Tony wet his lips with his tongue as he looked, and looked, he had never allowed himself this before. To just openly stare in such a way, but Steve didn't seem to mind. His body was like it had been sculpted for perfection. Broad strong shoulders and arms, rock hard abs with a narrow waist, firm well shaped ass, powerful long legs, and an amazing cock. He was long and thick, the tip glistened wetly from the precome leaking out. Steve reached a hand down, swiping his thumb along the tip collecting the clear fluid, and smearing it down his shaft.
Tony sat up again and glowered at Pepper. “Don't you think I realize that? That's why this is such a giant problem.”
“S-Someth-InGggG Is D-dD-DD-Draining Power.” FRIDAY's automated voice distorted as Tony watched helplessly as the bleeding edge armor around his hands began melting away from his body.
Tony let out a heavy sigh and leaned back in his chair. He stared up at the ceiling for a moment. “Steve Rogers, and everyone would wonder what in the world would lead a perfect alpha like him to settle for anyone like me? There is way too much scrutiny, too much risk.”
“You ready to return to the world Captain?” Tony asked while they walked outside and towards the waiting aircraft. Steve paused right outside the open bay door and looked back over the palace and the city. Okoye and her guard were seeing them off, standing nearby, Shuri with them as well. Wakanda was a beautiful country, but it carried too many terrible memories.
Steve wanted this to be good, he wanted this to be an experience Tony could never forget. He reached his hand around Tony and gripped the brunette's cock and gave a few strokes to help him reach his climax. “Yes Tony, I want you to come. Don't hold back, this is for you. Come for me!” Steve squeezed the hard length, and moved his hand quickly along the shaft.
Nothing got past Natasha. She was a master spy after all but it was sometimes a little scary how well she could catch onto people. Not that Steve thought this situation was well hidden. Tony hadn't been within the same floor as Steve for nearly a week now and it was driving Steve mad with worry, and guilt.
“I liked it. A lot actually. Well except when...uh...you know I...” He gestured unhelpfully. “Prematurely.” Tony forced out. Steve's eyebrows went up in surprise at that rather intimate admission. A sudden heat spiked inside that he chose to ignore as he cleared his throat.
Tony reciprocated the kiss, sucking lightly on Steve's lower lip before he pulled back to look up at him. “So...you're saying you want me to date and try it out with other people, but we can fool around if we want to?” Steve nodded in reply. Tony gave Steve a soft kiss and whispered against his lips. “Deal...”
“NO!” Steve clamped his hands on either side of his head and hunched over on his bed as he tried to will the images away. He was hard, painfully hard, and leaking from the tip of his cock. This had been going on for weeks now and Steve feared that it wasn't getting any better. If he couldn't get past this then he would surely be removed from the team.
Tony shook his head and just gave him a small smile. “Nothing.” He gave one of the goats a scratch behind the ear. Steve shook his head and leaned over planting a kiss on Tony's cheek, making Tony chuckle lightly from the scratch of Steve's beard on his skin.
“You're an insufferable little punk sometimes.” Steve said as he reached over and affectionately ruffled Tony's dark brown hair.
Steve believed that if he could get it out of his system then he could move on with his life, but in trying discovered a whole new problem. His guilt and anxiety over everything, the content of his fantasies made it impossible for him to reach any sort of release. Steve couldn't come. No matter what he tried, even when swapping to mental fantasies that had worked for him in the past he could feel he was on the very cusp of an orgasm, but could never get any further beyond that. He would stand in the shower, or lay awake in his bed stroking over his cock for long minutes sometimes nearly an hour until his skin was chaffed and raw. Still there was nothing.
One night they laid together in bed, Tony resting up against Steve's chest, an arm draped across him.
Tony had to turn back and braced his hands on Steve's chest as he took the last few inches of Steve's alpha cock. It burned and it stretched him so far. Tony couldn't believe how easily they had done this during his heat. Tony was settled, resting on Steve's thighs and his ass feeling impossibly full. Steve let out a shaky breath as he held still so Tony could acclimate to his size. It was all so good, better than good. Tony gave a little rock of his hips and Steve shuddered beneath him.
“Truth be Captain, I believe our strongest option to finding outside assistance will be from the rabbit and his crew, I believe we can-”
“There has been a lot of damage, and the stone had acted as a power source. I could reconnect the synapses but without a power source I am unable to do much. I'm sorry.”
Steve stood there silently, still sporting his uniform a bit more worn and the star and stripes blackened out. His hair was longer and he had grown a beard out, in all honesty the look suited him well. Tony wasn't certain what Steve was expecting from him, there was already a thick tension in the air and he wanted it to go away. He didn't need Steve to be a reminder of his past mistakes, sure in the moments he had been staring down death he had all the notions of making it right with Steve, of fixing this...unnamed something...that never had been.
“Yours, all of me is yours.” Tony glanced down and discovered that Steve's member had begun to grow hard again. “I can't get enough of you.” Steve admitted.
“Please...” Steve begged, his voice cracking and his thighs trembling. The centipede clicked its pincers together as if it were pleased, and its coiled body flexed around him. The tip pressed into Steve's hole and slid deep into his channel, the glide was smooth and easy it had Steve's head lolling back while he moaned with pleasure. It enclosed its legs around his stiff cock once more, encased in the warm rippling heat while it shifted and pulled its length out and shoved it back into Steve. The fluid the centipede was secreting trickled down and out of Steve's ass, it was so wet and messy. He felt defiled and used, but in such a good way.
“God you are so hungry for it Steve, never knew that Captain America was such a cock hungry slut.” Tony couldn't control the words that tumbled from his mouth, he could be crude when it came to dirty talk. Had this occurred during different circumstances Tony probably wouldn't have elected to use such wording, but his head was fuzzy from the pollen, and it all spilled out without any filter. Steve apparently responded well to it, his body shuddered beneath Tony.
When he strolled into the lab Steve had merely spared a glance not wanting to bring too much unwanted attention to the device and instead hounded Tony for attempting to illicit a hulking out response from Dr. Banner. Their working relationship had been off to a fantastic start...sarcasm intended. At first when they had bickered back and forth Steve hadn't understood what had come over him other than the need to speak his mind and break Tony down in every feasible way possible. Attack his ego, make him vulnerable and expose him as a self serving narcissist.
“Come for me soldier!” Steve didn't have to be told twice, he sank down hard onto Tony's dick the head ramming into his already abused prostate. Steve's body shook as he came for the second time, spilling over Tony's abdomen and marking him with filthy evidence of their deeds. Steve's shoulders slumped slightly as he caught his breath. His balls were starting to ache already, both his orgasms had felt incredible, but Tony hadn't reached his climax yet. Steve knew he could go at least one more time. He swiveled his hips and clenched his ass.
“Doesn't that hurt? You have to be oversensitive!” Tony protested but there was no denying how good it felt. Still, even as much as Tony wanted to reach his own release he was willing to wait and do the deed himself if needed. The last thing he wanted was for Steve to hurt himself in trying to pleasure him.
“Just stare when you think I'm not looking. I notice, and you do it a lot. You just get this look on your face, I don't really know how to describe it.” Steve's deep blue eyes met with Tony's. “I don't know what you're thinking. At first I thought maybe it was you picturing Pepper in my place-”
“No-No it's okay.” Steve stated. “Relax I won't tell anyone that you said anything. As far as I'm concerned whatever you say or do here tonight stays in this room. I will respect you as a model should be respected, and that includes a level of confidentiality.” He gave Tony a small reassuring smile so he knew that what he said was genuine. Slowly he saw Tony's shoulders relax, his dark eyes narrowed slightly as if suspicious of Steve's good intentions. After a moment he nodded and hummed to himself in thought.
“I'm sorry! I may have gone too hard on you.” Steve rubbed soothing circles into Tony's lower back with his hands. “It will hurt for a couple days.” He then reached over and flipped off the light from the lamp on the desk.
“Wait here, I'll be back.” Tony patted his thigh and got up from the bed and padded over to the bathroom. Steve sighed and closed his eyes as he waited, hearing water running from the tap and the sounds of a toothbrush scrubbing over teeth. Ah, yeah that made sense given where Tony's mouth had just been. Steve realized he must have dozed off for a moment because next he knew there was a warm dampness on his stomach. He opened his eyes lazily and saw that Tony was carefully wiping him down with a warm towel.
Steve stared at the vial of pollen. Tony's solution was to use the very substance that had caused this whole mess for them. Any sane person wouldn't consider putting themselves through such an ordeal again, but Steve trusted Tony and this plan of his. Only now, what was Tony expecting him to do with the pollen? Was Tony going to hand off that vial to him, wish him well and leave Steve to take care of the problem alone? He felt a sudden wave of disappointment he had hoped...before Tony had implied that he wanted to help him in a more intimate way. He must have been having second thoughts on the matter, maybe sleep deprivation had clouded his initial judgment.
“Cap.” Tony greeted. “Something you need? Upgrades? Uniform needs adjustment? Bad guys running amok in our city?” He listed off the usual reasons people came down to interrupt him.
Steve shook his head and wiped at his moist eyes. “Not entirely on you. I let you do it against my better judgment.” Steve sniffled a bit. “I shouldn't have entered the lab alone. Jarvis even warned me not to, but I charged ahead without backup.”
“Tony you still have your entire life ahead of you. You could meet someone that would be perfect for you...I don't age with the serum. I couldn't do that to you, and you need to understand it would be incredibly hard for me to face that. To watch the people I care about fade away and I just stay here...stuck.” Steve touched Tony's face lightly. “I'm not saying no, but I just want you to have all the options open.
“It's not everyday we are given such a request. We are often referred to as exotic beauties, our lords shower us with compliments and gifts, but to be captured as a work of art. Now that is something and perhaps the most flattering of requests. I do hope I meet your desires for a model.”
“There is this study abroad program I applied for in advanced robotics and engineering.” Tony gave Steve all the details of it, talking animatedly about it all what he hoped to learn. Not everyone let Tony talk about his passions like this. People often grew disinterested as they couldn't follow what he was even talking about most of the time. Steve though, even when he didn't understand he tried and would always give Tony his full attention. Tony could talk to Steve for hours, it was one of the many reasons he adored him.
Steve ran his hands through Tony's hair, and rocked his hips up harder against him, enjoying the feeling of Tony's hands groping him. He moaned at the feeling of Tony's nails raking down his back” “Tony” Steve said in a strained voice “ I need you." and he began to trial kisses along Tony's neck.
Hot...he felt so hot his skin was ablaze with a heat that sweat began to prickle along his brow. He felt it in his lower back, his neck, thighs, arms, everywhere. The centipede moved coiling itself around Steve's middle, its many legs dug into him seemingly holding him tightly. The legs Steve had expected to feel sharp and angular were actually soft, fleshy like its all too squishy body. They massaged along his torso like a lover's caress but...no...this was a monster he had to stop it. That was his reason for being here.
"I know.” Steve said leaning in close to Tony's ear to kiss, and nip at his lobe. He sucked it between his teeth, and bit gently making Tony gasp, and writhe under him. Steve sped up his hand, adding a twist of his wrist on each upward stroke over the head making Tony shudder.
“I don't want to hurt you.” He forced himself to say and willed his hips to be still despite how much his body craved for more of that delectable touch.
For his time in quarantine Steve had managed to hide the awkward boners from Jarvis since his vitals were only monitored at certain times of the day. At first Steve suspected it was only a side affect, that there was still some of the pollen in his system, but with Bruce's careful monitoring it turned out that wasn't the case at all. Steve felt disgusted with himself and chose to keep it to himself. If anyone found out he would be removed from the team for sure. He focused on trying to sleep and ignore the persistent throbbing erection in his pants.
His mind drifted to a hot mouth on his cock, sucking and licking, his hands clutching into short blonde hair. Tony could picture it, Steve' Rogers on his knees in full uniform sucking his cock, hungry for it, running his tongue along the length and taking the head into his mouth. It'd be wet, sloppy and so sexy, Steve's perfect lips around him, pink and a little swollen, shiny with saliva. He'd nuzzle into Tony's groin, kiss at his inner thigh and softly lick and suck on Tony's balls. Then he would swallow Tony's length down again, all the way to the root he'd take him into that wet cavern to suck and bob his head. Tony would spill his load into that mouth and Steve would hum with pleasure, his throat contracting as he swallowed. Steve would pull back and look up at Tony his pupils dialated with arousal and drop a hand to cup himself through the uniform a dribble of Tony's come leaking down the corner of his mouth.
Steve finally stilled, and he went lax on the bed, his hands loosely held Tony's hips. Steve's knot began to fill, expand and stretch Tony further. Steve only groaned as the pressure around his cock increased further, making his length throb and harden more. Tony was tense, right on the edge but he waited...he waited for his alpha. Steve slowly slid his hands up and down Tony's sides and along his sweaty thighs. Tony gave a small keen of need.
“It's okay Tony...it's okay it's never easy. Just relax, relax for me, breath out there you go. There you go.” He praised and soon his finger was sliding easily into Tony's body. Tony gave soft little mewls and light gasps while Steve worked his finger in and out of him. “You're doing so good.”
