Tony doesn’t show his shock, doesn’t jerk away in surprise when Steve’s wet face cradles in the space between his neck and shoulder. Soothingly Tony rubs Steve’s back, letting the broken cries come. He doesn’t interrupt, he doesn’t shush the man. He lets Steve sniffle and cry. He lets his t-shirt accumulate the tears of a man who seems lost.
Steve stiffens for a moment, his body grows tense and his breathing ragged before he speaks, voice tight.
Four weeks of passing notes to each other has maybe given Tony a high school crush on Steve. They have gone from notes on small sticky pads to longer more elaborate letters as the exchange has gone on. Tony will share fun stories of his adventures with Peter and Steve illustrates them, or draws fun adventures he has been on with his friends. If the notes have developed into a small crush nobody can blame Tony. Steve is funny and clever and Peter likes him which means something, it means everything. So, if Tony spends a few extra minutes in front of the mirror trying to tame the very curls he shares with Peter, that’s just because he wants to look nice for a friend.
“Alright, Tony,” Steve sighs, the smile on his face betrays him as he scoops several different ice creams into his bowl. If Tony wants Steve to build a monster of a sundae then he will do exactly that.
MJ nods, leaning into Tony’s fingers as he braids her hair. He makes quick work of two braids before standing her up.
Steve nods, prompting Tony to pull the man over. He adjusts so he’s sitting sideways on the couch, legs crossed under Steve’s head. Skittishly Tony runs slim fingers through Steve’s hair, massaging lightly at his scalp as he does.
“No,” Steve’s voice is insistent now. The way Peter sounds when he wants ice cream badly enough he’ll actually speak to Tony for it instead of poking his father in the sides and signing to him.
“Hey, guys, please don’t leave without saying goodbye? I’m gonna get Pete ready for bed.” Tony wants to thank the men for their help, wants to pay Steve back for the hard work he did tonight, painting the faces and hands of 25 kids, and the beautiful decorations he definitely has to let Tony reimburse him for. He needs to thank Bruce and Clint for making the night seem like less of a train wreck with their stories for the kids and the laughs they shared with him when he felt like a failure.
“Make him a sandwich?” Peter asks, eyes wide as he opens his lunch box back up, checking to make sure there is room for an addition.
Tony doesn’t know it takes so many adults to teach a first grader. When it came time to enroll Peter asked to continue going to the school his mom sent him too. Tony, not wanting to be a bad parent already has Pepper check out the school before allowing it. He’s never personally been inside the building until this evening, though, and he is overwhelmed. He’s thankful that Peter is so excited. The feeling of anxiety building in his chest and Peter’s excitement prompt Tony to just follow Peter as he leads the way. He follows obediently as he’s carted from room to room.
. There will be no prisoners, he thinks Tony yells that at some point in time, as they charge the building.
After that the routine changes. Monday, Wednesday and Friday Tony has to make an extra lunch for Mr. Rogers. On these days Tony always sends Peter’s lunch out with a note. Sometimes a thank you, sometimes a random thought, sometimes a strange fact Tony had recently discovered. Always the note would get returned. Many times, the note that was delivered back to Tony was a drawing. Thank yous were returned with doodles of Peter, signing something passionately as he sat in front of his lunch. Random thoughts were illustrated humorously and returned to Tony for a laugh. Strange facts were accompanied by drawings of Tony in the lab, sometimes post explosion, other times surrounded by tech with a smile on his face. He is always shocked at the level of detail in the doodles Steve sends back. He saves every drawing, specifically the ones of Peter.
Tony doesn’t expect his note to be returned with another. Elegant writing written on a piece of customized stationary, in the corner the top portion of a star is outlined in chunks of blue, and circled in red. It reminds Tony almost of a flag.
“Yes, sir. Mr. Stark didn’t want you having to worry about transportation you see? So, he sent me.” Happy stands proudly, hands clasped together in front of him. “He made sure I got here early so we can leave whenever you would like. Drive to the tower takes anywhere from thirty to forty-five minutes. To get there close to eleven thirty, we should leave by ten-thirty at the latest.”
“Yeah actually, I like that option. Is everybody okay with Buffy?” Three small heads nod in Tony’s direction, they’re focused on building huge sundaes. “Jay— “
“Thank you for telling me Steve. That sounds… sounds like quite the list of experiences. I’m sorry you can’t share more of it with those around you. If you ever want to talk, I’m here. Even if you can only speak in generalities.” Tony smiles.
“I was scared you know,” Tony’s voice is quiet and when Steve opens his eyes he looks almost like he isn’t sure he should have said anything at all. But he doesn’t stop, he sips his coffee, takes a moment to compose himself and continues. “I was scared and I felt like shit. That’s why I never returned your texts, never called you back. I just…” he trails off, a distant look on his face.
“Yes, Sir, it’s good.” If JARVIS could smile, if his voice was able to fluctuate enough to show emotion Tony thinks it would right now. The A.I. sounds proud.
“I told them you don’t like raisins on your peanut butter and celery, they decided to prank you,” Tony laughs. He’s beautiful.
A moment of silence passes, when Steve thinks he might have some small iota of Tony’s attention again he speaks. “To start with. I get more than three to four hours of sleep a night.”
“Fell asleep on the couch, kiddo.” Steve smiles, gesturing to himself. Showing the kids he’s wearing the outfit from yesterday.
“I—is this okay, Steve?” Tony whispers. “This is what I do for Peter when he wakes up from a nightmare. It helps him.”
“I used ta be this li’l guy,” Steve whispers. His breath ghosts over the sensitive skin of Tony’s neck and the man has to bite down on a shudder. “I used ta be smaller ‘an you. I was probably 100 pounds soaking wet.”
He’s a teacher but even he isn’t ready for the atomic levels of energy these kids showcase as they run to the doors. They’re bouncing and Peter is adding small phrases to his signing because his hands just can’t keep up with everything he wants to say. The small boy, MJ and Ned stand off to the side, their hands and lips moving a million miles an hour as they use some strange language developed just for them.
“I.. Tony. I-I heard g-gunshots? Maybe. I n-needed to get to safety. I-it’s c-cold.” Steve’s voice is soft, confused and scared. The way Tony knows he sounds when he comes out of nightmares about his time in the cave.
—child. An amount much less than Tony thought she would have wanted. So, he pays off her student loans as well, and sets up an external account for the child.
“They feed off each other.” Steve supplies, trying to ignore the soft moan, the way Tony’s tongue slides over his pink lips. “When together kids create an endless loop of energy. Work on that and you may no longer need arc reactor tech.”
“I,” Steve’s voice is husky, the pupils of his eyes blown wide. He leans in, touches his forehead to Tony’s.
, Peter signs, pointing to a Hispanic boy next to him. The kid is bigger than Peter, but Tony is unsure if that was normal since he and Peter run on the small side.
“Then—” he pauses, still trying to wrap his head around what could be happening. Adrenaline wears down quickly though, leaving Tony in desperate need of caffeine.
“It’s not selfish to want to be happy, Tony,” Steve whispers. He has so much he wants to say, so much he feels he needs to say. But he isn’t sure what words are appropriate for the moment, or if they will even come out right. So instead he just adds, “And it will never be bad to put your sons needs first. I understand.” As soon as the words are out of Steve’s mouth the heaviness lifts, once again the kitchen feels like the fun environment he walked into.
“How can we help Pep?” Tony whispers, pouring water from the steaming kettle into the mug sitting in front of the redheaded woman.
“Hey, that’s swell, Tony. If I can help would you let me know? I can bring face paints for the kids, I think they would love that. And if you let me know early enough I can create some decorations? Unless you don’t want my help, then I understand. I’m sure you can handle it, I mean. You
“It felt fucking selfish, is what it felt,” he finishes resolutely, taking a long drink of his coffee. “But Brucie came over the night after and set me straight. It’s not selfish to like you. Fuck, I mean… at Shield Magnet it’s not even harmful to your job or Peter’s education as long as we can stay professional. I just... I’m sorry I didn’t contact you. I felt I needed to get that all straight in my head before I took it to you.”
“I, uh, thank you.” Steve blushes. Fiddling with the card in his hands for a moment before looking to Peter, who is pulling on the man’s hand, placing the customized goodie bag in the hand he’s offered. “Is this for me?” Peter just nods. Signing a quick thank you to the teacher before grabbing his dad’s hand and dragging him away.
So, he sits and quietly listens. Because this is part of what he wants, he wants to get to know Steve.
Tony watches, his heart tightening painfully, as Steve glances listlessly around his room. Eyes wet and searching. He looks as if he needs something, wants to find something, but isn’t quite sure where he is. So, Tony takes his hand, lacing his fingers with Steve’s larger hand. His fingers are stained with paint, always stained with paint.
“Jay, dial Pep. I don’t have time for this.” Tony turns his back and begins searching for a different mug for his coffee. Since Red won’t let him have his he will just have to use a different one, he bristles at his annoyance. Tony hates feeling like a child.
Two rooms later, on a real stage with beautiful props and costumes, MJ delivers a moving speech. She poetically speaks on the plight of all six-year-olds. Homework? Indoor class? No snack time? These things simply will not stand. It’s the land of opportunities, MJ says, voice full of passion. Less homework, no, no homework! Classes outdoors during nice days, they deserve it. Snack time, like recess, should be a requirement! Tony cheers MJ along.
“Yes, honey, we are able to do that, and we can invite as many of your classmates as you would like.”
“Sounds like you have it figured out,” Steve trails off, unsure of what to say next, where to go from here. There are so many things he wants, needs, to say. “Ton—“
“You’re confident Mr. Stark,” MJ smiles, eyebrow quirked high as she appraises Tony. “But I bet I can beat you.”
Steve simply nods. Following Tony out from under the bed. His movements are jerky and stiff. Tony wonders how long he was hidden under the bed before he was able to call.
, you to have custody of Peter. She chose you. That means something Stark. She saw something nobody else sees.” The woman pours herself another cup of his coffee. “We can offer some help if you choose to take Peter in.”
So Tony stays. Tony curls around Steve and promises, to nobody in particular, while breathing in the heady smell of Steve. He smells of art. Of paint, paper, and clay. But also of the earth, he smells like a bonfire on a Friday night in October, the smell of sweet burning cedar mixing with the sharp smell of paint to make a scent that is so completely Steve. Tony drinks it in, let’s his senses be surrounded in Steve. He hopes that his presence, his body wrapped around Steve in nothing more than a friendly embrace, comforts Steve the way it comforts him.
“I just didn’t know how to react. I like you, Steve. I like you a lot. But so… my life… I couldn’t reconcile the fact that I become a father. A real, actual father to Peter. Peter is amazing, he’s fantastic, he’s beautiful. He’s everything, Steve. It just felt like—like, I became a father and my first executive decision was to go develop this huge, nerve wracking crush on one of my son’s favorite teachers. Then I kiss him and it just—“ Tony cuts himself off again. A moment passes while he stares into the distance, this moment seems to stretch longer, it feels heavier. Steve isn’t sure what Tony is about to say, but he knows the man needs to get it out. For better or worse.
The first night goes great, though Tony is on edge almost the entire time, waiting for something to go wrong. He fidgets and squirms, waiting for Natasha to come to her senses and snatch up the little boy, stealing him out of Tony’s life forever. But that doesn’t happen, instead Natasha stays for a while to help Peter settle in. They unpack his items together, the young boy stoic as Tony helps hang clothes and place more books on the already stuffed shelves. After they’re finished unpacking they order pizza, Peter’s current favorite is chicken with pineapple, and watch a movie.
“Hey Pete, Ned, MJ, why don’t you all go clean up Peter’s bedroom? After that, have Jay play two episodes of whatever kid appropriate show you want to watch, then lunch should be ready.”
A soft whimper from the lone door on the left. Followed by the sound of somebody trying not to move. Tony guesses this is Steve’s room.
“Only 28 years until she runs for president,” Tony chuckles, nudging Steve in the side. “Do you think her platform will still stand on naps and snack time? Because if so she has my vote.”
Peter loves bath time, which makes it easy. He plays and giggles and let’s Tony wash his hair just fine. He asks Tony to refill the tub with more bubbles twice, huge doe-eyes large and full of excitement each time. How can Tony say no? He draws the line when Peter’s head starts drooping, eyes falling closed for long seconds before jerking back open.
“Scans show Mr. Roger’s temperature has rapidly dropped two degrees in the last 97 seconds. His heart rate is increased, though his respirations are normal I think it would be best if you sat down. I’ll adjust the heat.”
“Yes, good. I—well, I’m glad. That’s good, right?” Tony questions, absentmindedly running the wet towel over his chest, lingering for a moment over the arc reactor.
A petite woman named Jan teaches the literature classes. She gushes to Tony for nearly twenty minutes about Peter’s reading comprehension and how beautiful his handwriting is before letting them go.
“Let’s play a game, Underoos and co. I was thinking Clue, but with a twist. Of course, I will know whodunit first, I feel I have to give that warning. But, I am a fair man, I’ll hear out other options. Let it be known that I will beat you at those games as well, though.”
Steve stays for a moment, and Tony tries to hide his excitement. This is good, right? Steve is staying because he wants to, because the notes and the texts mean that maybe they can be friends or more than friends.
So maybe it is about more than just an overworked, intern forgetting the cake. It’s not about the fact that Peter’s costume needs a few tweaks and Tony forgot to have JARVIS prescreen all the parents that will be at the party tonight. Okay, Tony rationalizes. It’s those things plus he got to meet May and Ben last week. They shared beautiful stories of the parties Mary would throw for Peter. She would spend months planning and make sure that everything went over flawlessly, perfectly. Which is why Tony needs to do good today. He needs to make sure that Peter loves his party. That the kids have fun and they laugh and play. But most importantly Tony needs to make sure that there is cake.
Other nights, bad nights, he pulls out the thermal blanket, turning it all the way up. Shivering in his long sleeve t-shirt and sweats, even as his hair plasters to his head with the sweat.
“Well I’m glad, as well,” Tony whispers. “You should go play. I better see photos of you all from the photo booth.”
Peter hasn’t spoken since his mother and step father passed away. He is fairly proficient in American sign language, as proficient as we can expect a five-year-old to be, since Mary had been teaching him. He now communicates primarily through sign (he writes when the people around him don’t understand). Peter’s hearing is okay. He shows some signs of hearing loss (nothing alarming as of yet, but I will attach information for his current audiologist) but he can understand when people speak clearly and slowly.
Tony sighs, heart hurting for Steve, aching for the loss of a friend. He thinks for a moment, about how Rhodey came for him in the desert. Even after everybody thought he was dead and decaying Rhodey kept searching. He remembers with a sharp ache in his chest that he thought of Rhodey every day of his captivity. Thoughts of his best friends would fill his head at night in his dreams, or when he was being held underwater by hands much stronger than he.
“Hey, Steve. Hey, do you want me to stay? Petey is with his aunt and uncle. I have the tower to myself until Monday after school. Would… can I stay?”
His eyes, wide and excited, take in the sight in front of him before turning to the adults. The excitement on his face melts into confusion as he brings his right pointer finger to his head before moving it out two quick times.
“So, what now underoos?” He smiles to the child, who blinks at him slowly, brown eyes tired. Tony watches as Peter fists his little hands and brings them down over his abdomen, up and down again.
The events of the night before come rushing back to Steve as soon as he sets his eyes on Tony. He remembers the amazing day at the Staten Island Children’s Museum, dinner at the small Italian restaurant with employees who know Tony by heart. Coming home to settle the kiddos into bed. Then the anxiety attack, Tony’s soothing voice and fingers threading through his hair. Falling asleep to the sound of Tony’s soft words and hushed laughter.
, he signs, pointing to a girl on his other side. She has pretty olive skin, almost like Tony’s and hair that falls in a mess of waves, reminiscent of a waterfall.
The way Tony says betrothed, full of light and humor, fills Steve with a want for… something. He thought after conferences, after the kiss on Halloween that the joke would start to fall flat. Instead, he finds the joke still makes him laugh, still reminds him why he enjoys Tony’s friendship.
“I can’t believe I’m about to say this but I’m bad with dates. I can remember numbers okay, though so I can tell you it had been something like four hundred and sixty days since JARVIS was born. Well, I needed to update him. Even though he’s an A.I. he needs checkups and like… vaccinations I guess. So, I write this beautiful code, I start at the bottom again, because Jay deserves nothing but the best. But when I go to upload it I find I’m locked out…”
So, Tony is anxiously waiting while JARVIS calls every other bakery in the area because he needs a cake for this party. He needs this cake to show Peter he can be a good parent, that he can do so many of the things that Mary could. To show everybody that he can step up to the plate and be a fucking parent.
They destroy the cake and leave at least a slice or two for the adults in the room, so Tony assumes the cake is a hit too. After cake, everybody starts to file out. Peter and Tony hand out goodie bags at the elevator doors. Signing thank you to everybody who came. As the floor empties out Tony feels the tightness in his chest let up. It was awful but at least it was over and he could regroup with his son.
It’s the last part that brings tears to Tony’s eyes. In the almost five months they’ve been together Peter hasn’t called Tony anything other than Mr. Stark yet. This is a move in the right direction.
“Oh,” Steve schools his face, adopting the same serious demeanor he does when the kids are telling him some very serious gossip that occurred over lunch. “I wouldn’t dream of it Tony. This mug is a treasure.”
“You’re bringing Buffy to the table but apparently ‘Who Killed Mr. Stark’ was pretty violent?” Tony’s voice is disbelieving.
“You’re here early, honeybunches.” Tony mutters conspiratorially to Steve. Turning the music down with a gesture of his hand. “You that excited to see me?”
But the kids have been fed and they have played all over Tony’s communal floor for almost two hours so they swarm the food and barely even leave crumbs so at least dinner is a hit.
Steve’s house is, nice. The front door leads into a spacious living room, a large t.v. and a worn, but comfortable looking couch and easy chair take up the majority of this room. The house is old, but not in disrepair. Tony guesses the house was built in the twenties, maybe Steve inherited it. He makes his way down a short hallway, two doors to his right, and one to his left. A small kitchen sits at the end of the hallway. During the phone call, Steve told Tony he was under the bed. The kitchen is too far if that’s the case. It looks like the French doors only open to a backyard. One of the doors to his right or left contains Steve’s room.
“Yeah,” Tony whispers, voice soft and reverential as he traces the shape of the reactor in his chest.
“Fridge, right side. Third pull out drawer. It has all of the snacks Peter and I premade. They’re pretty well rounded out. Just grab whatever looks interesting to you.”
?” Steve’s voice is broken, lost in a way that immediately jerks Tony into the land of the sober and the waking.
“You stop that Rogers, otherwise I might not feed you,” Tony quips, pouring himself a cup of coffee before settling in the little breakfast nook and motioning for Steve to come sit with him.
It takes less time than usual, only fifteen minutes, for Tony to get a partied-out Peter bathed and in bed. It’s not even eight when Tony tucks Peter in, kissing his forehead and signing ‘I love you’ to his son. Peter hasn’t said it back yet, Tony isn’t rushing him. His mom died only six months ago. So, when Peter sleepily holds up his right hand, middle and index finger pointed down and holds it out to Tony, his heart clenches a bit.
MJ only nods, an austere look on her face as she spirals a huge serving of whipped topping onto her sundae.
“That would be amazing. I have a few parenting books and JARVIS has been giving me recommendations on parenting blogs.” Tony knows he’s rambling. It’s what he does when he is nervous and he’s so nervous because what if Natasha realizes he isn’t ready for this? Realizes Ben and May will be better parents than Tony can? They have more to offer. “Basically, JARVIS has helped me with learning some of the basics and I’m hoping the rest I can get help for.”
He eats his food, enjoying the taste of food ma would have made for him on a cold December night when a fever hit. Steve tries not to think too hard on what the flipping in his stomach means. Or why he can’t stop thinking that this feels so much more like home than the life he’s been allowing himself to live.
As the first verse comes to an end Tony finally catches sight of Steve. A look of surprise crosses his face for a moment before Tony is pulling Steve fully into the kitchen and leading him into a dance.
?” Tony’s lip curls in disgust, he sounds like he can’t believe the results. “Platypus would never do something so vulgar, especially not in a place so sacred.”
“I need you to talk to me, stars and stripes, I ca- I can’t help unless I know what’s wrong. And… and, seeing you like this… it hurts. What’s wrong babe?”
Tony tries not to focus on how thick Steve’s accent is, how he really sounds like the guy from Brooklyn right now.
“Mary was clear in her will that if you stepped up you would receive primary guardianship of Peter. May and Ben are good people, but they’re Richard’s brother and sister in-law. She seemed to want you to have a chance. May and Ben said they would gladly help you however they can.”
Steve barely had time to nod before Tony is sliding a filled to the brim mug in front of him. He has to bite back a chuckle at the sight of the mug. A zombified caricature of Albert Einstein takes up one entire side with the other side reading Before Coffee I’m Albert frankEINSTEIN.
“You must be Tony?” Steve grins, holding a hand out for Tony and he feels his knees go weak because not only is this man gorgeous, but his voice is smooth. It dives into Tony’s senses in just the right way, sending a shiver down his spine as he reaches commandment four, while trying not to think of how his name sounds on Steve’s lips.
Steve smiles back, an honest smile. He thinks it might be the first time he’s smiled this brightly outside of the classroom.
“I’m going to hold you to that Sir Stark,” Steve replies teasing, he bites down on the words that are clawing at his throat.
“No interrupting daddy, Jay. I’m talking to Steve.” Tony sounds annoyed but Steve can hear the smile in his voice.
Steve nods, rolling onto his side, tucking his face into the fold of Tony’s knee. He breathes in deeply, getting a strange feeling of inebriation from the way Tony smells.
Steve stops talking, takes a shuddering breath and leans into Tony’s touch. The moment is tender, soft and special. Not like the intimacy Tony had avoided while in school. It reminds him of the moments he would allow himself with Rhodey and Pepper. Tony doesn’t speak, he just continues to softly run his fingers through Steve’s hair.
Seven minutes later Steve has Ned and Peter settled into their sleeping bags on the floor. It appears MJ is crashing on the bed. He ambles into the living room where Tony and MJ are sitting on the couch. There’s soft music playing overhead as Tony gently runs a brush through the young girl’s hair.
“I’m Tony, remember? They could strand me in the desert and I would fly out in a plane made of cacti and sand. I’ll be okay, Steve. And I’ll protect you, I promise.”
He answers the door to see a slightly shorter man wearing a black suit hopping from foot to foot on his porch. Vaguely Steve recognizes him from somewhere, though he cannot place that recognition.
Steve is sure that Tony’s story is interesting. He even finds he wants to hear about the antics the man gets into while trying to update the A.I., but he’s tired. He’s tired and the feeling of Tony’s fingers running through his hair, stopping only long enough to massage gently at his scalp relaxes him. Before he knows it, Steve’s breathing is slowing and he’s falling asleep in Tony’s lap.
When he wakes the next morning to a little body curling into his, the thumb of one hand in his mouth, the other hand firmly pressed against the glow of the arc reactor, Tony can’t help but smile.
The food is actually an hour late. Peter’s friends are so hungry Tony thinks they might start frothing at the mouth and begin eating the adults. Which is an issue because tonight Tony really wanted to ask Steve out.
Tony stills, quietly listening for any sound that might help him determine which room is Steve’s. He’s not completely sure why Steve called him, sounding broken and on the verge of tears, but he is almost positive it has to do with the panic attack Steve had at The Tower the other day. Maybe PTSD from his time serving? He’s not sure, he can never be sure, Steve hasn’t told Tony a lot of his past, almost everything Tony knows starts with his time as a teacher at the school.
“Hello.” Steve finally accepts the call, the word high and airy as he lets out a breath he doesn’t know he’s been holding.
“I, uh, y-yeah. Welcome. Um, ah, here? How does here at the Tower sound? If you get here at 11:30 we can do lunch together first?”
“Well, Rogers,” Tony laughs, and Steve tries again to ignore the warm feeling that spreads through him. “I think I can cook up something good for you and the kiddos. I do owe it to my betrothed, don’t I?”
Tony’s already spoken with Peter’s physical education coach, a funny smartass of a man named Clint, who makes Peter smile with his jokes. He sings Pete’s praises and sends them off to the next teacher.
“Stevie-kins,” Tony whines. Steve can almost picture him in the lab, hunched over a computer running through lines of code, until he hears the kids in the background. “Steve, I know I should have returned your calls, or at least texted you back, and I’m very sorry for how I avoided you. I promise I’ll take you to dinner so we can discuss how terrible I am. But right now, I need your help.”
“Petey and I finished Firefly for the second-time last weekend, sorry kid.” Tony vetoes Ned’s choice.
“Conferences,” Peter says on his way to the elevator, little backpack on his shoulders and lunch box in his hands. “Monday.”
It’s nearly midnight on Friday when Steve gets Tony’s call. He’s curled up in bed, wrapped in a comforter and a quilt, trying to keep the cold that seems to have stuck around since his last mission, almost two years ago, at bay. Ella Fitzgerald’s voice startles him, earning a deep graphite mark down the center of the sketch he’s working on. He’s trying to catch the light in Tony’s eyes as he looked at Peter during the Halloween party. The sketch now looks more like Tony is giving Peter fond laser eyes.
He looks peaceful. In a much different way than he does when interacting with Peter. Even then Tony carries the worried of his company and being a father, being better than his father, on his shoulders. None of that shows now. Steve watches as Tony’s eyes flutter and shift under closed lids, long lashes fanning over the man’s gorgeous carnelian skin. Rich in color like the stone, but so much more precious.
Tony really tries to keep it together the first time he sees Steve. When he receives that first note back, taped inside Peter’s lunchbox, kind words written in elegant script and a small doodle of Tony’s son on the side, there is no why he can account for this. He thinks Steve will look like any other grade school art teacher, especially the type that teaches at the specific sort of school Peter attends. He expects a hipster, maybe a scrawny man in flannels and jeans. He expects Steve to wear a beanie and have thick black rimmed glasses he definitely doesn’t need.  A lumberjack beard he started growing in high school and now refuses to shave.
“Bedtime, underoos.” Tony prods Peter toward the door, watching his little legs as he goes. “I’ll tuck you in. If you need anything you know how to get me right?” Peter nods, eyes staying closed longer and longer with each blink. “Sign to JARVIS, okay? He’ll either call me or light up the hallway to get to my room.” Peter nods again, this time he hasn’t even opened his eyes to pretend he is listening to Tony.  With a smile Tony finishes tucking him in and heads to his own room.
Tony putters around the kitchen. Soon the smell of coffee is wafting through the air and Steve is snagging bits and pieces of fruit from a bowl Tony places on the island.
Tony isn’t often a scared man. He doesn’t contemplate running and hiding. But right now, he considers it. Not for the first time he’s wondering why he sent that email, what persuaded him to reach out to Natasha, to ask to see Peter again, to sign the paperwork becoming his official guardian. To start being a parent.
Steve thinks for a moment that where he stands now is so close to where they shared their first kiss. A few feet to his left the glass wall shows the New York skyline, picturesque as lights from the skyscrapers twinkle like stars. It’s breathtaking. Steve’s fingers twitch with the desire to put the scene on paper. He wants to sketch the way the view makes him feel. He wants to draw Tony with the cityscape at his back.
Tony places a set of pajamas in MJ’s arms before pushing her toward Peter’s private bathroom. He grabs some pajamas for Peter and Ned before motioning to Steve to follow him.
He loves bugs. Right now the only thing little guy wants is to be a scientist, studying all the bugs that live in the Amazon rainforest (he thinks it’s the most beautiful place on earth). He loves spiders more than anything and thinks that bees are nice. His favorite bee is the carpenter bee, but he doesn’t have a favorite spider. His favorite colors are red and blue.
“Thanks Jay,” Tony mutters, moving his hand, Steve bites back his whine of discontent, he wants Tony’s warmth back. “Steve, baby, we need to go sit down, okay? I need you to walk with me, you can keep your eyes closed if you want but you need to walk to with me, babe. Can I touch you?”
Tony’s on his way out, spare blanket in hand to crash on the worn, comfortable looking couch in Steve’s living room when a soft voice pauses him in his tracks.
“How about you join us?” Tony cuts Steve off. “I have these hooligans all weekend. For a bit in August and September Peter and I did this thing, Sundae Sunday,” Tony huffs, a disbelieving kind of laugh. “It’s why we are having the two-day long sleepover. Anyway, tomorrow we are going to the Staten Island Children’s Museum. They have a bug exhibit that Peter really loves. His mom took him a few times. I mean, it wouldn’t be a date but it would be nice to see you. I know you’re his favorite teacher. I don’t think it makes up for the fact that I’ve been…”
Peter just stares at Tony for a moment, mouth gaping slightly open as he tries to figure out the man in front of him. Tony lets him, smiling softly between small bites of his food.
“Really Steve,” Tony sighs, in the background Steve hears the contented mutterings of children who have been given an offering. “Any advice on how to get these kiddos into bed? Usually Pete is asleep by 11 on a Friday. It’s 12:30.”
Tony lowers himself to his belly and slowly slides under the bed. He finds Steve with his back against the wall, curled into as small of a ball as he could. He looks so vulnerable, collapsing in on himself, eyes rapidly moving and taking in as much of the open area around him as possible.
“And you lost me already sugar britches. You lost me already. Should I give them raisins too? Or just the peanut butter and celery?”
“Do something physical.” Steve adjusts, rolling onto his side, snuggling back into his comforter. Trying to find the sense of warmth that so rarely blessed him after he discharged from the service. “Like a pillow fight. Maybe a scavenger… no, kids shouldn’t be running around your tower unsupervised.”
“Thank you.” Tony’s voice jerks Steve out of his reverie. “For coming. I know… I know you didn’t have to. But you answered the phone when I called last night. It was late!” Tony laughs, he sounds disbelieving. Like he doesn’t know that Steve would do anything to hear that laugh, to see that smile. “I call you at almost midnight after avoiding your texts and calls for two days and you answer! Then you tell me how to settle Peter and Co so I can finally sleep. You’re… well you’re something else Steve Rogers.”
Tony opens his eyes again to notice how Steve is looking at his lips and that’s enough to drive him forward. He doesn’t mean to be clumsy about it, in fact in his head it was sophisticated and graceful, but Tony basically falls forward and his lips connect with Steve’s as the other man lets out a soft grunt of surprise before their teeth clash together. It takes only one second on Steve’s part before he’s wrapping his arms around Tony and kissing the man back with an intensity rivaled by a man receiving water after a two-day long trek through the desert.  Like if they stay connected like this, Steve’s hands on Tony’s hips, Tony’s hands around Steve’s neck and their lips caught then they’ll stay rooted to the ground, they won’t float away from exhilaration. Steve pulls him close as Tony finally, finally, runs his hands down his chest. The synapses of Tony’s brain pulling as tight as the threads of Steve’s shirt. One of them is going to rip and Tony prays it’s the shirt because he is dying to see what’s underneath and if his brain breaks then how will he ever know?
“Ms. Potts and I have ensured you have a free schedule for Monday. Meetings will resume Wednesday of next week.”
“Uh, hi? Peter?” Tony hates the stilted way he speaks in the moment, how everything is a question but right now he is so confused.
“It’s something, isn’t it?” Tony’s voice startles Steve causing the man to turn quickly, hand moving to a gun he no longer carries.
They run off, Tony’s ears soaking up the sound of Peter’s laughter as MJ whispers something in his ear. Maybe this isn’t going to be horrible after all.
“What happens if I don’t? Take him in that is.” Tony’s voice is still a whisper. He’s not proud of how much weakness he has shown this morning. His voice and eyes betray every fear or surprise he has undergone in the last ten minutes.
“How can we aide in the investigation?” Tony usually throws money at things, but he doesn’t think throwing money at this will help.
Tony releases a breath he doesn’t realize he’s been holding. Steve’s voice is wet with unshed tears. The regret and distress of the memory rolls off him in waves.
They’re back on the elevator now, Steve’s fingers are still wrapped around his coffee, but he doesn’t feel as grounded in the warmth and smell.
"That would be the best for him, yeah? Wouldn’t--” Tony pauses, taking another shuddering breath as he tries to steel himself. “I—I can’t.”
Tony chuckles as Peter fist pumps, an exaggerated motion, and runs into the room. Gently, almost reverently, the boy touches every area he can before latching onto one of the spider legs on his bed and swinging on it.
So, when Tony stirs at a quarter after two in the morning, Snow Patrol’s Chasing Cars rousing him from whatever dream he had been drifting into, he’s surprised.
“We told you not to use your real-world friends Tony,” Steve chastises, trying to school the expression on his face. “We told you it would be your downfall.”
He shifts, scooting his chair so he is sitting next to Tony instead of across for him. The younger man only has one minute to mourn the loss of Steve’s touch before the man is leaning back into his space. Steve rests his head on Tony’s shoulder, sighing contentedly when Tony begins to card his fingers through Steve’s soft blonde hair.
“Who is Mr. Rogers?” He asks, wrapping the sandwich and placing it gently into Peter’s favorite lunchbox, the blue one with a large decal of Thor, hammer raised high with bolts of electricity flying around his head.
“Okay, we are tired and dirty huh? Let’s go grab some pajamas. Jay can you run a bath? Not to hot not too cold?”
Peter signs, leaning into his father. Eyes wide and curious as Tony pulls out a StarkTab he brought. The man never leaves technology behind him.
. It’s nine-thirty a.m. New York is a little chilly this morning at 52 degrees Fahrenheit.” It’s a normal day and wouldn’t be an issue if Tony had gone to bed at a reasonable time, not just two hours prior, after a 72 hour long workshop bender.
Before we meet again I would like to tell you a little bit about Peter. He’s currently five years old. His birthday is August 10th; he was born in 2001. Shortly after the… events in Afghanistan.
“Yeah,” Steve grunts. He takes a moment to steel himself, clearing his throat before continuing. “Yeah, I just—I uh, never told you that I served in the army, did I? Not really a topic I want to discuss with a fella I’m interested in.” Steve chuckles darkly. Aggressively he runs a palm down his face, sighing.
“Everything is going wrong Bruce,” Tony sighs, dragging his hand over his face. “The cake wasn’t even made. I had to call 50 bakeries in New York before we could find a place to make me a cake on short notice, I guess I didn’t order the food right because it’s going to be late, nothing is going right. I wanted to make this perfect for Peter. This is our first Halloween together.”
Peter signs, a confident, lazy smirk takes over his face. Steve thinks for a moment that Peter looks so much like Tony.
Steve has never called Tony, this late. He’s never the one to dial the phone and wait while the line rings and eventually Tony picks up with a breathless, groggy ‘hello?’. Tony always places the late-night calls, seemingly unaware of the time as he pulls Steve from his dreams.
Peter’s smile in response is so very worth it, Tony knows he would do whatever he can to make that smile come back.
Within six months after Tony returns home safe and in somewhat good condition it’s revealed that Stane is behind the orders for the terrorist group to takes Tony. He pays them handsomely in cash and weapons, to murder the man he treats as a son. He’s arrested after Tony and Pepper Potts (his right hand who practically runs the company) flush him out. It’s never been confirmed why Obadiah wants Tony dead, but the rumor is that he was the one behind a long string of Stark Industries weapons being involved with black market deals with terrorists, and Tony was close to finding out.
Steve is bigger than Tony. He’s taller by several inches and broader, Tony has to resist the urge to crawl into Steve’s lap and just wrap himself around the man. Instead, he scoots his chair over, knee to knee and wraps his arms around Steve.
Tony does all of his, begins reform on his company and catches the man who wants him dead with shrapnel in his chest. The only thing that keeps the shrapnel from tearing through his heart is the miniaturized arc reactor he builds. Coincidentally he also builds that, out of scraps, in a cave in the middle of nowhere.
“No!” Steve shouts, voice echoing in the small space. Tony doesn’t dwell on the way it cracks, breaking in a way that breaks his heart.
It’s what happens after that sticks with Steve, that makes him wonder how he can have this version of Tony in front of him.
“Uh, the quick version is I was in the military for six years. At 24 I got recruited for a special division of homeland security that I can’t tell you about. As an agent, there I did mission for four and a half years. Until I retired last year, after… after a really, really bad set of missions. We accomplished our objective but,” Steve sighs, heart heavy in his chest. Thankfully, he takes the cup of coffee Tony pushes into his hands. “We finished the objective, but I was emotionally compromised. So many things happened. I wasn’t sure if I believed in what I was doing…” Steve trails off, unsure of where he was going with that. The thought leaves as quickly as it occurs.
“His mother died.” A pointed pause ensues between Tony and the woman, both digesting the information. “Two weeks ago, actually.”
“Yes,” Steve rumbles. His voice scratchy and just barely above a whisper. “Please,” he adds. Not sure what he’s begging for.
“That would be great actually. The kids would definitely love the face painting. I can compensate you for your time?” Tony grabs a card out of his wallet, and a pen off Steve’s desk. “This is my cell, you can contact me on it? Send pictures of your receipts or just a list of things you might want.”
Steve wakes slowly, bathed in warmth and a smell he associates deeply with happiness. This is nice he thinks, before realizing the source of warmth is another body. Cautiously he opens his eyes. Tony.
“Okay, Sundae Sunday rules. You make the biggest, craziest sundae you can think of. I have so much ice cream I’ll cry if we don’t use most of it. After that, we stay in our pajamas and watch… something. What do you feel like watching?”
“I heard you gave the fine silk clothes I gave you to that boy. My betas told me. There is a brunette omega you speak to every morning. You gave him those clothes from the gathering.”
Gently, Steve took Tony’s wrists in his hand and moved them aside. His eyes were fixed on the marks on Tony’s body, the blue marks blurred and imprinted on his skin.
His eyes were glued to the omega’s. Bright brown eyes, full of youth and joy looked back at him. Full lashes framed them, making them the center of attention in every way. With them, his full lips curved up into a confident smile that seemed to present a beautiful image.
“Stop lying to me!” Steve screamed, suddenly unable to shake the image of Tony looking so defeated in the face of his friend. “You are no concubine! You are my
Curious, Steve raised a brow and looked at the man behind him. He had a much smaller figure and seemed to keep his head down and his hands tucked behind him. But from what Steve could see, the man had brown hair that appeared quite soft. Almost tempting enough for Steve to beacon him closer.
“Thank you.” Tony whispered shyly, looking strangely grateful and to Steve’s surprise, he realized he’d spoken out loud.
“There’s nothing wrong with this. It’s alright.” Tony said gently and for a moment, Steve thought he saw something brighten in his eyes.
“Our handler, sir.” The omega mumbled, wringing his hands together and turning his gaze to the floor. “He’s not happy with Tony at the moment.”
“Did you have a good evening?” Steve asked gently, feeling lighter than before as Tony beamed at him and nodded.
“Alpha, we have spent a few weeks together. Please do not worry for me.” Tony smirked and Steve flushed with rage.
Tony broke off suddenly and sucked in a deep breath, lightly brushing the back of his hand against his cheek. But Steve caught the slight sheen on his pale skin. Somehow it was all the more destroying to see.
It was like the world had shattered into pieces. The very ground could swallow him whole. He was going to
Instantly, Steve yanked his hands back as if burnt. Omega concubines were shameful and whatever they imparted on themselves was their choice. Steve had nothing to do with it.
The silence that filled the room was heavy and all encompassing. For a moment, Steve regretted what he said. Although he had not lied.
Steve lifted his chin up and smiled serenely. He knew what part to play, and after careful discussion with Sam, he had known what to say. “He pleases me.”
“My lord, I am here.” Tony said, settling beside him and leaning forward to drop his chin and look up at him in a sultry manner. “Would you prefer me to use my mouth instead? I can do that for you if you like?”
“I don’t know.” Tony shrugged but then leered up at him with a new found confidence, and somehow Steve knew Tony would not say more on that.
“My lord? Does that not please you?” Tony appeared startled and had it been any other matter, Steve might’ve laughed.
“Please do not worry, my lord.” Tony said gently and for just a moment there was something soft in his eyes, almost pitying as he brushed his hand over Rhodes’. “It was always meant to be this way. I am happy to serve. It is my place.”
“Your handler is not the most intelligent. And I do not have time to waste on him.” Steve shrugged, reaching out to pour the tea he had set out on a small tray on the table. Carefully, he poured it into the two China cups. “Please, have a seat.”
“And not for yourself?” Steve asked gently, giving Tony a knowing look when the omegas expression saddened. It was like he knew there was no way out for him.
“Well, that is good to hear.” Steve nodded and stood up from his chair, pushing it out with a loud screech against the floor. “Come. We must head back. The official papers are yet to be signed.”
"Do not leave until I return. I will go to the physician now and return with them shortly. Do you suffer any ailments?"
The moments drawn out felt like they had lasted for years. But finally when Tony spoke, it was as if the weight of the world lifted from his shoulders.
Steve closed his eyes in shame. Beside him there was a soft rustling and then the faint warmth of a body nearby.
“I wonder what you used to do. Before all this. What your life was like. I’m sorry I shut you out.” Steve whispered, releasing a heavy sigh as he felt something sit low in his chest. Tony had tried before and had been shot down for his efforts. Now Steve feared Tony would never trust him again-
He never got an answer to any of those questions. But there was one question that he did receive an answer to. And it continued to haunt him.
He was glad they had spent so much time together. And that Tony was smiling with such joy in his eyes.
Tony did as he asked, though clearly hesitant. He settled into the seat and looked around the room, seeming to choose his words carefully.
“I can.” Steve rumbled and pulled Tony close, sinking one hand into Tony’s hair. Carefully, he guided Tony to his neck and waited. He felt Tony gasp under his touch and shift to bury his nose further into Steve’s neck. He knew he could sense it-the fierce warmth and love and protection-
After Steve returned with the suppressants, Tony took his first dose and they spent the evening simply completing tasks, Steve being sure to watch Tony for any reactions or concerns. Every so often, Tony would glance back at Steve and smile. And every time, Steve’s heart would begin to race.
“He looks thin. Does he eat well? Is he comfortable in his home?” Sam glared at him before jerking his head in Tony’s direction. Tony was busy assembling plates in the corner.
Once Tony began to shift a little, Steve slowly began to push further, taking painstaking care to enter carefully and press deeper and deeper still, until finally he had fully entered and the base of his cock was pressed flush against the soft kiss of Tony’s hole.
“You play beautifully.” Steve finally admitted, meeting Tony’s gaze. “Where did you learn that song?”
Thus began Steve’s newest change to his lifestyle. While he had never considered the possibility of making use of omega concubines, Tony had quickly become a part of his day to day routine. Every evening, Tony would be escorted to his house and every morning, he would be retrieved and after some negotiation, Steve even began to push to late afternoon. Money and respect in the community had a high place in the town, and with the manor, Steve had quickly become the richest man of them all.
To his delight, Tony had agreed to join him and after providing the finer clothes, he was able to introduce Tony to the other townsfolk.
He regretted it now. Much like he regretted everything with Tony. He suspected he would always regret what he’d done to this omega who had once tried to open up to him, even just a little bit. Who he had essentially spurned and used.
Tucking his arm under Tony’s waist, Steve flipped them over to allow Tony to lie on his chest as they waited out the knot. It was unusual to do but Steve did not care. He simply wanted to rest.
The omega didn’t even bother to hide his smile at that. He simply looked up and made direct eye contact with Steve and instantly, Steve felt his breath catch.
, or create something extraordinary to make your father proud! And now you...” Rhodes voice trailed off as he sniffed and closed a hand over his mouth. Perhaps the denial was too strong. Perhaps the shock was incomprehensible.
“Get up.” Steve said coldly, watching as Tony snapped his head up and looked at him with wide eyes. “You’re embarrassing yourself.”
Before Steve could say anything, the tune began to die down. Eventually, the rhythm came to a stop and relieved, Steve stepped forward, only to frown when Tony’s hands slid off the keys.
Instead of looking appalled, the alpha merely threw his head back and laughed, the sound booming as it filled the room.
Steve had to look up to the ceiling to hide away his tears. Blinking rapidly, he nodded and did not look at Tony, even as he heard him approach.
That night, when Steve lay down and waited for Tony to come closer, he sat up higher and circled his arms around Tony.
“Why? Did you not like the song?” Tony winked even as he sounded choked, and for a moment Steve could almost forget he was his concubine. Tony’s snark was a key part of him, and one Steve could no longer picture him without.
Even as the words were spoken, Steve knew there was something else boiling under the surface. Something that Tony wasn’t saying.
Stood before him, the confident alpha was an older gentleman with a build that suggested he was used to good solid meals and an easy life. Not too well-built but clearly not thin either. A man of riches, perhaps even a nobleman.
“Breathe in.” Steve murmured, concentrating on tightening the strings and putting them into neat bows as Tony sucked in a breath. It was mesmerizing to imagine. Tony was wearing fine omega clothes. A traditional maroon corset that would suit him so well. Steve would have the privilege of seeing him like this.
“What’s the matter?” Steve asked and glanced down at his cock before looking back up. “Have you not taken this size before?”
Stunned, the fog vanished and Tony looked up at him like he’d been told to leave this place and run the land. His eyes were so wide, Steve was sure he would struggle to close them again.
“I...” Something had plagued Steve’s mind in the morning. While Tony had been good as gold, even tidying up his room before he’d woken, something still did not sit right with Steve.
-seemed to be wearing very little. Only a knee length partially sheer skirt that was maroon in color and held by a thin gold band and some plain gold pieces of jewelry. A long sweeping necklace and a gold band that sat on his upper arm and little else. Just the sandals and that was it.
Pleased, Steve reached up and stroked a gentle hand over Tony’s hair, and while Tony paused a little at that, he took the opportunity to slip his thumbs into the waistband of the beautiful skirt. Lifting his eyes up, he met Tony’s heated gaze and began to slip it down.
“What’s that?” Tony huffed and Steve could barely contain the excitement. There was something wonderful about the thought of surprising Tony.
“Sir, we have news of the person you are waiting for. They’ve arrived, would you like us to escort him up?”
“Excuse me!” Steve cried out as he came closer, getting the attention of the startled group. “Have you seen an omega by the name of Tony? He’s about this tall with dark brown hair and brown eyes?” Steve held his hand out to demonstrate.
“It does not matter. You should not be here.” Steve said, and ignoring Tony’s protest, he hauled the omega out of his seat and began to drag him to the guest room. Or rather, he helped Tony because the omega didn’t seem to be able to walk straight and once again, the strange feeling of wrong took over.
“I will be over there. Take as much time as you need. I will keep an eye.” Steve promised, glancing meaningfully at Tony. It was clear Rhodes understood.
“Omega.” Steve rumbled and sat on the bed, leaning against the headboard  and spreading his thighs slightly. “Come here.”
“We will keep this space between us. I want you to tell me about yourself. Where you’re from, what your home is like. Who your friends are and what your ambitions are.” Steve swallowed and began to blink rapidly. It hurt to speak and face Tony and yet he couldn’t look away. How could he dare to face him, after all the grief he’d put him through? “I want to know about you. What makes you happy, what makes you sad and what you want for yourself. I want to know you in a way that you know me. You have seen me in my home and seen my life. Show me yours. I want you to speak to me.”
Steve had not expected to return home one day to such a sound. The gentle press of piano keys that sang a beautiful melody, filled the manor. Each note carefully following after another into a song that both soothed Steve’s mind and soul and called for more.
“No, uh, this is good.” Tony mumbled, suddenly looking embarrassed as he reached out and took the other cup. “Thank you.”
Having suitably distracted Tony, Steve reached down and gently brushed his thumb over Tony’s quivering hole, using soft motions to coax more moans out of the omega. To his delight, Tony seemed to melt under his touch.
“It’s simple. I want you to play the role of an omega meeting his friend.” Steve cleared his throat and steered Tony towards the corner of the busy tavern, pointing at the man coming towards them. “An omega noble who is speaking to his friend for the first time in months.”
“Nothing. I just happened to be visiting.” Steve explained and scanned the room carefully. Then he focused on Tony who looked as if he’d seen a ghost.
“He was an engineer. I learned a lot from him.” Tony explained and then paused, looking momentarily lost. “Sometimes I wonder if he would’ve...”
“I am.” Steve folded his arms and smiled a little when Tony’s mouth fell open. “All I want is for you to agree.”
“Put your clothes back on.” Steve said softly and looked up slowly as Tony paused and blinked at him.
Steve bristled at the words. He couldn’t help the wave of anger that washed over him but more than that, the sheer amount of hurt he felt. Did Tony truly hate him that much?
“And what do you get out of this?” Steve asked, just as quiet, and for a moment, he could almost pretend they didn’t have an audience. Tony, for his part, seemed unaffected.
“I suppose.” Tony sniffed, though his lips started to twitch as a smile began to form. “You must have liked the song then?”
“It’s as I said before. You should be safe Tony. No one should hurt you and you deserve what is yours-“
“Steve, you’ve been the kindest alpha I’ve ever been with.” He lifted his hand up when Steve made to speak. “Even from the start.”
Tony licked his lips and swallowed, placing his palms flat on Steve’s chest, the gentle press and soft heat enough to make Steve’s whole body spike. He could feel his hormones flare and knew instantly where Tony was taking this.
“I’m sorry your first time wasn’t the most loving. But I can promise you will always feel loved from this point on. I will always take care of you. Let our next time together be our new first time together. I’ve decided I will not touch you until we are bonded. When you are ready.”
Whenever they entered the bedroom, Tony would always place a small robe on the side. He would always comb his fingers through his hair. And after the incident with the bruises, he would always spend more time in the bathing room, carefully applying more makeup, Steve realized.
Omegas did not play. They simply were not taught such a thing. Unless they were high born in society, children of nobility or a performer in the arts, they did not learn, especially the common folk and the concubine group. To see an omega play was to ask for a light from a blind man. And yet Tony...
“Yes.” Steve whispered, meeting Tony’s gaze, even when he heard him gasp. “You are mine. If you let me, I will claim you.”
“I’m a rather irregular alpha.” Steve said and tried not to grin too hard when Tony started to smile. “I know a lot of things. And Natasha often needs help with these things.”
In the early hours of the morning, Obadiah returned to the manor with two medium sized betas in tow. It was clear they had come for their property.
“Oh, god, alpha!” Tony cried and squeezed his eyes shut and began to clench tightly around him. It took every ounce of strength to hold back.
“Well I thought I was too.” Steve said lightly, watching smugly as Tony’s smile dropped. “But I guess I was wrong in thinking a smart omega like you would know I care about you.”
“If it’s alright, I’d love to take a look around the brothel. Is that alright? Perhaps it’s time I choose an omega for myself.”
“I am an open book, my lord.” Tony smiled, though it looked false even to Steve. “You know all there is to know.”
“Right.” Tony replied eagerly and to Steve’s surprise, began to hum to himself as he folded the clothes. Determined by his new goal, Steve stood up and reached for his coat.
It was strange but Steve had never pictured himself being so comfortable with making a concubine his own. He could not be more glad he had met Tony.
Steve stepped out from around the table and walked towards the stunned omega. How could he even begin to explain? How did he say to Tony that he was tired of seeing Tony suffer?
“My, well-“ Obadiah cleared his throat. “I can’t say I was expecting that. What exactly has made you come to this decision, Lord Rogers?”
“What did I say about promises?” Tony’s muffled voice said against his chest and Steve simply laughed and released him.
“Tony, shhh. It’s okay.” Steve murmured softly, rubbing gentle circles into Tony’s back. He hoped to god he was helping. “You’re alright.”
Steve thought, watching as Tony’s glossy eyes blinked tiredly and his lips smiled at him with a dying light.
Tony didn’t say a word. He continued to stare at a spot behind Steve’s shoulder but his hands shook.
He wasn’t supposed to, however. He was an omega concubine. And he had left his quarters without being called.
To his shock, Tony launched himself forward and threw his arms around Steve, hugging him as tightly as he could with as much strength as he could carry. His body clutched onto Steve like a lifeline, and while he tried to nuzzle closer, Steve could already feel the rapid beat of his heart.
Not wanting to give away his own composure, Steve simply grunted his acceptance and pulled Tony close again, settling the omega on his lap and looking up at him. It was then that Tony seemed to curl his arms around him again and guide him closer.
“Don’t hold your breath.” Tony murmured, but let out a frustrated noise when Steve pulled the clothes out of his reach.
Steve didn’t say more but he did use the moment to remove the skirt completely. Once they had managed to remove it, Tony looked up at him and smiled a little nervously.
Tony’s whole body froze. He looked like he even stopped breathing for a moment. So Steve breathed for him.
Later, after several hours had passed, Steve finally noticed Rhodes and Tony stand. He was not surprised, it had been hours but still.
“His name is Tony, my lord. A fine omega with beautiful behavior, I can’t even begin to express how well behaved he is! A fine addition to your household, I assure you!”
“That’s right, I’m simply tired my lord, please, you don’t need to worry.” Tony promised and cleared his throat, looking away again. “I just wished to play one last time.”
Something was wrong, he was certain of it now. He saw it. He saw it every night when he held Tony close and noticed a dampness on the pillow every morning. He saw it in the way Tony would look at the omega nobles who met Steve for dinner and turn back to the plate in his hands that he carried to the table as if it surprised him.
Caught in the act, Tony looked away like he was being scolded. “He needed it more than I did. There’s a chance some alpha might take him in. I want that for him.”
Tony closed his mouth at that. He seemed to have forgotten that he was meant to be hiding away from Steve, something Steve took full advantage of.
“And what of your plan? You said you would never end up in this place. That you would-would take to the
Tony’s eyes were glistening in the light. But in the dimly lit stairwell, Tony looked truly radiant and so perfectly fit to be the omega noble he was born to be and Steve couldn’t help but notice how relaxed he was. Like he was comfortable in his skin.
Part of her was sure Richard had cheated on Mary. When she mentioned that idea to Ben in passing, he had turned on her. So she kept her thoughts to herself. That was until she found out that if anything happened to Mary and Richard, Peter wouldn't be coming to them. Oh no he would end up with the second person May hated.
"I have pictures," Toni told him," And our son would find me if I didn't show up to see him. He isn't a normal little boy Steve. He was able to tell us who his father was before he was born. His perfect and he'll probably have you wrapped around his finger in minutes just like the rest of us."
"I've been in love with you since our first joint babysitting," Toni confessed, " I always thought that if I met Steve Rodgers, I'd hate him. But honestly it was like meeting an older version of our son. Your the best thing that's happened to me since Peter and I don't ever want to lose you."
May Parker hated two people. The first was her sister in law Mary. When they had first met, May was sure they'd get along as they had many things in common.
"Meet your son Steve," She smiled at the little boy and then handed him over," Peter, Meet Captain America or to you and me, Steve Rogers your father."
"Toni," He told Her, "Your protecting our son. Whatever you have to do i understand. Do i want people to think bad of you? No. But if it means that Peter never gets hurt because of us then I'll join you in every nightclub."
"Well from now on I'm going to call you wonderful," Mary told her happily," Your the second best thing to ever happen to me."
"I'll keep watch over them too," Charles told her," I'll keep your family safe. Do you want me to do a search for Captain America while I'm at it. I know we said before that he had to be dead but if his Sperm can live for 40years without issue, we might have too rethink everything."
"It's also good for the baby's future," Jarvis injected into the conversation," If the two of you have smiliar traits and the child takes after Toni then they won't notice anything different about themselves unless you tell them."
"Only if it's just us that does it," Toni agreed," I can get us into any system to run the results against."
Mary Parker knew, when she saw the young woman in Doctor Fell' s office, that her life was going to change. She never expected it to mean that she was about to become a mother. That had always been a pipe dream. Something to wish for but not something they could afford.
"God your so cute with your little sayings," Toni told him as she gave both Steve and Peter kisses, "Somebody must love me if I get to have you two cuties in my life."
"I'm never going anywhere, your not," Steve told her, " As of now, I'm your personal bodyguard. Treat me like a trophy, but as of now we're a team. No one will ever get the chance to hurt you again." And then he kissed her.
Of course Toni had told him about May Parker hating her, but he always felt that came from jealousy on May's part, because she was so young and effortlessly beautiful. The money was probably also a factor but as Toni wasn't a really over the top spender when it was just him and Peter, it never became a problem for him.
It was shortly after that that the first meeting broke up. Toni was beginning to get tired. They arranged a move in date for her and then finally Toni was heading back to her apartment. Jarvis was there, opening doors and helping her into the town car he was driving.
Toni laughed as she opened the door, an excited squeal greeted them and then Toni was turning back to Steve with a little boy and a huge grin.
The Stark line would continue some day but at sixteen  Toni wasn't ready to try and make an name for herself and also be a single mother. Especially to a child of what could only have been rape. She might not remember what happened when she was kidnapped but she knew that before she had been a virgin.
Often when May would offer to babysit, Richard would laugh and say that they had a permanent babysitter in a neighbour called Edwin. May felt she was missing something huge. And had taken to stopping by unexpectedly in the hope of catching them out.
"Toni," He started, "No matter what anyone says about you, I swear I'd never believe it. Your amazing to me, your so smart and you'd do anything for anyone who means anything to you. I see you with Peter and I thank God everyday, that your his birth mother. You only thought of him, when you first found out. You let him keep you in his life and your bond with him, is only second only to Mary and Richard. I'm in awe of how easy you make looking after a child. Even when your parents died, you put everyone else first. You spent hours creating new products, so that no one would lose jobs. And you still had time to sing Peter to sleep and go out with me. And no one could ever stop me loving you. I'm so in love with you Toni, your the best part of my day. When I don't see you, I feel lost."
"I love that baby already Toni," Mary answered from the door way," Nothing would stop me wanting him. I think you are super so why wouldn't Peter be."
The doctor left at once to let Mary know what was happening and Toni was suddenly alone. And as always, when she was scared or confused, she phoned Edwin Jarvis. The man she always wished was her father. The man she loved more than anyone.
"I'm just glad you were there to pick me up," Toni promised him," If you hadn't been there then I can safely say I'd be dead."
The last thing he saw as he was leaving was Toni Stark' s tearfilled eyes and Steve Rogers's hate filled eyes.
"Ya but think what that means for you Obie," Another man said," Full control and she has no time to watch what your up to."
"Their outside waiting to meet you," Charles spoke up," I took the liberty of contacting them when I saw you looking at the pictures."
Of course the more he spent time with Toni, the more annoyed he got. People were forever judging her for the clothes she wore and how reckless she drove her car. Nothing was ever good enough for the press. Often he had held her as she cried about some horrible story a ex friend had sold, all lies, to the papers.
Knowing that all she could do now was wait, Toni sat staring blankly at the wall. Jarvis would help her threw this. He would help her threw anything. A baby was too important for her to mess up with. She had seen what growing up with parents who just needed an heir was like. She wanted better for the baby inside her.
Working together they set up a routine of visiting the Parkers and creating Toni's cover story. Been honest Steve found it fun to act like a dumbass and be young and carefree, as he never got to do it before. His health had always been in the way.
The only real happiness they had was when they were at the Parkers. They had become their real family along with Edwin Jarvis. Richard was like a father to not only Toni and Peter but also to Steve. He found himself having many chats with Richard about the differences he found between the 40's and now.
The Big thing they had in common was the inability to have children of their own. So colour her surprised when Ben, rang her at work, and informed her about their new son. She of course was excited for them. But when she asked questions about the little boy, Mary ignored her.
"Ya about twenty-five," Charles confirmed, "We have a lot to fill you in on. But we feel we should start with the most important thing."
"Hey Ben," Toni greeted him, " How have you been? This is Steve. Peter met him last week and it was love at first sight. I think his only with me so he can see Peter."
She might not be called mom by him but she'd do worst than a lioness to protect him and his parents.
Waking up over 70 years into the future was like something out of a book. But it wasn't until Toni placed Peter in his arms that he realised what love at first sight ment. Peter was perfect. A beautiful combination of Toni and himself. Hearing what Toni had done to protect an innocent child while she herself was a victim, had helped him fall for her.
"We have a son called Peter," Toni confirmed, " But I'm not raising him. Before you ask why it's for two reasons. One is because I'm still very young and I didn't want Howard and my mother to hurt him the way the hurt me. And the second reasons is if they could take me, then it would of been hella easy to take a baby."
But she never found anything. She had even tried one night when Edwin was babysitting. The only thing she saw was Toni asleep on the sofa with Peter and Edwin baking in the kitchen.
The silence that greeted that statement wasn't unexpected. Toni looked quickly to Jarvis, to see how he was handling the news. He was moving towards her and Toni couldn't help but flinch. She knew in her heart that Jarvis would never strike her but she was brought up by an alcoholic, who thought a woman's place was in the kitchen and the bedroom. Having a daughter who had surpassed him in the brains department at eleven, hadn't help.
"You really are a good man aren't you," Toni told him and then she hugged him, "Thank you for understanding."
"I'm Toni Stark," The woman started," I believe you knew my father. This is my friend Charles Xavier. It's thanks to him we were able to find you."
Howard and Maria Stark should never of had a child. They thought that a child would be perfect for pictures. They forgot that children grow up. That they have brains and want to do what their parents do. And Toni Stark was everything a parent should of been proud of. She had made her first circuit board at seven. Was in high school at ten. In college at thirteen.
"If it's possible," Richard Parker spoke for the first time," I know we'll do out best to try and make it happen."
"I'm a student of his," Tony told the doctor," His a great teacher and really loves his wife. His always talking about her."
Mary was the person to bring him up to speed on everything else. She gave him homework to do between visits and with Toni's help he moved threw it all quickly.
"That's perfect," Mary agreed," It's also my father's name. So no one will question it. I'd like to suggest something?"
"Don't start Charles," Toni pleaded," I was taken two months ago and now I'm pregnant and hormonal. I have no idea who the father is and now I'm worried something is wrong with me and or the baby."
"Mrs Parker," Edwin Jarvis answered," In complete honesty, The Starks shouldn't of had Toni. If it wasn't for myself and her aunt Peggy, She wouldn't even be alive. Toni was kidnapped ten times before she was nine. Everytime, Howard told the police that he wouldn't pay a ransom. That if Toni was really smart, she'd find her own way out."
Only to be interrupted by giggling. The two separated and turned to face their audience. A happy Peter Parker was looking at them. All Toni could do was laugh. And for the next couple of hours, they had a great time laughing and joking around. And then there was a knock on the door and their world fell apart.
Ben had been holding Peter, when the door opened and two people fell into the room laughing. Peter had gone from being a placid baby to a jumping monkey eager to get to Toni or so he thought. But it wasn't Toni who reached for Peter it was the man with her. And his little nephew was only too willing to leave his arms.
"Oh hello dear," The woman greeted her warmly," I didn't know anyone was in here. Doctor Fell asked me to meet him in here with my husband. I guess he forgot you were here. His such a scatter brain is Doc Fell but don't let on I said that. I like this job."
"Why on earth would they leave their child to a teenager," Ben growled," I'm Richard's brother and I object to Peter leaving the Parker family. I'll be suing for guardianship of Peter Parker first thing tomorrow."
Charles arrived first accompannied by his student Hank McCoy. He hid his surprise at the Bump well and greeted her with a hug.
"I've always like the name Peter for a boy," Toni informed them," And I'm pretty sure the baby is a boy. I think it's a suitable name for a Parker."
Charles Xavier kept his promise and kept careful watch over the Parker family He also did a search for Captain America and wasn't surprised to find muted brain waves from him. He forgot about him as once again Eric came into his life only to be reminded after the funerals of Howard and Maria Stark.
"Peter is with Toni as of Richard and Mary instructions, She'll be filling out the papers tomorrow to claim him as her own," Jarvis informed them," The signing is the last stage of transferring care of Pete to Toni. Everything else was done months ago."
"Howard didn't have a wife when I knew him," Steve told Her, "I'm guessing I'm missing a lot of years."
" What a waste of a brain," He heard a voice say to his left," She could be making millions for the company instead she's playing house with that artist and the orphan. Her father must be turning in his grave."
Then he met Peggy Carter and he fell in love. She was everything he'd ever wanted in a partner. Even better she knew the dangers of the life he had chosen. He finally felt like a normal man. And then he had to crash into the ice and he felt that was it for him.
Jarvis saw the flinch but acted like he didn't. He would have given anything for a child of his own but as Toni was the child of his heart, He had held his tongue, so that his Angel, would always have him near. He knew why she was giving away her child and by god did he support her decision.
"Ben," Richard thundered as he entered the room," You need to leave and consider yourself banned from here until you've  realised how horrible your being to a teenage girl. Now!"
The blush that covered Toni' s cheeks was the first time Ben had ever seen her look her age. But before he could stop himself he heard himself say, " Ya but how many others is she sleeping with as well as you."
"Stop fishing doll," The man,Steve told her," You know your the best thing that's ever happened to me. But this little man is the bees knees."
"I get the real feel that his just spending as much time with you as he can," Charles informs Her," He thinks your amazing. And loves when you sing to him. His afraid he'll never hear you sing again."
Steve Rodgers always felt like he knew what love felt like. He loved his ma,Sarah, with all his heart. He would of done anything for her. His best friend, Bucky also had a part of his heart. They'd always have each other backs till the end of the line.
Three weeks later Toni Stark was front page news for being 'Drunk' at a party. No one wondered about a baby as she wasn't even out of the news three months.
"Well thank you for the compliment but personally I think your way better looking," The woman told her as she held out her hand," I'm Mary Parker."
"I didn't need to know that," Mary told them," I have a feeling this baby will be smarter than me by it's third birthday."
"Guess you and Richard better adopt me so," Steve informed Mary, " As I don't plan on stopping anytime soon."
"Good luck with that ," Jarvis informed them," You think your brother didn't plan for that. As I said this is just the last stage in the long process your brother put in place should anything happen to them."
"About a year ago I was taken from my dorm room," Toni started, " I escaped as I am well versed in breaking out of hostage situations. Three weeks later I had to go to the doctors as I wasn't feeling great. The doctor told me I was pregnant. Before I was taken I had never had sex. I was a virgin. But what was really worrying was the fact that I was three months pregnant."
"Mary I'm so sorry for adding this on to you and Richard," Toni informed Her," But your going to have to be so careful in who you tell about me and Peter. I can't have Howard find out that Captain America has a child out there. He'd kill everyone who stood between him and the child. Especially one with Stark DNA."
“I care about you.” Steve shrugged, folding his arms and tipping his chin up. “I would be lucky to have you.”
“Why, the one in the corner of the town. You must come visit sometime. Every alpha always does.” The alpha smirked, and gestured towards the man behind him. “We have many such as him.”
Growing concerned, Steve murmured his goodbye to the elderly generals and began to walk up to the pair. As he closed in, he saw Rhodes become more concerned.
“You’ve lost weight.” Steve whispered softly into his ear, rubbing his thumbs gently over the pattern as he watched Tony look up at him through the mirror. Steve towered over him in size and a part of him had the sudden urge to wrap his arms around Tony and pull him against him if only to reassure himself that Tony was safe. His future omega.
Had Tony had dreams once? What was it he had said before? That he loved to watch the stars at night? That he had always wondered what it was like to craft a sword?
“What are you doing here?” Tony asked, nearly tripping as he moved out of the way while the servant closed the door. “I thought I was meant to meet Stone.”
It hurt to hear but perhaps he was going about it the wrong way. Perhaps he needed to prove himself to Tony first and give him more reasons to trust him. Claiming could come later.
“I know.” He replied, wrapping his arms around Tony again and hugging him close. He squeezed around Tony tighter and buried his face between Tony’s shoulder blades, basking in their shared warmth.
“Okay, what is the matter?” Tony sighed, putting the tea down completely. Steve couldn’t stop beaming.
“Tony.” Steve smiled warmly, nodding to the servant who had brought him up. “Thank you, you may leave now.”
-that letting concubines play such games was dangerous. But he would not bring himself to stop Tony from doing so. Even if he knew Tony did not want such comfort. Only his knot.
“Why shouldn’t I?” Steve insisted, bringing their joint hands to his chest. “You’re so kind and yet so sharp. And your wit, my god! When I listen to you, I feel such joy. You are...you are so unique. A beautiful omega, inside and out.”
“Obie won’t allow it.” Tony cut in sharply, something dark simmering in his eyes. A hate Steve had never seen before. “I have had plenty of alphas come to me and offer a claim. The answer has always been no. And there’s a reason for that.”
Tony’s eyes widened with each word but he didn’t react verbally. He simply shook his head over and over.
“You can’t be serious!” Tony’s eyes were frantic and his whole body looked panicked. Steve didn’t care-it was the most lively Tony had been since they’d first met.
“I wish you didn’t have to leave.” Tony whispered under his breath and to Steve’s dismay, began to grow quiet again.
The shadows had caught his eye when Tony had first walked through the door. And not just the shadows but the slight wince in Tony’s gait, and the odd look on his face when he had moved his neck a certain way.
"You know, I have always wanted to watch the night sky. Perhaps pick out the points that make the stars come to life? They're so fascinating to me." He murmured, tracing his fingers gently over Steve's heart. "I have always wanted to craft a sword as well. It is something I have always wanted to try."
“Steve.” Sam said lowly and met his eye. “These omegas are never trained. Often they do what needs to be done. I’ve even heard that some handlers do not give the omegas suppressants.”
“Omega. Tony.” Steve shook him gently to rouse him and see and luckily Tony groaned softly and opened his eyes, revealing dim, tired eyes. They were red-rimmed and somehow so old and so young at the same time.
“I am sorry. For what I said last night, it was-“ Steve cleared his throat and looked away. “It was unrequired.”
“Of course. I remember it well.” Tony looked down and fiddled with his cuffs. Steve nodded and swallowed.
“I want you...to lie with me.” Steve said quietly and at Tony’s questioning gaze, Steve climbed up the bed and lay down, patting the space beside him. He could see the hesitation in Tony’s eyes but knew Tony would obey.
“Let me have you, Tony.” Steve murmured, pausing to press his lips to Tony’s forehead. He wanted nothing more than to bring a smile to Tony’s face. He was sure of it. “I will make sure you have the best life. You will answer to no one and be free to make your own decisions, even without me. I will never force myself on you, not in any part of your life. But I would love the chance to walk beside you.”
“Not many alphas no.” Obadiah smiled, only the skin around his lips was tight. “Why? Do you want me to get him more experience? Did he not meet your requirements? Did he misbehave?”
As planned, one of his betas was bringing Tony to this tavern. The same tavern as the other night, only Steve had hired a private bedroom for them and had taken time to dress the room appropriately and prepare for the much quieter evening. It would be perfect.
With a sigh, Steve hooked his hands under his plain white shirt and lifted it up. Once he was shirtless, he reached for his black breaches but paused when he heard a knock on the door.
“Of course I am, my lord. I am happy.” Tony replied in the same tone and feeling something begin to sink low in his stomach, Steve realised that Tony was still not smiling. And he had not even seemed to absorb Steve’s words.
But it didn’t matter. Steve had never been one for demanding so much of his partners in bed. Of the few partners he’d had, they’d always shared pleasure in the bedroom. He knew how to bring that about for both of them.
How could he have been so naive, so foolish as to think Tony had chosen this? What omega, what person would choose a life like this?
“I never would have imagined you to come to a place like this.” Tony said, licking his lips and rubbing his palms against his thighs. “It seems...rustic.”
The omegas all paused what they were doing to stare at him. Then they all glanced at each other before one stepped forward.
Obadiah seemed to laugh at that and clap Tony on the back heartily. “He really is, there’s no doubt. Perhaps you would even say he is the prettiest of my lot. Hard to say really, I have so many.”
After what felt like hours, the sobs finally calmed down and Tony eventually pulled back and Steve saw something that he never thought he’d see.
“When we’re bonded, I will ensure you have the best meals. I never want to see you looking so thin again.” Steve said, frowning when he saw the clear skepticism in the Omega’s expression. “I will have extra food made for you and your housemates. You should all eat well regardless of what Obadiah says.”
With a scowl, Steve mumbled his thanks and headed in the direction of the laundry room. Several omegas wandered around completing household errands but Tony was nowhere in sight.
“Alpha.” Tony spoke softly, nodding his chin down and looking up at him with a calm gaze. “It is an honor to see you.”
“I am whatever you want me to be, alpha.” Tony whispered with an empty gaze. “I am always happy with you. Always.”
“Rhodey?” Tony whispered, looking ice-white as he caught sight of the alpha approaching them. The dark skinned man, Steve had recently discovered to be colonel James Rhodes. A friend of Tony’s.
“I can at least save you.” He breathed and nuzzled gently, hoping desperately for Tony to understand, to say yes, to finally be happy-
) and then suddenly he broke off and coughed into his hand and the noise jarred Steve. It sounded wet and crackled and that was when the fear finally took hold.
“Oh, but I do.” Steve said with a dark tone and folded his arms as he met Tony’s gaze. “I refuse to allow this to continue. You may be a concubine but you will not become a parent. Not until you are ready.”
“You will look after me, won’t you alpha? You won’t leave me to suffer, will you?” Tony whispered softly and to Steve’s surprise, leaned even closer until he was resting his head on his collar bone as well. His soft brown hair brushed his chin gently and before Steve could even stop himself, he was reaching out and cupping the omegas waist.
Steve pushed Tony back and onto his knees. Face flushed, Tony looked up at him with deep brown eyes, his mouth half open in surprise.
Tony was quiet again, and this time, when Steve looked at him, he saw Tony’s gaze looking distant and lost. His skin was certainly pale with just a faint flush on his cheeks and for a moment, Steve worried that he might’ve fallen ill.
“This is unacceptable. I will not have it.” Steve shook his head and met Tony’s empty gaze. Tony was just staring at him, the clothes long forgotten. “I will get you suppressants and you will take medication, even as a preventative measure.”
“I’m just the lucky omega you slept with that night. It has nothing to do with me. You barely even know me.” Tony insisted, though he did reach out and close his hand around the arms around his waist.
With a sigh, Steve sucked in a deep breath and released it, letting all the anger and fear and pain leave his body with it. Only the guilt remained.
Then, almost as if by some spell, Tony was instantly beside him, mere inches away and leaning down to brush his ear.
“He’s not as young as some of the other omegas. It would be better to have him pregnant now without the hassle of him stealing an alpha away from the young ones. You see what I mean?”
Pulled in by the music, Steve drifted closer to his main room where the piano was tucked into the corner. He had not seen it used since he had first moved into the house and so he would never have expected such a song to be played. Yet here he was, listening to something so calm and soothing-
“You’re a noble. A noble-born.” Steve smiled, placing his own tea down to lean back and fold his arms smugly. It was obvious.
“Alpha...that was incredible.” Tony moaned with delight and pressed a gentle kiss to Steve’s collarbone. “Very nice indeed.”
“Steve.” Tony sighed, pulling his hands away from his waist. In the mirror, he met his eye. “ You can’t save everyone.”
“Of course alpha.” Tony said softly and again, when Steve tried to smile at him in the hopes that he would gain a response, the omega did not smile back.
“Well good!” Obadiah clapped his hands and nodded to his betas. “These fine young men are part of my group. If you wish to have Tony again, you only need send a message to these men at the front of my home. I promise you, they will be able to bring Tony to you by evening itself. Of course, the earlier you request him, the better. You should be aware that we give the omegas to whichever alphas have asked first. And I am aware Tony has caught the eye of a few others. I hope that’s not an issue?”
Concubines were the opposite. Their very role was different. As far as Steve was concerned, no respectable omega would offer themselves up like that.
“Is that why you were so..” Tony trailed off, almost as if in awe. They both knew what he meant to say.
There hadn’t been for a while now, Steve realized. The last month had changed Tony, had made him more reserved and more exhausted.
They kissed again, their lips melting together in a wave of heady warmth. The sensations, the touch and sight and taste and smell of Tony was everywhere and his heart and mind sung with pleasure at the thought. This omega had captured every part of him and tonight he would enjoy this omega and make good on his promise to give Tony what he wanted.
After a few moments, the coughing died down until Tony was still and ever so quiet. It was strange to see, particularly with how animated Tony usually was. And yet the omega was so quiet. It was jarring to say the least.
"Is there a specific reason why there's no technology?", asked Tony and Steve frowned at the rather innocent question.
"I love you too. No offense baby but you smell, maybe we should both get a shower?", asked Steve and captured Tony's soft lips for another desperate kiss, the billionaire closed his eyes satisfied and smirked into the kiss. The soldier placed his hands on Tony's waist and pressed the brunette hard against his chest. Tony yelped surprised at that but instantly melted into his boyfriend's strong body.
Tony instantly began hyperventilating and screaming for help. He couldn't stand up and he felt so helpless.
The brunette felt a strong wave of warmness overcoming him and he felt extremely happy which was also weird considering the situation he was in. He looked at his husband and blinked at him in confusion. Did Steve always have such wonderful eyes? The mechanic felt like gazing into an infinite ocean. He felt so good.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nat, Clint, Maria, Fury, Thor, Bruce, Rhodey and a lot of other guests lay unconsciously on the floor. Rumlow, Pierce, Sitwell, and Ward held weapons in their hands.
"It's alright my love.", whispered Steve into Tony's ear and the brunette got goosebumps at the low tone.
"I give you an option, Tony. You can either let go and drink the serum, or you try to fight it and I well inject it right into your bloodstream. I would prefer it if you drink it. I know how much you hate needles.", fat tears ran down Tony's cheek as he realized that he had no choice. He had to take the serum, there was no scenario where he would get out of this without being mind-controlled.
Furiously he put out his gun, which he hid in his suit and shot the priest between the eyes. The rather old man fell down and Steve put his gun back.
Tony bit his lower lip so hard that he tasted blood on them but he finally managed to slip out of the right cuff even though he dislocated his thumb. He instantly was met with a furious Steve who just walked into the small room.
Tonys' lip began to tremble and it didn't take another second as he began loudly sobbing and crying. Rogers instantly pulled Tony into his chest trying to calm the genius down.
”I planned to, but then came Fury to me and told me that Loki stole Hydras weapon, the Tesseract. I couldn't resist ya know? I wanted the power of the gods.", the soldier carefully stroke Tonys cheek with his thumb.
"So you think that they will join us for today?", asked Natasha as she jumped on the couch a huge bowl of popcorn with her.
"I am sorry.", without rethinking the idea he kicked Steve with all his force between his legs and sprinted away as Steve hit the floor in pain.
Captain Steve Rogers was a Hero. He was an amazing cook, an incredible artist, a good friend, and an even better boyfriend. No one could have guessed that the national Icon of the United States led a Nazi Organization. S.H.I.E.L.D was the new Hydra and no one, besides the own members knew. Tony should have known that something was wrong. The team often tried to talk to him about Steve's weird behavior. He spent most of his time at the S.H.I.E.L.D Compound. I didn't take part in the movie nights. And he barely cooked. Tony missed him of course, they were together for almost two years and it seemed like Steve didn't love him anymore. Tony spent his time in his workshop, he thought about new designs for Caps shield, maybe Steve would appreciate it. And maybe it would distract him from the thought that the soldier didn't love him anymore. The thought sent shivers down his spine and his stomach twisted. He didn't even realize that Nat entered the workshop with some food and a water bottle.
"You are doing great, honey. Just keep breathing.", Tony hugged Steve back as he realized that he could breathe again and that his panic attack was over.
It was night at the Maldives and Steve and Tony already slept in their shared bed. Well, Steve slept, Tony waited patiently and when he was sure that the soldier slept for about half an hour he silently got up and searched his husband leather jacket in the hope to find a smartphone in there. Steve told him that he didn't take one with him, but the mechanic didn't really believe that. There was no smartphone.
"I am so sorry, honey, but you left me no other choice.", the room was completely dark but Tony knew because of Steve's voice that the soldier had to be right next to him. He felt his hot breath against his ear and Tony shut his eyes closed while he tried to calm down.
"I love you and I'll do anything to make you feel better my love.", Tony snuggled himself into Steve’s warm chest and slowly dozed off.
”Everything is great, thanks, Nat. Do you think it would be okay to have a glass of champagne? I am thirsty.", said the blonde and glanced at Rumlows direction.
"I have to make a call, I'll be expecting you in the living room.", said Steve, he grabbed his black smartphone which he got from S.H.I.E.L.D and went to one of the many bathrooms, closing the door behind him. Steve then dialed the number of one of his colleagues.
"Sounds plausible, yeah. Sorry, I just thought that you wanted to hide something from me.", mumbled Tony and leaned into Steves tender touches.
'Why can't I sleep?', asked Tony himself and rolled back on his stomach. He suddenly felt a warm hand on one of his shoulders and stopped moving.
"Hey, guys! What are we watching?", asked Tony as he cuddled himself into Steves's warm chest and threw a blanket to every team member. Bruce couldn't help but smile at that. He knew that Tony was sad the last few days and that he barricaded himself in his workshop, but he was glad that this changed.
"Oh honey, don't worry I just gave you something so you won't feel afraid. It's okay.", shushed Steve as he continued to caress his lover's cheek. Tony didn't understand the world anymore. He was so god damn confused.
„Hey, it's okay, honey. It's not your fault. These bastards ruined our wedding, not you. You were perfect and I love you so much.", whispered Steve and caressed Tony's hazelnut brown hair.
"You should take a break, Tony. You didn't sleep for days.", the assassin sounded worried but Tony didn't care. He just wanted to know, why Steve spent days on a mission and didn't bother to contact him. He missed his strong arms that kept his body safe after a nightmare. Missed the soft lips that would crush against his own and would trail kisses all over his body. He missed Steve's pancakes with lots of bacon in the morning.
"I hope you know that if anyone finds out about this that we are going to have a big problem. There aren't many excuses for a mind manipulation serum.", Steve looked into the mirror frowning at the last sentence.
"Hey Platypus, are you and the others doing fine? Sorry for the messed up wedding, by the way.", Tony walked back and forth and waited for Rhodey's reaction.
Steve couldn't wait to marry Tony. He already put on his Giorgio Armani Tuxedo which looked very traditional with the black and white. He combed and gelled his blond hair and thought if he should rather wear a midnight blue or a black tie.
I can't even remember what happened. Did we fight or did we just collapse? Were Steve and Tony also drugged? Nobody knows.", mumbled Natasha as she held her head with her right hand. She was exhausted.
Tony let out a soft moan and tried to deepen the kiss even more. Steve carefully massaged his husbands thighs and rubbed small circles over his jeans. "Off.", mumbled the brunette almost desperate as the soldier continued to pet his thigh.
Clint instantly began to type some commands into the keyboard and the team could hear a loud clear voice in the video.
"You- you drugged our friends! You drugged me! You shot Fury, ruined our own wedding! I don't even know if you just played with my feelings or if you really love me I don't know!", Tony took a deep breath and tried to calm down.
"Okay I have enough of you and your Self-destructive behavior.", said Steve and instantly grabbed Tony's wrist and tied it with some rope to the bed frame.
“Tony? Honey? You are crying.", Steve tried his best to contain his worry and carefully swiped away some tears.
"I think I am doing fine. Thanks.", mumbled Tony and his husband pressed a soft kiss on his forehead.
"Oh honey, that's what they told you, right? That they died in a car crash. It's awful how no one told you the truth about your own parents.", Tony began to shiver and he once again felt like there was no air to inhale in the room.
"Honey, you are scaring me. Please talk to me.", Steve lay his other hand in his husband's hair and began to stroke his hazelnut brown hair. Tony continued sobbing as he finally managed to talk.
‚Come on Stark, think! There has to be a boat or a Quinjet somewhere!', thought the genius and kept running as he suddenly found himself at the beach again. 'Goddamnit since when is this island so small?!'
„Yeah, our Captain is being weird.", agreed Thor he just wanted to suggest to start the movie as he heard the elevator opening. Tony and Steve stepped out of it both extremely happy as they sat down on the couch.
He tried to remember anything from his wedding but it seemed like that there was a giant hole in his memories.
"Honey, if you don't mind I would like to ask you a very important question", Tony looked at Steve confusion in his whiskey brown eyes and he gave his boyfriend an unsure look. Steve smiled before he began his speech.
"I love you! I always had and probably always will, but I don't know if I can do that if you are part of a freaking Nazi organization!", Steve also stood up and waited patiently for Tony to stop screaming.
"My scientists invented a serum. Honestly I don't know what's in it I was too busy planning our wedding. What I know is that there are a lot of nanoparticles in it that will control some parts of your brain. It's not dangerous, and you will still be my little genius after you drink it. It will make you obedient, you will finally understand that everything I do is right and that Hydra tries to save the day. You will be my king and together we will rule the world.", Steve sounded so confident and Tony did his best not to puke out of pure disgust. Steve had to be crazy if he thought that he would drink this willingly.
"You know, I kinda knew that you wouldn't join Hydra that easily. I also knew that you would try to escape. I prepared something for you to be more obedient. It's nothing dangerous and it won't hurt.", Tony's heart began to race and his breathing got much faster as Steve stood up and tapped on the little bottle.
You are beautiful, strong, intelligent and so much more. I fell in love with you and decided to wait with the whole world domination until you would be by my side.", Tony bit on his bottom lip and pressed his eyes closed. This couldn't be true.
"Hail Hydra.", whispered Tony before he fell unconsciously into Steve's open arms. The soldier smiled happily before he carefully laid Tony down on the floor.
"You- you actually.", Tony couldn't even form a logical sentence he stared out of the window and then back to his husband, who grinned at his excitement.
"Are there any other calls that focus on the serum?", asked Bruce as he thought about what Steve would want with a serum.
„You are going to hell for this! This isn't true love! You are kidnapping your own husband!", Steve frowned at the statement. How could someone so unimportant just tell if it was true love or not?! He loved Tony and Tony loved him!
Steve carefully pulled Tony's engagement ring off and slipped a new golden ring on his finger. He placed another similar ring on his own.
Tony woke up hours later with a giant headache. He slowly blinked his eyes open only to close them seconds later. He felt definitely dead. Maybe he was dead.
Tony looked suspiciously at the small bottle and Steve kneeled beside him as he noticed his husbands look. He set the item down at the bedside table and tried his best to make eye contact.
Tony couldn't remember the last time he slept so well. He was pretty sure that it was already 10 am as he slowly blinked his eyes open to see Steve sitting beside him a huge grin on his face. The engineer smiled softly back before he stood up and stretched his arms.
"I didn't care about the team. I only cared about the tesseract. Until I saw your precious face on one of the S.H.I.E.L.D files. I absolutely hated you as I read that you were Howard's son. But then I read about all the things you had done. You turned from an arrogant playboy to a selfless superhero.
Tony definitely loved the zoo and he loved the penguins there even more. Steve didn't really understand why Tony loved the flightless birds so much. He liked the grizzly bear the most, he didn't even know why he just felt a connection to the animal. Tony seemed to have a connection to every single animal at the zoo. He loved the penguins, admired the snow leopards, adored the sea lions and the ruffed lemurs. Steve didn't even know that his boyfriend loved animals so much, but it made him happy to see Tony smiling. They spent 2 hours at the zoo, they then went to a restaurant on 5th Avenue and walked to Belvedere Castle and to Shakespeare Garden.
"Would it be a problem for you if Brock gets the champagne? I thought that you could go to Tony and see if everything's alright? You know how nervous he can get.", said Steve which made Natasha nod in agreement, and she left.
Why were there no other tourists? There were 20 other little holiday huts and they seemed completely empty.
"We should head back to the tower. It's movie night after all.", mumbled Tony as they kept walking through Central Park. Steve nodded at that and pressed a quick kiss to Tony's cheek.
"Okay... So Steve is Hydra, the fucking Strike team is Hydra and even Alexander Pierce the leader of S.H.I.E.L.D is Hydra!
Steve smiled and prepared himself to finally marry Tony. It was a very fast process he approached the altar and couldn't help but smile as he saw Tony in the near same suit as his. The only difference was that he wore the midnight blue tie.
"Tony no! He is going to force you to-", Rhodey couldn't even finish what he was about to say because Tony instantly continued screaming.
"Why did you leave without telling me? You told the whole team but didn't bother to tell your boyfriend about the mission.", Tony tried to look angry but he looked more like a kicked puppy. Steve carefully cupped Tony's face in his hands and stroke a tear away. He tried to look into the brunette's eyes to give him a feeling of safety.
'Well, that's great. He really doesn't remember anything.’, thought Steve as he sat on the other side of the bed.
"Come on, Honey. Only two words and I promise that nothing is going to happen to our friends". Tony shook his head. The champagne was definitely drugged, who was he kidding he couldn't even stand on his own two feet.
"Tony! Oh god what happened?!", Tony dared to look up to see Steve in his S.H.I.E.L.D Uniform. His hair looked oily and stood in all directions. Tony stared at his ocean blue eyes and he sobbed again. Steve carefully laid his right hand on one of Tony's shoulders and tried to shush him down.
Tony didn't feel bothered by it but it was kinda weird. Well, there could be a possibility that the smaller resorts had a TV. Tony sighed as he decided to put on his swim trunks and went into the outdoor swimming pool.
„'s wrong.", slurred Tony, he didn't want to say it, it felt so god damn wrong to even think about it.
"It wasn't your fault. We should have been much more careful.", mumbled Clint and stared at the DVD on his hands.
The billionaire began to slightly panic as he realized that even his legs were bound to the bed and the only thing he could move was his head.
"My apologies Dr. Banner. Captain Rogers deactivated me through the wedding it took me some time to reboot.", Jarvis's voice sounded kind and it seemed like he didn't know what had happened.
We have absolutely no clue, where Tony and Steve are, Tony got kidnapped by his own husband, he probably doesn't remember anything that happened and there is a possibility that they are both on a luxurious honeymoon and Tony thinks that Steve saved him. WHAT THE FUCK!", exclaimed Clint as he was the first one to speak. Bruce took a few deep breaths and tried to calm down.
"I wanna take a shower.", mumbled Tony, he yawned quietly and Steve saw that as a sign that he needed to bring Tony upstairs for a shower and then into their bedroom. Steve nodded and carefully picked him up bridal style. He selected his and Tony's floor at the elevator and brought his boyfriend silently into the bathroom, where he let him carefully down.
"Maybe this will have some answers. I just hope that you know, that I  am here for you, Steve and Tony are also my friends and I'd do anything to get them back.", at the exact same second Clint finished his speech, came Thor, Bruce, and Rhodey into the room.
The mechanic nodded quietly at that and came to the conclusion that Steve really just wanted to have a normal honeymoon.
"Oh honey, but it is.", Steve carefully wiped away a few tears that trickled down his already reddened cheeks.
"My parents died in a car crash, they weren't murdered", Tony didn't trust his own voice and Steve frowned slightly at his husband's missing knowledge.
The soldier knew that Tony tried his best to keep his calm and he slowly stroked Tonys inner thighs. Tony couldn't hold back and he
He just wanted to run into the forest again as he felt strong electricity coursing through his body and he fell unconsciously to the sandy ground.
He didn't care about everyone else like the priest or their friends and the many hydra agents like Pierce, Rumlow, Sitwell, and Ward that sat in the crowd.
"See? You enjoy it.", whispered Steve into his ear and Tony whimpered as he felt how the soldier opened the button of his jeans.
"S-Steve? What happened? I don't remember anything. Where are we? Did we get married? Why is my head hurting so much?", asked Tony in a rush before Steve put his index finger against his lips.
"I knew that Howard was possessed of me. I mean come on I was just a weak kid with asthma back then and he transformed me into a super hero. But believe me if I knew that he would hate on his own son, maybe I would have murdered him myself.", Tony's eyes widened in shock and he felt like he was punched in the stomach.
"I love you so much.", said Tony as he got Steve into a bone-crushing hug. The soldier chuckled and placed a soft kiss on Tony's forehead.
"Can you please get these off, sugarplum? It really starts hurting.", mumbled the mechanic still dazed.
”I know that the world changed. But why the fuck didn't you start your plan of world domination earlier?", Tony could see how a big smirk formed on Steve's lips.
"I am going to bring you some comfy clothes so that you can instantly go to sleep alright?", Tony nodded with a huge smile on his face and asked himself how he deserved such a loving boyfriend then he pulled down his clothes and got into the shower. It was a very quick process because he only put some expensive shampoo into his hair and rubbed some body wash on his skin that smelt like strawberries. After rinsing everything off, he stepped out of it and dried himself off. A quick glance at the door made Tony realize that Steve watched him the whole time with a smirk on his face and he only wore a tight T-Shirt and some boxer-shorts.
"That's great! Are we going to the Central Park Zoo? I'd love to see the Penguins of Madagascar!", Steve chuckled at the silly joke and cupped his face in his hands. Looking into Tony's warm, trusting eyes. He hated the thought that his eyes could be full of fear and contempt.
„Kinda sad, that we had to drug the champagne. It is surely expensive.", said Ward as he also took a greedy sip of the fizzy liquid.
"I have a surprise for you.", said Steve happily and Tony couldn't help but feel excited about it and pressed a tender kiss on Steves's lips.
"That's no problem! I'll tell the waiters to give everyone a glass.", Natasha just wanted to leave the small room as the soldier called her back.
"There is only one problem, at your plan, gorgeous. I will not drink this shit! You can't make me because I will spit it out even before it went down my pipe! I am afraid that you have to get yourself another slave!", shouted Tony and hoped that Steve didn't hear how his voice wavered.
He still had no clue about what was going on. A warm hand caressed his left cheek and someone pressed a tender kiss on his forehead.
"I love you. I know I tell you this one hundred times a day, but I also know that I have been a real jerk, the last few weeks. I just want to keep you safe and I feel like I can only do that if I work for S.H.I.E.L.D. It was a stupid idea, I know that now.", Tony nodded slightly at that, happy that Steve recognized his own mistake.
"Guys I know you are all upset, believe me, I am too. But right now is our top priority to find Tony.", said Natasha and tried to sound as calm as she could.
"Jarvis, we are sorry, but the wedding was a complete mess. Turned out that Steve and a lot of people from S.H.I.E.LD are part of Hydra.", mumbled Clint, he still couldn't believe it. How could Captain America do something like that?!
"Tony, please listen to me. Steve is the one who ruined your wedding. He, Ward, Pierce, Sitwell, Rumlow and lots of other S.H.I.E.L.D members are part of Hydra.", Tony blinked a few times and tried to understand the situation.
He decided to go with the black one, Tony would probably use midnight blue. He heard that the door opened up and saw Natasha and Rumlow which were both ready for the ceremony. Nat wore a red off-shoulder dress and Rumlow a classic grey tuxedo.
"Yeah, I know. In the kitchen are two different bottles of knockout drops. You have to put 3 drops of chloral hydrate in the glass of every normal guest, including Nat, Clint, Bruce, Fury,
Tony instantly ran outside and went into one of the other holiday huts, where he hacked, himself into Steves's phone.
This shit has got to be out of vibranium. There was no way that he couldn't get out of just normal handcuffs.
„It's pretty easy, my love. You only have to say the words Hail Hydra, okay?”, Tonys' mind was foggy and he had trouble understanding the question.
"I love you with my whole heart and I think that it is finally time to ask you.", Steve made a dramatic pause as he bent down to one knee, pulled out the small box and opened it, the silver ring reflecting the last sun strays. Tonys' eyes widened and he clapped both his hands over his mouth, tears of joy welled up in his eyes.
Thor looked suspiciously at Pierce and Rumlow, they were one of the first guests besides the Avengers. He didn't even know them but apparently, they were good friends with Steve.
Steve nodded and instantly opened the left handcuff with a small key and opened the silky rope so that Tony's hands could easily slip free. He then went to his feet and also uncuffed him.
"Jarvis, are you here?", seconds of silence passed and the team almost gave the hope up that Tony's Artificial Intelligence was activated.
"What is wrong with you?! Steve is probably one of the best things that ever happened to me. He would never force me to anything I wouldn't want! I am sorry, but I can't let him go. I can't.", with these words, he ended the call and threw the phone away.
"I know I ask that a lot lately. But are you fine? You seem worried.", said Steve as he tried to make eye contact with his husband.
Steve smirked a little and placed another soft kiss on his lovers lips as he slowly unbuttoned his surely expensive trousers. Rogers carefully lifted Tony's backside up and pulled down his jeans while Tony let out soft little moans.
"I want to show you one last place" Tony and Steve walked for another five minutes until they reached the Gapstow bridge. The water reflected the bridge, flowers, plants, and trees. Tony never saw anything more beautiful in his life. He was completely alone with the love of his life in such a beautiful, magical place. This was definitely the best day of his life.
"Honey, it takes me 4 hours to get to Washington D.C by car and you have to understand that I want to explore the city.", that was a lie, Steve could fly with a private jet if he wanted to and he didn't even have time to stare out of the window while he was at the Triskelion. Steve placed a soft reassuring kiss on Tony's lips and the brunette leaned greedy into it. Oh, he totally forgot that Tony had separation anxiety and got touch starved easily. Steve grinned and went for another kiss, as soon as the first ended. This one was more heated and Steve pushed his tongue into Tony's mouth. The mechanic moaned slightly and began to circle his boyfriend's tongue with his own. They had to end the kiss a few minutes later because they both didn't get in enough air.
"Guess it would be the best if I show you.", said Steve as he opened the blinds with a small remote.
”Come on, you escaped from a god damn cave. You will manage to escape from your super-soldier husband.", huffed Tony to himself as he continued to fumble with his hands.
"Tony! Thank God, how are you?! Where are you?! Is Rogers with you?!", Tony was confused, was something wrong? Okay, that was a stupid question, of course, was something wrong or Rhodey wouldn't sound so panicked.
"Well, you better don't get caught then. I want the serum delivered as soon as it is ready, alright?", the tone of the soldier's voice left no room for any arguments and Brock ended the call with the word.
"Please don't play dumb. Rhodey said that you were part of- I can't even say it!", shouted Tony and stood furiously up.
"It's alright. It's alright. Just concentrate on my hug. It's okay, honey. It's okay.", Tony tried to focus on the hug and began to slowly breathe in and out. Steve hugged him. He knew that Steve worked for Hydra but Tony couldn't find a difference now that he knew.
"I successfully found a recording of one of Steve Rogers's calls. He called Brock Rumlow, member of the Strike team.", Natasha frowned deeply at that and opened the audio data which Jarvis transferred onto the computer.
”I always wanted to rule this world. You know back in the 40s there was not much Technology, people showed you respect if you did something great like going into the war. Life was hard and we didn't have a lot to eat but we tried to make the best of it. Then I crashed the plane and woke up 70 years later.
"You know what? Today is probably one of the greatest days of my life. It's beautiful, here!", Tony couldn't get enough of the beautiful flowers and plants that grew in the garden.
"You may kiss now.", Steve didn't waste another second, he pressed a possessive kiss on Tony's lips and the brunette felt slightly overwhelmed in his husband's strong arms. His mind was foggy and his knees began to wobble.
"Yeah sounds fun.", he pressed a soft kiss on Tony's lips before he told him to get dressed and to eat something.
It turned out that Tony loved the Maldives. There was nobody except the two of them and it was perfect. Steve cooked breakfast, lunch, and dinner and it reminded Tony of home. Well, there was one thing Tony missed on their honeymoon. There were absolutely no electronic devices. No smartphones, no TV's, no tablets, and no notebooks.
„Well, that really was a spectacular wedding.", said Rumlow before he took a sip from his non-drugged champagne.
"Where are we going?", asked Tony, humming softly as Steve brushed one of his curls out of his face and nipped at his ear.
"Hey, it's alright. We did get married. You collapsed into my arms seconds later. Maybe that's the reason why you don't remember it.", shushed Steve which made Tony feel even worse. He couldn't even remember the moment when he said Yes, I do. A loud ugly sob escaped his mouth and he cried into his husband's neck.
"Captain, what's up?", Rumlow sounded stressed at the moment but the blonde could nonetheless hear respect in his voice.
"Hey, we just wanted to see if everything was alright.", said Natasha with a warm smile on her lips.
"Rumlow, Have you talked to the scientists?", there was a pregnant pause and Steve thought for a second that Brock ended the call. Rumlow sighed heavily into the speaker before he began to explain the situation.
Tony gasped at the sight he got through the window. There was a freaking turquoise lagoon, green palms, and a swimming pool. Tony jumped up and looked out of the window. They were on the Maldives in the 5 stars luxury resort hotel he always wanted to go.
"Understood." Steve grinned and put on a pair of black jeans, a white T-shirt and a brown leather jacket that hung in the wardrobe. He quickly checked if the small box was still in his pocket and opened it, just to be sure that the ring was there. Steve smiled as he saw the silver ring with lots of little diamonds. He closed the box and put it back into one of the pockets of his jacket. Steve then made his way downstairs to the living room where he saw Tony wearing a pair of blue jeans combined with a grey T-shirt a pair of sunglasses and a brown leather jacket that seemed very similar to Steve's one. Tony smiled at the sight of his boyfriend and already pressed the button on the elevator.
"The drugs began to kick in at that moment. You can see it on how our legs began to wobble. Continue the video.", Clint pushed the space bar and it could be seen how Steve kissed Tony and the guests went unconscious, one after another.
"No! Of course not, why should I take my smartphone with me, if I don't want you to use it? That would be unfair to you.", reasoned Steve and began to caress Tony's cheek.
”I told my scientists about your heart condition. I am pretty sure that they took it into consideration. But you know what they say. Better safe than sorry.", mumbled the blond and left the hut with his S.H.I.E.L.D phone.
"What are you talking about? Steve is one of the only people who love me! He cares for me, protects me and does everything to make me happy!", exclaimed Tony over the phone and tried to keep his calm.
"YES! Of course, how could I say no?", Steve laughed as he slowly stood up Tony still in his strong arms. Steve began to kiss Tony like there was no tomorrow. They were finally engaged. He was finally engaged with the love of his life. Steve pulled away for a second and put the ring slowly on Tony's ring finger. He then continued to kiss him. Tony smiled widely and kissed his finance eagerly back and Steve put his hands to Tony's neck to push him deeper into the kiss. They both had to pull away minutes later to get air into their lungs.
"No, believe me. They are too busy doing stuff. I just hope that there are no problems in their relationship. Steve seems so distant.", said Clint as he took a long sip of his coke.
"Am I the only one who realizes what's going on?! Steve knows that Tony would never side with Hydra, willingly. There is only one way how they both can be happy", Natasha's eyes widened in realization and even Thor seemed to get it.
"Jesus Steve, how am I supposed to hide this?", asked Tony and saw through the mirror that Steve just shrugged his shoulders.
"Don't, the color suits you.", Tony sighed and chose to put on the clothes that Steve brought him. A simple black boxer shorts, a pair of grey sweatpants and a plain T-shirt.
"Is it true?", Steve raised his right eyebrow at the question because he had no clue what Tony meant with that question.
"I detected another call, the date when it took place is pretty interesting. Captain Rogers called Brock Rumlow on the 26th May 2014 which is the same day when the Captain proposed to Mr. Stark.", Clint looked at Nat and she nodded in confirmation.
”Oh don't give me that look! I called the scientist and they said that you should be just fine and that you were probably stalling, and now I come back and what do I see?! You free yourself out of the fucking vibranium cuffs, I designed for exactly this purpose!", Tony flinched when Steve hit his fist against the bedside table in anger his eyes dark with fury.
"I don't need stupid pills to fall asleep, I'm Tony Stark after all", mumbled the billionaire against his pillow and closed his eyes once again. Steve grinned at that and grabbed his boyfriend at the right shoulder to maneuver him on his back.
"I am sorry that you had to find out that way. But I promise you that my feelings were always real. They never changed and I want you to know that when I proposed to you and when we married that I only had eyes for you.", Tony didn't even have time to comprehend the words because the second Steve stopped talking he went forward and kissed him fiercely on the lips.
"Hmm weird? Maybe a little bit touch starved? And my arms hurt because I am bound to the bed? I mean you know that I have a huge bondage kink but it's really kinda starting to hurt.", mumbled Tony and Steves's eyes widened in shock. What the hell?! The serum really did work! It seemed like Tony forgot everything that happened the last hours.
"I know you have tons of questions but please just let me explain it.", mumbled he and Tony nodded slowly at the instruction.
The mechanic felt relieved as the blonde finally went to the door and left the room. It gave Tony time to think about his escape. The brunette didn't really have much time to think about anything because Steve entered the room only two minutes after he had left. And he had a small glass bottle with him.
They gave everyone knockout drops and it seems like no one remembers anything. Including you. The team is fine, they are in a safe house. They are all okay, besides Fury, they shot him.", it took Tony a second to process the spoken words before he nodded his head again and cuddled himself into Steve's chest.
"Trust me, honey. It's getting even better.", said Steve, a huge smile on his face, they then went to Ladies Pavilion, Bow Bridge, Bethesda Fountain, and the Mall and Literary Walk. Tony loved every single place and the thought that this amazing day would end soon made him kinda sad.
He slowly sunk down to the wooden floor and realized that he was in a God damn hut which was built above the water.
Rhodey and Hill. You have to put 8 drops in Thor's glass. There is another bottle with benzodiazepines, you only put 3 of those drops in Tony's glass.", explained Steve and Rumlow nodded in agreement and walked into the kitchen.
"You either drink this willingly or I swear to God that you won't like the outcome of this, have you understood?", Tony nodded his head anxiously and opened his mouth slightly as Steve placed the bottle to his lips. He instantly swallowed the weird flavored fluid and felt how his head began to swim.
"I know, baby. I know. Just let it out. It will be so much easier after you took the serum, I promise. Nothing will change between us we will still be married, we will cuddle, kiss and do everything you want.", Tony hated it. He hated that Steve let this sound like nothing. What he hated most was that a part of his brain told him that this would be okay. Nothing would change.
People have TV's, smartphones, enough food and most of them don't have to fight in wars. The people are doing well but they don't show respect to others. The children are rich brats who don't know how good they have it! Other countries still have wars but nobody does anything against it, climate change exists, our planet is full with plastic and nobody does anything against it! If Hydra rules the world and kills only a few million people do you know how good this would be for us? For the planet for the whole Population?", the light was finally turned on and Tony blinked to get used to the brightness.
"You found anything, yet?", asked Natasha as she saw how Clint entered the room with a DVD in his right hand.
"I am sorry. I feel so overwhelmed. It's like my feelings are all over the place. I don't know what's happening I felt so happy only a few seconds ago and now I can't stop crying. I am such a mess.", the billionaire continued crying and Steve carefully threw a blanket over him and did his best to shush him down.
His thoughts were interrupted when he felt two strong arms around his waist which pulled him into a tight hug.
Steve grinned evilly and pressed a soft kiss on the mechanic's exposed neck. Tony bit his lip even harder under normal circumstances he would show Steve how much he loved the kisses to his neck, now he tried to do anything to ignore his husband.
"Please fuck me~.", Steve grinned widely at the instruction and pulled down Tony's pants, licking his lips at the beautiful sight.
He slowly opened his eyes and wanted to rub his head to ease the pain as he realized that his arms were chained to the bed.
"Tony can you describe how you feel exactly besides funny?", asked the super-soldier as he looked at his husband's dilated pupils.
"Enjoying the view, Rogers?", asked the brunette as he seductively dried his thighs and then threw the white towel away. Steve grinned even more at that question and hugged his boyfriend from behind where he placed a wet kiss to Tony's jaw.
They watched the part where Steve forced Tony to say Hail Hydra and how Tony fell unconsciously into Steves's arms. That was the last scene before the projection went black.
"It's not only that! You barely spend time with the team! You keep saying that you are in Washington because of S.H.I.E.L.D, but I don't believe it anymore!", Tony began to sound angry now, but Steve kept his calm.
"We should probably go back. It's getting dark.", murmured Tony and he closed his eyes as Steve caressed his left cheek.
"Why?", whispered Tony into the darkness trying to understand why his husband would do something so terrible.
"This DVD contains the only recording of the wedding. It may help us to find them. Or maybe we can figure out who is behind all of this.", explained Nat as she took the DVD from Clint and laid it into the DVD drive of the computer.
"They drugged Tony with benzodiazepines. It's usually used to handle anxiety and has a relaxing effect"
"Let's blow this popsicle stand. It won't take long until they wake up. Even though they won't remember much because of the chloral hydrate.", Steve picked Tony up bridal style an made his way to one of the Quinjets.
