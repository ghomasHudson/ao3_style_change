"I thought Bucky would wake up in the morning, realize the mistake and I'd never see him again. But. . . I woke up to him lazily kissing me. He told me I was better than any dame he'd had and treated me real nice, took it slow til I was begging for more of the roughness he gave me before."
"I'm sorry, I can't. . !" He cried as he buried himself as deep as he could go, flooding Steve with his hot cum.
"I've kind of had enough of skipping around through time for one lifetime, Tony." He pulled him in close, crushing him to his chest. "Thank you for not killing him. Where is he?"
"I know all about trying to not feel things. Believe me." Dr Banner had a vague and sort of sad look on his face.
Tony stood and joined him, gathering him up in his arms. "He had a pulse when they brought him in twelve hours ago and nobody's said any different." He pressed his lips to Cap's temple and held him tighter as Steve's shoulders began to shake.
. He looked down at his hands folded on top of the blankets. "God no." He breathed, laying back, tears falling freely.
Peter was running his hands up and down the metal arm, feeling all the seams and joints between the plates as Bucky moved it around to demonstrate.
Tony cried out unexpectedly, arching back, covering his mouth. Steve felt a healthy amount of wet, hot semen on his stomach. "God-fucking-damnit-you-fucking-did-it." Tony gasped out in a hurried jumble. "You're an asshole."
Bucky's face fell and his look became sullen and he couldn't meet Tony's eye. "Kid's hurt." He grumbled.
impatient in my old age, pal." He chuckled but the sound was cut off by a gasp as Steve licked a stripe up the length of his cock.
He had to pull himself down from a panic attack as he gathered his things and ascended in the elevator to Bruce's lab.
"There is something though. Something that's bothering me, my dearest." Steve pulled away and leaned on the table. "You're hiding something. Tell me, now."
The room was huge, it could have easily fit Steve's entire apartment in it twice. The center of the room was dominated by a huge, unmade bed with dark gray sheets and a navy blue spread. There was a sofa and chair of the same gray paired with a low coffee table in one corner and a dressing table, stool and coatrack in another. The coatrack, Steve noted was unused with several coats puddled at the base of it.
Just as he caught sight of the reflection of himself in the window, a young boy with a plaster on his nose, missing a front tooth, the sound of rustling fabric and heels on the  worn floorboards made him turn. No one was there and, when he turned back to the window he was looking at himself as he'd seen in the glass on the photo.
Bucky glanced over at him, he purposefully made the car lurch and Tony grabbed the dashboard in alarm. Bucky's laugh made Tony all but snarl.
" Bucky went limp on his grip. "I remember them all every day. Every time I close my eyes. I even see them in the mirror."
He lay panting, spent and excessively contented. But he didn't get to really relax very long when he felt Steve lifting him up.
"I don't." He stated in a breath whisper. He got to his knees and climbed over Steve, letting his his ass rub back against the tip of his arousal. He ran his hands through Steve's hair then bent to suckle a mark onto the man's neck, relishing in the tight groan that escaped him. "I wish these marks would last out the night." Tony chuckled, nipping Steve's earlobe.
He stretched, finding no aches and pains as he stood. It was still a shock after the procedure; the not feeling pain or having to massage out stiff joints every morning to be able to move.
They really talk. They discuss how toxic the way they'd both behaved had been. How things were a tangle of mixed signals and missed signs. They talked about the night that Bucky had tried to leave. They talked about the fighting. They talked about Bucky's suicidal thoughts, his little hair cutting fiasco-- it was still choppy and almost to the scalp in places.
Steve smirked and nipped Bucky's ear. "That's what they tell me." He purred deeply as he pressed his hips to Bucky's with intent. Bucky gasped at feeling the hot press of Steve's rigid cock through the soft sweats the man wore.
"I'm sorry, Pete." He choked out, wanting to tuck his arms away out of sight somewhere. Somewhere they couldn't hurt anyone.
His breath hitched and he reached into his pajamas, lightly stroking himself. The extent of the numbness was more apparent though it was localized to the left side near the base. Not a huge problem.
"Open." Steve instructed firmly and Tony let him feed him the bite.  He chewed slowly, keeping his eyes on Steve.
Howard Stark had been the only one to really ever acknowledge that there was something there, even when Steve himself couldn't. "Your Sargent Whats-his-name" that's what Howard had called Bucky.
Steve looked him over as he passed the apple from palm to palm. "Bucky I--- I" he stammered. Words welled and faded, thoughts crashed into one another like a torrent. He looked over Bucky, sitting there with his metal fingers laced together on the tabletop. He was looking up at him just barely, his head still ducked down.
It started slow, just barely above anything chaste but Tony's tongue darted out to briefly swipe across Bucky's lips.
They'd been in the hospital for twelve hours already. The news had broken about Zemo and the bombing. It was a weight off Steve to have Tony know.
Thus far Peter just watched his friend. But Bucky's face was twitching and and his mouth was moving silently.
"I mean, and hear me out, you got anything risky? Even if you have thought about it and thrown it out." Tony's eyes widened then narrowed conspiratorially. "Snow white there might appreciate it. In the long run." He tapped the glass with the plate he held.
That was a difficult conclusion to come to. He and Steve just used one another's bodies. a warm place on cold nights. And hell, Steve had to lose his virginity some how right?
that you're kissing other people?" When Steve refilled his coffee, Tony snatched it away and took a drink of the scalding liquid.
"Are you mad, Stevie, mad that I survived? Mad that I'm this thing now? Mad that I want more for myself?" He was shoved into the wall. "Know what else, Tony deserves better. Quit thinking with your dick, Steve."
"Bucky I . . . I couldn't lose you." Steve hung his head, focusing on not squeezing Bucky's hand too hard.
"I. . ." Whenever Bucky tried thinking of his family he only got these vague shapes floating in his mind. "I don't. I don't remember them."
"Next of kin for a Mr Barnes?" She asked first in German then in English. Her voice startled the two men who had lightly dozed off on the floor.
The sound he made when he submerged his aching muscles in the water was almost obscene. He was glad no one could hear it.
He and Bruce hadn't wanted to but they ended up having to basically flay Bucky's chest and carefully reintegrate their own leads while moving the HYDRA ones. It was practically smooth sailing after that. Practically.
"Do you think we could all three work it out together? Because damn, I've grown fond of Snow White here."
"Tony what!?" He gave up on the crutch and let himself roll for cover. The dresser exploded into splinters and Bucky rolled again, making for the door.
Bucky was sitting on the floor by the window, forehead pressed against the glass, naked but for a pair of boxer briefs. A tiny pair of nail scissors dangled from one of his metallic fingers.
Bucky was adjusting to the new apartment with minimal difficulty. He'd gotten the hang of the crutch after a few days and could maneuver around like it was second nature.
"All the little tactile things." Tony startled him by speaking right by his right ear. The man's eyes were trained on the Vibranium hand with interest. "I got some tests to run once you fully come out of the anesthesia. But it all looks really good, right Bruce?"
"Please Tony!" He cried after a moment. "Please I want you." It was his turn to tremble. He looked back at Tony, face flushed, lips parted.
He leaned forward again and managed pulling Steve's undershirt off over his head. His lips kissed a searing trail down Steve's neck and over his chest. He lingered on a pale pink nipple, first rubbing just his lower lip over it, then his tongue. God the sounds Steve made!
Steve instinctively wrapped them around him. God those muscles, so beautiful sculpted, powerful--- A work of art.
"Please!" Tony yelped as Cap began lightly pumping him. Cap just kept smirking and moving his hand along til it was practically coated in precum.
Rain was pouring there was gunfire in the distance, but none of that seemed to matter, not even how cold it was.
Bucky let his chin drop to his chest. "I'm not. You're wrong." He suddenly felt very exposed without the curtain of hair to shield his face.
"Yeah and you're gonna regret that haircut in the morning, so." He stood and stretched hard, heading for the bedroom door. "Breakfast is a yes then?"
His hand left the tree stump and gripped his own aching need. "Hah-hurry, Stevie." He risked groaning out. Steve bit his lip and bucked harder.
Tony finds himself sitting back on the table with Barnes' mouth on his. It's not frantic or heated it's slow and soft and. . . And Tony melts into it like snow in the spring thaw.
Two of Stark's fingers were deep inside, curling and thrusting, stretching Rogers, teasing his spot.
"I'm really glad to meet you on non-combat terms, Pete, was it?" Bucky flashed a charming smile and laughed easily when Peter began to run off at the mouth at him.
In the days immediately following Dr Erskine's assassination, Steve found it hard to adjust. He had this inkling at the back of his mind that the doc had just survived, he'd have had en easier time, more sage advice.
"Needed to try to bury feelings that could have gotten me killed. Needed to hide when I couldn't deny them any more." Bucky nodded. "But I also couldn't risk you getting caught up in my being a f-- me being gay, Stevie, I couldn't."
He sank down onto the still-warm cushions Steve had just vacated and stared blankly at the carpet, losing himself in his swirling thoughts, emotions he couldn't sort from one another.
"Like letting us love you!" Tony shoved him, hard but he barely took a step back. Bucky was getting that cold look in his eyes, that Winter Soldier look.
"Mh. And I saw you on that tape. You were just so cold and. . . And efficient. It was so hard to disconnect who you are from who you were. The only thing I could think about was how gentle you seem, how I was somehow being fooled."
Bucky dropped to his knees and unzipped Tony's pants. He wouldn't hear protest as he took Tony's cock out. It was a little more than semi hard.
Bucky forced himself to look at Bruce. The hand on his chest helped ground him and soon he was shakily breathing himself down from the attack.
Cap growled low in Tony's ear. After a moment's hesitation he bucked his hips, finally pressing his pelvis to plush ass. He arched back, breathing a sigh of near relief at being fully seated inside Tony's hot insides.
Now he was panting, trying to get some of the icy air back into his lungs. He fell forward, and the black clad guard stepped forward, brandishing a stun baton.
Steve had really wanted to go slow, take time teasing. Maybe even make Tony beg for it. Make him cum over and over til it hurt.
Tony cried out and arched up, his hands shot up and covered Steve's mouth. Images of Steve in some humid jungle shack with his fingers buried in his own ass made him nearly swoon.
"You got a trail of blood a mile wide spreading out behind you too? You have nightmares about torture and wake up in the night remembering faces you can't even put names to?"
now he recalled Steve trying to cook for them after Sarah died. The way Steve could fix a hem and darn a sock. The way he looked when they sat on rooftops and talked about the future.
"What can I say, I'm weak man. I'm made of equal parts monkey brain, lizard brain and sex-with-steve-rogers brain." He spoke at a breakneck as Steve moved so he was inches from his face. "Laundry list. Character flaws. Did you get the dick pic too because I think it was some of my very
A low moan was drawn from Bucky.  "Fuck. Yes" he let his head fall back against the window. "I was."
"What's there to talk about?" He sidestepped a few times, trying to get closer to the meds. "Missing limbs? Kisses that never should have happened? Maybe you wanna talk about how you should have never went after me. Maybe, just maybe you wanna talk about Germany?"
Tony got to his feet excitedly and took his time. Cap had already relieved him of his shirt so he didn't have that to worry about.
Bucky was filled with waves of excitement at being hefted over Steve's shoulder. The sheer strength it took and Steve hadn't even really exerted himself. "Couldn't do
Bucky took his eyes off the man and stared up at the ceiling. "Kinda." His voice was tight. He reached out to Tony. "Panic. Help?" He could barely speak. In truth he was barely present, using voices like a lifeline.
His arms reached out and he desperately pulled himself close to Tony. His throat felt raw, like he'd been screaming. Had he?
Everything was so well manicured, even the tiny white stones that made up the path were perfectly placed. Not a single stone marred the plush green perfection of the lawn.
Going off on some self imposed mission to bury a 70 year old ache in him? That sounded more accurate than Steve was willing to admit.
The sounds Tony made were almost too much for Steve. Reedy, and eager. Definitely not sounds he had made for the unending string of girls that used to frequent Tony's bed. Maybe, Steve thought to himself, these were sounds only he heard.
Steve barely used the place. But it was as close to home as he had. Especially when he found out the old brownstone tenements he and Bucky had lived in had been demolished.
Howard smirked, raising his fingers which were slick and glistening from some kind of lubricant. "These old things?" He shook his head and pulled Steve's muscular thighs over his own. "I don't think so. I think you're ready." He purred, leaning up between Rogers' legs.
"Stevie" he moaned out, shifting his hips so that their dicks pressed together. Bucky's jeans felt far too tight, far too constricting, the way his cock was quickly hardening against the zipper. He'd have words with Tony later about modern fashion.
Steve nodded, if that was the way they had to be then that was the way.  He took one of those metal hands in his own and brought it to his lips. "Tony said you can feel these like real flesh?"
"I've had you a key made." Howard said as he hung up his coat. He tested one of the dumbbells but quickly put it back. "It's kind of going to waste I only come here to swim." He had a cocky grin as he crossed to a couch that looked utterly out of place. He Pat the cushion beside himself and waited for Steve to sit down.
In the past Tony had always had to remember to be the attentive one. It just felt so good to have someone give a shit.
Tony really was the very picture of need, he was flushed, trembling, his lips were kiss swollen and his cock was obviously straining against his jeans.
"No I got em. . . Peter's waiting to really meet you. So we should. . ." Tony offered the  sweats to Bucky and helped him stand and adjust them over the stump.
He began lightly working his hand over Steve and leaned in close to his ear so he could nip and kiss at it.
Steve leaned back a bit, sliding his hand up over Tony's abdomen then across his chest. He hated the way Tony still flinched when he touched the scar from the arc reactor. His fingers traced the circular indentation, the thick scars. Tony caught his hand, "Cap, no." He breathed, not meeting Steve's eye.
"Peter, I know you're not a kid. You're a friend though." Bucky's expression was grim. "I've experienced enough trauma lately without having to worry about this. Please let me tell Tony?"
Steve's eyes slid over Bucky's body, assessing everything. There was a three foot section of I-beam piercing through his left shoulder, crushing the metal arm. Steve was pretty sure the beam was buried deep into the ground as well. The arm itself was scattered in pieces everywhere.
"Tony, there's just a few things we gotta talk about." He rubbed his thumb over Tony's lower lip. "First, are you okay? I can tell you're not, so moving on. What can I do to help you?"
Steve lay back against Stark's headboard, one hand gripping back on the wrought iron it was made of. He had his other hand over his lips, though it did little to stifle the sounds he made.  The feeling of those invading digits was sending shockwaves of pleasure through him. His cock was twitching, slapping wetly against his abdomen, in rhythm with his pulse,  dripping so much precum it made a slick puddle.
He ordered food, had it all brought up and took his time setting the dining table. Everything was just so.
Both men cried out their release without restraining any sound they made. There were no subtle grunts from Steve, it was with a wanton, wavering moan that he filled the keening Tony Stark.
"Well, for starters," he began as he pulled the tail of Steve's shirt from where it was so neatly tucked into his slacks. "I got plenty of pals, but I don't look at a single one of em the way you look at Sargent Whats-his-name." His hands slid under both Steve's button-down and undershirt, fingers exploring the contours of his muscles.
Tony expected Bucky to leave, go hide in Bruce's lab but he followed Peter and Tony into Tony's workshop.
"You gonna come fuck me, Mr Rogers, or just soak your troubles away all day?" He said, trying and failing to sound cocky-- he just sounded breathless and needy.
Tony had his thin tank top pulled up to his chin. Slowly, he reached out and took Bucky's left hand and pressed it to the reactor scar. "This happened. It happened because of my arrogance and my complacency. I was a part of a system that was comfortable with zero accountability.
A former student of his, Baron von Strucker, had informed him about two new Sokovian individuals that had different peculiar abilities: one has the powers to move at the speed of light, and the other is both a telepath and a telekinetic. Surprised with the good news, he requested Strucker to continue to study their activities and behaviour so that they are prepared for his future experiments. He thought of going to Sokovia after this operation as their gifts kept him intrigued for a while.
“I’m fine,” Tony sniffed a bit, unaware of a tear track on his left cheek. “It’s just… I’m scared if something terrible happens to him, like what HYDRA did to you; except without the brainwashing but more torturing.”
A doctor approached him with a black paper-type folder presented to him. He got hold of the folder and opened it to reveal several old and new health evaluations and reports of Steve Rogers. He skimmed through every sheet of data, learning the soldier’s anatomy in detail, along with the effects provided by the serum.
Tony had been working in his lab for ten hours since dusk to invent a nanotech suit for him. He had done experimenting some chemical substances, calculating each probability and tinkering with mechanical equipment to build the suit. It is way more convenient and lighter than wearing the metal suit, he thought.
“Oh, James. Thank god.” She hugged Barnes tightly, and he returned the hug. Nat buried her face in the embrace, feeling grateful that he was back.
So much for evolving across generations when their main goal didn’t change a bit: world domination. Same old HYDRA with their ‘cut off one head, two shall replace’ motto. He wished he could sniff out any infiltrators back in the day and have them executed by the law.
"Tony?" A voice he wished to hear it again every day and at the same time to ignore the hell on the other end.
He looked back at the minute they were both fighting over a mystical sceptre that happened to create Vision. He recalled the time him and his boyfriend had their first date in a fancy restaurant after the battle of New York. He remembered the second they shared a bed and their first kiss at Clint's farmhouse (or safe house according to the archer). He recollected a fragment of a moment where he shoved harshly at the super soldier for not telling him the truth. The truth about his parents' death. He felt torn into pieces because apparently his boyfriend loved his relic best friend more than the billionaire himself.
He picked up the kidney promptly and lifted it into the air, visualizing the organ as a trophy cup. Satisfaction overfilled inside him as he was too stoked to resume dissecting the captain’s body and harvesting every organ. The surgery just secured his triumph and legacy within HYDRA. He would also become the supreme pioneer for this project. Many younglings will be inspired by his discovery, sparking off profound ideas to contribute to the innovation of Inhuman DNA. Herr Schmidt would be so proud of him, continuing his work for the sake of the organization.
Clint suggested they have a midnight snack before resuming their work. Bruce and Nat agreed while Tony was reluctant to accept the offer. At this point, every second counts and there was no time to procrastinate, although a cup of coffee might be useful to fuel him through the night. Steve might be on the verge of danger and he hoped his last resort was not to blast every HYDRA goon who kidnapped his husband until their skins burn.
“Whatever,” Bucky exhaled a sigh, probably fed up with the archer. “You two should come down here and help us with Steve.”
Steve stood on the quantum portal, both hands holding the stones and Mjolnir. Bruce gave a thumbs up and Steve was on his way to complete his mission, guided by the Time-Space GPS. His mind came up with an idea – live in the past and let his aged-self get back to the original timeline after returning the stones. The idea itself was tempting, considering that he knew Tony loved him since the beginning.
He stared jarringly at the soldier as he holstered the gun. This man seriously has some manic issues regarding a bad guy’s punishment for either doing a minor problem or a psychotic action. Tony stormed off from the scene and rushed towards the room. Steve was still unconscious and he needed some help.
“He’s a strong man, and so do you. And you know why?” Bucky prodded softly at his chest. “It’s because you love him, and he loves you too. I know that punk won’t give up defending himself from those goons because he always stands up for someone he loves: you. We just have to make sure Natalia can fly us there in a heartbeat.”
They remain in their intimate position for a while. Tony was savouring this moment while his fingers danced around the blonde’s hair, making spiral and wavy marks on it. He knew Steve didn’t mind because they were used to do this regularly in the mornings on their bedsheets, just before they took off for a warm shower. The memory still bouncing in his mind.
“Yeah, man. Cap is literally one of the reasons why I joined S.H.I.E.L.D. in the first place.” The archer stepped closer towards them. “I owe my whole life to him. If he’s dead-”
He clung himself closer to his lover while Bucky removed all the metal straps on Steve’s body. Hints of relief were then displayed on Steve’s face despite having to endure the burning twinge below his abdomen.
The next day, Steve was discharged from the hospital despite being instructed by the doctors and Tony. Hearing advices to rest from each person that he met made him having lots of wishful yearning, thinking that he wasn’t neither good nor perfect enough for everyone else, including Tony. Reflecting on that thought worried him of his future; probably destined to be alone the whole time.
“Don’t ever do that again, or I’ll ask Nat to kill you,” he shuddered while recalibrating his suit of armour and scanned for heat signatures in the HYDRA base.
“The room is not just your typical room to perform surgery,” Bucky continued with his explanation. “’twas also the place I got my mind erased and swapped countless times.”
“I went to the Smithsonian before sprinting here. There was an exhibition of Steve and your name was on it. They said you’re one of the three smartest men in the world, so I trust you to help me. Help me get this HYDRA programming out of my head.” He looked at Nat sadly. “I can’t trust my own mind right now.”
Gradually as time went by during the past nine hours, one by one left the room to have some shut-eye in a waiting room specifically provided by Helen herself. Bucky was the last person to leave and invited Tony to come and join them.
Nat flicked every switch on the panel and they were already levitating, getting ready to become airborne. Tony gave her an approving signal and she nodded, pushing down the thrusters, manoeuvring the Quinjet on course. He looked back to the jet’s front windscreen, thinking of their success in finding Steve. Deep down, he was certain he could bring Steve home, safe and sound.
Bucky briefly put into words the layout of the base and from what he can gather, the only potential spot regarding Steve’s whereabouts was the operation room.
She was right. Tony couldn't do anything to stop Steve from his trip. He didn't want Steve to get hurt. He didn't want to lose him again. Despite everything that they have went through, he wanted to fix his relationship with Steve.
“Give him more sedatives!” He shouted at them as the super-soldier started groaning in pain, realizing no anaesthetic drugs were injected into him.
“I thought we have established that,” he kissed him on his tender lips, wet with affection and desire. Despite a tube from the infusion pump was inserted through his right arm, Steve did his best to pull the genius close and deepened their kiss. It was perfect as they ached for each other so much. This was their first kiss since Steve left for the mission – their only comfort when they were apart was having late-night video calls. They broke off their kiss and Steve placed his head on Tony’s shoulder. “Love you too, silly head.”
Tony stretched out his right arm into the air, signalling JARVIS to initiate Grab-and-Blast Protocol. An Iron Man gauntlet – from the Mark XLII armour, his latest model – flew in his direction. It wrapped itself around Tony’s right hand with a hissing sound and he aimed the repulsor at the man. He also noticed Bruce getting behind him while Nat and Clint defending themselves with a gun and arrow respectively. How did they get their gear so fast and were they keeping their weapons underneath the couch this whole time?
Hope lingered in his head and he whispered some words of motivation to himself. He had to stay strong for himself. For Steve.
Tony fell to his knees, sobbing loudly. Pepper darted towards the sorrowful man and patted him on his shoulder. She was worried about Tony's current emotions.
Tony walked wobbly towards the source of the sound. Eventually his nerve cells weren't transmitting enough impulses throughout his body and his blood pressure increased due to the high alcohol level in his bloodstream, causing him to stumble and fall. His body was lying on the cold, hard floor, unable to move any of his limbs. He channeled his remaining energy and efforts in him to try and crawl and pick up the phone, but it was useless.
If you want to move on without me, it's your choice. But I know deep down in your heart you couldn't do so. I want you to live for me, to carry on our legacy, as a team and as partners.
“Ah ah ah.” He made a ‘no’ sign with his pointer finger, as an indication for him to shut up. “If you dare interrupt my upcoming storytelling to you, I will ask my assistant to jolt you again.”
“You’re going for therapy after we save my husband, make amends with the people you hurt before, and don’t tell Steve about this.”
Tony had got his second chance and he did roll the dice of risking losing himself or his family in the process. They were going to bring back everyone without leaving anyone behind. He was going to see his best friends back. He missed Bucky, Sam, T’Challa and the rest. Steve also had to make sure Tony made it back in one piece. He had to.
Fast forward to six decades, he was the only original member alive. He got to watch his friends dying peacefully, with each and one of them giving advices to him before their passing. Tears still ran down his wrinkled cheeks every time he attended a friend’s funeral even when he had a foot in the grave. Bucky was the last one to leave him, his only connection from childhood. His best friend got a happy ending for himself: marrying Sam after the both of them neutralized the threat caused by a group called the Flag Smashers. Every so often, their dynamic jogged his memories about Tony and himself. Even after all these years, he still missed him terribly.
“Since he mentioned your name like some kind of mantra,” he turned his focus on Bucky. “If you ever hurt her, an arrow will be shoved inside your ass.” The archer was overprotective with his best friend as their partnership bloomed since an assigned mission in Budapest.
“Pretty sure Mr Metal Arm here is afraid of some ghosts.” Clint patted Bucky’s shoulder jokingly as he noticed the man grimaced when he came close to an unfurnished tombstone.
Tony frowned, giving the director to request his driver to start moving. He wound up his window slowly and continued the chat.
He landed himself on the sidewalk and entered the five-story apartment with his regular clothes. The tracked signal led him to a studio room. Between Tony and the room was a wooden door with a 'do-not-disturb' sign on its doorknob. He approached the door and twisted the doorknob, ignoring the hanging warning. To his surprise, the door wasn't locked and he went inside the studio.
"Hey, it's gonna be okay," Rhodey reassured him with a smile. "If you need any help, I'll be there for you,"
The array of questions in his mind came to a halt when a tall, athletic man entered the room and walked towards him. Anger and disgust appeared on his face, his fingers curled into a ball of fist and without hesitation, the man whacked him on the belly. Steve groaned in pain, but the man continued to throw more punches on his body. What’s with the sudden torture on him while having zero knowledge about his whereabouts?
As the elevator dinged for the communal floor and its doors swooshes open, Thor grabbed him by his shoulder, his voice ringing out, announcing Steve’s arrival. He saw the rest of team were seated, their plates still loaded with food. Guilt began to develop for letting his friends wait for him. Tony offered a chair beside him and he took the opportunity to sit next to his crush. The six of them indulged in their dinner for the next couple of minutes and they talked a plethora of topics.
"Tony?" Pepper's voice rang in his head, his vision was cut off but was horrible enough to look back at it.
"I f-forgive you, Steve even though you broke my heart, literally and figuratively, and I'm sorry I couldn't say it to you sooner. I'm s-sorry I didn't p-pick up the phone. I didn't know you were suffering with all of this,"
Tony couldn't find those words to express what he was feeling at the moment. He was devastated. No way Steve was dead because he was the great Captain America. The man that he loved, the man who reconciled with him after the civil war via a relic phone was gone forever. Even so, Tony was still rejecting the fact that Steve was dead. He needed proof. He needed to go to London.
“We’re going into stealth mode to avoid being detected. Thor, you’ll be our big guns. Clint, you’re with me.” The two of them nodded.
Captain America was married to Iron Man. He remembered watching the vivid red and blue headlines of their dreamy wedding a year ago. Pondering upon their marriage reminded him of his late wife, who passed away a year before he was released from prison. He mourned her, but that doesn’t stop him from discovering wonders of the Inhumans and the ancient Obelisk.
“No!” All of them declared they would not let Barnes on the mission. It was too risky for a brainwashed survivor to follow around like a stray kitten.
"Besides, I'll be heading to New York with Nat and Sam because we have to settle some unfinished business with The Wrecking Crew there. I know that the Avengers who are with you right now won't be able to help us tomorrow since Director Ross had restricted your actions, but I'm here to tell you that we will be fine. I will be fine and you don't have to worry about me,"
One hour had passed and his operation almost came to an end. Whitehall didn’t care if the surgery would take a whole day; what matters is the end game. His own end game he had envisioned for a long time. It’s all about the high discipline that kept him moving forward with major discoveries, high enough to reward him with longevity and now, assimilating all kinds of Inhuman gifts, thanks to Captain Rogers’ contribution for his discovery.
The three of them shared their fellow feeling and compassion regarding Steve’s situation. He knew they meant well, yet he couldn’t shake the feeling that his fellow Avengers were acting like Steve was gone. Really gone. His heart was optimistic that his husband was still out there, fighting and defending himself from the abductors. If only he knew Steve’s current location.
Steve pumped him until he whimpered in pain and pulled away. He let Stark fall on his side, panting and flushed.
Tony was only half surprised when his own cock twitched in interest. One day, he made a mental note to himself, he would really have to test the theory of Cap getting him off with just his words. It seemed entirely plausible at present.
It took Bucky a long time to understand. To admit that maybe he did have something in common with Tony.
"Mr. Stark! Aunt May called and---- woah." Peter burst into the room and Tony jerked away from Bucky.
"Worse, it . . . I just let it happen, I knew it was happening and I let it." If the expression was any indication, Steve was more wounded than angry.
Bucky placed his hand on the one still on his chest. "I dropped some ham and I fell. Seems stupid but it made me think--- it made me feel like I was back, back there trying to get used to being limbless."
"Look, Stevie. You see this hand? You're holdin' it and I don't feel any pain. Anywhere. As long as you're holding it, this hand might as well be all that I am. I guess you never got that. You never got that I needed you maybe more that you needed me." He knew he was rambling, knew he should shut up. With a dismissive sigh he wrenched his hand free and laid it on his lap. "Go away Steve. I'm tired."
He groaned in pain, gritting his teeth, his memories threatened to steal him away again but he forced them down, he had to stay present.
This wasn't like him. This was weakness, it was , it . . . It wasn't The Winter Soldier. He sighed and rolled into his back.
He tried raising his right hand and the pain made him crash back into the present like a meteor. He heard more than actively participated in a harsh scream tearing from his throat.
"I did eventually though, Tony. Deep in the jungle in a dirty little shack. Fuck, I was aching for you." He grasped Tony's rigid prick languidly stroking it. "I started slow, like this." He purred then his hand left him. His fingers trailed down. "And then. . ." His fingertip pressed inside Tony, making him gasp at the hot friction. "I used
Thor turned back to Bucky and began unhooking various cords that monitored-- well, Bucky wasn't really sure what they monitored. "Come see what they've made for you. Help me argue."
Again Stark flashed him that triumphant smile. Howard Stark, the conqueror. "I'm going to eat you up like a 12 course meal, doll face."
"You know I was in love with him, right, Mrs Rogers?" He pressed his face harder into her skirt. "I loved your son."
Tony came down on him with a punch that would have likely knocked out someone who hadn't been conditioned like Bucky.
Bucky sighed and wrapped the skinny teen up in his arms, he made a very puppy-like sound and nestled himself into the embrace. "Thanks. I have enhanced senses and sometimes the world gets to be a little much. This I can focus on. It grounds me."
He grabbed Steve's hand and forced him to lean down and touch his flesh leg, taking firm note of the way Steve flinched at the feeling of his metal hand. "This is all that's left. The fingers that touched you? Gone. One back in the 40s. . . The other right in that goddamn kitchen, spread on the floor like jam by a steel girder. What am I Steve? What's going to be left?"
The pain. The first time the Soviets had tried the decrepit tech on him it was barely operational. It nearly killed him, he'd convulsed for ages and when he came to, he was put right back into it. He wa---
"Touché. Well, Buckaroo is free to have your little sit down." Tony spoke into the phone, ignoring Buck's sudden deer-in-the-headlights look.
"I. . ." He began, closed his mouth then started over. "I don't want to be something you two use to hurt one another. I.  I'll admit I enjoyed it too though."
Steve moaned deeply into Bucky's mouth and popped his hips. Buck finally let his head fall back, a breathless moan escaping.
God above it felt huge. Stark grinned, swatted Steve's hands and shook his head. "None of that now, not yet. Not until we've expended some of this energy." Howard stated with a grin. If the grip Steve had had on his hips were any indication of his strength-- well, Stark knew he was going to have ten finger-shaped bruises on his olive skin in the morning. "We have all night, after all."
The kiss didn't stay chaste for long. Steve saw to that with a swipe of his tongue, just between Bucky's closed lips. It was borderline electric and it made Bucky gasp. With that gasp Steve tilted his head, deepening the kiss, tongue slipping in with confidence. Steve didn't taste like did when they were young, but he'd gotten used to the taste of Captain America.
He closed the toilet lid and sat heavily on it. His hands reached out to turn the taps on full blast. When he figured them out he ran a bath of steaming water. A quick scan revealed there was indeed soap, shampoo, conditioner-- everything he needed.
"It feels like having my parents fighting." He breathed. "Also tell him about the leg, Bucky." Then he was gone and they were alone. Alone together for the first time since everything happened.
Bucky massaged the tense muscles and Peter let out a deep groan. "I'm --- I'm I guess hyper vig-vigilant. I'm always t-tensed for s-something--- oh god." His hand shot out and gripped Bucky's wrist. "Stop, stop." His breath was shaky as was the hand that held onto barely warmed Vibranium.
Bucky's cold metal hands came to rest on the burning wound. It was so soothing and the sound Peter made was practically obscene.  "Oh god Bucky that feels so good." He mewed, throwing his head back.
"Do you wanna maybe talk about it?" Peter nuzzled his face against Bucky's pec. He was as snuggly as a kid half his age. It kind of warmed Bucky's heart.
"Tony?" He asked, his throat dry, pulse racing, not daring to turn, not wanting to look into the light of the repulsor.
"I'm not blaming you for this, okay. Mistakes were made. For everybody. So shut up before I have to take my own anger out on someone." Tony took Bucky away from his suit and sat with him on the floor. His hand rubbed in firm circles on his chest.
There was no hesitation when Steve reached out and took the gleaming hand that hung slightly over the edge of the sofa.
"Don't give me that righteous, Dom-Top, Captain America voice when I feel like such shit." Tony flopped himself down and covered his head with one of Steve's pillows.
The finger slowly slid inside and Steve waited for Bucky's velvety hot insides to relax before he began to move it. He was surprised to find Bucky so open already.
His mouth went dry and he found himself groaning as well as Steve's squirming made his cock rub against his insides.
It was a half mile circular dirt running track ringing in a flat expanse of grass. There were bits of old paper confetti and a few streamers in the school's colors still lingering from the last event held there. Steve put his coat down on the bench beside the track and stretched for a few minutes before taking off around the track at a breakneck speed.
Tony was stunned into silence he turned around and exited the room. The whole thing was unbelievable. He couldn't stand in there a second longer.
"You know, I thought we were supposed to be fighting." Tony was his usual outwardly composed self as he listened to the mechanical whirring sound of his suit being torn away, joint by joint. "No?"
Steve laughed for the first time since it all happened. "I'm glad Tony built you with an actual personality."
"Then say it, Tony. Say; 'I want your cock, Captain.'" he ran his fingertips along one of Tony's inner thighs making the smaller man's eyelids flutter closed momentarily.
"Steve this all has to stop. This is the most unhealthy situation I've ever been in. Why didn't you just let him leave?"
"If I'm being honest with myself? Yeah. But I'm rarely honest with myself so. . . Yeah it's one of my laundry list of character flaws." Tony's hand lightly touched Bucky's hip his eyes searched the other man's.
should go talk to Snow White in the morning. Now hear me out! I'll come with a peace offering." He briefly raised the hand up the put it down. "A slice of pizza and we're all friends. agreed? Good."
"Right there." Thor nodded again, stepping back. "Banner! You must repair the broken one!" He exclaimed.
"Goddamnit, why do you have to be right?" He adjusted himself so he wasn't straining so hard against the unrelenting metal of his zipper. "Thanks though. I guess."
"If I was I wouldn't have bawled my eyes out to the rest of The Commandos after you fell. I wouldn't have told them everything. All the unsaid things. Hydra took everything from me."
"Listen, I know I'm a dish, doll face. But quit staring and eat your breakfast." The device in his hands began to ring and Howard triumphantly placed it back on the night stand. What had looked so complicated to Steve was just an alarm clock.
Rogers groaned and pushed aside his plate. His appetite was gone, replaced by a knot of despair and regret. He was coming to the realization that he was emotionally clueless if not just plain stupid.
"Well it's kind of hard to listen when you're doing the things you do with your hands." There was laughter in Steve's voice and it stabbed at Bucky's heart. He pushed down the negative emotions. Be good, Barnes, be good. Now he wondered what task or activity the couple had planned that would likely take Tony away for the rest of the day.
He let the techs and security team do their job unloading. . . Unloading the box, staying out of their way. When they went to the service elevator however, Steve followed them up. They didn't even have to say anything or touch any buttons, it was like the elevator knew where they needed to go.
Steve turned his hand palm up and Bucky lightly settled his hand on Steve's. Steve squeezed his unyielding metal fingers. These would have to do. These would have to be the fingers that Steve loved if this could be resolved.
His entire body tensed when Stark pressed up against him from behind. His hands slid around Steve, feeling his sculpted abs through the thin button-down he wore.
The elevator doors opened on Steve's apartment. There was now more of Tony's stuff there than Steve's own.
He found that he loved the way Howard's mustache slightly tickled and the way his teeth felt against his skin.
"Thanks Friday." There was a crunching sound as Tony picked his way through the "small" apartment. He finally spotted Bucky laying between the kitchen island and the half open fridge.
He did a lot of that lately. Pouring over old books. The phrasing, the vernacular the settings made him feel at ease.
Tony tuned out most of the conversation as it turned into the intricacies of the ever evolving New York City and all its Burroughs.
Maybe he could let Steve see that now, let Steve see the toll. Maybe he didn't have to be alone when it was bad. When it was worse than a simple panic attack someone could talk him through. When it was a mixture of rage and grief and the utter crushing weight of what was lost and what he'd take. When it was enough to make him nearly suck-start a pistol on more than one occasion.
What had he gotten himself into? He tried a fifth time to reach up and touch the comm in his ear, but the pain in his right arm was white hot, searing through him worse than the shit Zola had injected him with.
Bucky threw his head back and let out an exasperated groan. He wasn't even going to fuck with it. It could lay there for all he cared.
Howard jumped practically out of his skin when Steve pulled him up out of the water and laid him on his chest. Steve wrapped his arms around Howard's waist, burying his face in his neck.  His lips gently kissed bruised flesh.
Tony stayed there, tongue lightly probing, circling the flesh. He opened him up like that, with just his tongue. Bucky practically
"No. No this is . . . This is done. Don't touch me any more, Stark." He held his hands up in front of himself. "I'm not a toy. I'm tired of being a toy. I'm. . . I'm leaving." He retreated into the bedroom and came out a moment later with an old olive green backpack. It looked like it had been packed for ages.
His tongue circled the puckered rim of Tony's entrance, pressing lightly now and again, just barely entering him.
"I'll leave the details to you!" Bucky cut him off, looking a little pale. "I trust you and Dr. Banner."
"You wanna talk about things? I mean really talk? Not us blaming each other or taking blame to placate our feelings, really talk." He picked his way around all the long strands of hair that littered the floor.
How long would he be gone? Should he have confronted Steve? Of course he should have. This was their
It was like electricity to Steve, he groaned and resisted trying to push back inside those pretty lips.
Thor regarded Tony solemnly and nodded. Bucky allowed himself to be lifted again and taken back to bed.
Howard met Steve with equal enthusiasm. His tongue danced over Steve's, over the roof of his mouth. Steve learned quickly and returned all the motions.
"Christ, Pete, next time speak up." He took Peter by the shoulders and guided him off the car. " Good thing most of us aren't parents, we'd be shit at it."
Steve tossed his phone down and groaned in frustration. Well, he'd made his decision. He couldn't back out now. He pulled himself from bed and began to gather his things.
"I'm not complaining, have you seen your ass in these?" Steve wasted no time or care for gentility in ripping the jeans down Bucky's legs. Of course there was no room for underwear under those skin tight things.
"You saved me in so many ways Steve. I just don't think you understand or give yourself credit " Bucky slowly sat up, starting to feel uncomfortable with the fluids drying on him. "Come on, let's take a shower."
The gold faceplate shifted away, revealing Tony's face. "Just making a little welfare check." Tony stated looking only at Peter. "All good bud?" He put a fatherly hand on his shoulder.
"You're going to go there and give me the show of a lifetime. You and Bucky." He leaned in and licked the shell of Tony's ear.
Bucky slid his hands up Peter's thigh. "Why are your muscles so tense, Pete? You're knotted up as hell."
"No, Tony. He's just an affectionate kid. Tactile as hell, just like you, just like me. You know this. Hell, he's fully clothed, even has his shoes still on!" He reached out with those gleaming hands and pulled Tony in close. "He practically feels like my own kid, Tony."
He'd repeatedly shit on what he and Bucky had. Bucky went out with girls but it was a defensive mechanism, how he remained stealth back then. Steve was only just understanding that.
Peter was also curled up on the seat, though the major difference was that his head was on Tony's knee while Tony carded his fingers through his hair.
God only knew how many miles he'd run before he stopped, barely out of breath, just a bit sweaty and overall content.
He couldn't linger on the thought however because Steve wasted no time pushing his knees to his chest, holding him practically upside down. "Cap-- Cap what're you doing, ahhh- h--hahhh fuck." His question turned into a hoarse moan as Steve's tongue entered him. When had Captain Great Depression learned this? And aside from just learning it, when had he gotten GOOD at it?
When he finally came it was likely the most intense orgasm he'd ever had. He practically screamed out his release ("oh my god! Fuck! Tony!") his vision blinked out as a thick flood if milky white cum splashed slick and sticky over the abdomen of the man leaning against him.
Bruce nodded at him. "So that's where we are, if anyone has any bright ideas, I'd sure love hearing em."
The first fact became pressing when Steve added a finger into the mix. "Steve I'm gonna! I'm . . . Ah fuck! Steve I'm gonna cum!" He warned and Steve moved back before he could indeed cum.
"Front lines my boy." He snapped the case closed. Steve felt an acute pang of jealousy.  "As a civilian pilot. Should I say anything to Sargent Whats-his-name if I see him?"
Tony's Olive toned fingers slid lightly over the contours of Bucky's ass. Bucky shivered, goosebumps appearing on his skin. His fingers lightly slid between the cleft of his cheeks and over his hole. "Tony?" Bucky groaned in question.
"I don't have to let you do this you know." He's speaking a little too fast now, especially since he can now feel the crisp German air on his neck.
"I know. That's the plan." He pushed Steve hard, away from himself then made a run for the elevator.
"Tony. Goddamnit. This whole thing isn't fair to me. I can tell you're not this worked up on your own. You look half fucked already. I need to kn---mmhh!"
A gutted sound escaped Bucky's throat. That memory had escaped him til just now. Little Steve holding his hands and warming them while the guy shivered his ass off himself. The memory was vivid and seemed to unleash a flood of other tiny things. He remembered a lot of things but they were mostly in wide swaths devoid of detail. Only a bit of the minutia was vivid.
It was Steve's turn to hang his head. "We've never gone through something like this, Buck. It used to be us against the world, not us against us."
"Yeah, remind me to complain." Bucky bit back a moan as the button went flying in lieu of being undone.
His fingers grazed Steve's left nipple. Stark stilled, gauging Steve's reaction. "The main tell, though, is;" he whispered when Steve didn't budge, when he felt the dusty pink flesh of Steve's nipple hardening under his fingertip. "You haven't broken my nose and ran out the door yet."
Tony gave him some aspirin and a glass of water. "He'll live" Tony announced. He had scanned the wound with a little handheld device. Bucky watched over his shoulder it was like a tiny x-ray but Bucky knew it to be one of Friday's scans.
Steve's fingers laced into the hair at the back of Tony's head. "You can pull that you know." Tony purred.
Howard took the initiative and parted his lips, licking between Steve's, begging entrance. He relished in the way he could feel those full, sensual lips shaking as they too parted. Howard wasted no time in chasing Steve's tongue with his own.
He lay back, panting and feeling utterly spent. Steve hadn't came so hard in recent memory. He noted, embarrassed, that some of his own cum was all the way on his chin.
The army had put him up in a tiny apartment until they could figure out what to do with him--a one-off from a project that would never be as planned.
"Come eat, dearest." Steve had that commanding in-the-bedroom-only tone in his voice. The tone that made Tony weak in the knees.
"Selfish? I don't know. What I do know is there an endlessly frustrating boneheaded asshole down stairs who has basically pulled himself apart at the seams over you.
"Whatever you wan-- whatever you need, Cap." For the first time since the parking garage, Tony leaned over and pecked Steve's lips then went back to his phone. It offered little comfort to Steve.
Bucky's metal hands laced into Steve's hair, keeping him there. Bucky was the one to turn the kiss filthy this time, his tongue sliding into Steve's mouth with eagerness. He could taste himself on Steve's lips, it made his cock twitch.
"Thank you Steve." Bucky breathed. Bucky's body was aching at a cellular level for the man standing before him. He longed for the way things were, the comfort of being close to him, the reassurance he felt when Steve would ground him with a simple touch.
He paused long enough to take a piece of paper from the old sketchbook he hadn't touched in years and write a note for Tony in neat, old fashioned cursive.
"No, Bucky..let me finish. I said things, things to hurt you. Specifically to hurt you. I went dirty I went low. I hurt you." Tony inched his chair closer. "You might have killed my parents. But you had to watch yourself do all those things from the inside with no way of stopping it . . . I was wrong. I know better. I know
Steve must have made some kind of sound because Tony's head snapped up to look at him. "Jesus Steve, sorry. Bruce, grab Cap a chair."
He coughed a bit and Bruce rubbed his back. "Slowly." He encouraged and offered the straw to Bucky again.
"Same reason you couldn't. Think about it Steve." Bucky was on his feet now, having silently risen. He crossed to Steve's side of the table and ran his hands, cold and heavy back through Steve's hair. "I'm sure our emotions have been mirrored since we were twelve."
There were things Bucky was slowly coming to terms with. The exact extent and perverse nature of the abuse he'd endured, for one. The least horrible was the man he was currently clinging to.
Bucky nodded and Tony smiled "12:45! Friday, get him where he needs to be in the morning!" His tone was excited.
"I couldn't find the right time. I couldn't find the words. And, and you know what it was like back then for guys like us." Steve moved to kneel down beside them. "My heart is broken about him."
"I think you'll make it, soldier." There was a tightness in Steve's voice under all that well practised calm, that optimism. Bucky had heard it on the battlefield, when Cap had been comforting a man who had a hole blown clean through him, no hope.
"Give me another finger" Howard tensed then forced himself to relax, he didn't know how Steve was going to go about it, gently or haphazardly like the amateur he was.
Steve groaned as he bottomed out, his slicked up cock buried as deep as he could get it. "Oh sweet Jesus, Bucky." He panted above him. Steve's arms were shaking as he held himself up with them.  To steady himself and give Bucky a chance to adjust and relax, Steve leaned in and kissed him.
He found he really didn't much like the attention, though he used to always envy Bucky for grabbing it.
Steve did, suddenly yearning for the feeling of hot water on his skin. He felt sticky regardless of Howard's hot towel last night.
"Good boy. Now, do you think you need your pants either? You don't need pants to have dinner, right?"
It burned, but it was a nice, for Howard, he was already feeling so full. "More" he gasped out, though his body didn't really feel ready. This was good, this was release for Stark.
"What the hell is it with you and these Stark men?" Bucky hissed, venomously. "I get it, I mean they're cocky, brash and charming-- rich to boot but come on Steve!"
"Okay now, Bucky, you wanna try moving your fingers?" His fingers? He moved the ones on his right hand.
"Rogers?" He began, almost startling Steve from his thoughts. "Kiss me? Like it meant something, what we just did?"
Tony let his other shoe fall from where he'd tucked it under his arm. "You, didn't do what I think he's insinuating, did you?"
"Do you know how long it took me to find a private place to jack off?" He leaned in mouthing over Tony's neck, nipping his ear.
He wrapped his arms around Steve's neck, locking them in place. The limbs were heavy but he knew Steve could take it. "Steve." He moaned out when they finally parted for breath. All the attention had gone directly to his cock which was pressed, half hard against Steve's muscular thigh.
Steve gasped out that he was close and he came, arching off the bed, coating both his own abdomen and Howard's hand. He fell back panting raggedly. "Jesus, Mary and Joseph." Steve breathed. Howard just chuckled and brought his hand to his lips and cleaned it off with his tongue. Steve's cum tasted a little strange, a bit sweet.
"Right, so, with nothing to autopilot, it overheated your entire body. We got rid of it though, so that's nothing to worry about. Tell me, could you feel that damn thing?"
Peter sighed and went into detail about bank robbers and bullets and skipped entirely over whoever his "friend" was.
"Stevie!" He heard himself exclaim in a hushed tone. "I can't believe I let you talk me into this." His teeth were grit together.
Bucky's body felt a little warm,  he felt almost like if he were drinking and was right between the edge of sober and tipsy.
He could pick it up if he wanted to. Couldn't he? Damnit. He reached down and snatched it off the floor, overbalanced himself and ended up on his ass in the floor.
told me about Howard, to hurt me. He used it against me. I wasn't even important enough to you for you to keep it in your pants after I got my papers; after I was fighting the
"I'd never have come to you if I didn't think you wanted it, Barnes!" He pushed him again and Bucky caught his hands.
Steve fucked him through it, his hand finally wrapping around Bucky's cock and milking him for all he had.
The list was thankfully short, a few papers to sign, one quick lunch with Pepper and a visit from Peter Parker. Oh. And Bucky. He had to check the arm out. Well, Petey could come for that. It'd be entertaining and educational for the kid and besides, he decided he liked seeing how much Bucky struggled understanding the strange and unusual guests of the tower. His reaction to Thor had been delightful, just wait til he met Spiderman up close and out of the suit.
He threaded his hands in Tony's hair, pulling back a bit from the wall so that he could tilt Stark's head back, giving him full access to his mouth.
"Its gone. M-my leg." He gripped the sheets in his one hand. "I can't feel anything. My whole left side,  I can't--!" He shut himself up when he felt his chest tighten again.
He shouldn't have brought the kid along. Peter could handle himself pretty well on the streets of Queens but out in the field like this with other. . . Enhanced individuals, no it was too soon.
"You weren't listening when I talked to you?" Tony sounded exasperated though he was grinning like mad.
After a few minutes of this Steve groaned, digging his nails into his hairline. "Tony you're being so quiet and it's. . ." There was a time Steve would have said peaceful but, now it was unnerving, worrying, "it's scaring me." He said, unable to keep the edge from his voice.
Then there was Tony. He was filling in the gaps. Putting substance to the weakest spots. Making him do things that pushed his limits. TV for one, and food.
"How, how, how'd you manage this?" Tony stammered, seeking out a towel for the other man. Why in hell was his heart pounding? He was supposed to be harboring some kind of vague resentment toward this man.
She began to gently card her fingers through his hair. "What's on your mind, James?" She asked in that soothing voice she usually reserved for either him when he'd taken Steve's lumps in some back alley and she was cleaning him up or when Steve had an asthma attack.
His brain cycled through the words finally deciphering English through the horrible buzzing pain in his head.
Steve allowed Tony to pull him into the waiting car. When Tony climbed in beside him Steve took his hand in a death grip.
He rolled onto his side, looking over Steve and giving him a vague smile. "I want to bury my cock in you, Steve Rogers."
"We used to fight sometimes. He wouldn't really yell back at me and then he would end up going out to find some back alley thug to pick a fight with." Bucky was still pale as though teetering on the edge of vomiting again. "You never met the Steve I grew up with. Five foot nothin' ninety five pounds. But he was a damn fireball. I got him out of more scrapes than I can count but he . . . He saved me in a lot of ways. Listen at me yammering like an old hen."
Bucky gasped for breath, trying to get his bearings again. "I don't speak no fuckin kraut." He spat.
He hesitated, fingers hovering just above the surface of his phone. Was this the thing to do? Was it going to cause more damage?
Slowly, he crawled to Cap, letting his head drop to the other man's lap. He let his cheek brush over the bulge in his pajama pants, then his mouth ghosted over the plush material, lingering over the spot soaked in precum.
The hot, slick feeling of Tony's tongue slid along his shoulder, up his neck and lips closed lightly on his earlobe.
He felt his nose crack and blood starting to pour. "I don't understand." He stared into the glowing blue eyes of Ironman.
Pass after pass over the area turned up nothing. He breathed a sigh of relief when he saw Cap running through the debris.
"Hm. You're right." Howard agreed as he leaned over and truly gave Steve some of that mouth. Stark's lips wrapped around the tip of Steve's prick and he wasted no time bobbing his head along the length.
Howard didn't have to worry because it was the feeling of all that filling him up coupled with the hard twitches of Howard's cock inside the finally sent him over the edge.
Steve pulled his fingers back and let his palm rest on his rear. "What's wrong?" Steve cooed so soothingly it made Howard feel off kilter. The hand on his ass began gently rubbing up and down his back again.
After a few minutes, the flip phone went silent and tears lingered in Tony's eyes as he stared at the ceiling.
“Well, for starters, Nat had provided intel on why HYDRA did that horrible thing to you,” he noticed Steve’s face scrunched as he mentioned HYDRA. “I suppose you know about it.”
“Tony! H- help me- e, Tony,” the captain whimpered. “It- it hurts… so m- much.” He went quiet after a surgeon rushed to inject the sedative, dose after dose until he was under sedation.
Tony sat beside Steve who was lying on a hospital bed. Eyes closed. Disheveled hair. His body had cuts. Sharon was right about Steve; he did try to hurt himself because he couldn't forgive himself for hurting Tony.
Steve was still staring with fond eyes at the man who just saved New York from an unauthorized missile launch. He realized that maybe this man is the one he should be together in the future. He realized that he was indeed in love with Tony Stark.
” Tony countered Bruce’s reply. Nat then gave a loud cough for the both of them to pay attention to her.
“Now, I’m going to tell you about me.” He stated and they were heading towards a place Steve assumed to be another section of this HYDRA lair. “Back in 1989, there was a young woman who had amazing powers. She looked so young that her gifts were similar to one of the super-soldier serum’s abilities: longevity. As a matter of fact, I had met her back in the ’40s, the day I found out the Red Skull was dead because of you. The woman appeared to be ageing at a slow-moving rate.
Perhaps, the data Nat would collect later on might have the answer on all things about the Nazi-based organization. Right now, he should concentrate on saving his beloved blonde captain.
Bruce looked at him with a sad smile and placed his hand on Steve’s shoulder. “I know you blame yourself for what happened to Tony, but he made his choice. He knew the risks better than all of us when he wore the gauntlet to save us. To save you, especially.”
He knew the consequences of his actions when he refused to sign the Accords, but he didn’t expect another of his failed plans to be foiled: the outcome for keeping the truth about Tony’s parents. It was too late for him. Turns out, Zemo had knowledge about the death of Howard and Maria Stark and he used this information to tear him and Tony apart as an act of revenge for the destruction of Sokovia. Tony looked devastated and in anguish, probably the first time he saw the man been in a condition like this. He tried to reason Tony but there was no use; the trust and compassion between them shattered and broke into a million pieces. The fight between them was pointless; Steve ordered Tony to stand down but they continued to take up arms. He should’ve known – nobody would listen to him or negotiate with him when his mind was too stubborn to face the truth. Even Tony.
Tony stretched out his arm, offering a truce to the Winter Soldier. Confused and thankful, Bucky reached out and took his hand. They shook hands, feeling the mutual agreement. He noticed tears lingered in Bucky’s eyes, and maybe he felt the same way. Forgiving him was his final closure to make peace with his past.
It’s been nine hours since the incision-closing procedure and Tony still sits on his chair next to the hospital bed. Nine full hours he had spent scrolling his phone, drinking coffee and wandering around the medium-sized white room. The one thing he constantly does was watching his husband breathing in his deep sleep and monitoring his heart rate.
“But there is one more problem.” Whitehall brought a chair and sat next to his board. “The idea of merging my longevity and other Inhuman gifts might be crucially fatal due to its differences in their DNA bases. Normal people would have purines and pyrimidines as their pillar for a nucleotide, but Inhumans have an unknown extra base in their nucleic acid structure and this type of base varies from one Inhuman to another. When fusing both Inhuman DNAs together, it might cause the double helix structure to be dense, thus hindering genetic information to pass through and ends up with DNA fracture and severe agglutination.”
Tony started to sob. He began to think that it was his fault for not picking up the phone. He imagined what Steve was going through without Iron Man by his side, always haunted by his mistakes towards Tony every day.
Whitehall chuckled again. “Oh, you will be dead in a couple of hours. The cutting-you-open process is the one that’s going to take us some time. The organ extraction would be straightforward.”
Thor beamed widely and squeezed each and every one of his friends, except for Bucky. Tony gave him a brief explanation about the Winter Soldier and how he got here. The Asgardian understood their situation and nodded.
Pepper noticed the sad looks on Tony's face and she understood it all too well. He needs a lot of time to get over Steve, she thought. She decided to walk away and let Tony to have some room and space to prepare himself.
He didn’t realize his heartbeat raced swiftly until he heard rapid beeps from the ECG machine and Tony was mumbling words he couldn’t quite hear properly. Maybe the genius was comforting him to rest. And he did.
“You knew him?” The three men asked her in unison, confused with the sudden acknowledgement by the man in front of them. Nat ignored their questions and continued to stare at Barnes.
He's not going to take revenge on Bucky. Doing so won’t bring back his dead mom. The past had left him and he had moved on. This guy didn’t deserve it too; Bucky was coerced into doing a lot of worst things in his life, only for his memories to be wiped off every single damned mission, just like a robot. He didn’t even get to grow old and live his life. This was Bucky’s second chance to live normally and find his true identity. And Tony’s going to be the man to help him.
Tony became distressed. His mind was telling him to track the last known location of Steve's phone while his body was giving him hints to rest more. He opted to follow his guts.
“Hey, it’s not your fault for what happened to my parents. You absolutely deserve my forgiveness. Just remember a few things.”
“Okay, Tony,” the man smiled, hiding a combination of pain and weariness. The only thing he could do right now was to be there for him.
One by one, the captain’s clothes were stripped off excluding his shorts. He then rubbed a chlorhexidine antiseptic on the patient’s lower abdomen. After applying, a sterile drape was covered over the body and a medium-sized hole was cut around the operating site area. Two doctors aided to clip the drapes at every vertex of the operating table; they were ready for the experimental procedure.
"Actually, I do. Your captain failed to protect the Infinity Stone and gave the extra-terrestrials a chance to annihilate our world,"
Next, he dissected the aponeurosis of the external oblique precisely, leading to the transection of the internal oblique and transversal muscles. More interior vessels were found along the way – all have been cut carefully and blocked using more surgical sutures. He couldn’t risk an occurrence of internal bleeding in the body as it might result in organ failure, which was hypothetically less effective for his future results.
“For your information, I will begin the procedure right after this and I will start with the organ that hurts you the least: your kidneys,” he approached towards his upper body, pointing his finger at his renal area. “The doctors will sedate you again to keep your body from moving and no, I won’t inject painkillers in your body. Consider this a retribution for going against HYDRA, but your body will serve us well, Captain Rogers.”
Of course, he once had a family, but it wasn’t the same. Even when his father was never there for him, he had his mother, Jarvis and Ana. Too bad his mom and ‘dad’ died too soon in an accident in 1991, while Jarvis and his wife grew out of age, years before he was kidnapped in the middle of the desert.
“Who’s Bobbi? Clint’s girlfriend?” Bruce handed him his cup of coffee and Tony immediately took a sip.
He wished Tony was here to end his misery. The misfortune of being kidnapped unconscious by HYDRA. The torment he was going through at the moment.
“Yup.” Tony emphasized the letter ‘p’ with a pop. “If anyone wants to wreak vengeance on HYDRA for messing up their brains for decades, it’s you.”
"I-I know you are still mad at me, Tony... but you have the right to do so and I'm deeply sorry and apologize for everything I had ever done to you," Steve's voice began to break. "M-maybe I was taking you for granted and you deserved someone else worthy than me,"
Nat stood up and opened her mouth. “From what I’ve gathered recently, we can confirm that HYDRA took Steve hostage based on an unknown footage by the river.” She took out her tablet and played the video to them. The video displayed two men in HYDRA uniforms lifting the super-soldier’s body onto a stretcher and left the river bay through the thick woods. “I couldn’t trace their trail as they managed to hide their footsteps in thin air.”
Maybe he should wait for his husband before strolling further, even if it takes a thousand years. Tony gave him love and a home, and he was not gonna let him go and leave.
"Thank you, Nat. It means a lot to me, especially now that he is gone forever," Tony shed his tears. "We didn't have our proper goodbyes,"
Fortunately, from what he could deduct, Steve would live for the next couple of hours if the incision site had been sutured and sealed. He may be one of the smartest men in the entire world, but he wasn’t specialized in biology although he knew the basic fundamentals of the particular study. There’s only one person that could help him at the moment.
“Really, you can do that? Wait, of course you can.” Both of them chuckled. He might start to have a liking for Bucky. “Thank you, Stark.”
He was proud with his latest project although it was already six in the morning. If only Steve was here with him to witness his newest suit. He could still hear and imagine the soldier's sweetest compliments for him and his rants about Tony not getting enough sleep. If and only if he was here.
“Give me one reason why are you here before I blow you to bits.” He warned while his gauntlet began to charge up.
Hauer clutched onto the board’s handle and pushed it along with the super-soldier, who was still strapped to the panel. Whitehall followed shortly and when he was in Steve’s sights, he brought along another assistant. From what he could observe, the assistant was holding a foot-long baton prod in his right grip. Steve became doubtful with the rod, fearful of what it can do to him. Possibly to cane him, he thought.
In a flash, he noticed an old picture frame on the coffee table. He picked it up and inspected the photograph closely. The picture made Tony grinned happily and sadly at the same time.
He rushed to the bed and flopped next to his husband, giving him a warm embrace with his head landing on Steve’s pecs. Steve returned the hug tightly and laced his legs together with Tony’s legs, and they remain in the cuddle for a long while. He whimpered and his tears fell on Steve’s gown, creating multiple soaked spots on it.
“You’re asking me if I’m okay? Huh.” He scoffed, clearly irked with Steve’s ‘putting-others-first-before-himself’ trait. “The real question in the room is are
Within thirty minutes, the whole team caught sight of Helen walking towards them with a tablet in her grip, eyes full of relief. She announced Steve was safe and that’s all that took for Tony to let out tears of joy. He didn’t listen to her further explanations as he was deep in his thoughts. His Steve was alive and well.
Tony was about to reminisce deeper when he touched a metal surface at the back of the picture frame. He flipped the photograph and found the flip phone. He activated the gadget, investigating on what went wrong during the time he tried to call Steve back. The phone's SIM card was broken.
They arrived in front of a locked bunker-style door. Hauer unlocked the door and revealed a room he always avoided stepping foot in. An operating room. There were six people in the room, all of them wearing white scrubs and face masks; probably doctors and surgeons. He felt anxious about HYDRA’s upcoming plan on him and didn’t like it, one bit.
“Hauer, you can stop.” The Hauer guy ended his throw of punches and stepped aside for the German-accented voice echoing across the room to come forward. Somehow, he recognized this voice. Despite that, why would he hear a voice that brought him memories of the 1940s? “Captain Rogers, it’s a pleasure to meet you again, although I’m not sure if you remember me.”
"I hope you can accept my apologies, Steve as much as I have forgiven you. I love you," Tony got up from his seat and placed his lips on Steve's forehead. He wanted to make sure that Steve had his last kiss with him.
As the car left, he began to wonder what Steve was doing at the moment, considering after defeating the Wrecking Crew. Was he hurt? Nope, Steve will be fine, he thought and brushed off his overthinking skills and went to the kitchen. But, deep down in his heart, he wanted Steve to come back.
His heart fluttered and he blushed at those words and planted a soft kiss on Steve’s lips, cherishing this moment – Steve was rescued and safe, and that’s all that matters.
He was aware that Iron Man would search for his missing husband right now, but he doesn’t have to worry about the so-called billionaire; he straight away ordered all of his men, including the doctors and surgeons, to barricade their hideout and keep an eye out for any Avenger or S.H.I.E.L.D agent present around the building.
After a few minutes of complete silence, Bucky voiced out. His voice started roughly as he regained some memories, but it was still coherent to the human ear.
He noticed the remorse look on the Winter Soldier’s face. For the man, it must’ve been tough to come to terms with his own trauma alongside the shame for what he had become in the past decades. He vowed to eliminate every brainwashed spoor in Bucky’s mind straight after they have completed this mission. The government and some agencies might be on his tail if they ever found out Tony was keeping the former ex-assassin in his tower, let alone his brain was messed up a couple of times. But mostly, he knew Bucky is an esteemed man ever since the sudden encounter at the tower (and some old textbooks), and the team are going to help prove his innocence, according to the law, of course.
At first Bucky fought the urge to reciprocate, his mind working hard to catch up with Tony's actions. Soon though he'd melted against him. He parted his lips and pressed eagerly into the kiss.
"What was I dreaming?" He wondered if he should be honest, tell the kid the horrendous things he saw every time he closed his eyes.
Steve's breath hitched and his heart started racing when those intruding hands slid lower. At first he thought Stark was going for the gusto but instead of grabbing him, they slid to his thighs, and back up.
"I'm tired Stevie. How many pieces of me are gonna be missing before you let me go?" He bit his lower lip, looking up at Steve, trying not to see the skinny kid he grew up with as his shoulders shook with silent sobs.
Steve hesitantly slid his hand along Howard's flank, he pulled the man closer and pressed his lips to Stark's a bit more firmly.
In his waking life, Bucky was arching off the ground screaming. It did nothing but further injure him.
"We're fighting. Remember?" With that Steve pushed Tony down to his knees with one hand. The other fumbled to free his aching cock. Tony eyed the impressive length as it sprang free.
"I love you too, Cap." Tony just lay there looking at the way the light played on Steve's eyelashes, the way his lips parted slightly when he slept. That beard was hot, scratchy on his skin but incredibly hot.
"Please, Cap, j-just do it already." Tony practically begged. "I need you."  He gazed up at the other, parting his legs just slightly.
Bucky spat blood on the cream coloured carpet. "c'mon, are you still little Stevie Rogers from Brooklyn or are you Captain America?" He gave a little mock salute.
"Then that was barely a Tony Stark strength dose. C'mon Cap." He pulled Steve to his feet and guided him toward the elevator.
"James~" the voice came again, soothing away the fear before he even registered it. The voice lead him to a tiny bedroom. He was confused at not finding anyone inside.
In spite of Tony behaving like a sheer and total brat, Steve found no resistance when he actually tried pushing into Stark's mouth. In fact he received a moan for his efforts. After a few shallow thrusts into Tony's mouth, the smaller man pulled away. "If I'm doing this I'm doing it right. Let me." He blurted out before Steve could silence him again.
"You want him. Don't you?" Tony couldn't deny that but this all felt a little off. Like he was going to be messing with Bucky's feelings. He was at least 97% sure Bucky had most told him that he loved him earlier.
When he could finally breathe Bucky stammered; "Steve something doesn't feel right. I can't. I can't
"Steve I want you. I want you so bad I can feel it in my bones." His voice was a deep whisper as he locked Steve in his gaze.
Out of curiosity, Tony leaned in and licked across the tight ring of muscle. The sound Bucky made was the most obscene thing Tony had ever heard--- and he'd heard Captain America call him a cum loving whore.
"And you never told him?" Tony was looking at Bucky's eyes, pulling the lids up seeing the way his pupils were blown.
"I could fall for a fella like you." He said in his usual cocky, jovial tone. With a soft chuckle he leaned back in to take Steve into his mouth.
He was softly moaning Tony's name. Oh fuck he was close. "Fuh- fuck" he was panting out. How long had it been since he came?
During the war he'd come close enough to death numerous times. When Steve had shown up to save him this time, he'd been ready to confess everything.
"Language." Steve purred, sliding his hand over the jawline of the suit. There was a slight hiss as he pulled the faceplate free. "We're not talking about Howard, are we."
"Your clothes and the gymnasium key are on the bed, Jarvis is waiting out front with a car." He said not turning so much as to look at Steve.
"You're trying to pull yourself away from your work for me. I'm flattered but I'm fine." Steve stated reassuringly, free hand coming up to rub firm circles over the small of Tony's back. "I'll go read or something, maybe watch some TV. I'll let you know when the food gets here."
"Yeah. Yeah. . . I read the museum piece, I watched interviews and documentaries. Poor broken hearted Steve Rogers. Lost his best friend. Just a sickly kid from Brooklyn who lost it all, a man out of time." He ran his hands back through his ass-length hair.
"Jesus Pete!" Tony exclaimed. "What, what's this about aunt hottie?" He pinched the bridge of his nose.
He let the man go, realizing his grip on his wrist was a crushingly tight one. "I can't even feel half of my goddamn dick, Steve."
A pair of Tony's autonomous suits came up in the elevator. One pulled Bucky away and the other took Steve, separating them.
Steve retreated, heartbeat sounding in his ears. He made his way to Howard's bedroom sure enough his clothes were neatly folded with a shiny key on a Stark Industries keyring laying on top.
"What are you thinking about, Stevie?" Bucky asked, pulling Steve from his thoughts. One shining metal fingertip was tracing patterns over Steve's stomach.
Steve's fingers curled into his hair and pulled him forward. Tony braced himself on Steve's thighs. "I try not to put GMOs in my mouth, Cap, I really--"
Muscles rippled and thighs quivered. Howard found himself practically hypnotized by this contradiction of manner and physical appearance.
"Bringing work home with you?" Steve asked, sitting down too though a good distance away so as not to disturb anything.
He slid his hand to Tony's neck, lacing his fingers into the back of his hair. The pad of Steve's thumb moved in a soothing circle just under the man's jaw.
. He reached up, snapped the chin strap and forcibly pulled the helmet from Steve's head. He threw it aside and tried to not feel anything when he heard Cap's head cracked back on the concrete a bit.
He was still for all intents and purposes, a young man and he had no sense of identity no sense of purpose and no grasp on the future.
"So, we've been skirting the subject," Tony began, easily skirting yet another. "I kissed you. We cool?"
Bucky jolted up practically screaming something in Russian, followed by "W-what who's ... Who's here?"
"Hhah! Oh Jesus I'm gonna--!" Bucky gasped out seconds before ruining Tony's shirt with his cum. He'd told Tony to take it off even if this was just a quickie in the literal broom closet.
"Wanna see if we can get me drunk?" He looked at Tony from the corner of his eye. The man's reputation for debauchery, public drunkenness and just drunkenness in general exceeded even Howard's.
He chanced to look over at Tony who still stood in the doorway. His eyes were narrowed and he had a vicious set to his mouth. "What. The. Fuck! Is going on here?!" Tony demanded again fists clenching at his sides.
Again I must apologize with my inconsistency in posting. I've got a lot on my mind with the state of the world.
"How many more times am I going to wake up like this? I'm not a science project. I'm not a lab rat. How am I supposed to live like this. It's no better than Hydra. I get comfortable, I let myself trust everyone here. And. . ." He held up his gleaming right hand, the metal ended just above his elbow. "how is this different from what they did? I'm really not going to be a person soon, Tony!"
Bucky didn't meet Steve's eyes. "This how you wage a war, Stevie? Huh. Hitler didn't stand a chance." He said with a mirthless laugh
Tony wasn't sure how many times Steve had made him cum by the time Steve let him lay down, exhausted and sticky.
Steve wanted to put his hand on Bucky but he couldn't find a spot that wouldn't cause the man pain. "Shh, shh, Bucky, I know that now. It wasn't safe for us back then, how many people got sent away or killed for being a fairy? It's okay. Don't try to talk, help is coming. Stay with me."
Steve's cock hadn't changed much, sure it was a little bigger bit Steve had always had a cock to be proud of. Now Bucky was practically salivating for want of it. He was absolutely gagging for it.
"There's lots of things I'd like to tell your dick." Steve growled as he lifted Bucky up by his hips. Jesus, he was heavy now with the weight of the metal limbs. It was practically like picking Tony up in the full suit.
"But you know, Steve, that's kinda what I do. I ruin things." He turned on his heel and walked back the in the direction he'd last seen Sam.
"I set him up in an apartment. One of the good ones with the bathroom bigger than the living room." Tony was clinging to him now. "Cap something. . . I didn't tell you. He I uh. . . Fuck this is difficult to say."
"I was worried and lonely. Mr Stark said I was forbidden. That's a dramatic word huh, Bucky? Plus, well, it's not important. . ." Those big eyes welled up but Peter was good at blinking the tears all away.
"Pete. Don't let anyone use you. Promise me." His voice was shaky but at least he was not crying any longer.
He arched up as Steve kissed up his right thigh and placed a hard bite to the skin just beside his neglected cock. His neglected cock which twitched hard, slapping wetly on the puddle of pre it was currently leaking onto his abdomen.
"I'll help you with anything you need, Buck." He stated with the self same conviction that Steve gave to justice and goodness and righteousness.
They both cried out their release simultaneously. Thick spurt after thick spurt of cum filled Stark. He rocked back on him, milking him until the last tremors of release subsided.
Tony cried out, arching as he was enveloped in the slick heat of Bucky's mouth. "O-oh fucking Christ!" He gasped out, hands flying to Bucky's hair.
Sun streaming through the windows greeted Steve as he opened his eyes. He didn't recall falling asleep. When he realized he wasn't in his tiny apartment he jolted up.
He opened his phone to that picture. Tony with his lip between his teeth, cock standing proudly dominating most of the screen.
"A good or bad kinda on your mind?" Tony leaned up on his elbow, a playful smile on his face. He looked like a gossiping girl at a sleepover.
Steve smirked, "you want to cum for me is all I'm hearing." He settled in behind Tony, leaned in and placed a light bite on one of his pert cheeks.
At the next moan from Stark the kiss turned more urgent, a flurry of teeth on lips, and battling tongues.
The short sleeve button down Bucky wore was suddenly minus all the buttons in his haste to follow Steve's order to remove it.
When they parted Bucky was flushed and panting. He'd never kissed a man other than Stevie. "You . . . You taste like coconut." He gasped out.
Tony's eyes flew wide and he searched Peter's body for blood, a wound, anything. Panic gripped at his chest. "What did---
Steve was honestly at a loss for words. All the things that Bucky said-- they were incredibly difficult to hear.
He let his eyes wander here too. Old, thin mattress on a squeaky frame. A pile of couch cushions lay beside it, blankets tangled together. The windows were tightly closed in here, they had to be right?
He gripped the front of Steve's uniform, bunching the material up in his fists. "Maybe I'll go the rest of my life worrying that you were just seeking out those little bits of me that mirror him--"
No future they ever dreamed up was as strange as the one they lived in. And God, Bucky wished he could go back in time and really live out a life. Go back and not become the Winter Soldier. Not become a weapon, a cold blooded killer.
He was in a familiar place though he couldn't quite pinpoint it. The late afternoon sun filtered through windows he was sure he'd never seen open before. Everything was bathed in a golden glow, turning the relative shabbiness of the place into a delight to his eyes. The breeze gently lifted the thin white curtains catching them, twisting them into gentle ghosts that curled an invitation.
"Tony, it was a --" mistake? No it didn't feel like that. "I should have talked to you about it. I should have been more considerate to both of you."  He reached out and took the mug away before Tony burned himself on the coffee.
There was some kind of relief in this for Tony. Some surrender in the pain. "More, Captain." He found himself pleading. "I can take it."
Tony had Bucky's left leg across his lap and had the maintenance panels open. He was diligently working in miniscule bits and pieces.
It had been a couple of weeks and Tony hadn't mentioned their kiss again and that was all for the best.
Howard laughed and lit up another cigarette. "That bad huh?" He flipped the file closed and put it back where he'd gotten it.
Bruce Banner looked up from his notes only long enough to wave Tony and Steve into his lab. It had been a week and they were only just letting Steve up there.
Bucky's hips thrust up into Tony's hand. The sensation was different than his own hand. The section of numbness he had felt more acute and strange when it wasn't his own hand.
Shrapnel riddled Bucky's body, especially the left side, probably shards of the arm--- turned into a claymore by the I-beam--- for the most part. His left leg was entirely missing from just above the knee, torn, ragged and freely bleeding. Steve didn't see the limb anywhere. The hardest part to look at was the right arm. He'd obviously taken a splash of the fuel to that arm, the resulting fire had burnt the flesh and muscle right down to the bone. Instead of charred and crisp it looked wet, sticky like it had melted more so than burnt. A shard of metal, probably part of the fuel tank was wedged between the bones of his forearm, splitting it all the way down his hand, which was barely hanging together in two sections.
Bucky chuckled and ruffled Peter's hair. "Only for really good reasons." He assured. "Listen Pete, you're a good kid and everyone has your best interests at heart."
Tony raised to his hands and knees. "Full disclosure, I think I could cum from you just talking dirty. Lawful good asshole."
Steve bit his lip, hand tightening on the wrought iron curlicues of Stark's headboard. The metal creaked in protest and bent slightly.
"Tell me about your first time, Stevie." He purred over a rigid nipple before teasing it with his teeth.
Thor easily maneuvered through the lab, coming to stop before a mostly equipment-free metal table. He placed Bucky on this table in a sitting position then hopped up beside him.
"There you are, James." She smiled too but there was none of the deep lines of care there that he remembered. She looked fresh and healthy, vibrant. She wore her nurse's uniform, little hat and all.
He found it easy once he was conscious of it. With a soft whirr he spread his fingers out, he was surprised to feel the texture of the blanket beneath his fingertips. He looked up at Bruce in alarm. "Is it supposed to feel like that?" He asked in a hushed tone.
Stark grinned. Sensitive ears eh? He knelt up, leaning against Steve, letting the fingertips of his opposite hand ghost little patterns over his pecs. His tongue meanwhile delicately traced the shell of Steve's ear. He made the smallest, most delicious sound.
"Out. Of. My. Way, Rogers." Bucky made to push past him. He was feeling trapped. He knew he was going to have an attack of some kind but he had to wait. Wait til he was outside, some desolate alley or parking lot. Then he could break down. Not here.
It was a very tight fit. God it burned but it likewise felt so SO good. Bucky couldn't believe this was finally happening. He pushed his ass back on Tony even though the man kept chiding him about patience.
He'd just finished up rinsing the conditioner from his hair when he heard someone knocking on the door of his room.
dirty little secret. God help the nation if it ever got out that Captain America ran around with a prancing, fairy faggo--"
When at last they pulled up to the Stark Mansion he was the first to hop out, thankful to be on stationary ground again. "Your house eh?" He queried as Howard joined him again.
This was the longest, most stable relationship he'd ever been in. He could make compromises, couldn't he?
Bucky smiled sadly at him and pulled him under his arm. "It's okay, kid." He stated even though he felt anything but okay.
Steve started to open his mouth but Tony seemed to know exactly what he was going to say and cut him off with a:
He leaned forward, dropping his head into his hands. What did surprise him was Tony's hand coming to rest on his back, rubbing slow, firm circles on Steve's knotted muscles.
"But you are letting me" Steve Rogers ripped another section of the Iron Man suit away, dropping it unceremoniously on the concrete floor of the parking garage they were in.
"Tony I need to tell you something." Bucky called after him but Tony waved him off, his mind kicking into work mode.
There was a deep, cold, hollow feeling in the pit of Steve's stomach when the loading doors of the jet opened. He was vaguely aware of Tony squeezing his hand.
"I don't remember mine either." The kids sad, small voice broke Bucky's heart. "Did you have any brothers or sisters?"
"It's just you and me here, Steve." He spoke barely above a whisper, stepping closer. "I'm usually discreet enough especially when I'm sure I'm barking up the wrong tree."
"Sorry, Cap. We just got caught up. . . Didn't mean anything by it." Tony reached out with both hands and massages Steve's temples. "We'll make sure he's fine."
Two long months in deep cover somewhere in the South Pacific. They'd busted a human trafficking ring wide open. It was good work, work that needed doing. But
Steve had just peeled himself out of his Captain America uniform when he'd called Tony. He really wanted a shower and to attend to the still healing cut across his jaw. Time was short though, and Bucky was a higher priority than his washing off the grime of battle. He settled into a pair of loose sweats and an old tee. It had his shield printed on it. A fan had given it to him at a public appearance and he thought it was both humorous and a bit touching.
"Maybe with the pants." Bucky was getting used to pushing his pride down and at that present moment those sweatpants seemed insurmountable.
There was a dull ache in his chest, near the reactor scar. He absently rubbed it and let the feeling of missing Steve wash over him.
He could faintly hear Steve when Tony answered. "Doll? I'm free for whatever you were talking about last night."
"Stay with me Bucky." Her voice commingled with something else but he ignored it. He just let the feeling of her gently rubbing his hair comfort him.
He let out an exasperated sigh and pressed the heels of his palms to his eyes til he saw stars. He missed Tony. He missed the way the man would curl into him at what ever hour of the night he decided to sleep. He missed his smell and he missed his banter.
"I know. He's with Peter, they've gone to Coney Island of all places." Tony rolled his eyes but he was smiling.
"Well, first of all, you sound like a bad 1930's cartoon when you talk like that. And secondly, just for teasing me, I'm not helping you with the rest of the suit. So that's a thing." He tried to look as cocky as he managed sounding. It didn't work, he looked as vulnerable and nervous as ever.
He watched as Tony's eyes widened, his mouth worked wordlessly. Steve was satisfied to have rendered one of the world's most talkative men entirely speechless.
When Steve experimentally popped his hips a burst of pain flooded Howard's senses. He moaned raggedly, arching forward, resting his head on the cool porcelain of the sink. "Like that" he breathed.
He raised his ass to slip out of the sweats and used just his arms to swing himself over to the edge of the tub.
"You didn't know it had already started did you? The shit Hydra did to me? The first doses of their shitty replica serum. The torture?"
"Harder, Cap." Tony gasped out a moan when those teeth sank down on his flesh. "O-oh! Mhh Steve." He moaned prettily.
"Don't say that Bucky. Stay with me, you'll be okay." Steve cupped his chin, finding it mostly free of wounds. "Please."
Peter kept asking questions, since there was nobody there to tell him to back off for once. Well nobody but Bucky and he was always indulgent.
Tony's heart raced his cock hardened so fast it left him dizzy. Captain America talking dirty, what a weakness to have.
"Why me?" Tony said in a small broken voice, the rage seeming to leave him slowly, leaving him feeling hollow.
Tony didn't turn to face him. "You had a world class freakout. You thought HYDRA was here, after you. You kept telling me to run, that you'd fight them. Do you remember?"
Steve leaned down and gripped Bucky's chin, tilting his head back. Tears were still streaming down Steve's face.
Steve recognized the panic attack as soon as it began. He rushed to take Bucky's bandaged right hand, sitting in the chair Bruce had just vacated.
He scooted down in the water til he was laying on the bottom of the tub, looking up at the ceiling, rippling through the water. He hadn't relaxed like this in months. Years? Not since he'd fought Bucky on the Helicarrier.
"I can't believe you're so big." Bucky groaned out when he trusted his voice to not be a high pitched whine.
His thoughts didn't race so much here. He just focused on his breathing and the ground he was covering. All he could hear was wind in his ears and his own steady pulse.
He felt himself inching closer to Bucky and quickly pulled back. He just missed Steve, that was all, right? Tony was also a very tactile man, always touching his friends lightly, in some manner. Leaning against them in cars, holding their hands.
"It's a cruel twist of fate that we never told each other before we died isn't it, pal?" When Steve opened his eyes it was to that smile he'd never get used to, the one that didn't meet Bucky's eyes, the one that looked more like an expression of sorrow than one of joy.
He hadn't quite gotten the hang of text etiquette but he was getting there. He was just about to pull himself from bed when his phone dinged.
When he was able to move inside with ease, Cap drew back til just the tip remained inside, he angled his hips a bit gave Tony a series of hard, shallow thrusts, that made the smaller man practically scream.
After a slightly uncomfortable silence Tony asked. "Should we not have done that? I mean I enjoyed it."
Howard laughed, the sound was vague and distant. "You don't want to know all that." He stated offhandedly as he turned off the tap and stepped into the tub. "Coming?"
"I'm sorry!" Was the first thing he gasped. "I love you and I'm sorry for being an asshole!" What a strange way to apologize, while cumming. Tony had no reservations about filling Bucky's ass. He did it with a sharp cry.
Sam sat to Steve's left, going through his iPod trying to select a song that he hadn't listened to a thousand times already on that trip.
Steve slowly let the weight of his hips push his dick deeper. The tight ring of muscle that encircled him seemed to spasm in protest.
It was startling really that he found himself suddenly realizing that he'd not seen himself fully naked since before the accident. He looked skinny that was sure, he's lost some muscle tone but not bad otherwise. His left side was scarred horribly, it had to be massive injury for him to scar after the serum.
Bucky lightly kissed Tony. "We need to stop having misunderstandings like this. Kinda kills the romance when we're fighting." He laughed and Tony let him pull him in for a deeper kiss.
Again Tony felt searing lips on his skin this time kissing and biting a trail from neck to chest. He arched up, moaning when Steve's teeth caught his nipple. He was glad they were down on the concrete now, his legs felt like jelly.
Steve briefly claimed his mouth then pulled back, stopping the stream of words pouring from Tony "Oh, I got the goddamn photo. Fuck. You're a whore for me aren't you?"
Howard just chuckled and fumbled getting a ring of keys from his pocket. They were standing in front of a fuck-me red Mercedes-Benz 540k special roadster. Steve let out an appreciative whistle. Of course Stark would be driving something this ostentatious during wartime.
"Licking duck sauce off my nipples doesn't count as stopping exactly." He let himself fully relax against Steve. "You did tire me out though." He hummed pleasantly.
