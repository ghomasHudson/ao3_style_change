“So… how bad is it?” Sam spoke up, Steve leaning on the driver side door. “Beside Wade being an ass” his face tight, “Not sure what to do with this mess” he looked to Odin.
Tony laughed, "One: didn’t think you’d know something like that."
Clothes were tossed all over the room. Steve may have tripped trying to get his pants off. Tony laughed and yelped as Steve jumped him. He rolled Steve on his back. Straddling his hips.
“Wade, what the hell was that?” Steve growled out.
Thor closed the shop down. Loki retire home early, complaining of a headache, the cause of the Asgardian’s busybodies.
Tony grounded himself down, earning a groan from both. His hand kept stroking Steve. And his other hand felt the vibration of Steve growling. Steve sat up, arms wrapped around Tony, as he moved them up the bed, hand at the bedside drawer. He pulled out lube and handed it to Tony. He gave him a look, “You never know.” Steve answered.
Moving closer, Frigga came to the base of the tree. Tony took notice how the roots spread out long and deep in the ground.
Tony could understand. Bruce still looked the same to him from middle school. Damn, who would have thought. “Is that what you guys do?”
The door swung opened. And Tony skid to a stop as he almost collided into Wade. Oh, the kid that started all this. He frowned, Wade just brighten from seeing Tony.
Tony moved off him. Almost tripping, another arm curled around his waist, held him—at the same time electrifying him. He looks up to see Steve was holding him. He frowned and took another gulp of his water, one thing at a time.
But Tony looked happy and spoke a mile a minute that even Bruce was trying to keep up. Just like that they both learned something about Tony. He was a genius, and it excited him in what Bruce could reveal about Asgard. Tony even helped Bruce in a dilemma he was having. And Steve was proud of his mate.
“We travel, work and choose to live among mortals.” Steve spoke. “And we don’t age fast. So, sometimes you just have to fake a death or disappear.” He stated.
Tony stood daze.
“Tony?”
“Tension?” his tone terse.
Maybe he should consider getting a dog after all this.
Bucky just smiled.
“Wait,” Tony stopped and let go, Bruce felt instant relief, “You’re dead.” Tony frowned.
Steve stopped. Tony looked down at him. “You, go home.”
Tony and Steve burst out laughing.
Tony rubbed his hairless face. He was going to consider growing a beard now. “Shut up,” he growled out to his laughing friends.
He heard laughter from none other than Wade. Once noticing the blond, he felt a pull, a little gentle this time, from Steve. Guess he noticed too, as he watched Steve’s jaw clench, most likely grinding his teeth.
The older man waved back, with a grin on his face, he patted the older woman hand.
And Tony gave the place a scan. It was made mostly out of logs and stones. The living space was decent, cozy. It held a stone chimney that Clint had started up last night, to keep the place warm.
Steve shifts, his hand motioning to, “Tony, this is Bruce Banner. Bruce, Tony Stark.”
Rhodey sighed and smiled at his friend. Shaking his head, "Are you worried that I will drop you because you're dating a guy?" He let out a chuckle, "Don't think that way Tones. You're my best friend. I love you and will always be here for you."
“Oh,” Tony gave a tone of amazement. “And tell me your daddy a Shifter, right?” she nodded.
Wade shoulders slumped, defeated, “I screwed up,” he admitted.
Rhodey and Clint were out back, they’ve both engineered a temporary grill.
They strolled through the field. And funny enough, it was fun. Even with Steve.
“I can’t,” she moved to Tony. She cups a hand to her lips, whispering to them her big secret, “I’m not a shifter.” That shocked Tony.
Wade eyes was intensely fixated to the door Anthony had gone through. Thor hand was on his shoulder restraining him. Thor eyes fell to Loki, they have much to talk about. “Thor mind the shop, boys” Jared and, reluctantly, Wade looked to him, “Make sure you take your grandfather home.” With that he left them.
Tony moved his head side-to-side, “Eh, not so bad, just—weird” he finished with that.
“Thank you,” Sam lips quirked. “Anything you need to know, I’m here to provide the answer.” At that a falcon landed on his shoulder. “She such a big kid.” Tony didn’t have to ask; he knew it was Rebecca.
“Y-yea, everyone is watching us” he squeaked, hating his tone.
Steve’s hand held Tony head to him, his other hand gripped his waist. He let out a groan as Tony, who smiled against his lips, grasped him in his hand.
Smiling, “How are you, my love?” they weren’t alone. He could feel their boys’ eyes roll.
As I write this fic, I just want those to know that I try hard to be sensitive to a lot of things. I do hope I have not offended anyone. If I have, it's not my intention- it's hard to describe where I'm going with this but I'm just flowing with my creation. As I continue to write this... I was thinking to myself that it is probably going to get weird, but I guess we'll get to that sooner or later.
At least there was not so much spit on this. But the same pounding hearts could be felt.
He stepped out, thankfully this wasn’t a Children of the Corn scene, since he saw no corn stacks or ginger kid. You wouldn’t even consider it a farm. It was more like a botanist wet dream. It was an intricate garden, flowers, oak trees and herbs all around, but a nice path to get through it. He felt like Dorothy, follow the yellow brick road Tony. Minus Toto.
They both stood watching Sam daughter, yes, the goddess was Sam pride and joy, playing with the children. They were attached to her and Frigga. They sparked this feeling of love and safety.
He turned his attention to Steve. Since it was him who did the job, “Thanks,” looking at blue eyes was a mistake. He felt a shiver run up his spine, his eyes looked predatory, or were they? And Damn! What is exactly up with this whole situation? He wasn’t even touching him. The air was thick. And Clint coughed obnoxiously. Thank god for Clint! Breaking their eye contact.
Tony didn’t even wait for Steve to park, he rushed out. And always Steve was—just there. He stopped at the second step and turned to face Steve. He was close, always quick—shapeshifter thing? He’s not exactly human anyway.
She blew a raspberry at him. “Steven Grant Rogers.” He cringed. “This is a date. And Tony, your mate, deserves the whole nine yards.” Bucky gave a nod, agreeing. “You’re courting my pup,” she said as she tapped his nose. “Funny, I could have sworn I was older than you.” Steve countered. She huffed a laugh. “Yes true, but you’re acting like a pup.” With that she gathered her stuff, gave Steve one last look, “Now, have a wonderful date. Do not screw it up or I’ll shave you bald.” She threatened and left her two idiots to themselves.
Rhodey found Steve to be a down-to-earth guy. But around Tony was a—mess.
And Tony discovered that he enjoyed being carried away like this. He won’t admit that out loud though.
to Rhodey. “The man does have a daughter. Practice.” Rhodey smiled.
“A person.”
“Mate,” he whispered against Tony’s skin.
Sam chuckled, “No, he definitely male. Loki was Thor mate. It happens sometimes that your true mate may not be your kind. And they usually decide at that point. Loki wanted to be with Thor in the end and he went through a conversion. You’re not sure what you get in the end of a mortal going through conversion. It’s a hard process for them and some may refuse it, or their mates can’t let them go through it. Thor was okay with them never having children, he luck out,” Sam smiled.
“Know him Bucky?”
“I’ll arrange your travel accommodations.” Pepper began typing into her Starkpad.
He thought about getting out-of-town. But he couldn’t leave his friends and he also doubts he’ll get too far if he even tried. But he could try?
Steve was looking ahead, with a small smile, "Ah! To uncover my character tragic background, you’ve got to go out to dinner with me."
In some ways Tony was blessed to have friends like these. Clint was an easy-going guy, looks serious but not at all. And when he considered you a friend, not to mention his wife and the kids loves him, he felt like a family member and so it had gifted Tony with another overprotective friend.
“There he is! The Sheriff is back. Watch out Thor,” he smirked.
“Hm, yes. It was passed through a family, generations” Odin rasped.
Steve shut the door and motioned to his couch, “Take a seat or whatever.” He shrugged his jacket off and Tony did the same handing his jacket to him.
Clint searched the kitchen for a vase, he waves the flowers gently at Rhodey, as that would answer his questions. Rhodey gave him a lost look.
Though he should find another way to handle this, if he was going to win Tony. And he sure as hell will win his mate.
Standing abruptly, tossing the stylus onto a random work table, Tony walked to the back area of the lab where he had his cars, one of them, a ’67 Ford Mustang needing worked on. This would be the perfect distraction, nothing Captain America related whatsoever.
“Why don’t you make yourself useful and start up a pot of coffee,” Natasha scolded, glaring at the man until he hurdled to his feet and got to work prepping the coffee.
Taking a deep breath and placing his hands on his hips, Tony looked around at the outcome of his inventive streak, smiling at his work. There was a section of the rooftop that he furnished with an outdoors lounge bed, throw blankets and pillows, along with a small area for a refreshment bar. Faux candles lit the space in an ethereal glow, while strewn white lights nestled within a mesh netting hung over the lounge bed. And to top that all off, all Tony had to do was a press a button, and the lounge area could be completely sectioned off from view.
“Thank you, so very much,” Steve said, his voice less pained. “My, I must sound like a repetitive tune,” Steve lamented, shaking his head. “I feel like I am rather a burden to you and-”
The formula and algorithm were giving Tony grief as he tampered with it and picked at his brain, and it was evening by the time Tony had his fourth diagnostic running, hoping this would finally be the magic number, literally.
Tony was losing himself in the moment, Steve’s moans and sultry breaths a beautiful echo in his ears. He wasn’t able to keep it together much longer though, especially with Steve clenching so tightly around him. He bit at Steve’s shoulder as he refrained with every inch of control he had to not come yet. He was keening loudly though, his voice mixing with Steve’s own sounds as he reached a hand down to take hold of the blonde’s thick, heavy length. “Steve,” Tony bit out, breathing raggedly. He eyed the ravaged man, whose eyes were glazed over with lust as he watched them move as one body. “Steve, touch your chest while I stroke you,” Tony huffed, swirling his hips as he fucked the man, searching for his prostate.
“S-Steve,” Tony moaned out, gritting his teeth as he tried to reign himself in. The super soldier looked up at him then, slowly slipping Tony’s finger out of his mouth, his ruby lips glistening.
A gentle snow fell over Avengers Tower in the middle of December. The interior of the space was decorated with all the festive trimmings. Garland hung in thick green strands, and mistletoe was nestled over random doorways. And the Avengers team gathered around an enormous Christmas tree in the communal area, passing around a basket with each individual’s name inside it. The team had agreed on exchanging gifts as Secret Santas, and when the basket reached Steve, he eagerly stuck his hand inside, shuffling the papers around before plucking up one of the folded pieces. He couldn’t help but to chuckle lightly when he saw Tony’s name on the paper he picked. Quickly he put the paper in his pocket as the cogs in his mind turned, trying to figure out a gift idea for his boyfriend; he had already bought a few gifts for the genius.
“Steve,” Tony said softly, eyeing up the drawing. Steve smiled and looked at his art piece as well. “It’s beautiful, thank you,” Tony added, turning to place a sweet kiss to his love’s cheek. “We deserve a vacation like this. Wouldn’t you say?” The brunette asked, taking the drawing and carefully pinning it right in the middle of a corkboard he used for random design sketches and blue prints.
“Shit, you’re-uhn so hot,” Tony groaned out, resorting to pulling his boxers down around his upper thighs to lazily caress his cock. The agony of his swollen, purply length was getting to be too much, and if Steve wasn’t fully prepped soon, Tony didn’t know if he’d last much longer.
“Still, I’m not gonna lie, Steve. You having an exhibition streak in you was something I did not expect.”
Steve opened the door to Tony’s room only to see a large, dark brown wicker basket sitting upon the man’s bed. The blonde rushed over to it excitedly, almost tripping over his own feet. Sitting on the enormous and plush bed, Steve put all the goodies that were in his hands into the basket before he explored what else was nestled inside. There were a few chocolate bunnies, some extra jelly beans and foil covered eggs, as well as a bottle of what looked like thick brown paint. That wasn’t all though. Tony had put green plastic hay in the basket, and when Steve moved it aside, he revealed a rolled up garment, gently tied with a silk blue ribbon. He knew it wasn’t any regular article of clothing though; it was lingerie. Steve noticed a piece of thick cream colored paper underneath the ribbon, carefully removing it and reading what Tony had written inside.
Steve’s phone chirped beside him as he added a few more strokes to the canvas. He had been painting a small still life, something simple as he tested the waters of the new art medium. Steve checked his phone then, seeing a text from Tony, asking him what he wanted to eat for their date night in. Steve had a craving for Italian, and so he let his boyfriend know, as well as tell him he’d be back to the Tower soon.
They had spent the day together, Tony taking Steve out to his favorite restaurant in New York, followed by taking a private tour of one of the many museums peppering The City That Never Sleeps. So now it was Steve’s turn to surprise Tony, who was waiting in their bedroom while Steve cleaned himself up a little after being out and about.
Turning to face the mirror then, Steve was overwhelmed with emotion, feeling so beautiful and so loved in that moment. Tony made him feel as if he was something precious, a treasure. And Steve would never understand how he had gotten so blessed to have Tony as his beloved.
“We’ll take care of it,” Obadiah cut him off. “Now go get yourself cleaned up.” The older man stormed away, and the brunette inventor was ushered down to the lower level. Before his vision of the deck was skewed though, Tony turned, looked over his shoulder and thought he saw Obadiah remove his revolver from its holster around his hips as he strode toward the merman.
“Come here,” Tony said, pulling Steve on top of him and kissing him ravenously, his tongue licking Steve’s own as he cradled the blonde’s jaw in his hands. The blonde loved how his silk teddy slid against Tony’s chest and belly when they pressed together. Steve fought for dominance, his tongue slipping inside his lover’s mouth, tasting his teeth and the warm flesh of Tony’s inner cheek. Everything about the man was absolutely delicious.
“Anyways, thank you, Bruce,” The genius said with gratitude, holding up his hand and smiling before exiting the room. Tony felt a sense of uneasiness about so many things. This Hydra Company, Obie, the merman... Tony needed to make sure everything was all right and so he set off to find Obadiah to clarify everything.
“Eh, it slips out every once and a while,” Tony said staring out the window while Steve drove. “It’s like you forget that the letter ‘R’ exists sometimes."
“Mmmm,” Steve purred, the brunette already getting an idea of what his boyfriend was going to be doing momentarily.
When he spoke to Steve, his voice was kind and his pearly smile comforted the merman, giving Steve the confidence to trust him as the brunette cut away the ropes and tried to help Steve into the sea. Even when he was escorted away, leaving Steve alone with the seemingly ruthless crew members, Steve could see the kind man did not want to leave Steve, and was worried for him.
Where Natasha's hand was, on the blonde's shoulder, a warmth began to gently pulse. Steve paid it no mind as he finally continued on in their museum visit.
“Hey, handsome,” Steve greeted, taking off his gloves, coat and scarf before giving Tony a peck on the cheek.
“Now, you just let me clean you all up,” Steve said with a wink, wiggling down Tony’s body. He pressed a kiss to Tony’s hip before he began lapping at his own come that littered the brunette’s abdomen. It was a little weird, eating his own seed up. But knowing that it would bring Tony pleasure watching him do it made him eager to keep going. He slid his tongue up the man’s body like a dog lapping at water, looking up at Tony while doing so.
“Alright, give me an hour and I’ll be there,” Tony said, his eyes never leaving Steve’s lovely blue ones. He felt the super soldier’s hands on the waistline of his boxers, slowly dipping underneath to grab at Tony’s bum. It was his turn to hitch a breath, biting his lip to not let out a sound.
“Tony,” Steve breathed, eyes squeezed shut as restrained himself from climaxing right then and there.
“Hey, it’s cool. I’m not judging, just surprised is all.”
“Gotta make up for lost time,” the super soldier agreed, giggling lightly. Tony cradled Steve’s cheek in his hand, fingers drifting over his chiseled bone structure. The brunette traced his thumb along that puffy, kiss bitten bottom lip of his lover’s, the ruby skin warm to the touch. Steve made a quiet noise of content, his eyelids half closed. As his love caressed his lip, Steve couldn’t help but dart his tongue out, licking at Tony’s thumb just a bit.
“Having you here with me,” Steve confessed, looking at the genius through his lashes. Romantic feelings aside, Steve truly cherished their time together. He wanted Tony to know that all of it was perfect, and that he had done more than enough for Steve. Even when it came to friendships, the brunette needed to be reminded that he was indeed good enough. Steve understood why though, not only did Tony have high expectations for himself, but so did the world.
“What?” Tony asked quietly, looking back up at him.
He plopped down on one of the plush cushions on the couch, nestling the coffee mug in his hands as he settled in. He didn’t want to watch TV, didn’t even want to begin the sketch that sat next to him on the middle cushion he had put there earlier. Even if he did try to draw, it would more than likely end up being some variant of Tony, his eyes or hands. Two parts of Tony Steve absolutely adored. Granted he loved every bit of Tony, but there was just something so captivating in Tony’s warm and dewy chocolate eyes. And his hands were rough from inventing, yet they were so gentle and delicate when he touched Steve, as if he was something precious to the brunette. That made the blonde blush in fondness before finally taking a sip at his coffee. Strong and creamy. Perfect.
Tony shifted from his thoughts when he heard Steve’s moans grow more desperate. The blonde choked on a breath as his body arched. Tony knew that response; Steve had found his own prostate. The brunette couldn’t help but to smile, he’d rubbed that lovely bundle of nerves many times.
“I just am rather off about this business move,” the brunette finally admitted, moving his head away, away from the woman’s enticing touch. “It’s a big investment, the stakes are high. American companies do not often collaborate with the European market.” Tony stood then, taking his leather gloves off and slipping them into his back pocket while still holding the documents. Pepper pursed her lips and nodded, understanding Tony’s reservations. “Why does an alternative energy company want to establish a business agreement with us, a primarily weapon based industry?”
“Only because you tell me,” Steve said then after a moment. “And you’re perfect, Tony. Truly perfect.” Steve grasped the back of Tony’s neck, pulling the man down to ravage the brunette’s gorgeous mouth. They stayed like that for a while, kissing pleasantly, basking in the other’s presence before finally needing the urge for more. Tony slid down Steve’s body, kneeling on the floor once again.
In retrospect, it shouldn’t have looked so alluring to Steve. But here he was, swallowing thickly, his hormones taking off.
“Good, you’re so good, Steve.” Tony whispered, suckling at the back of Steve hip until a purplish bruise surfaced on his beloved’s creamy skin. The super soldier didn’t say much, merely grumbling happily before flopping into the sheets that were now wet and sticky from his come.
“I don’t know how I could forget that you like being manhandled… that you like it when I’m rough with you, Stevie,” Tony said, his other hand traveling to the wet spot at the front of Steve’s romper. The wet silk was cool on his warm erection, and his breath caught when Tony slipped his hand underneath the fabric and started to stroke his aching arousal. Steve bucked into the man’s fist, only to just about loose his mind when Tony’s other hand found its way under the fabric that covered Steve’s ass, his fingers massaging at his hole.
“Steve!” he heard Tony yell in the communication devices they wore in their ears. Though it was dank within the monster’s mouth, its breath putrid and heavy, the super solider didn’t hesitate to battle. Steve went for the creature’s jaws, beating it with his shield, breaking its teeth with each hit. When the beast finally opened its mouth once more, eliciting a pained screech, Steve hurdled himself upwards, shield held above his head as he smashed the creatures upper jaw, unhinging it from the mandible. With its jaw hanging loosely, the creature thrusted back, causing Steve to lose his footing. The super soldier fell back, falling fifty stories as he watched the tops of buildings become smaller with each passing moment. He prepared himself for impact before his body was suddenly jarred, and his back hit something that was solid, and metal. Looking down to see two metal arms wrapped around his torso, Steve then turned his head to see the Iron Man faceplate looking at him, cold and calculating.
Without a second thought, Steve raced through the water, his tail moving rapidly, the translucent scales catching in the light of the sun as he neared the surface. Steve breached the surface of the salty sea, quickly surveying the ship. He looked for the same insignia he had seen the day Bucky was captured, but the merman saw nothing but the name “Stark” painted on the haul of the boat. Steve swam under the ship to the other side, looking for any identifying marker, only for a large net to be cast upon him, he yelled and struggled to get the water-logged rope off of him. The weight of the twine dragged him under the water, entangling his arms and tail. Small fish were caught within the netting as well, and the merman did all that he could to help free his little friends, helping them shimmy through the square holes of the woven net. By the time he freed the last fish, the net was raised, and Steve was hoisted up from the water and dropped upon the dark deck of the ship.
“Sounds good. I’ll be there.”
They made it to the middle of the yard when a snowball flew out of nowhere, hitting Tony in the back of the head. “What the hell?” he said in surprise, touching the back of his head as small clumps of glistening snow fell from his dark hair.
Tony’s expression looked surprised, though he grinned mischievously. “Of course it’s alright,” he said then, grabbing Steve by the hands and pulling him to the wide and well-loved couch he had in the lounge area of the lab. “I promise I showered like an hour before you came down here.” And Steve just rolled his eyes good naturedly, pushing Tony gently down unto the couch so that the man was completely flat on the cushions.
So, grabbing up the chocolate sauce once more, Steve drizzled it along the lower half of Tony’s spine, the sauce slithering between the brunette’s ass cheeks and over his opening.
Steve nodded in agreement, sliding off his lover’s lap and feeling the dull ache from the brunette’s fingers penetrating him begin to heighten in his backside. It was a feeling Steve thoroughly enjoyed though.
Steve really wanted to touch himself indeed, his erection tremendously painful at this point.
“No, he’s oblivious to everything. And you honestly are not that obvious. I can just pick up on things is all.” Steve took a breath of relief when she told him that.
Thanks for reading!!
“Well then, if you’re trying to relieve my stress, then the plans I have for you are gonna be heaven for us both,” Tony growled possessively, capturing Steve’s lips as they stumbled to the super soldier’s room. They managed to get there, lips locked, and only running into a few walls along the way. Tony kissed Steve down into the mattress, the blonde’s hands pulling his boyfriend’s shirt off, revealing firm muscles and that beautiful glowing arc reactor. Steve couldn’t help but to intensify their kissing, slipping his tongue into Tony’s mouth, tasting his teeth, tongue and the lining of his jaw. Tony always tasted amazing, a mixture of mint and coffee. Feeling the brunette’s lithe body slide against his own was enough for Steve to buck his hips up against Tony’s, the rasp of his jeans a pleasant texture to his sensitive arousal.
,” Steve and Tony remarked in unison.
The blonde sea being sat unmoving, cyan blue eyes alert, darting from one direction to another.
Laying stock still, Steve stared at the ceiling. He reassured himself that this was fine. Friends did this, and Tony said it would be okay. Turning his head slowly, Steve’s eyes skirted up Tony’s frame before settling upon his face. Tony’s features were relaxed, and he hoped the man was having sweet dreams. Steve could hear the low hum of the arc reactor, that beautiful invention that kept Tony’s heart beating. Steve allowed himself to appreciate this moment, sharing a bed with the man he’d fallen for. Even if the feelings were one sided, Steve could at least have this memory to cherish.
The way that she’s whisperin’, the way that she’s pullin’ you in
It was a bit strange, Steve figured, looking at himself in vain as he tried to see all that Tony saw in him. It wasn’t that Steve thought of himself as unattractive, he just never was one to pay that much attention to himself. Not when so many others depended on him and the rest of his fellow Avengers.
Tony had been so pliant as they played around, allowing Steve to move them how he wanted. But then, like a bear awaking from a winter’s nap, Tony sprang to life, grabbing Steve and clinging to him, holding the blonde possessively.
“Look, Steve. I’m sorry if I made things unclear. I mean, you are charming, and when Aunt Peggy told me stories about you I did find you dreamy…” She trailed off, looking to Tony with big eyes before she looked back to Steve. “I’m going to head home now, I think. I’ll see you around HQ, Steve,” Sharon forced a smile before practically bolting through the crowd.
The brunette reveled in this moment, giving pleasure to the man he would spend the rest of his life with. He nuzzled his cheek against Steve’s bum, brushing his facial hair along that lovely skin of his future husband.
“Well, you’re gonna be a miserable man, not knowing what could be,” Rhodey stated matter-of-factly. He sighed when Tony just frowned. “Look, it’s a risk, you’re not wrong,” he admitted to the genius, shrugging his shoulders. “But risks have always been an all or nothing deal. Nothing ventured nothing gained and all that.”
“Don’t worry, baby. I just need to figure out how to get this contraption off you,” Tony said lightly, turning Steve on his side. The blonde had to direct him, Tony fiddling with the clasps at the back until it finally released. Tony beamed in accomplishment until he noticed the buckles that were still connected to Steve’s thigh highs, and he sighed dramatically. “Damn, this is more complicated than it should be,” Tony huffed as he undid the clips.
Steve had gone back to the Tower a week after the injury, Tony constantly by his side, tending to him more than was probably necessary, Steve figured.
“No, what do you want?”
“That damn fish ate my bait,” Tony huffed with a pout. He heard Steve laugh, shutting his mouth quickly when Tony glowered at him, though there was no real malice behind it.
“I said, I’m not in love with Sharon. I-I don’t like her that way. At one point, when she was undercover as my neighbor, I found her intriguing then. But most certainly not now,” Steve explained, his voice annoyed.
“Anytime, Steve,” Tony replied honestly. He thought he wouldn’t enjoy fishing. And maybe he wouldn’t if he wasn’t with Steve, because the guy definitely made it more fun. But it was a calming hobby, like the blonde had said earlier. And he most certainly wanted to do this again, with Steve beside him.
“I am not.”
“Gotta say, Steve. You can wear my clothes whenever you want,” Tony commented, squeezing the blonde’s rump and chuckling low. Steve laughed too, leaning in to peck Tony on the nose.
It was early December now, and the Avengers were hosting just a small party after a successful mission of infiltrating a Hydra facility. They were getting closer and closer to finding where Loki’s scepter was, and by the information they had received from this last mission, Steve figured they were close.
I got a heart rush, it ain’t slowin’ down
Tony kept that up until Steve hissed out a breath and his skin was a bright red. The brunette kissed every inch of tormented skin, licking at the warm, delicate rim as a kind of balm to that now crimson colored opening.
Steve always had an eye for texture, and the look of silken fabrics were his favorite texture to draw. He loved how they shined in the light and molded beautifully to the human figure. He couldn’t deny how much he loved the feel of it on his skin, how he looked in the lingerie. Now he would see if Tony liked him in it just as much.
“And now you have the freedom to do that whenever you like,” Steve remarked, grinning at him lovingly.
Now, as he laid there in the chambers of the vessel, Steve truly hoped he would see that man one more time. To thank him for his kindness, and maybe he would be able to help Steve get off the boat too somehow.
"Can’t let people see Captain America passed out," Sam jested.
“Please what?” Tony smiled deviously, leaning in close to kiss the man’s opening. Steve practically whined, his body shaking from the pent up anticipation.
“Evening, Natasha,” Steve smiled, peering at his beautiful friend, her long red hair curling like tendrils over her shoulders as well as on the watery surface.
“Just relax and lay there like the gorgeous thing you are.” Tony smiled as he sidled up close to Steve once again.
“Hmm?” the blonde asked, his cheeks flushed, eyes heavy lidded, and his whole body on a love drunk rush.
Staying away from everyone was for the best, Tony’s irrational behavior wasn’t anyone’s doing, especially Steve’s. He’d work everything out within his brain and heart. And once that was sorted, he’d carry on as he normally would, a shit-eating grin plastered on his face and an ego to fill an entire building.
In turn, Tony bit and sucked at his love's nipples, loving how Steve clutched at the sheets, begging the brunette for more. Steve was close to tipping over the edge when Tony slipped a finger within him, only to add another and caress Steve's entrance, all the while his other hand massaged at the meat of his bum. Steve felt his eyes tear up, his body and soul overcome with love, sensation and unadulterated serendipity.
“Sir?”
He heard the cap of the lube pop open, and saw Tony squirt a large amount of the gel on his hand and fingers. Steve spread his legs wider for the man so that he could have easier access to him, his eyes locking with Tony’s then.
“You assumed a few years ago that you would always hate Steve.” Rhodes said, knocking the brunette from his thoughts. “I think you’re just scared.”
“Can’t hear you, J,” Tony called as he buffed out the rust of the exhaust pipe. The A.I. repeated himself and Tony rolled his eyes, sliding himself on the roller seat from under the car. “I can’t understand you when you mumble like that,” Tony huffed, sitting up only to see Steve looking down at him.
“Yes,” Steve said after a while. “Yes I have been in those shoes before.”
energetic force that could bring two people together and bond them for eternity. It was believed that each person was destined to be with their other half, their soulmate. Together they could not only enhance the beauty in each other, but also bring out each other’s inner strength, protectiveness and loyalty. Mentally and emotionally the soulmates were one body, their faithfulness to each other unparalleled.
“How’d your talk with Tony go?” Natasha asked, dicing up a tomato and adding it to the eggs before opening a package of shredded cheese.
“Holy…
“Hey, I’ve been meaning to tell you,” Tony started then, grasping Steve by the shoulder. Steve turned his head to see Tony staring at him, their faces remarkably close. So close that Steve could see the individual hairs in Tony’s van dyke beard. “Nick called me today, saying that we are to host a toy drive for the holidays this weekend,” Tony said, and Steve was merely watching Tony’s pink lips moving before he looked into the man’s brown eyes.
So, Tony settled himself partly over the super soldier who was grinding desperately against his love’s fingers in absolute wanton desire.
Steve smiled as he flicked his tongue up the underside of his beloved’s penis, the vein thick and warm as he traced its course up until Steve hit the tip of the genius’s erection.
They were both in need of a shower, Tony’s come slipping out of Steve’s behind and down his thighs as they rested there. “What’re the chances you built a shower or tub in here?” Steve asked jokingly, getting a contagious grin and giggle from the brunette.
“You bet,” Steve said, sidling up to Tony and wrapping an arm around the brunette’s shoulders, nuzzling close.  “What about that item over there?” Steve asked against the man’s temple before placing a soft kiss right above his ear. Tony saw the rolled textured paper leaning against one of the walls of the basket and snatched it up, unrolling it. The heavy paper held an ink drawing Steve had done. It wasn’t anything spectacular, he felt, just an image of the east coast seaside. Though, if one looked closely enough, one could see two male forms in silhouette holding hands, their frames replicating Steve’s and Tony’s.
Tony loved the parties without a doubt, the glamorous, elitist lifestyle an exquisite extravaganza. Those were the most important things in Tony’s life… until his accident anyways. The brunette leaned against the ship’s rail, the fingers of his one hand tapping a random beat on his chest, where a circular, metallic ring was nestled beneath his dress shirt. It glowed a cool blue, illuminating under the cream cotton shirt; that little circle of light kept Tony alive.
Tony watched as one of the thin spaghetti straps of Steve’s lingerie slipped from the blonde’s shoulder, settling on the strong curve of his bicep. The movement caused the silky fabric of the neckline to fall, exposing the pink, hard nub of a nipple. Tony wasted no time leaning in and licking the pebbled flesh then, pulling at it with his teeth. He heard Steve’s gasps, low and breathy as he pushed his chest forward for Tony to nip at the skin more, wanting more. Tony obliged, pulling away to slip the other strap down and taunt the other freshly exposed nipple. “T-Tony” Steve stuttered out, head falling forward as he watched his boyfriend body worship him.
Steve smiled as he reread the article, remembering how he had dreamed of finding his soulmate, someone who was his absolute perfect match. Someone who heightened his strengths, balanced his weaknesses and brought an inexplicable joy to his mind and soul. Steve reminisced of that yearning to provide such happiness for someone else, that he, a skinny, sickly man could be the perfect match to somebody, that he could give that almost etherial joy. During the war, and after Project Rebirth, Steve had believed Peggy was his soulmate. The connection they had, such kindred spirits in the world. She brought him so much joy, encouraged him and lifted him up when the world literally and figuratively crumbled around him. He was sure she was the one, his soulmate. He’d never felt such a connection with anyone before or since.
“Couldn’t make a life with darling Peggy, so you’ve settled on her niece,” Tony said as if it was obvious, his voice slightly laced with displeasure. “Sharon, she’s the girl you’ve been swooning over the past few months.” It was then that Sharon sidled up next to the two men as Tony continued. “It’s okay, you’re just going down the bloodline. I don’t know if Peggy would approve but-”
I got a girl crush, hate to admit it but
That was all Steve needed to hear before delving in and slipping his tongue over Tony’s hole once more. Closing his eyes, Steve focused on the feeling of Tony’s body, the smooth tight ring of muscle that clenched with each passing swipe of his tongue. Tony’s groans and sultry sighs could have pushed Steve over edge, but he knew that they both deserved to make it to the best part of it all. So, with as much mental strength he could muster, Steve pushed his throbbing needs aside and thrusted his tongue in against his beloved’s opening, the rim starting to loosen to his persistence.
“ehn, ye-yes. God, Tony, don’t stop doing that,” Steve said between gritted teeth. He was so damn close to orgasming. He couldn’t take the heat that roiled through his belly much longer. Tony pleased him, just as his beloved asked, suckling on the tense muscle of his rim. He then turned his cheek in against the hole, rasping his beard along the sensitive skin of Steve’s body. Tony nosed at the man’s perineum then, reaching a hand down to rub at Steve’s prostate from the outside, the super soldier squirming under his touch. Squeezing his hands in the blonde’s thighs as he went, Tony was spurred to keep going by the delicious sounds Steve made.
Memories flooded Steve’s vision, Peggy’s beautiful smile fading into view. He had always imagined them dancing the way Tony and Pepper were now, Steve protecting her, loving her sweetly. He had wanted that for so long. But his heart and mind stifled that feeling once he realized he would never have it with Peggy. It wasn’t until Tony, that Steve yearned for that companionship again.
“You sure? I’m shorter than you. The bed might be the better one.”
“Speaking of beds, I think I am gonna hit the hay now.” Steve said, feigning a yawn. He beelined it for the little closet near the door where he found an extra blanket. “I will steal some of your pillows, though,” Steve said, grabbing a few out from under Tony’s head, laughing as we walked back to the couch.
The furniture’s were covered up.
They heard another moan.
“You know, I don’t get why you guys are so amiable in us learning about Asgard.” Clint slouched over the front seat, looking at Thor.
“I think I just met Persephone.”
“If you like,” Bruce looked to Steve, for permission, and Steve gave a nod. “I have a lab here,” Tony jumped at the offer. “Let’s go Bruce!” They both walked, Bruce leading the way. Steve trailed behind them.
“Back to trick,” Tony pointed to Natasha. “Thor’s darling boys. Always take after their mother.”
“You guys had Asgardian mead?” Steve was amazed. Tony's eyes squinted, “I didn’t buy it.” They looked to Rhodey, who thankfully found some aspirins. “What? Is it not regular beer?” he gulped down the pills with water and gave the bottle to Tony.
Tony held his breath. His body thrummed at Steve lips touching him. Oh man, he had a feeling he won’t be going home anything time soon. Nuh-uh, he wanted a piece of Steve.
******
Tony had his first kiss when he was thirteen. It was clumsy and too much spit. He remembered their hearts pounding.
Well, Tony knew Odin was a weird dude and his house does not reflect that. He thought he would see a house like the one in the show “Little house on the prairie.”
.” James and Natasha eyes widen in surprised.
Steve fought the laugh, “It’s true. I was like you.” He pointed to Jazmin. “My dad was a shifter; my mother wasn’t one. So, I was half. My mother was very sick, and she couldn’t go through the change. Your mommy was very strong, so she could.” She let out a smile, hearing how strong her mother was.
Tony tilts his head, his attention on Sam. “Birds and bees?” he blinked.
Tony smiled, “Cabin in the woods?”
“Dad?” Tony squeaked out.
Tony jumped, holding tightly to Bruce hand. Not painfully, if what Tony learned so far, these last few days, they barely felt him. Steve gave a frown, not liking how Tony was too close and how Bruce was touching him – though he knew it wasn’t Bruce fault.
“What are they doing?” Tony finally asked. “Looks like they’re posturing” Loki cleared his throat. “Wade” his voice stern. Wade reluctantly turned his attention to Loki. “Go to the back and stock that shelf, love” he ordered.
Tony was a bit weird, more than usual. One being he liked smells. And not just any scent. Just those that he loved most and—Steve scent.
Tony frowned, and waved at the display in front of them, “I think at this point my third eye is open.” Sam laughed at that.
“So, what? Does that mean house arrest?” Clint questioned.
“I’ll drive” Steve stated as he moves to the front door. Looking back at Tony, who just stood frozen. “Well?” he barked, maybe he should have let Nat come in his stead, he was bad at this. Tony jumped. Steve sighed—he will do that a lot—and stepped out.
Steve back hit the headboard; Tony leaned against his chest. They both were panting. They made a mess. Steve’s hand pulled from Tony and grasped his buttocks and squeezed.
Tony turned around and handed the flowers to Clint, “Mind putting them in water, buddy.” Clint took them, waved them off, as they both moved and entered the car.
“Rebecca,” she was popular. As Tony turn to look at a man, who was smiling the same smile as her. He held out some clothes to her, “Found them, how about you see if can get it on them.”
“Are you growling?” Tony's eyes widen, sparked with amusement.
“How do you know my Aunt Peggy?” Steve slammed the brakes. Thank god this wasn’t a busy road.
Thor pats Clint back. “Yes, mother has quite the green thumb.”
You really don’t know how good you had it until it’s gone.
Which now left blue eyes and Bucky.
“Yes, but mommy wasn’t,” hands to her waist now, looking very impatient with Steve.
Once they’ve finished, cleaned up and hop in the car with Thor. The others following soon, and Steve glue to his side. Tony remembered that they needed to talk. But he will hold out on that chat for way, way later.
“Come sit my little darlings.” Frigga spoke. Her voice was velvet sweetness to Tony ears. This is the first time he ever came to close contact with her. Her hair was golden and cascaded in curls. Her eyes were warm emeralds, the corners wrinkled. But she still looked young, Tony would surmise she was probably in her fifties, if this was a normal place. And he could not believe she gave birth to Thor.
Tony took notice of the older man eye patch. Wondered what the story behind that was.
at this time for Asgard.” Pepper gave a short laugh. “That bad?”
As Wade disappeared to the back. Steve shoulders relaxed. “So mature Steve” Loki was holding back a laugh.
Natasha spoke, “Mm, it’s hard to say. But we live a few centuries.” Buck lands his hand on his friends’ shoulders, “And that is why you guys will have a few lessons today. To understand us.”
“Anymore family members you going to bring Sam? How about the whole damn town?” Steve snapped.
“Thor is nothing but a worrywart. Nothing that mother could not help with” the mention of his mother placated Odin.
Steve looked and shrugged “That’s fine.”
Tony cut in before Steve, “Does that mean you’re half?” He took off his sunglasses, placing them on his collar, giving Jazmin a curious look. Her mood changed with Tony instantly, “Yes! Mommy and daddy met out there,” she pointed out. Probably didn’t know the specifics of her parents meeting.
Well, he got what he wanted. But, what could he really say?
It was a sunny, gorgeous day to take a long road trip and then it turned to soup. The fog thick, Tony couldn’t see a damn thing.
“Come, Tony, let’s go for a ride” he walked towards the vehicle.
And Tony found himself wanting to touch Steve more. He pulled his hand away. Something else catching his eye – a distraction, good.
Odin, a man of few words it seemed.
"About homosexuality?"
Tony felt odd watching the affections. It brought memories of his family. And though they were happy thoughts they were also painful, because they were not here.
“Oh, ho!” Clint smiled.
*****
Tony blinks at the newest shifter. A bear. His friends will get a kick out of this.
Tony was still in his boxer and T-shirt, and terrible bed hair. But he upturned his nose at him and went back to his friends and eggs. It was childish, snobby, but he made him that way. He heard Bucky laugh.
“No. Tonight should be enough," Odin eye gleam with humor.
Natasha could be heard laughing.
“Guys what the hell?” he laughed as he let go of Rhodey.
“Well, one, am I in Asgard?” he noted the other man surprise but his faced clear with a smile back in place. He nodded.
Tony chuckled. It was short, but he needed this. He gently places the letter back.
Tony rolled his eyes, fingers pinching the bridge of his nose. “Shut up. And I can't promise that."
“Once long ago this would have given me a headache.” Odin smiled, wistfully. “But since I’m now retired," he looked to Steve with amusement, “It falls to you.”
“Uh—” before he was able to answer, Natasha cut them off.
Skidding to a halt, he turned his attention back to the creature who just roared. It was pretty pissed and somehow, he knew it was aimed at the blond at the door. Speaking of, he moved out the doorway, moving beside Tony at the snarling animal. “Hey, Wade calm down” he spoke in a heavily soothing voice. It was almost hypnotic.
Steve looked into the mirror, carding his fingers into his hair. Natasha cut his hair and helped trim his beard. Saying that he couldn’t look like a shaggy dog, both wolves let out a displease noise, she shushed them. He tried to argue that Tony already knew how he looked.
“Well, it’s not boring, but what kooky stuff did you bring me too…”
“That’s the problem. I can’t,” Steve almost laughed at the identical faces look of shock. But humor was long gone for him tonight.
Bucky was startled. His mouth was gaped open as he stared at Tony. Talk about awkward. Tony gave a small wave.
Tony was pissed. A touch mortified.  He was pushed into the truck and now heading to the homestead.
“U-uh Hey” he waved at them.
“Is that…” Steve trailed off. “Yes,” Natasha's face lit up.
“So far it’s awesome, guards included.” He pointed to Steve and Bucky. Sam eyes roamed Tony, head tilt looking over to Steve and his eyes landed on Bucky. “They are overwhelming. Especially when they get growly. Wolves.” He scrunched his nose at that.
"And you fell right on your ass," Sam laughed. Natasha good naturedly rolled her eyes at Sam.
“Steve?” Tony asked when his boyfriend didn’t seem to move.
“The beast has been defeated,” Thor remarked, pointing with Mjolnir behind him, revealing the dead creature, its mouth open, its glossy black eyes lifeless. “If either of you care,” he mumbled. Natasha and Clint arrived shortly after, looking at the slain creature as well.
Steve licked his bottom lip, eyes half lidded as he worked his fingers over a nipple then, lurching into his touch as he pinched and pulled at the rosy nub. Tony loved Steve’s chest, loved licking those hard nipples, biting the deep pink flesh with his teeth as Steve writhed beneath him. Watching Steve toy with them, and seeing how much he enjoyed it was almost as great as when Tony was there doing it himself. Almost.  “Wish this was you touching me,” Steve said breathily as he flicked his nipple quickly, the nub bouncing back into place with each passing stroke.
Curiously, Tony slipped his thumb closer to the seam of Steve’s mouth, and Steve grinned before he gently took Tony’s thumb between his lips, nipping at the pad of the digit teasingly. Watching Tony, the super soldier started sucking on the genius’s thumb, moaning ever so softly as he did.
“Stop with that will you. Bucky has already made sure that was off the table," she could not help teasing them.
Nothing more needed to be said. Steve turn around and headed back home.
“I guess it went well…” Bucky stated. Tony was not sure, but Bucky didn’t exactly sound happy. Maybe he just didn’t want to bump into another, barely dressed, man. And wasn’t he a wolf, Sam said they had a good sense of smell. So, Bucky might not appreciate the waft of sex.
"So, more on the scrawny kid deal?” ‘cause you just can’t reveal something like that, he needed all the details.
And took a swig. He smacked his lips at the taste. “This is interesting.”
Rhodes cleared the counter, “Well Steve, that’s fine. But you’ll catch more flies with honey than vinegar.”
“Stay here,” Steve ordered and walked briskly away, turned to Bucky “Keep an eye on them,” and out he went.
*****
Rhodes and Clint shared a look. Clint shrugged.
Rhodey sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose “We have lives. What exactly do you expect us to do?”
Everyone took a seat. The children sat close to Frigga.
“Shut up” Steve barked out, his ears turning red. He wasn’t flirting… he wasn’t sure what he was doing. His was divided. A part of him was trying to stay rational while the other—fighting that part was exhausting. That part wanted something from Tony. And Tony wouldn’t understand that part. Even though, Steve was getting uneasy, edgy.
Once Steve was done cleaning up his boyfriend, he kissed a trail up and over the man’s clavicle, to his neck, nipping at a sinewy tendon there before finally brushing Tony’s nose with his own, chuckling sweetly. “How was that?” He asked then, snuggling his face into the side of Tony’s neck.
And thanks to my beta, any mistakes are mine.
Tony didn’t even have a chance to say ‘you’re welcome’ before Steve slid out of his chair and to his knees, wiggling himself in between his boyfriend’s legs and sliding his hands up Tony’s clothed thighs, the flannel pajama bottom fabric soft to the touch.
The blonde obliged, resting his chin in his arms, looking at the genius who had opened the lube and squirted out a large amount on his finger and palm. Steve sighed pleasantly when he felt one of his fiancé’s fingers journey down to the cleft of his ass before settling at his hole. Steve’s penis was fully erect by now, and when Tony slipped his finger completely inside, Steve’s cock twitched against the unkempt sheets.
He reached sunlight and what looked to be a farm. He pulled to the side, there was a house and he saw an older couple about.
Tony watched as it shift into a person. To the young guy he met earlier today.
“What?” Tony and Rhodey said in unison, an incredulous look. “What the hell Barton? What makes you think you will get out of here alive,” Rhodey said through clench teeth.
He had an instant flash of them both as little boys. Wade had the same defiant look—but unable to look either parent in the eyes, which was a tell that Wade knew exactly what he has done wrong. Jared wringing his hands together, nervous, but able to look anyone in the eyes to defend his big brother.
“So, what are you going to do?” Pepper asked. They’ve stride together to Tony’s red Audi R8 E-Tron.
The little girl from before, Jazmin, was sitting down away from the others. Watching the two cubs playing. She was pouting.
Man, this place must love them. At that moment Thor entered with a couch held in one hand. And it wasn’t like a loveseat type. “Good morning!” all three flinched at Thor loudness. “Inside voice Thor” Bucky smiled, “Our boys here had quite a night.” Thor settles the couch down and Bucky led Clint down on it.
Tony woke up. He needed to use the bathroom.
“Wow!” Clint let out. “Man, what the hell is going on? What was in that ham? Let me say I avoided drugs for this exact reason."
“You guys been tricked.” Natasha stated. “But, who exactly down one bottle and the other half?” she sounded impressed.
They were so cute, and a few were pups, wolves. And their little snout were in the air sniffing and turned to see Bucky and Steve and they all tackled the grown men. Steve was laughing at being licked and Bucky shifted, springing up and taking off, a few pups tailing behind him.
“Yes, I’m terrified.” He countered.
Bruce duck his head, a low laugh and looked up, “The kids—just teaching them a few things.” Humor bright in his eyes. He would not mention that he was out in bear form, basking in the sun as the kids came poking at his side and he just couldn’t resist being a prick. But, the kids knew Bruce, and they did it just to have fun.
Thor laugh brought them back, focusing on him. “No, no.” he shook his head. “We live a longer life than you all sure, but we grow old and pass on.”
His Aunt Peggy always told him that Rhodey was his best friend, the type that would be there for all the ups and down. He agreed, as he held her arm in his, while they walked the courtyard of the hospital. She was relaxed, when she said it again that day, he felt her relief. She probably was worried that he would be alone.
“Hey!” Clint snapped. Though they knew that neither one was going to be abandon the other. They just tend to go either panic mode or humor. Even if it was inappropriate, but it worked.
“I look and sound like a man, but I gave birth to my daughter,” he looked to Rebecca lovingly and turned back to Tony. “You may come across one of our own that is a woman but may have their mate with child. I guess in a term we could be consider intersex. But, maybe not all would go under that term,” he shrugged. “I was born this way and had a child of my own. Loki is different.”
“Ah, thank you” Odin took a seat, both hands on top of his cane handle.
Bruce blinked; his face broke into another smile. “I’m going to assume you were going to visit my labs.” Tony huffed at him. Steve found it cute.
Steve nodded, he’s right, Natasha would kill him. “All right, here goes nothing.” He stood straight up, a determine face on and marched out the door.
Steve’s still caught up in Tony scent. Disappointed that he couldn’t taste him again. But with Tony clung to him, a viselike grip on his shirt, he turned to see the bear that had Tony nervous.
“Well, couldn’t you have waited like a week later to get
Tony let out a sigh, “Of course.”
“So, what’s taking him so long?” Tony gritted his teeth. The last thing he wanted was
His face buried in Steve chest and Steve had him all wrapped in his covers and arms. It was a task to unwrap himself.
“The flowers. Red Calla lily means beauty, passion. Daffodils means rebirth, new beginnings and Lavender, love and devotion.”
Tony glance at Pepper and they both let out a laugh.
Clint was on the atrocious moose light fixture. Peering down with one eye open.
All three slumped.
“Shapeshifters.” Tony replied.
“Geeze, thanks” he frowned.
“Then—it was just dad and me.” He whispered out.
He noticed they were surprised. Did he look suspicious?
On cue, Natasha handed him a glass. Tony took a gulp, while turning over. Rhodey huffed, not practically happy in how he was being woken. They both stared at each other and started to laugh, but instantly stopped as they groan in pain.
His phone rang, “Hey Pep, what’s up?”
“Yea, the bear I mention earlier, Bruce.” Said bear, stopped and stood staring at them both curiously.
“Yes,” Thor nodded, knowing Wade disdain towards the Sherriff. “I can’t really fix that as well…”
This caught Steve off guard. He never had a problem with wiping a person's memory. Though the biggest problem wasn’t just that. Steve stared at his hand, still feeling the current in him, fading little-by-little. It woke every nerve ending in him. Stirring up the creature inside him. Looking back to the house, he huffed and turned away.
This place was incredible.
He couldn’t help but laugh, his mixed feelings from earlier forgotten—for now. “Tomorrow we are going to Frigga, Thor’s mom, place." Clint said rummaging through the bags. “Getting the Shapeshifter 101.”
Bruce let out a short laugh, “Guilty.”
Steve tilted Tony head up, “Damn right you’ll be respected.” Before Tony could answer, Steve lips engulfed him. He moaned into it. His legs wrapped around Steve’s waist and he was heft up. Arms wrapped tightly around Steve broad shoulders, as Steve decided to move this to the bedroom.
He pulled out his phone and made a call.
“Yes!” Rhodes moves back as he points at Tony and places both hands on his head. Mind blown.
“Sorry about that, we couldn't help pranking you “Rhodes spoked.
And there they were—his Top five least liked people. Bucky being number five and Steve the winner, he should be so proud.
“Generations?”
“Right now,” Sam answered. “Their parents bring them here. It’s safe and they get to shift, run around with the right supervision.” He smiled as he watches Bucky zig zag through, the little pups trying their best to catch him.
“As if we all forgotten what regular people looks like. Come now all give your once over and go about your damn business” Loki gritted out. And everyone turned away and far away from Loki mostly. Tony chuckled.
The two brothers had a silent argument—Wade with a skeptical look towards his little brother—but it looked like Jared won the argument as wade turned “Whatever! Like Jared said, it was just a joke, just wipe their memories” he scoffed.
*****
They agreed not all the way. Didn’t mean they would not get naked.
*****
“A trade?”
Entering, they didn’t know what to make of it.
Clint stood in front of Tony, examining him. “Hey buddy, feel any—less memory?” he splayed his hands.
“What just happened?”
“I thought we would be the
*****
Tony shoulders sagged, relieved. He should have known better, but he needed to hear it.
They shook hands, “Hey, how you’d like it around here? Beside the whole imprisonment situation.” Tony was going to like him.
Hope you enjoyed this chapter.
Well, here's chapter 3. I did warn ya'll lol
“Jesus,” Clint huffed out.
“No, I’m staying right here.” He said firmly, but a touch of fondness. He was gentle with Loki, which made Tony
He sat back and exhaled long and inhale.
“Something like that. Steve and the rest will keep an eye on you three” Odin waved his hand to the others, showing who their babysitters going to be.
“Tony?” Steve, cautious.
The chair scraped the wooden floor. He pulled his hand away from Steve. Blue eyes held a bit of hurt, but Tony was instantly on him.
For the first time, he saw Steve shift; he was golden brown, and his blue eyes had a glint of something—he not sure of what—but his stare gives Tony those aftershocks again. And both wolves were gone.
Steve looked down at him, his blue eyes holding some hope. Tony’s aware that Steve held his hand, still. His thumb stroking it. There went his inside again. He felt the flutter of butterfly wings, as his mother would put it. And those pesky aftershocks down his spine.
“Good morning Anthony” warm green eyes settles on him. He should avoid Loki, but at this moment he was a safe zone and maybe close to normalcy.
Steve slamming his door shut. “You’re very mature” Tony said sarcastically.
All my thanks to Fra98ffri. So happy I have someone to go over this and giving me great feedbacks.
“He’s horrible at flirting," Bucky let out.
Tony move out their way and stay close to Loki. “Morning!”
Steve doubted she had so much to do. She was good at conning the others in the heavy lifting. But he felt guilty. It was unlike him to disregard his duties. But he could not get out the funk from Tony rejection.
Though he was also extremely sleepy, his body drained from all they’d done together, Steve couldn’t help but think how incredibly blessed he was. Never had he thought that he and Tony would be together this way, intimately holding one another and sharing a bed as boyfriends.
“Love you too, Steve,” Tony replied, dragging a thumb along the super soldier’s bottom lip before taking his hand in his and walking them toward his penthouse.
“J.A.R.V.I.S, black out the windows in here, would you please?” Tony asked then, keeping his eyes locked on his boyfriend’s. Instantly the windows tinted so that Steve and Tony could look out, though nobody would be able to see inside. “Did you like what else I had placed in your basket, Stevie?” Tony asked, leaning in to nip at Steve’s jaw as the one hand of his fingers teased along the cleft of the blonde’s bum.
“Damn, Steve. Love your mouth.” Tony breathed, a hand lowering to one of Steve’s biceps, his thumb brushing along the ridge of where his tricep and bicep meet.
“W-what is...what may I call you, merman?” The man finally stammered out. Steve looked back up at him, gently laying a hand on his bandaged side before answering.
“…Maybe…” Tony admitted, his eyes closing and mouth parting as his boyfriend moved his lips warmly up his jaw. “So glad to be back… with you,” Tony breathed, his hands gently pushing Steve back until he was on his back, and Tony straddled his lap, caressing the blonde’s shoulders before moving them over his biceps and down his forearms.
The next morning, Tony grumbled as he rolled out of bed, bright and early. He wanted to catch Steve before he set out on his run and what not. Seriously, how could Steve get up so damn early? He didn’t care what the man said about how he is used to it from the military. Anything before 10am should be illegal.
Steve told him the story of his mom, and Tony could hear the fondness in his voice when he spoke of her. Steve didn’t mention his mom much, and Tony could understand that. His own mother was his world, and when she died, for a long time the mere thought of it was enough to make him fall apart. Steve’s mother was a saint though, from what Steve had said about her. She not only raised one of the most honorable men in the world, but also she did everything she could to make sure Steve was taken care of and loved, in a world that so often indulges in cruelty.
“It was,” Tony agreed adjusting the red scarf around his neck.
“Need you,” Steve said, biting his ruby bottom lip, and breathing deep.
“Oh?” Natasha said, inviting Steve to continue.
“I’ve never believed any fairytale creature to be real,” Tony said, smiling lightly. There was a pause before Tony continued. “I am sorry, I must be overstepping all bounds of etiquette,” Tony chuckled, taking a step back from the merman. “My apologies.”
“Holy shit,” the brunette hissed out, feeling Steve’s entrance clench at the adjustment of Tony deeply inside him. Tony opened his eyes at the gentle ragged breaths that left Steve’s parted lips, the intensity of the sudden heat and connection of his boyfriend leaving the blonde keening.
“Carter?” he asked, a browed raised.
Steve, with a raised brow followed the chocolate trail, the pastel foil shimmering in the window lighting. The trail took him through the kitchen where Steve happened upon a post it note. He couldn’t help but smile fondly at Tony’s chicken scratch. ‘Getting close there, Stevie,’ it read. The eggs now turned to jelly beans, and so, Steve continued, popping a few of the beans in his mouth as he went.
“Mmm, you take it so good, baby,” Tony cooed, hooking his finger deeply into Steve, his other hand finding its way under the man’s groin, only to rub small gentle circles into the blonde’s perineum.
“It is,” Steve replied shyly, finally looking to his boyfriend. “I do like when you take control,” Steve admitted. “I don’t know why, I just do.” Tony saw how his love looked ashamed. That, that wasn’t what Tony wanted to happen when having this conversation.
After a moment, Steve pulled off completely, and he looked up at Tony with big doe eyes. The blonde’s tongue darted out along his red glistening lips, tasting the bit of precome that lingered upon them before moving back in and caressing the weeping head of Tony’s cock with the flat of his tongue. Before Tony could get used to that particular sensation though, Steve flicked just the tip of his tongue in against the wet slit of his lover’s swollen penis tauntingly.
ship. Shouldering his way through the crew members who were surrounding something, Tony reached the center, his eyes affixing upon the object of speculation. Tony’s brown eyes widened at the sight of a creature he’d only read in the fairytales as a child, his butler, Jarvis tucking him into bed every night with a story of fantastical creatures. This one before him was a creature from the sea, and Tony let out a sharp breath as the shock started to wane from his body.
Opening his eyes barely, Steve looked into the mirror, meeting Tony’s glistening chocolatey gaze. He skirted his eyes to his own reflection then, seeing his mouth parted as he whimpered with each drag of the man’s finger in his opening. “Uh-uhn,” he huffed as he chased the genius’s fingers with his ass.
"W-well, who is it?" Bruce asked, enthusiastic about it all. It took Tony a little bit by surprise.
“Fuck, Steve,” Tony rushed out, gritting his teeth to fight off his climax. “You like it like this, having me play with you as I fuck you? God you’re so fucking tight.” Steve’s moans were coming faster then as he teetered on the edge.
Tony gulped down a cup of coffee before making it to Steve’s floor, knocking lightly on the door. He stood there a moment before knocking once more, his brows furrowed. Could Steve be out already? He checked the time on his watch which read 5:58am. Hey, he was early! Tony heard footsteps then, the door opening to reveal a sleepy-eyed soldier.
“This is my Christmas gift?” Steve asked incredulously. Tony nodded, rolling up the sleeves of his button down. “I-I can’t accept this, Tony,” he remarked, his voice leery. “It’s too much.” Steve straightened his own shirt, smoothing out the dark navy fabric and feeling fidgety with Tony’s piercing gaze on him.
“I don’t think that’ll be going away for a bit,” Steve snickered, his eyes flickering up to the brunette’s, a coy grin on his face.
They spent a while reeling in and casting out, talking quietly, as if speaking any louder would disturb the peace of nature. They shifted between different baits, sometimes putting on a worm or minnow, which Tony still felt bad about. Even though they weren’t catching anything, Tony couldn’t believe the overall calmness he felt by being out in such a tranquil atmosphere. He only itched for his phone a few times, to check in on matters, or to see if for some reason Pepper got in contact with him. She’d only reached out to him for business matters. And Tony wasn’t going to attempt to talk with her about personal life matters. He learned his lesson the last time he tried. He just liked knowing that she was alright. That was something that would never change, no matter what their relationship title was.
With one last nip to Steve’s bottom lip, he felt Tony move back, causing Steve to open his eyes and take a few regulating breaths. Tony literally took his breath away, and he could feel his cheeks and neck rather flushed. He couldn’t help but grin hard, watching as Tony did the same.
Tony was keening, his hands moving from the sheets to Steve’s hair rhythmically. The brunette was losing his grip, he was just so suddenly close to tipping off the balance of bliss and into a state of pure euphoria.
“Nonsense,” Tony responded, his sultry voice possessive, his breath puffing against the blonde’s backside. Steve felt his love’s hands lifting the night before sliding over each cheek of Steve’s ass. Tony’s dull nails dug into that taut flesh as the super soldier hummed at the sensation, his mind flooding with images of Tony touching him.
“I guess we are both full of surprises today,” Steve snickered, leaning in and giving Tony a sweet kiss to his lips.
“Gee, thanks, Tony,” Steve said sassily after a moment, trying to ignore the feel of the hard metal of Tony’s suit pressed into the flesh of his back.
“Whatever, I still have pillows and the mattress,” Tony replied, sitting up then and looking to the super soldier. “Steve?” He heard the brunette call him as he made up his bed on the couch.
“Tony, I think you got a bite!” Steve said excitedly, knocking Tony from his daydream. He looked to see his pole bouncing gently, small ripples expanding around his moving bobber. Tony yanked his pole back quickly, but as he reeled the hook in he could feel no resistance. And when the line arose from the water, Tony had nothing but a hook.
Thank you all for reading this story! I can't believe it is just about over. *heart breaks a little*
The super soldier continued to stroll down memory lane, popping his coat collar up when a frigid wind whipped around him. He passed through his old neighborhood, and he stopped in front of the apartment he had grown up in with his mother. It most certainly was worse for wears. But he could see passing shadows through the curtains of the windows. Steve hoped a happy family was inhabiting the space he once called home.
This was not how he thought his day would go.
“Will that be all, Mr. Stark?” Pepper asked, and God, did Tony feel everything in his world crumble beneath him.
“Don’t worry, I just wanna open you up like this,” he assured Steve. When they made love this way, Steve always wanted to face Tony, to watch the brunette’s face when he orgasmed. Steve obliged then, shifting on his stomach, his lingerie swishing against the comforter. He spread his legs once more, leaning on his elbows so he could turn and see his boyfriend. Tony smiled and gently patted Steve’s gorgeously round bum as a way of thanking him for changing position. Working his way between Steve’s legs, leaning in to bite at the muscular shoulders of his love, Tony couldn’t help but to think of how happy he was to have Steve in his life. Not just as fellow avengers, but as boyfriends, lovers, soulmates.
“I’m happy here,” she said, leaning a hip against the counter as well. “I’m doing okay,” she reassured him. Tony nodded, taking a gulp of the hot liquid, burning his tongue some.
“Tony, I told you I would take care of it,” Obadiah said, standing up this full height. He was much taller than the inventor, using his height as a tactic of intimidation.
“No no, it’s good. We will manage,” Tony remarked, handing the man at the counter his card. “Everything is to go on that. Don’t let him try giving you his card,” Tony said, pointing his thumb back at Steve.
And yet, here they were.
Steve’s body was lax, heavy as Tony held him up. It was when Steve seemed more alert and his breathing regulated, did he let go of Tony’s hair, arm falling like lead. Tony leaned down and kissed the blonde’s flush cheek. He was shaking with anticipation. He needed to come so bad it was painful. The super soldier moved to turn on his back then, slow and languid as he stared up at Tony from the new position. He reached forward, took Tony’s hips, and pulled him close, knowing the man was a mess. Also, Tony was basically whimpering at the loss of heat from Steve’s body.
“Why not? If you’re falling for the guy, you’re not gonna get anywhere with you being a love sick puppy,” Rhodey remarked, leaning his elbows on the table.
Steve slowly walked over, sitting on the coffee table in front of Tony. “Tony, I’m-”
Steve knew he was going to have to speak with Tony also, and hear what the brunette had to say about everything. He just didn’t feel like dealing with it tonight.
He could feel one of Tony’s hands slide around to his bum, his hand gripping a cheek and not letting go as Steve gasped and leaned forward to kiss the man while also sticking his rump out, an invitation for Tony to keep up what he was doing. Tony growled against Steve’s mouth, biting the blonde’s lips and squeezing hard on Steve’s gorgeous ass
“Gorgeous,” Tony breathed, practically dropping the spatula he held.
The blonde didn’t really know what to say for a minute, only wishing to wrap his arms around Tony and hold him close, keeping the man safe from his own worries and fears. He couldn’t though, and so he waited till Tony flickered his gaze back to Steve.
"Tony," The man said quickly, taking off his sunglasses with his free hand. "Call me Tony." He dropped his hand then before taking a step into Steve's apartment.
He just needed time.
“You’re always good for me, love. Always,” Tony said, drifting the back of hand down one of Steve’s cheeks. Steve nuzzled into the man’s touch before finally pulling back, sitting back onto Tony’s length once more. He clenched his thighs around the genius’s sides, lifting his body before sinking down onto Tony who angled his hips, his erection now brushing Steve’s prostate.  Steve outright moaned, loudly quickly rising back up only to fall back to meet Tony’s bucking hips. He wanted more of that sweet electric bliss when the engorged head of Tony’s penis nudged against the bundle of nerves deep within him.
“Let me,” Tony bit out, reaching up and caressing his hands over Steve’s firm pectorals as he started to roll his hips up into his lover with renewed fervor. Steve was beside himself with absolute euphoria while he bounced on Tony’s cock, the swollen head nudging at his prostate. He held himself upright, keeping his hands on Tony’s sweat laden chest.
“You know,” Tony started, thumbing at the creamy lace that nestled under Steve’s defined pecs. “I’m pretty sure Natasha got a glimpse of those when we opened presents earlier,” he said, nodding to the anal beads on the bed. He had expected Steve to blush in embarrassment, but the super soldier merely laughed, shrugging as if it weren’t a big deal. The brunette didn’t think it was a big deal either, but he wanted to get a small ruse from his boyfriend.
“We woulda saved them even if you didn’t catapult yourself into that alien beast’s mouth,” Tony snapped, fiddling with the black under suit he was wearing. “We had a strategy and you went against it because you had to be some big hero or whatever.”
“If you really don’t want this apartment, you don’t have to accept it,” Tony crooned. “But would you accept me, Steve? If our affections match, and you feel as strongly about me as I do you, do you think we could have this?” Tony asked, gesturing a hand between him and the blonde.
Tony didn’t have a chance to stave off his orgasm, his seed spilling from his length and into the blonde’s mouth. Steve swallowed the ropes of come easily, his eyes pinching shut in concentration. The super soldier pumped Tony’s erection with his one hand, wringing the man dry.
Steve was getting hard yet again, and he wanted his boyfriend to partake in the pleasure he already had experienced twice, and craving it still. So, Steve got himself into position, eyes never straying from Tony’s as he seated himself onto the genius’s arousal. Tony shut his eyes and inhaled sharply once Steve was all the way down, the brunette planting his feet into the mattress for leverage, toes curling in desire. Even though Tony had worked him rather loose by this point, Steve still felt like could be torn apart by how big and hot the other man was inside him.
“Don’t try and deflect,” Tony teased, wiggling his finger at Steve through the screen. “But hell yeah I did! Steve, you could read the dictionary and I would probably get turned on by watching you do that,” Tony chuckled. Steve just shook his head and rolled his eyes good naturedly.
The genius eventually stilled his love’s hands, taking them in each of his own and kissing Steve’s knuckles. The blonde hummed in enjoyment, feeling the scratch of Tony’s beard on his skin. The brunette kissed his way then up Steve’s forearm and to his bicep and shoulder before pulling the super soldier closer to him. Tony could feel Steve melt a little more with each press of a kiss, and the genius couldn’t resist nuzzling in the crook of his boyfriend’s neck, rubbing his facial hair there. Steve squealed out a giggle as Tony tickled him, the brunette laughing too. Tony did show clemency to his love though and replaced his tickly beard with soft kisses to Steve’s fair skin, soothing the flesh that was reddening there with little licks.
“Don’t worry, you’re gonna be in nothing but your birthday suit before you know it,” Tony chuckled, sensuously sliding his hands down to grab at Steve’s luscious ass. The blonde gasped, pushing his rump back in delight. Tony gazed at his
“Love you so much,” Steve said, leaning down to kiss Tony’ arc reactor, the cool blue light slightly warm against his kiss-bitten lips. “Thank you for the lingerie, and for accepting me.”
“So, did you like your Valentine’s Day surprise then?” Steve asked tiredly, eyes gently closed as he kissed Tony’s collarbone. The brunette could only laugh.
Tony followed him to a row of empty seats, though soon enough there wasn’t an open seat in view. “Good evening, everyone.” The blonde woman said, smiling cutely to the crowd. Tony merely rolled his eyes. Soon, the lady began her speech on Agent Margaret Carter. Tony’s jealousy didn’t dissipate, the green eyed monster stewed and roiled within his gut. Of course the woman was pretty and seemed nice enough, but she wasn’t Tony, so obviously she wasn’t good enough for Steve.
Also, there are a few past quotes in Italics that are from the second installment, "I Wanna Taste Her Lips: Tony's POV"... Incase you haven't read that one, Just know Pepper told Tony those things during their breakup ^-^
“Mmm, I like hearing you say my name all desperate and flustered, babe,” Tony remarked, and the next Steve felt was the man’s mouth on his, almost crashing their lips together as he captured every one of Steve’s moans.
“Morning, Cap,” Tony began, smiling warmly at him, though his eyes were probably dull with tiredness as well. “Nothing’s wrong. I just wanted to swing by before you headed out for the day,” Tony added. Steve just looked at him, eyes squinted, his hair splayed every which way. He looked like an unimpressed kid, woken up early for school. He even had those plaid flannel pajamas, where the shirt buttoned up and had matching bottoms. How could a grown man look so boyish?
The genius did his own research on the matter, he had a hunch of what the warm mark on his shoulder meant. He had J.A.R.V.I.S bring up the results for soulmarks and the first few articles confirmed his inkling: Scientific journals came up about them, how they are formed and why. Some of it was hypothetical, but the theory was basically the same across the board. The genius even looked at a few pictures of these soul marks, some were modern, and some were in old photographs. Though they were all varied in placement, there was that similar circular red spot that was just slightly raised.
Steve couldn’t wait anymore, he wanted Tony, needed him. And so, he reached back to grab Tony’s sides, pulling him closer and feeling the head of his penis nudge against his opening. He heard Tony curse, and Steve moaned at the feeling of just that little bit of pressure from the brunette’s cock.
“I’m not gonna feed your ego whatsoever,” Steve replied cheekily, reaching to grab his plate and coffee mug. “Hungry? You can have my plate.” Steve offered.
“Pretty good, “Steve said, opening his container, the smell of garlic wafting in the air.
The beeping of the monitor startled Tony from his vision, and he blinked a few times, his surroundings shifting back to the present. Tony instantly observed the monitor, looking at Steve's vitals. They were stable, and the genius gave a sigh of relief. He scooted his chair closer to Steve's bed, and with a shaky breath, he reached out a hand, entwining his fingers with Steve's. His sight blurred from unshed tears as he watched the man sleep, his dark eyelashes gently splayed on his cheekbones. The blond had an oxygen mask on, but the brunette could see his pink lips barely part as he breathed softly.
The next morning, Steve was busy at the stove in the communal kitchen of the tower, Natasha cooking up a vat of scrambled eggs while he flipped pancakes in the skillet.  He was much chipper than he had been in the last few days. Tony would be home in just a couple days, and they had cleared the air between them. Steve felt that they could start off fresh as a couple.
"You were walking through the ancient era exhibit, turned white as a ghost and-" Natasha explained before Sam chimed in
“I always am, Pep,” Tony replied with a small twitch of his lip, an attempt at a smile.
“Kinda wish I could keep you like this, though,” Tony whispered, his eyes gleaming with mischief.” You’re so compliant and stunning this way. Steve imagined how he looked in that moment, desperate and lust driven, wriggling under Tony’s sensuous touch, hungry for more.
“It’s been hard though, I am not gonna deny that,” Tony whispered, kissing Steve’s forehead then. “If it’s not Avengers business, it’s me having to travel for Stark Industries.” Tony leaned back and pouted, his eyes meeting the super soldier’s. “We haven’t had much time together lately.” The blonde nodded in agreement as Tony took his love’s hands in his own.
Thor beamed at that.
Steve plunge into his mouth as Tony gasp. Pressing Tony down the seat. He held onto Steve collared shirt. It crossed his mind that he should fight him. Weren’t they upset with each other?
They’ve knocked, no answer. Bucky tried the knob; the door was unlocked. Steve grinds his teeth at the carelessness.
Also, I wanted to put out if anyone has any time to help beta this? I do try to proofread and edit, I’m terrible, I would like the help. I just need someone that doesn’t mind, pretty much mpreg and whatever else my mind comes up with. Not into abuse or rape so don’t worry about that. Need someone who has the time and patient. Maybe help when I get stuck? Please message me on here, thank you!
*****
He was on edge when anyone was close to him. When anyone that was not
Clint continued, “Hands above the waist. No playing footsie.” Steve couldn’t hold that laugh.
The picture Tony held was him kissing Aunt Peggy cheek and the delighted look to her eyes.
Though what was much more awe taking, was the huge tree behind it.
It was then three men walked in, loudly. A blond—with bright, blue humor-filled eyes, with a nice trimmed full beard. And he was huge, he strolled toward Loki, invading his space.
Her lips twisted in humor as Tony gotten her full attention. “Flirt,” she gave a breathy laugh.
He ignored Steve and turned to Loki, “So, those two?”
With that Odin exited. Thor behind the old man with Natasha close behind.
This place was something else.
“Anthony!” Thor enthusiastically shouted and made a grab for Tony’s’ arm and brace his forearm, Tony did the same with a raised brow. “It is a pleasure to meet you!”
“I could always hire someone to go…” he mused.
Her face brightened.
The ground floor had only one bedroom and bathroom—where Tony slept last night. It had a nice view out back, looking into the forest. Upstairs, where his friends took, had two bedroom and bathroom.
She took her sunflower glasses off. Her amber eyes twinkled, “Oh he is. But I know for a fact that it is not food.” She winked. Tony eyed Steve and the big guy ears were red. Oh, how cute! He let out a laugh.
They fell asleep side by side, curled into each other.
Tony returned to the homestead. Oh yes, Tony for the time being was going to think this place as such.
All three burst out laughing, getting the other two deputies’ attention. Seeing from their badges.
Steve moved a hand, rubbing his face down to his full beard. His blue eyes sliding to Clint, Rhodey and falling on Tony. “You three should take a seat.” He directed to the couch that collapsed at that moment. “Thanks, I think will stand,” Tony snarked.
“So, what’s this stranger name?” Steve was all business.
“Other than the peculiarities of our small-town people. What brings you here father?” Loki switched gears and turned to Odin.
He heard children laughter, as they got a better look of the tree. Children were around the tree. Some trying to climb it, others running around, and many touching it with awe clear on their face.
Yea right, who would believe that. But coming from this guy—it felt
“You know quite a bit on weakness.” Steve lip quirked up. Tony was good at catching some important details. “Like I said before, I wasn’t like this.” He motioned to himself. They lean closer, their arms on the table. Their plates cleaned off. Tony fingers moved up and down the stem of the wineglass. Some lights were off, the candle their main light.
There’s always some urge to fight or do something with their abilities. But Steve just wanted to help. Tony could see how good a leader Steve was. How his friends followed his command. How he talked to the Asgardian. They knew Steve; the kids knew him and were comfortable with him.
Muffled but heard, “Thanks” his voice cracked.
Tony cleared his throat, “Well, there’s one thing I like to know.” He looked to where everyone was. His friends vanished with Natasha earlier. Steve and Bucky were busy with more kids besides the pups.
Also there is an intended classic cameo ;D
“Is this alright, babe?” Tony asked, realizing he probably should have asked Steve before he’d started altering his position.
Steve was beside himself with pleasure, the head of his erection almost purple as it leaked a stream of precome onto his stomach. The way Tony’s mouth and tongue roamed over his entrance and perineum was indescribable, and Steve couldn’t help but whine and pant the entire time as he tried to hold off from tipping over the edge. It was then that he felt Tony’s tongue finally slip into his opening, the slick heat of it swirling in against his snug channel. Steve shut his eyes feeling all that Tony provided him, his mind wandering to the image of Tony’s face buried in his rump, his tongue skillfully licking his entrance, making the blonde a writhing mess. It was then, when Tony caressed his hole, his tongue hooking up into Steve’s body to loosen his rim that Steve’s orgasm hit him. Tony’s name tumbled from his lips as his seed spilled on his belly, tricking into his abdominals while Tony continued to lap at his hole.
It was about an hour later, when Tony had made progress with some of the underside rust, that he heard J.A.R.V.I.S call him, though he couldn’t hear the A.I. from where he was under the body of the car.
Tony’s elbows bracketed Steve’s head, one of his knees between the blonde’s legs. He stared down at Steve, his dewy brown eyes locking with his. Steve couldn’t look away, his azure eyes searching for something, wishing for all the things he wanted to tell Tony could be simply said in his gaze. The snow had begun to fall gently, peppering Steve’s hair and lashes.
"When I am around you, my mark burns, and a yearning for you engulfs my mind, body and soul, wanting us to be close," Steve conceded. "I know this is new, eccentric, and uncharted for both of us. But I needed to tell you. I wanted you to know, for both our sakes." Steve waited for the other man to say something, but Tony was quiet, clearly pondering something. Steve felt a wave of anxiety hit him and he was ready to go back to his quarters when Tony finally spoke.
So, with two fishing licenses, poles, lures, bobbers, three different baits, waders, and some random supplies piled on the counter, Jerry rang them out.
Tony placed a hand over Steve’s though, stilling the blonde’s motions. “I was wondering, love,” Tony began, clearing his throat and meeting Steve’s quizzical gaze. “If you wouldn’t mind leaving them on… for me?” He asked, his voice soft and breathy.
The brunette’s body was tense, Steve’s warmth engulfing him in heavy heat. And the sounds the super solider made as he was stretched was driving Tony wild. The chocolate didn’t make for the best lube; Tony wasn’t gonna lie. But damn, he and Steve would have both been in pain if they hadn’t used it.
“For the hundredth time, Tony, I had to act! I wasn’t gonna let that creature eat those people on the street,” Steve remarked.
having too much stuff to do.
“Oh,” Tony smirked, the fingers of his one hands carding into the cropped hair at the back of Steve’s head. “Just thinking about how even with morning breath you’re still the most beautiful man I know.” Steve just gave him a playful glare, flicking Tony on the chest.
“Ah,” the super soldier gasped, arching his back and pushing his bum into Tony’s grasp. The genius slid the fabric down, letting the panties fall around Steve’s ankles, humming to himself as he guided Steve’s defined thighs apart.
“There,” Tony said, bracketing Steve’s body with his hands as he loomed over him a bit possessively. “You’re so beautiful, you know that?” Tony remarked, pressing a kiss to Steve’s cheek. Steve held Tony securely around his back, beaming up at Tony.
“And I truly love you, Steve.” Tony replied. And oh, how he meant those words with all his might. Hearing Steve’s heavy breathing, knowing the man had drifted to sleep, Tony allowed his eyes to close as well, reveling in this blissful state with his Steve. It was in this room, when Steve wasn’t Captain America, and Tony wasn’t Iron Man, the moments where everything was stripped away to just their two souls. That was what mattered in the end of it all. It was moments like this that Tony cherished the most.
“Love?” Tony started, crawling up beside Steve then. “You okay?” The genius brushed a few blonde strands off his love’s sweaty brow before sinking his hand downward, gently grabbing at his boyfriend’s plush bum. Steve turned to look at him, smiling almost shyly at his lover before speaking.
“Then you will do right by complying and being a good little fish. No more fighting or I will blast you and your pod to high heaven. You hear me?” Obadiah pushed the gun further into Steve’s head, making the creature hiss at the cold hard metal pressing into his skull. “Answer me, I know you understand what I am saying to you,” Obadiah roared.
“Look at me, Steve,” Tony said, his voice hinted with a commanding tone. And Steve did, pulling his eyes away from where they were joined to meet Tony’s gaze. “Don’t close your eyes.” With that, Tony pulsed his hips with an emphatic force, his seed spilling freely into Steve’s channel. Steve didn’t look away, the sensation of the man’s hot release and the beauty of Tony’s face when pure bliss washed over his face was all Steve needed to come as well. His body clenched painfully around Tony, his mouth open as he elicited an explicit moan before fusing his lips to the brunette’s, drinking in the genius’s own pleasurable cries.
Steve and Tony settle some miscommunication errors as per usual with this couple XD and then sexy times.
“Oh God,” Steve rushed out, leaning in against Tony once the man was fully sheathed inside of him.
With a wing and a prayer, Tony leaned forward, tenderly laying his hand on Steve's chest, right above the bandage that protected his wound. He moved his fingers to the soulmark, he hissed at the sudden discomfort, emotions flooding his very being. Taking in Steve's pain, he tried to ease the super soldier with the comfort only he, the soulmate could give.
As the last pancakes finished up, Steve turned off the burner, flipping the flapjacks onto his plate and taking up the rest of the eggs that were left in the pan. He went to grab the mug of coffee Thor left on the counter next to him when he sensed a presence behind him. Before he could turn around, he felt two strong arms wrap around his waist. Steve broke out into a toothy grin, placing his hands over the ones resting on his belly.
“I wasn’t contacting you a lot because I didn’t want to distract you from your priorities, which are your meetings,” Steve responded, his voice tight and irritated. “Didn’t want to be so attached that you would feel smothered and confined. That’s why I was giving you space, Tony.”
When the brunette pulled away for Steve’s round, muscular pectorals, he nosed his way up to Steve’s mouth, kissing the super soldier quickly before his hands slithered back to where the corset ribbons were, and he let his fingers slip down each and every lacing that crisscrossed down Steve’s defined back. It still astounded Tony, to see such a strong, masculine man such as Steve look absolutely striking in delicate, feminine garments. It was the perfect balance though, the way the silks and lace molded over chiseled muscles and the defined contours of Steve’s frame. They were the perfect complement to each other.
“Steven Rogers-Stark…has a nice
"They're memories. I've had them too, Steve." The blonde turned to look at Tony, his body halfway toward the door. Tony strode toward the other man until they were inches apart. Tony showed the super soldier his mark too, on the other shoulder though, as if they mirrored one another.
Tony could feel his erection straining against his jeans, the pressure just too painful to ignore. Not daring to look away from Steve caressing his body, Tony blindly unlatched his buckle the rest of the way from what the blonde had started earlier and undid his jeans. He almost fell off the bed in the process, getting the fabric over his knees before throwing them to the floor, belt buckle jingling.
“He could say no and avoid me for the rest of his life,” Tony muttered, looking at some of the other guests in the restaurant. “I don’t want to ruin our close friendship by trying to make it something more. I just can’t risk that.”
“I’m good?” Steve mumbled, an incredulous tone in his voice. “You’re so good… and too good to me,” Steve added, turning his cheek to look at Tony who had settled next to him.
“What’re you up to?” The blonde asked, grinning. Tony responded by rolling to the side table, grabbing one of the many different lubricants that were harbored inside.
“And why would I want to stop touching you?” Tony challenged, smirking darkly and reaching back up to rub Steve’s arousal.
Here they were, enraptured with each other as Steve looked down at him, his chiseled features faintly highlighted from the arc reactor glow. Steve leaned into Tony, their chests flush together before he laid a breathtaking kiss to the man. Then the blonde began to fiddle with Tony’s belt, only for the brunette to still his hands.
“I’m not made of porcelain, Tony,” Steve huffed as the genius penetrated him deeply. “Don’t you want me to feel you in the morning?” He challenged, digging his short fingernails into Tony’s bum, encouraging him to go harder. Tony did just that, fisting the sheets and ramming into Steve. “Yes, just like that,” Steve moaned, spurring Tony on, knowing Tony needed this, needed to satisfy his sexual hunger.
“I love you,” Steve murmured, eyes big and blue and full of meaning. Those three words hit Tony like a wave crashing upon the sand, his chest filling with butterflies. He smiled widely at Steve.
Steve watched the man who had freed him as he was led away. The merman silently pleaded for the man to turn around and come back to him, for he was the only human who had shown him kindness.
Regulating his breathing, Tony slowly opened his eyes, his orgasm causing him to see stars for a moment. He pulled his finger free and grabbed his shirt to wipe his hands on. He watched Steve all the while, the man’s chest heaving and glimmering from his sweat and come.
"Y-yes," Steve replied, not expecting Tony to be so open to him suddenly. "I cannot say I have ever had such emotions and feelings for another man before."
“Mhmm,” Steve replied, leaning into the brunette’s space and nuzzling against him. “Apparently, it’s wonderful foreplay…feels like a massage,” he explained, pressing a whisper of a kiss along the side of the genius’s neck before sitting back once again.
“Good night, Tony.”
And yet, Steve still got hurt.
“Nope,” Steve said simply, grabbing up a grey and brown fishing pole.
I wanna taste her lips, yeah, ‘cause they taste like you
“Mmm, Captain, a little anxious aren’t we? I do have that effect on a lot of people though,” Tony said, reaching to Steve’s front to stroke the super soldier’s growing erection. Steve just rolled his eyes and smirked, shimmying out of Tony’s enticing grasp.
Steve was absolutely ruined by the way Tony fucked him, his boyfriend knowing just how to leave him reeling. He held onto Tony’s hand that was toying with one of Steve’s hard, pink nipples, keeping it there as Steve’s other hand reached back to latch into the brunette’s thick hair.
Steve sighed to himself then as he stirred a spoon in his coffee mug, watching as the cream dispersed and lightened the dark liquid to a light tan. A similar color to Tony’s taut and warm skin. Steve’s pout intensified then. Even something simple as a shade of brown reminded him of his boyfriend of five months.
I promise these two will make amends. PROMISE!
“That’s a bit of an understatement, don’t you think?” Tony smirked, helping Steve turn over to face him. The blonde was so beautiful, his fair hair in disarray, blue eyes bright, lips red and puffy from Tony’s own. Tony snuggled close to the super soldier, a hand slipping down Steve’s messy belly.
Muted voices wafted around Steve, the man slowly opening his eyes as the eye adjusted to the lighting in the room. He recognized Natasha and Sam hovering over him, both helping him sit up.
“You haven’t, you didn’t come yet,” Steve remarked then, wide eyed.
The brunette refrained from bucking into Steve, not wanting to be too rough too fast and cause his love to tear. But dammit, Tony wouldn’t deny how overwhelming all this was, Steve being so hot around him, his channel tight while he looked like a ravaged mess, his beautiful chest heaving, his red, fully aroused penis oozing white precome along his belly. And the noises the blonde made, so sweet, breathy and sultry were slowly undoing Tony’s mental strength to keep it together.
He’d managed to work a half of a finger into himself, the tight drag sparking liquid heat through Tony’s body as he pinched the base of his cock, not wanting to unload before Steve. The genius watched Steve pluck at his nipples while thrusting his fingers deeply into his ass, each time brushing against his prostate. God, seeing Steve ride his own fingers was fucking heaven. He wished he could have watched Steve all night long. But Tony honestly couldn’t hold back any longer.
Opening his legs, Steve guided Tony back into him. “Go ahead, love,” Steve said softly, eyeing the man and smiling tiredly. That was all Tony needed to let go, bracing his hands on either side of Steve’s head. He began to thrust into a rhythm once more, not being as gentle as the last time though. He pounded into Steve, brutalizing his ass. Rolling his body against Steve’s, feeling the glide from the purple silk, Tony couldn’t help but feel the man’s penis hardening once more. He chuckled to himself; yep, three orgasms. Steve probably could go more, they just never tried. They should, though, someday. This was an important discovery!
Closing his eyes, Tony allowed himself to be taken by the sensory of touch and sound, his and Steve’s moaning forming a tune unique to their love story.
“No, Tony,” Steve replied sharply, instantly feeling bad for using such a harsh tone. The brunette quit his movements, and Steve could tell Tony was both hurt and irritated. “Sorry, love,” Steve cooed, moving his head, trying to catch the other man’s eyes. He really couldn’t do much else, what with his hands tied to the headboard and all. “I didn’t mean to bark at you.”
“Are you trying to use a Captain America tone with me
“Thank you, Tony, for all that you did back there...on the deck. You have been the only one to show me kindness. Well, I presume the doctor who patched me up must be quite considerate too,” Steve responded, eyes cast down a moment before they flicked up to the man’s own deep irises.
He helped guide Tony to the edge, wanting them tip over at the same time. He clenched around his love, creating a heavy friction when Tony pushed inside him. The brunette bit his lip, groaning loudly as his rhythm lost cadence. Steve watched Tony’s face, his pants quickening, the tight coil in his belly about to unwind. Tony’s movements were voracious, filled with need, causing Steve’s lingerie to fall off one of his ankles, the garment dangling around his foot. Tony then slid a finger back against Steve’s rim, already stretched tight from the brunette’s cock. He felt Tony prod at the slick muscle, only to then hook that finger inside Steve’s hole, stretching him even further as the swollen head of his large cock fucked against his prostate. Steve had lost all senses beside pure ecstasy, his orgasm blindsiding him, his whole body lurching in against Tony’s as loud sensual moans escaped his lips as bliss washed over him.
A young man approached the counter then, popping behind it to assist them. “Evening, gents,” He greeted them, smiling so wide that Steve thought his freckled cheeks would crack. “Checking in?”
“The headlines, they said there must be a new person in your life. And I recognize we’ve not stepped out together yet.” Steve stopped, feeling warm tears trickle down his face. He hadn’t even realized he had begun crying, his emotions wearing him absolutely thin as he let himself be vulnerable in front of the only man who had the privilege to see him cry. “Tell me, Tony,” Steve whimpered then, looking at the brunette. “Have we parted so much that you found solace with someone else?” Steve grimaced then, swallowing that ever present lump in his throat. “Have you fallen out of love with me?”
Eventually their friendship grew into a romantic relationship. It was a little awkward for both of them, neither of them being with a man before and Steve not being well versed in the bedroom in general. They stumbled like any new relationship, but made it work. They were still learning things about each other, what made the other tick. And boy did Tony know how to get him all hot and bothered. It was a problem for Steve, it was as if he was heightened to everything surrounding Tony. The way he would casually smile at Steve, or gently touch his shoulder or bicep as he walked past him. It was the little things that made the blonde ache for his boyfriend. Or, Tony would out of the blue pin Steve against a wall and delve in for a hot and passionate kiss, his tongue searching inside the blonde’s mouth while his hand reached around to squeeze at Steve’s bum. Then, when Steve would try to pull away and ask for them to head to one of their bedroom’s Tony would back off, give him a playful grin and walk away, leaving Steve gasping for air, an uncomfortable tightness in his pants.
