of us time. I don't like this whole taking-ten-minutes-to-get-prepped thing. I want you nice and loose at the end of our two hours."
"They look like some sort of beads?" Steve hummed, lifting them from the box.
Bucky tossed his cellphone back onto the nightstand, gently turning over in bed as not to disturb Clint in-between him and Nat.
"I need t'wrap Daddy's giftie," he whispered.
Steve gave another smack a bit harder, soothing it with a hand.
Tony sent back his love in waves, turning to the young woman that opened the door; a petite girl with blonde hair beckoned them in, shaking their hands.
"We can do that. I could probably do mine in a silver to go with your gold. And I'll put it in the same lettering since this is a Victorian house." He smiled back, practicing the writing to use for the mural. "This will be great when it’s done. Our own stamp on the place."
Tony clicked his phone off, turning and smooshing himself back into Steve's chest.
"Fuck," he breathed, giving himself a second to adjust.
"He sure does, baby," Tony replied softly, sticking the straw in Pete's juice box before handing it to him, "I bet you're going to get a lot of gifts this year, since you've been so good for Papa and I."
He grinned, biting his lip to keep from laughing.
Steve hummed a soft purr at the sound of that, sending Tony a smirk. "Oh, we'll definitely talk about all that tonight. But before bed when Peter is asleep and the others are in the guest house." He explained, turning to kiss Tony before entering the dining room.
"Don't lose your patience." Steve warned, running his hand down along Tony's back and slipping the boxers off.
Steve helped get Peter's stocking down, raising his eyebrow softly at Tony's wink, grabbing his stocking as well as his husbands. He brought it over to Tony, watching and waiting to gauge Tony's reaction.
"Not too much sugar before bed, and make it last," Tony chuckled, "And save it for after dinner, squirt."
?" Tony reached down to cup Steve through his pajamas, nipping at his pulse point.
Steve ran his nails down along Tony's chest as he could feel pleasure building up in the pit of his stomach and thrumming through his body.
Tony's words got lost in an unintelligible string of moans. He was completely focused on the pleasure rocketing up his spine, but he could feel the pain slowly start to overtake him.
"I'll say. But we can take a day to relax though now that we know that shrimp is not good and we don't have to worry about allergies." Steve answered softly, kissing the top of Peter's head as he cleared the table.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down, Steve. It's okay!" Tony tried to assure, walking over to Steve and pulling the man into a gentle hug. "I appreciate that you wanted to say thank you, and I'm not mad. I just thought that there may have been a fire and
As expected, Steve did swim towards the humans. Well, towards that specific armor-clad human. Specifically towards where he left him in the sand. The armor was too interesting not to try and see again. And that blue light... Beautiful. It was something Steve would only think of in dreams and marvel at the thought.
Steve stifled a snicker and turned to finish the lunch.
BUT NOW I AM FREE AND HAVE SOME MOTIVATION BACK!!!
Tony snorted, leaning over to press another kiss to Steve's lips. "Hey now, no need to get all sad on me," he teased softly, nuzzling at Steve's hairline, "I'm gonna be stickin' around for a while, love. I promised you that then, I promise you that now. I'm not going anywhere.
“M'up," Tony groused, "Peter, kid, your butt's in my face, and I
Tony's voice trailed off into a series of quiet moans and groans, trying his hardest to not buck up into Steve's mouth. The blond patted at Tony's thigh, letting him know it was okay as he managed to take him to the hilt, nose lightly brushing against dark hair. Steve gave a low hum for further encouragement. Tony took the signal and slowly thrusted up into Steve's warm mouth, lacing his hand in Steve's hair.
"Might just have to wait on that, Peter." Steve sighed. "Wait until you are a bit older for that, kid."
Sorry for such a late update. I had been going through college and had lost A LOT of motivation to write anything...
Tony continued.
"Now, we need to talk to you about something that you'll get to decide to do, okay?" Steve hummed. "You don't have to decide now, but it’s your choice, okay?"
"C'mon, baby. Doin' good, c'mon." Steve panted, leaning to bury his face in the crook of Tony's neck as he thrusted nice and strong against the man's sweet spot.
"Yessir, very bad, so bad," Tony breathed, not moving from his kneeling position on the floor, "I couldn't--I couldn't help myself Sir, I just needed to touch myself so
"Here we go..." Steve hummed, building almost a nest around them in blankets. He cuddled carefully around Tony, just letting him cry and shedding a few tears himself. Steve felt for him. The best thing that they could do for now was just give time to let Tony grieve.
He smiled fondly at Peter, taking his other hand to scrub.
"Yeah, have fun with that surprise while I work," Tony laughed, opening the bathroom door to a disgruntled six year old, whose jumper was on backwards with mismatched socks.
He smiled happily, giving Steve a loving glance. "It's perfect, y'know."
Steve pulled the glass away, petting Peter's hair with a comforting hand.
He tossed the blade into the water and shut the tap off, putting his head in his hands.
"I think he's only been sick once or twice. He's... yeah," Tony tried to explain, leaving out the immune system definitions, "Now, enough chatter from you. You need to sleep this buggy away, alright?"
from ours for him. Bunk without a bottom, get a desk and maybe a little baby computer? Stuff it with toys and I can build him a hammock to put his favorite pillows in."
"Are you going to give Steve your
"R-right." Steve answered softly, cheeks slightly pink.
"Once again, I can't wait." Steve hummed sweetly, getting them on the bike and ready to go. "No doubt it will be better than the movie was."
"Shhh, it’s okay. It’s okay, just let out whatever you need to." Steve said sweetly, continuing to rub Tony's back in small circles.
Ooooh my goodness, this is probably the longest chapter in this thing, but hopefully its enjoyable :3
a turn on."
Steve nodded in response after Tony's words clicked in his brain.
"I don't want to turn into my father, Steve."
"Fank y'Papa," Peter said before grabbing a cookie, stuffing the warm treat in his mouth.
"G'Morning." He whispered, leaning in to kiss Tony. "Peter left?"
"I knows." Peter sighed, playing with the baby's fingers. "Don't mean I gotta like it all da time, dough."
"I'll get order in for paint, and I'm also thinking of getting a few things hand-made by a guy out west--"
Tony let himself be warmed in Steve's arms, closing his eyes to the buzz of skin-on-skin contact.
"He looks sweet,
"Mind? We don't mind at all, take him," Tony laughed, going for his swivel chair before grabbing his forceps,  beckoning Bucky to sit, "He loves staying with you guys. It’s totally obvious he gets away with stuff that he wouldn't here."
"The thing is, he was my first. I've never even
Steve shut the door, flipping the covers off of Tony and seeing his thighs and the blood.
"Right." Steve grinned happily, wrapping further around him and tangling their legs together again. "I love you, Tony. Love you so, so much." He said lovingly.
"What? What's wrong? What happened? Did something happen to Peter?"
"We'll do candles and stuff. The whole nine yards."
. No doubt your friends will help you. I'll sure as hell help you the best I can. I know it’s hard now, but..." He swallowed at the lump in his throat. "It gets better... It takes time, but it gets better."
"Then we'll get you a slice for dessert as long as you're a good boy." Steve teased, rubbing his thumb over the top of Tony's hand before their waiter arrived.
Tony woke with a gasp, relaxing once he figured it was Steve curling into his sides.
laughed, but he swallowed it down, turning his head so Steve couldn't see him grin.
"Oh honey, shh," he murmured, scooting over to sandwich the boy between him and Steve, "Everything's okay, you're okay, I promise."
"Pretty neat how they always swim. Always moving."
"I gotcha, babe..." He breathed, starting slow thrusts. His hands came up to massage Tony's hips softly as he moved. "Just relax for me, huh?"
Tony smiled softly at his boy and settled back into Steve's chest, letting his eyes flutter closed.
"There you go, kick your legs," He praised, grinning, "You're practically flying, Petey!"
"Great! I have to warn you though, I am currently the reigning champ for a month straight!".
"That's it. Just like that," Tony murmured. He shifted his knees up, giving himself a better angle to thrust up into Steve.
"You know you love me," Tony grunted, sliding off the stool.
He waved a hand at his flush, still pouting at himself. Steve wrapped his arms around Tony's waist gently, continuing his kisses.
Steve's late for work, Tony gets really angry at how the employer treats Steve. Also, couple-ly discussions.
"He's not Steve Rogers anymore, but yes, he lives here," Tony replied slowly, wracking his brain for
"You're right, you don't have to, but Papa and I have seen how good you are at taking care of Sammy," Tony hummed, "You'll have a break soon, pipsqueak, and we'll have a day of just us, okay?"
"All right, goodnight guys. Tomorrow is a new day. Sunday. Our rest day. We are going to relax."
Pete shook his head, slightly dozing off.
"Sure. Come in. Welcome." Steve said flatly, trailing the men for their coats.
"Just 'cuz I said a baby was okay?" Peter said a bit surprised.
"Mhm, I know," Tony replied sweetly, slipping out of his sweatpants into jeans, "You can stay in the warmth, if you'd like. The grown-ups need to go work."
"Yes sir," Tony replied immediately, "Anything you want, officer."
Tony nodded and tucked his face into Steve's neck, letting the excitement thrum through him.
"We'll get you taken care of here, then we'll get some breakfast, 'kay?".
Peter squeaked and didn't reply, opting to hunker down in his chair with an embarrassed flush on his face.
"Mean," Tony pouted, arms still around Steve, "We need to talk about what you want there. I'll have some people deliver groceries, but I mean
Steve hummed as he thought about it. "Well, we can have breakfast, and then I was thinking we could start and figure out what to do for that mural you mentioned a while back? Put our full stamp on the house."
“Soup good," Tony nodded rubbing his eyes, "Tomato?" He leaned back against the headboard, smiling weakly at Steve.
"But you said you were majoring here in Physics.".
He grabbed his phone from his pocket, shooting Steve a quick text.
"Relax, I was just picking. Your face looks like Grumpy Cat right now. But you're cuter." Steve chuckled, kissing all over Tony's face.
"Poor thing," Tony whispered, changing into pajamas before slipping into bed with them, "He almost fell asleep in the bath."
Tony ran a hand through Steve's hair, gently petting him.
"I was certainly hoping I would be able to join you." He hummed, walking over to Tony and smacking his backside. "Meet you there."
," he murmured softly, "being a domestic, married man with a son and hopefully another soon, the company's going well, I'm going to get better--"
"You catch on pretty quick." Tony said breathlessly, voice a bit husky as he let a hand trail slowly along Steve's chest. "Sure you're just a merman, and not some sort of siren trying to seduce me? 'Cause you feel pretty good at this, and that's not to be taken lightly, coming from me."
"Let it out, Petey... I know it doesn't feel good, baby." He murmured.
Sammy huffed and managed to sit up, planting his hands on Steve's chest so he stayed upright. He happily blew bubbles at his Papa, giggling softly.
Tony clapped happily, pulling his feet up into the seat.
Tony flipped over and buried his face in the futon, ignoring Dummy's sad whirs.
"Does he know how to work his computer yet, Tony?" Steve asked curiously. "You could show him that then we can read him to bed in a little bit."
noticeable when you go to work."
"That no organs were missing." She stated simply. "The way he was cut down the middle would suggest the culprit did so in order to take organs. But all are accounted for."
He shrugged, leaning his head against Steve's shoulder with a quiet sigh.
"Papaaa," Peter complained, "Fooood."
, Steve--" He only lasted a few more seconds before he came, making a mess of Steve's chest and his hand.
"Sorry that I don't provide much warmth," Tony mumbled, still rubbing Steve's back, "Go ahead, baby."
Tony flushed slightly, biting his lip. "I'll do whatever you want me to do, Sir, please let me pass--anything you want," He begged.
"Because we love each other
"...Maybe. Don't touch," Tony immediately got Peter away, scooting the boots back to collapse into their container, "It's not exactly.... calibrated yet."
Tony bit his lip and shrugged, trying not to feel guilty.
TW: self-harm, anxiety attacks
He grinned, looping his arms around Steve's neck.
Pepper gave him a confused look, brows furrowed.
"'m sorry, Papa. I'm sorry I was so mean to you." He croaked as he apologized. "I thought that if I could be tough with you, I could be tough with Flash."
"Mail. Like letters," Tony grinned, "We should put our tattoos in it, then. Whole reason we're here, right?"
Tony nodded.
"Toneeee..." He grumbled out. "Someone's knockin'...”
He turned his head and stared sadly at the wall before getting up, muttering and locking himself in the bathroom, running the faucet hot.
"I'll help you through it if it happens, baby." Steve answered back before Tony left, getting up to find his laptop and head to their bedroom. He settled on the bed and waited for Tony before he'd look up anything.
"Mmm. Yeah, maybe," Tony laughed, relaxing back into Steve's arms, "He's a brilliant tyke. Probably smarter than me, and that's saying a lot."
"Love you, love how y'feel, Tony. God..." Steve whispered back, picking up his pace a bit as he moved. He kissed up Tony's collarbone, latching on and sucking and nipping to form a hickey before trailing further down.
"Hey," he replied nervously, "I'm a little stuck, but--" One of the boots came loose and sent Tony crashing to the floor, landing on the concrete with a thump. "--Ow. I'm okay."
"Sorry, I gotta bounce. I forgot I promised I would play Test Subject for my roomate today also. I'll see ya tomorrow?".
"You're in trouble," he announced, pinching the blond's ass as he walked by to go answer the door.
Tony rolled his eyes fondly and grabbed a shirt for Steve and himself, tossing it to the blond once they got to Pete's room.
Tony rolled his eyes as he cleaned up, hanging Peter's towel up last.
"It’s okay. You're my big boy, it’s okay." He assured. Wanna watch a Disney movie instead? We could watch Atlantis or Treasure Planet? Whatever one you want bubby."
"Well, I don't think I can stand, bunny. Your turn to take care of me," Tony chuckled, letting himself relax, "Washcloth's by the tub."
Peter whimpered, but he nodded, letting Steve comfort him. Eventually, he pulled back, letting Steve stuff him into his jacket with a beanie and little gloves. "Why do y'lub Daddy so much?" He asked softly, giving Steve his doe eyes.
"Gross." Both Bucky and Peter chimed, scrunching their noses at the sight.
"That'd be a good idea, too." Steve smiled, squeezing Tony's hand back lightly with his free hand.
"So needy." Steve mused with a playful smirk, slipping two fingers in off the bat. "You don't even need to be stretched much at all. Still pretty open from last night, hm?"
"You don't poke the big bear and not expect him to leave you be, Pete." Steve stated, settling them down in bed. "Let’s get some sleep, hm?"
"I wanna watch Transforma's." Peter hummed, nuzzling Tony's chest. "But, like da really,
Steve shook his head fondly at the boy, wrapping an arm around Tony's waist.
"Oh."
"You guys all done downstairs?"
Tony's reply was a soft whimper, accompanied by his fist tightening into Steve's shirt. He nuzzled into the blond's neck, unable to help the stray tears that leaked onto Steve's neck.
"Well, I know about it now, so that promise doesn't really apply right now." Steve explained. "Either you tell me and you get that number of swats, or I just get to pick how many which is probably going to be a lot more than the times you two messed around at school."
Steve huffed softly, feeling the light suction from his lover teasing at the tip.
"That's what you've thought?" Steve whined softly, helping Tony out a bit. "You flatter me, Mr. Stark." He murmured, reaching under Tony's shirt and skirting fingers along his chest.
“Maybe," Steve grinned, adjusting to make Tony more comfortable. "Eventually you'll get a chance to find them all. Eventually."
Tony raised his head, slightly puzzled. "What’s wrong?"
"As long as you can make it there okay." Steve said carefully, pulling the sheets off and putting new ones down. "I'll get you some juice and something sugary to help you out, too. I'll get us all something so it leaves less questions from Peter."
Peter cheered, bear ears flopping on his hood. Tony laughed, going to scoot off the bed with the bear in his arms.
"You like it though, don't ya Tony?" He hummed against Tony's ears, starting his thrusts long and deep and nibbling at Tony's neck. "Like me fucking you with my huge cock, yeah?"
Peter rolled his eyes and settled down with his penguin, yawning despite himself.
"It does too," Tony complained, hands still on his face, "It definitely works."
Peter still pouted, kicking the table lightly in frustration.
"They's cute," Peter cooed over them, making squawking noises back at the birds.
He stood outside the parlor with Peter in his arms, trying to wait until Peter calmed a bit.
"No... No, this is perfect, Tony. This is more than I could have hoped. And you put so much into it..." Steve whispered softly against the genius, kissing softly up his neck before meeting him with a soft smile.
Steve dropped Peter off without a problem, thanking Bucky and Nat for taking him for the night. He didn't go into details, but the both of them understood. He kissed Peter's cheek goodbye and headed back home.
"Excellent. Definitely doing that. Makin' love under the stars," Tony murmured, gently kissing at Steve's neck.
He parked, shutting off the car but not moving, just staring off at the empty street in front of him.
when you come, I don't think Da Vinci could recreate it, like--"
. Germy," Peter giggled, reaching back out to play with Sammy's hands, "Y'gwoss, bwotha."
"Love you, too. Very, very much." Steve kissed back happily, cupping Tony's face as he heard a small gasp from Peter.
, He thought to himself, gently petting Peter's hair.
"You wanna open it, baby?" Tony offered, pulling Peter into his lap and handing him the gift.
"Your Irish is killing me," he mumbled in English, laughing as he buried his face in Steve's neck, "Don't think I can last much longer--"
"Eager beaver." Steve laughed, secretly anxious to get Peter and Sammy.
, Pete. Steve, dress your son," Tony grinned, "I'll clean the bathroom."
"As long as you know what to do--" Steve joked, giving Tony a dopey grin when their lips parted. He gave Tony one more quick kiss before heading to the wall.
Peter grumbled at that, leaning against Pepper with a tiny pout on his lips.
Tony smirked, kissing Steve's cheek while he pumped him faster, whispering encouragements.
“And poops. That’s why babies have diapers and why we go through them so quickly." Steve sighed at the baby, who just gave a toothless smile back. "And he knows we are stuck cleaning it for him. For now. As soon as we are able, you are getting potty trained, kid."
"Yessir-- Sir, please--" he arched up into the touch, moaning breathily, "Please, please, Sir, need it--been so bad lately--"
"At first, it was all words. Of course, at that age, he might as well have hit me with a baseball bat. When I turned seven-- it got sexual. It was even
"Well you're not even
Steve hummed into the contact and the closeness, wrapping his arms back around Tony with a happy hum. He kissed the top of his husband's head tenderly with a smile.
"It wuz fine a'fore! Papa jus' worries." The boy said, shaking his head over at Steve.
"Sorry, I've always wanted to try these stupid things," he chuckled, "Hurts less than a belt, more than a paddle."
Steve kneeled down to be at Peter's level, looking at his son carefully.
Howard huffed, crossing his arms.
"Sir, I am to remind you of your previous arrangement with Mr. Banner.".
feeling about certain things, because it’s my homework for my Doctor and it’s something I'm supposed to do. I'm sorry you got the tail end, sweetie, but that's all you got, and you and I both know that's no scientific basis for a hypothesis, now is it?"
He winked, moving from Steve's lips to his neck to leave a bite. Steve made a slight squeak noise at the quick bite, following Tony to the room over.
"We're coming to eat baby, promise." Steve chuckled, leading him and Tony to join the rest, "But Peter will sleep if he wants Santa to come. He doesn't show up until kids of the house are asleep."
Steve's was a bit different.
"What applies under good, exactly?" He asked with a curious undertone to his voice, remembering not to look back.
do was nod in response. Tony smirked, running his thumb over the slit in Steve's cock; he loved watching him jump, greedily swallowing him back down till the head nudged the back of his throat. Tony held him there for a few seconds before hollowing his cheeks and humming.
Peter happily sucked down his milk and finished off his cookies, licking crumbs off his lips.
good. Chewy and slightly uncooked and perfect--"
"Sammy, don't cry. Bubba doesn't feel good." Steve explained as he drove home. "But Peter, you're okay around him. People can't catch allergies from others, munchkin."
"Tatii, you did a lovely job!" Raavi praised, unclipping the bib that caught Steve's hair and removing it from the blond. "Its going to go well with some of the outfits I picked out, too. Its like you read my mind."
Bruce just left the subject alone for now. It was silent for a minute, save for Tony's slight metallic clinking as he worked. Bruce tried starting a new subject of conversation.
Clint creased his eyebrows in worry, but he nodded, reaching over to squeeze Bucky's arm.
"I know you miss them, sweetheart." Steve soothed softly. "If I could go back and fix that, I would in a heartbeat. As least we know they aren't hurting. They're someplace good..."
"Hey," Tony warned, making a face at the smirking kid, "Only I get to roll your eyes at your father."
"Fuck, S-steve--"
"Hello. I'm Steve. And I am going to guess you guys aren't really movers, hm?" He said with a half-smile.
"God, baby," Tony groaned, moving his hands to Steve's hips, "Just like that--"
"We never did get you those nipple piercings," Tony commented carefully, "You'd look really pretty with a silver ball in your nipple."
"Papa, Sammy and I are gonna go up to the artroom, and we want you to come with us," Tony hummed, petting him, "That okay?"
"As long as you come up to bed at a reasonable hour, all right? I know how you work, and coming up to bed to sleep is rare for you when you work."
He leaned down to press kisses up Steve's spine, nuzzling at the skirt.
"Have you ever heard the term 'Opposites Attract', Steve? You may be different, but that's what makes you two work.".
He slipped his hand into Steve's briefs, watching the blond writhe under him from the skin-on-skin contact. Steve let out a quiet mewl, hips wriggling with the touch and face flushed.
--!" He moaned loudly and rocked back desperately on Tony's fingers, hitting his spot over and over and over. "Yes, yes,
"Feels so good, baby. Always nice and tight for me--"
He grabbed onto Steve's leg again, sticking his thumb in his mouth.
"Peter?" He called out, looking for the boy. "Peter, where-- Oh. My..."
He pulled away eventually, sucking lightly on Tony's bottom lip as he did.
He rolled his eyes and turned his head at a small noise, seeing bear ears peeking out from the stairwell.
Once he was finished packing the little Superman suitcase, he brought it downstairs, not surprised to see Peter already finished his breakfast.
Tony made sure Peter had his little backpack shouldered-- full of games and pajamas-- and handed him Wade the Penguin before putting his own coat on, looking up when Steve came down.
, as punishment, you have to help me clean your mess." He explained. "Daddy said to do it yourself, but there is a certain process to it that you'd have to learn. So helping will do."
"Surprise," Steve said with a grin, petting Tony's hair back from his forehead. "Do you like it, love? Bruce helped me out a bit, but the idea was all me."
He looked at Peter softly, the boy keeping on his job like a good boy. Steve laid Tony down in bed and covered him up, getting some aspirin and water to help.
"That's my big boy." Steve whispered sweetly at Peter, smooching the top of the boy's head.
"Sounds great." Steve chuckled, petting at Tony's hair. "You falling asleep, already?"
"Ah, the great captain... I've been expecting you. Do come in."
"Daddyyyy!" Peter whined, "S'
Steve sat up, looking to Tony attentively as he waited for the explanation. "Spill the beans, grumble puss." He teased softly.
"Pete?" He called.
Sammy garbled as they sat down, letting out a laugh as Tony kissed his hair. His first actual laugh, not just a garble as he played with Tony's fingers.
"You'll understand when you're older, Pete," Tony laughed, stepping out once the elevator binged, "But if I were you, I'd give Ms. Sharon a mighty big hug once your brother arrives."
"Well, I like staying alive, so--"Tony laughed, leaning over to kiss Steve's cheek.
"It was an accident, Peter." Steve replied. "I am not mad at you or upset. You're okay. Don't cry bubba."
"So, we figured on the third floor would be the room for my studio stuff? That’s the bulk of my stuff, actually. And we were talking about getting a king sized bed. So would our beds now go in the spare rooms?"
"Yeah, probably wanted to go sleep with his blankey," Tony murmured back, barely able to return the kiss.
"Papaaaa," Peter complained, pouting at the tuffle, "M'not
"I won't make a mess. I've been doin' good, Daddy." Peter proclaimed, managing to get a spot of jelly on the corner of his mouth.
"Yeah, he probably won't be making full words for another year," Tony explained, wincing when Sammy crawled across his stomach to get back to Steve, "It's just how babies are, lovie."
When Steve had walked into he and Tony's shared bedroom and saw his dress uniform laid out upon the bed, he was a bit curious as to why. When he walked up to the setup to find a note beside it written in Tony's hand, he was all the more curious.
"What?" He asked.
"Papa said dat too las' night. Cuz him 'n Unca Bucky betted on yous."
"That's m'boy," Tony praised, smooching Peter's head, "Jay?"
"Are all babies so grabby?" Peter asked, looking up at Steve.
?" He sneakily, smooching up the boy instead.
“Yes. I’ve checked our entire floor, even the kitchen in case she might have been hungry and went there for a snack,” Tony explained, “You know she’s been known to try and sneak into the berries and Poffins.”
. Had his robe on, was pretending to drink coffee, tried to stay up late and work. Heck, he even said things that sounded like stuff you'd say."
He was learning every day, the simplest things to a few more complicated subjects being covered (although the latter was far and few between). When Tony would explain something in question to him, Steve in turn would tell him about his life under the waves. It was a constant exchange of curiosity and intrigue, and Tony-- Oh man, Tony; That man had the patience of a saint when it came to Steve's questions. The blond knew the most he would ask about had to be things so simple and mundane to the other, but Tony explained it so calmly and thoroughly without batting an eye.
"I know, shhh," Tony soothed, quickly spreading out the blanket and setting the basket down, "There, see?"
Steve shook his head and chuckled.
He sighed and laid on his back, wincing as he tried to relax.
"Daddy? Are you and Papa awake?" The boy asked quietly outside the door, not entering the room just yet.
"Just rack up my charges, officer," he groaned, letting go of Steve to shuck off his own pants and boxers, "Please,
Steve nodded in agreement, kissing Tony on the lips softly. "Over dinner. That sounds good. I think I might just make a quick soup. Something warm and calming for everybody." He pointed out. "Let's go find Peter, now."
He kissed gently at Tony's cheek with a hum.
"I've always been good with babies," he murmured, gently tipping the bottle for Sammy, "Ma-- She made sure I knew how to take care of them since I was seven."
"Nope, no, no no, that's never happening, we'll shift nap," Tony snorted, "Especially since I'm used to the odd hours."
"I say that sounds absolute perfect beyond perfect." Steve giggled, leaning in to capture the lips. "Spend some time in front of a warm fireplace, doing whatever we want--"
"I don' feel unlubbed," he whispered, rubbing his nose into Steve's shirt, "I jus'-- I don' wanna be left b'hind when y'bring Sammy home t'morrow--"
"I'll take a break on my next breakthrough, okay?" He offered.
Steve held onto Sammy carefully as they rode down the elevator, cooing softly at the little bundle.
Tony let Steve start to sign while he carefully arranged Peter on his hip to free up his dominant hand; it took all of ten minutes for the papers to get signed, at which Tony's heart started to pound once the nurse went into the nursery to get Sam.
"This statement is true. Peter said he was okay with it, because if they were being bad, Santa will give him their gifts." He chuckled, leaning in to smooch Tony's cheek.
"That's very sad to hear about Gwen's mommy and daddy. It’s sad when
"I can't help you like my body," Steve said in a sing-song voice, nuzzling Tony sweetly. "You rile me up quite a bit, yourself. You are very charming and seductive, and it’s worse because you know it." He chuckled.
"Shhh," Tony hummed, keeping himself firmly pressed to Steve's front, "Kid doesn't know better, and it’s not like I'm gonna suck you off in the kitchen."
"It looks fairly empty in here. not much to go on, huh?" The blond asked aloud.
"I know. It’s different when you have a kid, especially with what had been going on with Peter recently." He stated a bit breathy, leaning with the bites.
He bounced Peter as he carried him up to the art room, grabbing one of Steve's unused sketchbooks and some pencils for them to work with before sitting on the floor.
Steve nodded, admitting to his statement.
"Well, you probably could do that while I'm cooking Christmas dinner." Steve offered up, reaching to pet at Peter's hair. "And while I cook, you all can chat with me on designs if you'd like?"
"Oh my G-- Tony, I'm--" Steve stuttered, unsure of what he should do. He didn't know how Tony would react to what happened.
"Soulmate,
Steve hummed in confirmation, squeezing their hands gently.
"True, but that’s been with us around, too. Who knows what he'll do when we leave." He sighed, settling in his seat. "Just gotta hope he'll be fine."
"Yeah, yeah, otay," he mouthed off, going over to the corner anyway.
"Gross," Bucky murmured, earning another shush from Peter.
"You so little," he teased, using a tiny plastic bucket to scoop up water, "Hold your nose, baby."
Tony ducked his head, heat flaming his cheeks; he thought he hadn't spoken aloud.
"--We'll see. Of course, legally, I'm perfectly allowed to visit the child if I wish. But, with the way things are looking, I just want my child to be in the arms of willing, loving parents."
He tugged on Steve's sweats, eagerly mouthing down his pec.
"Holy hell, Steve, I'm so proud of you baby," He breathed, "Babe, you're a published author, and your art's out there--"
"Peter, Daddy's not going today. Just you and me." Steve said as he was being smooshed by both Tony and Peter as the boy bounced around.
He quickly stretched Steve up to three fingers, teasing his sweet spot before taking them out and lining himself up, slowly pushing into Steve. Steve groaned as Tony pressed in, hands moving to grasp at Tony's back as he adjusted. He nodded to give the other the okay to move.
"A nap sounds amazing right now, though." He hummed with a soft yawn. "We've earned one today. Plus I feel too thoroughly fucked to do much right now."
"Sammy?" He whispered, grinning at the baby's gurgle.
"See? You're okay."
"Sorry I'm worrying so much. It’s a vacation. We should be relaxing." He admitted. "I'm just...not used to being away from Peter like this. It'll be different."
"You're gonna need a bath this mornin', kid," he sighed.
dollar couch, not to mention the rug and wall-- when he does stupid stuff, that doesn't warrant a smack. But this--" Tony ran a hand through his hair, leaning back in his chair.
"Well now you know one of the reasons why we say not to run in the house." Steve said softly as he stood.
, "Yes, you both are tired as hell but that's
He lifted Tony's hand quickly to kiss at the knuckles, taking a breath and finally relaxing. Tony took a quick glance to smile at Steve, settling back in his seat. They drove in silence for most the way, only Elvis on the radio keeping them company. Eventually, Tony pulled off the highway, grinning as he followed the familiar roads toward the family cabin.
. I loved his cinnamon rolls, Steve. They were
Steve happily shook Tony's hand. He could tell that this was going to be an interesting project.
"I second that notion. This
"Tony." Steve said assertively, grabbing the sides of Tony's face and making his lips pucker comical. "Just calm down." Steve said calmly. "Don't think for a minute or so and just listen, okay?".
, alone time," Tony sighed happily, flopping down on the couch and pulling Steve over him, "I almost want to take a nap. A huge nap. Catch up the past five months."
"Buh he's more 'portants," he mumbled, hugging Wade to his chest, "I don't gets any time wiff you."
"Uh-huh. M'hungry, though," Peter replied, reaching up to play with Sammy's outstretched arm, "Why's you an Papa an Sammy up so early?"
"You're a smart kid, Pete," he hummed.
"If you're sure." Steve hummed, taking out the tissue paper and looking inside. "Aw, new paint and brushes," he said happily digging to the bottom.
He let himself back up against the wall, pulling Steve down to kiss him greedily. The blond kissed him back with just as much want, pressing flush against Tony and holding him against the wall with his body. His hands trailed the brunet's sides, hips rutting against hips in need.
Tony blinked. "Kid--you mean the world to me," he replied softly, "You're not some fling and fuck, if that's what you're thinkin'. I want to keep you around, if you'll let me."
"Alrighty, lemme see your booboo, munchkin." Steve said as he brought along his supplies.
the one of me on the couch--"
He covered them all up under the warm blankets, snuggling them both sweetly. "My two smarty pants."
The 2 stepped inside and Steve motioned to his side of the room.
"Ya wokes up from snorin', Daddy!" Peter proclaimed with a giggle.
"Are you kidding? That's totally going up somewhere. Probably in the lab," Tony snorted, "Unless you want to try and draw it again. I'm
playing over and over in his brain and just fueling the fire.
"Oooo, that feels
"....He was lonely?" He tried, sounding unsure.
Tony- the one he fought alongside, the one he fought and argued with, the one he fell
Snoring fairly loudly, Tony whined at the loss of Steve's heat, opting to snuggle his pillow instead; he snorted, nearly waking himself up before falling back asleep. Steve grinned at the sight of Tony all snuggled asleep, deciding he was not missing the opportunity. After drying off and getting dressed, he set up a sketch pad and pencil at the desk and began to draw up his sleeping fiancé. It was just too sweet.
He let Steve show him how to clean the paint off, but his efforts were only half-hearted, more smearing the paint around than cleaning it off. With a tiny smirk, Pete drew more with the soapy paint, spreading it back over the wall. Steve wasn't amused and simply cleaned the mess back up the right way. After he got tired of dealing with it, he took his gloves off and handed them to Peter.
He smooched the boy's cheek, only genuinely smiling when he got his first cup of coffee in front of him.
Tony rolled his eyes, getting up once the ache in chest faded.
"Howdy, Prince Charming," Tony rolled his eyes, stealing a quick kiss before grabbing his favorite mug, "Little bug should be down in a minute, he's finishing primping."
"I'm not surprised. He's been asking for that stuff since I've known him," Bruce laughed quietly, "I'm surprised he hasn't taken you to Red Light, across the bay. They've got way more selection than my place, and Tony has specific interests that he likes to get over there."
irrational."
He rolled his eyes.
"I bet you were cute when you were skinny and short. Hell,
," Tony breathed again, happily returning Steve's kisses, "We get to have story time again, and teach him or her to read and write and walk and
"Oh, you feel perfect." He praised with a careful breath as he thrust deep into Tony.
"Sshhh, Peter, it’s okay. It’s just socks and water, munchkin. Here--" Steve said softly, reaching to carefully pull Peter's socks off and toss them in the hamper.
"Fuck," Tony groaned, tilting his head to give Steve more room, "Please, god, mark me up, baby, all yours--"
With a wrench in his mouth, Tony slid himself on a skateboard under his newest project, blasting music in the small space; he ignored the grease dripping on his shirt, favoring to try and get the finicky motherboard out from the machine.
"But?" Steve responded, looking up at Tony carefully.
"Awwwe, bambi, such a sweetie," Tony hummed, pressing a grateful kiss to his forehead, "Love you too, munchkin. Thank you."
"Mhm. I'm immune to pouting, Steven," Tony grinned, ruffling his hair, "You get ten more minutes, then I'm dragging you out if I have to."
"I don't know what to do about him acting out, either. It's not okay for him to be like that, but we can't let him get away with it-- I think we should pull him out of school, homeschool him and give him an after school activity."
"Maybe I wanna see what happens?" Steve answered, raising a brow up at Tony.
Slipping his fingers out, Tony slicked up Steve's cock, sighing as he slowly sunk down. He let himself sit completely sheathed, rocking his hips with a whine.
"No, I mean that you LIKE him...?".
"You don't wanna get into the biting game with me, Stark-Rogers," Tony warned, "I will very much win."
"I ask 'who is it' because it's not like you to be this way. I don't know if you think you'll impress someone, or if you're being bullied to the point where you take out that anger on your father, but it's still not okay to do that. Now, if it's
He giggled softly, turning his head to smooch Steve's nose.
"We'll get there, love. Wanna make sure you end up a good kind of sore." He purred, slipping in a third finger and then a fourth, stretching Tony and making sure his fingertips began to brush his sweet spot.
"Ah--" Steve jolted a bit from the cold, a shiver running up his back. "Yeah, that’s cold. Really cold." He confirmed, trying to adjust. "Okay. You're good. It’s good."
"Kneel on the bed, head down, arch your butt up and face away from me. I want to see that pretty ass of yours."
"You are baby, you are, more than you know," Tony whined, shivering under Steve's lips, "God, baby, you don't know what you do to me."
He leaned back and stared at the wall, a dopey smile on his face.
He set Peter on the bed softly and sat beside him for the moment.
"I know," Tony reached over and squeezed Steve's knee, "This is just.... something he needs to learn. Okay?"
The soldier took the book with a thank you, opening the front cover and going through it page by page. Most of the drawings all seemed to be sketches of places, buildings and objects that he didn't recall. Things changed up once he got near the middle of the sketchbook. He looked at the drawings on the page, then to the man sitting next to him.
"I bet." Steve chuckled, petting Tony's hair a moment. "We'll get you all cozy for a nap when we head over there." He said gently.
"What are you doing, Tony? Who is this kid and why is he in your house calling himself a captain?"
"I can do it!" He protested, trying to pull it back from Steve, "M'big enough!"
," Tony laughed, peppering Steve's face with kisses, "You're a walking Hallmark card, y'know that?" He rolled his eyes fondly, scratching at Steve's scalp. "Thank you," he mumbled, almost inaudible, "I need the reminder sometimes."
Peter pressed his face against the glass, watching the squirmy baby.
. We’ll be so good together, I just know it." He hummed wistfully.
"You all right? Tired?" He smiled, noticing the yawn. "Betcha you'd fall asleep when we watch the movie."
"Mmhm," Tony murmured happily, feeling completely drained, "Thank you, love." He nestled into Steve's chest until he was lowered into the water, waking up slightly to clean himself off.
He smiled in the dim light, cupping his hand around Steve's cheek.
Tony used his time to clean the house and change into lounge pants, a fond smile on his face whenever he looked over at Steve sleeping on the bed. Eventually, he crawled underneath the covers, snuggling up to his fiancé and falling asleep.
"My turn?" Tony squinted up at him, "Gotta define things a little, Stevie."
"So possessive--" Steve grinned, heart fluttering at Tony's words. He moved with Tony, wrapping his arms around the younger's neck and just loving the feeling Tony gave him. "I love that you're caring to me. That you let me mother hen you even when you don't want it." Steve huffed out in a chuckle. "I love that you're a comfort to me and that--ah-- you take me as I am..."
Tony gasped, shyly nuzzling at Steve's collar. "Please Sir, I need y'thick cock in me," he whined, "I've been so bad lately, need you--"
"Hush. My
"Even Captain America and Iron Man get scared sometimes. It’s just a sign we are human." Steve soothed softly. "And accidents happen. That's okay."
The brunet twitched his hips up into Steve's hand, trying to set a quicker pace which thankfully the blond caught on to. Moans and soft 'Atta' boy's left his lips as he felt that familiar heat begin to build in his lower belly, thankful noises following as Steve continued to quicken.
"We have 3 systems, 15 games to plow through, and enough food to hold us over in case the Zombie Apocalypse comes to pass.". He tossed a controller to both Steve and Bruce as he plopped down in a bean-bag chair, handling his own controller. A big grin grew onto his face.
"C'mon, I want a glass dildo," Tony hummed, eyes zeroing in on a fairly large phallus, "Well--Steve, hon, guess what."
!" Steve said almost in unison with Peter. "Don't tell him that! He might actually believe you." He scolded.
"But of course. I loved you the first time I saw you. That stuff is special and no way I would pass it up." Tony said with a grin, leaning over to give Steve a kiss.
He rifled through the closet for his Black Sabbath shirt, sighing comfortably at the warmth of the shirt.
He choked back a half-sob, burying himself into the bed.
"If you say 'a human' Rogers, I swear to Poseidon--"
He got up from the table, making his way up to Peter's room. He knocked on the door, shifting foot to foot.
Tony whined again, scratching at the comforter.
"Absolutely ma'am. He's in good hands." Steve smiled back with a nod.
"Did you seriously quote The Losers?" Steve whispered as they headed downstairs. "We can worry about all that after Christmas. But I can't wait for the alone time." He hummed wistfully.
"People are obviously making an ordeal out of it if they are coming to me saying that my son's been gallivanting with some other guy like a 'love sick school girl'.".
"Bucky yelled at me," Tony griped, grabbing his favorite blanket off the bed and wrapping it around himself, "I had a rom-com moment and decided to run through a lightning storm to come confess my love, and now I probably have pneumonia, but that's okay."
"I'll go with whichever choice makes you most comfortable. I can deal with any of those options, honestly." He admitted.
I enjoyed myself, but I'm not opposed to abstinence for you to learn your lesson."
He rolled down his sleeves and retrieved his coat, bidding goodbye to Miss Rushman and Miss Potts and heading back out to the carriage.
"It got on you?" Tony grinned up at Steve, laughing at the look on his husband's face, "Oh my
He moaned loudly, shivers going from his spine to his toes as pleasure coursed through his veins. Steve smacked Tony's ass again with a little more force than last, but not to hurt more than a slight sting.
Tony gratefully returned the kiss, almost missing the tiny creak of their door.
"Okay," Tony whispered, "Thank you, Steve."
"Could I what, Tony? What is it?"
His moans turned to encouraging babbles, soon feeling his arousal start to build up in his abdomen.
With that, Tony cast his guilty eyes down, making off for their bedroom.
"Well den I'm jus gonna look f'the yellin's you's talkin' 'bouts," he groused, slumping back against the couch.
The first thing that happened was hand placement, the genius moving one of Steve's hands down to his waist and taking the man's other hand in his own, interlocking their fingers.
He moved along with Steve's hand for a small while longer before taking his hand away, letting the blond take over the reigns. Tony knelt back as he watched, subconsciously reaching forward to palm himself through his trousers as he observed the other; analyzing him for hopefully future romps, he supposed.
'I-- So what if I might think you are? That's not the important point here!' Steve said flustered, trying to burying himself inside of the hoodie he was wearing.
"Yeah. I'm glad I got someone hand-picked," Tony chuckled, "Makes it all a lot easier to fall into place, I suppose. Like a family, or the house, or just our lives in general--"
The baby whimpered quietly and made grabby hands for Steve, clutching at his shirt.
"Alright, so you're in the right position, now comes the actual dancing part." Tony started carefully. "Now this is probably the easiest thing dancing-wise and works the best with slow music.".
"You gotta be quiet, Sammy's still sleeping," Tony whispered, scooping up the little bear before going back to their room.
"Whatcha doing there, babe?"
"Hon, I reinforced it. It's sturdy as hell."
"Fuck," he grunted, sniffling as he turned back to Steve.
"You're sweet." Steve murmured softly, getting himself dressed and fixed up.
"S'okay," Tony breathed, wincing slightly.
He leaned up to kiss Steve and continued to pull him into the kitchen, running his hands over his hips. Steve hummed into the kiss and the touches, running his hands along Tony's back in turn.
"Oh, it'll be okay." Steve said, kissing Tony's cheek. "I'd prefer it over crying, honestly."
"M'so close, so close,
"And how exactly do you plan to do that, little bear?" Tony whispered back.
"Love you too, so much. So damn much." Steve sighed as he rocked down with Tony's fingers. He moaned softly when Tony slipped in a third finger and worked to open him further.
He snorted in laughter, leaning forward to kiss his brow.
"Tony... You didn't try to--"
"Tony, I have a few stock predictions to discuss regarding our green energy movement-- Oh. Hello." The woman stopped, looking at Steve in slight surprise with papers in hand.
He reached up to poke his bandage, almost comically looking surprised when he felt it.
"Ooh, baby, take me all in," he cooed, "Y'mouth feels so good..."
When he strode in and saw the brunette standing in the room, he couldn't help but grin. "Peggy?"
"Peter needs you. I need you and want you, so many people need you here and want you here Tony. Please--".
Tony nearly broke down laughing, having to bury his face in Steve's neck to keep from being too loud.
"Well, here's hoping the conversation ends up well. If not, I expect the biggest and fluffiest of dogs." He huffed in a chuckle. "It'd certainly be interesting. With the dog or kid."
Steve had an idea. It swam around his head like crazy as he tried to sleep that night, not leaving him be. He knew it was wrong and dangerous, crazy even, but he knew it was his best bet if it came to visiting Tony on the surface.
"Yeah baby, I'm home," Tony laughed, smooching the kid's cheek.
"Yeah!" Peter squealed happily, bouncing on the couch. "I've been pwetty good 'n Santa's gonna come and visit! He always leaves good t'ings when 'm good--"
"Yes, yes, oh
"Speedy Gonzales," Tony chuckled, rubbing Steve's back as they trooped into the house, "Peter? Kids? We're home!"
"Love you too, Tony." He murmured back gently. "I can't believe you are really making those things. You were inspired that much?" He asked quietly.
"The world is absolutely awful," Tony replied, swinging himself upright while grabbing his pipe, "How may I assist you gentlemen?"
"I'm hurrying, babe. It’s harder when I'm holding you up, too." He breathed, reaching over and grabbing for the bottle. "Gotta set you down for a sec, babe."
Steve hummed in thought for a second, trying to figure out where Tony was going with this.
Clint only laughed, waving Steve over to the truck.
--" Peter squealed and kicked in a fit of giggles, accidentally kicking his Papa in the back.
'Its fine. If you trust him, its okay.' Steve said carefully. 'What all will Raavi 'make happen', exactly?'
"We know, baby. C'mon, we're going to have a snuggle and a nap, okay?" Steve hummed, smoothing Peter's hair lovingly.
for making Peter feel like that, and then having Peter ask about his scars and he's going to have to tell him someday and he's a horrible father for doing this to himself--
With a huffy breath, Tony reached down to grab Steve's hand, pulling him off. "Want you in me," he murmured, "Don't wanna come without you in me."
"Steve?"  Tony's head poked around the corner, voice laden with sleep. He took in the picture, blinking slowly.
"I wouldn't doubt it. The food coma is a powerful thing." Steve laughed, setting everything left on table.
"They're making bread," Tony replied, eyeing the bakers through the glass, "One of my favorite things to do as a kid was grab another kid and go watch this ancient man bake bread for
Tony grinned, trooping back to the other side of the desk to grab the lube from the top drawer. He kissed Steve's nose, ruffling his hair with a quiet 'I love you'.
would. Speaking of, no sex the night before meeting your parents. I'm sure my 'thoroughly fucked' walk would make a great first impression."
"Tony, it isn't about that!" Steve called after Tony, hearing the bathroom door lock. "It’s because you felt hot and probably had a fever from stress and I didn't want to make it worse. Why do you think I would be that insensitive about your scars?!"
"I think he's still a little whooped from today. You wore him out, Daddy.".
"Oh, I'll be the one curling up to you, huh?" Steve chuckled, raising an eyebrow. "We'll see about that."
"Now, I don't think you've showered before. Have you? Or just baths?" Tony asked, unclipping Peter's overalls.
He brought the blond in for a kiss, laughter bubbling in his throat. Steve squeaked, surprised at the kiss at first but happily kissing back. Peter made a face at the kiss happening above him, but let out some giggles soon after.
"I was thinking the same, actually." Steve stated warmly, offering up a soft grin. "That's my regular here. I was going to find out what you liked and find a compromise, but it worked out, didn't it?"
"You never told me about that before. Why hasn't this happened all the other times?" He asked nervously. "Are you... Are you going to be okay? Is there something I need to do?"
Whining softly, Tony nosed at Steve's chest, letting his eyes close.
Steve quickly looked to Tony, heart sinking in his chest at the news and just the expression on the man's face.
Peter sighed, rolling over with a sniffle.
"Or not," he muttered.
"I know you do. It’s one of the only fruits I can get you to actually eat." Steve chuckled as he poured batter into the iron. "Your son knows, too. He picked them out of the fridge and suggested waffles. He knows whatcha like." He grinned.
Tony sighed and shrugged, ducking his head.
He pulled out a pair of lavender-laced panties, made of nice silk. He displayed them to Tony for the moment before looking into the box and raising a brow.
"What do you mean 'we'll see'?" Steve asked, raising a brow. "If I say I'll be good, I'll be good. That's how it is." He stated, leaning up to kiss the tip of Tony's nose.
Steve nodded agreeably.
"Am now..." He murmured. "You and Papa finish your project?" The boy asked curiously.
Steve nodded, getting up with a small grunt to go clean himself off. He then came back over to Tony's side and got him cleaned up gently. He tossed the washcloth back into a hamper and got back into bed, snuggling into Tony sweetly.
"Don't gotta tell me twice." Bucky chimed, giving each one of the Stark-Rogers a hug before migrating directly to the kitchen.
"Good." Steve reply with a soft breath, kissing Tony's cheek gently. "Thank you for sticking up for me. It was a nice thought. Now, we should get you cleaned up. I'll help you to the tub, hm?"
Peter slowly brushed his teeth, then gargled, slumping against Steve when he was done.
Steve helped adjust everything to Tony's design, getting the big part of the furniture situated. Bucky snorted and rolled his eyes, going to find the box with the hammock in it.
Steve arrived outside the room right on time, opening the door to nothing but darkness. Weird. After about a minute of searching for a light switch, the room was flooded with light and Steve was in turn flooded with memories.
Tony chewed his lip in thought, a tiny smile flickering onto his lips, if only for a moment. "I can't help it Sir, I'm too busy thinking about other things in your class," he mewled.
"Steve," he gasped, eyes flying open.
"Okay. Okay, we can have that done. It'll be a bit lonely in the bed, but'll just be a night, right?" Steve said with a small laugh, leading Tony back to their room to find three familiar faces around the bassinet.
"I guess I probably have a secret crush on you or something. Or had, because I would assume it wouldn't be secret anymore." Steve responded bashfully, rubbing the back of his neck. "At least that's what I gather from it. Sorry.".
Revelations.
Steve simply shrugged at that, helping clean up before disposing of his own gloves.
"After lunch, can we go down da slide?" He asked softly.
"You always are the clever one, Miss Potts. That is the exact one." Steve replied with a small smile.
Tony took a breath, forcing himself to calm down.
"Unless the murderer somehow managed to do it without touching the ground?" Steve queried. "Or he is extremely excellent at hiding his tracks. I vote for the later."
"Fit so perfectly. Made just for me, baby,
Tony thought about it for a second, then finally asked his question.
Steve sighed at the kisses, relaxing back onto the sofa as Tony played gently with him.
"I'll always be here for you, Tony. Especially at times like this." Steve assured, kissing the top of Tony's head. "Too much for a person to handle alone."
"I bet you are. Was a long day today." Steve hummed, ruffling Peter's hair before going to grab the bandages.
"Mmm, I know you do, baby," Tony breathed, ducking his face into Steve's neck, "I love it, too-- God, we should get your officer uniform out again--"
Steve grinned back, completely content with being a sap.
, Papa!"
Steve smiled at that, kissing Tony's cheeks in return. "Speaking of growing up, I didn't know you had taught Peter how to feed Sammy. He does really well with it."
Tony snorted at his excitement, grabbing the discarded bottle of lube before dragging Steve downstairs.
"Shh, sweetheart, you're okay, we all forgive you and it's coming off the wall," Tony shushed, scooping the boy up, "Let's get you home, okay? Maybe Papa and I will figure out a way for you to draw on the walls without it being too messy."
He pointed out the clownfish, waving at the tiny fish as they swam around.
"Easy! Its okay, Steve." The genius stated, resting hands on Steve's shoulders to calm him down. "JARVIS is just Artificial Intelligence. He doesn't have an actual form, but he has a voice. So he can see you, but you can't see him. He keeps an eye on everything for me."
"Tony..." Steve started with a sigh, forgoing the thought. He looked at Peter softly before flopping down on the bed.
He blinked, sniffling slightly as he looked up at Steve in awe.
Steve cleared his throat for the moment, uncrossing his legs and sitting up straight.
yeah," Tony moaned, leaning his head against the wall.
Tony just hummed, tugged Steve over by his belt loops and pushed him none too lightly onto the bed, crawling up to straddle his lap.
"That's because Daddy up the blockage on what you search, remember?" Steve clarified. "Can't be looking up things inappropriate for you, bubba. Be it by accident or otherwise."
"Dork," he whispered, settling next to Steve, easily drifting off.
He sighed, trying to figure out a way to maneuver himself without waking Tony and Peter so he could pull out the cookies.
There was a smack on the other side of the phone.
"God, I can't believe how much I'm in love with you," He murmured.
Tony turned off his welder, ripping the goggles off with a satisfied sigh.
"Get better," she whispered back.
"Nothing, sweetie," Tony sighed, ruffling the boy's hair, "Adult things that you don't know yet."
"Yeah. Good things it’s a list of positive things," Tony chuckled, bumping his nose against Steve's collar, "Let's get it done."
'What kind of friend did Pepper think I was?' The blond asked curiously, unfamiliar to what she had meant with the way she had said the word.
He snorted again, letting out something between a while and a shriek of pleasure.
He grinned, leaning up to steal a kiss before closing their bedroom door behind them.
"The Star Spangled Man With a Plan. Standing up for people and freedom across the nation! Unafraid to sock ol' Adolf on the Jaw!".
"Talking about it is just going to make us wanna go more. And we'll be even more anxious." Steve purred, snuggling into Tony sweetly.
"I don't like seeing him upset either, but we have to follow through with the punishment. He has to learn." Steve whispered back, stroking Peter's hair.
Tony rolled his eyes and cleaned up the table before heading down to the lab, cracking his fingers.
Steve sighed softly, watching Tony go. He wasn't going to let Tony leave down there by himself right now. He's done too much of that lately and it was the holidays, more or less. Time for being with loved ones.
"I am only helping him out with his art project. Yeah, he's a friend now and we hang out a lot, but do people have to make such a big deal about it?". Tony's voice had slight spite hidden behind those words. Howard outwardly groaned and squeezed the bridge of his nose.
Tony sucked in a breath at Steve's cold hands.
"Well, after this is sorted out and you feel a little better, then we can do that. And you'll be my big boy." He hummed, yawning softly. "But right now, it’s late."
"Ugh, y'hands are all slobb'ry," Pete cringed, rolling his eyes at the baby's coo, "Uh huh, shore, blame Daddy."
"He's a kid, he's always tired," Tony laughed, pulling his boxers on, "I'm gonna go cover the shrimp, then shower."
"I kinda want to tie you up, but I know you don't like that," Tony murmured, picking up the vibrator to lube it up, "Anything in particular you want? Or you just want to be fucked?"
"They're gonna be okay. Peter will be an angel. It'll all be fine." Steve said to himself in assurance as they got in the car. They had never both been away from Peter in so long, but he had to trust the others.
"At the end of the semester, you are to pack all of your things and get on the next plane to California, back to your mother." Howard spoke in a grave tone. "You will not be allowed back here at the college or on the campus.".
Steve slowed gradually at the decision, pulling his fingers out slowly. He gave Tony a nod, spat in his own hand, and slicked himself up quickly before lining up and pushing into Tony slowly with a soft groan.
"That's actually a really good makeup effect. You one of those 'professional mermaids' who do underwater photoshoots and stuff?" The man asked curiously, only to be met with confusion from those beautiful baby blues.
He clicked his tongue sarcastically, grinning at Steve. "How
"Little--What? What is that supposed to even mean, Tony?"
Tony was trying to hide the majority of his upset, but some of it still showed up on his face. He sighed before speaking in a low whisper.
Tony nodded, then sighed again.
"Daaadddy! Papaaaa!" Peter groaned, smacking his hand onto his forehead and shaking his head.
"You know how I feel about the ice, Tony." Steve pouted, wobbling as he followed Tony along towards the shower. "Well, we had fun while we could."
"Ah, mm..." The blond mewled as Tony worked him with that mouth of his. "Ya always have such a way with words." He chuckled, a shiver of want going up his spine as Tony flicked his tongue along the underside.
Tony smiled softly and moved the baby into Peter's lap, cuddling them both close.
Grinning, he resumed his work, eagerly scraping his teeth down Steve's cock.
"Fine then. We will." Steve harrumphed playfully, taking Sammy and heading to the kitchen. "C'mon, Samwich. We're gonna have fun in the bath and get you smelling sweet."
Peter nodded, burying his face in Steve's shirt.
Steve turned and stared curiously at the television as it turned on, leaning forward in intrigue as colorful flashing images formed and moved on screen in front of his eyes. Tony watched with amusement as the man watched the screen in wonder, asking the brunet 'How do they do this? They can make drawings move? Its like magic...'
"Oh. Right.Uh--" Tony said flustered, glancing at the bot and its circuits. "Well, there isn't a name yet, actually. I usually save the naming until I see how it--"
Peter whimpered quietly, shivering in Tony's arms. He rubbed his back soothingly, smooching the babe's temple before taking him upstairs.
"Whining gets you nowhere," he scolded lightly, slipping his fingers back up to Steve's hole, "Sometimes. I like hearing you beg for it, though."
He smirked and adjusted himself on his chair, taking another drag of his pipe.
"Well hi there." The blond grinned, looking over at the man beside him warmly. He wriggled a little closer and started to trace small shapes along his torso.
He removed his hands from Peter's ears, raising an eyebrow at the boy's harrumph of indignity.
He gently put Sammy in his lap, smooching his hands before taking them off his nose. Tony gently prodded at the skin, sighing in relief.
"All right. But it’s not odd. He's asleep." Steve point out as they headed upstairs, hands still held together.
With that, Steve left. And Tony sat alone, thinking and telling himself its just a nightmare.  Saying that like all nightmares, they eventually go away.
"How about we not talk about him when he's not in the room, considering he's listening in on us," Natasha drawled, giving the boys a pointed look.
Steve rolled his eyes, snuggling back up to Tony anyway.
He bit his lip, moving his fingers to lather shampoo into the hairs at the nape of Steve's neck.
"Oh, you can tell huh?" Steve said, raising an eyebrow. "So how exactly is it you can tell that?"
"Wanna make you feel so good, Tony." He hummed, gently running a finger against Tony's entrance.
"Yeah. Yeah, that feels a lot better..." Steve responded breathlessly, letting his legs fall now that the discomfort between them was gone. He reached up and felt a dampness on his shirt, shivering slightly from the feeling of it.
"All yours. Only yours. Only ever yours." Steve moaned, head fallen back against the blankets and pillows. "A-ah, fu-- there, Tony.
"He was actually the one who suggested it, so he might like it." Steve hummed, buckling Peter into his car seat. "We'll see what happens." He said with a smooch.
“An egg, Steven. An egg!” Tony emphasized further, sitting on the other side of U on the couch and giving Dodger on the other side the stink eye, “I have quite a few words for you later, mister. You better be a good dad and help with that egg. And you’re sleeping on the floor tonight.”
"It's funny." Steve whispered gently, glancing up at Tony. "Funny how you can be rough with me, then your touch is so gentle. So strange..."
He whined softly at Steve's teasing, watching the underwear fall apart around his erection.
"Speaking of my 'roommate', you need to properly meet the brood." He said with a grin. "Have a seat on the couch, and I'll be right back."
"Tony, I can't believe you are trying to make that." Steve huffed, trying to help Tony and rubbing gently at the knots in the man's back. "I don't know whether to be ecstatic or angry."
"Okay. I can do that," he hummed.
Tony's head shot up from where he was cursing at the
Tony waited to feel Steve's cock nudge the back of his throat before swallowing, pulling off slowly.
it was about Sarah. "I'm sorry, I've been real insensitive," he mumbled, packing up the leftovers and wiping the table down, "I was only doing what
Tony sighed and nodded, placing a quick kiss on Steve's cheek before kicking his shoes off and heading over to Peter's room. He knocked on the door and tried the handle, not surprised to find it locked.
"It might take a few months. We should let Peter get out of school and settled, and maybe talk after the holidays?" Tony suggested, "Take our time."
"Captain Rogers, you are quite the charmer. I am pleasantly surprised." Tony smirked back at the blond, eyes fluttering half-lidded as he let himself fall into the building pleasure from the touches.
"I don't think so either, baby. I'm not going anywhere," Tony replied, somehow managing to close his eyes and fall asleep.
"...Hello?" Tony managed, slightly overwhelmed.
"Yeah." Peter let his eyes slip shut, thumb in his mouth as he fell asleep on Steve's chest.
"Hey now, I hear those tones under that, he loves you just as much," Tony hummed, leaning over to kiss Steve's shoulder, "
Peter made a face, but he nodded, going back to work on his times tables.
"A-ah, babe, wait--" Tony took a breath to let himself relax and adjust, rocking his hips when he felt good.
"Well, that's why we're soulmates, dummy," Tony chuckled, closing his eyes, "Literally made f'each other."
Peter batted Steve's hand away, making a face at him before looking back at the TV with a sigh.
"Cuz ya you 'n Papa do dat
“I could look at you walking like that forever," Tony hummed, standing up and letting the water drain, "God, you're adorable." He took a towel from Steve, giving him a quick kiss.
The nurse nodded and pointed.
Steve hummed into the bites and the kiss, carding fingers into Tony's hair. "That sounds like a confession to me. I may just have to take you in for questioning." He smirked, nipping Tony's bottom lip.
Steve hummed in reply at the comparison, smiling softly over at Tony and laughing at Sammy grabbing his daddy's beard.
"He's been up since the day before last. He has been nothing but Coffee- Fueled since then. He was pulling an all-nighter working on a project over there.".
"Papa, can I go ta'y a nap?" He asked, "M'sweepy."
"Still got nine months to go," Tony laughed, wrapping his arms around Steve's waist, "But yeah, I wanna see Pete. We should have group snuggles tonight, yeah?"
The baby giggled at the kiss, hands reaching to cover his face and feet kicking a little as Tony changed him, almost like he was bashful.
Tony had gotten out of bed and was waiting for Steve in the kitchen, a cup of coffee in his hands.
"Hi Daddy..." Peter sniffled, quiet and miserable.
"Peter came down to propose?" Tony gasped, ignoring the shiver that ran down his back, "Why, Pete, I don't know what to say! Isn't this all too sudden?"
Peter turned around and shushed them all quietly. "Dis is da part where he tries ta steals Chris'mas!"
He lined up with his husband, grabbing the brunet's hips before sliding in with a soft groan.
Steve sighed softly, kissing Tony back. "Hopefully we'll hear from Sharon. She seems rather nice."
"So, do you have a name?".
"I love you," Tony breathed, kissing Steve, "I love you so much."
Steve grinned back at the boy, smooching his face. "Then that's what we'll go to do. Because I like that idea very much."
Peter shook his head, to which Tony sighed and looked down at Sammy, who happily squealed up at him.
"Alright, I'll start," Pepper hummed, crossing her legs, "His intelligence is astounding. I'd go as far to say a genius, if not farther."
slammed the bedroom door shut and locked it, hand around little Tony's throat. Screaming, Tony shot up in bed, sweat trickling down his temple. He looked around, putting his head in his hands at Steve's concerned look. The nightmares had started again, more recently with his own fear of turning into his father, especially now with the details of a surrogate on the table.
They slept well into the morning, having a relaxed and peaceful sleep. Steve was the first to wake, eyes opening to a great sight. Rays of light poked in through their window, laying delicately on Tony's face. He reached out to stroke the man's cheek in a feather-light caress.
Tony leaned down to press a soft kiss to Steve's lips, before putting his clothes back on.
"Um, no Steve. We're friends. Good friends, but not like that... Why do you ask?".
"We should build a tunnel between our bedrooms. You're right about the sex thing, let's fuck in the hallway," Tony growled, tugging Steve up and off the bed, "You're gonna be my little bitch tonight."
Tony gives a questioning noise, glancing at the old photo of him with his father with a frown. He thought he had thrown it away long ago. "That there is your grandfather. Howard." He replied, the name coming through nearly gritted teeth.
"Wow, I haven't seen Tony blush like that in forever. Good job." Natasha snickered, continuing upstairs.
"Why you ask, bud?" Tony chuckled, ruffling his hair.
He smiled at Steve, leaning into his touch.
"We appreciate that, Bucky. A lot. Hell, I know Tony will appreciate it. We will definitely use it now and then. Thank you."
"Eager Mcbeaver wants your attention," Tony laughed, standing with Sammy on his hip, "I'll clean up in here, Papa, you go watch a movie."
"Do you honestly feel that way?...After these years, do you really doubt that what we have is something special?" He whispered softly.
He tested the hammock, and seeing that it held up, stuffed some pillows into it.
Steve nodded in response, appreciating Tony's guidance as he started to make his thrusts a bit longer. He moved up and down wantonly, mewling at the pleasure starting to shoot up his spine.
well."
"Dr. and Mr. Stark-Rogers?" The doctor asked, "Please, I'm sure you're worried--"
"Ooooh, more smartass talk?" Tony rolled his eyes, propping himself up on his elbows, "I can leave you home while I go to Red Light. Keep you in suspense."
"Tony, calm down a little please. I get that you're angry, but don't get so worked up." Steve tried to soothe a bit. "He is an asshole. Everyone knows he's an asshole. I only put up with him for the paycheck and because I got chances to study the art." He explained, warily letting Tony pull him into the bedroom, "Just try and calm down a little at least?"
"So what?" Clint proclaimed. "Though some may disagree, Love is Love, no matter which way you look at it. If you have that, then who cares what other people think?".
"I gotta put Daddy's bandaids on 'im," he sighed, looking up at Steve, "So he can get bettah."
Not caring that tears were streaming down his face, Tony removed that last brick, the one that Howard had personally placed in his pocket. With a ragged breath, Tony completely bared himself to Steve, embracing his emotional nakedness.
"How come you 'n Papa is always kissin' like dat?" Peter asked curiously as he was being brought upstairs. "Those is diff'ent kissies."
"Kissin's gwoss," Peter clarified, causing the adults to laugh.
"As long as I'm your favorite." He chuckled, kissing Tony back. "And for the record, I won't be old until I'm like, fifty. I still have twenty four years and less than two months before then. So I'm good."
"His name changed? I never expected that." The woman said thoughtfully. She stepped inside, coat in hand as the door shut behind her.
"Oh my god. I'll need to get that stepstool," Tony joked, kissing Steve back, "I'm thinking gold for my lettering. Real Victorian scrawl."
Tony put the stopper in the tub, getting in before helping Steve in.
After a short while, the blond spoke once more.
Comments are always appreciated!! <3
"I know you're only seven, but you'll keep getting older and I don't like it." He hummed. "I wish you could stay my little munchkin forever. So I can snuggle ya."
Tony squinted at him, cocking his head to the side.
"W-we-- we can totally-- ah,
"Thoroughly fucked?" Tony laughed, reaching up to pet Steve's hair, "Alright, we'll stay out here. But lemme get something first."
He moaned, whimpering softly into his pillow. Steve moved over slightly to reach into the bedside table for the lube, squirting out some and slicking up his fingers.
Tony flicked his eyes over to Steve, trying to look fairly innocent.
"We understand that, Tony. We'd never want you to go straight to us if Steve is there at the time. Just would have been nice to hear from you after. Even if it were a couple of days after." Bucky said with a hum. "But the thing is that we know now, and you know that we'd be there whenever. Before or after you dealt through it with Steve."
Both boys looked at Steve questioningly, Peter shaking his head lightly.
They trooped back down to Peter's room, Tony not at all surprised to see the boy cleaned up and sitting on his bed.
"Hey now, little boy. No need for outbursts." Steve teased, scooping up the baby and the bottle and headed to the living room. "Peter, you gonna come play?"
"Well he was just born. The doctors still have to check him over and everything to be sure he is healthy." Steve explained. "He and Ms. Sharon need rest before he can go home."
Tony hung up the phone, sighing at the new messages filling his phone.
"What're you doing, Peter?" He asked curiously. "We thought you were asleep."
"Can you be the only one with homework?" Peter asked innocently, blinking his doe eyes at him.
The blond scooted to the end of the bed, reaching out to pet the top of Tony's head. "What is it, pet? What do you want?"
Steve petted at Peter's hair.
Tony sighed as his son started to sing very,
“Love you too, ya cuddle bug." Steve chuckled, kissing his cheek. "Even though I was never technically an officer."
lips," Tony lied, biting his cheek to stop from laughing, "Or Natasha, her cherry chap-stick is
Steve was a bit nervous as he grasped the woman's hand back, not letting her see the nerves however. He could tell Pepper was trying to intimidate him with the titles she gave, but he didn't let it phase him.
Steve rolled his eyes, kissing him back before starting to work on breakfast.
, Stark-Rogers."
Steve kissed back happily, feeling warm and happy all over by the time they parted.
"Yeah, probably," Tony laughed, flushing at the kiss, "C'mon, before I chicken out."
"I think I'm gonna hold off on that phone call," Tony said weakly, feeling guilt bubble up in his throat.
"Love you too, Tony." Steve hummed happily, hugging Tony close to him sweetly. He pet at his husband's hair gently. "Sleep, baby. Get your rest."
"It's real soothing," he slurred back, completely at Steve's mercy. Tony's groans were softer now, whimpering at a loss of contact.
"We do, I promise you," Tony grinned, palming the wheel as he turned onto the highway, "We have a whole suitcase full of fun things that we get to use."
"You just love takin' it slow, don't you baby?" Tony hummed, flicking Steve's abused nipple before hopping off the bed, "If you want it slow, I want you to be all pretty for me."
"We're all ready to bring your little brother home." Steve announced, grabbing the car keys. "I'm sure he'll be excited to see you, Peter. He took quite a liking to you already."
"Y-yeah, yessir," Tony gasped, scrabbling at the desk for purchase, "Love your huge cock in me, love you tearing my ass apart--" He moaned loudly, pressing his face into the cool wood while trying to keep his pleasure under control.
Peter sniffled and nodded, ducking his head against Tony's chest.
"Hope you plan on making that reality." Steve whispered fondly. "I--I never thought--
"Hey, hey. No crying, you," Tony rolled his eyes, "C'mon, drama queen, we'll go do stockings, then breakfast,
"I think it’s definitely fridge-worthy." Steve grinned happily, seeing the boy beam at the praise. "We'll put it up when we head downstairs in a bit."
"Call your husband and father a nerd. I'm appalled. Well, I'm your nerd, so you are stuck with me." He stated, sticking his tongue out.
mean sucking your dick underwater. I don't wanna drown," Tony laughed, pulling up to the cabin, "I do, however, have one of those floater-things for eight people, and it definitely has the room for two to have sex."
Steve huffed a small chuckle.
"You truly are a marvel, Doctor," He said softly.
"Y'hungry, huh?" Steve chuckled, wiping the paint from his face. "Then we better get started on that pizza, huh? You can help me put the toppings on." He offered, scooping up the boy in his arms and heading them down to the kitchen.
"C'mere, Petey," Tony called, holding his arms out for his boy.
Steve laid back down next to Tony, giving him a grin. "Oh, I look forward to it, darlin'--" he preened, kissing his lips quickly. "And I'm not a Stark-Rogers just yet. Not officially, anyway."
Tony flushed at that, nuzzling at Steve's neck.
"Stevie," Tony gasped.
He grinned, leaning against one of the kitchen countertops.
"Wantin' t'please you," Tony murmured, kicking his sweats away.
"I don't
"You are spitting everywhere, close your mouth when you chew," Tony laughed, "And don't talk with food in your mouth, silly."
Peter was quiet for the moment, shuffling for a moment in Tony's lap before he spoke.
"Sweet it is," he murmured, hooking an arm around Steve to gently flip them.
Peter nodded quietly, waiting for Steve to stand up before putting his arms up.
"We already saw, dim-bulb," Bucky snorted, "You can say 'honeymoon'. We all saw it coming." He sighed, stirring another sugar into his coffee.
"Already breaking out the coffee? And it’s not even seven." He smirked, kissing Tony's cheek before getting out the pasta sauce.
Tony stuck his hand out for a shake in agreement, which Steve took without a second thought and with a grin.
Clint snickered at that, making noises when Bucky elbowed him.
"Peggy, just listen for a second--"
Tony's head went up, startled at Steve's shaking him; he smacked his head on the bottom of the machine, groaning in pain.
"C'mon, Daddy!" Peter urged, tugging Tony along. "I want ya ta go down da slide with me!" He said excitedly.
"About a half an hour." He hummed, moving up to nuzzle Tony's chest. "So we've got a little while--".
"The cabin's only an hour and a half out," he laughed, "So we're not too far away. I had some people go ahead and stock it for us, so we don't need to go grocery shopping or put sheets on the bed."
"Cut open." Sam sighed. "From the collarbone down, along with an arm almost completely severed."
"So good, Tony. So good to me and for me--" He slurred into his words.
something I needed after my day today." The brunet said with a content smile and a sigh.
"Jerk." Steve pouted, moving around on the bed a bit with a groan. He needed something, dammit. Steve moved to run his hand down along his cock for some friction, getting his hand smacked away.
Steve ran off upstairs to Peter's room, knocking lightly on the door. Peter hopped up off the floor and opened the door, looking up at Steve.
"Just resting, huh? Well, I bet JARVIS will tell us you didn't get all the sleep you needed, kiddo." Steve grinned, booping the boy's nose with his finger.
"Havin' fun with your ducky?" Tony chuckled, scrubbing Peter down.
Bucky gave him a pointed look, emphasizing his point by sliding in the drawer.
"Yeah, and push them on the swings," he laughed, standing with the baby, "You wanna get Sammy set up or Pete?"
"Tony..." Steve shivered, letting out a soft moan at all the attention. "Tony--"
"I never really got to know him." the blonde said carefully.
He gently smoothed his hand over Steve's stomach, rubbing circles into his hips while he scissored him open. Steve arched into the touch, noising happily into the attentions.
"You are
Peter sniffled and nodded, wrapping his arms around Steve's neck. Tony smooched Peter's temple, rubbing calming circles into his back. "You okay now?" He asked after a moment, brushing Peter's bangs to the side.
Tony paused and laughed, shaking water droplets out of his hair.
"Then we won't move. Unless we have to." Tony wrapped his arms around Steve's waist, happily nuzzling into his neck.
He was trying to keep himself from getting too attached, but he knew it was already too late for that.
Steve hummed thankfully at the nips, running his hands along Tony's body and caressing the skin.
He swooped Peter out of Steve's lap, noisily kissing his cheek.
"Then best hurry up and open it," Tony replied with a smirk and a raised eyebrow, "I hope you like it, babe."
since Steve met Tony, and he couldn’t have been happier. Having a soulmate
Making sure Steve wasn't behind him--and utterly failing--Peter spread out Sammy's blanket and gently set the baby up, then scooted over to the other side.
Steve turned around, surprised to see Tony awake. "His juice spilled all over himself in the middle of breakfast. Gotta get him cleaned up. Morning."
"Always am," Tony corrected, wincing as he tried to sit up, "And possibly in need of a back brace. Remind me to install padding in my testing room."
"What?"
He grinned, pressing another kiss to Steve's lips before dragging the blankets up around them, happy to sink into his warmth.
"Oh my god, I'm totally keeping the soccer mom minivan. If they all move in, we'll need it," he laughed, "And my favorite car, my Benz, in case--" He paused. "--The rest will be donated," he finished lamely.
"Just like his Papa," He hummed, walking back into the bedroom, "Alright, squirt, gimmie your feetsies."
Steve was surprised at first but easily hugged back, kissing Peter's cheek in return.
"Secret kink," he mumbled, "Wanted t'try it out, worked beautifully--" Tony laughed breathlessly, content to hold Steve's body against his chest. "Like making you mine."
"Well, it wasn't really a merfolk. It was--"
"You outdid yourself, Stevie," Tony hummed, reaching across the table to brush his thumb over Steve's knuckles, "You're an amazing cook."
"While we wait, I want you to meet some friends." The human smiled, helping Steve walk around and down the stairs to another room. It was made of glass and was dark on the inside until Tony got the door to open.
"Wish I would've known that. I'm sorry." Steve said sincerely to Tony, petting Peter's hair with his free hand.  "You don't have to worry about that though, Peter. If you ever feel you aren't challenged enough or too little, you can let me know. I'll let you know if it’s something I can't handle, okay?"
"Tony..." Steve groan, grinding up against him. "Where'd you put the lube?"
"We should get dressed and then check on him." Steve clarified, petting at Tony's hair softly. "I hope he's not still upset about earlier. Are you good to walk?"
Peter giggled at that. "I'mma make sure he eats his veggies 'n goes ta bed by 8:30." He laughed, settling further into Tony's chest. "It’s what he gets fo' bein' a meanie to you and Papa."
what is going on, Buck." Steve scolded in a hushed toned. "Besides, how would I have known if I butt dialed you?" He sputtered.
"Mmm." Peter lost interest in the subject, putting the blueberries in the mix.
"After dinner, we're gonna do somethin', okay? Then we can all sit down as a family and watch--"
why you were getting Jarvis to help you with your homework," Clint complained, "He overrided your internet access, didn't he?"
"Tomorrow... Tomorrow we'll ask the gang. Well, they know, but to confirm," He murmured, "Maybe they'll let us leave a little early."
He slipped on his boots and headed back to his daddy, rocking on the balls of his feet in wait.
Tony chuckled softly, rising from his crouch to turn down Peter's bed.
Tony nodded, kissing his collarbone.
with him."
"Y'welcome, Daddy." Peter whispered back, the scene making Steve smile softly at the two.
He looked up with a drowsy smile, nudging their noses together.
"Okay. But if it gets to be too much, let me know okay? Then we can watch something else." The blond sighed, turning back towards the movie again.
"Hearing my thoughts?" Steve whispered back, Frosty the Snowman keeping the others occupied. "I never said anything about the mistletoe, or the thing with Gordon Ramsey. But I thought it."
"You nipped my nose, that's what." Steve chuckled, moving in to nip Tony's nose back. "There. Now we're even," he hummed proudly.
Steve's lips were then pressed against Tony's, the kiss soft and a tad hesitant at first but then becoming a little more confident. When they parted, the soldier moved a hand to cup Tony's cheek, smiling back to him fondly.
With that, he sat at his desk chair to wait.
"I've got it." Bruce said abruptly.
"You’re so good, Tony." He said sweetly, kissing Tony's lips with a hum. "You feeling all right?”
"I won't purposefully try to. Here," Steve pulled the spoon away for the moment, blowing on it lightly to cool it down. "Alrighty, you should be good."
"For now, let's just stick to being young, kinky, and in love," Tony laughed, climbing on top of Steve, "Speaking of kinky--"
"Parents usually have that effect, especially moms." Steve said confidently.
"It's not that baby, I promise." Steve headed over to console the boy. "It... A bad thing happened to Daddy's mommy and daddy. And he misses them, and that makes him very sad."
"A-Ah--To--Ton--!" Steve croaked out before he was coming across their chests hard. His vision had whited out for a moment as he rode out the pleasure, muscles twitching and body thrumming.
"I went home at twelve and a half. I never got beaten again, on the promise I-- the sex thing. If I kept doing that until I got to MIT. That's when I went off the grid, and moved into the apartment with my three degrees. It's all history from there."
old ones cuz Gwimlock is funny."
Tony laughed at that, humming the national anthem under his breath.
He sat back and looked down at Steve with a raised brow, folding his arms.
"Thank you," Tony murmured, hands trailing over Steve's ass, "This'll be our little secret, then. Your boyfriend will never have to know how much you like being bent over my desk. Might call you in more often."
"Love you, too." Steve whispered back, wrapping around Tony again. "And I'll do anything I can for you when you need it."
Tony got up to peer at the comic book, jaw unhinging slightly.
"It’s jus' right, Daddy." Peter hummed, relaxing in the water as the tub filled, “I know 'm not in trouble, but 'm tired of not doin' things right..."
Steve chuckled at the boy's enthusiasm, secretly relieved the boy hadn't asked why.
Steve held the phone carefully in his hand, looking to Tony.
"Pete." He started quietly. "Munchkin, whats the matter?"
"Don' feel good," he mumbled, whining softly, "Head hurts."
"You mean now? We're gonna go teach you how to draw and get you some art stuff of your own," Tony chuckled, taking the towel to dry Peter's hair, "Then we're gonna watch a movie with Papa."
He sighed happily, keeping himself still while Steve worked him.
"I thought you'd forgotten about me," he teased when he saw the familiar mop of hair.
"It’s not like he touches it or anything, Peter. He can't help it." Steve explained when he heard Sammy fussing and reaching for Peter again.
"Considering what I'm gettin’ him for Christmas, kid's gonna be over the moon," Tony chuckled, still petting Peter, "I spoil him so bad, good Lord."
"Eww," he whined, "S'
Peter let the water wash out his hair before sitting up, letting Steve grab him with a towel and lift him out.
"God, don't do that, I just came," he groaned, sinking into the water, "You turn me on so bad." Tony grinned back and kissed his forehead, running his fingers through his hair.
He huffed, poking at Steve's cheek to get him to sit up.
"All right, Tony. You've been working on this bot too long. You are seeing figments." He muttered, collecting his parts and taking them back up to his home.
"I always thought about what it'd be like having a kid or two. A family. But that is something that can wait for us both to decide later on, yeah?" He grinned, nuzzling Tony's cheek.
Tony remembered each detail of the date Steve had made with Peggy but never got to make.
"The same way I got stuck with a brilliant one; I haven't the slightest idea." Steve smiled back sweetly. "Now, let’s go fix up dinner before it gets burned up."
Pulling off, Tony grinned, spit and precome dripping down his chin.
"I'm only hobbling ‘cause my butt is numb, asshole," Tony grumbled, sighing into the hot spray, "I'm not hurt. A little numb and I'm pretty sure I have bruises on my hips, but not hurt."
"I like you, Steve. Like,
"I have to say, you seem nothing like what I was expecting.".
Peter hiccupped and cuddled Sammy closer, giggling at the boy's soft squeak.
Tony paused, looking up at the ceiling.
He kissed Peter's cheek then Tony's, taking Sammy up to the nursery.
Wade Wilson."
"Sure, bubba. If you want to do that." Steve smiled softly. "But what about Daddy? You don't want him to watch, too?"
"Who says I tried to be subtle?" The blond murmured behind his blush at his partner. "I realize subtlety is not my expertise, but I didn't expect you to see the answers. You rarely ever do."
"The Dean wants to talk to you in his office.".
"You are a big nerd," Tony said over Peter's head, eyes narrowed slightly, "Biggest nerd."
Tony pouted, snuffling into Steve's chest.
As if reading Tony's mind, Steve broke the momentary silence.
"I don't want to pick one DNA over the other," Natasha replied carefully, earning a laugh from Clint.
She looked down at the object in Steve's hands. "And what exactly is that thing?"
Tony whined in his throat, shaking his head.
"How did Sammy manage getting over here? I know it was only a little ways, but still."
," Tony gasped, bringing his knee up onto the desk to brace himself, moans falling off his lips.
The third piece was more believable to him. The face on it scared Tony, but it was a face that seemed more accurate to himself. It was when he had snapped at Steve. The last impression he had let Steve see of him. The canvas was an intense red, the line work harsh and ragged. Some of the lines seem to drip downward, giving it a feeling of hurt.
Sniffling, Tony nodded, busting into tears when Peter leaned up and smooched his cheek. "I love you both, so much," he whispered.
"Hey Papa bear, baby bear's gonna try and squish you," He laughed softly.
"Oh, Steve--" Tony gasped softly, whining as he ran a hand through Steve's hair.
"Papa was right. You has a tattoo on you dere." He pointed out, pulling Tony's collar down slightly to see as they ended up in the living room.
"You got the boys without me?" Tony teased, sleepily walking up to Steve to kiss his cheek, noticing their backyard had been turned back to normal, "And here I thought I was getting fresh blueberry muffins."
"Hey, hey, shhh, Papa's gonna go ask, okay?" Tony immediately grabbed Peter's hand again, having the boy concentrate on him, "You're alright sweetheart, you just don't feel so good, I know, I'm sorry, I love you, you're gonna be okay..."
"Okay. But you saying those things to me just might make me lose it." Tony said with a soft whine, reaching and running a hand through Steve's hair in thanks. "I don't do well at taking compliments, so you know. So all this 'beautiful' stuff just might make me combust."
Tony shrugged.
Steve leaned in with a dopey grin, kissing Tony back before flopping beside him.
"You're a faithful one. Proud of you, Stevie," Tony cooed, slipping his fingers out of Steve.
He took Steve all the way in, humming gently. Steve moaned softly as Tony's warm mouth enveloped him, fingers tightening in dark hair as he tries not to buck upwards into the heat. Tony gently sucked him off, pulling off again with a deep pant. The blond mewled and panted the best he was able behind the gag. His body relaxed against the cool of the floor, eyes half-lidded as he looked back down at Tony.
"You're a troublemaker." Steve smirked with a laughed, kissing Tony's cheek. "Always were."
"Peter, I started learning algebra as a freshman in high school. You're seven and able to do this. I'd say you're pretty smart, buddy." Steve pointed out proudly, starting up on his sketches again.
. And if she changes her mind, then it wasn't meant to be, but I don't think that's gonna happen. Okay?"
"Uh-huh..." The boy said softly into the touch, moving to snuggle both his Daddy and Papa. "Jus' don't weave foreva'." He whispered.
"Babe, we gotta shower an' talk before we get the boys," he murmured, eyes still closed.
"I know you were, buddy. And you ate all your food, so good job." Steve praised with a smile as he cleaned Peter's face.
Tony nodded, turning to Steve with a weak smile. "Ready?"
He went and stood by the window, a smile on his lips.
Steve gripped his hands in his lap, looking down in thought. "I...I don't know, Mr. Stark... I just want to know for sure that I'm with you for more than just a job or some quick rattle of desk drawers." He said quietly. "If I knew, then maybe their rumors wouldn't bother me as much."
"Take one day at a time, sweetheart," Tony murmured, "They'll be babies for a while-- no making me cry right after that, god, Steve, you know just how to poke at my heart."
, Rogers. You just merely looked for the wrong ones."
"You did. You were such a loving toddler, it was so cute." Steve grinned, taking Sammy and playing with the baby's fingers. "Loved giving kisses."
He grinned, blowing a kiss at Sammy while stuffing him into a new diaper and onesie.
"Yeah, you need a nap," Tony snorted, wrapping his arms around Peter before leaning up, "I'll tuck you in, and come get you in a bit."
"That would be nice, thank you." Steve answered quietly, looking to Tony with a bit of concern. He was worried for Sharon after all that. They knew she had a memory problem, but didn't think it's get that bad so soon.
with a woman. I've never been with
"Ohh my god. You go get that, and I'll put it in his hair."
"Yeah," Tony murmured back, raising his hips slightly, "Feels real good, Stevie."
"I like topping fine." Steve explained, rolling to his side and looking to Tony. "I like that I can make you feel good. Love the noises you make, too." He smiled back.
Peter pouted slightly as he had saw Sammy's reaction.
Steve nodded, hurrying to get dressed, cleaned and ready. He grabbed his keys and wallet before leaving the apartment and moving fast in excitement down to the garage to meet with Tony. Tony was already leaning against the car when Steve showed up, giving him a quick kiss before climbing into the driver's seat.
"Don't be sorry, no one knew," Tony rolled his eyes, tugging Steve to the living room. He pushed the blond into their recliner, happily snuggling into his lap.
-- 'm gettin' close, Tones..." He panted, head dipping down towards his chest.
, Steve--"
"Mh-hm--" Steve moaned in response as he leaned into Tony's hand. "Feels
"Yeah. We'll have to really wash the sheets," Tony snickered, "But yeah. We'll leave the not-nursery-yet open, and put those in the other two guest rooms. The guest house comes fully furnished, so we don't have to worry about that. I'll put all my lab stuff in the basement, and we can hang your artwork up,
"Sliced, you say--?"
old, especially." Natasha warned playfully, scooping up a small fingering of icing and booping it on the tip of Tony's nose.
"Not sad, just anxious. Don't know what all you're gonna do." He explained softly. "I trust you though, so it’s not as bad." He hummed, adjusting his arms slightly to be more comfortable.
"I think that's a perfect idea. No wonder the other teachers say you're brilliant." Steve grinned at the attention. He wrapped arms around Tony's waist, tugging him close and sneaking a hand down to grab at Tony's bottom.
Steve quirked his eyebrows up at that, following Tony back down a level.
childhood."
Steve and Peter were working on rolling up crescent rolls when Tony came back downstairs, giving an appreciative smile seeing Tony in the wife beater.
He did as he was told, slowly bending over the desk. Tony flicked open his belt, pushing his jeans to the floor and looking back at Steve with doe eyes.
"I don't drink, you know that," Tony replied, raising an eyebrow at Clint, "At least, I'm
"Whoa, Steve. What's the matter? What's the deal?"
," Peter made a noise, pulling his hand away to wipe the slobber on Tony's shirt, "Ew."
"You can spank me later, if you want," he breathed, "But we need to get you in the bath before you're too sore. C'mon, up."
It took time for him to get there, bones aching with each step until he was able to sit on the bench they would meet at. It overlooked the lake, his breath slow and gentle as he listened to the birds chirping around him. Steve broke from his trance when he heard familiar footsteps come beside him.
"Hmm, very okay. You?" He asked with a content hum. "Other than being a little sore, that is." He chuckled, nuzzling his husband's neck as he scrubbed carefully at Tony's scar.
"I don't wish for a different soulmate. You are the best one I could have had." Steve said sweetly, kissing Tony's lips. "You are just what I deserved, Tony. I could think of no one better. And if you don't believe me, you can hear my thoughts to be sure, I'm positive."
