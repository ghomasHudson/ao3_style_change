Tony's hole is tight, and wet, and
Damn, that looks good.
“Let me turn around, honey,” Tony mutters, hurriedly glancing back at Steve. If his nipples rub
“Of course it is,” Steve says, a trembling smile spreading across his mouth as he speaks. “You – you look so different,” he mutters, walking closer to him.
Steve chuckles at the sound, and Tony lightly slaps his arm in protest; he then cups his face with both of his hands, outrage already forgotten, trusting Steve to follow the path upstairs without tripping over something and potentially killing them both. (Or just Tony. Tony is
, until Tony finally catches his breath and makes a hand gesture at him, allowing him to get back to his chest.
“Yeah,” Tony breathes out, nodding a little too quickly. “It's, it's supposed to resist through a lot, of, um,
it will be painful! Tony
Tony lifts his other thigh to wrap it around Steve's hips along with the other one, trapping Steve in between his legs and sinking his nails in the back of Steve's neck as he bites down at his throat again. He lets him rut against him as much as he wants to, gasping every time the jacket zipper presses harshly against his cock, until the moment when he catches the sudden curiosity flashing in Steve's eyes.
Around them, the fighting had stopped, the blue creatures defeated. Steve could spot some of the team in position, ready to take whatever shot opened up as soon as it did.
“Think fast.”
Pinning her arms loosely next to her head, Steve dipped down and began kissing a thorough trail down her neck, stopping just short of her sternum but only for a moment. Only for long enough to pin darkened blue eyes on her and demand roughly, “Is this okay, Toni? Are you okay? Say the word and I’ll stop, darlin’, none of this is happenin’ if you’re feeling anything less than 100 percent.”
“…and that, little one, is how I managed to make people think that losing my eyebrows when I blew up an experiment accidentally, was actually a fashion statement. I think some people still do it,” Toni added thoughtfully, arranging her features to make it look like she was deeply pondering the possibility, when in reality, she was still running calculations in her head.
“Why didn’t you say anything?” he snapped, sounding harsh even to his own ears, but surprisingly, Stark didn’t take the bait. Instead, she simply raised an eyebrow at him, staring at him unimpressed until he huffed in frustration and bit out a completely insincere apology.
“You always have my attention, sweetheart,” he husked, trailing kisses along her jaw. “Including when you’re not even in the same room.”
Howard hummed under his breath, but there was no mistaking the keen interest that sharpened his gaze. For a fleeting moment, Toni thought about how much she’d done and given up her entire life, trying to get that much attention and recognition from her absent father, but in the next second, she realized just how little it meant to her anymore.
Howard Stark. A feeling of foreboding curled in his gut and he couldn’t stop the way his mind automatically leaped to bad case scenarios; and that unexplained bruise she’d been sporting when he’d gone to her room all those months ago.
Which was good, because now he wasn’t going to feel guilty about bombarding her with questions.
“In that case,” Bucky grinned charmingly, and how he could pull it off after walking umpteen miles straight after being tortured, Steve didn’t know. “You have my gratitude, ma’am.” He tipped an imaginary hat at Peggy, who only smiled indulgently.
He had spent most of it, after settling his old friend in one of the guest rooms, catching up with Howard, learning about what had happened after he took the plane down from a first-hand source, and then learning more about Peggy and how she’d moved on with her life after him. In turn, he told his old friend what he could about this strange new century, enjoying not being mocked for being so out of time. It had been fantastic; the only thing missing had been the beautiful genius herself, but Steve supposed that she wanted to tell her father about them on her own, first, and he was content to wait until Toni was ready.
her lover murmured, and Toni could almost picture the little smile on Steve’s face.
she murmured, the edge of Russian telling a story of emotions that the spy wouldn’t allow to see the light of day.
“Old flame, I think, would be the more accurate description,” Coleman grinned as he playfully leered at Tony. It raised Steve’s hackles, but there was nothing much he could do about it since Tony, the traitor, was laughing about it. “We used to go out, back when I was a rookie and worked reasonable hours, and this one wasn’t moonlighting as a superhero.”
Knuckling his eyes, he squinted up at his Uncle Loki, bottom lip wobbling for having been woken up. “Wassa matter, Uncle Loki?” he asked tremulously, his brain still feeling a little fuzzy because it was still dark out and the last time he woke up during the dark time, it was because Mommy had to go away for work and was saying bye…
her. He hated everything Toni Stark seemed to personify; a bully who was so used to being an entitled, spoilt little princess that she treated everyone around her as though they were less, in some way, inferior to her simply because Daddy had always indulged her and made her think that she had any right to put herself above everyone else.
With a grace that was at complete odds with her inexperience with kids, Toni bent down and scooped Peter up into her arms, lifting herself to her feet all while cradling her hand to her chest. The little boy, trembling, clung to her with a fierceness that was telling of his fear, reminiscent of the day she had first found him. He needed to feel safe, and she could do that for him, and that was all that was going to matter for the next little while.
Steve grinned ruefully at the answer to that. “I had a very interesting talk with a very smart four year old,” he explained, after clearing his throat. “Apparently, I’m
Satisfied with her triage, given the distinct lack of equipment, space and time, Toni turned her attention to the suit and the boy still contained in it. The wires connecting to the comm system had escaped their makeshift ports, which explained why she wasn’t hearing Steve’s frantic voice in the confines of their little bubble despite the suit still being functional, but she couldn’t focus on the fix for that because her attention was stolen by the kid. Maico was still sniffling softly and the inventor hastened to flip the catches of the manual release so that she could ease him out instead of the suit dropping him out.
For one, Toni couldn’t really remember the last time she’d had porridge. Probably back before boarding school, even, and not without reason as she wasn’t particularly fond of it. She usually had cereal or toast, and that was only if Steve was paying particular attention enough to admonish her eating habits. If he wasn’t? Blueberries and coffee generally served as an all-day sort of meal.
“Technically, I am the co-pilot, Miss Stark, Sergeant Barnes.” JARVIS’ voice came overhead, a typical mix of dry amusement and smug snark. Toni never ceased to be amazed by him.
Judging from the grin and chuckle from Bruce and Bucky respectively, Toni wasn’t on a private comm line with him, but none of that mattered to Steve because she was there, inexplicably and impossibly, and just the sound of her voice was enough to bring him back.
Steve jerked violently as Toni’s voice, crystal clear, materialized in his ear. For the briefest second, he’d thought that she was back on board, that the last missile was a lost cause and that they were going to have to go down, but after his horror and dread subsided, he managed to rationalize that she’d simply patched on to their radio connection.
She tapped to answer and had to wait a few seconds for her AI to scramble the signal, before she was treated to the sight of Steve’s smiling face. “Hey, hot stuff.”
And really, hadn’t her inherent desire not to disappoint, kind of given way to her innate recklessness in the first place?
Back at the beginning, when he’d first clawed his way through the Winter Soldier programming, something requiring this kind of laser-focus would have put him on edge. For all that he had Stevie’s constant bolstering and Toni’s unshakeable faith, it had still been incredibly difficult for him to trust in himself, and trust that he had the Soldier under control.
Thank you all for the patience! My tests are over for now, so here's another nice, long chapter for you guys! I thought it would only be appropriate to update this series today ;)
Coaching herself to breathe through it; because she’d certainly had worse; Toni consoled herself with the knowledge that the beam hadn’t hit an artery, and she wasn’t in too much immediate danger. She could tell, because the wound was bleeding slowly rather than gushing, and judging from the small amount of mobility she still had in her arm, there probably wasn’t muscle damage either. In all likelihood, she’d just need a few sutures and possibly a sling, if Steve or Rhodey or Bucky or Bruce had anything to say about it. Her chances of getting away without one did not look promising.
Steve exhales a slow, shaky breath. Tony clenches his muscles, knowing Steve must still be staring at the red jewel butt-plug inside him, and feeling it sink a little deeper into his body. “I'm so tight,” he murmurs, because it's true, and because it

that the elastic will probably be stretched to the point of no return by the time they're done with how hard the both of them are pulling at it by both ends, but Tony just can't bring himself to care.

Steve pulls his cheeks apart again, and Tony sighs quietly at the feeling of the hard pads of his fingers sinking into his tanned skin. “Tell me, love. Don't you think you should spank me? I think you should spank me. All this white, all this lace – too good of an opportunity to pass up, right?
Also, shout out to Lily, the reader who wanted to see Cap apologize in Mommy Quandary. Your wish, my dear...  :D
“There’s no oxygen supply,” Rogers told him in a low voice, and it was telling of how much Rhodes was putting aside that he didn’t immediately snap at the Captain for answering a question he’d directed at Toni (Rhodey took his rivalries very seriously.) “The suit has an emergency supply, but…”
“Look, I think that I… I haven’t really been… I was wrong about you,” Barnes finally managed to blurt out, and Tony knew without looking that there would be a look of genuine remorse on his features. For all that they’d never gotten along, Tony had always appreciated the man’s blunt nature, and Bucky never said anything that he didn’t absolutely mean. But where Tony might have considered the chance to find common ground with Barnes any other time, it hardly mattered to him right now, in his anger.
She still wasn’t entirely sure why she’d done it; perhaps an ill-advised attempt to prove to herself that he no longer had any dominion over her, the way he’d had when she was a child and through most of her adult life; but for whatever her reason, she was glad she’d done it. It had been cathartic to look him in the eye one more time, face him one more time, and not flinch.
Blinking against the harsh light as the cloth finally slipped away, Tony swallowed a sigh of relief at having his sight returned. As he’d imagined, all three goons were flanking Slime Man, none of them paying him an iota of attention. Not that he could really blame them, since a livid Steve Rogers was a sight people generally didn’t want to take their eyes off of, if only to avoid being trampled in his rage path when he unleashed it. Nobody was aiming a gun at Steve anymore, which was a relief, but Tony didn’t entertain the illusion that any of them were unarmed.
He hadn't realized it had hurt so much during the first time (because, once again: he was so drunk that he barely remembers how the night went at all), so he couldn't help but wincing in pain when the goddamn metal bars passed through his nipples. Still worth it, though.
He loves him so
, yeah, but he's not so sure Steve would appreciate that.
Tony must feel his eyes on him – and he sure can feel Steve's hands pulling on either side of his hole, not quite touching it, but exposing it so much that there's no

“Ten minutes, sir,” says J.A.R.V.I.S., and Tony would feel embarrassed at what he's going to do if only the AI hadn't seen much worse in all its years of existence. So Tony doesn't even blink in uneasiness when he takes off his pants, bends down slightly, sucks on his index finger for as long as he can allow himself to, and then circles his hole with it.
They stare into each other's eyes for a few seconds, neither of them dropping their gaze. Tony smirks lazily, pleased by the challenge – and by the way Steve never backs off from one – and pulls his chin back towards him, kissing him again.
Tony shuts him up with a kiss. “Bedroom,” he briefly replies.
“You look so swell,” Steve says, voice weak with delight as he looks at the eyeliner across Tony's eyelids, at his styled hair, and back at his red-painted lips. He glances at the cake on the table for a moment. “The cake looks good, too.”
Not that Steve can see much of them as it is – Tony knows that the

They're simple. No color; just a plain, shining shade of gray.
Tony catches the exact moment Steve feels the fabric of his panties against his naked skin. His lips stop moving mid-kiss, and he lets out a quiet gasp of surprise.
“Oh, shut up,” Tony says, grabbing him by the back of his neck and pulling him into a kiss, definitely not wanting this very sexy moment to be spoiled by l'antisesso that he is. This is no right time to eat a damn birthday cake – unless that's an euphemism for his very tasty, very perfect bubble butt, obviously.

He kisses him gently, lovingly, massaging the reddened skin of his wrists as he slowly pulls out of his body. Tony immediately clenches up, not willing to let any drop of Steve's come escape from his hold, and kisses him back with all that he's got.
Steve doesn't do that first, though; he's still kissing him when Tony feels his hands taking off his boots instead, ever so mindful of his comfort and well-being. His hand wraps around his bandaged ankle for a moment, the touch loving and caring, as if he's thanking him for the trouble he went through just to please him.
Steve silences him when he presses his thumb lightly inside his mouth, not so much as to make contact with his tongue but surely enough to graze at his teeth. It's more than sufficient to make Tony stop speaking.
He doesn't immediately bite at his skin again, and Tony is thankful for that. He resumes teasing his nipples with his tongue, with the pads of his fingers; it's only when Tony is breathing normally again that he lets his teeth run around the tip of his nipples, not biting yet, just testing the waters.

So he had washed his hands before they could come any closer to his cock – or ass – , put the lube away, and ordered a few juicy items from an online store.

Steve's hand lands right on top of his butt-plug, and Tony
He can feel Steve's hesitation; his hands are trembling where they're pushing the fabric of Tony's panties aside, his breath warm and quick where it's grazing at Tony's skin. His fingers hold onto the edges of his butt-plug, pushing it slowly out of his body; staring at Tony's hole as it clenches around the metal sliding smoothly against his folds, and then swallowing it back down when Steve pushes it in again.
Tony absolutely jumps him, pressing a kiss to his mouth just to shut him up before he can say anything else. “You

Steve doesn't reply, more than just used to Tony's complete lack of patience by now. He still takes his time, though, pushing his fingers in and out of him slowly, then a little quicker, and finally much faster, until Tony's panting softly while staring up into Steve's eyes, completely unashamed.

Then he turns around again.
Tony can feel his body tensing up instinctively under Steve's scrutiny, but he forces himself to relax and swallow down his insecurity as much as he can. “It's. It's the make up, Steve.”
Steve doesn't even answer. He's staring at Tony's face, astonished, and isn't even blinking.
He can feel
He strokes up Steve's back, feeling the tense muscles relax underneath his touch. He follows the planes of his shoulders, then sinks his fingers back into his blonde hair.
Steve's hand grabs his wrist so forcefully that Tony gasps in pain, and
“I will, I will,” he says, just to humour him. “Steve, I swear to god, if you don't touch me in the next five seconds – ”
But that's not the right moment for that; they'll make love later, at the first light of dawn, when their thirst will be sated and their bodies won't be aching so bad to be one again. Tony pulls gently at Steve's hair, letting him know that he needs this too bad to content himself with just some passionate kissing, and Steve chuckles and rolls his hips against his and –
“Tony,” Steve whispers, literally
Well. He's not even sure Steve will appreciate any of
Steve pushes against his butt-plug, listening to the lovely gasp Tony lets out at that. And
He keeps completely still for as long as he can, his lips circling the base of Steve's cock, before he has to lift his head again and take a huge gulp of air back into his lungs. He jerks Steve's cock off with his hand until his throat stops hurting so bad, collecting the precome at the tip of his dick and spreading it around, even if Steve's cock is already so wet with Tony's own saliva that there's really no need for it. He cups his balls and mouths at them, too, as he regains his breath, and Steve just groans from behind him.
Finally, she was rewarded with a small,
Probably the same thing that was said by the fact that he trusted Tony to keep him safe, enough to start getting distracted while a blade was digging into his neck. That he was stupidly in love with the man.
A bitter taste hit the back of her throat and she jerked back, unresponsive. All the emotions of the past few minutes crashed spectacularly around her and even if she’d wanted to, Toni couldn’t find the words.
For the first time, Rhodey realized that the suit’s hands were also missing. It hadn’t meant much to him at first, figuring that she’d simply scavenged the parts like the wiring out of the left leg of the armor, but if she’d kept them intact…
With no small amount of effort, she managed a weak, “Still here, honey. You’re okay, we’re both okay. Just stay still for a sec, okay?”
“Stark…” Steve started helplessly, only to be cut off by Toni’s impassive voice.
And yes, that was in capital letters, because for as many flaws as she’d had, Maria Stark had always been there for her daughter and was one of a select three people upon whom Toni could count. In doing so, she had instilled a deep appreciation in Toni for the strength, resilience and love of a mother, and in the lifetime that followed, Toni
Terror made them pale and a little green, and Toni watched in detached amusement as one of the three dropped to his knees in supplication. As if that would save him now.
Fuck, Tony
Toni realized at the same time that Steve did, how visible her bruising was, both the vivid handprint and the swelling wrist that Steve had only just noticed himself, probably from her killer punch.
She drifted in and out of awareness, Steve and Bruce taking turns to keep her just conscious enough to stay awake. Exhaustion weighed her body down like a load of bricks and pain was a constant companion but she couldn’t sleep; Bruce was too leery about her concussion and in all honesty, Toni wasn’t sure that she’d be able to drudge up the energy to wake up after a mere few hours, if she slept now.
“I’m okay,” she murmured reassuringly, after taking a few deep breaths. The terrifying black lines of palladium which had been creeping up her neck earlier, a sick parody of a tattoo, had receded some, her eyes were clear, and she was lucid, and Steve would take what he could get until they got back to base and she could rest and allow the lithium dioxide to work properly.
Maico nodded fervently and threw his arms around her again. “We’re really gonna go home?”
Before he could do anything rash, like put his fist through a wall, his phone buzzed. A quick glance at the caller ID was enough to bleed at least a fraction of the tension from his muscles. “Hey, Babe.”
Through sheer force of will, he kept from smashing the little device, instead forcing himself to take deep breaths lest he start hyperventilating again. A small part of him couldn’t help wishing for Toni, desperate in a way that only a lover could be, and he knew he would have given just about anything in the world if he could just get to her, quick and easy. Or better yet, have it not happen at all.
And she would keep on going until she reached the top. Or the end.
And to top it all off, she had a goddamn kid with her.
“Steve… Steve, stop, I’m gonna… I can’t…” Tony whined softly, so out of it with desire that Steve had to reward him with a slight twist on the next upstroke. It made another stunning sound break free from the inventor and Steve watched, captivated, as Tony’s face creased in pleasure, bottom lip caught between his teeth.
Turning back to his girlfriend, he sent her a grin and swung onto the bike in front of her. Her arms wrapped around his middle as soon as he was seated, and picking up one of those hands, he pressed a kiss to her knuckles and pulled on his own helmet to the sound of her laughter.
He shrugged off the SHIELD agents with embarrassing ease, all but sprinting out of the door and trying to breathe through his panic enough to figure out where she’d gone.
As Tony devolved into disjointed sentences, vision blurring and throat closing up, Steve tossed the folder to the floor in favour of gathering him close to his chest. “Shh,” he hushed softly, sweetly, as he thumbed away tears and nuzzled Tony’s temple and pressed kisses everywhere he could reach. “Shh, Tony, hey, it’s okay. I’m here, we’re safe, I got you sweetheart.”
Steve wanted to lunge for the man; wanted to demand to know why today, of all days, Rhodes was putting his safety above Toni’s; but he was intercepted by Bucky grabbing his biceps and shaking him once, forcing him to look at the brunet.
In the distance, Toni heard the sound of the Quinjet. Something akin to disappointment curled on her tongue, knowing that she would have to share her retribution, but it was her own fault for taking as long as she had to launch her attack. In her defense, she’d maintained the presence of mind enough to wait until they’d taken their captive to a place where he wouldn’t be subjected to what she was about to do.
Steve knew it was wrong, but he had to try to convince Tony that there was something more; something real between them that just wasn’t with stupid, Tony-ignorant Coleman.
Whatever kids just sometimes had to do, she never got to find out, because the super-sensitive tech in the suit managed to pick up a faint sound that Toni hated, but couldn’t ever mistake.
Steve loved that he had the ability to render this silver-tongued man almost speechless, but what he loved even more, was hearing Tony moan his name. He’d only had about thirty dozen fantasies imagining just what it would sound like, just what it would feel like, and now that he had it right in front of him, Steve realized that his mind could have never done it justice.
Peter stirred briefly when she laid him on the bed; instinctively, Toni lowered herself on to the bed as well, and a gentle kiss to the forehead combined with the soft Italian lullaby that she remembered her mother singing to her many years ago was enough to soothe him back into sleep.
Nat slipped back into the kitchen, a slightly pouting Peter trailing behind her. “It was nothing personal,” she offered, sounding vaguely apologetic, but not remorseful. She reclaimed her chair and waved at the one Clint had vacated, in an invitation to join her. Steve sat down heavily, all at once feeling every bit of his years, even the ones under ice.
oh, baby,” Steve murmured, aghast, as the harsh light of day brought all Toni’s injuries into sharp and devastating focus. Rhodes and Bucky began to take the harness off them, but Steve couldn’t focus on anything except the state of his girlfriend. A horrific looking gash had coated her arm and side in blood, and a nasty looking knot on the back of her head hinted at a concussion. Bruises decorated her body like a toddler had splashed paint with her body as the canvas. As if being trapped and having to crawl her way out wasn’t bad enough, she’d had to do it like this?
They couldn’t be sure. Of course they couldn’t be.
He laughed shakily, remembering a shared conversation a long time ago, back when he’d known what he was waiting for… only he hadn’t known that exactly the right partner was the person he’d thought he’d hated.
She kept the mindless reassurances up, Maico’s sobs softening but not ending, until pain shot through her right arm. It took incredible restraint not to cry out but she managed it, not wanting to scare the kid any more than he already had been. Those good intentions, however, were abruptly waylaid by her ill-advised attempt to yank her injured arm closer to herself. White-hot pain ricocheted through her body, and a dull roar in her ears was her only warning before she blacked out.
“You got yourself out of there,” he reminded her, and Toni wasn’t sure whether it was for her benefit or his. Possibly both. “You’re safe, now.”
Who had more to fight for than she?
She was not Mother Material, that was a well-documented fact, and despite how many times Steve tried to point out that her actions spoke otherwise, that was an argument she wasn’t prepared to indulge him with.
Sure enough, Steve’s low voice, amused and fond, confirmed her thoughts a second later. “Sure you can, buddy, just as soon as we put the food on the nightstand so it won’t fall.”
“He lies awake,” Thor smiled knowingly, stepping aside to clear the path to the door. To her son. “He was adamant that a magic wish would return his mother home in time to tuck him in… I shan’t be so quick to dismiss his wisdom in the future,” the Thunder God nodded somberly, but there was a sparkle in his eyes that Toni didn’t miss, and it made her wonder whether Peter had shared the story of the 11:11 wishes she’d told him, what seemed like ages ago now.
Even when she frequently gave him heart attacks and arrhythmias with her tendency to prioritize her safety below that of others’.
She didn’t need to ask; already knew that she made up the majority of times he’d felt that way. “He’s just a little boy, Rhodey,” Toni murmured, mind automatically going to Peter.
Distantly, he was of course happy for them, but at the forefront of his moment was the leaden weight in his stomach that got heavier with every step he took towards the empty armor. He wasn’t even sure what he was hoping to find, but Rhodes seemed to share his idea, the armored man stepping forward with him while Bucky tried to coax Bruce into some semblance of control.
Time passed in a bit of a blur after that, especially after Steve’s first official meeting with who he now knew was Johan Schmidt. He was forced to put it to the back of his mind when the place began to explode, fire and heat crackling menacingly in the air around them.
cried, Steve,
Toni arched an unimpressed eyebrow. “They do know I don’t work for them, right?” she asked with a hint of disdain. She knew that Fury hadn’t asked as much as demanded their presence, and the genius had never taken orders very well.
Medics. He should call the medics.
All things considered, she’d let it go for a little while. Just long enough for everyone’s fears to ebb away.
Stark only laughed and threw a wink over her shoulder before leaving the tent. Steve and Peggy followed after and watched as she approached her father, beginning to ramble something before he could do so much as greet her.
Toni didn’t realize she was backing away until a hand suddenly perched against the small of her back. It took everything she had not to flinch instinctively, but when Coulson shifted his arm so that it curled around her waist instead, she knew that he had still felt the tension that had snapped into her body. His stance was suddenly protective, subtly positioned in front of her, and in any other circumstance, Toni would have covered her surprise with mocking about how Agent actually cared about her. As it were, she was simply grateful for the cover, and in an uncharacteristic move, inched closer to the immovable SHIELD agent.
“Don’t you ever say that to me again, doll,” he told her roughly, a hint of Brooklyn creeping into his voice as he leaned down to press his forehead against hers. “Don’t you
“I don’t think me being here is a very good idea,” she settled with finally, keeping her eyes trained ahead of her even when Coulson glanced at her. “Thank you for getting me away.”
Steve glanced towards the helm of the Quinjet when he heard Natasha’s voice. “You should call her. Give her an update.”
“Love you, darlin’.”
After all these years, and the family that he’d managed to build, the archer had forgotten about the punch of pain and anger and loss and regret. He’d gotten soft, in a manner of speaking, and had gotten used to the feelings of comfort and happiness that had invaded what had been an existence dominated by darkness.
That goddamn business trip.
That uneasiness in his son’s eyes when Peter had demanded a promise from him to bring his mommy back safely, was something that Steve fervently wished never to see again.
Cheers,
Uncle Loki nodded, all dignified. “You may.”
“I’m her fella, I have license, so fuck you.”
Using the hand in his, the super soldier gently tugged Tony closer, thrilling to himself when the genius came easily. “It isn’t,” he replied earnestly, voice hushed with the force of his repressed emotions and feelings of the past week. He raised his free hand; cupped his Tony’s jaw. “And I do return your feelings. I’m
Whichever one came first.
That being said… “Not again,” he shook his head, voice little more than a deep rumble. Before she could rebuff against his words, as he knew she would, he added, “Please, Toni. Please don’t. I can’t handle having you in the suit and knowing that it’s slowly… that it’s…” he couldn’t bring himself to even utter the words.
all this feels. Tony lets his weight be supported by Steve's hands, and presses back against them with his own before arching his back a little, finding Steve's arms blindly behind himself – anchoring himself to the safety of his limbs. “I'm gonna come as soon as you put your dick inside me, I swear to – ”
He takes Steve's long, beautiful leather jacket before heading to the kitchen; the one he never wears, because he finds it a little bit
“You're so beautiful,” Steve murmurs, like he's able to fucking read his mind. He cups his jaw by both sides with his hands, stroking his cheeks with his thumbs as he pulls Tony into a kiss, and hums softly against his mouth as he lets Tony hold onto his shoulders as desperately as he feels the need to.
, mindless sex, and finally allows himself to fall in love with Steve again, and again, and again.
“Tony?” He mumbles, even as Tony looks down to himself and makes sure the jacket is completely covering the sides of his chest again. “What – ”
Steve hasn't understood what Tony is wearing; you can't mistake the way lace feels against your skin.
He's going to start and beg him again when he finally feels the head of Steve's cock pressing against his entrance; his legs instantly become jelly, thighs falling apart and lips already parting to moan out loud even as Steve is still kissing him. The poor soul knows Tony like the back of his hand, though, and the first thing he does is grab at one of his legs and bring it up to lay on one of his shoulders; Tony lets himself be bent in half if that's what it takes to keep kissing Steve, even with how difficult that is now because he just can't bring himself to stop gasping and moaning every few seconds – especially since Steve keeps alternating his gaze between Tony's face and nipple piercings when he pulls momentarily away from his lips, staring at the tiny metal orbs at the sides of his nipples as they catch and reflect the light from the chandelier again. Steve leans down to mouth at his chest, kissing one of his nipples and then flicking his tongue reverently at the scar tissue around Tony's arc reactor, and
on his hair to expose his throat even further; Tony gasps, the sudden pain completely unexpected – Steve almost never pulls on his hair, finding the gesture disrespectful where Tony finds it a huge turn-on instead – as Steve leaves his mouth to kiss just under his Adam's apple, and then pushes him backwards until Tony's lying down on the kitchen isle.
. Loves him so much that it hurts.
does, he wraps his hand around Steve's cock and tries to give it a few good tugs, but – but Steve is fucking him with two fingers now as he's basically
“Shut up,” he mutters, embarrassed, pulling him into a kiss again. “God, will you please undress me already? You're killing me here. There's your huge, gorgeous cock out in the open while mine is still trapped underneath this jacket and it just, it seems a lot unfair, alright – ”
for attention. Steve just bites harder into his throat, leaning down across his body so low that his stomach rubs along Tony's cock once,
“I won't last,” he mumbles, opening his eyes again. “Just letting you know.”
he doesn't feel at least a little bit vulnerable – , and he turns around a little to try and glance at him. Steve meets his eyes before they go back to his cock, finding sucking his dick better than receiving any embarrassing praise, and the look he gives them is one of utter adoration.
just staring at it, feeling his heart swell with love and serenity and everything he's never had before Steve.
Bucky didn’t miss a beat before replying confidently, “Then she’ll make one.” At Steve’s dubious look, he adopted a look of careless self-assurance, as if challenging Steve to say otherwise. “She’s Toni fuckin’ Stark. If anyone in the world is stubborn enough to create a whole new element just to survive, it’s gonna be her.”
Lapsing into silence, Toni dedicated 100 percent of her concentration to the helmet on her lap, and when the HUD flickered a few minutes later, she grinned triumphantly.
She licked her dry lips and hoped against hope that Steve would respond to her epiphany with amusement. “There’s no reason to send all the Avengers away to meet their own ambush,” she pointed out quietly. As she spoke the words, they only made more sense. “The only reason they’d send everyone there, is if the ambush was happening
She needed him.
Of course. Toni would want to siphon that supply to the kid instead of herself, increase his odds of survival. Jim really fucking hated the honor in that plan.
Clearing his throat awkwardly, Steve clasped a hand over his shoulder. “Sorry about that, Howard,” he apologized sheepishly. He wished he could offer some kind of insight, but with a start, he realized that he had no clue what had set off Toni’s infamous temper. It had to have been something, since it generally took a hell of a lot to work her up to the point of letting her fists talk instead of her scathing words.
“Not a chance, baby,” he murmured roughly, the endearment slipping from his lips accidentally, even as he thoroughly enjoyed the pretty little flush that came over Toni’s cheeks. With a tenderness that was at odds with the hungry way he’d kissed her before, Steve pressed his lips against the inventor’s collar, right at the top of the painful looking lines. “What’s going on?” he asked softly, only a hint of command underlying his voice. “What are these? Are you… are you sick?”
Bucky looked like he wanted to say something, but stopped himself. “What else did he say?”
“Miss Toni?” Maico ventured softly just before she could issue the command to close up the armor. She hummed slightly in an invitation for him to continue, and felt her heart melt when he told her shyly, “I don’t think your name means ‘one who talks a lot’. I think it means ‘real good as a mama’.”
“Sorry, Steve,” Peter apologized, whispering now, and it never failed to amuse her how the child couldn’t master volume regulation on his whispers either. “When are we waking Mommy up? Can I do it?”
Bucky cleared his throat a little as he pulled away, blue eyes serious and somber. “Thank her again for me, would ya? For the save.”
Steve digested all this, his mind automatically visualizing just what she was suggesting, before a little smile played on his lips. “Like a shield?” he asked, holding his forearm up in the same way he would have with his costume shield attached in the show.
“We have to go in,” Steve grumbled when Fury eventually hung up. He didn’t lift his head, so she didn’t stop petting his hair. “Apparently there’s something we both need to see.”
She felt, more than heard, the rumble of approval that rolled through his chest; it was deep and heady and almost made her want to hum in response. Toni felt like she’d been on tenterhooks for the past few days, waiting for just this moment; waiting for Steve to realize that she was near to being fully healed from the horrific events of three weeks ago, and definitely ready for some of that inferno that always burned so hot between them.
“Your kid is right there,” Bucky pointed out, throwing himself carelessly into the armchair near where Steve was lounging. “Should you really be thinking about your dame when you’re on babysittin’ duty, punk?”
Which was true. But she wouldn’t say no to Steve’s voice in her ear just then.
“Language, darling,” Tony drawled lazily, drawing on his innate ability to appear completely unaffected by his situation. “Honestly, I don’t know where the fuck you learned it.”
threat.
Sympathy notwithstanding, his blood began to simmer, protectiveness flaring inside him. “She’s your daughter, Howard, she’s not one of your experiments!”
Footsteps echoed in the otherwise empty room as Tony crossed the distance between them. Without a word, the brunet took him by the wrist and led him to a nearby weight machine, directing him to sit on the padded bench. Steve sat without argument and watched with dull blue eyes as Tony fetched a first aid kit and came back to sit across from him, astride the opposite end of the weight bench.
“She’s going to be fine, honey,” Laura finally spoke, her voice brokering no argument. Apparently she’d bypassed most of her fear and went straight to fierce conviction, which Clint realized he’d really needed to hear. “This is the woman that 99 percent of the universe hails as the most brilliant mind of the millennium. Some rocks and gravel aren’t gonna beat her, you’ll see.”
Natasha Romanoff had known one, irrefutable truth for the better part of her whole life: Love was for children.
It was a combination of his reluctant empathy and the immovable certainty that Toni would give him her disappointed look (more lethal than any of theirs for how rare it was) that kept him acting semi-gentle with the Captain. As the man identified himself and the suit flashed blue in acceptance thereof, though, Rhodes had the distinct feeling that nothing would help either of them when they saw what was stored on the suit’s servers.
“Why didn’t you just tell me?” Steve asked, still a little dumbstruck by his revelation.
The genius nodded in thanks and wrapped the blanket around her precious little limpet. She sat with him in her lap and at some point, began to sing until Peter fell asleep; she wasn’t sure for how long she kept it up, but she did know that the Avengers had returned while she was still singing. Steve had taken a seat beside her, a quiet and steady presence, and it was only when they were both sure he was asleep, that he deigned to speak.
Well, a mother bear protected her cubs with her life. She fought to death, and then a little further, and showed no mercy when a threat was presented to her baby. She would never let harm come to her cubs as long as she was around.
. But damn if each syllable didn’t form perfectly around the inventor’s lips. “Come on, talk to me. I’m worried.”
She smiled faintly when Bucky leaned over to kiss her forehead. “She’s up in front,” he called out randomly, and after a beat, Toni realized that his enhanced hearing had picked up Steve waking up in a relative panic, probably for finding her gone. A bare moment later, she laid eyes on her lover, blue eyes still glazed over slightly in a mix of unawareness and alarm, and watched as calm returned with the sight of her safe and present.
Queuing the bullets up to be fabricated next, he shifted his focus on to the gun itself to see if it was feasible to make it self-destruct. “Thought
It was enough, for Bucky, to realize that the woman was offering him a home, a family, a place in this world, rather than condemning him for a past that he’d had no control over. In fact, it also furthered his therapy in leaps and bounds, because if Toni could forgive him then Bucky thought it wouldn’t be the most unrealistic thing to learn to forgive himself.
The voice over the comms was hesitant in a way that all of them recognized. It meant that Toni had a plan of some kind, one that might not be conventional by any stretch of the imagination, but one that would probably buy them some much needed time.
Not to mention, she’d had a sick feeling in her gut since yesterday, when the team had departed for the mission, and it was a small comfort to know that she could get to them even a fraction faster with the new armour.
,” he groans, letting himself fall back to the mattress and bringing Steve down with him, more exasperated than he's felt in the past eleven weeks.
Steve lets him move however he pleases, not asking questions as Tony kisses him slow and deep – even if he
“Just wanted to look at you again,” Steve says quietly, and smiles gently down at him.

Tony is loving every moment of this; it's clear that Steve is just as eager as he is, because he's barely containing his strength when he grabs the side of Tony's thigh and lifts it to wrap around his hip, and then
The jacket zipper unexpectedly presses against his very much exposed cock – lace doesn't really put much of a shield (
Toni, a civilian scientist with no training what-so-fucking-ever to speak of.
With great difficulty, she took her thoughts away from the little boy that she’d left at home and focused on the one she was cradling right now. The one who had a family to get back to. A mother to get back to, a mother that was being forced to pray for someone else to bring her child back to her when she was helpless on the sidelines.
A bare few seconds later, pale blue light flickered and then stayed on, illuminating the small space. “Pleasure to be back, Madam,” JARVIS’ crisp British came over the suit’s speakers, and damn if the AI actually sounded relieved. “Shall I begin with some diagnostics?”
Finally –
Lips pressing to the side of her neck was definitely among the top five wakeup calls Toni had ever had.
Steve nodded in acknowledgement, feeling a small part of him twinge in disappointment, but he was mostly worried. Toni had seemed a little sluggish earlier when they’d spoken, but she had still been all quick smirks and quicker retorts, so Steve had written it off as overprotectiveness.
Though he nodded, Tony could feel the minute shivers that occasionally rippled through his lover’s body. It was the first time, in Tony’s recollection, that he’d ever seen Steve truly shaken by something, and for the first time, the inventor realized that today must have been a nightmare that Steve had been dreading since they became serious. What else would have made him put the stupid rule in place to begin with? What else but fear could drive such a drastic measure?
“Gentlemen,” she greeted them cordially; devoid of emotion even as whimpers and sobs echoed out of the room from behind her. “Nat,” she added considerately, but Steve knew her voice; knew that face and her tone and those eyes, and knew that she was far from okay. “I’m not quite done, here.”
“I’m just saying,” Howard continued, seemingly unaware of Steve’s disapproval, “that you don’t need to shield me. I always knew she would be my biggest disappointment, but I guess not everyone can bat a thousand with their creations.”
It was amazing just how much trouble six-year-olds could find when they were motivated.
Then, all he knew was pain.
“It’s great,” he nodded, trying to muster up his usual level of conviction and failing dismally. “Yeah, it’s a good thing. We can just keep goin’ as we were.”
The thought steadied her frazzled nerves and she turned her attention back to the kid clinging to her. A cursory inspection as soon as the dust had settled, had revealed that he had sustained no real injuries aside from some possible bruising. Which was good, awesome even, because she had no Goddamn clue how she would have dealt with a scared kid who was also hurting.
It was a joke that Steve would likely not appreciate, and Toni made a note to herself not to bring it up to the super soldier as she secured herself on another ledge. For all the things in her past that Steve had had little to no trouble accepting, Howard Stark’s abuse had been the one thing to really trigger him.
And there was a lot that needed fixing, especially if Toni thought for one minute that she was anything like the twisted man her father had let himself become.
He nodded mutely, but granted her a tiny smile in response so Toni counted it as a win.
So instead of yelling at her, he’d stripped off his MIT hoodie and threw it around her shoulders before settling on the couch next to her and asking her what she was doing there. Warily, she’d explained that she was a student, and in stops and starts over the following two hours, Rhodes got the rundown on Toni Stark, girl genius.
That said, he could safely say that his brain had entirely shut down on him as he attempted to comprehend any of the words coming out of Brock Rumlow’s mouth.
Though the thought was so far from comforting, there was an element of working the numbers that steadied her nerves. Her hands were no longer shaking and her stomach wasn’t tying itself in knots, although getting in a breath was still difficult.
Steve needed no more motivation than those words, and his heart fairly leaped with hope. “Get a harness ready,” he instructed Rhodes as Bruce took his non-verbal command to move the equipment away. With any luck, they wouldn’t need it again. “I’m not letting her climb any more than she has to. I’ll go down to her and bring her up. Buck,” he turned to his best friend when Rhodes happily didn’t argue with him. The ex-assassin had grim determination in his features and was already carefully sliding into the spot that Bruce had vacated. “Be careful,” was all Steve cautioned with, seeing that Bucky already knew without asking what he was meant to do.
The relief almost crippled him when Bucky produced a long-range flashlight (from where, Steve would never know) and pointed it into the inky expanse, to finally shine on Toni some-100 feet below them.
The pressure started to gradually increase again, but this time, the pain was miraculously dulled to a slightly more tolerable level. Still excruciating, but his heart no longer felt like it would burst out of his chest from sheer agony, so Steve was profusely grateful.
Toni wondered how much he’d needed to psych himself up to ask that question. “Scrapes and bruises,” she lied easily, determinedly ignoring the bump at the back of her head still sluggishly bleeding and what she was pretty sure was cracked ribs. “Nothing life threatening.” That, at least, she was reasonably certain was the truth. “The kid is fine, too, I managed to get him to sleep.”
On anyone else, the super soldier might have thought that Tony had only been doing those things out of apparent feelings for him, but perhaps the worst thing about it was that Tony continued to do so after his conversation with Rhodes. After he was apparently “over Steve”. He was just that kind of person and just that kind of friend; and the blond had absolutely no clue why that was irking him.
, he’d claimed this morning, and when he sent her a subtle look, Toni had known with a blast of affection that Coulson had been talking about protection for
Raising a bruised hand, she sent the agents a clear denial of their help. Peter, whether he didn’t understand it, or simply didn’t care for it, didn’t heed the action, instead scampering into the workshop and making a beeline for her. He threw himself into her arms and she hushed him softly, trying to favour her knee and balance the child at the same time.
And now that he was thinking about it, the way Toni flirted, it probably didn’t take her very long if she wanted something either.
“Toni…”
His temper, she knew from vague and blurry memories, would be taken out on his work and her younger self, but not without the harsh comments that Maria had also always had to deal with.
She reached for Peter and pulled him into her arms just in time for him to avoid the slap.
Tony had gone on his stupid date; and came back looking happier and more content than he looked around anyone other than Steve.
Tony told them that he would have given up all that for Maria to still be alive.
“Sweetheart.” Steve cut her off with an equally fond and exasperated look. “You agreed to get checked out by the medics. You’ve been to hell and back. If he thinks that you should go to the hosp-…”
Howard smiled at them, and while it might have looked charming on his daughter, Steve just thought that he looked smarmy. “Heard you two needed a ride?”
A pause, and then,
It was as good a start as any.
? Why did you put yourself in danger for me? Even after what I did?”
Bucky, the little jerk, had known. Why the hell hadn’t he said something?
Toni’s voice continued to speak, steady despite the crazy plan she’d mapped out. Typical.
“Mommy, don’t go,” Peter hiccupped, and if not for the lump in her throat, Toni might have worried that she’d spoken out loud. Little arms wrapped around her neck with a strength that was at odds with Peter’s tiny frame. “I knew you were gonna come get me. Please don’t go.”
“Just like that,” she affirmed softly, quick fingers already stripping wires and trying to salvage what she could from the damage that had been sustained to the suit.
Nat’s hushed voice came over the speaker a few minutes after Toni’s last note hung in the air.
And for all that he’d done to her, Toni could still appreciate one lesson that Howard Stark had taught her growing up:
“Nope,” Tony shook his head, still sounding like he was battling for his legendary composure as he tried to explain. “Ryan… he was the first person that I ever loved.”
“We’ll take it,” Peggy answered swiftly, before Steve could. She turned to him and offered a quick reassurance. “Toni’s prototypes are generally good enough that they go directly into the main manufacturing line without any more tweaks, unless they’re from her because she wants to get creative. It would be God sent to have some Stark weaponry at your disposal for this.”
Barnes, for once, didn’t rise to the bait. “Stevie…” his voice faltered just slightly as he spoke his best friend’s name, and though it was wrong, Tony still felt a vicious spike of vindictive pleasure because it
He peppered kisses over her face until Toni was sure that he hadn’t missed a single spot, before fusing their lips together and kissing her deeply. “You’re safe,” he repeated roughly, the words rubbing his lips over hers again, seeing as he refused to move any further. “You’re home. I got you. I got you.”
Tony moaned around him and the vibrations made Steve growl involuntarily and rock deeper into the inventor’s mouth. He was careful this time, so Tony stayed around him, and with another few deep breaths and a dose of persistence, the other man’s mouth was finally stretched taut around Steve’s cock. Tony kept his mouth there, entrapping his whole dick in that wet, warm, perfect cavern, just for a few seconds, before pulling away and settling into another rhythm, suckling the sensitive head of Steve’s cock while stroking what wasn’t in his mouth with his hands. There was a delicious contrast between the slight callouses of Tony’s hands and the perfectly smooth, warm suction of his mouth, and it wasn’t much longer until Steve exploded too.
And as much as Toni had called him a sap, it hadn’t stopped her from getting a button designed to look like his shield, and stashing it in one of the armor’s hidden hollow panels.
Home. That sounded just about perfect. But first…
To the best of Bucky’s knowledge, that interaction between them had never seen the outside of Toni’s workshop. Not even Stevie knew what had transpired between them, as evidenced by the punk’s incessant badgering about it, and neither of them made any move to enlighten the curious Avengers.
Laura had been the first real interlude for him, on this general path of pain. She’d challenged him, fulfilled him, and introduced him to a whole new aspect of life, and himself, that he hadn’t even realized he’d been missing. For the first time in his life, Clint had smiled; not because it was what was expected of him, and not because the mission required him to, but because he’d been helpless not to do it. The swell of joy and affection as he’d looked upon the woman he knew had stolen his heart, had been far too powerful not to show. Gradually, and without him noticing, Laura had changed him… made him a far better man just by being the amazing woman she was, and Clint would have gone through all the pain, anger, loss and regret ten times over if it meant that it would always lead straight back to her.
Next in their developing home had been Clint, looking battered and lost, and like Steve, he hadn’t needed to say a word of explanation before Toni was welcoming him and explaining how his floor had the necessary vantage points and limited exposure to make him feel more secure in his environment. The archer had stopped Toni mid-explanation with a bone crushing hug, the most emotion either of them had seen out of him, and a weary mumble of thanks. None of them had asked what horrible thing had brought Clint to the tower that day, looking as wrecked as he had, and none of them ever would.
Cheers!
okay to hit girls.”
Steve slid his hand down the length of her body and slipped underneath her panties to cup her pussy. Two fingers skated between her slick folds and unerringly found her clit; at the same time that he began to toy with the sensitive bundle of nerves, the blond leaned forward and sucked her t-shirt covered nipple into his mouth, the suddenness of the dual sensations making her let out a gasp as she came.
She’d been about to sleep, he knew, since she’d forgone her bra, but it only worked in Steve’s favour as he had no barrier to concern himself with as skated a palm up her side and carefully, so carefully, cupped her breast in his hand, thumbing the stiff peak experimentally. It fit his palm perfectly, soft and supple and intoxicating by itself, but when it was coupled with a breathless little whine as she arched up into his hand… well, Steve thought he could be forgiven for taking her up on the invitation and latching his lips gently around the petal-pink nipple of her other breast.
Heaving an exaggerated sigh ( because Mommy sometimes did that and it always made Uncle Loki smile before he quickly pretended not to) Peter pushed the tall man on to the window seat before scrambling up to join him. Opening the curtain as wide as it would go, he beamed at the sight of the stars, happy that he could see them. Checking the Avengers clock on his bedside and seeing that it was still 11:06, Peter decided he had enough time to explain, and turned to face his companion.
HYDRA.
Steve wanted to snap out an order, wanted to do whatever he could to force Tony back into the protective confines of his suit, but he knew all too well that any sudden movements could kill him and Tony just as easily as whatever harebrained idea the genius had cooked up in the past thirty seconds. If Steve just shut up and stayed still… well, at least one of them would have a chance.
(And for the record, Bruce still grinned fondly at the thought.)
Bucky, thankfully, didn’t notice, his entire attention on Toni. “What happened, Doll?” he asked softly, tracing gentle fingers over the marks that had Stark relaxing visibly. “Did those morons try to get back at you for the sparring thing?”
“I know,” she replied with a smile, and he could see in her eyes that she believed him. It was enough, for now. “I love you too.” Flicking her head at the bike, she tugged him lightly towards it. “Let’s go home.”
It was what he’d come to dub the fake, public persona smile that often graced his lover’s face when she was dealing with the press, or some particularly annoying stakeholders who she wasn’t allowed to upset. It was the smile that let him know something deeper was going on under the surface, something that she had usually never hesitated to tell him about, not since they’d made love for the first time.
He’d gone out before, sure, but… this was different. He was with Tony, in that moment, and appreciation for the little things came easy when he was around the inventor. Right now, for instance. He was grateful for New York; he was grateful for chocolate ice-cream and sprinkles. He was grateful for summer breezes and quiet streets and sleepless nights that belonged to nothing and nobody but him and his best friend.
her AI.
Everything around Toni, save for the kid’s soft breaths, was completely still; oppressive in how it totally stifled one who generally surrounded themselves with noises of some kind as a way to drown out the noise in the back of their mind. There was no
Burying his face helplessly in Tony’s neck, he mumbled, “Sorry. I’m sorry. I’m not saying this right. I don’t know how to say it right.”
A relief. Of course.
“Here’s lookin’ at you, kid,” the guy grinned, and Steve got the aggravating feeling that he was missing a reference. That concern took a backseat as Tony moved forward without hesitation and brought the man into a hug. A hug that was way too long and familiar for Steve to be happy with. “Now, I’ve got the excuse of working a case, but why are you slumming the streets of New York at 3:30 in the morning?”
It did not make for ideal conditions to keep herself from panicking.
Shooting her gaze up to him, she saw that his eyes were glittering suspiciously as well, but above all, there was that depth of understanding that Steve had always had.
He swallowed painfully, tucking her face into his throat and kissing the top of her head with unfathomable gentleness. “I know, Toni, I know. But it’s okay now, I promise. I’m not gonna let anything hurt you anymore,” he vowed roughly, squeezing his eyes shut and praying that he wouldn’t have to break that promise anymore.
Steve knew that the words weren’t meant as any slight against him, and he didn’t take it as such either; Peter had latched onto Toni since she had saved him, and for the longest time, she had been the only one he’d trusted. At the beginning, it had been an interesting bond to watch unfold, mostly because the child had brought out the mother in Toni long before she could admit that he had. It’d taken Fate and a little bit of Howard Stark (though Steve was loathe to credit anything to that abusive sonofabitch that he still wished he could get his fists on) to make Toni realize that Peter was her son just as much as she was now his mother, for all intents and purposes. That had been close to two years ago and if anything, the time had only strengthened the relationship between mother and son.
Somewhere along the line – more than likely, the part of her story where Steve had entered, where the Avengers and Peter had entered – she had found a family that had accepted her, quirks and all. Loved her, even. They’d given her more than her father ever could.
“I was off the grid until I came to the Tower,” Steve explained numbly, and though he knew it was irrational, he couldn’t help feeling guilty. If he’d known, he’d have never let her face that alone, even back then when they had been on such rocky terrain.
“He was probably about to, after I just greeted him,” Tony pointed out reasonably. “Only now you’ve gone and interrupted. I hope you’re pleased with yourself.”
Stark. The anger cleared his mind, lit a fire under his skin. “Fuck them, and fuck all of you, too. I’m going to CT in three hours, I’m going to get my boyfriend back, and if any of you –
Ah, good old Rhodey. He was gonna yell so much after this.
Tony winced at his question and raised ravaged hazel eyes to his. “Bucky called me. Told me that you had a bit of a blow up at the team, and…”
“JARVIS, please,” he gasped out, stomach rolling as though he were about to be sick, “where is she? Where’s Toni? Where’s Peter?”
Comprehension dawned on her lover’s face, but indecision made him torn. “What happens when he launches himself at you, and he hurts you by mistake?” he demanded, even as he carefully draped the jacket over her and tried to maneuver the sleeves. “Wouldn’t that traumatize him even more?”
Toni, who was
And made his solemn vow to never, ever touch or come close to weaponry again.
Steve gaped a little, turning to face his backup. “What the hell was that?” he asked, partly amazed and partly unsettled by the firepower.
Steve tensed as Man-Child shrieked the last words and the blade, consequently, dug threateningly deeper. A thin line of warmth tracked down into the collar of his uniform, and Steve couldn’t pretend that it was sweat. For the first time in three days, Tony’s eyes flickered to his, and Steve’s chest seized at the wealth of emotions he saw in them.
“JARVIS, you with me?” she muttered quietly, nimble fingers working quickly but with painstaking care to secure the connection and stabilize it away from the rest of the exposed panel of circuitry.
The woman, Romanoff, seemed a little more reserved and a lot scarier, but she’d made a comment about how she’d told Steve to just come clean to Tony, so that put her firmly in Tony’s good graces.
Leaning down to suck another mark into Tony’s neck, Steve used the opportunity of distraction to slip his hand into Tony’s pants, thankful that the man had changed from his undersuit into a pair of sweats. Immediately, the inventor let out a strangled sound and his hips jerked forward, but Steve was strong enough to pin Tony’s hips back against his with nothing more than a large, insistent hand. “So responsive for me, my darling,” he praised softly, nipping the soft skin of Tony’s throat just to hear him gasp again, all while rubbing the front of Tony’s boxers. “You’re so hot like this, all wrapped up in my arms, letting me touch you…” Steve flicked his tongue out to trace the shell of Tony’s ear, enjoying the shiver it produced. “My pretty, sweet thing.” He punctuated the words with another roll of his hips, biting back a groan when Tony pushed his ass back against him.
Clint clenched his jaw, eyes cast over the expansive city that the Avengers Tower overlooked. He loved heights; ever since he was little, it’d always helped him to clear his mind; and Toni had seen to it that the refurbished Tower included a comfortable, but safe vantage point that gave him an unobstructed 360 degree view. Just one of the many things that she’d done for him – for this family – to turn an ordinary building into a home. Only now, for as much as his perch provided him with a sanctum of sorts, Clint didn’t think anything would clear his mind of the image that pervaded it.
So, without letting himself think long enough to back down, Steve blurted out, “I do when I’m half out of my mind with jealousy.”
“Hey, baby,” he crawled to her, fear clogging his throat and making him forget everything except for Toni and the fact that she was hurting. “How bad? Do you need to shut the suit down?” They would have a hell of a time explaining just what the inventor was doing there, and they’d need to find a way to get the suit off the train without anyone realizing that the pilot wasn’t in it anymore, but those were all semantics. Steve only cared about Toni in that moment.
Unfortunately, a side effect of his smart mouth was getting into altercations, and the fact that he was tied up and blindfolded didn’t seem to stop Steve’s abductor. A fist buried in his gut without warning, and the surprise of the attack left him unable to bite down a pained gasp of air or plant his feet to avoid crash-landing to the floor. It didn’t really matter, in the grand scheme of things, because barely an instant passed before someone was kicking him in the stomach, and then someone else in the middle of his back, while another person connected with the arm he’d hastily thrown around his vulnerable head.
He’d been relieved to see Toni the next morning, working on a prototype of what looked awfully like a shield to him and seeming cured from whatever she’d come down with the night before. He’d even managed to earn one of those bright, beautiful grins when Steve rebuffed all of what Howard was trying to sell him on and instead claimed the shield that Toni was working on for his own.

Steve flicked his gaze towards his best friend, hoping to warn him against any opinion that might upset Toni before he expressed them, but Bucky wasn’t even looking at him. Instead, he was aiming a wide, disbelieving grin at Toni.
As it were, however, the only thing that mattered was the fact that Steve was in trouble because of him.

, took for me?” Steve balked at the very thought, realization making him sick all over again. “Because I do. I know
And right in front of her eyes, Toni saw Steve’s heart break.
And what better way to honor his mother, and the sacrifice she’d made for him, than to turn SI clean?
“Mm?”
Steve watched in horror as her shirt shifted with the motion, the beginnings of black lines peeking out from beneath the material, and then abruptly receding with whatever she’d injected herself with.
Toni responded by leaning down and catching his lips with hers again, a needy little sound being torn from deep in her throat as Steve’s hand brushed up along her body. His intentions were obvious, from the movement of his hand to the deep and bruising quality his kisses were taking on, and Toni was entirely on board.
