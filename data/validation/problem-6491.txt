Tony has nothing to say to that, so instead he reaches out and picks up the discarded bottle of lubricant, taking Steve’s hand in his and pouring a generous amount over his fingers. Steve watches with half-lidded eyes, and Tony eyes his cock with a speculative expression.
“I was,” Steve admitted. He shrugged, putting a little fruit tart in his mouth. Everything tasted amazing. He just wished it wasn’t so small.
Tony thinks of Pepper, of the comfortable way they fit together now. “I think so,” he says, considering. He drizzles more syrup on top of the apple layers. “Almost full up.”
Tony smiles. He can’t help it. “A true gentleman,” he teases, but it’s the wrong thing to say. Steve’s shoulders lock, his whole body curling in on itself.
“Can’t I just want to give back? I’ve always said that the Memorial Park should get more use than SI employees eating lunch and tourists camped out with telephoto lenses trying to get a glimpse of The Avengers. It’ll liven up the place! Bring in children and nerdy college kids. And hipsters who like meteor showers.” He pauses, considering. “And, actually, probably some astrology nuts who wanna see Scorpio or whatever and wear crystals aligned with their chakras, but hey, fuck those people.”
He watched Tony for a few more moments, the shine of the armour in the setting sun, the graceful arc of each trajectory Tony took in the air. Eventually, he cut the connection and turned to step inside.
“Did we ever brief you on Pleasant Hill?” Tony asks, tilting his head to the side. His eyes don’t move to look at Steve, but that doesn’t matter. They’re the only ones in the room. Both Bruce and Clint had elected to be elsewhere.
Steve drags himself across a desert he has never seen, only knowing it from SHIELD files and half-laughing comments, self-deprecating and often drunk. He is looking for Tony, and Steve will fail, because no one saved him in Afghanistan. Tony saved himself, cut open and aching with it, with bomb scraps and a battery attached to his chest. Still he walks, the sun scorching his skin, and the sunburn never ceasing. His throat burns with sand and dry heat, and he does not stop for the oasis. He knows by now that the water will be nothing but a heat mirage.
,” Loki says, tone unreadable, and Tony cackles. “Not wholly unpleasant. The meat is sweet. Delicate.”
“You good?” he slurred, consonants softened by sleep. Clint sometimes struggled with annunciation without his hearing aids in, and being exhausted likely didn’t help.
,” he groans, more whine than word, and when he looks down Loki’s eyes are glittering bright with wetness. He looks frantic, his moans becoming more and more wanting, and Tony tangles his right hand into Loki’s hair and pulls, using it to direct him, to move him roughly in accordance with his hips. The noise that Loki looses is
“Easy,” Tony quipped, grinning wolfishly. “Satisfaction, the wonder of modern blockers, and—when all else fails—NDAs and aggressive lawyers. Thanks to the efforts of activists working tirelessly for decades, my right to non-disclosure is now protected by law. God bless America.”
“Colbert’s already got Americone Dream,” Steve said, yawning. He blinked, rubbing at his eyes. “What time is it?”
“A moment’s rest,” Loki says, and Tony can’t argue with that. He lets Loki touch him, exploring his body with gentle fingers. It feels nice enough. He closes his eyes. “You’re a singular creature, Tony Stark.”
, is the problem, which means it’s probably something like magic. They’re still waiting to hear back from Wong.
“Mr. Barton is on the target range with Ms. Romanov. Thor is having a meal in the common area. They seem agitated, but not overly so.”
“Not from the court or the council; they are all loyal, but most are best suited to policy and law. None are fit to become the leader of armies as my father has been. But from the rest of our family…perhaps, should word get out.”
“I know,” Bruce says, but Tony doesn’t know if he really hears him. Eventually, he heads for the elevator and back up to the penthouse.
"Tesla save us," Tony says. Pepper laughs at him and tosses her head to get some of the hair out of her face.
“I think you like it when I make fun of you,” Tony says, and Steve turns a deadpan expression on him. “Nope, that stern face doesn’t work on me anymore! You’re too far away to be scary. I can just hang up if I want to.”
“Yeah,” Steve whispers, and then he’s lifting, pushing Tony up the wall and ducking down until his knees are hooked over Steve’s broad, steady shoulders.
Loki sneers, pulling a white linen cloth from seemingly thin air. He uses it to wipe the blood from his hands, his face. “Thor made the same mistakes, as ever. Even bitter experience cannot teach a fool.” He gestures casually back towards the portal. “Do you wish to study his device, or keep the evidence beyond the arm of Midgardian law?”
The woman interviewing him was a blonde that Steve didn’t recognise, but Tony had an easy rapport with her that spoke to a casual acquaintance. Tony was just the slightest bit realer with her than he was with the average reporter. It was something Steve had only seen with a handful of journalists, ones that Tony really respected.
“It’s not,” Steve says. He glances up at the nano-housing, then down to Tony’s still mostly-soft cock. “I know you don’t want to talk about it, but that kiss…if this was a fairy tale kinda curse. Well.”
“I had questions, about the injections,” Steve tried to explain, and he sounded pleading even to his own ears. “You have such a history of- well, no. I shouldn’t blame you. I’m not, I just want you to understand, I thought something was wrong maybe, and you weren’t telling me. You never
“Please,” Steve whispers, and Tony sinks into him at the sound of it. He presses a desperate kiss to Tony’s temple, holding him as tight as he dares. “Please, Tony. Just talk to me.”
“Tell me, Stark, if you love a woman as much as you claim to love Pepper Potts, why would you leave her pale mortal form so woefully unprotected?”
“You little minx, you know exactly how fucking tempting you smell after a run,” Tony bit out, voice rough and deep, and Steve opened his legs wider in response.
“What, me? Never,” Tony says, pouting, and Pepper pulls him into her office with a huff. “Why am I still being dragged around? I answered your question. I even did all my paperwork this week!”
reactions, was a black and white picture of Tony wearing a white t-shirt with a symbol Steve had never seen before on it, framed in the V of an unzipped, oversized black leather jacket. From the viewer’s perspective, it looked like that was the only clothing he was wearing at all.
“How much kissing are we talking, here,” Clint says, wiggling his eyebrows, and Steve flushes at the insinuation. “Ooh, incriminating!”
“Jesus,” Tony breathes, and Steve’s grin shifts a little, turns just a shade off wicked. Tony wants to eat him alive. Or maybe be eaten. He hasn’t decided, yet. “Please, not the accent.”
Steve listened with a small smile, accepting bites as Tony offered them. He wasn’t even sure that Tony was aware that he was doing it, his instinctual need to feed Steve kicking in as he focussed on giving Steve a history of Chinese-American migration from the 1800’s to present-day. Still, there was something guarded about him, something he wasn’t telling Steve. The moment had passed, though, and it was too late to ask him, especially now that he seemed to be settling a bit. So Steve smiled, and let Tony feed him, and asked questions at the appropriate moments. He could bring it up the next time Tony took his medication.
“Depends on how you react to the rest of my story I suppose,” Tony says. He’s carefully nonchalant, and Steve braces himself for whatever doozy of a sentence he’s about to be subjected to. “My father caught me in bed with the beta son of a competitor.”
“God, I’m…look, I really-” Steve let his breath out in a rush, prying his hand away from his eyes to try to face Tony head on. His expression was impassive, but his eyes looked wild, almost fearful. Tony’s eyes always betrayed him. He had the most expressive eyes Steve had ever seen. “I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable. I really enjoy spending time with you. I didn’t want to be one of those-… Well. I guess it doesn’t really matter, what I was trying to do.”
Tony wasn’t going to win any ribbons, that was for sure. He didn’t think any two pieces of onion were cut the same. He sliced canned tomatoes, added some garlic, some spice for warmth. He couldn’t tell the difference between the paprika and the chilli, but Rogers said the stew needed both so it didn’t matter either way. He cubed potatoes, carrots, added dried red peppers. He tossed in a few cubes of beef from the icebox out back, added some water, then covered the whole thing and let it bubble on its own.
Tony let out a quiet sound, almost like a stopper being pulled on an airtight jar. It was enough to make Steve’s chest feel like something was squirming inside of it, and he stepped around the island to wrap his arms around Tony from behind, resting his chin on his alpha’s shoulder. He pressed the newly filled coffee mug into Tony’s trembling hands.
“Actually,” Tony says, “I didn’t even know what was happening until…” He stops, closes his eyes. Teresa Alvarez’s face stares back at him.
“So where do you need me?” Wilson asks, and Natasha glances over at Tony for a moment before shrugging easily.
“Why Captain Rogers, are you proposing to me?” Tony inquired, voice teasingly scandalised. “How very forward of you.”
“No, see, I don’t think that’s true,” Beth says, and her smile spreads into the kind of grinning triumph that Tony knows to be wary of. “It was magic, wasn’t it?”
“It’s me,” Reed counters, and Tony sucks in a breath. His eyes dart up to meet Reed’s for a moment before flickering away again. “It’s you and me, Tony. Let me help you.”
“I’m so sorry, Tony,” Steve says, and Tony rubs a hand over his face, exhausted and feeling it in every inch of his bones.
Bucky snorts. There’s the tell-tale sound of a zipper being closed. “Sharon told me you used to be better at having friends.”
He places a hand over the light of the arc reactor, looks down at the blue gleaming from between his calloused fingers. Tony’s heart has always been weak, in every sense of the word. Soon, the Bond Sickness weaken it further, or the Bond will wither and die. He’s been here before, hasn’t he? He survived long enough to stop an alien invasion and save all of the New York Metropolitan Area from a nuke. Roughly 12 million deaths, give or take. The whole world, if the Avengers lost the battle without his help. He’s revolutionised clean energy, medical technology. He’s on the verge of a breakthrough in material science. Nanotech. True, adaptive, fully-functional nanotech. In a few years, probably, he can make it work.
“Well.” The priest hums. “First off, lusting after your soulmate is quite natural, and even mostly permissible in scripture, so I think we can let that one slide.”
“This was incredible fun,” Jaime says, a crooked smile breaking over his face. “Really, everyone had a great time, Dr. Stark. Please don’t worry about us.”
“I didn’t even get to touch you,” Tony says, shimmying his hips a little to get his pants and boxers back up and over them in one go while his hands are still tied. The look in Steve’s eyes as he watches is nothing short of ravenous.
Tony is halfway back to despair when he returns. His hands—ever steady as they solder and spot weld, as they build the shape of new machines, new beings—tremble ever so slightly as they reach out, fingers spread, searching for Steve in the open air. When Steve goes to him, worried that his ability to touch will fail him in this crucial moment, Tony takes his face between his calloused palms and presses their foreheads together. He closes his eyes and breathes in and out, as though he’s trying to remember Steve’s scent.
“For when your hearing aids aren’t in,” Tony had said, shrugging. “You can make the flashlight strobe, too, if you want. I added some settings.”
So, first of all, an apology. It’s been a long time since I’ve updated, obviously, and the honest truth is that it’s just been so fucking hard to write this story in light of the recent U.S. election and current political events. I am a queer, brown, and chronically ill second-generation American citizen. A close family member recently got deployed to the Middle East. So, I don’t think I really need to explain more than that, if you really read what I wrote out here. Many of the political figures on the security task force in this chapter are real people, and I have tried to align their characters to their comments on the record about relevant real-life events.
Tony brings the slender tip of one restraining tentacle up to Steve’s flushed cock. He dips the very tip into his slit, and Steve’s back bows, his mouth open with no sound emerging. He’s a fucking vision. Tony is so, so lucky, he’s just unbelievable-
“It’s 1:36 PM on Saturday, April 9th, Captain,” JARVIS supplies obligingly. Steve gapes, sitting up in bed with more force than he probably should have. His entire body feels like one giant bruise. “How are you feeling?”
Tony keeps on walking, right up to the break in the glass partition where Steve had sat and painted weeks ago.
“Listen to me,” he says, and Tony closes his mouth. “I’ve never been as close to anyone as we’ve become and had it be platonic. Not once in my life have I had a friend like you. Do you understand what I mean?”
“Sleep,” Rogers said, settling down behind Tony. His grip loosened a little, but that was alright. Tony wasn’t planning on going anywhere.
“Gooey,” Tony tells him. He squeezes Steve’s fingers, and Steve blushes prettily. He swallows, brushing his thumb over Tony’s knuckles.
“This is a security taskforce, Thad, not the International Olympic Committee! If you want to make that argument to the senate, be my guest, but Stark’s right; there’s no way you’ll get the bill through a democratically controlled congress, and I won’t be a part of it. We’d be in direct violation of the constitutional rights of American citizens, and I, for one, don’t support apartheid.”
“If you think I’m playing you for money, you’re a real spooney,” Rogers snorted, and Tony laughed. For the space of a breath, he let himself rest his forehead against the cool surface of the sheriff’s jacket, breathing in the musky scent of the man. Rogers was always so warm. His voice was soft when he spoke, fingers squeezing gently at Tony’s hip. “Come on, old boy. Let’s get you into the house.”
The smile that Steve levels him with is indulgent, drowsy. His hair is a lopsided mess, soft spikes of dark gold in the low light. Steve runs a hand through it as he watches, and Tony wants so badly to settle back into the curve of his neck and stay there forever. Steve’s Brooklyn brogue is thick as molasses in his soft, smiling mouth. He feels more real than he’s ever felt before, touchable and sweetly tender.
“Nothing,” Tony says. He swallows down the urge to cry, sucks in a shaky breath. “That’s all just me, sorry.”
He’s not dressed for running. It’s brisk outside, the threat of winter still not quite gone from the city, and he’s standing outside in slacks and chucks, a button down shirt over a cotton tee because he was going to ask Tony if they could actually go out tonight and see a movie in theatres. They haven’t done that in a while. He closes his eyes and listens to the horns and chatter of midtown at night, the humid air on his face, the smell of salt and wet. He starts walking south.
“Hey,” Steve says, and Tony blinks. Right. He’s still on the phone. Steve’s back, dressed in a plain SHIELD-issue t-shirt and sweatpants. He’s sitting cross-legged on his bed, his hair all rumpled. He’s so cute. “I can probably come out there tomorrow, but I can’t leave now. I have some things I need to take care of here first.”
Tony cackles, pressing one finger into Steve’s steely chest. “Is that your ammo? Honey, I know my faults, unlike some people who’ve got their heads so far up their own arse they can’t see the truth when it stabs them in the back. Jealous, baby? All you had to do was ask. I’ve had a dozen men like you, I know you’ve seen the tabloids. Did you watch me, in all my grainy glory? Is that what you’re sore about? Or, not sore, I suppose, that’s the problem, isn’t it? Because if that’s all, you should remember that I’m the one who feeds and pays you, and Daddy knows how to scratch that-”
“And yet, you are mine.” Tony flutters his eyelashes at the nearest surveillance camera. “You know better than anyone that I’ve had plenty of pets, and none of them have been dogs.”
” Tony pressed down on his sweet spot with two fingers and Steve couldn’t help but shout, fingers digging into the sheets.
“I get tired just listening to you talk about everything you’ve been handling,” Steve murmurs. He presses a soft kiss to Tony’s throat. “I’m sorry, about earlier. I know you’ve had a lot going on.”
Tony gives it to him. He pushes and doesn’t stop, just keeps going, trusting the slickness of his skin and Steve’s unbelievable body. He keeps going until the widest part of the ligula slips into Steve with a squelch that he can feel, and Steve lets out a broken whine and presses his face hard into Tony’s chest. He pants openmouthed against the skin, his whole body shaking.
“If you might direct your attention to the television, I think we are finally seeing the results of Mr. Laufeyson’s promise to you.”
Eventually, Steve wasn’t even able to get hard anymore, not that that had ever stopped Tony before. Time stretched out, narrowed down to the feel of Tony slipping inside of him, his mouth marking Steve, his fingers scratching through his hair.
“Don’t be an idiot, Tony, get the fuck out of there!” Tony slams a hand against the elevator shaft in frustration. “Steve, he can melt any metal. If he hits the reactor-”
, Tony thinks, considering. He isn’t sure what the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell situation is in Nigeria, but he hopes none of these women get fired for reacting to a lady sorcerer’s sex magic. In another, Barnes destroys an entire platoon of soldiers, just a complete mindless massacre. Tony closes that one before he can watch yet another neck get snapped with ruthless efficiency, as well as Moonstone’s. He’s pretty sure that she just broke one agent’s spine in that last shot, and that’s not something he needs to see right now. Once he sees Executioner get a hold of his axe again, he shuts the whole thing down. He saw what that thing did to Rhodey’s guns, as well as his forcefield. He doesn’t need to see what it will do to a human combatant.
I will apologise for posting so late, but I’m sure many of you can sympathise. I will say this: no matter how long it takes me, I am committed to finishing this story because it’s become somewhat personal to me. It’s become important to try to save this contained, fictional universe from mutually assured destruction, even or especially because we might not be able to save the real one. So I can’t promise a steady update schedule, but I will promise that unless otherwise stated, this story is not and will not be orphaned. Please bear with me as I try to muddle through these difficult and real-life relevant issues with as much grace as I can manage. Thank you for all your comments over the past few months. They really helped me to keep going, and I appreciate them all dearly.
“Without taking them out,” Pepper finishes. Her voice shakes a bit, but she doesn’t hesitate, and Tony remembers all over again why he loved her, why he loves her, and deeply. “When do you need it?”
Natasha narrows her eyes at him, measuring his resolve before nodding, once. Tony swallows, then punches in Pepper’s number.
“No,” he decides, mouth twisting into a moue. “Steve won’t like any of this, and his stubbornness isn’t exactly what we need at the negotiating table right now. And he’s still in recovery.”
“Let me stay here,” Steve finds himself saying. “Just for the night. We don’t have to do anything, I just…I don’t think we should be alone, tonight. Either of us.”
“What manner of sorcery does this foe possess?” Thor cuts in, albeit begrudgingly. “I have seen Stark’s armour withstand much.”
Steve shakes the thought off. He and Tony need to talk and figure out their Bond before he thinks about taking a job that will force him to leave home for extended periods of time.
Thor eyes him with a sour twist burgeoning on his face. “I have apologised much for my misplaced ire. I recognise that you were as much player to my brother’s machinations as you were engineer of them.”
Thor nods, glancing down at his folded arms. His expression softens, an unbearable kindness overtaking his face as he turns to meet Tony’s eyes. “You surprise me, too, Tony Stark,” he says solemnly. “Every day. But I shall comfort myself in the knowledge that humans have much less time to grow; you cannot take a thousand years to learn a lesson.”
“That makes me sound like a supervillain,” Tony crows, laughing, but he does as he’s told. After all, Thor can be wise, too, sometimes.
“Just to the living room,” he said, while Steve frowned at him. He wasn’t pouting. He wasn’t. “Baby, we’ve been in here for almost five days, and as sexy and gorgeous and irresistible as you are, I haven’t felt the sun on my face in over a month.”
“You’ll find that I can, actually,” Loki says, but he sounds more tired than anything. “This morning you were ready to fall into my arms with thanks for having a corrupt man removed from a position of power. Now you wish to punish me for killing someone who sought to end your life, and that of your family? Ms. Potts? Your dear Captain?”
He imagines Tony’s face under the curve of his shield. He remembers blood splattered across the metal, hands pulling him up and off of Tony’s snarling, wild-eyed body. The way fear and fury had warred across his eyes like snarling dogs, twisting his expression into something ruthless and forbidding.
“This weapon was used on you,” Loki observes, eyes narrowed. Tony swallows. “You fear it. And yet you chose to let your assassin take it into battle alongside you.”
“What do you mean, you were right,” Steve asked, suspicious, and Stark turned bright eyes on him. He’d seen him working enough to know that this was Stark excited about a puzzle. Steve just didn’t know how he felt about that puzzle being him.
“Steve wanted to go out,” Tony sighs, sounding a little guilty, “and he thought The Lobster sounded kind of weird and fun.”
He’s standing across from Tony, which is enough to make Steve’s breath shudder in his noncorporeal chest. He’s seen the footage of Tony breaking down at his funeral. He doesn’t want to be here, to see this. Between them, he can see his own body. His face is pale and unmarred, sealed up in some sort of cryochamber. He tries to press his hands to the glass pane, but they go right through.
Steve lets out a broken-off moan, then bites his lip, flushing red all the way to his ears. Interesting reaction, that. Tony grins and bookmarks that for later.
Steve, of course, won’t leave him, and so JARVIS carries them both back to the tower. Steve hops onto Iron Man’s boot like he’s always done and wraps his arms around the armour’s neck. He doesn’t say anything when they land, but he’s watching Tony like a hawk.
Tony considers him, eyes narrowing for a moment before he smiles. It’s a tiny thing, just the feeblest uptick of one corner of his mouth, but it’s genuine for all that. “Me, too.”
“Nothing,” Tony tells him. He glances over at his armour, which probably has tentacle goo in it now. “I guess I’ll have to clean that.”
Something about the way he says it makes Steve pause. Maybe it’s how tired he sounds, as though there’s no joy in his triumph. Unbidden, Steve thinks of his conversation with Pepper yesterday, and then the myth of Cassandra. Tony looks hunted, more than anything, and Steve reaches out and places a hand on his knee.
“Then we talk it out,” Steve says, something between a laugh and a sigh escaping him. He pulls away and offers Tony a wink. “Not that we’ve found anything I don’t like yet. Maybe I like things that are too out there for you, huh? What then?”
Clint waves a hand over his shoulder in response, disappearing around the corner towards the maintenance stair to the roof. Steve watches him go with what he expects is a mournful expression, because what he feels for Tony makes him want to run and hide, or on some days, level a building. Instead he turns around and puts a hand on the side of the doorway. He meets Tony’s unreadable expression with aplomb, straightens his shoulders.
“Guess I’m making you a new star, then, Sheriff.” Rogers’s smile was sheepish, and Tony glared him. “You’re a real piece of work, you know that?”
Tony blinks, his eyes tilting over to where Peter’s perched at the island. Steve can’t bear to tear his eyes away from Tony. He’s still got two fingers in his mouth. But whatever Tony sees there makes his eyes crinkle. He looks a little smug, and Steve can imagine exactly what Peter’s face is doing. MJ or not, Steve’s seen him flirting with Wade.
“You’re stuck with me, now,” Tony teased, but he was grinning about it. Something in Steve’s face made the smile slip from his lips, though, turn serious and gentle. He traced over the line of Steve’s cheekbone with one calloused thumb.
“Oh, well. Tony said they wanted him, and they weren’t going to be paying attention to me at all. And Tony said he trusted my brain. So while they were-” There was a crackle of static, and Steve frowned and waited. “Sorry about that. We figured if I was real good they’d stop watching me so well after a while. So while they were
“I believe Sir left an old sweatshirt in the workshop as well. I will have DUM-E find it and lay it out for you.”
Tony’s hands pressing his beautiful grey suit to Steve’s neck, then giving up. Tony’s voice in his ear, shouting into the Avengers emergency line. Tony’s fingers pressed tight against Steve’s pulse as his blood leaks steadily from his body.
Loki snaps his hips sharply, making Tony cry out. It’s muffled by Loki’s fingers pressing against his tongue. “Have I lost your attention?”
"Yes," Cap and Loki say at the same time. "We're almost done here. Loki, why don't you show yourself and we can talk?"
“Still want my knot?” Tony asked, and Steve let out a little involuntary cry of pleasure as Tony skidded the head of his cock over his entrance.
Then, for emphasis, he tilts Steve’s head down towards him, tiptoeing a half-step to kiss his forehead. Steve’s hands grip his shirt, a shuddering breath punching out of him. The shaking starts up again, and Tony waits, lips pressed warm and firm to Steve’s brow as Steve pulls himself together again.
“Filthy little minx,” Tony growled, but there was nothing but affection in his voice, and Steve melted under the praise. “You’re one to talk about being easy.”
The repulsor node fires, and Kitty Pride jumps up out of the floor and rolls to the side just as what looks like a hash of white statics into being in the space that she had occupied. Kitty fires on it again, and a strange, blood-curdling shriek can be heard, like a man’s voice over imperfect radio waves.
Steve pressed Tony’s hand over his heart, letting him feel the way it was trying to beat its way out of his chest. He dipped his head to press his forehead to Tony’s, watching the way Tony’s eyes widened.
“How much do you know about the Cold War?” Xavier asks, and Steve frowns. “We also allied with Russia, at the time. Plenty of room for grey, there. And you should know better than anyone that America didn’t want to get involved in the war. There was rampant anti-Semitism here. Americans didn’t want to accept Jewish refugees, much the way Americans now view asylum seekers from Central and South America.”
Tony closes his eyes, then takes his clothes off slowly, the way a lover might. He lets Steve run his hands over his shoulders, down his chest. They move slowly this time. It’s tentative. Later, nestled once again between Tony’s legs, rutting lazily against each other, Steve learns that he can, in fact, reach orgasm if he works at it enough. Tony proves more than willing to put the time in, and he buries the shaking moan that bursts out of him in his lover’s mouth. He wishes he could feel Tony’s breath on his face.
Steve grinned, waving a hand over his shoulder, and retreated into the penthouse. It was cold, and he wanted some soup.
“As ever, sir, I am your humble servant. I try to gather information that will allow me to serve you as best I’m able.”
, he thinks, staring at the large, dark barrel Tash and Clint have slammed down on the team dining table,
Steve shakes his head, forehead rolling back and forth against Tony’s chest, and Tony strains to hear. Steve is apologising. Over and over, sobbing with it, his shoulders shaking. Tony’s stomach flips over in place.
Loki puts his mouth on every square inch of his body in the shower, or at least that’s what it feels like. They’re both panting for it, so Tony blows him in the shower while opening him up with his fingers, then has him over the sink where their blurry reflection slowly clears to reveal Loki’s face, flushed red and gasping. When he comes for the third time, Tony comes with him, and then they have a long bath in the jet tub, just because they can.
“You see how Sif is treated, is revered. You have heard Thor’s stories, his legends of Lady Sif and the Warriors Three.” Tony nods, spits, continues brushing. Loki is gathering dignity to himself like a white dwarf, gaining mass and power before his eyes. His spine straightens as he speaks. “Amora had to fight to be taught. She was not one of the chosen. She went through much of the same struggles as Sif did, and yet she is seen as sluttish and craven for trying to curry favour with men who might advance her skill. What did Sif do, that Amora did not? What is the difference between Sif’s devotion to Thor, her desire for him, and Amora’s? Yet because Amora is an enchantress, she is seen as lesser. It is a familiar tale.”
Tony stills, laser focus finding its target. He does not turn around. “Wow, you really didn’t learn your lesson, huh? I know it’s hard to get anything through your thick, stubborn skull, but hot damn Gunslinger you’re really going for it this time.”
Through eavesdropping on Tony’s calls, he’d found out that practically every scientist Steve could think of had looked him over before he’d woken up as a ghost. He’d thought that maybe Xavier would be able to see him,
“No worries,” Tony says, waving a hand. He even means it, too. He’s feeling magnanimous, now that he’s a bit more covered up. “I’m not dead. Suit’s shiny and new. No complaints from me, scout’s honour.”
“It’s not,” Steve says, serious now. He leans in until their foreheads knock together, nose gently brushing against Tony’s. “I almost can’t believe this. I thought-… I kinda thought you knew, and were just…ignoring it, or-”
Tony studies him for a moment before a sluggish, foul kind of grin overtakes his face: more of a rictus of pain than anything else. “J, could you play it back for Cap here?”
“Take off your shirt.” Bruce tugs gently on Tony’s hem for emphasis, and Tony rises off the table just enough to let Bruce peel his ratty Soundgarden t-shirt off of him and toss it to the side. “Where’s it hurt most? Besides your lower back.”
, “for years, Tony. So if you don’t feel that way about me, I…” He swallows, visibly steeling himself, and Tony watches his throat move with heat pooling in his groin. “I can’t do this once. I can’t…I can’t be a one and done.”
“I feel I should inform you both that Agent Barton and Agent Romanov are together at present. They are watching Burn Notice and shouting invectives at the television in response to what they deem to be egregious inaccuracies.”
"Yeah, 'cause you guilted me into it," Sam gasps, voice laboured. "Remember that conversation we had before you got yourself kidnapped? About you being an asshole?"
Tony yawns into his coffee cup. “Mmph.” He rubs a careless hand across his nose. “Sorry. Morning, Luke. Morning, Tiny Human.”
“I shouldn’t have pushed you,” Steve explained. “It’s not right. I should have respected your choice-”
“Good crying?” Steve asked, but he was grinning, fierce and full of as much love as he could muster.
“Lies, all of it,” Tony says, but he’s smiling enough that it’s audible in his voice. “What would she know?”
“Fuck, that’s hot,” Tony groaned, and Steve’s head snapped back to him sure as a rubber band. “When is this fucking torture gonna be over?”
“It just hurts because I know he’s hurting, and I want to be with him,” Steve said, shaking his head. “It doesn’t mean anything, Thor. Don’t worry about it.”
“Okay, Tony,” Steve concedes, and the grin he flashes over his shoulder is boyish. “Good morning, by the way.”
to you. I, uh. I watched some of your interviews, where you talk about gender and sex and anti-dynamicism. I hope that’s ok. It seems like it’s really shaped your political beliefs and your moral principles. I want to know your mind.”
“A few weeks past. Rogers sent me this…this letter,” Tony says, frowning. Rhodey makes a face at the use of Rogers’ name, but Tony chooses to ignore it. “And a phone.”
Tony ambled over to the stove, peeking gingerly at his efforts. “Depends on your view of edibles,” he deadpanned.
There’s no one waiting for confession, which is a miracle, but then again it’s a Wednesday. Times have changed. There’s probably fewer devout Catholics around now than there were, not that Steve would really know. There are little things he’s forgotten about churches. How quiet they are, for one, in a singular kind of way. The city is so loud, but in here, it’s a clean white resonant chamber. Like standing inside a shell at the beach: that quiet rush of air that doesn’t sound quite like anything else, stretched out and made loud. The quiet susurrus of his own breathing reflected back at him by polished stone. The soft squeak of his trainers on the gleaming floors. Steve dips his fingers in the basin and crosses himself, muttering a little prayer and bowing to the cross. Then he turns and ducks into the confessional booth, pulling the door closed behind himself.
Steve just hummed, pressing a soft kiss to the skin there. Tony was warm, his fingers curling through his hair, and Steve was going to have to share him, tomorrow.
The line cuts out. Tony stares at the phone in his hands, breathes in. He can remember with uncomfortable clarity the anxiety in Pepper’s voice every time he’d called her in the days before, terrified that some awful thing was happening to him and that he was making a last confession. The Battle of New York had changed things for both of them, mostly for the worse, and Tony can see now how much better their relationship is when Pepper only has to worry about her best friend and her boss dying, not her lover as well. It’s a distinction he might not have noticed a few years ago, but he’s learning. Pepper taught him a lot of things, in retrospect; patience, and how to listen, and honesty. He’s still working on that last one.
“Of course,” he hisses, and flips himself over and sits up. Loki is standing over him, hands ablaze with golden light. His eyes are lit bright and glittering green, entire body triumphant.
“Take me to bed and I’ll fuck you so hard your immortality will leak out your ears,” Tony blurts out, which doesn’t make much sense but, well. Fourteen. That’s about on par for how he feels right now.
“Focus. Amora. Brainwashing. Getting drunk. Nat, hold this steady?” Clint heaves the barrel over onto its side, and Natasha holds it in place while he opens the tap over the snifter. “Here.”
“I thought you said Xavier cleared you,” he says. Steve takes a step towards him, but Tony holds his hands up in repulsor position, an obvious threat. Steve rolls back on his heels, looking like he’s been shot. “I…stay there.”
“No throwing food,” she said, and Clint fell to the ground with a thump. Steve wasn’t entirely sure how she’d done it. Clint just lay on his back and stared at the ceiling with a look of betrayal. “It’s not Tony’s fault you suck.”
**spoilery elaboration: consider Charles’ whole “Hey use your holocaust pain to fuel your powers! That’s not directly against primum non nocere or anything” song and dance. An amazing telepath? Sure. Does he get results? Definitely. Is what he does at all what the American Psychological Association would call ethical? Lol. That in mind, take these therapy sessions with a grain of salt. Xavier’s a genius, but also kind of an asshole sometimes. Steve does kinda need a kick in the pants, tho. Guess we’ll see how this works out for him?
Stephen doesn’t say anything, and Tony turns back to him. His grey eyes are narrowed, suspicious, and Tony throws up his hands.
“No, no,” Tony says, but there’s something happening inside of him. Something bubbling up in his chest.
Loki covers his mouth with one hand, eyes flashing wildly between green and gold. “Silence,” he intones, low and dangerous, and the voice that he speaks with is one from stories Tony’s atheist mind had always thought nothing of, a sound brimming up from stone-old tales and deep, unfathomed power. It is terrible. It echoes, in his ears and in his mind, and in the air skating over his skin. “You know nothing of which you speak, you impudent mayfly child. You have no concept of the possible ruin you could bring, not just to this world but to all nine realms, to galaxies, to your own stinking
Steve swallows and stares at the floor counter, trying to keep his mind clear, his muscles lax, his pulse steady. It’s a harder task than he expects.
Hulk smirks at that. “Star Man stupid,” he tells Steve. “Star Man make Tin Man think Star Man not like him.”
“Why are you embarrassed?” Tony asks, curiosity sparkling to life in his veins. He sits up a little. “Look at you, Pinkie Pie, you’re adorable.”
Pepper spreads her hands, and Tony scrolls through the intel she’s handed him, wincing at some of the more…conservative proposals being suggested.
: two unalike minds in tandem, ideas bouncing off of each other. You fail when he refuses to engage you. You fall apart.” He reaches out and touches Tony’s shoulder, gently enough. He doesn’t look away from what he’s doing at all, but the soft touch is enough to make Tony relax. He takes a deep breath, lets it fill him full before relaxing back onto Reed’s hand. “Your true magnificence lies in your omnidirectional intelligence. You need sounding boards, to help you corral your own ever-expanding mind. You’ve never had the focus I do.”
Steve nodded, thankful that JARVIS had thought to answer his unspoken question. The AI was unreasonably good at that, but Steve supposed he’d been built to anticipate the needs of those in his care. “That’s…really good to hear, JARVIS. Thank you.” He smiled, reaching out to stop the microwave right before it beeped and pulling the container out. He fished a spoon out of the open dishwasher and dug in. “I liked her a lot.”
“He needs you,” Bruce says, and Tony takes in a slow, shaking breath. He turns back to the silent stairwell.
He hadn’t seen the extent of Tony’s injuries before, and now he was glad for it. He wasn’t sure if he would have been able to stop himself from breaking into SHIELD’s facilities and slaughtering the rest of the Hydra agents they’d brought in for questioning, Riri and Tony’s proselytising be damned. A nasty yellowing bruise was wrapped all across Tony’s ribcage, smaller cuts and marks scattered over his skin. He’d lost weight, visibly, his usually healthy olive skin stretched a little too tight over the coruscating lines of his ribs, the sharp bones of his wrist, the contours of his knees. And still, for all that, the sight of him was enough to make Steve desperate, his mouth drying out, his eyes heavy. He closed them, taking a slow breath, and Tony’s scent was fresh and real and there: the musk-sweet smell of autumn decay, metal, a high, sharp tang.
“I don’t know how to separate trust from hope anymore,” he admits, turning back to Pepper. The expression on her face is familiar, and Tony rolls his eyes at her. “Don’t.”
“No,” Tony says, but it’s not in answer to his question. That much is obvious to Steve as well, who looks a little like he’s going to be ill. “No, no, no, Steve! We are walking a knife’s edge right now! If your old buddy, an enhanced, shows up and kills someone-”
And it doesn’t matter, that Tony had once again proved himself to be un-killable, unbeatable. It doesn’t matter that Tony has always saved himself, always wrenched himself, bleeding and desperate, out of the hands of death. Steve remembers reading Sherman Alexie’s “Survivorman” and immediately thinking of Tony crossing twenty five miles of desert and carrying a newly born superhero inside of him, the chest plate simultaneously weighing and buoying his heart. Every time, the final lines of that poem echo inside of him: “Do you think you could be that good and strong? /
In the following weeks, Tony doesn’t make much progress on Steve’s killer. Eventually, what always happens to him happens again: he begins to lose focus. Steve thinks maybe someone else would be upset that Tony doesn’t keep on his monomaniac quest for vengeance, but a dead Steve is still a Steve that worries for Tony. He’s just glad that Tony stops driving himself into the ground.
Tony sucks in a sharp breath, because he knows immediately that was way, way too far. It was too far, and Steve looks like Tony’s cut him open straight down the middle. Horrifyingly, he looks like he might cry, and Tony reaches out a shaking hand, holding it up in a gesture of peace. Steve’s eyes are wide and so, so blue, and Tony wants to hold him, but he can’t. He can’t trust himself right now.
“You just want to work on a vintage fire truck,” Joyce Kiely tells him, because SI employees are many things, but generally, easily fooled isn’t one of them. She’s a fierce blond who works in Legal, and Tony is maybe a little in love with her.
Tony lets out a slow groan, rubbing a hand over his eyes. JARVIS tones down the sound of traffic now that he’s awake, and he lies there in the silence for a few blissful seconds. He’s been dreading this meeting all week.
to know his dynamic,” he says out loud. He tests the idea out, poking at the edges of it in his mind. “Because it’s irrelevant.”
“You have to ask?” Bucky says. There’s the sound of movement on the other end. Steve imagines him grabbing a go bag, packing up his various weapons. “You could’ve sent me coordinates with no context and I’d still have shown up. You know that, right?”
“Should’ve called Rhodes,” Natasha intoned. Steve didn’t tell her that he had wanted to be the one to rescue Tony this time. He knew it was petty, but also this was Natasha. She probably knew exactly why he’d made this choice, and was rubbing his nose in it.
It sounds like a dismissal, and Steve wets his chapped lips, tries again. “Pepper, I’m really sorry. I know that you’ve been taking care of Tony for longer than I have, and I violated the trust you have in me to watch his back, and keep him safe. That’s my job, and I messed up. Tony needs someone to look out for him, and I blew it.” He lets out a rough breath, running a hand over the back of his skull. “I’m just-…I want to make amends, here, but I don’t know what you’re looking for.”
“Don’t,” he says, and Tony stops. “Just…” He closes his eyes, pressing his forehead to Tony’s. “Okay. Go.”
A small smile quirks his lips. It’s a nasty one, the one that promises bloodshed. It’s a smile Steve’s seen many a time, and it instantly relaxes him. Whatever is happening here, it was planned. Tony planned for this. He feels immediately safer.
“Don’t be sorry, Cap.” Tony rolls his shoulders, as though shaking off the conversation, then ducks out from under the armour. “Thanks for the help.”
“I didn’t say anything-” Steve protests, heart leaping into his chest, but Tony waves a lazy hand. It stops him cold.
Tony’s eyes dropped to half-mast, a shiver trickling from Steve’s neck down over his shoulders as Tony stalked towards the bed with slow, predatory grace. The smile that dawned on his face was languid, confident. Steve couldn’t help it any more than he could stop his heart from beating: he tipped his head back, exposed his bondmark, and submitted himself to his alpha.
‘Hard at Work 6/28/12’ is written at the bottom centre of the drawing. Steve’s initials are tucked into the corner.
That night, there’s a restlessness to Tony’s motions that makes Steve anxious. He goes about his nightly ablutions quickly, nervously. There’s a shakiness to him that cannot be encapsulated by the slow, lazy night of cavorting and quiet, soul-baring sweetness he’d shared with Carol.
“HAL, you turncoat,” Tony growls, shaking his toast at the nearest security camera. Bruce is still staring, and Tony drains his coffee mug for something to do. “I thought you weren’t that kind of doctor.”
“Always,” he says, and Tony bites him in recompense. Kinky fucking bastard that he is, Steve only hums in pleasure. “You came for
“No, I just- Pepper, she said that Tony had- uh. That there had been, um. Tall blondes. But, while they were together. I don’t-…”
“Agent Barton demanded you stop eating his cereal this morning whilst you ate the last bowl’s worth of Captain Crunch in front of him. Slowly. While smiling and humming Steel Panther’s “The Burden of being Wonderful.” I think we can safely say that the spell is restricted to your interactions with Captain Rogers and no one else.”
“Stay,” Steve tells him. “I’ll get us some food, and then we’ll clean up a bit. God forbid Stephen shows up and the bathroom looks like this.”
They found Thor, predictably, by the refreshments table. Waiters moved through the room with platters, but here there were all sorts of plates full of things that Steve couldn’t identify. He went for what was clearly fish and cheese on a cracker, popping the whole thing in his mouth and watching Thor charm a whole group of SI employees with effortless charm.
In answer, Rogers reached for the buttons of Tony’s shirt, making quick work of them. He pulled Tony’s tails from his britches, then slid his hands reverentially over Tony’s stomach, up his chest, thumbs lingering over the scars there. The kiss he pressed to Tony’s chest was sweet, gentler than Tony had expected, and the shock of it forced a small sound from his mouth.
Natasha considered him, then rose, slowly. She approached him as though she’d approach a wild animal, and Steve still flinched when she put a hand on his arm. Here was an unbonded alpha, touching him while he was in the throes of bond-sickness. If she wasn’t so firmly entwined in his pack, he might have lashed out, but instead he just jerked underneath her hand. She pulled back with an apologetic expression.
“I think it is a rare, extraordinary miracle when one does,” she says. “I think it takes much, and most people never see circumstances that require it.” She smiles, a thready, sincere sort of thing. “When my sister first interviewed for Mr. Stark, he was a selfish, nasty, entitled man. He shoved me twice in the space of a week’s visit, like I wasn’t even there. It was like I was simply furniture to him. Do you know what that’s like, to be so invisible to a man that he doesn’t even see you? That he can knock you down, and not even spare you a glance?”
“I…” Rogers cleared his throat, coming in and closing the door behind him. “I thought I’d see how you were.”
What had happened was this: Tony and Rogers had apparently been volunteering at a youth centre, teaching self-defence classes. When he’d asked why they had free time to volunteer post-apocalypse, Rhodey had just given him a look and said that it had been a year, and if they didn’t find things to keep them sane, there was no way they’d be able to fix what had been broken before. He’d said it with the strangest look on his face, as though there was some irony to what he was saying. Tony, of course, had no idea what he was talking about, because he
Tony’s never claimed to be mature, so he’s unashamed to wake up the next morning in a suite at the Mandarin Oriental, nursing the mother of all hangovers. Evidence from last night’s bender is strewn about the room. Bottles of Salon blanc de blanc and Hibiki litter the tabletops, and the lovely ladies he’d brought back to the suite are still in bed with him, one curled up under his arm and the other with her head resting against his hip. He’s sticky everywhere, from the alcohol or something else he doesn’t know, and the cloying lavender and honeysuckle scents of their omega slick are almost offensively bracing. His head feels like he took Thor’s hammer to the helmet.
Steve grimaces. He squats, putting himself a little lower than Tony so he can look up into his face. He rests his palms over the fat base of two tentacles, then seems to get distracted, running his hands up and down the slick surface. His thumb slips around to gently ghost over one sucker, then proves bolder, pressing against it until it clings to the wide pad of his thumb. Steve exhales, soft and surprised. Interest quirks one dark blonde eyebrow down into a curious furrow.
“No,” Bruce says, shaking his head. “You’re right. But we’ve seen him take out Widow, Falcon, and Cap. We need a way to take him down quickly and safely. Or, as safe as we can.”
“You’re bait,” she says, in that flat, toneless way of hers. Wilson looks at her, eyebrows furrowed. “I need an opening to take down Hasegawa and Barnes. Your metal wings will be a shiny target for The Melter, but you’ll have to be annoying enough to keep his attention off of Tony.”
“Go on,” Tony says, making little shooing motions with his fingers. Steve looks as though he’s been cleaved in two, still in half a costume. His feet are bare. Tony didn’t notice that before. He remembers this morning, suddenly feeling so far removed that it’s numbed him, like another life or a dream.
“I know it is,” he says, frustrated, “but she cares about the environment. She donates to charity. Clearly she cares about the greater good. Right?”
“You can’t keep me safe forever, Tony,” Bruce says. His voice is gentle, even as it strikes Tony to his core. “You’re just one man.”
“Did I interrupt something?” she asks. Tony doesn’t need to turn around to see Steve’s telling flush; the delighted glitter of Natasha’s eyes betrays him. “Take a seat at my table, boys.”
“Alright,” he says. Suddenly, he feels quite differently about his plans for the day. “Well. It’s been months since I did anything remotely physical and I’m probably rusty. Who’s up first? Best chance to beat me.”
“Exactly!” A second shot arcs out of the elevator doors, melting the last of them, and Tony flies up a little further to stay out of blast radius. “Steve-”
Strange smiles thinly at him. “And will that assuage your guilt for your part in their War?” he asks.
“How did they know where he’d be?” Steve asked, tilting his head as JARVIS followed the footage back, tracking the SUVs through Cambridge. They’d been careful not to ever show their faces, caps pulled low over their eyes as they drove, disappearing into the back to put on masks and then reappearing fully-covered. There wasn’t that much to go on, and Steve had the creeping thought that maybe he was being distracted, kept out of the way while the team did the real work. This was the first time Tony had been kidnapped since they’d been bonded, he realised. Was that what this was?
“If you challenge Tony as alpha and win, you may end up as pack leader,” he warned, but Natasha just shook her head.
“How’s it feel?” Sam asks him, quiet. He leans a little into Steve, shoulders touching. “Overwhelmed?”
“Yeah, yeah,” Tony says. His expression is wry; dark circles linger under his eyes, lips pressed into a thin line of exhaustion. He places a gentle hand on Steve’s chest, pushing them apart. “I’m sure you’ve got a lot you want to say to me right now. Save it for when we can actually talk face to face, okay?”
“Marry me,” he whispered against Tony’s knuckles. “Please. I’ve been thinking about it since you asked about the party, in October, and-”
Loki’s laugh is rasping and low, his head tilted downwards. “What a question.” He flashes a grin, green eyes bright. “What is it you want, Tony Stark?”
Steve makes some sort of muffled sound as he stalks out, ignoring Clint’s wolfwhistle. “You’re right, Stark, not bad!” he calls gleefully. Tony valiantly does not offer a rebuttal. If he puts a little saunter in his step, well, he’s a narcissist, isn’t he? He tries not to think about what he’s doing with his life, Bruce and Pepper’s advice, his sanity.
“You are the best thing about the future,” Steve blurts out, because that’s what he’d meant. That’s what he was trying to say, what he’s wanted to tell Tony for so long. “Tony, you- I couldn’t have made it this far, without you. I was so far off the deep end I didn’t realise I was in the damn water, and you found me. You pulled me out. You saved all of us.”
Pepper glances over at him, her mouth a droll slant across her face. “I don’t have to trust you for Tony to want you. Tony’s slept with plenty a tall blonde in our years of working and living and being together. So if Tony wants you, you just have to decide if you understand what it means to be with Tony.”
“Ms. Potts is, in some ways, a typical organic intelligence, and thus comprehends the full benefits of a romantic relationship.” Steve raises his eyebrows at that. “I admit I have considered the matter before, at Sir’s behest, and found my parameters wanting.”
“Stephen said he was looking into it, but.” Steve peeks, just in time to catch Tony’s helpless shrug. He’s got a towel wrapped around his waist, the other ruffling through his hair. Water slithers down the long tendons of his neck, over his sternum and the slightly paler patch of skin there where Tony’s body has been through trauma after trauma. He doesn’t quite have scars, just a slight variance of colour: a small, paler sunburst at the centre of his chest. Steve’s not even sure most people would notice it, but Steve’s noticed. The shape, now that he’s looking at it, is strangely beautiful. Sun-like, almost.
A soft, pained noise looses from Rogers’ mouth, but Tony isn’t looking at him. He’s watching Bruce’s face as it sets into a stiff, determined kind of expression.
“Steve,” Tony parrots evenly. He taps his foot, then shuffles a little to the side. Steve stares at him. The elevator dings. “Well, this was fun, let’s never do this again, c’ya-”
Steve considered that, doing a mental inventory. The muscle pain he’d felt from the bond sickness had completely dissipated, replaced by the delicious ache of a few days’ worth of lovemaking. He felt sore in the best possible way, and he closed his eyes and took a deep breath, savouring the smell of his and Tony’s bonded pheromones surrounding him.
“Cap was the best fighter of us all. He didn’t die because you tied your shoe, Tony. Whatever it is, I’m sure we’ll figure it out. But you can’t do this to yourself.”
Steve stares at Tony with wide eyes, silent even as Tony removes his hand from his mouth. “Is that…you’ve been just…doing all of this? By yourself?” But even as he says it, he knows it’s a stupid question. Because of course Tony has. Of course he’s been shouldering all of this by himself, of course-
“That’s not enough reason for someone to die, in Tony’s book,” Steve explains. Three pairs of eyes turn to look at him. “He’d have been a lot less upset if Hasegawa had threatened Pepper, and then he’d killed him himself. Isn’t that right?”
Steve sets him on the chair that Tony keeps in the bathroom, then goes about fiddling with the taps. He’d made a bit of fun when he’d seen it the first time—“What do you need an armchair in the bathroom for, Tony?”—but Tony was certainly grateful for it now. The tiles are blood-curdlingly cold against his sensitive skin.
“Fucking low blow,” he says, but Steve just waits. He knows it’s a scarred-over wound. Still painful, sure. He’ll never quite be over losing his whole world, his loved ones, but by now he can joke about it.
“Two minutes out,” Bruce said, sounding pretty frustrated himself. “SHIELD has put up a perimeter. They’re doing a sweep now.”
. He can feel Loki rest his forehead on Tony’s knee for a few desperate, panting moments while they both try to get their breath back. Then, Loki climbs back into his lap and pushes his tongue into Tony’s mouth, taking the kiss from him with a claiming force that leaves Tony weak to do anything but let him take what he wants. He tastes like Tony, salt and bitterness, but underneath he’s still cool pine and winter, and Tony grips his hips kind of helplessly and lets Loki do as he likes. Loki presses messy kisses to his jaw and his cheekbones, his eyelids and his brow. Slowly, he settles, until the kisses feel less desperate and more soothing, and Tony wraps his arms around Loki’s back and pulls him in to rest his head in the curve of Tony’s neck.
“I love all of you,” Steve says, and Tony swallows. “I’m sorry if I ever made you feel like that wasn’t the case.”
are you avoiding Steve?” Pepper asks, mostly from between her teeth. The smile that she offers the SI employees they pass is practically feral.
“I know that,” he says, gesturing at her with his spoon. “Ross was already as safe an ally as a rabid dog. Now that he’s got fresh ammo to lob at us, well, time for shit to hit the fan.”
“I’m still here,” he says, and Steve turns his head, covering Tony’s hand with his own and pressing a fervent kiss to the palm there. “I’m right here with you.”
Tony opens his mouth. Closes it. “I’m hot, I’m a genius, I’m a billionaire. I have everything I could ever want.”
“You think?” he asks, but really, he’s giddy. For that one brief moment, he touched Tony. Tony felt him, he was sure of it. Tony felt his touch.
Tony tilts his head up, leans in for another soft kiss. He presses his forehead to Steve’s, brushes their noses together. “I’m really trying.”
So Steve pulled back, moaning low and deep as he did, and swirled his tongue under the head of Tony’s cock in the way that always made him keen. Tony’s fingers pushed into his hair, grabbing hold as his cock began to pulse on Steve’s tongue, and he groaned in soft appreciation as Tony came in his mouth, swallowing him down. He reached a hand down into his sweats, wrapping one hand around his own dripping cock to give it a few strokes as Tony shook apart underneath him, thighs trembling from the effort as he gasped. When Steve glanced back up at him, still suckling gently at his cock, his eyes were wild, mouth red and shining and open. He looked decadent, and Steve just wanted to devour him.
“Fuck, I can’t do this,” Tony says dully. His voice is mostly breath. “This wasn’t even what I wanted to talk to you about.”
“It’s okay,” Tony tells him, but Steve isn’t listening. He’s packing their dishes back onto the tray, tension tight in his shoulders. “Steve, it’s okay.”
Franklin frowns. A determined expression that is purely Sue Storm appears on his face. He takes a few steps forward, until they’re eye to eye, and reaches one little hand out.
“Then that’s our next step,” Steve says, nodding. “Now, it’s bedtime. You look like a wreck, Stark.”
Steve looked down at his hands. “So when we argued, and I let my anger flood the room, that was…offensive.”
“I did not intend to overstep,” Loki says, slowly. He sounds wary, but Tony ignores this in favour of a quick scrub down, running the soap over his body with efficiency. He’d wanted a shower to calm himself down, to centre himself before heading out to battle again. Clearly the universe had no intention of letting that happen.
Bruce, sounding exasperated and quietly furious. Steve tenses, but knows better than to question his teammate’s control.
Romanov had noticed, but he never expected to hide anything from her. She’d told him he could have a permanent position on the STRIKE team if he wanted it, but of course he’d ignored her invitation. There’s no way Tony would move to D.C.. Maybe, if he could live in the tower and only go in for special ops, when they really need him…
“Mm,” she hums, thin lips stretching into a smile. Her long fingers flex, testing, pale skin a sharp contrast to the dark wood. “People think that he’s some sort of wild chaotic force that I keep on a leash. It’s how the media paints him, but mostly I think that’s how the world wishes things to be. That’s what you wish, isn’t that right, Captain?”
There’s a long silence, wherein Tony watches Natasha watching Steve. Her face doesn’t tell him anything, and Tony doesn’t want to turn around. He doesn’t want to look at Steve right now, and he wants to watch Natasha’s face. Of all of them besides Clint, he’s the best at reading her. It’ll be his decision, whether or not to let her out. He knows it, and Steve knows it, too.
“Not as such,” Thor says. He looks as though he does not know whether to laugh or cry. “My father had been…weak. He is quite old for an Æsir. I have spoken to you of the Odinsleep before, how he needed rest more often, and for longer. How my mother had feared he would not wake, before she passed, how part of Loki’s protest to my appointment as heir was that our father was not using his best judgement. Perhaps he was right, in that regard. I would make a foolish king.” He laughs, somewhat bitterly. “Loki set himself to prove it, first by tricks and then by warfare. Except it seems he has done a better job of it this time.
Steve shook his head to clear his thoughts, following Natasha through the door that led to Clint’s quarters. Clint’s sitting room was kind of messy, clothes and a few empty beer cans lying around. The TV was on low, subtitles flickering at the bottom, and Natasha shook her head at the sight and walked over to turn it off. Up ahead, Clint padded out and leaned against his bedroom door, one hand scratching idly at his jaw as he yawned at them. He took one look at Steve and shook his head.
“Stop- stop figuring things out about me,” he says. He almost means it. “This is terrible. I’ve made a mistake.”
Bucky snorts at him. “Oh, don’t be a girl. You’ll heal in a minute. Asshole.” He leans back onto Steve’s cot, kicking his booted feet up onto the end rail. A wry smile warps the corners of his mouth. “If you’ve got it, grab it. Don’t be stupid.”
Ten minutes more and he hums a few old folk songs. An old drinking song. A trench song. Idly, he wishes Tony had told Maria to set him up with some Midnight Racer instead.
“You do know about the whole…cage match, lying to me about my parents’ murder, leaving me for dead in Siberia, sending me a bullshit non-apology letter thing, right?” Tony prods, and Shuri nods.
“I’m afraid I can’t help you,’ JARVIS says primly. Steve lets out a breath, jaw tightening. “Miss Potts would have a word with you, when you have a chance.”
The next time Steve wakes, it’s to screaming chaos. Everything is bright, and loud, a woman’s sobbing shrieks echoing through his skull. Pain and grief sweep through him like a sandstorm, razing every inch of his mind.
“I should stop messing up,” Steve mutters, and Tony snorts. He wipes his hands on a paper towel as he walks back towards the workbench.
Some notes, for those who are curious: I imagine that Steve would be an ardent supporter of omega rights activism and incredibly interested in historical accounts of omegas rebelling against traditional societal ideals of what a “good omega” should be. Thus, everything I have listed here comes from real-life history of female combatants. If anyone has any further interest in these topics, please hit me up! I’m happy to chat about them and provide plenty more. (And before anyone asks: being interested in fulfilling traditional gender roles is not at all in conflict with feminist principles imo. Steve is a complex character, here; on the one hand, as Captain America, he flies in the face of everything an omega traditionally is supposed to be. But it also makes sense to me that, as someone who was probably never wanted or thought of as desirable when he was pre-serum, he’d want to get that experience in his personal life.)
“Perhaps I thought that finding someone you might identify with would make you more likely to seek help,” JARVIS snipes, which, wow.
“You’re always impertinent,” Steve said, and then he was standing, scooping Tony into his arms and spinning him in a circle to raucous applause, pressing kisses all over his face as he squirmed in Steve’s grip. “Well?”
“It’s nice, that’s all,” she said, and Steve could feel himself blushing. “The way you two love each other. It makes the tower really feel like home. I’d never had a home before.”
“Loud and clear,” Bruce said cheerfully. “I expect we’ll be seeing a lot of Miss Williams in the future.”
“Before I give you any information, you have to promise me you’ll shut this thing down,” Tony says, meeting Coulson’s eyes evenly.
Unfortunately, the curse had definitely counted Steve’s comment about Tony finding him when he was ready as a command, which was why Steve was here, lifting huge plates of plexiglass with his ridiculous biceps and generally being attractive and gregarious and puppyish all over the damn place. Steve had been delighted to hear about the project, being an Irish-American himself of course, and had come to feed Tony at the height of his engineering craze. Within two hours, the team had nominated him as the Grand Marshal of the SI Saint Patrick’s Day Parade Float, complete with a sash they’d made from swathes of plastic they’d salvaged from the plexi packaging and a terrible cardboard crown.
“Shut up!” He glances around, peeking at the news cameras very obviously trained on Stephen. They can’t see Tony from where they are, but that doesn’t really matter. “We’re under the eye of the fourth estate right now, remember?”
“The thing is,” Steve says, rubbing a hand over his mouth, “uh. Neither of us think I should be leading the team. Right now. Or, until. Um.” He shrugs, blue eyes trailing to his plate. Then Steve puts a piece of apple in his mouth and begins to chew, like the absolute asshole that he is. His eyes flick to the rest of the table.
Eventually, Tony had learned his triggers. Naps were one, surprisingly; Tony could go for days without sleeping and then crash, but interrupting a REM cycle was a surefire way to trigger a migraine. Acute pain was another, as well as excessive sleep. But every once in a while, they snuck up on him, sure and inevitable as an eclipse blotting out the sun. They had never been as bad as his mother’s: just pain, hyperacusis, photophobia, and occasionally nausea. But just like his mother, his sometimes lasted for days, and he was ever eager to avoid them when possible.
Tony nods sympathetically, then lets out a quiet noise of triumph. He's briefly distracted by a microhinge. "Howard was always gone, too," Tony says, frowning at the delicate piece of machinery that is absolutely refusing to cooperate with him. "Missed a lot of birthdays. Ugh, come on, you're disappointing. You had
“What do you want to know?” Steve asked, but he was stalling for time. He knew exactly what Thor was looking for.
“Can you handle this without me?” Tony asks the team, catching Beth’s eye specifically. “I’ve got some Avengers business to take care of.”
“I can promise you,” Senator Collins says, suddenly, “if you went up to Doctor Charles Xavier’s haven and spoke to those children, they would tell you; their neighbours always know exactly what they are.” She stares at Cochran until he looks away, and Tony marks a point in her column. She very pointedly closes the StarkPad without looking at it and hands it back to him. “Forcing innocent Americans to register their biological status is absurd and against all American values. History has already proven this. But we can certainly talk sanctions. The Avengers cannot continue to operate without oversight.”
he thinks viciously, then stops in case Loki can hear him. Loki just drags himself up with a grin, wiping the blood from his mouth. Tough bastard.
“Tony, please,” Steve says, but Tony can’t hear him. He’s too busy pressing the base of his palms into his eyes, his shoulders still trembling so violently, and Steve can’t just sit here and watch this. He puts his hands over Tony’s shoulders, willing him to calm down. He presses his forehead to Tony’s, but he can’t even feel the barest hint of warmth.
Steve nodded. He blinked a few times, wiping his eyes with the back of his wrist. “Thank you, JARVIS.”
Thor’s laughter is a familiar rumble as he leans over the back of the couch, placing a gentle hand on Tony’s shoulder. “I shall fetch the dustpan,” he says, and then disappears.
The phone tilts wildly, then goes dark. It’s not true black, and there’s no notification that pops up, so Tony suspects that Steve has just tossed his phone face-down onto his bedspread.
“I’m kinda surprised Cap didn’t try to fish Barnes out of NIA custody,” Rhodey muses. “I know you’ve been too busy to concentrate on Cap’s old army buddy, but damn. That’s kinda cold.”
“Got the idea he wasn’t very good to you,” Steve says carefully. “Not that I’m altogether surprised to hear it. Not everyone should be a father.” He sucks in a breath, realising what he sounds like. “Not that I mean he was a bad man, he was a friend, I just mean-”
“Steve believed in the good in people, truly and sincerely, and that belief was a beacon,” Tony says, and Steve could laugh because Tony
“Hey, okay,” Tony said, pulling away. He took Steve’s head in his hands, forced his face up to meet Tony’s eyes. “I push you every fucking day, Steve. Is that what you’re worried about? You know better than anyone that nobody makes me do anything I don’t wanna do.” He pressed his forehead to Steve’s, breathing deeply in a way that made Steve echo him. He concentrated on Tony’s breath, the feel of rough fingers on his cheekbones and jaw.
Tony looses an ambivalent noise, then takes another sip sip of hot chocolate. “I wanted you to know what’s going on because you’re the most likely to do it if I need to be taken out, or know when to knock me around the head if Loki tries something. I know he’s watching me, and right now we don’t have any way to counteract that. He could be listening in right now.” He grimaces. “I underestimated the strength of my relationships. In my defence, I’m not used to being a real boy with real friends. My bad, I know.”
“Hell yeah,” Tony says gratefully, snagging the brownie tin. Clint hops over the back of the couch to get settled. “How long?”
“Wow,” Tony says, genuinely impressed. “You really went for it, huh. A+ phrasing. Strong delivery. Good job.”
Tony furrows his brow, but does as he’s told. He spans Steve’s trim waist with his calloused workman’s hands, running his fingertips along the peaks and valleys of muscle.
He hadn’t realised his shoulders had stiffened, but he could feel them relax as soon as Tony’s hands slid over them, one slipping up over his jaw to tilt his head to the side. Before he could react, Tony’s mouth was there, hot behind the curve of his ear. His teeth scraped slow over the side of Steve’s neck, nowhere near his gland, but closer than anyone had ever gotten. It was a statement, both of intent and acceptance, and Steve melted back into him with a gasp, body going near-limp as he braced his hands against the counter.
“If you send me and Barton out, no holds barred, I promise we can find him within a few days. A week at the latest.” She put a gentle hand over his wrist, measuring his pulse or trying for reassurance, he didn’t know. “There’s a fifteen year old girl out there, Steve, and she’s been shot.” Emotional manipulation. Transparent, but in a way, it was a kindness; here is an excuse for you, to help you sleep at night.
“Shh, I’ve got you,” Tony crooned, quiet and kind. He tucked his face into Steve’s neck, mouthing gently at his mark. “I wanted to make this last, but I don’t think I can wait any longer.” His hands trembled where they skated over Steve’s calves, his thighs. “I can’t- I can’t wait any more.”
They drive in silence for a while as Pepper processes this. Tony doesn’t mind. If he is grateful for anything in his life, it is the fact that his relationship with Pepper has maintained this comfort, that he can sit with her without the stifling instinct to babble. He enjoys driving. When he looks over after a mile or so, she has a thoughtful expression on her face.
“How long?” Tony rasped, and the expression in his eyes hurt so much that Steve stumbled against the glass, bracing a hand against it to steady himself. “How long have you known?”
Tony’s voice breaks, and Steve rubs a hand over his face. He hates this. He doesn’t know what to do, but what he’s doing isn’t working. Tony’s in too deep to even notice that Steve’s right here. He’s too blinded by his own grief.
Steve has always loved this. That first moment after a fight, where the adrenalin is still singing in the veins, and triumph sits on the tongue like hard candy. A tremulous smile takes over his face.
“Worried, baby?” Tony says, turning around to face Loki as he walks backwards towards the gaping hole in the ground.
“The third floor of a nearby building was housing a delegation of humanitarian workers from Wakanda. There was an explosion, involving Moonstone and a doombot. I’m not clear on the details, and all the footage released online so far has been too shaky to clarify things. The Hulk was the only one on the scene.”
It was first great betrayal of Tony’s life; not because no one had ever betrayed him before, because of course they had. Tony had learned from a young age who to trust and who was just looking for money and five minutes in the spotlight. But after a while, the shine wears off. Inevitably, Tony does something wrong. He forgets a date, or calls too late, or buys too extravagant of a gift. He wants to spend every free minute with his partner, which is overwhelming, but he doesn’t have much free time, which is neglectful. If anything, Tony shouldn’t be surprised that his so-called “soulmate” can’t stand to be around him. People don’t like the broken, greedy creature they find under the sheen of fame and wealth that Tony wields as both sword and shield to get him through the grating gauntlet of high society life, but it’s all Tony knows how to be. It’s all he can do. Steve was horribly, bone-chillingly right when he said it on the helicarrier. This damaged creature is all that’s left. It’s all he is. He doesn’t have anything else to give.
almost two whole weeks to figure out that he’s unable to disobey a direct order from Steve, which just- what the hell is that? What happened to the days when he flew off the handle, unable to play well with others, a notorious wild card?
“You harmed him!” Tony says, pointing. “J, tell me we got data on that. How are you talking? You don’t have the right kind of mouth-”
“And what of it?” Strange demands, spreading his hands. “If he is a ghost, then he is still dead. What could you possibly seek to accomplish? Do you wish to reanimate him? I’ll have no part in it-”
“Good,” he says, and Tony barks out a soft laugh. “That…I know that’s not the right answer. But that’s how I feel.”
“Sir has smaller hands, and somewhat slim fingers compared to the average European-American man. His ring size is recorded as an 8.5, although if I may, 8.75 would probably fit better. A 9 falls off, so he generally goes smaller when in doubt.” Steve nodded. “Should I…bring up a list of Sir’s preferred jewellers?”
“Soon,” Tony murmurs, as though he can hear him. He nudges Steve’s legs open, wheels his chair between them. He presses his cheek to Steve’s chest and wraps his arms around his waist.
“I’m an asshole,” he says. He tips his head to the side, heavy-eyed, to look at Steve’s hologram. His jaw is tight, and he’s not looking at the camera. “Cap.”
“It started as a way to try to…I don’t fucking know,” Tony breathes. He rubs a hand over his face, suddenly, looking exhausted. “Fuck.”
“Gelato,” Steve agreed, smiling. Tony grinned at him, handsome and his, and Steve leaned in to taste the chocolate lingering at the corners of his mate’s mouth. “Mm. Tastes better on you.”
Steve considered the proposal. The idea of seeing Tony and not being able to touch him hurt, more than he’d thought was possible from psychosomatic pain. It felt like his chest was caving in. But the idea of waiting to see Tony until his hormones had stabilised was unthinkable. Even feeling around the edges of the idea made him so dizzy his vision began to blur, and he had to pause and take a deep breath lest he throw up the little bit of rice and chicken he’d managed to keep down.
Loki narrows his eyes, head tilting as he examines him. "I believe you," he says solemnly. Tony bares his teeth. "That is not my aim, no."
“She’s gonna destroy those machines regardless. May as well pull him out.” He tips his head to the side, thinking. “But I don’t know what that magic shit around him is doing.”
“More like Dinch. Oof, that’s bad, Linner?” Tony wrinkles his nose. “Why is there no good portmanteau for this meal?”
“Oh,” Tony says. He glances over towards where Steve had just been sitting. A hollow pit opens in his stomach, and from it, something rouses and crawls to the surface: something poisonous, and sour, with rows and rows of spiny teeth. “I guess I can see how that could be…overwhelming. First time properly smelling me or whatever.”
He looked a lot less feral than he had at the start. He was glowing, too, less deathly pale. Tony was sitting cross-legged at Steve’s hip, leaning in to feed him, still completely naked. Looking at Tony’s ribs made Steve’s chest hurt; he wondered if he’d been eating enough.
“Hit me.” He frowns, pointing a fork at a very confused looking Thor. “Not you, Pikachu. You’re not allowed to hit me.”
“You’re only gonna get to use that card a few more times,” Steve tells him, and Tony swallows down a completely inappropriate laugh. “Two, maybe three. Pick ‘em wisely, genius.”
A breathless gust of laughter breaks free of Tony’s chest. He wipes a tired hand over his face. “Fuck. Sorry, Happy.”
He kind of wants to take a shower again, but not because he needs one; mostly for the feeling of isolation, and the way the heat running over his skin puts him right to sleep. Instead he heads to the wet bar and pours himself three fingers of vintage single malt, two jet black whiskey stones, looks out over the city with an ache in his chest.
The woman looks discomfited, waffling between furious and hesitant. “You are allied with Loki?” she asks. “And yet I can sense remnants of mjölnir’s magic all along your parapet.”
He’d been worried, was the thing. Tony often went days without eating or sleeping, working in a haze. What medication was he taking? How regularly did he need it? What if he forgot a dose? So when he walked in the third time, early enough in the process to see Tony drawing the liquid from a small glass bottle, well. He hadn’t meant to see, but then he had, and you couldn’t close Pandora’s box, could you?
In his defence, he didn’t mean to look. He’d seen Tony taking the injections twice since that first time, and Tony seemed less jumpy about it now. Steve had practically moved into the penthouse, and they were talking about spending Steve’s next heat together. His last heat had come too early in the relationship for both of them, and instead he’d spent it in his heat room, heavily prepped with plenty of toys Tony had equipped entirely for his pleasure. It had been nice, honestly, to know that his alpha was still taking care of him, even if he wasn’t actually there in the room. Steve’s heats were entirely irregular, but Tony had mostly synced up with him after weeks of regular sex and pheromone exchange. To hear the team tell it, he’d spent most of the four days of Steve’s heat pacing aggressively around the tower on the knife’s edge of a rut, snapping aggressively at his packmates and hammering at things in his workshop. The sex was always good, had always been good, but Steve remembered the week following his heat with particular fondness. A possessive alpha wasn’t something every omega was interested in, but Steve was an old-fashioned kinda guy. He loved when Tony pampered him, manhandled him, used him for his own pleasure. He liked feeling beautiful, and coy, and owned.
Steve nods. He stands, fingers pressing once, firmly, against this desk that used to belong to Tony. Loki calls her Tony’s general, Steve knows. It seems a particularly fitting moniker now, more so than he had understood at the outset. He has been consistently outmanoeuvred.
“I’ll deal with that later,” he tells him, shrugging. Stephen frowns, leaning over the table. He folds his long-fingered hands together in front of his face, considering Tony over the roof he’s made of them. The weight of his assessing gaze makes Tony shiver a little.
Steve was more than happy to comply, crawling over the sheets just to hear Tony snarl at the sight of him. He dropped his head to his forearms and spread his thighs, and was rewarded immediately with a “Fuck, Steve,” and then-
“Hilarious,” Tony mutters, but he snags a tablet, shrugging his suit jacket off and draping it over the back of the sofa. He collapses down into it, kicking his socked feet up on the table. “Hit me. Most urgent to least urgent. Let’s see what I can get through without wanting to jump off the landing pad, J.”
“He called me Rogers,” Steve says, and Sam raises his eyebrows. “He hasn’t done that in ages without it being a joke.”
Loki hums, entirely unrepentant, and untwists his body from the comma curl he’d been held in. He arches into an exclamation point, textbook open over his chest. Long toes dig into the carpet. The fine blue linen of his shirt slips over his abdomen, revealing a dark trail of hair, sharp hipbones. His neck is one pale, bowed line of mouth-watering temptation.
It turns out that there’s a slightly smaller population of Irish-Americans in SI than Tony would have thought, but that’s alright. He’s got enough to populate a float, plus Pepper, and after a few emails they come up with a small group of folks who are interested enough to be on the central planning committee.
“Bond Stress-induced cardiomyopathy can be fatal over time, sir. I strongly recommend you speak to someone.”
Steve looks frantic. Tony can feel Steve’s pulse, the sweat beading against his skin. “Hold me down,” he whispers, barely loud enough to hear.
Still, he isn’t sure if Tony even wants to see him right now. And it was only four. Nobody ate dinner at four.
The thing was rough, stiff almost. It smelled like so many different chemicals, Steve couldn’t even begin to place them all, and over that, a heavy layer of Tony’s sweat. Steve probably should have thought it disgusting, but Tony was his alpha. He was hardwired to love the scent of him, no matter how overpowering it might be on this particular garment. It had been through welding, and soldering, and fixing up engines and repulsors alike. It had been with Tony for far longer than Steve had, and he honestly wasn’t sure if Tony had washed it in the near year they’d been bonded. He didn’t think he’d ever seen it leave the shop.
