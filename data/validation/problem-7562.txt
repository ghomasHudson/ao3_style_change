"Papa, can I feed Sammy?" He asked quietly, turning doe eyes to his father.
"Daddyyyy," Peter grumbled from his place on Tony's chest, not opening his eyes, "Do y'hafta kiss Papa in front'a me?"
Tony shook his head back and forth.
Tony whined again, knowing that his face was completely flushed.
Tony nodded, smooching the top of Peter's head.
just thank me for sex?" Tony snorted, pulling out gently before settling next to Steve, "I should feel offended. But I'm not." He grinned, smooching his cheek.
"Oh my god," Tony rolled his eyes, putting Peter on the floor, "Go wash up, baby bear. Papa bear and I will get breakfast started, okay?"
The blond sputtered on his tea slightly, clearing his throat before continuing.
"Woah, woah, kid. Gotta get you gowned up and sanitized first," Tony pointed out, "Can't just go running in, sweetie."
He smooched at Steve's neck, breathing him in.
He laid down beside Steve anyway, leaning up on his elbow.
"Daddy might have took you back, then." He whispered, glancing back at Tony.
"I'll playfully tease you, but not be mean." Steve assured softly. "I'd be a bully otherwise. And I hate bullies..."
He put his hands over Peter's ears.
"You're a sap," Tony mumbled, relaxing against Steve, "My sap. A sap that needs to start making arrangements with Bucky for our trip so I can have someone go ready the cabin for us."
"Well, this place is still on the market, Mr. Stark," Babs laughed, voice tinny, "Do you think you've finally made a decision after all these years?"
"Awe, baby, did you hurt yourself?" He cooed, swooping Sammy up into his arms, "Lemme see."
"What on earth were you doing?" Steve said, setting Peter down to rush to help Tony up.
"It was a fun movie. And you could totally pull off that outfit." Steve giggled again, tugging Tony down for a deep kiss, slow and sweet.
He knelt by the bed, watching the boys carefully with a small smile. Tony went over and put his hands in Steve's hair, bending over to smooch the top of his head.
"My little man's growing up," Tony teased softly, ruffling the boy's hair.
"Yeah baby, you're still burning," Tony sighed, "I'm gonna go get you some tylenol."
“A little over a week ago, I was bitten by what I assumed was just some stray dog during one of my runs. Turns out, it wasn’t just some stray. It wasn’t something the serum was about to fight back either.” He explained solemnly. “I didn’t want to believe it at first, but as of last night I sort of have to.”
"What can I say? You're rubbing off on me. In more ways in one." He smirked.
"Everyone needs to be silly, sometimes. Makes you feel better if you been too stressed, and as you get older you will encounter a
he thought.
"We're here for you, kid, whether you like it or not. We've been through too much together," Clint replied, a knowing smile on his lips.
Steve gave a slight pout, but then grinned anyway. "All right, I promise to be a good boy today. I'll be on my best behavior. Scout's honor."
to warn Steve about, crashing around his shoulders in suffocating tendrils, completely taking him under.
Tony gasped, face flushing more as he rolled his hips back, happily making noises into his pillow. "Feels good," he mumbled, "Y'real big, Stevie, fillin' me up--"
street, to which Tony promptly took him on a spending spree that seemed to cost his whole month’s wages. Tony also asked that they try them out tonight, if he wanted to.
Tony blinked, a tiny smile on his lips. "Say, you know, my birthday's not over
"Are you two Mr. And Mr. Stark-Rogers?" She asked carefully, earning a nod from Steve. "Ms. Carter's contractions are becoming closer to each other, so she will deliver before long. Will one of you be comfortable coming in and helping as her support through the delivery?"
"Good thing. Kissing and sex would be
"Thank you, Mr. Stark," Sam gushed, "You won't regret taking this case."
Peter blinked, then grinned. "Yeah! Auntie Tasha promised to make me cookies next time I came over--"
“All I'm saying is I'm sure as hell not taking a black light in their room," Tony laughed, "Hey, I don't mind it. Clint taught me sex and gave me The Talk, it was uncomfortable as hell, but hey." He shrugged. "He's family. So basically, it’s your brother talking to your brother-in-law about our sex lives. Which isn't surprising to me."
"Really? I didn't know that," Tony mused, "I'll do my research of my own, look into it. The might tell the children that early to ward them off of inappropriate behavior until they're better equipped to deal with it."
Whimpering, Tony stretched his neck to give Steve more room, stuttered breaths on his lips. "Love you, Sir," He moaned, cock twitching, even without stimulation, "P-please, Sir--"
"Biggest
"No you haven't." He scolded lightly. "You've been acting up here and there more often, haven't you Tony?"
"Mmh," Tony murmured, leaning into Steve's touch.
"Sleepy," he mumbled, "Sore."
"Uh-huh."
"Morning." He hummed happily, carrying the tray to the bed. "Went and made you breakfast."
He smirked to himself and stretched out over Steve, comfortably resting up against his side.
"So... What are we doing?".
nice for me--
," Peter protested, lips wobbling slightly, "You's
Smiling softly, he closed the door behind them and went over to the bed, happy to put Peter in Steve's waiting arms.
"Yeah, yeah it is." Steve said with a soft smile, glancing down at a snoozing Peter and dropping his voice to a whisper. "Even more so with another one. I really can't wait, but I feel bad for making Peter think we'd be replacing him, you know?"
"That's it, Stevie. Just like that. Work with what makes you feel good. Chase that feeling, okay?" Tony encouraged, helping guide Steve until there was a consistent pace and an equally consistent amount of soft moans of pleasure leaving the blond's lips.
"You're so beautiful, Steven, so beautiful," Tony hummed, scooting down to press kisses along the blond's cock.
"Oh no you don't, Tony Jr." Steve chuckled, picking Peter up and setting him on the bed. "If you are saying goodnight, you have to be going to bed yourself. No staying up to work on things you have a break from."
He ruffled Steve's hair again, before getting up to finish his papers for Pepper.
Peter gave Tony a look, to which he shrugged.
"Bathroom sex is always there," Tony grinned, "And I'm not below a gag. I think as long as we're quiet, he won't really know or care. He's six, not sixteen."
"Keep me fed and hydrated," Tony laughed, absentmindedly pushing his glasses up his nose, "Sound good?"
Steve made a short hum, moving to wash Tony off carefully.  "Still. If they happen, I guess they'll happen, but I won't purposely hurt or bruise you."
"Steve," he whined quietly.
He gave Steve a quick kiss on his lips and cheek before going up to Peter's room, trying the handle to see it locked.
"Oh, um, okay Peter. You can go play in your room for a little bit then, okay?" Steve said, trying to keep a blush away as he watched Peter leave.
He buried his face in Steve's neck, biting and licking at his pulse.
Sammy whined, so Tony picked him back up, whispering gently to the baby while dancing him around the room. Peter looked at him and harrumphed, turning on his heel to march out of the room in a huff. Annoyed, he slammed the door to his room, hopping into his hammock to re-read one of Tony's old papers. At the slam, Sammy startled himself and started to cry, clutching his tiny hands at Tony's shirt.
"He's probably the calmest one right now," Tony muttered, head shooting up at the sound of the curtain opening.
! Ah, god..." Steve whined, hips bucking. "Please,
"'Course not." Peter said matter-of-factly. "I was jus' havin' a pwivate conbersation wif Papa."
Tony moaned softly, tangling their legs together.
, Papa, m'ah big boy!"
"Getting the list done will be good, too. We can do it now while dinner is cooking, if you'd like to?"
"Mm-hmm." Steve groaned out softly as Tony started to pump his fingers slowly. He started to moan quietly when the fingers moved a bit quicker.
"Hey handsome," Tony hummed, bumping their noses together, "Sorry for last night, I really-- I don't know what it was."
Steve nodded softly, looking to Tony. "About what specifically should we talk about?”
." He whined, rocking back onto Tony's fingers. "Please, Tony. Feels so good--".
"Mhm. Fank you Daddy," Peter replied with a giggle.
"I'm pretty sure your nurse didn't come in and clear you, mister." Steve said with a small, fond smile. "How're you feeling, sweetheart?”
"Then he can use it for when his teeth are coming in. Then that'll be that." Steve hummed, putting sauce and cheese on the dough. "Can you bring him over so he put toppings on?"
Tony helped Steve ride through it, come covering over their hands as he guided Steve through the fall. He whispered soft praises to the other, praising and kissing at Steve's temple as he fell from his first ever pleasure-high.
The blond looked back up into warm brown eyes, a smirk of his own playing on his lips.
"Yeah, yeah, I'll come over. I don't eat much, though, so make it for like one and a half people."
"Kiss me?" Tony asked hopefully, grinning dopily when his request was granted.
"Nope. I'm being a plankton, and I'm not singing," Tony rolled his eyes, making a face at Steve, "I'll remind you of that next time that we're--"
-----------------------------------------
get to plan the entire night. No exceptions." He grinned, ignoring the pink dusting his cheeks.
"We're
skinny and short. Got something against skinny and short?" Tony teased, sitting up so he could straddle Steve's lap, "I'm just teasin'. What I'm
Tony decided to work more on his project that he been working on for a good month or so. Steve wanted some time to try and decide on a sketch to turn into his final piece, so Tony hadn't seen him today. Which was fine, of course. Everyone could use a break every once in a while, and he always had Bruce to keep him company.
"You know you like it," Tony snickered, stroking his even faster, "You gonna come, babe? Make your boxers all wet, hm?" He grinned, attacking Steve's neck again.
"But you
"You're back! Oh, here I'll help you with those." He said excitedly, taking a few of the bags from Tony and carrying them up to the room. "You get everything, okay?"
"What sort of trouble was in our sector? There were no reports of merfolk in danger today."
Steve scurried around the kitchen, thinking of what to make. He settled on simple Macaroni and Cheese. It would take long enough for the boys to get a cat nap and it was a comfort food, which they could really use right now.
"Poor little guy can barely keep his eyes open." Steve cooed, scooping Peter up onto the bed and under the blankets. "You'll feel better in the morning and I'll make you a big breakfast, okay?"
"I'm bad at coloring, Steven," Tony complained, filling it in, "I was never a coloring book person as a kid."
The voice snapped Tony out of his thoughts. He whipped his head around to see a familiar face. Steve stood in the open area, looking at Tony with a small sad smile. Tony scrambled back up to his feet flustered, his mind running a mile a minute. He was so nervous, he felt like he was about to vomit. Thankfully, it was only word vomit.
"Daddy!" Peter yelled, clutching his tiny arms around Tony's neck, "Y'ome!"
"Steve, if you wanted to go somewhere in particular, you should just go there.".
"I got it! I got it!" Peter giggled, running in with the picnic blanket excitedly.
Natasha smacked Bucky's hand for taking her phone.
He kissed Steve's chest, shakily stepping out to dry off and slip into his favorite pajamas.
"Hey there, bubba. Not feeling any good?" He said softly, heading towards Peter and Tony when they came into the room. "We'll get you some rest, okay?"
He switched Peter to Steve's arms, smooching the boy's cheek again before turning to Pepper.
He sat down and ate slowly, face still burning with embarrassment. Steve chuckled, joining Tony to eat and buttering up a piece of toast.
"Otay, but y'can't tell 'im," He said seriously, wiping the tears off his cheeks, "I wanna show Daddy dat Sammy ca--"
"Oh, you're not kidding." He breathed, eyes raking lower with a pleased noise. "You are so great, you know that? Absolutely wonderful, I swear. Damn."
"Honestly, I-- God, Ma would smack me if she heard me speak ill of the dead, but I'm glad I didn't get to meet Howard. Not when he did that to you, I'm sorry." He said with gritted teeth. "Wish I could've known you back then. Wish I could've stepped in and taken you away from him. Scrawny or not, I would've fuckin' fought him for that Tony."
Steve looked back at Peggy, confused.
With a smirk, Tony easily flicked open Steve's belt and the front of his khakis, letting his fingers ghost over the curls above Steve's groin.
"I might even go again in a few minutes," he laughed breathily.
Peter nodded enthusiastically, another yawn still leaving his lips as he stretched a bit.
"This is insane." He murmured, trying not to look like a person dropped in a country he knew nothing about.
"Have you even
"Night, lil bear," Tony murmured, sniffling and wiping away a few stray tears on his own face.
"C'mon, Papa! Let’s go on da swings!" He said excitedly.
A stream of light quickly enveloped Steve, his throat burning in pain as he felt his voice leave it. His vision blurred as he felt he couldn't breathe and his body felt as if it were being torn in two.
"I'm not-- I'm still not used to being able to go to people for help," he mumbled, "Sorry."
"Of course, sir," Tony breathed, putting his arms up. He squirmed under Steve's touch, bucking up into his hand. "Sorry sir," he murmured, a smirk forming on his lips.
me with sex right now?" He asked with a chuckle.
He suppressed the shiver that ran down his back, giving Steve one last kiss before forcing himself out of bed to pull on sweatpants and a t-shirt.
"Yes."
It was the best thing he had ever laid his body on.
He sat up, kissing Steve and dragging him with him. Steve followed Tony with a limp to wherever it was they were going to.
"You're such a jealous little bear," he chuckled softly, "But you're right, Sammy's too young to be a superhero just yet. He's your damsel-in-distress, right?"
"Okay. We'll go on a date," He murmured, looking over at Steve with a soft smile, "But that means you're planning it and stuff."
He set the belt lightly across Tony's bottom before he would start swatting. "Twenty swats. One for every four times. Then we will deal with the rest in store."
"He said 'be good'. That's different." Steve murmured, mostly to himself as he trailed upstairs, going to his studio but keeping an ear out for Peter.
Steve smiled at the compliments fondly. "Just takes a good recipe and plenty of practice. Thank you." He hummed, taking Tony's hand and rubbing it back softly.
Tony flicked through the racks, Steve's size in his head as he picked out some white and black laces, nearly falling over in laughter at his third choice; he quickly hid it under the others, saving it for later.
Steve got out of bed and scooped Peter up, carrying him downstairs to the kitchen. Peter grinned as he was carried, pressing a kiss to Steve's cheek.
"Pete?" He called, opening the boy's door.
"Papa?" Peter let himself be picked up with a confused look on his face.
"Hey, it’s okay buddy," Tony soothed, kissing the top of his head, "I get scared sometimes too, nothin' to be ashamed of."
•Um, I kind of gathered that you are avoiding me, but I just wanted to let you know the art show is on the 30th from 7:00 to 9:00 at the Fine Arts building if you wanted to come. To see the project. Since you were the subject...
Steve asked himself, examining his thinner frame. He was much smaller. Far shorter, which he was sure wasn't because of his lack of a tail. Any muscle he had before was completely gone, his face looking well rested but slim.
"Hmm... I guess so." He hummed, kissing Tony's lips gently before he leaned up and off the bed. "Just be careful on the way there, okay?"
of your closet?" He asked, keeping a blank face, even at Peter's sheepish look.
Tony grinned wide.
"Yeah! Just like youse'll be Iron Man cuz youse making da suit!" Peter said excitedly, causing Sammy to squeak an excited noise in response.
break." Steve insisted. He snuggled up against the boy, kissing his forehead. "So that means Super Papa Furnace Powers activate!" He chuckled.
Steve was silent for the moment, looking carefully at his team as he thought of how best to explain the situation to them. He ran his tongue over his teeth in thought before finally speaking up.
He pressed kisses all over one side if Peter's cheek while Steve kissed the other, reveling in the boy's laughter.
"He's trying to say 'bubba', Peter. It’s sweet." He pointed out.
"I know you won't, love," Tony murmured, gently lowering Steve onto him, "I know you won't."
"Tony, Peter, dinnertime."
"Okay, it’s just a little cut, bubba." He tried to assure. "We'll clean it up, but it’s definitely gonna bruise and be sore for a while."
"So you did make it here last night, Bruce! Okay, I hope." Steve called from the kitchen, to which Bruce nodded.
They duo stood and shook hands with Rogers before gathering their things and leaving the two men alone once again.
Tony huffed in exhaustion from all the yelling. Howard glared at his son from across the desk. It was deathly silent for a long while until Howard started rummaging through some papers and getting them set up.
Of course they did," Tony replied, sucking down his milkshake, "Peter's good for them. Right?" He turned an eye to Steve once the car stopped, immediately unbuckling himself to run up to the front steps and knock on the door.
fault."
"Make out with me?" Tony asked hopefully, wincing as he sat down next to Steve.
Steve groaned quietly in pleasure as Tony moved in, staying still as they both adjusted.
"Rogers, come lay with me," Tony called.
"I know, but his relationship with you is like a father and son's." Steve pointed out, wrapping arms around Tony. "My relationship with him is like a
"Finally got him asleep for now." Steve sighed as he entered. "How are my other boys doing now?"
Steve watched as they left with slight upset in his eyes.
"Well, yeah with some things." Steve chuckled softly "But don't let him hear you say that.”
Tony cast his gaze aside, absentmindedly stroking Peter's hair.
, was printed on his chest. When he first received it, he didn't know who would bother to call him that. At 16, he was small, skinny, and lanky. Far from what he would consider handsome. Even after his body filled out the summer of his senior year, he still never considered himself as such.
Peter put his little feet out, letting Steve swap out the red one for a blue one.
"A-ah," Tony moved his hips slightly, taking the pressure off his backside, "D-don't be sorry, I needed that."
"Wait--"
Tony quietly closed the door behind him when he left, eyes slightly blank when he found Steve.
"That'd be nice. Sort of have a whole family thing." Steve grinned, changing out of his wet clothes. "I know Peter would like to see his aunts and uncles. Would you wanna have them over?"
"Y'both gross," Peter muttered, folding his arms, "M'
Tony groaned loudly before a smirk slowly spread over his face. "Desks don't require sheets," he hummed, nosing at Steve's chest.
"Oh, but I thought about it," Tony breathed, "I sure as hell dreamed of it, too."
Tony nodded, sitting up with a wince.
He hummed lightly, scooting over to put his head in Steve's lap.
"Thanks for going to all that trouble, Steve. For a first-time dish, it actually looks good." Tony assured, releasing his hug and patting Steve's shoulder warmly before taking the oven mitts off of the blond's hands. "Now how about I show you how to plate it up? Make it all look nice and fancy. Maybe add a garnish--"
"Uh huh."
"You can't forget our deal though." He reminded as he nuzzled into dark locks of hair.
"You okay?" Tony asked quietly, "You looked about ready to cry back there."
Tony blinked in surprise, but sat down, picking up the blue marker. He idly sketched out some schematics for a new phone design, occasionally flicking his eyes up to smile at Steve. Steve would smile back as he sketched up Peter's face the best he could with a marker, winking over at Tony a couple of times.
This chapter was left where it was because I have plans for how their movie night continues~
"I know, it’s just, he's always talking about Daddy. Daddy this, Daddy that." Steve explained as he stood. "Last night, he was acting
Once he felt ready, he stepped back into the bedroom, smiling shyly at Steve.
Tony rolled his eyes, fondly patting Steve's stomach.
Steve was silent for the moment, sadness starting to peek out of his eyes.
"It... It is getting late, too..." Steve murmured. "You guys can stay the night downstairs or in the guesthouse if you'd like? There are spare clothes there."
He pulled back and wiped his thumb on the sheets, happy to blink up at Steve.
"It was a start, I though." Steve chuckled, smooching Tony's nose. "Like a pre-show for the main event, y'know? And what do you mean
"You and your Irish," Tony murmured, sifting his fingers through Steve's hair, "I love you too,
"All right." Steve agreed quietly, taking his hand away. "We'll try a different approach." He whispered. The blond leaned forward, capturing Tony's lips softly and tenderly, leaving his touches along the other's chest gentle and fleeting.
"Hmm?" Tony questioned, glancing down at the blond. "More of wha--"
"S-steve, I'm--"
Steve snorted a laugh at the excuse. "Honestly have never heard that as an explanation before. But I'm not opposed to some shower sex every now and again." He grinned
--" he yelled, gasping breathily.
The blond hummed in reply, giving Tony ten more swats in succession, setting the belt down after and running soothing hands over Tony's cheeks.
Steve's eyebrows twitched up in surprise at the boy's statement.
, there's no point in giving yourself a sore throat," she murmured, sifting her fingers through his hair.
"If you cry, I'm gonna cry for sure." Steve said, shaking his head with a laugh. "Oh jeez, we're fucking saps."
"No, honey," Tony murmured gently, sifting his fingers through Peter's hair, "You won't. Promise."
Tony shrugged and let himself settle into his pit, sadly staring at his hands. He didn't reply, other than to lean over to nudge Steve's cheek, resting his head on his shoulder. Silently, he pricked tiny lines across his left wrist, shamefully relaxing into the sting.
He sniffled, laughter bubbling up from his throat.
"Oh my god, Steve, still such a little 'un," Tony teased, "Like the first time I caught you in my office--"
"Uh-uh. Gwoss," Peter stuck his tongue out, shrieking when Steve tried to grab for him anyway. "Papaaa, nooo!"
"I've been so bad lately, m'sorry Sir," Tony breathed, grinding down onto Steve's lap, "Been so naughty--"
Steve nodded, getting up from the bed and stripping down slowly to give a small show. When he was done, he crawled back up on the bed, sitting down on his legs besides Tony.
like to hear." He hummed happily, laying back. "C'mere."
"If you didn't know,
"Oooh, so Stark
. Also, Clint talks about that kind of stuff a lot, no doubt in my mind he and Bucky were swapping stories about us all night and wondering what our sex is like."
"Get used to it. I'm a bed hound," Tony laughed, letting his eyes slip shut, "I've been in bed for days before. Like, only getting up if I have to eat or somethin'."
"Since Clint yelled and startled me," Tony laughed, leaning back in his chair, "I was up, though, just lounging around." He shifted in the chair, yawning at Steve. "I don't ache as much."
"Don't be ridiculous. I don't paint."
Peter only cried harder and stuck his tongue out at Steve, shoving himself to his feet to toddle over to his bed, struggling to climb up onto it. Tony looked helplessly over to Steve. Steve looked back with a sad look to his face. He walked over to the bed and helped Peter up.
"Okay, bambi, thank you for telling me," He murmured, "I'm gonna go talk to Papa, okay? Go ahead and wash up for dinner. I love you."
"You wanna stop by the bakery before we head home?" Steve asked with a smile.
Steve kept quiet, still proud of their boy as he let him work. He was going to be capable of so many great things as he grew up.
"You can do it to me though, officer. Feel free to cuff me anytime," Tony purred, "Lock me up,
He pulled back and bit his lip, guilt etched into his features.
"When I'm under, I whine
"O-oh, god--"
a blowjob," he teased, "I can barely keep my hands off you at home, why think the first moment we're alone I'd only want a
"Better. A bit heavy, but better," Tony snuffled, eagerly slurping down the soup, "I guess I freaked out pretty bad last night. Sorry. My anxiety gets the better of me sometimes. I tried to warn you.”
"Awe," Peter pouted, putting his chin on Wade's fluffy head, "S'gonna be a while."
He grinned, a devious smile lighting up his face.
"Neither of us are. I'm running schematics in my head to try and not worry," Tony mused, squeezing Steve's hand, "If it gets too much, we can call, or always go back."
"But I'm old 'nough!" Tony kept protesting, a tiny scowl on his face, "I was ready, and Steve was ready, and we were real careful!"
"Well I worry when blood is involved, Pete." Steve sighed, ruffling the boy's hair. "Did you help keep Uncle Clint in line for us while we were gone?" He smirked.
"Mhm," Peter leaned into Steve's touch, a sad look on his face, "Okay."
He stuck his fingers in his mouth, wetting them before starting to finger himself open, Steve watched with half-lidded eyes, loving the small noises that Tony made as he was worked open. He took Tony in his hand and started to stroke.
"He's gonna be fine," Tony soothed, rubbing Steve's knee as he drove toward Bucky's complex.
Tony blinked and chuckled softly, reaching up to rub the tears off his face.
"Honey, don't worry. Mama likes
" from Clint, who proceeded to grab Steve's ring hand.
He nuzzled Tony's neck and left loving kisses with a happy hum.
He leaned down to kiss Steve's temple, moving to pull on boxers and sweatpants before returning to Steve's side. The blond automatically moved to Tony when he made it back in the bed, latching onto the man with his arms and nuzzling his neck before falling straight asleep.
"I am not. Just busy." Steve called back down the stairs with a giggly Sammy.
"You are such a sap," Clint snorted, barely dodging a smack from Natasha.
Peter rolled his eyes but giggled anyway, tucking his head into Tony's chest bashfully.
"Das Miles, an' mine's Wade, an' Papa's is Harry," he explained.
"Sir--" Steve shivered in want, hips twitching up slightly as Tony mouthed against his cock straining against his briefs. "Please don't tease me."
"I can't help that my dick seems to really like you. Plus we are almost naked, so it makes it a bit difficult to not to with you."
"So you could breathe the whole time?" Steve said carefully, raising a brow at the human. From what he knew, humans didn't do that in water.
, right there,
She giggled lightly again and continued.
"Since I met you, old man," Tony laughed, propping himself up above Steve, "Well of
"S-s--ah, Sir--" Tony moaned loudly, muscles rippling under his skin as he pulled his bonds tight, "Please, please y'torturin' me here--"
Tony waved his hand over the cart, fingers dancing along the shelves till he found what he was looking for; he pulled down a medium-sized vibrator, a pale blue color.
"Pfft. Or you would've had a heart attack." Steve explained. "It took you forever to get me convinced to agree to the idea." He snorted, laying his head against Tony's. "I'm glad I was convinced, though."
Tony drove into his garage about a quarter passed eight. When he parked, he got out of the vehicle with a heavy grunt, taking a second to lean against his car to compose himself.
Tony watched Steve with hungry eyes, slicking himself up while he ran a hand up Steve's thigh.
"I don't... I don't know, Steve," Tony rubbed his eyes, unaware that Peter had snuck into the room to listen in, "I love you, more than anything, and I really do, but I-- I don't know if--"
"And I trust you." He hummed, nuzzling into the crook of Tony's neck. "You are very good to me."
"Yer weird..." Steve chuckled sleepily. "Felt good though. So much for a quiet night, huh?" He hummed.
"No, but they'd bring Unca' Clint, and that's close enough," Peter replied innocently.
Steve nodded, keeping Tony close to him soothingly. "I'll be absolutely sure to do that. I will." He assured.
Tony laughed at his whines, tugging Steve up over him.
Steve shook his head. "Peter has a lot, and we want you guys to open yours before we let him rip through." He explained softly. "You don't mind that, do you bubba?"
He smiled fondly at the memory, still sniffling as he leaned back against Steve.
Steve shook his head softly. "You'll be fine, Tony. Nothing I can't handle. I'll help you out with dealing with Howard." He assured softly. "As long as you keep me from punching him. He'll sue me into oblivion, for sure."
to go to meetings at the tower is the day Peter throws his biggest fit.
"Bad. No eating until after we say grace." Steve scolded playfully, carrying the potatoes to the table. "We'll talk about our trip after dinner."
Tony smiled fondly and made up Sammy's bottle, giving it to the baby before slumping down in his chair.
"Natasha, wait!"
"Sap," Tony mumbled, kissing Steve's eyelids, "I love you too, you big goof." He purposefully ignored the second part of the whisper, knowing the familiar twinge in his heart that conveyed his disbelief.
Tony wheezed slightly, eventually having to shake his head.
at all, you have JARVIS give me a call, all right? Meeting be damned."
(I'm just gonna stop rambling and let you read the chapter now...)
"I'm just not comfortable seeing myself like that when we're being intimate. I want to pay attention to you, and the mirror is distracting from that." He explained.
"Dat's Jarbis!" Peter said happily, watching the cartoon on the TV.
gifts. Got it?"
"Ya wouldn't have?!" Peter said surprised, as if his life had been so changed now knowing this information.
"Don'--don' feel bad," Tony hummed, turning a tiny smile to Steve, "Best all that blood came out of an accident and not 'cause of m'self, right?"
"Great? Just
very glad."
Sammy whined in Steve's arms and reached out for Peter, bursting into tears when he wasn't given back right away.
"Fuck," he grabbed at his head, whining at the pain throbbing through his skull, "Steeeeeve--"
"Nonononono, bubba bug." He said, grabbing up Sammy then scooping up the binky. "Don't need you hurt, too. That would be terrible."
, he thought, happily watching the robot-man drive around with his gun,
"Hi guys." Steve smiled in greeting, giving Tony a quick flash of 'What did I do?'
He patted at his Papa's chest, squealing when he spotted Peter curled up on the couch watching TV. Steve gasped softly with a smile at the baby.
"Steeeeve," he cooed, poking at the blond.
Peter grinned and giggled happily as he started to swing higher, watching his daddy swing along with him. "I'm swingin' like Spidahman!" He giggled.
"Hey lil guy, miss me?" he whispered, taking the baby over to the changing station, "I missed you,
"Yeah, yeah I'm fine. Just anxious." Steve said softly with a grin. He kissed Tony's cheek in return and ruffled Peter's hair. "Stay out here with Daddy and be good for me, okay? I'll be back as soon as I can."
Steve smiled back, kissing him sweetly. "Love you, too." He hummed. He stretched a bit, letting out a small groan, “Mh...sore.".
"If you wanted to, what you could--" Steve stopped, covering Peter's ears for a second. "What you could do is try both at once and keep the dad a mystery, if you really wanted to, anyway." He explained quietly, uncovering Peter's ears.
Tony sat up and heaved off the couch, padding over to his discarded clothes.
Slipping his hands down to Steve's hips, Tony opened his mouth slightly, gently nipping on Steve's lower lip.
"So, did that help warm you up a bit?"
"Oh my god, you're so cute," Tony snickered, smiling fondly at his snores, "Jesus Christ, I'm so in love with you." He sighed and laughed again, putting a hand through his hair.
"Jay, close the lab doors and keep Pete busy in his room, will you?" Tony called, grinning when the doors closed of their own accord, "Also, my project I was working on works. He’s finally got all his coding done. But more later, right now--"
"It really doesn't feel like it’s been that long at all. And yet, it feels like I've known you for much longer." He smiled softly. "And honestly, I don't think I have ever been happier with anyone else."
Peter padded into the kitchen, still in his onesie, a yawn stretching him out. He grabbed one of his kiddie yogurts from the fridge and a spoon, completely ignoring the adults as he went to watch cartoons.
"Mmm... You're making me lazier than I usually am. I've never been in bed so much."
"I know
"Why can't ya give him other food?" Peter asked, still a bit confused.
"Mmm, sounds nice. But you're gonna make me sleep if you keep that up." Steve hummed, referring to the scratching. "You know that's one of my weaknesses."
"We've already
"Yes, God, please," Tony groaned, head flopping back on the pillow, "I want you, baby--"
"He called you sex on legs, and Clint and Nat are a package deal," Tony laughed, moving to clean up the shot glasses and cake pan, "They'll be great together. I think Bucky will be able to keep Clint in line, and gives Nat someone to speak to." He paused. "He
They continued this way for a bit, Tony nipping and kissing along Steve's neck until he found a specific spot that the blond had reacted highly to. He sucked at the spot with a content hum, a sense of satisfaction that this would be the merman's first hickey and that he was the one to give it to him. Tony was so happy he made that voice box for Steve too, because the man was
Peter just giggled again, attempting to pull his undies up.
He crossed his leg over his thigh, hungrily raking his eyes over Steve. Steve glanced at him again with a small smirk, the look in Tony's eyes not going unnoticed.
Nodding, Peter tucked his head against Steve's chest, only letting himself be put down when they were next to his booster seat. He climbed up, putting his head down on the table while he waited for his breakfast.
"You still haven't asked your question, Rogers," he hummed.
, per say," Tony continued, a smirk sliding over his lips.
"Steve--"
"We came up to make squirt a quick lunch." Bucky explained. Sounds like a good time going on up here."
"You and your desk." He laughed fondly looking at the room. "Oh wow, it’s
"I'm not being mean, Tony. And I know you're hurt, I'm the one been taking care of you. Now is that mean?" He answered, running his hands along Tony's sides softly.
"Tony, be nice. He's already doing advanced work for a seven year old. Let him go his own pace." Steve stated, still watching as Sammy chewed on him. "Really, how you enjoy this is a mystery to me."
"Well, considering he asked me and I'm the 'innocent one', I'm technically will be the bride in a way. So white for me." Steve shrugged, cleaning up everything in the kitchen and saving some waffles for Tony later.
"I know you're sorry, but you have to learn." Steve said, folding his belt over once and patting at his lap.
Peter beat his tiny fists against Steve's chest, ignoring him.
“Syl!” Dodger answered in an enthusiastic noise, rubbing against Tony’s legs to try and help his trainer calm the other down.
"So, what're we going to start with?" He asked with a purr in his voice.
"Mmkay. You're driving," Tony hummed happily, trailing after Steve to the car, "Can we go get milkshakes first? I'm craving a milkshake."
This is the last chapter!.... But not the last part. Stay Tuned.
"How long have you had those?"
Walking into reception, Tony signed them in at the desk before heading over to the elevator, punching the button on the third floor.
"And what the
He came back with a warm wash cloth and wiped gently at Tony to clean him off, wiping himself off before tossing the cloth in the hamper and heading back to bed.
Tony happily kissed him back and snuggled up to him, worming his way up to tuck his head under Steve's chin.
"Sorry," Tony whispered against Steve's lips, pulling back to duck his head into Steve's neck, "I really fucked that one."
"Shit. Shit shit shit." He said quickly, rushing to find his clothes. "Damn it, I don't have time to shower and I have to get my uniform on, which is in my apartment. God, my boss is going to have my ass," he spouted nervously, running around like a chicken with his head cut off.
"You are literally the cheesiest person I know. But you're right. We can talk feelings," Tony chuckled, climbing on top of Steve. He twined their legs together, tucking his head under Steve's chin. "Whaddya wanna talk about?"
He put the correct size clothes on himself before sitting on the floor to help Peter step into his undies.
"It's been a heck of two days," he announced, sighing.
Tony whimpered pitifully, almost tearing the sheets from how hard he gripped them; he rolled his hips back, gasping in pleasure as Steve hit his sweet spot over and over again.
"Yay!" Peter squealed, laying down on Steve's chest completely, "I defeat'd the monstah!"
"Good. I want to spend a week just cuddling with you, zero clothes, zero responsibility, just you and me and the moonlight," Tony breathed, ghosting his lips over Steve's, "Whaddya say?"
He quickly washed Peter down, placing a kiss on his nose before helping him back out, wrapping a towel around him.
grease monkey with doctorates." Steve grinned, playing footsie with Tony. "My very sexy grease monkey--" he purred playfully.
dug their nails into my hand."
"You're terrible." He sighed softly with a smirk. "You just got a shower not long ago, hon."
"Good morning, Darling." He whispered back sweetly, continuing his kisses down Tony's body.
"Tony," Steve groaned in a warning. "Keep going like that and it'll take a bit before you'll get what you're wanting..."
"Sounds good to me." Steve hummed, eyes closing at the touches. "Ah-AhCHOO!!!"
"Y'know..."
"Alright. But I will not be Bambi's mom." Steve smirk, kissing both Tony and Peter's cheeks before heading downstairs.
Tony nodded and finished off his waffle before reaching over to wipe a stray drop of syrup off Pete's cheek.
Peter let out a quiet whine as he was put over Tony's lap, grabbing his pillow tight and tears forming at the corners of his eyes. He didn't even answer vocally, just nodded into his pillow as he prepared for the spanking. Tony quickly placed six even smacks on Peter's behind, helping him up once he was done.
He moaned loudly, rolling his hips up.
"Fank you," he mumbled, blushing slightly.
He grinned, nosing at his husband's groin before taking him in, relishing in the feeling of his cock pressed up against the back of his throat.
"Don't worry, you're gonna look all proper for Aunt Pepper," Tony teased, grabbing the washcloth.
Steve rolled his eyes playfully at that. "Well, a kid can dream, yeah?" He grinned. "I think I might just temporarily lose my strength a bit where you two could keep me down." He hummed.
"Wait a minute. I didn't say anything about Ramsey." He whispered to Tony. "How did--?"
He grinned at Steve's snort, hopping out of the car to go over to Steve's side. He held the door open, shutting it once his husband's hand was tucked into his own.
Steve had tried to text Tony a few times, but Tony hasn't ever bothered to check them. It physically hurt him that he was avoiding Steve, but Tony kept telling himself that he would get over it eventually. Here he was now, a week or so later, near semester end and he wasn't over it. So Tony just tried his best to cope with it by starting up his packing that afternoon. What a way to spend a birthday, packing things to leave and avoiding your one best friend you've had in a really long time.
"You need a bath though, got sauce all over your face," Tony chuckled, scooping Peter up, "How about a bath, then we can play till bedtime? Sound good?"
Tony buried his face in the comforter again, so the blond wouldn't see the tears streaking down his face.
"But you should feel lucky. Most parents kill for their baby's first word to be theirs." Steve explained as he bounced Sammy on his knee. "Pretty sure he is gonna say 'Bubba' first."
It’s been a
it was starting to hurt. Tony could feel the welts start up, but he kept with it, managing to hold back the sting of tears.
"But--" Peter said with a pout, "it got on you too."
Tony groaned loudly as got up and stormed out the door.
"Yes," Tony groaned, clawing at the desk, "Yes, yes sir, please, been so bad--"
!" Peter babbled on, nuzzling into Natasha's neck.
"Sure thing." Steve stated, following Clint along and hefting the couches inside.
The boy eventually nodded, cries subsiding to sniffles as he hunkered down under the covers, face a little blotchy from the tear tracks.
"Only blank papers." Peter sighed, Steve ruffling his hair.
"Jus' bout. I've got two questions left to answer, but I figured I could finish it later." Peter hummed, snuggling closer. "I'm spending time with you two now."
"Fank yew," He garbled around his food.
"Not a problem, Tony..." Steve whispered back, continuing to soothe and waiting to hear Tony softly snoring once more before falling back into sleep of his own.
"So pretty like this, Steve," Tony breathed, spit dripping off his lips, "So pretty."
He nonchalantly stretched out on the couch to lounge, shutting his eyes to help give Peter his element of surprise.
"I should have been clearer. No sounds from you," he laughed, "Sorry."
"You know you are asking the wrong person that question." Steve admitted, rubbing at his nose softly. "But we'll see. You could get it, you could not. It'll be a surprise answer."
"Steeeeeve."
He flicked an eyebrow up, forgoing the paddle to first see what played out; he hiked up Steve's skirt, clicking his tongue at the lacy panties and garters that barely covered his ass. "You know this type of undergarments aren't allowed, Steve," Tony clicked his tongue, "What do you have to say for yourself?"
“Please don’t. I feel like I got hit by five trucks consecutively.” The blond grumbled into his pillow, refusing to move from his lying position anytime soon.
"I was trying to help Daddy try and understand how much he always means to me. And everyone else." Steve explained softly. "He has a hard time believing it himself, so I'm trying to help him. It'll take a bit and it may not always be pretty, but it never means we are arguing bad enough it would me us separating."
"What’s with all the kisses anyway, Daddy?" He ask curiously.
"Guesthouse it is! Cheers!" Clint grinned, everyone picking up another shot and throwing it back.
"Always there for him," Clint replied weakly, "Always."
Tony gave the other a soft smirk, earning one back from the blond before he continued.
Tony only half-listened at Steve explained the process to Peter, glancing up every once in a while to make sure they hadn't left without him noticing. Eventually, his hand started to cramp from writing, in which he muttered under his breath, wringing out his hand with a soft whimper.
“Oh great. Is this like some new torture method Fury’s working on? Every week a new SHIELD agent shows up to get Fruit Loops in my couch.”
“Nah, man come play with us. We were just about to make Stark buy us Chinese food and then I was gonna laugh at him while Nat stole all his money,” the archer calls from his spot on the rug as he pats the floor next to him. “C’mon, I’ll deal you in and then you can help Nat steal all of Stark’s hard-earned cash.”
Bruce laughs and looks around the space, the home Tony built with him in mind, and he smiles over at his friend.
, but she can’t handle loving him knowing she might have to bury him at any moment. He smiles softly, he holds her as she cries and he tells her he understands. Because he does. He understands the hurt and pain and horror she’s been through, because of him, Obadiah and Hammer and Killian, all his fault, and he can’t believe he was selfish enough to put her in harm’s way over and over again until she was shaking with nightmares next to him as he stared sleeplessly at the ceiling to avoid his own trauma stained dreams. He understands, so he presses a soft kiss to her forehead and whispers platitudes and reassurances,
**************
The archer cracks his eyes open wider than that. “Even though I desecrated your PopTarts?” he sounds sad as he slurs out the question, as if he’d thought Tony was only approaching to throw him out the door.
He slides the coffee across to Steve who’s sitting with his head in his hands and he looks up surprised when Tony pushes the mug in his direction. He smiles softly, fond, and it’s an expression the engineer’s never seen on him before and he thinks about how nice it looks on the other man’s face. The supersoldier takes a sip and sighs contently, “Thanks, Stark.”
“Oh shut up, Stark,” Clint turns and grins around a mouthful of cereal. “You know you love me.”
Thor flushes pink at the question and he rubs a hand through his wet hair. “I was delivering Lady Jane back to her home on Midgard when she…” he pauses trying to find the right words for a moment, “I believe the term your people use is ‘broke up’ with me. I must confess, this development came as a bit of a shock. I have never been ‘dumped’ before, as your interwebs put it. However, Lady Darcy assured me the only remedy for the ending of a courtship is one’s shield brothers and something she calls ‘ice cream.’ So I thought I might inquire as to where I might encounter this magical tonic you call ice cream.”
do, and I guess she really couldn’t. Or maybe she could handle the Avengers and she just couldn’t handle
, with all the shit we do and everything. But, I don’t know, man. I really, really liked her and I thought maybe she could actually handle, well, me and all the shit I do,
The sadness eases somewhat from the larger man’s expression as he lets out a booming laugh. “I agree, Stark. It is a shame you had to meet after he fell under Thanos’ thrall. I believe, in a another life, you two would have made great friends. Though, now that I consider it, I believe you two would have most likely conquered all nine realms on a lark,” Thor’s brow furrows in worry at the thought and Tony chuckles at the man’s alarmed expression.
“I wasn’t aware that Satanists practice Holy Communion.”
now-- Wait, no, Jesus Christ do not do that!” He stands up from the couch, running a hand through his hair he strides briskly towards the elevator. He’s waving his free hand around as he listens to the other person ramble and turns back towards the pair on the couch as he pulls his phone away from his ear. “Sorry, guys some intern’s about to start an apocalypse and I only employ morons apparently so I have to go handle it,” he rolls his eyes as if someone’s just broken the toaster, not a caused a potential catastrophe.
“Chick flicks, Thor,” he snorts out, chuckling. “C’mon I’ll get some ice cream delivered and we can watch sappy movies all night. Let’s go get you a change of clothes.”
and Bruce shoots a glare at Clint when he snickers at the scientist’s choice of the
PopTart flavor for just a second and try and get an explanation as to what you’re doing here drunk at three a.m. on a Tuesday, Katniss?”
So he makes his way up the elevator to the common room kitchen groggily, scrubbing at his face to try and wake up. He does have coffee in his workshop, but DUM-E had decided to douse his Sumatra in motor oil yesterday morning so he decides he’d rather make the trip upstairs than possibly be the first person to die at the hands of an AI with the intelligence of toddler.
That’s not to say he’s not happy to see Thor when he shows up six weeks after their poker game with Bruce. They’re all gathered in the common room; it’s a lazy night, there honestly hasn’t been enough high-level threats to assemble the team in two whole months and, in that time, they’ve settled into a routine. Most nights, they eat dinner together before settling into the common room to watch a movie or play cards. There’s Movie Night and Poker Night every week and Tony’s honestly considering breaking out some of his old Dungeons and Dragons books because he can only clean Clint out so many times before he genuinely starts to feel bad.
“Whoa there, big guy!” he laughs, grimacing a bit at the soaking wet clothes wetting his front. Thor gently sets him back on his feet, before pulling back to give the engineer a wide, toothy smile. “What are you doing here, buddy? I thought you were guarding Loki back in Asgard.”
He has JARVIS direct Thor to his room (he’s preemptively stocked the closets with some Earth clothes for the god should he ever decide to ditch the alien get up) and orders his AI to compile a list of sappy romances and order a ludicrous amount of ice cream.
, free from all the negative connotations tangled up with New York from his childhood and literal wormholes.
“I mean, I know you only said you wanted to hang around for a few days, but you’re welcome to stay as long as you want. I mean Clint and Natasha basically moved in already so-” the billionaire shrugs, “It’d be nice to have someone around who doesn’t look at me like I’m speaking in tongues when I try to explain just how cool my new inertial dampeners are.”
. They all settle back into the couches and Bruce doesn’t make it to the guest room that night. He falls asleep on Tony’s shoulder as he watches Clint and Nat snuggle up on the couch over. He smiles warm, drunk, happy and wonders if Tony would mind if he stayed a couple days longer than he originally planned.
Tony rolls his eyes as he takes a sip of his coffee and Nat laughs. “Jesus, Clint, was Laura so bad you’re trying to get into Stark’s pants now?”
, which I get, I’m” he gestures at himself and makes a face eyes squeezed shut. He sighs and cuts off.
Clint groans on the floor. “I wanted PopTarts, now,” he whines.

So the truth falls out of him. Too much, too honest and raw, but he can’t stop it through the exhausted early morning haze of his brain when his lips fall open.
The archer sighs softly and brings both hands to his face to scrub at it. “My girlfriend kicked me out and Nat’s gone on some mission and I left my wallet back at her apartment and SHIELD’s gone so I’m kind of out of a job and--” his voice sounds a little broken when he speaks again and Tony can swear he hears a hint of waterlogged tears threatening to overcome his teammate’s slur. “I can go if you want. I just-” his voice cracks a bit, “I know it’s stupid to be upset over some
While the original idea turned out differently, I kept the chapter titles from the song "Stay Awake" by London Grammar.
“Indeed, dear Anthony. This past fortnight has indeed been ‘rough’ as you say,” Thor sighs sadly and Tony feels his smirk drop from his face, to be replaced by a concerned furrow of his brow. The Asgardian genuinely looks like he’s about to cry and while Tony can’t judge (Natasha found him crying over an ASPCA commercial three days ago;
Tony can’t help the loud bark of laughter that escapes his throat as the archer has the decency to look a bit ashamed of the words that just left his mouth.
The AI doesn’t reply immediately. “I am… unsure, sir. It seems to be a localized meteorological event, but I’m finding no reports of it throughout the city.”
“If love is suddenly a pseudonym for
He calls on the plane back from India and asks for a guest room at the tower for a couple of days. So at least Tony’s expecting him when he shows up a month after Clint and Natasha have settled into a routine around the tower. He looks tired and tanned when he self consciously steps out of the elevator into the common room where the archer, the genius, and the assassin are gathered around the coffee table with cards in hand and stacks of colored chips in front of them.
The rest of the team starts filtering into Avengers Tower a month after SHIELD falls. Clint shows up first, which surprises Tony initially, but as he gets to know the archer better he’s simply surprised he hadn’t found the assassin snuggled up in the Tower vents with all Tony’s blankets one day.
Steve chuckles at that and gives the engineer a grateful half-smile. “That does sound like Clint.”
Clint’s howling with laughter and Tony can make out the sound of Natasha snorting in the background.
He ends the confession with a joke, trying to hide the wetness tingeing his voice, but Steve doesn’t respond. Instead, he squeezes Tony’s knee in one hand, comforting, and lifts the other to press a wide strong hand over where Tony’s fingers are running over the scar tissue.
That first day is blissful, Tony thinks, pressed too close to Steve on the couch as they marathon Star Wars.
Then Steve pulls back, settles back into his chair and Tony sees him turn an embarrassed shade of scarlet as he notices the coffee staining Tony’s shirt.
Tony just rolls his eyes. “Well Barton showed up drunk at 3 a.m. and ate all my PopTarts so this is considerably better. I’m not gonna make you leave just to make you haul your ass back through Manhattan traffic later.”
He lets out a laugh, the sound disbelieving and wet at the edges. But Steve just shakes his head and presses his hand tighter, fingers twining with the engineer’s to rest gentle against the scarred flesh. “Your scars are beautiful, Tony. Just like the rest of you, but even more so,” he lifts his hand from the engineer’s knee, to press it against his cheek and Tony blames his sleep-muffled mind for the way he leans into the touch. “Because you survived. You survived all that, you lived through that pain and you just got stronger. You looked in the face of evil and you didn’t run. And, trust me, I’ve seen it my whole life; most men they face that evil, they stare it down and they run for the hills. But, you-” he pauses, eyes twinkling in the dark with earnestness, “you built yourself an armor and you fought. You fought like hell, so no one else would ever have to face it again. And that’s what those scars are. All your strength. All your bravery and your fight. Everything that makes you a hero, painted on your skin. I saw it when you flew through that portal and I see it now. And that’s beautiful. You’re beautiful, Tony.”
“I do not understand. What is so humorous about these ‘flicks of chicks?’”
“Hey, Tony. Sorry, I didn’t realize I was interrupting poker night,” he gives an awkward smile over the billionaire’s shoulder to the two assassins sprawled on the floor.
He doesn’t fear dreams about wormholes or icy water or electric whips.
Thor smiles widely, the previous sadness draining out of his face. “I know nothing of these so-called ‘flicks of chicks,’ however I trust you greatly in matters of the heart, dear Anthony.”
Clint lifts his head slightly, to shoot him a withering glare before he answers.
The supersoldier is blatantly staring, eyes transfixed on his bare chest, miles of toned olive skin gleaming in the pale moonlight. Tony squirms a bit, uncomfortable under his gaze. He hasn’t exactly been eager to take off his shirt since Afghanistan. Before it was the way they would always stare at the arc reactor, eyes wide and curious, questioning. Now, he’s all too aware of the heavy scar streaking up his sternum with tendrils of scar tissue curling across his pectorals. The scar’s worth it, to have the arc reactor out of his chest. He doesn’t dream of shrapnel creeping into his arteries while he sleeps anymore and the foreign metal doesn’t weight down his chest, stealing his breath when the air goes cold in winter. But Steve’s staring in the moonlight and he feels unfamiliar self-consciousness surge up, choking in his chest.
Tony laughs at that and it’s clear and loud, honest. “I don’t know if anyone’s warned you yet, but it’s basically impossible to get something through my thick skull.”
“Hey Jarvis. Pull up the blueprints for floors 56 through 62. And find a good contractor. I know some people that are going to need a guest room for a while.”
Steve turns a little pink at that, “Sorry, didn’t realize it was so early. Serum makes it hard to sleep sometimes.” He shrugs a little, embarrassed. “I can come back later if you want.”
Tony never intends to live in the Tower.
The soldier chuckles and scolds him about proper diet for a growing team--Tony can’t suppress his eye roll, as if those giants need to grow even more--but, acquiesces to a healthier option.
“JARVIS? What’s going on?” he asks, tamping down the anxiety in his voice.
,” the ex-SHIELD agent whines, “I told you that in confidence, I don’t go around airing all your traumatic memories to our asshole teammates.”
“Okay, let’s get off your illogical hatred for the
In the moment however, it’s rather disconcerting finding Hawkeye drunk on his pantry floor at three a.m. on a Tuesday. He hears noise in the kitchen, and goes to investigate, snatching up a rolling pin on the way. While, he's more than confident JARVIS would alert him to an intruder, he’s been kidnapped just an
Tony just shakes his head at them and cracks a smile as the elevator slides open to reveal a soaking wet Thor, Mjolnir in hand.
Whereas, about thirty seconds before he was disgruntled about finding a drunk archer on his floor, now his heart floods with some warm, sticky sensation he would almost dub affection if that weren’t so irrevocably out of his emotional repertoire. As it is, he feels himself soften to the archer and he walks over to take a spot on the floor next to the drunk man.
“Oh god, I’m so sorry, Tony!” He snatches up a pile of napkins from the table and leans over the table to dab futilely at the engineer’s shift. He scrunches up his face when he just rubs the coffee into the motor oil embedded in his shift and forms one big messy stain down the front. “Oh geez…” he murmurs, an embarrassed flush staining up his cheeks as he scrubs at the back of his neck.
of fungus exactly?” He furrows his brow as he listens to the person on the other end and his face twists in alarm. “What do you mean he’s
The engineer smiles around his coffee cup in the warm light streaming through the windows. “Deal, Widow. Beat up Robin Hood for me if he tries to buy My Little Pony on my account again and I will show you to your floor.”
Clint laughs back and Tony smiles at the sound--pure and clear, it doesn’t sound tainted by restrained tears anymore. “How about we get you to bed, Barton. And I’ll see if I can get some poor Postmate to bring you some PopTarts at ass o’clock on a Tuesday.”
The ice cream arrives at the same time Thor does, hair tied back in a loose ponytail, dressed in sweats and a graphic tee with Mjolnir printed on the front. Tony grins at the choice (he’d slipped the shirt in the man’s closet as a joke).
He gets it, he’s talked on the phone to Steve once or twice after the whole SHIELD business, knows he’s out there searching for his old friend. But, he certainly didn’t expect a literal alien god to show up asking for a room before the super soldier did.
“Shit!” Tony jumps and swivels around, grabbing the first thing he finds on the counter to use as a weapon and brandishing it defensively in front of him.
Bruce smiles over at the archer as Tony rolls his eyes, before calling back over his shoulder, “It’s not my fault you suck at poker, Barton,” he turns back to Bruce with a twinkle in this eye though. “You really should play, green machine. You’re too nice, which means you’ll be able to bluff Nat out of all her money before she knows what hit her.”
Tony just laughs at the other man, Steve can be so… well,
“Okay, first off, what are you doing here. Secondly, and
Tony tries not to be offended when Thor shows up before Steve does.
“Quit it. You’re grown men, stop acting like children,” she rolls her eyes as she takes a sip of her own scotch. “Though I would say, “last picked for dodgeball assassin.” Tony laughs uproariously as Clint casts hurt, puppy dog eyes in Natasha’s direction.
Only a week later he stumbles into the living room still rubbing sleep out of his eyes and discovers Clint and Natasha snuggled up on the couch watching cartoons eating cereal in their pajamas.
Sure, New York is fine and Pepper loves dragging him to Broadway on Friday nights, but Malibu has been his home for a very long time. He’d chosen the sunny California city as the new headquarters of Stark Industries three weeks after his parents died and he couldn’t stand the suffocating emptiness of the Stark Mansion a second longer. Instead he founded a new headquarters in the sun and built his dream home into the side of cliff where he could hear waves breaking on the rocks below as he stared up at his ceiling night after sleepless night. Stark Tower was beautiful, sleek and modern, everything he’d wanted it to be, but nothing could compare to the comfort and safety of his workshop, his bots flitting around him as he revolutionized the future of technology. Or, more accurately, invented a sentient toaster because he’d maybe dranken a little too much of his emergency workshop scotch. Regardless, Malibu was
Tony pulls his hand back and clears his throat (because he’s suddenly feeling hot and he’s starting to think he probably looks as pink as Bruce when Thor calls him ‘fair’). “It’s not a problem. JARVIS is already programmed to search the globe for any signs of enhanced individuals. It shouldn’t be a problem to tweak the algorithm to search for a cybernetically enhanced supersoldier. They tend to get noticed eventually.”
Tony gives him a small smile, soft and affectionate, one he usually reserves for Pepper when she brings him his espresso in the morning.
and Tony thinks he wouldn’t mind if this became a regular occurence.
“I’m not sure I believe you soldier. But, thanks that- that means a lot.” Steve just shoots him a winning smile and squeezes the hand still twined over Tony’s heart before he pulls back and stands.
amount at this point. And as much as Tony Stark enjoys some light bondage and spanking, he is considerably less into it when it's terrorists and criminals wielding the zip-ties. Not that he would ever use zip-ties on someone--he’s not a sadist--no, he owns a lovely collection of fuzzy handcuffs and silk ties for that purpose, thank you very much.
When he looks back at the man, he looks a bit shocked. “So I can, like, stay here?” he sounds bewildered as if he fully expected Tony to send his ass packing.
“And you couldn’t have, I don’t know, waited until the rest of the world was awake to announce you’re my new roommate?”
Instead, a very drunk Clint sprawls on the floor covered in about fifty shiny foil packets.
It’s an hour that Tony that can’t decisively classify as either early or late.  Regardless, the engineer hunches over his workbench designing new explosive arrows for Clint. But at this point, it’s been 36 hours without sleep and he’s rubbing at his eyes as blueprints blur together in front of him. He blinks at the hologram for a moment and when one of the equations he’s scribbled on the corner of his notes starts to look more like hieroglyphics than actual numbers, he decides that coffee’s in order. One cup of coffee and then he can finish these arrows. Maybe if he’s lucky he can fall asleep without dreaming about suffocating in gold-titanium alloy as he drifts eternally through foreign stars.
The engineer shrugs as the archer gives him a suggestive eyebrow wiggle. “What can I say Romanoff everybody wants a piece of this.” She scoffs at him as Clint leans over and mock-whispers in her ear.
Tony doesn’t respond, just gives him a winning smile and raises his hands in surrender. “I’m sorry birdbrain, you forced my hand. You keep buying My Little Pony episodes on my account and it’s really fucking up my recommendations list,” he clasps a hand to his heart and continues earnestly, “I am a man of science and you are going to make their sad little algorithms explode if you keep giving it whiplash by buying children’s shows and explosive ammunition in the same purchase,” he pauses for a second and puts a finger to his trademark goatee. “Actually, never mind Clint, I am almost certain that means you are, in fact, a serial killer and I should definitely never let you buy anything under my name ever again because I do not want that evidence being traced back to me.”
He latched onto the missile, maneuvering it to the angles displayed on his HUD. His eyes scanned the rest of the calculations as Cap's voice echoed in his ear, "Stark, you know that's a one way trip." And somehow he didn't have neither the strength nor the time to analyse the tone in the Captain's voice.
"Yeah. That's exactly what you should talk about when old curious ears are trying to listen in.", Steve bit back, turning Tony amidst sway and muttering a soft '
But he was happy. There was a point in that day several hours ago, he felt like he had lost all of his family and he had never loved being this wrong. He felt grateful for being a part of this happiness.
Barnes pacing in circles in the living room as the elevator opened.
I know he is always shown as this focused, strong leader, so the fact that he is a big old softie gets overshadowed. His grief was shown, in suppressed ways, but his fascination was not. That's probably why I wanted to write this.
Tony felt like he was on drugs. Or maybe just adrenaline. Or 'back-from-the-dead-but-not-really' thrill. Whomsoever was responsible for naming it but he felt high.
CEO got a handful of hyperactive
Bucky stress-bakes Barnes,
Tony cursed as he saw the red spot beeping in the Tower structure displayed on the HUD. "Well, tell him he'll be a great dad. Don't let him fall. Love you, Pep." The call ended abruptly as he zoomed into the gut-wrenchingly dark hole counting seconds left.
For once he wanted to cower behind Pepper as Bucky took long strides ending up right in front of him. A flash of metal struck out and he was suddenly completely encompassed in a familiar warm hug.
"Save the rest for the turn, J.", Tony commanded, his mind gushing with various possibilities which frustratingly gave one outcome.
Even DUM-E knows that. Which probably meant it was Steve trying to annoy him again.

"I looked through the fridge for leftovers and I hate that you had Italian again without me. Why do you both do that when I'm not here? Is it a cruel code or something? Leaving little pasta leftovers for me to mope over? But still I heated up some food and I am really really hungry so you need to sit up and tell me you're okay because I'm also running out of non-depressing things to talk about?", Bucky took a last finishing breath.
"You think I'm any different?", Tony had mumbled under the next hitch of his breath as Steve pulled him closer, moving them in gentle sways and twirling Tony with mischievous glee.
"When you're finished, you'll come back to the tower where I'll pummel some sense into you. Got it?" Bucky's deadly monotonic voice filled his ear.
feeling another wave of relief spread through his body.
His feet slowly took him to the painting, his hands outstretched craving to touch it when he saw the ring. Nestled in the open box, it glinted off the holographic blue as Tony slowly picked it up. His mind clicking the pieces together as his eyes felt wet and his heart heavy with love.
I really have no idea what state of mind I was in when I wrote this chapter.
Tony's fingers were busy adjusting Steve's medals but Tony could barely string a thought together being held this close, this good. All he wanted to do was hang onto Steve and wish he would whisk Tony away.
I guess I wanted to not let go of the fact that yes, people who are depressed or have PTSD can be happy even if it feels like it can slip sooner than they can blink.

"Moreover, the inner Tony Stark is also a stuttering idiot as much as I have seen. And I've seen loads. Suave, my ass.", Steve's voice drew Tony back from his haze.
Pepper hold-the-fort Potts and some OCs.
Steve had sat there looking at Tony stretching and curling up in the blankets, reluctant to go for today's run. Tony had kept looking at the love of his life, still wondering how he got to wake up to this.
"Nobody's asking you to.", Pepper whispered, letting her fingers trace weird circles on her pant-clad leg. "I'm so sentimental, these hormones. Well, it's not you who had to rush to a hospital in LA to find out you're pregnant? That's a good part in your life.", she sighed and slumped back in her place.
that seemed too familiar to the time they were waterboarding him but this time it was in space, looking at the wormhole close below him and falling into an infinite something. And no one would ever find him ever again. It would be fitting.
And that is exactly how a tired
Steve stared at him unabashed, "He insisted. I mean JARVIS, Pepper and Rhodey knew. Butterfingers and U did, too. But DUM-E wanted to help so bad."
Tony had said.
The aforementioned Ms. Martin is also an original character just like the other tons of OC I'm writing up in this fic.
He grabbed the phone lying in a corner and stuffed it in his pocket just as he heard Nat speaking again, "Coulson's gone. We'll have to do it alone. Clint's not safe there. If you're gonna snatch Cap, then snatch Clint too. And Dr. Banner. I'll play along."

"I swear if you pull one of those Expo things trying to die on me-" She didn't let herself finish the sentence as she chose another way. "He's in the tower, you know. James."
His eyes ran over all of Tony's face and he felt a tug inside him as he responded with an equally soft
Tony wouldn't blame anyone. It was stunning how Steve Rogers could feel as gentle as a daisy and as colossal as a nebula. That was by far the most accurate way Tony could describe him.
Plus the moment of Steve and Tony just falling all over each other gives me life.
I'm too much in love with them. All I wanted was a ball of fluff and I ended up writing this. No regrets though, damnit. I'm loving this.
Steve stared at the wormhole with bated breath not knowing what he was painfully hoping for but completely aware that he'd have to call it.
Tony turned back just in time to catch the Captain's eyes. Another worry of how he was going to explain this insanity of a new world and Bucky being alive and everything to the Captain coursed through him. That was for him to worry on another day.
Tony just shrugged innocently and kept prodding at Steve, making noises of curiosity until Steve gave in.
ft. Natasha will-protect-you-always Romanoff,
Bucky's voice softened and Tony could somehow imagine how soft his face might have gone, "Credit? If you make it out alive, sure. Just come back home tonight soon. Pepper will be here but Rhodey is stuck with his asshole superiors and Happy has to go check on someone later. I'll make sure my girlfriend doesn't stab you with her stilettos."
hand tightened into a fist as he swayed slightly.
It wasn't like they hadn't danced before. They had. In the confines of their bedroom. Or in Tony's workshop with DUM-E swaying behind them holding a holographic jukebox he learnt to use from god-knows-where. Or the Tower's roof, under the fireworks that coloured the sky on Steve's birthday.
Steve Rogers is the sweetest human ever. And if I couldn't resist writing a fuck ton of fluff and angst over him, I'm only human.
Steve because god-knows that that man needed all of this more than Tony did, that was no one's business but his.
Eleanora is an original character. She's not a Marvel character or based off any other.
Except if Pepper did tell Bucky tonight that she was pregnant with their child. And then another amusing worry of how he'll have one more competitor for the godfather part because he sure as hell wasn't giving it up to Rhodes. If Cap even handled it before having an aneurysm.
"Please do not tell me what you do in your personal time.", Tony scrunched up his face.
It is very hard for me to imagine forgiving someone who lied about other man's death when one of your loved ones lives with taking entire responsibility for that in their head for months.
They are superheroes, they won't ever reach a point where everything will be stable. But they can reach a point where they are better versions of themselves because they want to be, not because they have to be there for someone.  That's when they will know how to click together in place beside each other.
I can't, for the life of me, bear to romanticise mental health. There's more to life than romance. But there's not much in life if you can't bear to live in your own head.
His only grief would be leaving his little family of his best friends and robots and his AI. But he wouldn't feel it if he was fighting for his last breaths of air, would he?
Steve's familiar curvy handwriting on the note with a little blotch of paint sent a wave of overwhelming love through Tony's entire being.
The amount of satisfaction I felt while writing the least of that action sequence just confirmed that I'll be writing a whole lot more fights.
He walked onto the open ramp for Iron Man's landing when Jarvis alerted him of the call.
This would've been a good way to die but it didn't feel that way. Ignoring the throbbing in every fibre of his body, he let loose and closed his eyes, giving up.
And Steve should probably stop thinking about Tony too much.
He just felt a bit stupid that he ever doubted Steve wouldn't want to take him to dancing wearing fancy clothes under the gazes of the people who had seen him fight the world war themselves.
"God, I love you so much.", Bucky continued as if in a haste to get it all out before he spontaneously combusted. Running his hands through her locks, he looked disbelievingly at Tony who grinned wide pointing at himself mouthing '
"You are not allowed to joke about this so soon. In fact, you are not allowed to joke about it ever."
under her breath. There was this momentary silence in which she tried to comfort him in her own way without words.
He raised his heavy head, ignoring everything that happened to glare at Pepper, "You can't wear those pajamas when you aren't on periods. It's cheating. You literally can't wear them for a long long time."
I absolutely needed Pepper and Steve's friendship. The compatibility they have was something never mentioned in the movies. God, they could've been the bestest of friends, but still.. tHANks MaRveL, anyway.
Yep, this officially ranges in the 6K words area and I'm posting this after an eon ie.barely 5 days. But boy, this chapter needed it.
, she had urged as her sunken eyes still shone with the same happiness.
"I don't even know.", Tony shrugged. "I can't promise this won't happen again. After what I saw, I can't promise anything except I'll try to not give you anymore heart attacks. But we both know that's not true." He said just as Pepper scoffed with an
Tony waited for her to scold him, scream at him, anything. That was what he was expecting after the unnaturally silent phone call asking him to pick her up.
After the agreement,
"Alright, hey. Alright, good job guys. Let's just not come in tomorrow. Let's just take a day. Have you ever tried shawarma? There's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here. I don't know what it is but I wanna try it." Tony went on.
I got so entangled in writing some one shots (which turned out to be a series of shots) that I kept delaying this.
A part of him knew this memory will be ingrained in his mind, drawn and painted over a hundred times till it becomes muscle memory because that's the only way he knew how to cope with this.
Tony took a shaky breath strengthening himself as he took a sharp turn, pushing the repulsors to their max power to chase the missile racing towards the city.
The feeling of the cold metal on his ring finger was probably what kick-started his brain again. He flung himself on Steve, being caught mid-air as he laughed, "You had to take help from DUM-E?"
He heard when Tony offered a car to drop them back to SHIELD, but he stayed quiet letting others take the decision. Turning towards both the agents, he fully expected them to decline but instead got tired nods.
Tony woke up to a soft kiss on his forehead like he always did. Usually it was just Steve giving him one last peck before he went for his run. It felt different when he woke up to warm arms and the smell of coffee wafting all around him.
It took all of his strength to keep himself upright on the table. Steve barely escaped faceplanting into the said shawarma a couple of times. And god, it tasted heavenly. That was one of the best things of this century.
Just as everyone was walking out, he felt a small hand tugging him back cautiously. He turned to see Natasha, but before he could get a word out he was being passed to Tony who had suddenly appeared on his other side settling on his other arm out of thin air.
(See the end of the chapter for
And probably more seconds later, just after Tony was feeling too good over how exactly what he predicted had happened but was still afraid of Bucky's response, the aforementioned man shot up straight half-screaming as if it just hit him, "We're gonna be parents? Together?"
Steve's softened eyes were contradicting his mischievous smile, "Abuse. Already, Mr. Stark-Rogers?"
When Tony made a confused noise, Steve continued, "Martha there, asked me to have some sense and go dance with my sweetheart. I'm just hoping I accidentally know how to dance from all the time we spent trying to make my two left feet know how to." Expectant blue eyes with a glimmer of fear held Tony in his place.
as he stared dreamily with love at his aunt finally getting her dance.
"Oh-kay. Low blow. Not that low, but still-"
He turned and glared at the agents dismissively, "So you need to start devising your witchy masterplan about how you're gonna get them here without suspicions, scary lady. Pirate-boss should not know, I need confirmation he's good. I am not gonna let Bruce get away at all though. So do something to get them all out."
Also I was a sucker for Steve-Pepper bonding.
I wanted to make sure that they didn't. That they take their time to fit in together like pieces of puzzles even if the ends take longer to fit, that they consider the fact that loving and living together comes with responsibility.
He wished he knew Stark more, wished he had apologized or just done anything. Anything so he would've gotten to talk to him because it felt too big of a loss losing Stark when he barely knew him.
Tony felt his eyes burn as he chimed back, "Pepper just might. That was the second time she thought I was dying on her. I need to go though. Love you, Barnes." He felt this overwhelming need to gather everyone he loved in a pile and sleep on them like a dragon on its hoard.
"Oh c'mon. Give me some credit. Also you didn't tell me you were in the tower or even New York, Pep did.", Tony tried diverting, running his eyes over the expanse of New York and
And Tony did. Months of dating had done nothing to calm the fear in Tony to confess but his aunt had. In a smile. So he had danced with Steve who stepped on his toes and apologized everytime with a kiss and when the moon was up in the sky that night, Steve had whispered to Tony telling him how much he loved him.
Tony spent a good amount of time staring at the ceiling, his eyes tracing the sharp lines of the patterns. Sighing he looked at Bucky blearily blinking the tears out, a slight nod as he listened to Bucky drone on sitting beside him and the sound of Pepper rhythmically tapping her nails on the glass table. He had been probably sleeping ,
but he felt too blinded by the light of the blast which shone through the dark hole contrasting with the blue cloudy sky around it.
Steve hummed as his eyes slipped close, their foreheads touching while they still moved under their comforting muted sways.
"Tony? What's going on?", Pepper's trembling voice sounded after some seconds which felt too less.
It was scary how the sight of that tower just hours ago felt like one of the best things happening to him and now it was probably one of the last things Tony Stark saw.
She had soon stepped back in fatigue and content, pulling Tony in and kissing his head in gratefulness before pushing Tony gently in Steve's arms to continue that dance. Steve's arm tightening around his waist without a second amiss.
He nodded towards Romanoff, taking off towards the minibar after seeing her following him. "The Captain's not safe there.", Tasha muttered under her breath.
Tony winced internally but didn't show it at all, continuing walking nonchalantly. "How'd you know?", he murmured.
His eyes glazed as the missile hit the Chitauri mother ship and he could swear that he could feel the waves of the explosion as he fell down and down and down.
for long if they were both here, showered and changed.
The stars twinkled and the thought of how he was just a man in a tin can unaware of the danger looming over them in this large universe, in which they were apparently not alone as he believed just hours ago, pierced through him.
Steve couldn't stop the grin over this ridiculous man in front of him. Tony. Only Tony could do that. As far as he'd seen.
He had been radiant under the gleaming lights all night. His eyes crinkling as he smiled at the people telling him stories from back in their day. His hands holding the sentimental old souls while his words held them enamoured.
"It's nice how you did this for Steve even when you knew that you'll have to talk about Howard if people ask.", Natasha turned around in her seat, watching Steve and Thor talk to another little kid who was probably someone's grandchild.
Clint makes-the-world-seem-better Barton,
He heard a sharp inhale of breath and his head snapped upwards just in time to see Stark come through. "Son of a gun", he breathed out.
She sighed, "I'll look into it. Keep the channel open. I'll talk to you later. Also I call dibs on Godmother. And tell JARVIS that I need a reaction video of Pepper telling Barnes about it.", a genuine smile popped on Natashalie's face for a fraction of a second. With that she took off towards Barton who was cautiously eyeing them.
He could care less about being decent by dancing half a foot away so he leaned his entire tired body on Steve and let Steve direct him in gentle waves.
Steve shrugged it off thinking she was probably Tony's dame.
"We're not finished yet.", Thor said. They all turned to look at him. Steve felt tired. His bones ached. All he wanted to do was get out of here. Or get onto that shawarma offer. But he knew they had to finish this.
He looked back at Stark to find him staring back at him. He could feel himself heating up but he pointedly ignored his possibly flushed skin. Because by then had begun the babbling.
"Okay. Stay safe.", Tony whispered as the once sharp brown eyes turned into soft brown doe eyes right in front of Steve sending a shiver through him.
He dreaded knowing that Stark would just disappear, not even leaving a body behind, just like Bucky. No closure of seeing them one last time, even if they were just still faces and cold bodies. He jolted out of his thoughts and looked at Thor who was looking at him in dreadful anticipation.
His head felt filled with blurry memories of the stars and the heat of the blast that he knew he had imagined because there was no way he felt it. He felt shivers wrack through his body as he made his way to the couch on shaky legs to sit down before he crashed.
A fresh wave of pain rippled through him as he realised he lost one of his own again. Yes, they met and they clashed and he said some things that he'd never say, misjudging this complex man but still, he was one of Steve's. His team.
Steve could see Natasha gesture something to Tony out of the corner of his eye before she walked away but Tony held on, tightening his fingers and loosening them rhythmically.
Tony broke away, whispering again as his eyes burnt, "Can you also draw me a cosmos?" Steve gave a shaky laugh as he pecked Tony's lip sweetly again, "I'll draw you anything you want, sweetheart. Forever."
"Which one is the good part? Me not being pregnant?", Tony nudged her as she smacked his hand away. He could sense that something was nagging her. "Okay. What are you worrying over? Bucky's gonna die in happiness."
of Thor taking Loki and the sceptre and the tesseract back to Asgard, they all finally escaped to the Shawarma joint.
Tony, somehow that night, didn't have it in him to move his eyes away even for a second, reluctant of missing out on anything. His eyes had been trained on the Captain, decked in his military regalia, happily mixing with the people. Steve was comfortable here, more than he had ever been at the other galas.
Steve chuckled lightly when he heard the grumble from Tony as Peter crawled over him. The blond kissed the boy's face and ruffled his hair.
we discuss potential enemies Mr. Wilson may have had," Tony answered, running a hand through his hair, "Now, Samuel, may I call you Samuel? Please, tell me your story."
He grinned, giving Steve a look.
“We know ya will, Cap. Really don’t think you honestly have to worry about control. You’re fairly good with it as a person. I can imagine you’re the same as a wolf, especially if you recognize us in that form too.” Sam explained, giving Steve a warm grin. “You can do that, right? Don’t wolves do that by smell and stuff?”
"Ah--! Damn it..." He said under his breath with a small wince, waiting to adjust to the feeling. Once he did, Steve rocked his hips down onto Tony's fingers.
He kept on naming different sea creatures, kicking his legs excitedly as he was strapped in.
"Or lack thereof," Clint piped up.
"Mmm."
"Suction? Holy shit. I didn't
Peter started to run over to Tony, the man's clothes on the boy. The pant legs dragged and the sleeves flopped around as Peter stopped in front of him.
He took a breath, feeling slightly exhausted from even
"Sammy, don' look ah'me like dat," Peter whined, "I don' want m'fingies chewed."
"And after cake, back to the drinks?" Bucky asked, plucking a piece of cake up for himself.
time since I had a place t'call home."
"We pray all these things in your name, am--"
"I so hit jackpot," he whispered, a stupid grin plastered on his face.
"You're gonna be the death of me, Rogers," Tony grunted, "Gonna have to teach that mouth of yours to behave."
"Well I'm not letting them stay home alone, either. What're you talking about?" Steve laughed, kissing Tony's collarbone chastely. "I'll be the one to embarrass him by showing the girlfriend or boyfriend the baby pictures."
Steve nodded his response. Tony smirked at him as he was leaving.
Steve sighed happily at the thought, snuggling Tony closer. "Mm, all the talk about it is going to make me want to go now." He hummed. "I can't wait."
Crumbs spewed all over the floor, causing Tony to sigh.
"I can go get you a warm blanket and get you covered. I'm sorta wide awake now." He said softly. "I could let you sleep a little longer and I can go finish up on the mural and start cleaning a bit? Make some coffee for when you're up?"
He snickered to himself and dodged Steve's smack, sticking out his tongue playfully.
"I fink Daddy wuz up weal wate wast nigh'," Peter started, kicking his tiny feet against the chair, "He wooked weally schweepy."
Tony carried him downstairs, setting him down in his usual chair before kissing his cheek, moving to help Steve make dinner.
Steve gave a warm chuckle at that, grinning playfully back. "That is a
The blond stared back dazed, face burning from the attentions. He moved slightly underneath Tony, leaning up only just, almost ghosting his lips against the other's.
The genius looked over at the sketchbook carefully, taking in the sight of the sketches carefully because wow. They did look like a lot of care was taken in drawing them. They were all just small moments that could happen in his day; him drinking coffee before he can function in the morning, working on something in the lab with smudges of most likely grease on his face, and some close ups of his face, eyes, and hands. They looked fantastic. Flattering. And he had never saw Steve sketching him.
"He... He doesn't need a hospital. He wouldn't willingly go to one, anyway." Steve murmured, holding Tony close to him. "But I think Buck went about it all right. At least, that’s what I'm getting from you?" He asked, looking to his husband.
Peter rolled his eyes but walked over to Steve anyway, looking more bored than resentful.
He knew the words would fly over the boy's head, but he kissed Peter's temple anyway, clinging to the boy.
Steve walked close to Tony under the spray, wrapping arms around his waist and scrubbed gently to clean him up.
When he walked into the house, it was eerily quiet. He wasn't used to it being
The last word came out spitefully.
"Yaaaay! Pizza!" Peter cheered, looking to Clint. "Go get it, Unca Clint! Go go go go go!"
"Oh yeah, you know something? Yeah, I may have a thing for this guy. But you probably had no reason of worrying about this whole situation. I'm pretty confident the guy is as straight as a ramp.". He yanked the door open and made sure to slam it as hard as he possibly could.
"Steve--" Tony whimpered quietly, biting his lip to keep from moaning "--we can't, not with the kids upstairs, even if they are asleep." He thumped his head against Steve's chest pitifully, mumbling apologies into his shirt.
"Well, if that true, your partner still has quite a few more moves to show you." The genius said with his signature Stark smirk, toying a bit with blond locks. "That could go well into the night, one way or the other.".
Down in the lab, Tony cursed at the top of his lungs, fingers underneath the lab sink as he washed off the burn. He let his concentration slip for
"Well, it’s either let me take care of you or not complain." Steve explained, kissing Tony's lips quickly. "It’s your choice, babe."
"Just relax and let go, Tony. Come when you feel you're gonna." He moaned, knowing he wouldn't last much longer himself. "This is about you. You feeling good, baby.
He grinned, lacing their fingers together. Steve grinned back at him, giving Tony's hand a squeeze.
Metal Arm continued to glare, whispering over to Red.
"We might take you up on that, Stark," Clint whistled, pulling Bucky and Nat to his sides, "You best keep the black lights away, though."
Once he was alone for a few minutes, Steve grabbed his paper pad and pencils as he padded to the living room. He settled himself on the couch under one of the throw blankets Tony had around and got comfortable. He has never drawn or really written anything before, so he made a few tests on the paper to see what to actually do. Once he started to see marks being made, Steve grinned. It was actually kind of fun just making nonsense shapes with the graphite on the paper. He continued this a while before he finally asked JARVIS if he could start playing a movie on the list.
"Now, are you gonna get too excited when your aunts and uncles get here? Because we can get your spare pull ups out if you need them," he murmured.
The note read simply this;
Steve hummed back, shutting his eyes.
"I never got up that early for Christmas," Tony shrugged, leaning into Steve before breaking off to grab his pajamas, "It was... Not a good holiday for little-me."
Tony got his velcro sneaks off, then undid the button, turning to shut the water off while Peter finished undressing.
Steve hummed at the touch, leaning with it and wrapping his arms around Tony's waist.
Steve nodded softly, bouncing the baby in his arms. "No, you're right. They should get to see them. And they're just a block away. They'll... They'll be okay. And we could use just a little us time, right?"
Tony turned his head at the sound of the door creaking, not surprised to see Steve snap a picture.
and I can't--"
The blond stepped inside slowly, shutting the door behind him. He looked around, taking in the apartment. It was a little messy, from what he assumed to be from work, but that was normal around here. People creating get messy.
"Well, a couple things. I gotta find it though," Tony hummed, carefully sitting up with a groan, "Oh god, I'm going to be so fucking
"It'll be okay. It’s not like anyone will know, hon. It’s okay. Not the end of the world."
"I couldn't tell you, baby." Steve said with a forced chuckle. "Do you think we should take you to the hospital, though? Might've tore something..."
"Mmm, been keeping some saved up until I'm officially your fella?" He smirked back happily.
"Yeah, no tummy aches munchkin. That wouldn't be good." Steve agreed, taking a careful bite of the cookie and enjoying the taste. It was his mom's recipe, and the taste always reminded him of Christmases as a kid. "Enjoy your cookies, Petey."
"He'll learn. He isn't at the average age yet for talking, so this much is great." The blond explained, carefully cuddling Tony.
Steve smirked at that, starting to piece the bed together. "Trust me, there are no facets of my life where I am a slowpoke, you. Nor do I choose to rush anything." He hummed, lining up the drill. "Thanks for the boost though, Buck." He chuckled warmly.
"Now, do you have
"I'll have to ask Tony about it." Steve said with a hand over his face. "He's planning something, so I have no clue."
He pressed a kiss to Peter's cheek before letting the water drain, picking him up out of the water to dry him off with a fluffy towel.
"All right, come here Super Peter." Steve said as he knelt, helping slip on the clothes. "Undies, pants, and then shirt. Got it?"
Steve took his with an amused smile, admiring how Peter had tried to wrap the gifts. He had a bit of practice to do, but it wasn't all too bad. He opened his present to find a small box of Hershey Kisses and Hugs along with a small drawing Peter had made.
The blond sighed, shaking his head. "I guess the baby is done with his nap..."
"Besides, we'll lock the door, and come up with excuses like... Moving furniture."
Tony gently moved the shriveled intestines aside, running his fingers over the back vertebrae.
Sam nodded.
"Ah ah, you don't have enough teeth, little one," Tony murmured, pushing his plate out of Sammy's reach, "Sorry, love."
“Y-yeah--" Tony threw his head back and gasped, slowly jerking himself off in tempo to Steve's thrusts.
"There's more if you want there to be?" Tony replied in a question, voice still staying surprisingly smooth. "I'd like to show you all different things humans do, including how our relationships work. If you want, that is. And we could take our time unlike the movie. We've got all summer, right?"
"Too hot? Too cold?" Tony asked, pouring a little bubble bath under the faucet.
Steve's breath almost hitched hearing the greeting. Was this guy...
"But m'
"Daddyyyy," Peter whined, causing Sammy to whine too.
"More, please," he begged.
"Just take your time. That's all I ask." Steve hummed, wriggling slightly under Tony. "I want to thoroughly enjoy it, which I know you would do."
He pressed a kiss to Peter's temple and hugged him close, whispering comforts while he held him.
"The squirt was too cute to resist, Steve. He was cuddling that ratty bear for all it was goddamn worth, and my heart-- mm. Tugged on the strings."
Steve kissed back with a happy hum, snuggling Tony close contently.
"Thank you, Rogers. Now, sliced? Please be more specific," Tony continued.
Steve thrust a few more times, feeling Tony clench around him. It didn't take much more before he came with a gasping moan, head resting on Tony's chest as his hips stuttered to ride out the pleasure. Tony clung onto Steve, eyes rolling back in euphoria; he groaned as he felt Steve fill him, breathing his name into his neck.
my mother. Since, like, before we met." He chuckled softly.
He let Steve sink down completely, keeping his hands on the other's hips.
"Fuck," Tony panted, putting his hands on Steve's chest, "It's been quite a fucking while,
“I really appreciate this again, Bruce. You’re trying the best you can, I know.” Steve assured softly in thanks from the chamber before JARVIS rang through the lab’s speakers.
Tony actually did a
intended."
Tony stood from his place and collected the snack plate from the floor, quickly cleaning up the markers before putting away the dish in the kitchen. He trooped back up to his bedroom, collapsing onto the bed in a tired heap. Steve had already been lying in bed, feeling a Tony plop down onto him.
Tony took his time picking out linens: he was a very picky man, wanting only the best for Steve. He settled on silk sheets and a Victorian bedspread, buying fluffy towels and blankets to store in their home. He left the store with bags of stuff, a happy laugh escaping his throat at the thought of going home to Steve. Once he pulled into their garage, he shouldered the bags, grunting as he trudged upstairs.
"As for your sneakers," he continued, "did you look in your hammock? That where they usually are."
"Mm."
"Ten bucks," Tony said, "Or a blowjob. That counts too."
"We can start just like this; Just some kissing, probably a little making out here on the couch. We'll see how far it goes and what you're comfortable with for now, okay?" Tony supplied, looking Steve straight in the eyes as he did. "Do you trust me?"
Tony grinned, starting to flick open the buttons of Steve's shirt.
Months passed. Peter was pulled from school and started gymnastics, meeting a sweet little girl and a hell of a boy to be his new friends. Nearing the holidays again, Tony's anxiety started to work up, causing him to sleep more often than he'd like.
An hour or so passed in companionable silence, until Peter piped up.
Steve grinned and smooched back, then going to smooch Peter's cheeks. "You're six. You're supposed to think it’s gross." He laughed, wiping flour on Peter's nose.
"Mmm, gross, kissing the baby then me? Germs," Tony made a 'bleh' sound, laughing when Sammy mimicked it. "See? Even
"It's still funny," Tony grinned, turning to look at Steve.
"I... I dunno," Tony shrugged, "I've tried everything, but my need for Howard's approval-- it's too set deep in me. I feel inadequate, and now that he's gone.... I can't ever hope to hear him say he's proud of me. And no matter how much support I have, I--I don't think it compares to that childlike desire."
Peter eyed the mess that was starting to appear on Tony's paper before turning back to his blank sheet. He started to doodle on the page just as Steve headed into the studio.
"Sometimes, Rogers, I wonder if you ever were a doctor," Tony hummed, amused, "Anyway, Mr. Wilson, did you notice anything peculiar about the scene? Before the police arrived?"
He sighed happily, flicking off the tap once it'd filled the tub.
"Come here," he ordered, rolling his eyes at the sheepish boy, "Don't look at me like that, young man. You know what you did. Get over here."
"I didn't say it was during school hours," he purred, "Steve
He pulled away from Steve and crossed his arms, determined to get through the movie without screaming. Or crying. Again.
"Yes, you can get both. You know, you are getting too good at that face. I taught you well." Steve smiled, taking the bandaids and the boy's hand.
"You can say that again," Tony murmured, reaching over with a shaky hand to lace their fingers together, "I wish we could do that more often. Like when we first met..."
He trailed off, holding back on how badly he wanted to continue to roll his hips down against the other's.
Steve gave him a sympathetic smile before heading downstairs to make the soup. He came a few minutes later back up with the soup, some juice, and crackers, setting the tray on Tony's nightstand.
He didn't care that the carpet or Steve or he himself was wet.
Tony held back a sniffle and slowly got Steve's belt off his jeans, handing it to him before standing awkwardly at the side of the bed, not moving towards his lap.
Tony smirked at that, pushing the spectacles back up his nose.
surprised to hear a knock on the door. He never had visitors. Like, ever.
"But finding that missing piece helps. And does wonders, Tones." Clint pointed out. "Being completely open to your soulmate is such a help and comfort. It’s the best first step.".
"Hey, he was just as fond over you, little one, no noises," Tony tsked, hefting Peter up on his hip as he rang the bell.
"It'll get sorted out. Just relax." Steve soothed, settling Tony in the bed. "Get rest and you can sort it all out tomorrow, okay? It’s not going anywhere. Take your time."
Steve looked up to Tony with a thankful smile, leaning in to place a small kiss on the human's lips as Tony had their first meeting.
"Papa likes those kissies." Steve breathed, a dopey smile on his lips.
"To--Tony--Not gonna last much--
"Oh god, squish," Tony gasped, kissing him back, "Squishing me, big guy--"
Steve pulled out the cookies and set them out on cooling racks, sprinkling sugar lightly on the top of them before heading back to the living room.
He sighed and rubbed his face, moving to grab soft clothes.
"I love you too." He whispered back, taking his husband's hand in his. "I can't believe you got him to laugh."
"Then I assume you want us to help warm you up, buddy?" Steve hummed softly, helping the boy up onto the bed. "We can do that, I think."
He made grabby hands for his markers, whining slightly.
"Yep. The good ol' Bearcat dorms. Although I don't actually play sports, I'm a 'team spirit' kind of guy.".
"Been a long time," Tony groaned, relaxing under the pressure, "Too damn long." He moaned loud and unashamedly, loosening under Steve's hands.
"I have a beard, I know what it's like," Tony laughed, reaching over to help Peter cut up his shrimp, "It's not that bad once you get it to a good trimming length. Just gotta wait it out."
"Kay." Peter hummed back, bouncing in his seat as they stopped and parked. "I'mma try and stay though cuz I wanna see lil brotha!"
tell you," Tony muttered, chewing on his lip, "I promised I wouldn't."
"Don't worry, I did my henning on the way here." Steve replied, glancing around the dwelling.
Wrapped in a big fluffy robe, Peter unlocked his door, holding his play-pretend coffee mug as he looked up at Steve, too much like Tony.
"It perfectly fine. Bruce said he was cool with it, and another person makes better free-for-alls."
The blond adjusted slightly without waking Peter for the moment so he wouldn't roll over on him in his sleep. Once settled, he joined his boys in slumber.
"Yeah, I'm sure that's what it is. He's 'partied out'." Bucky smirked behind a glass of milk.
"Mmhm," Tony moaned, bucking back against Steve's finger, "Please, baby. Need you--been too long."
Peter nodded softly at the proposition, snuggling into Tony's chest as he sat in his lap.
He headed downstairs to answer the phone, clearing his throat beforehand.
Tony didn't offer a reply, instead snoring quietly, as he'd fallen asleep. Peter rolled his eyes at his Dad, laying down next to Sammy to cuddle up to him.
Steve sputtered a bit as he tried to think. He was happy they were wanting to decide to adopt, but he wasn't sure about handing Sammy over just yet.
"Always." Steve replied. He motioned for Tony to come inside.
'Tony, it'll be okay, I promise. Just go out to your meeting and do what you need to do.' Steve answered with a reassuring smile 'Stressing yourself out over menial stuff beforehand won't help you out during.'
. Steve went up the stairs quietly, keeping an ear out for his husband.
since we've been real careful about sex around Pete."
"That's your Daddy, little bit. He's real nice, trust me. And he loves you lots, even though he just met you." Steve said to the baby sweetly, watching him gurgle back a bit. He started getting a bit misty eyed, watching Tony hold their baby. It was one of the best things he'd seen.
"Waaaaaarm," Tony moaned, ducking his head into Steve's neck.
He grinned, delicately slipping them down Steve's legs.
Steve was about to state something as he was opening the dorm door, but was interrupted by an arrow flying past his head and into the door across the hall. Tony stared wide-eyed at the arrow and Steve just groaned inside at the other person in their dorm room. The other person was chuckling uncontrollably.
"I aim to please." He chuckled, kissing Tony's cheek and tracing shapes on the other's chest.
He grinned and slipped a second finger in, easily scissoring Steve open. Steve moaned softly in pleasure as Tony worked him open.
Peter pouted, but he kept his thoughts to himself, scooting up close to Steve's side.
He put Peter down on his stomach and laid down next to him, starting to hand-write the algorithm for the new Starkphone update.
"Yeah--"
"Merry Christmas, little spider." The redhead greeted, booping Peter's nose with hers as she ignored Clint's complaining and Bucky's scolding of him.
"Sometimes I have good reason to worry, though." Steve said with a sigh, mixing up the batter. "Your dad gets hurt a lot without even trying, to be honest."
"I'm flattered. Really." Steve answered, most likely grinning like an idiot. He never had so much attention in his life, he didn't know what to do with it.
"I'll see you in a bit, hon."
Tony rolled his eyes at that, sipping at his coffee.
He took a breath, letting himself relax in Steve's arms.
"Hey babe," Tony grinned, slowly spinning around in his chair, "I've been waitin' for you."
. I am not the good husband that Steve deserves, and like
Steve rolled his eyes and walked over to take Tony's hand in his.
Tony slipped his hand back up Steve's shirt again, gently rubbing the place he'd pinched earlier. He rested his head on Steve's chest, nuzzling into his side.
Tony bobbed his head as he mumbled to himself, re-lighting his pipe to take another puff. As a second thought, he picked up the crossword, raising an eyebrow at the answers.
"Big boy's go to bed on time," Tony pointed out, glancing at his watch, "You've got about five minutes till lights out, young man."
make me feel good. What do
Tony swallowed nervously, but kept his steely composure.
"...I don't even know what those are." Steve shrugged. "But you apparently do, if your reaction was anything to go by."
"What--" Tony started, happily taken aback by the sight of Steve before him dressed like a chef in a cute little apron and mitts like it was the most normal thing ever. "What are you doing, Steve? I smelled burning fish and--
"That's something I can be useful for. I can get things down from high places." He chuckled softly, kissing Tony's cheek.
"I know, I know," Tony soothed, grabbing the lube again to slick himself up.
"Going off to build more of those useless bots--"
"Peter, you nearly fell asleep on both your father and I not a half hour ago," Tony hummed, "You might be smart, but I'm just a bit smarter than you."
"Why not? It’s not old at all." Steve answered him with a chuckle. "If you're old, then we are all
"Hmm, then I have my work cut out for me, no doubt." He hummed working out knots and leaving soothing kisses in each spot he finished with.
"And I'm pretty sure that's heavily exaggerated." Steve answered, hiding his face in his hand for the moment in embarrassment. He was pretty sure he heard someone giggle from down the aisle at that.
"You can tell me to be patient later. Right now, I'm in charge," Tony grumbled, dragging Steve in and shutting the door behind him, "Clothes off. Chop chop."
"So pushy." Steve joked lightly, kissing Tony sweetly before they settled under the covers. "I had to get my mistletoe kiss in somehow." He smiled, nuzzling Tony's hair as the blond shut his eyes. "Love you."
Tony blinked at Steve.
Steve pulled Peter back to look at him, working his own set of puppy eyes on the boy.
Steve looked at Peter with a raised brow. "You aren't worried." He noticed, seeing Peter's grin as the boy shook his head.
Tony put his hand on his chest and gasped, faux guilt on his face.
"That's good," Tony murmured, waiting for Steve's cock to swell a little more before removing the cockring.
TW: reference to previous self-harm, talks of divorce
"Alright, first, we need to look up materials for the costume," Tony began, drawing up a holographic screen, "Jay, bring up material types that are flexible and lightweight, but also fairly sturdy and safe."
"You look pretty," Tony murmured, tugging on it a little, "But--hmm." He took it off Steve's neck and clipped his around his own, tightening it. He sighed happily, giving himself only two fingers worth of room; turning to Steve, Tony smirked, shrugging. "Whaddya think? You or me?"
Tony pulled lube out of one of the desk drawers, coating his fingers before circling around Steve's entrance, easily pushing two in up to the knuckle.
The brunette looked at the blonde nervously, afraid of what Steve possibly meant by 'choices'. Sensing the question look, Steve clarified his statement.
do you plan to do with it?" Steve pointed out, censoring himself because of Peter being present. "It’s quite extensive work for it just to be a cosplay or something, especially when you are trying to
"All right. If the boss boy says so. I'll take a nap." He sighed playfully. "You guys be good. Or else."
Tony whined, gasping softly when Steve pulled out.
"No one gets to treat you like that," Tony muttered, wrapping his arms around Steve's neck, "Unless you want me to. Carry me?"
"What if I
He turned back to Peter to carefully undress him, wary of the band-aids on him from the IV point.
"Sorry, baby. Just don't want to hurt you like the other time." He murmured, lining himself up.
Piqued, Tony turned his head fifteen degrees toward his guests, raising an eyebrow.
Steve reached over and buckled him in, starting the car and driving them home. It was quiet without Tony's voice or the radio playing, so Steve tried to break the silence.
After a little while, Steve started to get a little antsy, needing to move around a bit. His soreness was more or less tolerable now, so he decided to get up and do some things. He carefully unwrapped himself from Tony to let him sleep, heading off to start with a shower.
He grinned, shaking the said box in his hands before putting it down.
"So good, love. Such a good
"Daddy likes wobots," Peter announced, holding up the box to Steve.
"I didn't want you t'worry, you worry enough about me," he murmured against Steve's lips.
"You can say that again," Tony grumbled, defensive mechanisms starting to take over, "Of course. It's not even about the stitches, is it? It's the goddamn fact of what you know about me and you don't--
"Anything and everything that involves panties," Tony purred, flipping himself on top of Steve, "Pretty please, officer."
Steve sighed a soft breath, looking to their hands. "I just miss my ma, is all." He said quietly. "With the accident of your's and helping you deal with that, and then...some of the ways you treat me when we're just relaxed... I just get reminded of her more and more." He shook his head softly. "I'll be fine soon, though. It'll pass. So don't worry about it, okay?"
"Tony, what are you still doing down here?".
. It was taking a large part of his willpower to listen and basically go against his body's instincts to pleasure. Because damn, it felt
"Loving seeing you all needy like this, Stevie. You boyfriend probably does too," He continued, slipping a finger inside Steve, "I bet he's fucked you under the bleachers, in the janitor's closet--"
Tony bit his lip and nodded, running his hands up and down Steve's arms.
," Tony huffed, "Steve, I'd rather you groan at me than bleed everywhere." He slouched slightly, looking pretty pitiful.
"Daddy would ‘preciate it," he muttered, "He likes m’art."
Tony blinked and shook his head, but he laughed, doing as Peter asked. The boy ran off to find Steve, grinning when he found him waiting with a bow.
"Y'always know what ta do." he whispered happily, eyes becoming half-lidded.
They didn't leave him. The nightmares only got worse. It was the same one, reoccurring every other night and increasing in sense of terror. Every time he awoke from the nightmare he would have a slight panic attack, and every time the real  Steve would come in to comfort him. After Tony would settle down, Steve would hesitantly leave him to his own devices, just like Tony had asked. Tony thought that would help, but it only made things worse on him.
"He was drowning, Peg. Right in front of me. Now, human or not, I am supposed to help and protect people that I see in need. And regardless of that being my job, that is just how I react in those situation anyways. You of all people know that.".
"Well, yeah. It came up with the soulmate discussion. It was sort of my proof." Steve explained softly, kissing the tip of Tony's nose. "C'mon, time to eat and hang out a little before Peter has to go to bed."
Tony bit his lip and shrugged.
"You've got him wrapped around your little finger, don't you?" Tony chuckled, scooping Peter up.
The young man decided to walk around on the beach, contemplating on what he had saw. For some reason, figment or no, that man just wouldn't leave his mind.
"I promise I am not a siren. Those give us folk a bad rap, leading humans to their doom for fun." Steve assured, a bashful smirk on his lips as he tried to catch his breath. "Just-- please keep touching me like this? Feels good. Feels like when you had touched my scales to see if they were real."
Tony didn't look back at Steve and spoke quietly.
Steve smiled over at him. "It is you." He chuckled warmly. "I draw Daddy lots, so I figured I'd add a picture of my little fella too.".
"No problem, munchkin." Steve grinned, kissing Peter's forehead. "Go hide it by the back of the tree so Daddy doesn't find it until tomorrow, okay?" He whispered, watching the boy run behind the tree.
"No cherry for me, though," he added, scooting down into the warmth of the hoodie, "And get Pete a little strawberry one. He's been good lately."
"Oh my god, Steve," Tony snorted "Let the poor boy sleep, it's way past his bedtime."
"He is like your mini clone. If I could handle you by myself, we can handle this one together." Steve pointed out with a shrug. "Let’s just enjoy right now while he's adorable."
"Not my eggs, specifically. I don't produce eggs. I'm male too. But yes, technically that is what fertilizes. Just a different process than what you all do." Tony explained, waving his hand as he spoke. "We'll discuss the human process for it, uh, later. Sound good? Good. Now lets get your shirt off and get you cleaned up--."
"Choke it down, babe. You'll get used to the burn. Another?" Tony grinned at the cheers, pouring another round. "One, two, three!"
"Right," Tony hummed back with a smile, smooching Steve's cheek, "They'll be back in no time, and you can make a cuddle nest to hen over. Okay?"
"You're cleaning that up, Steve, you gave him the cookie," he tutted, shaking his head, "And you, little man, better eat your dinner."
"It's--It's just super embarrassing," he muttered, feeling his cheeks flare up, "I'm supposed to be some ladies’ man and I've
Pacing in the room, Tony had already started rattling off the Fibonacci sequence out of anxiety, nearly jumping out of his skin at the hand on his back.
"Thanks, Tasha," Tony replied miserably, tugging both of them down so he could lay across their laps, "I don't even know what to feel now. It's all--it's moving really fast, even for me."
"I don't think I could tell you everything you make me feel, love. It's...It's something I can't describe," he murmured.
"When we do that, the goal is to make you feel good. And that didn't wind up happening." He said softly.
"Yeah!" Peter said enthusiastically. "I love going to Uncle Buck and Auntie Natasha's! Uncle Bucky always lets me check out his arm and put magnets on it and Auntie Natasha always bake real good!"
"Okay, you take the silver paint and paint my tattoo onto my silhouette, and I'll take the gold and paint yours."
ANYWHO! This chapter took a bit longer because it itself is a bit longer. I am honestly making this all up as I go along with a couple set points in my mind, so I am cranking them out as I write 'em (heh- heh (ｰ ｰ;) )
"We should teach Peter Irish," Tony murmured, a bit dazed, "And Italian--"
"Tatii here is going to give ya a nice wash and cut for your hair while I go looking through and picking out some outfits for ya." Raavi explained, winking before scurrying off towards another area of the salon.
"Not a chance." Steve told him, smooching the boy's cheek with a grin. "But it is winter break, so you get a break from homework for a while, okay munchkin?"
Steve just wanted to hold the man, wanted to be able to keep him together and whole. He slowly reached out to wrap his arms around Tony, holding and comforting him as the dark haired man lightly shuddered in his hold.
"Honey, don't worry."
"Thank you, Steve," he murmured again, "I love it."
Steve smiled back at him happily, giving Tony's hand a small squeeze.
"Mmm... I think I'd like to have you inside, if you don't mind that." He offered at a whisper. "Love when you're in me. Feels so good."
Tony nodded sleepily, making a tiny affirmative noise. Once he let his eyes close, he fell asleep within seconds.
"Okay, Okay. Let's go, munchkin." Steve murmured, hefting Peter to his room. He started to tuck the boy into his bed, brushing his bangs out of his face.
When he answered the door, two gentlemen completely rushed in in a tizzy before they were welcomed in.
IT LIVES!
"I know baby, I know. I wish I could bring her back to you. I wish I could, baby." He sniffled, kissing at his neck. He tried to send Tony some happy thoughts, memories to try and help cheer him up a bit, in any way possible.
As soon as Tony was out of earshot, Peter rushed over to Steve, beckoning him to come closer.
"Whoa now, Peter. That is no way to act. We never meant any trouble by it, baby bear." Steve explained softly, standing up with a sigh. He looked over at Tony with a shrug. "I was just trying to help."
He helped Steve lie down on his back, immediately tucking him in under the sheets while he came down from his high.
"If he's not too busy still sleeping, that is." Bucky chimed, but ultimately agreed. "We'll catch you lovebirds later. Or, y'know, whenever you decide to leave the bedroom."
Peter nodded and let Steve pull back the covers, snuggling down into his bed so Steve could tuck him in.
noise come up, their knocking is startling the dandelions," Tony Stark sighed, looking up at Steve from his place, upside down in his armchair, "And make sure you hang up their coats. I don't want the Southern dust on my hardwood floors."
TW: talk of babies, talk of self-worthlessness
"Peter, I'm sorry bubba. I'm trying, I really am. I don't ever to feel like you are being ignored or anything, baby boy." He said softly, coming to sit on the bed softly.
Steve huffed a laugh softly. "After the holidays. They are for family. So... Maybe around New Years?" Steve offered quietly, kissing behind Tony's ear.
Steve hummed sweetly. "You are going to spoil me, I swear." He chuckled, petting Tony's hair. "Spoil me rotten..."
"Just going to get a wash cloth to clean us up, don't worry." Tony assured with a soft pat to Steve's leg. "When it dries, it gets a little gross and uncomfortable. Plus we should at least get underpants back on. Give us a bit of coverage."
"So about that spanking me thing, definitely think we should take care of that first," he muttered, "Then have fun sexy times."
"You're okay," Tony soothed.
Tony sighed softly, leaning down to smooch Steve's forehead.
Tony bit his lip, looking up at Steve. "I think so."
"So it was you!"
With careful steps, Steve walked over towards the man, giving Tony a curious look as he clipped the device around his neck.
He started to run off, turning to yell at the blond. "And I'll definitely be back to see you, handsome!"
He looked back at Steve. The captain had a deep look of disgust on his face as he glared at Tony. Something was up. Steve never glared at any of his teammates like that. Well, he did when he first met Tony, but he didn't do it anymore. They had come to a mutual friendship. So this was abnormal.
"We're going to take you back to bed, okay Pete? You need your rest, sweetheart." He pointed out.
Tony nodded silently, watching Steve's hand slide down his stomach. He whined softly, barely restraining the urge to buck up into his touch.
home, turning off the car and wiping away the last of the dried, happy-tear tracks.
"Hey... Tony, are you okay? What’s the matter?" He asked softly.
"Y'so good f'me, Steve," he groaned, pressing kisses up the blond's spine, "Y'so fuckin'
baby," Tony grinned, only quieting himself when Peter stirred.
"A-ahh, Steve," Tony moaned against the desk, vision going white from the heavy stimulation, "Baby, not gon' last much, fuck--" He kept it together for a few more thrusts before he came, screaming Steve Steve Steve over and over again.
"Then I wouldn't be able to move. I was frozen by the cold, and you would grab the reactor and yank it out of my chest. And then I would fall, unable to do anything but look up and see you crush the reactor as if it was nothing and walk away with such a shit-eating grin on your lips...".
"Yeah honey, little Samuel Carter," Tony mused, reaching back to squeeze Steve's hand, "We get to take him home tomorrow, sweetheart."
"Now remember, we have to sanitize before we go in and stay fairly calm so we don't freak him out, okay?"
"Uh--" Tony started, a flush forming on the back of his neck from what he could feel "I mean, not officially? What we're doing is typical of people dating, so if you want to be dating, we can be. If you want. I'm not going to pressure you."
"Yessir. Sorry." He whined at a whisper, just laying back and letting Tony work as he wanted.
Peter cuddled up to Steve a little closer, chewing on his bottom lip.
Steve packed up into its case the shield that had protected him through so much; that had held his legacy as Captain America for all these years. Once he knew it was settled and knew exactly what it was he wanted to do, he made a call. He called Sam and Bucky, telling them to meet him at the park. Just saying that, they would know where he meant; What he meant. They would know it was important.
"He appwesiates not'in' but his t'ought of perfe'tion." Steve said through the toothbrush in his mouth, spitting out the toothpaste and rinsing quickly, "And those thoughts are ridiculous. It’s only because of the art and the check that I don't go insane."
"I had a tough day, and things had been building, alright? It’s not-- It's not all that big," he muttered miserably, "I got burned really badly, my head wasn't in the game, I let myself get under too much. Felt like I constantly failed everyone, as a parent and a husband and a friend and I was
"Sure, baby. We'll get one on our way out though, okay? We don't want it to get dirty as we walk around, do we?"
"You know it takes a good couple Russian gummy bears to even get me
"The way it sounds, I'm still more of the bride." Steve chuckled softly. "Not that I mind honestly if I was." He hummed at the kisses, petting at Tony's hair and shutting his eyes softly. "There'll be quite a bit to do. Things to plan. But we have plenty of time to worry about it all."
"We might need to wait until Sammy is a bit bigger, Pete." Steve stated with a sigh. "Then we might get a small to medium sized puppy."
Tony smiled thankfully at Steve before peeking at Peter's paper, smooching the boy's cheek.
"You are gonna be terror on two feet when you really start walking, kiddo." Steve hummed, eyeing his two boys as they played.
"I gotcha, baby. I gotcha..." Steve grunted softly as he started to thrust, nice and slow. He held onto Tony's hips gently as he moved, lifting him a bit.
"Thank you," Tony murmured, nudging his head against Steve's.
"That, and its rude to call your father a liar," Tony continued, crossing his legs, "He and I were discussing things about
"Yeah, sounds good," Tony mumbled, nuzzling at Steve's cheek.
Steve was in the middle of setting Sammy down for his nap when he felt a twinge of pain through the bond. It was often, since Tony often burnt his fingers as he worked, so he didn't worry too much.
Steve groaned softly at Tony's touch, wriggling softly.
Clint looked down in thought for the moment when Natasha spoke up.
Steve sighed, fiddling with bits of sand on the ground.
Steve rolled his eyes back in a playful manner as he sat down on the bed, playing along and shutting his eyes.
Once his jumper was on straight and he had his cardigan on, he held his arms up.
It was Tony's turn to glance worriedly at Steve, shrugging. Steve picked up Peter and sat him on his lap.
Tony rolled his eyes and cleaned himself off, efficiently getting himself done before grabbing the clothes he'd grabbed for Peter, going to find the boy.
motorcycle's engine." He grinned softly, turning Tony's way.
He felt Steve pull out, staying down on his elbows. When Steve pulled away, he sat back a bit, leaning on his arms and panting softly as his head still swam.
"Its fine, Tony." He smiled reassuringly. "Think about this; this is how I was at the beginning of you talking about the sex things. You've helped me be used to that. So I will help you be used to the romance-y things."
"He's so smart, but he still is learning basic things for kids his age that he can't learn from a book." Steve said with a soft grin. "It’s really an odd combo, but I wouldn't change it. He perfect as he is."
The blond looked back at him defensively for a moment, then glanced at Tony's chest before speaking softly.
"Papa, what wuz da thing Daddy said other den ten bucks?" Peter asked curiously, Steve's face tinting pink.
"I know, shhh," Tony soothed.
"You're heavy," he laughed, bouncing the boy as he walked up to the artroom.
"What do you mean for you to leave...?".
, among other things. My homework is to make two lists: one of how I perceive myself, and the other of how others see me. So I wanted to knock that second one out of the park, since you guys are all here."
"Rogers, JARVIS could kick SIRI's ass any day of the week.".
"You don't ever have to apologize for crying, Peter. Never ever." Steve said solemnly, kissing the top of Peter's head. "I'm sure your mom and dad thought you were a perfect baby before the fire. I know that you are our perfect baby, even if you aren't a baby anymore."
He made sure the tyke scampered off before going into the kitchen, wrapping his arms around Steve and smooching his shoulder.
"You look pretty strong, gimmie a hand with the couches."
"Is there a name?" The blond stranger asked with a warm smile.
"Honey, I could get a rocket to take us to the moon." Tony bit his lip, a tiny smile on his lips. "I don't wanna move too fast for you," he said quietly.
He hummed softly, giving Steve another kiss before sitting up, trudging to the bathroom to grab a wet rag. Going back to the bedroom, he cleaned Steve off first, tugging a blanket up around him before cleaning himself off. He tossed the rag in the hamper and crawled back into bed, happily curling up into Steve's warmth.
"Sorry." Steve answered softly, loosening his grip up a bit and kissed his face. "Think you'd be good to take your medicine?"
to rather than we
"Yeah we're home, but Peter, baby, you hurt your nose. It’s bleeding." Steve said worriedly, setting their things down and patting Peter's back to let go. "Let’s take care of that, then we can say hi, munchkin, okay?"
"Bastard," Tony gasped again, rolling himself down onto Steve's fingers, "Absolute bastard."
"See? All good," he managed, flopping back down onto the bed.
"Ten across. A five letter word for fearful anticipation." He dictated with a yawn.
Tony squeaked at the smack, burying his embarrassed flush in the comforter.
"Mmhm--” Tony moaned softly, whining at Steve. "Faster, babe," he breathed, back arching.
"We'll take you up on that offer, Stark." Natasha smirked, giving Tony a quick hug. "Be good, kid. You hear me?" She warned playfully. "Good to meet you, Steve. Take care of this one."
Sharon beckoned to Steve and placed a small kiss on his cheek, doing the same for Peter and Tony.
"Yeah. Yes, I do. I really like this. Like how it feels. Like being with you like this." He answered breathily, looking up through his eyelashes at the other. "But I only want more if you want more, too. Do you want this? Whatever this is with us?"
"Do what? I didn’-- oh." Peter saw the paint on Steve's hand, and shrugged.
Steve simply responded by scooping Peter up in one arm, heading over to Tony and pulling him into a hug with them. He smooched both of their faces, mess and all, sputtering out a bit of eggshell after kissing Peter's head but all with a smile.
"You're a real sweetheart," Tony murmured, sitting up in bed so Steve could put the tray on his lap, "You got stuff planned for today, then, I'd assume." He yawned, poking at his food before shoveling it down, happily slurping at his coffee.
good," he slurred.
Tony hummed, slowly slipping his fingers out of Steve. "You're beautiful when you do that. Got such a beautiful color to your face," he mumbled, sitting up slightly.
Tony kept tracing Steve's lips, smirking.
"Yeah honey, it took your brother five hours to come out," Tony sighed, "He's stubborn, just like your Papa."
"Yeah, yeah, it’s your turn munchkin. You were patient. Why don't you start with the small ones and work up to the big ones?" He suggested, that way it lead up to the room in size when they would get to it.
Pete nodded and yawned, smiling softly up at Steve.
Peter gaped, staring at Steve. "Buh
She turned towards Steve's direction, giving him a small wave.
Tony replied to the student, huffing out of breath.
"No problem, hon. I know caffeine is your second love." Steve said with a chuckle, taking a sip of his own cup.
TW: None
"Mhm. Shh. I know, I'm sorry I woke you, Papa needs you," Tony whispered to Peter, "He think you're getting old, pipsqueak."
"How about actual sleep?" Steve offered, covering Tony up with the blanket as well. He hugged the man close and rubbed at his back. "Sleep'll do you good, love."
The blond huffed a laugh at his husband, settling down around him with a wide grin of content.
TW: hospitals, talk of IV injections,
"Okay, you're right, I'm sorry," he muttered, swirling the last of his wine before swallowing it.
"Hmm... I like the sound of that idea." Steve hummed in thought. "You'd think after years, we'd know all of each other's boundaries. I suppose we haven't gotten to test them all in that time."
"Dis room is all mine???" The boy asked, almost disbelievingly, rolling around on the bed.
"Just so you know, Daddy and I were sad because we miss our mommies and daddies. And that they didn't get to meet the wonderful boy you are." He said softly.
Steve opened his eyes again, looking at Tony before leaning down to kiss him tenderly. He caressed his cheeks gently as they kissed, leaving it soft and lingering.
"All right, cutie. We'll head downstairs and get you breakfast." He cooed, carrying the boy in his arms and carefully heading down the stairs.
"Don't worry, baby. We've got plenty for the store, I promise." Steve chuckled, handing over the money and collecting the bounty.
"All right pal, thanks. And don't let her get you too bad." He smirked before ending the call with an excited hum.
Tony shrugged noncommittally, giving Steve a sheepish smile before giving him another kiss, happily trotting down the stairs to the lab. Sitting at his lab table, Tony stretched his fingers before bringing up his latest project. The blond sighed softly, watching Tony as he headed down to work with wistful eyes. He gave himself a stretch then headed out to start on cleaning up around the house for the day.
Sammy babbled at Steve, struggling for a moment before pushing himself up, leaning against the couch till he was sitting upright. He stayed still for a second, but he wobbled and fell back down, only to try and sit up again. Steve watched in surprise with a big grin growing on his lips.
Steve grinned at Tony, kissing the top of his head.
"Yeah, he just might. We'll have to see in the morning." He smiled softly. "Okay, let’s get you tucked in and I can read you a quick Christmas-y story before bed."
"I made one-- one for every spanking I gave him," he muttered, "That's why it bled so much."
When Steve was done fixing up a sandwich for Tony and grabbing his medicine, he say down on the couch beside Tony, setting the goods on the coffee table.
thing."
"Thank you, you little cutie." Steve giggled, blowing Sammy a kiss back. "You'll have to show Daddy when he comes home how you blow kissies, bubba bug."
"No, shush. I didn't mean literally," Tony laughed again, tangling their legs together, "Sleep, bambi. You'll need it." He kissed Steve's lips, nuzzling against his cheek before settling down, easily falling asleep.
"You still had dinner cooking even though it’s after midnight?" Steve asked curiously, getting out of bed slowly and wrapping a blanket around his shoulders.
He smiled down at Steve, leaning over to plop a kiss on his temple.
"You made me feel amazing. So I wanna thank you for that. Is that so wrong?" Steve grinned back happily, feeling sated. He kissed along Tony's face happily. "So thank you for that."
"It’s your turn to talk with Peter, anyway. I'll try to calm Sammy down." He said, shushing the baby gently.
The blond looked at Tony, body loose and a content, dopey grin on his face.
"All right. Back against the wall, head facing the side, and arms apart just a smidge." Steve instructed, helping adjust Tony just a bit. He stepped back to see how it would look before moving to trace the outline with an ebony pencil.
"By all means." She nodded, carefully handing Sammy over.
He laughed again, fiddling with the new weight on his finger.
He just held him steadfast, looking up at Steve.
Peter pouted slightly and looked down, shuffling his feet. "Yes, sir...”
Sorry for a sorta late update! (I guess for me it is? I dunno.)
He put his tongue between his teeth in thought, eyes looking up at the ceiling.
"It is. He was a good brother and a...dear friend to me for many years." The eldest murmured. "It is deeply tragic to us both."
Tony pulled off, kissing his inner thigh.
Tony huffed a sigh and forced himself to relax, melting into Steve's arms. "Okay," he mumbled, taking steady breaths, "If I can handle Clint, I think I can handle being romantic with my husband. Right?"
"No," Tony scolded, "Don't touch yourself. You said it was too soon, so you'll have to wait."
He groaned, a tiny shiver going up his back as pleasure pulsed through his veins.
Peter nodded and sucked on the straw, sadly kicking his feet. Tony sighed and climbed into the passenger seat, reaching over to squeeze Steve's hand. Steve squeezed his hand back as he pulled out of the area and started to drive home.
Peter shivered in his wet clothes, letting Steve strip him and put him in the bath.
Steve swallowed hard, watching Peter move on without so much as a word.
"It’s not that
He waited for Pepper to come over so he could put his face in her stomach, wrapping his arms around her middle.
"Yes, yes, I need to trim, I know, it's pretty bad," Tony admitted, gently putting Sammy on the diaper station to change him, "You wanna watch? You'll have to shave someday, kiddo."
Steve whined again softly, leaning to rut against Tony's leg again in exchange for words.
I can fuck this up. Hopefully," Tony babbled, staring at Steve's hands, "If I do, oh well, I tried. All's fair in love and war-- God, I'm just blubbering on, hold up--"
"I bet that your dad was great guy. At least you know that he actually wanted to come home and see you and your mother.".
"Of course I will. Poor little guy, he acted fine when I took him over earlier. I wonder when it could've hit him so badly?" He said softly.
careless of you, Pete," Tony mumbled, "Understand?"
He kissed his temple, wrapping him up tightly.
"Done!" He proclaimed, capping the marker.
"Want ya to tell me..." He gasped out as Tony started a slow rhythm. "Wanna know what more than that."
He simply laid and quietly settled behind the other until he heard soft snores from the small body pressed against him, trying to process in his mind how they ended up in this position. Tony Stark was curled up against a former merman in bed after they had a round of hand jobs with each other. He had been in weird situations, but this was definitely close to the top of the list.
loudly, giving Steve a look.
"You're okay, lil 'un, I promise," Tony murmured, holding Peter's hand comfortingly, "Not much longer and we can go home and get you all comfortable in your own bed with Wade, alright?"
Tony started to blush slightly, starting to get annoyed.
much embarrassment over this, that it won't matter."
"We'll need to start thinkin' names," Tony murmured, leaning down to smooch Peter's forehead, "For boys
matters to discuss. You still haven't properly apologized to Papa for your behavior this morning."
Steve started to shiver later in his sleep, curling further around Tony to find warmth, but not finding it.
"Oh lord." Steve hummed, eyes raking the body before looking to Natalia. "What is it that you found to call it peculiar?"
Tony scrabbled at his pillow and moaned loud and unashamedly, reaching up to thread his fingers into the hair at the nape of Steve's neck. "Please, please sir, move, I can't take it anymore," He begged again.
"We're very excited, baby. Papa and I are very,
"She brings me gifties," Peter grinned, struggling to get out of his apron.
He pulled Steve up to draw him into a kiss, licking his own taste from the blond's mouth. The blond hummed with want into the kiss, lip slightly pink and swollen from their activity prior. Steve moved his tongue with Tony's, panting gently when they had parted.
eager."
"No one told me I was missing bonding time. What’s up with that?" He joked gently.
"I know you are sorry, buddy. I'm not angry about it, okay? People get cranky when they're tired. Daddy is one of them." He chuckled softly, cutting up Peter's pancakes and eggs before presenting the plate to the boy. He brought over a plastic fork and a glass of juice as well for Peter before sitting down with his own food.
He smiled softly, leaning up to peck Steve on the cheek.
Tony hummed to himself as he watched his boys, wiggling his fingers at Peter till he snuggled up to him. "Did you finish all your homework for tomorrow?" he murmured, petting the boy's hair.
That night, Tony slept with ease. No nightmares or panic attacks to wake him. There was only he and Steve, radiating a  comforting warmth...
He grinned, going over to smooch Steve's cheek.

mouth..." Steve panted out, whining slightly at the loss. His body was slack against the desk, keeping himself standing.
"I don't like cheese," Tony laughed, kissing Steve's cheek, "Thank you, babe."
He leaned down to press kisses on Steve's inner thighs, gently nosing at his cock before taking him into his mouth.
Peter shuffled slightly, shame flaring on his pink cheeks.
"That's why we brought you your toys and pajamas, sweetheart," Tony chuckled, palming the wheel as he turned into the parking complex for the hospital, "And we only live a few minutes away, so if you wanna go sleep in your bed, Uncle Buck'll come pick you up."
"It'll be fine." Steve reassured. "We'll start with simple emotions. Let's see, what sort of things make you happy? Like maybe some happy memories?".
, excellent. Good job, Pete, for thinking to lay on your Papa rather than on the couch."
"I love you too, bambi," Tony murmured, washing the soap out of his hair, "But you're kinda crushing me, since you weigh twice as much, and I'd like to fall into bed with you rather than fall asleep in a cold bathtub."
Tony grabbed Steve's arm, still laughing.
"Yeah, Cindy loo hoo, shush," Tony grumbled, glaring at Clint.
"Very, very smart bud. I'm sure you'll grow up to be a smart guy just like Daddy." Steve praised, a smile in Peter's direction. "And smart guys get pizza for dinner on Fridays."
"I will," Bruce offered, waiting for Tony to sit.
"Hey kiddo, Papa and I are gonna spend some time together in the art room, okay?" Tony hummed, plopping a kiss on Peter's head, "We're working on a big surprise, okay?"
He carefully started to apply the ointment across Tony's chest, shaking his head softly. "This is going to be so scarred no matter what gets done, but we are still going to help what we can."
"Sowwy I scared ya, lil' brotha'." Peter whispered softly, playing gently with tiny fingers.
"M'okay. I'll stay hunkered out here, and Dummy's keepin’ me straight."
, why was he so smitten with this guy?
"Mmm, started when I was six? Seven? You'd have t'ask Clint, he found me one of the first times. When I went too deep, that is." Tony lolled his head towards Steve, tugging his gown back down. "I usually cover them up with professional stage makeup, but since I'm here, they probably showered me and took it off."
He brought it over with cream and sugar, setting in on the coffee table. Tony backed up and curled up into his chair, watching Steve and Peggy chatter away.
on the roof. Then he exploded. Oh my god, that man and his stories! I love them both so much. I was so goddamn relieved though."
Tony kept laughing, his legs wrapping around Steve's waist muttering along the words of
Probably just a second later, Bucky sat down on the couch.
This felt like the horrifyingly calm one, slipping away. He could feel himself dusting away. Shaking. So hard that his bones rattled. He felt cold. And distant. And dead. And he could hear whispers of 'its okay' echoing through him. Increasing slowly as he fell out of himself more.
"I've been sitting here for an hour, wishing you'd just look up on your own and find it. I didn't want to upset DUM-E by ruining his plan.", Steve's voice filled in.
And darkness was certainly not a stranger when she engulfed him.
when Tony's hand squeezed his once before pulling away. Tony's eyes felt like one of those
The tiniest burst of happiness quickly dried away as he realized that Stark was falling. "He's not slowing down.", Thor said, swinging his hammer ready to catch Stark.
"Stop disturbing me. I've been trying to channel my inner Tony Stark all night.", Steve took a deep breath, trying to suppress his grin into a mocking smirk and failing very successfully.
There was a stretch of silence on the other side with an undertone of shaky breaths but he could hear the hurried words clearly, "I love you too. Come back soon." just as a click ending the call sounded back.
Thor turned the suit, ripping away the mask as Steve bent to hear, desperately hoping that Stark was still breathing. Pulling away when he heard nothing, his hand slid on the armor's chest towards the blue light which had gone off. The

Bucky pulled away, holding Tony at arm's length scanning him all over when suddenly Bucky got an armful of Pepper apologising for interrupting but folding herself in his body with her face tucked in the curve of his neck. And that was all Tony saw before he stepped back letting them have comfort in each other's presence.
Also, I am not stupid enough to think that a powerful woman like Pepper will mind her own business when the world rushes to chaos. Especially when it's her family at stake. She's a mama bear.
Nodding off, Natasha was the first to walk out perfectly like she hadn't just fought off an alien army with Clint in tandem who seemed like he could draw an arrow the next second but still was blank faced in exhaustion. They both stopped midway looking at Steve in expectancy.
He shrugged at Steve, his heart-eyes probably evident as Steve bent him backwards kissing him until Tony's eyes shut close, his body went lax and his toes curled.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony also suspected the event being focused on this particular cause because some certain redhead was eavesdropping when that happened. There were numerous people who had survived the war or their children and grandchildren surrounding him when the redhead dropped in beside him.
genius and dizzy
"Try Ms.Potts. Might as well.", Tony interrupted in a haste, watching Pepper's photo pop in the corner of his HUD.
Tony wanted to snort and poke fun at Bucky but he knew better than to interrupt their moment. He just happens to be the third wheel, every fucking time, including the time his best friend tells her man, who is his other best friend, about them making
Thor took off Thor-knows-where but Dr. Banner, Clint, Tony and Natasha stayed back. After a horrifyingly slow pile up in the car and the slow lulling movements of driving them back to the safehouse assigned, which drove them half-asleep, it took quite possibly what felt like a decade to reach there.
"I don't have it in me to reprimand you right now. Can we just all curl up in a place together and never get up? Or atleast get up when I remember everything I wanted to pummel you over?" Bucky mumbled as Tony nodded feeling the vibrations where his head was resting near the supersoldier's throat.
He could hear Pepper let out small whimpers, letting her lose herself completely because she knew Bucky would take care of her without a doubt. He walked back to the mini bar getting himself a drink as the exhaustion hit him like a freight train.
Pepper gave him a mocking smile as she took off towards the private elevator leaving Tony to traipse behind her like a lost duckling. He turned back to see Happy in assurance but the man all but shooed him away muttering about how he needed to check up on some woman's kid.
"And then shawarma after.", came Tony's voice. And if his smile slipped back on his face again, no one had to know.
He felt far from chaotic. He had imagined what death would be like after some close calls; he had imagined it to be chaotic and all-fighting because that would be how Tony Stark would go. He had never imagined a calm death or for-fucks-sake a content death because it felt foolish to dream of it.
Steve pressed a kiss on Tony's forehead, digging his fingers a little deeper where they held Tony's waist absentmindedly, "Sure Tony, keep going."
"Thank you.", Tasha said, handing him a sweet drink as she took the whiskey away from his line of vision. She was scarily intuitive but Tony was grateful for that.
With a nod, they both walked out casually as Steve slipped the phone in one of the subtle pockets in his suit, patting it in assurance. The slight eye contact between Natasha and Tony didn't go unnoticed by Steve and, as it seemed, Barton.
'Je vois la vie en rose' indirectly means 'seeing life through rose coloured glasses'.
Learning how far the tech had progressed still shook him. Maybe that was also one of the best things of this century.
It hadn't been easy to open up when Tony despised the thought of just opening his mouth and not blab his usual masks to a shrink. He didn't think he knew how to do that, open up that is.
"I want to hang it besides the '
She looked up at him with a wet laugh which sounded more miserable, "How many times? Do you even have the slightest idea how scared I was? Just watching the news of aliens on the top of our building I panicked so hard that JARVIS had to call James and god, if it wasn't for him. I just wish that that man didn't watch you fly that nuke into that hellhole himself because I did and I'm going to get a fuck-ton of nightmares over this."
"Shh, no more talk about it while the bear is present," Tony smiled softly, nuzzling at Steve's chest.
"Papa doesn't wear booty shorts," he stated flatly, startled by Tony's bust of laughter.
"Where is Mr. Stark?!" The eldest looking had questioned. "We need his assistance. It is absolutely awful!"
"Yeah, but I'm happy he did. He's an amazing husband and father." Steve hummed. "I could care less about all the scandals and rumors with him. I know the man he really is and I could care less what other people say about it." He said adamantly. "And I'll always tell Tony how good I know he is, whether he believes it or not. At least he'll know somebody believes it."
"Your eyes aren't even open, how could you know munchkin?" Steve chuckled lightly, smooching the top of Peter's head. "Plus it’s under you, not in front of you."
Steve worked to dry the boy's hair and his arms, leaving Peter to finish the rest.
Sammy eyed the marker in Peter's hand, reaching with a grabby hand for it with a small noise.
"Just need you both to go through these." She whispered, not wanting to wake Peter.
"M'feelin' just a little under the weather, pipsqueak, nothin' to worry about," Tony soothed, drawing the blanket up to his chin, "I think I caught a small bug from the hospital."
Steve grinned, nuzzling into Tony's hair sweetly. "I'd hope so. You
yes. And hopefully we will be doing much more--?" He purred in question, kissing Tony teasingly before they headed into the house.
Tony rolled his eyes and opened his mouth slightly, only to nip on Steve's tongue.
"I'm not a cat, Steve, y'don't have to give him a litterbox for me," Tony muttered, turning over in bed to face the wall.
He groaned dramatically, completely leaning his weight on the blond.
"Love you. Love you, love you, love love you--" Steve grinned wide and content, flopping slightly over Tony and kissing at skin tenderly.
TW: None
Peter giggled at that, giving Steve a grin.
Tony laughed, shaking his head fondly as he wiped down the counters.
“Not much, honestly.” Bruce answered with a thoughtful hum “Until we get more data the next couple of times he shifts, there really isn’t any patterns to look into. All this info is giving me is that he was exhausted after the change and honestly slept like a rock because of his body trying to fight with the pain.”
"M'hungry," Peter replied through a full mouth, wiping his sticky hands on the napkin.
don't appreciate it." Peter just grinned and wiggled his backside, squealing when Tony sat up and started to tickle him. "That's what you get, you little monster!" he laughed.
"Strip, then come here," he ordered gently, patting the bed beside him, "On all fours."
"You're very welcome."
"Honey, I can show you the definition of pain." Tony grinned, leaning up to smooch Steve's jaw, "We'll do some pain tomorrow. After you're all rested up. Or tonight."
"Oh, mine! Well, it’s um--" he cut himself off, trying to pull his shirt down just enough to show the tattoo on his left pec without getting out of uniform.
"Uh huh, we can gets you a manta ray," Peter giggled, holding tight to Steve's hand, "Cause they'd real gentle cweachas."
He bust out into more laughter anyway, accidentally snorting in his glee.
"Ah heard dat!" Peter yelled from the other room, "I wan
Steve nodded softly into Tony's skin, leaving a gentle kiss.
Omigosh, I am sorry this chapter took FOREVER to get out. College has kept me busy with the semester ending soon. Plus November is birthday month between my friends and I so that kept me busy as well.
"Do as I say, not as I do," Tony pointed his fork at Peter, grinning.
"I honestly don't know, but he's going to snap out of it, even if it means I homeschool him," Tony replied flatly, "This is-- I'm going to go talk to him, okay?"
"Hear that, kid? You're getting a sibling
"Yes, boss man. Right away." Steve joked, head up to their room.

"We'll knock him out and take him somewhere he doesn't recognize." Red said flatly, a smirk on her lips as she began walking towards Tony.
"It's so

"Dat's it! See?" Peter grinned, watching Sammy plop himself down again, "One more time, like we practiced, but I'm gonna watch, otay?"
yet, but
"Don't think there is anything else for now." He confirmed. "I think this is enough to try out for now and see where things go from there."
"You'll get it, baby boy. Don't cry. You are doing so good." Steve cooed gently. "He's tried so much in one day more than he ever has." He hummed softly.
He helped Sammy up onto his feet and steadied him, slowly letting go once the baby got his balance. He stood for a second or two before dropping to his behind, squeaking happily up at Peter.
"Thank you." Steve told him sweetly, then reaching into his pocket to pull out a few dollars and tossing it into the musician's case.
Steve moaned deeply as Tony's fingers worked him apart, head laying against Tony's chest. "I only... I only know what one of those things are." He gasped, moving with Tony's fingers in need.
“As long as you don't make me watch The Notebook, I think we're good."
"Tony, please.
"Sleep?" He mumbled.
Tony laughed, cupping his face and pulling him into a kiss, too caught up in the happiness to realize how forward he was being.
"I love you," he mumbled.
"Tony, we--we're still in front of the mirror." He whispered, trying to keep his legs from buckling.
"Anthony. What are you doing?" A stern voice came through the air into his room, Tony's back straightening as he continued to pack.
"You can feel that way, Peter. You're six. You won't even have to worry about it for a
"Occasionally, I meet with the child if they want to meet," Sharon replied softly, "That might seem.... strange, and a bit cold to you two, but with the way my condition is, I'm not sure if I will be able to meet the child. The last of my eggs were donated right before the beginning of my treatment, so--"
He grabbed Steve's hand, patiently waiting. Steve stood up, leading Peter into the cafeteria area that was in the aquarium. He paid to get them each a cup of ice cream, carrying the cups to the ice cream bar.
"I think this helped cheer him up. Glad you thought of it." Steve whispered, resting his chin on Tony's shoulder as they watched Peter. "I never like seeing him sad like that."
