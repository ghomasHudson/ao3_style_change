Tony cursed under his breath when Steve bared himself a little more to him and then tugged roughly at his sac, the blond’s pretty grunt and whine of dissatisfaction so damn pretty to his ears. “That’s it, sweetheart,” Tony praised and Steve whimpered, backing off touching himself at all, but Tony was thrilled to see his cock jump yet again.
his body. The first thing he noted was that his hips ached slightly, the second was that yeah, he could definitely smell Steve on him and not just his regular woodsy smell,
he thought wildly. “
“That’s why you never come to deliver my coffee yourself?” Tony asked, voice quiet as if he didn’t want to break whatever was brewing between them.
He’d fucked up, he knew that now and the guilt of it sat heavy in his stomach. He glanced down at himself as he shifted, forehead still pressed against the door and grimaced slightly as his now cooling come started to get uncomfortable. He sighed as he heard Steve start up the shower and decided he’d better wash up quickly himself and headed for his floor, hoping no one would happen across him.
Tony shook his head, coming over towards the couch. “No, it’s nothing…really,” Tony told him with a slight shake of his head.
, Bucky in his body, rather incredulously. Bucky was still howling when Tony came over and tossed the door handle onto the counter in front of him and the rest of the Team laughed at the two of them.

Tony blinked at him. “Not really, no.”
“ Steve blurted,
Tony’s next breath was a hitch of a thing and then he was taking a few careful steps towards the reading chair by the window without taking his eyes off his lover. “Lose the pants…and shirt,” He ordered, just as Steve turned to sit.
Steve frowned, already shaking his head. “Bucky, he doesn’t need me right now.
He shuddered as he’d slipped a hand beneath the waistband of his sweats and gripped himself and he wanted to tip his head back against the rest but found he apparently wanted to look even more.
Tony didn’t drop the pout, but now it was really more of a frown. “Okay, I’m sorry, you’re right.”
Bucky frowned over at him. “What are you talking about? You’re pretty healthy. I mean, sure you have an unhealthy attachment to coffee, but that’s not so bad. And you do exercise and eat pretty regularly, if Steve has anything to say about it.”
His forehead creased, brow furrowed in confusion for a half second before he remembered the text. He shifted to pull his cellphone out of his back pocket and relaxed when he saw a text from Bucky. He was probably just running behi-

than the bedroom eyes he’d been exuding but it was. But well, Bucky pouting had always been a weakness for him, wanting to make that bottom lip purse, press his thumb down on it a little and part those pretty pink lips so he could lick inside.
Natasha nodded, “Yeah…I can see that. I mean…you’d rather it honestly be you in there instead of just your body. I wonder if Tony will keep his promise…I mean, Steve didn’t say anything about it…maybe he’s-“
Tony blinked at him when the words seemed to dry up in his throat and shook his head. “

of surprise when he found Tony’s flesh and blood hand pressing against his chest. “Sorry,” Tony huffed, quickly moving off of him.
Of course Bucky blushed awfully hard at that and glanced around to see if anyone had heard Tony. Of course they all had and he quickly looked to Steve, “I-I didn’t-honest.” He tried, but even he didn’t sound convincing to his own ears.
genius? Then yes, you’d be right, Tony,” Steve admitted, smiling a little bashfully, nerves steadily creeping over his features.
His gaze got caught on the Arc Reactor, however, and he took a moment to just look at the incredible piece of technology while he continued to stroke himself slowly, his grip firm. That was another thing entirely; the
“ Bucky found himself saying, more a knee-jerk reaction than anything. “You mean, Tony.”
There was a soft chorus of agreement and Tony shrugged a bit and immediately winced when a bit of a sharp pain lanced through him near the join of the metal shoulder. “
“Then why?” Tony asked in confusion, shoulders slumping in defeat. “Is it because of Dum-E? I know he can be a bother sometimes, but-“
. Should not have taken me that long to begin with. Then I can’t even touch the holograms because the metal doesn’t respond to it. So frustrating. So I called Pepper, explained what happened and she suggested I take a vacation.
“Yeah, think I'll head down to the gym and get in a bit of a workout after breakfast. Not sure what else I can really get up to today, seeing as how I’m still uh...not me?” He offered with a shrug.
Steve was nodding when Bucky looked to him and Bucky was at a complete loss and he wished he had handled all of this better but-

Without much thought, Tony sprawled himself across the couch and half of him ended up across Bucky’s lap. Bucky

The look on Tony’s face…Bucky wasn’t sure what that had been exactly. He looked
and watched as Tony seemed to have just about enough of only watching. The metal hand-that

He knew it was only a text so he left it for the moment and went to steam the milk and by the time he’d finished making the latte, carefully pulling the foam through to make a little swirl therein, he’d almost forgotten his phone had gone off in the first place. That is, until he’d finished and Bucky still hadn’t come down.
Before long, Tony had drifted off and Bucky pulled a blanket down off the back of the couch, covering them both with it. He let the TV stay on and asked Jarvis to turn off the lights and not more than a half hour later, Bucky fell asleep too. The AI turned off the TV for them then without a word.

“ Steve muttered, running a hand hastily through his hair and fluffing up the already messy blonde strands.

Steve let out a strangled sound and grabbed the pillow he’d been reclined against, shoving it hastily between his legs in an attempt to cover himself. His eyes were wide,
Natasha cracked up at that and Bucky’s eyes widened. He shook his head in annoyance. “You’re an asshole, Barton.

of Steve with a quirk of his lips, eyes never straying from Steve’s face. “Package deal thing you’ve got going on here and on account of me…being in love with you too.”
Bucky shrugged and flashed him a little smile in return. Steve watched the pair quietly from his spot on the couch with a smile tugging at the corners of his lips and Natasha noticed, of course and plopped herself down next to him. “Hey, Steve,” She greeted, patting his thigh gently.
Bucky frowned a little and went to open his mouth to brush him off, tell him he was okay or some other lie, but then Tony’s eyes narrowed. “I can tell when I’m thinking about lyin’, Buck. Don’t even try it.”
“ Bucky breathed, sharp grey-blue eyes landing on him.
Bucky nodded and repeated firmly, “Just a number.”
“No, you shouldn’t,” Tony interrupted and Bucky’s gaze flickered up to meet his, but he couldn’t get a proper read on him, on
What no one had seen coming, however, was when Tony reached out to open the fridge with his metal arm and accidentally ripped the handle clean off the fridge, even going so far as to yank one of the hinges off in the process. The entire room went eerily quiet and Tony whispered, “
“Brother, you need to stop this foolishness. Whatever you have come here to do, enough. Just leave us, please. You've done enough,” Thor insisted, worried gaze flickering to Steve for a half second.
Bucky made a soft noise in the back of his throat at the way the French just rolled off his tongue in a way that had goosebumps breaking out along his skin and
Bucky came to with strong shaking hands in his hair, a heaving chest beneath his cheek and when he finally managed to open his eyes wide enough to see what was going on, he found himself looking into Tony’s tired yet smiling face.
Tony frowned but nodded, as did Bucky and then the blond let out a really exasperated sigh as he turned to look at Bucky and then back to Tony. He was obviously feeling very unsure of himself, but really, it was understandable. How often does one suddenly find your current boyfriend in the body of your ex-boyfriend anyway? Bucky inwardly grimaced at the thought.

Bucky smirked and rolled his eyes, lifting up his shirt slightly to reveal a set of rather impressive abs. “Coulda’ fooled me. I’d say you looked like a regular gym rat with this kinda’ muscle on ya’.”

Bucky had fled of course and the second he’d flopped down onto the lounge, he’d looked down at himself-
“Tony-
“Yeah,” Tony breathed, voice shaky. “Might have something to do with the whole-“ He gestured to basically
“Hey-“ That was Tony’s voice and Bucky jerked a little in surprise, obviously startled by the interruption.
“So…you gonna take a peek?” Clint asked with a salacious eyebrow wiggle.
Steve couldn’t help the soft rumbling laughter that escaped him and he tried to stifle it against the genius’ neck. He slowed himself down after that, feeling Tony’s careful hands running comfortingly up and down his arms, up over his shoulders and into his hair. He barely managed to stifle a groan as Tony gently tugged at his short hair to get him to pull back slightly.
“I knew I couldn’t have Steve anymore, he wasn’t mine, we-we were different-
“There you are,” Tony breathed, gaze practically
Clint was still laughing as he called after him, “Wait! Think you might want to play COD before you nap?!”
There was an empty mug on the coffee table with one of Steve’s sketchbooks nearby but there weren’t any other mugs or tablets lying around, so Bucky assumed Tony wasn’t there. He let out a soft sigh. He wasn’t about to wake Steve just to screw up his day even
Bucky stilled, suddenly nervous gaze flicking to Tony who…was

“Sorry, I’ll shave. I noticed it earlier too,” Bucky explained and Tony hummed.
Thankfully, he didn’t spill the coffee in his hand and smiled apologetically at the robot and carefully sidestepped him. Tony was laughing lightly under his breath and Steve smiled sheepishly at him as he got a little closer.
“Well,
“What happened?” Tony blurted and watched in incredulity as Steve’s cheeks went just that much darker.
But Bucky just shook his head, making his way towards the door hurriedly. He needed to get out of there right now. “Please
Bucky took a deep breath and tried to calm himself. His thoughts were starting to wander and it was only going to go downhill from there if he couldn’t get a handle on himself. He really didn’t want to spiral today. “Well, I think it’s safe to say that you’re both benched from any missions or calls for the next few days while this sorts itself out,” Steve sighed, his gaze flickering between the pair.
Bucky shook his head, waving him off. Anything to get the two of them out of the kitchen so that he could continue to have his little mental freakout in peace…or at least, not in front of the two people that he really didn’t want to witness it.
it’s not permanent. That’s good,” Clint chimed in, twirling a random arrow in his grasp.
The first person he saw was Steve sitting and reading who was now smiling at him gently. “Uh, hey...how long was I asleep?” Bucky asked, rubbing at his eyes.

Tony didn't seem to realize that others were present and quickly glanced in his direction, “Oh, don't worry about it. Honestly, I guess I really could use a break. Just thought it would be nicer if I wasn’t confined to the Tower and was on a beach somewhere.”
The blond exhaled shakily and shook his head. “Loki came by for a visit and he probably wouldn’t have done anything if I hadn’t-“ He ran a nervous hand through his hair, making a right mess of the strands. “He asked me how I was getting along,” He started again. “Asked me how it was having Bucky back and-

Bucky looked after him, utterly flabbergasted. “What?” And
Steve chuckled softly and smiled over at him so lovingly and Bucky was completely thrown by the look he hadn’t been on the receiving end in only God knows how long. But then Steve seemed to remember himself and schooled his features, his cheeks flushing slightly as he realized what he was doing. “What a Tony-like thing to say,” Steve covered, chuckling nervously and gave him a little shrug, gaze flickering back towards Tony in Bucky’s body.
Tony nodded in agreement, still stuck on stretching and admiring the metal arm. “It's not so bad. I mean, the arm is kinda cool. Not gonna lie,” Tony huffed in amusement, a bit of a manic tilt to his grin.

“Well, I’m terribly sorry to have hurt you like that, Tony,” He huffed, rolling his eyes as he turned to run the water at the sink.
Bucky exhaled shakily, gaze flickering to Steve for an instant and swallowing thickly before looking back to Tony when he continued. “And then he met me and let’s face it, it’s me so

Tony was pinching the bridge of his nose, his bright eyes closed and face scrunched up in the absolutely picture of frustration. So of course Steve let his eyes drop to Ton-
Well, everyone
Tony nodded and huffed out an uncomfortable chuckle. “Yeah, stupid. Right?”
“Okay
Both Bucky and Steve burst out laughing and the brunet shook his head. “Seriously, Tony. 5k shouldn’t have winded you this much, I thought you were a lot fitter than this,” Bucky teased.
Spinning on his heel he made his way back over to the espresso machine and proceeded to pour a cup of milk into the stainless steel milk frother, other hand already picking up the cinnamon and nutmeg he would add momentarily. Bucky would be down in a moment and Steve was ready to ask him for yet another favour, however, no sooner had he let the thought cross his mind, did the cellphone in his back pocket vibrate.
Bucky
Tony was eerily silent and there was an unreadable expression on his face, not that Bucky noticed, too busy staring at Steve in askance. “What did he know, Steve?” Bucky asked, voice quiet, gentle and timid in a way Tony had never heard himself sound before.
,” Steve assured him. “We just wanted to be able to love you, let us love you in any way we could.”
He sat there for another three-minutes before he just couldn’t take it anymore. “
Now Bucky knew what Tony’s voice sounded like when he was turned on and a tad mortified, if he were being honest. “Sorry,” Tony apologized and he did sound apologetic but Bucky wasn’t stupid enough to let himself look just yet. “I was just trying to say, that I think there’s plenty of…nice things to look at. You’re handsome, is what I’m really
“How’s your headache?” Came Tony’s all too knowing voice and Bucky’s steps faltered.
Steve made that soft strangled sort of sound again but he couldn’t seem to meet Tony’s eyes-
Tony’s eyes crinkled adoringly as he pressed in closer, gently tugging Steve in by the back of his neck. “Yeah, champ. Now…kiss me again?”
“I-“ He took a deep shaky breath. “Bucky walked in on me while I was…touching…myself.”
Steve rolled his eyes, “Tony o

Bucky rolled his eyes, “Sure bird brain, come on.”
Bucky was going to die.

Steve shuddered at the light command and found himself turning his head away from his lover. Tony’s gaze narrowed at the move, but one of the blond’s hands did start to caress down his body, ghosting over an already peaked nipple and then lower to caress over his abs.

and exhaled shakily himself. “I’ll put fresh sheets on and set out some clothes for you, alright?”
Tony rolled his eyes and shrugged, “Yeah well. Now I don't have a choice.” He huffed as he came over towards where Bucky was sitting.
-“ Steve tried, slipping out of his own bedroom and across the hall into Bucky’s.
He had moved into the Tower under Steve and Tony’s insistence over four months ago and while it hadn't been easy in the least, he was finally starting to feel comfortable there, in large thanks to Tony, Steve and even the rest of the Team. Everyone looked out for him and while he still clung to Steve like a bad smell most days, he was slowly starting to feel more and more like his old self with some very obvious differences, mind.
The two nodded and said their goodbyes and soon Bucky was alone in the quiet of their apartment. He sighed deeply and rest back against his bedroom door, glancing around at his bedroom he suddenly realized he really didn’t want to do anything for the rest of the day. Not entirely sure what to do with himself, he started with a shower and this time, he managed to keep his mind busy elsewhere for the duration of his routine.
Bucky huffed in amusement despite himself, already scrubbing a hand over his face in frustration. He couldn’t help but notice that Tony’s usually well maintained facial hair was starting to get a little unruly…whereas, the scruff that Bucky tended to sport was neat and…freshly trimmed. He felt like a total heel, not having been taking care of Tony’s body enough to even remember to
When their kiss finally broke, one of Steve’s hands gently carding through his longer locks Bucky pulled back to better see them both and what he saw reflected in their gazes was enough to bring the words he so desperately felt unbidden to his lips.
was he capable of saying anything else?
“And you will get over them,” He breathed, exhaling roughly through his nose as he came to a stop outside of the apartment he shared with Steve. “You just need to hear them say they don’t love you like that and get over it.”
“R-right, thanks. I’ll uh…I’ll see you later, Tony,” He told him, already turning back to the door.
on Tony’s hands,
Tony let out a sort of undignified squeak from across from him and Bucky glanced up to see his body with his hands outstretched and eyes focused nervously on the metal arm. Bucky grimaced, “Tony?” He asked timidly.
but Bucky didn’t notice, too busy looking into his glass. “Don’t know why,” Tony started, voice having dropped an octave. “I think there’s plenty of nice things to look at.”
“Oh, darling,” He found himself whispering and quietly pulled himself away from the door, knowing that if he stood there any longer, he’d not be able to resist going in and scooping his lover up into the biggest hug he could manage.
” He prompted, crossing his arms in front of his chest-metal and flesh alike-in a slight show of impatience.
Steve pinched the bridge of his nose and shut his eyes, he looked very young in that moment and Natasha frowned in concern. “It's just...you know Tony doesn’t do the whole feelings thing too well and I’m just an idiot-“ Steve started.
“W-what happened?” He asked, voice a little choked and he quickly pushed himself up, realizing that he was propped up against Steve’s goddamn
not even close.
He didn’t let himself think about it too hard before he was picking up the cup and cradling it carefully in his too big hands and heading off to the workshop. The more time he took to think this through, the worse off he was going to be. It wasn’t as if he hadn’t been to the workshop before. It was just that...well the workshop was...
Steve frowned deeply, brows creased and lip drawn between his teeth. He nodded sharply, “I understand...but he has to know that I’d never give up our friendship for anything.”

“We wanted to tell you, together…and if-if you didn’t return out feelings, that would be
“That’s a bold faced lie. What’s goin’ on, Tony?” Bucky demanded sternly.
Bucky pinched the bridge of his nose, sighing deeply as he sat down on the living room couch on the communal floor. The Sun was already up behind him and the light was filtering in through the big floor to ceiling windows and bathing the furnishings in the warmth of its morning light. He scrubbed his flesh and blood hand over his face and let out an exasperated huff. This really needed to stop. He needed to truly get a handle on this or so help him-
and Bucky glanced over to see him scrubbing a hand over his face in frustration. “
“Two of
Both Steve and Tony agreed and the blond nodded. “Sounds good, let me know if you’d like some company. I was gonna go for my run but it’s raining pretty bad and I really don't feel up to getting soaked.”
aside from the bathroom.
Bucky smiled nervously and stretched a bit as he nodded. Then in strode Tony and Natasha and the genius was talking animatedly with his hands to the red head, metal flashing and arm whirring in his agitation.
“Oh no you don’t,” Tony warned, already following him to the bedroom. “It’s been going on 36 hours now with no hanky panky. I’m going just as crazy as you are and I know how you get,
Bucky sighed deeply as he pulled on a pair of too big black sleep pants and a white t-shirt. He still had forgotten to ask Tony for some of his clothes, but Tony hadn’t really asked him for any of his either, so…
“I wasn’t stupid,” Tony cut in. “I knew what you two were to each other long before we knew you were alive and when we found out, I told him that I would do everything in my power to bring you home. I knew Steve loved you, would keep loving you. But he loved me too and I believed him with every fibre of my being when he told me he wasn’t going to leave me.”
Tony tensed for a split second and then seemed to deflate and came to sit down next to the brunet, glancing over at him as he drew his knees up a bit. “Do you want to cuddle?” Bucky asked gently. “I mean, I know you like your snuggles.”
Bucky took a deep breath and tried really hard not to let that simple phrase hit him too hard.
Bucky reached out as he turned to leave and placed his hand over the metal hand as it rest atop the couch. “I’m sure it’s not stupid, Tony. Tell me what’s wrong, please?”
It was all too much. He felt overwhelmed by his desire for his friend, for Tony in that moment too and he stroked himself faster, grip tight and perfect as he thumbed roughly over the head, right beneath that sensitive ridge and he felt it. That tell-tale bodily clench, the heat beneath the surface of what felt like his whole self and he knew it was going to be a hell of an orgasm, but could do nothing, didn’t
There was the lingering smell of Tony’s cologne filling the space, a scent Bucky had become far too familiar with since coming to the Tower. It felt intimate here as he settled himself on the sofa, the tension bleeding from his frame as he settled back against the cushions. He took a very deep breath in and let it out slowly and ignored the little pinch he felt deep in his chest, something he realized simply came with the territory.
Tony was whispering something to him, but all Steve heard was the sound of Bucky’s voice, that low timbre, the rough aroused rumble that Steve just knew would be the death of him someday. He whimpered-
“I’m not really sure I trust you not to butcher my hard work.”
“Mhm, you say that,” Tony murmured and Bucky swallowed, taking another sip to distract himself; his headache was already dissipating.
Tony huffed out a soft breath and took a step closer to the man and when Bucky didn’t spook or move away at all, the genius stepped up to him and gently laid both of his hands, metal and flesh alike, atop his very own shoulders.
“Sorry,
He frowned slightly and tried to shake his head, reaching up to rub at his eyes. “Yeah, I'm okay, Steve. Is Tony okay?”
“Eyes on me,” He demanded and Steve hurried to open them. “That’s better,” Tony praised. “Go on and touch yourself for me, sweetheart. I want to see you dirty up those abs.”
Bucky shook his head, already heading for the elevators, “Thanks, Nat. But no, I’ll be alright. Have a good night.”
tried not to stare back at himself.
What’s worse though, was the fact that they’d figured out that he was also in love with Tony, because really, it was definitely love. He wasn’t going to deny it. But there was honestly nothing he could do about it, so he kept to himself on the matter and dealt with it in his own way.
Later that afternoon, Bucky found himself lying flat on his back on one of the sparring mats in the gym as he struggled for air. He was wheezing and struggling to relax his frantically beating heart, but he couldn’t help laughing breathlessly when Steve leaned over him to check on him, a worried but fond expression on his face.
“Jeeze, Buck. You sound like you’re havin’ an asthma attack,” He chuckled, with a shake of his head.
Tony never usually did it in front of people, that extra bit of explanation being kept quiet until the rest of the Team was busy elsewhere and Tony could approach him on his own, usually to ask Steve if he had any additional questions or concerns about the new tech. Usually Steve would say no, that he got it, but when Tony would nod and then linger…Steve would hesitantly ask whatever it was that he’d been thinking.
But he didn’t get the chance.
Tony immediately raised his left hand and shook a metal finger at him menacingly, practically scowling at the soldier. Bucky swallowed hard and frowned. “Barnes. It is pretty bad. I mean, yeah it’s not excruciating, but you’re clearly in pain like-
Now if only Bucky could make himself stop thinking of his best friend’s guy in more than a friendly sense, that would be great. He inwardly grimaced at the thought but quickly pushed it aside when he shivered on the next downstroke. The pleasure was too good to ignore right then and he let the hand that had been tracing carefully around the Reactor drop much lower, down to fondle his sac gently. He’d found that Tony was quite sensitive there, not like himself. Well, not entirely. He was sensitive just about everywhere, but his balls could take a bit of abuse, unlike Tony’s.
And then he’d found out shortly after arriving that Tony and Steve had been dating for almost six months prior to finding out that Bucky was alive and…that threw him back a few steps. That right there, that was a crushing blow he had not been prepared for in the slightest, but surprisingly he had handled it pretty well. At least, he thought he had.
His friends never really put up a fuss to deliver the drinks to Tony, in the beginning. But now that this had gone on for
-hands over Tony’s biceps, mindful of where the cup of coffee was slightly raised between them now clasped in both of Tony’s hands.
Tony swallowed hard and for a moment, didn’t say anything. They just stared at each other, seeing themselves through each others eyes and for a long moment, everything seemed to just fade away. “It’s just a number,” Tony breathed, blinking back a slew of tears he hadn’t even realized had been building.
. I’m sorry I woke you up for nothin’
and quickly shook his head. “You know what? I think I’m good. I feel pretty great actually,” Tony insisted, but then he was reaching up with his right hand to rub at the join where metal met flesh on his left shoulder and he winced slightly.
Bucky shrugged, unable to meet his gaze. “Don’t worry about it.”
And yes, Steve was aware that this was not a valid reason to avoid the workshop, to avoid Tony. He
“Well, I sort of want to go and fool around in the gym now. See how much I can lift,” Tony told them, looking toward Bucky to see if it was alright.
, there, that was better.
,” Steve breathed and in the next moment his large warm,
Bucky’s eyes widened, his lips parting in surprise and for the first time since the whole body swap had happened, he allowed himself to truly
Hearing the worry in his friend’s voice wouldn’t even allow him to even contemplate refuting the idea. “Okay,” He found himself agreeing and Tony gently guided him to his feet.
Bucky shook his head as the man rolled his eyes, “It’s not stupid, Tony. It’s a part of you. Here-“ He tried, motioning for the genius to come and sit with him.
Steve was entirely on the floor and Bucky was mostly on top of Steve and Tony was pretty well entirely on top of them, so…
Bucky took a moment to glance around the space and swallowed thickly. Tony’s space was…it was something else. All clean lines and sleek marble. Black and white and greys with touches of cobalt scattered throughout. It was beautiful but looked as if you were to touch anything, you’d somehow ruin it. It was odd though, there wasn’t a stitch of red or gold anywhere.
Steve sighed, “Maybe. But I mean…it’s not like I can just ask him. How do we even go about telling him of our feelings let alone asking him if he’d like to be a part of a
He groaned in annoyance and rubbed his hand over his face, scratching at Tony’s facial hair and then smoothing it down. He sighed and shifted on the couch, leaning his back up against the arm rest and stretching out his legs a little.
Steve was instantly standing in front of him, hands hovering nervously over Tony, but not quite touching him. “What’s the matter?”
face quite nicely.
Tony tensed slightly and Bucky’s gaze softened. “You were so kind to me when you found me…when I came here I-I wasn’t myself and you-“ He swallowed past the lump in his throat. “You forgave me and I fell for you-
Bucky’s brows furrowed, confusion evident in his gaze and then he was looking to Tony…for…
“Sit down, I’ll be right back,” Tony gestured towards the sofa in the sunken living room and Bucky watched him head off down a hall.
Bucky was slowly coaxing Tony to the side in hopes of Steve coming to stand in front of him and if not, Bucky wouldn’t have a problem standing in his path, but Loki seemed to realize what he was doing and grinned before he was brandishing a sceptre in their direction. There was only a split second to react and Bucky did the only thing he could think of.
, Buck. It’s okay, really. Here, can we sit down?”
sorry. Are you okay?”
They were sitting on the floor for one thing, Steve sitting with his legs splayed out and Tony tucked in under one arm. “It just…
so, what the actual fuck?” Tony yelped...only it wasn’t in Tony's voice.
Tony genuinely wanted to help him in any way that he could and Steve
“Come on, Steve,” Tony wheedled and Steve’s gaze snapped up to meet his. “We don’t even have to touch each other.”
Tony gave him a slightly nervous smile and that’s when Bucky noticed the posture. Tony looked stiff, uncomfortable and had his arms wrapped around himself protectively. “What’s wrong?” Bucky asked curiously, shifting to look at him better.
Tony had bullied his way between his thighs, forcing him to part his knees enough to allow Tony to step in closer and he was really fuckin’ close now. And it was
. He could smell
She leaned in real close to him and took a deep breath close to his ear, bright eyes flickering down his frame before meeting his eyes once again. “You smell like sex, after all.”
“Stole the words right out of my-“ He grimaced, cutting himself off and looked to Bucky apologetically. “Never mind.”
Natasha helped Tony to his feet and Bucky glanced over to see the genius…in his super-soldier body looking at him with such a deep sadness in his eyes. He cringed slightly, not liking the openness of such a look seen reflected in his very own face. He tried to look away, but not before Tony had managed to meet his gaze and catch it for a fraction of a second too long.
Tony and Steve both frowned deeply. “How on
and it
and seen the tent in his comfortable sweats and just
Tony grinned and waggled his eyebrows suggestively, to which Steve rolled his eyes, his cheeks stained a light pink as he turned his attention away from Tony’s body. Bucky let his shirt slip back into place and shook his head in disbelief at the genius.
, Natasha! When was the last time I took a vacation?!” He cried out in indignation.
“I think,” Natasha started, but then grew quieter, looking over towards the pair who were bickering over what to watch. “I think Tony has been very honest with Bucky from the start, but you’re right. He’s not ever told him explicitly, but I think Bucky may sort of know, just refuses to acknowledge it. Same goes for the way you are with him. I think he knows you feel strongly for him, of course, but he’s got blinders on. He won’t let himself acknowledge that you may have romantic feelings for him because he doesn’t want to step between you and Tony. He’s genuinely happy for the both of you. I know he’s eternally grateful for what you’ve both done for him, he would never want to jeopardize your friendships.”
“What Steve is trying to say…is that he is in love with you, Bucky,” Tony clarified and Bucky blinked…and then began shaking his head and couldn’t seem to stop.
feel about him right now and Tony sure as hell hasn’t.”
, however. Though, he was pretty sure his friends had caught on rather quickly to that little tidbit. Regardless, the espresso machine was one of those bits of technology he still struggled with and it wasn’t entirely because it had a thousand settings. Oh no, he’d figured them out well enough after a few trial an errors. He’d made Bucky many a latte and cappuccino, even an
Tony hummed under his breath as he let himself look his fill, the blond laid out against the lighter beige comforter with delicate filigree that spread down the sides of the bed. “Well, don’t you look pretty,” Tony murmured, but Steve knew Tony wasn’t really talking to him.
Tony had always known to wait just that bit longer, or so it seemed.
Bucky shifted in his spot, letting his book rest face down on his knee as his gaze slipped over his friend, noting the steady rise and fall of his chest. He also couldn’t help noticing the little shiver that worked its way through the man’s frame.
, no, Buck. It’s okay,” He stressed. “Come here. Was it a nightmare?” Steve asked worriedly, reaching out to try and coax him back into his arms.
Steve sighed softly, “Well, you really could use a bit of a break. You work too hard.”
He wanted to come but more than that, he wanted Tony
“I don't know
Tony scowled at him and took a step towards him and Bucky realized that he was a fair bit taller than the genius. He swallowed hard, looking up at the brunet in his body and suddenly he felt very, very small.
“Steve?”
, he had been right. “Uh…hey Tony…everything okay?” Bucky asked nervously.
He grimaced a bit and decided he’d just wait for the man to wake up and
Tony sighed deeply and shook his head, taking a long sip of his drink and effectively finishing it off. “You said it, because you don’t believe that you are handsome nor that
Bucky’s brows furrowed deeply but before he could open his mouth, Thor was clearing his throat. “Oh dear, it looks like my brother has played a bit of a trick on you both. There are not two of you. If you’ll both stay calm and just to inform you, this is not permanent. Take a look down at yourselves, I think you’ll find what the problem is,” Thor told them sheepishly.
When Tony had come back not ten-minutes later with fresh clothes and a clearer head, Steve was still in the shower, so Tony busied himself with stripping the bed and pulling out a set of fresh sheets. After he’d finished that, he went about pulling out a pair of grey pants for Steve and a white t-shirt, knowing he’d probably be too warm after his shower to want a sweater on just yet. He pulled out a pair of black briefs and a pair of socks before he set them neatly on the dresser beside the bathroom door.
. “There…
But he’d only ask after he’d come back from delivering it himself and all Steve could do was shrug, lower his gaze to a spot on the floor and try to will the steadily rising blush from his cheeks.
been busy after all. Tony hummed softly under his breath as he made himself comfortable in the oversized chair, his attention solely focused on Steve as he sat down at the edge of the bed, body turned towards Tony.
loved you.”
Bucky swallowed hard, pulling himself free of his friend hastily, his movements tense and jerky. “I-I’m so sorry, Steve. I didn’t realize-“
He lingered there for a moment, just listening to the sounds of the water running, splashing against tiles and glass and he frowned, closing his eyes as he heard the unmistakable sound of a soft hitched breath, a
Tony sighed and now Steve turned to survey him, frown only deepening when the genius shrugged and refused to meet his gaze. It only confused Steve more. “Yeah, I mean…I know you don’t like coming down here, so…”
, I like to wear it and I felt like something was missing the last couple of days. I hope you don’t mind.”
Steve blinked and carefully studied Tony’s expression, but of course, nothing changed. He looked unreadable and Steve found himself wanting to say no, just on principle but there was something in his eyes that kept him holding his tongue.
“Mornin’,” Bucky murmured as Steve came and sat down on the edge of the coffee table, only a foot or so away.
,” Tony whispered, smiling a little bigger.
But, he wasn’t thinking.
and Steve had always thought he was beautiful, not only handsome in that ruggedly charming way he liked to show off, but just in his effortless casualness that always managed to tug at a spot behind Steve’s ribcage.
Bucky rolled onto his side and looked over at the genius, but only started laughing harder and in turn let out a very raspy wheeze. Steve knelt down beside him and rubbed his back a bit, “Well? Are you dyin’ Buck?” He teased.
espresso machine that sits apart from the regular coffee maker is a bit intimidating. Not only because it has a thousand and one additional settings that also includes a steamer, but because it was

Bucky looked over at him and frowned deeply, struck by the picture he made. “

. Loki was yelling something, cackling gleefully and unfortunately he couldn’t quite make it out, but then it was over.
Steve huffed and shifted where he sat, sitting up a bit more as he pressed a chaste kiss to Tony’s temple before reaching out to take Bucky’s flesh and blood hand in his. Bucky let him, because why wouldn’t he?
with lies and I-I could never-“ Tony shook his head, upset and frustrated and Bucky was at a loss, or so he thought.
His cheeks were flushed a bit and Bucky smiled nervously when Tony finally realized where he was. “Oh, I'm sorry James. I didn’t mean to sleep away on you like that.”
and Tony was...well he was
“I used to watch her do her makeup, pin her hair up and get ready for a night out. When I was much younger, of course,” He shrugged a little and went over to the vanity, trailing his metal fingers lightly along a delicate looking jar of something or other. “Couldn’t bare to part with it.”
“ He breathed, casting a worried look towards Tony, feeling like such an intruder in their private moment.
Tony snorted and shook his head, “I don’t run, Barnes. I jog…at a leisurely pace when it’s called for.”
“No, you’re not,” Tony refuted.
“Alright, well, we’ll see you guys later, I guess,” Tony told them as he started out of the kitchen, Steve following close behind.
was that? He cringed at the very thought.

“I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have-“
was just something he couldn’t even begin to comprehend. Steve was immediately following his friend, however, Tony’s frantic hand gestures insisting that he go after him.
” Tony said slowly, brow furrowed in a mixture of disbelief and curiosity.
Bucky smiled a little and couldn’t help chuckling softly, “Ah…hopefully he didn’t cause too much damage?”
Tony rolled his eyes, only half annoyed. “I’m fit, Barnes. No doubt about it. But my body doesn’t do running, no. I lift light weights and go for short jogs here and there. But most of my workouts consist of lifting heavy pieces of metal, squatting and the like in the comfort of my lab while I work on the suits.”
Bucky sighed softly and reached up to pinch the bridge of his nose, not really sure how to talk about this. He shook his head slightly and let his hand fall back to his side. “Look, it’s not a big deal, Tony. I appreciate the concern, but I’m used to it. It really doesn’t bother me anymore,” Bucky told him…only somewhat honestly.
He didn’t bother to wait for Bucky to nod or even barely acknowledge that he was going to let him before carrying on. “Steve has loved you for forever,
desperate and throaty and so turned on at the sight it physically
“ He muttered and scowled ahead at nothing in particular.
“Not arguing with you there,” She interjected with a little chuckle.
I didn’t ask if you were fine,” Tony huffed. “And I know you have a headache, so come on, up you get.”
Tony nodded and lowered his hand, gesturing towards Bucky’s chest…er, Tony’s chest…where the Arc Reactor was. Bucky’s eyes widened slightly when it dawned on him. “
, but what was that
Steve’s eyes were wide, his lips parted in surprise and his eyebrows were definitely up in his hair line. The rest of the Team were all trying desperately to hide their grins and Tony immediately back-pedalled. “I-I mean. To work out-
“So close already,
. And that was really the kicker for Steve. Because he knew Tony didn’t regret taking the extra time to teach Steve something new, knew that he wasn’t frustrated or annoyed when Steve asked him a question.
Tony shook his head in disbelief. “Oh,
Steve let out a noise next to him and Bucky glanced over at his friend worriedly, wondering what was wrong. “Don’t you
, your Arc Reactor?”
Bucky blew out a slow breath and nodded slowly. “Yeah-“ And his voice shouldn’t have been so hoarse, there was no reason for it. “It is.”
I’m really looking forward to having a chat with those two,” Loki told them, eyeing both Bucky and Tony with a hint of a smirk gracing his lips.
“ Tony breathed, exhaling shakily and drawing in an equally shaky breath. “I don’t think I’ve come in my pants like some damn teenager since we first started dating.”
Steve nodded, “I suspected that might be the problem. He didn’t want to talk about it and said he was gonna’ go down to the lab or something. But I’m glad he got to get some sleep.”
, less than even. He grimaced at the thought, rolling his shoulders as he opened the fridge and grabbed the carton of milk.
Steve smiled kindly, “A couple of hours. Feel better?”
Bucky huffed despite himself and nodded, watching as Tony poured a couple of fingers worth of the amber liquid for each of them and sat down on the sofa beside him. Bucky took the pill, swallowed it dry with little fuss and took the offered glass.

And Tony huffed a soft laugh at himself, reluctantly prying his metal hand away from his lap, glancing up to find Steve’s expression shifting from needy and turned on to-
Tony took a slow breath in and exhaled a little shakily. “I…would like you to go sit on the bed for me.”
Bucky shrugged, “It’s your body, Tony. Don’t have to be uncomfortable asking me to do that if it’ll help you sleep.”
Steve whimpered and did as he was told. He drew the leg farthest from Tony up to plant his foot on the mattress and bent the other, making sure that Tony could see him properly as the hand that had been lightly toying with his nipples slipped down between his legs to fondle at his balls.
Bucky only laughed harder at that and wheezed even more. Steve chuckled softly and glanced up when Tony walked into the gym. “Uh…is he dying?” Tony asked with a stupid grin.
“Y-you don’t have to go,” Came Steve’s soft whisper. “I just-“ He sighed shakily and Tony just knew he was beating himself up about this. “Can you make up the bed? I’m…I’m going to take a shower, try and clear my head.”
of the damning blush.
It didn’t take too long before Steve let the tips of his fingers trail back up the path of his abs and chest and Tony knew he was stalling, giving himself a minute to work up to it and Tony let him, knowing that he would give in eventually.
“Hey, Buck,” Tony greeted, coming over to the coffee maker just as it finished brewing.
But he also knew that it didn’t necessarily
“Hey there, big guy,” Tony murmured, taking a step towards his lover.
Tony rolled his eyes, “I guess-“
Steve sighed and looked to her, keeping his voice low as he replied, “I'm afraid I'm going to slip and kiss the wrong one.”
“ Bucky said sternly. “I am
without you stomping all over their relationship, gettin’ in the way and shit.”
Bucky nodded and shifted, slowly getting to his feet, “Ah, alright then. Breakfast first?”
“Uh, yeah…but-“ Tony started, casting a nervous glance over at Bucky who had only just barely managed to school his features into something less devastating.
Steve blushed a little and nodded, murmuring his good byes but just as Tony was about to leave, he decided to grab a bottle of water from the fridge. This time he was careful when he opened the door and he smirked triumphantly.
. “It’s interesting though.”
to do anything, to stop it.
He told himself over and over again.
Natasha shrugged, “Pretty good...though I'm more interested in how you're handling this whole thing. They seem to be doing alright though.”
He took a deep breath and tried to steel himself as he started lathering himself up. Starting with his stomach, he brushed the loofa across his skin and sent up a few prayers as he tried to keep his thoughts from wandering too badly.
Tony huffed, but didn’t disagree. They fell into an uncomfortable silence after that and Bucky shifted, knowing he’d overstayed his welcome. “I should go-“
Bucky and Tony just grinned and soon Bucky was walking over to grab a bottle of water for himself. “Just take it easy on my body, please? I’m not exactly in the prime of my life and it definitely shows,” Tony huffed.
The moaning persisted along with Steve’s muffled pleas to keep it down. He was clearly laughing though and Bucky couldn’t help blush even deeper whenever the sound of his moaning carried across the hall to him for almost another ten-minutes.
Bucky must have looked completely flabbergasted because Tony gave him this really adorable exasperated look. Bucky quickly shook himself. “I-I'm good. Honest,” Bucky told him and couldn't help the fact that his voice wavered a little.
To which Tony bolted for the kitchen, apparently he was rather hungry.
“It’s
Tony was still snoring softly by the time the second movie ended and when Clint yawned and announced that it was definitely bedtime, Tony awoke. He looked around slightly dazed before he seemed to realize where he was and then sleepily got to his feet. Steve smiled up at him and nodded towards the elevators.
Once dried off and dressed, he flopped himself down onto his bed and threw his arm up over his face. He dozed for a short while and awoke to the sound of voices coming down the hallway.
Just as he was starting to really become lost in his thoughts of how to handle his newest fuck up with Steve and Tony, the aforementioned genius decided to make an appearance. Tony strode through the living room, coming up short when he caught sight of Bucky hunched in on himself on the couch, head in his hands and pretty well tugging at the longer strands of his darker locks. “Bucky?” He asked softly, not wanting to spook him but needing to make sure he was all right.
as it were. And then there was Steve…the poor guy was starting to look quite strained around the edges. Bucky tried not to think about
he didn’t deliver the drinks himself, but that was because Steve gathered that they already knew.
Tony smiled at him and it was a slow spreading smile, one that threatened to turn a little roguish and a hell of a lot dangerous if he found himself so inclined. Bucky swallowed…
“I mean it,” Bucky chuckled and Tony’s eyes crinkled as he glanced back to Bucky. “And…thanks, for this.”
Not that that was all that unusual for Bucky these days. The man was rather quiet, a far cry from his old self, but Bucky was
Bucky glanced between the two for a moment before he started off towards the elevators. “Think I’m gonna’ head up and wash up. Might relax with a book or somethin’. I’ll see you guys later, okay?”
The whole outburst seemed so uncharacteristic of him though and though it was in Tony’s body, they were still pleased that he was laughing about something. Tony snorted and shook his head while the others mumbled something along the lines of,
Tony didn’t comment and instead ducked his head a little and turned to look at himself in the mirror of the vanity. Bucky couldn’t breathe again. Not when Tony proceeded to pull the tie from his hair and then carefully went about pulling the longer locks he was unaccustomed with back into a more tidy bun.
” The genius purred and Steve made a wounded sound and looked away, already taking a faltering step backwards.
“I don’t mind,” Bucky said, voice gruff and definitely all kinds of strained.
Bucky swallowed hard and looked at them with pleading eyes. “I-I want…that. I want that,” He whispered and Steve’s whole face positively
Bucky exhaled roughly, gaze snapping between the two men incredulously. “You can’t be serious…”
Bucky couldn’t help smiling a bit at that and glancing over at the genius himself, who just so happened to be giving him a timid smile of his own. Soon they were back in the kitchen and Bucky was well on his way into his third cup of coffee when Tony stood and went to the fridge to get a glass of orange juice.
Steve swallowed hard and fixed him with a very concerned stare, but Bucky was done arguing. He grabbed a sweater from his dresser and slipped it on over his t-shirt hastily. “I’m gonna’ go for a walk, clear my head,” He said, readjusting his sweater before slipping past the blond and out into the hallway.
drinks…so that he could maybe make something nice for Tony…on account of the man always doing nice things for him and the rest of the Team.
You see, this wasn’t the first time Loki had showed up at the Tower uninvited and it surely wouldn’t be the last. But as of late, his only mission had seemed to revolve around stirring shit up and causing a bit of a raucous for the Team. Hardly anything to really worry over, but his early morning visit didn’t bode well for the remainder of their day.
part. He was falling for him-his best friend’s guy-how downright
had Steve’s lips stilling against his and for a split second, Bucky let himself enjoy the sweet press before Steve was pulling back sharply, Bucky jerking back just as fast.
“ Tony started and he’d barely gotten that far before the blonde was up and off the bed, heading for their bathroom.

Bucky’s cheeks were beat red by the time Steve, Tony and a few of the others had glanced his way and really, he could do nothing to hide it at this point. He just hoped that Tony’s facial hair was enough to at least hide
Natasha frowned slightly, “How do you know that for sure, Barnes?”
Steve was too busy staring elsewhere to notice.
“I am not trying to avoid you, nor am I trying to avoid the workshop…not-not really,” He amended and then grimaced slightly at the stupidity of that sentence.
He went to sit on the bed.
Steve smiled softly and grabbed a blanket off of one of the recliners, carefully draping it over the brunet. “Ah, well. To be fair, Tony really doesn’t get a lot of sleep and Bucky isn’t used to having a regular body, so I can see how he’d feel a bit worn out.”
The last thing he needed was a breakdown to start the day off. Tony brow furrowed when Bucky inhaled deeply and shifted in his sleep. “Wake up, sleepyhead,” Steve cooed, wafting the coffee towards the still sleeping man.
Natasha just gave him a little smile as his cheeks flushed lightly. “Is there a wrong one, Steve?”
, being in Barnes’ body has got me feeling-feeling-“ He threw up his hands in annoyance when he couldn’t seem to find the right word.
and gave him a small smile. “
,” Tony murmured. “
Bucky smiled gently as he sat up a bit more and tugged his t-shirt up over his head, setting it down on the floor beside them. Tony seemed to visibly relax, all the tension bleeding from his shoulders when he let his gaze settle upon the faint glow of the Arc Reactor. Bucky gave him a timid smile and tucked his legs slightly to the side , offering up some space for the genius to slip in next to him.
Tony pressed the heel of it against the cock now straining his jeans, lifting his hips up into it and

He exhaled shakily, pushing the button to call the elevator roughly and then again when it didn’t immediately open. He was scowling as the doors opened and then he was inside, the elevator taking him up the few floors to their apartment’s floor when he’d given the destination.
“It was no trouble,” Tony admitted and he was obviously delighting in the fact that there had been a steadily growing blush forming on his own damn cheeks and
to Bucky. “
Steve was smiling despite himself as he turned to look at the man. “You’re always working on a thousand things at once. I don’t know how you can focus on any one thing when you’ve got a dozen projects on the go.”
He stopped breathing, his heart practically sputtering in his chest and then he was shifting onto his side to reach for the box of tissued on the little table nearby. He wiped himself as clean as possible hastily with a desperate sort of urgency now. It didn’t take long for him to right his clothing either, tucking himself back gingerly into his briefs.
, which Bucky had just smirked and accepted without a word.
He felt rather winded, breathless in the face of his orgasm and he shook his head at himself. He glanced down at his come covered hand and made a curiously startled sound as he noted some of the pearly liquid splashed against his still quivering abs. He swallowed thickly at the sight. Tony was by no means a gym rat and yet he did manage to keep in exceptional shape with piloting the armour and his time in the workshop.
and Bucky let out a soft

to have you back, Buck. I told him how happy I was to be able to see you doing better, feeling good, smiling and laughing, just…
Bucky startled a little and glanced over at himself, blushing when he realized that Tony had clearly taken a shower and was wearing some of Steve’s clothes. His hair was still wet and pulled back into a loose bun and Bucky quickly looked away. He wondered if Tony would be able to tell that he had given himself a bit of relief in the shower and blushed even more at the thought.
Steve’s sharp gaze snapped up to Tony’s face and saw the absolute
Natasha huffed in amusement, "Ah, well to be honest with you. I think just coming out with it should do it. Preferably when he’s in his right body, though.”
“Tony,
Steve swallowed thickly and Bucky tried to ignore the sight of tears springing to the man’s eyes when he felt tears begin to gather in his own. “And,

. He grabbed the book he’d left on the kitchen table for something to do as he made his way back into the living room with a steaming cup of coffee and sat down on one of the oversized chairs.
“Don’t think I remember the last time I got drunk,” Bucky admitted thoughtfully and Tony hummed, relaxing back and making himself more comfortable.
lie to you, about anything.”
“Enough, James. I’m going to make sure I do everything in my power to help you with this, alright? I can get you a massage therapist, maybe even a physiotherapist if it’ll help. But I think you should let me help you with this. I can’t bear to think that you’re in this kind of pain all the time, it isn’t right. It’s not fair,” Tony told him sternly, his brows pinched up in concern.
Steve’s not really
Exasperated, he turned on the shower and let it run before grabbing a fresh towel and setting it on the hook by the door. Studiously avoiding the mirror and looking down at himself, he managed to divest himself of his shirt, pants and briefs and soon he was standing under the hot spray over the shower, still-
,” He murmured, pressing his lips to the man’s temple as he hugged him that much closer, having started rocking him gently in any attempt to comfort.
Steve hummed and sighed sleepily as he turned to rest more on his back, making sure the blanket didn’t fall as he did so. “
But over the months, Bucky had realized one horrible flaw in his master plan. Getting closer to Steve again was one thing when the blond kept giving him puppy-dog eyes and soft proud smiles, but getting closer to Tony was something he really hadn’t seen coming. What he hadn’t seen coming really, wasn’t the fact that he would grow closer to the genius, but the developing…uh,
anything for the people he cared about most, at least he didn’t think so, not like the things Tony did for them.
Tony guffawed, “5K! Are you crazy!? Are you trying to kill me?”
Tony hummed under his breath before he smirked over at Steve, raising an eyebrow and waggling it suggestively. “Gonna’ come and fool around with me?” He teased, and the moment the words left his mouth, he realized his mistake.
But of course that was ruined in the next moment and not necessarily by Tony’s next words, it was definitely the guilt that ruined it.
Tony did impressed Steve. He’d never say that
. He thought, mentally berating himself. For just a moment he really wanted to imagine the three of them together like that and he had to shut his eyes in an attempt to clear his head before he got too worked up by the thought.
The genius…in
Bucky swallowed hard and tried to find the right words. “I-I don’t need a physiotherapist or a massage therapist, Tony. I’m sorry, I have a really hard time letting strangers get close to me and I just-it’d be too hard,” Bucky told him.
Steve’s face finally came into view and he looked so worried and Bucky really did try to get his vision to settle, not enjoying the hazy quality whatsoever. “Tony, what's wrong? Are you okay?”
Bucky shook his head adamantly. “I-I’m alright, Stevie. I’m sorry. You should go back to Tony,” He tried to insist.
Steve bumped into Dum-E.
That didn’t last long. After he’d managed to wash his hair and face, he realized that he was going to have to touch the rest of him if he wanted to actually get properly clean. “For fuck’s sake,” He muttered, grabbing his loofa and pouring a bit of body wash on the pink puff.
Unable to help himself, he dropped the loofa in favour of taking a hold of the genius’ quickly hardening cock. He moaned softly and gave himself a firm stroke. His knees nearly buckled and he shut his eyes tightly for a moment or three.
He grimaced as he did so and then glanced down at the chaise, wondering if he’d gotten anything on the lush fabric. He hadn’t, thank goodness and looking down at his own self he was grateful not to have made a mess on that front either. So, he sat himself back down onto the chaise and let out a bone weary sigh. “And now I’m tired,” He muttered, bracing his elbows on his knees as he pressed his fingers against his temple perhaps rougher than necessary. “And feeling insanely guilty.”
, but this was all so confusing. Because Bucky wasn’t turned on at the sight of himself, he wasn’t. But Tony was forcing him to look at himself in a different light and it was
Tony arched a brow in obvious challenge and Bucky swallowed thickly. “I’m not lying to you…and it hurts that you think I

sound before he was crowding Tony back towards his desk.
“There, you’re starting to look a little more like me now,” Tony huffed and Bucky didn’t dare make a noise in response.
body looked up and met the soldier’s gaze...in
Bucky immediately righted himself, completely caught off guard by the man. He hadn’t even heard him come in and that-that was never a good sign. “Hey,” He replied, quickly getting up from his spot.
Steve huffed out a breath and nodded, “Right…I’ll get right on that.”
But, back to the espresso machine.
couldn’t resist looking to him.
and that-
And who was Steve? A soldier that had never given up the fight, never let himself settle down or at the very least, take a vacation. He kept himself busy, sure. There was always something he could be doing. Working out, drawing, reading, training, filing reports, holding briefings, missions, charity galas and press events. But he didn’t
Tony made soft noises of disagreement.
Bucky watched. Was helpless not to at this point. The bun wasn’t even half bad, considering Tony didn’t exactly have much practice with that sort of thing himself. “You know-” Bucky started, but had to clear his throat a bit before continuing. “That doesn’t look half bad.”
Tony frowned and came over to lean against the back of the couch. “It’s stupid…I’m sorry I bothered you. I’ll just try and go back to bed.”
there, and of course right at that moment, he heard Steve come into the apartment.
But every time Steve wordlessly placed a cup of whatever today’s drink was in front of the brunet, he would look up and catch Steve’s big round puppy-dog eyes…and then he’d sigh deeply, take a moment to pretend to think about it…and then promptly leave to deliver the coffee to Tony. And every time he came back to the kitchen, Steve would have an absurdly sweet coffee made for him in thanks.
Steve actually didn’t use it all that much…for
Tony had offered to give him a quick lesson on how to do it and Steve had watched, bewildered by the way the man worked the machine as if it were nothing more than an extension of himself. And really, Steve shouldn’t have been
Steve huffed and gently squeezed Tony’s biceps before letting go, letting his hands fall to his sides. “Okay, I’m terrible at this and for the record, this is also part of the problem.”
“Thank you,” Steve sighed, rubbing at his temple a little. “Now, I’m just going to go take a shower-“
Bucky’s gaze snapped to the man at that and found Tony staring down his-
So Bucky followed, followed him all the way up to the penthouse, which…Bucky had never been in before and even Steve and Tony didn’t seem to spend all that much time up here either. Which was a little odd, now that he thought about it.
“Please, Steve. I’m beggin’ you. My shoulder hurts and my back is aching something fierce.
“You’re going to march in there and lay it all out,” Bucky breathed, unaware that his hands had started to shake, that the tension in his shoulders was becoming near unbearable. “You’re going to tell them how you feel and you’re
The whole process barely took a moment, but Steve followed the tiny movement of his lips as they twitched at the corner and then Tony was exhaling shortly through his nose and taking the coffee. Nearly
“Is that so,” He said thoughtfully.
Natasha frowned and went to interject, but Bucky waved her off. “I’m gonna’ head up and try and get some sleep…actually, no. I’m going to go watch TV and try and distract myself from the fact that the two of them are sleeping together.”

“What do you want with us?” Tony blurted, obviously not having the slightest clue.
Soon they were both sufficiently distracted by lunch preparations and the like. “Well, I think I'm going to head down to the lab and see if I can't get some work done,” Tony informed them with a bit of a stretch as he stood.

Tony’s eyes widened and Steve just…stopped talking. “You…you said I was overwhelming and I-I thought that was a
Clint and Natasha just grinned knowingly at him and soon he was racing out of the kitchen and towards the safety of his apartment. As soon as he managed to lock himself in his bedroom, he lost it. He started hyperventilating and did everything in his power to keep his breathing under control. Easier said than done, of course.
Steve smirked, “Stuff's like water to Tony. His body is probably used to consuming twice that amount to function normally.”
Natasha smirked, “Been doing a bit of research I see?”
“Good, my poor heart was hurting just looking at you like that,” He teased and Bucky chuckled, getting down off the counter.
Bucky floundered. “What?”
Bucky took the offered bottle and pill and watched as Tony went to the kitchen and a moment later, reappeared with two crystal tumblers. “I know I can’t get drunk,” Tony admitted, a wry twist to his lips. “But right now…you can.”
But then he realized that there was a delicious sort of
with him, fighting alongside Tony in all his Iron Man glory.
He didn’t have to wait long and he held his breath when Steve’s dark gaze turned to him and in the same instant, the hand he’d let fall to the bed beside him, reached up to grab the base of his cock in a harsh grip, a terribly wonderful groan catching in his throat at the sight of
Steve’s brows creased as he watched his friend and he quickly shook his head. “
Bucky had been floored, even Steve had looked taken aback by the man’s words, but Bucky had told himself that he would do anything and everything from that moment onwards to help them be happy, to
Bucky nodded a bit, not really feeling all that hungry at the moment, but he supposed he could eat something…or get more coffee. He frowned a little at the errant thought. “Uh, sure. I’ll join you…also, does Tony live on coffee? Because I seriously want another like…five cups.”
He dragged the tips of his fingers up to the Reactor and gently trailed them across the mottled scar tissue there, pink mostly, with whiter spots and just like his own they were slightly raised. They were tender too, just like his. It made him a little sad, looking at the scaring there, thinking of his own as well, but Tony had
Maybe happiness isn’t so overrated after all.

He sat at the edge of his bed, hunched over, hands wound tightly in his shorter hair as he tried to ground himself.
when he went about teaching the Team how to use the new bits of tech. He was especially patient with Steve, at least, he thought so.
Clint hummed, “I guess so. He did have like, half a dozen cups of coffee though.”
Bucky made a

at the wood as if it held all the answers to the known universe. But he could hear movement on the other side and he quickly darted back down the hallway. He could ask Steve the question later, it seriously wasn’t important.
, clearly feeling uncomfortable. Bucky suspected the age thing was a bit of a sore spot for him, but he didn’t think it any good to dwell on something like that. “Whatever you say, Barnes,” Tony murmured eventually.
“ Bucky choked, his breathing coming in harsh pants as he stumbled his way across the hall to his best friend’s bedroom.
Natasha sighed, “You know that's not what I meant, Cap.”
“I love you, Steve…I-“ He exhaled roughly and shook his head. “Never stopped, even when I didn’t know who I was, I knew you, I knew I felt for you, knew I loved you.”
Steve made a soft noise of assent and took a step closer to the man. “It’s probably more my fault than anything…and I don’t just mean the kiss.”
Bucky stood outside Steve’s bedroom door for a split second, just…
” Bucky laughed. “You can’t tell me I’m the only one who thought that was hilarious,” Bucky nearly wheezed.

Tony let out a soft laugh at that and Steve cracked a small smile while trying to collect himself. “So…I don’t come down here often…because you and technology-well, it’s a lot, you know? You just…”
The rest of the group nodded and then Bruce cleared his throat timidly. “It might be worthwhile to maybe run a few tests. Take some blood samples and see if anything’s amiss?”
Steve huffed softly and Tony muttered, “Of course you did,” Under his breath and Bucky shook his head, fond and exasperated and a thousand and one other things.
-you’re okay, Buck. Shhh,” Steve murmured, wrapping his arms around his friend and cradling him tightly to his chest.
Steve faltered. Was-was he really going to do this? Was he actually going to
Tony guffawed and Bucky grinned. He was entirely unprepared for Tony to grab the towel from his hands and then proceed to smack his side with it. He yelped in surprise and darted away from the man, but he was grinning as he attempted to flee the bathroom. Tony was glaring but at least he was grinning too. So there was that.
“ He added. “And I felt like the biggest scummiest,
Bucky exhaled harshly and looked away, leaning forward to set his now empty glass on the coffee table. Leave it to Tony to hit the nail on the head, as it were. “Maybe, but I still shouldn’t have said that. It wasn’t fair ta’you.”

smiling at them both with such a deep look of longing on his handsome face and Bucky found himself reaching out for the man, Tony coming even closer and then they were
If he had, he would have seen the matching looks of despair and worry plastered across their faces.
Tony sighed and shook his head a bit, “When it’s really bad, please just let us know. I already talked to Steve about it. We both agree that it’s not fair that you're dealing with this on your own, James. We only want to help.”
To which, Bucky’s heart plummeted into his stomach and Natasha did not fail to see the absolutely crestfallen look on his face.
them to break up. They were too good together. They balanced each other out and just sort of worked, despite their hot-headed personalities. But of course Bucky was still licking his wounds and dealing with the aftermath of everything he had been through, Steve and Tony too, in their own ways. He imagined finding out that your old boyfriend whom you thought was dead was probably pretty shocking. Also finding out that your dad didn’t drink and drive and kill himself and his wife had to be a tough pill to swallow to. So he got it, they were all living in their own aftermath of sorts.
to stop the slow, hopeful smile from blooming on his lips and it wasn’t long before Tony’s were stretching into a tentative smile of his own. “Yeah?”
“I guess it’s interesting, in a way. Though I don’t really fancy lookin’ at myself most days, so it’s not really an appealing uh…
Bucky roamed the halls by himself until the wee hours of early morning. He still couldn't bring himself to return to their apartment even after he was sure Steve would have been up and gone for his morning run. He didn’t want to chance running into either of them before he was ready. Not that he thought he’d ever necessarily be ready.
Steve nodded a little, but clearly he looked a little nervous about the idea of sharing a bed with Bucky’s body. Maybe even apprehensive. “I promise no funny business,” Tony chirped, chuckling nervously as he met Bucky’s gaze, but Bucky could also tell that Tony looked worried and apprehensive himself.
. He relaxed, shoulders slumping slightly as he huffed out a tense breath. Tony watched him all the while, though he had taken a respectful step back as Steve tried to settle himself.
Steve groaned,
He had to readjust his draw string so that they didn’t fall off his more slender frame and with a heavy sigh, he made his way back out into the living room. Flopping down on the couch gracelessly, he asked Jarvis to lower the lights and then put on an episode of
“So, this must be hella’ awkward for you, buddy,” Clint huffed and Bucky grimaced, glancing over at the archer.
Tony shook his head and threw a nervous glance over to Bucky who was looking at him in uncomfortable silence. But Tony wasn’t stupid. Clearly Bucky had been dealing with a fair amount of pain in his metal arm and had chosen not to tell anyone about it. The pain, the dull ache in his bones where the metal joined was no doubt something that he’d been dealing with for

Bruce, Clint and Thor chuckled softly at her and Bucky sighed before pulling his face out of her grasp. She smiled at him in sympathy and shook her head, letting her hands fall to her lap as she observed him.
It never worked and when Steve could finally bring himself to look back up at his friend, Bucky’s attention would be turned elsewhere, usually sipping at his sweet coffee with an all too knowing tilt to his lips.
He threw himself in front of whatever spell Loki was tossing their way. Tony shouted, Steve shouted, the whole Team was in an uproar when the spell hit. The blinding green light enveloping both Bucky and Tony;
Steve whined and shifted his hips against the bed and Tony watched in awe as his cock jumped again, pre-come weaving a glistening thread between abs and its shiny head. “You wish Bucky were here, baby, I know,” Tony consoled and Steve whimpered, shutting his eyes against the sight the man made.
He quickly sucked in a breath before he pulled his t-shirt on, ignoring how it was too bug as well and headed out to see his friend. “Hey, Steve,” Bucky called. “How was your workout with Tony?” He asked as he came down the hall and into the living room.
Bucky turned around, stopping him from coming too far into his room and pressed his flesh and blood hand to the blond’s chest to stop him, ignoring the warmth of the man’s skin, the steady rise and fall of his chest, the beating of his heart beneath. Steve instantly stilled at his touch and met his friend’s darkened gaze. “I’m fine, Steve. I-I’m sorry I woke you. I’m sorry I interrupted you and Tony,” He apologized.
what?” Tony found himself asking, voice quiet, unsure.
Tony was smiling, but his eyes looked a little sad, a lot tired. “I think it had something to do with me working up the nerve to tell you that I love you, Buck,” Steve whispered.
Bucky frowned, unhappy with the fact that his body was giving Tony so much trouble. Thor had said that the spell should wear off in a couple of days and he wondered just how much longer he was going to have to let Tony suffer. Furthermore, he wondered why the
he alerted the man. Still, Steve would have enjoyed a moment to just stop and stare without Tony knowing…even if that was pretty creepy now that he thought about it.
Steve shuddered again and gripped the base of his cock a touch harder. “I-I’m-“
Tony scoffed, but he was smiling so Bucky didn’t take it too personally as he dipped his hands beneath the cool water and then splashed some on his face. “You know, I could give you some of my clothes so you don’t have to wear stuff that’s too big for you,” Tony offered and Bucky cast him a curious look as he was handed a towel, to which Bucky pressed to his now damp face as he shut off the tap.

Meanwhile, Bucky was battling with guilt of his own.
. “I dunno, I mean, yeah it’s weird. But they’ll be back to themselves soon enough,” He told her with a bit of a shrug.
Steve had his hand wound in the genius’ hair, gently stroking and running his fingers through his long locks absentmindedly. Bucky wished it could really be what it looked like. Him, in his own body with Steve caressing him like that. He frowned slightly and looked away and tried to focus on the rest of the film.
Eventually he just couldn’t take it anymore and got up. He was pretty sure the pair didn’t know he was in his room and he made a big deal of shutting his ensuite bathroom door loud enough so that they could hear it. Hopefully they would think he had been in the shower or something and not secretly listening to them.
Steve shook his head but Tony could already see his resolve thinning. “
Tony had insisted upon meeting him that Bucky was welcome in their home, in their lives and when Bucky had tried to make Tony understand all of the terrible things he had done, the genius had simply given him a tiny smile and told him that it was never his choice to do those things. He didn’t need to punish himself for things entirely out of his control.
Tony laughed and realized his mistake and quickly moved to sit next to him instead, sighing deeply as he did so. “Sorry, Barnes.”
Tony shook his head, but his eyes were kind, wide open and adoring. “Yeah?”
Tony smiled a little as Bucky huffed in amusement, “I-it might help me sleep…if I could see the light. Would it be okay if we cuddled and you uh-“
Tony followed, maybe not as fast, but just about. Unfortunately Steve had already shut the door on him, locked it, too. “
“It’s okay, Steve,” Tony shrugged and he was smiling at Steve now but it was all wrong. “I get it, alright?”
Steve just smiled, shrugging lightly as he made to pull back, to give him more space. Tony didn’t let him, his hands quickly gripping the front of his too tight t-shirt and keeping him right where he wanted him.
Bucky frowned at him, shaking his head a bit as if to clear it. “Yeah, punk. Who else would it be?” He huffed and tried to get up again and this time Steve let him, looking completely at a loss.
Steve’s smile was wistful. “Bucky…” Steve said slowly. “I mean
Tony gave him a nervous smile, gaze sweeping over him, assessing. “Did you try and go back to sleep at all?”
fault, but then he quickly became distracted by the whirring of the metal plates and his eyes fell to it with something like wonder reflected in their grey-blue depths. “It's not permanent,” Thor reminded them. “It usually only lasts a couple of days. I’ve seen this spell before. I am so very sorry for what my brother has done,” Thor apologized.
Bucky sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose, “Don’t start with that again. He’s got Tony, he doesn’t need me. I’m just his friend.”
He had a job to do before he let his brain get the better of him and send him in to a spiral of worry and anxiety. He could totally do this.
-flickered up to fix on his and Bucky swore his heart stopped for an instant. “I think…” Tony said slowly, voice gone a touch softer but gaze no less than piercing. “That there’s plenty of nice things to look at,” He finished and Bucky swallowed past the sudden lump in his throat when Tony placed the metal hand against his thigh and-
He’d been a little more than distracted by the man’s cock in the shower than the Arc Reactor…but now?
Bucky and Tony quickly looked down at themselves, eyes wide and of course they started to panic. Who
He inwardly grimaced, would have outwardly done so too if it weren’t for the glorious sight that greeted him. Tony…TonyTony
He does, however, still struggle with some of the appliances littered throughout the compound. He can use the stove in the apartment he shares with Bucky…and the microwave, the simple coffee maker they have and the kettle. He can use the waffle iron and the grill they sometimes use. What he does struggle with, is the fancy coffee maker in the communal kitchen.
and Bucky stammered apologizes as he averted his eyes and quickly backtracked out of the room, tugging his friend’s door shut hard behind him.
“You have such a nice ass,” Tony sighed and Steve shot him an embarrassed glance as he made himself more comfortable, back against the pillows.
“I take it back,” Tony gasped, tipping his head back and exposing his throat as Steve nipped and pressed wet sucking kisses along his jaw, Tony’s neatly trimmed facial hair creating a wonderfully interesting sensation against his lips. “You’re
with delight. “Come on now…Stevie.”
Steve shivered and nodded, letting his hand firmly grasp his cock. He managed a couple of strokes without closing his eyes, gaze roving over the picture Tony made sitting in his reading chair. Bucky’s body was on display like that, legs spread and shoulders back, the picture of commanding and Steve groaned at the sight and stroked himself faster, tighter.

Tony’s eyebrows shot up as he watched his lover shake his head and start biting his lower lip in that all too nervous tick of his. Now Tony was really damn curious. “
Tony gave him a weak smile and slipped in beside him, gently pillowing his head against the brunet’s chest, splaying his left hand gently beneath the Arc Reactor. Bucky smiled nervously and let his arm slip around the genius’ shoulder, holding him close. They chatted absentmindedly for a while, just curled up together like that. Not about anything of real importance, really; mostly about the show and who their favourite characters were.
Loki had done this in the damn first place. He sighed deeply at the thought and shook his head, turning over onto his side to grab his book from the nightstand.

Tony grunted, pushing himself up a bit and Bucky let out an

after all. How would you even test for something like that, anyway?” Bucky tried desperately.
And there was Loki standing with his back to the windows and grinning deviously at both Steve and Thor and now the rest of the group as they filtered. Tony and Bucky were the first and foremost to step into the fray but Thor hastily stepped in front of them. “Don't get involved!” Steve warned them both from behind them and Thor nodded gravely, turning his attention back to his brother.
There was a soft thunk against the wood of the door and Tony frowned, knowing that Steve was probably pressing his forehead against it. So, he did the same and he knew Steve would be able to hear it just as he had.
“You are
Bucky swallowed, not at all pleased that Tony had told Steve. But he couldn't help the little flutter in his chest at the thought of the two of them caring enough about him to offer to give him a bit of relief in the form of a massage. Instead of finding the right words to thank Tony, he simply nodded and then a moment later the elevator dinged and a chorus of voices could be heard coming towards the kitchen.
Tony huffed softly and rolled his eyes…a reaction Bucky had not expected. “
. Because of course despite the panic of having walked in on something so private, he was ridiculously turned on and he was a weak, weak man.
Tony sighed softly and turned to face him more, still cradling his cup of coffee. Bucky calmly turned to face the genius better and left his sandwich for a moment. “Why didn’t you tell anyone that you’re in pain?” Tony asked him gently.
He wasn’t prepared for the genius to suddenly turn to him and give him a stern look and Bucky quickly realized that all those times Tony had called him out on making a

Natasha nodded gently, “Alright, night Barnes.”
“Bucky, you don’t have to go. I can give you both some privacy. I know what nightmares can be like, you don’t have to suffer on your own,” Tony tried worriedly, following him down the hall with Steve in tow.
To see Tony touching-touching his mother’s things, something Tony himself cherished so deeply clearly…with Bucky’s meta-
Just what had he gotten himself into, he wondered.
there’s nothing to be sorry for, love. This was my fault, I shouldn’t have pushed, okay? Please don’t feel bad, baby,” Tony tried to console and Steve only let out a desperately wounded sound.
It wasn’t more than five-minutes before he could clearly hear the sound of himself practically
in the middle of the night.
that about him. He thought it would make him feel coddled in the beginning and the first couple of times Tony had tried to teach him something new, he had bristled and denied needing assistance. That had lasted all of an afternoon when Steve had nearly beat himself over the head with his StarkBook. He couldn’t even login to the damn thing in the beginning.
Bucky groaned softly and nodded, “Yeah, just a touch. Thinking about them sharing a bed is really fuckin’ with me.”
“Y-you are?” He barely dared to whisper, his voice choked, hoarse.
Steve sees you in.”
“Hey, Steve? I wanted to ask you a quest-“ Bucky’s breath caught, words stalling in his chest at the sight that met him.
He found he couldn’t truly look away, not even if he wanted to right then. Bucky was so hard and right there, so damn close and Steve wanted him, wanted him so badly. He wanted
with tension, wanting to come, but Bucky wanted to drag this out just a bit longer.
For a time, he had been nothing but supportive of their relationship from the moment he found out, but inwardly he was fighting with the pain it had brought him. He and Steve were together, once upon a time. But that time had long since passed and even though he was still Bucky…he sort of wasn’t anymore. He was different now,
Steve didn’t have to be told twice.
“So,” Tony tried and Steve knew he was being side-eyed so he didn’t try to meet the man’s gaze, instead forced himself to keep looking at the screen displaying Peter’s suit. “You aren’t usually the one to bring me my coffee…”

Bucky laughed a bit, “Shit, didn't know I was so heavy.”

Tony sighed softly. “Yeah,

Tony blinked and then grinned. “Yeah,
Steve smiled from his seat at the kitchen island and Tony went to lean down to give him a little kiss but of course the look of startled surprise on Steve’s face had him pulling up short as he remembered himself. “Uh, I’ll see you later Cap,” He said instead, abruptly pulling away.
So of course then Thor started yelling, his booming voice reverberating off the walls of the living room and then there was the all too familiar sound of Loki’s laughter to follow. Immediately everyone was up and on their guard, rushing out into the living room to see what could possibly be going on.
for me, I guess?”
. The only way you’ll get me to shut up is if your cock is in my mouth.”
Bucky grimaced slightly and shook his head, not bothering to try and lie. “Nah, decided to just wander for a bit. I think I'm gonna go make breakfast though. Can I make you something? Pancakes? Coffee?” He tried to distract.
His suspicions were further confirmed when Tony shifted to bare his throat and spritzed some of it near his right side. Bucky finally managed to get in a breath and it sounded slightly wheezy to his own ears and he could only imagine what it must have sounded like to Tony.
“Oh, you know,” Tony shrugged, reaching out with his left hand to swipe at a few screens to clear them. “A little of this, a little of that. I wanted to add a few things to Peter’s suit and I have plans for a new repulsor design I want to get moving on, new StarkPhone’s in the works over there-“ He gestured to somewhere over Steve’s shoulder. “And you know, those new arrows for Clint and-and why are you shaking your head at me?”
