He finally opened his eyes when he felt a faint tickling sensation. Tony was leaning over him, swiping a finger through the mess on his stomach and chest. He groaned at the sight alone as Tony licked his fingers. The tender skin was oversensitized so that even the the soft glide of Tony’s finger over it was almost overwhelming.
Tony’s expression only further drove the point home as he looked Steve up and down. “I will never, ever get tired of that.”
The other end still holding his still rock-hard cock against its underbelly writhed against him, as though rewarding him for his efforts. He moaned as he continued to hold his legs open. It wasn’t long before he felt the creature’s legs delve between his ass cheeks; some of them spreading him as others delved deeper toward his entrance.
“Tony, listen to me,” he said, intentionally using a bit of his mission command voice. Sure enough, Tony didn’t immediately respond with a quick retort. “Making sure something like this doesn’t happen again should be a team effort. It shouldn’t involve you locking yourself up in the workshop to work through your guilt.”
Suddenly a light clicked on and Tony felt the body that was now under him move. He tried to turn around, except he couldn’t between the hangover and his general confusion. Tony could feel panic rising up like bile in his throat.
And then Tony leaned forward, covering Steve with his warmth. It was an awkward angle, what with Steve’s swollen abdomen in the way, but Tony was able to hold himself up by the armrests and settle over Steve’s chest. He smiled down at Steve.
Bruce didn’t look appeased by that answer. “Tony… you know this whole thing isn’t your fault, right? I’m the one that wanted to keep the specimen.”
So Steve had decided to let the man share his little capsule with him for the night. Which was crazy, he knew. For all he knew this man was a serial killer, though Steve seriously doubted it. Bucky would’ve smacked him across the head back when he was taller than Steve for doing something like this. Bucky always told him he had a hero complex with his need to save people. And, well, if that was the case, then so be it.
Steve nodded. He settled back and watched as Tony closed his eyes and started to finger himself open. As Tony moaned and gasped and shuddered above him, he wished he could reach up and kiss him or just pull him against his chest or something. But he felt so sluggish, all of his energy seemingly sapped by the heavy weight in his abdomen. It was nice, though. With the serum he always felt like he had an excess of energy. For the first time he could remember, he was able to just relax and let go in a way he never had before.
“Um, I’m not sure.” Steve glances around, as though that’ll help him. “You said the problem’s pretty bad, right? So probably at least an hour or two.”
Tony grinned. “Well, since you’ve asked so nicely.” He brought up a hologram showing what must have been some of the designs for the nanites. “The whole point of using nanotech like this is that it’s very flexible. It’s pretty easy to design nanites to play nicely with human body chemistry. That flexibility is what we need in this situation. They can form up into larger structures and change shape as needed to move throughout the body.”
With his arms on the armrest supporting him, Tony started pushing back down onto Steve’s cock. Leaning over him and being this close meant that Tony’s cock rubbed against Steve’s abdomen.
He can hear Steve huff out a laugh. “Of course it does. You think of everything, don’t you?” There’s a genuine sense of wonder in his tone that renders Tony speechless, for once. “Good thing I restocked my medical supplies before we headed out.” Another chuckle. “Guess I’m just as much of a boy scout as you’ve always said.”
The man must mistake Tony’s look of horror for distress because he steps closer. “You look like you’re running a fever.”
Steve hit the mat with an “oof” and found himself on his back and pinned by Natasha seconds later. She didn’t look pleased about getting the better of him, either.
Tony chuckled as he continued to run soothing circles over Steve’s stomach. “Sounds like you’re almost there.”
“That’s helpful, but not something you should be worrying right now. You should probably get out of there, Cap.”
Chuckling, Tony moved his hand down to grip Steve’s chin. “Please what? This isn’t enough for you already?” Steve watched Tony’s gaze trail down to the alien writhing against his chest and further down, to his red, oversensitive cock. “You really are insatiable, Cap.”
“Fuck,” he panted as he watched Steve open his legs for the creature like a desperate animal in heat.
Steve winced. Right, that had happened his first week moving on. Tony had just laughed his head off and built a new, improved one.
Tony rubbed his chin as he considered his question. “Guess I overdid it, huh?” He gave Steve a shy smile. “Well… I wanted to win something for you, but I guess this is a bit too much, huh?”
Bucky sighs. “Oh, please. I see how hard you work. Don’t think I don’t appreciate what you do for me. But come on, Steve. Everyone deserves a break.”
“Yeah?” Steve pushes his hand back against the swell of Tony’s abdomen and they both groan. “Feels good to be all filled up?”
Tony huffed out a laugh. He really did have the sassiest AI. “Yeah, I had a feeling it was something like that.”
Tony wants to protest, but Steve is right. As unpleasant as it’s going to be, his injury needs to be addressed. He leans back against the wall and sighs. “Sure. If you don’t mind helping me out?”
Steve slides his hand back from Tony’s waist to caress the curve of his belly. Tony shudders at the sensation against his sensitive, stretched skin. “It’s a lot,” he answers softly.
Steve shut his eyes and glanced away. He couldn’t stand to have Tony look at him like that. Shame rose up in him, which somehow only aroused him more. His already over sensitized cock hardened even further in the alien’s grasp. He let out a moan despite himself.
“Even stuffed full of nanites, you’re a damned menace,” Tony said as he shook his head. He stepped forward and ran a gloved hand along Steve’s leg, moving up toward his abdomen. “Let me help you.” His hand settled softly on the still sizeable curve of Steve’s belly. “Can’t let you do all of the work, after all.”
After counting to 3 in his head, Tony slowly let his eyes open. He wasn’t assaulted by bright light like he expected to be. Instead, the room was dark. He was almost tempted to go back to sleep when he heard a sound behind him. As he tried to turn around, though, his right side hit a wall, which was… odd. He blinked a few times to get his bearings and let his eyes settle.
Across the table Steve averted his gaze, clearly embarrassed. “My rank in the army was captain, and when my students found out, well… that’s what they started calling me. And it stuck. Even some of the adults in town started using it,” he said with a sigh.
“You know what? Maybe we should table this conversation for later,” spilled out of Steve’s mouth before he could stop himself.
“Not your fault,” Steve said as he shut the locker. “Like I said, I overslept. So… I guess I’m free.” His eyes roved over Tony for a moment before he added, “Don’t you want to go back to your hotel and change?”
That was how he’d found himself wandering around who-the-fuck-knows-where neighborhood in Tokyo, doing his best to not trip over his own feet. There weren’t many people out this late, and those that were tended to be men similarly indisposed or groups of women that just ignored him. It was weird, to say the last. Not at all like what Tony remembered being drunk in New York or Boston was like. It was like no one here really cared if you were stumbling around the street. It was a good thing and a bad thing, he supposed.
“I’m well aware, but...” Bruce rubbed at his forehead in annoyance. “I still feel like I should’ve known better.”
Steve did as he was told, heading around into a part of the workshop he hadn’t paid much attention to before. When he finally found Tony, he stopped dead in his tracks.
It’s a mark of how tired Tony is that he doesn’t even bother pushing himself up to get a better view of Steve’s ass.
“You’re shitting me,” Tony says as he idly swirls the tumbler of whiskey in his hand. “There’s an explanation for whatever the hell happened in that elevator?” He finally looks up to find his friend Bruce glancing at him over the top of his glasses from the couch a few feet away.
Crossing his arms, Tony leaned back against the wall. “I’m afraid I can’t let you go in. JARVIS is reporting a likely biohazard situation. Your suit is built for a lot of situations, but hazmat isn’t one of them.”
Caught between so many sensations, Steve felt like he was building up to something amazing. As the creature kept teasing at his asshole, he rutted against its underbelly and cried out in pleasure as sweet liquid dripped down his chin and neck.
Steve pulled him close. “And you’re hot when you’re planning ridiculous things like putting nanites in my rear.” He cut off Tony’s laughter as he kissed him.
By the time JARVIS called him down to the workshop, he had already been debating giving in a third time. He breathed a sigh of relief as the workshop’s doors opened for him.
Chuckling, Tony took another sip of his drink. “So you arrived late last night and then ran into my sorry ass, huh?”
Tony breathed a sigh of relief in the armor as he uncrossed his arms. Even with that assurance from JARVIS, he couldn’t bring himself to drag his gaze away from Steve’s unconscious body lying on the room’s only cot.
“Yeah?” Tony’s content to enjoy how utterly overwhelmed Steve is until he feels a large, warm hand around his own dick. “Oh,
Tony glanced up at him with lidded eyes. “How about you take off your shirt, and then we can get started?”
Tony swiveled his seat back toward the holographic screens displaying the project he’d been working on. “No naps today, J. Once I finish this, I’ll turn in.”
“That’s it,” Tony said encouragingly. And then Steve felt Tony’s fingers against his hole and suddenly the egg was halfway out, much faster than the previous two had gone. “Just helping you out here a little, okay?”
Tony floats back into consciousness slowly. The first thing he notices is that he’s warm all over—to the point that it’s somewhat uncomfortable. His limbs feel heavy, too. He curls up further against himself, but that doesn’t feel right. It feels like he had way too much to eat before sleeping, which doesn’t make any sense…
“Oh shut up.” Steve rolled Tony over so that he was on top of him. “Look, can we agree that we’ve both been idiots over the past few days?”
He hadn’t even really known what to expect when he signed up. He’d ended up being assigned to this tiny village somewhere in south Japan, yet despite growing up a city boy, he’d settled in nicely. The townspeople seemed to treat them as some kind of foreigner mascot; he was pretty sure by now that he knew everyone in the small town.
Steve felt his cock twitch just at the thought of it. Generally, Tony declaring he had any plans in the context of the bedroom led to very good nights for Steve.
The creature responded by turning its antennae toward Steve, which tickled when they touched his bare arms. He couldn’t help it, he started laughing—harder than he had in a long time. Next thing he knew, he was on his back on the floor, still laughing, the creature crawling along his arm. It still tickled, but as what he assumed was the creature’s head crept closer, the nature of the tickling sensation started to change.
Even with the current precautions, Tony couldn’t help feeling uneasy. As he watched Steve head into the lab itself, though, he knew there wasn’t anything he could do about things now. His mind made up, he headed for the observation room.
Steve shook his head. “It’s fine, Doctor Banner. No need to keep apologizing. I knew the possible dangers when I went in to deal with the threat.” Well, okay, he thought he’d considered all of the possible dangers. He couldn’t be blamed for not anticipating the actual situation. “It sounds like I’m fine, and the whole mess has been cleaned up, right? No harm done.”
“You said you can get a distress signal working, even through this blizzard, with the armor, right?”
“What if there was a way to help you heal up faster, so you could get us out of here and not have to worry about an infection?”
By the time it reached his entrance, Steve was moaning, sweat running down the side of his face. He was riding a fine line between pleasure and pain to the point that he wasn’t sure he could tell the difference between them anymore. All he knew was that he wanted more as he kept straining his muscles.
Tony pushes the musty blanket off of himself and can only stare at the sight before him. His abdomen is huge, bulging outward noticeably. He reaches a hand down to run over the curve of his belly and shudders at how sensitive the stretched skin feels. When he moves to sit up, he can feel his entire gut shift. Steve wasn’t kidding when he said that he came a lot. And damn if that isn’t hot. Tony’s dick certainly agrees, and he’s tempted to give it some attention when he remembers where he is.
Sliding an arm around him, Tony rested his head right behind his ear. “You haven’t felt me enough, tonight?” He reveled in the way Steve shivered against him.
Steve blinked at him, turning his head against the table that was slick with his sweat now. “What’s the fun way?”
Steve slung the duffel bag behind his back and stepped closer to the man. “You have a room on the third floor? I can help you up there.”
Tony just stared for a moment as it dawned on him that Steve didn’t know who he was. He remembered when he’d succeeded his father as head of the company, news and popular magazines wouldn’t shut up about him. Yet here was this guy he’d found halfway across the world who had no earthly idea who he was. And he still wanted to hang out with him for some reason.
What he doesn’t expect is a handsomely dressed stranger in rose-tinted sunglasses leaning against his door frame.
,” Steve cried as his orgasm kept going. All of those legs stroking just prolonged it. He was making a mess of himself and the creature, his come spattering across its legs and underbelly and Steve’s own chest that the creature was also wrapped around. Never in his life would he have imagined that anything could feel like
Before Tony can answer, he hears a growl right next to his ear. He turns his head to see that Steve is glaring at the elevator panel.
The next few minutes are a blur after Steve gently sets Tony down against the wall next to the door. Steve wastes no time getting the door closed again and moving around what seems to be the cabin’s single room. Tony feels useless just sitting here. He could at least start a fire. On the other hand, the ache all down his back is getting worse. Seems like a good time to just rest his eyes, instead.
The bizarre spiral shape was slowly uncoiling, revealing itself to be some kind of insect with a long body and, Steve noticed when he looked closer at how it was moving across the floor, a ton of legs. What was most alarming about it was its size; what he assumed was its head was larger around than his arm and its actual length was difficult to assess with most of it still coiled together.
The man gives him a bright smile that lights up his devastatingly handsome face. “The one and only.”
Upon reaching the elevators, he impatiently jabs the down button and groans when he sees one elevator coming all the way up from the 40th floor. This is what he gets for building something with 96 floors. Naturally, Stark Tower’s elevators are fast and comfortable. Right now, though, with how Tony’s stomach is starting to cramp, he would jump out of a window if it would get him home faster instead of killing him.
“It did,” Steve says softly, and god, that tone goes straight to Tony’s poor heart. Steve’s brow creases with worry. “You aren’t uncomfortable?”
Bruce glanced up at him as he put his glasses back on. He looked tired, but not necessarily worried.
Steve groaned, burying his head into the warm pillow as Tony continued to work his hand on his cock. The slide of Tony’s hand was slick and easy thanks to the amount of lube, precome, and come that had built up over the series of Steve’s half dozen orgasms in the past couple of hours. In the back of his mind, beyond the pleasure that was singing through his nerves at the moment, he actually felt somewhat guilty. Tony had fucked him three times with dildos of increasing size, then fucked him with his own cock, and then after that he’d sucked him off twice. And yet more than two hours after they had started, Steve was still worked up and horny as hell. His refractory period was still under five minutes, and Steve himself felt like he’d never be satisfied.
“Oh, um, well…” Bruce glanced away, removing his glasses again. “From what Tony told me, he was worried that the creature was hurting you. So his top priority was extracting you from its hold as quickly as possible.”
A voice in the back of his head was telling him that he should be embarrassed. Ashamed, even. Like this,
“Oh yeah, I remember that’s why I didn’t even know your name.” Steve smiled into his own cup of coffee. “Do you remember where you might’ve left it?”
The creature’s legs pushed against the tight muscle of his entrance. The cool slick from earlier coated the legs pushing into his ass, easing the way. At first they were just teasing at the muscle, getting it to gradually loosen. Steve let out a groan of relief when they finally pressed in. He rocked back and opened his legs wider while crying out shamelessly for more.
Panicking, Steve glanced around hoping no one had heard the sudden outburst. The room remained just as silent before and Steve let himself take a deep breath to relax. He glanced down at the man he’d been dragging around since he’d found him on earlier.
“I’m fine,” he insisted. And he was. Even if it had hit him with some dangerous chemical, he’d either heal from any damage it caused or his metabolism would take care of it.
“Well, fuck me, then.” The man seemed to deflate at that as he let his head lean back to hit the door. His eyes were closed, and Steve couldn’t help the feeling of pity that welled up inside of him.
“I’ll be monitoring you, okay? Just in case anything happens. And I’m still applying sealant to the suit.”
“God, Tony. You really are full.” He pushes his hand against Tony’s swollen belly, and Tony’s answering moan is music to his ears. “You’re taking me so well. Such a good omega. Letting me fill you up like this.” His omega. His perfect, wonderful omega.
“Good, good,” Tony said in a soothing tone. “Almost done, champ. You’re doing so well for me. Taking so much like this.” He was still gently stroking the stretched skin of Steve’s abdomen. “Getting so big like this. Damn, you’re really something else.”
Tony raises an eyebrow at him. “Well, I seem to be recovered. So get up on here.” He checks the cabin’s single window on the other side of the door. There’s nothing but white outside, which means the blizzard is still going. He scoots back on the cot and raises the blanket in invitation. “Come on. And take off that uniform. It’s gotta be uncomfortable by now.”
The whole scene made Tony’s skin crawl. Yet at the same time, he could feel his cock hardening in his pants. Sure, the situation was fucked up, but it was also really fucking hot. As much as he hated himself for admitting it, Tony was getting off to watching Steve fall under the influence of whatever the hell this thing’s pheromones were doing.
“Are you okay?” Steve asked in Japanese, hoping that the man could understand his very American accent.
Steve shuts the door in the man's face and slams the chain-lock into place. His phone is still lying on the arm of the couch where he left it; he scoops it up, unlocks it, and finds Tony's number, hitting the call button with more force than necessary, but Tony needs to know someone is trying to take his son so Steve can't spare a concern about the welfare of his phone's screen.
The interviewer’s smarmy smile vanishes in an instant as Natasha’s eye narrow. The people around them turn, gasping and shouting when a sharp
“It’s worth it if it makes you happy,” replies Tony on a soft whisper, with a kiss pressed tenderly to Steve’s shoulder, and he knows it’s a cliché but it’s also so fucking true. “I promise I won’t resent you for this decision. I’ll be able to handle having to deal with him until we’ve got our – our baby, oh fuck, our
Natasha cocks her head to the side. “I thought he seemed a little...lonely over the past couple of days. I suppose his oldest best friend giving him the cold shoulder would explain it, especially when combined with the fact the love of his life was
One date turns into two, and Steve knows it’s fast, knows it’s much too soon, but he’s absolutely falling harder than he’d fallen for even Brock. The four years spent with Brock, thought he was in love with Brock, feel like nothing compared to what he feels for Tony now, as if they’ve known each other for their entire lives, as if time apart goes too slow and time together goes too fast. When he doesn't have Peter, Tony can usually be found in Steve's apartment, and weirdly, it doesn't feel like an intrusion, it feels like Tony
They haven't gotten more than five steps from the stand when Steve feels the first drops hitting his head. He breathes in slowly, ignores the fact that fruit juice and, most likely, slobber are now in his hair. Peter's having fun, and they're getting healthy snacks. That's what's important.
“Figured if we were going to do anything about, well, us, it would be better to do it in the comfort of our own home and away from prying eyes.”
And Tony can't ever really avoid answering when Rhodey uses that tone. So he lets it out in a bumbling, rambling mess of words, none of which makes sense to himself at all, but evidently, it makes enough sense for Rhodey, because he doesn't question further.
She finished by pressing her hand gently to his lower torso; her voice took on an otherworldly quality, echoing faintly in the silence of the room. The golden wisps surrounded Steve fully, and he closed his eyes against the brightness. The light faded slowly, gave way to the flickering candle flames. He sought out Tony in the dimness, and his partner smiled, a sweet curve of his lips. Loki helped Steve to his feet. The blond closed his robe as Tony stripped. Frigga repeated the process on Tony’s nude body, and Steve found it nearly impossible to tear his gaze away from the sight before him. At the queen’s signal, Tony stood, dressed, and Loki stepped forward and handed her a bag. She thanked her son and tugged gently on the drawstring. Steve felt his face flooding with heat when he saw what she pulled from the depths of silk.
“I feel like your own personal Ken doll, here for you to dress up at your every whim,” Steve says with a slight quirk of his lips.
Everybody dreams. It’s a fact of life. Even babies dream while they sleep, according to some experts. So, the fact that Steve has had dreams as long as he can remember… That’s nothing new. It’s what happens inside the dreams that seems to be the cause of his ma’s worry and doctor’s wonderings.
“We need to make sure thisー this dream or vision or whatever, doesn't actually happen,” Steve announces, and the others nod or murmur their agreement. “I think we need to draft a version of the, what were they called?, Accords that we can live with.”
Steve smiles wryly, without any humour. “I never thought I’d live long enough. Basically, a wife and children? Not on my list of priorities to worry about. It always seemed like it was too much to ask for on top of praying I’d either die to escape the pain of always being sick and my body trying desperately to give up, or that I’d somehow, miraculously, recover from the latest illness without issue.”
“Sorry, Petey-bug, it's okay, go back to sleep. You're safe.” He glances over his shoulder at Happy whose expression goes from appraising to blank the instant he notices Steve’s attention. “Want me to just carry him to your car?”
The look Tony gives him is unreadable, and he huffs and leans down to rest his forehead against Steve's. “How are you even real?”
me if something happened to Peter, and while I’m sure most moms and dads make the same threat, you’re the first I’ve ever met who I’ve never doubted would actually follow through. It’s obvious how much you love him, Tony, and how great of a father you really are.”
From: Tony (18:33) I can't tell you how relieved I am that you made my son's well-being such a high priority
Natasha’s eyes flick in his direction, but besides that small movement, she doesn’t twitch a muscle. “You sure, Steve?”
Tony smiles and puts his phone down. Unfortunately, within minutes, his brain is wandering away from the board meeting and toward new designs for the armour, weapons systems for the War Machine, upgrades to make the holographic interfaces even faster and easier to use. The meeting ends, thankfully without Tony dying of boredom; he waits until the last board member leaves the room before turning to Pepper. She has a contemplative, appraising expression on her face and a soft smile on her red lips.
, and the woman stretches to full-height. Her hair shifts minutely as if brushed by a small breeze, but the air is still. Steve takes in the sight of her, from her bare feet up her long legs to the elegantly uneven hemline of her gown that falls to the middle of her thighs. He focuses next on her face, on which an enormous smile sits.
Tony toes off his shoes inside the front door and makes his way to the bedroom. As soon as he opens the door, soft music begins to play, and he freezes at the sight of what's in his bed. Steve lounges against the pillows, body on display, illuminated and shadowed by the multitude of candles flickering on the dresser and night stands, curves and soft lines framed by thin lace. The swells of his breasts threaten to spill from the cups of the teddy; a small scrap of fabric comprises what can only be a thong. On his feet are a pair of strappy black heels. Tony can't stop the twitch of his cock, the fact his mouth starts watering, or the small whimper that escapes him. Steve bites his bottom lip, beckons Tony closer. Tony goes immediately, stripping as he crosses the room.
Tony ignores the rest of what the AI is saying, opting instead to drop into his chair and let his head bang on the desk’s surface.
Peter manages half a small bowl of soup before he slumps onto his side on the floor, spoon bouncing off the carpet a couple times before landing a few inches away. Steve clears away the bowl and burger wrappers while Tony carries his child to bed. When he comes back out, Steve's waiting on the couch, and Tony flops down next to him.
Tony sighs and struggles to sit up. “As I was saying, in my defence, I’ve only been here since six-thirty this morning.”
Peter is already completely naked by the time Steve turns around. Steve hesitates but ultimately merely steps aside for the kid to clamber into the tub. Peter immediately drops to sit on his knees, hands wiggling under the water. Steve decides to let him play a bit since he seems to be having fun, and all that he’s heard about kids is they either hate being in the water and scream the entire time, or they absolutely love being in the water and scream when it’s time to get out. After a few minutes, he grabs the cup from the counter and sits on the edge of the tub.
afterward. The crude jokes never bothered Tony; he seemed to bask in the attention. Thankfully, it only happened once.
“I don’t know. I feel bad. The only reason he asked me, of all people, is because he was in a rush because of some emergency. Besides, it’s not like Peter’s a bad kid. It’s like being paid for doing basically nothing. And I told him not to pay me. So he shouldn’t have tried.”
“Yeah, tomorrow morning. Hopefully, somethin' happens, because I don't think I can stand to see Peter like this any more.”
The shower he takes is short, barely enough time for the water to warm up to the temperature he usually likes it at. Steve doesn't bother dressing once he's dried his body ー he just climbs unsteadily into bed, tugs the comforter up over his shoulders, and falls asleep almost immediately.
Steve wakes in his bed, the sun shining brightly through the window. He still remembers how it felt to fall asleep on the beach with Tony in his arms, held close to his chest as the waves lulled them to sleep, smelling nothing but saltwater, the faint traces of liquor, and Tony's aftershave.
“I… I was in the workshop with Tony, and You and Dum-E were fighting over a tool, I guess, and Tony, Tony was
“No one else can get in without your permission,” she assures him as they cross the threshold, “not even Tony. Unless it’s an emergency, such as you slipping in the shower and knocking yourself unconscious or if you’re being attacked.”
“I understand. I do. But maybe you should either accept that you’ll probably fight over this, or accept the fact that you won’t ever have children because you didn’t want to rock the boat.”
“I can’t help it. He’d still be here if I’d focused more on reaching for him, pulling him to safety, instead of that HYDRA agent.”
“He and I already had this talk, so let’s skip it, okay? Let’s just go off the assumption that I want what he wants.”
“Hi, Miss Hill, it's Steve Rogers. Uh, Peter Parker isn't feeling very well today, so he won't be in school.”
Tony groans. “How do I even bring it up? ‘Hey, Steve, just want you to know the private conversation you had with Natasha? Yeah, not so private. So, you want to have kids with me? Are you fucking
Tony relents, nods, but Steve doesn't look away from the stretch of white in front of him. The pair sits in silence for a while, until Steve lets out a shaky breath.
“I honestly completely forgot he used magic. I was too busy hating him for trying to take over the world using our favourite bird-brain.” Tony’s fingers tap out a rapid rhythm against the table. “I guess I can talk to Thor about it, see if he knows anything.”
when a small dot appears in the centre of the room. It's tiny, unobtrusive, and it doesn't catch anyone's attention at first. Not until it grows in diameter, becoming less of a black circle and more of a blinding, gaping chasm in the air. Clint yelps, falls backwards off the counter that he's perched on, and Tony's suddenly on his feet, his watch expanding to become a gauntlet over his hand, and he aims the gleaming repulsor at the hole. Natasha crouches with twin blades in hand, and Bruce hurtles out of the room so that he doesn't Hulk out before he's needed. Mjølnir flies across the room and into Thor's outstretched hand. Steve stands side by side with Tony; he doesn't have his shield, doesn't have any weapons, but he's proficient enough with hand-to-hand combat, could probably assist with taking down whatever is about to come through. Sam has a knife in one hand, a throw pillow in the other.
Steve can't stop staring as Tony watches the coffee drip down from the filter, the rich scent of coffee beans filling the air as it pools and fills the carafe.
s, and the smell of their sweat. Steve wraps a hand around his own cock, stroking in time to Tony’s movements, being pushed forward into his hand and pushing back onto Tony’s cock. Four, five more strokes, and Steve comes again, spilling over his hand and onto the blanket beneath him. His arms tremble from the release, and it takes all he has not to collapse right then and there, not while Tony is still moving inside of him. Tony’s thrusts become erratic, less rhythmic, and he leans forward, bites down on Steve’s shoulder, and muffles his shout into Steve’s skin; his hips push forward once, twice, and finally still as they’re pressed tightly against Steve’s ass.
it. Out of nowhere, he hates that he couldn't make Pepper happy enough to stay, couldn't convince her that he was worth her time and her attention and her love. He despises that he couldn't be enough for her. Not without giving up the biggest part of him since Afghanistan.
“Where the hell is this coming from?” Steve asks, internally wincing at the slight whining in his voice.
The day started off like any other: The alarm sounded at precisely 6:30, though as usual, he was already out of bed and had been since before six o’clock. Steve ate his normal Friday-morning breakfast of scrambled eggs and avocado on dry toast, swallowing it down with a glass of orange juice. He then took his customary shower, brushed his teeth, and got dressed. By the time he got out the door, the clock had just switched to 7:10 and the cleaning crew was letting themselves into the apartment across the hall. Pleasantries exchanged and his door locked, Steve set off down the stairs, out the main entrance, and in the direction of work.
“Do I – okay, yes, I have to, jeez. Enough with the eyes.” He steps into the armour, hisses when his wrist bangs against the metal. “
need to hear, for the fiftieth time, that I create a ‘hostile work environment’ for people who aren’t a robot like –”
Tony doesn't respond, but Steve figures the other man is changing like he said he would. So he just lets himself collapse onto the couch to wait; unfortunately, his nervousness gets the best of him, and within heartbeats, he's up and pacing the floor again. He
Of course the others dreamed the same thing. Steve holds his head in his hands as they all speak over one another about what the dream could have meant. JARVIS interrupts after an hour, alerting everyone to the War Machine’s presence on the landing pad. Tony disappears from the living room and returns moments later with Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes in tow. The man looks shocked, his body shaking minutely, and he stays close to Tony, even as he joins in the conversation.
They stand there in the nursery, holding each other for a few minutes. Tony isn’t sure how he ever got this lucky, but he’s not fool enough to question it – much.
“He will be allowed to use his magic but only to assist in the care of Captain Rogers and the child. He, along with two other sorcerers from my court, will work alongside the Midgardian doctors to ensure the successful delivery of a healthy babe. I will personally see to it that his magic is limited and can only be used for the casting of the spell upon Captain Rogers and, should the need arise, himself so that he can take the captain’s place in battle. I give you my word that there will be no chance for my son to make things difficult.”
“Belay that, J. Steve, c’mon, don’t. I’m fine. I mean, I wouldn’t say no to getting outta here soon. This hotel sucks, my reservation
“Don’t thank me yet. We still don’t know if this will even work. Just…please, keep it in mind that it may end up being a case where we adopt.”
Pepper arrives half an hour after Natasha, barely even glancing at Tony, and disappears into the bathroom. All Tony can hear is the soft cadence of three voices but not the words; he registers the embarrassed whine in Steve’s voice, but Natasha and Pepper are quick to reassure him. When they emerge, Steve’s face is red, though he doesn’t look as overwhelmed as before. He’s wearing a pair of loose, dark dress pants – Tony’s well aware that the slacks are elastic around the waist; Pepper wore them a lot when she and Tony were still dating, and he’s heard his ex-girlfriend wax poetic about them often enough – and a light blue button-down. He steps forward, kisses the end of Steve’s nose.
Objectively, Tony knows the woman is attractive, with her long dark hair pulled into an extravagant bun and the gentle curls draping from the mass, and her big, brown eyes expertly lined and her long lashes curled, thickened, and lengthened by just enough mascara. Her dress is doing her body so many favours, her curves on display by the gown that clings and gives in all the right ways. So yeah, she's beautiful, and Tony doesn't even know her name, but he hates her.
Steve feels his face burn in a combination of mortification and guilt. Of course Tony wouldn't allow his son to actually drink something so loaded with caffeine. A voice cuts through the low chatter of the other diners, and Steve looks up in time to see an older gentleman making his way through the tables, a wide grin on his face.
“I know. I’ll try to come home early today. If this meeting doesn’t run too long, I should be able to get there around lunchtime.”
Steve stumbles toward the bed and sits down roughly. He has no idea what to do now. He knows finding Bucky is important, it’s why he left New York in the first place, but Tony is just as important, at least now that Steve knows that Tony knows. He’s torn on which path he should follow: Hunt for his best friend or go after his soulmate. Steve cradles his head in his hands, gripping his hair tightly in his fingers, then scratches at the back of his neck. Something on the nightstand catches his attention when he reaches over to shut off the lamp.
He disappears from the doorway, so Steve speaks louder over the rush of water from the sink.“Nat said if I don't at least ask you to go, she’ll never speak to me again.” Steve shrugs. “If you don't wanna, don't feel like ya gotta force yourself.”
Tony hovers in the air, staring at the city bathed in fuzzy orange glow, at the hazy night sky. Sucking in a deep breath, he lands on the landing pad and allows the mechanism to remove the armour as he heads inside. The living room beyond the glass doors is dark, though the lights slowly illuminate the room to show it’s empty. He knows the hope is in vain, but he checks the bedroom anyway.
“Okay. We've all had the same dream. Let's just, let's not worry about it right now. Tony, can you have JARVIS attempt contact with anyone who might know something about this? Thor, same for you, but with Asgard?”
“When the spell is cast upon myself, it is instantaneous. However, I know my body well; therefore, my magic does, as well. I can transform with nearly no conscious thought, but as I’m unfamiliar with your structure, I must be more careful, more thoughtful, more thorough. It will take less than five minutes to be sure everything goes according to plan. Are you ready, Captain Rogers?”
“Dollar in the swear jar,” quips Tony quietly, aiming for a joke and missing by a few million miles.
Tony chuckles once more, beckons Steve to stand. Ben passes the child to his father, pressing a gentle kiss to Peter's forehead, and waves to the trio as they leave. Ten minutes into the drive, Peter is asleep, his hidden-object book on the floorboard. Tony lowers the volume of the radio slightly; his eyes never stray from the road, and Steve wonders if he's going to like what the other man has to say.
“Always gonna, Mister 'I punch people three times my size because I'm an idiot with no self-preservation’.”
Steve chuckles quietly, stabs at a half-melted ice cube in his glass of water with his straw. “I am sorry. I knew it was an overreaction when it was happening, but, as anyone can tell you, I’m a stubborn asshole who rarely admits he’s wrong.”
She sits on the couch beside him, one leg drawn up beneath her body, and rests a hand gently on his stomach. The baby immediately kicks and flips against her palm. Steve ignores the bright sheen of Natasha’s eyes as she murmurs softly in Russian. She rarely reaches out for comfort, and he’s not fool enough to say anything that might make her regret doing so this time.
Tony lets out a heavy sigh, leans down to nudge at Steve's jaw with his nose, and there's no denying he's just as affected by these events as Steve is. The kiss they share now is soft, chaste, and Tony's gone off of Steve's lap before Steve can push for more. He grins at Steve like he knows what Steve is thinking.
“Stevie, relax. You got this. You can do this. I promise. Call me back if you need to, okay? I gotta go, I’m still at work. I love you.”
"We should just quit, Tony. It obviously isn't working, so let's just... Let's go back to normal and pretend I never wanted this."
bot he’d created shortly after his parents’ death – on his side with his claw still clinging to Mjølnir’s handle. Thor looks caught between laughing at Dum-E’s misfortune and internal debate as to whether he should help the robot. Eventually, Tony takes pity on Dum-E and moves to pry the metal claw from the hammer’s strap.
“Right.” Steve sits, shoots a flat look in Tony’s direction, then faces the queen. “Please continue.”
called for a spacious room. This is the opposite of spacious. Guess I’m just glad I’m not claustrophobic.”
Thor nods once, grasps his brother by the elbow. Steve watches them step onto the elevator, then leans back into the couch. He stares out the large window at the cityscape beyond. A bone-deep sigh escapes him, and he feels a flicker of dread flare to life, coupled with doubt. For the first time since he was hit with the desire for a child of his own, he’s not as certain that he can do this.
He's twenty-four and falling asleep in front of his easel, Ma’s thin face smiling down at him from the canvas. Tony's there on the other side, waiting with open arms, and he holds Steve close as Steve finally allows himself to fall apart. It's been a long time coming, a breakdown in the making for the last three months. The deadline for his final project before he graduates is looming nearer, and Steve has been overworking himself, living off of caffeine that messes with his heart and not enough sleep. He's destroyed seven attempts at the portrait. He just can't get the shine in her eyes quite right, and he hates how lifeless the image is, as lifeless and cold and unfeeling as Ma is in her grave, he just wants her back.
“I'm a comic book writer at SHIELD,” explains Steve as he lets Tony nudge him into one of the empty chairs.
Two hours before they’re supposed to meet for their third date, Steve’s phone vibrates, insistently scuttling across the counter. He grabs up the device and thumbs open the message.
Steve forces a soft laugh at how offended the AI sounds at the accusation, but he isn't much in a joking mood. The dark cloud of the shared dream hangs heavily over all of their heads; he stands and starts pacing the room, unable to sit still. Sam doesn't speak, lets Steve work through his thoughts on his own time.
“You owe way more than I do, so don't try that,” responds Steve. His footsteps echo slightly as he crosses the room and sits on the stool next to Tony. “I think we need to talk about this.”
it, that he risked missing Tony’s birthday. He’d waited until Tony was alone in the kitchen before giving it to him; the brunet had raised a brow at the choice in wrapping paper (a scarlet background dotted with little repulsor discs against a gold
Tony's eyes soften at the edges; he holds too much weight on his shoulders, but he refuses to let Steve help carry the load, and Steve hates it, hates not being able to lessen the burden, hates not knowing what he can do to make Tony this carefree and light-hearted outside of these few stolen hours in the night, but he loves seeing the way Tony melts a bit, becomes almost weightless with the ease of no responsibility that he's far too young for. “This is the only time I'm allowed to be me. And me wants coffee.”
!” Steve laughs but doesn’t move from his seat; he doesn’t want to ruin the pictures that the photographer is taking.
Tony's voice is sharp as he snaps  out, "We need a break, because this isn't working. Cap, go to the gym, destroy shit, I don't care, but get your ass out of here. JARVIS, where is Pepper?”
“I’m so sorry.” Tony rests his forehead against Steve’s shoulders, closes his eyes against the spray of water. “I am more sorry than I could ever say, that should be impossible considering I never shut up, but it’s true, Steve. I’d take my whole ‘escape from the freak out instead of talking to the man I love more than anything’ back if I could. But I’m here now, ready to talk this over and even stay quiet the entire time if that’s what you need from me.” He sighs. “How can I make this better?”
“Sorry I’m late, peaches. Pepper waylaid me. Apparently I forgot to sign some pretty important papers.”
The music starts up again, and Tony swallows down the rest of his scotch as Pepper sidles up to his side. She wrinkles her nose at his now-empty glass but doesn't remark on it. He sets the tumbler on the glass and turns to face her fully.
Though Tony’s parked the car in the garage, the two of them are too busy sharing kisses that taste like chocolate and coffee to bother getting out of the vehicle. The only reason they stop, in the end, is because Tony’s phone starts vibrating in its holder on the dashboard, and the smiling face of Peter on the screen is a rather effective mood-killer. Steve breaks away with a gasp, shifting in his seat and adjusting his pants, and Tony swears softly before stabbing at the Accept button. Steve steps out of the car so that Tony can talk to his son in private. The air outside is heavy, thick with humidity and the smell of exhaust and oil, and it helps destroy the rest of Steve’s libido easily; not being around Tony’s cologne, or being unable to touch or see him, doesn’t hurt anything, either. Steve leans against the car, runs a hand through his hair, and waits.
His shower is quick; he doesn't wait for the water to warm up before he steps in. The icy spray is shocking, sends goosebumps racing along his skin, but he methodically scrubs himself down until he's clean. His head is slightly clearer when he shuts the water off. If Tony says no, there's not much Steve can do about it, but it doesn't mean he has to let it destroy the friendship they've built over shared episodes of
Within moments, Phil has whisked Pepper away into the honeymoon suite, and Steve laces his fingers with Tony’s, nudging the other man toward the enormous glass doors that lead out to the darkened terrace. Steve grabs the throw blanket off the back of the couch; it isn’t too terribly chilly outside, though the sun has been set for a couple of hours, but there’s something about holding Tony tight under a blanket, the sky dotted with thousands of stars even if they can’t see them through the haze of fluorescent orange and smog that permeates Brooklyn, and enjoying the warmth and comfort that comes with having his arms around the man he loves… It’s intoxicating, and Steve loves every second of it. He collapses onto the lounger, the wicker frame creaking softly under his weight, and shuffles to get more comfortable on the thick, conforming padding. Once he’s settled, he raises his arms to allow Tony to sit on his legs. Tony exhales heavily as he reclines against Steve’s chest, and Steve nuzzles his nose into his partner’s neck.
“I have friends out there, too. One, I've known since college. The other, only for the past few years, but she's amazing and puts up with my shit, so that counts for something, right?”
Steve faces the Wakandan prince but still keeps an eye on Bucky. T'Challa explains how advanced Wakanda is, regardless of how the country is viewed by the rest of the world. His sister and their team of medical staff have technology, leaps and bounds ahead of what is standard throughout the world, that can erase the trigger words and damage done to Bucky's brain. Steve knew about Wakanda, he knows they all knew, and this isn't any new information, but this is refuge offered without violence, help given without their lives hanging in the balance. Steve wants to agree to it on Bucky's behalf, but he refrains. This is a choice only Bucky can make.
Tony scrubbed a hand over his face. In his zeal over revamping his armor’s environmental sealing, he’d forgotten about this little project he’d been working on with Bruce.
A few moments later, Steve came with a soft moan, his release somewhat decreased compared to the last few orgasms, but still more than would be considered normal. As Steve panted into the pillow, his hands gripping the bed sheets tightly, he waited until he was settled enough to get out a full sentence.
“You did such a good job,” Tony crooned as he ran a hand up Steve’s leg. “Now just lie back and relax. I’ll take care of everything from here.”
Tony gave him a lopsided smile. “Look at you, all sweet like this.” His tone was so tender and reverent that Steve couldn’t help groaning. “Can’t wait to feel you inside me.”
Tony wastes no time getting in contact with JARVIS on his phone. He isn’t exactly happy with what the AI is telling him.
The lines on the page in front of him blurred as Steve’s eyes unfocused. He’d been on edge all afternoon, ever since Tony had instructed him to keep himself nice and open for what he had planned. While this wasn’t his first time using a butt plug, this was his first time keeping it in for more than an hour or two.
He ran a hand over his forehead and watched as it came away wet with sweat. Odd, he didn’t remember the room being so hot before. But now… he was really starting to feel it. Without stopping to think about what he was doing, he started unfastening his uniform top. Once he pulled it off and tossed it aside, he instantly felt better.
Now that Tony thinks about it, it’s hard to believe that all this only happened a little over a day ago. The only thing reminding him is the echo of the absolutely amazing post-coital buzz. That and the lovely finger-shaped bruises on his waist.
That’s when everything comes back to him—the jet getting hit, ending up in the middle of nowhere, and Tony’s injury… He tries shifting his shoulders, and sure enough, the lancing pain that he’d felt before is gone. Of all the crazy things, Steve’s unorthodox method apparently worked, which means—
The omega shakes his head. “Honestly, I’ve been thinking about jumping you since you got on here,” he admits, voice raspy. “If I’m gonna go into heat, then I’m damn well gonna enjoy it.” His gaze flicks up to Steve. “Come on, I can smell how badly you want me.”
Tony pulled back to properly meet his eyes. “Shit, Steve. You’ll be the death of me.” He did his best to comply, the slick left by the alien easing his way.
By the time Steve starts on his belt, his gaze drifts down to find a truly tantalizing sight: the omega on his back, his legs bent in the air and his pants halfway off. A fresh wave of omega scent—sweet and floral, with the added tanginess of slick—hits Steve. He’s reminded of how he’s been in a fairly long dry spell as far as dating and sex go. The last thing he imagined when he walked into this building for an interview was that he’d put an end to that dry spell tonight.
She was facing him now, looking like she was ready for a fight. “I wouldn’t worry yourself too much, Steve. It’s Stark. You know how he can be. He’s as mercurial as a cat sometimes.”
“It will be necessary, believe me.” Tony planted a kiss on his forehead from the side. “Besides, this isn’t the first time I tied you up, now is it?”
“Oh thank god,” he says as he reaches up to take off his shades. “Was worried I had the wrong address.”
He was surprised when it finally slid all the way in with a brief popping sensation. Throwing his head back, he let out a groan of relief. He was just calming down when he felt the intrusion hit his prostate again, making him jolt upward in his restraints.
Tony’s face lit up immediately. “You won’t regret it, Steve. I promise you. It’s like the ultimate dildo… combined with an enema but without the mess!”
Steve puts his face in his hands as he rests his elbows on his lap. “Fiiiine. But I need to eat something first.”
Steve ran a hand through his hair. “It’s fine. I’m not mad at you or Tony. I’m just glad we all came out of this with no harm done.”
The man suddenly stirred awake for a moment. “Don’t wanna go to work…” he grumbled before closing his eyes again and letting out a snore.
The countless little appendages caressing his skin felt so damn good. It took a bit for him to open his eyes; his entire body felt loose and relaxed. Bright light surrounded him and he blinked a few times before settling onto bright LED lights hanging overhead. He’d been here before.
Steve puts his hand on Tony’s forehead again. The way his eyebrows jump is not a good sign. “Definitely warmer than before.”
Tony groans again as he reaches up to pinch the bridge of his nose. Fuck his good intentions. Seriously.
And the man’s face, well… Steve told himself he wasn’t helping this random salaryman-looking guy because he was attractive. Still, it wasn’t like he could deny that the man was devastatingly handsome. His hair was in disarray, but had clearly been styled to look like it was messy on purpose. There was some evidence of a mustache that probably needed to be kept in check. Besides all that, there was just something about this man’s face that drew Steve in.
He gasped when he felt the eggs moving inside of him again. He thought maybe he’d gotten used to them, but they felt different once they started moving. Probably something to do with how they changed shape, as Tony had explained.
Steve looked indecisive for a moment and Tony felt his chest freeze up until Steve finally nodded and said, “Yeah, sure. Tomorrow’s Christmas, after all.” As though that explained everything.
Tony shakes his head. “Not uncomfortable. Just… full.” He slides down one hand to cover Steve’s settled on his stomach. “
Steve grit his teeth as he came, spilling over his hand and adding to the mess in his boxers and on the sheets. He shut his eyes and tried to steady his breathing through the post orgasmic high. He couldn’t deny that thoughts of Tony got him off so much faster than anything else. Of all the things he’d learned from that whole incident, this was definitely the most surprising.
“I heard you get in late last night, punk. I thought you just got stuck in an elevator? That’s what you said in your text.”
Tony glanced up at him. Steve found himself wondering if Tony’s eyes had always been this striking. Were his eyelashes always so prominent?
Tony sinks into Steve’s embrace. He can’t remember the last time he’s felt this relaxed. Relaxed and… safe. Being connected to Steve like this just feels so
, since when did his company hire a total specimen like this guy? Tall, built, and definitely Tony’s type. He knows he would have remembered walking past this guy in the hallway—that hip to shoulder ratio
The end of the creature still hanging over his face was moving its antennae back and forth again. Steve wasn’t sure what to expect until he felt some of its legs moving against his ass. It was almost like…
“So how about you?” Steve asked from across the table. “Sounds like you’re here on some pretty serious business.”
Tony rubbed his eyes. He was starting to feel the amount of hours of sleep he’d been skipping. “It’s not that.”
He has to mentally shake himself before answering. He’s letting himself think with his dick already, which can’t be a good sign. “Yeah, just… not happy with all this.” He gestures at everything around them. “Apparently a transformer just blew.”
The next thing Steve knew, Tony was kissing him and slipping a hand around the back of his neck. He groaned into Tony’s mouth and pulled him closer without even thinking about it. Everything was happening so fast and Steve felt like his world had been flipped on its head. Among all of that, though, one thought was clear in his mind: Tony Stark was a
They ended up back in the capsule hotel for Steve to pick up some things. Tony leaned against the next locker as he watched Steve intently.
“This is comfy,” Tony says in a cheerful tone after sitting down on the couch. He raises an eyebrow at Steve. “Well? I don’t bite, I swear.” Tony gives Steve a smile, all white, straight teeth.
In the meantime, Tony tries in vain to connect with F.R.I.D.A.Y. Seems like the snow storm is making it hard to access any satellites. And they’re probably up in Saskatchewan for all he knows, so it’s not like civilization is likely to be closeby. Just his luck.
Steve sits back against the couch cushions. “You really want to date me?” He gestures between the two of them.
“I wouldn’t say it’s a lost cause just yet. Let’s head to the closest police station and see what we can find.” He made to get up.
“Such a good omega,” he murmurs as he pushes his face into the juncture of Tony’s shoulder and neck, nuzzling him.
Tony glances up at those earnest blue eyes. It seems wrong to lie, so he says, “Honestly? Feeling like shit.”
He reaches over to pat Steve’s arm. “Calm down, honey.” He winces at the overly familiar endearment before adding, “They’re gonna get us out of here.”
“A long day? It’s the morning, Tony.” Bruce leaned closer to the screen. “Wait, have you even slept?”
“Ah, ah,” Steve cried out. He was still oversensitive after being brought off so many times in succession. Now, it was driving him crazy.
“Alright. Just give me a heads up.” Bruce gave him one last look over his shoulder before he stepped through the workshop doors.
“Cap, I don’t know what this thing’s trying to do and I don’t like it. You feeling any better now that you’ve... gotten off?”
Steve hesitates at the latches for the part that would detach the back of the armor. Tony knows this is going to hurt like a bitch, but it’s not like he’s a stranger to pain by this point in his life.
“That’s its pheromones, or something like that, Steve! Whatever it’s doing to you, you have to resist it. You hear me? I’ll be down there as soon as I can. Just… hang on until then, okay?”
Without another word, Steve kneels down and moves to help Tony up. It’s slow-going and uncomfortable, but eventually Steve manages to get his arm around Tony’s shoulder and hefts him up.
It didn’t take long for Steve to reach his climax, jerking his hips upward into Tony and crying out as he came hard inside him. Tony kept riding him, his face buried in Steve’s chest as he panted hard. He was moaning Steve’s name and an assortment of endearments and expletives that Steve couldn’t really make out with all of the overwhelming sensory input. It wasn’t long before his rhythm stuttered and he came hard with a grunt against Steve’s skin, his cock spurting warmth between them.
“Mhmm.” Natasha stepped past Steve to head for the other side of the gym. She turned back toward him. “We should spar.”
Pleasure shot through Steve’s nerves before he even realized what was happening. His eyes flew open and he cried out as the thing inside him started to vibrate right up against his prostate.
He tried to curl up before he remembered the restraints holding his arms and legs. Instead, he turned his head to the side and shut his eyes. His orgasm seemed to be going on forever as he whimpered into the table’s surface.
Tony walks past him and heads for the couch. As Steve watches him, he can’t help but notice how ridiculous Tony looks in the backdrop of his apartment. His sharp button-up shirt and slacks combo clashes against the dull wallpaper. Even his shiny, no doubt expensive shoes look wrong on the old, fading carpet.
“Sorry for keeping you so long,” the man says with a sympathetic look. “We’ll be sure to call you as soon as we can reschedule.”
Bruce didn’t seem impressed as he leaned against the table. “Tony… are you still punishing yourself over what happened in the lab while I was out?”
“You took it all so well,” Tony said in a reassuring tone. “You are so wonderfully sensitive, too. Bet you can feel exactly how full you are, right now.”
“Brucie-bear, since when did you care so much about the weight machines in the gym? And what do you mean it’s been decima—”
Steve blinked a few times in an attempt to clear his thoughts before answering, “Good, Tony. So good. I… I’ve never felt anything like this before.”
On second thought, not even leaning. The man was slumped down against the door, his head leaning forwards. As Steve got closer, he caught the smell of some kind of alcohol, which pretty much answered any question he might have had. Probably a salaryman who’d had too much to drink and couldn’t even make it up to his floor.
He let himself fall back against his pillows and stared at the ceiling. Things couldn’t keep going like this, he knew. Sooner or later, something would have to give.
He shrugged. “Fine, Tony.” He turned toward the door. “I’ll leave you to it. Just… make sure to get some rest and try not to run yourself ragged.”
“Oh god,” he said with a groan as the first egg started vibrating as it brushed past his prostate. He could feel his cock start thickening up again, painfully.
Tony shot him a skeptical look. “Police station? Why? I’m sure someone’s cleaned the whole thing out by now and dumped it somewhere.”
Steve glances down briefly at his paint-stained shirt and jeans. He wasn’t exactly expecting a guest. “W-what are you doing here?”
Tony responds by pulling Steve close for a heated, sloppy kiss. He revels in the rough friction of Steve’s stubble against his lips and chin before adding, “Feels
“Mmm,” Tony hummed as he lightly caressed the bulge in Steve’s abdomen. “You feel that? I bet you do.” He chuckled, his voice low. “Hell, you can even
Tony was all too happy to indulge him. At first, he’d had a field day with Steve’s practically non-existent refractory period. Even when Tony had hit his own limit, he did everything he could to find ways to keep Steve sated. Steve remembered feeling guilty those times he’d gotten off from a really nice vibrating dildo (custom-made by Tony) for the fourth or fifth time only to look down and find that he was still hard.
And what could Steve do but accept the gift? He felt something warm in his chest as he held it up to look it over. He felt ridiculous, like he was a teenager again.
Tony’s lips curled into a smile. “You can’t hide from me, Cap. Saw you open your legs for it like the whore you are.”
When he glanced over at Tony, he was met with Tony’s own gaze directed back at him under dark eyelashes. Feeling his face heat up, he glanced away quickly.
“Mmm, yeah, just like that, Steve,” Tony coaxed him as he continued rubbing off on him. He set a rhythm; pushing down onto Steve’s cock and then pulling off to rub against Steve’s swollen belly. The lube kept the slide against Steve’s tight skin easy as Tony pressed his lips against Steve’s chest every time he rubbed against him.
Just thinking about it gets him hard, though he’s doing a lot better now. Pepper, taking pity on him, made sure to contact his doctor and get something that could help him in the meantime. So while he’s still on his heat, the symptoms aren’t so bad that he’s like a neon sign for alphas. Besides, Bruce is an omega, too, and Tony can never deny having him over when he’s in town.
“Shit,” Steve cried out as he felt the creature’s legs against his perineum. His vision whited out and his back arched off the floor as dozens of legs moved over the sensitive area. The blinding pleasure continued as the creature moved over his balls and then up along his cock. When he finally mustered up enough focus to glance down, he saw the other end of the creature crawling up from underneath his groin. It was so close to his cock. If it just kept moving upward…
