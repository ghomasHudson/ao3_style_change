Before Tony opened the red door in front of him, the door was thrust opened showing Tony his workshop, which made realization paint Tony's face and a terrified peep get out of him. All of this time and that crazy Addams could have waltzed inside his workshop like he owned the place! Tony turned to Steve gazing at him with wide eyes, only to see the happy and pleasant look on the older man's face.
Falling, Tony could only notice that, he was up one second and another second he was falling, and he couldn't even brace himself for the hard ground that will meet him, only… only Tony didn't fall on the ground, someone was holding him from behind, lowering him gently to the ground. He can hear Stane's terrified voice, he can hear the terror hiding in his tone now the winds doesn't hide every little voice that was made.
Pepper's grin seemed to widen even more as she and Steve exchanged a few short words before turning to Tony, causing the inventor to wince when she stepped on his leg to return him to the land of the living. "I will leave you alone boys, don't cause any trouble when I am gone, Tony." Pepper smiled giving Steve a nod before walking toward someone that Tony thought was Happy.
"Shit, shit, shit!" Tony's voice cracked as he leaned on the wall behind him, trying to walk on the slippery eaves, trying not to fall and break something; the sound of the door breaking caused Tony's breath to hitch as he tried to walk faster, away from the window and away from what could possibly tip Howard's toward Morgan (Not that Howard would manage to get her if she was in the playroom, Tony made sure of that).
Tony grunts as he tried to reason with himself for the forty times that day, trying to channel his anger to Rogers and hope that the bastard will drop dead and relieve Tony from the pain of seeing him. Tony should have listened to Peggy, he should have listened to Steven when he told him not to start something with Rogers or he will regret, he should have really listened; but as always Tony didn't, and he was fooled by Rogers' sweet words and kisses, and his lies of happy ever after and a family, he failed a simple task of following Steven's words and seeing if Rogers loves him for himself and for his body.
Tony was sitting on the floor when the Iron Man mask he was working on fell on the floor near him; he looked at the mask for a long time then looked at the ceiling. "Hey J, search for the name Steven G. Rogers, son of Sarah Rogers and Joseph Rogers." Tony said, maybe it was his drunk mind, or that he was dying, but he wanted to have closure, it was so not fair that Tony had to live in pain and fear while Steve was out there enjoying himself, he wanted to call the Omega and ask him why… why did he leave him? Why didn't he returned for him? Why did he turn Tony into this?
"Well, I guess you have a lot of explaining to do, future spangles…" That was Tony who was blinking so fast his eyes start tearing from refusing to close them until now, Steve starts massaging his forehead as he was attacked by questions left and right, the loudest was Thor who wanted to know how Steve knew about the Infinity Stones and Thanos…
Maybe Tony should finally listen to Pepper and take a vacation, he was sure that if he asked Steve, the Alpha will jump on board with his plan so the two of them can have at least a few weeks to themselves before returning back to their busy schedules, and maybe… maybe the two of them will finally take the next step in their relationship… the thought made Tony flush at that and look at his hands, it was true that the two of them lived together and took care of the small pup as a family… but not once did the two even entertained the thought of sex…
"No, father, not those! The one with the star in the middle of it!" Petrus exclaimed, his words causing Anton to tilt his head in confusion, a Shield with a star in the middle? He never saw a Shield with that kind of insignia before. Wait! A star in the middle? His son didn't mean…
"Ouch, hey kid, are you OK?" Tony groan, his eyes sit on the boy who looked like a dear caught in a headlight; Tony took in the boy who could be thirteen years old or younger, the troubled and sheepish look on the boy's face nearly made Tony roll his eyes.
They nearly reached the alter, and Tony's lips twitched up into a smile when he saw Steve grinning madly, his eyes not straying away from Tony as he took him in; Steve was wearing a suit similar to Tony, the only difference there was the tie, which was black. The sight of Steve, made Tony's heart pound a little in his chest and an uncontrollable giggle nearly left his lips.
She wipes her brow and sits beside him, sipping her own drink. "You still went easy on me." She leaned back on her hand, after saying those words, a chiding frown on her face. "What happened… for you to hate… Pepper?" Peggy finally asked after regaining her breath, her words made Steve frown and gaze at the bottle in his hand tiredly.
"Wait!" Starkad narrow his eyes when he heard a voice ordering him to stop, which made him gaze around the place to see who dared to interrupt him. Only for his eyes to fall on James, the queen's pup, who was glaring at them with red-rimmed eyes as he was panting like he ran all the way here; in one of his small hands, the boy was holding a dagger, as he glared at anyone who dared to look in his way. "You took your justice, now it is my turn to take mine." James hissed, glaring at Starkad in the eyes, which made amusement shine on the older Alpha's face, and secretly Starkad wondered what the small boy will do with the dagger.
It was a few moments later that the salt that had been white even when Rogers was inside the workshop turned black, and a grimace itched itself on Tony's face, it seems that he will be hunted by an Addams for the rest of his life, trying to ignore his A.I.'s words of praise Tony went to change the salt and put the roses in the water, hoping they won't turn into ashes tomorrow…
"It's OK, baby, the kids and I would be fine," Tony reassures his husband, kissing him on the lips softly before the Alpha relaxed and let out a sigh. "Besides, Ma is right next door, we can go there if something happened." That seemed to cause the last of the tension in Steve's body to leave him as he kissed the kids' foreheads before heading to the door, giving his husband one last kiss on the lips before leaving…
/Warning/: This chapter contains cursing, a little bit of sadness, a little bit of violence (?), a lot of time skips, feelings, therapy, and fluffiest fluffy fluff! And Tony finally gets a day off, and Peter is precious! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
Steven looked at the man wanting to take the hot kettle and throw at his face while watching as the man screamed at the burns and pain he will get, but the Omega pressed his lips tightly, already knowing that the Alpha wanted the Omega to react like a savage so he doesn't care about the punishment he will serve to his friends and babe because for one he was not breaking their deal. "Let me phrase my words then, I am not asking, I am demanding." The Omega stressed his words like he was talking to a child, an action that made a snarl appear on the Alpha's face, but the man stayed in his place looking at the Omega with narrow eyes. "I think that we both know that I will not crack and accept your offer, just as we both know that it is impossible to finish a week worth of work in one day, but as you can see, I managed… you asked me to be your slave in exchange for my people's freedom, but until now I have yet to see any truth that you followed through your promise." The Omega said through gritted teeth his grip tightening on the mug in his hands.
What to do? What to do? Cutting all of his parents money and leaving them to deal with the financial problems is not Tony's style, he wasn't that cruel to take someone's hard-earned money (Even if it came from him and his company) Tony was tired of screaming and shouting and arguing with Howard, it hadn't worked for the twenty years he lived with the man, and it sure as hell won't work now when the senile old man reached his 99 years old and probably lost his hearing. So what is Tony to do with the problem that presents itself to him after seventeen years of him making peace with his parents' death?
When the door to his house was knocked on, Tony looked at the clock to see that it was six in the evening, which made Tony sigh as he went to the door and opened it giving a tired smile to Steve who smiled at the Omega. "How is Peter? I hoped he wasn't a bother when I was away." Steve said as he entered the house after Tony opened the door for him which caused the Omega to pause a little.
The footsteps stopped behind Steven which made him turn and his eyes to widen at the humanoid shape that was painted red and gold. "Odin's beard…" The only thing Steven could choke as his eyes widen even more and fear frozen him in his place when that… that thing… raised its hands. Holding his breath Steven let out a war cry as he rushed toward that thing after unfrozen himself, already knowing that taking it by surprise will give him a few precious seconds so that he will be able to run.
Tony finally dares to look at the source of the fire, only to frown when he didn't see the reason for the flare he saw which made him feel twitchy and unsettled. There is just enough light to see by, and Tony walks across the grass back to his house, cursing softly, and looking up at the clouded night sky. There are no stars and no moon, just bands of dark grey moving slowly overhead.
The frantic knocking of the door caused Steve to flinch, the fear of it being his stalker made Steve shakes in the tube without leaving the tube to investigate the knocking. It was only when Steve heard Sam and Natasha's voice that he stood up and rushed toward the door, tears were running down his face when he opened the door and saw his friends' pale faces gazing at him…
Opening the mansion's doors, Tony gets ready to shout at Steve to show his face. What greeted him when he opened the door though, caused his mouth to click shut and gaze at the ceiling with a shock that seemed to refuse to leave. There hanging from the ceiling upside down was Clint; Clint who was bandaged like he was a mummy, he was squirming and his muffled shout was heard all around the place, the rest of the Avengers were trying to reach him using whatever they can get their hands on.
/Warning/: This Chapter contains, cursing, sadness, fluff, violence, mention of character's death, character(s) death, horror elements, mention of smut (Sorry), poor everyone, and the secrets would be out, finally! All reviews are appreciated.
The only bright spots in his life were his mother, who always loved him for who he was, the dorky teen who loved robots. His aunt Peggy, even being Captain America it didn't stop the woman from considering Maria her best friend, the two of them with Ann, Jarvis' wife always gathered once a week, to try and embarrass Anthony as much as they can. And Jarvis, the kind doctor who was his father's old friend, the two of them weren't friends anymore, but the older man considered Anthony his own, he was the only father figure in Anthony's life, so Anthony always cherish their time together, it didn't hurt that his wife Ann, was aunt Peggy's friend, and there was Rhodey, his best friend, who enlisted in the army years ago.
Reaching the roof, Steve had to blink at the chaos he was seeing; part of Steve was irritated that he was interrupted from his calm life by the joke of the galaxy crashing into his life to kidnap him or something. They probably heard about a star landing on Midgard and decided to kidnap him to sell him for the highest bidder, just like they did the Power Stone. Unfortunately for them, they didn't know Steve all that well if they decided to come here unprepared. "Enough!" Steve snarled, letting his glowing increase in brightness which blinded everyone momently, causing them to cuss as they start rubbing their eyes, not even the highest and brightest technology managed to save their eyes from Steve's shine.
"A bitch that needed to be taught a lesson…" Tony said easily, which made Steve's mad grin widen even more, and his fingers twitched like crazy, preparing to strangle and no doubt kill someone. "What do you say? Tonight after dinner or in the witching hours?" Tony asked, a giggle leaving his lips at the thought of getting rid of Sunset for once and for all… Needless to say, no one found Sunset's body after that day, but rumors have it; if you listen closely while passing room No.537 in one of Hawaii's most known hotels. You would hear the screams of a woman being tortured to death every time the clock hit 3:33 AM; what made everyone shiver in fear and terror was the mad laughter coming out of the room every night accompanying the screams. On the other hand, Pepper was extremely happy when she told Tony about the cheap company SI bought after the disappearance of its CEO…
Everyone glanced at one another with calculating looks before nodding their head. Not a few moments afterward the screen in front of them start showing the feeds. Everyone's eyes widen when they saw Steven shackled to the wall with nothing but his slacks, a few moments later he woke up and searched around the place, minutes passed before Zola and a naked man came in the room, everyone's eyes widen at Zola's explanation. As for Rogers he let out a strangled noise when he saw the mask fall and the man behind it was nothing but James Barnes, it made Peggy wonder for a second what will Rogers do that he realizes that Bucky was now alive, alive for seventy years, helping Hydra. They all understood what transpired when Zola left the room, struggling to ignore Rogers' angry snarl when Bucky get on top of Steven, a few seconds though Bucky tense and became lifeless on top of Steven, they saw how the shackles were crushed with a flick of Steven's wrists, how he rose up carrying Bucky toward the bunk in the distant corner of the room. What frozen everyone though, was when Steven opened his eyes later, they were crimson red, and for a second Peggy thought that he was a feral werewolf. The ruthless grin on his face that followed was even worse.
"He knows more about it then you will ever do, people have hearts, unlike that block of ice in your chest." Tony answered coldly gazing at the Alpha with a blank look. "You know, the day you die, I will wear red and dance on your grave… I hope you have a long miserable and lonely life, Howard because that's the only thing you deserve." With that, the mask snapped shut and Tony used his thrusters and launched himself out of the house, not caring about making another hole in the ceiling, he ignored the shouts and screams behind him.
"And this is where I became Captain America!" Steve said as he pointed at an abandoned shop/building which made Peter gasp in awe as he clutched Steve's shirt tightly and jump up and down in his arms, making the Alpha give a laugh before calming the pup down last he hurt himself, which made Tony's lips twitch up in a smile.
"I am going to clean my room!" Peter shouted before rushing away, leaving Tony snorting and gazing at the boy who was running up the stairs. Clint's kids are really a bad influence on Peter, before those two little devils sink their claws in Peter, the little boy always loved tidying his room and kept his clothes clean; now… now Peter was the definition of a sloppy jobless person and he wasn't even twelve. Tony just hopes that Harley won't get influenced by those troublemakers like Peter.
"You are an idiot…" Bucky chocked leaning his forehead on Steve, getting a laugh from the Omega who looked at him with sparkling blue eyes, happiness taking over the Omega's body making him give a soft glow.
"T-that's amazing Tony!" His mom was the first to recover, abandoning her chair and hopped (That's the only word that Tony can use to specify what his mother did) to him, drawing him into a strong embrace, cooing and nuzzling him, which turned Tony's face red with embarrassment, how did this even happen? It was only a few moments later that the rest of his family unfroze too, praising him and hugging him tightly, Tony will never admit that he was touched a little at how his family took his side.
"Good morning, Sir, I hate to disturbed you, but everyone is waiting for you downstairs." Jarvis's voice as he said those words made Tony blink his eyes and look at the clock on the nightstand with wide eyes, it was already nine AM. And Tony can't believe that he slept in when was the last time he slept in? It was probably years ago because ever since Stane, the Omega couldn't sleep more than five hours a day.
Arriving at the roof, Tony went to search for Peter; already thinking about the long talk he was going to have with his son for scaring him like this. Finding Peter, Tony stood still when he found his son hugging his legs and gazing at the yellow roses with a sad look on his tired face. Seeing his baby like this was enough for the fight to leave Tony and for him to rush toward his baby, how could Tony be so distracted that he didn't notice his baby was hurting?
Tony narrow his eyes, humming as he tried to choose between the funeral suit he wore the day his parents died (Surprisingly it did fit him even after all these years, even if it was on the small side; the suit only manage to highlight his best assists, which in any other date he would have been happy for). And some crazy ass clothes he found, considering of leather, metal, and more leather. So far Tony was leaning toward the funeral suit because then, it means that Tony would die in style (And be prepared for it, was a plus).
"His heart will break either way, at least like this, we will find Bucky fast, and he will have a lot of time to recover." Steven said which made Peggy not her head at that and let out a sigh.
Steve though, looked up at him and gave a small smile, which made the Omega flush a little but returned the smile, the Omega then walked to his bed and sat on it, looking at the Alpha that was cooing to the cat, he bites his lower lip in thoughts. "Was that a date?" Tony asked in a small voice after getting the courage to do, he saw Steve blink and gaze at him and his heart dropped a little thinking that he misread the situation, when he was about to apologize Steve looked at him with a small smile.
"Tony…" Maria said gently after they reached a room full of children, which made Tony tense and hold into his son tightly. "You should leave Peter here, before going to the therapy." Maria said and Tony backed away shaking his head wildly a look of fear flashed in his eyes, he has never been separated from his pup, and they wanted him to leave his child, what if something happened to him?
Taking a deep breath, Steven let out a tired sigh, grumbling as he looked around the place he was in to see that he walked deeper into the force in his hast of putting as much space between him and the Alpha before he did something he would regret. A few more deep breaths, Steven managed to calm his temper down enough to start tricking back toward the village, planning on spending the next fortnight with his people and ignoring the useless Alpha as he flounders around the place.
"Ouch!" Bucky wince when Steve stepped on his foot the three hundred times in an hour (Steve was probably overdramatic but it felt like that to him) Steve huffed as he let go of Bucky's hands, grumbling all the way as he tried to regain his bearers, ignoring how Bucky rubbed his foot and whined to Peggy who smacked him on the back of his head and told her husband to stop acting like a child.
After being sedated the first time, Tony always finds himself sedated mainly for the episodes he always created when someone walked toward him without Tony being mental prepare to see them, it usually starts with someone sneaking upon him, and the Tony will find himself screaming and throwing things, and when he felt someone getting near his son, he will lose it and start attacking. The first week Captain America was there to stop him from harming himself or others, the Alpha's scent made him so sleepy and relaxed that he will go to sleep holding his baby in his arms, but since the second week when the Alpha returned to manage Shield, the nurses were forced to drug him.
"Hello Ma'am, my name is Steve Rogers," Rogers said in the most normal voice, which made Tony's eyes widen, especially when Pepper giggled a little and took the man's extended hand and shook it before giving her name… so this was how he brainwashed his victims? Acting all nice and coy? The fuck? Tony whimpered at that as he shook Pepper, hoping that the woman would snap out of it, but it was no use, it was like trying to move a mountain… Pepper didn't give him any thought as she continued to talk with Rogers, something that made Tony tear up… he destroyed Pepper's life!
It was a surprise, Tony was going to admit, a pleasant surprise. At first Tony didn't know what to do about Steve glowing while sitting beside him; literally glowing, not like the metaphor you tell someone to inform them of how good they look. Oh, no, Steve was practically glowing. It was a surprise, seeing the faint light enclosing Steve like a halo, a protective Shield surrounding the blond. It nearly made Tony point out to Steve that he was glowing like a nightlight, thinking that maybe Steve will turn flustered when he realized what he was doing.
"What's going on, Steve?" Peggy had asked wincing a little as a doctor got smacked in the face by the restrains the Beta throws at him, a few cursed words, made the doctor whine and hide behind one of the nurses that were cowering.
Anthony remembered screaming Steve's name, as he runs into their bedroom and opened the closet, he nearly starts sobbing as he saw that Steve's clothes were no longer there, he runs around the house praying to God that this was just misunderstanding and that Steve is going to be back soon, that there is something left to assure Anthony that Steve would be back soon. It ends up with his father knocking the door an hour later with a sour look on his face, it ends up with his father telling him that one of Anthony's play toy came to him and demand money or he will expose him, it ends up with Anthony being told that it was Steve… Anthony never believed his father.
"Still, thank you, for being so brave." Steven leaned down, kissing Petrus' forehead, causing the small boy to gasp. "Petrus?" Steven asked in concern when he saw the small boy's blue eyes got filled with tears; with a choked whine, the small boy ended up throwing himself at Steven, hiding his face in Steven's lap as he continued to let out whines and sobs, crying himself on Steven's lap. "Oh…" Was the only thing Steven could let out as he gazed at the small child in his lap; Steven let out a sigh, and he laid his right hand on Petrus' head, running his hand through the boy's soft hair.
Gently, Tony raised his right hand, trailing his fingers gently around Steve's face, his lips, between his brows, the bridge of his nose… Tony didn't know what he did to be this lucky and end up with an amazing person as a husband. "Enjoying yourself, sweetheart?" Steve asked in a low voice, causing Tony to curl his toes in pleasure, the Alpha's eyes were still closed, but Steve shuffled until Tony was held in his arms.
"Oh, shush, darling you look dashing even on your worse days," That made Tony snort a little but he gave Winnie a small smile as she let him go. "By the way dear, I want you to meet someone," Winnie said with a happy sparkle in her eyes which made Tony hold into his groan, it seems like he was going to suffer from another failed attempt from Winnie's matchmaking, the older Alpha seemed to take it upon herself to find the perfect Alpha for Tony, someone who will charm the Omega off of his feet as she said, so far, it only lead to awkward meetings with strangers that her daughters introduced to him, Clint never let him live it down ever since one of the Alphas that Winnie brought fainted on top of Tony when he realized he was meeting
"Who is he, Thor?" Peggy asked Thor which caused the thundered to stop in his advance to kill Tony, Peggy's words made him turn to her, his face has so many different emotions like he couldn't choose the right words to say or the right emotion to feel, he was lost and that showed on his face.
"You forget? You fucking forget?!" Tony shrieked as he rushed after Howard, ignoring how his mother was ordering him to stand down and leave his father alone. "Do you even realize what happened since you two decided to disappear from my life completely? It was hell! And you have the audience to act like everything is alright when you sold me to Stane and everyone else in a cold blood!" Snarls, hisses, and screams could be heard as Tony threw everything in his sight at Howard, ignoring how the man tried to run out of the living room.
It was hard and cruel three months, Peter was always in a sad mood, and as much as Steve wanted to cheer his pup he couldn't summon enough joy, the pain of losing his best friend was too much, it was one day that May barge in with a grin and opened the TV on a specific news channel… that day Tony Stark returned to the world after creating a suit of armor, that day the Alpha shut the weapon manufacturing in SI to the shock of everyone, Howard Stark and Obadiah Stane were the most obvious ones as they tried to do a damage control, Steve watched all of that ignoring Peter's happy squeals as he jumped around the room…
"Tony, wait!" Pepper called out as she rushed after him, no doubt planning on checking him for injuries or try to force him to sign a few papers for the company or something. Tony could only put his hands on his ears and shout out 'Nope!' as he rushed toward his room, not wanting anyone near him at this moment other than his hot tube and his fluffy bathrobe that were waiting to seduce him into their embrace.
It took time, but in the end, Steve was left a relaxing purring mess in the water, taking in the soothing smell as he leaned back, resting his head, on the bathtub headrest behind him. Steve hummed to himself as he closed his eyes, his right hand trailed down until it rested on his stomach.
As time passed, the pain of losing Anton had reduced to a dull ache, and he was grateful for that because it finally gave him the chance to move on, as much as it hurt him too, he wanted to move on and stop pinning after a dead mortal, but the heart wants what it wants, it was ironical how much that sentence was true, and it was funny that it was said by Anton.
Tony's lips twitched down at that, actually, his whole body was twitching with some nervous energy, but Tony was not going to do anything about it, he was not going to exam it closely until he was over with this visit. "Oh, Tony, it had been such a long time!" Maria's voice came from the living room, causing Tony's heart to pound in his chest, and for his breath to hitch; his mother… his mother was sitting in the living room sofa with a white cat in her lap, looking as beautiful as she did seventeen years ago.
"It's OK, Tony; it's OK, am here now…" Steve whispered kissing the top of his head causing Tony to let out a whine, sniffing as he tried to regain himself and stop embarrassing himself more than he is. The gentle hand running down his hair and back calmed Tony down, making him let out a shaky sigh and breathe deeply, taking in Steve's scent; his content scent, without anything illness or pain clouding it.
The office door was knocked on frantically then, causing Steve to flinch and turn to the door, relaxing slightly when he heard Bucky's frantic voice behind the door. "Oh thank God you two were OK." Bucky murmured when his eyes fell on Steve and Tony, who was frowning when he caught the sight of Bucky.
"Peggy Carter, sorry we haven officially met, but I'm sure you have heard of me in passing." The words the woman uttered made Steve's eyes widen a little when the woman's words made sense to him and the Omega realized that Captain America was standing on his front porch… Peter is going to lose his mind when Steve was going to tell him about that, he may even regret going out with Tony, an amusing thought that Steve was going to share with Tony and Peter when they will return.
"I wish I can say the same..." Anton huffed, biting the inside of his cheek when Magna turned to him with wide eyes and hissed at him softly. What? It wasn't like his people weren't thinking of him as crazy, why restrain himself when he can say what he wants? He has the choice, in the end, to marry someone desirable after Tyber and his clan are to leave so why hold himself back?
"Hello." A voice called behind Tony and for the second time in the past twenty-four hours, the young teen jumped and turned around to see who was the caller, blinking his eyes when his sight fell on a brunette woman in her forties who was looking at him with a raised eyebrow and an amused look on her face, making Tony uncomfortable for so many reasons. "Can I help you with something?" The woman asked which made Tony clear his throat at that.
"What the fuck do you think you are doing?" That was Tony's shriek as he ran inside the room, getting between the crazy blond and Dum-E who was whirling and peeping like a crazy, still too shocked about the assault that took a place not a few seconds ago.
"In the ocean, it tried to bite my leg so I bit him back! He tastes like chicken, so I thought I will make good sashimi out of it!" Steve said with a happy grin on his face, causing Tony to raise his two eyebrows so high, he was sure the two of them flow toward the sun. Because Tony sower to every God out there, the shark looked at him with puppy dog eyes, pleading for salivation in any form there is, it even start flopping its fins around and look at the ocean… was Tony imagining this, or did the sun really melt his brain?
So imagine his surprise one day, when he realized that he was in love with a feisty Omega he meets a few months ago. It all started with Anthony rushing to work, it was actually his only day off in the week, so Anthony usually use that time to do the things he loved the most, inventing machines that will help people, not the guns and missiles his father forced him to create, today his father called him to complain about one of his project, not something that surprised him as his father always do that once a week, but what surprised him was his father demanding that Anthony to come right away to the company and solve the problem, no matter how much Anthony wanted to complain, he knew it would be worse if he did it, so it ends with Anthony having to suck it up and go to work on his day off.
They lay silently, basking in their closeness. Steve ended up massaging Tony's back gently, making the Alpha let out a gentle sigh in pleasure, making Steve kiss his forehead, and enjoy the closeness of his mate. By the time the knot finally subsides, Tony has turned completely into putty.
/Warning/: This Chapter contains, cursing, sadness, fluff, horror elements, we got to meet Pepper and Rhodey! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
There stood Pepper smiling as she chatted with a human Natasha and Bucky (Since when the two returned back to their former selves?) how in the name of every holy thing did Pepper manage to come inside the house without something attacking her? Tony wasn't unhappy with seeing his friend, but the thing was Tony know he will die by her hands if she realized what Steve and he were up to last night, and haven't Tony forbid Pepper from coming to the mansion?
Tony hummed as his hand starts running over Steve's chest, a happy smile taking over his face as he remembered the events of the past week. It had been a week since Tony had felled into his heat, a week since he and Steve had locked themselves home refusing to leave the bedroom unless it was necessary; a week since they saw Peter. Thankfully today was their last day before they had to face the world once more, Tony admit it was a fun and amazing week, but Tony still miss his baby like crazy and want to hug Peter tightly before going to see Harley and see how he was doing; something that his husband was feeling no doubt.
But Tony still wasn't over the fact how that idiot tried to flirt with his husband and getting close enough to kiss him if it wasn't for Tony throwing an ax at him in his anger. Because of that, Tony was now prowling through the streets of New York to find the idiot Zemo, mainly because he wanted to cut his tongue and dick and few other things before bringing him back home. Whistling softly, Tony's eyes survey the alley hoping to find the rat hiding in the dumpster like the trash he was; just how dare he? Every time Tony was forced to remember how the man not only insulted their marriage by claiming that Tony was unfit but also tried to kiss his husband, rage course inside him and he nearly shriek in rage; even Bucky wasn't that insulting and he is madly in love with his husband!
"This is it, boy, open your eyes…" Steve muttered as he finished replacing the last circuit, Steve lean back and waited for a little bit, five seconds later Steve saw a small jerk in the claw, making Steve grin like a maniac, a minute later and Dum-E wheeled himself a little and start making a strange peeping sounds and advance on Steve with his claw raised, making Steve furrows his brows at that. "JARVIS, a little bit of help please…" Steve said backing toward the computer.
As much as Steve tried to tame the nervousness he was feeling he couldn't, his heat was a couple of weeks late, not something that Steve would have cared about that much considering that his heat was never on schedule, but this time the Omega felt different, and hope starts blooming in his heart. The blond tapped his foot as he waiting, excitement taking hold of him as he tried to stop himself from glancing at the lined sticks every five seconds, when his phone beeped, signaling for him that it was time, Steve rushed toward them and give a happy laugh at the positive sign he saw, happiness warming his body as he tried to stop himself from vibrating, and probably do something stupid like taking the car and driving toward SI where Tony was.
Today was a happy day for Tony because after an hour of his mother and Angie leaving, he felt a movement coming from his baby, another half an hour and his baby woke up which made Tony cry and hold his confused baby who starts purring when Tony starts kissing every inch of his skin he could see. Dr. Banner came running after Jarvis informed him that he saw the pup wakes up after a lot of tests (Some of which made Peter cry and hold into his Mama) Tony was told his son was finally OK, that he was recovering, and in a few weeks everything is going to be good, that the could start his round of vaccine too.
"C-can we go… I mean, if you don't mind, can we repeat this day again… soon?" Bucky asked shyly, and a smile couldn't help but make itself known on Steve's face, the Alpha was so cute! He was so shy, he probably still feel out of place, the poor man, spent all of his life in the military and the only friends he has are still overseas serving, Steve was probably his only friend if you didn't count his family; Steve can somehow understand why Bucky was so shy.
Steven though just gave him a soft knowing smile, and Tony doesn't know if he hates it to the bones or if he should be wary about it. "You are him, Tony, you are Anton… or you were when I met you two thousand years ago, reincarnation can be messy sometimes." The last bits Steven said to himself, but Tony, who had a perfect hearing, couldn't help but catch them, and with that, his eyes became almost impossibly large at Steven's words.
I hope I was able to answer some of your questions, don't hastate to ask if you didn't understand a part of the story.
Tony sat down the hammer on the boards, splintered and pock-marked, and sinks to the floor. Under his heavy sleeping robes, his clothes are soaked in sweat. His throat feels raw and harsh, his lungs aching. His hands won't stop shaking, and he clenches them into fists and presses them to the boards, and tries to make himself still but tears start falling from his eyes.
"You saved me…" Loki had said slowly after he was put down on the ground of one of the near inhabitant planets that Steven could find. "Why?" Loki asked after he straightened himself which made Steven look at him with a mocking smile enjoying the anger and self-conscious that flashed on the man's face.
"W-what…?" Steve asked after he got himself together which made the Alpha frown at him and sigh at Steve while shaking his head like he was talking to some idiot, it made Steve stand on defense.
That made Steven turns to him and pauses a little, was it because of the stones? He paused a little trying to remember more… no, it wasn't. "No…" Steven said as he looked at the nightstand, touching Edith gently before taking her and looking at the glasses. "It was only a part of it… this world has no surviving chances against Thanos it seems… but it was not it… your universe, its future was wrong, was already fractured…" Steven said slowly tasting every word before he said it but knowing that deep down it was right.
Tony tried to keep smiling as he banished the dark thoughts taking over his mind; he hummed to himself as he raised his hand running the tip of his fingers over Steve's face, under his eyes, the bridge of his nose, his lips… Tony couldn't help but become enchanted with the glow Steve was emitting; the glow was brighter, it was warm, and it was… it made Tony feel safe and happy, calmness taking over him as he gazed at the diving being in front of him.
A broken heart… Steve said he lost his glow because of a broken heart, Tony wondered what it meant now that Steve's diving glow was back, he wondered what would Steve feel when he realized that his glow brightens even the darkest room in the Avenger's tower. If Steve did know he didn't point it out, he never points out how Jarvis deemed the lights every time Steve entered a room because of how his bright glow light every place he enters, making it hard to gaze at Steve without squinting or wearing a sunglass.
Clint heard a voice behind him saying those same words Natasha said, making him turn around to see Thor… whose body was sewn together like he was a Frankenstein monster. Thor though only tilted his head and grin, ignoring the horror and sick look that took over Clint's face.
"I am sorry… but have we met?" Steve asked, taking in the woman's dark brown hair, brown eyes, and red lipstick, which were a strange thing for him to note, his question though, seemed to have snapped the woman out of her shock as she smiled at the Omega, but not without confusion burning behind her eyes.
"You… y-you remember?" Bucky asked in a soft voice, his hands were shaking at the admission and hope was clear in his eyes as he took a step toward Steve; face vulnerable and eyes shining with tears. The sight caused Steve's lips to tremble, because… it was his fault?… Bucky was like this because Steve forgot who they were… it was Steve's fault, right?
The Iron King grunt unhappily when Steven hissed at him and tried to pull his hand away, to hold into his son who was shaking like a leaf when they reached the main entrance where a big muscular and blond man awaited. And Steven held back the need to recoil once the big guy glowered down at them causing his son to choke a sob and hide in his skirt. Steven noticed that this man was the one who came with the dark-haired one his beard was longer than the king's, even allowing it to be braided like the rest of his bright blond hair, and he was looking at Steven and his pup with light blue eyes. A thick hammer was strapped to his black armor's leather belt, and the low rumble of a voice he possessed was enough to send terrifying shivers down Steven's spine, "
." The woman hummed, her voice getting farther and farther away, but Peter's shaky voice and his cries get louder and louder, making Steve scream inside his mind.
Steven groans as he woke up; he opened his eyes slowly, blinking a few times to gain his vision back, when he did, he gazed around the place, frowning at the unfamiliar room he was sleeping in. Steven turned to his side, furrowing his brows when he noticed that his babe was sleeping with him on the bed, clutching his hands in one of his small ones, while the other was holding a dagger. It made Steven concern about why his babe was holding something as sharp as this, and he wondered who gave it to him, for he would have never allowed his babe to touch something as sharp as this.
"And I will! You just wait!" Harley called out, walking inside the kitchen and toweling his hair, having finally finished his shower, and getting rid of all the cream that covered his face, hair, and body. "I already told Steve, and he said you are so grounded for three weeks!" Harley huffed, glaring at Peter who squeaked from his seat near the dining table and turned his wide eyes at Tony, pleading with him to save him.
"What's wrong, Peter?" Steven asked turning to perch on Peter's other side ignoring Tony who was frowning at him with narrow eyes. "Is it because of me?" Steven questioned which made the young boy shake his head quickly, his eyes wide with disbelieve. "Then what's wrong?" Steven's soft tone caused the boy to sniff before starting to play with his hands nervously.
Luck doesn't seem to be with him today, because once he was inside of his house he saw that Howard was sitting in one of the sofas in the living room, and God, how Tony wanted to scream. As soon as Howard saw him he stood up with an understanding look on his face, and something inside Tony snapped, Howard has no right to look at him like this like he knows what it feels like to lose his pup when he was the reason for it. "Are you satisfied?" Tony said after he wetted his lips, he stopped Howard from saying anything by raising his hand which made the Alpha close his mouth and look at Tony sadly begging the Omega to understand. "He is dead…" Tony whispered looking to the side trying desperately to stop himself from crying in front of Howard, it was one thing to show a small weakness, it was another to cry his heart out in front of the Alpha, it was like admitting that Obadiah had won.
"And remember Tony, call Peggy if anything happened," Maria said making Tony nod his head at that not paying that much attention, he knows the drill by now.
But what he saw made Tony's jaw fall down and his eyes widen as he snapped his mouth shut, not even knowing what to do because he could perfectly see that Steve Rogers was getting tortured by the chair. But the thing is, the man was not thrashing in pain, he was not screaming for them to stop, he was actually smirking at them with a dark look in his eyes. "Is that all you got? Why don't you raise it ten volts?" That was what the man said as he let out a satisfied purr when they did that, and Tony swore he heard sobs and cries in the background, probably from the scientists because he was sure he heard "We are going to die!" which made Tony blink and blink and blink some more.
A pained smile took over Steve's face and he seemed lost in thoughts like he was trying to remember a sad memory, and the Omega turned to her with a sad smile. "I was sick… after what Howard did… I fell sick, and I didn't know the reason, one day my neighbor ended up calling the ambulance because apparently I caused enough rackets that she thought I was under attack when I passed out… I met him at the hospital, he was the one who informed me that I was pregnant with my son… he was kind, and always tried to cheer me up when he saw I didn't have anyone to come to visit me back then, I only knew him for two weeks before I was discharged… I guess somehow he knew I was alone with no one to take care of me or the baby… that's why after my baby was born, his lawyer came to my house, informing me that Dr. Erskine had given me this house in his will." Steve explained which made the woman give a tired chuckle… that was Erskine alright.
Jarvis looked at Steve with a tired smile. "The next room, it's attached to this one," Jarvis said pointing to the door behind him, which made Steve sighs in relief. "So what's about the pup imprinting on you? And you turn out to be Tony's, fated mate?" Jarvis asked, making Steve sigh at that.
It was when the last guest left that Steve was able to breathe in relief, his son was helping him with the dishes by taking them to the kitchen, at such a young age, and his baby showed him that he was the man of the house, it made Steve smile sadly and start cleaning the house, thinking about a way that will help him answering his son's question.
Tony Stark will blush like a schoolgirl." A voice drawl behind him, causing the hair on the back of Tony's neck to stand on its end; Tony bite the inside of his cheek hard as he turned around, glaring at the person behind him which turned out to be Ty.
Tony doesn't even know if he should cry, he really wanted to, crying he meant, but his eyes stayed as dry as desert as he gazed at the stick that seemed to mock him, laughing at his pain; Tony deserve it really, he should have listened to Steven and refuse for Rogers to touch him until he was sure that the man really loved him as who he was not for his body, but day after day Tony saw how Rogers was becoming distant from him, and he can admit he panicked a little, thinking that the love of his life will leave him any minute, so he did what he promised Steven and Peggy not to do and slept with the Rogers.
"Ah, the mouthy one, she is sleeping outside the room, poor girl, screamed until her voice was gone." Braes shook his head in amusement as he stood up, taking the cup from Steven and giving him a soft smile. "I will give you a few minutes to freshen up before calling the girl, then I will bring you some broth to eat." The Beta then left, causing Steven to sigh tiredly and turn to his baby, who seemed to have fallen asleep on his shoulder.
"Peter, sweetie, go and wait for me in Daddy's room, I will come to get you shortly." Steve smiled at the boy, shaking the raccoon in his hand harshly when the rodent tried to bite his hand; hearing those words made Peter pout and try to look at Steve with the most heartbreaking puppy eyes. "If you do, I will take you to the park tomorrow." That got Steve a grumble from Peter before the boy nodded his head and rushed toward his and Tony's room. Steve stayed until he made sure that Peter locked the door before he turned his gaze to the raccoon who gulped at his dark look. "So… where were we?" Steve hissed, tightening his hold on the raccoon before going to the elevator.
"Sorry I am late everyone, the mission took longer than expected…" Steve froze as he heard a familiar voice coming from the door, he turns toward the door and his breath left him as he saw… himself… he saw himself standing near the door, that… that couldn't be right, he was here, how could he be there? It doesn't make sense!
The only bright spot in all of this madness was the little fella Peter, an energetic kid he was, the only one who treat him like he wasn't planning for a war every time he spoke with him. Part of Steven wondered how an annoying person like Tony got such a gentle and charming boy as his son, a mystery that Steven will never be able to discover. Though the next few days Steven was a concern for how somber Peter became; were before he was all beams and giggles and cuddles, now the child will gaze at the sky now and again, sniffling before turning to whatever he was looking at before he starts again. It made Steven wonder if Tony noticed, but who was he kidding? That thickheaded man won't notice a thing if it didn't hit him in the head.
Photos…. That made Tony 'Oh' as he took the envelope from the other man's hand; he turned around on shaky legs intending to go as far away from this place as possible. "Mr. Stark… Your baggage…" The Beta said as he rushed toward Tony who was halfway through the floor toward his door… strange when did he move?
"How about the two of us go and see a movie? Or maybe we can go to any nearby cemetery and go wake up the dead, oh! Maybe we can even go dancing! What do you think, Stevie? Just you and me, like old times." Bucky asked with a hopeful look in his eyes, and Steve pressed his lips tightly, yes, his mother was right in one thing, it would have been easier for him if he fell in love with Bucky because then it meant that he doesn't have to change who he was, but the thing is, Steve never went at anything the easy way.
"Stevie!" The Alpha slurred as he changes his direction toward the frozen man, laughing as he nearly fell on his face when he tripped, but the man gains his balance back and walked toward the blond, hugging him with a happy growl. "Gosh… missed you…" The man murmured as he starts kissing Steve's neck, and it was only then that the blond regains himself and pushed Tony away while taking a step back.
"Are you crazy?!" Howard squeaked as he tried to dodge the ax that Tony threw at his head, wondering how Tony managed to get the ax that he was sure it belonged to one of the medieval armors on the second floor; Tony couldn't help a dark laugh leaving him at Howard's wide eyes, he couldn't help letting out dark giggles here and there, this was the most fun he had in years!
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, sadness, heartbreak, a lot of plot twists (?), and we got to meet a lot of different characters! Also, Steve is an asshole! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
Reaching the hospital, everything was a blur after that; he remembers Bucky taking Peter from his embrace and running to the door together, he remembers Dr. Anna as she rushed to him, he remembers them wheeling his boy away, and he remembered waiting for any sliver of good news that will cool his already burning heart.
Steve sat up and pulled Tony's hips onto his lap for a better angle, drawing the most beautiful little sounds from his lover and mate to be. He slammed into Tony's ass, and he felt his balls drawing up but he was determined to make his mate lose it first. He wanted to feel Tony clench tight around him in his orgasm. His thick cock dragged across Tony's prostate and he wrapped a hand around Tony's shaft to stroke him in time with his thrusts.
Tony let out a sigh as he reached the building, checking in his suitcase once more, he then put his hand in his suit pocket to see if the slip of paper that Clint gave him last night was still there, Clint told him that the person whose name Tony had because of the Coulsons will be able to help Tony with finding something about his son, he assured him he will, he was the best in his field. A year passes, with Tony doing the same routine, again and again, he worked with SI, he helped with the Omegas' clinic, he invents, helped with the support group, search for his pup, and have a get together in his house every week for his friends, Tony wondered since when his house became the heart of the neighborhood, probably when Winnie and Clint took a shining toward him.
"Y… you cursed!" Tony squeaked after he regains his barriers again, it was the first time he heard Steven curse, Steven the polite, down to earth, who respect every living and non-living thing cursed! It was true that sometimes their Steve will slip and let out a curse or two, but Steven? It just can't be!
"The fuck you thinking, Rogers?" snapped Stane as he opened the big doors to his house. "I can sue you for this! You hear me!" Stane snapped making Steve give him a dark smile.
Peter let out a small sigh when a long period of silence went without his mother answering him, he then returned to his web shooter. "It's Italian word…" That made Peter raises his head to look at his mother who returned to wiping the counter. "It meant a baby or little child." Steve said with a sad smile, remembering all of the times Tony… No, Anthony, never Tony… told him how he loved to start a family with Steve, how his Alpha always slipped and talked in Italian when he was happy and excited, making Steve try to learn a little Italian or he will be lost because his Alpha told him Steve always made him happy, and that's why he rambles in Italian.
Margaret finally manage to gather herself to say, and Steven's heart hurts at the idea that his babe was forced into the life of servitude, but looking at his babe, the small Alpha just gave Steven a smile, and the Omega couldn't help but mirror that beautiful smile… his baby was so grown-up for his age…
After four hours of Steve hearing Stane's confessions, he stood up making the room go silent. "Take him to his cell…" Steve said that in a low voice, making every person in the room flinch and tries to give Steve a wide birth as the Alpha took the file and walked to the door. When Steve got out of the room and walked toward his office he heard rushed footsteps heading toward him making him turn to see an enrage Howard marching toward him.
"Shut up, I do help you know, I usually do odd-jobs around and fix everything that nobody can fix or have no time to, old man Dum-Dum told me I can work with him in the garage if I want, I'm thinking about taking the job when the baby is born and old enough to come with me, maybe can teach her a thing or two." Tony explained which got him knowing looks and smiles from both Rhodey and Pepper.
It was a week later, that Barnes got the green light to get Rogers in the Avengers mansion, mainly because there were complaints from a few (all) S.H.I.E.L.D agents as they complained about hearing heavy footsteps and moans of pain in the dark hallways of S.H.I.E.L.D in the middle of the night, and the next day they all will end up finding trails of dried blood that lead to Rogers' cell. Tony being the only sane person on the team, refused for the man to be within three miles of his mansion, but it seems that Barnes was crafty, as he convinced Natasha and Clint to be on his side, Hell! Even Bruce! And he thought that Bruce was his science bro!
Steve sniffled under his blanket, gazing blankly at the TV in front of him but not actually seeing anything. Steve was drained, he was so drained and he just wanted to go back home… home where he and Tony were still carefree and didn't have the problems they were forced into at the moment; back before Howard, and Tony working to become the next CEO, back before the stalker and the phone calls and the terrorist attack… back before he was pregnant and meeting Bucky… just back. If Steve had it his way, he would wish to be back before even meeting Tony and stop himself from falling for that jerk if this is how it was going to end between them.
The fourth day Fury and Maria were back with few guests, who made Steve nearly bash his head with his own Shield, Dr. Wendy Lawson or Mar-Vell as the other woman called herself, told him about everything that he needs to know about her being a Kree spy until she discovered the truth about the Skrulls, Steve was even able to meet Talos who begged Steve to help his people and find home for them, he meets Carol Danvers, who destroyed the engine Mar-Vell talked about and absorbed the energy from the ensuing explosion gaining superpowers, Steve made sure that Natasha brought him the biggest coffee cup she could find because this was not in his job description. In the end, after Steve called Peggy and Howard, who came as soon as they can, the spent a week and a half discussing what they were going to do back and forth thankfully Steve, as usual, was able to make a strategic plan that will help every party involved.
"Oh, God, no, Peter…" Tony moan as he leans on the table behind him with his hand fisting the shirt over his Arc-Reactor. Oh, God, his little bambino was Peter Rogers, the small sickly pup, who talks about his father being the best engineer in the world, his baby was sick with leukemia, he met his baby and his baby was sick, and he end up making his precious bambino cry!
So far, what Bruce was forced to witness, made him thankful that he only gave Tony harsh glares for stealing Steve all to himself; Bruce was thankful that Steve didn't come after him like he did the others. He saw the spider-Nat who made him shiver and squeak; his childhood nightmares coming true as he saw her hiss and squeak and jump at anyone who dared to touch her, still angry that she failed to at least bite Tony and poison him. What Bruce really wanted to forget was the slim Clint, who made him scream himself so loudly he wondered how he didn't wet himself; that was an experience that Bruce wanted to forget even if it meant bleaching his eyes.
did the man not even realize that seventeen years had passed? That old fart just went straight to the cold shoulder phase and left Tony outside the house like a disobedient dog!
The next morning everyone was sitting in the dining room when Jarvis served breakfast… blueberry pancakes… Steve saw the shock and sadness on every face… Maria rushed out of the room, Howard pushed his plate and stood up, Peggy sighing and followed him out, as for Angie, she throws her plate at the wall and throws Jarvis a glare while leaving the room. Jarvis sighs and shook his head a little and went to clean the mess Angie left, only to see Steve already cleaning the mess.
"Mr. Steve saved me from that mean woman! You should have seen him, Daddy! He hit her with a chair! Just like those wrestlers on TV!" Peter said, his eyes wide with awe, and a huge grin taking over his face. When Peter's words made sense, Tony let go and gaze at Steve with wide eyes, taking how haggled and tired he looked like.
" Steven asked, tilting his head to the side when Tony let out a small chuckle, a frown taking over his face.
"You…" The witch hissed as she tried to stand up on her shaking legs, she growled and raised her hands to throw more of her tainted magic at him; it was only a few seconds later before the witch's eyes widen in mute horror, looking at her hands in shock before turning to Steve with rage clouding her eyes. "What did you do?" Snarled Wanda like a cornered beast, breathing hard as she tried to summon her magic once more but failed in doing so.
"Sorry, didn't notice someone was calling for me, was too busy trying to read to Morgan to pay attention." Tony laughed scratching the back of his head in an embarrassed fashion, trying not to let his lie slip, especially when Maria gave him a hard look as if she was studying him. "I found the book I needed in the DIY section so I decided to come here and go through a few books that I thought Morgan would like, but as you can see… I went a little overboard?" Tony grimaced, turning to the stacks of books in front of him, his acting skill made Maria sigh and come to kneel beside him, picking up a few books and scrunching her nose in distaste.
Unfortunately, being in the tower meaning that he has to do his paperwork; something that he hates to kingdom come, he still didn't crack the secret of how his paperwork clones themselves under his desk. But doing his paperwork meaning not seeing Steve or his teammates, and that meant that Tony could finally rest in peace and eat his food without fearing that it was poisoned; which was a treat for his scared little heart.
"Listen closely to me, Alpha." Steven said which made the woman raise her brow but other than that her face turned emotionless as she gazed at the Omega who was glaring at her. "I do not care why you are here, or the kind of information your king sent you to get, but know this, Widow." Steven spate the name he heard the Alpha call the woman with and he can see how her eyes widen a little at that, to anyone but a trained eye, the woman's face would have been the same, but not Steven, never Steven, because if there was one thing known, everyone loved to underestimate him, which usually ended by their death. "If you and your people, especially that king of yours hurt a hair of anyone under my protection… you all will regret it." Steven let his threat hang, and he can see how the Alpha scuff at his words, but the caution in her eyes, made the Omega smirk mockingly and sat on the floor, his relaxed body, making the woman narrow her eyes, but what really made her rush out of the cellar was the murderous eyes the Omega was gazing at her with…
"You know what, I'm leaving." Tony grumbled as he left Darcy heading to the infants' room, ignoring Darcy's laughter as she called him back in hope of gossiping about the Alpha that made Tony lose it like that, but Tony just rushed away, pausing before entering the infants' room before changing his way to the children's section, it was a known fact that Tony stay away from the infants' section like it was the plague, he knows that he couldn't handle seeing an infant after what happened to his, and Betty planned to make him go into the infants' section by the end of the month…
"Yes, I am, no thanks to you brother." Thor's brother stated, which made the thunder God take a step back, hurt coloring his face as he gazed at what Tony was going to dub as Thor2. "Do not worry mortals; I am going to leave as soon as I pay my debts," Thor2 stated with a raised nose, gazing at them with a grimace on his face, which was kind of rude if Tony had to say anything. "I wonder what he saw in you…" Thor2 muttered, which made Tony growl, finally getting feed up with Thor's arrogant brother.
If you were wondering Steve looks just like he did in 'Infinity War' with the beard an all and yes he is huge nearly six feet five, as for Tony we are taking RDJ's real height without the lifts he wore in Iron Man 3.
It was a few minutes later that the winds calmed down; leaving Tony whose nerves were already damaged by his exposure to the Addams family, alone. "Tony did you finished the… oh, never mind." Pepper gave him a confused look after she entered the office, closing her mouth shut when she saw the state of the office, she didn't even scold Tony about destroying the place, not when he was looking a minute away from homicide.
Steven had to hold his smile at that as he kissed James's head, it was maybe the first time for the small Alpha to meet someone his age. Angela and young Philips, it was true they were young, but they were still older than his James, Angela being 10 summers old while young Philips being 8 autumns and will turn to nine in two months, unlike his six winters old babe, who was still curious at the wonders of the world, but was forced to act much older than he was, maybe spending a little time with the king's pup will do him wonders… Steven hoped that the babe was not like his father.
The weeks leading to the heat were insane, that's all Tony was going to say about the case, between Steve being on a mission and not coming back until his heat occurred, establishing Peter into a new room one that will be his, stocking in on the supplies, making his nest and his instincts getting the better of him a few times… Tony was this close to pleading for his heat to come, hell, he was even ready to do a ritual dancing to summon the heat if that was all it takes to get it over with, it didn't stop him from being sour that Steve was still on a mission and was in radio silence until it was over.
Tony went over to the kitchen while Mrs. Carter circled the lounge, picking up pieces of furniture and looking despondent, the oven seemed to be working when Tony checked it and there are a couple of cabinets still standing; the ones that had been attached to the wall torn off, leaving screws and fragments of chipboard standing out sharply from the pine slats. The tall barstools that were arranged around the breakfast bar in the photos are lying on the floor; their hollow metal legs twisted up like paperclips, making Tony take a deep breath at that.
"I am so sorry Mr. Stark…" Sam informed him gently, Tony was sure that there were few sentences that he missed as he felt like he was about to faint… May Parker the adopted mother of his child was still in a coma in one of Queens hospitals since the crash, they were able to save her, but her husband Ben was thrown out of the car by the impact of the crash, a car run over him, but he was dead long before that, and his baby… his baby stayed in the car while it starts flaming… cause of death… burning… not a car crash, but burning… his baby spent the last minutes of his life screaming in pain, and Tony wasn't even there… Tony felt sick… "Mr. Stark!" Tony blinked a little as he felt someone shaking him… no, no one was shaking him, he was the one who was shaking.
"Are you up for cleaning?" Tony asked getting a grin from Rhodey, who no doubt was already planning how to clean this place and make it livable; Tony hum as he turned around, spotting a few spots that will make amazing places for installing the cameras, sensors, and speakers. A few minutes later Pepper finally arrived with Morgan in her arms; Tony never saw Pepper's eyes widen in amazement as he saw them when she and Morgan took in the small room…
Tony could see the Alpha let out a sigh at his son antics and walked toward Tony, so much for running away, when the Alpha stood before him, Tony wondered if he imagined the Alpha's eyes widen in shock, but the Alpha looked at his pup with a strange look then turn toward Tony. "I am sorry if my son caused you problems; he ran away before I could catch him, my name is Steve Rogers." The Alpha said as he offered his hand toward Tony, which made the Omega blink a little, thankfully the Alpha didn't seem like he was going to kill him.
Nebula's lips twitched into a dark frown as she followed the sound of crashing and snarling and screaming; it didn't take a genius to know that the witch was angry, furious even, and why wouldn't she? She had once again failed to take her revenge, and this time it was the Golden Bride who dared to stop her, knocking her out using a normal chair, not even using a lick of his magic. This did nothing but inform Nebula of how useless and arrogant the witch was, as much as Nebula wanted to turn around and leave she couldn't, not when her father ordered her to strike a bargain with the useless witch.
"Well… that's what I wanted to talk to you about." Tony said pulling Pepper to sit with him on the sofa; Pepper hummed happily and sat on the sofa, she then turns to Tony, happy that she was finally able to see the Omega, it had been over three months since she last saw him, the night they said goodbye to Rhodey before he went to basics. "I'm pregnant!" Tony said shyly making Pepper's jaw fell.
… the realization made Steve tears up, feeling like a failure. Steve stood up and start walking, to a specific room, feeling like the weight of the world was crashing him, if he wasn't a coward, none of this would have happened, if he just get himself together after Bucky had died, Tony wouldn't have been here right now, he would have been home, enjoying his life, falling in love, dating, choosing his own mate, and maybe he would have had a pup, instead he was here in the hospital crying and begging the doctors to let him see his pup…
Tony woke up screaming and thrashing around his bed weakly, when he felt a hand touching his shoulder, he screamed louder in a hoarse voice. The constant calling of his name and the relaxing scent of a forest made Tony open his eyes to look at the person in front of him only to see Captain America standing near his bed with a panicked look on his face. "My baby…!" Tony screamed as he tried to sit in his bed, gentle hands on his shoulders made his shout. "Give me my baby, back!" Tony screamed as he tried to shake the older man's hands when that didn't work out, he starts sobbing. "Please, please, please! Just let me see my baby, please…" Tony's voice cracked as he begged over and over again hiccupping and whimpering.
"Tony, please don't lie." Steven said gentle, but Tony was able to detect the steal behind his words which caused Tony to tense, before he gazed at his hands, letting out a tired sigh as he took the stick from Steven's hands, the man was still watching him, not taking his eyes off him.
"Calm down Steve." Peggy snapped as she held his arm tightly before he does something stupid like attacking Steven, she didn't know that Bucky was alive, Steven had spent that time talking about his husband with her, rarely talked about his friends, and it was a shock for her to see Bucky, he changed yes, grow his hair and a beard and gain more muscles than an Omega can, but it was still the same Omega she saw seventy years ago, and Peggy wondered if Barnes is still alive out there, she needed to talk with Steve about it.
Tony paused, his lips stretching wider and wider until they stilled on a dark smile that promise pain and death to everyone who dared to stand in his way. "Why? You are right, doll… race you there?" Tony asked coyly, kissing Steve's lips before rushing toward the purple grape, smiling at the dark laugh his husband let before following him…
After Steven heard Tony's thoughts about himself, he was broken-hearted with how no one realizes how much Tony suffered; it made Steven realize how much of a failure he was dealing with this younger version of his husband, it ended with Steven telling Tony a little about his life with his husband, informing the Omega that nothing was as perfect as is seems but they could only move on, that it doesn't matter if he missed up this time, he still has tomorrow to fix everything.
Singing creepy songs as Serpentine passed the halls looking for her new victim; Serpentine stopped in her place when she noticed a doll like no other in this mansion, a cursed doll. The doll in question looked like little Bucky Barnes, with the Shield and all, sitting on the floor with a dejected aura around him, sadness dripping from him like waves… and oh, my! Was that the cutest sight ever?! "Hello there, Bucky-bear!" Serpentine called out as she floats toward the doll, grinning when her suspicion was confirmed when the doll raised his head and let out delighted noises when he spotted her floating around.
Reaching the Stark mansion was a disaster because, for one thing, Tony was there, holding himself in the basement with his AC/DC music on loud, nearly deafening everyone with it, and to top it all J.A.R.V.I.S. refused them entry which made all of the Avengers sit outside of the basement door waiting for the Alpha to get out, Peggy was with Maria pounding on the door hoping that Tony will hear them and open the door to one of them… so far no luck.
"I will forgive you if you gave me your AI for the whole day!" Tony said with a grin taking this as his chance to see what forty years from now AI can do, though, he only got an amused smile and a raised eyebrow from Steven which made him grin thinking that he won.
Originally I planned to publish this chapter earlier, but then things happened which kinda distract me from doing that.
"What's on your mind?" Anthony hummed as he twirls Steve making the Omega laugh a little and look at the Alpha, which made the said Alpha smile happily and lean down to kiss Steve when the Omega was in his arms once again.
"My, my, where were you hiding?" Steve asked after the barber was done with Bucky, his words caused the Alpha to flush in embarrassment, now without the beard and long hair, Steve was finally able to see Bucky's face, and he had to say, the Alpha was handsome; the kind of handsome Steve would have tapped if he wasn't already married and pregnant, though he was 100% sure was going to keep that thought to himself, he doesn't need a jealous mate to start a fight with his poor antisocial brother.
"It was an accident, besides, who would want to peep on you," Anton stated hotly, hoping that the cold will manage to cool him down, hoping the Omega would contribute his flushed look to the cold instead of being caught red-handed peeping on Omegas like a boy who got his first knot not a few days ago.
It took months for things to go back to how they were before the incident, but they were finally there. Months for Peter to stop flinching every time he looked at Steve until he eventually starts trusting him once again; now he won't leave Steve out of his sight, finally concluding that Steve was not an evil person in any manner that he was just trying to help. Months before Steve opened up to Tony once more, slowly, so slowly coming back to how the two of them were before they went down, Steve teaching Tony how effective communication is for them to evade a misunderstanding like that again. Months before Steve starts sleeping inside Tony's room once more with Goose, causing both Peter and Tony to sigh in delight because then it meant that the two of them will have a full night of sleep without nightmares. It will take time to go back like how they were before, a lot of time to put all of this behind them and start over again, but Tony remains hopeful.
"It's the power to displacement ratio that's the real problem on these things." Phillips finally announces after a while of awkward silence which made Tony look up at him, making the man pursed his lips a little after taking a good look at him. "You need a Band-Aid or something?" Tony looked around before biting his lower lip nodding his head, not daring to ask for aspirin, not knowing what it could do to the baby. Phillips lets out a soft breath of air between his teeth and finishes up, leading Tony into the store, and the teen tenses his body a little, but he relaxed when he didn't see any cameras in the store. "You on the run, boy?" He asks over his shoulder, looking at Tony with a knowing eye, making the teen swallow and shake his head at that, causing Phillips to hum, sounding unconvinced as he goes around the counter and punches the price of gas into the old cash machine. "What are you doing in this neck of the woods?" Philips finally asked which made the young man fidget, even more, wanting to just thrust the crumbling bills at the man and high tail it out of here.
What greeted Steve though was the sound of harsh breathing, causing Steve to blink his eyes in confusion and pull his phone away from his ear trying to see if the caller was someone who called the wrong number. Seeing an unfamiliar number, Steve furrowed his brows in confusion, wondering what the hell was going on. "Hello? Who is this?" Steve asked, hoping to get an answer this time… which Steve did; in the form of the person on the other side ending the call. Steve groans in annoyance, this was the strangest wrong number call he ever experiences; it didn't matter though, Steve just snuggled in his bed planning on sleeping…
"Are you scared because you think we are moving fast or because you are pregnant?" Steve asked, studying how Tony flinches at the second half of the question which gave Steve the answers he needed. "You know this won't be like the last time, do you?" Steve murmured causing Tony to shift and look away from Steve, his hands clenched tightly into fists. "This time you have me, you have our family, and our friends are there too… in the end, the choice is yours, Tony." Steve continued, causing Tony to shudder and wipe under his eyes.
"The best? Maybe… but they are not trustworthy, Bruce is the only doctor I trust in this place." Steve said which made the group go still, if Steve said that he trusted the Beta in front of them then that spoke a lot of how talented and smart that Beta was to get Steve who has trust issues trust him, but the first part of Steve's speech, made Peggy and Howard look at one another narrowing their eyes at the doctors.
"What a pitiful sight..." Someone hummed behind Tony, causing him to tense at the unfamiliar voice, Tony's eyes widen, even more, followed by the Avengers who jumped from their chairs, their eyes widen in confusion and fear, not knowing how this strange man managed to get inside and how Jarvis didn't blare the security alarms.
Tony already hated Bucky for being in their life, Steve doesn't need any more reason to be cross with Tony when the man already think that Bucky did something with Steve (Which was fucked up, because out of the two of them Steve was the most loyal to this marriage) it was a nightmare waiting to happen from the start; still, Steve couldn't help but feel sympathy about what Bucky was feeling right now.
"Hell no! No! I despise you, Rogers! I wouldn't marry you even if you were the last man on earth! And since when asking me out turned into marriage?" Tony screamed as he backed away from him like the crazy man would do something to him more than the violation he already did. "You better hear me out Rogers because this is your last chance! If you don't knock that shit out, I will personally return you to that fucking cell you were in! I will even give you back to Hydra you crazy fuck! Stay away!" Tony then huffed and rushed out of the room, already feeling that if he stayed any second longer it meant death.
It all started after the End after they finally defeated Thanos after they got their friends back, everyone finally got their lives together…
"Did you find him, J, Edith?" Tony called out desperately, it had been six hours since Steven was captured from under their nose, everyone was on their last nerve, growling and scowling at the thought that Hydra was able to drop one on them. Peggy was the most disturbed by it, still furious about how they didn't foresee a strike from Hydra, accompanied by Rogers, who growled at the thought of Hydra's agents being in the same place as him without recognizing them, everyone wondered why Hydra had moved after Steven, and all of them had a specific reason for why they did it, either for his knowledge or for the serum in his body, everyone though knows that they need to find Steven and they need to find him fast before something happened
It took Tony three days; three days of thinking over what Angie told him, three days of holing himself in his home and never leaving or allowing anyone inside… three days of waiting for someone to come and kill him but no one showed up… it took Tony three days before he finally said 'Fuck it' and left the house with Morgan strapped into his chest. The three days Tony spent alone in the house, did give him enough time to think over everything; weighing the pros and cons of the town, of him running away from it, and his father who seemed to be catching up to him. it was a nightmare, no matter where Tony turns his back, it was a disaster that was about to take a place, a huge disaster that Tony was in the middle of.
Two years… two years since his child was diagnosed with cancer, two years of chemotherapy, two years of Steve working two sometimes three jobs to be able to pay for his son's treatment, because let's face it, chemotherapy was expensive, radiation therapy was expensive, the nights they were forced to stay in the hospital were expensive, the necessity Steve needs to buy were expensive! Two years of his son being forced to go to chemotherapy because Steve told him he will get better if he did, two years since Steve made Peter drop from school after the pup returned home getting sick and nearly dying from some infection he got, but Steve was not worried, his son was genius, so genius that by the age of 9 he was already in the eighth grade, two years… two years of being put on the list, in hope of his son getting a stem cell transplant, because at the end of the day Steve was not compatible with his pup and couldn't donate to save his child…
…" Another step from the Alpha, causing Steve to raise his head and glared at the man willing the emotions in his chest to still and not act out; part of him couldn't help but wonder, what Nicolaus was thinking of him that he turned out to be married (Even if it was forced) to the man who destroyed his home.
It was an hour later that the two of them were walking inside the mall; Steve can see the amazement in Bucky's eyes, which informed him that he did a good thing in getting the poor Alpha out of the house. The two of them spent the time chatting as they went window shopping, that was until the Omega saw a shop with clothes that may be Bucky's style; feeling excited, Steve dragged a protesting Bucky inside and start looking at the clothes with fascination, heading to the shirts and going through them, taking a few and putting them in Bucky's arms, ignoring the Alpha's flushed face as he hissed at Steve, pleading with him to leave.
Slowly thinking over the pros and cons, Tony shuffled toward the living room, deciding that he would end this fast and quick, just like ripping a Band-Aid, hurt only for a few seconds before going numb… so much for converting to the dark side, he thought he was safe, shame on him. Reaching the living room, Tony gulp as he wondered about the hell he was throwing himself in, he hoped that J was fast enough to deploy a suit if everything went south.
"Stevie, Tony! You came back! That's great how did the date go?" Serpentine's voice made Pepper flinch and gaze around the place, wondering from where that voice came from, only to shriek when Serpentine passed through her and float toward Tony and Steve with a bloody grin on her face. Tony will never admit that he nearly fainted when he saw the blood drenching the front of the ghost standing in front of him; Tony still has his pride as a man to stand still and face the ghost, wincing when Pepper continued to shriek and scream bloody murder at the ghost that she was seeing.
Once inside, the two of them were greeted by a smiling Tony, who finished preparing the dining table, Peter let go of Steve's hand and walk toward Tony, shyly, and Steve knows deep down that Tony was trying to desperately make himself stop cooing at the cute picture his son was making. "What's running inside that big mind, Pete?" Tony asked as he kneeled to be at eye level with the small boy, which caused the baby to fidget a little before his face turned a little red.
Steve's lips trembled, tears were running down his face as he tried to ignore the insisting knocking on the door with every second that passed; Steve wanted this to be over, he wanted this to stop, Steve knew that he was an idiot and that a divorce is in his path, but for the next few days, Steve wanted to play pretend and ignore that his husband and lover of seven years was going to leave him.
“Put your hands where I see them!” Ben snarled as he pointed the gun at someone, causing Steve to tense and turn his head to see where his friend was pointing the gun, only to see Howard staying still on the front porch without moving, raising his hands while throwing Ben an annoying look, though Steve didn’t help but catch the frustration in the older man’s eyes.
He wanted to scream, he wanted to curse and yell, and break things. He wanted to pick the phone and call his friends, tell them that he needs them, that he did something stupid, that he needed someone here with him. But the problem he couldn't, Rhodey has enlisted in the army, and no matter what he wanted he couldn't bring himself to bother the older man. Pepper was out there trying to get a job, trying to have a real-life with her fiance Happy, so why would she have time for him. Jarvis was gone, and so was his mother, and his father was not someone you just tell him this kind of things, you never know what the old man will do. And unfortunately, he didn't have many friends or people who will stand to be in his presence for more than a few seconds at any giving time.
"Oh, boy." Angie snorted, making Tony pout. "Kid, you just proved that Captain America is alive… and you claimed him as your Alpha at the same time." That made Tony's jaw fall to the ground. "Jarvis dear, bring the strong stuff! We are going to celebrate Tony finding his Alpha!" Angie sing-song, making the Beta smile at that, and head to the bar. Needless to say, Tony may have dug his grave but on the bright side at least his mother stopped pestering him about mating a 'good' Alpha.
