Toni hadn’t meant to push everyone away when she holed up in the shop. She really hadn’t. But years of doing just that all fell back into place. After she came home, all she could do was work. Work kept her mind off of what she was trying to avoid. Work kept her away from the people she had disappointed, away from the family she had failed.
She almost had a heart attack when the door swung open, a tall figure storming out. There was small sigh of relief when she realized it was Steve, but the relief didn’t last for long.
Thankfully, Peter had stayed asleep through the whole ordeal. If he hadn’t, Steve didn’t know what would have happened. In all honesty, he and Tony probably would have started crying right along with Peggy. As it was, they were having a hard time calming her down. In the past few days, Peggy hadn’t wanted to be very far from either of them, which was understandable, normal even. The intense amount of crying and screaming and sobbing she was doing now though? It was getting concerning, especially when she started calling out to them, almost like they weren’t there.
Surprisingly, Peter and Peggy thought the boy was a hoot. Steve and Tony had been reluctant to let Pietro around the kids, but once they knew him? Wild horses couldn’t have kept them away. He’d run around the floor and they’d laugh like hyenas at the streaks he left behind. Peggy had nearly puked the first time she was given a piggy back, but Peter just demanded another.
Peter nodded so quickly, Steve thought his head might come off. He scooped Peter up, throwing him over his shoulder. This sent Peter into a fit of giggles that both parents just smiled at.
“What the hell are you trying to do Tony?”
Tony just rolled his eyes, “I’m sorry, I was under the impression you wanted to wipe HYDRA off the face of the earth. Or was that someone else?”
Tony sighed and paused before responding,”Okay,” he shrugged out of the blanket, “what did you want to know?”
There was sleepy hum from the blanket bundle.
In the meantime, the door popped open and almost immediately, Rhodey had an armful of Peter.
The news was playing softly in the background. The watch was 95% done, as was the newest version of the suit, Mark 43. Everything was going fine until DUM-E picked up that stupid photo of him and dear old dad. And then, on top of that, there were rumors swirling on the news that Steve, or Clint, or Tasha had been hurt, or killed, he wasn’t sure which.
Steve was openly crying at this point, “So would I, baby, so would I.”
Tony bolted straight upright. He knew he needed sleep, but the nightmares were almost worse than being awake. When he was awake, he knew what was real and what wasn’t. He knew that for right now, his children were alive. His subconscious wasn’t so sure. It kept showing him varying versions of the same vision, his children, laying on the floor of that goddamn cell, dead. He kept dreaming about the different ways those sick bastards could torture them. He just kept dreaming all of the worst case scenarios.
“What?” Tony looked confused.
Fury started talking, “Listen here, our main priority right now is getting that child back here safe. Once we have one, the other won’t be as hard to get. But there has to be a way around giving the suits away. Any ideas, kids?”
Steve tilted Tony’s head to drop a kiss on his lips, “Which you know isn’t true, Tony. You’re perfect.”
The person who walked through the door, was mommy.
Steve laughed and kissed her on the forehead, pulling her so that their foreheads were pressed together, “I love you. No matter what. Whatever this test tells us isn’t going to change that. Got it?”
“We know as much as you do, Bucky called and we came running.”
The little girl was still happily jumping on the bed, “No! I’m not tired, daddy!” She punctuated each word with another jump.
“It’s not exactly what I had in mind, but it’ll do for right now.”
“We’re here, sweetheart.”
“And they were told they’d be able to get revenge?” Tony looked genuinely concerned.
Mulling it over, the girl finally deigned him with a response, “Okay, but if shit hits the fan, you’re getting us out of there ASAP, understand?”
Peter was at the compound when they pulled up and he practically flew into Toni’s arms when she got out of the car.
Tony stumbled out of bed, towards the bathroom. He splashed cold water on his face, before telling JARVIS to turn on the shower, and to have coffee waiting when he was done.
“Daddy! Papa! I had so much fun today! We started learning how to write our names, and I know how to write my whole name now! And I made lots of friends but Franklin and Harry are my favorites, and they said that their parents know you. And then I said that maybe we could have a playdate, but only if it’s okay with you, and I”
“Steve? What happened?”
Toni worked and lived in the little house on PEI for six months before JARVIS paged through a 911 emergency.
“How the hell did they get from here to New York in six hours? The Quin’s top of the line and we just barely got here in seven. What kind of technology do these bastards have now?” Tony was griping, mostly to mask the fear that was coursing through him.
“I want full updates on every bit of information those bastards give up, you understand me Fury? Everything.” Tony was seething.
Steve’s voice was trembling now, but it still held all the fire and anger that he was feeling, “Toni,
He sat straight up in bed, screaming and sobbing.
Nobody wanted anything in particular, so Steve just started cooking. And kept going. He moved onto baking at one point. He continued making food, until there was no more food to make. Nobody called him out on it though, they all knew Steve liked taking care of people, and this was the best he could do under the circumstances.
The grin on Tony’s face outweighed his sassy, sarcastic tone, “Glad we could get that worked out, babe.”
Steve took a deep breath, “I can’t either. I thought that’d she’d cry or refuse to let us go or something.”
It was unsurprising really. With everyone’s pasts, it was assumed by SHIELD that they all had some sort of PTSD. Tony with Afghanistan and the Ten Rings. Steve and the ice and the war. Natasha and her past with the Soviet Union. Clint and his non-existent homelife before SHIELD. Thor with Loki and Odin. Bruce with the Hulk and Ross. Steve knew the basics needed to lead the team, but nothing more and nothing less. Everyone else just wanted to let things go and forget.
The alarm that Tony had purposely created the day they brought Peter home, it had been revamped to include Peggy when they brought her home too. Tony had grown up as the son of a wealthy billionaire, he knew that there would be kidnapping attempts. He just never thought anyone would ever succeed.
“Hey Stevie. You doin’ alright?” Bucky had that mother hen look on his face again.
For some reason, Tony was the only one left in the tower. Apparently Phil and Clint couldn’t handle whatever mission they were on. Originally they had requested Steve but Nat said that was out of the question. So she went.
time Tony, I have to tell them, ‘I don’t know.’ Which isn’t even the truth, I do know. I know you’ve barricaded yourself down here, but I also know I can’t get in without permission anymore.”
“Peter, come meet your little brother.” Toni was holding James when Peter came in, “Do you want to hold him?”
Steve was honestly startled, not expecting to hear the AI. “Yes JARVIS?”
Steve tucked Tony tighter into the blanket before speaking again, “Why didn’t you tell me? I could have helped.”
Steve sat down on the open loveseat, Toni curled in his lap, “Loud and clear, Nat. But we have some news for you guys.” The supersoldier looked up at his wife.
“Доброкачественный.”
He scrambled to his feet, trying to figure out where she went. There wasn’t another cell in the room, so he doubted that she had been moved. Oh, but what if they were hurting Peggy this time, and not him? The man had promised they weren’t going to touch Peggy, but Peter didn’t think that the bad man would keep promises very well. Where else could she be? Daddy and papa clearly weren’t here yet, so she hadn’t been rescued, but that still didn’t answer his question. Finally, he just started talking.
Their daughter got off the bed and started for the bathroom, whining the whole way, but she went. When Peggy came back, she had her teeth brushed and pajamas on, still grumbling at her fathers about not wanting to go to bed. Once they got her in bed though, the kiddo was out like a light.
Peter woke up, expecting pain. He had gotten used to being woken to the lash of the whip against his back, that he didn’t register the softness of his bed or the gentleness of the light. Instead he started crying.
Everyone ran for the elevators.
Steve jumped in, “It was positive. And that’s why we were gone for two weeks. There wasn’t a heartbeat at the first appointment and we wanted to wait to tell you guys until we had a heartbeat.”
But something was also different this time. This time, he thought he heard the shop door open. But that was impossible, only Pep and Rhodey had the override codes and they were both overseas. Tony could still hear the music playing in the background, he thought it might have been AC/DC. 	Suddenly, Steve was in his face. Like literally, right in front of his face was a wall of Steve. He could see that Steve was talking, couldn’t really hear, or maybe just didn’t want to, he didn’t know. He also didn’t know why he couldn’t talk. He kept trying, but it just wasn’t working.
Peggy was crying, not like she usually did. Usually, when Peggy cried, everyone knew about it, she was loud. Now though, she just had tears running down her face. Peter scrambled over to her, knowing there had to be a way to wake her up.
Tony was just coming up in the elevator when they reached the living room. He looked exhausted. Steve knew he had slept a little when they were a family puppy pile on the couch, but he didn’t how much sleep he had gotten while the kids were taken. His husband didn’t get nearly the amount of sleep he should on a good day, let alone during a stressful situation like this.
Tony tried talking again, “Steve? Can you hear me?”
“Let’s get you to bed, huh? I think sleep is in order.”
Steve didn’t have an answer, he just curled himself tighter around Tony and they both cried. Cried because they couldn’t be there for their children, cried because they both felt that they weren’t enough, cried because they didn’t even know if Peggy and Peter were alive.
There was a chuckle from Tony, “Well, as oblivious as you can be sometimes Steve, this wasn’t you being oblivious. This is me not sleeping in bed because it causes nights like this. I’m assuming you’re the one that brought me up to bed from the shop?”
He turned to look at Tony, who apparently had been thinking along the same lines, “Those sons of bitches.”
“What’s going on?”
Steve opened the door and the sight that met his eyes damn near broke his heart. There had been bad situations before, but Tony had never showed up on his doorstep crying. Steve also didn’t know everything. He knew that Tony’s parents were borderline abusive, but had never actually laid a hand on their son, so there wasn’t anything anyone could do. After he and Steve had started dating though? It just got so much worse. There wasn’t a week that went by that Tony didn’t show up at Steve’s house, just needing comfort. Today though, seemed to be the straw that broke the camel’s back.
Meanwhile, Nick Fury was trying to contact anyone currently residing in Avengers Tower. Much to his chagrin, JARVIS was blocking all calls that didn’t pertain to a world ending catastrophe.
It took Tony a good long while to process that, Steve was starting to freak out and think that Tony was gonna hate him, and that he’d have to move back to SHIELD, and………
He had the ring in his hand.
It was Steve. Probably with food again, not that Tony minded. If Steve brought him food, he didn’t have to stop working to go get some. It was a win win situation. Steve got to indulge in his mother henning, and Tony ate but didn’t have to stop working.
friends. And friends can call each other without needing to talk about work.”
“Please! I know you love me! Please don’t leave me! Don’t hurt me anymore! Please! Mommy, make him stop! Please! Mommy, make him stop!”
Tony pulled back and laughed, “You bet your ass I can’t believe that Steve! I feel so old!”
“CanIkissyou?” Steve said it so fast that it sounded like one word.
“Captain?”
Luck was on their side that night. They were able to get Peter and Peggy clean and redressed before Peter threw up again. His cries broke Steve’s heart.
Fury himself had taken point on the case, commanding all SHIELD personnel not working on necessary projects to report to their superiors for new orders. If anyone had any problems with the new order, no one said anything.
Steve opened the car door so that Toni could get in, walked around to the driver’s seat, and got in the car before answering, “We could always go to Malibu for a couple weeks. We’re both overdue for vacations.”
She simply pushed his hand away, “No papa! No carrot! Carrot yucky!”
It only made sense that he proposed right after the Triskelion. Toni and Sam had sat by the bastard’s bed the whole time he was out. Toni made sure to tell him how much of an idiot he was after he woke up. The doctors wanted to keep him in the hospital longer, but Steve wouldn’t hear of it.
Toni smacked him upside the head, “You are not teaching my kid to shoot arrows, dumbass. They are going to inherit the Iron Woman suit.”
“Tony?”
The look on Steve’s face still said he didn’t have a clue what Bucky was talking about, “Buck, I don’t understand what you’re trying to get at. What am I not understanding?”
Originally, they thought that marching right up to the tower would be the best way to get this over and done with. But then the boy had a better idea.
Dr. Evans just laughed and handed them the ultrasound picture, “I think you should be okay for right now to continue as you have been. As long as you’re staying away from chemicals and being
Unfortunately, Tony didn’t understand, “Steve, what are you talking about? I don’t understand.”
Tony was speechless for all of two seconds before he asked another question, “Can you tell me about the dreams and memories?”
“Steve, is everything okay?”
At first, he had been apprehensive about going to see Bucky. He knew what he wanted Bucky to be, what he was expecting him to be. Steve was expecting the same smooth talking, charming Bucky he had known before. Realistically, Steve knew that was impossible. Thus, why he had resisted going to see Bucky. But he also knew, the longer he stayed away, the longer it might take Bucky to get better. Sam had said they were making some headway with getting him to talk and move, but they thought that seeing Steve might really jumpstart the process.
Tony just rolled his eyes playfully, “That would just take all the fun out! Being Sherlock Holmes seems pretty fun.”
After seven months, they still hadn’t conceived.
DUM-E was actually the one to snap him out of whatever that was. For a flash second, he thought back to the Mandarin, and the attacks he had during that time. But no, this wasn’t those. Those hadn’t shown up in years, they couldn’t possibly be back. He shook his head to clear the thoughts. “Everything is fine,” was the mantra running through his head. Tony shook it off, got some coffee, and went back to work.
The man laughed, “Will they young Mr. Stark-Rogers? That remains to be seen. Your time is up.”
The team did their best to keep Steve calm while Tony hurried to get the suit done in time. It wasn’t going well. With the kids gone, Tony had been Steve’s rock, and vice versa. Now, Tony had work to keep him busy, but all Steve could do was wait. Fury had benched him from all SHIELD missions until the kids were safe and sound at
Tony just chuckled, “Hell if I know, just ask JARVIS. Unless someone drags me, I live off coffee.”
The first time Wanda tried to get out, Clint had an arrow stuck on her forehead before the doors had even finished opening. The second try, she had tried the stairs, but then the guards came in the elevator. The third attempt, she tried escaping off the balcony, just to get out of there, but one of the suits had come and escorted her back inside.
“As you wish, miss.”
Laura just laughed from her spot on the couch. Nathaniel was just settling down for a nap or else she would have been right next to her husband.
was affection. He’d never asked for anything materially. Simply being loved was all he had ever asked for and his parents couldn’t even do that.
Tony looked up, which Steve thought meant he could hear him, but didn’t seem to be capable of talking. Steve kept talking, but that didn’t seem to help. Eventually, he just thought, “fuck it” and picked Tony up in a hug.
The door opened. At first she thought maybe papa had found her, but the next minute that hope was dashed. The man that walked through the door looked nothing like her papa or her daddy. This man was tall, dressed all in black, and had an unkind look on his face. Peggy scrambled back into the corner, wishing for anyone to just get her out of here.
She breathed out before kissing her husband, “Got it. Now let’s see if we made a baby!”
Everyone triple checked their weapons, made sure they had coms, and prepared themselves for whatever situation they were about to walk into.
Peggy was the next to wake up. Steve felt her stirring in her sleep. At first, he was smiling, seeing her wake up. But Peggy’s movement were suddenly jerky and she started whimpering. Nightmares weren’t uncommon, but they hadn’t been happening very often as of late. Steve tried to calm her down before it got too out of hand, not wanting Peter or Tony to wake up before they were ready. Soon though, that became impossible.
Toni heaved herself off the couch, ignoring Nat’s gasp as she grabbed her phone, “I’ll get the jet ready, I can be there in four hours, tops.”
“Ya know, I thought
Peggy and Peter were already scrambling off the bed, “We want breakfast! Pancakes, daddy! Pancakes!”
Sam walked back in, “Everyone’s ready to go. Peter’s asking for you guys though, wrap it up quick huh?”
“Okay… But only if we get ice cream after, and only if I don’t have to come back if I don’t like it.”
Despite everything else they had talked about that afternoon, Tony still couldn’t get Pepper’s initial question off his mind. Steve noticed that night.
“It appears Sir is in distress. I would advise proceeding to his floor immediately.”
He had wanted to take the one who had spooked Nat with whatever the fuck she did, but couldn’t find her. She had been whisked away almost immediately by a blur. Clint assumed it was another enhanced, but hadn’t gotten a shot or a good look.
The fourth therapist was a perfect match. Peggy walked into the office, clinging to Steve, practically on the verge of tears. They started talking to the doctor and it was like her first day of preschool all over again. She didn’t even notice her parents had snuck out the door.
“As always, Captain.”
“Peggy, listen to your father. Go brush your teeth.” Steve had put on the Captain America voice, the one that made anyone do anything, whether they wanted to or not.
“Of course,” Steve slid under the covers, Tony curled in his embrace, “I’ll stay for as long as you want me.”
Tony tried to stammer out an answer, but Steve beat him to it.
Holy hell, when did Pepper video call him?
“What’s up, JARVIS?”
“Where have you guys been?!? Nat said that you went on a two week vacation and didn’t tell anyone anything! I’ve been worried sick! You guys can’t just run off on me, what if something happened?”
He smiled, his daughter was adorable, “I promise, baby. Be up in a minute.”
Tony was fine. As long as no one else figured out his problem with sleep, he wouldn’t have a problem. And they wouldn’t. Partially because he had banned JARVIS from telling anyone, and also, he was well versed on running on adrenaline and caffeine.
So sometimes, having the tower to himself was nice. Like when he wasn’t needed on a mission. That was on rare occasions, but they were still nice. He could work in whatever conditions he wanted, promises to Bruce be damned. Coffee is a food group, and no other food groups were not necessary. This all worked out until one day…..
Tony desperately wanted to tell Steve. He wanted to tell Steve everything, but just like before, the words just wouldn’t come. He had seen the way Steve and Barnes were getting along. If Tony kept himself out of the picture, the kids might even forget about him before the inevitable divorce.
Bucky sighed, “You’re so oblivious I don’t know how you’ve survived this long. It’s pretty obvious to me why Tony locked himself in the shop. You know him better than I do, you should have figured this out by now.”
Tony came back with a response, “Yeah, just finishing up our delay. What’s up, Platypus?”
“Daddy! Papa!”
Peter continued to talk through his sobbing, “But I don’t want you to go! I don’t want to be by myself! Please don’t go!”
Steve pulled away to get a blanket and maybe some water, but almost immediately, Tony latched onto him.
It had been a long road in between then and now. There were certainly ups and downs, having superheroes make up your entire family was a bit different than the average family. Pietro had insisted on going on missions with the Avengers when he turned seventeen and every time, his parents just about had a heart attack out of worry. Sure, the boy was faster than anyone they had ever seen, but that didn’t mean his parents didn’t worry about the worst case scenario every time he went out on a mission.
Tears were springing up in Tony’s eyes, “I know sweetheart, I know. I’m sorry, but it’s the truth. If that’s what it took to bring them home, I’d do it in a heartbeat.”
Pounding and more creaking.
Both Steve and Tony moved to talk to Bucky. He was still explaining what had happened when Peggy started talking. What she started to say shocked everyone.
Pep just laughed, “You know, Tony, we
The couple waited for a handful of minutes. They hadn’t gotten a response yet and thought that maybe just tucking her in between them for a nap would be the best option. But then, Peggy started talking. Really talking, in full sentences, spitting them out like she had done it her whole life.
He stopped talking so Tony could take over, “And the final woman you were named after? That’d be my mom, Maria. I don’t know how or why your grandma married your grandpa, but she did. And they had me. And your grandma Maria, was also a saint. Because she put up with both me and grandpa.”
But as much as she groused about his initial invasion of the shop? The rest of their lives were history after that.
“The big bosses are in that vault. Dead or alive. I don’t know much else.”
Nobody had to do anything. The HUD locked onto the life signatures and all of their would be assailants were dead in seconds.
As they were walking down the ramp, they expected to see Peggy, waiting for them with open arms. Instead, they saw a frantic looking Pepper, a look no one had ever seen on the normally put together woman. Immediately, Steve and Tony were jogging rapidly towards her, sensing that something was wrong.
He padded towards the elevators, “J, shop. Now.”
“Peggy, can you look at daddy?” Tony was whispering into her hair, “Can you look at me, peanut?”
“No, sir, but Agent Romanov is on the premises. Shall I contact her for you?”
When Peggy started crying, Tony was wide awake. He and Steve had become accustomed to hearing Peggy cry over the last few months. It still wasn’t a pleasant sound to wake up to, but Peter used to wake them up by dropping on their bed from the ceiling, so waking up to Peggy crying wasn’t the worst way to wake up.
As they got closer, Tony noticed the tears gathering in Pepper’s eyes and immediately began thinking of the worst case scenario, “Pep! What’s wrong? Where’s Peggy?”
Tony thought it was probably a stupid question, but he was acting like a therapist so, “Back where?”
Steve let out a sigh, “Yeah, JARVIS. Thanks.”
It had only been about an hour when Peter started to stir again. The men were intrigued, in testing, that serum had taken a normal man hours to get through. Peter was still a child, so comparing his test results would be difficult, but not impossible. They would just have to keep watching and waiting for the right time.
Tony was starting to cry, so Steve started talking again, “We named you after these people because they were strong and beautiful and smart, Peggy. We named you after these women, because we love you. We love you so much there aren’t words, baby girl. Sweetpea? We love you to the moon and back and then some. You’re staying right here with us. And if anyone tries to take you? We’ll send Uncle Bruce after them, huh? Sound good?”
Suffice to say, there was enough security surrounding their potential criminals for the family to remake the pancakes that had been abandoned earlier. The kitchen, and the kids, was once again a mess, but it just made Tony and Steve smile all the more. They hadn’t been together like this, with the kids, since Peter had first come home. They were all relearning how to react and act around each other. But it was good. They were good. Life was good.
They flanked her as they made their way to the elevator. Sam was the first to talk, “Not yet. They’re pretty sure he’s gonna wake up soon. He’s been talking in his sleep, mostly about you.”
Instead, he popped the face mask up, “Yeah buddy, it’s me. Can you step back so I can get the door open?”
Steve had gone to see Bucky after Tony had come up from the shop. He had waited until Nat and Clint were finished training for the day, Tony was just too exhausted to take care of the kids.
So this is the last chapter before the epilogue. At this point, I don't foresee continuing this series anymore. There might be a few one-shots but I don't see writing another long fic like this one. If you have any ideas for another longer fic with this series, leave me a comment. Thanks for reading!
Rhodey and Sam were with her when the machines changed tune just a bit. The whole team had been hearing the same steady, slow beeping pattern for the entire week. They were all intimately aware of any and all changes in the rhythms.
Peggy’s eyes shot open, looking straight at Peter. She stared for a few seconds, before shooting forward into Peter, sobbing.
“Toni!”
Sam jogged over to the elevators, “Hell yeah I’m comin’, those munchkins mean the world to me.”
Peggy walked over to Tony and hugged him, “You’re not old, daddy. Papa’s a lot older than you. So is Uncle Bucky. Either way, you’re not old.”
This is it guys! It's finally finished! I did add another part to this series. Some of you were asking about what happened to Wanda and that one shot explains. You should probably go read that before reading this epilogue. I really appreciate all of you! You guys don't even know how much. As always, thanks for reading!
They fell asleep, dead to the world. Wild horses couldn’t have disturbed their sleep. When Peter and Peggy woke up, JARVIS called Clint and Natasha, knowing that Steve and Tony had 6 hours of sleep combined in the last 72 hours.
“Wrong answer, Stark,” Fury looked like he had already been over this, “you know as well as I do, that if those motherfuckers have magic, they won’t have to physically be there to pick the damn thing up. Any other brilliant ideas?”
They met in the hallway, each heading to the bedroom they had been called to. Tony walked into Peggy’s room and was immediately met by the scent of vomit and the sounds of Peggy crying.
Steve was still holding Peter. One, because he didn’t ever want to let their son out of his sight ever again and two, because Peter wouldn’t let go. Even in his sleep, he had an iron tight grip. Not that Steve minded, when Peter latched onto Tony like this, Tony usually ended up with bruises from how hard Peter hugged. Steve could hold Peter for hours and come out completely unscathed. Right now though, it was a slight hindrance. Tony and he were trying to talk with Bruce without waking Peter up, it was proving to be quite the task. Everytime they started talking above a whisper, Peter would stir or mumble, prompting the trio to lower their voices even more.
“Miss, Captain Rogers has been injured. From what I have discerned, his injuries may be life threatening. Ms. Romanov is demanding to speak to you. Shall I put her through?”
were given out to a select few people.
Peggy was still crying when Tony and Steve had brought her upstairs. She was trying to talk, but they couldn’t understand her underneath all of the crying. They just took turns holding her, until she latched onto Steve and wouldn’t let go. Tony was surprised for a minute, but quickly recovered, grabbing her blanket off the back of the couch.
. He has two wonderful children, with
Tony was gonna work with it, “There you are, sweetheart. We love you with all our hearts. We wouldn’t give you up for the world. We love you too much for that, beautiful.” He paused before continuing, “Do you know who you’re named after?”
Her face softened just slightly, “Blame you for what, Steve? What is there to blame you for?”
“Always happy to be of service.”
She could practically feel Steve staring holes into her back. After awhile, she gave up on trying to work.
“His brain activity indicates that it’s entirely possible, Mrs. Stark. As of right now, it’s a waiting game.” The doctor was fiddling with a pen while he talked. If he was nervous, that couldn’t be a good thing.
Toni could see into his eyes now, those eyes that used to be so full of love and devotion, now overtaken by hurt and betrayal and anger. She could see her reflection in the tears.
Right after the Mandarin, Toni wasn’t sure that she wanted to rebuild anything at Malibu. Steve convinced her to at least build something. After seeing his fixation with heat and sunshine, Toni really couldn’t say no. So, she rebuilt the house at Malibu, albeit this time, further back from the cliff.
watering, “Yeah Buck, it’s me.”
Until one day, his secret wasn’t a secret anymore.
Finally, Tony just thought, “Fuck it,” and hugged Steve as best he could. Considering Steve was slightly taller, and much more muscular, it was harder than he expected. Tony continued breathing deeply, hoping that with the closer contact, Steve would start breathing easier.
“Yeah, daddy. We missed you lots!” Peggy was still bouncing around on the bed.
They had started just after the second appointment and had only gotten worse from there. One minute she’d be laughing her ass off over something small and the next she’d be sobbing her eyes out for no good reason. It was just ridiculous! She had work to get done before she couldn’t work anymore and these stupid mood swings weren’t helping. At all.
Tony was on the verge of crying, “Steve, I love you. I need you here. I want you here.” He didn’t know what else to say.
Her bastard of a brother just laughed
When Peter saw what they had, he just laughed. The men all looked at him, puzzled,but didn’t bother asking him any questions. Now Peter knew how they had gotten the suit so easy. That suit was one of the oldest daddy had. And, it didn’t have everything they thought it did. Peter could see that several panels had been taken out and replaced with fakes. He just kept laughing. Finally, the man in black had had enough.
And then they were back at it, trying to take this bastard out. They worked beautifully as a team. Or they did, up until this douchebag’s mask fell off. And then Steve looked like he had seen a ghost.
Steve also groaned, “Before the sunrise, he is your son.”
The man just grinned up at her, “What else can I say, I’m being interrogated by the great Black Widow herself. I’m honored.”
“In addition to that, we don’t typically deal with child abuse cases. The
Sharon was still desperately trying to calm Peggy down. She and Pepper had tried everything. You name it, they had tried it over the course of the last 14 hours. Peggy had taken a short nap right after the team had called to say they were on their way home, but other than that, Peggy had cried almost non-stop. Usually, Peggy just cried, there weren’t words or anything to go along with the crying. Now though? The crying was constantly interspersed with Peggy’s heartbreaking pleas.
Peter was pulled out of the cell, out of the room, and down a hallway.
Grinning, Steve obediently got into bed. “Sir, yes sir!”
Bucky looked up from his book, “Yes, JARVIS?”
“I don’t know what you’ve done with my sister, but if you hurt her, you’re going to be sorry! My daddy is Iron Man, and he’ll find you! My whole family will find you, and then they’ll take me home, and we’ll find Peggy too! You’ll see! My family isn’t going to be happy, and you wouldn’t like Uncle Bruce when he’s angry, I’ve seen the TV. He turns into the Hulk! You better let me go while you can! They’re gonna be here any minute now! There’s no way they won’t find me soon! And Papa won’t be”
Peter was still thinking it through when the door opened again. This time, Peter moved before the dart could hit him. There was a pause before someone new came in. Peter didn’t know this person. It wasn’t the usual man in black, but a man with long hair. His arm was metal, how cool was that?
“Happy Easter, Steve.”
“It’s upstairs, daddy! I can’t carry it! It’s to big!” She descended into another fit of giggles.
Tony was already running towards the elevator, “JARVIS, I need all the details you can give me. Get me to Steve STAT!”
Tony continued, “And then Afghanistan and, consequently, Obie. And then after that, there’s the whole, I died going through a wormhole into space and was scared back
JARVIS finally convinced Tony to leave the lab, claiming that Dr. Banner had some urgent news. Tony wasn’t inclined to believe him. That was often the excuse JARVIS used, when really the info could wait for later. But, considering what the family had just gone through, Tony didn’t think Bruce would call him down for anything less than an emergency. It was worth at least checking out.
And Tony cut him off laughing at how fast their son was talking, “That’s great squirt, but let’s get you in the car first. And then we can talk over ice cream, huh?”
He wasn’t prepared for what he was about to hear. Peggy had been talking more and more after starting school, but when they got her back from HYDRA, she had stopped talking almost completely. Now though? Peggy was letting out a constant, non-stop stream of words.
Steve was startled out of his drawing, “Yes JARVIS?”
Steve was now laughing through the tears, ‘God, baby, no! Bucky and I were ever only friends! Yeah, he’s attractive, but I wouldn’t leave you for the world.” He rested his forehead against Tony’s, “Why didn’t you just talk to me, sweetheart?”
Fury just hung up, muttering under his breath the whole time, “Who the fuck do these motherfuckers think they are? I’m gonna kill Stark.”
Tony went to get up, “I-i said i-it’s nothing C-cap. Sorry J bothered you.” He turned to look at the ceiling, “JARVIS, don’t do that anymore.
Tony thought that maybe going to bed with Peggy might calm her down, Steve went with it. That was how they calmed her down from nightmares, putting her in between them and making a family sandwich. If that didn’t work, they didn’t know what to do.
It didn’t even begin to prepare Toni for seeing Steve. Because when she walked into that hospital room? She almost started crying all over again. Her husband, her Steve, the man who had always seemed so invincible was laying in a hospital bed. His face was almost as white as his sheets, he was hooked up to a ventilator, and was to so many other machines, that Toni didn’t even want to count them all.
Soon enough, they pulled up the last known address of Peggy’s parents. He sincerely hoped for their sakes that they weren’t there. The couple and their extended family were all angry. How anyone could do such unspeakable things to their innocent little Peggy was beyond any of them. If they hadn’t wanted her, why hadn’t they put her up for adoption in the first place?
“Does he blame me for the kids getting taken? Is that why he won’t talk to me? I could take it if it was that, but I don’t even know why. I just know that we brought the kids home and then he barricaded himself in the shop.”
James Camden Stark-Rogers was born on June 16, 2018. He weighed 7 lbs 10 oz and was 20 inches long. He had inherited Steve’s blonde hair, but had Toni’s gorgeous brown eyes. There wasn’t a dry eye in the room when the team came in to visit. All of them were crying and cooing over this newest addition to their little family.
“About before.”
Tony scooped his son into his arms, “Hey squirt!” He was also trying very hard not to cry, “Sorry it took us so long. We just didn’t know how to find you.”
Dr. Turner was fantastic. She didn’t specialize in children so when Bruce had recommended her, the couple had been skeptical. However, after the first session, everyone knew they had to look no further.
Normally, Toni let Pepper take care of meetings, especially the ones overseas. Now though? Now, Toni begged Pepper to find her meetings that would get her out of the compound, begged for the overseas meetings that would keep her away for weeks, begged for anything that would work as a distraction.
“Stevie?”
“As you wish, Dr. Banner.”
“Actually, that’s how she got my attention. She asked me if we had ever considered finding Peggy a therapist. She started the conversation with it and we never came back to the subject.
Tony sat down and sighed, “You’re right! Fine! We’ll try it!” Then, “If either of you tell Steve I said you were right, I’ll set DUM-E loose on your floors.”
“Loud and clear.”
This chapter will lead more into Peggy's past. It might be moving kind of fast, but I didn't feel that I could write enough filler info to not have this change be abrupt. Enjoy!
Tony had been working in the shop for four days straight. He’d probably had two hours of sleep a night, if that. He told himself that he was just gonna lay his head down on the workbench for a few minutes. That didn’t work out so well.
Shouting again.
“Any particular reason you’re laughing like a maniac, dearest cousin? Because if there is, do please enlighten us.”
Steve opened his mouth the speak, but Tony held up a hand, “Just let me finish? I know now that that was dumb and unnecessary. I realize that my fears were entirely unwarranted. But I just, good things end up going bad for me at one time or another. I didn’t know how to react. I’m sorry, Steve. Can you ever forgive me?”
You’d think that playing hide n seek with two ex-assassins would be rather annoying, but with the kids, they were perfect. They hid in places that were almost too easy, but the kids could find them after looking for a bit. Those two had blossomed together and got along with the kiddos swimmingly. Tony had a bet going with Steve that Nat and Bucky had moved in together, Steve didn’t believe him.
“Yeah buddy,” Steve shook his head slightly, “I’m fine. Why don’t you guys take your dishes to the kitchen? And then you can ask JARVIS for a movie?”
The couple shared a look over Peter’s head, what had happened that would make Peter so panicked? Fortunately, upon hearing that Peggy was safe and sound at home, he cuddled right back into the family sandwich.
Wanda stomped off, fuming, planning, and not being able to believe how naïve her brother was being. The next person that came through the elevator doors was hers, her brother could go fuck himself.
Tony thought he was getting better. At first with the team moving in, his anxiety was worse. But he soon figured out that he trusted these people, to a point. He figured out that having other people around was helpful sometimes, and other times annoying but that was besides the point. It was nice to have Bruce to bounce ideas off of. It was nice to be able to call Thor or Steve if an extra hand was needed in the shop, because let’s be honest, DUM-E wasn’t super dependable.
The man just laughed, “Who I am is not important young spider. As for what I want, I want to see the downfall of the Avengers. I want to take what your parents hold most near and dear to their hearts ripped away. God knows they’ve done it to enough people.”
Tony whispered something that Steve couldn’t make out, even with supersoldier hearing. He asked Tony to repeat himself. This time, he could make out what Tony said.
Tony nodded.
Tony’s voice started out in almost a whisper, “My gosh, I thought you’d never ask. I thought I had been imagining it for the longest time.”
By this point they were in the bedroom. Steve dropped Tony onto the bed before going to pace by the foot.
In the end, it took the six of them just over three hours to find all of the eggs. And then it took them a good long while to count out all the money they had found in the eggs. The patterned ones had candy in them, but the plain ones just had money.
“Is Nat in her apartment?”
Daddy was moving now.
“Who are you?”
“It was the same spiel as usual. You know, the one where I never do anything right?”
Toni didn’t have an answer. She dodged around Steve and ran for the house. He didn’t follow her or say anything, he didn’t have to. Toni could feel the daggers he was glaring at her back even after she closed the door.
Tony was in fact talking. He was trying his best to calm Steve down, but wasn’t sure that he could hear him.
They started by all sleeping in Steve and Tony’s bed that night. It was clear the kids weren’t going to be able to sleep on their own anytime soon, and if their parents were being honest, they didn’t want to let either Peter or Peggy out of their sight.
Tony was already getting back to work, “Yeah Rhodey. Definitely.”
“Steve, I don’t want you to ever think you don’t belong here or aren’t needed here or,or anything of the sort ever again. I love you. I need you. Isn’t that enough? Also, can I call you sweetheart?”
“Sir is in the shop, as he has been for nearly 96 hours.”
Peggy’s whisper was so quiet they barely heard it, “Promise?”
Tony just smacked his chest when he got up.
“H-have you eaten to- in the last 24 hours?”
Peter woke up first, probably due to his heightened metabolism. At first, he couldn’t remember what had happened. Then he saw the cell walls and Peggy laying on the floor beside him. And then he remembered everything, the fire drill, and the big man in black, and the shot in his neck that had made him sleep. He figured that something similar had happened to Peggy. He tried to wake her up.
Cuddling closer, Tony was silent for bit before speaking, “I just, I thought, I saw your face when you saw him in that bunker. And I just thought that you wouldn’t want me anymore. And I thought that if I distanced myself, it would hurt less when you asked for the divorce.”
“Great! Then Hannah up at the front desk can help you schedule your next appointment and I’ll see you again in a month! Sound good?”
He pulled the ring out of his pocket and put it back on Toni’s finger, “You will be, I promise.”
And that was all Steve could get out of JARVIS during the elevator ride.
“Maybe,” Pepper took a deep breath, “maybe she’s ready to talk? Or maybe something happened to her while HYDRA had her. She mentioned a mommy a few times. It scared the shit out of us, Tony. Sometimes, it didn’t seem like she knew where she was. When she’d mention mommy, she’d beg for her to stop.” Pepper paused and pinched her lips, “I think you should ask JARVIS to show you the tapes of when you were gone. I can’t even begin to explain it.”
They were back at Dr. Evans’ office a month later. The couple was radiating happiness, especially after they got the news that their little boy was perfectly healthy.
Pietro didn’t come home very often, despite the fact that he could be with them in minutes if he really wanted to be. Tony had also given the kid a car, not that he really needed it. Peter and Peggy both missed their older brother something fierce when he was gone. They were happier than clams in high tide when he came home.
Toni heard Steve whisper, “Oh my gosh, we’re having a little girl! Sweetheart, we’re getting a little princess!”
Peter was waking up again, he could tell. He could feel the concrete underneath him. There was a cot in the corner, but he had been standing when they shot the dart at him, leaving him to wake up on the floor. He lifted his head and looked around. Seemed to be the same cell, still no Peggy. As he was starting to speak, the door opened again. The man in black stepped inside this time. Peter just glared at him.
Steve looked up from cutting Peggy’s pancakes and started laughing. Peter, somehow, had managed to absolutely
Tony turned his head to kiss Steve before he answered, “Yeah, Steve. We did good.”
Eventually, both kids emptied their stomachs, which let them get some rest while Tony and Steve cleaned the bedrooms. Having two kids was messy enough, but having two sick kids? It made the whole floor look like a pigsty.
“Dr. Banner?”
In reality? It felt so fucking real Tony just wasn’t sure anymore. He kept seeing the Chitauri ship blowing up with the nuke, but at the same time felt himself being waterboarded in Afghanistan. He kept seeing Yinsen die, over and over and over again, while also seeing his dad throw tumblers of scotch at him but ultimately hitting the wall. He kept feeling all the times no one else was home, when the belt would come out. At the same time, he was felt like he couldn’t breathe, like he was in space again, with a suit that wasn’t prepared for that.
The man stared at Peter for a while longer before turning around and leaving the room, just as quietly as before.
Sam just laughed, “I’m gonna get outta here before it gets weird. Just hurry it up, okay?”
Peter woke up, back in the cell. He woke up with scars all over. He could feel the ones on his back, and see the ones on his chest. They weren’t hurting very much anymore, but he could tell they had not very long ago. Peter groaned a little as he sat up, looking at his surroundings.
Okay, panic attacks, Steve could handle this. Sam had dealt with these before and Steve had helped. He could help Tony now. Steve was careful not to touch Tony, not knowing how he’d react. He tried talking first.
“Not good enough. They don’t love me. Nobody wants me. Problem.”
“Tony?” Steve asked tentatively. He wasn’t sure how Tony was going to react, seeing as his usual response to concern or love was to brush it off with smart remarks.
with open flames, you should be able to work right up until you deliver. Be extra careful lifting things though, weight can really harm you at this point.”
“You ready?”
“Okay, so I know we’re married and we have two kids, but what do I have to offer the guy? Sure, I have money, but you know as well as I do that Steve doesn’t care about money. He grew up during the Great Depression for God’s sake! What else do I have to offer? He has a damn long history with Barnes, something that I could never compete with! I’m just trying to avoid the inevitable heartbreak here!”
Tony liked to think this was when he would open up to Steve, tell him his fears, confide in his husband, just like he used to. Unfortunately, that’s not what happened. Peggy’s confession? It was another excuse to throw himself into work. Now looking for both their kidnappers and Peggy’s biological parents.
“Peter Parker Stark-Rogers. Did you really think you could get out of here? I must admit though, seeing your spider skills was most impressive. We may just have to test those later.” He paused, Peter wasn’t sure why, “For now though, we shall wait for your sister to wake up. I do hope she doesn’t have anymore of those pesky nightmares.”
Peggy woke up sobbing, which wasn’t anything new. The new part was, papa wasn’t there. Neither was daddy for that matter. She looked around through her tears, and found that she was surrounded by bars. It didn’t look like anywhere at home.
“Don’t go.” Steve thought he heard Tony whisper.
“I’m sure you noticed how unlived in this room was?”
“Where’s Peggy?” The boy had an almost manic look in his eyes.
Tony woke up in the shop, again. There had been a time when if he fell asleep in the shop, he’d wake up in bed. But that had been before Barnes showed up. Before he decided Steve would be better off without him.
Nat’s face was suddenly on the screen, “Stark, I don’t know where you’ve been or what you’ve been doing, but I need you to get to New York. ASAP. The doctor’s aren’t sure he’s gonna make it through the night. How soon can you be here?”
Ugly, earth shaking sobs were coming out of Toni’s mouth and it was only then that she really started talking, “I was so scared when I found out I was pregnant again, so fucking scared, Steve. I already wasn’t good enough for our little girl and she’s dead because of me. I killed our child because I wasn’t good enough! So I figured that getting pregnant had to be some sort of sick joke from some higher power because why would I lose one only to have another taken from me so soon? And then I hit the five month mark and all I wanted to do was come home but I didn’t think that you’d want me anymore because I was the one who lost our little girl in the first place!”
The good news?
Peggy was giggling like mad, Tony was blowing raspberries on her tummy, the surest way to make her laugh.
“Sir, it appears that Peggy is being dropped off on the front steps.”
Dropping a kiss on top of his head, Steve started whispering, “Of course, sweetheart. You know I love you, right? With everything that I am? I’ll love you forever and always. It’ll be alright, Tony, everything will be okay. You’re safe now, you’re with me. I love you.”
Steve was staring at him with those goddamn baby blues and perfect pretty face and damn it! He wasn’t supposed to be thinking about Steve like this! Especially not right after a panic attack.
The elevators doors opened, and Peggy and Peter were literally sitting on top of him. Tony couldn’t help but smile.
She finally did and the smile that spread across her face was huge. Toni’s voice came out in a whisper, “I’m pregnant!”
The boy was trying to catch his breath, “I don’t know. We both know we can’t run from Tony Stark for forever. He’ll find us sooner rather than later.”
Steve had his uniform on already and was strapping the shield to his back. Tony had his flight suit on and the platform was primed and ready.
“Hey squirts! You wanna let me off the floor?”
“Rhodes, if you’re still out, stay out. The more people with Peter, the better. We’ll be out in a few minutes.”
“Those should keep him out long enough to take out the rest of these goons. We’ll pick him up on the way back. Bruce has more sedatives on the jet.” Steve was still just staring, “Steve, babe, we gotta move.You with me?”
It went on for so long that sometimes it didn’t even seem like Peggy knew where she was. She just kept calling for Steve and Tony. Early on, she had called for mommy. This had baffled both Pepper and Sharon, knowing that she didn’t have a mommy here. Maybe that was who had abandoned her in the first place? Neither of them knew, they were just trying their best to calm Peggy down. She hadn’t been put down the whole time the team was gone. One of the two of them holding her at all times.
“What?”
“Hey Steve? Tony? Guys? We’re home. You maybe wanna take the snuggle party inside to include your daughter?”
“I know, I know. I can’t believe I’m saying it either, but the best place to keep potential enemies is close. And if we keep them at the tower, JARVIS can keep an eye on them. They won’t be able to do much.”
“And I’m gonna cut you off there Cap. I’ve got work to do.” He also started berating JARVIS with the typical, “I’m going to reprogram you and give you to a community
“Bucky?”
Peter perked up at the mention of DUM-E, but still wasn’t totally convinced, “But I’ve never been alone before, what if something happens?”
The man just laughed, “Oh but we do have the suit young one. A complete Iron Man suit in exchange for your sister, that was the deal. For you though, I do not think there is going to be an exchange. We will simply give you back when we are ready.”
“As you wish, miss. I wish you the best of luck.”
The next chapters will be more from the kids' points of view. So they might take a little longer than a day.
Fury just rolled his eye, “Loud and clear, Stark. You two lovebirds get back to your kids, huh? Let us do our jobs?”
The words were slurred, but definitely there, “N’t a b’by.”
Rhodey and Sam were waiting outside. The looks on their faces didn’t bode well, not well at all. She almost broke down crying right then and there, but she held it together for now. Partially because both of them had the decency to not bring up the very obvious condition she was in.
All in all, Clint was rather disappointed by what they found. There were a few low level goons, but the top dogs they wanted had either gotten out or bit the bullet. Nat and Steve knocked out the ones left over before they could bite the bullet as well.
Bruce was the first to speak, but it wasn’t to Tony or Nat, “JARVIS?”
Steve just chuckled, focusing on their son, “Language.”
Fury was clearly mocking them, “Bingo! That’s why you two aren’t allowed. You’re related. You both know the rules.
Several weeks later, the same thing started happening again. This time though? There wasn’t anything that could have triggered it. He was down in the shop, as usual, and the whole team was safe in the tower.
labor until after my water breaks, which could be hours yet. I really need to get this stuff done, going upstairs can wait.” She had been working on these projects for weeks, double time, as she knew that once the baby was here, there wouldn’t be much time for work.
Bucky woke up. He knew his surroundings were unfamiliar but didn’t know how he was supposed to react. He knew that he was no longer in the Winter Soldier mindset, but he also didn’t know where he was. His memories were still fuzzy at best, nonexistent at worst. There must be a reason why he was here. It definitely wasn’t HYDRA, meaning he had either been captured or rescued. Either way, he was locked up. Again.
Peggy tried to speak, but nothing came out. She closed her mouth and tried again, but still, nothing.
Peggy was talking in her sleep. Except that it really wasn’t like talking, it was more like whimpering and pleading. Steve was concerned but knew from experience that he shouldn’t wake her up. Peter was still blissfully asleep, curled into Steve’s side. Thanks be for small miracles. What really concerned Steve though, was that Tony was nowhere to be found. He would have asked JARVIS if there was chance it wouldn’t wake the kids, but he decided not to risk it.
“It appears that you and Miss Romanov will be needed to take care of the children in the morning. Shall I alert you when they wake?”
She sees him moving his tongue before she can reach out and stop him. In the next minutes, the man is convulsing violently on the floor, foaming at the mouth. His last words?
At that, Steve’s face took on a completely different expression, but he was still wringing his hands, “Okay? Really, Tony? That’s the question you go with? Is everything okay?”
Steve laughed up until he heard her sharp intake of air. He looked down at his wife. Her eyes were as big as the shield, staring at the stick in her hands. He waited for Toni to look up.
A pause came before the response,
“Daddy, do you have to go?” Tony was holding Peter, the boy understandably didn’t want to let him go.
That was as far as Peter got before the door opened. He opened his mouth to speak before he saw the dart flying towards him. He wasn’t fast enough to jump aside before it stuck in his leg. He felt himself collapsing, and then darkness was all he knew.
His words were starting to slur and Peter was starting to feel sleepy. He just tried to keep talking,
Fury stormed into the conference room, there was a look on his face that none of them had ever seen before. It certainly didn’t bode good things. The group had been frantically trying to think of a way to fool the plan to get Peggy back. Honestly, Tony was ready to sacrifice anything to get his daughter back. Clearly though, they couldn’t just let anyone have the Iron Man suits. There had to be a better solution.
“As always, Sir. Should I search for anything in particular?”
The speedster’s head was buried in the fridge, so his response was mumbled, “No, but it’s really not so bad, is it? I mean, we get our own floor, unlimited access to just about anything we could want,
“Have you two ever considered getting Peggy a therapist?”
They tried IVF. Toni went through three rounds. Her doctor recommended that with everything her body had gone through that they wait for a cycle in between tries. When the third cycle wasn’t successful, they had decided to wait. No point in getting their hopes up again.
Tony turned the lab stool around to face the music, “Pepper! To what do I owe this call? I reviewed and signed all the stuff you sent over yesterday.”
Here they were, two years later, waiting on a pregnancy test. And Toni could honestly say that this was the longest five minutes of her life.
Even as he was berating his husband, Tony stepped forward to hug him. After all these years, just a hug from Steve had the power to calm him down.
They landed at SHIELD and immediately stormed in the front doors. Everyone cleared a path, not wishing to get in the way of the most powerful couple on earth.
The kidnappers were going fairly well. HYDRA was so cocky it wasn’t even funny. They blatantly put faces, names, new identities, the whole works on their servers. And unfortunately for them, very little of their data had been deep sixed before Tony got to it. The team, along with SHIELD was bringing those bastards in one right after the other.
Technically speaking, she had more meetings with the headquarters here in Spain before she was done, but there was no way she was going to any of them. Pepper probably already had them covered.
Both parents kissed the top of his head, but Steve was the first to talk, “Nope, Peggy’s home. She’s been asking for you.”
Taking a risk, Steve pressed a kiss to Tony’s head, “If that’s how long you want me, then yes, forever.”
And then a few years after that, when they finally decided they both wanted children.
Steve huffed out a sigh before turning to walk through the door, heading back out to the kids. He turned around just as Tony was getting comfortable.
“No! NO! Papa! Don’t go!”
Natasha had her lips set, “Guess we’ll find out soon, huh?”
Peter’s voice broke him out of his thoughts, “Papa? Papa? Are you okay?”
Peggy's torture begins. Nothing graphic, just a lot of verbal abuse. Read with caution.
A creak, followed by another jolting sound,
Steve sat down on the bed and wrapped an arm around Peter’s shoulders, “I’m sorry, Peter. She didn’t make it. The baby’s gone.”
Blearily, Tony stumbled to the coffee pot, “Yeah J, let her in.”
“And think about what Tony would want you to be doing right now. Would he want you beating your hands to a bloody pulp on the punching bag, or would he want you to find a way to help?”
The tears just wouldn’t stop coming. He’d held them back for so long. For the first two weeks or so, he thought that maybe it was just Tony being Tony, not wanting to cope with feelings. Granted, that hadn’t happened since before Peter came along, but it had been a possibility. After the first two weeks? Steve knew there had to be something else going on. He wanted to be there for Tony, he really did, but he couldn’t when Tony wouldn’t let him.
Slowly, Steve started unwrapping his hands. He picked the broken bags up and piled them in the corner, maybe they could be repaired. Steve picked up his gym bag and headed for the elevators, only glancing over his shoulder when he didn’t see Sam.
His heart breaking as he did so, Steve kissed the top of her head and handed her to Pepper. Peggy started crying and Pepper was immediately comforting and shushing the girl. Bucky was in a similar situation with Peter.
And that was it. They got in separate elevators, went to separate floors, and only saw each other when Steve came up from the gym, not looking anymore relaxed than before. Tony on the other hand, had a smile on his face that JARVIS hadn’t seen in weeks. Probably because Tony hadn’t hardly seen his kids in weeks.
“I’m gonna head to the gym for a bit, can you watch the kids until I’m done?” Steve wouldn’t meet Tony’s eyes.
“There’s nothing wrong,” the words burned coming out of Tony’s mouth, “I was just working on cracking all the encryptions on the HYDRA files. And you know me, once I get started on one thing, I find something else to do. So I worked on Nat’s Widow Bites and that led to working on Clint’s arrows. And then I got to thinking about Barnes’ arm and that led into putting together prosthetic designs. And then the encryptions were finally decrypted so then I started running worldwide facial rec programs but then those had to be updated. And I’ve just been really busy. I swear, as soon as those bastards are found I’ll be upstairs more.”
Clint was the first to speak the entire ride there, “ETA 5 minutes. Get ready.”
“Captain Rogers?”
“Ya know, Buck, I’m really not sure. They both told me they could manage getting dressed on their own.” With this, Steve leveled his children with a playful glare.
Steve was busy setting up detonators while Tony worked, “Nope, we’ll sort it later. Just get everything. We’re gonna blow this place skyhigh in a few minutes.”
JARVIS wisely kept silent, for once in his life.
Tony shut him up with a kiss, “Okay, okay! I get it!”
The elevator door opened and Tony stepped out, “So what’s going on? What did we find out from that bastard?”
Steve woke her up, five hours later, when they had landed in L.A.
They fell into bed together that night. They fell in like they hadn’t since Malibu. It wasn’t the same and they could both feel it, but neither of them said anything. Both of them were just trying so desperately to feel something normal, they just kept going. It was sweaty and dirty and everything Toni would have ever dreamed of six months ago. But when they fell asleep that night, tangled into each other, there were tear tracks down both their faces.
The next two weeks might as well have been a second honeymoon for the couple. They spent their days split between the beach and bedroom, a situation they were both extremely content with.
If anyone asked, Tony was most certainly not crying after the doors closed.
At first, he wasn’t sure why he had woken up. Everything looked the same and the Assemble alarm wasn’t going off, but then JARVIS spoke up.
From the shadows, the henchmen heard a mutter, “Perfect. Send the girl.”
“Is Steve upstairs?”
Tony’s nose wrinkled at the title, “Don’t call me Mr. Stark, Mr. Stark was my father. Whatever happened to those sweet little nicknames?”
“Peggy? Peggy! Peggy! You gotta wake up! Peggy!”
So I realized that they were supposed to trade the suit for Peggy and that I didn't talk about that. I honestly didn't mean to do that, I just had a thought about how to finish Peggy's story and went with it. I'm going to cover that in this chapter.
Tony rolled over in bed and groaned. Steve just laughed at him, “You know you make the better pancakes, babe. They haven’t had them in ages.”
to life by the Hulk roaring thing. Anything else you want to know?”
“Oh sweetheart,” Toni was pulled tighter into the solid warmth of Steve’s chest, “you are good enough. You were good enough then too. Losing our little girl wasn’t your fault, it wasn’t anyone’s fault. You. Are. Good. Enough. You’re more than enough for me and you’ll be the best mother to this baby too, right?”
Toni Stark started dating Steve Rogers a year after New York. Pepper had been pushing her to meet new people, go out more. Toni hadn’t seen the appeal. That is, until Steve had come back to New York for good.
Steve was the first to speak, “Actually Pietro, we’ve got something we want to discuss with you before you go. If that’s okay?”
Fury met them in the lobby.
One minute, Peter was copying down words for the spelling test on Friday, and the next, the fire alarm was going off. This wasn’t particularly unusual, they had fire drills once a month, it was just startling. The teacher gathered them all in a line by the door and led them out to the parking lot. Suddenly, Peter was being pulled out of line. He thought maybe it was Harry, he was in a different class than Peter, but they were best friends. Peter looked up, it definitely wasn’t Harry. The man was tall, almost as tall as papa, and he was wearing all black. Peter was about to shout for help when he felt the stab in his neck. It felt like the flu shot he got last year, and that was the last thing he remembered.
The girl looked at him like he had lost his mind, “You want to do what?”
“Daddy! I have a present for you!”
Natasha’s face softened considerably after hearing Tony’s confession, her voice was practically a whisper, “You really believe he’d do that to you?”
“Peter! Peggy! We’re gonna be late! C’mon guys, your father will kill me if we’re late.” Steve was tugging down the sleeves of his suit jacket when his two youngest spilled out of the hallway. He couldn’t decide whether to laugh or to coo at the cuteness. Peggy was six now and learning what went with what fashion wise. Apparently, she had been in the middle of trying on another outfit because her dress was only half zipped.  Peter had parts of his suit on, but the jacket was trailing behind him and his shirt was only half buttoned.
Peter had a thing for his arm. Of course he did, Tony Stark was his father, he would have an obsession with a metal arm. He had so many questions that neither Bucky nor Steve could even begin to understand. Peggy on the other hand, really liked Bucky’s hair. She especially liked the fact that he allowed her to decorate it with all of her sparkly little clips.
Just gonna say, be prepared for more and more angst as this story goes on. Starting in this chapter. Sorry, but also not.
“Loud and clear, Cap. We’ll get ‘im home.”
Steve had been down earlier, just sitting and drawing. Also occasionally distracting DUM-E but that wasn’t the point. The point was it was now almost 8 AM, and Tony had said he was going to bed around 9 the previous night.
“I believe so, Captain. Shall I tell him he is needed here?”
JARVIS came back with a reply a few minutes later, “Agent Romanov wishes me to inform you that she will be up momentarily. Can I do anything else for you, Captain?”
Peter let out a positively huge yawn, “Tha’s good, papa. C’n I take a n’p now?”
Steve and Tony looked at each other. They knew he wasn’t talking about having an accident, Peter had been potty trained by the time he was three. They had discussed his spider powers and decided to keep those a secret for the time being. There shouldn’t have been an issue there. Their little boy couldn’t possibly know he might be kidnapped, could he?
“I did? I just got up early and fell asleep again?” Tony phrased his statements less as statements and more as questions, knowing Steve wouldn’t buy the excuse either way, they knew each other too well.
“Peggy, honey? Can you talk to daddy? What’s going on, honey? Can you talk to daddy?”
In all honesty though, after Steve showed up, Toni’s mind was otherwise occupied. Despite the quarrels on the helicarrier, there was no denying that the man was insanely attractive. The things she could imagine doing with that man....
“No! They were so good. Felt like I was back.”
Steve jerked awake, thinking that Peggy was having a nightmare, only to discover that it wasn’t Peggy that was crying, it was Peter. Tony was already running for Peter’s room when Steve heard Peggy.
A groan this time.
Tony simply shook his head, accepting the blanket gratefully.
Thanks for reading and for your patience!
Steve’s heart broke in two at that, “‘m not going anywhere Tony. Just getting a blanket.” He figured the water could wait.
Tony wasn’t actually as upset as he seemed and everyone knew it. The team had moved in going on six months ago. It had started with Clint, and Tasha had followed him. The rest just decided to follow suit until all six of them were living at the tower. Sometimes they just absolutely couldn’t stand each other, but most of the time it was like one big happy family. Key word being most.
Tony was making his way towards coffee, “Yeah, J. Hit me.”
Tony was trying to keep his sarcasm in check, it wasn’t working, “Well thanks for that update, Captain Obvious. I know we can’t just leave it.” His attitude turned serious after this, “But what can we do? Even before she got taken, Peggy didn’t talk a whole lot and
They ended up watching Grease. Steve didn’t understand why the movie was so important. Tony just gaped at him.
When Toni got back to the villa that night, the door was cracked open. Slowly, she set her briefcase down and activated the gauntlet watch, just in case. If there was a real intruder, JARVIS would have told her, but any intruder was unwelcome at this point.
By the time Sam and Rhodey got back, Tony had been pacing for what seemed like hours, while Steve sat on the couch with his head in his hands. Eventually, he stood up.
Peter was squirming to get as close to his uncle as possible when Tony responded, “Nah, it’s pretty much ruined anyways. Just leave it and we’ll blow it sky high with the rest of this hell hole.”
All eyes then turned to Steve, apparently deeming Clint’s alibi acceptable. For now. Steve however, was buried in whatever article he was reading. It took Tony literally shouting at him to look up.
Peggy scampered back off to the elevator.
He burst in, expecting to find that someone had broken in. Expecting to see Tony being tortured. Expected to see blood. Expected to have to fight his way through.
They both just sat and stared at him until Steve plucked Peggy off, prompting Peter to also scramble away.
It wasn’t like he needed other people around, he was perfectly fine working on his own. Bruce was always going on and on about lab safety, while Nat and Steve always tried to convince him that coffee was not the only food group that mattered, and for that matter, that coffee was not a food group. Whatever.
Talking usually helped calmed Peggy down, and Tony heard Steve speaking as he turned to get the blanket,
(See the end of the chapter for
The family eventually moved towards the bedroom, hoping that maybe they could get Peggy to sleep if they were laying down. Tony thought trying to get her to talk could wait until tomorrow. The rest of the team was downstairs interrogating Peggy’s captor, trying to find Peter. Right now though, Peggy needed both of her parents, and they weren’t really willing to leave her side.
“You can pick her up at two. See you then!” The door was firmly shut in front of them.
. If he wanted anyone else, he would have done it long before now. He’s been driving himself crazy taking care of those two wonderful kids and trying to figure out what he did wrong. He thinks that it’s his fault you’ve locked yourself down in the shop. He loves
“How much work can I actually do? Because my
“Tony? Tony?! Can you hear me?” Steve asked.
So, when he woke up from dream after dream after dream of his mom and the Howlies, of course he started crying. It wasn’t just crying either. No, this time it was full on sobbing. The kind of sobbing where it seemed never ending. Eventually it had gone on so long, Steve felt like he couldn’t breath. And if Steve felt like that, then he probably actually couldn’t. This feeling sparked memories of Bucky and his ma, and all the times they had been there through the asthma attacks. Those memories only made him cry harder, which made the breathing problem worse.
Bruce sighed, “If that’s the best you can do JARVIS, then thanks. It’ll have to do.”
“Yeah, J. Let him in.”
“Daddy, wake up! It’s Easter! The Easter Bunny was here last night! Daddy! There’s candy!” Peter was being entirely too chipper for this early in the morning.
“Steve! What do I have to do to convince you?” And then Tony thought, “Well, already here, might as well tell him.”
He walked towards Tony, “Hey, sweetheart. You feeling okay?”
These people kept trying to get him to talk but he didn’t know any of them. How did he know who he could trust? If he told anyone anything, that information could be valuable. He just kept repeating his name, rank, and social. Over and over, just like in Zola’s lab, all those years ago.
A look of pure relief washed over Steve’s face, “Well, there’s a lot of movies on my catch up list that I haven’t watched yet. We could pick one from there?”
Five minutes later and every asset SHIELD could spare, and then some, was mobilized in the hunt for the Stark-Rogers children.
The man started laughing, “Your parents aren’t coming for you little girl. They’ve left you, just like your first parents. None of them wanted you, nobody will ever want you. Nobody is coming for you.”
“Sir, Captain Rogers is requesting access. Shall I let him in?”
himself in maple syrup. He hadn’t just spilled a little here and there, it looked like the whole bottle had come open when he was trying to pour it.
Steve’s eyes were most certainly
Without an answer, Tony just interlaced his fingers with Steve’s, dropping a gentle kiss on his lips.
He peeked out from Tony’s shoulder. Upon seeing his papa, Peter put his arms out. Steve was all too willing to oblige. Tony wrapped his arms around both Peter and Steve, making a sandwich out of Peter. Until Peter lifted his head so quickly that he almost broke Tony’s nose.
Everyone else looked away while simultaneously looking at both Clint and Steve. Both of them were completely oblivious.
And spill Steve did. He told Bucky all about how he and Tony had first met, that meeting was a doozy. Then he went on to talk about their dating life and subsequently their wedding.
Tony was quicker to wake than Steve was, “Okay buddy, we’re going. Just give papa a minute to wake up, he’s an old man you know.” A wink was directed in Steve’s direction as Tony said this.
Pietro ran to get it. Coming back, he was slightly slower, given that the basket was a special order from Wakanda. The thing was truly the biggest basket that any of them had ever seen. When Pietro finally managed to drag it out to the living room, he and his siblings started going through the baskets. Steve and Tony settled back on the couch, both of them with massive grins on their faces at the joy radiating around the room.
Thank god, there was coffee in the cupboard. “Great. Get the jet prepped. I’m moving to Canada. Indefinitely. Let Pepper know, but no one else. Tell her if she tells anyone,” this coffee was better than anything she had ever tasted, “she’s fired. Got it?”
Clint was still rubbing his head while everyone else gathered around to extend their congratulations and well wishes.
All three of them skidded to a halt outside of Peggy’s door. The sight in front of them was tense and fear filled, but also heartbreaking on a new level.
Tony spoke up first, “J, what he means is if Steve does anything suicidal, will you please let all of us know immediately?”
“Pietro!”
Natasha and Clint were making their way deeper and deeper into the bunker, picking off HYDRA agents as they went. Originally, Thor had been with them, but then Rhodey had been called away and Sam had been left without a partner. It was fairly easy going, she wasn’t going to lie,
“Okay, okay!” Steve held his hands up in a surrender motion. “If you think Peggy would be willing to talk, I say we go for it. If it doesn’t work, no harm no foul, right?”
Oh, he couldn’t forget the arguments they’d had before bringing Peggy home.
Steve’s expression turned serious, “Why didn’t you just talk to me, baby? You know you can come to me about anything, right?”
Tony continued trying to get Steve to breathe with him, but to no avail. Steve just kept gasping and wheezing and sobbing. There seemed to be no end in sight.
Peter nodded miserably, burying his face in Tony’s shoulder. Tony just cuddled Peter as close as he possibly could.
The suit would have gotten her there so much faster, but she couldn’t fit in the suit anymore. The drive from LaGuardia to the hospital was agonizing, every second felt like she should have been there, should have saved him, could’ve done more. It was a never ending cycle until Happy pulled up at the hospital, opening the door for her, just like nothing had changed.
“What do we do now?” The girl was playing with her red light.
Steve hugged Peter just slightly tighter before asking his own question, “And Bucky? Bruce, how is he even alive?”
That first kiss was six months after New York. Steve was there. Steve was there through the panic attacks and Malibu and the Mandarin. Steve was there is a way no one but Jarvis, Rhodey, and Pepper ever had been. He had been Toni’s rock through the whole process.
By this time, Peggy was crying again. Tony and Steve both looked about ready to murder someone, but their first priority was their daughter.
Eventually, Tony’s breathing evened out to a normal rate. The shivering never quite stopped, but Steve was more focused on trying to get Tony talking.
“Peter, Peggy, I want you to go to the living room. Mickey Mouse is on. Stay there for now, okay?” Steve was looking directly at Tony as he said this.
Steve bent down to hug Peter, “Bud, we’ll be back in a few hours. You have to go to school though buddy. We talked about this, remember?”
Eventually the tremors and audible gasping stopped. Steve didn’t notice at first, but did when Tony started to move.
“Daddy? Are you gonna come see your present?”
“You’re pregnant?” Toni didn’t think she’d ever heard the assassin’s voice go that quiet before.
