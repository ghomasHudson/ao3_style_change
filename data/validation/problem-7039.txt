Even after everything, he sounds so eager to come back and see James, Bruce feels a pang of pity for him as he watches Steve leave.
“So what’s the deal with you and Stark?” Clint demands, as soon as Mae is out of hearing distance. All his best charm used up apparently.
The only thing keeping Steve from punching this guy is the knowledge that he’s too angry to do it without killing him.
“We’ll tape them inside my bra, dear.  I’ll tell them I have a pacemaker.  You think they’re going to pat down an old lady there?”
Tony’s relationship with the pretty physics professor ends two days later.   The bruises fade and they don’t come back.
“Not entirely,” Tony says.  “There’s a restaurant a couple miles from here.  They’ve got the best cheeseburgers in New York.  Eat one, and the miles will have been worth it.”
It helps to have Bruce around.  Bruce levels Tony’s anxiety out in a way that few people can.  And this time Tony knows where they’re going and they have much bigger fish to fry.  Plus he’s got a kick ass gun courtesy of his dad.  That’s cool.
He sounds a lot less tough now that Natasha’s around. He’s comfortable with Natasha, Bruce realizes. He can hear it in Clint’s voice. And with Clint taken care of, it’s easier for Bruce to focus all his attention on James.
“Sounds like, doesn’t it?”  Tony forces down the urge to fight.  When he speaks again he manages to dial down the hostility a notch.  “Barnes needs brought in.  It’s not safe for him to be out there on the loose.  But what you’re going to do with him once you’ve got him--  once he’s here--”  Tony shrugs.  “I’ve got no fix for that.”
Tony groans, but he’s smiling.  He’s smiled more in the last three days than in the whole year previous.
“You and your paperwork,” Tony grumbles, though there’s absolutely no bite in it.  He’s fighting a smile as he stares down at the paper.  “What if this is all weird and one-sided and he was only interested that night because he was drunk?”
“I don’t need to see,” Steve says.  “I don’t think you’d cheat on me.  And I know if you did, you damn sure wouldn’t lie about it.  If you say it didn’t happen, it didn’t happen.  End of story.”
There’s a moment of silence before Tony speaks again. “Does that mean we can start now? I want to get a look at your arm before we start singing kumbaya.”
answer and the way the conversation steers to absurd if Bruce ever asks to know anything too specific. Which means Tony isn’t as accurate as say... CNN, but he’s a hell of a lot more interesting than the latest breaking news.
“No ring yet,” Rhodey says. “Not even any real dates yet. That’s what this conversation is about. Was supposed to be about anyway, before we got derailed by the Tony Stark Talk Parade. Pepper and I both agreed we wouldn’t move forward without your blessing.”
“I’ve gained a lot of perspective this season. And while gaining that perspective I made a few major mistakes. Some are public knowledge, and others not so much. I’m not sure what can be fixed and what I’m going to have to live with, but-- for the first time in a long time, I have hope that things can get better. Hope in second chances and fixed mistakes.”
“Sam’s gun is more of an appetizer,” Natasha replies, with a slight smirk. “Move back a little. I’ll show you dessert.”
She waits for Tony to scoot away from the table then reaches under the edge and gives something beneath it a hard twist. She slides out a drawer.
Emergency with Barnes. JARVIS will fill you in. Can’t call cause I need to keep the line open for Bruce. Think he’s gonna need me.
Steve cocks his head slightly to the side, like a confused golden retriever.  “Did I say something wrong?”
James fixes him with his best irritated glare. Considering James is flat on his back it’s pretty impressive. “You should hate me.”
“The computer can look,” James says.  He gets up and walks inside, a clear indicator that he's lost interest in the conversation.
Despite the warm water, Bruce’s muscles are still tense. He’s not going to relax until he knows everyone’s okay.
“Okay, well, Iron Man doesn’t exist anymore so your boyfriend might as well be imaginary, and my boyfriend punched Hitler,” Tony argues.  “I win.”
It’s definitely a StarkBar though the packaging has changed. The ones that Bruce had carried with him were prototypes and wrapped in silver, quick seal foil. These are... flashy. Specifically, they are covered in pictures of Bruce and Tony, making ridiculous faces and printed with BANNERBAR in bright purple along the side. The pictures must have been taken from different security feeds in the lab. No doubt JARVIS had special orders to save any images that involved them looking like idiots.
Tony looks surprised because he knows Bruce doesn't swing that way.  Or any way.  Bruce laughs.  “Platonic friendship,” Bruce says.  “You should look into it sometime.”
James gives Bruce a look like he’s doing him a favor by humoring the hand on the knee plan.  Bruce doesn’t mind since he considers the side-eye from James a kind of progress. If James is engaging at all, Bruce is going to take it as a good sign.
Bruce has an office somewhere in the building.  Tony has never seen Bruce's office, because 99% of the time, Bruce is in Tony's lab, and the lab is comfortable and there's a smoothie machine, and when Tony leaves the safety of the lab something always goes wrong.
Tony raises his hand again like he’s going to start pounding and Steve just blurts out the first thing that comes to mind.
“I’m the opposite,” Bruce says. “Right after... I don’t want anyone around. But a few hours later company is nice. At least when I think I deserve it.”
He goes for a certain level of chill when he opens the door, and it’s immediately lost the second he actually sees Steve. They’ve been texting so much, Tony’s completely forgotten exactly what being close to him feels like.
He says nothing. Somehow Tony manages to kick the door closed and then they’re crashing into a wall, kissing, touching, grabbing. It’s rough, a little like hockey, but there’s no parting here. No hip check and skating away. Tony never wants to let Steve go. Ever.
“Can we just fucking drop this?” Tony demands.  “I’m never going to feel like things are equal with Steve so if that’s the end all be all of a healthy relationship we are fucked.”
“No. Please,” Tony says, in a sort of urgent rush. Like he’s afraid Steve’s going to bolt. “Please come in. I need to apologize. Profusely. For being a giant dick. It won’t take long.”
he jumps, the suit will catch him before he hits the ground.  Drastic, sure, but way more pleasant than this line of questioning.  As far as messages go, Tony’s pretty sure it will get his point across: He doesn’t want to think about it.
They’ve been home a week now. They haven’t left the tower and they probably won’t for another few days, so it seems like as good a time as any to get the YouTube Outing over and done. Tony rolls out from under the car, and he’s got smudges of grease on his cheeks and something else goopy on his forehead. The look Tony gives Steve is equal parts amused and surprised.
With all the distractions gone, Bruce finally has a second to consider how he’s going to make this work. The first step is getting James’s informed consent.
For all intents and purposes, Steve and Tony were alone for the first time in months.  When they got up to the penthouse in a few minutes they were
“There’s nothing naive about the way I feel about you.  I’ve been watching you use relationships to self-destruct for years now and I know how things ended between you and Pepper.  I’m still here.  I’m still willing to try.”
Steve looks up so the man can get a better look at his face.  “I go by Steve when I’m not in uniform.”
“Oh, sorry.  Didn’t even realized I’d picked that one out,” Steve says, reaching to take it away. “Not exactly fashionable, huh?”
“I’ve only been following you off and on,” Clint says. “I’d wait for you to get settled, make sure it was safe and no one was trailing you, then I’d go explore for a bit. Tasha brought me up to speed on what had gone down. It seemed like a good idea for you and me to stick together.”
“I’d save him,” Tony says, not doubting himself for a minute. He looks back at Steve and the sun spots fade from his vision.  “Whatever it took.”
“To answer your question, no.  We haven’t tried an invitation,” Steve says slowly.  Tony can see the strategy wheels turning.
Yes, maybe he's trivializing his own efforts-- his own efforts are stupid so they deserve to be trivialized.
It takes Steve a few seconds to even remember what it is he’s supposed to be doing. Tony is too (wonderfully) distracting.
Steve’s caught Tony working on his Iron Man suits a few times, but Tony doesn’t want to talk about it. Clint and Natasha still aren’t ready to have Tony back on the team, and they all know it. And while their friends seem to genuinely enjoy Tony’s company again, they don’t turn their backs on him.
Eventually, though, it eats at Steve.  Chafes him at the edges because he wants his stuff.  Even for one night, he wants it.  One Sunday he finally snaps and gets on his motorcycle to ride to the museum and just keeps going.  All the way to that big ugly building in New York.  It’s stupid, and he realizes just how stupid as he’s walking in the front doors of the building and he doesn’t even know if Stark’s there.  Or if Tony will even see him.
“Bruce told me about the neural feedback you've been experiencing,” Tony says. “A brain scan would help us figure out if that’s because of something in the lower wiring or up there in your head. You up for one more quick test before we cart this stuff out?”
Tony kind of understands. The bathroom might be in the hall. Or the bathroom might be dying. The only thing Tony is sure about is not wanting to wet Steve’s bed on the first night he’s ever spent in it. That is not the good kind of kinky.
“I lied to you.  Obviously.  That first night when I said I got out of the army and didn’t have anywhere to go.  Or-- the part with the not having anywhere to go was true.  I didn’t want to impose on Nanna and I didn’t have the credit history for anything else.  But the army part, that was a lie.”
“If we don’t find him, HYDRA will and I’ll be damned if I let that happen on my watch,” Steve insists.  “I have to do what I think is right. That doesn't mean you have to like it.”
“No,” Steve says, without having to give it a moment’s thought.  “I think you’d be a great dad.  Have you been thinking about it?”
It’s his ‘she mentioned the arc reactor on television’ look.  Steve hates that this time he’s the one who put it there.
Steve tries to school his features into something less miserable.  “Sorry.  Just... what you said about me not being a national treasure.  You reminded me of Bucky, is all.  He never got tired of taking me down a peg or two.  I think it was his way of helping me feel normal.  Keeping my ego in check whenever he thought I was acting a little too invincible...”
They’re greeted with a whole new round of drunken hellos, and some playful kissy noises from the other end of the table from Clint and Bucky.  Natasha and Sam have made themselves comfortable and she’s on his lap.  Sam's got his arm wrapped around her waist so she can balance sideways to grab them more fries.  They look cozy.
Steve goes for a run when he gets home, to clear his head, and to silently chant “Bi does not mean interested,” as his feet fall left, right, left, right, left.
“There’s a time and a place for frugality; a first date isn’t one of them. I’m trying to woo you, here, so order what you want. Order everything.”
Rhodey laughs. Pepper leans in to give Tony a side hug. “We would never do anything to hurt you,” she says.
“I want to go with you tomorrow, if that’s okay?” Bruce asks. “I don’t want to take up your time with him or anything though, so if you’d rather I not--”
“No,” Bruce says, with a soft smile and a shake of his head.  “No, Tony treated me like I was-- like I was brilliant and valuable and human.  I can’t-- can’t really--”
He’s cut off as the steady beeps from James’s monitors begin to speed up to something more irregular and his neural alarms go off. Bruce is on his feet in an instant. James looks okay, he isn’t seizing and his eyes are still closed. The neural monitors are showing increased activity, though.
“There’s a little more,” Bruce says. He isn’t insulted at all by James’s shut down. If anything, Bruce feels better knowing that James is willing to listen to new information and sort it out for himself. “The entirety of what the scientific community knows to be absolutely certain about how the human brain stores and retrieves memories would fill about half a pamphlet. When scientists publish papers they’re guessing. Like you just said, most of it is bullshit,” Bruce admits. “But one thing pretty much everyone can agree on is that brains are resilient. And no matter what’s been done to you... no matter how much of your humanity was stripped away, I think that who you are at your fundamental core-- the version of you from the beginning-- I think that would be really damn hard to destroy.”
So instead Bruce watches James carefully and really, everything seems to be okay. James is responding fine to questions, he sits calmly on the bench that Clint drags over, and he’s looking up at Clint when Clint speaks to him. James fidgets a little as Clint pulls out the scissors and holds them out for James to inspect but Bruce can’t say that fidgeting has ever been a bad sign. He does it himself, when he’s feeling uncomfortable and needs to remember which skin he’s in.
want. If you want him to leave you can tell him or you can look at me and nod once and I’ll let him know he needs to go. Does that work for you?”
Tony can’t get to his phone fast enough. He’s been ignoring Steve’s texts and there haven’t been any new ones in days. He taps out a message and hits send before he can talk himself out of it.
They end up in the rec room to eat. And once the conversation gets started, it’s like texting but better. Better because Tony’s sure now how Steve feels. He can flirt openly without concern that he’ll put Steve off, or reveal something more than Steve wants to know. And he trusts Steve. Of everything, that’s what Steve can give him that no one else has, for a long, long time.
“Phil is dead,” Clint cuts him off sharply. “I don’t know who SHIELD has running around with his face. The real Phil Coulson never would have left me to deal with that shit on my own.”
“Sure,” Bruce says. “It was fascinating. Dr. Wilkes is a good ten years ahead of his time. Tony’s probably down there trying to recruit him for R and D as we speak.”
Again, there’s that pang of... friendship? Tony knows what it’s like to have friends, he’s had plenty of friends. He’s just not been around this kind of... domestic?... friendship. There are words for these things, but it probably speaks volumes that Tony is having a difficult time finding the right vocabulary for what’s going on.
“No,” Tony confirms.  “You did what you thought you needed to do to save some kids and some other innocent people.  If I’d known you at the time I’d have moved heaven and hell to get you home.  To have you exonerated.”
“Don’t think any of the rest of us could afford 100 shots big guy,” Bucky says, giving Tony a playful pat on the arm. “Tonight it’s all on you.”
Steve leans in and kisses Tony several times lightly on the forehead, and then down his cheek, and along his neck, to his shoulder.
When Steve and Jarvis are satisfied all the alcohol is out of the house, Steve lays down on the couch.  He sleeps all the way through to the next morning.
Tony gets up off the couch to go freshen up.  He changes into more comfortable clothes, returns to the living room, wraps the blanket around himself like a burrito, and sits down at the table to wait.  The elevator dings and Steve walks in, carrying two cups of coffee and a giant grocery bag weighed heavy with food.
Tony gets down to Bruce’s office early so he can watch Clint discover the stapler, and he takes about a dozen photos to text to the others.  The best one has Clint flopping face first into the bright red jello, apparently determined to make the prank his breakfast.
Steve expects her to continue, but again she doesn’t, and she looks incredibly smug about leaving it there.
“Natasha told me you’d dated,” Steve says.  “Would you mind if I ask what happened?  Unless it’s too personal...”
Bucky Barnes is alive. Bucky Barnes is the Winter Soldier. The Winter Soldier killed mom and dad. The Winter Soldier... went down in the helicarrier? Is assumed dead? Steve said is not dead?
“I don’t know,” Bruce says. “I never met him. I can tell you everything you want to know about what Steve Rogers is like, but Steve’s the only person who’s going to be able to give you his thoughts on Bucky.”
“It wasn’t a short joke,” Steve defends. “I’m enjoying myself. This deranged racoon thing you’ve got going on, Where you’re digging through the pantry and hissing under your breath every few seconds, is the best thing to happen to me in weeks.”
“Thank you,” Tony says.  There’s a lot of other stuff he wants to say but words aren’t always his friends and thank you is all he’s gonna get out without
“SHIELD's got nothing to do with it,” Steve assures him.  “Bruce found out I’d never had Indian food and we moved on from there.”
“Don’t do this to yourself,” Rhodey says. “What good is it going to do watching your team play without you?”
Steve’s mouth is on his before Tony has a chance to make any more words.  Steve’s hands are on his sides, tugging at his shirt and Tony’s brain goes blank except for a greedy refrain of moremoremore.  They make out like high-schoolers until they have to pull away to catch their breath.
It’s different-- good different-- to watch Tony work with his hands.  Most of the time when Steve’s watching Tony do his thing it’s the type of science-fiction-whiteboard stuff Steve has no hope of understanding. Fixing Sam’s wings is physical, mechanic-type labor and Steve could watch Tony do it all night.
Steve sounds haunted. From the look on his face, it’s by the Bucky-shaped non-ghost glaring daggers at him from the bed.
Tony leans in to kiss Steve, like he’s trying to prove a point.  And yeah-- no hesitance there.  Just want and need and relief and desire.  All things that aren’t going to cause a problem.
There's silence. Steve's gotten lost in his own thoughts and Tony can see how a trunk isn't a great place for that to happen.
“Mmmmm,” Steve muses.  He reaches for Tony’s hand to help him to his feet.  “I like when you talk baseball.  And the sooner we catch this asshole the sooner we can get back in this bed.”
Bruce ducks his head in apology, and James looks entirely unimpressed with his idea. Clint is giddy, though.
“Seriously, you thought you needed to soften us up with milkshakes for this, Rogers?” Natasha teases gently.  “I’m happy for you.  This is good news.  Stop looking like you think you’re letting us down.”
It’s a subdued ride up the elevator. Tony holds Steve’s hand the whole way to the bedroom and once they’re under the covers with the overhead lights out, Tony wraps himself around Steve like a squid. Steve smiles as he presses his face into Tony’s hair and breathes him in. Tony’s presence is warm and alive and the soft blue light from the arc reactor relaxes Steve.
“You’re the picture of evil,” James says. “I totally see it. I mean-- forget every Hydra officer who ever smacked me with a cattle prod for moving an inch out of place. You-- with your consent talk and your helping me without asking for anything in return-- You’re the one I ought to be worried about.”
He can’t stomach the thought of Tony objectified like that, no matter how much he’d like to see him without his clothes.  Especially if he was still practically a kid.  Steve knows if there are pictures of Tony tied up on the internet (and seriously
Tony turns to Rhodey and adds “You have put a ring on it, right? A woman like this doesn’t drop her standards for a loser like you every day. You’re not going to do better.”
Steve pulls out his phone as soon as Steven walks away. He has no missed texts or calls. He texts Tony.
“What kind of world would it be if all of the worst mistakes we ever made were held against us?  Because that’s the world Tony lives in.  Everywhere he turns there are people telling him he can’t make up for his past and people waiting for him to fail.”
“Very,” Tony says.  “I’d go and stay with her and her family sometimes over the summer.  They’d take me to the beach or to science museums.  I always felt like they wanted me around.  It was good.”
“Tony, can we talk about this, please?” Steve asks, loud over the noise. “Don’t you even want to know why I spoke to him for so long?”
“Me? I’m the one being dramatic? You’re the one who walked in here, told me to end the first happy relationship I’ve had in years, and then threatened to set fire to the guy’s career if I didn’t. Steve deserves better than that.”
Bruce remains silent. Tony is wrong.  He doesn’t have anything, except all of the fault here. The fault and the awful, terrible truth of his own destiny: to destroy everything around him, right down to his own good intentions.
Lights flash along the wall and Steve follows them deeper into the penthouse until he finds a hall closet that exists for the sole purpose of storing pillows and bedding.  There are a dozen blankets stashed there and Steve runs his hand over several of them until he finds an old quilt that’s well-worn and perfectly soft.  He pulls it out from under the others and carries it back to the living room.
Tony and Steve do get their revenge because once Clint closes his eyes to let the spray wash his face, Tony gestures at Steve to move back.  Steve does, and Tony springs forward, smacks the temperature controls, and then hops out of the shower range right as the water turns ice cold.
He hands the phone back to Sam, and it sounds like Sam connects her to Natasha’s headset.  A moment later Clint’s phone dings.  He checks the message.
Steve gives him a look, then digs around in his pocket for the slip of paper with their homework discussion topic for the week,  He reads the question out loud.
“I can’t tell you whether the Bucky you knew is still in there,” Bruce says. “Not because of any professional need to keep that information to myself so much as I honestly don’t know. Without ever having interacted with the original, I’ve got nothing solid for comparison.”
He leans in, kisses Tony on the forehead, and then moves as fast as he can to shove a pillow over Tony’s face.  He is
Steve’s first mission with Natasha and Clint, once they’re cleared for return to duty, drags on for ten terrible days.  Steve has a feeling Tony’s tracking him, but they can’t communicate, so he isn’t sure.  It’d be against mission protocols for Steve to text Tony and as tempting as it is, Steve’s not willing to put his team in danger just to tell his boyfriend how much he misses him.
Tony closes his eyes for a second. Tries not to think about how many times he heard those exact words from Obie. Tries not to think about how much this is going to hurt if Steve’s playing him. And then he opens them again. Steve’s looking at Tony like he hung the goddamn moon. Like he’s sunshine on the first day of spring. Like no matter what Tony decides, he’s going to have his back.
Every day the internet explodes with pictures of the new man or woman (or both) on Tony’s arm.  Every day there are photos of parties and kegs and vodka fountains.  And like clockwork, every day for the first two weeks there are texts from Pepper and Rhodey asking Steve for help.  Asking him to intervene.  Then abruptly, without explanation, these texts stop.
The blanket and sheet had pooled somewhere around Steve’s waist overnight.  Tony’s pretty sure it should be criminal to look this good while sleeping.  He can’t resist reaching over to push a stray hair away from Steve’s forehead and the movement is enough to wake him.
Maybe it’s because Steve’s old.  Maybe it’s because he lived through a war and he’s lost so much.  Or maybe it’s because he’s stupid and in love.  Whatever the reason, Steve’s not angry with Tony.  He’s frustrated; not angry.
“Then use those big brown eyes of yours,” Tony suggests.  “Bat your eyelashes.  Give him puppy dog looks.  I’m serious about kill switches.  We’ve got some medical history on him now and there’s nothing I’d put past those assholes.”
“You ready to light it up?” Bucky asks Tony as they all hurry back toward the protection of the trees.
That’s all Clint says before he’s back to chatting with Bucky and Natasha.  Tony’s pretty sure they aren’t even speaking English.  Steve takes the intrusion as if it’s the sort of thing that happens all the time, and continues on as if there was no interruption.
“You hang out with the science bros long enough you get to do all sorts fun stuff,” Clint agrees. “Plus, they’re great to have around when things breaks. Tony can hook up a DVR like a boss.”
“Fuck, I-- want this.” Tony’s incoherent too.  His hands grab at Steve to drag him up, and when their faces are even, Tony presses up to kiss him hard.  Desperate.  He shifts to open his knees further, so Steve’s weight will pin him and force them closer.  “You’re everything I want.”
“Steve Rogers would say the same thing,” Steve says.  “You-- I mean Bucky-- always hated that. That I wouldn’t just admit it when things hurt. He’d watch me gasp for air all night, and then hear me tell my mom I was fine when she got home the next morning.”  Steve draws in a slow breath, shaken by the memory.  "Some days I think he was ready to throttle me himself. He'd usually just tell my Mom, though, which felt like a fate worse than death. He always said he knew I was looking for the quickest way to martyrdom and someone had to stop me.” Steve’s voice falters on the last few words.
Steve rolls his eyes, and walks into the kitchen.  He very deliberately breaks his egg into a bowl, to put an end to the game, when Tony shouts “Winner!”
Steve turns away and walks to the closet.  “She wouldn’t do that.  She’s upset, but I don’t think she’s vindictive.”
Clint’s eyes go to the hallway, but there’s a sort of splashing sound as the water stops so Clint continues.
careful not to cut off Tony’s air.  He’s holding it close enough to be annoying but far enough away that Tony can easily breath, and be heard, and scooch away if he wants to.
“Shit,” Bruce swears, just as Dum-E lets out a string of panicked, plaintive beeps.  “It’s okay, Dum-E, accidents happen.”
“I’ll be fine,” Steve confirms.  Another lie.  At this rate Pinocchio’s nose is going to be in New Jersey by morning.
It’s not a question of how pissed I’d be. It’s more a question of who punches you first, James or Steve. My money’s on Steve.
“Tony can you hack their HR system?  See what a security badge for a cleaning lady should look like?” Clint asks.
“You know James best at this point,” Steve says from the screen.  “I trust you.  You make the call and we’ll all follow your lead.”
That sure sounds ominous.  The crowd of photographers in front of the tower aren’t a good sign either.  Steve pulls around back, up into the delivery bay, and leaves his bike there before he steps into the private elevator.
Tony’s being cagey about a lot of the details, though. It’s impossible not to notice the questions Tony
Steve walks over and picks Tony up carefully.  Tony goes limp against Steve’s chest and blinks his eyes open for a few seconds before closing them again resignedly.
“You can believe me or not,” Steve says, putting up his hands in surrender.  “All I’m saying is that it gets hot in the summer and we weren’t hauling our swim trunks across the eastern front.”
It’s only the necessity to breathe (pesky air) that separates them, and even then it’s only their faces. At some point they’ve turned and it’s Steve pinning Tony against the wall and they just stay there.
Bruce laughs awkwardly and lifts a hand to ruffle some of his unruly curls, a nervous habit Steve always finds endearing.  It had taken them a while to trust each other, but once they had, they’d ended up good friends.  It was the Mango Milkshake that did it.  Clint and Natasha had dragged Bruce and Steve out once they found out what Steve had done for them and the look on Bruce’s face when he saw his milkshake for the first time... Steve would never forget it.
Pepper considers it.  “I suppose so, yes, if getting me out of here is really that urgent.  I can look at these contracts wherever.”
“Sure, why not?” Tony says abruptly.  “JARVIS, reschedule the jet and warn Bruce we’ve got company.  Naked science time is over.”
He likes it so much that they watch five episodes straight and the sixth is about to begin before Steve looks over and realizes Tony’s fallen asleep.
At least he doesn’t have to wait there long.  It’s a huge relief when Clint steps out of the elevator, a crush of people behind him, one of whom is Bruce.
The following Saturday, Dr Gerber seems proud of them.  Nothing gets resolved, but the equality question is now an “Area of Awareness” and that’s supposedly a big step forward.
Clint yawns, finally awake, and nudges himself up onto his un-injured elbow.  “Hey, future boy right here, and I think it’s weird. too. I vote we all talk to Bruce.”
James gives another nod. Bruce presses a few buttons and then helps guide the stretcher as it lifts off the ground. His hand hovers over the comm built into the health monitors.
Pick-up games. Tony’s never played in one. Even in college. Outside of scheduled hockey time, Tony was studying. It was only after college that he got a social life, and for Howard-shaped reasons, he kept it as far from his hockey career as possible.
Steve shakes his head.  Tony’s being weird.  Or, well-- not weird.  Tony’s being oddly chatty, and he’d been oddly quiet earlier, and Steve’s not stupid.  Something is up.  They’re having their anniversary dinner at the scene of their first date.  Mae won’t stop glancing in their direction.  Tony’s fidgety.
Tony ignores the comment and is clearly delighted when the screen changes to the portrait of him, though as the seconds creep on Steve glances at Tony’s face and sees the beginnings of something less happy.  Less sure.  Then downright unfocused.
The fic is finished! Hammer and Obie get everything that's coming to them, and Tony and Steve get the ending they deserve! Getting there is a wild ride.
“James, I’m not angry with you,” Bruce grits out.  He’s too focused on keeping Hulk quiet to work on tone of voice.  “I’m upset for Tony.  And this wasn’t the best way to find out.”
“Don’t be offended if it takes me a night or two to get comfortable.  Sometimes mattresses still feel too soft.”
“Twenty bucks says the hidey hole came from Fury,” Steve replied. “The knife was Barton’s idea, and the kitchen sink is gonna come in handy. You’ll see.”
“You didn’t get into the bath that time,” James interrupts, saying it loud enough that Clint will hear from the back of the house if he’s listening.
Tony throws the phone like it burns his hand and it hits the wall hard and thunks to the floor all in one piece.
“It’s really not,” Tony says.  “Can’t hurt Barnes without hurting you.  Can’t hurt you without feeling like I kicked a puppy.  There’s no easy answers here.”
“Really?” Bruce asks Clint with a smile. “Because the last time I checked it feels like there are plenty of you. Tony’s got to count for 10, minimum.”
It’s too close to his face for Tony to read and he has to shift back in his seat to get a decent look and then it’s nothing.  Well-- something, but nothing worth noting.
“See you in a bit,” Bruce says, his expression softening when he makes eye contact with Steve. Then the screen goes black.
“Next time I’ll stay longer,” Rhodey promises, as Steve walks him to the elevator. “There’s just a lot of fires to put out right now, you know?”
Steve can see the slow, dawning misery on Tony’s face.  Like everything he’s done for the last six weeks is slotting into place in his memories.  Like the full weight of what he’s done is settling on him.
Nanna’s smile is so full of mischief she looks a good twenty years younger.  “Oh darling.  I think it’s time we show you our weapon cabinet.”
Tony doesn’t invite Steve to stay but he doesn’t seem unhappy when Steve clears off a chair and joins him.
Tony is sure Steve’s going to miss the puck. It’s a perfect shot. Fast, accurate. A biscuit in the basket, then they can move on with their lives.
Clint’s hilarious misadventures in juggling, his downright appalling abuse of ‘the ten second rule’ and his earnest love for his one-eyed dog make him a breakout YouTube star. Companies beg him for endorsements. He’s awarded free Dunkin’ Donuts for life.
“Huh.  Superman has kryptonite, Captain America has chlorophyll.  You super-beings and your weird-ass weaknesses,” Tony notes as he walks to the fridge to pull out a bottle of water.  He tosses it to Steve.  “That might be more your speed, Yankee Doodle.”
“He knew what was up,” Steve agrees.  “He helped design a few of these.  And he promised he’ll have dinner waiting for us at the tower when we get home.”
“Hobbits eat second breakfast.  There’s no such thing as second lunch,” Steve points out.  “And it’s knock your socks off, not your panties.”
“Fine. If the street had been deserted and I already had the eggs, yes. Sure. I might have tossed one or two. I’m petty, okay? Bruce thinks it’s one of my better qualities.”
And then, as if it hadn’t happened at all, Tony’s rocking back on his heels, looking all expectant and impatient and animated.  “JARVIS is gonna order us cheeseburgers and fries. We’re gonna grab some lemonade from my fridge and we’re going to drink it up on the roof.  You good with that?”
Clint looks up with so much undisguised horror at the word ‘share’ that Tony chokes on a laugh.  Nanna’s back is turned to Clint as Clint slowly draws his thumb across his neck in the universal sign for ‘Take my figgies and I’ll kill you dead.’
“Why?” James asks in a tone of thick disapproval.  With only one word he manages to effortlessly convey that his opinion has never meant anything to anyone before, so it’s stupid that Bruce suddenly wants to take it into consideration now.
It was no surprise that Clint would be with Bucky. They were thick as thieves these days and Barton spent the night as often as he didn’t. The guest room was pretty much his at this point.
He rides the elevator down to the lobby alone, and loiters awkwardly off to the side, next to a pair of cacti.  Very, very smooth.  He's not hiding.  Nope.  He's owning the atrium.  Because he owns the damn atrium. It's a very good pep talk.
Tony could do that himself, if it came down to it, but there is something about Steve’s tone that helps Tony realize Steve probably needs to do this for himself.
“Not the glass,” Tony clarifies. He walks over to join Steve and kneels down to help him with the clean-up.  “Barnes.  You blame yourself for what happened to him so now you’re the one who’s going to clean up the mess.  Even if it gets you killed.”  It’s not a question.  A question would be pointless when Tony already knows the answer.
Steve crosses the room and takes a seat next to Tony on the bench. He carefully places a hand on Tony’s wrist. Tony can shove him away if he wants. This isn’t a show of power, it’s supposed to be comfort.
“Think I can close my eyes then,” James says drowsily. “Stark or Steve... don’t want them near me til I’m awake… but they can be in the house. Will you tell him that? I’ll see Steve. Get to know him maybe...”
“And here I heard you were a genius,” Steve says into Tony’s shoulder.  “Next time I’ll try smaller words.  Maybe make an Excel pie chart or a PowerPoint.  Definitely use something Microsoft based.”
“I’ll get that,” Bucky offers, manhandling Clint up onto the table so he can lick the ranch smear off Clint's shirt.
“I was the farthest thing from bored,” Steve confesses.  He sits the muffins and the coffee down on the table next to Tony.  “Can you take a break?”
I'm sorry this fic took me a while to finish! I loved it too much to ruin it, and nothing I wrote did it justice for the longest time. But I think (and hope!) that I got it right in the end.
“No, he didn’t,” Steve says emphatically.  “He never said that was his egg.  We assumed.  I'm calling it for my boyfriend.”
“You could have meant it,” Tony says. “And I still wouldn’t have been offended. I’m-- I know I have a reputation for being an asshole, but I’m not that kind of asshole. Honestly...”
Tony buries his face in the pillow.  “I’m a shitty person.  I don’t know why that’s ever a surprise.”
“The rules are simple,” Pepper says, sounding as put together and professional as ever.  “JARVIS is texting them all to your phones now.  One, you must have your egg within reach at all times.  He’ll be watching to see that it’s never more than five feet away.  Two, no breaking someone else’s egg.  Three, the egg can be wrapped or covered but the wrap or covering must be removable and some portion of the egg must be visible at all times.  Four, the last person with an uncracked egg wins.”
“I know,” Tony interrupts.  He can’t keep the hurt out of his voice even after years of practice.  “I was a huge disappointment.”
He steps aside so Clint can enter and watches as he takes in the room like a good sniper should. Exits. Windows. Where to stand to not get shot from outside. Clint moves out of the sightlines and hops up on the kitchen counter to sit with his legs dangling over the edge.
Which makes James roll his eyes. Actually roll them, like he’s thirteen and Bruce is a particularly annoying parental figure.
“Nothing ever went on between me and Howard,” Steve rushes to assure him.  “He knew though, and he covered for me every now and then when I needed an alibi.’
“Pretty sure he could buy the Knicks,” Steve says.  “Hire himself.  I’m telling you.  He’s really impressive.”
In the best news of the day, Kate and Nanna are right behind them.  The two women blend in with the rest of the astonished crowd, and then as other employees rush to their cars, likely heading for safety, Kate and Nanna do the same.  Tony watches Kate’s bug pull out of the parking lot with no trouble, then the drone-cam feed switches to the black escalades headed in the direction of the blast.
Tony nods.  He’s concentrating hard enough that Steve expects it’ll be a quiet hour or two, which is why it’s all the more surprising when Tony sits the nest down and turns to look at Steve.
“Yes,” Tony says. “I met Steve Rogers last night and we kind of hit it off. He came over and we skated for a bit. Nothing happened. It was just... nice. He and Barnes are roommates.”
“You mentioned Steve,” Bruce says, bringing up the topic that had started this whole bizarre encounter. “Is there something about him you wanted to know?”
Despite having sworn off drinking for the rest of his life after the previous weekend’s hangover, Tony finds himself back at Lido’s for beer and fries on Friday night.  They’re celebrating.  Hammer and Stane are behind bars, and if the US Government and the SI Attorneys have anything to say about it it, they’ll be there for a long time.
“Yeah, I think you might be right,” Steve says.  “I’ll have to add Green Smoothies to my list of things to avoid.”
Tony reaches out for Steve’s hand and when Steve takes his, he pulls him down next to him on the couch.
“That’s a good sign. It probably means your healing factor is kicking in. Do you think if you closed your eyes you could get some rest?”
“I know it’s not as soft as mine yet, but sleep under it every night, and play on it every day and remember I made it with all my love.  Just for you.”
Tony’s hyperventilating between words and Steve walks around the bed and sits down next to him.  Tony has the blanket half covering his head and he’s folded himself into a tight ball.  It’s no wonder he wants privacy since it’s such an intimately helpless scene.
“Not bad, Stark,” Natasha says, already strapping weapons to herself.  From the way she’s looking at them, Steve’s pretty sure the paintball stingers are her favorite.  “Now I see why we left Bruce at home.”
It scares Bruce that James didn’t run. It scares him because if he’s somehow put a psychological leash on the guy, it’s going to be a nightmare getting James the help he needs. And that doesn’t even start on the heaps of guilt Bruce will feel. Is already feeling.
There’s a small, silver square about the size of a cell phone sitting out and next to it is a baton, about 12 inches long.  The last piece is a satellite component that will link it all to JARVIS.  Bruce has seen similar before.
Steve and Tony have smoothies for breakfast.  They don’t speak more than a few words to each other as Tony packs.  When it’s time to go, they take a hidden elevator down to Tony’s private garage.  There are two dozen gorgeous cars waiting, in every color of the rainbow.
“If you want me there, I’ll be there,” Steve says. “And with your permission everything I own will be there too. Every ugly armchair. Every thrifted quilt. All my old records. You sure you want that?”
.   I will totally follow you back and then point shiny things toward you and yell LOOK AT THIS SHINY THING.  LOOK AT HOW SHINY AND PRECIOUS IT IS.
“That makes perfect sense,” Bruce says. “That must have been incredibly grating. And now, to get back to your question-- what I would do about you killing people is entirely dependant on who you’re killing. Which probably makes me a shitty person, but I don’t have the energy to go around defending assholes like Hydra, I just don’t.”
Jarvis is silent.  Steve hopes it’s not permanent.  That whatever Tony did that made Jarvis leave can be undone and Javis can come back and breathe life into the tower again.  Steve misses his steadying presence.
“I didn’t communicate that well,” Bruce says in the gentlest voice he can manage. “That was my bad. I’m not angry with you. If anything, I’m annoyed with myself for not being more careful.”
“Son,” Steve says, in a voice barely more than a growl.  “You’re about three seconds from the ass-kicking of a lifetime.  Drop the keys and go.”
“Bruce— give me one second,” Steve says into the phone, even if he’s not sure where to go that’s going to give him any more privacy.  All the store fronts looks the same.  Shops.  Restaurants.  Busy.
Steve feels a wave of relief.  Bucky hasn’t run off again.  And he hasn’t killed either Bruce or Clint, so that’s good news.
If anyone else said that, Bruce would be irritated. It negates his experience. It wipes out the bad that he ought to be held accountable for. It absolves him of crimes Bruce plans to mourn to the grave. But he doesn’t get irritated with James. James is new to friendship and he is trying.
He watches as Sam and Nat file inside and Clint wobbles to his feet to wait for Bruce and James as Bruce guides them toward the porch.
Natasha taps on the table before it gets any further.  “It’s not a trap, Sam.  That’s not Stark.  And the suggestion’s moot anyway, because Steve is right.  It won’t work.  Barnes is running on survival instincts. He’s not going to stroll up to the tower and hope for the best.”
. “You’ve been tugging on it for the last ten minutes and I’m sure we could get you something that fits better if there’s a problem.  You don’t have to suffer in silence.”
For a split second Tony’s mouth drops open aghast and then he retaliates for the snark by tossing one of the throw pillows at Steve.
Bruce takes a second to compose himself.  It’s not every day you get to break Captain Americas heart. Bruce can’t let that matter. James is his concern now. He can deal with his own weird friendship issues later. For now it’s Elsa time: Conceal. Don’t feel.
Steve carefully takes the egg out of the pocket of his jacket, where it has been nestled in a handkerchief all day.  He holds it upside down and they can all see Pepper’s signature.  It’s legit.
“I hadn’t left until this morning,” Steve admits.  “I’ve been using the gym instead of running outside.  Figured some fresh air might do me good.”
“It was the art panel,” Tony says, a little uneasily.  “The background-- was the portal.  The wormhole.  It sets me off.  I- I had panic attacks when I was a kid.  Hadn’t had one for years.  Then after the battle they started again.”
Sam grabs the phone out of Tony’s hand and flips it over and does exactly what Natasha asked, in one swift movement.
Tony replays Steve’s words a couple of times in his head to sort out whether Steve’s insulting him.  He decides it sound more like Cap is berating himself.
“That’s not a code,” Tony says.  “It was in the security files she dumped on the net.  Bogotá, Columbia.  It’s where Hawkeye found her when he convinced her to let him bring her in.  Broke every policy and procedure in the handbook to do it.”
“There were a lot of kidnapping concerns, too,” Pepper adds.  “Until Tony left for college they kept him isolated.  It wasn’t an ideal situation.”
Steve can see immediately why the press would run wild with the photos.  In the first, Tony’s got his arm around an attractive man in his mid-twenties and they’re rushing out of a ritzy hotel Steve doesn’t recognize.  In the second,  Tony’s ushering the same man into a car, protecting him from the photographers by allowing him to use his suit jacket for cover.  The third is a blurry shot of them inside the limo as the door is closing.  It looks a lot like they’re in an embrace of some sort, but Steve has zero doubts about Tony’s fidelity in any of these pictures.
“Have a good night, Captain America.”  Tony says it in a voice that would be a lot more fitting for saying something like ‘drop dead, asshole.’
“Ohhhh.  Bigfoot.  Yeah, look,” Clint says, picking his phone up off his desk and taps it a few times to pull up a picture of the back of Bruce walking into his office.
“Okay then,” Steve says.  “There we go.  I know as much as anyone, probably, and I’m still here.  I’m not going anywhere.  I am deeply, ridiculously, happily in love with you.  All this... baggage.  We both have it.  It doesn’t change a thing.”
Bruce doesn’t ask Steve what he’s trying to fix.  Bruce treats people like adults and he doesn't pressure.  Steve suspects that’s why the doctor ended up the de facto counselor for the team, as well as Steve’s personal tour guide to the greater culinary world.
“It’s my treat tonight, boys,” she says. “ You’ll have to wait until next week to have your pissing contest over who pays.”
Bruce runs his shower warm, and then stands with his face turned up to the stream and stays there until he has to shift away to catch his breath, and then he grabs the soap. It’s the first proper shower he’s had in a month and a half. He’s so filthy that the swirls of dirt that wash down the drain leaves trails that look like modern art.  Bruce can make out a storm cloud.  An ugly monkey.  A wheat field in Kansas.
Steve moves closer and slides his ankle over Tony’s calves. Steve looks like he’s going to say more but the car rolls to a stop and he goes quiet.
“That-- that makes me think you and I need to have a separate talk about where babies comes from,” Bruce says. “But that’s the concept, yeah. What do you think, James? Does that feel valid to you at all? Because I could be full of shit. That’s fine, too.”
Tony jumps when a hand settles on his back.  He doesn’t pull away.  Physical comfort is Tony’s weakness, and it’s a rare gift.  Something he can’t buy for himself.  He wants to enjoy it for a minute before he has to give it up.
When Natasha returns, it’s to shrug into her jacket and say goodnight.  Sam leaves with her, and Clint and Bucky stumble out after them.
“Want to put on pajamas?  I’ll take a quick shower and do the same.  We can lay down and nap.  I’ve missed you.”
They have to press close as they make their way toward the door between all the people crowded into the small dining area. Tony’s whole body feels warm from the physical contact with Steve and that is
“When I first met him, he had bought himself more friends than he knew what to do with,” Rhodey supplied.  “If you can imagine what sort of low-lifes hang out with a fourteen year old for unlimited liquor and weed, you’ll get the picture.”
The next few minutes are a total blur.  The lobby is chaos and Tony’s relieved when Steve wraps his arm around him and ushers him outside.  Reporters are taking a thousand pictures, but their cameras aren’t all aimed at Tony.  They’re capturing the spectacle of Hammer and Stane as they’re handcuffed and read their Miranda rights.
Steve trails off and Tony closes his eyes as he reaches down to let his own hand rest against the hand on his stomach.
“Don’t even think about it,” Bucky adds, biting down on the corner of his bottom lip. “It’s the least we can do for you making an honest man out of our Stevie.”
“Bullshit,” Bucky laughs, shoving the man playfully hard in the side.  The guy is so built it doesn’t even budge him.  “Steve here’s too good at photoshop,” Bucky continues.  “We’d be looking at pictures of him on the moon, wishing we weren’t all down by 5,000 points.  His cheatin’ ass is judge by default.”
Steve hears a scuffle, like someone’s being pushed, and the sound of car keys, and then a thud, like a punch.  Steve tries the door.  It’s locked.  He shoves his shoulder into the wood and it opens into the room with a sharp crack.
He hates that this is his life now. Can’t even crash at a friend’s house for fear of damaging their reputation.
Steve looks torn, even as they open the doors of the van.  “There’s not enough cover on the roads,” he says decisively.  “And the van is an obvious target. We’re going to need to move into the woods on foot.  Lose them there.  Then we can call Nat for a pick up.”
Bruce follows after him and cooks lunch for himself and Clint.  They eat while James munches on some StarkBars, and then Bruce takes a nap that lasts most of the afternoon.  He wakes up to the sounds of James and Clint debating the merits of different types of weapons. Loudly. From what Bruce can make out, James is about as impressed by a bow and arrow as he'd be by a toy nerf gun.  Clint agrees.
“James?” Bruce asks softly, as he stands. “You’re safe. There was a malfunction and things got kind of wild, but that’s mostly sorted now. We’re back in the states-- somewhere Clint is sure is safe. I trust him, so I thought you might too.”
(I keep waiting for my poetry to get better and it just doesn't.  I hope you liked this chapter, though!  It's such a big turning point and for me, that's exciting!)
It’s at one of these charity functions that Steve first meets Tony’s most recent fella.  Steve’s been warned (yes, warned, because everyone expects that Steve will freak out) that Stark is bisexual.  Steve considers pointing out to Hill that this generation didn’t invent bisexuality, or sex, for that matter but she’s trying to be helpful so he plays along.  She looks relieved when he  promises not to choke on his straw if he sees his teammate bringing around a man on his arm.
“Half of them looked like they’d been crying,” Steve laughs, sitting down on the edge of the table. “You didn’t have all their pets kidnapped did you?”
“Don’t you need to finish his arm?” Steve asks, mostly because his brain is taking an awful long time to catch up.
“All I need is time to explain,” Bruce says. “It’s got to be up to him what kind of help he’s willing to receive.”
“This mattress is fine,” Steve assures him.  “Better than fine, because it’s got you on it.  Can I kiss you?”
They all dig around in their pockets then shove small pieces of molded foam into their ears.  Tony can still hear a little, but now his ears won’t be ringing when the festivities are over.
“Oh god-- you’re my new favorite," Sam says.  "I’m sitting here like ‘Steve who?’ right now.  You can get them fixed?  By tomorrow?”
“When you were captured and...” Bruce fumbles for a word. “And programmed, they could have altered your brain. They could have done something that caused a malfunction that-- that robbed you of your ability to be you. And seeing Steve could have been a trigger that shifted part of your natural state back into place. So in that scenario, what’s going on-- it might not be a new malfunction so much as a
“I don’t know how any of you kept yourselves alive long enough to do any good,” James complains. “I broke Clint-- then the first thing you do is hand me a knife. What if somethin’ else goes wrong?”
“Cartoons,” James agrees. He says it quickly enough that it might be the most emphatic decision he’s made yet.
A minute into the drive, Tony reaches over and changes the music.  It’s no longer the radio but it’s nothing obnoxious.  Jarvis, maybe, choosing songs he thinks they can both tolerate.  Tony’s quiet for nearly an hour.
“He isn’t what I expected,” Steve starts.  “He’s Bucky-- but he’s not. He cares but he doesn’t. He told me I need to see a shrink.”
“I went to see an art history professor today,” Steve begins.  “About a charity thing. We got to talking about the Avengers and he mentioned you were a student of his once. Said you’d written one of the best papers he’d ever read.  It was so good, the guy had kept it all these years.  Is any of this ringing a bell?”
“So fourteen-year-old-you didn’t hate me, at least,” Steve says, without realizing for a moment that he’s said it out loud.
Bruce is numb with horror. If he’d just pushed James to let him scan his chest instead of letting him blow off any more than his leg... if he’d--
Tony’s eyes go to the bed.  There are things that need done on this bed.  Urgent things.  They can be quiet about it.  That’ll be part of the fun.   If Tony never leaves the room no one can kill him and he can stay in here forever.  With Steve.  And the shirt.  And this twin-size bed that’s probably barely big enough for one person, much less two.  Tony gives zero fucks.
“Not a big fan of that myself,” Tony agrees. “But it’s just the watching you don’t want to do, right? Any problem with playing?”
Howard. The two of them got along like a house on fire. The snark never stopped. And we never met your mom. I don’t-- don’t have any answers. I wish I did.”
Tony debates the merits of sitting on Bruce's desk and waiting, but the office has interior windows and employees are glancing in, and fuck it, seriously.  He steps out the door and lets his eyes sweep over the large, cubicle-filled room.  There are less than a dozen people at their desks.
“I understand why you might put me on a pedestal,” Steve says.  “Even if I don’t think I deserve to be there.  But Tony-- please believe me--”  He pauses and waits until Tony meets his eyes.  “I don’t feel like I’m settling.  I don’t feel like I could do better.  We’ve both got issues.  We’re both doing the best we can.  I see you as my equal, always, in everything.  I swear I do.”
Tony isn’t talkative at first.   But when Steve asks him about the new strap for his shield, it’s the distraction they need.  Tony talks for almost 45 minutes straight about what he’s done to fix the strap, all the ways the new strap is superior to the old one, and the advances he’s made in material science over the course of half a week that might jump the entire industry ten years forward.  Tony's engaged and excited.  It’s fascinating.
“I’m serious, Steve,” Tony says.  “So far the press has been good to you.  You don't want them to turn.”
Steve’s going to be by any minute. Tony’s been primping for an hour. He wouldn’t call it primping out loud, but his thoughts are less charitable. They tell it like it is.
empty, but it’s empty right now.  And all the things Tony’s wanted to do in that house-- in that room-  in that ridiculously squeaky twin bed-- are all there for the taking.
It’s been one month since Steve dropped Tony off upstate. When he pulls into the parking lot of the rehab mansion, Pepper is walking down the steps. Steve parks next to Pepper’s town car wear Happy is waiting. Pepper smiles and waves when she spots Steve.
Tony doesn’t say much.  It’s Steve’s turn to rant, and wow-- when he gets going does that Brooklyn accent come out strong.  Tony did not know this was a kink of his but it is absolutely, most definitely a kink.  At least judging from the very vivid mental image Tony’s got of Steve using that same accent in bed.  It’s so incredibly inappropriate to even think about kinks when he’s supposed to be making a stab at being a supportive friend that Tony digs his fingernails into his palm.
“I told Steve I’d keep us all safe up here,” Natasha says firmly. “I’m not going to go back on my word.”
“There’s still a malfunction at the knee... it’s not right...” James trails off and lets out an exasperated huff of air that Bruce has grown to realize is his ‘I’m having trouble making words work for me’ signal.
“See if you can help him stay like this, but don’t restrain him,” Bruce directs as Clint joins him. “And don’t put anything in his mouth.”
“We don’t trust them,” Bucky says. “Stane had a hand in hiring at least half of who’s left. We know Rumlow and Johnson are both on the distribution list for this thing. They’re bad news.”
“There’s no... pain,” James says. There’s tension in his voice as he works out words for what he means. “Usually when I wake up it’s all wrong. There’s... static, maybe. Like steel wool brushing over raw stuff. It’s how I knew where I started and ended. But it’s all gone.” James’s flexes his fingers. “Will I stay like this? Without the static?”
“Tony put some kind of off-the-grid internet on here for me, so you don’t need to worry about being tracked. Look up some haircuts and pick something you like. You know how to Google?”
Nanna looks at Tony with so much warmth, it makes Tony feel a little itchy inside.  He’s never really had the grandparent thing.  This is something he could get used to, though.
“Let us move you somewhere safe. If we can’t sort this shit out on own we know some heavy hitters who can.”
Clint doesn’t act like that’s a strange request at all and puts the paper next to Tony who picks it up greedily and scans it over more closely.
He loses track of time, and he only comes back to reality when a foot gently nudges his.  It causes Tony to startle, bang his head on the metal above him, and then flop back to the ground with a groan.
Bruce sits on the grass a few feet away and waits. Clint takes a seat on a battered, old porch swing and watches Natasha and Sam unload the jet’s entire medical bay into the house. Clearly this is a place Nat has been before, because every time she passes Clint they share a few quiet sentences about what room is best to set up as a medical clinic and where they think everyone else should sleep.
For more than a minute the soldier says nothing. Bruce takes that time to catalogue the soldier’s injuries. When the man lets another minute pass without an answer Bruce speaks again.
“Nanna knows where it is,” Bucky says.  “I need you to sit your ass down and work on these traffic camera manips.  If they haven’t gotten to the security cameras yet, this will slow them down, and if I try to do it myself they’re gonna look like shit.”
“If you’ve got a problem with me having a boyfriend, you need to get the stick out of your ass, Capsicle,” Tony announces.  “This is the twenty-first century.  Deal with it.”
“I’m calling because I’m hoping you can shed a little light on what it’s like for you to heal after a significant injury,” Bruce says. “Is that something you’re comfortable discussing?”
Mae’s face softens.  “Oh, Lord.”  She leaves the cloth where it is and comes over to sit next to him.  “You designed the milkshakes.  They’re yours to name.
She hops lightly off of Sam’s lap before anyone can object.  Not that Tony would.  There’s something in her tone that’s says she's going to get her way.
“I'm always kind,” Natasha says.  She reaches up to ruffle Steve’s hair as she passes him, then swats at Clint.  “Now get your asses in gear.  Last ones back to base are gonna end up stuck with the paperwork and I know a shortcut.”
Tony glances around the table and then looks back at Steve.  “I really am,” he agrees.  “So what does everyone else do?”
“Intuition,” Clint says. “Years of watching targets for weakness. I can’t pinpoint it, though. I thought maybe Bruce could.”
It’s only after the words are out of his mouth and Tony’s eyes narrow, that Steve realizes he’s gotten something wrong.
Tonight, Bruce has come over to cook something spicy and colorful in Steve’s small kitchen.  Usually on these nights, Bruce brings books, too, about the places he’s been and the things he’s seen. (Bruce has no personal photographs of these places, since he hadn’t been running around with a camera.)  (Plus, you know, Hulk smash.) They look through the pictures in the books together, and Bruce weaves them all into an incredible narrative.
His teammates pile on top of him, into a writhing mass of gloves and skates and asses. There’s laughter and cheers and everything’s a blur all the way up through 2 in the morning. He reeks of champagne and every piece of him is sticky and gross and when he collapses into the chair next to Bucky’s hospital bed, he’s exhausted and just wants to sleep.
“JARVIS, queue up Encounter at Farpoint,” Tony says instead, before turning to face Steve with a serious expression.  “I will give you that Dog Cops is not for everyone, but if you don’t like Star Trek, all hope is lost.”
Steve laughs at Tony’s surprised expression. “I do. We could afford nice places of own just fine, but we both like the company. He grew up in a big family in a noisy house, so he’s used to a crowd. I grew up alone and always wished there was someone around. I dunno. It just works for us.”
There’s a fancy looking blanket resting on a chair nearby but it looks like it was woven out of some kind of endangered animal and when Steve picks it up, it’s more prickly than soft.
Natasha comes back to New York a few days later. She and Clint meet Steve at their diner, and that’s where he tells them about an idea he had on the drive back from rehab.
“I can’t do this in a field,” Bruce says numbly. “Call Tony-- I need-- I need JARVIS. And we’re going to need a lift. He'll need an operating room.”
Real life has been kind of a pain lately so if you'd like to keep up with updates, see my random drabbles or ask me questions, you can find me at
Tony lets out a groan.  “Ughhhhhyessss I know.  Can you not talk about us breaking up right now?  It’s all I’ve thought about for three days.  How that’s exactly what I’d deserve.  Karma for lying to Pepper.”
“That’s good of you,” Tony says. “Though next time, maybe stop me after ten. I haven’t felt this rough in a long time.”
“It’s the best salad in the city,” Tony protests, as they walk down the street together, almost close enough to touch.  “And I’m over in this part of town next to never.  Just try the salad, Steve.  If it doesn’t knock your panties off, we can grab a second lunch.  You eat like a hobbit anyway.”
“We’re not fucked,” Steve says, putting his hand on Tony’s arm to try and anchor him.  “Maybe this issue is just gonna take some time.”
“Correction. I’ve been sober for… 6 days,” Tony says. “It was a year before that. And I’m not going.”
“I’m a Digital Forensics Analyst.  If SI security needs images checked for accuracy, photoshopping, or forgery, they send them my way and I figure it out.  Your lawyers end up sending me stuff, too,” Steve admits.  “Not always in an official capacity.”
Steve trails off.  He feels sick when he thinks about the exact description the man had given. Apparently Tony’s claustrophobic when anything is put over his head and this man had done just that.  Used a bag once he had Tony tied up.  Ignored his pleas to stop, and felt perfectly justified in doing so since right at the start Tony’d given him permission to do what he wanted.  Whatever he wanted. No limits.
The Hammer security team rushes toward them and Bucky, Clint, Nat and Sam for a semi-circle that only an idiot would attempt to cross.  The guards draw their guns, surrounding them.
They do eventually move to a bedroom. And when hunger drives them to order pizza, Tony gets all the way to the front door to pay for it, and all the way back to the kitchen, before they’re touching again. This time it’s Tony playfully bumping Steve as he walks past him.
Steve starts the car, turns on the radio to a classical music station, because those are the only stations that don’t ever seem to cut in with gossip, and they’re on their way.
“Sir is in his suite,” JARVIS says.  And yeah, it’s a British Robot Voice, but Steve feels like he senses worry there.
Steve looks up in surprise. Like he’s been caught sneaking into a movie without paying or cutting through a lawn with a KEEP OFF sign guarding the grass.
“You mean a real therapist would have told James to stay away from scissors and left him with about as much dignity as a kindergartner who can’t wipe their own ass. That’s not going to fix him.”
“Great talk, doc,” Tony says, giving Bruce a false smile. “Talk to me after we’ve won the Cup and I’ll think about it. For now I’ve got to go.”
They take Tony’s crazy expensive car to his crazy expensive house that has a state of the art ice rink and even a zamboni. A
Bruce has no idea how much time passes. He knows he’s thirsty and exhausted. He knows his calves ache and his shoulders are sore and that his hands have been cramping for the last however long. He knows that the back of his shirt is damp from sweat and the front is soaked in blood.  Sam stopped talking any more than necessary maybe half an hour ago.
“I have no doubt that you could outwalk me by a couple dozen miles,” Bruce says.  “But if you could do it without pain, that would be my preference.  I care about your comfort in the same way I would care about Clint’s comfort.”
“Awwww, Cap.  You should have called me,” Tony says.  “JARVIS can track down anything, can’t you J?”
He wonders if Tony can hear the rub there.  If he can hear Steve’s lonely bitter frustration that he can’t help Bucky in even the smallest of ways.  Or his jealousy that Tony’s best pal texts him morning, noon and night while Steve combs through paragraphs about arm stumps and bone grafts and blood.
“I didn’t follow you to Austria on purpose,” Clint says. “The day SHIELD fell, I had just gotten off a plane in New York from four weeks off grid. I was still in the airport when I got a text from Natasha. It was one word-- our go word-- and nothing else. I got on the first plane out, and ended up in London. I had some options from there, and-- you know how we watched that singing nun movie at Christmas? Climb every mountain and goats and stuff? I looked up where the movie was filmed and ended up in Salzburg.”
“I wanted to eat a family dinner,” Tony says.  “We never did.  I ate with Jarvis in the kitchen most of the time and if he was busy, I ate alone.  Mom and Dad had a giant table in the dining room and we never used it.  I thought... when I chose the painting... I thought the people looked lucky.  They didn’t look happy.  They were poor.  They were probably sick as fuck of potatoes.  But they had something I didn’t.  They had family.  Maybe they were miserable but they were miserable together.  I guess... that just got my attention.”
Bruce nods. He understands that Clint is speaking from a place of raw honesty, and also that his words are slurred because he’s either nearly in shock or at some point he took some seriously-strong pain killers.
Tony braces himself for awkwardness, but now that they’re all in one spot facing each other, conversation comes easy.
Tony walks further into the living room and pulls out his phone.  He taps on it a few times shakily and the lights brighten.  Jarvis’s voice fills the apartment.
Steve can see from the handwritten BRUCE on the front, that it’s from Tony. It looks like it was opened without care.
“Girly mags?” Steve asks in a whisper, shoving the magazines quickly back into the plastic bag Clint had handed him. They’re sitting in the middle of the SHIELD cafeteria where anyone can see.
“I agree,” Tony says.  “You’d have deserved way better.  But you’re stuck with what you’ve got.  Now come on.  Let’s see what Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum are up to.  It makes me nervous when they get quiet.”
The yard is fenced in so the shed’s a cinch to find.  Steve’s sitting at a laptop, with a huge printing press whirring quietly beside him.  There’s a 3D printer, too, a plastics printer and what Tony’s pretty damn sure is a goddamn (highly illegal) money press.
“You’re going to leave it?” Steve asks. “I thought... I mean I figured you wouldn’t. You don’t have to.”
It’s impossible not to notice the way Steve watches him after that.  Like Tony’s doing something a lot more impressive than cleaning up.  (+10 secret Tony points)
Tony feels a pang at that. He wants to offer to pay because that’s just what he does when he feels like the people around him don’t have money for things, but Bucky looks right at him and gives him that disarmingly flirtatious smile he uses when he’s serious business about getting his way.
Steve doesn’t respond.  He just reaches into the box, hooks several mugs with his thumb and then flings them at the nearest wall.  Damn if that doesn’t make him feel just the slightest bit better.
Tony laughs at that one. Jenny’s mom is a gem. She and Rhodey had been little more than a one-night stand yet she’d made sure Rhodey could be as much a part of Jenny’s life as he could make work with the military. And probably more surprising, she’s always been supportive of Tony’s relationship with Jenny as well. Considers him an important part of Jenny’s life and texts Tony pictures every time Jenny wins a tournament or gets player of the game or enters a science fair.
Clint interrupts by reaching over the table to drop a slab of fries to Tony’s plate, and then Steve’s.
He wets his lips, before his gaze steels. "That might offend some of you, but if you think who a person loves diminishes their service, you do not support the ideals that we swear to uphold. I am who I am. And I’m happy, finally. Happy being with the person I love and being able to show him how much I love him."
“Sorry-- sorry,” Clint apologizes. “I should not be laughing at someone with your estimated kill count. It’s just you sound like pretty much every other person ever who’s been out on a mission with Steve.”
“For an obscene amount of cash,” Clint says. “On a service that only goes out to people with a reputation for getting shit done.”
“Then why?” Clint asks.  “You don’t want his money and he’s a complete tool whenever you’re around.  What would you get out of it?”
Tony doesn’t have a quick reply for that one. Instead he just looks sort of stumped. He lowers his eyes to look back at the menu, and Mae leans down so he’ll have to pay attention to her.
Bucky is waiting for them in a dark, beat up Impala, parked carefully out of the line of sight of any cameras. The smell of tacos hits Tony as soon as he reaches for the rear passenger door.
He makes a good living. He earns his money doing the thing he loves. What Tony has is well beyond that.
He takes a drink and tries to surreptitiously get a better look at James. He doesn’t notice any immediate signs of distress or illness. His coloring is fine; his pulse seems unaffected by the climb. His ribs aren’t retracting when he breathes, which Bruce can see since he’s wearing an over-sized Stark Industries hooded jacket, that’s been left unzipped.
Tony can see everything he needs to know written into the way Steve’s trying to hide the sadness in his eyes.
Steve pauses.  Looks over at Tony, and the smile Steve gives him is small and real.  “Yeah.  Think I do.  Thanks.  That was probably a lot to listen to.”
“M’in New York,” Tony says.  His voice is rough, either from shouting or vomiting or disuse.  It’s impossible to tell.
“But rather than scorch the Earth, Tony chose to build.  Not just the Iron Man suit, but a future where he and his company could do more for the world than create death and destruction.  I am tired of people ignoring the good Tony does.  He’s thrown himself into clean energy and sustainability, into medical technology and development, into every facet of innovation and he daily pushes the boundaries of what humankind can achieve.  He puts on his Iron--” Steve pauses, looks at Tony and gives him a slight nod-- “sorry, a Gold-Titanium Alloy--,” he corrects, before turning back to his audience “suit, and he makes the sacrifice play.  He is a loyal member of our team and we trust him with our lives.”
“Then here.  Let’s get you 110 points,” Tony says, reaching for a post-it note.  He writes KICK ME and then hands it to Clint.  “Tag me.”
“It’s like some sick sort of penance,”  Rhodey says.  “It got worse after Afghanistan.  The more people he saves it’s like the more he’s got to punish himself.”
Tony tries again, patiently. “I feel like you should acknowledge that I haven’t been the most likable guy in the world lately. It would be good for you.”
“Great,” Tony complains. “Now on top of everything I’m gonna have the SpongeBob song stuck in my head all damn day.”
It’s an effort to get James on the stretcher, but once he’s on, it isn’t difficult to lift. Tony’d built some sort of thrusters under it, because of course he did. The stretcher’s also got heart monitors and a pulse oximeter and Bruce keeps one hand on the gauze while he begins to attach what he can with the other. Sam works on securing James, so he won’t roll off, as they quickly guide the floating stretcher to the Quinjet.
dance, because Clint strips naked without a care in the world and then stands directly in the middle of the spray, hands on his hips, junk jutted forward, just to be a dick.
Tony and Steve bond over the future while Bruce, Clint and James try really hard not to set anyone off.  Which for Clint involves running around in a towel for ~reasons~.
“Sorry. You’ve got a little...” Tony makes a wavy gesture in front of Steve’s face, and Steve remembers the goop on Tony’s forehead. Which is now on his own.
Tony pulls back and Steve lets go.  Tony’s warmth lingers on Steve’s hands and forearms.  They meet eyes and Steve gives him a nod of promise.
There’s a breathiness to his voice and Tony all but runs from the room.  Steve looks up at the ceiling, silently wondering if JARVIS has any input but he’s met with silence.  Steve turns his eyes back to the television, puzzling out what sent Tony running.  The picture is equal in skill to Natasha’s.  Iron Man is front and center, done in gold and red, with his name below.  He’s painted against an ornate circle of clouds that ring a black and silver night sky.  It’s gorgeous from an artist’s point of view.
One second stretches into something out of time. It’s just the two of them. The crowd, their teammates, the whole world fades away.
Steve nods. “I should get going anyway. I left some dishes in the sink and if Bucky gets back before I stick them in the washer I’ll never hear the end of it.”
Bruce misses Tony. It’s a strange, unfamiliar feeling, to be drawn to something or someone. It seeps around the ever present anger in his mind, and numbs it. It drowns out the images of a helicarrier aiming a gun at him while he’s sitting quietly in an NYU library. He sleeps easier. He smiles more often, even if it’s only to himself. Tony keeps him entertained from 4,000 miles away, mostly with jokes, emoji-abuse, threats of dick pics, and occasional news of SHIELD and Steve and Natasha and what all went down in the end.
“It will be a few weeks before they’ll let me have visitors,” Tony says quietly.  His voice is muffled into Steve’s shoulder.  “Jarvis will know the rules.  If you still want to see me.”
“I think you’ve heard the rest,” Tony says.  “I can’t-- can’t really think of anything I’d consider big.”
hurt him.  Tony just hates this kind of confrontation.  Usually it means an end to a friendship.  Tony’s been through lots of endings.  But usually he sees them coming.
It turns out, the tough love approach isn’t a bad thing.  Some of what they talk about is difficult to hear, and some of it is downright painful, but as the weeks go on they’re better off for it.
Tony knows it’s meant for him and he gives the slightest dip of his chin.  Yeah, he’s okay.   A minute ago, not so much.  A minute ago he’d been desperately fighting off the first twinges of a panic attack.  The Senate mandated inquisition had turned into a Let’s Blame Stark party, and Tony was
“In a healthy relationship, both partners experience an equal sense of worth, value and contribution.  How does this look in our relationship?”
Tony has never known a time when he’d worried about the cost of fries, but he nods.  At least Bruce is looking equally clueless.  Clint moves to catch back up with Bucky and it leaves Bruce and Tony to bring up the rear.
“Gimme,” Tony says.  Though when Clint extends it, Tony draws back slightly.  “Mind putting it on the desk?  I don’t like being handed things.”
“I want to make a video,” Steve announces from where he sits on the floor of the garage, watching Tony’s legs dangle out from beneath one of his cars.
“Was worried I’d come back to you moping,” Bucky says, once he turns. “Eating ice cream on the couch at noon in your boxers.”
Natasha taps on a panel and a moment later the front window of the Quinjet lights up with a view of Tony’s workshop. Steve’s sitting on the sofa with his head in his hands, and Tony’s at his workstation with enough holograms stacked over each other that you can’t see through the display layers. Tony doesn’t turn or acknowledge the call. From the set of his shoulders Bruce can tell his friend is in the Science Zone, and isn’t going to allow himself to be disturbed.
“Or we could get back in the bed now,” Tony points out.  “I’m sure Bucky and Clint can handle my security on their own.  That door’s got a lock doesn’t it?”
Rhodey’s gracious enough not to mention the increased criminal activity is directly related to a distinct lack of Iron Man. Steve also knows that Rhodey’s spent the last six months flying around the globe nearly non-stop so the government pressure on Tony stays to a minimum.
When the doorbell rings, Tony has to force himself not to jog for it. He walks, like someone who hasn’t been picturing this moment for the last 24 hours, and opens it casually.
The Colonel scribbles down the name of a restaurant on the edge of a napkin and hands it to Steve.  When Steve arrives at 7 sharp, Rhodes isn’t alone.  Pepper is sitting with him.
Steve trails off. Tony’s got tears at the edges of his eyes and Steve’s not sure if they’re good tears or bad tears. If he got this wrong.
True to their word, Clint and Natasha never mind when Steve brings Tony around. They have a regular booth in the diner now. Steve and Tony take one side, while Bruce, Clint and Natasha smush into the other.
“You can get through this,” Steve says.  “I know you can.  We’re going to try and breathe together, okay?  In-two-three-four, out-two-three-four.  In-two-three-four, out-two-three-four.”
When the rest of the gang shows up, Tony leaves his hiding spot and joins them.  Bucky and Sam try a little jello for themselves.  Steve laughs at their cherry red lips, and he chats with Tony about things that are fun and normal and good.  They can definitely do this friendship thing.  Steve seems absolutely determined not to make another flirtatious move.
The last words are muffled, and Tony’s not having that. Steve doesn’t fight when Tony straddles his waist and yanks the pillow away. Tony’s beaming down at him and Steve groans.
Steve’s mouth falls open. He’s holding a wrench that Tony had handed him a few minutes before and Steve waves it emphatically. “No. No, not a sex tape.
Steve isn’t sure if this is the kind of thing Tony wants to hear, but it’s the truth and some of these things just need said.
“There’s no such thing as ‘like a man’,” Steve soothes.  “That’s the kind of thing I heard when I was a kid.  The world knows better now.  Besides, you want Widow to hear you say something like that?”
“Dude, you’re smiling again,” Rhodey teases, as he comes to sit by Tony. “What’s up with that? You only smile like this when you’re--” Rhodey drops his voice “getting laid. And I thought we talked about you working on
“My boyfriend is really good at paper basketball,” Steve consoles, threading their fingers together and then pulling Tony’s hand up to his mouth so he can kiss his knuckles.
“Considering Bruce knows what a bad idea it might be to have you and James in a room together, it must be a pretty big deal if he’s willing to ask you to do that,” Steve comments.
“I’m sorry. I’m sorry,” Tony gasps between laughs. “It’s just... you’re totally aiming to be the Hawkeye of sex.”
“What was that?” Tony asks, making eye contact with Steve for the first time since the table.  His voice is off-key to his own ears.  It was meant to sound light-hearted but instead it reveals so much of what he wants to hide.  The confusion.  The unworthiness.
“I pick Jenny,” Bucky says. “Unless you want to play on your Uncle Tony’s team? Wouldn’t blame you, kid.”
“Because I’m the one with the most to lose, here. I’m the monster watching my best science friend make a new science friend. But you’re the one making that face.”
Kate picks up a ranch-covered fry and flings it at Clint, nailing him squarely in the middle of the bullseye on his shirt.  It’s an impressive shot.
Steve smiles in relief.  “We’re going to need a few places to go out to eat that don’t serve alcohol.  Places where we can be treated like we’re normal.  The diner has always been a safe space for me.  I don’t have a lot of those anymore.  And I just don’t want Tony to feel like he’s lost anything more than he already has.  Which is a lot.  He knows how bad he messed up.”
He flops down on the couch and Steve follows, taking a seat on the other end.  Tony drapes a blanket over himself and it’s endearing to see that it’s not an expensive blanket or a fancy one.  This blanket is well loved.
It’s not really a matter of trust. Tony trusts them as much as he trusts anyone these days. It’s just... and he’s not going to say this part out loud... they’re desk staff. He’s not sure what a trio of translators, a Photoshop expert and two security strategists think they’re going to do other than hide him, and Tony has a few safe houses that are off the books. He can do that for himself.
James nods then looks Steve over like he’s checking him for weapons and security threats. Steve doesn’t acknowledge the stare. The tension is enough that Bruce feels the Other Guy begin to stir. Thankfully James speaks a moment later and it breaks the uncomfortable silence.
Bruce glances toward the front, and Clint and Nat are in the pilot’s seats.  It’s good to see Clint up and moving, even if he’s sweaty and pale.
Bruce hears James sigh and then huff and Bruce digs his fingers into his palm to keep from rescuing him. James will find the words. And it’s obvious to Bruce those words aren’t going to be about the weather.
Back at the barn, Bruce had shown the texted address to James and figured they’d use a map to find their way, which would have at least given Bruce somewhere else to focus.  They don’t need a map, though. James may be hobbled but he’s walking with purpose. He absolutely knows the way.
Now it’s Steve’s turn to be surprised. Sure, Bucky has more fans than just about anyone. He’s good-looking and hilarious and he’s the best goalie in the league. (Steve’s a goalie, too, but he won’t begrudge Bucky his talent, even for a second.) It’s more that Tony’s admitting he needs help with this. And that he wants to go out of his way to get something special for his sort-of-niece, even if it means asking Steve for a favor.
“It means, you-- James Barnes-- are not a killer on your own. All that violence was on them, and now that they’re gone-- I’ve got a lot of faith in who’s left behind, and so does Bruce. That’s why you’ve got a knife.”
“I’m bi,” Tony repeats again slowly. “I’ve just been reallllllllllly good at hiding it. And now I kind of wish I hadn’t. All this bad press-- I should have taken that hit. Made the way for guys like you.”
When Clint wants to turn on his mid-western charm, he can definitely make it work. His smile is so bright and sunny, Bruce laughs into his hand and coughs out the word “Suck up.”
He turns and walks out of the room before Bruce can reply. That fine-- that’s good. Bruce likely would have mumbled something embarrassing like
“Take as long as you need,” Bruce says. “You’re safe, I swear you’re safe. No one’s going to hurt you, or wipe your memories, or strap you to a chair. HYDRA-- they aren’t here. And if they show up, Clint, Sam and Natasha are here to protect you. Plus there’s me and the Other Guy. The Hulk.”
It actually takes Bruce a moment to remember what they’d been talking about before the spy games interrupted.  He starts cutting up some chicken and adding it into the stir fry as he talks.
Tony can never seem to resist reaching out and touching Steve’s chest when Steve’s shirt is off. Steve rolls Tony forward again, the last few inches, and tugs at Tony’s shirt.
“I know where Clint means,” Natasha says.  “And I approve, for what that’s worth.  We could land the Quinjet in the back field and use the stretcher to get James out of the jet,” Natasha says. “Keep him outdoors until he wakes up, then he could choose if he wants to go in the house.”
He reaches down to open his own box.  He saw Tony being sneaky as they were closing them up so he figures he’s got at least one or two surprises to look forward to.
“We called it fucking,” Steve says.  “And by the time your dad and I were friends I was already interested in someone else.  Howard knew my preferences and he helped me sneak around but that was the extent of it.  He never told you about any of this?”
Steve snorts a laugh.  “Virgin eyes?” Steve asks.  “You do realize I’ve probably seen more naked ass than you have, right?  Spend a few years on tour with showgirls then another couple in a warzone and there isn’t much left to corrupt.”
“Oh no.  Not at all,” Tony assures him, as he climbs out of the driver's seat.  “You should hear Rhodey when he gets going.  One time we got in a car in Malibu and we made it all the way to Vegas on just one rant,” Tony says fondly.
He reaches into his bag and pulls out a large knife Clint had handed him as they’d exited the jet. He leans closer to James and carefully places it in his still-functional right hand.
For a few minutes they chat about less important things. Bruce finds out Clint broke into the famous gazebo from the movie, and Clint laughs hard at Bruce's story about laying down to sleep only to realize his head is resting in cow--
Everything goes smoothly right up until the moment Clint snips the scissors shut against the first lock of hair. James is on his feet in an instant. The bench slams backwards into the wall with enough force to split the wood and splinter in a dozen directions. James doesn’t take off running. Instead he stops at the edge of the porch, and Bruce realizes somehow James now has the scissors in his hand and he’s holding them like a deadly weapon.
“Well, yeah. Except for that part,” Clint says. “But I wasn’t sure you didn’t know. I know you’ve said before that Hulk can sense those things even when you’re all... you shaped.”
Honesty does the trick. Tony’s hand hovers in mid-air and then he lowers his busted noisemaker slowly to the table. Steve continues.
He expects Tony to be a late riser and isn’t exactly sure how he’s going to get home, but Tony is awake and he’s making coffee and toast when Steve walks into the kitchen.
“Wait, what? Where are you?” Steve asks. There’s a shuffling in the background and Bruce can picture Steve grabbing his go bag and pulling on his shoes.
“Well, she’s been bugging me for a year to bring someone to the house for starters," Steve says. "I know this isn’t the best of circumstances, but I’m glad she’s going to get to meet you.”
Or Tony’s ability to process words mid panic attack. Everything hurts. Everything’s bad. Air is hard to find.
“It’s just me and you under this tree, and some friends over on the porch,” Bruce says. “I’m Bruce Banner. You came to find me. Do you remember that?”
“I want you to forgive me,” Tony says, his whole demeanor so worriedly vulnerable it nearly kills Steve. “I want to give us a shot. I want to be happy.”
“Don’t think of me as the nanny,” Rhodey says. “Think of me as the dude who shows up, makes sure you’ve showered, puts you in a suit, and gives you a shove toward a car.”
She straightens back up and looks at Steve expectantly. “You lovebirds know what you want to order?”
The sound reverberates in Tony’s ears as loud as the answering roar. Steve caught the puck. The game is lost. It’s over.
“It’s like I bought you at Wal-Mart,” Tony accuses. “Think if I box you up they’ll give me my money back?”
Steve chokes on a laugh.  “Tony.  What was I supposed to do?  Send you an email?  You’re kind of the definition of unreachable.”
Tony stumbles to the door once he’s on two feet and then uses the wall for support to get to the bathroom. He’s no longer drunk, he’s just too weak and miserably hungover to trust his treacherous legs with all his weight. When he’s done and his hands are washed, Tony steps back out into the hallway.
Bruce smiles at the image of Clint trying to sneak in and out of the bathtub to show up the famous Winter Soldier. It's also nice that the game is engaging James, and that seems promising.
Eventually Tony falls asleep and it’s nearly 9 when he wakes. He fully expects Steve to be gone, but he’s not. Tony smells bacon and coffee and hears voices. Two voices.
Tony only sees Steve’s commentary when he glances at his own phone, and then he laughs and rolls on top of Steve to wrestle his phone away from him so he can kiss him before the group reactions start coming in. And boy do they come in.
“God, no,” Bruce says, noticing the way James pauses a moment before each question. Like it’s shameful to want more information. "I want you to feel safe here,” Bruce goes on. “I want both of us to feel safe here.”
“Are you competitive enough for this to be a problem?” Steve asks.  He’s smiling, so Tony isn’t worried he’s annoyed.
“Child’s play,” Tony sighs.  “You’re sure, Nanna?  This could be dangerous and I don’t know I’m worth it.”
“Coming next on IceTalk Weekly: Should more teams start suspending for less? If Tony Stark and Steve Rogers are any proof, the answer is yes. Stark was out for alcohol, and Rogers for a fight off the ice, and you know what they have in common? Their return to the game has brought with it the kind of hockey play I haven’t seen in 30 years. Stay tuned for an in-depth analysis.”
“Yeah, well, me and Bucky Barnes have a few things in common, then,” James says. “Thinkin’ you’ve got no sense is one of them.”
“Don’t have too much fun without me,” Clint warns. “I’m gonna be really pissed if I get back in the morning and you’ve stayed up all night having bro talk and braiding each other’s hair.”
“This is awesome,” Tony insists. “Jenny’s going to love hers, and mine is going on display. Come on.”
It’s Sunday, and today it’s Tony’s turn to read their homework assignment out loud.  Considering Tony’s reaction, Steve braces himself for a doozy.  He reaches for the paper and takes it carefully out of Tony’s shaking hands.
“You’re kind of embarrassing, too, Uncle Tony,” Jenny proclaims as she lets Tony go. “But you don’t pull up to my school blasting country music, so you’re doing better than dad.”
“You should ask Tony,” Bruce says.  “I avoid the unfiltered internet as much as possible.  Comments aren’t good for my calm.”
He’s staring straight forward, as if anticipating orders to hold still. He looks up in surprise when Bruce holds out the brick.
Natasha gives a small shrug.  “Clint nearly died because he did something reckless.  Nothing out of the ordinary there.”
Clint is still sleeping when Bruce and Steve walk in together. James is holding a knife in his good hand. No surprise there.
“I think Bruce might be overstating things,” Sam says from the screen. “Nice to meet you, though. And just to get it out of the way, no hard feelings over yanking off my wings back in DC. I got total respect for your skills and I’m always glad to meet a fellow bad-ass.”
Steve nods robotically.  “You’re right.  He’s safe.  That’s what’s important.”  Every word sounds forced and false.
“I want to talk about Steve Rogers,” she says, pointing to the screen, where Steve’s obliviously at work.  “I looked into what it would take to protect the company legally if you were to date an employee.”
“Yeahhhhhh,” Natasha says. “I’m gonna say it’s probably a good idea for us to keep an eye on you two, anyway. Bucky, you good?”
Steve looks more closely at the young man before him. And yes, he can see it. The same wide eyes and dark curls. The cupid bow lips. A smile that could launch a thousand ships.
“Can I ask you a question first?” Steve asks.  “Just one.  Then I’ll smother you for as long as you like.”
“Ever since Bucky accidentally shot through the kitchen wall, Nanna’s had the gun basket,” Steve explains.  He’s smirking, obviously delighted by the story.
“I don’t know,” Steve replies. “I guess that depends on how you feel about old people. Personally, I think they’re great.”
“James, I’m going to suggest total parenteral nutrition-- that’s nutrition through an IV-- instead of giving you a feeding tube, since your body has been under so much stress. Until you heal a little more, your digestive system may be sluggish and you might not absorb enough nutrients to jumpstart your healing. So I would like to run this--” Bruce rustles around in one of the little carts Natasha and Sam had brought in, then holds up a small, packaged tube “--into your subclavian vein, which runs right through here.”
“And boy mags,” Clint says cheerfully. “If you’d looked past the first one you’d see I am all about equal-opportunity porn.”
“Thanks,” Bruce says. “To catch everybody up, James is awake and consenting to further medical care. He’ll allow me and Clint close and he’d prefer if Sam and Natasha stay out of reach. Tony and Steve-- if you’re on the monitor he’s okay with that. Jarvis, he knows to expect your voice.”
“It’s going to be in every paper,” Tony insists.  He’s agitated.  Maybe on Steve’s behalf?  His anger is confusing.  “Captain America’s a homo.  You really want to read that?”
“Maybe Bucky was protecting his friend?” Bruce asks, not wanting to accidentally program any definites into the soldier. He knows just enough about brainwashing to know he treads on dangerous ground, and that he’s probably already fucking things up. “You said you’re Bucky’s corpse. Maybe there’s more of him left in there than just a body.”
