“you guys look cozy" nat commented , clint fake gagged as he placed cartons of food on the table beside them.
“Uhm, hold on” Tony said wiggling a little bit in Steve’s arms and Steve readjusted his grip on tony so he wouldn’t fall, he reached into his back pocket and pulled out a key card holding it up.
steve was not ready for the feeling of missing tony wash over him as soon he let the door close behind him. It was silly, Steve thought shaking his head. But in all seriousness he was not letting that kid go, no matter the nature of their relationship once Steve got a look at the vulnerability he displayed in the past few minutes,he didn’t think he could just walk away.
Most likely Tony wouldn’t be going home today, but Steve didn’t want to make any promises to Tony right now . He was not sure how he would take it in his exhausted state of mind. Natasha would have already have a team of agents working on figuring out what was going on. Steve trusted her with it, and he has to first make sure that Tony is alright first.
“Pepper says I have to apologise for the way I behaved with you yesterday” and yet as Steve waited for one, it never came.
“Serum does all kinds of things huh?” he whispered as he traced his tongue along the outer shell of Tony’s ear and felt the goosebumps forming along his neck.
“He doesn’t, we asked him" nat said and Bruce was still not satisfied . Neither of them were but it was only a working theory.
"It's okay , I am not mad" he said again and would say over an over until Tony needed him to. It dawned on him that it didnt help that Steve's initial reaction to finding Tony in a bar early afternoon may be why Tony was trying to justify it.
She walked straight up to Steve ignoring her friends on the way and leaned up on her tip toes and said in a rushed whisper
"Obie is very verbal but he has never actually hurt me" steve took several deep breaths while nosing Tony's hair.
“Are you leaving?” he asked feeling like this moment of catchup was not enough in the least and he wanted to hang on to this time as much as possible.
Pulling the blanket around his waist Steve crossed his arms around his chest and tilted his head back, eyes closed taking deep breaths.
“Tony , sweetheart I didn’t mean it like that. You were going through something so I just thought my problems can wait until we have sorted yours out okay?” tony sniffled against him and Steve was not sure if it was from a cold he was catching or from something else but Steve rubbed his palm against his back anyway in a gentle motion.  “in fact , I am feeling so much better now that you are here with me.” He finally dropped a kiss to the brunette hair and Tony hummed against him but Steve knew there was something that Tony had wanted to say but didn’t.
“You know what, I need you to tell me as much as possible. I know you don’t want to talk about it, but we need to know okay? Or else we cannot help you bud.”
“this is the problem, you think you have the maturity to handle something like this and in reality you are just a kid. I honestly don’t know what I was expecting” he threw his arms up in irritation
“He will never tell me even if he wasn’t" steve said knowing it was true and that Tony’s fear of Bucky had just increased by a whole lot and not to mention his worry of losing Steve to Bucky. He laughed quietly to himself when he suddenly realized that natasha was right. Gentle Kisses and cuddles were not enough for what Tony puts up with him.
“is that tony?” Natasha asked and before Steve could answer, he caught sight of the large boot shaped bruise blossoming on Tony’s back. It looked painfully raw and Steve almost choked on his words
“Ow! Its biting me" he said shuffling to take it off and natasha bless her heart leaned close to them , used one to run through his hair and the other to hold his clipped finger hostage long enough for them to get a reading.
“okay , but I thought we agreed it was safer for him to be..” she trailed off noticing Tony’s silence through the new conversation and frowned at him. Something was wrong and it had to do with Tony.
“That is a hall-pass to the nurse, not for lingering in the hallway is it now?” He was proud of that one when tony looked miffed . “Is there a reason you are avoiding the nurse as well?”
He shook his head in amusement as he went back to stacking the papers he had collected from his students when he suddenly realized something.
Tony immediately latched onto the emotion on Steve’s face as he entered the room to help tony off the table
“I love you sweetheart” he whispered into the silence and leaned down to kiss him once softly on his lips and put his free hand on Tony’s chest just above his heart , feeling the rhythm of it beating.
suddenly Natasha stiffened just a smidge and before he could trace her eyes to look at what she was seeing, she leaned in , kissed him softly and whispered in his ear “twelve o clock”
“I am going back to shield” he huffed and Steve caught his hand just in time and pulled him back to the bed. He settled against Steve immediately and Steve knew that Tony had missed this as well.
“Tony I don’t know what is going on in that head of yours. Sit down. “ He said not so gently pushing him towards the couch
“ but I want you to know that you can share these kind of things with me okay? I don’t care if you are embarrassed , I was terrified today at school when you reacted the way you did and we could have avoided that if you had told me” Tony only nodded
He gently let his hand take a hold of Tony’s chin turning his face towards him as he checked his pupil responses. Tony cringed at the light trying to move away
“You are supposed to be dead” Steve’s eyes snapped back to Tony’s, the expresssion he caught on Tony’s face was nothing short of wonder and disbelief.
“Hey sweetheart, welcome back” he said as he leaned down to wipe Tony's sweaty hair off his forehead
Tony was getting better a lot faster than expected. He was fussy about his medications and the constant cleaning of the reactor casing irritated him but he always calmed down if Steve was near him. He was clingy just as Steve had expected but it wasn’t as bad as he had thought.
“I honestly don’t know, I was trying to avoid it as best as I can. Trust me I really tried" both nat and Clint smirked at him “but yesterday happened and I held him in my arms as he slept you know?” it was the first time he had caught natasha trying to hide a smile at him , he knows he must look flustered and it was odd to think that a sixteen year old had him feeling this way.
Generally he would never spend this kind of money on something like shoes but this was not for him, he was going to take Tony for a jog tonight and he wanted to give him some motivation.  He hoped the neon colors were the right choice. The next thing he did buy oddly enough were two pairs of briefs, again not for him but for Tony. He needed some support in that area area after what happened today. Atleast for two days. The shopkeeper looked at him funny when he asked for briefs for a sixteen year old because apparently sixteen year olds do their own underwear shopping and he looked at him even weirder when Steve made some odd choices of pink and green ones. I mean he just thought Tony would look good in them , the shopkeeper didn’t have to know that though. So he quickly bought his things and headed for the tower. It was already dark out and if he was going to be making Tony jog then he better get there sooner. He was really hoping to try Buckys advice and wear the teen out.
“I don’t know, he says stane is the only family he has left" his shoulders sagged as he said it and Bruce placed a grounding hand on his shoulder and Steve finally sat down taking the water.
now Tony looked amused but he still turned to Steve who gave him a confirmatory nod , and he finally nodded to natasha as he lifted an arm for her to inject
"Mr. Stark! What can you reveal about the new SI upgrade?" and so began the evening of paparazzi and drinks. I just wanted tony to have a little fun tonight.
Steve made himself take deep breaths before easing his grip on Tony’s arms. He leaned forward and kissed him gently , soft like he could break the boy in his arms if he pushed too hard.
He took a second to actually take in the scene before interfering. It looked like Tony was going to pounce on Ty and he looked absolutely determined to do so.
“she’s just joking , relax okay?” and Tony gave a frustrated sigh and pulled the blanket around his shoulders trying to hide from natasha.
steve agreed to waking him up , but didn’t want to put him down. Steve will hold him like this all night if that’s what Tony needed from him. He ignored Bruce’s first comment and turned towards the mop of sweaty hair by the side of his neck.
Steve couldn’t open his mouth, everything stane was saying was right, there was absolutely no argument there.
Natasha and Steve were at a subway station on an undercover mission to track down a mad scientist who threatened to blow the place up if the government did not fund for his crazy experiments. Normally this wasn’t the kind of things shield bothered with but the scientist was talking about contacting aliens from a third world and just like that it had become shields problem to deal with.
Tony surprisingly nodded “Kay, but it was not obie , it’s not his fault. Don’t call him . Promise me you won’t call him.” He said his eyes flitting between Steve’s face and the phone he had picked up.
“tony what are you doing?” she asked him and Tony didn't even look up but answered “fixing your microwave” and nat raised both her eyebrows at Steve who simply shrugged.
“why am I here?” he asked his voice still raspy but clearer, he wanted to sound pissed but he didn’t have the energy. His mind was trying to work a mile a minute trying to remember what happened last night the confusion evident on his face.
“will you let me show you what it feels like? If I cant tell you how much I love you, will you let me show you tony?” he asked and Tony stilled under him , breath shaky and his flailing hands landed on Steve’s back as he hovered over him , not touching but just grazing.
He gave her quick once over nothing the pallor and pinched her skin on the back of her palm finding that she was indeed just dehydrated.
“Okay ,kitchen stat.” nat said looking at Steve in a no nonsense tone and then she said to Tony “honey, I need to talk to Steve about something so I’ll really appreciate it if you kept yourself busy for a while” see now that scared him, she never spoke directly .
“I have him okay? Go on Steve, hey you have to snap out of it come on" he heard her say and he got up on shaky legs stepping out of the shower his clothes dripping wet.
Steve’s attention was immediately drawn to the room he had made Tony sit in as he exited the meeting . He frowned at the sight of few people gathered around Tony in the room. Two of them Steve recognized immediately. Phil was saying something to another agent and Clint was leaning by Tony s chair and saying something to him. He made his way over to them
“don’t want it, I don’t want it please” he begged even though Steve had told him they would get it out ,it was only a matter of minutes for the nurse to get here.
“you hear things, their death is still on the news, magazines, everybody knows. When I read it , the way they were found in the car.” His voice was barely above a whisper when he then said “it wasn’t hard to put two and two together"
Tony had been silent after that not saying anything. He put the car in park and they headed inside as tony dropped his ‘new bag' (he had thrown the old one away not wanting to even deal with it) on the living room couch and pulled Steve to his room with a firm grasp on his wrist.
“Yeah , is he here?” he asked looking around and Steve sighed running his palms along Tony’s thighs and shook his head , he stood up , pulling Tony with him who just wrapped his arms around steve and tucked his head against his chest.
“Because I want to say yes and I know it’s the wrong answer” Steve’s heart tugged at the admission and he took a moment trying to exactly decipher how to handle this. Tony watched him the entire time , he looked even more troubled than he was before admitting it
And ofcourse both were about Tony. One, why did Steve think a fifteen year old was adorable and two, why had Tony flinched ? Of the two the one that disturbed him the most was his off late need to protect Tony from whatever had frightened him hard enough to flinch that day. And this lead to the first thought again ,why were these feelings surfacing for the brunette? And then the thought cycle began all over again. So Steve spent the next week trying to subtly observe Tony in class or his interactions with his friends to notice if anything was off that warranted that flinch.
“Steve, breathe” he felt a hand on his shoulder and he wanted to laugh at the person because couldn’t they see? He was trying.
"No hey, phil no blood tests" steve took over and Tony calmed down . Clint leaned over and pulled the sweatshirt Tony still had wrapped around his waist. It came off easily but Tony gasped , a look of shame covering his face.
“Well, Mr stark I am glad you told us that, or we wouldn’t have ever known. Up until now we all were under the impression that history was the most creative of them all.” The class snickered, he knew the kids loved him and it was mostly because of his carefree attitude and attempted friendly banter. But he was also very keenly and uncomfortably aware of the pining girls he learned masterfully to avoid after the first few months.
After a long conversation of backstories , Steve caught them up on who Bucky was to him . The whole time, Bucky seemed to be battling an inner battle within himself like he was fighting an unseen force that was tampering with his head. They had him chained and his hands and feet bound to a solid rebar on the quinjet.
“Tony? Wake up for me honey” he said gently shaking his shoulder and then running his fingers through his hair , he mumbled something about being tired and rolled over.
“I do believe you" tony turned his head around surprised and Steve kissed him softly and it was sweet and Tony was being calm and pliant and Steve wanted the moment to last forever.
I had actually written it but somehow got deleted and had to re-write it!! I am just upset because it's honestly been hard to write it again. It's never the same again 🙈
“no please just a while longer . I promise nothing happened ,I just like this” he admitted and Steve gave him an unimpressed look ready to argue that something must have happened but Tony smirked at him and added “A lot"  Steve’s racing heart took a minute to calm down
Tony had the door unlocked and was holding it open for Steve and they both rushed inside Tony almost tripping over the carpet and steve caught his wrist to steady him.
“You love me” he said nuzzling at Tony’s hair with his nose as he wrapped his arms around the genius pulling him flush against his body ,feeling every inch of it along with Tony’s squirming.
"That's enough, if you cannot talk it out in a civil manner you can both hash it out in detention." He stated walking away to write it up.
Tony looked like he wanted to run ,but Steve wouldn’t have it, he slipped a hand under him and picked him up ignoring the stares he got and walked determinedly to Tony’s room before putting him down on the bed.
“I think he is. Bruce?” steve asked waiting for the next move. Bruce quickly got up from his chair and felt Tony's forehead cursing softly at the heat.
“Can we go to the astrophysics section?” Before Steve could process the request and tell them no and to stay with the group, pepper burst into a litany of explanation “it’s just one floor above us, we will stay there until you guys come up, we promise! We have already seen this before and the..” Steve tuned her out as his eyes landed on tony, his soft looking lips were forming a subtle pout, which Steve realised a little too late that it was aimed at him. His head was nodding, giving tony permission to do anything he wanted even before his brain had processed it. He frowned as he watched pepper drag tony after her towards the elevator as she yelled out a thank you.
“feels good?” he asked him as he gently bit at Tony’s shoulder and Tony whimpered in pain and Steve lapped his tongue over the abused skin to soothe it .
“no, we were posing as couples to catch that guy who set off the bomb” tony didn’t look up when Steve turned when he was only met with silence.
“Tony let’s fix your leg and then we can head down to the beach for a while" he said and Tony nodded against his chest .
Bruce frowned deeper “see that honestly doesn’t make sense , have any of you spoken to Bucky and asked him if he has any relation to stane?”
“I am a little tired, but nothing a little food won’t fix" tony gave a stifled laugh and Steve gave a confused look
"Sir is seemingly excited, currently working on your shield's paint job. You may have to pry him away from it, I suggest some bribe with bacon" Jarvis always knew how to manipulate Tony into doing things that's good for him. Once when Tony had worked continuously for 72 hours with no sleep, Jarvis had purposefully shut down claiming malware and Tony had finally emerged from his lab with lack of anything to do since his AI was not working. He would have noticed Jarvis bluffing if he hadn't been so tired.
"Tony?I am going down to the common room to get breakfast,the rest of the team is already there. join us as soon as you are finished here,I'll make you a plate "
“he will be okay. I promise. But the rest of them are going to be worried so please go tell them that we are fine.”
“please Steve not like this" he said again his voice pleading and it tugged at Steve's heart as he realized what Tony was trying to say.  Easing his fingers down to his chin, Steve kissed him on his cheek softly
Steve sighed in frustration as nat moved away from the door, “go tell him you are on his side. I am going to go talk to coulson and find out what I can” she said and he thanked her silently watching her go.
I groaned at that "Tony, honey, it's a party for you and what you have accomplished with your new SI upgrade. How about you refrain from working for just the two hours and enjoy for a while huh?" Tony was always a workaholic, it's something I have always admired about him. But off-late it was getting out of control. Ever since the fainting episode one week ago he has seemed a little off. It's been obvious that he's been having trouble sleeping, I know that from all the tossing and turning he's been doing at night. He's not been spending as much time with the team either. I just hope this party is the break he needs.
I wanted advice on whether I should leave this story here or delete it before I start it over again?
“That’s not how it works, and you know it” Steve was surprised Tony was now using childish arguments. He was always used to Tony’s snippy smart answers.
I was wondering if I should get peggy back into the picture? Let me know what you guys think and again thanks in advance!
He slipped on some thing comfortable and made his way back over to Tony’s room only to run into fury on the way.
“Do you want to share with me what happened?” He asked as he was finishing up and tony went rigid his arms coming down to drop by his sides.
“Is Steve going to be doing an interview?” Tony asked, though it felt like his tongue had swollen up in his mouth.
The angry clouds spun above him as he lay there, half on grass, half on gravel, staring blankly at the sky.
Steve moved up with Blaine to the bank, staying submerged as they moved closer to the two targets Pearson had highlighted on their HUDs.
“Everyone knew the criminal was guilty. But he wasn’t condemned. It’s up to us to do the same—to recognize guilt, the consequences, and extend grace anyway.”
He didn’t even want to see Bucky or Sam. They made him feel heavy, though he didn’t know why. Like his blood was the consistency of sludge in his veins, like he was being forced back into a world he had fought so hard to get away from. Sam had moved on long ago, Steve had forced him to. Not returning his calls, not telling him he’d moved to Maine, not being able to find the same connection they had shared before. It wasn’t fair to Sam or Bucky, but Steve just didn’t know how to be around them anymore.
The fix was pretty easy, yet Tony found himself unable to play God. Extremis was the be-all-fix-all. One easy injection, a few tweaks that only one man on earth knew about so as to prevent Extremis from getting into the wrong hands (again), and he would be ticking until he either “cured” himself as he had once before, or the world exploded. Or the sun fried them. Or the undead claimed him.
“Just tell me where Tony is,” Steve said quietly. Not-Tony didn’t seem to be displaying any physical evidence of trying to be threatening, but that didn’t mean Steve was going to trust him. “I need to know that he’s okay.”
“So will I,” Steve countered. “And I think we should announce it relating to the Avengers. That way if anyone finds out it’s a sham, they won’t be able to pin it on a charity or something.”
“This is why I worry about you,” Tony murmured. “You’re all alone in this apartment when Peter’s not here. That’s not healthy, Steve. You can’t sit here with your thoughts all day. Trust me, it only makes it worse.”
“Whatever happens when you wake up, you can’t stop it. It’s going to feel real, but like a dream at the same time, you understand? You can’t stop it. It has to happen.”
Steve started pouring glasses and remembered why he had come downstairs in the first place. “You boys need to unpack. Might as well do it tonight before you start tearing up the town.”
Peter would stay at Tony’s for the summer, then he would decide not to come back to the “sad little apartment.” He would go to court with Tony’s lawyers and change the custody agreement and Steve would let him do it without so much as a peep of resistance. He had no right to be Peter’s guardian, any claim he had would never hold up against Stark lawyers. Tony was Peter’s biological father. Tony would always get what he wanted.
“They were very impressed,” Winona continued. “And the emphasis was on you. Of course Steve Rogers isn’t hurting things, but the way you’ve projected yourself in the social atmosphere really has been quite amazing.”
“I hate you for what you did to Dad and me. And to Jackson. Because Jackson has to live knowing his husband doesn’t even love him all the way, but instead loves some prick who lives who knows where doing who knows what. I have no sympathy for you,” Peter cut. “And if something ever happens to me and MJ, it’s because of what you did to me. Because you set the worst possible example anyone could have dreamed of for a dad.”
“I wasn’t—” Tony cut himself off. Let Steve think he’d come down here purposely if he wanted. “I wasn’t planning on discussing my problematic side while I was down here, but I can’t say I’m upset.”
Steve was never late to anything by five minutes, much less thirty. But yet he always waited at least an hour, every time.
Bucky gave a curt nod and left without saying goodbye to Tony or Jackson, but they didn’t seem to notice. They were lost in their own little world, though Jackson was trying not to be obvious about it.
Tony knew about this? For how long? Steve wanted to ask, but refrained. He wouldn’t have wanted to hear this from Tony. There would probably have been a glimmer of pride in his voice
“Emory, you got reading on these guys?” Steve unhooked a grenade from his belt, flicking through the options.
If anything, it would start sooner than it had with his mother and father. He and Tony were physical people already, thanks to their jobs as Avengers. They already got in each other’s faces when things got nasty. They already grabbed and tried to hold each other in place when they yelled at each other.
“What the hell is that thing anyway?” Tony snapped, hurriedly standing up straight again. “Who the hell designed it?” Friday was taking scans as the nanobots spread out over his torso again. Just in case.
“No,” Tony said with a shake of his head. “But we should head to bed. All of that science made me tired.”
Bucky scowled at him and looked like he might be reconsidering throwing a punch. Instead, he let out a sigh. “Steve didn’t send me, if that’s what you’re wondering.”
Tony wasn’t making conversation or making jokes or even commenting about how much this car cost like he might have done before. Tony used to want a conversation with him.
“Shut up.” Bucky gave him a firm metal pat on the forehead just for good measure. “No hearts in  your eyes while you’re on mission, got it?”
“With his dying breaths, Jesus extended grace to the criminal hanging beside him. There was no hope for him, no chance to promise God if he could just get out, he’d change his life, no chance to turn his life around. No more Goodness Points to be earned—and yet Jesus gave him grace!” The pastor paused, staring straight at him. Steve didn’t flinch, mostly because he knew it was too dark where he was sitting for the man to actually make out anything in the inky blackness from the stage.
He didn’t have time for protocol, and if anything were to happen he had a very strong not-boyfriend somewhere close that could probably defend him from whatever came his way. Not that Tony Stark needed protecting, but he did like to give Steve a job.
“Probably a good thing we broke up, then,” Tony said with a nod. “You shouldn’t put up with that kind of behavior from anyone.”
Steve realized as he slid from the water that he had been on this team for almost two years now. Two years of hard fighting, covert missions, and enough training to destroy a normal human being. Hell, he’d even grown a beard.
“Mhm.” Steve closed his eyes. It was nice to feel Tony’s body heat, even if they weren’t touching. His body began to relax, as though it knew the weight of the body next to him was the one he had been waiting for. “Slept a lot worse ways,” he added after a moment, a little smile coming to his face.
Steve nodded once, knowing full well he would never set foot there again. He didn’t belong there. That was Peter and Tony’s place.
Steve tried to tell him that Peter needed help, tried to turn to show Tony, but Tony kept turning his head back, stopping from screaming only to shake his head, to whimper and sob.
. Not Tony. Steve squeezed his eyes shut, trying to rile up some sort of anger through the wet wool of devastation weighing on his emotion. Tony wasn’t allowed in here. They’d discussed that. They’d fucking discussed that!
It was bad enough he was crouched there, totally naked with sand up his ass. As if that wasn’t humiliating enough.
He peeked out, but there was no call of surprise, no confetti, no indication that Tony had been hiding for good reason. No, the penthouse was utterly silent, washed in shadow and warm light as the sun sank between the skyscrapers outside.
“Agree to disagree.” Tony pecked his cheek, then grabbed a pair of flashy sunglasses from his dresser. “Let’s get going, we’re getting past the fashionable part of fashionably late.”
“Forget I said anything,” Peter tried. “I’ll stay here, it’s fine. I want to stay with you, Pops. So what if it’s twenty extra minutes? I was being whiny.”
Steve’s heart leapt to his throat. He couldn’t find any words to say, because he had no idea what was going to come out of Tony’s mouth. Tony looked equally as pained, and for a moment they just stared at each other.
“Tony,” Steve found himself saying, his head dipping to a nod. His body knew better than his brain sometimes. “Good to see you.”
Okay, not really. Steve himself was perfectly fine now—happy, healthy, his normal self. But something along the way to returning to normal had driven away the one person Steve Rogers loved with all of his heart.
Steve found himself wondering if his Tony was even waiting for him, or if he just assumed that Steve was still ignoring him. Maybe he had a flood of texts waiting for him, or none at all. Or maybe Tony was angry. Tony didn’t really like arguing with him in person when he could send texts instead.
Oh god, things would have been so much worse for Tony if they would have used Steve for the surrogate. What a horrible, awful life that child would have had to endure. Braces, crutches, wheelchairs, month-long doctor’s visits. Tony probably would have gotten him arrested for child abuse just because he should have known any child of his would turn out sickly and weak.
Like his brain boiling. He could feel it happening in his skull, slowly but surely simmering the life away from him.
He loved Tony. Steve’s body shuddered, wrenching as his nervous system started rapid firing, a swan song before it melted inside him.
Tony still asked him out for coffee to catch up. Tony still sat beside him at press conferences. Tony still threw him a birthday party and Tony still answered on the first ring whenever Steve called.
Tony read the shock on Steve’s face and chuckled. “You’ll get there. There’s a lot you’ll both have to work through. But you love him, right?”
“Dad’ll make sure you’re okay,” Peter said with a half-smile. He ducked a little closer. “And you gotta let him, okay?
Blaine shot him a look before taking his hand. “It doesn’t matter. We complete the mission. Augh!” He winced, then slung his right arm around a few times the same way Bucky did after he got his arm looked at.
Steve nodded once and looked back down at his bowl of oatmeal. That had been a really stupid thing to say. He
Steve put on a weak smile and turned his head to capture Tony’s lips with his own. He didn’t feel much better about the situation with Candice, but he trusted Tony. Tony would protect their family in all of the ways Steve couldn’t.
Steve cut him off with a kiss before Tony could ruin all of this talking about the divorce. Tony was very high now—he must have popped more pills while Steve went looking for the robe. He’d been on a downswing after the shower, but now he was talking about things he shouldn’t be and didn’t seem capable of being still.
He wanted to argue, but he wasn’t sure he could. The past month had felt like friendship to Tony, but did it really count? Did any of this count?
Maria pushed the door open and rushed out with Franklin right behind her. Steve hugged close to the glass as he followed, and stayed within a foot of the door as Maria rushed into the arms of her father, who had tears in his eyes. With advanced hearing, it wasn’t hard for Steve to hear their conversation.
“I don’t know how I’m gonna do this, Pete,” Steve whispered into the darkness. “But I don’t think Daddy and I can stay together. I just don’t want to hurt you, you know?”
“Great to see you, buddy,” Rhodey said with about the fakest smile Steve had ever seen. “Go right on in.”
Tony scowled. “Don’t kid yourself, Rogers. I’m not exactly keen on this either, but backing out after photos like that--with our history?--It might be better to keep it going a little bit.” He shook his head. “We’ll discuss in two days, after we see what the news cycles spit out.
Winona did not seem pleased by his answer. She sat back in her chair just slightly, just enough that Tony could read the disappointment in all of her angles. “The longer you wait to tell him, the greater the chance of him finding out from some other source. I can’t guarantee that this will stay out of the public eye. My priority is getting you a child, not protecting Steve.”
He waved to Natasha, who was wearing a beautiful dark purple dress and Clint Barton as an accessory. She waved back and elbowed Clint until he turned around, and then Clint was waving too. They said something to each other and smiled, similar to when they were exchanging information on mission, pretending to be a wedded couple.
It was true. Steve had taken a long time to ask Tony to go to a game with him precisely because he knew Tony didn’t like baseball, so he’d been more than surprised when Tony showed up decked out in Dodgers gear, and it had taken a full hour for Steve to figure out that Tony hadn’t just memorized every baseball fact he could think of and instead had them scrolling across his sunglasses at will.
He remembered his mother telling him how makeup was very important because a woman had to look pretty. But he also remembered her using it to cover up her purpled eyes and the ugly bruises on her neck.
Bucky put a hand on his shoulder again, smiling though it didn’t reach his eyes. Bucky was still worried, and Steve didn’t blame him. He wasn’t so sure he would make it through this without cracking apart. But he would be breathing, and that was what mattered.
“I wanted a ride from the tarmac,” Steve blurted out. “I wanted you to be there. I mean—I guess you have a daughter now and of course she comes first but I’ve been gone for three months. If you really want me here, why didn’t you come see me? I waited for you.”
Steve often wondered what Iron Man did for a living outside of the team. What his hobbies were. He was incredibly sensitive to emotion in others, and Steve suspected he might be a therapist. It’d be a perfect cover. And he seemed to know Tony better than Steve did most of the time.
Peter had the same eyes as he had when he was a toddler, big and round, still edged with those thick black lashes that were ripped straight off of Tony.  Peter had always been Tony’s son, not his. And himself and Peter…well, they had certainly tried. How strange it must have been for that little dark-haired kid who had once been so excited to make pancakes to figure out that his Papa was just a stranger who was good at playing house.
The train announced the next stop, and a few passengers shuffled to make room for a bigger crowd. Steve noticed little compartments near the front and back of the train, and stepped closer to look at the picture descriptions on each one.
His phone buzzed and Steve felt his entire body tense as he looked over and saw that the message as from Tony.
“About MJ’s dad…he, uh, was like our dads.” Tony said quietly when the rest of the table was laughing at something Candice had said.
“If there ever is someone else,” Tony whispered. “We’ll figure it out. You hear me? And if they try to take me away from you, I’ll choose you every time.”
Tony frowned, unconvinced. Morgan had been through fevers before, but this one just felt worse than the others. She’d been sluggish and cranky all day, and just wanted to sleep—all of which was very unusual for her.
Tony didn’t lift his hand right away. “This already sounds ridiculously stupid in my head so I’m sure it’ll sound even worse saying it out loud, but do want, like, a hug or something?”
The black water sloshed above the side, slicking the floor of the boat. The sides were too high for Steve to see anything but the monotone grey of the sky above. Two sailors already on the boat looked on, trading a cigarette and muttering to each other.  One had a face marred with pockmarks, and the other had a crooked nose. And funny eyebrows. Steve still remembered those bushy eyebrows, the way they furrowed and lifted. He saw the guy for maybe five minutes that day. Never saw him after.
“She’s extremely talented,” Mrs. Freeman said brightly. Where usually Tony would see that as a surface-level compliment, he believed she was being genuine. “We truly hope she’ll be joining us next class.”
Jackson shook his head. “No, no. You’ve been far too kind already, Steve. Letting us stay here, making us dinner—just let me know where we’ll be sleeping and I’ll take care of the rest.”
Even when he was inspecting his weapon as he was now, it never took Bucky more than two minutes to put it together. When she was complete, she was massive. Shorter than an Intervention, but no less intimidating.
“Pops, please,” Peter said, but his voice was tinged with—was that annoyance? “I worked so hard for this internship—“
The fight became useless, so Steve finally relented to save energy and begin looking for a possible point of weakness in whatever was about to happen to him.
Bucky clipped the radio back into place and motioned for Steve to turn. A rusty metal table and two folding chairs sat in the only spot on the platform covered with roofing, though the wood was rotten and full of holes.
“Okay.” Steve wasn’t going to push it. Bucky was just looking out for him, but he could handle himself. He could handle this news and watch his life fall apart.
It didn’t feel fair sometimes, that Steve got to have the life with Tony that the other Tony hadn’t. That he was able to prevent mistakes that their alternate selves had made. But he was thankful for it all the same. He had Tony, and they had a lifetime of happiness to look forward to.
“But I make it up those stairs, my whole day’s wages gone in one swoop, balancin’ three different kinds ‘a tonic,” Bucky continued, but the teasing tone was gone. “And get back in that dump of a flat, cover ya with two more blankets ‘cause you’re a punk who thinks he doesn’t get cold, and I stuff ya up with medicine ‘til you can’t hardly open your eyes.” His grip started to loosen on Steve’s forearm, but Steve didn’t pull away.
Tony let go of Steve’s hand. “Because it hurts,” he sighed. “Sometimes I’d just see his name on my phone and be angry because I couldn’t see how we went through everything together and he’d never told me. I’ll never agree with his decision, but I learned that there are more important things to focus on. And I’d relive that moment a million times if it meant he came back.”
Bruce handed him a towel and pointed to the showers “take a shower. We need to scrub in in less than an hour. I have to give him pre anesthetic medications” he said evenly , his mind was elsewhere Steve could tell he was more focused on what was going to happen in the surgery.
“he’s your guardian right?” tony nodded and Steve held perfectly still as tony scooted close to him again.
“do you want to lay down?”steve stiffened , his hold growing tighter around Tony . He couldn’t see Tony’s face, but he knew for sure Tony didn’t want that either.
"Speaking of the little devil, he sent me a text saying he is not coming over after detention" steve frowned as he pulled out a water bottle and settled down with a file on the couch.
“Tony? Answer me honey” he asked again and when he didn’t hear anything natasha quickly strode over trying the knob but the door was locked from the inside.
“Tony” the teen looked up at him expectantly as Steve continued “ you can always come to me, if you need to talk about what happened”
“been busy, applied for a grant for my research on radiation. It’s been a difficult time, but pushing through it.” Steve was always impressed with how hard working Bruce was, not only was he truly intelligent he also knew how to stay humble and work hard.
“Yeah, he’s not taking it well though. Can you please do the Iv, there is only so much I can torture him with" steve said motioning to it.
“Oh baby" he whispered as he leaned forward and gave him a kiss. “Welcome back" he said smiling widely and Tony frowned at him
He wished he had asked tony why he insisted on going back everytime. Now he had wait until Tony was willing to talk about this again.
“That stance is somehow involved. And that he knew we will move in after three weeks and he knew about the tracker.” Clint said as he waited for realization to sink in.
He found him , thankfully still asleep and thanked natasha for sitting with him , he pushed the railing down on his side of the bed, sat down beside tony and shook him gently.
“well, I did get kidnapped today" steve said carefully using his left hand to support Tony’s back and keep him stable as he pushed back eyes wide
I knew what was going to happen once the movie was over, I even knew the movie was only a distraction from the shot of iron that was apparently inevitable. Bruce had made that clear to me.
“What about the time we spoke in your class room and the swimming pool locker?” he asked and suddenly just like that a few gears clicked in Steve’s head.
pepper waved and head towards the platform while tony stayed rooted in place , his head cocked to the left slightly as he eyes Steve.
“That’s just it, I am not. I can’t help myself around him Clint, I see him and I think this boy is going to be the death of me.”
steve did as told, but also understood the motive over it . He did it deliberately slowly knowing tony was watching and just as he put his arms through he heard a whimper and a distinct “ow” . He smiled to himself pulling the shirt over completely.
“If you think it can wait till tomorrow,  you can tell me tomorrow. Tony I am sorry I got angry,  I was just worried. But I don’t want you to feel like you cannot make your own ddecisions, because I trust you.”
Steve counted to ten before he felt himself fall slack , chin falling to his chest. He vaguely felt something vibrate at his inner thigh before his vision blacked out entirely.
“you said you are feeling unwell and you thing this is the fix?” steve asked him because obviously he had been lying about it and Tony looked away his face turning more red by the minute.
“You leave that to me, okay?” he frowned but nodded and Steve lowered his hand from Tony’s hair to his back and didn’t stop until they were resting just below the swell of his cheek.
“I don’t care" was the reply he got in return and if that didn’t anger Steve then the careless way Tony slammed into one of the hallway doors to push it open did it.
The bed big enough to accommodate both Steve and Tony and maybe even natasha. There were three more beds in the room, a couch and a lot tech to keep Tony occupied.
He bumped into nat on his way up “you took him for a run? Steve the kid collapsed a week ago from exhaustion “she said her tone edging on dissatisfied and he shrugged
"Tony.." I waited patiently for the five seconds it took for him to actually look up, I ran my hand through his messy hair, and let my thumb stroke his ear trying to calm him down.
“Here , this is so you can fly better” natasha said as she clipped the little pulse oximeter onto the finger of his extended arm. He immediately retracted the arm back
Thankfully he reached for the one with shoes first, god knows what his reaction would have been if he had opened the underwear first. He pulled the box out and held it up frowning at him
“happy birthday, tony" he whispered against his lips and kissed him once he stopped ggiggling.tony buried his fingers in Steve’s hair tugging on them and Steve pulled away looking at him
He had made the choice for them, that was the thing . Even though tony had said he wanted it , steve knew he had no idea what he was asking for. Steve had made him cry and the evidence was still there on Tony’s face as he slumbered.
“I am sorry" he whispered again as he peppered Tony’s face with kisses , gentle at first but getting more intense and finally captured his lips fiercely feeling Tony whimper beneath him from the intensity of it.
And almost as if Steve wasn’t thinking for himself he asked “what?” And Clint smirked at him raising an eyebrow before saying “they are horny teenagers, Steve come on man , keep up!”
“its your turn to do something for me" he said as he walked out of the room and into the kitchen area and Tony looked at him with inquisition.
“Yeah, it’s me buck.” Steve’s sigh of relief gave the all clear for the rest of the team to walk over dropping their stance.
Steve quickly made his way to the principals office, to request that he take the rest of the day off and that tony gets to too. Carrying the approved letters he then made his way to Bruce, to let him know and maybe borrow his car.
“how about we go to my place huh? It’s only a 15 minute drive. Is that okay?” he asked hoping that’s what Tony meant
“Tired?” he asked wondering if maybe both the run and the unexpected orgasm had overdone it for him. But Tony shook his head instead
“Okay" he sighed “first of all, don’t call me bud , that’s insulting” and Steve smirked as Tony glared at him.
“don’t touch  me” he said moving away as steve tried to reach out to him. He shifted sitting up on the bed , pulling the IV out and his feet landing on the floor. Steve threw his head back in frustration his eyes closed , taking in a deep breath  he asked “where are you going?” tony didn’t even look up ,he was searching for his shoes on the floor and gave up when he didn’t find them and got up anyway on his bear feet buttoning up his shirt.
"Okay, can you tell me what you are feeling right now?" Clint took over as Steve stared helplessly, worry getting the best of him.
"Tony! Let's go we are going to be late" tony was basically the epitome of showing up 'fashionably late' to everything. But I loved watching his face light up from the attention he received after making the perfect entrance.
”I am not calling stane. I am going to call Natasha okay? Take the shirt off ,come on. Is it as bad as last time?” He asked lifting the phone to his ear as it rang but didn’t take his eyes off tony.
“I should give you detention” he muttered and Tony smiled cheekily at him and Steve finally ran his hands through his freshly cut hair before leaning down to give him a kiss.
“don’t be mean, you know I suck at this" he said sadly and Steve looked down on him , a thought suddenly occurring to his mind that Tony was actually doing whatever Steve asked him to without actually put up much if a fight .
“Close your eyes” tony propped himself up on his forearms on Steve’s chest, looking at him smugly “what?” Steve asked
“Bruce! Nice to see you , how was your summer?” Bruce, smiled at him genuine and happy as he extended a hand for Steve to shake. Steve loved Bruce,the man was quiet and often kept to himself but what Steve liked the most about him was that he had a genius mind but that didn’t keep him from staying humble always. Bruce was the school’s favourite physics teacher and he even occasionally taught biology because he had had experience in the medical field before he started teaching.
“Holy shit, that makes sense. I think stane is planning to make Tony go down for the blame when he gets caught” he exclaimed
Tony mumbled against his lips and Steve pulled away a little to hear him “I am scared” he whispered and Steve put on a forced smile on his face because Steve not only scared ,he was terrified.
“Tony, I am not pointing fingers here and if it were anybody’s fault that Steve is currently facing this ,its his own. But -"
“Your clothes are dirty and I just washed the sheets” he told him rolling his eyes and Tony pouted at him batting his eyelashes.
“The cut you had yesterday, it’s not there anymore” he said , Steve was met with a look of pure curiosity and all Steve wanted was to tell him the truth. He shook his head slightly while tony lowered his hand down again
"Have a look at what I did!" he exclaimed as he backed up a bit. He motioned for Jarvis to start the jet on the boots to lift him up. And the normal orange bright colour of the jet was now burning bright blue.
The next morning, Steve sat at the front of the bus as the students settled in their seats as he messaged Natasha that they were leaving soon and was startled when someone sat down next to him.
"I can help you with this sweetheart, will you let me?" It took tony a second to understand what steve was implying and the moment he did he shook his head violently and Steve backed away a step.
“I am never doing this with you again" he told him as they finally reached the tower in comfortable silence , well as silent as it could be with Tony breathing hard and fast.
“You doing okay?” Steve asked once they were out of the room and Steve had carefully slid the door shut behind them .
“but why and how did stane get his hands on the tape?” tony raised a hand that was holding the spoon and  waved it around before saying
“I am mad, but not at you sweetheart. But we will talk later okay? You really need to get some rest" he said pulling Tony back down onto the couch careful not to jostle his ribs.
He was out of his chair in seconds and Steve laughed at him when feet got caught on the carpet and he fell and would have fallen face first if not for Clint who caught him by the back of his shirt which left him suspended a few inches from the floor.
Steve continued to stroke him through his orgasm “come back to me Tony” he said as he gently palmed his now soft cock ,just loving the weight of it in his palm.
What he didn’t expect though was to find that tony stayed seated even after he had dismissed the class and everyone else had filtered out. Steve didn’t know what to say, every conversation he had tried to have with this kid ended with tony only getting more angry with him. So he opted to stay quiet as he graded the papers the students had just submitted.
“Either you show me, or I am going to call your parents. You could be seriously-“ tony huffed out a laugh turning to face him
“I , well" his right hand went up to his chest above the sheets and he pointed to it, “the reactor is made of palladium and its slowly poisoning me apparently”
Steve had never even known that he should have questioned his relationship with Bucky. He found himself often having to wonder what if ? But ever since he found Tony  things had changed a lot, he hadn’t really been thinking about the others, bucky, peggy, the first time he was embraced by a man after being unfrozen.. , well he was thinking. A lot. About tony, but that was a good thing right?
"How long have you been like this?" He asked softly all traces of irritation anger drained from his voice, now only left with worry and concern.
Tony just rolled his eyes but Steve just wanted to steal one last kiss from him. He was leaving today after lunch, so this may as well be the last time he gets to see Tony before he leaves.
“Yeah I mean think about it, why would you change your clothes before bed when you address going to shower in the morning anyway.”
Tony had no idea the things steve would do for him, the moment he had found out that this was Howard’s kid, Steve’s world had turned upside down.
“I am going to call someone to come pick l-" Tony sprung so fast up off the wall that not even Steve’s serum enhanced reflexes could have expected it.
"Tony?" He started to sway and I immediately moved to grab him. He jerked away from me so fast, colliding into Nat who tried not to grab as she knew he was feeling betrayed and didn't trust anyone right now. But he was becoming more pale by the second and someone had to do something so I moved forward again very slowly bringing my hand up to caress his cheek .He let me this time still looking at me with the look of betrayal.
“Then why are you leaving for the mission?” Tony was smart enough to know something was up with Steve’s mind and Steve appreciated that.
“I I can't remember” steve sighed and Tony turned his body towards him ignoring everyone else in the room and reached out to Steve again
It took a lot longer than Steve anticipated to get to the  balcony that overlooked the training fields outside.
“Steve are you sure he doesn’t understand or are you just not believing him in trusting you that you won’t hurt him?” steve couldn’t look up to meet her eyes but she rubbed her thumb against the back of his hand.
“Okay. You are okay" he sighed speaking mostly to himself. He looked okay, other than being a little pale so Steve forced himself to focus on other things. Like how Tony’s lips, soft and warm was making it’s way up his neck.
“Huh" was all he could come up with, and this from the man who is always first to all the alien things happening around the world.
“Can I skip school tomorrow because ,you know” steve raised his eyebrows “I underwent trauma" he said.
“Don’t want to change?” Steve asked as Tony all but tucked himself under the comforter before Steve had even pulled out a change of clothes from his closet.
It had been two days since they had told tony about stane selling weapons under the table. He had taken it surprisingly well , but steve knew by now that Tony hid his emotions very well when required.
Tony did not agree it was funny as he picked up a pillow and smacked Steve with it repeatedly and Steve held up his arms in defence
“Why didn’t you wanna do it?” he asked as Tony finally broke out of his timidness clambering up to Steve’s side until steve was forced to wrap his arms around him .
“I will, take a shower and meet me in the sparring room in twenty. You need to let off some steam” she said and he nodded as he watched her go still calm but he knew she was shaken a little because steve had never lost control like this ever before. This was new to all of them.
“um I don’t think so” he started and they watched as bruce fisted his hands tightly “but I cried because I missed him because he died and then he came back and I didn’t understand what was happening" steve knew this already but the looks on natasha and Bruce’s face were probably exactly what he had looked like when Tony had tried to explain it to him.
“I finished it" he said but Steve knew he was lying and he briefly wondered when he had turned into this doting boyfriend
“you are not my father , you don’t get to decide what’s good for me and neither is Stane!” Tony was fighting hard to keep himself from crying , Steve could tell from the way his voice hitched between the last sentence.
The summer came to a quick stop as he pulled into the parking lot of the school , his motorcycle sporting a few new upgrades. He was in a way glad to be back at school, a few things he had honestly missed and one of those things was currently walking towards him as he waited at the front office for the lovely lady to hand over his schedule for the year.
“Not hungry right now” he mumbled and sneaked a quick look at natasha who was pouring Gatorade into a glass.
“what stev-" Tony immediately began but Steve cut him off “ I wont be here for the next five days. I need you both to please accommodate him. Is that a possibility?” he asked bluntly expecting the shocked ,curious looks on both their faces. He also expected Tony’s “what the hell?” look but again Steve just brushed it aside. Last night Tony had stayed at shield along with Steve and stane had not realized over the daze of the party. But Steve couldn’t leave on his mission knowing that Tony was going to be staying with stane without Steve being there incase Tony needed him. That thought scared Steve more than anything so he had stayed up all night formulating a plan but this was all he could come up with that he was sure he could convince Tony into sticking to. His other option was holding Tony hostage at shield, and he knew tony would not appreciate it.
“He really does take after him, sometimes I wonder how things would have turned out if they were not..” steve nodded his lips pressed in a tight line.
He nodded, albeit unsurely but there was something Bucky definitely recognized in him. He reached for the phone getting a closer look and gave it back to her.
He didn’t expect the anger and rage to show through on her face, she was usually very much in control but it was honestly very comforting to know that Natasha was on his side.
Tony pulled away from natasha and looked up at Steve tentatively not sure how Steve was going to react. But steve reached down, wiping the chocolate mustache Tony had and smiled warmly at him.
Steve stood for a moment , just looking at Tony’s face , his lips were slightly parted and Steve had put pillows on both his sides because he had a habit of tossing and turning in his sleep. He looked so small in the giant bed without Steve in it,. He leaned down and gave him a quick kiss on the lips and made his way to the shower.
Steve immediately wrapped both his arms around him pulling the rigid teen onto his lap and then picked himself and Tony off the couch. Tony sqwaked, grasping at the ice cream tightly.
Same Tony who has very strictly told Steve to stop hovering which included making sure he eats his food ,which by the way he was not doing.
He felt himself blush, he hadn’t done that in a while really. It was different with Tony,  he was the adult and Tony was the one doing all blushing. He didn’t mind as long as he got to see that on tony , but to think back the roles were reversed with peggy ,he didn’t ever think things would be the way they were today.
But Tony didn’t come out of the bathroom after ten minutes and Steve knew he was stalling so he turned the knob and entered without warning to find Tony on his phone leaning against the sink.
Just two days away, but was I glad to be home! Entering the tower, the first thing I wanted was to go see Tony. I really did not want to leave him since the anemia situation. But sometimes somethings couldn't be avoided. I hadn't even spoken to him yet after the battle, Bruce had called a while ago saying they were at the debriefing. I sighed unhappily, knowing that was going to take a while.
“tony, I need you to trust me on this okay? You are going to be just fine, I am going to stay here by your side the whole time , even when you are asleep. I know you are feeling vulnerable but I promise I will be here the whole time and nobody is going to touch you without your permission” Tony nodded against him , and Steve sighed pulling his legs down and lifting the gown.
Stane and whoever this Rumlow character was , were going to have tough times ahead steve thought as tony melted against him allowing Steve to carry most of his weight.
"Tony I don't think the problem is the party. I have watched you sitting here ever since you arrived and drinking the same glass of scotch for the past hour. Something is wrong, what aren't you telling me?"
“Hey" bruce said walking in and Tony shuffled closer to Steve as he noticed bruce was now wearing a white coat and looked more like a doctor than a teacher .steve couldn’t help but notice how stressed he seemed and only when natasha subtly put her hand on his shoulder did he seem to relax.
It was a strange thing to feel his organs drowning inside of him. Drowning from the inside out—that was what was happening. He could see his skin burning away, but couldn’t feel it. There was no pain, just the odd sensations of dying.
“Call Steve first, then we’ll talk about filming,” Tony said, cutting him off. He hung up the phone and unfolded his hand from the metal ball.
Steve sat on one of the cement stepping stones he’d made at craft class in the fall with a bunch of old ladies from the quilting store in town.
”Mr. Rogers!” Steve groaned internally turning towards the voice , giving a small wave as opposed to the excited one pepper was throwing at him. They made their way over to them , navigating the crowd like a pro,an unhappy, unimpressed tony being tugged along behind her.
He needs a haircut , tony was looking nothing like the sharp well dressed teen he had been when he first joined school off late ,but then again he had been through a lot in that time.
“Okay that’s fine, can you tell me what happened?” he asked as he gently reached for Tony’s ha d again and Tony didn’t pull away this time but actually held on tighter.
“is it still hurting? Honey are you okay?” he asked worried that if it was still hurting him then it was something serious after all and that he should have taken Tony to an actual doctor.
“Bucky, do you remember anything at all? Is someone controlling you, can you give me a name?” Steve asked sitting just out of reach from his flesh  arm. They had ripped the metal arm off, just in case and tossed it away from the reach of him.
That wasn't too high right? I snuggled closer to him and let myself fall back asleep vowing to get him some Tylenol for the fever once he was awake.
He kept talking as the nurse worked. She worked with good efficiency and had the tube out in less than two minutes even with Tony writhing in his arms.
“He is young and healthy otherwise. Just needs a little supervision in the area of staying healthy” the man said and Steve hundred percent agreed. From the time since they had become close Steve had learned that Tony had very little regard about his own health, a never care attitude that Steve was happy to intervene time after time. Somewhere along the way he had also realized that Tony was always going to be so much younger to him, and he would never get over the need to take care of the boy. He had accepted it, he just hoped that Tony wouldn’t get tired of it sometime in the future.
“yeah, he was having a hard time, but Dr.Brandon was there and we had things to over see.“ Steve nodded ,as he pointed to the papers
“get some sleep Steve, we will take watch. There is still another three hours atleast before we know anything” he said just before leaving the room.
“He is a smart kid, how would they hide that" natasha aasked and Steve realized that they were also still speculating
"no, no I can walk " I woke up feeling groggy and tired . Maybe Steve carrying me is not such a bad idea.i got out of the car with Steve's hovering over me(wait, why were there two of him?). He said something to happy and turned towards me "one foot in front of the other, come on" he was practically supporting most of my weight already and I was so tired, I sagged further into his hold. He stopped in the common room dragging me into a more upright position and ran a hand through my hair waking me up again "Did you eat anything at the party?" he asked me suddenly doubtful.
“Hey kid,” she said and tony frowned reaching a hand up to rub the sleep out of his face and steve was glad he hadn’t heard any of their conversation.
"Hey! What is going on here?" He asked firmly as Tony tried to push Steve's hands away to get to Ty. Steve glared at him until he calmed down but didn't back away. He kept an arm firmly against Tony's chest as he turned to glare at Ty. He looked even more smug if that is even possible making Steve want to roll his eyes at the overly smug teen.
“He needs to eat something” he told her as she pulled out the needle and Tony calmed down a little finally allowing Steve to take care of him. Steve was still unsure if Tony knew what was going on around him and he sat Tony half upright pulling the throw over him .
“-eve" no wonder Clint said no to this mission. Damn that hurt Steve thought as he finally was able to bring his arms up to his face run the weariness away. He’s been wanting to do that since a week now.
“Stop it Steve.” He groaned pulling back from him  and then took his face in his hand a squeezing it. Steve looked at him , not sure where this was going.
Just as I finished my curry, Steve entered again, and dropped two pills in my hands in exchange for the plate. He didn't say anything about it or about me forgetting it. Just handed it to me casually and walked away with my plate to put in the dishwasher. I put them in my mouth, and washed it down with rest of my orange juice.
The actual scare came during the clean up process (who knew the clean up would be more Dangerous than the battle itself) when an unstable building came crashing down on steve and thor before they had time to escape. Steve had a concussion and a broken wrist amongst more bruising and cuts while thor escaped with relatively fewer injuries the major being a three inch cut over his temple. It took four people and a clint to get Steve’s unconscious body onto the stretcher and to the hospital where Bruce was waiting for them. Bruce was usually the go to doctor for the team, it was easier to let their guard down in front of him and everyone understood that and no one questioned it until it was absolutely necessary.
“I just came back from a mission and found him sitting here staring at the food" Clint said pointing to the plate of untouched food.
He felt Tony push harder at his hands “wait they all know we are here?” he asked craning his neck away from Steve’s searching lips.
Nat,very sneaky indeed. I grumbled some more before I reached over and stole Bruce's as he gave me mildly irritated look but didn't seem to mind.I ate my muffin in peace and tried to quickly get away from Steve's 'eat your salad!don't make me hold you and force it down'.
“show me what? Did someone hurt you? What happened?” Steve knew she was very good at what she does and one of the requirements of being a spy was to be able to read situations and people well. So it didn’t surprise him at all that she had already figured it out, it was one of the reasons he called her.
“I am pretty sure they got some work by fury, which reminds me natasha said she will get you some files she said you might think will be interesting from her previous missions" he said as he rummaged around the cabinet out of Tony’s sight and pulled out the very cleverly hidden Foley’s catheter and IV lines.
“Its okay for you to worry about me but it’s not for me to worry about you?” he asked his eyebrows scrunching forming cute worry lines across his forehead.  Steve smoothed the lines with his thumb
“Well, the doctor said you can leave after you have had a quick nap” now Steve received a glare but he just shrugged at Tony and said “not my words, if you wanna leave you have to sleep for a while"
“Excuse me?” Steve said trying to play dumb , and Tony gave an exasperated look before reaching up gently running his finger across Steve cheek where the cut had been just three days ago.
“Right, so before we begin the lecture for today ,I was hoping we can learn a few things about our new student here” Steve said pointing to Anthony who looked slightly uncomfortable, but quickly composed himself smiling at everyone and stood up.
Steve took it from him turning it over in his fingers you will attach it to your underwear, in case they strip you.” Steve nodded,  embarrassment long lost regarding these matters.
He spent the next few hours going through the files that Clint had brought over while discussing it with the spies. Natasha had come over with dinner and they had made good use of their time.
“Ms. Potts why don’t you head out and let natasha know that Tony is going to be okay? And ask her to bring us a water bottle in a little while, yeah?” he said and pepper immediately said
He got a very good view of Tony’s perky ass he walked on his tip toes like he didn’t want to make noise and Steve chuckled at him as he practically ran back to the bed seeking the heat.
Steve had a few more questions, those regarding Howard's will and ofcourse one that's been plaguing his mind was why Tony hadn't told anyone about the abuse. But he figured this was a good start and didnt want to push his luck.
“no I don’t, and I don’t need meds because I am not in pain” Steve sighed , giving in for the moment and dropped the sandwich and soda on Tony’s lap.
"my heart rate sensors recorded during the night tells me captain Roger's did not actually sleep at night, but was just lying in bed with you sir." I groaned knowing exactly why he did not sleep. He would have stayed up all night worrying about the arc reactor failure.
“I need a little time to sort some things out in my head, I am afraid that I will snap again like I did yesterday and I don’t want to do that to any of you.” Tony gulped pulling his hands away
“ I am not going and you cant make me. Why do you even think I need one?” steve sighed wanting to give up
He had expected him to keep arguing but something shifted in his emotions suddenly and Tony leaned closer to Steve seeking comfort from him for the first time as he only just realized the full extent of what had happened with him.
“who asked you to be all sweet to that girl , because of you I didn’t watch the stupid ball coming at me" he said haughtily
“I need a moment" he said getting up and walking to bathroom to wash his face. He was snapped out of his thoughts when natasha walked in while he was toweling dry his face.
“It will happen Tony, be patient” he said and Tony sighed but Steve didn’t miss the way his shoulders relaxed.
“Tony, it’s going to be okay” he said as he felt Tony shiver and he picked him up ,laying him down on the bed. He refused to let go of Steve,  so he sat down as well next to him.
“you had major surgery Tony,  what exactly do you expect me to do here?” now tony really scowled unhappily , it was obviously not the answer he was wanting but expecting.
“No, nothing regarding that. But he did say the better the education I get the better the chances are that I will become a great CEO.” He said his chest puffing out just a little bit  in a show of pride.
“I have to finish this Steve, just wait for a second" okay steve was seriously confused now , he thought tony was tired enough to actually sleep through the night.
he walked back and forth a few times trying to calm himself down enough to face tony again. The door opened , Natasha walking out shutting the door closed softly behind her. Steve really envied her, he wished he could control his emotions as well as her.
He had a little while before the doctor would come in to check on him and Bruce too. He didn’t know if Tony had spoken to bruce yet but it didn’t matter Steve had decided last night.
"Bruce you know it's unstable, you saw what it did to my reactor" Tony said as they both walked into the room.
“you are not guilty here , because you didn’t do anything wrong. You didn’t fucking rape me Steve! it was all consensual!" Steve flinched hard at the word but it looked like it affected tony more than himself.
Steve got to enjoy the hot food for all of ten seconds before the static of the screen sounded and the man himself showed up on screen angry as ever.
“It’s a minor injury and I will be fine. I am also hungry” she said pointing towards the general direction of the kitchen with her thumb and Tony jumped
“Shh, sweetheart I promise we will get it out. Don’t cry , hey its gonna be okay" as he said that natasha came in followed by a very distressed nurse and Steve could have only guessed what she would have threatened her with to bring her here.
He was completely out of it, only aware of Steve’s presence but not his ministrations as Steve wiped him down, and then pulled his cheeks apart gently to check for any tears and then wiped around it. He whined as Steve ran the cloth over the puffy red hole and Steve shushed him still talking to him calmly.
"It doesn't happen often" steve froze his fingers momentarily stilling in Tony's hair. He forced himself to resume carding his fingers as Tony put the bowl down next to them and seemed to cower into steve.
“do you know how two men have sex?” Tony recoiled but didn’t give an answer and Steve continued taking that as a no.
“We are at gastro pub on 99th" she said and Steve sighed in relief  it was only a quick ten minute drive from shield.
“tony, look! you are gonna love this!” I said hoping off the Bed heading towards him. He looked up ,saw the Band-Aid and his face lit up as he grinned ear to ear. “I want black widow!” he quipped to the nurse as she waved him over to the bed I had just vacated.
“is there a reason you are giving me the silent treatment?” he asked and bent down to give him a kiss on the cheek.
Tony whined again unable to close his legs because Steve had them trapped and Steve slowly inched his hand down along his faint happy trail the fine hair becoming coarser as he went lower. Tony was mostly bare , and Steve loved it , his skin pale and his cock perfectly pink at the head.
“tony, he was under some kind of influence , he would never hurt you or your parents otherwise and I know that it doesn’t make it okay but I want you to know that part of the reason I gave you this,” he said tugging on buckys dog tag “is because if you are ever afraid of him, if something happens and you have this I am positive that he wont hurt you, because he knows how much you mean to me.”
“We will talk about it in a while , are you feeling better?” he asked again and tony nodded suppressing a yawn.
“It will hurt, but in a good way" he told him and Steve was not prepared to answer his next question when he asked-
We decided to have a movie night, since clint had shield business for the next few days and Natasha and Myself had to go to shield, The training program was a success so Fury wanted to make it a weekly affair. Except this time they had to go to a different shield base. They were going to be gone for two days.
“you are not my father, you don’t get to decide what’s good for me and neither is obie” Steve knew he was exhausted and these arguments were only last threads he using to hang on. But he was failing miserably and Steve hated taking advantage of them in this state.
“Its fine , Steve. We will speak to him soon enough. But where is he now?” Clint asked again and Steve realized he had zoned out in his thoughts.
“You have fun?” he asked as Tony removed shoes and socks dropping them on the floor carelessly and crawling onto the bed.
“nothing happened though, I didn’t let anything happen. I left before anything could" steve sighed ,the chill forgotten he threw the blankets aside and pulled Tony to him who came with no resistance .
“tony, do you want us to remove the restraining order against stane so you can see him?” that was somehow something Tony had not been expecting, he let out a short whine tugging his hand out from under Steve’s fingers
“How long was I out?” he asked nat his movements sluggish as he readjusted his grip on Tony only then realizing the shower had stopped.
He stood there in the middle of the room holding his lover waiting for the tears to come , but they didn’t instead tony turned his head and Steve felt the press of warm lips against the exposed skin of his neck.
Steve pulled away just slightly, their lips barely grazing “I want you to understand,  that I am not going anywhere. Do you hear me?” he asked and felt Tony nod against his lips “good" he said before kissing him again. He bit Tony’s bottom lip hard enough to draw blood and Tony whimpered beneath him before giving in completely and crawled over his books into Steve’s arms.
Steve stopped him with a weak smile and a shake of his head. “No, I’m glad you let it out. I didn’t realize that’s how I came across. If you love science and math like you father, than I’m all for it. I want to support you in whatever you do.”
A Lamborghini and a Ferrari pulled into Steve’s gravel driveway, one bright yellow, the other bright red. Both Tony’s.
“You don’t have to thank me,” Steve said with a sigh. “I hope you didn’t think I was just going to leave you there to die or something.”
Steve’s breath came out in a shudder, like he was going to sneeze. Then he clamped his mouth shut, nodded once, and hurried from the dining room like a child, straight into his bedroom.
A ring. Tony had a wedding band on his finger, and Steve had to assume that Steve had one too, though his left hand was around Tony, at his back. He swallowed hard, unsure of what to say, what to ask. He didn’t want to make Tony retell a story that was bound to cause him pain, but…was Peter here? How old was he in this universe? How had he come into Tony and Steve’s life here?
“Eyelash,” Steve explained as he reached up. “You rub your eyes more and you’re gonna lose all of those pretty things.” He gently wiped the lash from Tony’s cheek, and shared a kiss with him once it was gone.
“That was wrong, but I thought it was best at the time. All of the pain all at once, except I’d be there to help you through it.”
Steve felt hollow, his only feeling coming from the warmth of Tony’s body heat. “I’ll do whatever Peter wants. He doesn’t have to stay here anymore. I don’t want him to stay here if he feels like a prisoner.”
“How are we looking for the afterparty?” Tony asked, running a finger along his most recent armor. He rubbed the dust between his fingers as he continued up the stairway.
Blaine didn’t say anything for a moment and Steve could feel the heat of the distant explosions as the compound burned. He dimly remembered the emergency backup plan. Even though they were expendable, even though they could be replaced, the military took care of its own. They made sure their boys came home, even if it meant burning cities to the ground.
Tony unexpectedly grabbed his wrists, bracing against Steve as Francine illuminated glass shards in red with some kind of light. If a toddler had been running around this penthouse, Steve supposed security precautions for this kind of thing were probably in place. Probably too many, because between Tony and Steve, overprotective would be an understatement.
He hated the look of pain that came to Tony’s face, but he knew it was the right decision. He would immediately feel attached to the kid, and he didn’t need that clouding his decisionmaking right now.
Tony let out a snort, something close to terror in his eyes. “I don’t know.” He swallowed hard. “Something terrible.”
The punch hit a nerve and the man spasmed, crumpling to the floor. Steve sucked in a breath, his eyes wide, but he could feel a smile on his lips.  He dropped to his knees on the man’s back and pulled the UMP-45 from the man’s holster and held it to his head.
“Daddy’s fine,” Tony assured her, crouching both to avoid Steve and make sure Morgan could see he wasn’t lying. “No need to be nervous, okay?”
Just as before, so long as he breathed and walked around pretending that things were going to get better, nobody would care.
Rhodey chuckled. “I just mean I don’t want to see you hurt when you could have prevented it in the first place.”
But he had a hard time imagining this Tony doing something like that. It was selfish, maybe, but this Tony would cherish him. Make sure never to let him go. There would be no mistaking any of Tony’s actions for ones indicative of a man falling out of love.
With a warning glance at Thor, Tony took a careful sip to find that the taste of wine wasn’t there, just something like gritty juice.
“Listen to me,” Steve said, firm but gentle. “I’m not going to let you leave here thinking whatever you’re thinking. Just hear me out.”
Blaine set two beers down on the table and a basket of some sort of fried bar food. Probably an attempt to please the young American tourists crawling all over this place.
Steve reared back, the only thing stopping him from running inside and slamming the door was the fact that Peter had spoken to him. His mouth opened and he flicked his gaze from Tony to Peter, as though he’d just been caught stealing.
They all knew that most of them weren’t going to make it. The officials hadn’t said anything about it, but they knew. Machine guns and heavy weaponry lined the beaches, and mines were presumably littered all over the sand. Mortars would be shot and they would be shelled relentlessly. So many men were being sent on this mission that Steve was sure they expected high casualties.
“Not yours to share anymore,” Tony grunted, forcing himself up onto his elbows. He sank his teeth into the join of Steve’s shoulder and neck and sucked hard—a sweet spot that rendered Steve absolutely helpless against all better judgement.
“How long have you been living here again, Steve?” Jackson asked, turning a little to look at him over the back of the chair.
“It’s just what I wanted. Quiet, plenty to do if I decide to go into town, and a great view all year round,” Steve replied as he handed Jackson his water and Tony his orange juice.
Steve faltered. He regretted the way Tony had come to find out about his parents’ deaths, but he still didn’t regret allowing him those years of peaceful ignorance. Telling Tony would have destroyed so much in him…but of course, it ended up destroying those parts anyway.
“I had a dream about a babysitter who didn’t show up,” Tony said, instead of asking. He told himself it was because he knew better, but it was really because he didn’t know what he’d do if Steve rejected him now.
Steve looked up as Iron Man’s scans started appearing all over his desk surface, depicting a creature that resembled a crab, except it could fly an spit molten acid that could melt school buses. Iron Man’s AI program was scanning everything it could to try to locate weak points, but this creature was different than the ones that they’d faced before.
risk her, Steve. If you left me, if the media caught wind and turned on me, game over. I didn’t want to hide it, I didn’t want to hurt you. But I had to do whatever I could to get her.”
Bucky reluctantly pulled back and gave Steve’s shoulder a rub. They locked eyes and Steve was so tempted to look away, but managed to hold the stare.
Steve turned his gaze back to his ex-husband, watching as Tony propped himself up with one arm, hair filled with sand, utterly bewildered. But Tony’s brain was working again, and within five seconds, Steve could see that Tony remembered how they had gotten here, where “here” was, and who was there with him.
He was fine. Truly. Steve smiled and laughed, he had a good time at parties and went to lunch with his friends. He found value in his life, his career, his community. Happiness didn’t evade him. He was happy. If anyone were to ask him, he could truthfully say he was a happy guy. But that didn’t mean
“Oh, Peter, it’s all right,” Steve soothed, hugging Peter a little tighter. “Just keep me updated, okay? Maybe we can grab lunch sometime during the summer and you can tell me everything that’s happening.”
“Let’s go to bed,” Steve said after a moment. He realized after he said it that he hadn’t replied to Tony, but he was just that tired.
Steve bristled at his desk, but said nothing. If he had truly gone above and beyond, wouldn’t Tony be sober now? If he had truly been a great husband, why was his husband still more interested in drugs and alcohol than him?
The first word Peter had said while Steve played with him alone on the kitchen floor. The frustrated look and puffy pink cheeks and the very loud “poh-t” that had him laughing for five minutes before he called Tony.
Steve met his eyes, not needing to examine too closely to see that Tony was telling the truth. This didn’t seem to be a ploy. “This have to do with the article?”
The metal of the Quinjet wing groaned above them in the force of the wind. Tony chewed the inside of his cheek, glancing around their shelter.
“I know,” Steve soothed. “I know you didn’t mean to. That’s why I never minded. I saw that it really stressed you out when I didn’t tell you.”
“Okay, okay. My bad.” Tony rested his forehead against the dip in Steve’s collarbone, taking a breath. “But can we at least make out on the couch for a bit? Please?”
That was when his heart started pounding. All of the emotions that should have been hitting him already were attacking him all at once—pride, hurt, anger, confusion—and he had no idea what to do, no idea how to fix it. Because he did want this. Of course he wanted to be locked up in an art classroom with Steve Rogers staring at him through fake glasses that somehow made him even more attractive. But it wasn’t supposed to be like this. He couldn’t just…accept what Steve had done.
Tony paused, turning to him. He was a sucker for reverse psychology, what could he say. “Oh yeah? Not up to task?”
“Can I at least get your name?” Maria asked as Steve escorted her down a hallway, firmly gripping her by the elbow. She kept looking around and it made him nervous.
They rounded a corner and Steve lifted his rifle, firing at three oncoming guards. One after the other, they fell to the ground, no match for the practiced accuracy of two operators.
“We were young, Steve. Fifteen years ago. You know how much I’ve learned in fifteen years?” Tony shook his head. “You were never coming back, just say it.”
There was no end for him, he realized. This torture would continue for the rest of his impossibly long life, even after Tony was six feet under. To have earned that love only to lose it—only to have the one prize he valued most in the world ripped away from him was beyond what devastation could describe.
“We didn’t know it, but Tony took matters into his own hands. He found out he could target the dimension technology to bring things from other dimensions. Namely, various Steve Rogers’.” Rhodey sighed. “I found out about the third one when he broke into the lab. He was insane. Our dimension was so radically different than his that he lost it—we introduced him too fast.”
Steve, who was quickly realizing that he shouldn’t be here. That this wedding wasn’t something he was supposed to attend. “Oh my god, Tony, I…”
But now he had someone else to focus on. A little girl with dark hair and eyes just like his. Same long eyelashes too, and probably the same brain. Except, you know, without the alcohol poisoning. For a kid who’d grown up in foster care, she was a wildly happy toddler who saw every remotely sharp object in the penthouse as a personal challenge.
Steve looked at him, scanning Peter’s face for some hint that he understood whom he was talking to, but there was no evidence that Peter knew at all.
“Pops—Pops, we’ll be fine. We probably won’t wake up until noon anyway, like you said,” Peter said. “I haven’t slept in like two weeks and neither has Harry. We just got done with class two days ago.”
“I think so,” Steve said, rubbing his temples. Exhaustion clung to his eyes, and he longed for Tony’s bed, the fluffy comforters and the soft pillows, and the scent of Tony’s impossibly expensive laundry detergent.
Being in Bucky’s hold had once felt like safety, but now he felt constricted and pinned down. But this was Bucky, so Steve just hugged a little tighter to try to force the feeling away.
Steve had no recollection of that morning. He raked his mind to see if there was any time he could have woken up and noticed anything different. He couldn’t recall. But love was blind, all of that.
Steve fought the urge to scoff. How dare Tony come in and act like Peter was some kind of nuisance. He had probably waited to come home just so he didn’t have to interact with Peter and they could just fuck.
They didn’t even want wedding presents. They had asked for donations to charity instead—all of which would be matched by the newlyweds.
“I wanted to see what you were doing after the reception,” Steve said, his voice weak. “I wanted to get dinner with you and catch up. I haven’t seen you in seven months, Pete.”
Tony swallowed hard. He was going to have to make calls.  Lessen the damage of this blow somehow. Steve wouldn’t be able to take it. If any of the stuff Peter had just said came out in the inevitable argument Steve would put up…Tony had no idea what that would do.
Steve scowled. “Right. That doesn’t change that it did happen this way—that you chose for it to happen this way. You’re still in the wrong.”
Blaine glared at him for a second before he returned to shooting. “You got your ass chewed up by dogs, then I saved your chewed up ass and dragged you to cover.”
“Daddy’s gonna be here in five minutes,” Steve told Peter, trying to settle the excitement building within him. He set his duffel by the door and stacked Peter’s on top of it, collecting his son in his arms. Peter liked to feel tall when he held the shield.
“But really, they don’t put you out in the field anymore?” Tony asked. “I thought you were doing all kinds of, y’know, missions and stuff.”
Jackson probably knew that absolutely nothing was going on for the Avengers right now, but he was too nice of a guy to say anything. And he probably wanted Steve gone even more than everyone else.
“Iced latte,” Tony repeated, tapping on the granite of the bar. He turned to face Steve, same charming smile. “Keeping it simple this morning?”
Tony wiped his brow with a towel and sat up from the creeper before giving his son a look. “Are you breaking up with Mary Jane?”
His blanket puddled around his feet as  he peered into the empty workout rooms, but he saw no bags or equipment that suggested a visitor had come to train here.
“C’mere.” Bucky pulled him in for a hug, and Steve happily returned it, patting Bucky’s back before pulling away. He reached up to ruffle Bucky’s hair, but Bucky beat him to it with the metal arm. Steve doubted that was an accident.
Except his life had always revolved around Tony, ever since they had defeated a hoard of aliens trying to destroy New York. His new life had almost always had Tony in it, either on the sidelines checking in with a text or two once in awhile, or the weeks they spent together poring over missions and projects until one day Steve finally just asked him out to dinner.
He wondered if Jackson had ever read it. Probably not, since Jackson had stuck it into the things to send.
Tony was the same too. His furniture was still in all the same places, his clothes in the same dresser, and all of the same suits in the closet. They weren’t men who changed. It was a blessing as much as it was a curse, because never changing meant never forgetting.
Tony grinned. “Thankfully, the bar is pretty low. Hold my hand, maybe a kiss on the cheek if we really want to get them going.”
Was there too much silence going on? Steve swallowed, wondering if he should take another bite of oatmeal so Tony would know he was eating and that was why he wasn’t saying anything.
Blaine rolled his eyes and Steve forced himself to laugh, bridging the negative space between the dusty, abandoned pathways in his brain that told him that the joke was funny, that it was okay to laugh.
And even after Bucky had forged his signature on his Christmas cards, not one of his friends had called to ask about him. Nobody even knew he was half a world away from New York, about to kill a man.
Unless…Tony blinked as worry began to creep up. Had he missed something? A parent-teacher thing? He’d only met Morgan’s main teacher once, but they used a new teacher every other class. She’d been a kind older woman with small glasses and a big smile. She looked about as safe as he could have imagined.
Steve kept an eye on their corners as they moved down the hallway, looking out for any signs that hostiles were nearby. Blaine moved and Steve turned to engage on instinct, reading Blaine well enough to know he was about to shoot.
But even as Steve tangled his fingers in Tony’s hair and they bounced from wall to wall in the hallway toward their bedroom, shedding their clothes, Steve found himself not really paying attention.
Divorce was an ugly, slimy thing. Steve had known that going in, but no one had ever said that the same slime that kept him up all night before court hearings about custody and denying Tony’s alimony crusted into a paste that was impossible to remove. Just like superglue smoothed over fingertips for criminals looking to avoid leaving prints, nothing ever seemed to grab hold to him anymore. No new friends, no new numbers in his cell phone.
That, and his body was starting to feel strange. He began to lose feeling in the arm where the new blood was coming in, and the numbness started to travel his body. When he tried to test the restraints again, only some of his body worked.
just thinks I’m only around to create a scene. I went to my ex’s wedding three years ago. Talk about a mistake. Everyone thought I was there to try to ruin the ceremony.” He shook his head slowly, his eyes glazing over a little as he thought about how low he had gotten, how miserable.
Tony had to love him still. Steve could not imagine a human being loving another the way Tony had loved him, only to have it suddenly go away. Not without something traumatic. Not for no reason other than ‘we don’t work’—yes, that had been Tony’s reasoning. Leaving Steve to flounder in the dark, his heart still full of love and affection that had to grow stagnant and bitter. Ferment into something that was once vivacious and life-giving into something he could get drunk off of in the dead of night when he needed warmth and morphine.
She shook her head. “We’re done for the day. As much as we should be practicing while you’re distracted, you should go see Tony.”
“Because I share his pain.” She swirled her wine in its glass. “How terrible it must be to know that you will be the one to leave first. That there is no other way. To carry that weight each day, to build something so beautiful and know that you will be the one to destroy it. Would you not want to fall from the cornerstone rather than the peak?”
"Bruce and Natasha are waiting for us in the common room" I said to him and he visibly tensed when he realized that we had already discussed this behind his back. "Clint and thor will join us in an hour for dinner" I continued as the elevator opened and we stepped out.
By now natasha was watching the two intently, looking for signs of distress and so she caught the reaction even if it was subtle when she mentioned stane coming for Tony.
“Cap, we need you for debrief” he groaned as he heard clint and sighed looking at the time on the screen of his phone. He was surprised to see that he had slept through the night and it was already eight am the next morning. This never happened with him, he was always so diligent , he was slacking off and that set an irritation within him he couldn’t seem to stave off.
“She means, that Tony has only ever had one father figure in his life and that has not been a good relationship. He took to tasha so quickly because he doesn’t expect her to betray him in anyway because he doesn’t know what to expect from women. But when he sees you, he sees someone older than him, and he trusts you . If you give him a reason not to, then he will learn to never trust anyone again.”  Steve gaped up at Clint as he walked in his shirt wrinkled and his hair ruffled every way.
“he will be just fine, this happens a lot" she said reassuring me. I suddenly remembered the camera man, looking up I saw him being ushered out by clint. That was good, because tony wouldn’t appreciate this being floated around in the media.
“Steve! Looks like we are back in this hell hole huh?” Bruce said sitting down at one of the cafeteria tables putting down his tea and I joined him with a coffee.
Tony was on his knees , gasping for air his fingers clutching at the collar of his shirt . A layer of sweat covered his forehead and his hair was sticking to it.
"I want to see this project done by friday and don't forget this will be counted for your finals" groans went around the room as Steve finished his class. He was actually in a good mood today considering he was up all night looking into a mission Coulson had sent him. He had handed it over to steve personally , requesting that he keep it hushed and when he saw the object of the mission he understood why.
“It might be a really good idea, but it’s too early. Besides Clint nobody would take toyr seriously in the corporate world" Clint huffed faking offense. It was true, clint couldn’t go too long without being playful. It was how he dealt with stress.
"Good morning sir, Captain rogers has asked me to remind you of your morning iron pills, If you turn to your left you will find them on the nightstand." Oh joy!
“Shall we take a walk then?” he asked as he washed his hands again and dried them on the hanging towel.
“He’s fine, doing better. Woke up last night but he insisted we let you sleep.” Clint said knowing he needed to give him an update about Tony first.
He was also very angry with Steve about acquiring his birth certificate , well not so much so that they had acquired it but that everyone in his school knew that he was actually younger to them by a little more than a year.
Steve was walking back to his class his mind an absolute mess of everything Tony had just shared with him that he didn’t notice Bruce until he smacked straight into him sending the papers he was carrying askew.
He kissed the top of Tony’s head ran a hand against Tony’s back up and own. Tony slowly turned revealing his face again , Steve’s breath hitched as he saw the tears trickling down his cheeks.
"How are you feeling?" He asked as settled down next to the flustered teen who still seemed too rigid as he clutched tightly onto the ice cream bowl.
Tony was there, shaking his head at something pepper was asking him. He looked anything but okay, there was a paleness to his face that made Steve think he would pass out any second. His eyes were gaunt like he hadn’t slept all night and the crepe was gone from his hand, revealing the red and swollen wrist.
“Steve, I swear to God if you hurt that kid there will be red on my ledger again and I wont regret it this time.” He heard natasha her voice clear as ever as Clint stood behind her his eyes glaring at him eith an intensity that could slice through apples.
He held his sticky hand away and used the other to support him as he spoke quietly to him trying to get him more lucid .
His eyes scanned the dark room for the threat and he startled badly when he noticed something move only slightly on his right but his fear of self preservation turned quickly into need to protect as he realized tony was the one who had screamed.
“He’s not here,” Not-Tony said after a moment, his voice soft. “I’ll explain everything, I promise. But you have to trust me when I say you need to have lunch and get some rest right now.”
“What was that, all of two minutes?” Blaine laughed. “You’re too used to fighting inexperienced grunts, Rogers. The guys who know what they’re doing will knock you flat.”
He just wasn’t sure how to bring up his little problem. Or if it was even that big of a problem at all. Tony honestly felt like his feelings for Steve were shallow, and could evaporate at any time, yet another part of him felt like that wasn’t going to happen, that they might end up getting worse. After all, Steve probably didn’t like him to begin with. Actually, that was pretty much guaranteed.
“No, nothing out of the ordinary,” Clint replied, but he looked troubled. “I mean, mission’s in France, we fly out in two days. Intel extract, should only take three days or so.”
“Even if Steve hated your guts he would pick up that phone and you know it. Quit being a brat and call him,” Tony snapped.
“In case you forgot, we aren’t part of the military,” Blaine said. “That means we don’t get their care. You’re a certified medic, dumbass. We didn’t train you just so you can use your skills if you have no other choice.”
“C’mon,” Steve said, nodding toward the bed. “I don’t think it really counts as cheating if I sleep next to my boyfriend’s dimensional counterpart.”
“Goodnight, Tones,” Steve finally said, closing his eyes as another rumble of thunder shook the wing above them.
Tears pricked in Steve’s eyes just remembering how angry Tony had sounded. “My son and my ex husband don’t want me in the family anymore. I’m a selfish coward and I accept that. My son got engaged and didn’t tell me. He owns a company now and he didn’t tell me that either.”
He thought about abusing his power and checking Steve’s GPS signal. Just to see if maybe he was a block away, considering. But his therapist had warned him about that. Said it was sabotaging Steve’s trust.
Steve shook his head. He couldn’t process this here in Tony’s penthouse. Where baby things were now scattered around, carefully tucked away into little corners so they didn’t tip him off. Tony was still hiding from him, still keeping things.
When he caught sight of reddish skin, Tony made his way through the crowd yet again and tugged forcefully on Vision’s silky, gold cape.
Rhodey laughed, but the kind of laugh that meant he was absolutely going to bring a Cap doll. He drained his drink with finality, indicating their evening was coming to a close. That was just fine with Tony, as he could see Morgan’s eyelids drooping as she continued grinding his action figure’s face into the carpet.
The elevator doors closed before Steve could respond, and Tony pressed back against the wall of the elevator, letting out a big breath. Damage control. He definitely couldn’t see Steve at all tomorrow, not now. Dumb move.
“I didn’t think so many people would be interested in air and space,” Tony said with a sigh as he dumped his wallet on the penthouse countertop.
Steve Rogers was crouched on the floor, and Morgan was jumping to him. Jumping. Her little arms wrapped around his neck for a big hug, and Steve was laughing as his stupid fake glasses were knocked right off his stupid, pretty face.
Tony was getting married. To Jackson. Peter was going to have a stepfather almost as wealthy as Tony, with a humble heart and kind spirit unmarred by war like Steve’s.
“Yeah, and put him at risk. Not really worth it when he’s going to leave me when he finds out anyway.”
Steve remembered lying in bed with Tony, the way the morning sun had hazed through the windows. He remembered combing his fingers through Tony’s dark hair, talking about how they would grow old together. About how Tony would grow old and Steve wouldn’t.
Yes, was better if Peter hated him. Hating him was better than growing up with bruises and being frightened and abused.
Bucky shook his head and instead of replying, he just hooked his metal arm around the back of Steve’s neck and yanked him to his chest. Just like he did before the war. Before Steve had become some queer copy of the man Bucky had left behind in Austria.
“Was a fluke, I know,” Tony finished. “But we’re friends. And we were never that public about being together anyway. We could make it work, and in six months we call it off.”
“Everything happened very quickly, Peter. He got upset because there was something wrong with my invitation, but he was totally fi—“
“I need something to drink that’s a little stronger than pineapple juice,” Rhodey muttered. He opened his cupboard and pulled out a bottle of Grey Goose.
Tony. Tony, who had more grey in his hair every time Steve saw him. They had joked about grey hair many times over the years, and Tony had always pretended to loathe age. But he wore it well and he knew it. Though, obviously, Steve was the king. Steve didn’t look any older than maybe thirty.
“ you developed a pretty serious chest infection after you swallowed the water, by the time you fell asleep yesterday by my side , your fever was almost at 104 and it was obvious you were having trouble breathing. It scared the shit out of us all.” Tony chuckled as steve cursed.
“What’s going on?” he asked immediately concerned at the look on Tony’s face. Je looked extremely uncomfortable and his face was ever more flushed than before. His eyes snapped up as he heard Steve and he pulled the sweatshirt he had around his waist even closer like he was afraid of something.
“Think he has really burnt himself down" she said giving Tony a long glance before leaving the common room.
He reluctantly nodded “ I will need signed consent forms from the parents” he said waving Steve off with a smile and shake of his head.
“Not here,” he whined but Steve didn’t give in and quickly unbuttoned his pants and used one hand to lift his butt up so he could slide his pants down.
He quickly dried off , reached for his phone and called up nat who had promised him that Tony was in good hands but refused to tell him who.
“Debrief where? Is Tony okay?” he asked rushing to get up from the bed looking around for anything that could help him freshen up.
Steve walked with purpose before reaching out and pulling Tony back forcefully and turning him to face Steve. There were agents all around them and steve was getting more agitated the more they stopped to stare.
“When you were pulled out of the ice, we reached out to him, asking if he would be willing to transfer tony to your school. We argued that you could protect him but he refused to give in. He believes whoever knew Howard personally would know the first place to look for would be with you.”
“Actually I am sorry for pushing you , but honey are you alright?” he asked starting to worry a little as Tony’s face paled
“Uh huh, I’ll be there in twenty” steve was going to have a long night but first he needed to get a hot shower to relax his aching muscles and look less fresh out battle to not scare Tony further.
Tony’s fear often showed as anger, anger that he hadn’t yet learnt how to project so it often seemed like a stubborn childish mannerism and he knew very well where today’s fear was coming from.
“Nggg ah! Steve!” he felt Tony’s whole body shudder and arch forward  as he squeezed a nipple between two fingers and rubbed a thumb over the tip.
“tony ,hey look at me” Steve asked gently pulling on his hand to get his attention. He held up the letter to him “I got permission from the principal for you to go home for the day”
But Steve’s mind got confused when he didn’t see anything worse there and he gently cupped them, trying to feel for anything and then Tony whimpered suddenly his demeanor changing as he turned around and hid in Steve’s chest. Steve’s hand still holding his balls, and just as Steve tried to pull away , tony went rigid and spoke
“about thirty minutes, here give him to me , you need to get warm.” She said stepping into the shower and crouching down reaching for Tony. Steve clutched at him tighter for a second his mind telling him that he needed to protect Tony from the cold and the immense pressure of being underwater.
“Look steve I am flying!” steve felt helpless looking at him, worry and amusement taking it toll on Steve as he smiled back blandly at his lover.
“Canvas you wear around all day? Those  are not shoes.” Tony pouted and Steve kissed him ,because till date he hasn’t been able to resist.
“Right" steve said ducking just in time. He wasn’t so sure what he can do to actually make Tony’s recovery better, but the thought of Tony fighting the medical equipment around him scared him.
“just peachy” he rasped, obvious that his voice was rough from swallowing the water. Steve nodded at him knowing that the enhanced armor would pick it up and dove right back into the battle.
“I’ll ask nat to stay here tonight, will you be okay?” he asked a little softer after he looked at the devastation on Tony’s face. His eyes snapped up, pleading
“Because I love him bruce , I know that’s not enough of a reason but he was stuck in this illusion that stane had and rumlow had created about sex and I couldn’t let him believe that sex was a punishment.”
“Come here” Steve said lifting his left arm up so Tony could tuck himself closer to Steve because the second Tony caught sight of the sign that said avengers floor he looked like he might bolt any second.
Since the camera incident, they always made sure there were two men guarding him in the room. Steve didn’t know what changed but he was not complaining because really, at least he now had other people to look at than being all alone in that dreaded room.
“ better than you would think, obie even said if I think this school is really the best option for me then I can continue. I don’t know what you guys did but wow , thanks!”
“No, Steve what the hell?” Steve just shook his head at the others as their patience seemed to wearing thin
Tony shifted a little his legs trying to tangle in the sheets , but the catheter prevented it and Steve carefully straightened his legs out as much as possible and he settled again with a contended sigh that barely escaped his lips.
“obie isn’t home, can you stay?” he asked like he didn’t expect steve to agree but Steve actually didn’t have anything important to do
Tony leaned away from Steve’s hand, shuffled to his feet awkwardly glaring at Steve “why?” Steve rolled his eyes at him but pulled his hand back from the defensive teen
“On one condition, I need to know how bad that injury is” Steve was sure it was worse than he was letting on. He had felt tony push with all his might to get Steve’s hands off his midsection and it had been four days since it had happened. If it was still hurting , then it had to be bad.
“Woah hey , slow down!” he said as he was pushed onto the bed and Tony quickly crawled up next to him and all but wrapped his limbs around him tightly and held him there.
Steve had other ideas , he snaked one hand under the covers his hand wrapping around Tony’s ankle and pulled until Tony came out of the other side squawking.
“why are you telling me this now?” He had to give Bruce credit, he would have had no idea if he hadn’t just been told that Bruce had been in contact with shield. But he clearly didn’t know that Steve was shield.
“Are you not happy that I get to continue in this school?” he asked pouting but at the same time he looked a little afraid of what Steve’s answer might be.
“Can’t have a single lash out of place,” Tony grinned. He leaned in, pressing their lips together for a gentle kiss. “You ready?”
Rhodey swallowed. “Tony told you that the first portal went haywire. It did. We closed the portal, then created another one after some reevaluation. We decided to use the technology with the Infinity Stones to make sure our dimension was safe. Several stones were sent to far-off dimensions and lost. Then came the Accords, the war, and then Steve passed.”
The last thing he wanted was to put Tony and Peter on the spot like that, forcing them to look like they were grieving for all of the cameras. They would curse his name under their breath, for leaving them to come up with some sort of tribute to honor Captain America. To make up stories about a sad man with a dismal, uneventful life since thawing out of the ice. A man who had dragged everyone down who mistakenly came too close. Tony would complain to Jackson about how fucking awful it was to have to be in charge of handling the public’s mourning for his ex.
The rest of the day they were drilled on equipment, procedure, and a variety of skills. Days could be made up of survival training, bomb defusing, interrogation techniques, or stealth exercises. And then there were hours in simulations that ranged from hostage situations to assassinations—all of which were designed to test their decision-making and put them under extreme stress.
Steve stood up from the bed and went over to the vanity. Despite the frown he could feel all the way down to his toes, he looked completely normal. No bags under his eyes or red-rimmed lids. No evidence to the hole-ridden mass of pulp in his chest that might have once been a heart.
Steve hurriedly wiped his tears, hating himself for looking so pathetic in front of all of these people. Someone was probably tweeting a picture of it as he sat there looking like a complete idiot. The media would freak if a picture of him were to leak now. Some people thought he was dead.
Steve kept a hand wrapped around Blaine’s forearm and pushed himself to the limit. They had to make the fence. Blaine had to make the fence.
His heart twisted in his ribcage, flexing and pulling as though the already weak tissue there was splitting open again. It wasn’t supposed to hurt like this. Steve asking him out was a good thing. It wasn’t supposed to hurt.
The words clawed deep, cutting through his flesh like hot metal. His mind reeled, trying to process all of the pain at once and failing miserably.
“He didn’t just stop growing up after high school,” Tony cut when Steve didn’t respond. “Every time he’s needed something for college, he’s called me. Know why? Because you don’t ever reach out to help. You used to beg me for just a few more hours with him and now you don’t even put up a fight. He’s still your kid and now you want to push him on me? No way.”
Steve didn’t know what had changed in Tony, but it was welcome. The defensive insults had faded, replaced by hesitant kindness. Tony still didn’t completely trust him, but Steve got the feeling that it was only his pride getting in the way of that. Steve was playing his part without flaw. He had no chinks in his armor, nothing by way of media that could throw him under the bus. Everyone seemed to have stopped looking anyway. They were the couple they always had been.
“What are you doing here?” he blurted out. “What the he—” He stopped himself. There were children around, after all. “Explain.”
They found a gentle rhythm so that Steve could lazily explore all of Tony’s tastes without needing to open his eyes or lift his head much. Married kisses. Parenthood kisses. So tired but so full of love. Steve would never tire of the life they had created together, and even when Tony was gone longer than expected or too busy to spend much time with him, he knew Tony’s love would never fail. He knew whenever Tony did come home, he would make sure Steve knew how much he had missed him and how much he loathed that they had been apart.
But Steve hesitated, and Tony pulled back to get a good look at his face again. Something was off that he hadn’t noticed before, a look in Steve’s eyes he couldn’t read. But it was bad—definitely bad.
The guys tried to pretend they weren’t watching him as Peter went on to describe life with Tony, how fantastic it was to be part of the best clean-energy business in the world and all of the things they had accomplished together as father and son.
“Yeah, he’s a great dog. They aren’t allowed in the house when they’re wet though.” Steve motioned toward the door. “Go on in.”
The grungy carpet was slippery, and Steve fell onto his right elbow several times, the edge of the shield cutting into his flesh as Peter continued to scream. The muted grey of overcast sky was visible out the door window as Steve wrenched the door clean off its hinges.
Tony closed his hand around the cool metal sphere, shutting his eyes for a moment. Steve had to notice the kind of shit Peter was pulling. Tony just wished he could do something about it, but it was Peter’s life. He had no idea what kind of demon he had sold his soul to that made things turn out like this; Peter heralding him as the world’s best dad and Steve as…something else.
Steve frowned. He didn’t like that such a simple text made his insides churn with irritation. It felt like Tony was just trying to rub it in that he was still upset—undoubtedly exactly what Tony was doing. Some days, like today, it didn’t even feel like they were dating. If they even were anymore. They hadn’t been on a date in weeks.
“You take the dog, I’ll get the AK,” Blaine murmured, settling into the snow a little more. “We’ll go on your signal.”
“I agree. We don’t see many kids her age taking this experience as an actual mentorship in art—I mean, their little kids, of course they don’t—but she genuinely wants to learn.”
Several pictures from their relationship also scrolled through, photos of Steve and Tony laughing during interviews, holding hands at a charity event, and the world-famous photo of Steve in a vintage Dodgers jersey for the Celebrity Allstar game, hanging on the edge of the outfield wall while he gave Tony their first public kiss.
He hit the ground so hard he heard his bones break as he bounced along the dirt, skidding to a stop among earth on fire.
But it was also a place where Tony only existed in the form of spotty encrypted phone calls. Steve hadn’t seen Tony’s face in the flesh for two years, though he was fortunate (or unfortunate, as it was some days) to have such a high-profile husband that he got to see Tony’s face on magazines and TV quite often.
Tony paused his cranking at the connector for the oil pan, blinking for a moment. Questions about Steve usually only came up when Peter really just wanted to know how to bring something up with Mary Jane.
This feeling was a hollow version of the one he felt before. Before, an inkling of this feeling would prompt a kiss. The slightest whisper of this feeling would have him resting his forehead against Tony’s, sharing his breaths.
But Tony did have to pull away after several heated kisses, though he did so reluctantly. “Gotta get back out there, babe.” He carded his fingers through Steve’s hair, trying to fix it up a little bit. But it would be hard to hide the red of his lips where Tony’s teeth had been, the flush to his cheeks and that goofy grin. “Will you come home with me?” he asked, taking Steve’s hand as they left the art room.
He squeezed his eyes shut and clawed at his temples, fighting the growing urge to throw up yet another time.
“Pepper says I look daddish in this sweater,” Tony said, picking some fluff from incredibly soft cashmere. “What do you think?”
A simple order.  They were all waiting for it, the instruction had been given about a hundred times for a hundred false alarms. The group shifted, churning within itself like a sand pit, men falling back and coming forward, no one wanting to be first.
Tony rolled his eyes, but obviously peter couldn’t see that. “Sure thing. Just have them send a decent reporter, yeah? I don’t want to deal with some People Magazine shit.”
Steve slumped to the ground and leaned against his bed, making a quick decision to grab his pillow before burying his face into it to just cry.
It was strange that such an intimate action barely had any effect on him. They had really ended things badly, and Steve could feel that anger gnawing at his ribs even now.
Anger was quick to billow in his gut, a white-hot track that had been hollowed out over the last year to something so refined that even the slightest comment could start him into a screaming match. He still couldn’t look at Barnes, even if he’d resigned himself to the fact that
Steve’s dining room was entirely too small for five grown men to be sitting in, but he never had company, so he supposed it would have to do for the next few days.
“Thank you,” Steve said, ruffling his hair again. He navigated his phone and hesitated only a moment before clicking the “Allow Location” button.
Back on his feet, he noticed that the lights were back on, but something was off. It took a moment for Steve to realize why. He looked down at his hands, and they were…spotless.
Steve kept his gaze on his phone. He wanted to get up and yell at these people, but this was Tony’s day. He wasn’t going to make a scene and ruin it. This was Tony and Jackson’s wedding! It was supposed to be about them!
Of all the things Steve could bring up right now. Tony didn’t need to be put on the spot and asked if he still loved Steve Rogers. It was pretty fucking obvious to everyone that he did. Hell, Jackson even knew about it to some extent. Jackson at least knew that a divorce didn’t mean he’d stopped loving the man he’d been married to.
“I haven’t planned for anything involving you,” Tony returned with a bit of an edge. “I want you to stick around, but I won’t blame you if you go.”
He peered up at the route again, and took a deep breath when he spotted the Stark Plaza stop still in its same place. Thank god. Whatever was happening here, whatever year he was in, he was at least still in New York. Tony was still here, presumably.
His phone buzzed in his pocket and Steve glanced at Tony, who was facing away from him and presumably watching Jackson, just to make sure it wasn’t a call for the Avengers.
Something smacked against his cheek and Steve jumped back instinctively just in time to catch Natasha’s grin. Her boxing gloves were dangling from one wrist, swinging in the low light of the boxing gym.
But he had seen. The moment they had completed their task, how Tony had paused, how he had brought a hand to his heart for just moment, the way humans sometimes did upon realizing they were no longer wearing a piece of jewelry they always had on.
They both stared at the photo for a while, and Steve could remember clearly the joy he’d had in his heart that day. The way that kiss had tasted, the way Tony had laughed with so much happiness when Steve finally pulled away and the crowd nearly brought the place down all around them.
The sea was black as Steve started down the chain ladder into his boat. He remembered gripping so tight to the chains that his knuckles started to bleed from when the wind and waves caused the ladder to smack against the hull. There were loud, hollow booms when the boat hit the side of the battleship. Like a low, mourning bell.
Before he even realized it, Steve had hung up his phone. The color drained from his face and he staggered to the closest empty chair before putting his head in his hands.
he was when he was lurched from a nightmare. It was easy to forget that all of the righteousness and warmth and goodness that was Captain America was also a PR masterpiece. Steve was basically untouchable, but he was not perfect like so many believed.
Tony looked completely shocked when Steve finally did open his eyes again, and he realized dimly that it was probably because he’d slipped a ‘fuck’ into the conversation. It used to be that he only did that when he was especially upset, but now he was constantly surrounded by far worse profanity.
“See, it’s ridiculous, the way I think about you,” Steve said. “I still want to ask you if we can sleep together out here, and pretend it’s to stay warm.”
to,” Tony said before his teeth latched to Steve’s neck. He sucked there, gentle but firm until Steve could feel his skin darkening. He hated that it made him a little breathless.
“Ah, yeah.” Tony gave a little shrug. “Got it down to the post office this morning. Vision is kind of helpful for that.”
Tony stood abruptly, fists clenched tight at his side. “I had to make sure, Steve. I couldn’t mess this up.”
“Sorry, Bucky was calling. God knows he would have jumped on a plane and headed out here if I didn’t pick up,” Steve said.
Candice had almost kept him. Stolen him. She had made the mistake of mentioning that maybe she did want children and Steve had nearly thrown up he had gotten so scared. They had been waiting nine months for a son, over a year in total including planning and finding a surrogate. And Candice had dared to say she wasn’t sure.
“You hit your head pretty hard on the way down,” Steve told him, scooting a little closer. Yeah, maybe taking his clothes off hadn’t been the best idea. Though he was dry now, and much warmer than Tony appeared to be.
Steve lifted a hand and gave him a thumbs-up. A weak smile found its way onto his face. He would do this, and he would survive.
Steve scrambled to swim, to climb up and out of the depths, but boots landed on his shoulders, his head, his neck, forcing him back beneath the waves before he could so much as gasp in surprise.
Steve blinked, then remembered he’d put it in his pocket to find the address. “Oh, uh, yeah.” He propped the falcon on his knee and fished out his creased invitation, handing it over. “There you are.”
This was one of the moments where he was glad Steve had been gone so long. It wasn’t right, the way he felt sometimes, even if Steve had come out and said he liked dames just as much as he liked fellas.  Bucky remembered how he used to be with women and how damn good it felt to have a girl’s legs wrapped around his hips, but he hadn’t just been with women. He gathered that Steve knew that, more or less, though he never talked about it. A few times, it had come up. A few times, Steve had let something slip.
Steve twisted the pin of his grenade and pulled. He tossed it and there was a little hissing noise as the grenade’s rockets came to life. A red light blinked once and then it shot off.
“This just became a team problem,” Blaine said evenly. “I don’t know if you think you’re a good liar, but you aren’t. I don’t need details, but I need to know what’s going to trigger this so it doesn’t happen again.”
“I used to be so focused on my lab and traveling and saving the world and all of that, but now that nothing’s happening, I’ve realized how shitty it is here,” Tony continued, mostly ignoring Rhodey’s comment.
They didn’t say anything to each other as Steve headed for the wreckage, but he was conscious of every breath ghosting his chest, every place where Tony’s body heat warmed his skin. He was conscious of the eyes on his face, his jaw, the quiet sound of Tony’s lips parting with words that never came out.
Even as he pictured Tony doing the exact same thing to Iron Man, all of that was fading into the background of his brain with each expert stroke of Tony’s hand. He couldn’t find the will to be hurt or disgusted, everything just focused on his dick. It was horrible, and Steve knew that it would make him feel so much worse afterward, but even knowing that now, he couldn’t stop himself.
“I want you to fuck me this time,” Tony panted, spreading his legs. Steve nestled between them, grunting softly when Tony wrapped his thighs around his waist and squeezed.  Definitely high. Tony only ever let Steve fuck him when there were drugs involved or he came early and was too blissed out to be self-conscious. Tony thought of himself as weak when another man fucked him, but Steve didn’t give a shit. Though he had to say he very much enjoyed being the only man Tony allowed to do this.
“If you want to see any robots, you’ve gotta let me wipe it off,” Tony argued. Sometimes bartering worked.
Blaine tongued the inside of his cheek, thinking. “Okay, since we’re on leave, I can ask you a personal question.”
When he finally stood to leave, the pastor turned from his conversation with one of the church staff. He waved and smiled, and Steve waved back.
“Steve, your friend doesn’t laugh at my jokes,” Sam said with a pout. “I know they’re funny so I think he’s just got a stick up his ass.”
Steve couldn’t hold it in anymore. Tears welled over his bottom lids and rolled hot down his cheeks. His chest started to burn with sheer devastation, humiliation, and shame. He’d become the father everyone thought Tony would be, he realized. He’d become the father who forced Peter to do things he didn’t want to do. But he’d sworn Peter enjoyed painting with him. They always had fun...but maybe it was just him being an idiot.
Steve woke in the morning, the grey light of dawn soaking through his bones. He sat up almost immediately, his body an arc that sagged too deeply at the ends. He wiped his eyes, rubbing the sleep from them. Today was a day where he’d slept with pain in his chest and it had sat there all night, coagulating into something that sucked the life from his eyes but not the smile from his face.
“How did you manage that?” Steve asked. “What about the Avengers? All of the things you’re always working on in the lab?”
“No, nothing happened to me. You just…I wasn’t expecting that,” he finally muttered, scrapping at his oatmeal again. There were a few oats sticking on the sides that needed to be eaten.
Steve rounded the building, ducking into an adjacent alley to the secret entrance. He pressed his palm to a crack in a crumbling brick wall, but nothing happened. He tried again.
He didn’t want to risk waking Peter, so he didn’t touch or kiss him another time, though he wanted to.
“Hi,” Tony greeted, his voice choppy. “I’m close, I think. If you turn on your location I can be there in under an hour, max.”
“I’ve always forced myself to be part of this family,” he sobbed into Tony’s shoulder. “I always thought I could be his dad too. I al-al-always thought he’d love me like you ‘cause we raised him together.”
“Grace can’t be deserved,” the pastor said, looking out among the room. Steve had taken a seat in the back after entering late, trying to make his presence as small as possible. “The nature of grace is that it’s undeserved, but given anyway. Think of a time when you have been so in the wrong, when you’ve destroyed a relationship with someone—and many times we willingly make the choice to ruin this relationship!—and this relationship doesn’t have the slightest chance of being fixed.”
As the service closed, Steve said his prayers with an unsettling feeling in his gut. He’d done his duty—he’d extended his grace to Tony. Agreeing to be his fake boyfriend for potentially a full year? Yeah, he wasn’t afraid to say that was a big sacrifice. He was paying his debt and cleaning the slate. And if someone was going to make a grace argument, Tony was the one who was withholding.
“Should I leave?” Steve asked like a fucking idiot—always thinking he was the problem when he was in fact the opposite.
“Jesus.” Tony flopped onto his back, his hair a bird’s nest. He rested the back of his palm on his forehead and closed his eyes, clearly trying to think through the night.
The boat stopped and the men bunched at the door, pressed tight to each other. Staying in the boat was suicide, but so was leaving first. They all knew that, yet they all tried to be the first one out.
The indented gold leafing on the letters was real gold, though Steve knew that he hadn’t even gotten one of the real invitations. He knew because Peter had used almost the same invitation as his and Tony’s wedding. Steve and Tony had decided to send their closest friends special invitations made with slate that had been coated with a micro-thin layer of vibranium.
Steve seemed to recognize the discrepancy in their interaction, because when he spoke again his voice was oddly formal. “Did you get the cold rag?”
Steve didn’t move right away. He actually considered going back into the shower and getting hard yet again to give Tony one last good fuck before this was all over. His fingers twitched as he nearly reached for the handle.
They both stood there for a moment in tense silence, but Bucky’s gaze was turned away. Uncomfortable. He clearly didn’t want to be here, and Tony didn’t either, but neither of them made a move to leave.
The lab seemed quieter when they entered this time. Or maybe more peaceful. The soft clicks and whirrs of machinery seemed to still as they moved into their now-familiar places: Steve in the medical chair and Tony in the chair beside it, methodically strapping Steve into the various restraints. Tony’s hands were warm, and it lingered even as his fingers moved away. Though Steve kept his eyes on the straps, he could see Tony out of the corner of his eye, glancing up at him every so often to make sure everything was okay.
Tony’s tongue ran the length of him, swirling at the head. Steve adjusted his stance, staccato motions of his hips minute but more than enough on Tony’s throat, he knew. Tony sucked earnestly then, and soon Steve was slumped against the shower door, holding Tony’s nose flush to his skin as he swallowed down everything Steve gave him.
The man and Maria stared at each other for an uncomfortably long time as the man stroked her hair. Emotions flashed across his face as though they were having a conversation: relief, distress, relief again, then disappointment. Maybe a bit of anger too.
“I would really appreciate that,” Steve said, politely, his mouth free of food. How he ever managed to finish a meal was a mystery to Tony, but Steve’s plate was always picked clean by the end of the meal.
The next room was sea themed. The walls were lined with seashells, with piles and piles of them at the base of every exhibit wall. Of course, kids were trying their best to steal away from their parents to attack the piles, but from the looks of things, so far only a few had succeeded.
Disagreeing with the Accords had been a personal decision. It had expedited an already inevitable breakup, widening the cracks in their relationship they’d been able to gloss over before. “Taking a break” had come shortly before Siberia, and at that time, Steve had believed it would all blow over. He had truly—naively—believed that it was just a break. That maintaining a romantic relationship and a political war was too much to handle at once. And maybe they could have fixed it, if Tony hadn’t found out what Steve had hidden from him.
“I’m getting that vibe,” Tony chuckled. He looked concerned, but rested his head against Steve’s chest anyway. “I was worried about you.”
Anger burned low in Steve’s gut as Tony grabbed his phone and pushed past him to the door, yanking it open and sending it rattling on it’s hinges.
Steve sighed, and headed outside into the cool night air. Right past Tony and back to the beach to retrieve his blanket. Tony ought to at least stay warm.
There was something knowing in Bucky’s eyes that Tony didn’t think he liked, but he didn’t say anything. He’d asked Steve once about his relationship with Barnes, and Steve had always rolled his eyes. Everyone on the team had thought it, he was sure. Bucky Barnes was a heartthrob, there was no denying it. Those big blue eyes and sad, pouty lips. But Steve was no liar (though he was a truth-withholder) and when he said nothing had happened with Bucky, Tony believed him.
“Something a little more raunchy,” Tony said in a warning tone, very much aware of his daughter on his chest, slowly falling asleep against him as he swayed left and right. “Some very consensual things.”
He had a little girl waiting at home. A little girl who would be ecstatic to see him home a half an hour early.
He was actually excited for this. It was the first time he was able to be present for a friend’s wedding.  He readjusted his hold on his falcon sculpture and found himself smiling. The sun was warm on his shoulders and there wasn’t a cloud in the sky.
“I think you look very daddish,” Steve agreed distractedly as he worked to tie his tie. Hosting a Christmas party had sounded like a great way to announce their engagement, but now that it was the evening of, Steve wasn’t so sure. A ridiculous amount of people were attending, and their spacious ballroom venue had already looked packed full when Steve had checked the live feed online (yes, they had a live feed for a Christmas party).
“It really wouldn’t be a bad idea to sleep together,” he finally said. “Just in case this thing falls down on top of us. You could soften the blow.”
The boom of another mortar shell was close this time and they could feel the earth tremble beneath the explosion. It was so, so loud, yet muffled and dull as though it were happening somewhere else.
“Okay, can you hand over the oxygen mask , a cloth to wipe his face with and probably some scrubs. I’ll press the nurse call button once we are ready for you.”
“Don’t even think about infiltrating the company" clint looked absolutely devastated like a kid who just dropped his icecream on the floor.
“ don’t fall asleep yet, we need to clean up” he chuckled as Tony cuddled closer trying to get comfortable.
“I am fine! Seriously. It won’t happen again! You don’t have to call anyone” and Steve just stared wide eyed at Tony’s reaction and Tony finally added a “please" and turned his eyes down not wanting to look Steve in the eyes.
“okay get some sleep, it’s going to be a long day tomorrow”  she told him and left pulling the door closed quietly behind her.
“looks like the fossil has finally arrived home" natasha smirked and he gave her look that said 'shut up not here'. She just stuck her tongue out at steve and walked over giving him a peck on the cheek.
”no Steve please no” Steve held his arm firmly to hold him in place as he continued to scan his body for signs of abuse,
Tony didn’t say anything for a while and Steve thought he had fallen asleep , the walk taking a a real toll on him. But he looked down to see Tony was actually very much awake and lost in thought.
“Tony, look at me please" he didn’t receive a response and Steve snuck a hand below the comforter and ran his hand up Tony’s leg until it reached his briefs.
Steve didn’t miss the look Bruce and Tony shared this time and when bruce patted Tony on his back and stood up Steve’s heart started racing at what was to come
"where are Thor and Tasha?" Bruce asked. "Thor is with Jane. Natasha is at shield,she had lunch with the shield team." oh that's right! Steve and Nat had gone to shield for some training. "Why didn't you eat with them Steve?" I asked him puzzled as to why Steve drove all the way back just for lunch.
Just at the beginning of the third week, a camera was added to the room he was held in. They then proceeded to beat him unconscious and the next time he woke up the camera was gone.
“One, you let me call your guardian” Tony’s eyes went wide and before he could shake his head Steve continued “two, I can have the school counsellor talk to you about what is going on” he held up his finger when tony opened his mouth to argue “or three, you let me asses this injury of yours, and then we can talk about what is going to happen next”
“Its deeper than I originally thought, he needs stitches" Clint said and before Tony could react , Steve said “no sutures” and Clint gave him an unimpressed look but rummaged through the bag again pulling out a tube of something along with steri strips that Steve had used yesterday.
“Steeeve please I cant anymore” he huffed as he caught up and Steve steadied him as he bent over hands on his knees trying to take deep breaths.
As soon as he entered , looking at the faces he knew this was Tony’s class, and he spotted the collapsed girl by the volley ball court surrounded by a bunch of students and he jogged over.
“get some sleep please. It’s a school night, you have my class first thing in the morning and don’t think I won’t send you to detention for sleeping through my class” not that tony was coming to school tomorrow, he was injured and needed to recover for at least a few days. Because of Steve. He didn’t even want to think about what stane would have to say about all this.
But Tony balked , pushing at his arms “you want to keep your clothes on?” Tony nodded avoiding his eyes again “that’s fine, come here" steve didn’t give tony any warning before pushing him under the jet of cold water before following him .
“hey, don’t forget that you are one of us" clint snickered and Steve made a disgusted face at himself in the mirror, not just at clints response but at the dirty reflection of himself in the mirror.
“didn’t know I had an audience" he said pulling on his tie ,leaving it hanging loose around his neck.
“I really missed you Tony” he said once they were both up and away from the edge and tony turned to him eyes downcast
Steve apparently didn’t need coffee to get his day going, do Bruce’s tea was actually quiet appropriate for how fast his heart was beating now. Tony hand found his hand as he wrapped his fingers tightly around them and Steve found himself holding back tightly
“I am going to give you three options , one- you can let me call your guardian. Two – I tell the school counselor and you can talk to her or three – you let me asses this injury of yours , and we can see about if you want to talk about whatever it is that is going on either with me or with anyone that you are comfortable with.”
The party was already in full swing. Perfect to make my entrance. I was not interested at all in tonight's party just wanted an early night with Steve. But everyone seemed so excited about the party especially Clint, so I couldn't cancel it. I decided to make a quick (but, grandeur entrance as usual) and have a couple of drinks and answer a few quick questions and make my way home. Bed sounded so good to me right now. I have been awake for the past 32 hours working on the suit which was damaged in the battle last week. You never know when it's going to be needed again. Best to always be prepared.
“Hey kid, I think it’s better you leave now “ he said keeping his voice as steady as possible. His stomach lurched as he caught the expression on Tony’s face before he scrambled backwards outof the room and ran.
He seemed to really consider the question while he bit his lip and then suddenly before Steve could comprehend,  tony threw his arms around steve and buried his face into his chest.
“This way ,please” said a nurse ushering us into a room full of equipment for the blood draw  and as promised a table of snacks. There were three beds set up in a row and a couple of chairs.
Tony groaned a little , before finally prying his eyes open ,his eyes initially not tracking but after a few seconds it landed on my face before he gave me puzzling look.
He startled  a little when he heard a soft knock on the door , a mop of dark brown unruly hair sticking through, Tony gave him a small unsure smile as he waited for Steve to give him the okay to come in.
“A doctor cannot heal a cut in a day either” he was not wrong and Steve felt the small sheen of sweat that was starting to form across his forehead in panic.
“breathe with me okay? In and out. That’s it , follow my breathing” coaxing tony to take deeper breaths as he pulled him back to the bed and sat them both down ,steve leaning against the headboard and tony leaning on his chest.
Tony’s eyes drifted and seemed fixated on something on Steve’s arm and when Steve looked down he saw a red angry mark from the battle and Tony thumbed at it the skin blanching under his touch .
“You are really mean" he huffed pushing him away and Steve smacked his ass , if it were up to steve he would keep Tony here like this in his cute little underwear forever and let him go.
Coulson showed up before Clint even managed to boil water to make them coffee and slapped a letter onto the table glaring at Steve.
Steve went in to grab some blankets, and he rummaged through his medical cabinet( also very well stocked, given his superhero status that often warranted a lot of medical emergencies) to grab a small flashlight and prepared a syringe with tramadol knowing Tony was in a lot of pain .
“Obadiah stane, was Howard’s business partner” Steve was Howard’s best friend but he didn’t understand much of his business and his company. He had heard of the name often when they were both having a day to catch up and Howard would often complain about how stane wasn’t getting the point. The point of what , Steve didn’t know.
“Oh so you want me to be the bad guy?” she asked as she picked up the necessary things to insert it.
"was anyone on the team hurt? Anyone needing medical?" as captain I was always worried about the team. The post battle round up was always the worst.
steve was very aware of how much it had hurt him when they had done it for the first time after weaning him off the morphine. He had been so thoroughly exhausted by the end of it ,he couldn’t string words together.
“Ow!” He whined trying to rub the sore spot and Steve rolled his eyes pulling him closer and sitting him on his lap.
“Go take a shower and then we will talk" he frowned some more before nodded and holding up the shirt to Steve
“just before they put you under, you said you wanted obie because you were scared. Tony tell me you are okay with everything that’s happening please or I promise we will do everything to make sure you are.” Tony didn’t Stiffen like Steve thought he would, he actually looked surprised
“I am not here for this bullshit” he deadpanned and he could feel fury’s eyes burning a hole through him while did the same to Natasha. Fury may not be used to him cursing but nat and Clint were not surprised or impressed.
Bruce swallowed loudly leaning against the bed “why hide it?” steve shrugged and Bruce raised an eyebrow
“He’s going to be okay , steve” he said resting a hand on his shoulder. They looked at Tony in silence for a while, watching his chest rise and fall until natasha came in followed by rhodey and pepper who started started crying again looking at him.
“That’s not what I am afraid of, he has no self preservation whatsoever. He will walk right into whatever trap stane has set for him when he does turn eighteen"
His voice was shaking and he tried to control the rising volume but it didn’t matter anymore because Tony’s eyes blinked open tiredly as he squinted forehead creased trying to make sense of his surroundings.
"Okay tony, just let us do one blood test, and then we will leave you be." Bruce said and edged closer to the nightstand as if to pick up something.
“Hi tony, my name is Dr. Brandon. I just need to examine you real quick and then you and the captain can have a talk”  and then she turned to Steve and gave him a calming smile assuring him that they would be fine . Steve really liked her, she was always kind , professional and most importantly very patient especially when the team came in after a battle and always refused medical.
The person at the counter had told him mousse was just like pudding but lighter and he figured that maybe the closest thing Tony could digest right now. He knew it was nothing close to the cheeseburgers tony loved but it was going to be a while before he can eat something that greasy.
“Absolutely! That kid looks like he’s about to pass out though. Not sure what’s going on with him. Got him on the sidelines anyway. He's not playing today"
“Tony you gotta breathe buddy follow Steve’s breathing come on” Clint said and Steve followed taking exaggerated breaths.
“Mr. Rogers don't be mad okay? But Tony called us an hour back asking us to meet him at a bar. He was already drinking when we got here. I swear we didn't drink much, I don't think Tony drank much either. But he's like reaaaally drunk and he can’t go home like this, so we thought..”
“You don’t have to bribe me you know" he said when he was halfway through and Steve stilled his drumming fingers
Natasha was still asleep , curled up on the sofa along with Tony. She had her arms wrapped around him keeping him from falling over and that reminded Steve that he has not been paying enough attention to his teammates because natasha is never this tired and there must be something keeping her from resting .
upon getting closer, Bruce looked almost nervous and at the same time somewhat troubled. His index finger was rhythmically tapping on the tray in front of him.
Stane was here? He had no idea how to even handle this situation. They had been very careful to keep well within legal limits. To make sure CPS knew what was happening in Tony’s life, and bruce had even told him that the surgery was reported on a must basis and that they had given their go ahead.
Within seconds he was handed the things and he thanked the person without looking up. He took a little bit of the normal water splashing some on her face to give her a bit if shock before dripping some down her parted lips.
“hi” she said softly and Steve froze “you with us?” she asked and then Steve knew he was awake but he waited a few more seconds to feel Tony nod sluggishly.
See, what steve didn’t realize was that a little doped up meant Tony was high on pain medication and the sedative was only making it worse.
“Cut it.” He ordered in the most orderly voice he could muster and he could hear the whiplash from Tony turning down to look at him.
Tony’s moans  turned into whimpers as he came back to himself and Steve kissed his parted lips ,still pumping his hand around Tony’s soft but still twitching cock and he tugged at the tip , swiping his thumb over the slit. Tony let out a pitiful moan at that and Steve continued stroking him slowly.
“Happy birthday buddy” clint said as they entered the common kitchen, there was already pancakes on the table , courtesy of Clint apparently. When clint learned to cook , god only knows but atleast Steve was hungry enough to not care and just eat.
“The bathroom door is closed” he heard natasha say and Steve sighed relieved and his teammates just gave him pitiful look.
He was also concerned about the injury now, but tony had been walking around normally and had never shown an outward sign of discomfort. He was pulled from his chain of thought when the door was pushed open and Natasha poked her head in , waiting for an indication from Steve that it was okay for her to come in.
“And I will stay here till you wake up" he said and they spoke quietly back and forth like they usually did when tony didn’t want to sleep but needed it until he was too exhausted to say any more and his breathing quieted and his eyes fell shut.
He pulled the blanket down from around my shoulder letting it drop in my lap. I sighed knowing what was coming. I hated this. I was a genius for god's sake! A genius with a needle phobia! It brought too many memories of Afghanistan. I had hated anything to do with a hospital after the traumatic event of people cutting into my chest while i was wide awake.
“You will all still do your homework and show it to mr.william tomorrow.” He said feeling bitter and he knew he was taking it out on these poor kids.
“rhodey for fucks sake,  oww let go! I don’t want to be here" tony was yet to notice Steve was there as he tried to get free.
Tony clutched at him tighter almost clinging , Steve flipped him around so that Tony back was flush against his chest.
“I want to sleep" he said and it came out as a whine and steve didn’t get it, wasn’t he sleeping until he woke up?
“There aren’t many people tony is so open with , I am happy one of those people is you.” Steve’s eyes snapped up to meet hers
Steve motioned for him to get up and follow him and Tony didn’t even so much as blink before he jumped at the opportunity to not be stuck sitting there anymore . He willingly followed Steve out of the auditorium hands still constantly fidgeting with his tie.
Steve was a little alarmed at hearing that, cause that may have just confirmed an injury that Steve was suspecting based on how he was sitting before Tony noticed him.
“I know I don’t have all the information about what’s going on here but I won’t stand by and watch someone hurt you. Even if this relationship doesn’t work out between us , I am not going to go away , not unless you want me to.” Tony nodded silently, fingers twisting nervously in his shirt.
“Deserve whom?” tony asked sauntering over panting and sweating like he hadn’t just had a bath. He collapsed on the chair next to Steve gulling down all of Steve’s water.
“Do you remember the conversations we had?” he asked and wasn’t surprised when Tony shook his head. He sighed and adjusted his grip on Tony who was slowly sagging down unable to hold himself up anymore.
“You know exactly what I mean, I get that you want to protect him and do right by him but Steve it seems to me like he still doesn’t believe that you are indeed fine and here with him"
Steve’s side indicating that he should put his legs up. Tony very reluctantly did so and it was painful to watch him ho through this and not being able to fo much.
“Howard stark?” He forced himself to say as normally as possible. Oh it rung a lot of bells, bells that Steve did not want rung. When Steve had read that name on his student list that first day he had blatantly shut his mind from venturing into it. Because Howard’s boy, his best friend’s child had died along with his parents when he was only a baby. Steve had gone into the ice promptly a year after.
Tony giggled,  his nightmare already forgotten in the drugged state of his mind. He extentedid one arm out and grinned at Steve and then back at his hand
“I don’t know but he is here. Look" he said poking a finger at Steve’s arm. Steve smiled at him, holding him closer and looked at bruce “I won’t hurt him Bruce” he said and bruce didn’t nod, he didn’t shake his head . He didn’t give any reaction for that matter as he left the room.
“Mr.Rogers!” Ms.potts was waving at him while holding onto Tony like she was about to drag him somewhere
"Because he's mad you sent him to detention" steve rolled his eyes . If he didn't want to be sent to detention then he should have behaved. "Why would you do that Steve, the poor thing is stuck in detention with his arch nemesis."
“Okay, nothing to see here. You guys need to give her some space , she will be alright" he said clearing the crowd around them.
Steve sighed pulling his lover closer and holding him tight knowing once tony was awake he won't be too happy with him .
Tony , flashed a smile , pulled out a slip from his pocket and waved it in front of Steve “it’s called a hall pass for a reason Mr. Rogers” Steve blinked, not because of the little retort but that this was the first time tony had addressed him by name and it did something to Steve.
Steve brushed Tony’s hair back rubbing his ear with a thumb, knowing things were going to get ugly soon. He kissed the boys forehead one last time before leaving to meet Stane.
There was already a saline bag hanging from a pole next to the bed so at least tony knew that was coming.
