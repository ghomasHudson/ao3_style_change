“Should we believe them too, Ms. Carter?” he asked her, watching her reactions carefully.
“We have to go rescue any survivors we can find.”
“The odds of any mission can be improved if people work together.” Thor says, with a tiny, emotional smile quirking up the corner of his lips, and that sounds like it’s coming from an awfully personal place, something Thor is saying from the heart, more than just a mere motivational speech. “We’d have a better chance.”
The rain soaks them to the bones, cold and unmerciful, making them shiver and tremble where they lie, and even though it falls to gently ease off the burning flames from the torching trees, to ease the grass from its blazing trail, the freeze of it causing their breaths to come off in puffs of mist; They are swallowed by it, not even the darkness of the night wide and consuming enough to hide their shame, their remorse, the glaring, ugly truth that

“We could help, if he needed us to.”
“Fighting. Together.” Steve slaps his hands on the armrests, just so he keeps his hands busy, trying to shake away some of the incredible sense of vulnerability he’s feeling. Not all of it, though. Just a little. He feels like he’ll need to get used to it. “We can help in smaller conflicts, gather intel, stay out of sight. Even if it’s not much. But it’s not right if we just stand still. I know we can help, and I think we should.”

“The theory is… interesting.” Bruce admits, and he sounds as if he’s surprised by his own admission. “Time travel is a tricky thing and it seems like not even magic can solve that. There’s an entire section on the Time Stone, the story of the guy who found it and created the necklace Strange wore – the Eye of Agamotto, they call it.”

It is— It is almost
(Well. It seems like it didn’t go away, even after the fight.)
“Why didn’t you wake me up?” Tony asks, miserably, though he knows the answer will not make him feel better – he knows what this is now.
Natasha pouts exaggeratedly. “Poor child. Can’t stand to suffer for art.”
I've been trying my best to find a way from all the Point A's to the Point B's the MCU created and never properly navigated through, and I'm trying to do it with logic characterization - so you can probably tell why Pepper is a character that demands some of my attention. There sure is a lot of controversy surrounding Pepper and her relationship with Tony. Some people will defend Pepper with all their might, and some people will shun her out with no mercy, and to be perfectly honest, both sides have some very compelling arguments for their reasoning; But that little gray area between those two is where I thrive, and that's where we'll find the balance between Tony's view of Pepper, Pepper's view of herself, and the true effect of her presence and actions, and how that affects our views, as spectators, of her.

They look at him helplessly. “What message?”
Tony knows that with the right push, all that hesitation will fly out straight out of the window and Bruce is going to be pure and unfiltered
“You’re not fine.” Tony says, and it sounds much more like an accusation than he intended to, but he can’t help it, not even if he can see how strongly the hurt hits behind Thor’s hard glare, even if he knows he shouldn’t pick up a fight with one of the only people Tony doesn’t have bad blood with from his original team, even if Thor doesn’t deserve this pain any more than any of them do.
“And exclusive, just for active Avengers members. Why not? The EU does it, and it works fine.

Tony the mere idea that this might put another mistake on that list, maybe even dethrone the entire mess of 2015, and isn’t that all of Tony’s nightmares transformed into reality – losing the respect and the alliance of one of the very few people that he still has from, in the middle of the biggest crisis they’ve ever faced?
She hums, half in agreement, half in thoughtfulness, and says nothing. The silence stretches lazily between them, like syrup dripping down sluggish and patient, and Tony loses himself in repetitive motions up and down her arm, as the pad of her middle finger strokes a particularly bumpy part of the scar, the ridge of the texture guiding her caress purposefully, and he sighs, not quite content, but something that almost could be.
The Civil War puts a damper on things.
“Hey, husband.”
“Would you like to read them, Captain?” T’Challa offers once more, a hint of something gleeful on his voice, so well hidden he can barely see it, though his eyes are shining with a brilliant hope. “I would be glad to provide them to you.”

at this completely ridiculous idea.
He thinks of stepping back, but Natasha suddenly looks over Steve’s shoulder and spots him, and her smile widens – he can’t escape now, or else she’ll pull him back by force.
“That depends.” Natasha states plainly. “Any other secrets you’re hiding?”
Steve, who just wants this all to end.
The man gives him a disbelieving look.
“Yeah?” Sam agrees, but it sounds like a question. “You said Stark went crazy and blew Barnes’s arm off. ‘Cause Zemo did something—”
Tony nods, and says loudy, directing the instructions to FRIDAY, “Send an alert to Natasha and tell her to speed up her search of T’Challa’s sister. We might have a breakthrough with the Gauntlet here, we need a reply as soon as possible.”

Now he has proof that it can be achieved, he feels invincible. This is merely a test-drive. He’ll still do as he planned, of course, because the problem - the initial problem - hasn’t changed. He can’t forget that. The mansion is still empty, it’s hallways still stifling and cold, and this is what he’s going to do to fix it. Then, he can move on.

Every single time it was like he couldn’t trust the ground, using only the momentum of his legs and the strength in his arms to keep himself standing.
He startled Tony. Bad.
“With other soldiers? No.” It’s unsurprising Steve catches so quickly Tony’s implicit question. He might have even prompted in on purpose, and Tony simply fell for the bait. “I was—”
in slipping back into his role as the leader, as the one who says orders and expects to be obeyed without preamble, it makes something uneasy twist in Tony’s stomach, something that is not bitterness nor rage, but just as uncomfortable, wary and reluctant.
But all he can say is—
“Probably not.” Tony concedes, but the math in his head is having difficulties to make itself clear, since his thoughts and feelings are jumping about madly like monkeys in a barrel, the rush of adrenaline still not gone. “But having a base element is a good starting point. Also Vision was not pure Vibranium. Dr. Cho’s cells and the electricity of the cradle and Thor’s hammer – the entire thing is what put Vision together.”

“Including this book.” Wong gestures, raising the book so they all can see it as he brings it closer, and carefully hands it to Rogers. “This is the Book of Cagliostro, a study of Time. It’s the book Stephen Strange studied to become the next Sorcerer Supreme, after the Ancient One passed away.”

Maybe she did. Maybe that’s what happened. Maybe they opened Tony up and when they realized how messed up he is inside, when they saw the huge lump of the mesh rearranging itself inside Tony’s body to keep him from bleeding out – too much, at least –, they realized they wouldn’t be able to cut it out without killing him. And Nebula knew. Nebula knew the mesh responded to him, the same way the armor did. And she instructed them, not giving away too much — just enough, enough so they could help Tony, because Nebula is the wariest being Tony has ever met and she obviously didn’t trust anyone. She

There’s a moment of questioning pause, and then, they all start looking around to find each other’s gazes, confusion in their eyes; because save from the four of them, no one else knows about Bruce’s initial prediction yet, because it all got so lost with Wong, and Strange’s books, and the riot, and literally

Nebula cares, apparently. Maybe. To some extent.

It’s useless. He is always losing.
Because what can he say against that, really? Nothing.
Tony nods, but doesn’t supply any more information. Not because he’s wary. He just… He doesn’t feel like talking.

He doesn’t want to go back to that time, to that… to that cold night, to the memories of white and red, snow and blood, and

The corridor in which Tony’s bed was cornered into was completely empty, ever since he woke up, and all doors across it are closed tight and never once moved. The lights are off, he belatedly notices. Far down the hall, where the corridor meets the circulation area, the fluorescent lights are on as they should be, and the walls and floor are so white they hurt his eyes. But the corridor, his corridor, is dark. Dim and secluded, a small space where he feels totally detached from the outside, a tiny piece of a world that feels like it shouldn’t exist.

Tony can’t raise his head, but breathes in deep, and hopes it counts as a response.
Nebula is looking at him flabbergasted, her eyes wide and confused, questions swirling inside the dark infinity of her gaze, as if Tony is a puzzle she cannot figure out. She looks at him, at his hand laid on top of Dum-E for a very, very long time, until she says:

Tony knows that voice.

“I’m sure I can live with that. Although, to be clear, I want you to know my feelings are very hurt.”

Problem is: it's going to take a little while to get ready, so, I want to propose something. If you have any ideas for an extra fic that should be included in this series, let me know! As a gift for all of you for the milestone, I am considering adding a small fic, just a one-shot really, to expand upon some scenes or missing scenes of Part I or the chapters posted so far in this fic. Feel free to leave suggestions! I want to know what you guys would be interested in discussing more at length. In the next chapter of this fic, I plan to create a poll so everyone can vote on selected prompts - and I should make a short fic based on the winning prompt soon after the next chapter is out. Don't be shy about it! I really want to know what you guys would be more interested in reading. I have some ideas of my own, but I'd like to know your opinion, because this milestone has only been possible to achieve because of you!

There are abandoned cars all over the avenue, crashed into nearby stores and into each other, letting out gusts of gray smoke into the air, smearing oil all over the asphalt and darkening the floor into a deep, thick, viscous black.

“Sure? No.” Scott laughs in a depreciative manner. “But I’ve been thinking. I was catching up with the news, and I’ve been seeing a lot of talk about some amendments to the Accords and things like that, and I thought… I thought I should give it a try.”
Now he can stand in the middle of a crowd and feel at peace.
“Alright, that’s as good as any.” Tony mumbles to himself, scratching his head nervously, a sheepishness he hasn’t felt in years crawling under his skin with sharp pinpricks of needles. “Let’s talk about the other ones, then. What do we got?”
So she most absolutely did. But Jarvis will not point that out.
“I will see if there’s anything important in Mr. Stark’s medical records.” He promises. “But if there’s anything I should know beforehand, Captain, now would be a good time to say so.”
Tony had been living two separate lives because this was the only way he could’ve kept Pepper safe. He realized that, after Killian. Pepper couldn’t be a consequence to his own addictions and vices, to his work and the

He wonders if the others had.
“T’Challa made him a shield, for the battle.” She clarifies, suspiciously slow, dragging the words a little, infusing them with a meaning that Tony’s muddled mind is too frantic to properly identify. “But he decided he didn’t want it.”
Oh, but he knows that is not true.
He cannot read the Accords right now, but he recognizes T’Challa’s offer for the olive branch that it is. Steve has passed the opportunity of taking many of those lately. Even if he is too rejecting this one, he won’t do it with anger – because he

“Yeah, no, got it.” Tony hastily says, retreating immediately. “Good. No knives. No more knives or sharp objects of any kind from now on.”

Tony excuses himself from the group, putting his hands in his pockets and striding over to Steve with all that casual sway that always makes Steve stare when he saunters into a room, and unknowing to the power he holds over Steve’s poor, besotted heart, he says, full of charm:
he hasn’t yet lost Natasha.
“I’m – I’m just a SHIELD Agent, Tony. I was never supposed to be an Avenger. You think I want this? I was caught on this by accident, I wasn’t even part of PEGASUS, I was supposed to be watching over Selvig while he searched on the Tesseract. Otherwise, I’d be with Coulson on his new division. I didn’t even get the chance to be debriefed before Thor’s hammer was found in New Mexico and I was moved to a new section. I wasn’t
“You want to shake on it?” Steve jokes, and he is pleased to see that is enough to bring out her laugh, to make the last of her anxiety ebb away and allow only the gleeful hope to guide her from now on.

“We know—” Tony starts, but then has to stop, because his voice cracks and his breath stutters, starting to get too overwhelmed by the onslaught of discussion and information that’s being brought forward, and he takes a moment to blink away the blurriness in his sight and to gather air, before continuing. “We know it’s possible to use them separately. Strange used the Time Stone, Loki used the Tesseract, HYDRA used the Mind Stone. Individually, they can be held.”

But he can’t be sure.
“Mr. Stark! Hi! Can you please—” The voice says, agitated, and very loud, as if they’re afraid they might not be heard. Which, considering Nebula is threatening murder, is an acceptable reaction. “I’m not – I don’t know if you remember me – this is Scott? Scott Lang? Ant-Man?”
He steps inside and Bruce follows, and the awkwardness of his silence compels Bruce to drop it for a moment, and they both get to work of gearing up the machine and getting some supplies in tense, fragile quiet. It’s not fair to Bruce, making him uncomfortable to stop him from insisting on his questioning, but what can Tony do? What can he possibly say? That he’s sorry he worried them? He didn’t mean to. He went out there to try and save the world, and they all know that there’s always a chance he won’t come back. He didn’t even know if he would make it back. It’s the burden of their occupation. And even if they were worried, which still makes Tony’s heart squeeze painfully, like a fist going around it and holding so tight onto it that it nearly stops beating, he cannot dwell in it.
“Black holes.” Bruce blinks, aghast. “They create black holes.”
Nebula looks at him like he is a liar, and he is.

Dangerously arrogant, Rhodes had once called him. Steve had thought that was uncalled for. Steve had thought he knew exactly what was wrong and what was right, that he was always making the best call, and he could rest, if not peacefully, at least placated, knowing he did his best and he always took the best route to achieve his goals.

it is. It’s a little on the heavier side, definitely a little heavier than Tony’s other hand if Steve were to grab it too, but it’s sleek and bright and incredible, plates locked together seamlessly, mechanical joints bending and gripping so naturally it can only be the work of a genius. Steve has to snap his gaze away from it and back to Tony, or else he’ll pull too hard and only cause another accident, like pulling Tony directly into himself or something.
Pepper nods slowly, squeezing his hand back, but she lets him go, trusting, and Tony draws in a huge, long breath, even if it stings on his ribs; and the cold air flooding in his lungs keeps him clear-headed, keep his awake, keeps him focused.
He wants to ask why it bothers Steve, that’s not a lie, but he won’t. And he also can’t figure out on his own, so even if it kills him, there’s only one option to choose – he has to drop it. Steve is here; Tony has to trust that the worst part is over, that Steve is done hiding, and they hopefully can go back to normalcy and Tony can return to ignoring his desire of doing something really ridiculous like holding Steve’s hand.
It’s stifling, inside the workshop.
Shuri grins so wide it must hurt her cheeks, but it is one of the most incredible things Steve has ever seen in his life.
But she didn’t.
“Well.” Tony muses in the comms, feeling a weird necessity to keep the chatter going. “They seem to be in shock for now but I don’t think we should wait too long.”
Steve gets up and jumps over Clint’s legs on the floor to be able to leave quietly, the dim lights of the living room and the sounds of car chases only barely registering in his mind, and he grabs himself some juice and a coffee mug for Tony without any rush, the movie forgotten in the lazy, familiar feeling of

“Get him to meet me at gate.” It’s all he says, and Tony wants to argue more, but he knows that it’ll get nowhere, so he takes what he can get.
“I promise, I’m not trying to steal any of your Army backpay – Rhodey would never forgive me.” Tony slaps him in the back, as if trying to help with his throat, and it’s too late when he realizes his hand is shaking. “You’re here for snacks and to look pretty, Rogers.”

“You’re an asshole.” Tony tells him, voice strangled with emotion.
When he opens his eyes, the room seems much brighter than when he walked in. Ironically, it looks much smaller too. He stumbles out of the chamber and finds that his body is suddenly so big he can’t control it, and his spatial awareness, unsurprisingly, is still a complete mess. So he wobbles and stumbles a little when he tries to walk, like a newborn fawn or an incredibly oversized child, and Stark and Erskine hold him steady while he catches a metaphorical breath, his head still spinning from

But the idea of it was tempting enough, so tempting, that he couldn’t quit. That’s all it takes, sometimes; Tony needs to see the big picture, he needs to see the future he so desperately wants, to feel it close but just outside his reach, so something in him ignites and bursts into flame, and pushes him forward. And that had been Pepper. For him, she had been it. The idea of finally reaching a point where they both met in the middle, where he finally reached the balance between his mission and his love, that was the goal Tony had always been trying to reach.

Or maybe he would be brave enough to share his own feelings, his own story, but years of habit of restraining himself from sharing even the slightest bit of personal information in fear of going too far and revealing too much, and his very real and very insisted insecurities about the times where he ignored that restraint and it backfired so spectacularly – it all makes him a very lousy shoulder to cry on, honestly.

“So,” Rhodey drawls, “Pepper called me.”

Steve, the absolute monster, is still wiping the floor with Tony even after eating enough to feed an entire family. Tony is going to demand a rematch. They gather a small crowd around them, a bunch of excited kids who watch them play with stars in their eyes and big grins in their faces, and Tony pretends he’s not smiling back and holding back laugher at their jittery joy, even as they loudly cheer in Steve’s favor and not his’, the little rascals.

He doesn’t even know how to… feel. About this. Crushing guilt, is what he instinctively feels – for what, he doesn’t really know, but guilt, it’s impossible not to recognize. Maybe guilt for… for not having succeeded as he wanted to, not succeeding in getting people to safety, or not succeeding in… literally everything else he thought he might be able to do to keep this situation in his control. Maybe for failing to predict this, when it should have been so obvious it would happen. FRIDAY had alerted him that it had already happened in other places in the world, how could have he been so naïve as to believe it would happen so close to home? Maybe guilt because he can’t help them, not so many of them, not right now; his money is worth nothing, his suits can’t stop the ashes from clouding the entire sky, his machines can’t bring people back together from dust. Tony doesn’t think he ever felt like this – not even when he first realized what the sight of his name engraved on the side of a terrorist bomb, or even when he saw the sky split into a wormhole right above his head, only to allow an entire alien army to attack. Not even then. Not ever.

And Pepper knows it. Peter never was to Pepper what he was to Tony, he knows, because they hardly knew each other.

He’s incredibly stressed out. “He said it would be giving away our right to choose. The thing is – we shouldn’t have the right to choose if

“I have reasons to be.”
“Maw’s ship might have the coordinates, but the system must be working for me to be able to access it, and the ship is destroyed. So we need to access your armor using the ship’s tracking and follow the path back to where you came from.”
Too silent.
“It’s gonna rain.” Bruce says, sort of to himself, but also loud enough for everyone to hear him, certainly loud enough for everyone to stop in their tracks and turn back to stare at him where he stopped, by the door, as if his feet didn’t have enough strength to move him any further. “We weren’t accounting for rain yet.”

“So dark energy it’s not just something that’s making the universe wider, it can also be used to shrink and twist it at will?” Bruce asks, raising his eyebrows, looking at Thor through his eyelashes as his head bows down in thoughtful consideration.
So, Shuri is probably going to wait up there with him. Keeping an eye on Steve. Or Bucky.
“Yeah.” Pepper says, as gently as she can. “I know. And you also put yourself at risk, every single time.”
Maybe they should have stopped, he doesn’t know. He doesn’t know what to do
(The Accords.)
Steve shakes his head a little, amused, “No, I’m good. Thanks, T’Challa.”
That doesn’t stop him from worrying about it, though.
Right now, there is nothing else they can do. They are outside the city limits, hours away from their current hotel, and there is a Wakandan jet waiting for them right ahead, with a pilot Steve can’t really see from his position. Clint tells him that it’s not Nakia, but it’s a pilot sent by the king himself, and Steve supposes he’ll have to take this information as it is and be satisfied.
“Did you even sleep last night?” Bruce prods, disbelieving.
Tony kind of agrees with him, and huffs a very tight, very troubled breath.

“He needs time to heal. He needs to find out who he is without other people controlling his thoughts! And if you expect him to come out of this chamber only to act like your best friend from the forties, you are a fool. He might not like you now, have you thought of that?”
Steve has almost no regards for rules, despite what his Captain America persona might make people believe, because rules are restrictive, and Steve never liked to feel trapped. Even less now, after seventy years trapped inside an ice cage.

His hands are shaky as he dresses. Once he’s done, surprisingly, Nebula plasters herself back to his side, tightening her hand around his back, securing his wrist over her shoulder with a firm grip – showing him, without words, that she is ready to proceed, and she wants Tony to be alert for it.
“Steve thinks he’s the one who put it there.”
(Because she’s the first one to bring it up.)
Tony waves his hand in a lazy gesture. “Call me Tony, Cap. ‘Mr. Stark’ makes me feel old, I’m sure we can skip the formalities if we’re gonna be roomies.”
Natasha considers him for a moment, trying to keep her posture formal and stiff, but Steve can see the way her shoulders slump only a tiny bit at the new information, a brief relief she won’t allow anyone to know she feels, by knowing Tony is not in any sort of life-threatening danger. But, as immediately as that happens, she cocks her head a bit to the side, analyzing Steve with confused, extremely curious eyes. “This is really bothering you, isn’t it?” She says offhandedly, using a tone much softer than Steve would’ve expected she’d use. “Why?”
When it happened.
The thing is…
, this is not the same, that he can’t focus on the past because they are dealing with the future now, and it helps. To see her in front of him, to see Rhodey, to have Pepper’s hand in his, it’s a reminder that he still has anchors. That despite what he feels, the world has not yet swallowed him whole.
(It’s cold.)
“You have a point there, Mr. Jarvis.” The man says, sounding honest, as if he believes it. “But your research won’t go far with the resources you have now. Howard Stark’s codes will be outdated soon, and eventually, they will be replaced. But if you wanna be inside when the fight begins, I can give you a way in.”

The first few times, though, he was there alone more often than not. Sometimes Sam would come along and they would play or dance, or maybe Steve would sit at the bar talking to Natasha or Jan, or meeting the new people that had arrived on campus when he wasn’t looking. But many times, he’d been there by himself, just playing pool.
Rhodey is approaching quick, Tony can see him in his HUD, the red marker blinking to indicate his position moving quickly from the east side towards the main garden – and even though Tony didn’t doubt for a second that Rhodey could handle himself in a high-pressure situation, both with his Air Force background but also by his expert work with the War Machine suit, it’s still…

When he has no other order to complete, U usually finds something to occupy himself with, something to grab and examine, just as Dum-E always does.
Tony has taken this same route to DC many times, and though his sense of the passage of time has never been the best, this flight seems to stretch for an eternity, the scant light spots they can see passing by beneath them as they fly not nearly as abundant and frequent enough to be a relief. He can’t be sure if the cities are all losing power or if there’s no people down there, or, if there are, if they’re just hiding in the dark, afraid of being seen. The uncertainty is the worst part, the fear of the worst and the naïve hope for the best, and no way of knowing which is which.
“I thought you weren’t that kind of doctor.” He jabs, even though he knows it’s not fair, hoping the not so amicable reply will dissuade Bruce from prodding, taking unfair advantage of his non-confrontational nature to keep himself far away from his delicate topic.

“We have all reason to believe the outcome of Mr. Lang’s trial will be a positive one.” Vision finally concludes, with only a slight tilt of enthusiasm in his voice, a quiet, but present thing, the hopeful expectation Steve so desperately wants to believe in. “The judgment might have been passed, but the sentence is not permanent. As soon as possible, Mr. Lang will be able to request an appeal for a reduction of his sentence, and possibly, he will be able to return to his normal life, before the Ant-Man was ever a concern for him.”

“I have something for you. But there’s something you need to know first.” Howard stops just as they reach the front of the room, a room they never actually used in the mansion, just one more of the many empty spaces Maria never got to fill for Anthony as he’d grow up. She stares at the door pensively, until Howard blocks her way with his shoulder, trying to gather her attention once more. “Maria. No one can know about what’s in there. Not now, at least. Maybe in a couple of years, after it’s a little more refined.

Steve suddenly has the weird impulse to ask Bucky if he has finally found his calling as a farmer, but he doesn’t quite have the motivation or the high spirits to say that joke out loud. He mostly just wants to sit here, in silence, and listen to Bucky speak – the undeniable proof of everything has been fighting for, the proof that Steve’s best friend still exists, he’s still alive, and there is no trace of that looming shadow they call Winter Soldier.
The rain clouds are creeping closer now. It’ll rain soon. He won’t be able to see the sunset because in a matter of minutes, maybe, the sky is going to be completely grey, dark and stormy, turning the night ice cold. Steve’s fingers feel a little numb. His knuckles have healed. The smell of the rain is almost overwhelming, rich and sharp, and he takes a deep breath to get it into his lungs, savoring the feel of something that isn’t the tenderness in his hands or the fluttering of his uneasy heart, the wings of the hummingbird trying to escape its cage, a staggering amount of conflicted feelings he has no way of letting out.

Roger’s lips twist anxiously, like those words he’s keeping in are just trying to claw their way up his throat and out of his mouth, and he’s keeping them in by sheer will alone, jaw locked so tight not even a crowbar could force open his teeth.
One day, they can fix this. They can deal with it. It’ll blow over – and Bucky will be safe, Wanda will be safe, they’ll be free, and then they’ll fix it. It’s not the end of the world. They can save the Avengers, after they both heal.

“Why is that?”
“I was aboard Thanos’ ship when he brought her in.” Nebula confesses, head still bowed low, her eyes fixed at a random point on the floor, as if she could see the memory unfolding before her eyes like it was happening to someone else, like a movie reel playing in a way only she could see. “I had snuck in days before. I tried to kill him. But the Black Order was there and they were too many, and I was captured.”
But that’s okay for Natasha. It’s always been okay for Natasha.

“No.” Thor gives an airy chuckle. “I am aware of your aversion to anything that could be called magic, Stark. If you don’t want protection spells, that is your choice. But I do believe, that much like the Sorcerers of the Time Stone can harness power from the universe, and like the Maximoff girl could harness power from the Mind Stone, there can be a way for us to harness power from the Stones even before we manage to take them off his Gauntlet. It would allow us to fight the Infinity Stones with equal power, which might be our only chance to win.”

“But I checked.” Scott just keeps talking, completely unaware of how deeply he has disturbed Steve. “No civilian casualties, no interaction with the public, no religious, political or ideological motivations. No conflict with German forces either, so there’s no explanation they can give to make these charges hold up to argument; so that’s a plus, I guess. The rest they can charge me with? I can negotiate. So far, the list includes: destruction of an airport – not good, but I can work with it -, escaping prison – that one is a

A rare color in the South, but far more common here, from what Antonio can see in his husband’s company. His stature is imposing, but not as much as his width, shoulders so large that the fur laid on them does nothing to disguise how broad they are, just as his hands are big, from that Antonio could see, when they first met – when the Captain guarded his weapon of choice, a

to. Thanos’ illusions of greatness and desire for power are nothing new – maybe he can see the similarities between him and Ultron, but he can also see those in Loki, in Strucker, in Killian. They all intersect at that small piece of the diagram that guards the worst possible outcome; A fierce sense of superiority, wrapped in the insulting belief that murder is somehow doing someone a favor.

Four years until the story picks up? Sitting idle inside the Compound, wallowing in guilt and loss until the end of days, waiting for a blessing from the skies to arrive? No, darlings. Here, we work with a time restraint. We work with the highest of stakes. We work with consequences.

“Cap, I’m joining you.”
“I’m fine.” Tony assures her again. He taps at the compartment twice, two quick beats of his fingers, and the only sound it makes is the dull impact of his digits on the casing. It doesn’t click anymore. “See? All set and good.”
“He had plenty of chances to kill us and he never took them. It wasn’t just about killing us, when he said
Tony had never questioned Nebula’s resolve to hunt Thanos, nor her reasons – how could he, when the very essence of her inspires his trust in the weirdest of ways, and her demeanor is so transparent, so honest and determined that Tony feels like he has no choice but believe the words she says? Maybe Tony should know better, but he doesn’t, not really, does he? But he won’t deny it’s oddly comforting to know what’s on her mind, what is keeping her here, though murderous desire for revenge would have been more than enough for Tony, at this point. But it’s… nice, if he can call it that, to find in her rage some sort of echo of his own, to discover that their purpose is not that far off from one another, and maybe, just maybe, even if the others leave, these two can stay and they might be able to do some good together.
Then he says Italian, and Tony can’t let him try anything but the best.
God, Pepper can’t even begin to understand how sorry he is, how guilty he feels knowing she was down here all this time, watching the people vanish into nothing and with no idea what had happened to him, when she had desperately asked him to come back as soon as Tony had boarded the alien ship. She had asked for him. She asked him to stay, all but

He lays down and Bruce sets up the machine, and the cold of the bed against his naked chest makes Tony shiver, the hairs on his forearms standing up with a prickly sensation, his muscles tense. The acute awareness of it is the only thing that stops him from blurting out something he will regret, so he welcomes it, and he lays his head down and breathes in deeply, his thoughts in turmoil, and watching Bruce the only thing he has available to distract him from the temptation of
“Boss.” FRIDAY interjects. “It has been reported they have set fire to abandoned vehicles on their trajectory. Agent Klein fears they might be marching with the intent of causing harm.

She helped. Nebula helped, didn’t she? And Tony heard the voices, the cries. He did. But… But Nebula could have just forged that – But again, why would she? What sort of elaborate scheme could she have, that would make all of this necessary? There’s no explanation Tony can find besides the obvious, even if the obvious makes no sense: She really is just helping.
Nebula frowns.

“I might
“Guys.” Rhodey calls from behind Rogers, very cautiously, and Tony would feel a little uncomfortable with how obvious it is that Rhodey was waiting for a chance to interrupt them without setting off any of them into a rage fit, but he’s keyed up enough that he can only feel grateful for Rhodey’s peaceful intervention. “Thor is waiting for us. C’mon.”
Thor seems incredibly divided by their interaction, not sure if he should intervene or let them be, but in the end, he doesn’t say a word.
“To what?”
As restless as he is, he will

But Tony hasn’t gotten it yet.

“But you signed. And so did she. And she then
With just enough strength for it to be painful, she carefully directs him away from Bruce, guiding him to the benches on the opposite side, behind the occupied control chairs. Tony is so out of it he can’t even find the strength to protest. He simply watches, as Rhodey and Barton occupy the first chairs, ready to pilot, and right behind them sit Natasha and Rogers, with two other command chairs empty beside them. He would go there and sit next to them, but he’s not sure he can, and Nebula pushes him down the benches with such finality that he simply follows the movement, and as she sits beside him, he feels like he’s being monitored; and because it’s Nebula, because Bruce already looks beyond himself with discomfort, Tony feels oddly compelled to comply with Nebula’s guidance, simply watching as Thor takes upon himself to sit beside Bruce without a single word, Stormbreaker between his hands, the blade resting on the floor between Thor’s feet.
Rhodes runs out of the Quinjet.
–, if the day when they would all be brought together in desperation ever arrived.
This is the thought that fills his brain all the way back to the Jet, for the entire trip home, and not even the sight of the Compound’s lights is a greeting warm enough to melt away the huge block of ice that seems to have hardened inside his chest.
And so, before we get to Bucky, let's go through Wanda. And all the projecting, expectations and weirdly protective beliefs Steve applied onto her when she joined the team. Let's be honest, I'm not fully convinced about Wanda's characterization in the MCU. In fact, I'd go as far as to say she's no more than a very convenient placeholder, whose powers and motivation bend into whatever shape the writers and produces require her to, and spends almost 100% of her time having her personal story affected by the men that surround her, that make her choices for her and make her seem like a person with no independence whatsoever. The kind of character I usually don't spare a glance at. Let's fix that, shall we? She's supposed to be an Avenger, so let's make her one. It might take a little while; after all, Steve is nothing if not stubborn, but that's exactly why we're here. We're making sure he learns some stuff. Why not include 'how to properly support your guilt-ridden teammates' on that list? After all, he's gonna need it very soon.
He will not sit by and watch it happen.
It makes sense.
Because then, there was always the illusion that Tony might want him back. Might want
In. Out. Breathe.
“The original material is an ancient metal, called Uru.” Thor explains, with the familiarity of someone who has heard or told this tale a thousand times before. “The Dwarves where the only ones skilled enough to use it. It had many forms, but they are all equal in one way: their ability to withstand grand power and magic, without coming apart.”
Steve had hoped one day, Tony would help him help Bucky. But that’s not going to happen anymore.
“You think it’s possible?” Natasha asks, as soon as Tony is in her line of sight. Her face is smeared with soot. “To bring them back?”
Because even when Tony has nothing else, he has his nightmares, he has his demons, he has the voice at the back of his head, the one who still sounds like
“Yeah, apparently she is.” Tony says into the speaker, even though Nebula spoke far too loud, so Rhodey definitely heard her himself. “So no shooting the blue android when you get here.”
, and it won’t be good.”
, like she fears the answer Tony might give. “If we try to connect your armor to the ship?”
“I wasn’t planning on getting stabbed.” Tony exasperatedly exclaims, not really answering the question.
They all seem to be lost in thought, when a quiet, awkward sound brings them all back to the present, all eyes turning to Wanda as she steps a little closer to Vision. She looks awkward, but determined, and she steals a glance at Vision beside her before she clears her throat gently and speaks:
“Are you hurt?” Nebula interjects, worriedly, her face distorting to something too similar to a frown.
(Why do they always have to choose?)
“Not much.” Barton admits, with a half-hearted shrug. “Only that Fury was trying to do something that he clearly wasn’t ready to face yet. Selvig was in it too, and a bunch of other scientists. But even then, they figured it worked for some sort of portal-opening device. When Loki attacked, they’d been trying to open it from our side, until Loki opened from his’.”

He doesn’t have the time to adjust to the idea that this is how it is now, that he’ll have to find a way to make all of these people not to step on each other while trying to help, that they might not be able to finish their mission because they lost their rhythm, they’re completely out of sync.

“Magic is just science you don’t understand yet.” Thor unexpectedly says, and Tony has to stop and turn to look at him, dumbfounded. Thor looks back with a disarmingly soft look in his eyes. “Jane used to say that.”

But it’s still a lot.

“We were glad you came, Vision.” Steve admits, and he too means it, because Vision reaching out to them has given them more than just mere information. It has given them,
Being together again feels strange. And Steve wishes he could fall back into the ease he felt before, but the memories of Leipzig are all coming back to him at once and he feels himself raising his guard, slowly and cautiously,

it in his voice. “Please, Ms. Carter. He has been in contact with only me for the last five years. I do not know how much he can actually perceive, if he understands time or loss, but we are only human. We are sentimental things. And I have to admit that I’m sentimental enough to not want to see the young Mr. Stark locked up in an attic with the rest of the furniture.”
Sometimes, they go with her. Not in a sense that they follow her, because they don’t, but they do move countries with her every once in a while, simply because it’s convenient. They still have to keep it moving, after all. Their numbers might be slowly going down, but at the end of the day, they are still fugitives; And the ones that are left have to stick together as much as they can, because they have no one else they can trust.
Steve wonders what he must look like, in T’Challa’s eyes.
It’s a scream. A desperate, horrified scream.
Steve’s mind is suddenly flooded with soft, worn-out memories of Peggy, like old photographs, in muted tones and frayed at the edges, but so loved and so close to his heart that he can’t help but smile a little, a longing that never quite faded making itself known inside his chest, the marks of a love that faded, but never disappeared, and probably never will.
This is bigger.
Tony can fight with him – against him or beside him, whatever it’s necessary. He can do it. He can accept the fact that they’re here now, they’re back, and in the worst circumstances ever, not when they should be; But Tony can overlook all of that in favor of working together and fixing this mess and saving the world. He can do it. It’s not a problem.
“Your right to choose what, exactly?” Bruce asks.
That’s what matters now.

they aren’t being attacked by aliens, Romanov.” Sam jabs at her, exasperatedly.
“Yeah.” Tony pauses, concerned. “What’s up, buddy?”
(When you’re desperate.)
Steve could try to explain in many, many ways.
Fair point.
It’s done. It can’t be changed. Much like the ruins of Tony’s relationship with his own father, Tony’s feelings for his creations had been confusing, sometimes even incomprehensible, and overwhelming – and maybe, some chances had been lost. They definitely have. And it’s too late.
A what?
“Well,
“Are you okay?” Rogers asks, after his hand has retreated for long enough that Tony should not be as taken aback as he is anymore, but as his brain starts to come back online, he sees the tightly woven tension in Rogers’ muscles, his hurt, but concerned and baffling sincere eyes, the look only heightened by the somber aura the beard and the long hair give him.
“Did you ever do
There isn’t much to say, because Vision soon stops speaking, and waits for Steve to say something in return. He doesn’t. Steve stands there, his ears ringing with a shrill noise, sweat beading in his skin and his beard scratchy and itchy and uncomfortable, his hands shaking, his stomach dropping so low he almost fears something is wrong in his body. He feels like the entire world has just given away beneath his feet.
“Why do you ask?” Steve croaks mournfully, even though he already knows the answer.
He gets whiplash from his own thought process for a second, his subconscious taking him off guard not for the first time in this many months. He
Why would Tony
(Don’t cry.)
He looks – Steve almost drinks in the sight of him, all the small differences, like it’s the oxygen he has been so desperately missing in the past few days. The grayish tint to his hair, the worry lines on his face, the sag on his stance – there is defeat to him, just like Steve knows there is to himself, to all of them; And it kills him a little to remember that Tony was out there for hours, with Spiderman and the other guy Bruce had told them about, the guardian of the Time Stone – and now Tony is back here
The man, Fury, actually gives him a small smile.
In all honesty, seeing Vision again is
It’s dangerous, out there. Tony has to actively remind himself he has more to worry about for now. In here. Lots and lots to worry about.
, of leaving civilians to fend for their own out of some disgusting sadistic amusement, it only proves more and more what Tony suspected for so many years, only to be proven right, over and over again, since 2016.
He cannot let himself fall now, there is no time.
Somewhere at the back of his head, Steve wonders how it could be so easy. He knows better than to underestimate Natasha and her incredible skills, but this is a facility built to keep even the most capable and strong locked up, and its systems shouldn’t be so quick to being brought down. He wonders, silently, if Natasha stole something that allowed easier access. Something of Tony’s. It sounds like something she would’ve done.
(Cutting
Tony pauses. He doesn’t know if Bruce is referring to DC, or to New York – but Bruce had been watching from the Jet, with Nebula and Rocket, and maybe he had noticed the strong ozone smell like Tony had. Or maybe he noticed here, when he stepped out of the Jet, when Tony was too out of it to realize it.
“And if we don’t find Wong, I don’t know if we’ll have anything on the Time Stone either.” Bruce recalls.

With no small amount of hesitation, Pepper takes a step back from it, and looks shocked when it responds so efficiently. She whips her head back and looks at him, confused and says, in a tone Tony has heard far too many times not to recognize:

The armor is no longer on the landing pad so when the Quinjet finally reaches the building and hovers above the platform, it drifts lower and lower smoothly, not a single waver in its balance or trajectory, so elegant it’s nearly a mockery – but the swirl of the wind and the dust are hitting his skin like lashes of a whip, violent and cold, blowing the dirt directly into his dry, tired eyes.

Tony waits, and waits, waits for what it feels like an eternity, bullets ricocheting off his armor as easy as anything, but he’s adrenaline is running so high that he’s panicking and he can’t stop it.
It’s fake. His reassurance, his poor attempt at lightness, it’s all fake.
“We knew it was a possibility.” Steve concedes. “But that doesn’t mean it’s
That he fears that Tony is
Tony resists the childish impulse to shake his head, as if that would help him clear his thoughts any better, even when his thoughts will scatter all over the place anyway.

Tony clicks his teeth together in quick, minuscule movements, the rhythm a soft distraction he can redirect his anxiety to while he thinks. “What would be strong enough?”
“What does that have to do with the Accords?” Natasha’s brows scrunch together, so intensely it makes her whole face turn into a grimace. “They thought he had bombed a United Nations conference. As far as they knew, they were trying to stop a terrorist. In Bucharest, the
what kind of metal we can find in asteroids and meteorites. We could find everything here just fine, or we could make it. What sort of metal could it be?”
“You want them to stop jumping the line?” Tony asks. “Make it an electric fence, and they will stop jumping over.”
Pepper doesn’t accept that.
“Okay. No responding to calls.” Barton affirms, crossing his arms in a thoughtful, if only slightly defensive stance. “Then what do we do when a call comes in?”

Rhodey sighs heavily. “She’s right.”
“He was, until we left. He… He made me this.” Thor swings the axe around, throwing it quickly in the air before catching it again, as if he’s still getting acquainted with the weight of it. “He said he’d rather stay at the forge and wait for our return. But with Thanos’ decimation, I don’t know if he survived. Or even if he could forge another Gauntlet. Thanos took his hands away.”
“What does that have to do with anything?” Tony asks.
“Oh.” Shuri exhales softly under her breath, as if she had just had an epiphany. “I see.”
He remembers it very clearly, because Steve had never lived anything like that before. Not being stared down by someone who clearly wants to beat him up, no; But being so shaken himself to the point losing control, to let his ego blind him so completely that he had been ready to goad a supposed

After a heartbeat, Tony raises one hand, palm up, pulling back his tracksuit so he can expose the inside of his forearm to Nebula to inspect, despite the fact that the marks have long faded away, many, many months ago.

– in Vienna and holding back the UN and finding Rogers and Wilson, all at once, it wasn’t the best scenario to build a nice and cohesive workflow, but Tony had seen enough. Enough to trust that she is good at her job, and a good person.

It felt… way too real. I wasn’t ready for that.” Clint exhales harshly, rubbing his forehead for a moment before turning back to Steve, a determined look in his eyes. “I don’t want to be an asshole, ok? I’m not trying to. I think she’s a good kid and I want to help her. But when that happened… Steve, I can’t pretend this isn’t some serious shit. I guess I didn’t know, or I was just… I didn’t think it was
There’s a sigh, deep and resigned, a sound Tony shouldn’t be as proud to recognize so easily from Rhodey’s lips, but he does. “Alright.” Rhodey says, “I’ll be there soon. Gimme five hours.”
“Don’t worry, we won’t leave anything behind.” Steve assures him, completely confident in his words, while he stares at the window, as if he could see Natasha return if he looked for her hard enough. But he can’t. Their room faces the outskirts of the city, close enough to an abandoned industrial complex that if the necessity arises, they would have a place to escape to. Their rooms are always right in the middle of the building, never top floor, never street level, because they need the option of running up
“What, get kicked out the Archives?” Tony laughs, eyebrow arched. “Is it not enough that you cause me minor injuries, Rogers? Now you want to employ Mockingbird to do it?”

The very same Steve Rogers that’s been looking at him nonstop ever since he stepped off the Quinjet, and is walking closer, and closer, and Tony hates that he still feels a little waver of unease and apprehension at the sight of Roger’s figure stepping straight in his direction, with nothing but a hard, cold stare in his eyes, back so stiff and hands clenched into fists, like he’s going to battle.
Not in the bunker.
that, when it happened?
Bruce looks down at him with something akin to muted pity in his eyes, a mellow, sad sympathy; And Tony realizes that despite being away for the past two years, there is understanding of Tony’s reaction in his gaze. Knowing. Bruce must have realized, somewhere during the small time he and the others had been reunited after two whole years, even if he barely spend any time at all with Vision and Wanda compared to them, what that request must have meant.

“Is everything alright?”
“The magical weapons we use to defend the Sanctums, the shields, the spells – they are all influenced by energy collected from another dimension. From a part of the universe ordinary men cannot see, but live with every day. It’s what allows us to open portals, to enchant weapons, and to alter reality.” Wong clarifies, gesturing into the air the same way Thor does, when he’s talking about magic Tony really doesn’t understand.
“Woah, there. Nice to know you think so highly of me, Cap.” Clint scoffs, pushing the glass away and turning his body to face Steve, pushing out his chest and making himself even larger, an unconscious gesture to demonstrate he is not cowering before Steve’s piercing glare. “Of

Thor slumps heavily on his seat, while both Bruce and Rocket flail confusedly, and Romanov whips her head towards Rogers so sharply is a marvel she doesn’t hurt herself. Nebula’s back goes as stiff as a board, her eyes hot as coal,
Steve has ever seen, and Steve’s blood roars with anger so hot and quick he can feel the way it’s melting him from the inside out.

But he won’t.
“How am I still wearing pants?” Tony muses out loud, nonsensically, and then, a beat later – legitimately confused, even if he still sounds a little winded. And it’s a good question. When he thinks about it, he has woken up in a hospital enough times to know he should’ve been wearing one of those flimsy hospital gowns, not

He’s an engineer. His hands itch for a solution, an inkling of an idea at the back of his head whispering plans and numbers in his fitful sleep, and it never stops, never lets him rest peacefully, because it’s always there teasing him about something grand and perfect, that’s always just out of his reach.

“Not everything is lost.” Thor replies, with unsurprising determination, but a voice that almost hovers at the edge of fury. “The Stones are mysterious. Maybe we just can’t discover their secret just yet.”
“It’s over three hundred tons of chemical compound in the atmosphere in less than twenty-four hours.” Tony explains, knowing that Pepper will follow along, all of her familiarity with the environment-friendly policy of SI being twisted into something horrifying right before her eyes. “Not counting plants, animals, and the crap that got loose in accidents. Smoke, fire—” He waves his hands dismissively, although the weight on his shoulders is anything but irrelevant.
“And I just had
Maybe.
In and out.
Tony feels a reassuring hand on his shoulder, and he’s surprised to see it’s Natasha, not Rhodey, when he looks over to see, and he forces out a tight smile at her to affirm that he’s okay, even though he can feel his hands start to tremble, the stress and the anxiety finally wearing him down.
It was what the sky looked like when they left the hospital, just like that. Filled with smoke and sulfur and clouds, blocking the sun, drenching the soil in gloom.

That’s why…
A single moment in time where they both could pretend to be okay.
He is not heartless, not at all. Nor he is saying that emotions and fragile thoughts are useless.
“I am sorry for the abruptness of my visit, but I came here because I have some information that might be of your interest.” He informs, giving them all a look, to make sure they are all listening carefully. “I have been informed that Mr. Lang, the man codenamed Ant-Man, has successfully returned to the United States, as was his intention. His surrender peaceful and there were no disturbances, and all procedures following his arrest are according to protocol and he is now waiting for trial.  I was asked to pass along this message, as this information will not be divulged to public for at least a few weeks further.”
It sounds like a lie. No, not a lie. But definitely not the whole truth.
Nebula makes a thoughtful pause. “What is it powered by?”
“I’m… at
of his feelings, of his care, when Tony couldn’t get a single drop of that affection from his father. Jarvis had never yelled or confronted Howard, not in a way that would cause a great disturbance in the house; But Jarvis’ rebellion had been there, just silent, in his sneaking Tony out of the house to play in the gardens when it was forbidden, in his meaningful advice when no one else would hear the stupid concerns of a ten-year-old genius, his small and secretive smile, that had managed to keep him safe when the house felt empty.
“Yeah, I mean…” Sam makes a vague gesture. “They stayed together a lot in the Compound.”
The day comes. But not as he wished it would.
“I understand, Mrs. Stark.”
It’s not… It’s not Rhodey’s fault. Tony’s issues, that is. It’s not his fault for pushing Tony – Tony knows he is a handful. And Rhodey is right to ask, it’s not like he has no reason to be concerned. But still.
Tony is still for a second too long, frozen and distant, and Dum-E makes an inquiring noise, turning his claw at him.
“Steve?” Natasha asks, immediately on high alert, her hand automatically dropping to her pocket where she has a small switchblade hidden.
Oh, but he will. He knows what Tony’s punches feel like now.
And the Time Stone with him. The Time Stone, that Strange and Wong were supposed to protect.
Not that Thor had ever been vengeful, or kept grudges, no – with a brother like that, Tony can’t imagine grudge is something Thor could hold very well, but…

Laura had been an agent too, but she transitioned from that life to a civilian one with apparent ease. She fit in. And Clint’s children, still so young and innocent, they probably wouldn’t understand why Clint felt the need to help, despite his promise. Steve feared what could happen between all of them.
Steve… Steve didn’t complain when they put Loki inside that thing.
That answer doesn’t reassure Bruce as Tony expected it would. In fact, it seems to make him more nervous.
Almost like—
But she is young, as she still hasn’t learned.
“We’ll just have to be convincing.” Rogers decides. “Maybe General Okoye is not willing to listen, but I believe Shuri would be. She seemed… understanding – from what I could tell.”
His entire body is begging him to go, to stay away, to get up and
“I hope you’re right.” Bruce murmurs, as he stands back up, and he looks Tony straight in the eye – and his words, suddenly, seem like a plea.
“I’m sorry.” Wong ruefully says, and he sounds like he really means it. “There isn’t much I can do to help you at this point. The translation would take a long time, which I’m sure you can find ways to make it faster, and I cannot leave the Sanctum unguarded. As much as the world may need allies now, against Thanos, there are still other beings out there who have not attacked, but will, if we are more vulnerable. I cannot let that happen.”
doesn’t make any sense.
, Steve?” Sam inquires exasperated.
Tony knows chaos.
Steve tells himself he will let it go. He will not fight about it. He will not try to stop his teammates who choose to sign them, even if he cannot agree with the Accords still. Steve will still be hiding, because he didn’t back down when he was asked, and he still won’t back down now. He will fight, when he can. But he won’t let anyone get hurt. No more trading lives. And despite the fact that he already is trespassing, that he already is inside a country who doesn’t want him here, he will wait and pray, every single day, until the day the people ask him to come back.
Tainting his symbol, his shield, his—
“I’m serious.”
“You know why I’m asking.”

Tony had forgotten about them. They don’t deserve to be here. They don’t deserve to be hearing this.

Steve halts because he still doesn’t know, truly. He doesn’t what he should do when he steps out of the Quinjet doors. There are so many words that have been trapped inside his chest, so many things he wish he could say but he physically doesn’t feel able to – and he’s afraid, even if he won’t admit it, he’s afraid of seeing Tony again after so long and somehow realize they are now strangers.

, Rogers, Romanov, all of them, even Rhodey. Rhodey, the only face he has the slightest hope to accurately read amidst this chaos, whose features are clouded in concern, but not raging, angry concern – just concern, and Tony wishes he wasn’t so well acquainted with the expression to know the difference.
Or maybe he should just stay here and let himself waste away. He doesn’t want to get up. His body won’t do more than flinch and tremble, muscles spasming with discharges of adrenaline, stiff and cramping, as he can’t do anything other than let tears spill and try uselessly to take a breath with his aching lungs – and maybe he should let it. It’s like moving will make it real. It’s like allowing himself to use his body will remind him he still has one, that the universe hasn’t stilled in its axis, although it does feel like it has. Moving will mean thinking, and thinking will mean acknowledging that this is
? Why aren’t you here?”
Tony takes in a deep breath, closing his eyes for a moment to gather himself, and honestly, he’s thankful Rhodey lets him do it without interruption. When he opens his eyes, he dares to look at his best friend – and Rhodey looks back with those eyes, soft with concern, the dark color shining with a twinge of fearful worry that makes Tony’s heart ache with the sad realization he’s the one who put that there, the one making Rhodey worry.
“They stole her research, actually.” Thor complains, but he doesn’t dwell on it long enough for anyone to interrupt him. “The problem with any sort of translation of knowledge is that every time, some of the information is lost on the way. I can’t explain the magic of Asgard in a way that will fully make sense because you insist on dividing that knowledge in categories, when for us, it’s all part of a whole.”

He doesn’t care.
“We’ll start from the basics.” Tony leads. “Infinity Stones. What do we know?”
“I know.” Tony says, and he’s surprised to find out that he means it.
Tony feels better knowing Rhodey is here.
(If he were to keep counting, he might have counted Clint as the next one.)
“You would know.” Tony jabs, through a false smirk - if he dares to stretch his lips too wide, there will be too many bared teeth to disguise it as a smile.

Maria gets up, holding her robe around herself with her left hand, reaching for Howard’s extended one with her right. His hands are warm. He holds her gently by her fingers, leading her upstairs with a spring to his step, and the smile under his mustache is wicked and juvenile. It makes her feel a little nostalgic, lost in memories of a younger Howard Stark, terrible flirt, ambitious scientist, the brilliant man who married her and promised to give her the world.
“If you know that” Natasha snarls. “Why didn’t you tell Tony before?”

“Howard…” Maria tries to take a step back, but her body won’t move. She’s shivering from head to toe, eyes brimming with tears, so overwhelmed with emotion she’s not sure what she’s feeling at all. It’s almost too much for her already bruised heart to bear. Howard leaves the keyboard, moving to stand behind her, and he guides her down to the chair with gentle hands on her shoulders, rubbing his thumbs delicately on the tense line of her nape.

They are all so exhausted. They have survived the end of the world, an what for? What good did it do, to be lucky enough to dodge the bullet? There’s no real way to feel grateful for still being alive when you know so many people are gone,  and it doesn’t matter if some of your loved ones survived – they can be relieved for each other, but not for themselves.
The sky is
So, in the next day, Tony buys a private island.
He doesn’t know how long he waits. It was probably just for a few minutes, but it felt like hours. He’s not sure. His perception of time is not the best now after so many months on the run, losing himself to a measure of time that is not based on hours or minutes, but on the awareness of the population around them; and now he’s here, in a place where everyone knows who he is and he doesn’t have to hide, he’s definitely feeling thrown off. He tries to breathe in deep and enjoy the sweet aroma of the flowers, to observe the way the sun goes through the paper-thin leaves and reflect on the ground, trying to lose himself in thoughts of hues and tones, but it’s useless.
Nebula lets him out of the hold of her arms, her expression sour and offended, borderline enraged, and growls at him, “You think I’m

If Steve could drop everything right at this moment and go back home, he would.
It’s easier, then, to focus on Nebula. Selfishly, he thinks the awkwardness between her and the others helps. He’s not grateful for it, but when he sees her sitting a little further away from the others, with the raccoon,
It’s complicated. It’s very, very complicated. The thing is – he understands

Natasha shrugs, but not in a lighthearted way. Her face is impassive, her lips pressed tight together and her posture tense. “It’s a start. Anything besides the Raft is negotiable, so as long as he’s not trapped there, we’re good.”
He wonders what it means, that she has extended this habit to him as well.

, directly and clearly, eyes unblinking. He knows what he’s doing, and Tony’s trapped under his stare. Trapped under his stupid, ridiculous honesty. “Sorry for all that’s happened. If I refused to listen. We fucked up. But I really wanna make this right. And there’s no one I’d trust most to do this with than all of you.”
Tony has never been so enraged in his
“Yes, but it doesn’t matter now, Bruce.” Tony reminds him, sadly. “Vision isn’t here.”
And something blooms in Tony’s chest, something strong and all-encompassing, that twists in a knot that entangles gratitude and vindication and frustration and spite all at once, an irrational cocktail that swirls and rotates like the Devil’s drink itself, promising too much, not promising enough, a bargain that has no winner or loser, no right and wrong—
“But I have people out there who might be

The end of the world is stopping them, okay. That’s true. But at this point not even that might be enough to make them stay, Tony doesn’t fucking know. He’s sure having a hard time imagining this could possibly result in anything other than him having to make his plans without counting them in.
Suddenly it’s like he has been stabbed again.
And he continues to do so.

The kind of thing Jarvis and Ana had, when Tony was young. He always kind of wanted that, deep inside. If not something exactly like it, maybe something similar – Tony would have taken almost anything, at certain points. For a bit of honest companionship. But he wanted something real.

Thor makes an awful, sad expression. “My hammer was destroyed.”
“Mr. Stark, how are things up there?” Carter replies, delightfully professional and not at all taken aback. If anything is wrong, it's the way she sounds breathless, as if she’d been running right before opening her mouth.
