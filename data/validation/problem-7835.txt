And the worst part is, if Steve’s words are for Tony, then surely Tony’s own words are—
Steve just shrugged, picking the dead deer up in his mouth and ambling back to where they’d left their things, Tony trailing after him again.  Did any of this bother Steve?  It was hard to tell.  But Tony had to admit, for a second there… he’d been terrified.  Terrified that Steve was gone and in his place was a massive prehistoric cat that’d just killed something and was looking for blood.  And Tony didn’t know if Steve knew that for the briefest of moments, something else had overcome him.
Right.  Breathing is good.  Steve takes a few deep breaths, looking around, but no one seems to have paid them any heed, aside from the occasional glare directed at him and his clothes.  He looks back at Tony, who is lightly brushing a finger against one of the nudes, looking contemplative.  Then he flips back to the Peggy drawings, studying these again with just as much intensity.  “I bet you don’t find me very brave or smart,” he says softly after a long silence.
They look at each other for a long time.
"Rhodey was alive when we separated," Stark said, shaking his head again—quickly this time, as if trying to clear out his previous thoughts.  "That was about half a year ago.  See, this is the part where you come in.  We'd spent the past couple of years just trying to survive.  Rebuild.  We met a few people, some better than others.  And—I don't know.  I thought we were getting somewhere.  Hell, I even learned how to grow things.  But it was all meaningless.  People were still turning and biting other people unless you destroyed their brains.  The danger never ended.
“I think it’s beautiful,” Rogers sighed, sounding just dreamy enough for Tony to roll his eyes.  Wasn’t like Rogers could see him in the dark, anyway.  He kept on following the mural, Tony trailing behind him.  “It seems like they worshipped the sabretooths.”
Then a thought occurred to him.  "Oh, my God," he said.  "You know who Virgil was, don’t you?  And I know how."
Tony brought out the power detector, blinking at it in surprise.  Huh.  It was working again.  He made it stop beeping, then peered down at the display.  “I’m… picking up something,” he said, a bubble of hope welling up inside of him.  Was this it?  Was this what he’d been looking for?
The conversation ended after that, and Steve turned his attention outside, watching the world pass them by and eating when he got hungry.  Tony got up after some point to fiddle more with the controls, making adjustments as necessary, and for a little while, Steve could pretend the world was okay.
There was still nothing but silence.  Steve chanced a glance up at Tony, whose expression was… pained?  When their eyes met, Tony quickly looked away, swallowing.  "Steve," he said at last.  "I would have given up anything to hear you say these things ten years ago."
"Please don't," Natasha said.  "This Tveria of yours… it's no missile, is it?"
The words sting, but Steve can’t quite bring himself to believe them.  Not yet.  “I don’t know about that,” he replies softly, and Tony stops squirming in his arms.  Sensing that maybe Tony’s going to start listening, he presses on—“Tony, I know it’s hard.  I know that for some crazy, insane reason, your fiancée only wants you for your money, and your father isn’t proud of anything you do.  I don’t know why, because I—I can’t understand how anyone can look at you and not see what I do.”  He sighs, glancing away for a moment.  “And I also know that no matter what your father does or says, he’s still your father.  And that’s not the sort of thing you can easily ignore.  But Tony… if you keep on listening to him, you’re going to die.  Maybe not physically, not for a long time.  But the rest of you… everything that I’ve come to like about you… that’s gonna burn out.  And you’ll be empty, and I can’t watch that happen.  All I want is for you to be happy, Tony.  That’s it.”
Natasha didn't say anything for a moment, but then she straightened, holding her hands up in surrender.  "I need your help," she replied at last.
As always, though, all he brought was himself.  He supposed the least he could offer was to help Steve out, so he went about doing just that.  Perhaps having anticipated a possible switch, Steve had clearly labeled everything, so Tony didn't need to figure out on his own what was needed of him.  There wasn't all that much left in the house at this point - Ma's room, in fact, was completely empty, and the sight of it bothered him enough that he shut the door so he wouldn't have to look in there anymore - and Tony quietly lugged what little remained into the trash for disposal, taking frequent breaks whenever breathing got too hard.
Cap stared at a spot above Tony's head.  "She told me that she saw a Japanese bomber take out a Navy ship.  She knew some of the people on there.  They all died.  The Allies were able to shoot down the bomber later, but it didn't undo the damage.  So when she started flying the airship… well, she was overzealous because she wanted to make sure the fighter didn't take us out.  Turns out unpredictability and determination are a dangerous combination, and she actually shot it down."
If that last bit of the voicelog was anything to go by, though, it seemed like he'd still have to keep an eye out.  It was strange, the thought of having a Pa again. His own had passed away so long ago. But he'd deal with it when the time came.
“It’s alright,” Steve says.  He looks very resolute, even though Tony knows he
had been on
.  They’d been close, so close, with less than a day to go.  And then Steve had to run off.
Collectively, the four of them froze for a second, then turned to the door.  It now stood open, Fury standing in the doorway looking unfairly majestic.
Steve tsks softly, but with one last stroke, he lets him go, looking up at him expectantly.  Tony curses again.
Steve, even if his eyes had gone kind of weird.  “Thank God,” he said, standing up and heading into the clearing.  “Why did you—”
“Relax,” Tony says.  “I’m not going to show these to everyone.  Though I have to ask, are you—”
“I know,” Tony breathes, and he presses a kiss to Steve’s temple, his forehead, his nose.  “I will.  But not without you.”
"If it helps, I don't think I have an official title anymore," Steve offered.  "I'm just Steve."
Again, Steve just shrugged, getting up onto his feet.  Tony sat up as well, wondering if they were going to take off again when Steve just walked straight into the pond.  “Steve?” he asked.  “What are you doing?”  He looked like he was just… swimming?  “Well, okay,” Tony said, once it was clear that Steve had no intention of answering him.  “Just don’t take too long in there, alright?  We kind of have a deadline.”  With that, he laid back down, going back to staring at the clouds.
He looked to the edge of the ravine, then at Rogers, then back to the ravine.  It was too far for Tony to jump, but maybe Rogers could make it…?  “What do you think?” Tony asked.  “Is this a jump you can make?”
"Beautiful," Tony said, watching as the city passed by.  "Maybe we could make it all the way to Bethesda on this train.  Wouldn't that be something?  Our journey could practically be over."
, Steve had written the day before Tony had found his stash of booze cleared out.  Tony had been annoyed - okay, maybe he still was, because who poured away perfectly good alcohol - but it hadn't been worth fighting Steve over it, so while he still drank when out with people, he hadn't replenished his cabinet.  And maybe this line right here was the start of it all, an addiction that would last the rest of his life. Steve's dad had died when Steve was young - so how bad must it have been for it to have made such an impression on a child?
Tony thinks that maybe there’s something more in his words beyond literal flying, and he thinks that maybe he knows what the other man means by it.  So he nods slowly, kissing the bit of Steve’s finger against his mouth.  “I promise,” he says.
"Sure," Cap said, and he disappeared through the tent flap.
But Steve kept talking over him.  He was done listening. "I don't know anything about you except that you like to yell a lot.  And I'm not like that. I - I act like I don't listen sometimes. But I do listen. And I innovate and invent and I help when I can - "
Steve hesitated, then nodded, unwilling to fight him on this.  He badly wanted to know how his home had fared, but maybe Tony was right.  Maybe it was better to remember it the way it had been.  Not that his home had ever been particularly pure and clean, but at least it'd been
“I’m fine,” Rogers replied.  “Wait here, I’ll be right back.”
Tony holds back his sigh.  How exactly had Steve persuaded him to not jump again?  “Of course,” he says wearily.  The merger.  It’s the only thing Sunset cares about, no matter how much she tries to pretend otherwise.  Money and power—and she’ll have it all once they’re married.  “Let’s go back, then.  Steve… it’s been a pleasure speaking with you.”  He takes Sunset’s arm, but finds himself lingering.  Steve is like no one he’s ever met before, and somehow… he doesn’t want him to disappear back into steerage, where he’ll never see him again.
The people were the 95th Infantry Division.  The place was Liepzig, Germany. The time was April 23, 1945.
“Night,” Rogers said right back, and damn him, he didn’t sound tired at all.
Cap looked out the window.  "We're in Xi'an proper," he said.  "I found you in the airship and I carried you here.  It was a few miles away.  I don't know much Chinese, but they were willing to help.  For all I know it's just a matter of time before the Japanese soldiers stationed here learn about us, but it was more important to get you some medical attention."
Tony shakes his head quickly, taking his hand again.  “We’re not going to hide it,” he says, and despite his own nervousness, the way it makes Steve light up makes it worth it.  Besides, by now they’ve probably already found the drawing he’d stowed in the safe, so what’s the point?  He leans forward, kissing Steve briefly on the lips.  “Come on.”
The second was that Steve was real, he was from 1940, and Tony's - soul, or
Steve nodded, and Jarvis left, leaving him alone and still vaguely confused in the dining room.  But sitting here pondering wasn't going to help him much, so eventually he got up and went to wash his plate.  The thought of playing with the roast box (or microwave, whatever) again occurred to him, but he was half-afraid that doing so would somehow summon Jarvis, who would then promptly rap him on the knuckles with a ruler.
Tony growled and drew back from the door, slamming it shut before pushing the rifle aside.  Immediately after, there was a muffled thumping sound as biters tried to get in.  "Ran out of bullets," he said.  "I thought I could shoot them all down, but there were more than I expected.  Where did they even come—"  He cut off then, his lips parting in surprise as he turned to Steve.  "The room's on fire."
to him?”
Tony’s too curious for his own good.  Before he can stop himself, he blurts out the most subtle thing he can think of on short notice: “Jan wants to know what your words are.”  Smooth.
It was when they were leaving Milford, Connecticut—or at least, what once was Milford, and was now a silent memorial of deserted apartments and crumbling office buildings like so many others—that they finally encountered one of the herds Steve had heard of, but never seen for himself.
"Expecting us," Tony repeated, turning the words over in his head.  There was something nagging at him, but he wasn't sure what.  His body still ached too much for him to really focus, which was annoying.  Cap had offered him painkillers, but Tony had turned them down.  "It could be that he's tracking the airship?"  He had, of course, equipped it with stealth technology, but maybe it had somehow failed or become damaged.  If the ship could be repaired after all this mess, he'd have to look into it.
“Hey, you big ugly brute,” he called, bringing up his gauntlet and firing.  The sabretooth yelped—
Steve tilted his head ever so slightly, and the light his hair caught in that movement made him look like an angel.  "Shouldn't I get to decide that myself?" he said.
“Yeah,” Tony replies, committing Steve’s image to memory as he stands here now, looking noble and beautiful and
"Move the train!" Steve shouted.  He threw his shield, angling it so that it would knock the nearest biter to the side of the tunnel, then repeated it for the next closest biter.
It’s almost ridiculous, how much events in the distant past that he can’t even remember still haunt him.
about him so much?  “Y-you’re ridiculous,” he manages.  Nonetheless, he reaches out, taking hold of Steve’s hands as he continues, “I-I’m blaming you i-if the raft f-flips over.”
No politics, Tony thinks.  No guilt.  No shame.
Cap leveled a glare at him.  "I'm spraying it now," he said, then actually did so.  Tony winced as he felt it, his toes curling and his fingers clenching, but he managed to refrain from making any sound.  "You okay?"
"And you build something with the tables and chairs—"
He made himself press the play button again.  God, he was never going to get through it all at this rate.
Steve frowned.  "I have my shield," he said.  "And Tony has a rifle."
, okay, he would really like Tony to have sex with him right about now.  “Come on,” he urges.  “I want more.  Don’t you?”
"We can check," Cap sad.  He brought the piece out again and pushed it around on his palm, but it didn't do anything of interest.
.  There were the occasional odd magnetic field readings that upon closer inspection were completely explainable by non-supernatural reasons, and other strange readings that turned out to be volcanic geysers or something like that—as reckless as Tony was, he had enough sense to stay away from
Steve waits all morning for Tony to come down to the third-class deck, busying himself by sketching some of the people nearby, but the other man doesn’t appear.  So around noon, he leaves his spot and starts walking around the ship, trying to see if he can find him.
It was an astute observation, and Tony was both surprised and pleased that Cap had put it forward.  "You're not wrong," he said.  "Alright.  We're all still carrying our transceivers, right?  No one lost theirs on the way over?  Replacements cost extra."  Rhodey rolled his eyes, which was a good enough sign for Tony to continue on.  "If Cap sees trouble, he'll send out the distress signal.  As long as we're not too far away, our transceivers will start vibrating out SOS."  He had to admit, the idea was something he was pretty proud of.  It was quieter than audio and wouldn't force the receiver to have to pay constant attention like they would have if it were visual.  "If that happens, we regroup and go from there.  Hopefully, that doesn't actually happen.  What I'd prefer is that one of us finds something useful, and we send the signal for
Ty stared at the donut, looking as though he wanted to say something, but then thought better of it.  "Really?" he said instead. "Damn it. I knew I could have done better."
Tony didn't give a damn about history.
Tony stared at him.  "Well, you're asking
Cap blinked at him a few times, then seemed to remember what he was doing, cutting the piece of gauze off and taping the end together.  "Oh," he said.  "Thanks, Mr. Stark.  Um.  Tony."
When Tony stops his heart, the other suit goes down as well, and he thinks to himself as the world blacks out around him that if he somehow makes it out of this alive, he can tell Steve
Birch opened his hand, letting the ruined remote drop onto his lap.  He looked utterly unconcerned with everything that was happening.  "You have one minute left," he said.  "Godspeed."
is going to tag along and help us steal things."
"Gone," Cap settled on at last.
For what seems like an eternity, they just stare at each other, and Tony struggles to figure out what his father is thinking.  There’s anger in his eyes, yes, but… something more.  Something Tony can’t quite make out.
"When the outbreak happened, a lot of us boarded the airship—you remember the airship, don't you—and we took off, hoping to figure out what to do in relative safety."  Stark rubbed his forehead then, his gaze dropping to the table.  When he spoke next, his voice was a monotone.  "Jarvis had a heart attack.  We couldn't save him.  He died.  That was what we thought, anyway, until he got back up and he started attacking people.  Obviously we had to land the airship and evacuate, because he and everyone he bit would have turned us all otherwise. I got away with Rhodey in the suit."  Stark's voice remained as monotonous as ever, but Steve could see his fists clench.  "But we got separated from Pepper.  Rhodey and I split up to find her.  It didn't work.  It's been one thousand, five hundred twenty-seven days since I last saw her."
really
He thought about the arguments they’d had the first few days after they’d landed, of the way they’d sniped and snarked at each other, and then he thought about his heart, beating steadily now in his chest, seemingly cured of whatever illness had stricken it.  Then he thought again of Steve, of the way he’d looked at Tony as he told him about what had happened to his heart, and of the way he’d wrapped his arm around him and held him close.  At some point, Steve had crossed the line from
“Believe me, I know,” Steve manages.  He experimentally shifts a little, but he doesn’t think his body is quite up for the movement yet, so he stops and takes a deep breath.  “Yeah.  Give me a moment.”
"That's ridiculous," Steve said, flushing a little.  He'd done no more or less than the rest of them!
"No," Steve replied almost immediately.  "Tony, the man was building weapons and he was trying to blow us all up.  I don't really care how you treated him.  What he did has no excuse."
“I hate waiting,” Tony tells him.
The sound of bullet fire rang out, and Pepper let out a breathless gasp as dust sprang up in front of them, a result of the bullets hitting the ground nearly at their feet.  The only good thing was that the plane couldn't keep up these kinds of close calls for long, not when it was moving so much faster than them; it turned away after it passed overhead, presumably to circle back and try again.  "We gotta get rid of it," she managed.
"Right," he made himself reply, once he'd remembered that it was probably his turn to say something.  "So.  Rigged tiles and arrows.  Since we don't want to die, we're going to have to figure out which tiles are safe and which ones aren't."
So he got up, changed into what looked like a standard service uniform since that was set out already - why wasn't the Captain America suit out, he wondered - and headed outside to get his bearings.  Unsurprisingly, given that he'd woken up in a run-down building, it seemed like he was currently in a city that had been recently bombed, and now maybe their men were occupying it. Some of them were milling about, and Tony followed them to a makeshift cafeteria to get some food as he listened in.
Tony laughed then.  It was just a quiet, breathless chuckle at first, but then it got louder, longer, and before he knew it, he was laying back on the floor, eyes squeezed shut in mirth.  For
"Then maybe I should start at the beginning," Tony said softly, staring at his feet.  "Zolpidem, ethanol, methylchloride, and ophentonyl.  Do you know what those are?"
deranged son of a man from his past, when things are going to get better.
"And you did," came the gentle reply.  "You did great, Ms. Potts."
“So you know, I’ve been waiting this whole time for you to offer me some,” Tony said casually after a while, needing to hear more than the sounds of Steve eating an animal he’d killed.  “Where are your manners?”
Steve blinks at him—slowly, like even that small effort is too much work for him—but then he nods and quirks his lips.  “S-sure,” he says.  “W-what about?”
"Can we go around them?"
How predictable of her to care more about his money than him.  It’s almost charming, except for the part where it’s kind of depressing.  Why does his father like her so much?  “Like I said, no one robbed anything.  Just let it go, okay?”
Once he made it to the top, he burst into the igloo-thing, blinking and looking around.  This one was different from the others.  At the other end was a wide hole, like a window without glass, perfectly positioned so that he could see the setting sun through it.  In the middle sat a pedestal with something that looked like—well, a glove, which made so little sense Tony decided not to spend too long dwelling on it.  And there, lying in front of the pedestal…
And then the impossible happens.  One moment, Tony’s still sitting there on the boat, breaking eye contact to look at his father, and the next—the next—
"This wasn't your fault," Tony replied, and in that instant, Steve knew the worst had happened.  Tony rolled up one sleeve to reveal his wrist, which had been hastily wrapped with a piece of his own shirt.  "I'm sorry, Steve."
Tony felt like his brain was shutting down.  He needed to react, but he didn't know
of it.  And though he knew rationally that yeah, he could likely always come back later, they were already deep inside.  Besides, who knew how much time he had left?  Would there even be a
“Close.  But…”  Steve can’t help it anymore.  He really can’t.  Tony looks so damn inviting, and Steve finds him impossible to resist.  So he stands up and walks over to him as the other man arches an eyebrow.  Steve grins.  He’s not going to let Tony be the
Tony didn't know if he should be relieved or not.  Jarvis wasn't the dead person here, but it meant that the enemy had been on the ship.  And maybe Jarvis was elsewhere.  He didn't know.  But he had to keep looking.
Natasha's lips quirked upward.  "No," she agreed.  "I hope this isn't the last time we see each other."
“Relax,” Tony coos.  “I’m just joking.  Kind of.”  Not really.  “Oh, look.  My father’s sitting down.”  They seem to have chosen a smaller table—Sunset looks annoyed and his father looks angry.  Maybe Sunset’s just told him about Tony’s dinner guest.  “Okay, last chance, Rogers.  You can still escape the madness.”
And that, more than anything else, is what weighs on him the most tonight.  He doesn’t want to die, sure, but he’s chained to this pole and neither of them is going anywhere, and he can already see water seeping into the room.  So okay, fine, he’s going to die, and that’s bad.  But what’s
“Dammit,” Rogers breathed from somewhere above him, quickly scrambling off and laboriously shoving the cat’s body off him.  “Stark.  Tony.  Are you okay?”
him, even if he hadn’t explicitly spelled the words out.  Him!  A hot mess of neuroses and personal issues from his youth—
"I never said that," Cap replied, which earned him startled looks from the others, who had started to nod along.  "I think you should come."
"I'm stroking your hair," Cap said.  He looked—thoughtful, it seemed, which was kind of a strange expression in this context.  "That's what we do to people who are sick or hurt."
"The liquor store.  Gotta stock up, right?  And hopefully you won't destroy all your booze like you did at the end of last school year."
Natasha didn't answer at first, instead watching Tony as he looked at the papers, his eyes widening again.  "These are blank," he said.  "Where are the Tveria blueprints?"
Tony shrugs.  “If it’s funny.”
It was hard to tell, but Cap looked… confused?  Which was odd, since Cap was the one who'd taken the initiative to let himself into Tony's tent.  "I wanted to see the fragment."
"Sure," Steve said, bending over to pick up a bottle of pills.  "Here—"
.  He’d wanted to see Tony break free and live his own life, but now he fears that’ll never happen.
in one of their notebooks.”
There is silence for a long moment before Jan steps up to stand beside Tony, looking down into the rippling ocean.  “One era ends.  And a new one begins.  We’re going to have to accept that now, right, Tony?” she asks.
The other guy seemed unbothered, throwing an arm around Tony's shoulders once he was close enough and starting to steer them toward one of the buildings.  Okay, not a page, then. "I've been looking for you. You wouldn't believe what I managed to snag for the boys."
Right.  He didn't get this far by not taking risks.  "You know," he continued, "The Nazis are always looking for things.  Going all over the world.  Trying to find items they can use against us."
"You never need to thank me for anything," Steve said.
After a moment of consideration, Tony sits down as well and looks over at Steve, who has picked up one of the fallen poppies to examine it, and he wonders if he should laugh.  Probably not.  Still, to know that Steve has sought him out
From there, he heads west.  He starts a company.  He works with airplanes and electricity and radio and he changes the world.  When the Great War rolls around, he fights as a pilot.  And when the next world war shakes the earth, he spends his days designing fighter jets for the United States, and he is famous and immortalized and loved by a nation.
Either way, the coast was clear, and Tony made a run for the other end, which was still going up in flames.  He was cut short when a lone figure burst out of nowhere and crossed his path, and he was just about to raise his gauntlets when he realized—it was
To his surprise, Rogers didn’t look nearly as enthused as Tony felt.  “I have a bad feeling about this,” he said.
Eventually, though, it seems like Tony is ready to move on, because he pushes his hands away, reaching down to untuck Steve’s shirt from his pants.  “Thought you wanted me to touch you,” Steve says.
?" Cap began, but Tony started up the engines as soon as Cap was situated, and in the next second, they were zooming out over the water, Cap letting out a startled sound behind him.  "Oh, my God!" he shouted over the roar of the motor and the wind.
“You should be in the hospital,” Tony blurts out, because it’s true.  Steve had been
“Tomorrow,” Tony agrees.  He still doesn’t want to leave him, but with Sunset clinging to his arm, he doesn’t have much of a choice.  But it’s okay now.  Just imagining his father’s face when he introduces Steve will be enough to get him through the evening.  He then turns back to Sunset, lips curving upward slightly—he can’t quite bring himself to smile for her like he did for Steve only minutes ago, but it’ll have to do.  “Come on,” he tells her.  “Let’s see if they’ve broken out the brandy by now.”
No answer.  Which was a shock, really, because the snow was covered with footprints, suggesting at least somewhat recent activity in the area.  Steve stood there for a while longer and then turned away, about to give it up as a lost cause when movement from the forest caught his eye—a human, it seemed.  A woman, even.  She was dressed warmly, but her clothes were stained with blood and her gait was lumbering and awkward, suggesting some sort of leg injury.  Not wanting her to strain herself more than necessary, Steve rushed to her side, reaching out to take her hands.
Unexpectedly, Cap lit up at that, face breaking into a wide smile.  "You said
“Wake up.”
"Don't," Tony said.
And then a circular shield flew across the screen, followed by a man with a star emblazoned on his chest.
There was a long pause as the woman watched the two of them start eating.  Then she smiled.  "What can you tell me about the Tveria weapon?" she said.
guest,” Howard snaps.  He looks like he wants to say more, but Sunset’s presence is stopping him.  For once, Tony is grateful that she’s around.  After a moment, though, he seems to force himself to pull away, even though he’s still seething, then turns to Steve, eyes full of contempt.  “So, boy,” he grits out.  “Do you
"You are?" Steve pressed.
Tony blinked and shook his head, his shovel out as he continued on.  "It's nothing.  I just… was thinking, I guess.  I never had any dog tags."
Though it hurt like hell, Tony wrenched his arm free, gasping as his body shifted painfully while pulling away.  Still, it was worth it for the guilt-stricken expression he caught on Rogers’ face afterward.  That would teach the other man to get all hands-on with him.  “You’re not my boss or my superior officer or anyone I have to take orders from,” Tony snapped, glaring at Rogers.  Tony was so close now, and he wasn’t about to let some Boy Scout stop him—so with that, he spun on his heel and headed in, making his way toward the glowing light.
He suddenly wonders if coming here was a good idea.
Cap furrowed his brows at Tony.  "Just to be clear," he said, "you blame yourself for both Rhodey and Jarvis.  And probably Pepper, too."
This was better now, even if broken chair legs were still attached to his calves, but he still didn't have use of his hands.  Checking to make sure Maya wasn't getting up, Steve ran out of the room, looking down the hallway, and—there.  Not too far down was what looked like an office with a glass wall, and Steve charged toward it, bursting through the glass and hearing it shatter around him.  There were tiny flecks of blood appearing on his clothes, but he ignored them for now, turning his back toward one of the glass edges still attached to the wall and sawing apart the restraints binding his wrists together.
Steve extended his hand, looking up at him.  "Will you?" he asked.
“Nice.  You’re an artist, huh?  Can you draw me?”
Tony froze.  He still couldn't see anything, and he was pretty sure they couldn't see him, but it was clear that the other man, at least, was aware of his presence, even if Cap hadn't been.  He took a moment to consider his choices.  Stepping out and just shooting him seemed like the cleanest solution, minimizing the risk in case the man
"That car's not gonna last for long," Steve murmured.  The screaming was only winding them up further, and they were pounding into the car as hard as they could, trying to get inside.  "Ready for a fight?"
When the funeral ended, they retreated back into their room, Steve still weak from the bite and Tony in no condition to walk for long distances.  A few hours later, Natasha came in, holding out some papers.  "I believe these are yours," she said, offering them to Tony.
"Steve - " he heard her protest, but by then he'd already left for the kitchen to get what he needed.
She has a point, he supposes.  He does have every intention of looking for Steve once this dismal affair is over.  “Meditation?”
Rogers tutted and promptly pushed him back down as gently as he could.  “You can help me by getting some rest,” he said.  “You lost a lot of blood.”
"Almost not fast enough," Cap said.
, the epitome of the moral high ground—"
That was an understatement, but Steve wasn't in the mood to get flippant with her.  "He thinks people dying is a good thing."
Ma was already home by the time he got back, cooking something on the stovetop.  "It's fine," Steve said preemptively, but that didn't stop her from dropping her wooden spoon as soon as she saw him and rushing over to the icebox to hack a few pieces of ice off.
"Nothing?" Tony's Pa had all but roared.
He gazed up into the sky, searching for the sun, but it was somewhere behind the trees.  From the looks of it, though, it was nearly dusk.  If they’d interpreted those cave drawings right, then they still had two more sunsets… forty-eight hours.
"James is a common name," Steve said as gently as he could.  Tony's shoulders slumped.  Steve sighed, running a hand through his hair, then continued, "Alright, well, that's certainly very distinctive.  Navy Yard, metal arm.  We'll take a look for you."  He would have taken a look for her
"No!" Steve cried, throwing his shield hard.  It decapitated the biter, and he watched in horror as the body slumped onto the ground first, the head remaining attached to Tony's sleeve for a second longer before dropping as well, a scrap of fabric clinging to its teeth.
“I’m still trying to decide whether I’m imagining you or not,” Tony replied.  “I—here, give me a moment.”  And before he could think twice about it, he leaned forward, kissing Steve full on the lips.
.  Or rather, it
"For now."  Steve looked through as well—from what he could see, Stark was right, and the hallway beyond seemed empty.  "Stand back."  He drew his shield and then in one quick motion, shattered the glass with a loud crack that was impossible to miss.
"Oh my God," he said as his eyes popped open, and he scrambled back, nearly dropping his coffee.  There was another guy standing next to his bed, probably the same age as him but bigger. His blond hair was messy in a way that seemed almost intentional, and he was looking at Steve with a gleam in his eye that Steve wasn't entirely sure he liked.  "Who are you?!"
Stark's eyes went wide.  So he could hear it, too—the muffled, irregular thumping against the doors, as though there were bodies being jostled against it without any particular purpose.  "If everyone inside's turned, then that changes the plan."
Tony considered it for a moment, then ducked into the same igloo as Rogers, turning his flashlight off.  Better not to risk getting separated, since outside of the igloo it was completely dark.  “Okay,” he said.  “But we’re going to keep on exploring tomorrow.”
"You told me your heart was fine."
And so they headed back the way they came, making their way toward the unblocked entrance they'd used to get in.  The man who'd opened the door was still there, gazing at them coolly.  "You're Maya's guests," he said.  "What are you doing here?"
He squeezed his hand, and Tony found himself squeezing back.  "A future," Tony said, and somehow, this time he really did believe it.
Steve’s eyes widen as he sputters uselessly, and right on cue, that charming blush stains his cheeks again.  “I—what—”
“Oh.”  Well, it’d be awkward if Steve hugged him again, so he just holds still, face red.  “Anyway.  I think you deserve better than what they’re giving you.”
Cap lunged at him, but gunfire started at that exact moment and he missed, dodging out of the way.  Then more shooting—Jarvis was returning fire now, it seemed, but the airship was slower.  It was enough of a threat that the fighter would try to avoid it, but not enough where avoiding it was going to be particularly difficult.  The airship just wasn't meant for extensive aerial combat, but Tony was wondering now if he should remedy that.
He shifted the light to the left, following the progression of drawings.  First two human-looking stick figures, then a human and a sabretooth.  Then a sunrise, an arrow, and a sunset, repeated three times.  Then a tall mountain, then the human and the sabretooth standing at the top, and then two humans standing on the top.
"Yeah," Tony agreed as he idly checked his bag—he'd apparently patched it up during his turn at watch.  "Last guy I talked to was Namor.  You should probably know, though, that not all people are nice."
had happened.  There was evidence.  And come to think of it - maybe this explained some other things, like Ty's taunting before practice and the fact that none of his things were in the right place.
Luke laughed aloud at this, shaking his head.  "You're kidding me.
Tony nodded dazedly, because he was still kind of confused.  “Uh, thanks?  Right back at you.”
He sounded so certain, Tony almost believed it.  He wanted to believe it.  "Okay," he said.  He managed a smile back.  "Good."
Steve just gives him a small smile, turning to pick up the remote.  “Sorry, Shellhead,” he says.  “But some things I’m taking with me to the grave.”
Dad wasn't home today, he knew.  So whatever fight Steve and him had gotten into… Tony could avoid the fallout for now.  And if he wanted to do something
It went against everything he knew.  A more naïve him might have protested that it was immoral.  A more stubborn him might have snapped that it felt like giving up.  That no matter which way he cut it, it was wrong, and he could never do it.
Except for the part where the armor apparently knows Tony better than Tony knows himself, because mid-fight, it abruptly pulls away to pick Steve up by his head, crushing him.  Repulsor beams are useless.  Brute force will be easily countered.  Tony has a split second to decide—
Tony tried a smile, even if her appearance was worrisome.  Had she been this bad yesterday? "Only the best for you," he said, because he knew that was what Steve would have said.  Not that this was really the best by any means - it was literally just orange juice and toast, but in an attempt to channel the much more artistically-inclined person whose body he was currently occupying, he'd added a dried flower to the side of the plate - for presentation, or whatever.  Steve would be proud, maybe.
He let it drop, though.  Now that his wounds had been cleaned and re-bandaged, he was hopeful that he could get something done instead of lying here uselessly.  "Hey," he tried.  "Could you pass me my notebook?"
Reluctantly, Tony leaned forward, attention on the section for Monday, May 29th - and saw that it had already been filled in.
Damn it.  Birch still had some fight left in him, and he was using it to distract the only person who had any idea what was going on.  "Cap!" Tony called out sharply.  Cap spared a glance at him long enough to show that he'd heard, but he immediately turned away again to continue defending himself.  "You know what the passphrase is—you're gonna have to input it.  I'll take care of Birch!"
After the funeral, Jarvis took Tony home - a home, he realized, that now belonged entirely to him, and God, he wasn't ready to deal with all this yet - and ushered him into his room since it had become increasingly clear that Tony wasn't up for moving much on his own.  For a long while, Tony sat in the darkness as the night settled around him, staring at the wall. It wasn't very different from what he'd been doing during the funeral.
Tony turned back, then looked up, and for the first time he realized that there was something up there.  It looked like—it looked like another igloo-thing, maybe.  Like the ones he’d seen in the underground city, but bigger.  A giant igloo at the top of the mountain.  Was this it?  Was this where they were supposed to have wound up all along?
Her eyes darkened immediately, and Steve regretted asking.  But it was too late now, so Steve had to guiltily watch her sigh and turn her gaze away.  "He turned in as soon as we stepped inside," she said. "I should make sure he made it to bed alright.  Good night, sweetheart."
"They're somewhere safe," Jessica replied, petting Carol's hair.  "I came back to get baby formula.  What happened here?"
It all, he felt, came down to those redacted files.  The pieces—a single piece, even—did
Tinkering?  It sounded like Tony had a habit of playing around with the kitchen tools.  But Steve obviously hadn't been there for that previous conversation, so he didn't actually have any idea of what might have been said.  "I should be allowed to because it's fun?" he tried. Which was obviously
“You learn a lot of things when you’re in a war,” Rogers said softly.  “Especially when you’re in the middle of nowhere with injured men.”
this.”
Now he’s wearing this hideous ring, looking at the two of them in the mirror.  He can’t share anything with Sunset, either.  Is this really the rest of his life?  Surrounded at all times by people who couldn’t give less of a damn about the man underneath the clothes and the name?  Steve has saved him once, but he’s starting to feel like there really isn’t anything stopping him from trying again.
Steve frowned at the map, then at Tony.  "Well, what are our options, then?" he pressed.  "Are you suggesting we turn around?"
Tony cast another glance over at Cap once they were out in the open, still concerned.  It had undoubtedly been a rough landing, but Cap had surely seen worse.  They hadn't even fallen over.  But Cap looked back at him, his face all business, and Tony knew that whatever Cap was dwelling on, Tony wasn't going to hear any of it.
Tony groaned, eyes shutting again.  He needed to check on Rogers, but he’d do that in a bit.  For now, though, he was realizing that the crushing pain in his chest was gone.  Sure, there were the wounds left from the sabretooth battle earlier, but that was practically nothing in comparison.  What had changed?  He reached up, touching his chest… and then he realized something was different.  His eyes flying open, he blindly grabbed for the flashlight, picking it up and shining it on himself as he fumbled one-handedly with the buttons of his shirt.
Tony groaned and turned his head toward the sound.  It sounded like Pepper and… Cap?  They were talking for some reason, though apparently his waking up interrupted them because they suddenly went quiet.
Tony tries to explain.  Tries to tell her that he didn’t do this, that he doesn’t know what happened, that he was trying to
The first finger goes in all the way, and the second and third go in a little faster after that.  Soon enough, Steve is arching away from the leather seats, sweating and trying not to writhe as Tony curls his fingers, smirking down at him.  “Do you like that?” he purrs, fingers moving inside him.  Steve whimpers.  “God, you’re so gorgeous like this—I should get a camera and record you; I bet I could play it all day and not get tired of it—”
They left the room—there wasn't a hoard of biters waiting outside this time, so it was much easier—and headed back to the window, clear now of smoke.  Steve took care of the few biters milling about before kneeling by the window, holding up his shield.  Jessica went through, followed by Stark.  Steve was last, coming out in time to hear fabric tearing and Stark cursing.  "What happened?" he asked as he landed.
Tony nods, moving closer.  Too much of that, and Steve’s not going to have room to touch him.  “More.”
liked knowing what he put down as his homework answers for the math and science classes.  In that sense, he was quite popular. But how many of those people cared to go head-to-head with him on more challenging concepts or actually wanted to listen to him talk about microrobotics?
"—wasn't your fault.  It's okay.  It's okay."
Steve blinked and went silent for a moment, like he couldn’t quite believe what he’d heard.  “What do you mean, it’s fine?” he asked at last.
There were several more images of that first man, and Steve looked at them all, unsure what to make of it.  He could only assume they were recruitment materials from the Great War, but it was just… a strange thing to find inside Tony's contraption.
But that, Steve realized with growing horror, wasn't even the worst of it.  He held his breath for a moment, then let out a sharp exhale.  "Do you hear that?" he asked quietly.
Steve exhaled sharply and made himself let go of Tony's arms.  "I almost killed you."
Steve laughs.  “You know, somehow I’m under the impression that I’m the one who needs lessons—”  He cuts off abruptly as the world around them seems to shudder, arms tightening around Tony protectively.  “Tony,” he gasps after a moment, once the ground seems to be steady again.  “What—what was that?”
Pepper nudged Tony, then cast a meaningful glance down at Cap's clenched hand.  He immediately understood what she was trying to imply, then felt foolish for not seeing it himself earlier.  "It's fine," he said, then brought out the empty jar, holding it out to Cap.  "Do you want to put the piece back?"  He wasn't sure what was going on with the fragment, but he thought that maybe it being in close proximity with another fragment while Cap was holding onto it was messing with Cap's head somehow.  Better safe than sorry, in any case.
Nonetheless, as they spend more time together, Tony finds ways in which she surely is the one.  After all, like Thomas Paine, she’s ambitious, revolutionary.  Like the quote, she enjoys challenges, knowing that glorious, certain victory will come with enough effort.  And the more he thinks about these things, the more he’s convinced.  His words are for Sunset, and Tony thinks there’s nothing he wants more than to spend the rest of his life with her.
But that was okay.  It was only the first day, and they still had time to find
"I-I don't know!" she stammered, but Steve continued staring at her until she blurted out, "The press box!"
Tony exhales sharply, glancing off to the side.  “…I killed you, Steve,” he says.  He might not remember the specifics, but the videos of the assassination he’d seen nonetheless haunt him every night.
He’s in the process of turning back to him when he feels something in his pocket pressing against his leg.
"It's going to get harder now that we're actually heading south, and the weather's warming up," Stark said as they walked past a sign proudly proclaiming that they were entering the Moosehorn National Wildlife Refuge, not that such labels carried much meaning anymore.  "The biters don't do so well in the cold, which is why we haven't seen nearly as many as we could have.  It worked out well up to this point, but obviously that's not going to be the case anymore.  Keep your guard up, Steve."
He didn't sound particularly convincing, and Tony had to agree.  "Doesn't make sense for them to have left lit torches behind," he said.  "Something's going on."
That was enough for Tony.  Without further ado, he slithered down the rope, keeping his eyes and ears peeled for anything suspicious, but besides the light coming in from above and the shadow from Rogers’ head on him, there wasn’t much to see.  Not too long after, his feet touched the ground, and he felt around blindly for a moment, making sure everything seemed solid.  “I’m in,” he called, bringing out his flashlight and shining it up at Rogers.  “Can you see me?”
It wasn't long before they passed by Penn Station, where to Steve's surprise, Tony stopped, gazing at the building contemplatively.  "Hey," he said.  "Think there are still any trains here?"
"I thought the Soviets were our allies," Steve said.
"I hid them," said Natasha.
Change it, he'd answered, but he wondered now if that had ever been an option.
That wasn't a particularly pleasant thought, but it wasn't as though Steve hadn't had to make do without running water during the war.  "Which way we headed?" he asked.
"Or that the last piece isn't even here," Tony said darkly as Cap put the piece back in his pouch.  The Nazis having been here already could mean anything.  Maybe they'd found it.  Maybe they hadn't, and they'd given up.  Or maybe they were here for a completely different reason altogether.  "But we have to try."
for, and Tony can’t have him abandoning them to babysit him.  “So anyway, how’s your sex life?”
At that, Tony lifts his head up to stare at him, eyes wide.  “What was that?” he breathes.
Tony stared at him blankly, and then his eyes squeezed shut, bloodied fists clenching.  "Sal," he said, voice cracking.  "
"Sounds reasonable to me," Tony said.  "Let's go."
Steve stared at him, but instead of looking amused he just looked more depressed.  “What?” Tony pressed.  “Okay, that wasn’t the best choice in words.  Let me ride you.  Better?”  Steve shook his head again.
, Steve’s face goes pale, and he ends up dropping the duffel bag he’s holding, eyes wide.  “What,” he asks in measured tones, “is this?”
“Hey, I’m just a slow human,” Tony told him, jogging to catch up and trying not to wheeze.  He’d downed some more of Rogers’ aspirin earlier, but things would be much easier if he wasn’t hurting at all.  “You know, I’d shout at you less if you just walked at a manageable speed.”
There was no coherent response.  Steve looked behind him and saw the biters again, even closer this time.  "You wanna die here?" he snapped, needing some way,
"It's the truth," Tony insisted.  "But I guess you're in luck.  No one's going to be reading any history books for a while, I'm thinking."
Everything was gray.  Steve flattened himself on the ground, eyes stinging as he slowly shuffled ahead, avoiding the shambling feet of the biters passing by him.  There was no sign of the other two; instead, there was only a long hallway with lockers lining the walls.  He wasn't sure how fast it took for someone to turn once they were bitten, so he could only hope that neither of them was currently stumbling through the hall with the other biters.
Something clicked in Tony's head, and he couldn't help but roll his eyes even as his own lips twisted upward.  "Oh, my God," he said.  "You want to wear a suit."
Cap shrugged.  "You don't have the clearance," he said.  "And anyway, it doesn't really matter who I am."
Tony opened his eyes, blinking slowly at the darkness all around.  In front of him was a little pool of light, and it took a few minutes for his brain to process it as coming from one of the flashlights they’d been holding earlier, lying somewhere on the ground now.
"Don't," Tony repeated weakly.   He wasn't even sure anymore what he was trying to forbid, but he needed to stop
More intriguing was the kitchen, which was filled with all sorts of gadgets Steve didn't recognize.  Knowing now that he was in the future, he could assume that a lot of things were actually new home inventions that didn't exist during his time, and he was burning to find out what they did.  At school, his exposure had been limited - there were few appliances lying around, food having been served already cooked, classes still having been taught with the traditional chalk and blackboard.  Being in Tony's home now was like an entirely different world.
and the Search for the Time Stone
There was a reason for that, Tony reminded himself, but with the certainty of what was about to happen creeping up on him, whether or not he wanted to consciously acknowledge it, Tony found himself not caring.
Tony nodded.
The entries that followed were far shorter.  Steve was still making income thanks to his delivery job, but it wouldn't be enough to stay in the apartment for much longer.  That explained why everything was being packed, Tony thought dully to himself as Steve made a weak attempt to talk up the boarding house he was moving into.
"I'm sorry."
“Hey, calm down,” Tony offered quickly, since Steve seemed on the verge of a panic attack, even if he was doing a good job at keeping it under wraps for the time being.  “It’s okay.  Do you know what just happened?  Or how you got here?”  Steve shook his head, withdrawing a bit and apparently trying to make himself look as small as possible, which, for an animal of his size, was basically an exercise in futility.  Tony sighed.  “It’s okay,” he said again, awkwardly reaching out to pet him.  “I guess you just… forgot yourself for a moment.”  If an hour counted as a moment, but hey, who was arguing semantics?  “Anyway, you wandered off without me, but it’s alright.  I found you and we’re headed toward the mountain anyway, so no harm done, right?”  Steve gave him a morose look, like it was absolutely not alright, but Tony tried to ignore it.
Ty was inside the room now, stepping closer.  "The
Steve complied quickly, finding a large tree that people might have once picnicked at in better times and setting Tony down at the base of it.  "What is it?"
Steve gazed at him for a moment, contemplative, then nodded, placing his paw briefly against Tony’s shoulder.  If sabretooths could smile, Tony thought that maybe Steve would be smiling right now.  He reached up, patting his paw before Steve drew it away.  “Everything’s going to be okay.”
Steve ran.  In his arms, Tony threw something, and he could hear firecrackers going off between the sounds of Maya screaming—though whether it was out of fear or rage, Steve couldn't tell.  It didn't matter, anyway; only getting out of here did.
"It's fine," Steve said quickly.  He could hear the biters starting to push up the stairs.  "I'll carry you."  Quickly, he bent over to gather Tony into his arms—
.  So no homework, but there had to be
Steve manages a breathless laugh, slipping his arms around Tony and squeezing gently.  They’ve both made a proper mess of themselves by now, but hell, he hardly cares.  He can only hope they didn’t get anything onto the leather seats.  “Alright,” he says, tilting his head forward to kiss the other man.  “That… that was good.”
It didn't sound like a threat.  But it didn't exactly sound like something a normal person would say, either.  It almost seemed like… support? Tony's warning from the voicelog echoed in his head, and Steve still had no idea what to make of it.  Was Tony's Pa so volatile that these things had to be said?
Cap's gaze flickered upward, and he stared at Tony for a second, then shook his head and went back to it, as careful as ever.  Tony wouldn't admit it out loud, but the care Cap was taking with him felt… really nice.  He didn't need it—didn't really even deserve it, since it was his own fault he'd gotten hit in the first place—but Cap wasn't stopping, so maybe Tony could just enjoy it while it lasted.
"Fuck," Tony said.
"Anyway," Stark continued before the silence could stretch on for too long, "now that you've woken up, we can continue with the plan.  Get you to Bethesda.  Find a way to fix this damned thing."
And then it was over, the noise suddenly vanishing and leaving only a gaping silence in its place.  Tony straightened, still feeling tremors in his body, and looked around.  The airship was even more of a mess now, items toppled and strewn about everywhere.  But it was fine.  They were down on the ground in one piece, and considering the other possibilities, this was actually pretty good.
"Sure," Steve said.  He looked down at Tony, eyes going wide in surprise.  Tony was pale—paler than Steve had ever seen him.  "Are you feeling okay?"
Well, that was progress.  Steve reached up, about to run a hand through his hair before remembering that his hands were covered with the remains of another human being and thinking better of it.  "You want to tell me what just happened?"
By this point, Steve seemed to be looking vaguely horrified, but still Tony pressed on.  “So I looked.  And it wasn’t easy.  All those adventures I went on took me to obscure corners of the world.  Places in South America, China, India, you name it.”  Now Antarctica, apparently.  “And you can’t really charge up a repulsor pump in the middle of nowhere.  So there was always that time constraint.
"Don't be so hard on Fury," Captain America cut in, speaking up for the first time.  "It was my idea."
Steve tried not to wince.  Oh right, there had been a reason they'd gotten onto this tangent in the first place.  And honestly, she was right - he didn't remember. He had no idea what Ma was talking about.  But could he actually
Jarvis and Tony arrived in London the next day, with Rhodey coming in that evening.  Tony wasn't sure what about him made Rhodey ask if Tony wanted to share a bed that night, but whatever it was, he was grateful: it wasn't until he curled up with Rhodey under the sheets that he realized how lonely he had been feeling, and how good it was to see Rhodey again, alive and well.
“—Was not a mistake at all,” Tony completes for him, because it’s true.  He’s spent a lot of time grieving, and now he’s ready to move on.  He loves Rumiko.  He probably always will.  But the thing about their relationship—the thing that was completely his fault and not hers in the slightest—was that so long as he wore the armor, he could never,
Steve frowned.  "What do you mean?"
“Call me Tony,” he replies hastily.  “I think you’ve earned the right to address me by my first name.”  Besides, Mr. Stark is his father.  He doesn’t want to be his father.  Nonetheless, Tony takes his hand, shaking it before it occurs to him that Steve doesn’t seem to recognize him.  How is that possible?  To Howard’s great displeasure, Tony’s been caught up in a number of well-publicized, scandalous incidents in both America and Europe.  Finding him in bed with another man a month ago had been the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s back.  But Steve here… who knows.  Maybe he lives under a rock normally.  He certainly looks poor enough for that.
"Well, 'just' Steve, if you're serious, we'd be idiots to turn you down."  Luke looked at Stark.  "And you're okay with this?"
“Maybe,” Rogers replied lightly, eyes on the notepad.  “Go to sleep.”
"Right," said Tony.  "So we'll have to see for ourselves.  Our immediate plan of action will be to disembark the airship west of the site, where there's a mountain range that should give us cover.  Jarvis will stay on board and keep her in the sky once the rest of us are off.  We'll proceed by foot for the rest of the way—Rhodey will lead here, since traipsing through the wilderness is his thing.  When we arrive, we'll see.  If the Japanese are around, Pepper takes lead.  She's been reporting on Japanese activity for ages, and I trust her more than myself to know what to do with them.  Otherwise we'll start looking."
Tony wasn't heartless.  The betrayal had hurt, but a part of him still loved Steve.  Would always love Steve.  And if Steve needed his help to get the plane—and
Damn it.  Well, there was nothing Tony could do about it now.  He sighed, reaching over to grab Steve's watch to figure out how much time he had before he had to go off to his delivery job.
The transceivers the others had been carrying had been destroyed at some point, leaving Tony with no choice but to continue their current trajectory and to hope that they hadn't been moved to some other location.  He'd wondered as their signals blinked out how they were going to do this—how they were going to make any sort of progress beyond "arrive at Turkey and find them somehow".
anymore.  And I realized… I was the exact same way."
“I did.  And now I don’t,” Tony says.
But among the fear there was joy and there was beauty and there was love.  He had seen it all.  And no matter what happened—it
"God," Steve repeated, a shudder passing through his body.  Tony had known this whole time.  He'd planned for it.  "Are you asking me to do what I think you are?"
The word wasn't familiar to Steve.  It sounded Slavic—Polish, maybe?  But the woman had no accent.  Despite his confusion, he got up, although he didn't put his shield away.  If this bothered thewoman, she said nothing about it, instead pointing at two more spots on the ground.  "Mind yourselves there and there," she called to them.  "Unless you don't mind losing your heads."
He shouldn’t be here, he reminds himself.
With that, he turns and heads back inside, and the fact that no one stops him tells him that Howard isn’t following.
The metal plate was different now.  It had shrunk considerably, just a fraction of its original size, and took the shape of a small circle placed directly over his heart.  Embedded in it was the gem from earlier, glowing yellow the way it had been before Tony had touched it.
"It's fine," Steve insisted.  He tried to think of what Tony would do, based on what he'd said about his Ma, and decided on pulling her into a hug.  She smelled good, like something floral - lavender, maybe. "I'm glad you're home."
His answer is almost unbearably cryptic, but Steve decides to wait and see.  Tony keeps on taking them down whenever he can find a staircase, and before he knows it, they wind up in a dimly-lit room that seems to go on for miles, filled with automobiles.  “Gosh,” he says softly, looking around.  “I’ve never seen so many nice cars in one place before.”
It’s hard for Tony at first.  Sunset runs in some of the same circles as him these days, and every time he catches a glimpse of her at a party or sees her name in the news, he can’t help but remember the wounds she’d left in him, wounds that are still embarrassingly raw.
“Exactly,” Tony said.  “Trouble is the last thing we’re going to get into.  And that’s boring.”
,” Tony repeated as he fished out a roll of gauze, starting to awkwardly roll it around his arm and watching as the blood started to soak through.  This was really not fun.
“I mean it’s
,” she says.  “I don’t know why you insist on ignoring it, but we all know what those of his class are like.  All he wants is your money.”
For a moment, he entertained the thought of finishing up quickly so he could go and chat up the redhead who lived down the block, part of his unending quest to make Steve happy with a girl.  So Dorothy hadn't worked out, nor had the other girls Tony had tried to set Steve up with - but there were other fish in the sea. It was only for a moment, though, because it occurred to Tony very suddenly that doing exactly what he was doing right now, keeping his mom company while she was sick, was actually what would make Steve happy, and once he'd realized it, it became difficult to rationalize doing anything else.
"Don't let it go to your head," Cap muttered.  He got a roll of gauze out next and started wrapping it around Tony's arm.
“Oh, please,” Tony replies, taking Steve’s hand and pulling him in as well, motioning for him to shut the door.  “I’m first class.  You know how we love bossing people around.”
“No one?”  Tony thinks of himself, so foolishly baring his wrist to Sunset, who used it to her own advantage all those years ago.  He thinks of Rhodey, sharing Tony’s own frustration as he baffled over a line from an obscure poem as they studied together in the library at MIT, wondering what the two of them did wrong to get such vague words.  He thinks of Jan, showing her wrist to all her teammates in order to make one of them see what’s right in front of him.
Steve laughs shakily, picking up the lifebelt and putting it back on Tony.  “Thanks.  So are you.”  He stands there for another moment, pressing down on the wound, and then he takes a deep breath and steps back, taking hold of Tony’s hand again.  “Press down on that with your other hand.  Let’s go.”
"There was a man in a wheelchair," Tony said, staring up at the ceiling from the bed that Cap had dragged into the control room.  He couldn't leave—he needed to be around in case they hit turbulence and they needed manual steering—and so Cap had insisted on doing as much as he could to make Tony comfortable.  It was thoroughly unnecessary, but also sweet in its own way.  "Leaving the airship when it was on fire.  I didn't recognize him, but… he's involved.  I know he is."
"That's right."
Steve sighed, deciding not to answer that.  "We need to find a good entry point," he said.  "Let's go."
“Tell me, ‘Director Stark’, tell me, was it worth it?
"I've already known that for a long time," Steve murmured.  "Well… thanks for telling me.  We'll get those blueprints back."
Tony's eyes went wide.  "Are you crazy?" he asked.  "You just got bit!  We can't go, especially not with you carrying him all the way.  We need to find somewhere safe, wait it out—"
And it was signed
slowing down, innit?"
"Tony," he murmured, and he reached up again, running his fingers through Tony's hair, remembering the way he had done this so many years ago.  "My feelings for you.  They're the same as they were before."
Steve was suddenly reminded of some of the things he'd seen during the war, his fists clenched as he thought about it.  That people were capable of such malice… "We'll have to break a window, then," he said as he continued following the walls of the school.  "That won't be quiet."
"Don't," Stark whispered, and Steve glared at him, somehow knowing the words that would come out next.  "Don't be like this.  You don't understand."
He turns to look at Steve, who’s just gazing at him in silence, and once more he’s struck by how comfortable all of this is.  Steve’s seen him at his worst and at his best, and still he’s here, one of the few people Tony never did manage to drive away.  There are still the same three words on the tip of his tongue as they’ve always been, but somehow, as Tony gazes back at Steve, he suddenly realizes that there’s no need to say them out loud.
.  He'd ultimately died for his country.  What right did Tony have, sitting here in a comfortable chair and in no mortal danger, to not do something as simple as - as checking his files?
“Okay,” Rogers said.  He touched the markings on the rock again, continuing, “So how do we get in?”
since their last switch; he could hardly believe it - but that journal, Tony had thought, had been so important to them both.  All Tony could find instead was a sketchbook, which just made it sting a little more. Steve had made space in his personal belongings for a sketchbook, but not his journal?  What if the two of them had swapped places earlier; what did Steve expect Tony to do? Had he just given up on ever switching with Tony again?
That’s all the invitation he needs.  Tony finally closes the gap between their lips, kissing him—gently at first, afraid of pushing too hard—but then Steve’s tongue slips into his mouth, and God, it’s obvious that Steve has wanted this just as badly.  He can’t pull away, and he doesn’t want to.  So they kiss and they kiss and they kiss as the ship sails into the sunset, and in this one beautiful, glorious moment, Tony knows he can do anything in the world with Steve by his side, come what may.
The man reaches out, and the next thing Tony knows, another hand is covering his own.  It’s so warm.  “You’re not going to let go,” he says very softly.
Tony laughs, dropping a coin onto his sketchbook.  “Will this do?”
Steve nods again, placing his hand on Tony’s back and trying to get him to
"No," Tony admitted.  He reached up with a shaking hand, the one with the bite, and gripped at Steve's shoulder as tightly as he could, like his life depended on it.  Maybe in some small way, it did.  "I'm afraid," he whispered.
A minute passed, and then Steve drew back, his mouth closing.  “Thank God,” Tony breathed, relieved beyond belief as he let his hand drop.  Jesus.  Like he was actually ever going to go through with that!  “Alright.  Give me a moment—”
And then he saw it.  The wall was still covered in crude drawings, just like before… but as Rogers had mentioned earlier, they seemed different now.  Gone were the depictions of hunting and gathering, replaced by something else entirely.
“Here we are,” Rogers agreed.  Tony turned to watch as Rogers brought out what looked like a sparse map of the area with various squiggles covering it, kneeling down to lay it flat on the ground.  “I mapped a potential route we could take.  It’s not exact because there aren’t really paths, just these rough ideas of where the mountains and forests are, but I think if we go in an outward spiral like this, we can see a lot of things but still be able to return to the airship point pretty quickly.  What do you think?”
“You like fixing hurt things, huh?”  Tony grins.  “I bet you like to rescue stray cats and dogs off the street.”  That is, in fact, exactly the sort of thing Steve likes to do, and he stammers as much as Tony laughs.  “Hey, don’t be embarrassed.  It’s a good thing.  We need more guys like you in the world.  But you don’t spend
Steve blinked.  "I don't know.  Probably.  Why?"
Steve bit back his response.  He decided to go back to the task at hand, putting the food on the shelf with the other cans he'd seen when he first woke up and moving all the empty ones to the side.  When he couldn't find an excuse to stand there any longer, he returned to the table, staring once again at the back of Stark's head.  Finally, Stark finished up, wringing the clothes out and draping them over the back of a chair to dry.
Tony smiled, and Steve pulled the trigger.
Navy Yard.  "I know that place," Steve said softly.
Tony swallows.  No.  No.  Howard is trying to guilt trip him, and he’s not going to let it work.  He’s
Tony's jaw dropped.  It was

"That's me," Maya agreed.  "I'm honored.  I didn't expect you to know of me.  I mean, you're Tony Stark."
?” Sunset repeats, eyes flashing.  “How do you expect me to do that, when—when you likely are going to see him again?”
And then everything went dark.
creepy?  “Why isn’t it attacking?”
Tony waved one arm, gesturing at everything.  "
"He's not—" Steve began before stopping himself and sighing.  She didn't need to be burdened with his personal problems.  "Fine.  We'll wait."
He wasn't sure if that was a good thing or not.
And that was when his beam of light landed on one very large cat.
The doors were shut and the airship was up record time, and soon enough, they spotted the other plane doggedly still trying to mow Cap down.  Miraculously, only one of its guns was firing—had Cap managed to disable the other one?
- but the words died in his throat before he could choke them out.  It wouldn't bring them back. Nothing would bring them back, and there wasn't a damned thing he could do about it but live with the weight of his failure.
Steve looks so frail, so small.  It’s hard to believe a man like this could have ever led the nation as Captain America, but that had always been part of the magic that was Steve Rogers.  It wasn’t his height or his strength or even his shield that had made him so extraordinary—it was his fierce loyalty, his unwavering trust, his devotion to justice.
if he wants to.
"I'm not going to share with you," Ty warned.
Steve managed a weak chuckle at that, accepting the shield with a soft thanks as he and Tony both got up.  "Let's get the hell out of here," he said.
"Hello, world," said someone who sounded just like him, except they were a lot more excited than Tony normally was.  He had to smile. It was just - the word choice made it seem like someone discovering a new programming language for the first time, and the speaker was full of wonder about what was coming next.
But now there’s no more time.  The other man is too far off, slipping away with every passing second, and Tony is helpless, unable to do anything but stare up into those blue eyes he’s come to know and love.  Steve—Steve can’t know how beautiful he looks right now, blond hair falling into his face as a flare lights him up from behind, framing those perfect features.  He must be scared.  Tony
They’d left that morning, making sure to hide the evidence that indicated that they’d stayed there that night—while they’d yet to encounter anyone else who might be tracking them for whatever reason, it was best not to take any chances.   From there, they’d bickered about which direction to go, because Rogers was apparently wary of perfectly good technology and believed in—Tony didn’t even know.  Aimless exploring, maybe?  But Tony had won the argument, which was for the better, because it was all paying off now.
"I thought so," Steve replied quietly.  He reached up to take Tony's hand and just held it for a while.  "Because you're the futurist.  You try to mold the future into your vision.  Right?"
They weren't.  Hours passed, and Tony could feel his clothes soaking through with sweat as he moved around in the heat.  They'd already had to regroup more than once in order to remain in sight of each other, and morale was slowly sinking.  By nightfall, nothing had changed, and they set up camp near the remains of what seemed like the main palace as they attempted to put the day's woes out of mind.  Archeology was a slow process, Tony told himself as he laid on top of his sleeping bag that night, wishing it were cooler.  Just because they hadn't found what they were looking for didn't mean it wasn't there.
“It’s nothing.”  They approach his room, and Tony cautiously opens the door, peering inside.  The coast is clear.  Last he saw, Sunset and his father had accosted the Osbornes and were currently chatting up a storm with them… so they should be fine for now.  “Come on.”  He ushers Steve inside, then shuts the door, heading for the armoire.  “Go get comfortable,” he continues.  “I’ll go find something.”
Tony considered it.  Yeah, he could buy that, based on the next few drawings.  “I guess they thought intentionally sacrificing things to them was better than getting mauled.”
but this.
, he tells himself.
Tony tries in vain to pull free, looking around anxiously.  “Steve, no,” he begins weakly.  “I—I can’t be seen with you.”
he must be scared.  But despite all that, there’s no fear in his face at all, just determination and affection and relief and maybe something more.
Jessica struggled for a moment longer and then finally went limp, taking a deep, shuddering breath before nodding.  "Fine," she said, and Steve pulled back, Stark following his example.
"That's a shocker," Steve said with a soft snort, allowing himself to relax again.  Tony was okay.  "So what do you think?  Is she trouble?"
"I'll hold the biters off!" he called, grabbing his rifle, which had dropped onto the ground.  "Take care of him!"
Steve must be sensing his impatience, because in the next instant, his lips are by his ear as he murmurs, “Go on.  You can open your eyes now.”
He thinks about his mother, killed in the car with the same make as the one on her wrist, and then he thinks of Steve, dead now because he’d gone to war with the man who had uttered the words on his own wrist mere hours ago, and Tony feels like he knows why Steve didn’t like them.
"Alright," Steve replied softly.  "Well.  I'm here if you need it."
After a few hours, something in his pack made a beeping sound, and he stopped in his tracks, quickly rummaging through the pack to find the offending item.
—and dodged clumsily out of the way, so Tony just fired at it again.  Funny.  The other one they’d fought was much more aggressive.  This one just seemed confused.  “After what you did, are you not going to put up a fight?” he asked it, adjusting his angle.  If he could get it to open its mouth somehow, then he’d be in the clear—
“Which way?” Steve yells as they reach the end of the hall, struggling to be heard over the sound of water surging all around them.
He moved the highlighter over and hit enter.
"Never thought you'd ask!" Cap shouted back.
But Steve just gives him a smile, that same dazzling, determined smile that’s sent Tony charging into battle a million times in years past.  “You’re going to get through this,” he says.  “You’re an Avenger, whether or not we’ve disbanded.  And I know—I
, reads the envelope in what seems like an almost intimate, comforting script, and Tony finds himself almost afraid to find out just why the handwriting looks so familiar.
Steve didn't know what they were practicing for, but with
," he said.  "So I'd say don the suits and go in with guns blazing."  He could go even grander—probably something involving rigging the airship somehow—but without knowing the circumstances of the others' captivity, he couldn't risk blindly raining explosives or otherwise onto wherever they were holed up.
"Stark?" he asked, hardly able to comprehend it.  "Tony Stark?"
Tony beamed.  "I knew you'd come through," he said.
how much Stark loved that suit, so why would he just toss it aside because of some noise?—but he decided not to press.  He supposed it didn't really matter, anyway.  Stark didn't have his suit, and that was the end of it.  "What about your heart?"
"Yeah, that," Cap said.  "You wanna maybe do some of that now?"
A biter came right up to them, and Steve swung with his shield, hitting it solidly in the head.  It went down, but there were more coming.  "And Tony," he continued with another glance back, "I'll die right here too, because I'm not leaving my men behind, and I'm not fucking leaving you behind, either!"
Was Steve really so selfless that that was actually his primary reason for trying to enlist?  Well - alright, that was a silly question, because of course Steve was. And though his health problems and small stature were still keeping him from jumping into war, Tony still wondered if it was just a matter of time.
"So am I supposed to lie?" Cap asked.  "I'm not gonna do that."
, Tony almost replied, but he stopped himself in time.  Fortunately, there were other responses that came to mind.  He'd made so many mistakes since Steve had last known him. "Because - because.  People died. Because of things he made and did." He shuddered, and tried to temper some of the guilt he felt before it all came pouring out.  "He's not a good person. And he doesn't deserve to… to be cared about."
And then he was gone, having bought Tony the precious few minutes he'd needed for the suit to fully charge up.
Stark moved closer, letting out a low whistle.  "That's hydraulic cement," he said, glancing over at the next window as well.  "Christ.  Someone went and sealed all the exits."
Tony shook his head.  "Don't start with that," he said, pulling the gauze away.  Steve could hear him swallowing as he stared down at Steve's neck.  "Just stay with me."
one of his first questions was to ask about Tony - God, what could he even say to all of that?  He knew what he
Still, Tony had a
.  But he'd done it anyway, because… he was Steve.
"I didn't mean it like that," Cap added hastily, eyes wide.  "No.  I'd love to.  I'd really love to.  I just think—I'm needed in Europe."
Tony rolled his eyes.  "And maybe I don't believe you," he said.
Steve stared down at the items Natasha had left on the table before turning his gaze to Tony.  "Love matters," he repeated.
“Jesus, Rogers, do you want me to make a damned pinky promise or something?”  He stuck his hand out, extending his pinky.  “I solemnly swear I will not drop dead on you.”
"Sweetheart," Steve interrupted, and that quieted Tony fast, his lips parting in shock.  "You don't have to ask me.  I'll do it for you."
Tony gives him a small smile back, though his eyes aren’t quite joining in yet.  “Kiss me again?”
He glanced at Tony, and Tony immediately knew what he was thinking.  "Or it might be something else," he said.  "Let's check it out."
"Enough for what?" Cap asked.
The answer was apparently Ty, Steve learned as he found and sat down across from him at one of the tables.  He peered over at his tray. "That's barely anything," he said. It looked like a bowl of milk with a bunch of… colorful tiny donuts floating in it.  Cereal?
“I’m going to stay up and keep watch.”  Rogers glanced up from his notepad, quirking an eyebrow.  “I know
Steve could see he was getting ready to fight.  "I'm not going to let you speak like that to me again."
“Disgusting,” Howard hisses.  He opens his mouth again, like he’s going to say more, but then the door opens, and Sunset steps in.  She’s holding something in her arms—Jesus Christ, are those
Not a voice he recognized, but certainly one he could locate.  Taking advantage of the reprieve, Tony spun around the pillar, then fired the gauntlet in the direction of the voice.  He was rewarded by the sound of an agonized shout and what he was pretty sure was the clatter of a weapon falling to the ground.
Rogers frowned, squinting at it.  “What is it?”
Tony led the way—he had the map, and he seemed to be familiar with more of the city than Steve, who had really only known Brooklyn… Brooklyn, his home, and the place he would soon see again, even though he'd decided he didn't want to.  Now he had no choice.
Tony glanced around.  The sun had risen by now, so there was plenty of light to go by.  "It matches what we know," he said as he took a few steps around the area.  "The building that used to stand here was circular, going by the foundation that's still here.  Somewhere inside should be an entrance that leads underground to the tomb.  Spread out and look."
himself that he didn’t care about words or soulmates or any of that stuff anymore.  Usually, he doesn’t.  Usually, he has more important things to think of, like saving the world or helping Steve retrieve his shield when it gets lost in the Atlantic Ocean.  But Hank and Jan get married.  Pepper and Happy get married.  Fellow Avengers Justice and Firestar get engaged and leave the team.
.  His friend.  His brother.
Stark's words didn't quite add up—Steve
As soon as thick plumes of smoke started spurting out from it, Steve pulled open the door, backing himself and Tony up so that they were between the door and the wall and holding his breath as he heard the biters start to stumble in.  God, there were so many—what kind of hellish experiments had Maya and the others been running on them?  Eventually, though, it seemed like there was a gap in the mass of biters squeezing through, and so Steve slipped out of the room with Tony, heart pounding.  Once outside, he paused long enough for Tony to set off another smoke bomb and to throw one of the firecrackers down the far end of the hall, and then he started to slowly edge toward, then down the staircase, clutching Tony against him.  The biters brushed past them, so close that Steve could almost smell their stench, but thankfully the smoke bombs did their jobs, obstructing their sense of smell—both Steve's and the biters'.
The thought was sobering.  Assuming they made it out of all this alive, assuming they would be able to rebuild… it seemed like maybe there was going to be a whole generation that would miss out on history and literature and math and science, because the only thing they would learn while growing up was how to survive.  And while polynomials had never directly helped him take a biter down, these things
He received a whine in response, which he had to roll his eyes at.  “Rogers.  You are a
worth it, Steve is the reason he would actually mind dying on this ship tonight—and he pulls one arm back and punches his father square in the jaw, sending him reeling.  He stands there afterward, panting harshly as he watches Howard disbelievingly reach up and touch his face, wiping the spittle away from his mouth.  He doesn’t regret it at all.  “This is my life,” he tells him.  “And if I think he’s worth it, then he is.”
“You idiot,” Steve tells him, even as he holds him close, pressing kisses against every inch of his face that he can reach, fingers curling into his hair.  “You damned
And then he fell, the shield lodged squarely in his skull.  Steve stumbled back against the far wall, grasping at his gunshot wound and catching his breath.  He hadn't even exerted himself, not physically.  But he'd done it.  He'd killed a man.
"Me?" Cap asked, as though there were anyone else Tony could be addressing.  "Oh.   Well.  Fury would probably ask me to go back to Europe.  That's where I was spending all my time before this assignment came along."  He shrugged.  "And what about you, Tony?  I'd… heard that you were doing research stateside."
“Do you know,” she hisses, “what an honor it was to be a part of Steve’s life?  He gave me that honor even though we both knew my words weren’t for him.  And then we broke up and he gave you that honor, and I was happy for him because he was happy.  But you wasted it.  You wasted it!  You killed him!”
He raised his shield.  Then a glossy black-and-white photo poking out of the closest biter's breast pocket caught his eye—"I can't," he whispered to himself, and he followed Stark and Jessica through the window.
“That’s a lie.”
Cap chose that moment to turn away, and even though Tony could see that he was getting a wet cloth, it still felt very purposeful.  "I… I heard you.  That first night.  I have very good hearing."
Rogers’ eyes widened, and he went over to Tony, placing a hand against his shoulder.  “Tony?” he asked.  “Are you alright?”
Tony nodded.  "Hold on to me, Cap," he said.  He made a few more adjustments, shifting his stance as he sensed—since he couldn't see—Cap coming up behind him, arms cautiously wrapping around Tony's metal body.  The alarms went quiet with one more flick, the flashing lights following suit in the next second.  "Three… two… one—"
"Pepper!" he yelled.
"I'll make sure the train is clear," Steve supplied.  Given the gleeful expression on Tony's face, Steve wasn't even sure if he'd heard him.  Nonetheless, he went to do a sweep of the railcars, but there were surprisingly few people here.  If he had to guess from the dusty footprints, it seemed as they'd gotten on this train at one point, been informed that it was going nowhere, and evacuated.  Steve wanted to hope they got away okay, but he had a feeling that ultimately many of them had perished in the station.
thing—he saw was weapons.  Rows and rows of weapons, from guns to bombs to other items whose purpose he could only guess.  And somehow—that felt strange.  Off.  He was Tony Stark, the world's foremost expert in the latest in weapons technology.  There was, he thought, nothing in this field he didn't know about.
"He was a biter."
Tony pulled something from his pack, handing it to them.  "It's a slim chance, but if you can find the cabin that Steve and I stayed in, it might work for you three.  It's marked on the map here."
"What are you doing?" Tony's Pa had asked, and though his voice wasn't slurred, there was enough of an edge to make Steve tense.
He found himself at the entrance of the giant igloo-thing again, and with a deep breath, he peered into the opening, which led to a vast dome of blackness—except for one tiny thing he could see shining from within.
Pepper scrubbed at her eyes with one hand and nodded.  "I guess," she said.  "Make sure Tony doesn't get up and do things.  He'll try that."
.  Well, fine.  Tony could deal with it.  He nudged it toward the wall with his foot, straightening.  “We don’t need that bowl anymore, anyway.”  He received another eye roll for his efforts, but he ignored it, instead securing everything against Rogers’ back again.  “Alright.  Ready to go?”  Rogers nodded, so Tony climbed on, clutching at his fur and leaning in close as they took off.
he was - he'd be able to come up with a better plan, one that would keep Steve safe.
So brave, Tony thinks.  So beautiful.
"Tony?" Pepper asked.  Her voice was closer than it had been a few seconds ago.  "Are you awake?"
Steve frowns.  “You think?”
, he repeats to himself over and over.  Steve’s okay.  He’s out of the woods.  A bullet didn’t take his life away again.
Eventually, he reached the end of rows that started with "CA_".  The ones that followed seemed to be made out of gibberish as far as he could tell, though they still ended with ".gif".  The first of these showed a man in swim trunks by the pool. The man looked nice. Steve supposed he could understand why such a pleasant picture was in here.  And the image after that… oh.
no right
Tony saves Steve’s life once, twice, a hundred times in the years that pass.  He lets Steve sit in his garage and draw while Tony works and spars with him in his free time.  He gives Steve relationship advice on Bernie, on Diamondback, on Sharon as they sit in the kitchen drinking coffee together at the crack of dawn on the days Steve spends the night at the mansion—Steve having risen early and Tony not yet ready to sleep.  Sometimes, when he has Stark Industries business to attend to at his other branches, he drags Steve onto his jet and goes sightseeing with him in between meetings: to Normandy, to Beijing, to Easter Island.  (Steve is reluctant at first, afraid of missing any crises that might happen in New York, but after they fight off some supervillains at the Great Wall, he concedes that crises happen everywhere so it probably doesn’t matter where he is.)
He doesn’t know what to do or say.  He’s here because he promised a dead man that he’d come visit with him, and just because Steve is gone doesn’t mean he should go back on that promise.  After a long moment of contemplation, he sets the flowers down against her gravestone, deciding if he should push aside the other flowers there; they’re dried and withered and browned, like they’ve been out for far too long—but then he thinks of Steve standing exactly where Tony’s standing now, holding those very same flowers, and he doesn’t disturb them.
The first thing—the
"And we won last time, so we should definitely try to repeat that part," Tony said.  He then reached down to pick up some of the papers, brandishing them at the others.  "These," he continued, "are reports written by Li Ji, Chinese archaeologist.  Until 1937, he was in central China uncovering one of its historic capitals, Yinxu.  His team left when the Japanese invaded, and no one's been looking there since.  Which is a shame for him, because he documented evidence that there was a particular item that was being worshipped, but he was unable to find the item itself before they had to evacuate."
Tony tried to remember the actual planes that corresponded to the reporting names Pepper was giving him as he shoved the stone that had covered the entrance to the tomb back into place.  A Jean was a bomber used by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service—Pepper was probably right; they weren't going to be flying around in central China.  "Okay," he said.  "A Perry.  It's a fighter plane.  Comes with two forward-firing Type 89 machine guns."
Rogers whined and dug his claws into the ground again, trying to gain some leverage.  It was hard for Tony to see Rogers’ lower half, but he could hear his legs scrambling for purchase against the vertical wall.
"And you're not?" Cap countered.  His voice was sharp, sharper than Tony would have expected.  "Look, Tony.  We're in a bad spot right now, which, by the way, is
Steve stares at him for a moment, confused—but then he realizes what Tony is expecting, and he laughs, going to open the door.  “So demanding,” he says.
Though escape was still on Tony's mind, there were too many people around to make a proper break for it, and if he was going to save Bucky, too, he'd need to get him on board with the plan as well.  So for the moment, he bided his time, letting himself be led onto a plane and taking a seat across from Bucky as they took off - and God, Cap and Bucky must have been really important to the war effort if they'd spared a B-22 Liberator just to pick the two of them up.
It was the ring, he knew.  The ring was involved somehow, but the specifics remained a mystery to him—Birch, he thought, had touched on it earlier.  It was why he'd needed a "helper", because he couldn't use it himself.  But the helper could use it.  And Cap… Cap could use it.
.  But if they spent too long hanging out down here and missed tomorrow’s pickup, then he’d be in big trouble.
Tony let out a choked sob, and he turned against Steve's hand, as though he was craving his touch.  "Say it," he whispered.
Steve lets out a soft laugh, sounding somewhat pained, and looks down as he squeezes Tony’s hand.  “You killed yourself for me,” he says after a long moment.
Tony doesn’t remember the rest of the night very well.
“You’re welcome,” Steve says, then leads him over to a bench and sits down, pulling him along.  “So… do you wanna talk about it?”
It wasn't easy.  Neither Tony nor the things he was carrying were light, and it was a struggle to not drop anything.  His saving grace was that the bodily matter they'd smeared on themselves seemed to be confusing the biters, leaving their movements half-aborted despite the pounding of his feet and the sounds Tony was still making.  Steve nonetheless didn't want to rely on that too much, continuing to run as fast as he could down the bridge as it evened out into the road on the other side.  There was, to his relief, a building not too far from them, and he made a beeline for it, finding the door and trying to kick it down—only to have it refuse to give.  But he couldn't run with Tony in his arms forever, and the biters were still following them.
Tony snorts and waves a hand, cutting him off.  “Okay, I get it.  It’s alright.  Breathe.”
Still hardly able to believe it all, Tony went about replacing the uniform where he'd found it when he realized - the pockets weren't empty.  With another glance around, Tony checked all the pockets he could find, pulling out folded sheets of paper from most of them. There weren't many, so Tony went about ordering them to the best of his ability, then stared down at the first page, which looked like it was a cover sheet.
, so what was there to be impressed about?  And super soldier?  Absolutely ridiculous.  Tony had security clearance.  He could access the files on Project: Rebirth.  And he knew that everything
With a nod, Tony dips his head back down, managing to find the crook of his shoulder and nuzzling into the space there.  He looks adorable and happy and sated, which is the best Steve could have hoped for, really.  “We’ll have to do this again later,” he says, voice muffled.  “Much later.  I’m exhausted now.”
“No, don’t be,” Tony replies hastily.  “I didn’t mind.  Just making an observation.”
It was hard to describe.  He thought to himself, as he managed to sit up in bed, that maybe it was more the lack of feeling that was bothering him.  Because - well, because honestly, right now he was pretty sure he was supposed to be hungover.
him?  It’s the strangest thing he’s ever felt.  When was the last time he was hugged?  He can’t even remember.  Swallowing, he finds himself melting into his arms.  He’s warm, so warm.
"If they catch us here they're gonna shoot us down," Rhodey said, having turned toward them once they'd come up the stairs.
“Helping our country isn’t boring,” Rogers replied, because apparently he was the biggest Boy Scout ever, Jesus.  “We’re going to find new information about this place.  And we’ll learn a lot.”  He held up one of the papers, waving it at him.  “Stark, you do realize preliminary reports show that there are
in the area?  And dinosaurs?  They’re supposed to be extinct!”
“They don’t,” Rogers replied.  “I brought them in case you needed them.”
Steve frowned at the clipped tone of Tony's voice, but he chose not to press it for now, if only because he didn't want to stand right in front of a stadium that was burning down and filled with biters.  "Let's go," he agreed, scooping Tony up into his arms and starting to walk briskly down the street, turning a corner at the first possible opportunity so that there wasn't a direct line between them and the biters.  He remembered they'd left their bikes somewhere nearby, but he didn't think Tony could ride one in his condition, so walking it was.
"Of course I do!" Tony snapped, surprising even himself with his vehemence.  "I should have—should have planned better.  Should have been more careful.  Shouldn't have gotten shot."
So he’s not sure what exactly possesses him to buy a huge cruise ship when he’s over a hundred, getting on board and telling the crew to get going, but he doesn’t fight it.  He instead goes to one of the lounges on deck, a drink clutched in one hand, and then he sits and watches the ocean as it rolls past them.
When she’s gone, he sighs, picking the napkin off his face and dropping it onto the table.  Then he pours himself another cup of coffee and downs it, because why the hell not.  He’s going to need it all if he expects to make it through the day.
Sometime between the rescue and dawn, another ship comes, and they are brought on board.  He is passed off onto a doctor, who hisses and fusses over his shoulder, eventually managing to remove the bullet after several long, agonizing minutes, but Tony doesn’t cry, doesn’t scream, just grits his teeth and bears the pain.
"That's what I've been wondering about, honestly," Tony said.  "So this James of hers goes off somewhere, and she wants us to find out what happened to him.  Maybe he's a biter now.  Maybe he just ran off.  How the hell are we supposed to know?  He doesn't have to be at the Navy Yard.  He could be literally anywhere."
Tony joined him a moment later, having retrieved his shovel—he'd left it behind since it was too much to hold on to during a supply run.  "Oh, darling, am I glad to be reunited with you," he said, pressing a kiss to the handle.
He let his eyes shut all the way.  He suddenly felt very tired.  "This is my fault," he said.  "I've left you alone again."
Tony rubs his face with both hands, wishing he were elsewhere.  “How can I?  You humiliate me about it every chance you get.”
Steve wasn't sure he'd love to hear a ticking reminder of how his heart would only work with outside help, but he decided not to bring that up, reluctant to damper the mood too much.  He also wasn't sure about the whole loving himself bit, considering that Tony had apparently blamed himself for the entire biter epidemic, but that would be even more of a damper.  "So nothing's wrong?"
That was… better, Steve supposed, and he nodded.  "So you're researching a cure?" he tried.
Tony tilts his head back, looking up on the sky, and suddenly he seems very subdued.  “It’s like a prison here,” he says at last.  “I know what you’re thinking.  I’m a first-class passenger on the biggest ship in the world and somehow I feel like that’s a bad thing.”  He sighs, closing his eyes, and Steve has to fight the urge to hug him.  “I don’t know.  It’s Sunset.  It’s my father.  It’s everything.”  One eye cracks open, squinting at Steve.  “Don’t get me wrong.  Being rich is great, no offense to you.  It comes with some pretty short strings, though.”
Cap gaped at him.  "Wait," he said, tugging on Tony's hand as if to get him to lie down again.  "I didn't mean
"Steve!" came a voice from behind him, and Tony nearly jumped, not expecting to be addressed.  Again his instincts told him to just start running, but rationally he knew that he wasn't going to be making it out of an army encampment if he was being chased.  Instead, he made himself turn around, peering at the speaker. He looked - young. Not young enough to be called a kid, but definitely younger than all the other men here.  Some sort of page, maybe?
Tony exhaled softly.  "I don't know, Steve."  There was a pause, and then he continued, "Did… did you see his arm?"
Steve went to inspect the workstation, but unsurprisingly, most of what he saw was foreign to him.  Still, he had to smile - between this, Jarvis' comments, and Tony's voicelogs, it was blindingly clear that Tony had an eye for mechanics and liked to tinker with things.  It was admirable, really. He wanted to learn and improve, and it was probably something Steve could do better at.
"Guys!"
Steve blinked slowly, staring at the sky where the woman's head had once been.  Then his gaze went down, and he found her head on his chest—or what remained of it, anyway, once that bullet had gone through.
Stark glared back at him in return.  Then he got out his ice pick, gripping it tight before shoving the cafeteria doors open and storming inside.
be real.  It’s too strange.  “Thanks,” he mumbles after a minute, hunching over and pulling the jacket closer, shivering.  He hadn’t realized how chilly it was out here earlier.  At the time, he hadn’t cared.  But now he does, and Steve’s jacket is around him, warming him.  Is it leather?  It smells like leather.  Probably the only nice thing he owns, based on the rest of Steve’s clothes.
“Sorry.  Scratch that.  I’m thankful.  Both for that and… your discretion.  When Sunset came.”
Not that Tony was particularly keen on doing so, of course.  The last time he’d gone looking for magical artifacts there, a feral bison had tried its damndest to gore him to death.
Tony could come up with plenty of reasons on his own.  Despite the fact that summer had ended, Steve hadn't gone back to school - he was continuing to work instead, presumably because he needed the income in order to have something to eat and a place to live.  And if he were in the military, both room and board would be provided, not to mention pay.
"You're right," he said softly.  "It's not something to be proud of."
"They're coming from the roof!" Stark hissed, jabbing his ice pick at the first biter and cursing when it missed and went through its cheek instead.
But he’s not, so he doesn’t, and eventually he pretends to fall asleep so that they’ll go off and do other things.  Once the room is empty, Tony gets up and finds a computer and looks for
"Okay."  Tony thought about it, then added, "Do you have them?  The pieces, I mean?  Rhodey said you did."
.  Which, unfortunately, was completely true.
, that suggested that said cave drawings might actually be true, Tony was going to hang onto it for dear life.
"You heard her," Cap said, holding his hand out for Tony to take.  Tony did so, pulling himself up with a grunt.  There was some pain in his side, which from a glance looked like an arrow had grazed him, but he'd worry about that later.  Better hurt than dead, in any case.
"And how is it going to run?"
"Jesus," he whispered to himself.
Rogers nodded.
It was, Tony realized as his heart leapt into his throat, coming from the direction of the airship.  With no leads on anyone else's whereabouts, Tony broke into a run back toward it, sleeve held up to his face again to try and block out some of the smoke.  But Rhodey's warning about burning poison ivy rang in his head, and he had a sinking feeling that he was already starting to feel the effects—his skin itched, his eyes burned, his throat ached.
Steve blinks at him, his face breaking into a wide smile, and for a blissful, beautiful moment, Tony feels like the sun’s come out and everything is warm and dry and perfect again.  “C-come here,” he says, and he leans forward to press a kiss to his forehead, then his nose, then his lips; Tony makes no move at all to stop him.  “W-want you to know something,” he continues, and he presses a few more kisses to his skin before going back to gazing at him—Tony finds himself reminded of when they initially met, looking into those blue eyes for the first time.  So beautiful.  So, so beautiful.  “I-I’d do this all again in a h-h-heartbeat, Tony.  I would.  B-because I got to meet you, and that m-makes it all worth it.”
"Hi," he said.
“You’re making that hard.”
"I need to see Tony Stark."
"Yes!" came the response.  "It's like—like flying, almost!  Without the plane!"
"Ah," Cap said.  He put the piece in his pouch, then rubbed his temple with his newly-freed hand.  "I… I don't know.   I feel like it—it makes sense to me, in a way.  But I can't describe it."
, but it felt like the wrong time.  "So you saved me," he said.  "Again."
"Need help?" Cap asked, stepping toward Tony.
Steve didn't think he'd relaxed since he'd been brought out of the ice all those weeks ago, but he nodded anyway.  Tony reached out to take his hand and squeeze it, and Steve squeezed back before sleep took him once more.
”  Besides, Tony has dozens of nice suits.  What does it matter to him if one has its stitches popped?
He had to fix this.  He rocked violently against the chair, but none of the restraints gave.  "I need to see him."
"You're wrong, Mr. Birch," Cap said.  His gaze seemed unfocused, but he looked remarkably calm otherwise, completely at odds with Tony's frayed instincts, which were telling him to go back up and find the others.  "The others.  They're up there, destroying the carrier's missile launchers as we speak.  Nothing is leaving this ship."
, and what would he even tell him?
“Yeah,” Steve says, smiling slightly in return.  “But I was thinking about what happened after that.”
Tony shook his head.  "Put me down," he said, voice raspy.
him.  Tony was familiar with the stories—he knew that Cap was hailed as a hero by a lot of people.  But Cap had told him, with complete honestly, that
"I can't."
Tony added his light to the wall as well, stepping closer.  “Well,” he said.  “Will you look at that.”  It wasn’t the same as the markings from the rock they’d seen earlier—these were more elaborate, even if in the grand scheme of things Tony would consider them to be rather primitive.  “What do you think?”  They resembled prehistoric cave paintings, but instead of bison and horses, these looked like… well, sabretooths.  He moved his flashlight around, following the progression of drawings.  First there were stick figures chasing the sabretooths, then stick figures running away from the sabretooths, then a bunch of dead stick figures.  Ouch.
Steve tried to shrug casually, like it was nothing.  It
The pencil doesn’t slow, though Steve’s eyes flicker toward Tony briefly.  “Is there somewhere else I should be?”
"Despite what we said to each other the last time I saw you?" Steve couldn't help but ask.
"Thanks, J," Tony replied before turning his attention back to Captain America, who Tony had decided to start calling "Cap" in his head.  "Captain America" was such a mouthful.  "So," he said, "are you really going to be wearing that cowl and costume the whole time?  Don't we get the right to know who you really are?"
Maya laughed a little.  "Well, you're a little more disheveled than I remember, but of course I do.  You're one of the great minds of our time."  She turned to Steve, gaze dropping to his shield.  "And you must be Captain America."
Steve snorted softly, looking down.  "Come on, Tony.  You don't
by a sabretooth, for God’s sake.”
Pepper tilted her head.  "I can see that," she said.  "The ancestors guard her tomb.  So their tiles are the ones that shoot the arrows."
"Yeah," Cap said, squeezing his hand.  So he knew he was holding it, then.  Alright.  "From what I can tell, the attack was an ambush they planned at the last minute when they realized what our trajectory was.  Their goal was probably to get the pieces I was holding, or, barring that, to capture people in our party for either information or for bargaining.  Maybe both."
"Or maybe you would have just been captured too, considering how beaten up you are," Cap replied.
"Ma'am," he managed, holding her at bay as gently as he could, wincing when he saw skin strain and start to tear, "please, I'm here to help!"
Steve looked behind them, realizing their situation was even worse as biters started to emerge from the smoke, the firecrackers having fizzled out.  "You got any more of Natasha's things?" he asked.
Tony pursed his lips.  "Didn't Rhodey give you the talk on how you shouldn't be feeding my ego?  Because this is feeding my ego."
"Okay," Steve said, even though he couldn't help but feel as though he was missing something.  "So your—"
“Nothing’s wrong!” Tony chokes out; Steve has never heard someone sound so unconvincing before.  “Everything’s—everything’s fine.  Perfect.”  He makes another futile effort to pull away.  “Look, thanks again for last night, but we’re done now.  I have no reason to see you again.”
Tony found himself sagging suddenly within the confines of the suit, the joints bending, the back slumping.  It's done, he thought to himself over and over again.  It's done.  It's done.
“It’s way too easy to make you blush.  But it’s a good look for you.  How can I make you do it more often?”  Tony runs his hand down his chest, but before he can get very far, there’s the sound of a key being turned.  “Shit,” Tony whispers, grabbing Steve’s hand and dragging him toward another room.  “This way.”
move—even though Cap was moving, the fragment was still oriented the same way it was at the beginning, the broken edges pointing in the same direction as before.  Tony scrambled to his feet, staring at it.  "The
deserted didn't mean it was, so they kept to the side of the road, eyes peeled for any movement.
Steve let out a deep sigh, rolling his eyes right back.  He didn’t actually argue, though, only turning and leaving, so Tony picked up his gauntlets again, following him out.  They’d come back later—assuming Steve managed to actually catch something, he’d probably want it cooked.  Maybe.  Had Steve’s tastes changed?  He supposed they’d find out.
?" he said.  It hadn't been doing this before; he was sure of it.  But it was hard to deny what he was seeing right now.
"I—" Tony began, and then his throat closed up, and he looked down at his hands, clenching them tight.  "…I'm sorry," he said at last.
“I shouldn’t have either,” Tony admits.
Then he meets Rumiko Fujikawa.  “If you try to romance me with nonsense words, I’ll probably have to hurt you,” she says with a bright grin, and Tony thinks that maybe he’s found the answer to his aching heart.
His gaze lingered on that last item.  His class had recently started translating the French version of some old comics from the 1930s, nothing new there.  But what was up with those double exclamation points? Hell, what was up with all of this, period?
He looks at his father.  Howard will be safe, and he’d cared enough to save Tony as well.  That’s enough for him.  No matter how much they might despise each other at times, Howard is still his father, and Tony is still his son.
Steve smiles, and he can’t help but turn and kiss Tony’s cheek.  “I do,” he says.  “Glad you like it.”
He closed his eyes and sighed.  No, that wasn't true. Here in this life there was Tony, and Tony mattered.  And Steve - Steve needed to make sure that Tony knew that.
Quickly, he turned back into the room, scooping Maya into his arms before taking off again down the hallway.  Half a minute later, he nearly collided with a woman emerging from another room, who gasped and clutched her hand to her heart.  "What did you do to Maya?" she screamed.
"I survived," Steve repeated, blinking slowly at this.  He could hardly believe it.  But as much as he wanted to think about the implications—positive implications, for once—of this revelation, there were still more important things to address first.  "But what happened to Bucky?"
Tony forced himself to stop looking around everywhere.  It was hard, though, considering he was literally sitting in an operating World-War-II-era plane.  Switching with Steve had shown him a lot of things, but until Tony had realized Steve was actually going to become Captain America, he'd never expected anything like
.  Where’s your sense of adventure?  Besides, think of all the notes you’ll get to take.  Fury’ll want to kiss you once you show him all the things you’ve learned.”
Images of his completed homework, of unfamiliar handwriting, of a mysterious phrase all flashed across his mind, but he tried to forget them.  If he followed the train of thought those memories were attempting to lead him toward, he was going to end up someplace very strange, and he didn't think he was ready for that.
Steve nodded but didn't say anything more.  He and Tony turned, heading back to their room and letting themselves inside.  Tony kicked the door shut and rubbed the side of his head.  "This is my fault," he told Steve.  "Fuck.  I'm sorry."
Steve could have done without the sarcasm, but Tony was right.  Things weren't looking good.  If it was just him, he would have broken one of the windows and jumped out, but that wasn't something Tony could do and still be able to run off—especially with his ankle hurt again.  Then he blinked, remembering.  "Natasha's things."
, and I could pretend that maybe I was going with you on an adventure.  I could see new places, try new things.  And I knew that sure, some of the events were probably exaggerated, but I also knew a lot of it was true."  The blush was back on his face again, but still he kept talking.  "I thought… if Tony Stark could do all of these things, then maybe the thought of me doing a fraction of those things wasn't so impossible.  Maybe I could do more than what I was currently doing.  You were—are—an inspiration to me, Mr. Stark."
“You’re hurt,” Tony says.
Steve nods, and they shove their way past several people, Tony gritting his teeth and trying to ignore the ache in his shoulder.  The crowd begins to thin out, but from the looks of it, there are still lifeboats here—Tony’s heart leaps, and for a moment he thinks that everything will be alright after all.
Unfortunately, it definitely seemed real.  No two ways around that. And since Steve wasn't here now, it was up to Tony to do something about it.  "I'm gonna get you some orange juice and toast," he told her. People drank orange juice when they were sick, right?  Of course, in his home he drank freshly-squeezed orange juice whereas here he was pretty sure it came out of a can and had to be cut with water, but juice was juice.
The other reason was that it was
Steve reached forward to take hold of one hand - a hand, Tony was realizing now, that had been clutching at his wrist, his thumb pressed against his vein.  He hadn't even realized he'd retracted that part of the gauntlet.
Steve blinked, thinking about the woman, then looking Stark over.  Something had clearly been wrong with the woman, but Stark looked fine, if tired, which flew in the face of his claim that "everyone" was infected.  Stark must have realized what he was thinking, because he let out another laugh—this one just as bitter as the last—and nodded.  "Yes, I'm infected.  And you probably are too by now.  And I'm telling you this because I—I learned it the hard way.  Let me backtrack again."
Tony cast a helpless glance Cap's way—as predicted, one of the planes was diverting, going after Cap instead.  There was nothing he could do about it right now, not with Rhodey, Pepper, and Jarvis all in the mix.  "Change course, then!"
"This is Captain America," Fury confirmed—needlessly, Tony thought, since it was pretty obvious everyone in the room recognized him.  "This is a government-sponsored mission.  Captain America here will be providing
ride like the wind.”  God, it was a good thing he had plenty of aspirin, because he didn’t want to think of how much this would hurt if he hadn’t been drugged.  Gingerly leaning forward, he awkwardly clutched at fistfuls of Rogers’ fur, which was coarse and bristly in his hands.  “Okay.  Giddyup, boy.”
After Tony’s done reading everything, after he’s done heaving into the trash can and scratching at words that have turned red and inflamed against his wrist, he thinks about one of the most recent memories his backup contains—of the two of them lying in a field of golden poppies and staring up at a sea of stars, a memory in which he’d had everything he’d ever needed or wanted—and then he puts his head in his hands and cries.
"I was not so fortunate as to have its powers impact me directly," the other voice replied coolly.  Tony didn't recognize the speaker, but his gut was telling him it was the man in the wheelchair.  The one who had pursued them so far.  The one, Tony hoped, who they had finally pursued and cornered here.  "But I do know what it does.  And I know you already know.  I don't need to tell you anything."
“I know, I’m sorry,” Tony replies.  “Look, it’s—it’s going to be alright.  Come here.”  Of course, since Steve can’t actually go anywhere, Tony closes the distance between their lips, kissing him for all he’s worth.  Regardless of what happens next… he wants this one last moment with Steve.  “It’s going to be alright,” he repeats afterward, stepping back.
, but he has to try.  Despite everything that’s happened, though, he and Cap still work remarkably well together in battle, and when the fight is finally won, Steve pulls him aside, eyes shining.  “You were amazing up there,” Steve says, and for a second, Tony can’t remember how to breathe with Steve looking at him like that.
They’re on and off, on and off.  Between helping out Steve and the Avengers, battling his own personal enemies as Iron Man, and carrying out his duties as Secretary of Defense, Tony doesn’t always have the time for her, and she doesn’t like it one bit.  Eventually, though, after he gets past the nightmare that is his living armor and the crap that Sunset and Ty Stone throw his way, he thinks he’s got this whole long-term relationship thing figured out.  He introduces Rumiko to Steve and some of the other Avengers.  He calls Happy to ask him for help on how to pick out a wedding ring.  He gets ready to propose, because—because while he doesn’t know if Rumiko is
"You know," Tony said, confused again by Cap's expression.  It was hard to really dwell on it, though, because he was starting to feel increasingly drowsy.  "After we got you into the airship.  I passed out, I guess, but I remember someone petting my hair."
After a few minutes of this, Tony ventured back to the hole, hoping that a paw wasn’t going to appear from within and claw his face off.  Nope—it seemed like Rogers was just standing, glaring at the wall.  “You’re still down there,” Tony said helpfully.
Instead, he spent the day exploring.  He limited himself to areas that he was obviously allowed to be in - maybe if he woke up as Tony a few more times in this house later on he'd be more adventurous, but for now there was more than enough to keep him occupied.  Without classes to take up his time, he was free to spend an almost embarrassing amount of time running around in the massive backyard, enjoying the fact that he could breathe freely and move without all his limbs getting sore.  He could even inspect the multitudes of flowers and other plants in the garden (whoever managed it sure liked lavender, it seemed) without sneezing
Tony flipped to another page, only to realize that he was staring at a drawing of… himself.  He blinked.  What was he doing in here?  He went to the next page, realizing that this, too, was a drawing of him, face lit by the firelight as he studied his gauntlets.  When had Steve done these?
, because Tony had made a career out of getting into dangerous situations and he didn't need to feel safe.  But here he was anyway.
He was, of course, no stranger to waking with assorted ailments.  That was just who he was and what he had to deal with. But the combination of issues he was waking up with today?  That was new and unexpected and thoroughly unpleasant.
His options were limited.  He needed to find the others, but he wanted to minimize the risk of getting shot, friendly or otherwise.  So he pushed himself up into a crouching position, then made his way toward where he thought the pit was, sighing in relief when the ground nearly gave way under his feet—and wasn't
Finally, the radio came back on.  "
Steve turns back to look at him when he speaks, breaking out into a broad smile.  “Tony,” he says.  “I was afraid you weren’t gonna come.”
Tony frowned.  “Dangerous?” he repeated.  “Why?  Because you’re afraid you’ll forget yourself while I’m on you?”  Steve nodded, and Tony waved a hand dismissively in response.  “It’s going to be fine, Steve.  Don’t worry.”  When Steve refused to turn around, Tony just tsked, placing his hands on his hips.  “So what?” he said.  “You want to waste the rest of the day arguing this with me?  Because that’s an awful idea.  But sure, we can just sit here and do nothing, if you want.  It’s your choice, really, because I mean, it’s not like we have to
"No, uh, I took care of that," Cap replied.  Tony wondered what that had entailed, but Cap didn't elaborate, so Tony didn't pry.  "I have medicine for you, too.  So we can go."
Before he could think twice about it, he ripped the drawing in two, then four, then threw the pieces away from him as hard as he could.  But air resistance kept them from going very far, and instead they fluttered quietly to the ground, landing near his feet. Gentle. Soft.  Just like Mom. Just like Steve.
it already, now he actually gets to enjoy it.  So he reaches up to touch his chest once more, brushing one thumb over his nipple, and Tony groans, body jerking like his knees are about to give way.
Tony snorted.  “Didn’t you just give me crap for saying ‘oh’?” he asked, since Steve didn’t look like he was going to punch Tony in the face anytime soon.  “Come on, give me something here.”
—Then watched as the sabretooth merely shook its head, looking no worse for the wear.
His pencil faltered.
Tem was on top of him in an instant, fingers scrambling to grapple with what looked like a clunky ring on his index finger.  "You can't—leave—" he ground out in between the sounds of Tony shooting at the biters outside the press box, and Steve pushed his hands away in time to see a short burst of flame shoot out of the top of the ring.
"Yes, you sounded so convincing just now," Steve said with a frown.  "What were you doing with the paper?"
, so he doesn’t pull away, just continues to run his fingers through the dark strands.
It’s just the two of them now, standing here at the edge of the ship as Sunset’s boat fades into the darkness.  Tony has no idea what they’re supposed to do.
," Natasha said.  Her eyes were wide and pleading.  If she was acting—which was, apparently, not out of the question, given her past occupation—she was doing a very good job of it.  "I don't care about your weapons or your company or any of that.  I can't imagine why you would.  I just need to know what happened to my James.  Please.  Yelena aside, he is everything to me."
, now have I?”
He didn't want to give up.
," Cap said, far too quickly to be convincing.  "Hold still.  I gotta clean this."  He shifted Tony's arm, then started to dab at the edges of the wound with the cloth.
“What’s this about?” Tony asks, and when the lawyer delivers a handwritten note containing the final wishes of Captain America, Tony’s heart nearly stops beating.
Grimacing, Tony slung both his and Steve’s packs onto his good shoulder, then picked up the shield, because he’d be damned if he was going to leave any of their stuff behind.  Once he was ready to go, he took off, heading in Steve’s general direction—what else could he do?  They’d come this far; Tony wasn’t going to abandon him now.  But really, damn the man.
The sound he'd made, muffled as it was, nonetheless ended up being enough to rouse Tony, who jolted awake and turned to him with wide eyes.  "Oh, thank God," he breathed, standing up before one leg apparently gave way.  Steve's own eyes went wide, but his reflexes felt sluggish, and all he could do was watch helplessly as Tony tumbled to the ground.  A moment later, though, Tony pushed himself back up, shaking his head.  "Sorry.  I'm fine.  Let me get this off you."  He carefully peeled off the tape over Steve's mouth, then fished out the ball of gauze that had been stuffed in there.  Afterward, he limped off, returning with a glass of water and holding it up to Steve's lips.  "How're you feeling?"
“Yes,” Steve says, and he nods in the direction of the quinjet, which Tony can see is parked some distance away.  Before Tony can ask what on earth he’s doing, though, Steve carefully sits down and brings out a sketchbook.
"Okay, I'll be serious now," said Tony's voice.  It was quieter but louder at the same time, and Tony could imagine himself speaking softly, intimately, his lips close to the laptop's microphone.  "Hey, Tony. You don't know me, but my name is Steve Rogers, and I've been you for a day."
"Wait, wait," Tony said, holding his good arm up.  He hadn't even had a chance to provoke anyone yet!  "What did Rhodey say?"
So Tony fired again.  In hindsight, this was probably an awful idea, because it caused the sabretooth to lash out, clawing blindly at his chest as Tony cried out in pain, automatically shooting again in response.  “Rogers, fuck, for the love of God, get this thing off me—”
“Tony!” he cries out, heart leaping into his throat as he sees the other man leap off the boat, back onto the ship.  Dimly, he can hear Tony’s father shouting something, but he tunes it out; he tunes
Before he could dwell on it any further, Ty distracted him from the question of his clothes by informing him he was going to leave now so he could speak to one of their teachers before practice, and Tony was left to get dressed and head down to the field alone.  He was late by a minute, having had an absurd amount of trouble finding some of his things, but Ty was even later so it didn't matter.
He was also, despite the silly little wings on his cowl, very, very handsome.  Tony had never seen his entire face, but the propaganda pictures he had saved on his laptop were more than enough to outline the squareness of his jaw, the broadness of his shoulders, the sureness of his smile.
out, because Tony—Tony’s back on the ship, and oh God, what on earth is he
Stark shook his head slowly.  "It was a long time ago," he said, even if the tone of his voice and the tension in his body screamed that it was anything but.
"The shards against the window—"
“S-sounds nice,” Steve replies with a tiny smile.  “C-can’t wait.”  He hesitates, then continues, “B-but before we head west… I-I wanna go to B-Brooklyn.  M-my mother… s-she’s buried there.  Cy-Cypress Hills Cemetery.  H-her name is Sarah Rogers.  W-will you come with me, Tony?  To v-visit her?”
“Tony,” Steve says, and his voice sounds broken, hurt.  “Tony, please look at me.”
Jarvis, maybe?  Tony had mentioned someone with that name coming to pick him up and had also dropped that he was the best cook
hard enough, he can smell the soap Steve uses and feel his warmth beside him.
"You can't tell me you never killed a man during the war, Steve."
"What," Tony whispered into the microphone anyway.
"Is it strange if I blame myself for what happened with Birch?" Tony asked softly as he stared up at the ceiling of the plane.  Because he did.  Rationally, he knew he'd done the right thing.  Birch had harmed his company and his employees.  Jail was the correct place for him to be.  But—what had he
Finally, he was done.  There were still a few small things lying around that Tony wasn't sure what to do with, so he figured it was better to play it safe and hold onto them instead of just throwing them out.  One was a box, which Tony sat down on the floor with as he regarded it curiously. Would Steve be mad if Tony took a look? Considering how everything else had been labeled, he had to assume that if Steve really didn't want him to look, he would have written as much on the box.
Tony closed his eyes, took a deep breath, then exhaled slowly.  He wasn't thrilled about the situation, but he also wasn't in a state to fight Cap on this.  It was better than not going at all, in any case.  "Fine," he said.
he’d been traveling the world, searching for something, anything that would fix him.  And for years he’d been slowly losing hope.  When he made the decision to fight in the war, he did so believing that it wouldn’t even matter if he was gunned down, because he was going to drop dead soon anyway.  But he’d lived, and he’d come to the Savage Land, and now… now he’d found it.  Now he’d found what he’d been looking for.
Tony makes a quiet sound in the back of his throat, pressing closer to Steve’s hand as he shivers violently.  “Me, too.”  He wants eternity with Steve.  These last two days have been the happiest of his life, but it’s not enough.  It’ll never be enough.  “M-maybe… o-once we get to land… I’ll t-t-take us to California.  I hear it’s w-warm there.”
Tony sighed to himself, putting all the letters back where he'd found them.  Maybe he needed to stop feeling annoyed. It wasn't Steve's fault. It wasn't anyone's fault.  Steve had been trying to help Tony in the only way he knew how, and would it really kill Tony to try and respect his wishes?
He’d forgotten.  They’d lowered themselves down here on a piece of rope.
On the second day, Tony found what he was looking for.
Sunset scoffs, setting the turbine back down.  “Tony Stark wants to be a proper gentleman,” she says.  “I never thought I’d see the day.”
Well, he’s not running away.  This is a good sign.  So Tony steps forward, heart pounding in his chest as he closes the distance between them—and still, Steve makes no move.  “I changed my mind,” he tells him.
Wind whistling past his ears, the Atlantic rushing ever closer, muscles tensing as he braced for impact, and then cold—so cold—and then—
“Go where?” Steve asks, voice soft like he’s afraid to hear the answer.
So he stepped forward, and he could feel his own pulse jump when Steve stepped forward as well, his gaze fixated on him.  Rationally, he knew the others were watching, but he was barely aware of them anymore: at long last, it was just him and Steve, here in the same place and at the same time, meeting one another's eyes.
Tony didn't reply.  Instead, a few minutes passed, and Steve heard the soft sounds of snoring—it seemed as though he'd fallen asleep.  Steve decided to follow suit, praying to himself as he drifted off that it would be okay if he trusted Tony Stark again.
"There are bones everywhere," Rhodey commented, voice strained as his flashlight moved along the edges of the walls, which were lined with skeletons.  At least Tony wasn't alone in his discomfort.
make a plan based on what they found.  Whatever the plan was, though, it couldn't involve their suits, which had been left on the airship with Jarvis.  The Iron Man and War Machine outfits were too heavy to carry for long periods of time, and in any case, their goal was to find something, not to fight other people.
He doesn’t realize it at the time, but what she tells him that day changes his life.
“Everything?”  Tony purses his lips.  “Alright, that’s not fair.  Or maybe it is.  What can I say?  Sunset wants to marry me because I’m rich and have a famous father, who gets mad when I want to design airplanes and thinks money made me soft and that everything I do is embarrassing.”  He pauses, then smirks.  “He has a point about the embarrassing part, I’ll admit.”
Cap shook his head.  "You didn't see enough," he said, his voice level even as they heard more commotion from above.  His hand wasn't raised, but Tony could see it at his side, clenched.  It seemed like the ring was—well—
There was another explosion, followed by the sounds of shuffling getting louder and louder—the biters were coming back down the stairs, and Steve was only a few feet away from the staircase.
Eventually, he had to accept that he just wasn't going to find the answers he needed, and he brought an end to his feverish search.  He used his new spare time to finally branch out socially, making new friends, new lovers who would never have an inkling that he'd spent part of his life sharing his body with the most wonderful, stubborn soul he'd ever known.  And when some of those people he met hurt and betrayed him, he would remember the things Steve had said to him in his darker times, and then he would pretend that the voicelogs were from yesterday instead of yesteryear and take some small comfort in it.
At the end of the two weeks, they crossed the Saint John River, and just like that, they were on American soil.  The homecoming was not nearly as sweet as Steve had imagined back when the war was still raging, and yet—he felt something inside him relax at being
"I know it's been a few years and maybe you've forgotten about me - "  Here Tony jolted, realizing suddenly that maybe Steve had thought the same thing that Tony had thought: because Tony, too, had long since broken the habit of leaving behind updates specifically for Steve when enough time had passed that it didn't seem like there was any point to it anymore, even though Steve had remained in his thoughts every damn day of his life - "but I wanted you to know that I never did, and I thought of you every single day.  God, I hope you're okay with hearing that, 'cause it's the truth.
Fascinated, Steve started to listen to the other rows, realizing that this was some sort of audio journal left by Tony himself.  It was an almost surreal experience, hearing words spoken in his voice while knowing that he wasn't the one who said them, but Steve couldn't stop.  It was a window into this person that he'd dreamt up, one whose brain seemed to move faster than he could speak, who spoke excitedly of flight and robotics and energy.  He mentioned his Ma often, and Ty frequently came up as well, though curiously there wasn't any mention of his Pa. Tony even mentioned Indiana Jones - something about how he couldn't wait to see it - and Steve wondered if he should feel bad about having declined Ty's offer for it (whatever it was).
Tony winces, suddenly realizing that in those four words his father has already shown more interest in Steve’s side of things than he has.  Nngh.  If they escape this dinner alive and Steve is still talking to him… he’ll have to fix that.  “Isn’t that a bit personal?” he asks, twitching at the idea of Howard mocking… whatever it is that Steve does.
Was… was he going to go on a double date with Arnie?
happened with Dorothy?"
"So," Cap continued, "if we don't want him to sneak off—because you can't man the airship and keep an eye on him at the same time—we have to bring him with us."  He looked at Tony, and this time his gaze stayed.  "So
“Spill it,” Tony demands, ignoring her sarcasm because he can tell she’s still hiding something.  “You’re plotting something.”
When Tony comes to in a washed-out hospital room, Maya and Sal are there, telling him what happened in the aftermath and assuring him that none of this was his fault as Steve hovers anxiously outside.  Tony accepts their reassurances as best he can—that is, not particularly well at all—and goes back to sleep, not because his body needs it, but because his mind does.  He might not have been the one who decided to kill a bunch of people with his suits, but their blood is on his hands anyway.
“No, this is perfect.  You’re right on time.  You know.  Right on time for being early.”  He looks Steve over from top to bottom.  He looks charming; really, he does, though it’s a shame that the leather jacket is the only thing of value he has, even if it looks divine on him.  “Though I’m afraid you’re never going to make it in like this.”
But Steve knew him.  He knew Tony in a way he'd never known anyone else.  How could he not, when he had spent so many of his days living his life?  Tony was - vain, sometimes. Brash. He thought highly of himself and while he might have had every reason to, it bordered on arrogance.  And yet - there was more to him than that. Even from the beginning, Tony had tried to help Steve in his own way. He'd discouraged Dougie from beating him up for a day and attempted to reconnect with Arnie by showing an interest in dating.  Beyond that, he'd always been so patient in explaining the programming and science lessons he'd been taking so Steve wouldn't be completely lost. He'd spent time with Ma in her last days instead of leaving the house to go have fun. He'd complimented Steve's art.  Over and over again, he acted like he was so cool and detached, but his actions told a different story. He was Tony, and he was soft, and...
“Tony!” Steve scolds, squeezing his hand.  “Is it really a good idea to anger them right now?”
"Not at all," Stark replied as he started mixing the threads of twine into the moss.  "But they're not very fond of smoke."
And yet—Tony
He holds the gun to his chest for a moment, breathing hard as he stares into space.  He’s running out of time, and this is the best he’s got.  It’s going to have to be enough.  Accepting this, he heads back into the hall, looking down it—and then he freezes.  Jesus Christ.  In the time it’s taken for him to find this one hope, the hallway looks nearly flooded.  It’s unsettlingly dark near the end, and one of the lights is flickering irregularly.  It’d send chills up his spine, if his spine wasn’t already currently soaking in freezing water.  As bad as things look right now though, he doesn’t have a choice.  He needs to get to Steve before it’s too late.
He manages to get to a friend’s house that night, makes him swear not to tell anyone before collapsing onto his couch and passing out for the next twelve hours.  The next morning, he borrows some money—because hell, he’s just lost his entire life with the sinking of the ship—and then he goes out to buy some flowers.
“Right,” Tony said, biting his lip.  He didn’t like this.  He didn’t like this one bit.  But what could they do?  The other exit was a pit Rogers couldn’t get out of.  Here, he had a chance… it was just that if Rogers messed up, he’d end up dying as a result.  And Tony really didn’t want him to die.
"You didn't know that going in," Natasha said, waving him off.  "My point is, there is no way for me to reasonably repay you.  But I'd like to try."  She pulled out one of her Makarovs and offered it to Steve.  "I noticed you had no gun."
There was a long pause.  "Sleep well, sunshine boy," the woman whispered at last, and then she closed the door all the way, leaving Tony in the dark.
There it was, the gulf between them.  The reason Tony had taken his hand and then pulled back.  The reason they had parted ways.
Steve looked at him.  Tony thought he could see something in his eyes—it looked almost like sadness, and Tony found himself terrified that Steve might be able to read him, to know what was going on in his head.  That was the last thing that he wanted.  Steve liked him.  Tony didn't want that to change.
about this place.
the third time, because he heard an answering cry, which was good, but not good enough.  "Cap?" he called as he held his sleeve to his face in a vain attempt to breathe in less of whatever was around him right now.  "Rhodey?  Pepper?"
Rogers shone his light against a wall.  “I feel like the drawings are different.”
The airship was gone, lifted back up into the skies where it would… well, Tony wasn’t sure.  Fury had promised them that every day for seven days, the airship would return to this spot at noon and pick them up if they were here.  And considering that his heart was running on a battery, if after seven days they were a no-show, then it would probably be safe to assume that they were dead.
Huh.  He hadn’t expected Rogers to have any experience with magic, much less be able to identify it—but then again, he’d heard of some weird stuff happening during the war.  Well, it didn’t matter.  Tony rolled his eyes, waving one hand.  “You probably don’t trust anything that wasn’t made in America.  I’m going to pick it up.”
The plane fired again, and this time a bullet hit Tony right in the arm.
“You can do this,” Tony said again, terrified.  “Rogers.  Steve.  Fuck.  Get your ass up here because I’m not doing this for you.  Come on.”  There had to be something he could do.  Maybe—maybe he could swing back and somehow kick Rogers up?  No, that was no good; he’d probably dislodge him.  Could he just try grabbing onto one of his paws anyway?  No, then they’d probably both fall.  God, he hated this.  He hated being useless.
Tony shrugged.  "What were you going to do after the war ended?"
For several nights after that, Tony curls up in his room alone, staring down at the words on his arm and wondering how things had gone downhill so fast.  So maybe the quote hadn’t quite evoked her image as much as it maybe should have, he admits to himself.  Still, though—his
not when you were acting completely on impulse, just so damn glad to see him alive again that kissing was the only thing you could think to do.
He let go so Tony could sit up and take a look as well.  Tony did so, cursing softly afterward.  "I didn't even see it.  God, I'm so sorry, Steve."
.  And if dinosaurs were here, if they could somehow exist in this land out of time… then surely something magical could be here too.  He just had to find it.
It was Steve's turn to look away this time.  "I was wrong," he said again.  "I think… when we last talked, before I went under the ice, I was too quick to judge.  I saw all of the bad in what you'd done and none of the good.  And once that happened, it was just… so easy to let it build up in my head, to make myself think your intentions were worse than they were.  And it took me seeing you almost die today to realize I'd taken all this too far."  He glanced back at Tony then, meeting his eyes.  "I'm tired of being angry at you.  I miss you.  And no matter what I think of you—and no matter what
"Yeah, well, there you go," Tony said.  As he'd known already with the booze and robot-malfunction thing, Ty was much more likely to just go along with a story if it involved Tony screwing up somehow.  "So you go. Have fun."
Tony wished he'd brought his notes with him, though rationally he knew it would have been silly to plan to take reams of oracle bone photos along, and in any case, he'd memorized most of it already.  Still.  "The oracle bones talk about a woman named Fu Hao.  She was one of the wives of a ruling king, but more importantly, she was both a general and high priestess.  Both were unusual for a woman at the time, so for her to even be one or the other implied that she must have been extraordinary.  And we know that the people asking the gods questions with the oracle bones did so with the help of our friend the tiger circle, and we also know
Ma picked up her wooden spoon, stirring the pot.  It smelled like lima bean and barley soup. "Do you know who you're going to bring?" she continued.  Evidently she hadn't heard him.
Steve considered it.  "I'm probably immune."
He turned and left, and it was just Tony now in the burnt-out room.  He spent the next hour moving things around and fiddling with configurations and controls as Cap was in and out, giving him updates about the ship's status and at one point making him take some pills that Tony didn't want to take, but Cap insisted.  Finally he flopped back into the pilot's seat, wiping his brow.  His skin was itching again, and though the pills helped (not that he'd admit that to Cap), it didn't dull everything completely.
“How’d
Steve laughs, and even though it’s weak and a little pained, Tony still thinks it’s beautiful.  “M-me too,” he says.  “B-but it’s okay.  W-when this is all over, w-we can find another car t-to lie down in.”
The Japanese would be the most immediate threat once they landed, and Jarvis had wanted to minimize that risk by avoiding the Chinese coast, where most of the soldiers would be gathered.  In any case, it was a lot faster to approach Yinxu from this direction, and if the Nazis were also looking for the other pieces, then time was of the essence.
Happiness, he thought, and he opened his eyes back up and pressed his fingertips against the reflection of the tears on his face.
He felt himself hoping that he would never see any of them again so that he wouldn't have to face such a choice, and then he felt ashamed.
And life slowly, agonizingly goes on.  Tony has nightmares every time he falls asleep.  He hallucinates Steve’s presence when he’s awake.  The words on his wrist burn and itch even though Extremis tells him that part of his body is no different from any other.
He wonders, sometimes, after fighting off yet
Was that how she saw it?  Tony felt like Steve was just throwing away every chance at a relationship that Tony was giving him, but maybe she had a point.  Still - "I think at this rate, I'll probably never find someone." That was a concerning possibility to Tony. Steve was a nice guy.  He should have a girlfriend. A boyfriend would be fine too, but Tony doubted Steve swung that way.
"Okay," Tony replied softly.  Steve didn't know if he really meant it, but… it was a start, at least.
There was a caption beneath one of them.  Tony leaned down, trying to read the writing in the fading light.
"Indiana Jones tonight.  With the
“You’re not gonna fall over.”  And Steve sounds so damn assured of this fact that Tony finds himself relaxing almost instantly, leaning back into his solid presence—though as soon as he does, his mind starts to find something else to fret about.  They’re standing here at the bow of the ship, their bodies pressed close together in a way that’s hard to ignore.  What if someone sees them?
Tony leaned back in his chair.  "Right.  Your job is to fight the bad guys, from what I heard."  When Cap didn't immediately voice an objection, Tony continued, "So I gotta ask, what are you doing here?  Seems like you'd do a lot more good staying in Europe—and yet you yourself said coming along was your idea."
him talk, one way or another.
"It was nothing," Cap replied.  "You know some brave people, Mr. Stark."
“I do, but—”
, was that painful to think about.  Maybe—maybe he was still alive.  Maybe he’d just run off somewhere to tend to his wounds.  Either way, though… forget just retrieving the shield, he decided.  Tony needed to avenge the hell out of him.
Steve forced his eyes open.  Tony looked so worried. There were wrinkles around his eyes and his face was pale.  Steve had done this.
A shadow fell over him, and at long last, Steve was able to pull his eyes away from the woman, looking up at the shooter instead.  Rifle in one hand, trimmed facial hair that had probably seen better days, and blue, blue eyes…
Steve glanced at Tony to make sure he was okay with all this.  Tony nodded, shrugging the shoulder with Maya's bag slung over it, and started to follow her, Steve quickly doing the same.
rambling on about.  And that… that was a new feeling.  Someone listening to him talk because they knew it made him happy.
, that hurt.  So he tried again with his left arm, rubbing at his eyes before blearily blinking up at her.  "Hi," he said.
"We knew each other," Tony said.  "I think—I think he was under the impression that I hadn't paid much attention to him, maybe.  I don't know."  He went silent for a while, thinking about all the people he had known.  "I'd like to think that I was an okay boss.  I tried.  But maybe I didn't try hard enough."
Tony’s brow furrowed, not sure what to make of this.  “Well, we didn’t look at all the drawings,” he said at last.  And after being so let down by the ones on the wall of the giant igloo, he didn’t want to look at any of them now.  “I’m sure there’s some we missed.”
"You better.  Now get outta here so you don't make liars out of yourselves."
Cap looked at him wide-eyed.  "What do you mean?"
“What are you going to do?” his father snarls, gripping him so hard it hurts.  “Are you going to go back to him?  He’s nothing!  He’s a stain, a smear, worth less than grime underneath your nails—”
Steve looks back at him.  “We were on a
For a moment, all he can hear is the ringing of the bullet in his ears; all he can see is a flash of white around him.  But then the white fades, the ringing disappears, and he’s back in a flooding room with Steve gripping at a pole.  His eyes drop down to his wrists at the same time he hears Steve cry out, “Tony, you did it!”
Stark sighed, and for a moment Steve was afraid he was going to delay this response, too.  "First off, that wasn't a question, that was a judgment.  Second, you didn't seem willing to push her off, and if you hadn't, she would have bit you.  Third, she only counted as alive in the most technical sense.  She was dead already in every way that mattered."
Lunch?  That seemed to imply Ty wouldn't be joining him for the first two classes, which in turn implied they'd be in different classrooms despite being in the same grade.  He'd known that the school was pricey, but it was hard to wrap his head around just how much all that money could afford.
Tony had to admit that wasn't something he was particularly looking forward to.  Still, he could deal with it.  "So which one is your favorite?"
Steve pushed himself back up, then pulled the shovel out and tossed it at Tony.  He missed.  "I want answers," he replied, picking up Bucky's body and hefting it over his shoulder in a fireman's carry.  "But I don't think I'll get them.  So at the very least we need to get your blueprints back.  Natasha will want proof."
"We have to get out of here," Tony said to him.
Tony turned around, glaring at him.  “What?  How can you have a bad feeling?  Just look at it.”  It was potential life.  Potential salvation.
“By almost jumping off of giant ships?”
All in all, not exactly the stronghold of magic he’d hoped for.
Tony tries not to laugh, since laughing would just make his father even angrier.  In spite of all his blushing, Steve has a spine!  “That’s right,” he adds.  “Wouldn’t it be awful if everyone found out how you treat your guests?”
But then again, he’s heard other things too, seen troubled glances passed from crew member to crew member, and slowly but surely, the truth is dawning on him—their ship is sinking.  Their ship is
Suddenly, an idea springs to mind—a glorious, wonderful idea, sure to displease both Sunset and his father.  Hell, why not?  He might as well have
“Tony!” Steve squeaks, though he finds that his hands automatically settle on his hips.  “What if someone finds us, then?”
Surely, he thought, it didn't mean what it sounded like it meant.  Ma had been sick often, it was true. But had it really gotten that bad?  Steve would have written about it earlier if it had, right?
