"Steve? I'm coming in." Nat walked into the door. Tony stood in the hall, his hands were tugging at his own hair. Tears fogged Tony's eyes. He didn't want to lose
"Yeah? I think so too." Tony took a deep breath. "Just imagine. You, Peter, and I. All living together and happy. And-" A knock interrupted the conversation.
Dan pulled back and licked his lips. "Good isn't he?" Tony was distracted, so Steve backed away. "Awe come on Stevie." Steve kept backing away until he felt his back hit the wall.
"Captain, I'm Doctor Sackler. Our policy states that we are to call your emergency contact unless you otherwise specify. Considering the state you were in we called Miss. Romanoff. I'd like to go over your injuries, so I'm going to have to ask Mr. Stark to leave at this time."
"It was the meeting, for Stark Industries. The guy said he wanted to make sure the companies would make a 'good fit.' And Tony agreed." Steve took a sip of water, then buried his head in his hands. "He made me- He told me to get on my knees. If I hadn't, he would've pulled out of the deal, and Tony would've been mad. I couldn't help myself from backing away. Then when he was done with that, he told me to beg for help. When I refused, he threw me against the wall and kept hitting me, then- he- I couldn't stop him."
"You haven't broken up with him yet?" Bucky turned to Steve. His voice sounded mad, but his features were soft, and his eyes were wide.
"Wait. Nat." She turned around, and Steve was trying to control his breathing and trying not to fall over.
"Steve?" Tony's voice came over the speakers. "Your phone is ringing. I'm putting it over the speakers so you can talk."
"Sure." Steve stood up and leaned over, grabbing the empty bottle from Nat. As Steve walked to the bar, Clint started to tell a story about Nat. Steve simply ignored the story and everyone's laughter and thought about how he enjoyed the time with his friends. He loved seeing everyone smiling and laughing, especially Tony. That's why he fell for him in the first place. Aside from his snarky remarks and sarcastic tone, Tony was funny and cute and his smile made Steve's world a little brighter.
"Just say what we all know, and we can help you." She put a hand in his hair softly. "Steve. Please."
Steve grunted. He could now move his fingers slightly. He kept wiggling them until he got tired. Then after a brief moment of resting, he started wiggling his fingers again. Then his toes.
"Dan Alma said that he didn't think we'd make a good fit." Steve was still frozen under the freezing water. "I bet he thought it was a good fit when he was fucking you. You know what Steve? I give you one fucking job and you failed. I can't believe you! I figured all you had to do was let him fuck you and considered how much of a fucking slut you are, you would've been fine."
The elevator doors opened and Steve rushed out carrying four pizzas. He wheezed lightly. Steve quickly set the pizzas down on the table and walked to the bar. He grabbed a bottle of water and drank as fast as he could.
A door opened in front of Steve, and he was pushed through. The moving stopped, and Steve could vaguely hear the doctor talking to someone.
"Wait." He demanded. The woman stood outside the elevator completely still. She eventually broke eye contact only to look at the ground. The doors closed again, and Tony threw himself on Steve.
The doors opened, startling Steve. He walked out and swiftly made his way to the washing machine. There was still detergent that he and Peter used before they left. When he had finished putting the laundry in, Steve took a breath. His hands still shook and he felt jumpy.
"Peter if Tony says one bad thing, he can get you taken away! I'd never see you again. Do you want that?" Steve was almost yelling.
"Great. Thank you Friday!" Steve walked into the kitchen and started to search the cabinets for ingredients. As he gathered his cooking supplies, he suddenly was overcome by the realization of where he was.
"Goodnight Steve." Tony turned around and grabbed a small vase and threw it at the wall. It made a loud bang when it hit the wall, and then when it shattered and hit the floor.
"Boss says he left some clothes for you to wear on the bed." Steve gently cleared his throat then quietly thanked Friday.
"Shut up." Tony snapped at him. Steve's mouth snapped shut, and he looked down noticing his arms were shaking. "What'd you tell them?"
"Stevie!" Tony shoved Natasha out of the way and ran to Steve. "Breathe, baby. Breathe. Go get his inhaler! I left it in the living room."
"Steve? What's wrong?" Clint walked into Steve's room, and was surprised by how loud the wheezing was. "Is that you?"
"Tony you shouldn't be drinking this much." Steve tried to grab the bottle but Tony snatched it away and took another sip.
"T-Tony." Steve squirmed. "Tony-agh!" Clint heard Steve's yell from the floor above. "Tony- pl-please. You're hurting me. Plese!" Steve grabbed Tony's wrist, but Tony took his hand from Steve's hair and wrapped it around his throat.
"Wait." Steve turned back to Peter. "Please be safe Dad." Peter walked up to Steve and wrapped his arms around him. Steve hesitated, but quickly wrapped his arms around Peter, and buried his face in his hair. Steve held back tears as he let go of Peter and opened the door.
Sam stood in by the stove, and glanced between the two. "Well if you won't talk, I will. Dinner is ready. Just grab a plate and help yourself."
"Pete, I'm so sorry." Steve looked Peter through tears. "Your mother told me not to tell you until you were older."
"Call someone." He slowly dragged himself out of the elevator propped on his forearms. Every time he dragged himself forward, he winced.
Tony grabbed a towel and gently cleaned Steve up, he threw the towel to the side then put another pair of clothes on Steve. He then pulled the sheets out from under him and balled them up. Tony then threw them out. Neither he nor Tony needed to be reminded of the worst night of both of their lives. Tony remade the bed, then undid the restraints on Steve's hands. Lastly, Tony cuddled up to Steve, hugging him protectively.
"Beca-" Steve was cut off by a harsh cough. "Nat doesn't need-" another cough, "to be- bothered." By the end of the sentence, Steve was coughing loudly.
"I'll just leave it next to your bed." Steve set the bag down next to his bed and paused. "Peter, I'm so sorry. I don't mean to be selfish, and I'll try to work things out with Tony. I just need a little time away from him. I'll have you back for your friends in the city soon. I'm sorry Pete. I love you." Steve sighed.
"It's alright. It's fine. We just have to make sure you don't bleed through the gown." Tony tied the gown and lightly put his hand on Steve's shoulder. "How are you feeling?"
"I deserved to know." Tony repeated. They stopped again, and the ding of the elevator rang through the quiet. When the doors opened, Tony pulled Steve into the elevator.
"No. He told me to go to the bathroom and get cleaned up. He was being so loving and genital and I melted into him. After the... meeting, my body- well it... reacted. When he noticed, he brought me into the bedroom."
A tall brunette man walked in and held his hand out to him. He was bigger than Steve, but Tony confidently walked up to him.
"No. I'm leaving!" Tony stood up, slamming the part he was working on, onto the counter. "I'll be back later. Don't leave." Tony Stood up and walked to the elevator. "Let's go."
"Pete I'm not your father." The tears stopped falling from Steve's eyes. His voice shook and he thought he might throw up, but his crying stopped. "I've kept in contact with your mother."
"Clean that mess up." Tony stomped away, and returned with a chair. "Move!" He yelled at Steve, who stood completely still, except he was shaking.
"Steve. we aren't here to judge you. We want to support you. You can tell us, or don't either way, we're here for you."
"Good." He lifted the brake, and propped open the door. "Also, I'm sorry but no guest are allowed into radiology. Sorry." He nodded to Tony.
"A little something I made today. I actually got the idea from those pharmaceutical reps that were talking about- well actually, it doesn't matter. Your muscle mass won't change but you'll feel pain at a much higher rate and you will heal at a slower rate. I didn't want to do this to you, but you need to learn how to act. You are nothing more than a slut for my enjoyment."
"Hey relax. All we are going to do today is relax. I'm going to take you to the med bay, then we can watch movies all day and deal with all of this when you're ready."
Steve couldn't sleep. The hard ground he was forced to sleep on didn't bother him nor was the deep purple bruise just above his right knee. The cold was keeping him awake.
"I thought everyone on the team knew that we were dating?" Steve tried to go faster to his room, but he put too much weight on his knee and collapsed.
"You shouldn't be telling me what to do." Tony finished the bottle and set it down. He slid close to Steve and rests his head on his shoulder. "Did I tell you that I really like those pants on you?" Tony reached down to grab Steve's ass, but his hand was swatted away.
Tony made a point of putting his phone down before continuing. "Steve. What I did was beyond wrong... No, what I've done to you over our entire relationship is completely and utterly disgusting. I know I've done horrible things, but I'm hoping we can- that I can fix this and make it better." Tony paused to watch Steve fidget with his hands. "Steve please look at me."
The time bugged him, because usually he woke up about four (meaning, as he actually slept around three thirty, didn’t really get that much sleep at all) for the past two weeks. It was disconcerting to finally wake up an hour late, but apparently his dreams were much more forgiving this time around; it wasn’t about the ice, nor Bucky, nor Peggy, but Tony.
“You bet I did.” Tony boasted, smugness lacing into his tone. Then, his face shifted into a soft smile. “Stayed up all night for you.”
Tony faced him fully, shifting his position until they were face-to-face. “Would… you, want that, Steve?”
“Yes,” he nodded resolutely, and Tony gave a sweet smile at that. “So, you have that, and I have my super-secret life. I just kind of thought that it might be… um, impossible?” He shrugged. “Not that I don’t believe in those, anymore.”
He closed his eyes for a moment, thinking of inane equations—and woke up several hours, startling him.
Tony went silent, before bending forward to get closer to him. “I’m going to run permutations,” Tony tapped the pen on his temple. “To see if there’s a possibility that we could meet again.”
“Just the good things.” Steve murmured. “And a little of other things in between. Alright, so… I actually despise cold environments that much—because in the past, as I grew up, I’d have the worst colds…”
doing it out of all people. He was pointedly not talking to him too. Was this their farce for a while? Do they pretend like they don’t know each other?
“Now you’re just mocking me.” Tony sighed, as he recognized his earlier action. “But fine, I’m going to
(The winds had whipped his hair in a haphazard fashion, but he paid it no heed. He had raised his head to call the man as he descended down from the helicopter. “Dr. Banner?”
wearing an inconspicuous coat, shades, rubber shoes, an ACDC shirt and pants. He looked normal, wanted to look normal, because he didn’t need paparazzi hounding his ass just to buy a vodka bottle.
The man gave him a once over—Tony involuntarily gave him a wink, making the man blush bright—before breaking out into a run once more, but more hastily, like he was embarrassed.
Chocolate-brown eyes looked at him inquisitively, and he knew what was coming. “Right, you say that when you’re looking at me. Don’t tell me you’re getting ready to kidnap me, you actually knew me all along, blondie.” He had an uneasy, but sharp grin on his face. “Just admit it so I can throw my money right now. Come on now. I won’t bite.”
“What’s with the permission?” he countered, lips tilting up into a smile. “You’ve got a whole night, honey.”
Italian was a safe ground to be on, right? Usually people loved Italian, and it was a pleasure to have despite all of the herbs and spices they put in the food.
and he doesn’t know what to do with that, because it’s just been two weeks since Peggy was gone, and they never got their dance, and here’s someone on the verge of his fingertips once again.
The ride was quiet, except timid murmur of the radio. The taxi driver seemed to sense the somber mood, and didn’t talk to them, until they reached the pier, a sight that Tony knew would be a good view for the sunrise.
Not a second after the door closed, Steve had already placed the bags on the table, and had his arms crossed.
“I’ve been having a fun time and I’ve been a jerk for doing—doing that, to you, Steve. I see it now.” He slumped his shoulders. “Look, if there’s something you have to know about me, it’s that I flirt. A lot. Like it’s second to how I breathe and create, I flirt. That’s.” He helplessly gestured to everything. “That’s how Tony the Billionaire works.”
“There you go again, Steve,” Tony said gently. “Come on, I’m not good at opening up, but I’m trying here.”
He might’ve said he was Iron Man somewhere, and that ever since Afghanistan and Justin Hammer with his stupid lasso-throwing lackey he was going to be too much for Pepper, which is why she broke up with him. The fact that he yelled at Rhodey and debated on stopping War Machine because of the incident with Justin Hammer. The fact that he screened people three to five times in Stark industries because he can’t trust anyone easily anymore, not after Obie, not after Natalie.
“Oh great, three years off! I’m getting good at recognizing ages now. Yeah, you’re young, I’m kind of, and we both look like we’re not going to do anything as of now. So why not be with me, born-and-raised Manhattan man, tour you around?”
“Press, yes,” Steve nodded, and stood up again. “Your eyebrows twitch when you get exasperated by something. I’ve gotten that look a lot of times today.”
“A guy named Ferrero who makes chocolate and hazelnut?” Tony asked, skeptical. “That’s way too much of a coincidence. Was he reincarnated or something?”
again. “Not anyone else’s. I’m going to date the hell out of you. Bring you to—to movies. Introduce you to the current century. That’s going to be my job.”
to this? He never stopped stroking the fire that was too dangerous for his hands. He never stopped being—being
“I will gloss over the part you called me beast, because that guy turns out alright in the end, so yes.” Tony clicked his tongue. “Also thank you, that’s another point to my ego, you’re doing wonders to my self-esteem, sweetheart.”
because you’re going to have the talk. The talk that could make or break their… unique relationship, and if there’s anything that he wants constant in his life, are unique relationships.
“I don’t think so.” He answered, curling his over Tony’s neck. “I still have the rotisserie chicken in me, and that apple I had for like, a minute before we left.”
unquote?” He peered to look at Steve’s expression and laughed at the twitch that his eyebrow did. “Oh come on, Steve. You totally need the food. For a growing guy like you, it’s mandatory. You spent your time in the gym day and night or something?”
Tony huffed a laugh at that, “—was a normal place. It wasn’t overwhelming, for me, I think. But there were so much people, and it reminded me of a different… time, and I was staring at the clock because…”
Tony chuckled for a moment, startling Steve. “Sorry, sorry. That’s just a lot of faith in me, buddy. We’ve known each other for three or so hours? A lot of people don’t trust me, and I don’t trust them as well.”
looming at the corner. The world really has changed in seventy years, and he didn’t think he could catch up at this rate.
He smothered his face with his hand. “Wow, um, no offense, but your lap is like, the best pillow ever.” He then turned to stand up and headed to the exit. “Well, lest we get to stay here and be discovered as some kind of thieves in this building, we got to go. Come on!”
“Does, ‘wait’ suffice in this conversation?” Steve offered, and then he was blushing again when he felt Tony’s hand slip down from his back, to his bum. “Tony.”
Steve tentatively placed his hand on Tony’s head, and then when the man didn’t wake up, relaxed. He carded his hand through his soft locks, and his heart constricted, because he
Steve looked around, the red dissipating slowly. His accent, however, wasn’t fading yet. “So, what’s our next destination?”
“I don’t know what you’re implying, but now, who’s condescending?” Steve asked, but shrugged. “I… spaced out? I think. Also, aren’t you going to pay for that?”
“Oh you haven’t done it before?” The tone had something vaguely curious but something other than that as well.
Tony went quiet after that, eyes looking shuttered, lost. Steve’s heart broke a little, because that wasn’t supposed to be a jab. “Hey, hey. That’s not what I meant. I just thought that after everything, we won’t be able to meet again. You’ve got your life as a billionaire green-technology chocolate connoisseur—“
“It’s a beautiful thing.” Steve admitted, itching for a pen and paper now as well. “It keeps you alive. I have to.”
“I don’t know, Tony.” Something about Steve’s voice indicated that there was something deeper to that statement, but Tony knew he wasn’t going to share.
“So yes Steve, you’re not supposed to say sorry when it’s the other’s fault; I clearly did it very forward and you were uncomfortable, so I’m going to apologize for that. We should lay groundwork about this because I don’t know what boundaries are sometimes. So—“
He actually got into a mini-argument with Steve earlier, but it was about something really inane like,
Steve couldn’t help another smile tug on his lips. (He’s been doing that a lot this night, and it’s only been an hour or two in. How was this possible?) “I totally did not.”
Tony was starting to believe in the concept of fate, somehow, because he started this day so bad that he actually threw a bottle at no one in anger, and now he was ordering coffee with someone he didn’t even know.
It felt like the water on the pier were reaching out to greet them, and people were filtering in, to start the day.
“Billionaire, excuse me.” Tony flippantly corrected. “There’s three more digits that you have to add to that, and a whole lot of decimals. I work hard for that, you know.”
He’s trying to search for a good shop (because while he is trying to be quiet, he’s not going to drink
“Me too, sweetheart,” he reached for Steve’s neck and brought him down to a kiss. This felt even more electrified, and Steve was sliding his hand on his waist, and
He held his hand out, but Tony shook his head and propped himself up. “Yeah. Damn, you a tank or something?”
“Hey, you just saw me eat ten Ferreros and now you call me a Connoisseur?” He harrumphed. “I mean, I do have impeccable taste with sweets, but how dare you for doing so.”
When Tony came back from medical, he went straight to the lab. He knew the rest of the team was trying to apologize, but he didn't want to hear any of it. Feelings made gave him headaches, and headaches made him annoyed.
"Please... please keep an eye on him. I know Tony can be annoying sometimes but he means well. And, if you let him be alone for too long... he gets very self-destructive," Helen told them.
, which made Steve love the future. He hadn’t realized it yet, but he hasn’t had a thought about the past since this morning. It was a vast improvement for him, who had spent wallowing in SHIELD far more than he would like.
“You really should keep your voice down,” Steve reminded, looking around worriedly, but Tony was on a roll, and that didn’t really stop till he stopped.
If the AI could give a physical manifestation of a nod, then it would’ve. “Yes,” JARVIS acquiesced. His AI was good like that, always understanding, unlike other people in his life. “I will take note of that, Sir.”
(If he brought him to Stark Tower, then he could escape to his laboratory, like he does to all one-night stands he does.
His eyes raked over the clocks of the station; it read 6:34 pm, and he hummed silently to himself. That was a feat; almost half a day was done already and no one was really catching his eye.
“I thought I could go back,” he confessed. “—because I hate… no, I don’t. I just don’t… know where to stand anymore.”
“I—“, he caught the man’s arm as he tried to pull away. “Okay, I acknowledge that I didn’t greet your first, and I want to say I’m sorry. But—is that why are you angry? I’m sorry.”
Peggy Carter. Brunette, red lipstick, sharp mind, heels that could probably pin him like a gun, and was always quick-witted. She was a fantastic woman, and a greater person to know; she was unafraid, even held a gun against him. Steve loved her, he really did, even if his teammates—the Howling Commandos—would give him dirt whenever he sighed over her compass picture.
“Hey now not all of them are bad,” Steve reprimanded, before laughing. “Okay, but my dad was. Not great, so fine, I won’t contest that.” He sat on the bench for a short rest, and Tony mimicked him, sitting beside him, but not too close. “I joined the army, one day.”
He groaned, bringing up his hands to rub his eyes with his palms. He squinted to the side to see the time, noting that it had just turned five in the morning, and the sun, hasn’t come out yet.
He wanted to put out his phone, but it was the prototype of the latest Stark Phone, and a lot of people knew what the Stark Phone looked like. It would be a dead giveaway.
He knew he was joking, and it was inappropriate. But sometimes, things get too serious, and he was just trying to break the somber mood. He just wanted to see Steve smile.
His eyes widened, and he was struck by a very vivid memory of a woman with a phone, directed at him. His eyes widened, recognizing her from before.
Tony looked at him and gave a wobbly smile. “Give me one kiss, soldier, and a smile. A remembrance of the greatest day of my life, Steve.”
Tony capped his bottle and held it by its neck, and stashed his chocolates in the paper bag. Resolutely, he stood up, ignoring some people, and walked towards the blue-eyed stranger.
Steve’s heart stopped, not expecting that he’d be addressed like that. Bruce looked at Tony, surprised at the wording, while Natasha was standing, and already leading Bruce to the side. On the corner of his eyes, he saw Natasha salute him, and Bruce do a confused thumbs-up and a ‘
His hands shook, and his ankle swelled, and the bruise on his knee throbbed. His arms were wrapped around his body, and all he could do was smell the food, but he couldn't eat because he was too fat. His head hurt, and his leg bounced, and his breath was slightly labored.
"I'm not going to fight you!" Steve stepped back, but Tony swung at him, punching him in the stomach. Steve fell on the floor but didn't move.
"Yeah then I think you go left." Nat sipped her beer then started to listen to the newest story being told.
"I'm sorry... Sir." Realizing that Steve was now expected to do anything Dan wanted, he slumped against the wall and hung his head.
"Tony I don't want to fight." Steve grabbed a heavy book to defend himself. "Come'on Tony. Are we really going to do this?"
"I am unable to conduct a conclusive scan, however many contusions, a possible patella fracture, possible mandible fracture, and a likely concussion. I advise medical attention right away to assess and treat any injuries."
"No. I don't want this." Steve wiggled away, but Tony grabbed Steve's ankle, and twisted hard. Steve let out a quiet moan from pain. Tony took the moment to pull Steve back, and wrapped his arm around his throat, cutting off his air. He pulled Steve's boxers down enough to get all the assess he needed, and forced his way into Steve.
"Well, you'd go back and change, and I'll be waiting on his floor for you. Peter will be on your floor getting the rest of your stuff." Nat stood back up and backed away.
"That's it. Yo'u're doing good baby." Steve stood up completely. He wavered a bit. "Let's get to the elevator." The first step pulled a long whimper from Steve. He limped forward cautiously until Tony took him over his shoulders to help him walk.
"I know. I'm sorry." Steve kept his head low, waiting to get pushed or hit again, but all that followed was silence.
"What do I have to choke down tonight-" Bucky looked up to grab a plate and finally noticed Steve. "Steve! You made it!" They hugged quickly, then Bucky stepped back and sighed. "You look like hell."
"So, we're going to lower the table. Lay on your back, and I'm going to drape a heavy material over you. We'll do your knee first and then you'll have to move for your jaw. So can you stand?" A loud buzz filled the room, and Steve flinched. He slowly pushed off the chair, ignoring the hand offered to him. When the buzzing stopped, he shuffled to the table, trying to hid his backside.
"Tony? I can't see in one eye. What did you do?" Steve tried to pull away, but his body protested and sent shock waves of pain through his body. Steve moaned in pain.
Tony turned, laying flat on his back. He gently guided Steve's head to his chest, and Steve curled up to the warmth.
Feiday turned on the TV then the movies as Tony and Steve settles into the couch. As the movie started to play, Tony got a good look at Steve. His eye was black and swelled shut, he had a large bruise coving his left cheek, slight finger print bruises around his neck, and his wrists were red and raw.
"What's wrong baby? Does the 100 year old virgin want to stay that way forever?" Tony gently rocked his hips forward.
"Ready to make Daddy happy?" At this remark, Steve's breath quickened. "Stevie, I asked you a question." He said grabbing Steve's jaw in a crushing grip.
When Steve was done, you couldn't even notice the bruises. He went up to the lounging area and sat down with his new smart phone.
"Shut up about Howard! You don't know him or what happened between us. You knew Howard before he had me. So back the hell off! You are the reason he hates me! It's your fault that i was never good enough, and now look at you." Tony laughed at Steve who was holding pressure on the wound on his head spilling blood. "You're worthless and pathetic. I didn't even put my armor on and you're down."
"We had a big meeting earlier kid. Your poor dad got sick and still went. He finally is taking a nap."
"To get breakfast. How about I make us some eggs?" The grip on Steve's arm got tighter. "Tony, that hurts."
"Okay." Peter paused. "Dad, did you get a chance to talk to Pepper? I know your busy, but I'd really like to talk to her."
"Sorry." Steve mumbled as he crashed his knees to the ground. Steve refused to look up when he heard the sound of a belt being undone.
"Good boy." Dan grabbed the back of Steve's head using his hair, and pulled his head back exposing his neck. As Dan started sucking spots on his neck, Steve focused on Tony leaving the room out of the corner of his eye.
Steve's back hit the elevator. "Tony... You- You don't mean that. Tony I'm sorry. Please. I love you so much and I'm sorry. I just love when we do stuff together and you only want one thing when you're drunk. "
"Yeah but seriously, he didn't sleep all night and now he finally fell asleep." Tony tried to block Nat's way, but she wasn't paying attention to him. She walked up to the door and grabbed the handle. Tony tried to stop her one last time.
Steve set the bread down on the counter, and cut a few pieces, placing them on a rectangular plate and set them outside as well as putting the champagne in the ice bucket. He looked at the table and smiled. He really hoped Tony would like it.
Steve barley felt Tony behind him, until his hand was in his hair. Steve shivered at the feeling, but was cut short by Tony gripping his hair and slamming his head into the door. Steve knew that he was going to do it again, but Steve didn't fight back. After the third hit, Steve let himself sink to the ground. He fell back on Tony, who tripped and fell on the ground.
Steve ran through the people in the train station. His bag swung at his side, and he turned to apologize to people if he hit them. Yet, Steve kept running out of the station as fast as he could. Steve ran out to the exit of the station, and walked down the street. A black SUV was parked about a block down and Steve sprinted toward it. As he approached, the door opened, and Steve immediately got in.
"I-I'm sorry." Steve moved forward a bit. Dan tried again, and Steve recoiled. "I'm sorry!" Steve could feel tears falling down his cheeks.
"Nurses usually take the patients to the imaging, then bring them back when the technician is done."
"Why not? Dad you're not safe. Nat and I figured it out. Sam and Bucky will visit often. And Pepper said-"
"Kathy. And let me know if there's anything else I can do to help." She smiled and nodded, letting the elevator doors close between them.
"If you don't want to, that's fine. I'm not sure if this deal will work though." Dan stood up and collected his stuff.
"No, this is where I go to meet with my therapist." Tony put his phone in his pocket and kissed Steve quickly. "But they'll drive you to the tower and you can hangout until I'm done. I'll see you later." Tony opened the door but paused before stepping out. "There's this great Italian restaurant about a block away. The driver can bring you or they deliver."
When he was done changing, Steve walked to the bathroom and searched through all of the drawers and cabinets looking for something to cover the bruise on his cheek and the forming bruises on his neck. Unlucky for him, he found nothing.
"You can breath now baby." Tony played with Steve's hair gently. "You can breath." He whispered over and over.
"Get away from me." Tony stood up quickly, circling around Steve, who was curled in pain. Tony grabbed Steve's leg and pulled. When they stopped, Steve had no time to react before Tony's foot had made contact with his knee at the exact right angle, pushing his knee cap out of place.
Today was supposed to be different. Tony wanted to review the tech on Bucky's arm and Steve just missed his best friend. Steve also hoped that Tony being productive would help distract him from drinking.
Steve winced as the blood moved swiftly down his face, trailing down his neck and soaked into his shirt.
"He'll text if it's important." Tony then threw the phone across the room, effectively shattering it. Steve just sat completely still. Tony sighed. "Fuck Steve. I fucking need you." Tony bucked his hips slightly.
Tony pressed a button on the small device causing Steve to fall back, partially paralyzed. Tony straddled Steve, laughing.
He got on the elevator to Tony's floor, and went quietly to the bedroom. He stripped the sheets of the bed, put them in a basket, and went to his own floor. Tony had put a laundry room on his floor when he had originally designed the floors for each team member. Tony knew Steve wouldn't want people doing his laundry, and the machine in the basement was too public.
Last chapter for this story. I’m writing the second part, however I am swiftly losing motivation. Thanks for the support!!!
"Ok." Dr. Sackler looked in a file and sighed quietly. "There was also evidence of sexual trauma." Steve furrowed his eyebrows like he was confused. "It was pretty healed but there was some bruises and bite marks. Also rectal tearing that was still healing."
"Move." Natasha stood firm, and Tony backed off. She handed Steve his inhaler. As Steve breathed in the medicine, she pet his back. Steve did his inhaler again, then walked into the bathroom, ignoring Nat and Tony.
I hope everyone is doing well, if you need a friend, you can message me on fanfiction.net with the same username. Feel free to message me!!
"We need to talk right now." Tony heard Steve's sigh as he stood up from the table and threw out the rest of his food. "Now!"
When the door opened, Steve was barely aware of where he was. He slowly dragged himself through the doors, trying to focus on where he was.
"Natasha. You can't go in there." Tony grabbed Nat's harm and held on. "I can't let you go in there."
"Steve, put your hands behind your back." When he did, Dan looped the belt around Steve's hands and tightened it. "Good boy." Dan stepped back to admire Steve quickly, before he undid his pants, and took out his cock.
"Look Steve. I'm sorry. For the other day. And this morning." Tony stood up in front of Steve. "I just get so frustrated. With the company and the Avengers. And then I learned about Peter. I just-" Tony took Steve's hand. "I got scared. And jealous. And it hurt. Not only do I have a son, but nobody told me. And Pepper trusted you? More than me? So you got to grow up with my son, my blood, and I didn't even know he existed." Tears swelled in Tony's eyes, and drops ran down Steve's face. "I just saw red. And I took it out on you. I shouldn't have done that. I'm so so sorry Steve. And if you want to leave me when you're healthy, I won't stop you." Tony lifted Steve's face, and gently kissed the streams of tears that had fallen. "But I love you, and I'll do better. I promise. I'll go to therapy. For real this time. And I'll get better so you and Peter can live here. We could be a happy family, and Peter can be with who he belongs with. Me."
IM SO SORRY THIS TOOK SO LONG!! I have this rlly bad habit of starting something and not finishing it but, I don't want to continue doing that! I was on writer's block for a while but I'm back! I'll try and finish this so expect more updates from now on! So sorry but hope you enjoyed! And should I continue this? I feel like it's getting a little boring?
Helen sighed. "Tony didn't want me to tell anyone but... about a few months ago, he fainted from cutting himself and he was taken to medical. I was horrified when I found him, and I had to treat his cuts. When I asked him why he did it he told me it was because he wanted to feel something, and that he thought he was worthless. I obviously told him that none of that was true but he just shook his head and begged me not to tell anyone. I've kept it a secret until now. I was sure that he stopped, because he'd never been taken to medical for cuts like that again but... I guess I was wrong."
He groaned. Yet another problem he needed to fix. But nothing a little diet and exercise couldn't do. And as he finally closed his eyes, letting sleep take over, a small part of him realized that he hadn't locked the doors the lab, and that anyone could come in at any time if they wanted to. But what did it matter, anyway? He was too tired to care.
Tony shuddered, and grabbed Steve's hand. Steve tightened his grip and whispered, "We'll help you, Tony. I'll help you. But you need to accept our help."
Steve thought he made some progress. He thought that he made Tony see that he wasn't worthless, or any of that crap he thought he was. Tony was amazing, and it made Steve very sad to know that Tony didn't
Tony himself knew that he hadn't disobeyed orders just to be annoying. While Loki was busy annoying the rest of the team, he spotted a child no older than 5 walking alone on the sidewalk. But, that's not what made his heart stop. Behind the child about three feet away was a very angry man with a gun in his hand, pointing at the child head. Tony immediately went into action.
Tony ignored him, and crossed his arms across his chest defensively. "Okay well, I'm here! What do you want!"
Tony gave a salute and flew back to the sidewalk, trying to spot the villain. He was no where to be found. Jarvis was frantically yelling at Tony to turn his coms on and when Tony did, all hell broke loose.
Tony bit his lip and sighed, staying put. Was Steve sleep talking or was he really awake? Despite this, Tony stayed close. He wanted to savor this for as long as it lasted, even if it wasn't real...
I'm sorry this took so long... I was on writer's block and really had no motivation to write. I'm gonna end this at about chapter ten, so this fic is coming to a close. Once again, sorry for my inactivity and hope you enjoyed!
JARVIS allowed them access immediately and it was sad that Steve already knew where to go. He ran towards the bathroom and almost cried at the sight. He heard Bruce gasp behind him.
Tony's was shivering, and his breaths were coming out ragged. Steve knew he was about to have a panic attack. Luckily at this moment, the others had come in and were all in a state of shock when they saw the situation. Tony's sleeves were still rolled up, so the damage was visible and his sharp breaths showed that he needed help right away.
Steve shook his head. "Tony... I don't even deserve to be talking to you right now. God, why are you still talking to me? You have every right to be angry at me right now. I was wrong. We were all wrong about you. You deserve better..."
Tony resisted the urge to glare at her and instead gave her a tight smile. "Yeah, yeah, just waiting for everyone to grab one."
The team nodded, and went to find places in the room to sit down. Steve sad down on the bed, feeling as it dipped with his weight. He stared sadly at Tony. We wont leave you alone again, he thought, determined to help Tony get better. Because Tony deserved it. And Steve needed to show him that.
Helen nodded sadly. Thor tilted his head in confusion. "And not for attention? He did it because he thought he was... worthless?"
Tony finally noticed that the rest of the Avengers, minus Bruce, were in the room. He felt himself to begin to panic. He had relapsed and Steve had been the one to find him. Now, he would be kicked off the team for sure. To his mortification, he felt his eyes begin to water. He whispered, "I'm sorry..."
Everyone looked at each other, uncomfortably. They weren't really friends with Tony. In fact, they avoided the man at all costs. But now, they felt horribly guilty about doing so. So they all nodded.
He tried to stand up, but his arms were unable to support his weight, and he fell back down. Was he getting fatter?
The team did not want Tony working in the lab alone. Even though Tony persisted, they insisted on watching a movie.
Steve wanted to cry. Tony had cut himself. But why? Suddenly, he remembered who he was thinking about. Tony, the aggressive, self centered playboy. It had obviously been for attention. At least, that's all Steve could see as the most rational reason.
Ha, Tony thought. As if Steve was surprised. "How did you know I was coming?" Tony asked, angry at them.
This was punishment, he decided. Punishment for letting Clint get hurt, punishment for disobeying, and punishment for existing at all. He pressed the knife into his leg multiple times, until the blood dripped onto the floor, causing the puddle that formed to get bigger. He began to feel himself get dizzy and he dropped the knife, the smell of copper becoming strong.
Steve frowned in confusion. Why was the smell so strong? And why hadn't Jarvis alerted them that something was going on in Tony's lab? Suddenly, Steve felt himself grow worried. "Tony!" He shouted.
He helped Clint out of the Quinjet and then he told Natasha, " Take Clint to medical, I'm gonna go find Tony."
kitchen, and was surprised to see the whole team waiting there, as if they had expected him. When he walked in, they looked up.
Nobody disagreed. Tomorrow, when Tony was well-rested, they would show him just how much he meant to them.
Everyone watched nervously as Tony blinked a few times. "W-where am I?" The billionaire asked hoarsely.
Bruce's eyes widened and he followed Steve to the lab. Once they got there, they noticed that the windows were not able to be seen through. This only made them more anxious and they started shouting, "JARVIS, let us in!"
Everyone stood, shocked at what Bruce had just revealed. But, Tony was the most surprised. Bruce cared about him? Tony self-consciously tugged on the long sleeves of his black shirt, feeling nervous. He didn't know what to say. And it scared him.
"Like I said, Tony is very insecure about his body. He thinks he's fat or something, which obviously isn't true, but he doesn't seem to see that," Helen mumbled.
Tony ignored Clint and focused on Steve. "Steve, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry I'm so fucking stupid. I know you're gonna kick me off the team for this but... please. This is all I have. You're all I have. Pepper's annoyed with me and Rhodey's been away at the army for months now. I know you guys hate me too, and I'm sorry I'm so worthless but please... at least let me stay at the tower. It's all I have," Tony said, close to crying.
Tony flicked on the light, and his eye caught the razor that was on the sink. He grabbed it and slid up his sleeve, slowly, already feeling relieved. What he didn't know was that JARVIS was taking drastic measures, and alerting the others of what was about to happen.
Nobody bothered to reprimand him, they were all tired after seeing Tony's state. Clint shook his head. "Why... why were we so mean to him?"
Tony stood up from the toilet, his hands shaking so much that he dropped the toothbrush. He gagged at the taste of vomit, but felt oddly satisfied. Finally, he was making some progress. He ignored the empty feeling in his stomach, flushed the toilet, washed his hands, and walked out of the bathroom. A worried Jarvis immediately greeted him. "Sir, your vitals are concerning. Perhaps a snack would do you some good."
Steve's expression became menacing and he shouted, "You only care about yourself! Now, thanks to you, a team mate is injured, but I'm sure that doesn't even matter to you!"
Everyone looked horrified. Steve shouted, "No Tony! No we don't want anything from you! We're doing this because we care!"
Steve was shouting and asking him why he left, Clint was moaning in pain, Natasha was whispering obscenities, Thor was desperately trying to comfort Clint, and Bruce was nowhere to be seen, or rather, heard. Tony quickly flew back to the Avengers where he noticed Loki was gone. Steve ran up to him, fury on his face. Tony lowered himself to the ground and pushed up his face plate, just when Steve had caught up to him. "Where the hell did you go? If you had been there, Clint wouldn't be injured right now! Loki put something on his leg and you weren't there to stop him!" Steve growled out.
Tony wasn't sure whether he felt flattered or overwhelmed. But, he agreed to watch the movie with them. Steve gave him a gentle smile and Tony couldn't keep the blush off his face. He masked it by looking down.
The Avengers stared at her in shock. Even Natasha looked surprised. "H-he... he's done this before?" Steve asked quietly.
that he was amazing. He always thought Tony was arrogant and stuck-up always making it seem like he was the best.
Natasha only shook her head, and muttered something to herself in Russian. Tony glanced at Bruce, who had been silent the whole time. He definitely missed his science bro, but he was afraid of confronting him, sure that Bruce thought of him differently now. In fact, that's how he felt about the whole team. Sure, it was annoying that they never seemed to care if he was dead or alive, but he never wanted them to get to see past his masks. He didn't want them to know so much about him. Now, they knew just how much of a fuck-up he was. Steve, seeming to hear his self-deprecating thoughts, told him softly, "Tony we're so sorry. We really misjudged you."
Natasha was looking at the bandages around his arms. "When was the last time they were changed?" she asked softly.
Steve nodded and then gasped. "Wait, why are we just standing here? We need to take him to medical!"
Steve had fallen asleep next to Tony on the bed, while the rest of the team laid on the floor and Steve's couch. Tony was the first to wake up, rubbing his eyes, and glaring at the light. Then it all came back to him.
Thor also stood up. "Brother, we aren't trying to deceive you in anyway. We are worried about your well-being."
As the team settled on the couch, Tony noticed that they all sat very close to him. Not that he minded. Steve was sitting the closest to him, with his arm brushing against Tony's at every move. Tony carefully didn't come any closer to him and kept his face on this TV as the movie started.
Steve was furious as he watched Tony run away like the coward he is. He had caused Clint to get hurt, and Steve would never forgive him. He didn't even bother to tell the truth about where he went. (Steve suspected it was to grab some donuts or something, the man always ate at the craziest times.)
He made sure to lock the doors and restrict anyone access from coming in. After all, he'd made that mistake before and look what had happened. Now Steve and the team gave him sad looks and he knew they felt pity. But, he didn't want pity from anyone, especially not the people that caused him to cut in the first place.
Steve felt his patience growing thin as he pleaded for access to Tony's lab. "Jarvis please! I need to see him!"
This one took a while. Sorry about that, I didn't know what to write about, but once I started it just came to me. Sorry this chapter might be a little bad??? I rushed it. But there's also a lot happening in this chapter so.... brace yourselves and enjoy. Also, thanks so much for the support I've been getting! It makes me more motivated so thank you so much, you're all so kind!
"Tony, our behavior was wrong. You aren't at fault so please don't blame yourself," Steve whispered. "I understand if you can't forgive us.
Again, no response. Then, Steve noticed that the bathroom door was ajar. He groaned, and walked over, carefully avoiding stepping on the papers on the floor. As he got closer to the bathroom, the smell of copper grew stronger. He finally reached the door, and by then the smell was suffocating him. He resisted the urge to cover his nose and walked into the bathroom slowly. And his eyes caught onto Tony's hair.
Bruce, hearing the conversation, quickly butted in. "Steve, I'll come with you. I can't believe Tony's behavior today..."
The brunette stared blankly at her for a moment and then he examined his arms. They were tightly bandaged, and a little sore. "How did you find me?" He asked Helen, quietly.
All over Tony's limp arms were cuts, obviously self inflicted. And Steve quickly saw Tony's legs, in a worse condition than the brunette's arms. Steve exhaled, and his eyes caught sight of a sharp knife with dried blood on it.
When the team got to medical, Tony was quickly placed on a bed, and Helen, a fellow ally of the Avengers who had medical experience, checked his vitals. She looked worried. "He is very anxious. We may have to sedate him," Helen told the Avengers.
Tony wandered down the halls into the kitchen so he could get a snack. He was surprised to see Steve there, eating a bowl of oatmeal.
Clint, who was still holding his leg but no longer moaning in pain. shouted, "That's a load of bullshit and you know it, Stark!"
Tony didn't respond. Steve motioned to the others, and they all left Tony to sleep. As they walked out into the hallway, Clint yelled, "This is such bullshit!"
He vomited until he dry-heaved, and then he just sat there, reminiscing in what he had just done. The hunger came back, and he quickly felt weak again. He sighed, and stood up, using the wall to steady himself. He knew the team was starting to get suspicious so he quickly rinsed his mouth, sprayed a bit of cologne to wash away the vomit smell, but not enough that they would know he sprayed a new one, and then he quickly walked out.
He walked into the bathroom to see the damage, but to his surprise, there was no blood. Who cleaned it?
He stayed on the floor for a few more minutes, until he felt himself begin to stand and walk into the bathroom. He turned on the light, and looked at himself in the mirror. He felt ashamed at what he saw staring back at him. Tony had heavy bags under his eyes, his face was very pale, his eyes red and wide, and his hair disheveled and matted with sweat. He felt his hand reach out to the cabinet and pull out something sharp. He stared at what he has pulled out. A knife, new and never used was sitting in his hand, waiting to cut something. And suddenly, he got a crazy idea.
Steve quickly dropped the dish he was rinsing and heard it crack at the impact. He ignored that and ran towards the direction of the lab.
Thor wasted no time and picked Tony up gently, following Steve out of the bathroom. Back in the lab, Natasha and Clint were waiting to see what had happened. When they saw Steve come out, they walked over to him. "What happened, man? We heard you yelling, and Bruce just ran out!" Clint said worried.
Tony turned over reluctantly, eyeing Steve warily. Steve gave him a small, grateful smile. "Tony, the team and I were wrong." Tony's eyes widened in shock. Steve continued, "I know you think this is your fault but it's really ours. We didn't care enough to worry about your feelings and that was wrong. Tony, tell me the truth. Weren't you ever a little angry at how we treated you?"
Tony stopped talking, confused as to why Steve raised his voice. Steve let go of Tony and said, "Look at me."
And yeah, that was how they ended up like how they were now. Everyone was pissed at Tony and they weren't afraid to show it either. Even Bruce, who showed up later, was giving him disappointed looks. Tony didn't bother to say anything, he just got up when they reached the tower and left. He heard Steve shouting from behind him but he didn't care. He was starting to get a little anxious, and he knew that if he didn't do something about it quickly, he'd go into a full on panic attack.
Steve, taking this as an opportunity, slowly walked up to Tony. He was glad when he saw that Tony didn't move back, but was gripping his sleeves tightly. Steve exhaled and started, "Tony, I don't... I don't even know where to start. I've wronged you in so many ways. But I just want to say that I'm sorry for misunderstanding you. I thought you were just some rich playboy who would flaunt his wealth in our faces at any chance he got. But you're not. You're so much more than that. You're kind, you're caring, you're considerate, even when you don't think so. You're always thinking about the team, thinking about you can improve our gear. I used to think you would disobey and ignore my orders in missions because you were selfish, but I know now that it's because you truly care about others. You just want to save innocent lives. But Tony... you do it without caring about your own. You forget that... you're so important and that we would all-" Steve stopped, closing his eyes, and reminding himself that Tony was still alive, that Tony was still
Steve shook his head. "No Bruce, I think it would be best if you stayed with Clint. You have the most medical experience out of all of us, after all."
Now, Tony understood. He understood why people did things like this. He looked at the toilet and sighed. This was the only way he would ever lose the fat. The only way he'd ever be perfect.
Tony didn't respond. He knew Jarvis didn't care. He couldn't. He wasn't programmed to do that. Sure, Jarvis could act like he cared but he didn't really, nobody did.
Jarvis remained silent. Then he responded almost as if he cared. "Sir, at least half the world is in love with you, and the other half at least thinks you're attractive. I don't see the point in being so negative when so many people adore you."
Where did these thoughts come from? Why was he thinking this way about a teammate? About Tony? He shook his head as if to clear the thoughts away and decided not to wake Tony up. He would come back later. He gave one last glance at the sleeping billionaire before he walked out of the lab.
Jarvis, as if taking pity on Steve, was silent for a few agonizing seconds, and then said monotonously, "Speak wisely, Mr. Rogers. Sir takes everything to heart."
Steve nodded, and set off for the lab. Upon arrival, he noticed that the blinds event closed and he could see that inside had been trashed. Papers were a over the floor and empty alcohol bottles were everywhere. He growled. So Tony was drinking? He really did only care about himself.
Tony hated when he didn't know something, and it stayed in his brain until he could figure it out. He sat in the lab, staring blankly at a table, lost in his head. JARVIS was saying something but, Tony couldn't hear him. The only thing he could hear was
"I understand. I"ll do my best to show you I'm worthy of your forgiveness," Steve promised, a determind glint in his eyes.
After a tiring mission, everyone was relieved when they finally returned to the tower. Tony in particular however, because he knew that the mission had failed because of him. Loki had come to play with them, and Clint ended up injured after Tony had disobeyed orders. Or at least, that's what everyone else thought.
Steve sighed and then looked at the team again. "Then it's settled. We will all stay with Tony. He needs us, all of us."
Tony had turned to them when they walked in, and was frozen, his sleeves pulled up and a razor touching his skin, ready to impale the surface. Steve noticed that he already has some scars on his arm, showing that he had come too late. On Tony's face was a look of pure shame. His cheeks were flushed, and his eyes were wet. His shaking hands dropped the razor into the sink and Steve ran over, grabbing Tony into a hug. He whispered, "Why, Tony..."
Steve hadn't even realized he was screaming until Bruce and Thor had run in. The both of them froze at the sight of Tony on the floor. Steve quickly informed them of what had happened. "I think he wanted attention, so he cut himself."
He watched as the team continued to grab slices, and he watched Thor as he bit into what seemed like his 16th pizza. Tony stared, jealous. How could the guy eat so much yet stay so fit? Tony looked down to his own bulging stomach and the nauseousness came back, full force. He suddenly stood up, with a great urge to vomit, and managed to choke out, "I'll be right back, just gotta use the bathroom."
Everyone stared at each other. Finally, Clint told Helen, "We don't know. Steve went to the lab to find him, and he just saw Tony laying on the bathroom floor with cuts all over his arms and legs."
Jarvis stayed silent. Tony sighed and walked out of the bathroom. He strolled over to his desk and fiddled with a screwdriver. He began to think of an excuse for everything that had happened in the past few days. He didn't want the others to treat him differently. He wouldn't know how to handle it. Before he could continue pondering, Jarvis said, "Sir, Mr. Rogers is requesting access."
But, he fell for that mask, just like many others had. Steve had just been washing the dishes when he heard JARVIS say, "Captain, Sir is in great need of assistance."
In the middle of the movie, Clint grumpily exclaimed that he was hungry. Thor agreed and so Steve ordered pizza. Now normally Tony would be excited when someone mentioned pizza but, now he just felt nauseous. But the team seemed excited so he made sure to smile and laugh along with them. As time went on, Tony's nauseous only increased, and by the time the pizza arrived, he was sure he would puke on the spot. But he kept his face neutral and watched as everyone grabbed a slice. When he hadn't grabbed one himself, Natasha stared at him and then said slowly, "Aren't you going to grab one too, Tony?"
But neither Bruce not Thor responded. Instead, Bruce bolted out of the room and Steve was sure he saw some green on his neck. Thor still stood frozen in the same spot. The he looked up at Steve and muttered, "Cut himself...?"
Tony gasped, his head shooting up. He panted, trying to forgot his nightmare. He looked down to his stomach, only to see the fat bulging through his shirt. He moaned in despair and bolted into the bathroom, quickly turning on the light. He stared at his reflection in the mirror. The fat wasn't only in his stomach, but in his cheeks too. He quickly turned away from the mirror and spotted a single toothbrush lying in a cup. He grabbed it with shaking hands, remembering something he read online with Bruce.
The woman grabbed her child and stared dumbfounded at Tony, or rather, Iron Man. Then she gasped, "T-thank you so much!"
Clint closed his eyes in pain at what Tony had just said. God, he felt so guilty. He had to fix this. Natasha herself was crying silently, tears dripping down her face. Steve was clenching his arms, and staring at Tony with so much emotion. Thor was looking down at the ground, ashamed. Helen left the room, unable to hear anymore. Steve carefully put his hand on Tony's and felt guiltier when he felt Tony tense. He stared Tony in the eye and said, "Tony. You're wrong. You're so wrong. You shouldn't be sorry, I should. I should be on my knees right now, begging you for forgiveness. I was so wrong about you. Tony you're not worthless. And I'm not going to kick you off the team. You're worth so much Tony, and it makes me so sad that you can't see that."
Someone, possibly Steve, made a choked sound at what Tony had said. Bruce didn't look deterred. "Tony, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for not noticing that one of my best friends, the only person who ever really understood me, the only person that never feared me, the only person that enjoyed being around me, was in pain. I'm sorry that I didn't try and help you, and I'm sorry I ignored all the signs. I-" Bruce choked up. "I s-should've been there for you... I should've tried to understand. I should've showed my support. You always say that it's never my fault, but... this time... I think it really was."
Tony gaped. Steve had cleaned up the mess? But why? Jarvis, noticing Tony's surprise, said, "Perhaps he would like to make up for his past mistakes, Sir."
The line was sloppy and oozing blood very quickly. He was fascinated as he watched his skin open up and the blood come out of it, dripping onto the floor and causing a puddle to form. He didn't even care about that, he just wanted to do it again. And so he did. He pressed the knife into his skin and again, but deeper this time. What happens if he goes deeper? He was keen to find out, so he pressed hard, and the pain was almost unbearable. But, he quickly told himself to man up. He decided that he didn't only want to do his arm. He bent down and rolled up his jeans, looking at his bare legs.
He made sure to look as relaxed as possible as he walked back into the room. Everyone's eyes were quickly on him. "You okay?" Clint asked as he walked in.
Tony stood up from his chair, and stretched. He slowly walked into the hallway that lead to the kitchen. Unfortunately, Tony didn't realize he was going to the
He quickly ran into the lab, stripped off his suit, and collapsed to the floor, breathing heavily. Jarvis was desperately trying to communicate to him but in his haze he heard himself say, "Mute."
Steve only shook his head and in his Captain America voice said to the rest of the team, "Everyone back to the Quinjet. Clint we'll get you to medical as soon as possible."
Steve felt horrible. He had completely misunderstood Tony. He thought the man was a selfish, conceited, whore who didn't care about anyone but himself. But instead, Tony was an insecure and unhappy man only looking for praise. And what had Steve done? He told him that he only cared about himself. And worst of all, he'd forced the other Avengers to have the same mindset about Tony. "Will he be okay?" Steve asked.
"No. Well, he has a limp when he doesn't use the crutch." Tony took the gown when it would handed to Steve.
He looked up, making sure Tony wasn't still there. He sighed in deeply, before letting a few light sobs out.
"Stevie, look what I found." Tony climbed on the bed and grabbed Steve's wrist before he could protest. Tony cuffed his wrists to the bed frame and tied Steve's feet to foot board.
"Come on." Tony slid his hand down to Steve's hand, and grabbed a hold. Steve followed behind as Tony pulled him to the bedroom. "Close the door. Then strip." Tony dropped Steve's hand.
"Oh Stevie." Tony stood and grabbed Steve's hand. "Come on." Tony pulled Steve to the elevator. The elevator went up.
Steve got in the shower. It was cold. He cranked the faucet to the left, he wanted it to be as hot as possible. The water got colder. Steve forced the faucet the other way. He waited for a moment, but the water got even colder. Steve's teeth chattered as he thought about the camera, and just washed himself as quick as possible.
He didn't reply, just tried to back away from Dan. He got about four steps away before backing into Tony. Steve hesitated not wanting to get in trouble with Tony, but not wanting Dan to do anything to him. Dan took advantage of this, and gently grabbed the sides of Steve's face, pulling them towards him.
"Oh uh okay." Nat walked to Steve and pet his hair. "Hey feel better. We got a lot of work and stuff to catch up on so text me when your better."
"Sure- Ohhh." Tony snapped his hips harder and faster than before. Steve cried out, this was more pain than he had ever felt. Before he finished, Tony pulled out and put himself right in front of Steve's face.
Steve hesitated for moment, then continued. He shifted the big duffel-bag into his left hand and whipped his face with the free hand. He headed toward the elevator.
"You don't get to tell me what to do." Tony stepped forward as Steve stepped back. "When you pay the bills, and build everything, and manage not only a billion dollar company but also the Avengers, you can tell me what to do! Now get me a damn drink." Tony slammed the saw down, making Steve flinch.
Tony lightly shoved Steve onto the elevator. Then got in after him. Steve held tightly to the small handle wrapped around the wall.
"Steve. You've been home for less then a day and you're already pissing me off." Tony went to the bar and pulled out an almost empty bottle of brandy. He drank straight from the bottle.
"Captain, can I call you Steve? Steve, are you comfortable talking with Natasha here?" He nodded. "Good. So I'm confident in your bodies ability to heal due to the serum. However, I'm afraid it may take longer due to lack nourishment."
"Peter, it's not your job to look out for me." Steve grabbed Peter by the shoulders and pulled him into a hug. "I'm sorry I didn't tell you."
"What do you mean?" Steve pulled his hand back. "I don't know how I can help you more? When I try to stop you from drinking, you get violent, and when I say we should take about it, you blame me."
"Hey Dad!" Peter walked into the room excitedly. He stopped dead in his tracts and the smile on his face faded. "What happened to you?"
And he was up. Steve's heart raced and he shoot up into a sitting position. "What?" He called out in between his fast breathing.
Once everything was in the oven and the timer was set, Steve ran into the elevator, to the floor where a business dinner would be held. He searched through any compartments he could find in the larger kitchen, finally stopping when he found the cloth napkins delicately folded and neatly put away. He took two, and before heading upstairs, he took two wine glasses, as well as two champagne glasses.
"I'm not sure. I think Nat has some hookups where she can get me a place for a bit." Sam raised an eyebrow to this. "I was going to call her after this conversation because I don't want to have to bring Peter. I hate to be this person, but can he stay here for a bit?"
Tony moved his hands behind Steve's head and pulled him into a deep kiss. Steve pulled away slightly, but Tony grabbed his lip in between his teeth, biting until he could taste Steve's blood. Steve whined, but didn't try to pull away.
Steve followed, keeping a considerable distance from Tony. The elevator ride was silent. When they got out of the elevator, Tony told Steve to sit on the couch, and Tony quickly walked into their bedroom.
Clint froze. He definitely wasn't supposed to have seen that. What the hell was he going to do? Should he tell the team? Maybe he should talk to Steve. How could he have missed that? Steve did seem a little withdrawn, but he never was the most talkative. Shit. What the hell would he do now?
"Friday, is Tony almost done with his project?" Steve set down the phone slightly aggravated at how random songs started playing.
Silently, Steve obliged. He got a plate, dished out a small amount of the meal on his plate, and sat at the table with his head held low. "Sorry." Steve finally spoke. His voice was full of guilt and it wavered a bit.
