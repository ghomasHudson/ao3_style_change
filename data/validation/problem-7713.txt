Clint took in his little brother's gaping expression before slowly shaking his head and lowering his gun, tucking it away. "I can't do it, Steve."
Toni’s jaw clenched, but she didn’t deny his point. She was quiet for a moment, the two simply swaying to the upbeat classical. “It’s easier to hate him than to admit that maybe we both crossed a few lines today. Spent three years hating the guy, why should I care how he feels?”
Bruce glanced up, offering that same awkward smile as before and motioning to his hands as they cleaned the wound. “I would shake your hand, Ms. Stark, but…”
Natasha nodded, leaping to the ground silently, moving forward towards the delivery door that Hammer had told them of. The only unguarded door. “Alright.” She murmured. “Through this door is a hallway that leads to the main kitchen. There’s a vent we can access from there that can lead us to the lab.”
He cupped Toni’s cheek, eyes flicking over for any sign of damage or pain. It was the most informal Howard Stark has ever been in front of business partners and Toni could see Steve shift uncomfortably in the corner of her eye. “I’m fine, I am. We got out of there just fine.”
Tony shrugged lightly. “Everyone is. He watches over that side of the city." Tony said quietly, although his mind was flashing to the kiss they shared just the other night.
“Alright, kid. I want your wallet and anything else you have on you,” the man said, voice gruff and low.
The mugger nodded, raising his gaze to his boss. “Yes, sir.”
“You’re more than welcome to make your own breakfast,” Steve hummed, grinning and not bothering to even glance up from his paper.
Steve’s words echoed in Tony’s mind as his eyes widened. Before he even had a chance to speak, his world was engulfed by darkness and Tony was falling to the tile floor unconscious. The only sound coming from his shattering coffee cup.
Toni scoffed, unfolding the arms of the hot rod red frames and sliding them onto her face. “Sweetheart,
"Great," Tony murmured, feeling compelled to give positive feedback for the sake of his friends. “I almost have the circuit system down and should have a prototype ready by the end of the week."
Natasha sat back in her chair, studying the blonde for a moment before raising a brow. “And did you thank her yet for saving Bucky? After the fit you threw about finding him? Going as far as to accuse her father of the whole scheme?”
“Im sorry, boss,” Lou whispered, looking down. “But I’ll do better, next time. In and out and Rogers wont even know.”
The boss simply hummed, lifting his wine glass to take a slow sip before opening the file. “Anthony Edward Stark,” The boss mused. “Parents died a few years ago, one older brother- is he of any importance?”
“Excuse me?” Toni was truly dumbfounded by the response and she took one step closer. “Are you fucking insane? I understand that you’re upset about Barnes, I do. And I’m sure you’re busy trying to find him, but you should meet with my father. He was going to check on your progress. For him, that could possibly mean offering his assistance, which I’m sure you need.”
“It’s fine. The bigger worry is what will be done with Obadiah and Tiberius. What they have done is-“
“She needed something, Stevie. Anything. It’s just one tablet; we’ll find her a box of Tylenol or ibuprofen or something to switch to when we loot. For now, she just had to get over this hump of pain,” Bucky insisted, laying the girl back down and smoothing a hand over his face. “For now, this is the best we can do.”
“How are they?” Steve asked, nodding towards the stairs that led to the private wing.
Tony huffed, slowly moving up the stairs. “Good night!” He called, grumbling softly under his breath as he moved straight to his bed, flopping down onto the covers and groaning softly. As much as he loved Clint, the man was way to motherly for a brother. He pressed his face into his pillow, yawning and slowly drifting off.
“You seem to be in a much better mood. After all that worrying you did last night for Rogers and his band of fuckups,” Ty pressed his lips to the bottle for a quick sip. “I would’ve figured you’d be on your father’s case again today.”
He moved up three flights of stairs before walking to his door, sliding the key into the lock and giving it a slow turn. As soon as he pushed the door open he was met by a sneer and Clint’s fist hitting his lower jaw. The force through him to the ground, landing hard on his chest with his hands splayed out right at Steve’s feet. Looking up slowly, he found Steve’s handgun aimed for the center of his forehead. “Going somewhere?" Steve asked, nodding his head towards the bags Loki packed in the corner.
He slowly slid out of the bed, tugging open the door and trudging down the steps, following the smell of syrup to the kitchen where breakfast was in full swing. Bucky sat at the table, still shirtless as he happily dug into a plate of blueberry pancakes that were practically drowning in syrup.
“I’m restraining her. Unconscious or not, I’m not giving her the opportunity to kill us or something,” Bucky muttered under his breath, shifting the rifle in his hands. “Over there,” he pointed towards a two-story building across the street. “Looks like there’s apartments over that restaurant. We can barricade in there.”
Tony huffed and glared after Steve, crossing his arms. "What's his problem?" Tony asked, mostly rhetorical.
“Alright, enough with your “sign from above” bullshit,” Toni rasped, but she afforded him a thin smile. She squeezed his hand, before raising a brow at the cool press of metal against her fingers. “You two are married,” she said matter-of-factly.
“See, here’s the difference,” Bucky started, a spark of annoyance igniting the tension he had built up all day. “Steve and I fight because we have a difference of opinion. You two fight because you refuse to understand one another. It’s just fueled by pettiness, like two children.”
Loki gave Tony a look as he moved the rest of the dishes over for Tony to clean off. “Do you think they would need someone with drug and poison expertise during a fire fight?” He asked, sarcastically, grabbing two mugs from the cabinet. “Coffee?” he asked, grabbing the pot and filling the mugs.
"I do." Clint huffed, looking through the row of cars until he spied the large, black SUV with Hammer’s tags.  “We aren’t waiting in his car if that’s what you’re thinking. Too risky. If he’s loyal enough, he’d run us off the road and take all three of us out." Clint huffed.
"Five thousand dollars." Steve huffed as he finished counting, eyes flashing to Loki as he pulled out a box of matches, lighting one and setting fire to the money. “He’s worth millions," Steve snarled, face illuminated in the fire’s glow as he tossed the burning money into the trashcan.
“What’s wrong with you? You’ve hardly said a word all evening and- I love you, babe, you know that- but usually, I can hardly ever get you to shut up,” Ty joked, taking a slow drag of the cigarette and letting the smoke rolled out on his exhale.
“And miss the birthday of my favorite Stark?” Justin asked, adjusting just purple tie. It really was an ugly color, Toni decided.
Tony huffed, cheeks warming just barely as Steve's proud gaze fell on him. "Good to have you back," Steve grinned, settling in his seat as the car fell into a comfortable silence.
“I do,” Toni finally caved, jaw clenching in irritation. “But that was-“
Honestly, Toni didn’t really know why she was here. Perhaps she was moved by Bucky’s story of his mother. Perhaps she wanted to make an attempt at understanding him. Perhaps she was little drunk and feeling ballsy. They would find out. “I was just talking to Bucky,” she started, hesitating in the doorway before she approached and took a seat in the chair before his desk.
"I-I dont know, man. I was just having a drink with this smoking hot blonde when I guy came in and shot at the ceiling. Told everyone to get out." The guy panted nervously, glancing to he door. “Last I saw, he was heading for the corner office," The man huffed, shrugging away Bucky’s grip and taking off.
Bucky could see the connection she was trying to make for him and he huffed. “I know. I
They wouldn’t take her in just because they felt bad for her condition. So what did they want?
The town car peeled away from the curb just as rain began to splatter against its windows, leaving the museum and its fading benefit behind in favor of late night traffic. The backseat was occupied by Toni and her fiancé, the former biting down thoughtfully on her nail while the latter reclined his head back against the headrest. Ty’s eyes were shut, one hand perched on his knee tapping out an unknown rhythm while the other was stretched out behind Toni’s head. He seemed uninterested in the conversation at hand, though Toni wasn’t surprised.
Clint wasted no time as he moved to Tony, pulling his brother into his arms and holding him close, carding his fingers soothingly through his hair while Steve moved to the window, glancing out and watching a car pull onto the street and speed away. “Whoever it was, they’re gone.”
“I’m sure you did,” Steve murmured flatly. After a brief pause, his eyes found Toni’s again. She was wearing that mask of hers again, emotions so carefully guarded that Steve didn’t know if she was about to continue their screaming match from earlier or pretend nothing was wrong. Steve reached a hesitant hand out. “Ms. Stark.”
“No,” Steve muttered, pinching the bridge of his nose before motioning to the stairs. “I plan on doing it. I promise. But she wasn’t exactly in the mood today for a heart to heart with me, of all people.”
“You’re looking worse,” he responded in turn, taking her in again. Her hair is neatly braided down her back and out of her face, and she’s wearing red, silk pajama pants with a white tank top. What gives the brunette away though is the faint hint of dark circles under her eyes, betraying just how worn she truly is. “Understandably so. I’m sorry about what happened. That it happened at all.”
“You sound like you’ve been dying to ask me that all night,” came Bucky’s slow drawl, a touch of smugness to his tone that had Steve rolling his eyes. “Did you two talk?”
Tony grumbled softly and stirred, slowly sitting up and rubbing his face. “Bucky?" he mumbled sleepily, smiling slowly. “How does the arm work? Feel okay?" he asked, rubbing his eyes as he stretched slowly.
Toni shook her head jerkily, taking a step back to match his step forward. “You were
The town was a good size, and by the lack of shatter windows in the storefronts, the looting must have been at a minimum in the days following the outbreak. The rain was a steady drizzle now, and Steve had to shove his soaking blonde locks out of his eyes. “Where should we start? Looks like there’s a general store over there on the corner, and a supermarket just down the street. Maybe there will be a clothing store nearby-“
Howard chuckled, leaning his back against the bar to examine his daughter. “It doesn’t take much to do that. She’s a Stark, in that way. We’re incredibly stubborn and hardheaded.”
"Not that kind of signal, Bucky. A
Bucky threw his hands up in the air, but followed after the blonde dutifully. They stepped back out into the open street, the setting sun barely visible over the tops of the trees surrounding the small town. “When she fucks us over, don’t blame me.”
was a bold move. What would her father think when she told him that she had only met this man the night before for a brief dance? She couldn’t wait to find out, couldn’t wait to knock the man down a peg and teach him not to try and use her for his own gains like everyone seemed to think they could do- Howard continued. “You know, Antonia, I value your business advice, however much you rejected the…grittier sides of my company. Which is why I’m surprised you didn’t bring your friend to me sooner. You knew I wanted to expand in my trade, and here comes Steve like a godsend. You’re usually quicker on these leads; it’s a good thing I found him when I did.”
Clint gave Natasha a brief nod, turning to face the group. “Rhodey, you and Dugan should go through our stored weapons. Create packs for each of the groups to take. Bruce,” Clint said, turning a soft look on the doctor. “Pack all the medical supplies you’ll need.”
There, on the tiles beneath the sink, lay an abandoned iPhone. There was a splatter of red blood peppering the floor beside it, dotting its way up the nearest wall. Steve must have missed it during his first sweep of the room. That, and the bullet hole etched into the wall between two of the sink mirrors. Steve picked the phone up with shaky hands and examined the screen. His own name was printed at the top, above a running counter timing the call. Steve glanced back around the bathroom wildly. Where the hell was Bucky?
Tony woke late the next morning, groaning softly as he sat up in the large, comfortable bed. Where the Hell was he? He glanced around the room, spotting his two backpacks in the corner and huffing. That’s right, Clint forced him to live in Steve’s Estate. As if he didn’t already run into the annoying mob boss enough.
“Sounds like Steve,” Bucky admitted. “Whatever he might have did or said… He just cares about his own very strongly. He doesn’t think straight in those situations, so don’t let anything he did get to you-“
Clint shook his head. “Bruce, you gotta make sure he goes to bed before you leave him alone. Or else he’ll just stay up and work.”
“Because- and this may shock you- not everyone in this world is an asshole like you,” Bucky muttered, setting his rifle aside and crossing his arms. “Thank Steve. He has an inability to leave people behind, even when they deserve it.”
Bruce gently placed a hand on Clint’s arm. “You couldn’t have possible known that it was going to-"
“Scotch.” Toni lifted the bottle, though she paused before filling his glass. “Should you be drinking on medication?”
Steve reluctantly broke the kiss when Bucky’s teeth scraped against his lower lip to give a teasing tug. Bucky made a disappointed sound, refusing to give Steve even an inch more of space. “I’m not making out with you with a girl sleeping three feet away, Buck.”
“Not quite; she’s getting involved. You promised me you would handle her until it’s time.”
Antonia Stark’s twenty-first birthday came with a flash of gold, New York’s wealthiest gathering beneath the glittering chandeliers of Stark Mansion to celebrate the young woman. Expensive jewelry caught the light beautifully, in the same way as the cigar smoke curling towards the high ceilings. Haughty laughter and clinking glasses overshadowed the band’s soft classical, the party’s clashing melody echoing up to the top of the staircase where the young Stark stood.
Steve came into his office like a whirlwind, hair disheveled and blue eyes burning with anger. “I want him dead by morning,” he snarled, tugging his tie loose with one sharp pull.
When Toni opened her eyes, she was lying flat on a slab of stone facing the decaying face of a hunter. The creature laid only six feet away, legs buckled and snapped from the fall. It was immobilized, but that didn’t stop the thing from desperately reaching its hand out towards her, fingers scraping at the ground beneath them. It opened its mouth repeatedly, but no sound escaped except a rasping sigh.
Reality snapped into focus immediately and Toni jerked under their hands, shaking her head ferociously. “No. No, no just leave it. Leave me, its fine,” she begged.
The car sped off down the street, adrenaline coursing through her veins as she glanced back towards Obadiah’s townhouse. They did it, they really got away. There were going to be repercussions, but for now they were safe and Toni was thankful for it. Up until a blue Mercedes turned onto the road ahead of them and Toni felt her heart stop. Obadiah’s car. The Mercedes pulled past them and as Toni turned her head to look out the window, she found Obadiah turning to meet her gaze. Their eyes met and everything seemed to go in slow motion. His brow furrowed in confusion, before his eyes darted towards the backseat. Whatever his reaction was, Toni didn’t get to see it because she pressed the gas pedal to the floor and took off.
The blonde made an annoyed sound, blue eyes glaring down the woman as she moved to stand before him. “You’re really going to rob an innocent guy who did nothing to you? Who you don’t even know?”
“You need to have some form of sustenance. Other than coffee or booze.” Natasha’s hand darted out, taking up his empty liquor glass perched on the corner of the desk. “You spent all night searching; you’ll be no help to Barnes if you keep denying yourself food and rest.” She set the glass on the bar. “You’re running on fumes.”
,” Toni assured, turning back and taking Ty’s hand as he joined her. “Have a good day.”
The arm was almost a complete size match to Bucky's live one, if not a little bigger. He laid it down beside Bucky and slowly attached it, making sure it was on and completely attached before stepping back. "Wow," he mumbled, slowly taking a seat.
“What?” Steve snorted, turning to glare at Tony. “Why the Hell would I be jealous?”
Bucky huffed softly. “When this is all over, I expect to put my foot in his ass."
“You’re serious?” Ty asked, lifting himself from the couch. “We came all this way-“
“Tony,” Tony introduced himself, sticking out a hand to Bruce, lopsided smile in place. “Clint’s little brother.”
Loki opened his mouth again but quickly shut it, thinking better of what he was going to spit out. “It’s your fault he’s in this, Captain. If you hadn’t told that mugger Tony was under your protection, the boss never would have taken interest in the brat."
“You’re not wrong, but I was still tricked. Still lied to, and I hate being lied to,” Toni muttered, coming to a stop at another light. “But it’s not just Ty. Obadiah is family; he’s my godfather. He’s always been in my life, helping dad and me out after mom died. I can’t believe he would… that my father would allow this.”
And he couldn’t even muster a simple ‘thank you.’
Bruce scoffed, giving Clint a look. “He’s your brother. I'm not babysitting him. I think he’s smart enough to know when to bed.”
“This, sir, is the file on Tony Stark. Everything from dental records to second grade test scores.” Justin presented, smiling proudly and waiting for praise.
Steve pinched the bridge of his nose. “I’m not… Fuck, Buck. I’m not doubting your ability, but they got you once-“
Tony hummed in acknowledgement, biting his lip. “Well my A.I. isn’t finished yet, I still have to create a speech function and other little things. But right now, if I work it write, I can open the program on my laptop in the lab and get in contact with whoever is notices it."
“I know.” Natasha’s lips were quirked a fraction of an inch. “You’re the one that gives Steve a heart attack every time you visit.”
“You know what you’re doing?” Toni rasped, staring down the man with watery eyes.
"Hey, you two, cut the chatter and work," Donovan snarled from his post, crossing his arms.
“Maybe I will,” Toni huffed, glancing over as Bucky stepped out of the aisle beside her, a board game in hand. “Is that…Monopoly? Where the hell did you find that?”
Tony looked to him warily before sitting slowly, finding a plate of pancakes and aspirin set before him. He eagerly took the aspirin before taking a slow bite from the pancakes, watching as the boss handed Loki a stack of crisp money. “There you go, Loki. Five grand." The boss hummed as if it were nothing. “You’re services were greatly appreciated and I’ll be sure to keep you in mind if I ever need your expertise again."
The first blonde gave him a look. “Lower your voice, Thor. We dont want to wake the whole block. Get the guy into the alley,” he huffed, moving into the shadows of the alleyway.
job? He was about to move back towards the house when a dark SUV pulled up to the sidewalk besides Clint’s group, the dark paint glinting in the streetlamp. The back door opened and a tall muscular blonde stepped out, looking over to the group with a brief nod of his head. He was followed be another tall man with longer blonde hair and a booming voice. “We have the traitor,” he called to Clint, dragging a man from the car who bound with thick rope.
. If we’re going to do this, you need to focus. How many upstairs?”
“And so you thought that justified you lying about or relationship? To drag me down with you even though the only thing I know about you is that you’re a fraud?” Toni hissed, standing sharply from her seat and planting her hands on the table.
As soon as Steve and the boys arrived at the club, they found Natasha and Phil crouching behind two overturned tables. “Clint, get up high: I want your eyes on the whole scene. Bucky, take your rifle and follow him: I want you picking those bastards off. Thor, you and I are going to get Bruce over to Phil. Everyone got it?"
With a curt nod, Natasha was off, taking down the nearest guard and setting to work as the man's pained cry filled the hallway.
“Slept in the lab,” Tony mumbled as he stood, sipping from the bottle and shrugging with a wince. “Not the best to sleep bent over a lab table,” he said.
“In the coffee I got for you after you ate your sandwich. It was decaf and laced,” Natasha waved her hand, moving across the suite to the master bathroom. “But now you have twelve hours of sleep under your belt and you’re ready to make a fresh start at finding Barnes.”
Steve was moving without a second thought, phone still clutched tightly in one hand as he crossed the dance floor. There was a crowd of remaining guests blocking the bottom of the staircase as they all traded goodbyes and fake sentiments; Steve was less than gentle as he shoved through them. They slowed him down, but the moment Steve reached the staircase, he was sprinting up the steps two at a time. Second floor bathroom, second floor bathroom. Steve wove through the tables that crowded the balcony, colorful exhibit displays flashing in his peripherals as he followed along the walls in search of the bathroom. He finally spotted a door labeled restroom and shoved the door open hard enough that it creaked and smacked against the wall. The sound echoed through the empty bathroom, Steve’s panic only rising when he realized no one there. “Bucky, come on, pal,” Steve said into his phone, shoving a hand through his hair. “I swear, if this is a joke, I’m cutting your pay and-“
Toni rolled her eyes, moving to grab the gun from the corner before she took Bucky’s arm and began for the stairs. “Hurry, in case he wakes up. I don’t think we could deal with him again.”
Bruce huffed softly and gave Phil a look. “You’re lucky this isn’t near any major arteries, Phil."
"Are you ever going to tell me who these sources are?" Steve huffed, sparing a look to Clint before continuing to survey the crowd.
Steve’s fist clenched as he turned to Bruce. “Pull up the security tapes from after we left." His voice was dark and commanding, one of the true signs that he was pissed and a little bit afraid.
Tony nodded slowly. “Thanks, Bucky," he said before shifting nervously. “Uh…how is Steve?" Tony asked, because in all honestly, he missed him.
“Touché.”
Steve nodded in agreement, stepping forward and placing a hand on Tony’s shoulder. “I know how much you care about him, Clint. I promise, I’ll take good care of him and if I ever hurt him, I personally give you permission to kick my ass to the moon and back.”
"I already told you about the invasion, I wont sell out my-
“Two martinis, John.”
“About a mile out from the next town,” Bucky explained, capping the water and tucking it back into his bag. “We’re hoping to stock up on supplies and find you some pain meds. How’s the arm?”
“You know, “Steve murmured, tapping a finger on the table. “Your chances of survival are much higher if you’re with a group. But there’s no chance of anyone traveling with you if they’re worried you’ll screw them over.”
“Natasha Romanov,” the woman introduced without hesitation, passing forward the teacup to Toni. “I’m one of Steve’s…enforcers.”
That seemed to settle Toni’s nerves marginally. Rogers was a dick and Bucky was his cheeky accomplice; she shouldn’t care what happened to either of them. In fact, having them self-imploding would make her life much easier. It would finally be pay back for Steve treating her the way he did when they met. And despite the satisfaction that would bring her, Toni refused to justify a man being taken and harmed just to give someone a favorable edge in a deal or territory. Business could be done without being built on the blood of others.
"We're nearly there. The next grate is should be directly over the lab," Natasha hissed to Clint as she slowly maneuvered along the tight metal passageway.
"Sir, we have an issue."
Toni didn’t respond, already leading Rhodey up the stairs. Steve watched them go until he heard the guestroom door close, before sighing and turning back for the kitchen. Toni’s silence was much more disturbing than any argument she could have given, and perhaps Rhodey’s presence really was needed.
Steve’s jaw clenched, but he couldn’t exactly argue with that. His sole reason for avoiding this meeting was because he didn’t want to deal with Stark’s daughter. Antonia Stark was a stubborn, harsh woman, and Steve’s interactions with her could only be described as toxic. He was only willing to argue and trade insults for so long before he snapped. As for her fiancé, Tiberius Stone, the man’s family was known for their hidden agendas. Steve has a thing against people who aren’t upfront and honest in their deals. Moreover, this meeting wasn’t a business-related affair; it was purely a cosmetic meet-and-greet where Steve wasn’t allowed to discuss strategy or operations. Toni had been all too keen to reject that mantle. “I don’t see why I should waste my time with Howard’s incessant need to show off all of the recent developments in his family.”
“Don’t talk about our relationship with the thief,” Bucky joked offhandedly as he returned, but his brow was furrowed as he measured two thick sticks beside her broken forearm. “These’ll have to do for a splint. Alright, kid, we don’t have any anesthetic so you’re going to have to go through this without it.”
kind of trouble.”
Justin snorted, rolling his head to face Clint. “Fuck off."
Justin groaned, coughing as blood bubbled onto his lips. “You…think I’d…sell out my boss?" he huffed, giving Steve a look.
“Why are you staring at me like that?”
Bucky exhaled audibly in relief when Toni finally moved forward. Her fingers skimmed over the chains that wrapped around a water pipe and twisted Bucky’s arms up above his head. There was a lock, which meant hopefully there was a key somewhere. She studied the small cellar, from the stairs to the racks of wine that covered a good portion of the walls. There was a small table in one corner. Draped over the top of the table was Bucky’s discarded suit jacket, a wallet, a pistol and accompanying holster, and- key. Toni raced over and grabbed the metal object, returning to Bucky’s side to unlock the chains. The man cursed as he lowered his arms slowly to his sides, one hand coming up to press over the bullet wound. “You’re a fucking angel,” he swore to her, face going pale as he mustered the strength to stand, though he was still leaning heavily on the wall. “How many of them are upstairs?”
“I couldn’t sleep,” she finally worked out, watching the blonde approach her slowly. “Sorry if I woke you.”
The brunette didn’t seem too satisfied with the answer, but she didn’t argue further and for that, Bucky was grateful. The guards at the gate waved along her car, allowing Toni to speed down the driveway and towards the front walk where Steve was already waiting for them on the porch. The car came to a stop, and Bucky only had a second to straighten himself out in the backseat before Steve was opening the door for him. The blonde was patient, carefully helping Bucky step out of the car. “Thank God you’re alive,” Steve breathed, smoothing his hands over Bucky’s shoulders.
“I do.”
“She was going to do it to you!”
“You’re not talking and that worries me. You’re normally halfway through a conversation before I even properly say hello,” Rhodey started as he closed the bedroom door, setting the bag beside the dresser. “Tones?”
“Yeah, I’d hate for this to be a burden on your conscience,” he muttered sarcastically. “But I do want you to know my name so what you’ve done here, possible sentencing a man to death by taking all of his supplies, will stay with you. It’s-“
“Now is that anyway to treat a lady, Stevie? I thought I taught you better.”
Steve huffed, grip tightening on his glass of tea as he sat down at the table, facing Tony. “You and Bruce really seemed to hit it off,” Steve commented, forcing his voice to stay nonchalant.
“Yeah, sounds like him,” Clint replied almost immediately, not bothering to even question Steve’s problem. He knew better than anyone just how Tony gets, but that also meant he knew better how to handle him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No. This is about Steve Rogers, the protégé extraordinaire. Seems he stood up his usual meeting with Howard.”
Bruce looked over the codes, shaking his head slowly. “Absolutely brilliant. I hope Steve and Clint keep you around. I could use another man of science in the group.”
Bucky nodded once. “It’s a closed fracture, which means the bone hasn’t broken skin. But the bone is definitely displaced, I can feel it. I should be able to reset it.”
“It was nothing,” Toni shook her head, waving her hand dismissively and leaning back into the couch. “I couldn’t leave him there like that.”
Bucky sighed and lifted himself up to sit on a lab table, looking down and running his fingers over his cool, metallic hand; a habit that Tony had noticed him doing a lot lately. “Tony, you have to stay calm. I’m in tough and dangerous situations all the time and freaking over it will not help."
“I’ve known him a long time; I know what to expect from him. He’ll never cheat, he’s just a flirt,” Toni commented, with a simple shrug of her shoulders. “So am I. A match made in heaven.”
Toni pressed her hand back against the ground and, after a moment of steeling herself, pushed herself up to her knees. The pain was tremendous, blood pounding in her ears as her dizzy vision focused on her surroundings. There was a stream before her, maybe only ten feet away. Its banks were steep, a quick drop off in the rough stone. What could she possibly do with that? Maybe she could… no, she could barely keep herself on her knees as it was. Toni just needed to stop and think this through, take a moment and-
“Actually, I asked you to dance so that I could wish you a happy birthday,” Steve assured, lifting her back upright and smiling widely. “How does it feel to finally be able to buy alcohol, gamble, and get into nightclubs?”
Steve frowned and touched Tony’s shoulder. “Tony, listen, it’s not unusual to be upset about-“
Comments and kudos are always cherished!
“Fine then, walk. I have the box so I get to see the pawns and I can-“ Bucky paused, sorting through the box in his lap and collecting the pieces in his hand. “Where the fuck is the car?”
Toni shrugged her shoulders. “Because I’m smart, and it’s much easier to steal supplies from people. They do all the looting for me so I don’t have to.”
“Steve, we aren’t even going to make it to the town before sundown. We need to find shelter and you need a break,” Bucky was already approaching, sliding his rifle onto his back. He wrapped one arm around Toni’s back and the other under her bottom before pulling her off of Steve. “I can handle her for the next half hour while we find a place to settle.”
Toni hummed, swallowing thickly and staring down at the food rather than meet Bucky’s inquisitive gaze. “Shockingly, I’m actually looking and feeling a lot better than I did earlier today. A friend of mine helped me see just how inconsequential Ty and Obadiah are. They’re beneath me; they aren’t worth my time and I certainly won’t spend any more of it mourning their loss.”
“No, turn it around and head for the docks. Gossip thrives there and maybe we’ll catch something,” Steve ordered with a stubborn set to his jaw. “I refuse to go home until I make sure we’ve talked to every one of our leads. I don’t care about the paperwork or the meetings, I care about my friend. And when it comes down to it, the guys working for me follow me because they know I’d have their back in any situation. I would drop everything to protect my own and that’s exactly what I’m going to do now.”
Tony shrugged, smirking back down to his computer. “I have a knack for these sort of things.”
Bucky huffed and shook his head, focusing on his pancakes with a pout but making no further argument. Tony looked over his eggs, glancing around at the large kitchen. “Don’t you have more in your little mob than these two?” Tony asked.
is what Toni's birthday dress is modeled off of! Complete with a link to one of my side tumblrs made for this very purpose!
"So take care of it," he growled through gritted teeth, eyes narrowed as he turned his head to get back to work.
He was settled on the ground, a rough cement floor grating against the bottom of his bare feet. A warehouse? A basement? His arms were stretched up over his head, and Bucky gave them an experimental tug despite the pull in his wounds. A cold, metal chain dug into the skin of his wrists, resisting the moment. A metal pipe groaned in protest. So definitely a warehouse or basement. His pounding head remembered things only in pieces: drinks with a blonde, dancing with a brunette, a giant fucking whale? Right, he was at the museum for a party. He remembered slipping into the bathroom, washing his hands, and then….then nothing. Must have been jumped. God, Steve was going to kill him.
I scared him. I know the situation was shitty and could have turned way worse real quick,” Bucky muttered. “And I know the guilt is just killing him but I… It’s stupid, but I feel guilty myself for letting myself get taken, for being Steve’s weakness.”
Steve’s brow furrowed, expression only growing more annoyed. Pressing down a button on the phone, Steve leaned in. “What four o’clock? I thought I was done for the day,” Steve asked. “Why am I just now hearing about this, Sharon?"
Steve sighed, glancing up to the ceiling in exasperation before looking over at Tony. "This is what happens when you get involved with the mob," He mumbled. "I want you to move out with Clint tomorrow. Start a fresh life somewhere far away from us."
traded verbal blows, so what’s a little preemptive strike?
“Eleven,” she hummed in response, moving to the balcony and unlatching the doors. The bird songs were even louder now, and leftover rain dripped from the leaves on the tree outside.
“Do you feel the need to stand out?”
“Ran into our new friend. Smith? Finally got him to take that deal he’s been so fickle about. He just need some…” Steve could practically hear Bucky’s grin. “Encouragement.”
Bucky nodded. “Spent the year so wrapped up in coordinating the business that we never really noticed Sarah getting sicker until it was bad. Say what you want about Steve’s dad, the man was an abusive bastard. But Sarah Rogers? That woman was the kindest sole you’d ever meet. She never wanted this life for Steve, but damn if she didn’t support and care for him every step of the way. Even running the business by himself, Steve was always that same stupid kid I knew back in high school. Hoping to help the world and turn the streets of Brooklyn around. Then his ma passed and… he was never the same. Losing his dad was nothing, but loosing Sarah? Destroyed him for a long time. It was all I could do to put the pieces back together for him, show him that he still had family.”
Steve turned to the man before him, narrowing his eyes and jerking his jaw towards the door. “Leave. I’ll send one of my men tonight to collect a fine.”
Tony glanced down, sighing in frustration as his fingers fumbled with the wires for the third time. "Great," he huffed angrily, setting down the circuit board again and rubbing his tired face. He hadn't gotten to much sleep the night before and now, he was running on nothing but coffee and sugar.
Toni made her way through the western wing of the house, following the path that had been shown to her and Ty the day before during their brief meeting with Steve. Today, however, Toni passed the library in favor of continuing on to the end of the hallway where she was sure Steve’s office was. Sure enough, Toni rounded the corner to find a small waiting area, complete with a desk and three chairs arranged between her and a closed door. The click of Toni’s heels must have announced her arrival, because the petite blonde woman at the desk was already glaring her down. “Ms. Stark. I don’t seem to remember Pepper scheduling-“
Steve turned to Clint and slowly nodded his head. “Pack your things. You’re coming to stay at the Estate with me and the others.”
"Clint, it wasn’t some hook up, alright?" Steve said calmly, his whole body going lax as if to make himself less of a threat. "I-"
Bruce raised an eyebrow, smiling. “I didn’t expect someone so young to be good enough in math to even understand the equation I was working on, let alone fix it. This is beyond college level math.”
Tony gripped at the lab table to steady himself. "Weren't planning on losing an arm? It was a grenade!" Tony snapped, paling as he examined the work done. The doctors had known what they were doing and Bucky should be fine and healthy, but that didn't mean he should lose his arm. Bucky didn't deserve that.
Steve laughed, a low, humorless rumble that had Toni raising a brow as she leaned against the doorframe. “The boxes came loose, huh?”
Bucky helped Toni sit up gingerly, bringing the tablet to her lips and grabbing the water bottle, tipping it up so that Toni could wash down the medication. Steve frowned, taking the bottle back and shoving it in their bag. “I don’t know, Buck. Morphine?”
Tony jumped as the computer screen went black and a low voice filled the room. “Now I really am disappointed with you, Anthony. I expected better."
There was a brief knock at the door, mirroring the rain tapping at the window. Steve slumped back into his chair as the door opened, a shock of red hair filling his unfocused gaze. Natasha was quiet in her approach, and Steve didn’t truly acknowledge her presence until he heard a clink of metal as the woman placed a tray before him.  The silver tray, taking up the center of his desk, was adorned with a turkey sandwich, neatly sliced from one corner to the other. A bottle of water and a few potato chips stood as the only sides.
“Happy birthday to me.”
Clint was standing in Bruce’s path of sight, keeping his eyes off of Loki. “Thanks, Bruce, but I think Steve wants a little more time. We’ll be up in about fifteen minutes," Clint said.
Steve’s blue eyes landed on her coolly, barely contained rage visible in his tense muscles and clenched jaw. He finally leaned closer, eyes narrowed on her. “Somebody grabbed Bucky. He’s
Bucky was already gingerly taking Toni’s elbow and dragging the woman off towards the dance floor, giving Steve a moment to calm himself. She was so fucking stubborn. He grabbed his lapels to straighten his suit jacket, glaring after the two for a moment longer before turning to welcome Howard and Ty’s return from the bar.
Their spat earlier had left a sour taste in the brunet’s mouth, and he didn’t entirely trust himself not to snap at Steve should he run into him again today. Arguments between the two were an anomaly, but when they did occur, they usually seemed to be caused by one or the other getting injured. And logically, Bucky knew Steve’s intentions for benching him were pure. The blonde had spent the past few days thinking Bucky was dead or very close to it, with no concrete leads or evidence to help him find a location. In reality, it was only by chance that Bucky had been rescued at all and reunited with his best friend. Bucky understood why Steve was edgy. He had been easily taken down while he was healthy and in his prime, what would happen if Bucky went back out in the field injured and less than 100 percent?
As always, comments and kudos are loved and appreciated!
Steve shoved the front door open, eyes wide and frantic as he moved quickly down the hallway to the lab. Stepping in, he found Natasha crouching beside Bruce and Phil, helping them sip up. “What the hell happened?" Steve cried, immediately moving and helping Phil stand, looking over the man.
Rhodey and Dugan gave firm nods, immediately grabbing two pistols each and tucking them away before each picked out a large rifle of choice. With the ammunition they needed both took off, scaling over the fence and moving through the dark lot towards the building. Steve moved to the driver’s seat and slid into the car. “Come on, Thor. You and I are going to use the front door.”
Steve stopped suddenly, the request jarring him. “No,” the blonde assured, hiking Toni farther up on his back. “I’ve got her. I told you she would be my responsibility and I’m taking care of it. I can carry her to the town.”
Steve rolled his eyes, placing his hands to the floor to slow his fall as Bucky pulled up a chair and stepped up to cut him loose from the trap. “Very funny,” he muttered, his feet hitting the ground before he pushed himself up. “Took you long enough to find me.”
"Tony, you couldn’t have possibly known that that meant he’d get me. I don’t blame you. Promise," he murmured gently. “I was just at the wrong place at the wrong time," he shrugged before pausing and narrowing his eyes. “Obadiah? As in Obadiah Stane?"
Fuck that.
“I thought I made my opinion of what you were doing last night perfectly clear,” Toni cut him off, leaning forward over her breakfast to narrow her eyes on the man. “And what do you do? You go over my head and weasel your way into my father’s company.”
Wow! So that's the end, folks. Never thought I'd actually get around to it. Thank you sooo much to all of you who have stuck with this story and my irregular updates and what not. I guess you can tell I lost interest with it but that's because Im not exactly happy with how it turned out. But for my first major story, I dont think I did too bad :) Anyways, thanks for all the kudos and reviews and I hope to have another story up soon! (One that I plan to write ahead of time so that I dont leave you all hanging for updates =D)
It certainly wasn’t a formal ‘thank you’, but it still meant something. He was giving her all of the credit before her father. It was a start. Her father gave her an approving look, nodding his head. “You did well, Antonia. I’m sorry you were ever put in that position.”
Toni left the lounge, feeling more exhausted than when she had started drinking. Watching Rogers and Barnes argue earlier really had been strange to see, but she understood both of their sides. Steve didn’t want to be responsible for loosing anyone in his business and Bucky wanted revenge on the men who had tortured him. They needed to find a balance, however, and it seemed Bucky was starting to understand that.
Tony stared out of the dark windows, watching the street lamps pass by as they drove through the quieter part of the sleeping city. Just as the drive was starting to get a little too long, they arrived at the large Estate, marking off the richer district on the city. He huffed as he slid out of the car, feet hitting the ground as he stared up to the large house.No wonder they had so much room for everyone.
Donovan opened his mouth to say more, but a gunshot from downstairs cut him off. Donovan hissed, releasing Tony’s hands in favor of pressing his hand to Tony’s mouth. “Keep your mouth shut,” Donovan snarled quietly, pressing harder on Tony’s mouth as he glanced back to the door.
Learning that her father wasn’t involved in this was liberating, and Toni felt the pressure of turning against her father and ruining his plans recede back into nothing. But there was still the matter that her godfather and her fiancé had acted without his knowledge, had made a big political move right under his nose and none of them had even suspected a thing. What had they hoped to accomplish with a war between Rogers and her father? The fact that Toni had discovered Barnes was sheer luck, so they had planned on keeping her just as in the dark as everyone else. The bigger question, Toni supposed she should be asking, was how deep did this hidden faction go? Just how many of her father’s men are involved?
Steve felt that feeling in his gut again and before he could stop himself, he was moving over, taking Tony’s arm. “If you don’t mind, Bruce, I’ll train with him. Promise I’ll go easy,” he said and Bruce nodded, stepping over to watch Bucky and Clint.
“I’ll take it.” Toni stepped in front of the mirror beside the front door, fishing through her bag for a cherry-red lipstick to accent her Metallica t-shirt and jeans. “I assume you’ll be gone when I get home? I don’t see how a stockholders’ dinner is supposed to take all day.”
It was Friday, four days after the incident, and Tony decided to take it upon himself to do the grocery shopping for the week. Which usually meant Tony would return home with two bags filled with coffee and two bags filled with junk food. If he left the shopping to Clint, his brother would get nothing but fruits and all that other healthy stuff Tony refused to touch.
“Sounds perfect,” he replied truthfully, padding further into the kitchen and leaning against the island. “Not that I don’t enjoy your company but why exactly are you here at the estate in the middle of the night? Does Steve know about this?” he asked, only partially joking.
Steve shrugged slowly, but his grip on the steering wheel tightened. “I don’t know. We haven’t started anything lately so I don’t know who would be out to get him or us."
Obadiah grinned, nodding as he clasped his hands behind his back. “Spectacular, isn’t it?" Obadiah smirked, slowly passing a second card to Tony. “That is your key to the lab. I expect you to be constantly working, Mr. Stark. Now, I’m a gracious enough host that I will allow you to join me at meals and sleep when you need it. However, if I feel that you’re progress is being stunted or you’re holding back on me, well, we can fix that," Obadiah grinned, nodding towards a large flat screen hanging on the far wall that showed a video feed from all four common rooms in the Estate.
“I suggest we get moving to the next town then,” Steve murmured, laying Toni back down and passing his backpack to his husband to carry. “If we’re lucky, there will be a doctor’s office or a pharmacy we can raid. She’s at least going to need some painkillers.”
“Steve, it’s great to see you here,” Howard greeted. Steve stood dutifully to accept the older man’s outstretched hand in a firm shake. “It’s been a while since we’ve been able to meet outside of an office.”
starting now. Come." Steve growled, slowly beginning to drag the bigger blonde through the door.
contacts couldn’t find anything out? Then Bucky was truly off the grid. At least there wasn’t a body yet; that thought was the one thing keeping Steve sane, giving him hope. “Stark would have the means to keep Bucky well hidden. Anyone involved would be too afraid to cross him.”
The gunshot echoed loudly.
Steve’s smile widened at that, a twinkle of amusement in his eyes. “Everybody needs to be saved at some point in their lives, Ms. Stark. It’s what makes us human.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Toni didn’t even snap as she normally would have. There was no sarcastic remark, no eye roll, just a tired look thrown Steve’s way. “It’s just Rhodey. He’s a family friend and he’d never do anything to hurt me or my father.”
Bucky pouted, crossing his arms. “Why does everyone get to bond with the new kid but me?”
A door opened and there was an audible click. Suddenly, muffled light filtered through the fibers of the bag on his head. A floorboard creaked as multiple feet descended the stairs (Bucky was leaning more towards basement than warehouse, now). The conversation was growing less and less inaudible, and Bucky was able to make out two distinct voices despite the three sets of footsteps milling around the room. Two stopped directly in front of him, and Bucky was aware of eyes running over him even with his lack of vision.
That made the blonde flare angrily, and Toni enjoyed seeing the way his hands balled into fists against the wood of the table. “And I’d be more concerned about you as an enemy if you had anything to back up your threat. But your sole backup is your father, who loves me. So your bark has no bite, Stark.” The blonde took up his suit jacket, tugging it on and making his way for the exit. “Have a wonderful day, Ms. Stark. And do try not miss any business opportunities in the future.”
Steve grinned. “You’re a life saver, you know. I was counting on this deal going through to expand territory.”
“Will you lose the attitude?” Ty shot back. Toni gave the man a hard look, before he groaned and tucked the device into his pocket. “Fine. I’m sorry, I didn’t mean that. Look, it’s gone.”
Toni glanced up, meeting the eyes of a redheaded woman. The woman was lithe, dressed only in black, which made her short red curls burn even brighter. Her expression was calm, even a little soothing, but her eyes were locked on the anxious bobbing of Toni’s right leg. Toni, suddenly aware of herself, ceased the movement. “Thank you,” she finally accepted, watching the woman place a tray on the coffee table before Toni and pour a fresh cup. “I don’t believe we’ve met.”
The structure was large, tucked in what must be the back corner of the old cornfield. Its exterior had been badly weathered, the once bright blue paint that had decorated its walls now chipped and stained. Steve stepped before the door, carefully unlatching it. After a moment of struggle, Steve was able to push the door open with a squeal of rusted hinges. The blonde gave Bucky a brief look, before raising his shotgun and stepping into the building. Sunlight streamed through the holes in the eroding tin roof, giving enough light to illuminate their path. There was four horse stalls, two on each side face each other. A workbench occupied one corner to their left, while a hose and other various equipment took the space to their right. Steve moved ahead and peaked into each stall, before he finally lowered his shotgun and placed it on the workbench. “It’s empty. Nothing in here,” he assured, moving back to close and bolt the door.
Bruce propped a head up on his elbow, palm against his chin as he thought. Taking a slow bite from his sandwich, he cleared his throat. "Maybe they aren't after us. Maybe they only wanted Tony."
“I said,” Bucky began, eyes on his suit as he fussed with his tie, “I shouldn’t have worn navy. It’s too dark in here and all of this blue just makes me blend in.”
“We’re running out of time,” Steve responds, matter-of-factly. “The more time we waste grappling for information, the more time Bucky is stuck with whoever took him. The more time they have to harm him, to kill him. I can’t… I can’t keep sitting on my hands here, Nat. I don’t want to blame Howard, and I know I have no basis for it. But I need to do
It was nearing one in the afternoon by the time Toni arrived at Steve’s office. She was surprised that she had been allowed through the front gates at all, seeing as the plates on her car probably weren’t registered in the guards’ books and, without riding in one of her father’s vehicles with his drivers, it was clear she was here on her own business. The guards had only glanced at her ID and had a short conversation on the phone before nodding her along, which most likely meant Steve allowed her arrival. Her suspicion was confirmed when even Sharon didn’t make any protest against Toni’s beeline for Steve’s office door.
zombies
And if anyone saw Tony's hand slip into Steve's, they never mentioned it.
Steve shook his head, rubbing a hand over his face. “Buck, there’s no way we’re going to find her. She could have left hours ago and that’s a big head start in a world where we can’t track her.”
A moment of silence passed between them before the door opened and Bucky was there, smiling. “Dinner’s ready,” he announced.
“Oh no.
He nodded solemnly, inhaling slowly before he pushed himself forward with a pained grunt. Bucky had a tight grip on his chest over the wound, but that didn’t stop how his knees nearly gave under each step. Toni was at his side in an instant, hands smoothing over his back and chest to support him should he fall. Bucky led them to the corner table, nudging aside his jacket and taking up the pistol. Sliding it from the holster, he passed the gun to Toni before he fumbled with shoving his wallet into his pocket. “Do you know how to shoot that?”
Steve smirked, shaking his head and moving past Tony. “Anything to help out a damsel,” Steve teased and Tony growled.
Clint paused in front of Tony, sighing and nudging him as he set aside his suitcase. “Tony, come on, you have to pack. We need to leave this house.”
Bucky rolled his eyes, pressing the second backpack into Steve’s arms and pulling his husband up. “If she’s so sure of herself, we might as well leave her here.” Steve gave him a sharp look. “I’m
A minute later, her world was black.
Steve grinned, reaching across the board and motioning for Toni to hold out her hand, setting the car in her palm before he placed the battleship figurine on “GO.” “Toni can be the car. Just pick something else,” Steve huffed, rolling his eyes in exasperation although there was a smile on his face.
“I can do it. I don’t need help,” Toni snarled, shoving past the two with her good shoulder. “The only thing slowing us down is your talking.”
Steve scoffed. “You two have been spending most of your free time in that lab. You should really get out more. Interact with other people,” Steve mumbled, sipping his tea.
. But I am going to make sure I’m at my best when I do it, and not give them a chance to get me first.”
“What?” Bucky said incredulously, giving her a look. “I’m the car. Pick something else. The thimble, or the top hat.”
Tony sat down at the nearest lab bench, opening his computer and his latest program, fingers flying as he typed. After a moment, Tony spoke, not even glancing up. “You mistake is in the top left-hand corner. The variable of the equation should be cubed, not squared. That’s why it wont work.”
Clint hummed thoughtfully before grinning. “A few."
Steve moved in a flash, tea slammed onto the table as he stood and stalked forward. Before Tony knew it, Steve was before him like a wall of muscle, grabbing his hips tightly and tugging him into a harsh kiss. Tony blinked in shock, eyes wide before he slowly felt his body melt against Steve’s, arms snaking their way around Steve’s neck as he shut his eyes. Steve smirked against Tony’s lips, knowing he had won.
“The doctor agrees, it’s settled,” Steve added, fists clenching at how Bucky’s expression grew impossibly more sour. “You’ll stay in this house, under Bruce’s care, until you’re fucking healed and cleared by me for work. You will not do anything before that time.”
Toni scoffed, raising an eyebrow when the blonde twisted her around his hip to dip her towards the wood-paneled floor. “Please tell me you didn’t ask me to dance just to debate our personal philosophies. I don’t care much for the humanities.”
They had been walking for nearly seven hours, only taking a break once to split a bottle of water and a can of expired soup between the two of them. The forest had given away to overgrown cornfields, but the sun was setting rapidly and they were still at least a mile out from the next town. As much as Bucky wanted to push forward to their destination, the lack of light did not create an optimal situation for passing dense fields and a new, possibly overrun town. They needed shelter for the night.
“I wish you had!” came Toni’s snarky reply, lips curled back in a sneer. “Then I wouldn’t have to look at your ugly face right now.”
“And she said she’s heading north?”
Frowning, Tony slipped out of the bed, sliding his feet into his shoes and grabbing his hoodie, throwing it own as he opened his bedroom door and moved down the stairs. What the Hell was Clint doing? Tony slipped out the front door, glancing down the street just in time to see Clint turn the corner.
“I was a sick kid once too,” Steve reminded the doctor, before leaning against the dresser on the wall opposite of Bucky, staring his best friend down. “You think the worst of it is over?”
Kudos and comments are appreciated and cherished!
Natasha didn’t respond, their eyes locked for what felt like ages before her gaze flicked to the sandwich before him. Her terms were clear: he had to give a little to receive a little. Finally, Steve grunted, snatching up one half of the sandwich and taking an aggressive bite. Satisfied, Natasha took a seat. “I have nothing on Barnes. As far as anyone in this city is concerned, he’s effectively disappeared off of the face of the earth, Steve. Whoever took him has the means and the ability to keep it quiet.”
Tony narrowed his eyes and flipped Steve off, ignoring Steve’s snicker as the blonde shut the door. He turned to his bags, tossing them into the corner before flopping into the soft sheets and curling up. This was all happening way too fast.
"Are you okay?" Clint asked, hands on Bruce’s hips to keep him steady as the doctor nodded. “It was small. Only enough to damage a quarter of the lab." Bruce mumbled, brushing himself slowly. Looking around, he felt better knowing that all of the computers, including Tony’s, were still operational.
Toni raised a brow, before groaning. “It’s nothing personal, guy. I’d ask for your name, but then it kind of humanizes the victim and then robbing you seems like such a bummer, you know?”
Toni rubbed her good hand over her eyes, before she summoned the strength to heft herself up from the hay and into a sitting position. The movement sparked a sharp pain throughout her entire right side, something between a gasp and a pained squeak escaping her lips. It caught the couple’s attention, and the blonde was immediately moving towards her. “Easy, now. You’re going to make yourself pass out again if you push yourself too hard,” he warned, one large hand smoothing over her back to ground her.
“She’s going to be fine.”
Steve huffed and walked over to Tony, standing behind him and grabbing the back of his neck with a large hand. Tony tensed and Steve rolled his eyes. “Relax, I'm not gonna hurt you. Bucky used to have the same problem when he fell asleep playing video games.”
That only encouraged more squirming from Tony. “What the Hell do you want!” Tony snapped, fighting the urge to spit in the man’s face.
Toni met her own gaze in the window and raised her chin. No more. She’d smoke out the traitors and burn them herself if she had to.
The food was abysmal, but that didn’t mean there wasn’t medical supplies left. His pack was running low on bandages and other first aid equipment; maybe they’d even be lucky enough to find a few of the hard drugs behind the counter, for emergencies or trade. The blonde opened the door leading to the storeroom behind the counter, only to pause. There was a whirling sound, like rope being pulled taut and- A pressure wrapped around his right ankle and the blonde was suddenly on his back. His leg pulled upward of its own accord, until the man was upside down, swinging back and forth in the doorway. The shotgun clambered to the ground, and the blonde ended up having to shrug off his backpack to avoid the downward pressure on his arms. “Shit,” he swore, voice gravelly.
Justin opened his mouth to argue, but Toni was already stepping free from his grip and answering for herself.. “I don’t see why not,” she assured, those words acting as enough of a dismissal for Justin to release her.
With a deep breath to steel himself, Steve reached towards his phone. Bringing the handset to his ear, Steve was just about to punch in Howard’s number when the phone itself rang. The blonde blinked, brow furrowing as he shifted closer to examine the caller ID. The screen displayed “ANTONIA STARK,” and that was even more peculiar. How the hell had she managed to get the number of his direct line, bypassing Sharon? Against better judgement (and maybe just to buy a little more time before calling Howard), Steve accepted the call. “Ms. Stark, how did you get this number?”
Justin eagerly stepped forward before she could turn away, clearing his throat. “Now, Antonia, I simply cannot let you go until we have at least one dance. Can’t you give me that one gift?”
Will Tony ever be able to settle into the Estate? Will this flashdrive bring him into a whole new world of trouble?
Bucky glanced to Clint where the man sat in the passenger seat, glaring out of the window. “We’re going to find him, Clint." Bucky murmured, touching Clint’s shoulder.
. I was going to marry him! And today just proves how little I actually knew him.”
“Those aren’t bad qualities to have when you’re dealing with the…particular crowds that I’m sure you see,” Steve began, almost hesitant to direct the conversation topic towards business after how Toni had reacted to him earlier.
The arm looked perfect, although it was cheap in comparison to the one Bucky lost, but Tony felt a bit better knowing that Bucky could at least have two arms again. He'd get Bucky to test it out when he woke; which, to be honest, a nap didn't sound so bad. Resting his head on the table, Tony slowly drifted off, humming softly.
Steve smacked the back of Tony’s head, leaning down and packing up a grocery bag. “What did I saw about talking about that?” he hissed. “Can you even keep your mouth shut? No, you cant. You couldn’t even shut up when you were being mugged.”
Steve hummed, studying the map with narrowed eyes. “What will we expect to find at his estate?”
Bruce gave him a look. "You got a better plan?"
(Three Years Prior)
"You know, you'll have to tell my brother about this little thing between us sooner or later," Tony whispered breathlessly, grinning up to Steve.
Steve held up a finger towards Toni, his pointed glare sending her hackles raising. “I don’t care about whose shift it is, Natasha, I want everyone fucking called in.”
Toni stepped out into the fresh air, glad to be free of the stuffy barn. They were in the middle of a cornfield, tall grasses brushing against her legs as Bucky pushed down the majority of the stalks in their way. The sun wasn’t shining, instead replaced with light gray clouds that threatened rain. The fall wind tugged at her waves, and the girl wouldn’t admit it, but she was grateful for Bucky’s flannel wrapped tight around her shoulders. She’d need to find a change of clothes in town, as well as food, and a weapon, and pain medication. Fuck it, she was started at ground zero. Her blues eyes studied the back of Bucky’s head before her, the rubber band restraining his hair into a small bun at the crown of his head, the tight line of his shoulders as he used his rifle to push aside the grasses. Behind her, Steve cocked his shotgun once, brow furrowed as he scanned the area around them over and over. Why were the really helping her?
man. No more operating on the whims of lower organizations and whatever change they can spare for me.”
Bucky woke slowly on his cot in the lab, stretching his sore muscles and running metallic fingers through his hair. It had to only be midnight, but he was buzzing with too many thoughts to get a full night sleep. Sitting up, Bucky yawned and stood, frowning at the sound of glass crunching under his boots. Looking down, he found glass littering the floor, broken shards that had once stood as he short barrier in the lab.
? Someone alert the press, this is front page news.”
Natasha hummed. “A match made in heaven,” she agreed, grinning as Toni made a face. “As much as he refuses to admit it, he needs someone in his life to knock him down a notch or two.” The redhead crossed her arms. “I want to thank you, for finding Barnes. Steve won’t admit it, but he was self-imploding without Bucky here and he was about to make some irreversible decisions.”
"Thank you," Tony murmured, giving Bucky a grateful look as the larger man only smiled and patted his shoulder.
Toni’s jaw clenched a fraction of an inch, her gaze locked on the swirls of pink and purple light at the horizon that faded into navy blue the higher she looked in the sky. A chance encounter that wasn’t actually up to chance. At the time, she had just been a woman in a bar, talking to a man who had the balls to approach her. Drinks turned into a date, one date into many dates, many dates into engagement, and engagement into betrayal. Toni prided herself in avoiding manipulative people, in building friends who wanted her attention and not her father’s, and her own fiancé was the one to use her. To marry her so that he could keep an eye on her, keep her out of the way, gain power.
“Because I asked the guards to let him through.”
“I meant no offense. I’m sure you’re a… well-read man,” Ty excused, charming smile sliding into place as he brushed past Steve’s hand. “We were beginning to wonder if you were really going to show.”
Tony decides to go shopping but runs into a little bit of trouble. Could this incident be the catalyst to something bigger?
Steve’s calm exterior shattered abruptly, his hands smacking down hard on the desk as he shot up from his chair. “It was only because of sheer curiosity that I allowed your car through that front gate, Stark. Figured your father might have sent you’re here with demands. He has you on a short enough leash, I figured he might have sent you to be his attack dog.”
“Justin! Get me all the information on Stark that you can.” The boss called to his second in command, who was standing by the door. The boss turned to regard the mugger with a look. “Anything else?”
“Oh no, he’s gonna get his ass kicked,” Clint said as Tony scoffed.
“Sir? What’s wrong?” Justin spoke up, sending a look to Donovan.
She stopped again, fiddling with the laces on her boots and Bucky had a sinking feeling the trip to the airfield didn’t end well. “Your father…was he bit?”
“So I won’t be getting those contracts tonight?”
Toni smiled widely, passing the last of the cigarette to his outstretched hand. “It’s settled. I’ll call Obie later on and set it up.”
“Do you two know each other?” Ty asked, looking over his shoulder at the woman, a coy smile playing on his lips. “You’re usually not this rude until after your third drink.”
And with that, Toni understood.
“As if you aren’t going to have a few mimosas at lunch,” Ty shot back, pushing his laptop aside to stand and move for the kitchen. “But I can switch to beer if that makes you feel better.”
Tony winced at the loud voice, cradling his head in a hand as he slowly and cautiously moved to the man sitting at the end of the table. The boss was finely dressed, with a smile that showed all teeth, both welcoming and terrifying at the same time. “Careful, Tony. You’ll still be experiencing some side effects from the drug." Tony’s eyes followed the voice to see Loki, walking over to the man.
And as Steve continued his night schmoozing with his own crowd, his mind never strayed far from the brunette woman. What exactly did Bucky say to her that had her replacing her usual scowl with something more…soft, contemplative? That had her looking like she didn’t completely hate Steve’s guts? With the benefit now coming to a close, Steve ducked into a quiet corner of the hall and pulled out his phone. He dialed Bucky’s number, which was so engrained in his memory he barely had to glance at the keypad. When he heard the line connect, Steve didn’t hesitate. “Do I want to know what you and Stark were talking about during your dance?”
"How is the developing going?" Obadiah asked, finally gracing Tony with a glance as he folded up his paper to eat his own plate of eggs.
Toni had sunk down onto the edge of the bed, her eyes locked on the navy rug beneath her feet. She wanted to talk, she wanted to release all that she had kept pent up this past day. However, every time she went to express herself, her throat tightened and caught the words until she was forced to swallow them back down. Toni just didn’t do
Bruce looked back, as if shocked that Tony was still in the lab. “That’s impossible, I…” Bruce trailed off as he glanced back, groaning and quickly fixing his mistake. “You’re absolutely right.” He turned, raising an eyebrow. “How did you know that?”
No, that was a big no-no. Howard Stark’s time was valuable, it was the reason his schedule was booked a year in advance. Not showing up to a meeting was rude, but Steve? Someone who her father has taken the time to groom for business and show the way around the city? It was a sign of disrespect. “Jesus,” Toni muttered, snatching up her bag and phone. Steve was only going to perpetuate his problems if he pissed off the one person in his corner, and Toni frankly didn’t want to deal with her father when he felt like putting others in their place. Things always tended to end up bloody, and while her father had a soft spot for the blonde, he still had to make some form of example of him. Rogers wasn’t just an ass, he was a fucking idiot. “I have to go. I’m sure Rhodey’s waiting,” Toni muttered, squeezing Obadiah’s shoulder and giving Ty a distracted kiss on the cheek.
Steve's eyes blazed with blue fire as he slowly grabbed Thor's arm, wrapping it tightly around his neck before lifting the man and fitting his free arm around Thor's waist. "I haven't lost a man before, Thor, and I am
Bucky’s eyes flicked over towards Steve. The girl was settled on his back now, still unconscious and still sickly pale. She was pressed against his back, broken arm wedged protectively between their bodies while her good arm was thrown around Steve’s neck to balance her. His husband had a grip on her legs around his waist, bent forward to prevent her from slipping. Steve was keeping pace, but he was exhausted and Bucky could tell. Split between his principles, helping his lover on the one hand and proving a point on the other, he finally groaned and slowed to a stop. “Come on, give me the girl,” he ordered, shrugging both backpacks off and dropping them on the asphalt.
"Oh come on, I’m sure no one will mind if you take a little…break," Donovan grinned, licking his lips.
Tony nodded and chewed at his bacon, eyes anywhere but on the mob boss as he ate. “Of course, sir." Tony murmured and rubbed at his neck as he sipped his coffee.
“It smells like a fucking barnyard.”
expect was to see the dark purple mark peeking out from the hemline of his little brother’s collar. Tony sat to the right of Bruce, back to Clint as he ate his bowl of cereal and chatted animatedly with Bucky about the idea of upgrading his arm. Now who the hell gave his brother a hickey?
The boys decided to help Tony get a little exercise.
He approached the pharmacy and surveyed its damage. The door was thrown wide open, the top hinge broken. The pane of glass, much like the display window, was shattered, leaving little glittering shards to crunch underneath his combat boots. He tilted his head to get a better view of the insides of the store, but the late afternoon sun wasn’t quite to his advantage. After a moment of hesitation more, the blonde made the commitment and stepped over the threshold. The shelves were relatively stocked, though not with many things of use. Hairdryers, heating pads, things that required electricity they didn’t have. One row of shelving was knocked over, braced up only by the support of the next set of shelves, leaving a triangular crawl space beneath. One glance underneath proved there was nothing worth climbing in for. The last aisle was adorned with a wooden sign hanging above labeled “FOOD” in intricate yellow letters. The blonde peaked his head around the corner, dismayed to find not a can of food left. There was a single bag of cheese curls on the top shelve, the plastic ripped open to reveal a mess of mold.  The rats had probably gotten to it.
Steve frowned, rubbing his face and looking Hammer over. “I want Obadiah’s schedule. I want blue prints. I want the patrol times and anything else that can help.”
A gunshot rang out loudly in the cool night air, Clint's eyes widening as he took a faltering step back.
Toni didn’t miss the pistol laying casually on the mahogany desk.
“Not my fault the kid has a nice ass,” Bucky called teasingly after Steve, turning back only to meet a sharp, protective glare from Clint. “Hey, hey, calm down, Momma Bear. I was only teasing.”
“Barnes?”
Steve took a long sip of his water, pointedly stalling his own reply. “You’ve given me this talk a thousand times, Buck. What makes you think I’ll finally take your advice?”
“My father ran our business into the ground. Took me a few years to turn our yearly profits positive again and weed out the responsible company. Now it’s me and a few of my best and most trusted friends,” Steve explained, turning fully to face Howard, gaining more confidence as he spoke and it showed in the way he straightened his shoulders and stepped closer. “I want to do more. I want to expand my operations, reach a larger base and develop a territory of my own. No longer the middle man, but
Tony frowned slightly in confusion before his eyes widened and he was immediately turning to the TV, heart racing as he ran over. No. No, the camera in the lab was offline. “Fuck," he yelled, punching the wall as he felt tears rise in his eyes. What if they were dead?
Bruce cleared his throat, packing up his things and keeping his eyes on his bag as he spoke. “Unfortunately, it would be better if you rested for longer than a day. You could risk pulling your stitches at the very minimum, Bucky. Two weeks, if anything, would be best.”
Steve tensed immediately, slamming his glass on the desk and standing. His desk chair rolled back under the force. Bucky remained unfazed as he examined a bottle of scotch. “Are you fucking joking right now? I really hope you are, for your sake.”
Bucky weaved through the few couples on the dance floor, coming to a clear spot before turning to face Toni. She was glowering at the man, but Bucky pretended not to notice as he pulled her close and pressed both hands to either side of her waist. “You couldn’t just let him apologize?”
“Yes it is. You care about her more than me,” Tony stood. “I just wished I had noticed sooner to spare myself the pain,” Tony padded over, flopping into his bed, not bothering to get under the covers as he burrowed his head into his pillow.
“Jesus
“I don’t know if you two have noticed, but the world is shit right now,” Toni spat, waving her hands dismissively. “It’s every man for themselves out here. We do what we have to do to survive and that’s what I intend on doing.”
“No, sir. We researched into him but he’s on file as a factory worker. No relation to Rogers.” Justin reported.
Obadiah liked to consider himself a patient man,one who prided in keeping his flaring temper under constant supervision. But it had become a well known rule in the manor not to bother him when he is in his study because it is here that he comes to decompress and work in peace. So at these words and the sight of the agent sliding into the office made Obadiah’s grip tighten on the pen in his hand.
Toni shook her head, slipping into a pair of flats just as a knock came at the apartment door. Brow furrowed, Toni glanced to Ty but his attention was already split between the computer and the television. The brunette moved to the door and tugged it open. There stood Obadiah Stane, dressed in a pinstripe suit and golden tie, leaning against the door frame. His grey beard was neatly trimmed, framing his bright smile at the sight of the woman. Obadiah has served as her father second in command from the conception of both of his businesses, both legal and illegal. He showed her father new contacts, new products, and was there to help a fledgling business take the city by storm. But beyond business, Obadiah was a member of the family. He had helped them through the passing of Maria Stark, and even took the title as Toni’s godfather at Howard’s insistence. He was ruthless in business, exactly what Howard needed from his second, but he had always supported Toni’s wishes to be removed from the violent side of Stark Industries. Had encouraged it, really, and that was what Toni need from her godfather. “Obie!”
“By the way he made it sound, I thought I had a few years before I had to worry about him pulling out.” Steve slumped down into his desk chair, resting the cool glass of his drink against his temple in a vain attempt to quell his throbbing headache. “My deal with Fury is in two weeks and if I don’t provide the inventory he’s purchasing, I’m going to be losing money.
Obadiah tutted, shaking his head. "Now where is the fun in that? I'm nothing if I'm not creative," Obadiah smirked. "Unfortunately, we weren't planning on him losing an arm. He just got out of surgery about a few hours ago. I had my doctors amputate."
Toni finally looked to him, gaze hard and fists clenched. “Family. Family is north.”
Steve sighed. "That's the problem. We haven't upset anyone lately. We've been improving relations with buyers and other mobs. Who would want to get to us?"
Tony gets to meet a few of the residents staying with Steve, but will Steve like how fast they're getting acquainted?
He was rather greeted by the sight of Bucky groaning, holding his head where a bruise was quickly developing over his forehead. "What the Hell happened?" Clint asked, moving to Bucky's side and helping the brunette off of the floor. He paused at the sight of the metal arm grabbing his shoulder for balance, a curse escaping his lips. "Your arm. What did they do?" He whispered.
Tony felt tears well in his eyes. “Do you know how broken I was? I walked into that party and while everyone was yelling ‘surprise’, all I focused on was trying finding your face in the crowd. And I didn’t. I spent the whole night waiting and trying to find you at that party because I wanted nothing more than to spend my birthday with you. I was so upset to learn you weren’t there, and to find out you were with Peggy?” The tears where falling down his cheeks now. “I used to think of you as someone who would never hurt me.”
The Milstein Hall of Ocean Life
Agent Donovan decides to get a little handsy while Steve and Clint get more information.
Toni wiped down the mirror until she could see her own reflection, plucking her toothbrush from the holder and wetting it under the faucet. She just pushed it into her mouth when she heard the bedroom door shut, and Ty’s muffled voice carrying through into the bathroom. Toni raised a brow at his urgent tone, but the words of the one-sided conversation were near inaudible except for the bits and pieces that filtered through. “I know we planned this… what if… kept busy… benefit tonight.”  Was he talking to her? She reached forward and shut off the faucet quickly. Without the sound of running water, Ty’s voice came through crystal clear. “I will, I’ll talk to you soon. Promise.”
“I was a little preoccupied, Bucky,” Steve grumbled, motioning towards his captured leg.
"Ah, yes, my weapon. It better be finished by tonight." Obadiah snarled, giving Tony’s hair another tug and pulling the boy to a large metal tub filled to the brink with water. "But that’s not why you’re here."
“Give him a few more minutes, at least,” Toni murmured, her eyes slowly traveling back towards the road where headlights and brake lights blurred together in streaks of red and yellow.
Ty straightened out, slowly looking over his shoulder at her with a furrowed brow. “Why?”
, alright? His daughter made it clear this afternoon that I should make sure the evidence is clear before I start throwing around accusations,” Steve muttered, turning his chair to face the window. The sun had set a few hours before, the solar lights that lined the garden below illuminating the rain speckled on the window. “But I can’t shake this hunch.”
“Besides your apartment, that’s one of the first places they’d check for me. I’m sure they’re hoping you took me there,” Bucky muttered, perking up at the sight of Steve’s mansion as it came in to view at the end of the block. “But they wouldn’t dare come onto Steve’s territory. Specifically not his house. Plus, we have a doctor at the hospital on payroll, and I’m sure he’d love to make a house call for me.”
Clint sighed, rubbing his face in frustration and shooting a glare to Tony. "Come on, we'll talk at my house," he huffed, nudging Steve towards the sidewalk before leading the way. Steve nodded and kept a firm grip on Tony as he dragged the boy with him, following Clint.
Toni’s eyes immediately moved back to the window, one shaky hand bringing the cigarette to her lips. “Nothing. It’s nothing, I was restless and I figured I could come in here and do some work while I’m up.”
“I’ll stop by the mansion in a few days with the paperwork from the new investors. Goodnight,” Toni shifted forward to press a quick kiss to her father’s cheek. She took Ty’s hand and slid out from the car, pushing towards the front entrance as Happy covered them from the onslaught of rain. Ty let himself into the building, while Toni turned to offer Happy a pat on the shoulder. “Thank you for driving tonight.” She glanced briefly towards her father in the car. “Make sure he goes home and doesn’t work himself to death.”
Bucky was quiet, studying her face before he lowered his voice and leaned closer. “So how do you sit here in this damn house so calmly? When every part of you wants revenge?”
With that dismissal, the man quickly sprung from his chair and left the office, closing the door behind him and leaving the two alone. “How scary you are when money is on the line,” Toni commented, lifting up the bottle of scotch to examine the make.
“You can stay out here. Get dad moving and head for the car. It’ll just take me five minutes to track down Steve or Bucky and then we can get going,” Toni assured, already stepping back into the building.
“I have, Mr. Rogers,” Toni agreed, her sharp eyes finally meeting Steve’s gaze confidently. “And I do regret it; this is a terrible bottle.”
Bucky rolled his eyes, leaning back into his pillows and reaching for the second half of the sandwich. “I don’t need to be babied, Steve. Tensions are high and we need all hands to keep up security. I may be injured but I can still shoot a fucking gun.”
"Thor, your fucking brother drugged Tony!" Clint snapped angrily as he watched as Tony was lifted and carried out to a dark car waiting in the driveway.
Tony raised an eyebrow and glanced over his shoulder with a grin. “What’s wrong, wonder boy? Afraid that I might be finding someone new to banter with?” Tony teased, leaving no room for a response as he walked down the hallway and out to the kitchen.
“Not even here a day and he’s getting special treatment? Why do I always have to eat what everyone else is having?” Bucky complained, reaching over and stealing a forkful of Tony’s eggs, earning a dark look.
Bucky packed up his bag and slid one backpack on each shoulder. Steve’s shotgun laid just to their right, alongside Bucky’s rifle. The girl must have been struggling with carrying both when the zombie scared her. They had gotten dinged up in the fall, but both were still operable and Bucky tossed the shotgun to Steve. The blonde tucked his arm through the strap before he bent down and scooped the girl up into his arms. “I meant what I said, Steve,” Bucky muttered, checking to make sure his rifle was loaded. “She’s your responsibility. My only job in this world is keeping you and me alive. That’s it.”
With a quick jerk of the handle, the shower’s hot spray of water came to an abrupt halt. And despite the finality of the action, Toni seemed less than ready to leave the confines of the shower’s glass walls. She had fought with Steve before- hell, that was the majority of their relationship- but today? They had both crossed a line. If Barnes hadn’t broken them up, Toni was sure they would’ve crossed a point of no return. And nobody wanted that, lest they wanted her father getting involved or an all-out war on their hands.
Tony coughed, sputtering water from his lips as his shoulders slumped. “I-I only told them about the bombs! A-and that Bucky was alive!” He cried out but eyes was only met with water again.
Tony nodded eagerly, avoiding Steve’s eyes as he moved past Bucky to the kitchen. Steve sighed softly, watching him leave before following Bucky out.
“Please, and have my beautiful hair turn grey at thirty from the stress? It’s all yours, buddy. I’m just here to make your life easier and drink your liquor,” Bucky snorted, turning his attention to his whiskey. “Now, the only real obstacle is that you’ll have to actually talk to a girl and win her over.”
"Morning, sir," Tony mumbled, slumping into his chair and taking a slow sip of the coffee in front of him.
It had been a long day, admittedly longer than usual. Delivering the weasel that had been leeching off of the imports to Steve had proved to be more of a taxing venture than Bucky had originally thought, when the redheaded manager caught wind that he was under suspicion and tried to skip town. By the time Bucky had turned up at the man’s apartment, the redhead had been halfway out the window in a crude attempt at escape. The resulting fire escape chase was almost comical, if Bucky hadn’t nailed his head on a low hanging bar. Maybe, if he was lucky, Steve would let him help with reprimanding the manager. Maybe take a swing at the guy, or at least scare him into pissing his pants. Yes, that would improve Bucky’s mood after the hell he went through this morning.
“I really need to be alone right now,” Tony whispered, turning his head away.
“Way to go,” Bucky said, tossing Clint back. “You got a hit against the Captain.” he grinned, ignoring the pointed glare from Steve.
"Wait." Tony cut him off short. “A signal. Bucky, that’s brilliant!" Tony said, moving across the lab.
“Yeah well it isn’t our job to go easy,” Bucky huffed, turning to Tony. “Just come to the gym. It’s the door right before you go into the lab. We'll all be training in there today anyways.”
“Im afraid there wont be a ‘next time’, Lou.” The boss said, pressing the barrel of his pistol to the back of Lou’s head.
"Sir, that
Clint trailed off in frustration,sitting again and resting his head in his hands. Bruce rubbed his shoulder gently, sighing. "It's okay, Clint. Now we have a motive. But we still have to figure out how all the bomb and Bucky fit into all of this. And who took Tony."
“Whoa, calm down, Princess,” Steve huffed, moving to the fridge. “I just came in for a drink myself.”
Steve blinked, glancing back over his shoulder to scan the crowd. Toni stood in a quiet corner, conversing quietly with a pretty, redheaded woman with a notepad. “I’m sorry?”
Steve looked like he had a choice comment for that, but Bucky’s gaze suddenly flicked over Steve’s shoulder to stare at the doorway. After a moment, Steve turned to find Antonia Stark leaning against the doorframe. She was dress in jeans and a white blouse, soft cascading curls tied up in a ponytail. Although her eye makeup was a bit more subdued than usual, she still sported her signature red lip color. She looked worlds better than when he had seen her yesterday, and some small part of Steve felt oddly… satisfied that she wasn’t hurting as bad now. He’d bookmark that feeling to analyze later. “Ms. Stark. Can I help you with something?”
“I just… someone with your family’s wealth and connection…” Bucky was struggling for a way to phrase what he wanted to say. “I guess I would expect you guys to be somewhere safe. A remote estate or some shit.” Unless her parents were dead, which would explain why she’s out wandering on her own. “The family you said was up north…?”
Toni glowered, slumping back against the couch and taking a breath. Fine. The wanted to make an enemy out of her, she’d show them. She waited, listening to the sounds of their soft voices in the bedroom as they settled down for sleep.  Even after they grew silent, Toni waited until she was sure they had to be asleep. Using the light of the candle, she sprang into action. Untying the shoelaces of her converses, Toni carefully threaded one lace through the loop of the zip tie using her fingers and teeth. Once through, Toni tugged the lace back down towards her shoes and tied it in a knot using the lace of her other shoe. Leaning onto her back, Toni rotated her feet in the air as if pedaling a bicycle, allowing the tied laces to thread back and forth through the zip tie. The friction of the flossing motion weakened the cable, and with a sharp tug, Toni snapped her bindings. Oh, those fuckers were screwed now.
Steve scoffed, though his eyes did wander downward. He admired the sharp lines of Bucky’s abdomen, the skin well-tanned from the long summer months. The scarring was still visible on his left shoulder, though not as bad as it had once been almost three years ago, and Steve ached to kiss it. He settled for Bucky’s lips instead, one hand cupping the brunet’s cheek and tugging him closer. Bucky, always willing, melted into him easily, one hand anchored on his hip, fingers digging in.
"Go on, Steven. The bomb will explode any second and I have become nothing but dead weight," Thor said, hand gripping his thigh where the blood was sluggishly beginning to pool.
Still, he had to admire her strength- or, more accurately, her stubbornness. Each step she took with those worn boots was a deliberate stomp, like she had to summon the mental encouragement with each swing of her foot. She made it much farther than he thought she would, and each time Steve extended a gentle hand to help her over or around something, she jerked away and stubbornly did it herself. Headstrong girl.
“Like running your father’s tech company and all of his charities in order to cover up the illegal money moving into your father’s bank account?” Steve supplied, scribbling his signature across the bottom of the first contract.
There was a chorus of agreements as Clint pried open and air vent, climbing in with Bucky right behind him. Steve gave Thor a brief nod before moving forward, firing at the men crouching behind the bar while Thor grabbed Bruce’s arm and pulled him quickly over to Natasha and Phil. Steve followed after, sliding behind the tables and reloading his handgun. “What happened?" he asked Natasha.
“For tonight? Hell yeah. We certainly can’t trust you,” Bucky shook his head, pausing in the bedroom doorway and giving her a smug look. “So you’ll just have to stay like that until tomorrow morning. By then, we’ll know what to do with you.”
, Anthony!”
Loki doubled over as far as he could as Bucky’s fist collided into his stomach. He sent a dark glare to Bucky, huffing. “I never liked you." He mumbled.
“Yeah, talk to me when you put those programs to good use,” Clint mumbled, giving Tony a light shove towards the stairs. “Now, go to bed. I’ll be right behind you.”
Tony smiled sheepishly, rubbing the back of his neck. “Promise.”
“It’s really good to hear your voice too, pal.”
Tony shrugged and leaned further against the counter, crossing his arms. “Well, yeah, I guess. I mean we both have similar interests in science and stuff. Nothing special.”
Two of Hammer’s broke with a satisfying snap that left Justin screaming again. “We have all day, Hammer," Steve grinned, giving him a look. “When. Is. The. Invasion?"
Opening the door, Tony found Donovan waiting on the other side, leaning back against the wall with his arms crossed menacingly. Donovan turned his head to Tony, a smirk stretching across his face as he straightened. Tony narrowed his eyes, holding out his weapon to Donovan and sighing. “Tell Obadiah his prototype is ready.”
“Shot him,” Toni muttered under her breath as her heel hit the gas pedal. Bucky’s grunt was his only sign of approval.
Bucky remembered their conversation in the car ride from Obadiah’s, remembered that Toni’s true fear came from the fact that she didn’t know just how deep this scheme ran. She didn’t know who was trying to lie or manipulate her- how could she, if her fiancé was able to do it for so long without her noticing? She must feel raw, like an exposed nerve. How could she protect herself if she knew nothing about the threat? Bucky shifted and, after hesitating awkwardly, curled his hand around Toni’s shoulder. “You’re safe here. You’ll be safe here until this entire situation is sorted out. I promise. Hell, you saved my life. I plan on returning the favor if it’s required. We all will here. Despite your differences with Stevie, we all look out for our own, and that includes you now.”
Toni’s brow furrowed, and she slid the glasses off so that he could get a proper look at her disbelief. “You can’t be serious.”
“Rogers.” What the hell was going on? This was increasingly sounding like a situation her father should be dealing with, or at least kept in the loop on. She has seen Steve calm and she has seen him with restrained anger, but never like this. Never with a cruel, brutal fire burning in his eyes. “Rogers, hey.”
Howard, either tactfully overlooking or blissfully ignorant to the tension in the air, straightened his tie and leveled his dark gaze on the bar in the far corner. “I’ve actually been meaning to talk to you about this issue I heard you’re having with one of your managers.” Steve inwardly cringed like a scolded boy, because
“I’m thinking,” Toni snapped. “I’m sorry it’s taking me a minute to process things. I probably have a concussion thanks to you.”
Tony turned on the shower, turning to the mirror and beginning to shave. Tony ignored how puffy and deflated he looked. Steam fogged the mirror around the edges, framing his face. His hair was flat, his face was swollen, his lip was bitten, and his heart was torn. Maybe one more day of wallowing wouldn’t hurt.
“He spent the night in the lab,” Bruce chuckled, sipping his coffee and taking a seat at the end of the table.
Steve sighed and glanced to Phil, who was biting his lip as Bruce cleaned and bandaged the wound. “Let’s go back to the Estate. I don’t want any more of my men injured tonight." He huffed as Thor helped Phil up gently, careful not to jostle his arm.
“Wow, a look? Really, Stevie? What magic.”
Toni’s jaw clenched at the harsh words, but she knew it was true. She as used as a pawn in this scheme; Ty’s presence was either to keep an eye on her, or keep her out of the way. “That doesn’t mean I shouldn’t come home with you and-“
Toni watched in confusion as the two men grinned at one another and shook hands, Ty moving to retrieve a second beer for the man. “I wasn’t aware you two actually knew one another.” She had been with the two all three occasions that they actually met, and those were hardly anything beyond pleasantries.
Thor moved down the steps after checking the upstairs. “My brother is gone as well. The upstairs is empty."
“How can you be sure?” Toni asked quietly.
Tony shut off the shower and moved back into his bedroom, heart set on flopping in the bed and sleeping his life away, but a white envelope sliding under the floor caught his eye. Tony lifted up, finding his name written neatly across the front. Steve’s handwriting.Tony stared at it for a long time, before curiosity got the best of him and he opened it.
"Im prepared to deal with that. I got you and Clint and the whole gang. How bad could it be?" he murmured, smiling up to Steve.
“And here I was, thinking that gifts were supposed to be for the one with the birthday,” Toni muttered, but the man looked desperate and a few of the guests nearby were watching intently. It would be rude of her to turn him down, she supposed. “One dance,” she finally conceded, setting aside her glass and allowing the blonde to drag her to the dance floor.
Toni grunted, but she didn’t try to break out of his hold. “How long was I out?”
Tony’s eyes slowly opened and he bit his lip, suddenly conscious of how close he was to Steve. Taking a nervous step away, Tony turned to face Steve. “I…uh…thanks,” he murmured quietly.
, the man who he had stood up the day before, the man he was about to accuse. He had been so sure the day before, so ready to tear into Stark at the prospect that the man might have taken his best friend. But Toni’s warning still echoed in his mind, and Natasha’s own reservations only served to hammer the doubt further into him. Should he wait? Wait until there was absolute, undoubtable proof that Howard was guilty?
“I like watching you sweat,” Bucky teased, standing languidly before declaring, “Howard Stark.”
Toni took the shirt from the top and let it unfold in her grip. It was a long-sleeve black Henley, pristine and just her size. “I figured you could do with something new to wear, at least until someone brings your things here,” Natasha stayed at her perch by the door, arms crossed nonchalantly though Toni knew better. All she saw was a lioness waiting to pounce if need be. “I doubt you want to be stuck in that dress.”
So lost in his thoughts, Tony barely noticed Steve slipping out of the room until he caught the sound of a door closing at the top of the stairs. With one last glance around the room, Tony moved up the stairs, padding down the hallway to Steve's door before sliding into his bedroom.
“You want to, though. Some part of you doesn’t want to see him hurt,” Toni argued. “It’s why you feel guilty about what happened. You didn’t protect him to the full extent that you could, like you’re trying to do now?”
"So what, we're just going to let Tony sit with some fucking bastard until he can get us out a message or some shit?" Clint asked, crossing his arms.
“No. I came here of my own free will to knock some sense into you. You screwed me over three years ago just to get to my father’s ear, and now you’re going to throw it away?” Toni approached the desk, crossing her arms. “My father has done a lot for you in the past, and he doesn’t take it lightly when people waste his time. But you’re lucky he likes you. So if you call him now and apologize, he’ll most likely overlook it just this once and take you back on. I know he will, as long as you don’t do it again.”
Ty looked over her, and Toni had the strange feeling he was accessing her. Finally, he nodded his head, as if deeming her to be telling the truth. “Right, sorry. Go ahead.”
“Hello? My fellow friends!” A booming voice called as the front door open and Bucky grinned, nudging Tony. “That’s Thor. He and Loki are staying for the next couple of days while their apartment’s getting work done.”
Toni gave him an amused look, turning back to her own drink and cradling it between her hands. She watched the liquid thoughtfully for a moment, before pressing further. “I can see your frustration. Hell, I get frustrated by Rogers all the damn time. If we went a day without arguing, I would think the world might actually be ending,” she joked softly.
Tony blushed, huffing. “That’s nothing," Tony mumbled quietly but his smirk was evident.
Howard hummed his agreement and Steve’s shoulders visibly relaxed. “You usually have such a keen eye for these deals. I have a feeling that Mr. Rogers and I will do great things together for this city, with your help. Once I have the contracts drawn up and Steve solidifies his plans, we’ll be in business.” Howard finished his coffee before closing the file and standing. “Steve, I’m glad we were able to meet. A friend of my daughter’s is always welcome here, as well as my business partners. You now have the good fortune of being both,” Howard proclaimed, shaking the blonde’s hand before resting a hand on Toni’s shoulder as he passed. “I have a meeting at ten, but I’ll make sure the appropriate paperwork is sent to you by noon. We’ll be in touch.”
She was smiling.
. Your apartment is not safe. And I cannot bring you home where a lot of my men have access to our house, when I don’t know which of them have betrayed the family. But I am going to weed them out, reorganize my entire outfit. And until I have gotten things in order, I need you somewhere safe. They wouldn’t dare come near Steve’s house just yet.” Howard turned his gaze back on Steve. “Can I count on you to protect her?”
His remark served its purpose and Toni cracked a small smile. “Certainly wasn’t true love or any of that shit. I didn’t really believe in it to begin with. But I thought he was predictable. A safe choice. Clearly, I’m just very bad at reading people.”
"Stane thought I needed a little motivation. Every time I fall behind or act out of line, he’s going to blow up a room," Tony whispered and looked down.
Hello everyone! Let me beginning by saying I sincerely did not think it would take me almost a year for this update. I mean honestly, what is wrong with me? Writer's block has been a little killer for my mob story, These Kingdoms We've Built, but I promise I'm trying. I just want to plan out my plot moving forward before I write the next chapter for it, because let's be real, it has a bit more involved and detailed plot than this story. That being said, I figured out a good portion of the plot for this story! So buckle up, because I have some THINGS in store!
Bruce’s grip on Clint tightened briefly before he took over typing, fingers moving faster than Clint’s from practice.
It wasn’t until Steve’s cellphone rang that the table immediately went silent, as if it were an unspoken roll that when business called, you were to sit still and shut up. “Hello…What?…How did this happen?…Alright, Nat, we’ll be there.” Steve hung up and tucked his phone away, standing immediately. “Natasha and Phil are under heavy fire at the club on South Street.” He explained and the others were immediately standing. “Bruce, you’re coming too. Phil got hit in the arm.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Toni nodded slowly. She didn’t say anything more, but Bucky could see it in her eyes. For someone who prided herself on her mask, she had such
“No, I obviously don’t! Because you’re here, obviously working with my godfather in some capacity, and hurting someone. And for what?” Toni spit out, blinking back tears of anger and raising the gun more firmly. “Don’t tell me this is some kind of moral crusade because of what Barnes does. You’re torturing a man who is allied with our family; this is a political move and I want to know what the fuck you’re planning!”
He’s talking to the third person in the room. A lackey, Bucky guesses, by the way the third man steps forward silently. The conversation floats away again, covered by the sounds of footsteps retreating back up the stairs while the bag was snatched from his head. He blinked as his eyes adjusted to the light, focusing on some lowlife brute loosening his tie and removing his jacket. “No, please kill me. I always wanted to spend my last few minutes of life staring at something ugly.”
It was easier to hear the music there, though that didn’t seem to help Justin’s sense of rhythm. Placing one hand on his shoulder and raising her other to meet his in the air, Toni allowed Justin to clumsily lead her through the song. He was bragging about something or other, a recent business venture that went his way or a shootout at one of his warehouses, and Toni was reminded once again why she didn’t like this man. Everything was about him, and he was unable to keep his mouth shut about things that really shouldn’t be discussed in public.
With that, Steve was off to his designated aisle, while Bucky took a moment to open the chili for Toni and pass it over to her with the water and a fork. “Eat and drink. All of it.”
,” she muttered, refusing to even acknowledge Steve’s presence in the room now. Of course things always work out for Rogers, and now? Now she was stuck with him for an indefinite amount of time. “Fine, send Happy over with my clothes and belongings. Make sure he’s careful in that apartment.”
are you here?” Steve asked in exasperation.
“It’s definitely nice to see you sitting up,” Bruce started, setting his bag on the foot of Bucky’s bed. “Considering how out of it you were before and after your initial treatment.” Bruce took a seat beside Bucky on the bed, gingerly reaching around the man’s neck to unclasp the sling. “How is it feeling?”
“Told you,” Steve said softly, rubbing his thumb in slow circles to uncoil the muscle. “Better?” he asked, moving his free hand to Tony’s opposite shoulder, rubbing it slowly.
The bullets were flying before Steve could even try to get a glance at the weapon Stane prized, having to duck under one of the heavy machines to avoid the heavy fire. He spied Thor already moving along the wall, ducking behind each piece of machinery he could use for cover as he slowly worked towards the center of the factory. Steve immediately set to work providing cover fire, taking down each guard he came past as he worked his way behind Thor.
Bucky huffed, stalking forward towards the brunette with all intentions of grabbing her. He could carry her against her will; it’s not like she’d be able to put up much of a fight. But before he could, Toni’s foot caught a crack in the crumbling asphalt and she fell to her knee, bracing herself before she could hit her arm. “Fuck,” she swore, her good hand clenched in a fist.
When he was good, he moved out of the door into the empty marble hallway, distinctly aware of the smell of pancakes filling the air. He found it strange that where ever he was, he wasn’t guarded. As if he could go anywhere. The last thing he remembered was eating dinner. So how the Hell did that end with him being in an unknown place? Following the smell of pancakes and the directing servants, Tony slowly walked into a large dining room.
She didn’t respond, and Bucky looked over to find her nodding her head in agreement. She looked tired and pained, looked so young. Bucky remembered what it was like living on the streets in Brooklyn, doing whatever it took to care for him and Steve. At least he had Steve, this girl had been so fucked up she believed being alone was better than having anyone around. Bucky groaned, reaching over into his backpack and fishing out a water bottle. “Alright, kid, look at me,” he directed, cupping her chin and forcing her to look at him.
Bruce nodded and touched Clint’s shoulder. “We’ll find him, Clint. We will." He whispered quietly. “Come on, why don’t you and I set the table. Bucky and Steve can finish up."
Tony sighed in exasperation, fingers flying over the computer with lightning speed as he began to open programs and examine hundreds of letters and numbers that Bucky classified as gibberish. “I’ve been working on an artificial intelligence unit for the past few months," Tony mumbled, speaking quickly. “If I can just hack through Obadiah’s internet monitors, swap unto a different signal, I can activate the unit."
Howard grunted, fingers continuing their steady course scrolling through the calendar app on his phone. “Unfortunate. Steve should have had those contracts ready moments after you delivered them this afternoon.”
dead? He had known Bucky since childhood, since they were neighbors in the same horrendous apartment building. The brunet taught him to fight, encouraged him to accomplish his dreams, and when Steve ultimately decided to take on the family business? Bucky had been there to follow him down that dark path. Now the man was gone, possibly dead, and Steve felt alone. Bucky would know how to keep a good head during this situation, Bucky would know what the next move should be, Bucky would… Bucky was
“No, no I guess not,” Steve muttered against his shoulder.
"Get us out of here, Rhodey," Steve ordered before his eyes were on Tony, taking in the brunette as if he would never see him again. "Nice to see you again, princess," he murmured, a fond smile stretching over his lips.
Before he could even start counting, the mugger tossed the wallet back to Tony and raised his hands. “There, there. I gave it back.” The man swallowed, moving to slide around Steve. He didn’t make it far before Steve grabbed his collar and pulled him close. “Tell your boss if I find one more of his men in my territory, I’m cutting off all trades and coming for him.”
Tony huffed and jogged after him, turning the corner in time to see Clint standing in an alleyway with two darkened figures. He frowned and ducked behind a parked car, listening closely. Tony always had been nosy so it was Clint’s fault for not being more secretive about whatever he was trying to hide. Or at least that’s how Tony saw it.
Steve frowned, raising an eyebrow. "What designs?"
Toni stopped before her, gingerly taking the stack. “Thank you. I really appreciate it,” she returned sincerely, placing the clothes on the dresser.
Bucky glanced down at Toni, where she sat with her back against the front of the cart, facing backways towards him. “So, where were you, before shit hit the fan?” he asked, stopping the cart to examine a display of expired soup.
Bucky scoffed, nudging Tony with a smirk. “Come on, anyone can see what’s going on between you and Steve. Besides Clint, but I think that’s for the best." He teased. “You two spent all day in the gym the other day, and you two sat together at movie night, and the way he gets jealous every time you and Bruce spend time together."
Toni slid into the driver’s seat of her car, distantly staring down at the steering wheel as she turned the key in the ignition. A bad feeling was settling in her stomach, a sense of foreboding digging icy claws into her shoulders. If this was more than just a petty move against Steve or Barnes, than that meant someone was trying to throw a wrench in the delicate peace New York City maintained. It would mean there are bad things to come.
The coffee was terrible. Tony stared down at the cup, huffing softly and taking another experimental sip. Why did it taste so funny? He rubbed his face slowly, beginning to feel a bit drowsy as he glanced to Loki, finding the man smirking as he sipped from his own mug and leaned against the counter. “How does the coffee taste, Tony?”
Natasha huffed and shrugged slowly. “I don’t know but it looks like they aren’t coming back."
“Two years ago. Steve came into the business when he was seventeen, working under his father to learn the trade. When he was twenty-one, his dick of a father died and Steve was left to take over. It was rough at first but we were all trying and things were scraping by. Then, by the time he’s twenty-three, Steve met your father and business really took off,” Bucky started, knocking back another sip.
“Hey,” Tony whined, rolling onto his belly and sitting up. “I'm not out of shape. I just don't like exercise,” Tony mumbled, eyes drawn to the powerful muscles in Steve’s back as the mob boss bent over to grab his water bottle. He snapped his gaze away from the gleaming muscles as Steve straightened out.
"Actually," Steve said as he took a calm bite of his eggs. "It was the other way around."
“No, I guess they wouldn’t,” Tony huffed, shrugging as he ran a plate under water. “Sure,” he nodded, accepting a mug from Loki and taking a sip as he loaded the last dish into the dishwasher, closing it and starting it.
“Come on, lets get you to the kitchen,” Bruce said, placing a hand on Tony’s back and leading him from the lab.
“Shit.” Ty’s words jogged her memory, and Toni suddenly remembered why she had to see Steve at all today. Toni passed the cigarette back, turning for the entrance. “I forgot to ask either of them for the contracts I dropped off this morning. Dad wants them today and they were supposed to bring them to the party.”
“Is that why you’re smoking one of my cigs?” Ty asked, bemused as he took the cigarette to steal a long drag for himself.
The reply was instant, going off with another chime. Clint looked over the response before a smile passed over his face and he looked to Bruce.
Steve snorted, tilting the hat again and tapping his fingers impatiently on the table. “Why do I have to where a hat and coat again?" Steve complained.

“I think I still managed to piss your daughter off, though, if the way she left our dance was any indication,” Steve admitted, taking a sip of the martini and carefully concealing the face he made.
“Steve,” Natasha began carefully, leaning forward in her seat and placing a hand on the edge of the desk. “Don’t start on that. Not yet. I understand that the van was found in Manhattan, but we both know that’s nothing more than coincidence.”
“I shouldn’t care. I shouldn’t be so affected by what Ty did,” Toni whispered, voice raspy and threatening tears.
It was the first time Steve has seen Antonia Stark in just about three years, and yet she still looked the same, if not slightly more…
Instead, he moved straight to the lab, yawning as he padded into the cool room. Bucky was fast asleep on the clean cot in the corner, the only form of bed Obadiah had been gracious enough to offer the “lackey". Tony moved straight for the pieces of metal he had been working with the night before, eyes focused as his nimble fingers worked to connect the wiring with the structure of the weapon. He barely notices Donovan as the agent sauntered up beside him, placing a hand on the lab table on either side of Tony. “What are you working on?" he purred softly.
Steve nodded, shouldering his shotgun. He took a moment to pry the newspaper dispensers from the doorway, having to slide aside a display of shovels and a motorized shopping cart before the automatic doors were clear. They were parted only an inch, and Steve wasted no time sliding his fingers into the gap and forcing doors open. When Bucky and Toni were through, Steve followed them, forcing the doors closed behind them. “I think we should use shopping carts. We have a lot to go through today between all the stores. I know we can’t keep everything, but we can grab everything we see and waste time sorting through it all tonight when we’re holed up for the night,” Steve suggested, rolling a cart towards Bucky before taking one for himself.
The office was silent, save for the ticking of the clock on the mantle. Steve sat quietly at his desk, forearms resting on the mahogany surface with his hands clasped tight together. His blue eyes were locked on the cellphone in the center of his desk. A bookshelf stretched along the wall opposite of the small bar, and at the foot of its shelving was a sprinkling of shattered glass and whiskey. He must have thrown his drink moments before, which made his eerie calm now all the more unsettling. When he finally spoke, his voice was hollow, gaze still locked on the phone. “What can I do for you, Ms. Stark?”
“Actually,” Obadiah began against the mouth of his bottle, turning to give Toni a small chuckle. “Your father isn’t in the best of moods at the moment. Frankly, I’m also here to avoid the fallout.”
Tony suppressed a shiver at his eerily calm voice, eyes narrowing as he nodded slowly. "Fine," he spat out.
“There’s nothing to figure out. We’re hunting her down,” Bucky declared, tossing the zip tie aside and sliding his pistol into his holster. “She couldn’t have gotten too far. Maybe we could pick up her trail and catch up to her.”
“I’m the car or I walk.”
Bucky sighed softly and moved to him, tilting Tony’s head to meet his eyes. “Here’s what we’re going to do. You’re going to make these weapons and we’ll try to get a message or clue out to Steve so that he can find us. Stane is one of his rivals."
Ty’s eyes narrowed on Toni, any façade of trying to placate Toni disappearing at her rejection. He opened his mouth, but he didn’t give her the explanation she wanted. “Raza! Raza, they’re getting away!”
“Hurts like a bitch,” Bucky started around a mouthful, and though he didn’t show his pain, his eyes watched Bruce’s hands as they pulled the sling away and started on the bandages. “But loads better than when I was in that cellar.”
“Only for those who really need it. I was a sick boy growing up, and I wanted to help some of the low-income families around the city get what they need to survive,” Steve assured. “But, of course, I can’t make a steady living off of that. I have a few partnerships here and there with some of the lower gangs and organizations around, to make sure they get what they need to do what they need to do. I only work with those with the best intentions.”
Bruce slowly leaned forward, tugging Clint into a tight hug. “We’re going to get him back," he whispered softly in Clint’s ear. “I promise if it’s he last thing I do. We’ll save him."
Tony nodded, looking up to Bruce, eyes eagerly and mouth ready to ramble. “I’m creating an A.I. unit.” He smiled brightly.
Steve nodded, turning to Clint. “You and Natasha are going to go into Stane’s manor. I wish I could give you more of a team, but security is tight at his estate and you and Natasha are the stealthiest we have. Bruce, you’ll stand by on medical support. After Stane is taken out, I’ll send out a team to take care of his weapons and men bunking in the Main Street office buildings.”
“Obviously,” Toni agreed, finally tipping the bottle and filling his glass. “You probably don’t want to hear this right now, but Steve made the right call. You’re still recovering.”
"Let him go," Clint snarled, and Tony had never been so happy to hear his brother's voice.
Tony woke to a large weight moving on top of him, straddling his waist as the cold barrel of a gun pressed against his forehead. He opened his eyes, finding a large blonde smirking down at him. “We’ve been looking for you, Tony.”
“What?” Toni seethed, turning on her father and clenching her fists. “I should be helping you. I should be home helping you regain order. Not…not
Tony smirked proudly up to Bruce. “I passed all of my math and science classes with flying colors.”
“And yet we’re still here on business. We all have appearances to keep up,” Steve joked, before offering his hand to Ty. The bastard, who had so easily brushed off such a gesture from Steve the day before, took his hand eagerly in front of Howard. “Mr. Stone.”
"Of course it will," Clint mumbled, glancing to his boss and shifting to lean back in the cushioned booth. “My sources say Stane’s second in command frequents this bar," Clint muttered lowly around the rim of his own drink, eyes scanning the scene.
"Feeling’s mutual, you bastard," Bucky growled, fists still clenched.
The man straightened his shoulders – the posture of a military man, Steve noted – and offered his hand to the blonde. “My name is James Rhodes. I’m here to see Toni.”
"Oh, Tony," Bucky whispered, wrapping an arm around the boy and pulling him closer. "It’s okay. Steve knows who we’re with and why. Even if Stane has your weapon, it wont be for long." Bucky said.
Steve’s gaze was fierce as he squeezed her hand again and brought it to his chest. “Just want you to survive. Just want you to let me and Bucky care for you. We don’t leave anyone behind, not like this.”
At that fact, Steve wisely kept quiet. The blonde took a seat at the opposite end of the table, taking the paper Bruce offered while Tony piped up. “You can have the last of my coffee,” he offed.
Finally, she just gave Steve a small nod, stepping back and disappearing down the hallway before the blonde could catch her off guard again.
Steve considered this detail, looking between Clint and Justin. “Get me the information I need. We attack tomorrow night.”
Bucky slapped the newspaper onto the desk to give Steve a view of the front page. There, front and center, was a picture of a pretty brunette speaking at a fundraiser for some local charity. “Antonia Stark.”
“I was searching the general store,” the brunet huffed, approaching the girl and sliding Steve’s bag from her arm. He tossed it over to his partner, who quickly shoved his sketchbook in with the rest of his belongings. “I didn’t realize you were
recently acquainted, after all. “But if you’re going off of those in attendance, I highly doubt some of your guests tonight are personal friends of Ms. Stark. But that’s business.”
Clint shrugged slowly, leaning against the edge of the table beside Bruce and looking over the papers the doctor was studying. “Not really. Loki wont budge and if he doesn’t soon, I’m pretty sure Steve will beat him to death."
Loki laughed, low and bitter as he glared up to Steve. “Client confidentiality." He sneered and Steve kneed him easily in the stomach. “I was paid…a bonus for…keeping…my mouth…shut," He coughed around the words.
“I have no doubt that you are,” Toni agreed, eyes locked on her nails as they traced the seam of her leather armrest. “You thought he died. There’s still a possibility he could die before this thing is over with Obadiah.”
Toni glanced away, focusing her glare on the tea tray as she crossed her arms. “
A glance down at her own attire revealed the blood and wine that speckled her sundress. Barnes’ blood. Toni gave her a halfhearted smile, folding the shirt over her arm. “You’re not wrong.” She turned to take the clothes towards the bathroom, pausing when she noticed Natasha had yet to leave. “Ms. Romanov?”
Comments and kudos are always appreciated!
Tony only shook his head, struggling to push himself up despite the pull in his hurt shoulder. “Cant rest. Have to finish the weapon by tonight,” he whispered, shivering at the cool lab air hitting his wet skin. “Or else.”
As if.
"Okay, maybe it’s exactly what it looks like, sir, but it wont happen again," Tony whispered, shifting under the cool gaze.
Ty was quiet for a brief moment, before he shrugged. “If that’s what you’d like, I wouldn’t be opposed to it. Stane is a good man, and I’d like to know him better. We’ll have Pepper set something up.”
The boss grinned, holding up a flashdrive and passing it to Tony. “I hope you don’t mind that I borrowed this."
“I made the rounds,” Natasha started, passing him a plate before moving to the refrigerator. “Bucky is still out cold and Ms. Stark and her friend were eating burgers.” Natasha returned with two beers in hand, passing one to Steve and clinking their bottles together in mock toast. “As for the others, Clint is overseeing a shipment at the docks and Sam is organizing tonight’s patrol. Just us.”
“It’s Ty’s humbleness that won me over,” Toni muttered, finishing off the wine and patting her fiancé’s knee reassuringly when he made an indignant sound.
Toni watched them bicker, pushing at each other as they argued over game pieces. It was so trivial and yet it meant the world to Toni. Because how often, in a world ravaged by the undead and psychotic survivors, can you say your current worry is what Monopoly character you were? For the first time in a long time, as she watched the two, Toni felt her cheeks stretch upward.
“For drug use?”
And as much as Toni would like to claim that the entire property served as a testament to the fact that the great, reserved Steve Rogers did have a decadent bone in his body, she knew that every amenity on the lot served a specific purpose. The pool and gym were for Steve and his crew to stay in perfect condition to enforce their business, while the office and library were for Steve to keep on top of his paperwork and related content. Even the grand dining room and lounge were only in place in the event that Steve might need to host business partners and donors. The only self-indulgent part of the whole entire place seemed to be the gardens.
Steve’s fists clenched and he looked away. “We just have to pray that where ever he is, he’s safe."
The arrow was released a moment later, bringing a small smirk to Clint’s lips as he watched the red figure crumble to the ground through the scope. “Bottom left out.” He said before looking to his right, pulling out another arrow and effortlessly taking down another guard. “Bottom right out.” He huffed as he slowly shifted on the wall. “Moving to take down the far corners.”
Toni rolled her eyes, before waved her good hand dismissively. Bucky could see the resignation on her face; she knew she had no other options than to rely on the two of them. “
“That will be interesting. How long?” he asked, using his only free hand to pry a slice free from the pizza.
Overhead, rifle shots rang out and Steve glanced to the corner office that Bucky had apparently set up in. Steve sighed, tugging out his phone and calling Clint. “What’s the report?"
“Oh, right. That’s what I meant. Dad said that,” Ty dismissed, poking his head around the doorframe to point his toothbrush at her. “Will you hurry? I’d like to be there within the hour.”
"I knew you’d be a promising investment, Anthony," Obadiah praised and Tony felt himself relax a little more. “I cannot wait to see your work." He hummed, biting into his eggs.
“Precisely. Which is why I must ask a favor of you, Steven,” Howard murmured lowly. “If you would allow my daughter to stay here with you-“
Tony pressed a hand over his mouth to stop a sob from leaving his lips as he reached up, checking for the fifth time if the door was locked. It was. “You forgot my birthday, and missed my party to visit Peggy in a retirement home,” Tony snapped, the name tasting bitter.
Bucky raised a hand, holding between his thumb and index finger a thin piece of plastic cable. Only then did Steve grasp the situation. The girl was gone, and with her, their possessions. Steve’s shotgun, his knife, Bucky’s backpack, all of the supplies from Steve’s bag, gone. Steve glanced towards the entrance and although the door was still closed, the chair they had barricaded it with the night before was moved to the side. “I told you she would fuck us over. And we didn’t even hear her do it! That tiny kid snuck around us, got our weapons while we were sleeping, and took off with everything.”
If the meeting had been rescheduled, why the hell had Ty come home so late that night? Why did he leave at all? Why did he meet with Obadiah? That ugly feeling she experienced leaving Roger’s house returned. Her fiancé was up to no good, and what if that meant Obadiah was involved? What could they be doing that required secrecy? Did her father know about this? Toni’s mind drifted to Rogers, to Bucky, and the ugly feeling only twisted her stomach further. Could it… would they…? Toni dropped the planner as if burned, staring down at the offending page. Suspicions were forming in the back of her head, half-formed and existent, even if Toni couldn’t put words to her thoughts. Right now, that all they were: suspicions. She had no right to go pointing fingers or getting her father involved unless she was absolutely sure Ty and Obadiah were up to something. Maybe-
“You’re in a dangerous business, Rogers. There’s bound to be collateral. Sometimes, people are just going to outsmart us and we can do nothing but deal with the repercussions,” Toni explained, leaning forward in her seat and resting her elbows on the armrests. “You will never be able to protect everyone from everything, but you can improve your responses. Keep your team tight and have an emergency plan in place. It’s all you can really do to prepare for these situations.”
Bucky shrugged, tossing a handful of hay into the fire. “Couldn’t leave you there with a fucked up arm. You took quite a fall there.”
“I said,” Bucky began, pushing himself up with a pained wince until he could rest his back against the headboard, “Stop lurking in the doorway like a weirdo.”
“Jesus Christ, Rogers,” Bucky hissed in exasperation, and Steve could hear the sound of a faucet turning on in the background. “No, I didn’t make a scene. Who do you think you’re talking to? I pulled him aside into one of the closed off hallways and gave him a little scare. He knew the deal was good for him, he just wanted to be an ass and make us wait on his decision.”
The brunet ran off while Steve took his knife and made quick work of her AC/DC t-shirt until she was down only to her tank top. Tearing a strip of cloth free, the blonde raced to the stream and dabbed it in the cold water before wringing it out. He returned to her side moments later. “It’s going to be alright, Bucky’s going to fix you up,” Steve murmured to her, wiping away the sweat from her face before pressing the cloth to her forehead. “He’s the best in crises.”
"Far right out." Clint smirked, grabbing his last bow as he aimed to the last corner of the wall. "It was a Christmas present from Steve. This is the first chance I’ve gotten to use it," He smirked, releasing the arrow before tucking away the bow and sliding to the ground. "Far left out. We’re good until the patrol comes back through."
There was a knock at the door of their exam room, a pause, followed by two more knocks in rapid succession.
Bucky patted his shoulder, giving it a reassuring squeeze. “We’ll figure out something, alright? Just keep doing what your doing and wait for the idea to hit us."
“In that miscellaneous aisle of art supplies and toys. It was either this, or we play Uno,” Bucky offered, taking a seat on the floor beside Steve and peeling off the cellophane seal.
Comments and kudos are loved and cherished!
“Yes,” Bruce huffed, smiling politely before turning back to Bucky’s wound. “We’ve… well, we’ve actually met before. The Maria Stark Foundation hosted a fundraiser for a children’s cancer research project I began. It was brief, just a handshake and-“
“How is she?”
The woman’s smile grew wider, something closer resembling pure elation. “Saving you was pretty satisfying, but the look on Ty’s face after I shot him? I think that topped everything,” Toni grinned, before pointing a finger at the brunet’s sling. “You’re going to have to put that revenge on hold until your arm heels, though.”
"Tony. He hacked a signal to his laptop," Bruce explained, crossing his arms. “We need to know what’s going on. Let’s start with the weapons Tony is making.
Steve nodded once, before his eyes leveled on Toni. There was something strange about his expression, and Toni realized it was missing its usual notes of exasperation and contempt. Dare she even suspect some form of gratitude was coming? But Steve merely nodded towards the tea, stepping further into the room and taking a seat in the armchair across from her. “Were you injured?”
The thought kept rattling around in Steve’s head, intrusive and nagging. Every time he tried to do work, tried to formulate plans, the question flashed like a neon sign in the forefront of his mind. And the trouble was: what if Bucky really
“Cheater,” Tony huffed, rolling onto his stomach and pushing himself up. “That wasn’t fair,” Tony mumbled, turning back to Steve. He took a step forward but Steve was faster, swiping a foot out and easily kicking Tony’s foot out from under him, watching the boy stumble.
Bucky frowned and touched Tony’s shoulder. “He didn’t…
. It still stung now as when he said it this afternoon. Like she didn’t make her own name for herself, taking her father’s company and increasing its profits in a year alone. Like Toni needed her family’s wealth to get by in this world.
Tony blinked thoughtfully. “I didn’t think of it like that,” Tony said. He slowly circled Steve, eyes darting to examine every possible movement and outcome. Tony watched Steve wind back his arm for a punch and Tony could practically see the numbers swimming around them. The speed of Steve’s swing, the amount of force Tony would need to take Steve down, it was all right there.
“Fine,” Ty muttered, waving one hand dismissively before pushing himself up from the chair. “We’ll all go to lunch. Whatever you want.”
I'm alive! I'm so sorry, I definitely did not intend for a month and a half to go by before updating! August was such a long month between birthdays and moving back to college. I'm really going to try and be better now that everything has settled, so without further ado, here's the next chapter!
Bruce stepped over to watch Tony and Steve from the side lines. “Hey, Tony, just use my trick. Think of it like science. Velocity, acceleration, it’s all there. Use your brain as your advantage.”
Steve took a breath before turning towards the brunette. “Ms. Stark,” he greeted, watching tentatively as she dutifully stood. Toni accepted Steve’s offered hand, though her eyes followed Ty. “I see you have helped yourself to my wine.”
Tony opened his mouth, insult ready but he didn’t get a chance to use it as an all to familiar and irritating voice spoke up. “Give him back the wallet.”
Tony gave a slow, hesitant nod before sighing, leaning into Bucky. Bucky frowned slightly, pulling back to look down at Tony. “What…Tony, what exactly happened when the took you a few hours ago?” he asked quietly, watching as Tony stiffened.
Bucky hooked his arm around her shoulders, leaning heavily on the smaller brunette as they took to the stairs one at a time, Toni doing her best to urge them along without straining Bucky. “Our car is parked out front, keys still in it.” She was whispering now as they approached the cellar door. “We were expecting to just pick up Obadiah and go but he’s running late. We just have to make it past the sitting room without getting Ty’s attention and we’re golden.”
It was an hour into their hike along the side of the abandoned road, weaving through trees here and there, when they heard it. A high pitched scream to their left. It frightened the birds, who squawked and fluttered from the trees in a massive flock. “Oh, this is looking like my lucky day, Stevie. Sounds like our thief got into some trouble,” Bucky grinned over his shoulder, raising his pistol and taking off through the trees.
It was a place that combined beautiful architecture with the highest of practicality, not that Toni would admit any of this to Steve himself.
Loki groaned softly, spitting blood on the floor before him as he glanced up to Steve. “The boss is going to make sure you all die," Loki snarled. “What a shame that it will be Tony who takes you all down."
“Are you two alright?”
Slowly, he turned his head, eyes widening at the sight of the metallic arm now in place of where his old one used to be. “What the hell?" Bucky hissed, even more puzzled as he curled the glinting fingers, bending the elbow and rolling the wrist. He could control it?
Tony’s eyes narrowed and he sat up, brushing off his shirt as he glared up to the man. “Really? You have nothing better to do with your day than to rob me?” Tony complained, fishing out his wallet and passing it over, watching the man look the item over. “Honestly, if criminals put half the effort they use to mug people into an actual job, maybe they wouldn’t have to be mugging in the first place.”
Toni straightened out, taking a breath before pushing off of the desk. “Think about what I said. Play this really careful, Rogers. I’d hate to see my father make you crash and burn just because you got jumpy before you were sure.”
Steve smiled, appreciating the sentiment though he found his gaze drawn towards the sleeping girl. She was so guarded, defensive and borderline hostile.
Bruce sighed as the car pulled out of the camera’s view, shutting off the computer. “Look’s like Loki went with them," He mumbled, rubbing his face.
“How long before we can dispose of him?”
"Business?" Bucky asked, adjusting the strap of his sling before turning to face the brunet. "You're wondering why he changed?" A nod from Toni. "His mother died, that's what changed."
Did they steal any money? Bucky ducked when a hunk of metal was lobbed through the window, smacking against the wall and falling the ground. Bucky watched the object roll to his feet and he frown, leaning over. “What the…" He trailed off, eyes widening.Grenade.
"Thank you, sir," Tony murmured, slowly taking a bit of his sandwich and watch the mob boss closely. Since when was his lunch delivered?
“Stark’s daughter and her fiancé.”
Bucky snorted, stuffing some of the straw into the bucket before he fished around in his backpack for a book of matches. “Horses? Can’t say they’re on my post-apocalyptic bucket list.” He lit their last match, before tossing it into the bucket and producing a small fire to light the barn better. “You should get some sleep.”
Tony snorted, an offended look crossing over his face. “Writing computer programs is
Seated on one of the stools was Stark, her back to Bucky though the tense line of her shoulders told him she was aware of an intrusion. She was still in her blouse and jeans, though her once neat ponytail had lost a few small strands by her ears. She looked bored, elbow on the bar counter and cheek propped up in her palm, one manicured nail tracing the rim of her glass. Bucky guessed he wasn’t the only one stuck in this house. “Why is it I always find you around either food or booze?”
Steve took point leaving the doctor’s office, both backpacks limp on his back while he nosed his way out into the street, shotgun first. The asphalt was adorned with dark patches here and there, the only telltale sign that it had rain the night before, thanks to the warm sun above. They moved down the empty street, following the sidewalk and staying close to the buildings as they approached the first intersection. The buildings of the small town had sustained minimal looting, if any at all following the initial panic at the outbreak. Doors were ajar here and there, but there was no signs of broken glass or fire damage that accompanied many of the other towns they had seen. The days following the government’s collapse had been chaotic. Every man for themselves.
“Because you both are stubborn idiots.”
Tony's stomach flipped at the sight of Steve as the blonde stepped out and lifted Tony into the back seat, allowing Clint to have the passenger seat while Bucky and Natasha squeezed amongst the guns in the back. "Steve," Tony huffed, barely audible as the blonde squeezed into the seat beside him.
“See, we kind of live in a world now where what you might
Natasha turned the car down the perpendicular street, and Steve realized only belatedly that she was taking him back towards his home. “We’ll find out what happened; we have people working around the clock to assure that. But
Toni smiled a bit wider, something more genuine than the predatory, fake smile Steve had grown accustomed to. “I was a fan of yours, Dr. Banner, before and after the fundraiser. You do amazing work for the hospital, of course, but your private research is very interesting in itself. I particularly enjoyed the paper you published on anti-electron collisions.”
An hour later, a car was parking across the street from the house. Inside sat two men, one with short, buzzed blonde hair and the other with his long black hair pulled back into a ponytail. They both glanced to each other, nodding as they slid out of the car and check their ammo before moving up the steps of the house and kicking open the front door.
“Sure, and that was amazing for her to do,” Natasha coaxed. “But you are worried about her.”
Hello lovely readers! I know its been forever, but between school and my new job, spare time has been few and far between. But I'm here now, with a new chapter! And I think I can guarantee you can expect another chapter before Christmas and both this and These Kingdoms We've Built, I just have to get past finals. So for now, enjoy this chapter and our first look into the rise and fall of broody Toni!
Bucky made a face, but Steve knew he agreed. There was nothing they could do about it. “Fine.
“I’m sure he had wonderful things to say about me,” Steve huffed, taking a sip of his whiskey before looking her over. She could see he was still confused by her presence, uneasy even. After a moment, he spoke again, as if trying to test what a normal conversation with her would be like. “I’m just trying to look out for him.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Clint shook his head as he sat down at the table, digging into his waffles. “You’re gonna get your ass kicked, kid.”
But perhaps this was a sign that it was finally time to put this feud to rest. What did either of them gain from bickering and hurting one another? They hardly saw one another at all, despite the few outlying instances the past two days. They both worked closely with Howard, and being able to meet without one going for the other’s throat would be preferential. They didn’t have to be friends, Antonia didn’t have to completely forgive him, but they could at least be civil acquaintances.
Clint smiled, ruffling Tony's hair and leaning back to look him in the eyes. "You scared me half to death, kid," Clint muttered as Tony grinned.
"When do I not?" Tony teased and Natasha rolled her eyes, stepping forward.
“My twenty-first birthday party.”
Bucky wakes and he and Tony talk about what they're going to do.
Bruce paused, stunned, before he huffed a small laugh and nodded. “It was a rental.”
A man turned to face him, eyebrow raised as he slid his glasses from his nose, polishing them off before setting them on the lab table he was working at. “And you are…?”
Tony offered a weak groan when Bucky sat him up gently, letting him rest his back against his chest for support. “I’m sorry. Obadiah wanted answers and I couldn’t…I couldn’t
Steve grunted in acknowledgement, nodding slowly. Thor was right; the more Steve doubted his team’s abilities, the more likely something was to go wrong. But at the moment, Steve’s main focus was to get Bucky and Tony back. He hasn’t lost a man yet and it wont happen today.
Toni huffed, waving goodbye as the car pulled away, tired sloshing against the wet asphalt.
Without hesitation, lightning quick and unwavering, Toni lowered her pistol and fired a shot into Ty’s thigh. The man crumbled to his knees with a curse, shaky hands gripping at the wound. Toni stepped forward, lowering to his eye level, lips curling back in a sneer. “Never said I was going to kill you. Doesn’t mean I’m not willing to put a bullet in you,” she whispered lowly. She straightened up, turning for the front door. “And the wedding is so fucking off, Stone.”
Toni had truthfully forgotten about all of the excitement from the night before. She had been sated by her father’s assurance to check into the matter, and really, what more should she feel? Sure, Toni had felt a moment of weakness the day before; she had really wanted to make some form of amends with Steve to end their brutal arguments. But that’s all it was: a moment of weakness. Steve was an ass who didn’t deserve her time, and the only reason she expressed any concern for his situation was because Barnes was a semi-decent guy who was suffering from the violence inherent in the system of illegal business. But her father would offer them some advice, and that was all Toni could really do for them. That, and put the whole group out of her life. No more arguments, no more hatred. Out of sight, out of mind.
The mob boss huffed softly, matching Tony's grin as he dipped down to kiss along Tony's jaw. "One thing at a time," he murmured, grip tightening on his hips.
Steve's smile turned bittersweet as he stood and tucked his gun away. "Perfect. I had a feeling you'd agree. Now, if you two will excuse me, I have a meeting to get to. Clint, you can have the night off. Settle your family issues because I expect you to be on time tomorrow." He hummed, striding out of the room, the front door closing behind him.
Maybe that would be nice.
And there was the opening Steve had been waiting for to direct the conversation towards his interests. “I’m sure a man in your father’s line of work has a lot of things to worry about, the safety of his daughter most importantly. I can only imagine the dangerous men he must deal with on a daily basis.”
“Tony, that isn’t fair!” Steve argued, standing up. “Do not use that against me. I know I never dated her but I still cared about her!”
with my brother. What the fuck were you thinking?”
“Good.” Natasha nodded resolutely, her expression returning to its carefully neutral state. “We’ll get our information sooner or later. Once it hits forty-eight hours, then we’ll start pushing our suspicions. Not just on Stark, but anyone who might have a reason to take you on.”
"The next day, there was an explosion in Tony’s chemistry class when his lab partner tried to mix chemicals." Clint mumbled, twiddling his thumbs and keeping his eyes on the ceiling. Bruce frowned, stepping closer slowly; he had remembered reading about that in the papers. Clint gave bitter chuckle, looking away. “I was out with a few friends when I got the call. I remember going to the hospital and seeing mom and dad in the waiting room." Clint paused, reaching up to quickly swipe at his eyes. “All I could think was that it was my fault. I told him I never wanted to see him and the next day, he nearly dies."
Rhodes and Dugan gave respective nods from where they sat, eyes still memorizing the map. Thor placed is hand on Steve’s shoulder, giving it a squeeze. “We will not be of any disappointment.”
“I could’ve walked.”
“A bit young for graduating college at the time, weren’t you?” Bucky asked, mostly to keep her talking, open her up a bit more.
. Tell Barton to take the rooftops and have Sharon on the police scanners. Scramble the rest and have them searching through our territory.”
“No. Howard whisked her off the moment she came back to our table. Haven’t seen any of them all night after that,” Steve explained, leaning back against the wall and looking out over the crowd. “But she did give me this look.”
The mugger frowned, turning slowly to see Steve Rogers, pistol in hand. His eyes slowly widened and he stumbled back. “
“Keep talking like that and you can be dog, since you’ll be in the doghouse,” Steve argued in return, though there was no heat to his voice.
Clint nodded, taking a deep breath and leaning back, wiping his eyes one last time before hardening his expression with determination. “Alright." He murmured, silently thanking Bruce for listening.
"Tony, what did you do last night after we got home?" Clint asked nonchalantly, eyes on the eggs he was idly pushing around the pan. "You disappeared pretty quick."
“I invited him to stay for breakfast. We had spent most of the night in the study talking through some plans. It was so late I offered Steve here one of our guestrooms,” Howard offered, eyes not breaking from the paper in his hand.
Natasha was already ahead of them, dashing down the hallway and disabling anyone who passed them while Bucky picked off the stragglers that poked their heads out behind them. Tony followed along easily, just as happy to get the hell out of this place as Bucky was. "Did you miss me?" Tony grinned to Clint as he ducked behind a corner.
Tony sighed and relented, nodding slowly. Maybe he could deal with working with one of Obadiah’s mindless agents. He could use the help, although Tony was reluctant to finish these weapon prototypes. Knowing Obadiah, he had the worst possible use in mind for them. And the last thing Tony wanted to do was aid in the destruction of others.
"Shit," Steve growled, hitting the brake and sliding out, running towards the house and trying to ignore the sinking feeling in his chest.
Bruce grinned a nodded. “Perfect, Tony.”
The guilt disappeared from Steve’s face, replaced by a defensive fire burning in his blue eyes as he stood to match her position. “I think I did you a favor. Your father loves me and my ideas.”
She had been so eager for his gratitude, when she and Bucky had first returned. She saved Barnes without any expectation of gratitude, but it still would have been a bonus to hear a genuine “thank you” from the mouth of Steve Rogers. And yet, now that she had it, Toni didn’t know how to feel. She had spent three years hating this man with a passion and now… now they were being civil and Toni didn’t entirely trust it. In her defense, they had started out on what Toni had thought to be civil terms at her twenty-first birthday, only to find out his intentions were to manipulate her for his own gain. Three years of hating each other and now he was thanking her? It was an awkward end to an awkward conversation, and Toni felt at a loss for words herself for the first time in a long time.
Bucky grunted, but nodded. From there, they continued on in silence, a comfortable norm for them. Too much noise could draw attention and, with only one gun, they were already at a disadvantage. Steve had honestly hoped he could get through to Toni, maybe show her there were people in the world worth fighting with rather than putting the weight of her survival solely on her own shoulders. But that opportunity was gone, alone with their supplies and weapons. She really did fuck them over.
“I need to call Stark.”
She choked on the words again and Rhodey drew her back into his chest, pressing his forehead against her temple and rocking her slowly. “I’m so sorry this happened. I wish I could have protected you from it,” he soothed quietly, hand smoothing up and down her back. “I’m so sorry, baby girl.”
Tony sat up and rubbed his face, pulling the plate closer and taking a hungry bite. “Thanks, Clint, “Tony mumbled around a mouthful.
Clint took pride in his ability to notice anything and everything; his eyesight was what earned him the name ‘Hawkeye’ on the street. And his eyes definitely picked up on the way Tony’s shoulders tensed the slightest bit. “Went to bed,” Tony hummed around a mouthful of cereal, turning in his chair to flash a smile at Clint. “I was exhausted.”
In that moment, Toni made a choice. Because if this was the business her father was going to be in, stabbing friends and partners in the back like this, she wanted no part in it.
He brought the bottle to her lips, lifting her head enough for her to drink. She drained half of the bottle before she tipped her head away and cleared her throat. “Where are we?”
"My second in command was taken by your little mob," Obidiah hissed into Tony’s ear, watching with satisfaction as the boy jerked nervously from the voice, coughing hard. "Which means they know I have you." He hissed. "What did you tell them when you messaged them?"
Rain pattered a staccato rhythm against the window, drowning out the ticking of the clock perched on the office’s fireplace mantle. A blond man was seated at the mahogany desk, chair reclined back and one long leg crossed over the other. His suit was a sharp navy blue, the fabric stretched tight over his muscles, accented by a thin black tie. His elbow was propped on one armrest, cradling his chin in his palm while the other hand balanced a glass of whiskey on his knee. He was the picture of peace, gaze drifting lazily over the gardens outside the window despite how the rain blurred the image. The man was so lost in his reveries that, when the clock on the mantle chimed, his blue eyes blinked in surprise. How long had he been staring off? What had he even been working on?
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony glanced to the large, blonde agent standing by the door, blue eyes narrowed on Tony. “Yes." Tony mumbled quietly and looking away. “Agent Donovan," Tony recalled the name with a shiver.
“No,” she said after a moment, eyes flicking between Bucky and the doctor before she pushed off the doorframe and entered the bedroom. “I was on my way to the kitchen and I just… I guess I just wanted to see how this idiot was doing.”
“He’s right,” Steve said firmly, nodding his head and holding a hand out to Toni. “Come on, I’ll carry you. You’re still in no condition to walk.”
Steve kicked the front door closed behind him, carrying two pizzas into the kitchen and setting them down on the counter. Natasha was the only one present, carefully lifting two plates down from the cabinet. “Just us for dinner?” he asked carefully, opening up one of the pizzas.
Toni shifted back in his lap to wipe at her cheeks, but never moved too far out of his embrace. “I don’t know what hurts worse; the fact that I let Ty use me, or the fact that I meant so little in my own godfather’s eyes. He helped raise me, Rhodey. He was at the Christmases and family dinners, he took me to visit colleges when dad was busy. Now dad could be surrounded by enemies in our own territory and I… I can’t do a thing,” she rasped, warm tears spilling one after the other. “Why can’t things ever just…just be good for a change without any manipulation, any schemes, any…any…”
“Which one?”
Steve’s fingers tapped idly on his thigh as he watched the street lights pass over them, their black armored car maneuvering through the city’s dark night. “How much longer?” he asked, voice firm and battle-ready as he glanced to Rhodey.
Bucky blinked, still in shock that Tony was here. So it must have been his captor who took Tony. “You…you did this?" Bucky asked, motioning to the metallic arm and stretching it out slowly.
The brunet tossed his jacket over the back of the brown leather chair before Steve’s desk, rolling up the sleeves of his white button-down on his way to the bar in the corner. His dark locks were freshly styled, and Steve would’ve sworn his friend had just started his day if it wasn’t for the dark-red speckles of blood staining the sleeve of his right arm. No doubt from Bucky’s “meeting” this morning. “And who am I supposed to be meeting with?” Steve asked, brow arched.
"What, are you gonna tell me you would've understood?" Cling hissed angrily. "I lied to protect you! Getting you involved in mob business will only lead to trouble!"
Bucky hummed, answering for Steve. “Natasha and Thor have their own places in the city. They come by every now and then but usually we only meet up when we’re doing business. I live here with Steve and so does Bruce, whose on the other side of Clint’s bedroom. And now you two are here.”
"Nonsense. I’ll have an assistant to you by lunch time tomorrow," Obadiah hummed, taking a bite of eggs. “Don’t you worry." He smiled. “I’ll make sure it’s someone you can be comfortable with. Think of how much work you’ll be able to get done with some extra help." Obadiah smiled, proud of himself for the thought.
Warm shafts of light streamed through the dirty blinds, thanks to the morning sun. Bucky took a moment to appreciate the way those beams splayed against Steve’s broad back as the blonde packed up their bags. They had spent the night on the tiled floor of the exam room, both of them quickly lulled to sleep by the rain outside. It wasn’t often that they indulged in going to sleep at the same time; in a world where anything could come for you in the night, the paranoid became the survivors. But the exam room door locked from the inside, and placing the doctor’s stool against the door assured the two that, if anything did manage to make their way inside, they’d definitely hear it.
is my style.”
Tony was already taking a shaky step back but Steve was quicker, the blonde surging forward and grabbing his arm, shoving him against the brick wall of the alley. "And why not?" Steve growled, eyes narrowing on Clint and holding Tony firmly in place.
“She and I were recently acquainted at a local fundraiser.” At least it was only half a lie, he assured himself. They
She was up and out of the shopping cart, and it felt good to finally stretch her legs. Without the pain or the morphine to cloud her mind, she could finally appreciate the godsend that was this town. The general store, much like the supermarket, was relatively untouched compared to other places. The shelves were lined with odds and ends, and even the front counter still had lighters in display cases and an assortment of cigarettes on the wall. Some of these things were real delicacies in these times.
“I was thinking this afternoon.” Toni had to strike quickly, just in case bad things were planned that might only grow worse with inaction.
Steve stiffened, turning around and, sure enough, Howard Stark was making his way towards their table with his daughter and future son-in-law in tow. She work a simple cocktail dress, navy blue and off the shoulders. The sleeves wrapped tight around her arm until just below the elbow, where they tapered out into a bell shape that ended at her wrists. The dress’ hem stopped just below her knee, with a long slit traveling up the length of one thigh. Her shoes were black, the heel as sharp as the point her toes were forced into. Her dark curls were forced back into a sleek ponytail, tight to her scalp but spilling down her back in wild waves. She blended with the dim atmosphere, taking the dark motif and running wild with it. Her blue eyes found Steve just as easily and, because Toni was a stubborn thing, didn’t look away despite the tension in the air.
“Barnes.”
Tony choked on his sandwich as Bucky was laid down onto a lab table; it wasn't hard to see the missing left arm.Tony felt absolutely sick to his stomach, rushing to Bucky's side and assessing the damage. His body was littered with cuts and bruises, a few stitches here and there, but Tony was sure the missing arm took the cake. "What....w-what did you do!" Tony hissed, looking back to Obadiah.
Toni nodded, because of course Rhodey
go for the pharmacies first.”
listen.
“This isn’t about running into Rogers earlier today, is it? I didn’t really want to see him or that street rat Barnes here tonight, either. I guess they’ll let anyone in these days who can write a check over a hundred dollars,” Ty snorted. “But hopefully your father won’t send you anywhere near him for the foreseeable future.”
By the end of the day, Tony was beat and sore, resting on the sparring mat with his face pressed into the cushioned ground. Bruce had long since moved on to his lab while Clint and Bucky went off to start dinner, leaving Tony alone with Steve, who was still going at it with the punching bag. “I don't know how you can keep that up,” Tony mumbled, rolling onto his back to look to Steve. “I'm exhausted.”
Obadiah tutted and Tony was once again dunked into the water, struggling once again. A minute later and Tony was yanked back out, water cascading down his body as he sucked in a deep breath. “The
