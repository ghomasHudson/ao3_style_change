“Jarvis don’t you dare!” Steve hissed.
“Sorry if I went a little overboard.” Steve said sheepishly as Bruce took the trays to the kitchen.
“My legs are jiggling desert food and my back is on fire.”
It took months of planning and observation with a small team, even Coulson did not know. For all purposes, in 24 hours Captain America was going to be dead.
He wasn't lying; the GPS put Buck in town at a super center. This was good; she clocked his reactions when speaking, a sort of mental detection for deception. Given the tremble, had gone uncorrected – it happened again when he set the box down. She could surmise that even Loki hadn't noticed it. That was odd given that the once prince always seemed so cautious of his actions.
Bruce nodded along and slipped the tablet from the seething nobles fingers. "That's just their opinion and one I do not agree with. I think you look very handsome. Now, what do you want for dinner?"
The break came when one of the idiots made a call to their boss.  Apparently, ‘interrogation’ wasn’t going as well as they’d hope and they ‘didn’t know how much more the so called first avenger could take.’  Someone named ‘Corvus’ was ‘really putting the boots to the guy, it’s getting messy.’
Bruce balked and crossed his arms. “No I'm not. That's not at all and you know that. What I meant is we thought you were dead Tony.” His tone turning somber as the pair made their assent. “Steve...he felt it. He was so broken Tony. I have never seen anything that bad, he was nearly hysterical with grief so I had Natasha take him up to your nesting room to try and calm him down. It was that or I would have to tranquilize him and the only thing we have on hand strong enough is Hulk darts. I didn't want to drug him like that.”
Barnes pauses on his way and takes out his phone, “maybe I could call Jane...see if Thor's in town.” Tossing the idea around of asking his brother-in-law of getting Frigga to come for a visit. Loki always seemed to perk up for his mom.
How can they find me in these shadows he has cast. I am the lesser...the spare child should he fall. I am a poor replacement .
Calm was beginning to settle around the team, as much as it could at the end of any fight, they always had that tingling kind of static about their bones. Like they were all waiting to see if the peace was real or if something else was going to come up from the depths and swallow them whole. It would likely feel like this for the next few days until the calm truly settled in.
The man in question sprung up flipping form the couch with an ungraceful thump. “Damn it Pep! Can’t you see me wallowing here? Can a man not mope in peace!”
Steve sat up on his own, trying as best as he could to not appear as beaten down by his own body as he felt. “Yeah ok.”
Even so, “You should try and get some sleep.” The beta said fixing a cup of jasmine tea. “I know you haven’t been getting enough and Tony would pitch a fit if he knew about it.”
Kurt spoke with a lively tempo, tail swishing to-and-fro as they sat on the grass watching the younger children play. Loki had managed to catch about every other word and nod accordingly while picking at the egg salad sandwich the other man had forced upon him. It's not that he didn't enjoy the company it's just that he wasn't used to engaging much just for social reasons. Loki wasn't one to do anything that didn't have a purpose. Truly, his alpha was one of the few people he had lengthy conversations with, and lately – James had little to say to him.
Dorothy’s precious ruby slippers had been a mottled grey in his memory.
“Raise oh death, oh twisted writhing thing of nightmares. Rise and fill me with your life oh enemy of light. Bid me your prideful scales, bid me your crooked fangs. I call to you lend me your power and let it become mine, misshapen beauty of the cruelest design. Let me breathe for you and deliver vengeance in your name… Lavation!”
Taking a deep breath the ravenette stepped into the spacious closet. It was much grander in the tower than the one back at home in the cabin. Frankly, it reminded him of his room on Asgard. Not so much in the design but the grandiose feel of the place. Stark was not one to do anything by half. In a way, it was nice to be spoiled.
Steve just groaned and bit his lip to hold back a curse.  Finally motioning his hand for the doctor to proceed.
Just feeling the others arms wrapping around him Loki felt his skin chill comfortably. “And I you.”
That dark sleazy voice wasn't who he was, he wasn't some spoiled brat who thought he deserved better. Tony had given that up so long ago.
He did for Tony, for that moment his mind closed in on that one ray of light and thirsted for the comfort the Alpha could provide. Then the guilt came.
“Congratulations. It’s Twins,” Simmons said smiling as she taped the screen. “They are monoamniotic so baby A was probably in front of Baby B in the first image we took at shield. You can see them both clearly now.”
Bucky walked around him surveying the fit and fall of the garment. He reached out unbuttoning the blouse by one, two, three closers. “You know honey, moral girls remember to wear their bras. How can I let you go out like this? Have other guys eying up my dame cause they can see her tits through her dress? What kinda joker do I look like?”
The alpha rolled her eyes, “I will Mr. Stark, take care you two.”
It took a few days of discussions to decide what to do with Bucky. The talks ranged from the unthinkable to the down right cruel. Meanwhile, the arm Hydra created had been removed - including the kill switch that had been deeply embedded in the shoulder mechanism. All done by Tony, he didn’t like Barnes but it didn’t necessarily mean he blamed him either.
“Yeah that’s what’s not going to happen, Jarvis shut it down”
The sharp burn brought it all back into focus.
There, sweet and warm everything that was home.
Bruce smiled thoughtfully, of course she could tell. “Just something Steve said while he was here, probably nothing but...”
“Yeah, wish someone had taught me that one.”
“But Maya said...”
“Steven.” The older man sighed as if terribly annoyed, “This is far more important than those stupid creatures, do as I say.”
Tony nodded “Alright, call Simmons see if we can get her on video conference.”
He thought of going down to the workshop but did not want to be a distraction. In addition, he was tired, Steve did not feel tired often but when he did, it hit him hard. This was no exception, he felt worn down to the bone for some reason. Therefore, the soldier had climbed in bed alone and slipped off to sleep. It wasn’t until the wee hours before dawn that Steve’s eyes flickered open again. He was warm so he pushed back the covers; it was more than just a slight rise in surface temperature however, he felt like this was coming from inside. Like the fevers of illness from his youth, the ones that left him drenched in sweat and delirious while his mother sat by his bedside praying for him to live.
AN: Ok, I kicked around tons of AU ideas and storylines and it seemed like nothing was working. That was until I stumbled upon the song - Rise up-by Andra Day, now if you haven't see the inspirational video for this song I highly recommend it.
In the beginning, she had not let her guard down around the former Winter Soldier. Natasha watched him, studied him because she had to be sure. This man was going to be near her family and she wasn't going to let a wolf in sheep's clothing fool her.
All he wanted in that moment was to make it right, and maybe something or someone was listening because the doors opened and the one person he wanted was standing there.
Stark smirked and leaned in kissing along the blonds neck, “I'm Tony Stark babe, do I ever do anything half way?” The answering rumble in the solders chest was enough to stoke the alphas ego. “I miss you baby, I want my omega back. Need you.”
“I get it, kinda.” Tony said looking the other man over the steam rising from his cup.
It made sense now that Steve thought about it, Tony had been so attentive and yet hesitant. Not in the way that suggested he didn’t want to, but in a way that seemed almost- Fearful. Stark had been avoiding him lately but not actively treating him with cruelty, so maybe this was just Tony feeling insecure. Still, while that quelled some of Steve’s worried it didn’t put an end to all of them.
Sam shook his head, “Right, it was nice meeting you Mr. Stark.”
Cameras flashed and the happy cheers from friends, family and fans alike filled the air. It was picturesque and perfect.
“You are killing yourself Anthony.”
“Light up your face with gladness. Hide every trace of sadness. Although a tear may be ever so near. That's the time you must keep on trying. Smile, what's the use of crying? You'll find that life is still worthwhile
Howard was the worst of them, he was old school, Maria was to be seen and not heard. She accepted it with poise and grace; she smiled even when there was nothing to smile about.  Even through all the hell she always smiled, Tony hated that.
A long black car pulled up to the towers garage entrance. The unexpected visitor captured the meticulous attention of the security cameras and personnel alike. Inside Jarvis would have already announced the presence of the luxury vehicle before the tires had barely stopped rolling.
“Stop Tony, you only want this because it's easy. Because its familiar and it feels safe to you, we haven't been us in a long time. I told you to stop drinking, you won't. I told you to give up the suits because I didn't want to lose you, what did you do?”
This time the ravenette scoffed and groaned, pushing away with a weak hand. “Don't be stupid. If I had wished to suppress my heat I could have. You take me for one of your fragile mortals.”
When they located the Vengeful armor, Steve didn’t need any more time. In this case, he’d take a page from his husband’s playbook and just dive in.
James sat and centered himself, trying to focus back on his mission and all the solid black and white order of it. However, there was even edges of gray in this assignment.
Frigga would have corrected her son, he was not like the golden haired sea witch, and he did not desire power or pain.
She had expected Phil, but there was someone in the passenger seat. A man in a ball cap and shades his face was turned away but there was something  about the shape of his jaw. Something that made her fingers twitch around the paper tube of her overpriced coffee.
Loki's shoulders curved inward and his head dropped. “I think not...it's better this way. Mother was always fond of Duchess, She belongs there with her. “
and last but not least -
Footsteps on the back deck catch his ear, Duchess would eat an intruder no ifs, ands, or buts about it, and so Loki is out side...but at this hour?
The idea that he could have missed out on his son’s life, on waking up again to find the person he loved long dead or their mind riddled with dementia. Steve didn’t think he could bear that again. He had such a hard time seeing Peggy like that. The thought of Tony, his Tony, his brilliant husband  struggling to remember what day or year it was.
The omega thought for a moment, it really was the best option they had and while it would hurt sending Bucky away again. In the end, his friend may have some chance at a life. “Yes. We will extradite Bucky to Asgard’s under grounds of criminal insanity. If he can’t be treated then… We cross that bridge when we get there.”
“Huh…it actually can get tighter…Bruce, I think Steve’s outfit is defying physics. It shouldn’t do that, I think that needs testing. Steve would you be a peach and whip that off? Maybe do a little spin for daddy?”
You get what you need
“And nuttier than squirrel shit.”
Tony looked at him fondly once more, “I never thought I’d be happy to hear you telling me what to do…be back in a shake sweet lips.”
She smiled, even if it was a sad and broken express that sat too thin on her aged face. "You have a son."
“Well, the night may not be lost yet” she said, eyeing the ships slow approach. Perhaps this would take her mind off her troubles by playing with the foolish mortal.
The ravenette clasped his hands over his lap and found a patch of floor to glare at rather than the blue eyes in front of him. “The truth? From me? That would be an exercise in futility would it not?”
Sam glanced over before returning his concentration to the various dials and readouts “yeah, it has. That smell in the air, electricity before a storm. I just hope Stark's Ship is as good as his weapons.”
“For all intensive purpose we think the most substantial component is psychological. Although environmental differences could play some role, with Loki's upbringing on Asgard, I doubt it. The climate there is not that much different from here on earth. If anything the fact that New York has such cold winters should be a boon given your biology.”Bruce said leaning forwards and adjusting his glasses.
Maybe it was his nature interfering -Tony wanted to tell the nosey Alpha in his brain to shut up but he couldn’t, he wanted to get Steve out of there as soon as possible. Everything about the blonde’s poster seemed off right now. When they started digging into Steve’s past, it was just reminding the omega of everything he had suffered. Tony could see with every moment Steve was pulling away, trying so hard to hold his head up in this body that wasn’t his- straighten out those too broad shoulders and put up every appearance that he was different now.
Thankfully, the scan of the area didn't reveal any surprises. '
James had a feeling this wasn't going to be pretty.
Steve laughed as they entered the main seating area, the smell of breakfast wafting from the kitchen where Banner was busying himself and Barton's older children.
Honestly, he was happy that it wasn't the gold and green armor of the fallen nobles’ previous invasion garb. No towering helm or rather obnoxious cape. In there place were jet-black leathers and dark metal bracers. The man looked more like an assassin than a Prince. Twin blades sliding into his hands as the Ravenette stalked through the fray.
They had another unique little gift from Howard Stark.
As the sunlight grew dimmer with the end of day, the luminescent jellies swam in through the colonnade arches and huddled together in the palace domes. The small creatures created a flood of soft violet light when they crowed in one place. Bathing the halls in the welcomed hue.
The next week was so calm it was almost weird; everyone in the tower started to notice the little domestic behavior going on between the lead pair. It created an air of peace and prosperity that none of them had felt in a very long time. The Tower was beginning to feel like a home, the way it only can when there is that familial stability. Some may scoff at the confines of biology - but it worked, having a head alpha and omega made for a stronger pack.
Still, he noticed the way Steve had a hard time looking him in the eyes. When he did, he looked…sorry, conflicted. Since the journal, he looked that way even more so. Had there been something back then? Something between Steve and Howard?
“Yes Sir...”
A lie. The tell – a sharp short intake of breath after his initial answer. As if trying too hard to steady his words. Why would he lie? Had Loki been fired? That was doubtful because that wouldn't have been something he could hide, so he was laying out then – sick leave? Loki wasn't human so Natasha doubted very much he could suffer from the common cold. To her knowledge, Thor had never been ill.
I’m starting to feel weird, it’s to hot in here.
Howard Stark.
Steve looked down at his hands as the tone of their conversation turned somber, “Yeah, we know. The pack I mean, we all talked about it. Tony …I think he would of agreed if I pushed it more, he’s not forgotten about what happened but he’s not the kind to hold grudges…”
The doctor nodded, “Yes, it does bring you into a higher risk category but you’re very healthy and the babies both look wonderful. We will just keep an eye on things and do our best to keep you healthy. I already have some lab assistance working on some prenatal supplement alternative, with your metabolism as it is. We’ll be using the protein shakes Shield made for you as a base and see what we can do.”
The soldier looked over at were his pups were coloring at the coffee table and smiled. These were the days he would always cherish, memories of sunlight pouring in through the massive floor to ceiling windows, the golden beans lighting the twin’s baby-soft hair like halos around their head. Little tongues poke out in concentration as they careful selected colors from a large bucket between them. Peter and Wendy wanted to have pictures for their daddy as welcome home presents. Such warmth in that moment of innocence, he wanted for them to hold on to this as long as possible before the world outside tainted the happy image they had of life.
They had been playing together with Sif and Fandral; Loki was the smallest but had been trying so diligently to join in their games of play fighting. Sif was none to pleased to play the part of the fair maiden and Fandral and Thor dueled with their wooden swords. Thor had tripped and Fandral meant to “kill” him and end the game. Loki wanted his brother favor so he dove between them letting the harmless toy strike him. Perhaps there had been more force than the older boy had though having such a smaller frailer target suddenly dash in the way.
Clint and Natasha sat at the controls, both chatting quietly about weekend plans. Every now and again Natasha would say something in her native language and Barton would fluster, refusing to answer whatever it was she was saying. It wouldn’t take a genius to guess what that was about. Mostly because the focus was not with them.  Phil had stayed behind with the Shield team to comb through the rumble of the hydra base.
James sighed gratefully as he adjusted Loki in his arms. “Yeah Jarvis, Is the Doc around? Or Stevie? I need some help here.”
Additional when on a vacation one does not expect to get a call to assemble not once but twice. So really, this was Steve’s fault.
“Is this what you want then?” He shrills throwing his hands wide ending his falsehood. The room is still tidy though less than perfect. She cannot understand why going to the trouble of hiding a bit of dust or a haphazard pile of unguarded papers. Maybe he just couldn't bear not having everything perfect. In truth, those sorts of things would have made her far less suspicious. Worst about all of these lies isn't the home, but Loki himself. Seeing him clearly, now she realized this wasn't the man that had invaded New York, or even the man who returned with Barnes. This was someone else, a man worn to the end of his rope with nothing left to give. The logical question would be to ask how James hadn't noticed this.
Maybe that's when Tony learned he was only wanted if he was interesting or relevant. Or maybe he just learned to be the loudest.
He had seen it  in his Alpha, Logan carried around so many ghosts of the past and there where times that he sat up in the night and stared out in the darkness for hours.  Kurt had also seen it in himself a time or two, he never had an easy time of it but his faith kept him strong, his friends and family had buoyed him on in those dark hours.
“I was just thinking, Peter and Wendy will be starting pre-school soon, then kindergarten so they won’t be as much of a handful at least for most of the day. In addition, the team has grown a lot in the last few years. We hardly ever get called out on joint missions any more, I haven’t had an assignment in a few months actually.”
“Go back to bed I’m fine, I know you have that meeting with the board and you won’t be worth anything if you’re half asleep for it.”  Steve groaned leaning on his now crossed arms. The position killed his back but at least it took some of the pressure off his hips.
How dare she, how dare that vile witch do this to his son. Had she not taken enough? “AMORA!” He screamed swirls of magic covered the raven mers palms. “You made a fool out of me, you lied when all I did was trust you! You and your worthless hide I gave it all to you and still it was never enough. This is one thing you will not take from me!”
The omega nodded along and allowed the other man to fall into step next to him, “I suppose that means I shall have some additional work today as well.” This wasn't a problem, Loki had made himself knowledgeable in a myriad of subjects. Not to mention the thankful distractions additional classes would bring.
“We both need to get clean, and then you need a shave. Ok?”
Coulson considered that and narrowed his eyes. "Ergo we both pissed the bed on this one. Then again there is no time like the present so... Loki, I forgive you."
Seeing Barnes had hammered that into his head. That poor son of a bitch might lose the only thing he had left and here Tony was- handed the proverbial golden ticket. He had a second chance at life and yet here he sat, pissing it away with what ifs and would haves. Sure, maybe he'd done one hell of a job at scrambling up is own brain in the process, but he'd fought back against worse hadn't he? Giving up right now wasn't an option, as long as he had what little was left of his own self then he hadn't lost. Moreover, there was a whole tower full of people ready to stand behind him to fight his way back to the better part of himself. All of these people were counting on him and Stark would be damned if he failed them.
Bullets flew past and Steve rushed forward, the shield clanging off walls and enemies.  He rounded a stair well and saw it, a flash of a long dark coat and red skin.  His blood boiled and jaw clenched running after the villain from his past.  Steve could hear a roar from outside the compound and a loud boom as an exterior wall no doubt met the fists of an angry Hulk.
“No.”
Things escalated as the heat began to swim through his brain. Steve found himself on his belly with his Alpha at his back. For all his talk and posturing Tony was remarkably gentle. Kissing down his spine with praises falling from his lips on every other breath.
“Tony…” Steve wrapped his arm around his alpha that night in bed, snuggling up to the inventors back. He waited a few breathes before nuzzling a little more intently against the alphas shoulder.
A few days later, Howard had sent back a list of all the flaws he saw in the grainy black and white newsprint. Tony had wanted to tear up the letter and throw it in the trash but then he noticed at the bottom of the list. In his fathers not so need scrawl
From his vantage point he could see there was something about the metallic blue glow of the mechanics eyes that seemed...less than human now.
"How do you want it baby doll."
“Crystal oh gem of my heart.” Tony pulled Steve’s hand up with his and kissed it. “It wasn’t one of my finer plans, but I’m ok, Pep’s forcing me down to get looked at though. Ya know how she is with all that… ‘Band-Aids and Bactine‘ stuff. She‘s worse than my mom was.”
Tony Stark wasn't exactly easy to love, because he didn't even love himself. He didn't think he deserved love. Let alone did he deserve James Barnes to look at him like that with those big bright eyes and easy smile. No, Tony didn't deserve any of that from a man like James Buchanan Barnes.
Holy shit not like that!
“Alright boy seems you’ll be good for something! You’ll have to work harder now Anthony, you’ll be taking over the company one day!” Howard clapped him on the back laughing. It was that to loud laugh that made your ears crackle when you were standing to close. the old man must have had a few this morning. Lesson one in being a Stark alpha; you can never get a hangover if the alcohol can beat it first thing in the morning.
Something changed between them after that, an odd sort of friendship of equal parts mutual respect and curiosity. Over the next two years, they saw each other frequently even when not on avenger business. Just two friends talking or going out to see movies, Steve loved seeing the films he had missed while in the ice and Tony loved being the one to show them to him.
Loki nearly purred, “There’s that rage I adore”
They were happy, weather either one of them deserved such happiness.... Well that was up for debate.
She tilts her head back against the wall and eyes him, “I think you’re the only guy for it.”
Found on the album - Love thy breakfast meats.
Little things from a new car Tony was looking at, his critiques and likes for the design. Barnes commenting how ' it must be nice to have a fleet of cars ya spoiled brat.' Stark just stuck out his tongue and returned with a right jab.
Still, lying there alone in that double bed all he could think about was the manic brunette and the way the light in Stark’s captivating brown eyes had dimmed over just a few short days. How Tony seemed to shrink right before him under the accusing glares and harsh words thrown around him. Steve wanted to protect him even when those warring parts of him mind said that Tony needed to take his own medicine on this one.
Hill looked down a moment and then back to the camera, her face not nearly as trained and blank as it had been before. Now there was something else -fear.
The addition of thin reservoirs in the finger joints, it wouldn’t affect performance - not in any wide margin. However, what it did do was allow him to feel his environment more keenly.  When the clawed fingergaurds sunk into a body and the blood bubbled through the wounds. The warm sticky substance would pool around his fingertips.  The subtle warmth growing cold as the life left their eyes.
“Noted. Jarvis get us some chow from the great north will ya buddy.” Tony dropped his libido in favor of staying on good terms with his omega. Moreover, he knew Steve well enough to know that after lunch he would get all snuggly and then if the inventor played his cards right - snuggly turned into horny quickly. God he loved those hormones sometimes.
Even Logan wasn't as brash once one got to know him. The gruff man said the pair of omega were '
All the while, Stark was a quiet presence in the background, so unlike himself that it made the others, Barton especially, feel uneasy. Tony was always a flurry of motion and sound, to see him standing there so stately, felt...wrong. It was like looking at the suit in sentry mode 'the lights are on but no ones home'. That was the case though; Stark might have been there physically; mentally however, he was a million miles away.
"The cold never bothered me anyway!!!"  As Loki finished the last line the sound of laughing and clapping filled the room, little screens lighting up on the bedroom wall showing Tony red faced and laughing so hard he might die. Natasha giggling over her coffee and Clint holding up a sign that said 9.5.
“Yeah well I can’t smell a damn thing other than gas fumes  and  the overwhelming flour scent of downy at this point honey. I have to tell you it’s a hellish mix on the olfactory glands. Why?” now that Steve mentioned it, there was something cloying and calling under the mechanical odors.
“You almost died.”
The gentle voice coaxed Steve out of his slumber. He had forgotten what day it was, but of course his Daddy remembered.
“No I do not. However, I would like to point out that had the reactor or major systems failed there would have been a back up terminal failure signal sent to my servers. Sir is alive, and my on-board systems are functioning.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“He’s…well, he’s … Okay, I’m not going to stand here and lie Prof. He’s not doing great. Better, but still not great.”
All through school it was more of the same, the constant stress to over achieve. He would sit for hours and yank his hair trying to will the thoughts faster. Then he figured out the saudering iron really worked better.
The omega seemed to think this over before grabbing the offered hand and dragging the slighter male into the nesting room. He was doing this for Tony so it was ok. Tony needed help so it made it ok, it wasn’t about him and this didn’t make him weak. He was helping his alpha and that was important.
A young man named Steve Rogers, or as his Stepbrothers call him- Cinders.
Steve looked up from where he had paused mid stride. “Yes sorry.” He felt foolish for getting lost in the past like that; it seemed he’d been doing that a lot lately.
“We don't know that for sure, Bruce said he had some stuff to look over and...”
"Yes very good, there is a baby, now  your name I am very sure is Peter right?"
“Clint...I know, just promise me that even if you can't come home now, that you will come home?”
It was just Tony.
Part of the inventor wondered however, was it truly over? As the adrenalin began to ebb away and he felt the painful cold biting his skin. Maybe this was just a new kind of hell, a kind where he had to look in Steve’s eyes and see the reflection of what he had become looking back.
Tony managed to get himself upright after a few false starts. “Alright gimmie whatcha got J!” The boosters flared and shot the suit up through the murky depth like a mentos in a coke bottle.
A rumbled chuckle makes this thighs quiver. The alpha looked up with hooded coffee colored eyes and hollowed his cheeks. Steve was a bit of a lightweight when it came to this, if his mate kept this up he’d be done for in a few minutes at best.
Truth be told, becoming a super human killing machine hadn't been his highest aspiration, but if it was a means to an end then he'd take it. Just like his new affiliation with Hydra, the shadowy organization shared many of his own beliefs and could get results where he and his band of misfits had seem to fail.
“No, He's staying in the tower with James still.”
All the while trying to keep an eye on his stepfather’s cat. The old tomcat had a sour disposition and one remaining eye. Its name fitting, Fury.
“He didn’t…he didn’t say anything.”
Tony stepped forward raising his chin in defiance. The light flooding his face to highlight the lack of sleep and care. “ Do you really care what Steve wanted? This isn’t about that anymore, it never was.” His voice calm and dark eyes dead.
She had assured him it wasn't selfish at all to find a way to decompress once he came home, be it from SI work or Avengers missions. Steve had a similar ritual that mostly consisted of staying at the Compound or Shield for a few hours just letting his mind get out of  'soldier mode'. Tony didn't have a problem with that yet somehow things that applied to other he had a hard time of applying to himself.
“Loki, baby doll…come on sweetheart.” James felt his heart clench as he stroked his omegas face. The way Loki’s eyes had glasses over when Cho dashed from the room with their child. He had seen the baby; she was so small, so still.  He knew that she was gone.
Pepper crossed her arms looking at the man as he tried to decide between several pairs of sunglasses in the hall mirror. “I would have thought a near death experience would have made you more responsible.”
The most surprising support came from the silent couple on the other side of Natasha. Clint and Phil.  Barton wiped at his eyes, maybe he understood better than most. Despite his past feelings about Loki, having seen the omega looking more like a ghost as of late had changed his perception. Loki wasn't this thing of nightmares that his mind had supplied, he was just damaged. That was cold hard truth of it, Loki was damaged just like the rest of them – he just hid it a lot better.  “We'll all keep an eye on him. You need some time to yourself to work through your own stuff. “
Tony couldn’t stand it; something in him just cracked his last year at University. He was never allowed to just be a kid and now he was going to graduate and have to sit behind a desk and be his old man’s right hand?  Something about that turned sour in the young man’s stomach. Images of starched shirts and days filled with meetings and worst of all being paraded around like a show pony because of his genius status. It all just felt wrong, Tony felt the walls closing in and he couldn’t fit in that perfect mold Howard wanted. He never could.
“It‘s been shit around here. All the disconnect going around, we call all feel it. None of us have been the same since that day.”
To Steve he looked like the most hansom man ever.
Steve looked over at his alpha, “I’m surprised you haven’t caught a whiff yet.”
“Ah, I suppose that would be a give away wouldn't it.” Thor comments, scratching his head before hanging his hammer on the coat rack. The weapon looking comical next to a collection of rain jackets and umbrellas.
Barnes headed back toward the kitchen commenting wryly over his shoulder, “Are you sure I can't make you anything before you leave?I could make you some bacon, I know how much you like it.”
“You agree to find that sea witch; I will restore Sergeant Barnes and pay you all handsomely for your efforts. I wanted not only experiences sailors but also warriors. I believe that with the technology I have created, the maps I have gathered and your expertise…I can finally get my revenge. Will you agree?”
It was Loki after all.
He can feel it… the one thing he has feared more than anything else can in this world. “He's ….he's dying I can....” He can't say it, the air won't fill his lungs and his chest is burning. “Feel it...I can feel him...no. not him…please God. Please!” He's sobbing great ugly cries and pulling at his own hair. It feels like someone has sunk hot metal hooks into his chest and back and started to pull from all sides. Like every wound he's ever suffered is opening up and he'll never be okay.
It was over wasn't it?
From the outside looking in one would think in was just like Tony, hours spent working, tinkering and perfecting. Only this was not like him, this was manic to the point of violent. He had spent a few days redesign one of his more ‘sporty’ models from a few years ago. Trimming off weight of the body; enhancing the thruster systems; adding a few more hand-to-hand combat features. He wanted to get up close and personal and make it hurt.
“Isn't he though?” Bruce quietly said standing and walking away from the table. “Loki's body may perceive his environment as 'Threatening' because his mind see's it that way. If you were in a place where you felt like a monster, like everyone hated you.”Bruce took a breath and rubbed down his face.“ Trust me it isn't easy.”
Seeing the tears brimming in his friends citrine eyes, Loki leaned forward and hugged him. “You will both be wonderful parents. Even Logan ..the big bear he is.” he chuckled offering a handkerchief.
It sounded like a bomb went off, that’s what Steve thought anyway when the whole facility shook. On the other hand, maybe it was just him. It was hard to tell, his captor had moved from knives to some sort of flogger that had lines of barbed wire and glass. Between lashes, he’d be showered in freezing water from a pressure hose. The serum was working as hard as it could but Steve felt like he was dying, his body felt wrung and his voce horse. Still he kept repeating his name, rank and number. Even when it sounded like nothing more than gibberish. At one point, he found himself saying Tony’s name repeatedly.
Inside they found a cache of weapons made for three of their crew along with diving masks the likes of which no one had ever seen.
“Unca Loki!!!!' Peter cheered running to the elevator as soon as Jarvis announced the pair’s arrival. Wendy wasn't far behind with her own happy little sequels.
Tony jumped in. “Look I’m not a huge fan of medical. I get it, but if he won’t go home to magic ass Viking land and let Dumbledore or whoever the fuck look at him - then this is all we got.”
“Tony.. Tony.. I don’t ..ah. make it stop..”
Somewhere in the dregs of his mind, he remembers vaguely the screams that echoed through the old tenements. Wails of the bonded omega just a few months into the war. They didn't need a telegram from the war office or a Chaplin in uniform to break the news gently. When a bond was strong, you knew.
“Of course he did, the spy twins have to stick together,” Tony muttered, hoping over the rail. The armor hovered down to the 11th floor landing. The suit folding away from his body and reforming into a streamline briefcase.
“I’m done listening Jim, now stay down!” Vengeance landed, the black armor was nicked and beaten but still in better operating shape than its steel color counterpart.
“No problem, not like I cooked it. Coffee?”
There are some things just worth fighting for.
The guard raised an eyebrow but nodded in understanding. Enough people thought poorly of the youngest prince that to believe him capable of infanticide.
“Check this one out, her name is Elda and her hobbies include: Watching reruns of Jag and bingo. Ever watched Jag Cap?”
“Thank you Sir.”
“Yeah J, what’s the word my coded compadre.”
…I like horses not a hamsters :Loki
“Very funny Tony,” He’d smile snatching the bottle out of the mans hand.
Steve rose to his feet, not exactly sure what to say but the worlds stumbled out. “But Fury said...”
I love all of my nights to end a little bit nasty
“Well I wouldn’t have to if your kids would get off my bladder. I was on the sofa before I came in here.”  Steve said not even missing a beat before popping another chip in his mouth.
“Her name is Ophelia Sarkissian, she was a lieutenant under Red Skull, the first woman to ever climb the Hydra Ranks.” Barnes said, his eyes grew colder with each passing second spent glaring up at the screen. “ I watched her die in 1974. The Asset...I was brought out for a mission, Ophelia had...overstepped with Strucker. He wanted to take the lead, create a legacy for those swearing allegiance to the cause – a way to groom the next generation of hydra. She stood in the way, she wanted to keep things militant – hard training and experimentation, she thought his approach was mollycoddling . Strucker had Pierce on his side though, he had the entire old boys club that never cared to much for hydra's little Viper.”
Stark furrowed his brow and glared at the computer screens. “First one I can accept, the second one though...well that's just not true.”
Loki took the gem and searched for Amora, it had been a while since he’d seen her last. She was always so busy it seemed always something to do and somewhere to go. He caught a flicker of golden hair out of the corner of his eye in the bow of a sunken ship. Calling out to her seemed like a poor approach, he was not a child calling out for attention. Instead, Loki slipped between a rupture in the ship’s hull and found Amora arranging jars on a shelf. Once he was close, he noted what was with in them.
[Human pancake]
Tony hissed and tried to pull away only to be tugged down the hall. “Ow…. damn. No! I don’t care what they think. Lesson one from you if you recall! Also I’d like to point out that I did the math and it was perfectly safe.”
Tony was changing and now sending his son away from the tower. Someone had to do something and as usual, Pepper Hogan was there to try to talk her friend and employer out of things once again.
Perhaps she was being assigned?
Howard nodded and folded his hands, “I see, then you have never seen a miracle nor known magic.” The old man had a bittersweet smile as his mind played over images of his younger self and new bride, the happiness of those early days and the life within her. The birth of his son and then… then nothing but horror and pain. The bitter taste of being robbed of his soul and every last ounce of joy until there was nothing left but a man filled with wrath and fueled by bottled spirits. “When you are granted a mere glimpse of heaven only to have it taken away… then you will know what sorrow genuinely tastes like.”
She rolled her eyes, the humans bravado was a thin veil for his nerves. Putting up such a front to conceal the true weight of his request. The tactic was one she had seen a thousand times. She would likely see it a thousand times more. “What makes you think you have anything I desire? Or that your offer is worth your quest? Tell me what you want.”
“My building my rules booboo kitty!” Tony smirked leaning over to playfully bite one of the omega’s nipples.
Clint chimed in between a mouthful of bread stick, “They prolly had sex or something, I been calling that for a while.”
Now here he was seated at a candle lit table with fine white linen napkins and silver that shined more than his shield. The omega wanted to do this right, trying to break into the vault of his mind and pull out old etiquette lessons from his youth. Steve mildly wondered if they still taught omegas etiquette in school. Something told him they probably did not. That of course did not mean he was going to embarrass himself in front of Tony by scarfing down his food like a starving man.
Welcome to my omegaverse shot book! feel free to request your fave pairings
That the formality with these debriefings, more-or-less regurgitating information that SHIELD no doubt has already read backwards, forwards, and in seven different languages.
There was a beat of silence before the lift doors open, clearly the AI had thought better of his orders. Considering Tony's hatred of constantly having to repair something around the city following an assemble. A code green in the tower would in no way end well.
It wasn’t his, No… this was a result of a new ‘upgrade’ Stark felt like he wasn’t feeling enough in the suit. He never spoke the words and did not answer his AI’s questions to the gauntlets design.
Natasha just rolled her shoulder at the time and looked back at the taped security cams. “It's quieter, if they get caught breaking in then they are no longer an issue. If they make it out of the facility, it’s just a matter of interception. The only tie would be them and not SHIELD. Theft with reasonable deniability.”
The omega would have argued his point until sunset, but black spots were popping in his vision and a chill tickled down his spine. Everything began to blur and slide, the sight of the shiny red armor in front him began to fade to a muted umber as the world went sideways. “..Tony…”
“Go away!” He heard Darcy shout and now his sore chest felt even worse. Something was happening, and he wanted to push her away. Something..something...
“Sir, the children are requesting entrance. Shall I let them through?” The voice of the towers ever-faithful AI keeper said over the lowered volume as the track switched over to Dio's – Holy Diver. The softened almost imperceptible intro of wind and whining organ giving way to guitar almost as a compliment to the AI's prim enunciation,
When he entered the first thing Steve noticed was his music was playing, the omega blushed. Maybe Tony was going to laugh at the selection. However, that didn’t seem right now that Steve looked around.
The bed part would have to wait because his bed was empty. That was not correct, he was pretty sure that when he left – he left a very pregnant omega.
Tony returned the attitude in kind. “You think I don’t know that, trust me gramps I know to do my research. The guy had my old man’s hand written journals from back in the day. I had Jarvis run the writing samples and it’s legit. I think you know I’m right, what I’m wondering now is if anyone ever warned you about that handy dandy little superboy shot you had.”
Tony scrubs his face and looks over, glaring at the instrument in the other alpha's hands. “No, it wouldn't. I just...had to know how far this shit went. I fucked up this time Buck, I don't think I can trust myself anymore. I shouldn't have...I”
He knew she would do it, that’s one thing he could always count on with Widow, her word meant something - especially her threats.
He wanted to hit something and that was immature, Steve knew that but really, if he could have gone down to the gym and broke a few heavy bags he would. He couldn’t though, laying a hand low on his stomach he wondered if he was doing damage even now.
“He never walks away; he has done so much to restore my faith. I guess you where right about one thing; Steve Rogers is one hell of a man. Ya know something else. He’s a hell of a father.  He’s kind, he stays… and best of all. He’s nothing like you Howard.”
“I think maybe Loki pushed things aside to quickly? I really can't say. I've been so busy with my extensive research, Pepper calls me to let me know how things are going of course. He's... he's not okay.”She lays a hand on the worried blondes forearm.“James is working hard not only for Loki but for himself too. These things take time Thor.”
“Look Bruce, I gatta go for a bit but thanks for the update. Keep the home fires burnin okay pal? Give Steve my love, I would but Natasha is giving me that face, ya know the stabby one. So yeah in preservation of my more tender parts I should see what that’s about.”
An: infantilism, non-sexual age play, diapers. Cause I can.
Things had gotten a little hot and heavy during the car ride home, god bless poor Happy for rolling up the partition to keep from seeing a little too much.
Steve loathed mentioning it aloud; as if the perfectly natural function was some dirty secret, he leaned in and muttered it low in the alpha’s ear. “..I’m…wet….there’s a lot of slick. Down…there.”
The alphas arms felt so good, like a shelter from the storm as the mans words washed over him. Loki wasn't sure what tomorrow would bring, but right now felt good.
Even if it wasn't with him.
Your strips they captured me, you were in my fridge as far as I could see.
That old hateful whisper that said ‘you’re not good enough’, stirred in his head. Each time tugged his shirt collar to the side to show the slightly pinked gland- it was there to remind him. The gland was still slightly inflamed according to Bruce, but would go down in a few days.
“Don’t worry I can take it from here,” Steve said as soon as they made it into the bathroom, the chill from the tile soaking into his bare feet sending a shiver up his legs. “Thanks.”
“Thanks Tony, really. I … I’m glad it’s you.” Steve said, a bit unsure if the other would find the sentiment odd or not.
“Let me try Virginia.” Phil interjected taking a step toward the door. “Steven, It’s Phil.. Listen I know you thing this is a terrible thing but I can tell you from an omega prospective I think its great. Thing of all the kids out there that look up to you, I know if the truth had been out when I was a child it would have meant even more to me as far as omega empowerment is concerned. Why don’t you open the door and we can all sit down and talk about this. Ok cap?”
Looking back on it now, Barnes felt awful for the argument. Fighting before a mission was always hard; repeatedly the alpha swore he wouldn't do it – promised himself that he'd contain his frustration. He had failed; Loki had this weird ability to always draw it out those snide remarks and cutting stares. Then again, James would be remiss to blame this entirely on his omega, Loki had been teetering on some weird precipice for days of nearly saying everything then saying nothing. Watching as the ravenette missed more work and almost as many meals. All the while James was left to try his best at being supportive but not hovering. Loki hated being treated with kid gloves but it was hard not to when he looked like a strong breeze could carry him away.
“Go back home and just talk to him Steve, but don’t forget to listen to him too. You’re both going to have to learn how to give and take because children are smart little beasts who can smell your weakness and will divide and conquer. Trust me I know that much.” Phil smiled and patted Rogers’ leg again. “You can do this, you both can.”
Steve shivered at the words and the scratch of the alphas facial hair on his skin, “Not a chance,” Tony replied as his hips twisted up in a particularly deep stroke. Steve moaned feeling the beginnings of the alphas knot teasing at his entrance. “Think you can take it honey?”
“Excuse me?”
Right now, Loki was crumbing. True, the former villain had a careful mask in place that most if not everyone would ever stand a chance seeing through. Even as an omega Loki had used his power to create a careful vale of wellness. Yet there were something’s deeper than biology or body language.
The next thing the boys saw, instead of their imminent demise, what a flash of something large and black and then a thick screen of ink as someone grabbed them.
Loki couldn't help but think how well adjusted Kurt had been, not to say it didn't matter to the other man – clearly, Kurt had similar desires as Loki. He just handled it with so much more grace.
“Because I love you.”
“Loki I can't do that, your body temp is too high and given what we know about your resting temperature it could be dangerously high for you. I need you to let me help you, and answer a few questions if you can.”
Loki hadn't been fussing with his hair or tweezing his brows. He wasn't glaring at the mirror or changing into yet another shirt. This wasn’t just a matter of ascetics or a quiet need to be annoying because his alpha did something two or three days ago, that set him off – ‘revenge is best served cold James’.
Loki smiled his blue skin shimmering back to white. “I appreciate your efforts, it may well take a saint to ease my ills I'm afraid.”
Loki would have told his child anything to see that smile, to glean just a fraction of the sparkle in those big bright eyes.
When he really thought about it, who was really that close to Steve though…, .other than him?
“I have faith in you Bruce, now…make it so number one!”
Steve would never be comfortable if he dropped in public. So Tony kept his distance as they drove out of the city. Headed up state past the compound and to the old Stark estate.
Placing down the cup, Loki began wondering how he would handle something like that. If he was strong enough.
A thousand years (WinterFrost)
Bruce: I wonder if it's too early to drink...
Steve shook his head and held out his wrists. “Can you do anything about this? I don’t know what it’s made of but I can’t get out of it.”
“Well I would but this ones personal, an old acquaintance of mine may have gotten herself into some trouble. Ever heard of a pharmaceutical company called AIM?”
“Perhaps, the healers of Asgaurd may be able to quell the chaos in the sergeant’s mind?”
Again- we may turn a blind eye to pain and suffering, saying 'it's not my problem.' Good and Evil is perception.
“You can though Loki, if you ever do want to. I will listen; I want you to know that.”
The ultrasound itself went smoothly, the baby was in good health and right on track. Being the first ultrasound there was not much to see. Bruce also conducted an NT test along with the other measurements just to make sure there wasn't any underline issues.
Their first date was nice, very traditional in idea even if the night had its own “Tony Stark Spin”. Which meant 5-Star dinning and a private table.  Steve was very impressed by the car and the restaurant. Not that he expected anything less from the exuberant alpha. Still, Steve felt out of place in the fancy clothes and high-class eatery. Never in his life would he have imagined to ever even be let into the door at a place like this.
Enemy jeeps swarmed around flanking them, Lower turrents emerged from the base walls to begin long-range barrage attacks and the tanks moved in. This wasn‘t going to be easy. A terrifying thought entered the Captains’ head.
“Howard…”
“You would think so… unfortunately I tend to have a lot of those. Amazing how I bounce back to the man you know and love isn’t it. I am truly remarkable.”
Banner could see the darkness around his friend’s eyes that hollow hungry look. He knew very well what desperation looked like.
“You said you would be upgrading it.” Steve ground out with just barely contained rage.
“This is an underground secret facility Captain, not even all of SHIELD knows about it. Fury runs this place on minimal, meaning along with myself there are four field agents that come and go who I handle personally. There are seven strike force agents or as I like to call them “the muscle brigade.” They are all so terrified of Fury they don’t ask questions.” Coulson said as they entered a room at the end of the hall this one looked to be a room for security footage. The guard on duty was kicked back with his feet on the consol and hat down over his eyes. Well into his 40 winks, such job pride.
Yet Phil had somehow maintained his distance. It wasn't so much out of fear than simply not knowing what to say.
In the next moment, he's standing up and Barnes is calling him an idiot and shouting at him to get down. No, he's not an idiot not now… he was before to think that it would never come to this. Honestly, he should have done this years ago. “Relax Sergeant, go out and play with the other kids, daddy has some work to do.”
Scorpio, like villains’ do - brought reinforcements in the way of a mechanical army. Why did they always have to bring an army…?
"Do not utter such blasphemy. I would alert Mother and have her watch over our child rather than risk Stark exposure." Loki's lip curled in distaste - clearly the feeling was mutual.
“Do what you can for him, I’m leaving.”
A Skull with writhing tentacles.
One reason was the twin’s second trimester growth spurt. At 24 weeks  the omega felt every ache and stretch as his protruding belly now made it self known at all hours of the day and night. The twins constant rolling and kicking was in some ways a comfort and in others an annoyance.
The day he left for Afghanistan for the weapons testing of Jericho he surprised Joanna with flowers. He thought maybe when he got back he would give it an honest go with her, maybe Stane was right. Maybe Pepper was right; he was not like his father not completely. He was not broken.
Honestly, they didn't but it would take the alpha a good hour or twos search at the store. Plus, travel baring any traffic he would be away no less than four hours.
“Papa! I can't get my butterfly right help!” Wendy cried out from the living room.
1. Kings of Leon- Sex on Fire
Steve laughed, getting up with Wendy on his hip. “Alright, that’s enough of that give me my baby Stark .”
‘waiting for the big guy?’  the waitress had said.
Words that came across not nearly as teasing as they usually would have. While they didn’t do everything, what they did do was everything Steve had wanted for so long. It was that connection and comfort that came from long slow kisses. It was burying his nose in his alphas neck and breathing in everything that was so uniquely Tony. They had a love that was playful and curious. Hands and lips that touched and tasted with out fear of rejection. There was no preconceived notions of what was expected, only what felt good.
She was good like that, always taking care of everything...even the hard stuff. Tony just nodded numbly. "I need to be alone."
Steve didn’t need his protection anymore.  Bucky hadn’t been sure how to deal with that. Maybe selfishly…if he admitted it to himself, there were times in the night that he would wish Erskine would have chosen him instead. If he had become a hero and Steve would have stayed at home.  That those sweet blue eyes would still look at him and ask for help.
"Playing dirty Honeybuns."
“You might wanna keep the faceplate on, Nat might try to knife you in the eye. She‘s pretty pissed.” The archer cautioned looking over the top of his shades.
Tony Stark had been another part of this plan. The inventor acted exactly how Fury thought he would. The People had their martyr now they needed a champion. An avenging knight to come out of the flames and ashes… a new soldier. In truth Fury thought it would have been Barnes, however there was an Asgardian complication on that front. The winter soldier was now tangled up with a now ‘repentant’ trickster. And the golden kingdom was smart enough to keep the doors locked on their side to prevent a mad dog assassin from coming to get his pound of flesh.
When Steve arrived at the cabin, Bucky had Wendy on Duchess's back walking the little girl around the yard while she cheered happily. He would have smiled if he weren’t still so leery of the massive creature, though Steve knew Bucky would never let anything happen to Wendy. Still, this was a massive and potentially deadly creature from off world. Even if the beast recognized Bucky and Loki as its pack, accidents could happen. The unknown is a scary thing when you have kids.
“This modified version should act pretty quickly, it might...get messy though. Buck...I, I need you to promise me something ok.”
In addition, it would be easer talking to Steve about this, one Omega to another. ...hopefully.
“Mermaids, right. That’s what they called them in Denmark.” Natasha stood and walked around the room, her voice arrived as they looked at the glass cases as one would peruse fine art. “Half human half fish. Some believe they grant wishes and their tears turn to pearls. Other…others believe they draw sailors to their deaths.” She thought it only kind to indulge their host, perhaps if they took this job it would ease his mind in some way. Having a skilled crew to come back and put the truth before him might be what the old man needed. Natasha saw no harm in that. She wasn't sure if Steve would see it that way .
Steve crowded and pressed the slighter man against the wall, running his fingers along Starks side. He loved the feel of the compact muscle quivering beneath the skin. While Tony lighted things, rough Steve liked to be sweeter. He took a moment to kiss the back of his lovers neck and suck a red mark over the mans pulse point. Breathing in the scent of expensive cologne and Tony’s own natural smell of metal and oil.
This story has 69 bookmarks!...*giggle snort* ...69..  I'm sorry y'all. Your writer is immature as fuck.
Midgard, I've love you.... because of bacon.
Bruce often wondered if Tony understood just how important he was to the team. For a man who had spent his whole life trying to live up his fathers standards, then the media. Sometimes it seemed like Tony didn't really believe in his own worth – despite the bravado. Bruce knew what it was like to feel worthless and he would never wish that on anyone. Thanks to the team the beta had found his place, he found a beautiful Alpha and omega who opened their arms to him. This was his home and Tony and Steve were the pillars of that home. If he could help Steve he would.
“Miss Romanov, how good of you to drop by so wonderfully unannounced. Do come in.”
That’s when it all fell into place, this wasn’t just about him. His supposed death was just a catalyst, it was true that tragedy could bring people together, but it’s what they could do after that Fury was after. It wasn’t the patriotism or joint solidarity, it wasn’t waving flags or donation drives. None of those tame feel good feelings that came with rallies and songs about the good old red white and blue.
“Don’t stress ok doll?”
Tony thought the show of force was incredibly hot and ended up praising Steve in his own special way for the remainder of that evening.
The invitation was a clear and the threat, was... well James was being honest with himself he found the threatening nature of his omega to be a huge turn on. Bedding Loki in a mood was like bedding a wild cat and he was more than happy to walk away with battle wounds like scratches and bite marks. All the better to wear proudly around the tower, maybe make Barton gag a little.
“Sure, I don't mind sweetheart. Anything you need.”
It was then that Steve stood and slammed his palms on the tabletop, “No one is mounting anyone!”
The read outs were all over the place and Tony had a radiating ache spreading across his chest and stomach. “Damn it, porn fish packs a wallop.” he groaned as the armor came to a stop at the bottom of the bay. Not exactly, the best place to be right now with hull integrity compromised.
Bucky smiled and pushed the now open dress back and over Steve’s shoulders, “yeah, but you’re mine. I love you baby, I love how dirty you are for me, how wet you get for me. Is your pussy getting wet for me right now? I bet it is.”
When Steve was able to get up and leave Tony was right there walking next to him as they all packed up for transport to the tower. Then Tony used the meager workshop at the underground Shield post to remove the arm and kill switch.  Steve sat out side watching through a window, he couldn’t see Tony’s eyes for the dark goggles the inventor was wearing. However, he didn’t need to.
Loki approached as if the bundle would turn to flame. “My son?” Amora had not looked about to birth when he had last seen her. So then how, before he could question or analyze however; Thor was filling his arms with a tiny warm body. Loki found himself frozen in place looking down at the baby with red and gold scales. The coloration was a hind of his own bits of gold and similar in pattern, the shape of the long delicate fins was all Amora. The red seemed a more vibrant than the hints in her own mostly olive colored tail.
Loki feels an odd kind of peace in the atmosphere for the first time in ages. He almost wants to cry when Peter walks over and climbs up into his lap during his exam, Wendy has claimed her uncle Bucky for her exam. It’s sweet and comforting despite the longing Loki feels in his heart of the little warm weight in his arms.   Watching the little ones and as a surprise turn of evens – Barton  who Steve and Phil  man handle into being checked out.  Loki never liked going to healers but this was vastly different than Asgard.
“Alright...” As if the agreement was physically painful.
"I'm afraid I can not."
Tony thought it over but something just didn’t feel right, “or something found him…” The visor to the helmet snapped in place and Tony rushed to the nearest elevator prying open the doors and flying up the empty shaft. The closer he got the more the niggling feeling of something horrible tumbled around in his brain.
“Cut the crap Steve you’re a shitty liar. You think Jarvis’s body scans can’t notice hormone levels. Or that he can’t pull up your last Shield physical?”
“Get out...get out…” Loki tries so hard to pour every ounce of malice into the words but all he hears is pleading. Damn her.
Stark stood back watching the short exchange. Pepper set the cup down and Steve gave her a watery smile and word of thanks. She stood back and crossed her arms for a beat of silence.
“You always have a much kinder way seeing life.” Loki said sitting down on the settee across from him.
“Dr. McCoy.” Loki greeted as he made his way through the halls. “I trust the morning biology courses went well.”
Ah, so they were equipment of a healing nature. Thor had become familiar with other such tools of Midgard, such as the ‘band-aid’ and the powerful capsule of healing ‘Excedrin’. Verily humans were puny and easily harmed creatures. However, they made up for their innate weakness with many methods of care.
Years later as Thor stared into a small face he thought he would never see again, hearing the words from his deepest nightmares.
The faint light in Tony’s chest was blazing bright and it bulged beneath the skin of his chest. The young man cried out reaching desperately  for his father.
The few goons who exited the doors on the side of the building didn’t even have time to dispatch into their comrades about the lone soldier before a bullet lodged in their heads.
Tony huffed out a humorless laugh, “You wouldn’t have fought you’re best friend or abandoned our son…you wouldn’t….god Steve I …I killed so many people.” Tony finally raised his dark haunted eyes. “I wanted it, I wanted to kill every single one of the bastard. I wanted to watch the life drain right out of them. What does that make me? How can I even touch our son…knowing what I’ve become?”
Electricity, coal, steam, gas, and any combination of the four left Howard with more questions than answers. More dangers than benefits.
Peter groaned and went cutely limp over his omega, burrowing his face in Steve’s chest with a mumble.”
Steve looked once again to the screens, his heart breaking as he watched his husband act with out mercy. To see a once warm and caring man reduces to the one thing he despised … A merchant of death. “But at what cost”
Now Steve was confused but he bit, “What Stark thing?”
“At a decent hour, color me impressed Sir.”
"I'm going to fill his suit with snakes...non-poisonous if only because of you love."
Stark leaned forward pinching the bridge of his nose, “I’m getting to it. Alright. A few days ago, I received a file from a person who said he worked with my dad on project rebirth. It was your file, and I’m not talking about the one SHIELD had on record. That one was shit and apparently had been altered by my old man from the start.”
Sex on fire indeed.
Tony squared up his shoulders looking around the room. “Yeah, see I thought I had friends… people I could rely on. I see I was mistaken. Jarvis, find me a babysitter.”
Tony stopped him with a kiss before muttering the rest of the words with tears streaming from the corners of his eyes, “ better be more careful.. because I never wanna break your heart.”
Crooning softly he moved up the bed and leaned against the headboard. There was no surprise when the mass of blond seemed to sense him there and moved closer.  “
Her heart broke watching him considering pebble after pebble before tossing them into the silt. She could see the desperation in his eyes because she knew as well as he did. Amora didn’t love him. A mother wants to protect her child and yet she didn’t want to take this away from him. Perhaps she though… Perhaps she was wrong. Perhaps the pretty young siren would find it in her heart to return the love that the young prince was so ready to give her. Perhaps if Amora saw his devotion something in her would change.
“Cruel Stevie…threaten me with poop like that. Truly cruel.”
Loki frowned as he heard the words tumble from the ailing boy’s lips. Suddenly they all clicked into place. The beast was not a beast, and Anthony was not just ill, the life force was being drained from him. The life that only one person could have put there. “Darcy I need you to listen to me, Take Anthony to the surface just past the eastern gate. I need to go.”
No one had even seen the elusive inventor in the last three. There was some talk that the man had finally lost it, even so the government was happy enough to accept designs from a supposed mad man.
Loki sat with tears in his eyes arms wrapped tightly around himself. The wooden sword had hit the small protruding bones of his spine and felt like it rang through his whole body.
They could go forward, or they turn back. So much was riding on his command. There was something in the dark pool something large and angry, something that slapped the surface like a thunderclap.
They would have to talk about it at some point, now with Red Skull and Bucky out here somewhere it would be even more difficult. Steve just hoped he was the one who found Bucky and not Tony. While he trusted the smooth talking Alpha, Steve was a realist - Tony would want to hurt Bucky… of course he would.
“They’ll figure it out eventually, and I don’t want to be the one to lie to Tasha.” Tony smirked hoping to lift the mood, “She’s scary and might choke me with her thighs. Not a horrible death mind you, but I think I have a few more valuable years left.”
“Yup,” Bruce said.
Steve looks up, startled.  “Yes?  Do I know you?”
before Steve leans in.  When he’s just a hair’s breadth away he pauses, and Tony thinks that if he’s gonna call it off he has to do it now, right now, because he’s not gonna get another chance -
“So,” Tony said, sliding his hands down Steve’s sides because wow, he was muscles
“That seems to be a logical conclusion.”
“Or maybe,” says a voice from the staircase, “you had somebody else in your corner.”
“Not in the slightest,” Tony said.
Going to the park involves getting Happy out to do recon and security, and two Avengers in one public place is still enough to get the public pretty amped up, but after a couple of rounds of selfies the crowd disperses.  Morgan’s used to it, anyway, and she barely notices the cameras once she’s on the swings.
“Bruce and Nat.”
“Eh, the past’s not so bad,” Tony said. “Things are simpler.  Not so many channels on TV.  Less traffic.  And there’s this guy whose bed I hang out in sometimes.  So, you know.”
“I get the picture,” Steve says wryly.
.”  Steve sighed and lifted his paper up again.  “And that’s why I can’t change anything.  This world doesn’t need me meddling with it.  It doesn’t need me at all, actually; I’m a trespasser.  I’m just trying to keep my head down.”
“Not at - Tony, why didn’t you talk to me?  To us?”
It’s chaos in the joint: seasoned patrons run for the hidden back exit, Thor urging shocked-looking ladies and too-drunk gents along with the crowd; Clint dives over the bar and grabs the sawed-off shotgun they hide behind the whiskey, and Natasha runs to bar the front door with the heavy oak table they keep nearby for just this purpose.
suited for dealing with the dangers of today’s world,” the man says.  “The dangers he
Odinson brings their drinks and slides back down to the other side of the bar; Steve has a feeling he can still hear them, but he appreciates the show of discretion anyway.
Everybody keeps coming by his room without a good excuse.  Steve knows they want to ask him things but they don’t, and Steve wants to tell them things but he doesn’t, but somehow, for some value of okay, it’s okay.
: he grins when Tony runs his hands up Steve’s abs, he chuckles when Tony sucks a bruise into the spot where his jaw meets his throat, he gasps with wide-eyed pleasure when Tony finally gets a hand down his pants.  Tony’s seen Steve a lot of ways but never like this, and Tony wants to savor every second because people don’t tend to be this blissfully happy in Tony’s presence for long.
Steve is silent.  On the screen showing up-to-the-minute footage, the yelling gets louder.
Banner laughs, and Natasha realizes with a shiver that it sounds more like a growl.  "Nobody can help me," he says.  "But yeah, sure.  I'll talk to him.  Sure."
“Yeah, but these Tom Fords aren’t as waterproof as the price tag would lead you to believe,” Tony says.  “But hey, if you’re busy - ”
“Well, when you put it that way, it admittedly sounds like a pretty bad strategy.”
“Thor left it out on the bar at the tower,” Clint said, looking proud of himself.  “Should we break into it?”
fall on him so they figured he could take it.
“Why not?”
“Wait a second,” Clint said, his jaw dropping, “are you guys
“I think I read about it in the paper.”
“That’s real healthy,” Tony said.
does, and so he’s torn: is it setting a better example to blatantly lie, or to tell your twenty year old mentee about your utter failure to have anything approaching a normal human relationship?
Steve smiled, and Tony tried not to swoon.  “I think it’s pretty obvious, Tony.  Hey, I’m going to grab a drink, do you - ”
“Yeah,” Steve says.  “You and me.  Now.”
Dopey doesn’t reply, because Tony hasn’t given Dopey the ability to hold a conversation.  His drives are all too busy copying every piece of data uploaded to the internet on a sixteen picosecond delay.
Well, he didn’t just wait.  He
“No, not all right.”  Steve takes a step forward.  “Buck, we can - ”
Steve smirked.  “I think we can both agree I have a
“Well, I guess you thought wrong,” Tony says.
“Worth a shot,” Steve says, and Tony hears his motorcycle rev as he comes into view two blocks away.
Stark follows his gaze.  "That guy?" he says, sounding puzzled.
"I don't," Tony says.  "You gonna suck my cock or what, Jesus, Rogers, I don't have all day."
“This thing where you think I’m going to talk to you like I did before?  Not gonna happen,” Steve said.
“Right,” Tony said.  “I can - if you want, I can go.  I just thought I’d - ”
“God, no,” Steve said.
“No, it didn’t.  I don’t communicate with you via the subtleties of bathroom implement placement.  It’s hard enough to communicate with you via totally straightforward conversation.”
“At any rate,” Steve says, pulling on his jacket.  “Well.  Thanks for - for a fun night.  The party, I mean.  It was great.”
“He’ll just have to get used to it,” Steve says.
Steve kindly smothered a smirk.  “Very publicly.”
“So?” Rogers says tensely.
“Could be,” Rogers says.  “You know them?”
“You sure?  It’s not every day that Tony Stark offers to shut up,” Tony says.
“Better him than me,” Steve says agreeably.  He’s not in uniform, just jeans and a t-shirt that have, somehow, stayed perfectly untouched despite the mutant octopus fight, and he’s got the shield on his arm and he looks - well, it’s not relevant, really, Tony decides, no reason to wander down that path, am I right?
of them were suffering as a result of the newest and most exhausting one.  Pepper was sympathetic to his plight, and he’d mostly been able to appease her with photos he snuck of the kids (several of which she had promised to get framed and delivered to the Tower as soon as things were back to normal), but by late in the afternoon even her patience was wearing thin, so Tony went down to the workshop to make a few of the new models that he’d promised to her, oh, three weeks ago.
“Right,” Bruce said, scrambling after him.
"Banner," Barton says, crossing the room.  "
“The lovebirds were blocking the source,” Nick said.
sort of a thing, for a while.  Past tense.”
“No,” Tony said immediately.

"Don't mention it," Steve says, and then all he can think is
EPILOGUE
“It wasn’t my calling,” Tony says.  “You know, I really never thought I’d have kids, never planned on it, planned pretty hard

, we can’t just go around kicking down doors and knocking out bad guys.  I know you’ve got this big grand idea that we’re saving the city, but at the end of the day we’re just six people.  We can’t go up against all the criminals in New York.  We’re crazy to be doing as much as we are.”
Tony raised an eyebrow.  “And?”
“A feast,” Natasha contributed.
Steve, freshly showered and looking like even more of a tightass than usual, cleared his throat.  “Should we really be drinking?”
“You don’t have to be embarrassed,” Tony said.  His voice was quiet and gentle, gentler than Steve could ever remember it being.  “I’m sorry.  I shouldn’t have woken you up.  I just…”  Tony blew out a breath.  “I couldn’t help myself.”
“I’ll get the ropes,” Clint said.
- and Tony, smirking at him over a glass of whiskey.  The gang’s cleared out: Odinson’s serving people down the other end of the bar, Barton’s at the door, and Banner and Romanov have disappeared entirely.  Steve raises an eyebrow at Tony.  “What’re you looking at?”
Steve wasn’t sure what it said about him that he wasn’t even surprised to find Tony there waiting for him.
me for my money.”
So of course, he’s only made it three blocks when it starts to rain.
“We considered the possibility,” Sam said, crossing his arms.
“He,” Steve said, and he paused, because which was worse: lie, or admit that he had no idea?  Tell her that they’d never found Sam’s body, so they assumed he was part of the Decimation but they might have missed him in the madness; that Steve hadn’t started looking for him for hours because he’d spent the time on his knees over Bucky’s ashes.  “It was in the battle,” he’d said finally.
"You'd be surprised," Stark says.  He throws back the rest of his drink.  "Just be careful, Rogers.  Wouldn't want a nice kid like you to get caught up in something ugly."
“You scare me, and I love you,” Tony said.  “See you Friday?”
"Fuck," growls Clint. To punctuate it, he bites down on the tendon between her neck and shoulder, worrying the tender flesh there as he slides a hand around her to press her lips open, finding her clit.
“What must be tough?”
"You think this is funny?” Steve snaps, and Bruce looks up in surprise.  “This isn’t funny.  I’m
"Wait," Steve says, trying not to sound desperate.  "I'm not here to make trouble - "

"I was," Tony says.  "Heading back tonight."
“I’m afraid not,” Strange says with a patient smile.
instead of her.
“Hey,” Steve gasps, and he pulls on Tony’s hair.  “C’mere, I need - ”
“I guess I’m honored?” Steve said, pulling back, and shit, did Tony say that out loud?
“This is awesome.”  Steve inspects the drawing as closely as if it were a prized work of art.  “Looks like you used every color in the box.”
?  You think I had time to take down a mission report?  I’ve been babysitting!”
“What?”
stuff.  Look, I tell you - I tell you
“It’s definitely not contagious, you just love the sound of your own voice,” Steve said, kissing him again.
While this did have the intended effect of getting the team out of their rooms, it also had the unfortunate byproduct of creating a scuffle at the table as each of them tried their damndest
“Captain Rogers is on his way,” Friday interrupts smoothly.
“Nothing,” Steve said, and smiled.
The doors open with a gentle
Tony followed him inside.  “Oh.  I didn’t know.”
Tony finds a house that once belonged to a hobby welder. Steve arrives on his motorcycle four hours of stop-and-go traffic later and finds the house with the kicked-in door and the welding sizzle coming from the backyard.
Steve raises his eyebrows.  “Because that’s what friends do?”
“Welcome home, boss,” Friday says.  “You’ve got one outstanding alert since you left.”
at them, but hey, you couldn’t argue with results.

"Ease up, Barton, he's with me."
“I was actually talking about the winery,” Steve said, waving a hand at the manor behind him.  “But if you wanted to get into a who’s who of hiding things - ”
“What?  Come on, Steve, tell me - ”
“So,” Strange says, settling himself across from Tony.
“Right, sure, normal answer.  But I mean, do you brush your teeth on the go, do you brush them at work, do you - ”
“Yeah, can I get a glass of scotch?  South Dakota’s finest.”  Tony smiles at the bartender, and after an extended bout of blinking he scurries away.  “You know Hawaii exists, right?”
"What were you doing on the west coast?" Steve asks.
“I’d be happy to,” Steve says.  “It might be nice to get out of the city, in fact.  If I’m invited, that is.”
“I hope not,” Bruce said.  “I wouldn’t want a dentist to drill into them.  I think they might be radioactive.”
“Well, there’s no accounting for taste,” Steve agreed.  “But seriously.  Put on a red hat and throw a sack over your shoulder and you’re old St. Nick himself.”
Steve grabs his hat and hurries to follow them.  He glances at Miss Hill on his way out, and she stares back at him, wide-eyed.
“We could’ve handled it without any of you,” Clint scoffs.
"Not anything you learned about in the Army, soldier boy," Stark says.  "It's a prototype.  Experimental."
The Santa Claus stared at him blankly.  Presumably standard Mall Santa training did not cover what to do if a national icon asked to sit on your lap.
“We’re actually living in a branched timeline off the first one.  The one you saw.”
“Not unless you told Spiderman,” Scott said.  “Which I really hope you didn’t, that’d be weird, isn’t he technically a minor?”
“Guys,” Tony said.  “Come on.  I was a teenager once.  I get it.  It’s fine.  Nobody’s in trouble.  Just hand it over.”
“I’d rather not keep these around any longer than we need to.”
Steve sighed.  He seemed… annoyed.  Upset?  Constipated?  Tony was still learning to read him.  He was like a big beautiful blonde book written in another language.  “You know, Tony, I didn’t come down to your lab today because I didn’t want to help with Thanksgiving dinner.”
“We?” Steve said archly.
“We’re not here to make a deal, Stark,” Pierce says.
“And that’s
“So if someone had a toothbrush somewhere, that would imply they lived there, correct?”
“I want to have friends,” Steve said.  “And Peggy deserves to have friends.”
Steve glances around, then ducks into the car.  Sitwell slams the door behind him, and the tires squeal as the driver pulls away from the curb.
“Doesn’t sound like nothing.”
"At one of Tony's parties?" says Natasha. "Every bedroom on the first floor will have long since been occupied. We're going somewhere a little more private."
to disappear either.
idiot.
“You were an okay CEO, from what I’ve heard.”
“Uh,” Tony said.  “So - ”
“All right, all right,” Steve said, swallowing a grin.
Steve opened his eyes.  “Tony?”
“What’s a smell?” Clint said.
“It’s perfect,” Steve says, in that irritating, uncomfortably genuine way he has, and Tony busies himself with finishing an entire glass of scotch so he doesn’t have to make eye contact.
aren’t doing anything,” Steve says.  “This has gotten even messier than we thought it would.  I need to keep my head down, just do my job and not give Pierce any reason pay me any attention.”
“This is one of the top eight worst things that has ever happened to me,” Steve said.
“I run a bar,” Natasha says.  “I’m used to cleaning up after people.”
“Yeah, man, bullet dodged on that one,” Clint said.  “Thor?  Want to give it a shot?”
“Even though those years were shitty for a lot of people,” Tony says, and he hears his voice getting louder.  “Even though, arguably, we
“Liar,” Tony says, flopping down on the couch.  “What’s up, Capsicle?  Decided to drop by and cast aspersions on my ability to feed my daughter?”
“Yeah, and we don’t know what’s going to happen when you get there.”
Because that’s what the magic explosion had done: it had turned all of his friends into
“Not everything is about you, Tony,” Steve adds.
“No, but you could make your own,” Tony says.
“You don’t have to - ”
They found out that the Hulk had indeed joined Bruce for the ride, and that he was brought out not by rage but by excruciating embarrassment, which Tony discovered when he accidentally walked in on Bruce taking advantage of the internet in the way teenage boys always have and always will.  Luckily, the teenaged Hulk didn’t try to smash anything; unluckily, in his attempts to hide in the closet, he knocked down two doors and severely dented a load-bearing wall.
“Oh good, everyone’s here,” Tony said wearily, beginning the long, torturous walk to Natasha’s bedroom door.  When he reached it, his hand hovered over the door, weighing his options.  “Natasha?  Thor?  Are you in there?”
"Adrenaline increasing," Tony says.
“I’m all right, thanks,” Steve says, shaking his head and heading toward Broadway.
you guys, you’re not
“Probably gonna have to put that one back on the shelf for a while.”
"I would," Steve says.  "And what you did, in his service - what was done to you - it's not as important as the decisions you make.
.  This is about
“Way ahead of you,” Stark says, climbing into the driver’s seat.  Natasha throws the bags into the back and crawls into the front seat next to Thor.

“Are you serious right now?” Steve said disbelievingly.  “Like,
“Yessss,” Peter says, flipping off the wall and taking the beer.
“Sir,” JARVIS said.  “You - ”
"Eh, they're overdue," Clint said, and popped a bottle of champagne.  "They can skip the countdown."
“Sure thing, boss.”
There wasn’t any margarita mix, but by the time Tony showed up there
Steve laughs, and it doesn’t make anything better, really, Tony thinks as Sam offers him pizza and Barnes grabs him a beer, but it doesn’t hurt, either.
But with a clang, the doors slide shut.
Steve sighed and dropped his head back, stared up at the ceiling.  There was a water stain in the corner.  “I guess it makes sense that you’d come back now.”  He chuckled.  “At least I have my hallucinations to keep me company.”
“Yeah, but saying things I shouldn’t have said is kind of my thing,” Tony says.  “If I stopped, what would I be known for?”  Tony pauses long enough for Steve to roll his eyes, and then continues, “So, you planning to hit the road again?”
Steve runs a hand over the shield.  “You can’t just make us all weapons, Stark.”
Steve glances over his shoulder, then looks back at the bartender.  "You been working here long?"
“Don’t worry, Agent Rogers, you won’t report to me,” Miss Hill says with a wink.
“Jarvis has seen everything before,” Tony says.  “And then some.”
“I’ve been thinking about that myself,” Steve says.  “And nobody’s said a word at the bureau - they told the office that Pierce decided to retire, and he was replaced the next day with some guy outta Washington.  A couple of the other fellas disappeared too, including Sitwell - the official word is they’ve been transferred, but some of the other agents are suspicious.”
“I do,” Coulson said.
"Prove it," Natasha says, just to goad him, and is rewarded with a hand in the hair at the nape of her neck, the silvery sound of a zipper, and finally a long slow thick slide, pressing inside of her. She groans in satisfaction and relief as he begins to stroke her, tugging her into an arched pose by the hair.
“I don’t see how that’s a party,” Natasha says, nodding up at the pounding footsteps.
“Making out?” Clint said with a shit-eating grin.
“To be the only person in the world to blame for half the universe disappearing,” Tony says.
“You weren’t
“I’ll take a beer, actually,” Steve says, and pulls the cap off with his bare hands like a show-off.  “I didn’t think tonight was going to turn into a party.”
"I think you might know somebody I used to know," Steve says quietly.  "Somebody I'm looking for."
By the time Tony joins him, Steve’s already on his second cigarette.
Somebody has apparently gotten tired of eating pizza at team meetings - “That’s what happens when you let Steve order dinner every time, folks, the man has the metabolism of a fourteen year old boy” - and the kitchen is full of nothing but salads, so ultimately everybody is grateful for the store-bought cookies from May.  Peter’s telling Tony a story about his astrophysics professor and his complete misunderstanding of the relationship between propulsion and distance in space but he can’t say
, Tony, so can we talk about whatever it
“Takes one to know one,” Steve says.  He leans back on the bench and looks up at the skyline.  “This is nice.”
“Hadn’t even considered it,” Steve said, like butter wouldn’t melt in his mouth even if he
“Hey,” he says.
Pierce chuckles.  “It was bad enough when you wouldn’t pay your dues, sweetheart, but this business you’ve been up to with Rogers - you had to know that wasn’t going to end well.”
“I think people are looking at us,” Bruce whispered to Tony.
“What are you doing?” Steve says.
“Look, once I realized the calls were coming from inside the house, I wanted to deal with it myself,” Tony says.  “No reason for any of the rest of you to get mixed up with this, especially you, we need you to keep your nose clean, all right?  This guy is my business, it’s my people, I don’t need you to see the dark underbelly of everything I’ve ever done.”
have his head in the game: the opposing team's runs had been limited not because Steve was pitching a strong game but by dint of his being the actual peak of human perfection.  He was throwing balls left and right, literally, but luckily even blindfolded Steve probably could have pitched a better game than half the MLB, which was probably why he was preemptively banned from three out of four professional sports leagues in North America.  (The NHL kind of seemed to hope he'd enter the draft one day, just for the ratings).
“I mean, you
Bruce beams.
Steve’s eyes widen.  “Is that - ”
“I don’t think you know me as well as you think you do, Tony,” Steve interrupted, smirking, and Tony felt his jaw drop, because if he hadn’t known better he would have thought Steve was
“Prosecco?” Tony offered helpfully.
Stark’s eyes slide toward the clockwork man, and Steve follows his gaze, thinking of the armband that blew a hole in the wall the other night at the Black Widow.
“They - ”
“I wasn’t really planning on it.”
The funny thing about running a gin joint that caters to people who don’t want to be found, Natasha reflects, is how many people there end up finding something.
“Tough crowd.  Look, I just want to say, it wasn’t anything, all right?  With Nicola, I mean,” Tony says, and damn, when did he stop being smooth?  He was famous for it, there were articles in Esquire about his legendary smoothness, for chrissakes.  “It was - stupid, and I didn’t think, with you, you’d said - it wasn’t a thing, is what I’m saying.  It’s not a thing.  There is no thing.”
But Steve’s actually
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
“Because he thinks he’s responsible for fucking
Steve tossed the one he was holding in Tony’s direction.  “Tony’s not comfortable with nudity,” he whispered conspiratorially to Clint and Natasha.
"You're useful without the Hulk," Tony says.
“Well, they’re still working on plastics in 1956.”
“Just Morgan, huh?”
“What is it?” he asks.
"I don't work for those people anymore," Banner says slowly.  "And if your friend still does, he'd probably be better off if he
Steve runs a hand through his hair.  “That could have gone better.”
“Jeez, I can’t wait until I can see him too,” Peter said.  “I have so much to tell him.  Wait, has he been, like, watching over us?”
“I just,” Tony said, as the countdown started flashing out of the corner of Steve’s eye, but Steve wasn’t looking, because all he wanted to look at was Tony, “yeah, if it doesn’t work, I just want to say - ”
“Yeah, that’s fair.”
Tony pinched the bridge of his nose.  “Can we not - ”
Tony noticed the toothbrush on a Wednesday, and that was when everything went to hell.
"I don't think he's dead," Steve says.  "I think he got mixed up in something he shouldn't have, and I think - I think he may still be out there working for some really bad people.  People that you may have worked for too."
“Yeah, anytime,” Tony says.
“I told you I love nachos,” Steve said unapologetically as Natasha built their third plate’s worth of them.
Bruce shakes his head as if to clear it, takes a deep, calming breath.  He's going pink again.  "I know that wasn't easy," he says.  "Thank you."
,” Steve hissed.  He grabbed Tony’s shoulders and spun them a quarter-turn.  “Pretend you’re looking at me.  Look over my shoulder.  Are you looking?”
“I’m just saying Steve won’t want to do it, plus this guy- Howard Stark, he sounds like a crazy old coot. He’s looking for monster hunters. How exactly do we get paid doin that?”
The omega tried to move away from the comforting touch. “Leave me...just leave me...”
The three leggy beauties in fitted yoga pants and high heels, Steve finally understood what Clint had been saying about the glory of women’s stretch pants and apparently they made them for me…or Loki was wearing some of Natasha’s who knew right now. The blonde stood completely flustered at the door not sure where to look or not look. Until he managed to stutter out an apology and run away.
Tony stepped back, his hackles ready to rise at the harsh words, yet they didn’t when he noticed the flush on the omegas face and pale ring around his lips. Steve did not look good at all and that wasn’t right. Tony could be mad later but right now there were more important things to worry about. “You’re right I haven’t Steve, but that doesn’t mean I don’t care, or that we won‘t when we can. You know that.  Now will you just sit down and let me call medical out here, or hell just let me take you? I know you don’t like it, neither do I but right now you’re freaking me out ok.”
The older mer growled, “Your name means more than you realize! I told you not to worry what naysayer’s may whisper because I wanted you to have courage and confidence. I know that I never told you to throw everything away frivolously! You are a prince! You are the eldest and only grandson of the king!”
Loki worked for days forging the gem until it shined a brilliant blue that rivaled Aroma’s own eyes. It glittered as if a star plucked from the sky and seemed to almost vibrate in his hands. It was perfectly round and the magic swirled and danced under the smooth nearly translucent surface.
Steve had been puttering around the penthouse for two whole days, cleaning and acquiring everything in order for when his alpha came home. As for his alpha, Tony was currently out-of-town for Stark Industry business. Normally, Pepper would go to these sorts of things but since she was on maternity leave Tony had been force to step out in the name of his company.
Loki stared back with glassy eyes. “What do you want from me?”
“He’s going to ask me Steve and I’m not going to lie.”
Steve felt a little better having someone to commiserate with in times like this. Plus, Natasha was in the office watching the video feed from the Shield Jet and staying on coms with Clint and Phil. She would know if something happened. The omega tried to take a deep breath, nothing was going to happen. Bucky was there, Phil, Clint, and the Shield team. Tony was capable; this would be a milk run and his alpha would be back in their bed tonight. Tony would be there to tuck in Peter and Wendy, to tell them stories with the voices.
“Maybe it did, guess I have a soft spot of a handy fella.”
Well, you had me from "Bacon"
Tony looked up dropping the grease-smudged hands that he’d been sheltering behind. “I do want him Pep and that’s the problem, I want him so damn much that feel like I’m losing my mind. I just don’t want to hurt him, what if it gets out? What if people see us out together and you know they will. Then he’s plastered all over every tabloid rag in the country with alpha/alpha speculations flying. Then what if people find out his nature? Do you know what that would do to him? That would be my fault.”
“No. no it isn't'” Hank agreed, considering his own external appearance he'd had his fair share of hate. “I would have to agree with Bruce. The mental instability and emotional turmoil may be what is acting as a natural contraceptive. Despite Loki going into heat more frequently that what a human omega would – which could be due to hormonal fluctuation or the social environment it self. His system is confused because it's receiving two different signals.”
“I was speaking with Kurt during our visit; he brought up some interesting points that I hadn't considered.”
Barnes seemed to consider this unbuttoning the dress further. “Oh is see, my little girl is being dirty for me. These pretty panties on, you’re a dirty girl aren’t ya Stevie.”
The firm touches over each muscle, combined with the reverence of each lingering kiss, left Steve tranquil. Tony's hand move slowly lower and lower. Then teasing across his groin. The omega spread his legs wider, encouraging his to explore. To reclaim familiar territory with every touch.
How dare she...how dare she toy with him. “Stop playing your games agent. They call me silver tongue but even I would be hard pressed to fake care for a being I detest. You may feel some obligation to James- but do not sit here and pretend you've come under some altruistic mission for my sake. Do. Not. Insult me.”
The world still believed that James Buchanan Barnes died during the war, died a hero. Maybe that was true.
Silence fell over the parlor as all eyes fell on the sophisticated mechanics of the shining appendage.
Coulson and Simmons came running across the fields outing orders. Tony also noticed Bruce coming off behind them. Banner maneuvered around them to Tony.
Fury nods and looks over photocopies of documents recalling the incident, “So, mama’s little boy grew up bitter, hated everything the government stood for and then some.”
After training the alphas parted ways. James considered the gym showers, but something was pulling him toward the elevator.
It would be ok, this was ok, and he told himself feeling his body sinking into the cushions. He was so tired, so very tired with all of this.
The two of them still had separate floors, and had only spent a handful of night’s together doing nothing more than taking solace in each others presence. During the day, Tony would still sequester himself in the workshop; however, now Steve had a pass code to enter the engineers’ inner sanctum. Most times the soldier would take residence on the corner sofa or old broken down armchair. Spending the hours Tony worked, sketching the bots or something from memory. It became grounding and comfortable for the two of them just to be with in close proximity to the other. They didn’t really go out on dates, unless Pizza in bed was a date. Tony might have said that it was.
Steve woke up to the sound of voices entering the penthouse. He recognized them immediately as Natasha and Bruce, the third voice made his heart ache…Peter.
The Professor took the chilled beverage with thanks. Sipping the sweet coolness in appreciation. “My that is good. As for the Buddha, ha, I think not. In all my year I have yet to reach true enlightenment.”
They had this arrangement now, anytime. Anywhere. The thrill of almost being caught, of having this secrete from the world. This dirty, decedent, secret.
However, not all the world cared for the young prince as much as his father. Not all faces smiled and not all eyes shined with hope and happiness.
Thor had brought quite the collection for Bruce and the rest of the science gang: Hank, Jemma and Fitz pour over. Apparently, it had taken quite a while for them to be compiled. The heavy books and scrolls covered at least two tables, along with what they already had, Thor had people back home seeking accurate information. However, the thunderer did confess there where not many who would help Loki, despite the royal family efforts to redeem him in the eyes of Asgard. Some would never be able to forgive and forget all of the silver tongues past misdeeds, or his heritage.
Omegas and their primping, he sighed,   it was a wonder they made it anywhere on time. Loki had enough hair care products in their bathroom to stock a small salon.
“Her forces are using the Code name Viper, however, from facial recognition we have been able to match her with this woman.”
Frigga wanted to believe that, in truth she had not loved Odin when they began to court. It was an arrangement between their families, but with time… with time, she adored him.
He thought back to his omegas words before he left. “If you die...I'll burn the world.” That's a hell of a lot of pressure to put on a person. However, James knew better, Loki wasn't talking about the whole world...just his. What he was really saying was. 'If you die. It would kill me.'
Sweet Mother Mary… There’s no way I can work like this!
This however, he could not deal with.
He feels his heart beat quicken and sweat prickle over the back of his neck. “No I need J, I made him to help me. He’s …he’s always been there. I need Steve, I Love him. I love the kids. The team. I need them.”
“Steve, I’m on my way. I need you to let me know you can hear me.” Tony said waving a hand and manipulating the image floating in the air. The holograph security feed followed him through the penthouse. The alpha didn’t even bother dressing as he ran to the elevator in little more than boxers and an old tank top.
“Yes Sir, I just have to put some clean straw in the hen house and…”
Life has a funny way of lulling you into a false sense of security. Right when you think, things are looking up- something or someone has to come along and jerk the rug right out from under your feet.  One moment the world is a safe and sunny place and then the rain clouds come rolling in and every inch of clear blue turns black, the wind picks up and sirens wail. Safety is only ever an illusion, a promise given to foolishly soothe those who are even bigger fools to believe it. Maybe that was a pessimistic way to view things but after you had lived through all the muck and mire you started to realize that indeed, the glass was half empty. The trick was being ok with that, cherishing that last little bit for every drop. Case with one call it could all go tits up in a second.
“I should make you do all the work, just lay here and let my superior genetics be taken like ripe apples from the tree of life.”
, were not just empty words for neither him nor some flowered sentiment that his mother stitched into pillows.
“Tony?”
She didn't say anything, thinking about her conversation with Bucky. The way he was so sure Loki had been into see Bruce. The omega had lied, but was it a malicious lie or something else? It wouldn't be hard to imagine that Loki would be nervous about being around Bruce despite every effort Banner had made since the ravens return to earth.
Loki sighed gathering his magic in his hands and holding them over his son’s chest. “He’s delirious Darcy, as soon as he is well enough I will take you both to safety. For now, we are in the safest place possible. Asgard forces will not allow the beast to breach further than it already has.” He tried to comfort the young ones, though honestly he was not sure if he believed his own words.
Steve looked up from his book and smiled, he knew Bucky was coming by today and he’d been so nervous. Tony had paced around and then scented him aggressively…followed by a round of Stark classic self-loathing for ‘being a typical knothead’, Steve thought it was oddly amusing.
“That’s it, not too fast.”
Phil had noticed right away as observant as he was. He had seen Loki have an 'episode' at the tower on several occasions and when the man stopped( the children blissfully unaware) and trembled with glazed eyes – Phil recognized what was happening.
Steve smiled and reached down to help haul the slighter man to his feet. His hand not letting go immediately, unsure what to say or if there even was anything to say.
Thankfully, this wasn't that kind of job. Or at least the men in the snappy suits said it wasn’t.
A little, raven haired girl with cool blue gray eyes, or a boy with messy brown hair. His heart even faltered when he considered a tiny baby in a car seat with soft robin’s egg skin and glittering ruby orbs.  It was painful to know that he would even want that, he would gladly take that. Years ago, he would have rather choked to death on his own blood than admit parentage to such a child....but now.
Kurt only laughed. “You forget my friend. I have seen you teaching. You are like my Logan, so gruff but a kitten.”This provoked a snort from the other man.
When Colonel Rhodes woke up he was laying alone in a field. Tony’s AI speaking through the remaining systems that War Machine currently had intact.
Tony pinched his lips tight to swallow down the laughter threaten to claw its way to the top. “Look up the definition of upgrade Spangles. In Fact, J care to help me out here?”
“Hmm. Yep, adorable.”
People were eating it up.
Right about now Tony wanted to have a handle on someone’s neck for not sharing need-to-know information. For all he knew this Madam could be beefing up security. That was something he definitely did not need to waste time on right now.
“I am hungry.” Steve conceded
“Ha, yeah I doubt it’s nothing I couldn’t throw together in an afternoon while watching spoongebob. What about you cupid?”
If there was one thing Tony was learning to value these days, it was family.
Steve felt his heart spike and Tony’s hand tightening on his. “What’s wrong?” The alpha asked before Steve could even get the words out.
The thought sunk in and swam around in his brain and through his veins. His Alpha.
Omega STEVE! Alpha Tony  your welcome internet.
“Drink your water.” Phil interrupted notice the tremors beginning to return at the memory.
Pepper smiled and wrapped an arm behind him, “You leave that to me. When your ready we will have the best PR team on hand to handle it. Until then, nothing changes.”
She imparted so many lessons in those last days. Between the fever and the cough, she touched his face and spoke the words she knew he'd need one day. Even just the simple ones.
That was when she met Alexander Pierce and his two sons Brock and Grant. Maybe it was Alexander’s way of speaking or his charm, maybe it was because he knew of loss. Alexander had been married twice before, to a young woman named Elaine Rumlow first. She had died early in their marriage from illness. Then Jaclyn Ward, she passed after a riding accident. Leaving Alexander with two young boys and no woman at home to care for them. Sarah felt bad for him, he seemed so charming and kind. It wasn't surprising that she fell for him.
“Hello Tasha, it’s good to see you.”
Right that meant Steve watched him go down and not come back up, Steve watched him plummet into the water…the one thing that Tony knew his omega had nightmares about was drowning.
"Stark do i really have to.."
Beware my sketchy science! As for how my Omegaverse works, its a lot like most in that trope. I subscribe to this physical representation!
“Feeling a little hot under the spandex pretty baby. I could help you out with that.” He’s pressed up against me and damn it if I can feel my face burning.
The twins burst out of the elevator as soon as the doors opened wide enough for them to force their little bodies through the gap. Steve had frankly given up on stopping them at this point. After all he had survived the great depression with copious ailments and little to no medical care. So yeah, Peter and Wendy ran around in pull ups and shirts (if he was lucky the shirt was more or less optional when your babies are little streakers – too much like their father), tended to eat stuff they dropped on the floor, and for a while there – licked random surfaces and screamed ‘mine’.
This wasn't Bravado whatever this was, whoever this was...they believed every word. This man; if it was still a man, held himself like a would be god high on the mountain top. Untouchable and unapologetic over the prone figures of his subjects. There was a coldness that sent a shiver through the soldiers spine. He had seen men like that, men like Johann Schmidt and Alexander Pierce.
Phil had briefed her on the underground Shield operation and if Widow was surprised she didn’t show it.
“Hey punk.”
“Oh Stevie you scandalous little slut. .I love it. Imagine the vanity fair article!” The alpha then proceeded to bounce up onto his knees and put on a horrible high fake voice “ Mister Stark, how do you keep going? Saving the world, crafting revolutionary tech and just being the hansom devil you are?” He then turned and stroked fingers through his hair and put on a suave smirk, “Well Debbie, I suck off Captain America first thing every morning. A double shot of that all American Freedom spunk and I’m ready to face the day.”
When Steve opened his eyes he was on his knees in a little room off the master bedroom, he was shaking and muttering things that made no sense. None of this made any sense. Steve had given up 70 years of his life to end Schmitts plans, good men died in that war, Bucky had become…a monster.  A monster that killed so many people. What was it all for if hydra had come back and even regained there most powerful leader?
Everyone in the town thought Howard had lost his mind. That his son had died in the night and in a fit of madness and distress, Howard had taken the boy’s body out to sea and perhaps dropped the baby’s corpse over board. In their little sea side town burial at sea was common. Maria had been lowered into the waves not a few days before. It was possible that Howard could not handle another loss and that was where the story of Tony being captured by a siren had come from. Maybe it was just easier...just kinder than the truth.
If it was only just one thing, but it wasn't, was it? This shit pile they had some how managed to drown in was a whole lot worse than just one thing. The fact they never talked anymore, all the fights and petty arguments had been cropping up because it was too hard to sit down and find out what was really the matter. How many times had he just signed up for an op to be away for a few days? How many times had Loki volunteered to take some students out for a weekend retreat into nature?
Unfortunately, he had other obligations that could mean life and death, not only for him, but for the world at large. Barnes had promised to keep an eye out for Stark and looked like he was about to make good on that, if the reports from SHIELD were anything to go by. The late night call had only confirmed the worst – Mallen had made a play and was able to shake the agents tailing him and his lackeys. A group of terrorists in the wind was never what you wanted to have on your hands. Of course no one had been able to station a group at AIM. Barnes wanted to kick himself for not going rouge on that one. They knew where Mallen was headed but still Fury insisted they would scoop up the threat after Mallen had obtained whatever he was trying to get from the pharmaceutical company. 'Two birds – one stone', yeah they see how well that worked.
“Holy shit…” Stark mutter slapping both of his cheeks, “Alright alight I’m up let’s do this. Stevie honey, sugar, muffin how ya doing over there?”
I never even had a chance you know?
“Oh Steve I’m sorry!” She backtracked when Steve leaned forward with his face in his hands mumbling something about hormones and damn Stark.
“Nu-huh, my bear isn't real he’s just fluffs, and fluffs don't eat.” Peter said confidently nodding his little head.
Steve knew what Phil was doing, he was watching the soldiers. Putting them at ease and then seeing how eager they were to make a good impression. The agent was testing them, formulating his next move. Let it not be said that Phil Coulson isn’t a dangerous man.
Tony  frowned. “Say it, tell me what I said.” Steve wasn’t wrong about the rest of it, but anyone who knew him could have guessed something like that.
She snarled, her features twisting into something grotesque and hate filled. “I desire what I deserve! If you do not want it, then hack off its tail and feed it to the sharks for all I care! I can give you heirs Thor! I can give you everything!”
One day he’d honor his mother’s memory and be someone she would be proud of.
“Then get the hell out of my tower!” Tony shouted, vengeful began to form around him and Bruce took a step back.
“Negatory old man, me and you have some things to talk about.”
“Steve… hey… sweets come here. Steve look at me.”
“I’m a little disappointed that it’s this easy.” Steve had to be honest, he was a super solider and aside from thick walls and doors, they were not exactly proactive in their handling of him as a prisoner.
“Well don’t worry, I can fix anything.”
He’s smiling, maybe he’ll just crack a few jokes and leave.  Oh Christ almighty why is so close to me…
The result of Starks blood, sweat and tears - ‘Vengeful- I.’ Sleek and black, the finger sculpts had been elongated into claws and reinforced. The gauntlets could not only blast through feet of concrete but could now shred feet of steel like butter. Tony got some satisfaction with that, he wanted to find the man responsible and gut the sorry sack of shit like a fish. Vengeful was faster and quieter than any other armor before it. A beautiful Valkyrie of death, it was almost poetic in the lines of the body. Like futuristic muscle car meshed with a bullet. The most telling feature was a shatterproof glass casing to the right of the reactor on Vengefuls’ chest plate. Beneath the glass shone a very special piece of metal - Steve’s dog tag.
“Tony!” The specter shouted his name and came walking out of the quinjet. Approaching him with the shield over one arm and gloved hand raise. “Tony Listen to me, I know what this looks like, but just listen.”
The walk back from the village took some time, making the way on foot wasn’t easy for him. Steve had to stop along the way to catch his breath, his narrow chest rattling with each too deep breath. The last thing he needed was to be late making supper because his lungs refused to cooperate.
“Now you listen to me, you are still Captain America, you are still Steve Rogers. You are everything you were before we all knew and will continue to be.  I know things back when you grew up were…less that welcoming to our nature. In some ways, there are still stupid knot heads in the world who will always believe that we can’t do as much or that our biology makes us crazy. The fact is though its not true, do you know the kind of strength it takes to care for others?”
“In position.” he spoke quietly, crouching behind a shipping container – the heat from the metal soaking in past the layers of Kevlar to warm his skin. Taking a look around the large unit’s edge, he could spot the movement of shadows in through the warehouse's grime covered windows. Two guards patrolling the west hall, neither man making chitchat as they marched dutifully, back and forth passing the windows. Once the distraction was in place both men would likely exit through a side door 20 feet ahead of the window. This would take away the blind spot given to him by the container should they glance to the gate.
Loki did not mind what a child might struggle with. James felt similarly, stating he managed to help keep Steve alive for years.
Bruce nodded motioning to the holographs and bringing forward a image of an old medical chart. “Wrong, is a relative term here? You only had one heat and were diagnosed with something they used to call ‘failure to nature’. That was before so much more research went into the reproductive cycles of omega. A lot of old ‘disorders’ we’re thrown out in the 60’s and 70’s.”
Natasha Squirrel on steak out.
Steve still went in the gym to work off excess energy and did his morning laps in the park. Only now, when he came home Tony would be waiting in the common room with a bottle of water and some flirtatious comments regarding  the Captains’ sweat soaked shirt.
“Right ok, you look you need ice chips …or Prozac, prolly ice. I’ll just go do that. Hang in there champ.” Tony disappeared from the room in a flurry of hand gestures.
Save people.
The trio greeted each other before Natasha was able to slip off for a proper shower, finally able to get out of her gear and into some lounge pants – Tony's, a sweatshirt,- Steve's, and socks – Bruce's.
Phil climbed out and raised his hand in greeting, his passenger exited the other side keeping his head down. His stature, the way he held his shoulders, it couldn’t. Then again, there stood Phil Coulson so why not.
He'd been divested of his power, left blind and cripple...all in the name of a family he once loathed and a world he once tried to rule. It was almost humorous if it had not hurt as much as it did. Perhaps this was some cosmic joke that the once feared god of Mischief would be brought to heel as little more than a mortal himself. All because he had to do the stupid thing and be noble for once in his miserable life. Loki had finally made the right choice, not because it was easy or it would win him, praise or acclaim...but because he wanted someone else to live. Who knew honor was so...painful. Who knew there was a limit to the divine power of a once godlike being? Or a monster that he had come to believe himself to be.
The Alpha looked like he'd just been electrocuted. “What?” please no. No NO! Please if there is a God, Loki, and Thor...Thor's dad..Someone up there better be listening!!!!!
"I learned from the best." He smirks planting a gentle kiss on the brunettes chin.
“You met him that night, well... he tried to meet you but you were with me.” She trailed off “Anyway, he seemed to take it pretty personal and has this weird obsession with his company, the company I work for- AIM somehow surpassing Stark Industries even though we are in completely different fields. I think...Tony I think he's talking to some very bad people.”
All those pathetic feelings of not playing god and not crossing that invisible line of what was too much. How foolish, nothing was too much! The world needed progress it and sometimes you had to burn away all the old to rebuild the new.
“Tony.. Ya know, if you don’t want to…” Steve started but was cit short by a strawberry pushed between his lips.
Admittedly, Steve had taken some time to get used to the 'new' Tony. As might be expected Tony had made many strides recently in managing the ill effects of Extremis on his personality and mind. The couple was less anxious about Stark one day going off the deep end and becoming a super villain.
They had been his friends, his family- alternatively, as Pepper is so fond of saying
The soldier paused looking over his shoulder before ducking into an empty barracks room.” Matter-of-fact I have, take this to Fury Stark. Whatever your friends stepped in - trust me when I say it’s not just  a little shit.”
“When the fires are surrounding you and the whole wide worlds coming after you”
The king of self loathing and accepting the blame.
“No you don’t, Bruce said that until my water breaks everything’s fine, we can just wait it out.”
He kissed the back of the omegas head and held a hand over Steve’s heart, feeling the rhythm starting to return to normal. “Ok, just sleep, I’ll clean us up in a bit.”
Tony had done so well, until he sat on their bed, until that damn urge couldn’t be quelled and he reached out and grabbed Steve’s Pillow. Tony pressed his face into the cotton and could still smell his husband’s shampoo. That fading remnant of the man he loved and would never see again.  It broke something that was holding so strong up until then. The dam shattered and the playboy’s throat tightened as the sob clawed its way out.  He doubled over, crushing the pillow to his chest. He cried and let out horrible strangled sounds through gritted teeth.
Still, as the old man lay there in a puddle of his own blood, he reached out for his first lieutenant. The young man who had become like a son to him. “Steven…you must protect them, don’t let Schmitt and his men take the ship. If...if they take us..they'll go to land...think of the children. You mus' not...not let him make it...to shore. You’re in charge now.” He choked on the words with his teeth stained in red.
That’s when things picked up.
Soul mate Au. Kinda...idk
And he helped her.
"What do you want from me? Why do you insist to interject yourself in my business, I have nothing to harm this puny world with. I have nothing to harm anything with."
And like that the moment was gone, round of applause ladies and gents for the elegant tact of Tony Stark.
“You’re doing very well Steve, if you’d like to move to the nesting room now would be a good time.”  The doctor said.
Giving Tony small tasks like ‘ice chip duty’ and ‘pillow fluffer’ seemed to help.
Looking back a few rows he saw his friend Bruce, it seemed the other young man had noticed something as well and gave him a questioning glance. Tony shrugged and looked back to the pavilion where his grandfather wielded the great spear Gungnir.
Not that they would have enough time to do so of course.
"Alright...I'll go with you." Perhaps agreeing to this was a fools errand, but even if he could feel that once more. Even in fleeting... even unreciprocated. Maybe there was something left after all.
Having lived here among humans, even loving one, he hadn't really embraced them into his heart and mind as he had in these passing weeks. Mortals were not all so focused on unattainable perfection or appearance; despite what Stark may say of media jackals. From what Loki had seen, humans – the better ones at least, they cherished things like independent thought and learning. A place where art and music was praised as much as sport and feats of superior strength.
The rapid fire set down upon Avenger and Hydra alike.
Tony didn't have on his usual grin, which made the moment  feel even more genuine.
Steve paced and finally punched the wall, his fist buried deep in the steel reinforcement behind the dry wall. When he pulled his hand away and shook it - blood splatter on the floor from ruined knuckles.
There were more pressing matters at hand however than what was going on in the mind of James Barnes, perhaps after all of this was over it would be time to bury the proverbial hatchet with the other half of the Barnes household. Until then though, Phil had work to do.
Peter’s little face scrunched up as he placed his flat palms on his papa’s belly. This whole thing sounded weird to him. “There’s a baby in there?”
“Can it be a tower? High in the sky in the above?” Tony was so curious; Loki had only taken the boy to the surface a hand full of times. Things had grown too dangerous lately, the humans were becoming more violent and some whispered that one day the land walkers would go to war.
“Nothing important, So. How are things at the school?” Her tone was conversational but even in that airy tone he could see it in her eyes. A predator that smelled blood in the water. He wasn't going to give her this… it was different now. He had his full mind at his disposal. He wouldn't be goaded into a fit of pique like before.
Loki's tone is clipped and if James isn't mistaken – secretive. Seemed that was becoming a permanent feature where Loki was concerned. Still, he couldn't very well jump to conclusion. “You okay doll?”
That little mark was gone.
Like nothing was ever there, like Tony Stark never was.
Steve couldn’t sully the image of the alpha who stood for freedom in the countries darkest days. He couldn’t tell them it was all a lie.
James scoots over on the narrow bed and hauls Loki up next to him. “Lay down baby, that's it just lay down I won't leave ya.”
The surveillance van had been cut from pursuit  by a sudden accident, the young agents scrambles up backstreets to get back on the tail but then the traffic gums up the roads and this is falling apart faster than a snow cone in hell.
“Why am I not surprised?”
Tony, who is clearly currently making sweet sweet love to the Mark LIV, raises his eyebrows.  “Nope.”
"Welcome back," Barton says as Steve takes off his hat at the bottom of the stairs.  "Gotta admit, I didn't expect to see you again."
“You’re the worst,” Steve mutters as the line goes dead.
,” Tony said.
"Yeah, you too," Stark says.  "So, you get a name out of our FBI agent friend here?"
Steve doesn’t reply.  He holds the cigarette to his lips, breathes deep and blows the smoke out into the darkness.
“Do you really think everything would have gone down the way it did if I’d died in Afghanistan?” Tony says.
“It’s for goths, I think,” Tony said.  “Do you have goths?  It doesn’t matter - oh thank fucking
Her blue eyes meet his. "How many pages did you have to read before you knew you were reading your favorite book?"
“Cap says we should have something healthier than Fruit Loops in the house,” Morgan says, not looking up from the futuristic-looking unicorn she’s drawing.
“I’ll take one,” Peter says hopefully.
Steve, tiny though he was, took advantage of Tony’s momentary homicidal urge and yanked himself out of Tony’s grip.  He would have made it all the way to Clint, too, if Natasha hadn’t stuck her leg out and tripped him.
“Well, alongside all the freedom-loving, god-fearing Americans you brought back, you brought back some pretty bad people, too,” Jameson says.
“Did you steal it?” Bruce asked.
.  You weren't born the way you are.  You made the choice to become that - that
“I fired that guy,” Tony says.  “I can’t remember why, but I definitely fired that guy, and for good reason, clearly.  This is a
"You want the real answer, or the safe one?" the man says.  "The name's Tony Stark."
Tony knew where he was supposed to be.  He’d just seen him.  They’d talked.  Tony was supposed to be here.
, I want to give you a huge high five.”
“Well, life’s full of surprises,” Tony says.
“What are you talking about?”
Not so much for the Stark -Rodgers clan extension but rather that the Barnes' name looked like it was going to end with him. That was a whole other feeling he couldn't even grasp.  Every time he tried to sense what his omega was feeling about the state of affairs in their home- Loki was always one to throw up his walls.
"Excuse me what?"
Steve signed and leaned into the offered shoulder of the metal clad alpha. It was over now; at least Skull didn’t have Bucky. It didn’t mean it was going to be easy from here but it was something.  He sagged slightly as the slowly made there way down the stairs. Tony’s arms wrapping around his waist and one hand coaxing his chin up.
“You have a meeting at noon, Mr. Yashida from TechCo made it in this morning from Tokyo, and…Tony are you even listening to me?”  Pepper watched as the billionaire laced up his shoes and threw on a hooded sweatshirt.
“Hello”
“You don't have to be gentle with me Kurt.” Loki said, he had some idea what Kurt might tell him. The last time they spoke the other man had confided that he and his alpha were considering a family.
Notwithstanding the marked improvements there were still some stumbling blocks along the way. Tony was still struggling with occasional side effects – sever debilitating headaches and mood swings. The former would leave the engineer curled up in unbearable agony which terrified Steve. The later would send Tony into a self-imposed exile. During these times he punched dents in the workshop walls and left streaks of congealed blood across the floors from his rapidly healing knuckles. Or worse, long silences and troubling 100-yard stares that would make Steve fearful to scarcely let the Alpha out of his sight.
“Friend Anthony…Asgard is not made of emeralds…”
Rogers dropped the spoon and turned off the stove top, “ Yeah, yeah I'm fine. I mean...I'm not fine I just...”
Heading back to the tower was at most a silent affair. Steve spoke every now and again to ask about the classes Loki was teaching and how he and Tony were considering speaking to Xavier about possibly; allowing Peter and Wendy go to elementary school there for safety reasons. Being the children of such recognizable figures could be dangerous for them. Loki commiserated in that, sharing that his own education had been well with in the walls of Asgard's palace for that very reason.
It was all there, Tony’s childhood in a nutshell. Losing Steve was what changed his father, how could Tony have not realized that? The way the old man always went to the national war memorial every year and how for just that one day he didn’t seem so cold. For a few brief moments Howard wasn’t all about the work and deals. He would take Tony down to the Smithsonian Plaza, stand in line just like everyone else, and go through those gilded double doors. They would walk under the planes and around the display tanks and Howard would point out all the ones he build and the ones from other countries. Then he would quiz Tony on all the other ones design flaws. Just a little game to pass the time as they walked through the crowds.
He marveled at how relaxed Tony looked, breathing steadily and clinging to Bucky the same way he did Steve, leaching off body heat as the engineer was prone to do. It was the most beautiful thing Steve had ever seen.
Steve was not impressed, “How would you like to sleep in the lab.”
Meanwhile, it let the pack show Loki that he was apart by each spending time with him. The plan wasn't very revolutionary but it sounded as good as anything did. Bruce would spend Lunch with him and then Natasha said she would come by and take him up to the green house on the roof. Steve and Tony had been a little concerned with that plan but she assured them it would be good for him to get some sun and she was quick if he tried anything.  Moreover, they already had an understanding with each other.  It made more sense to start Loki out with people he had been around enough before.
“Thanks J you're a star buddy.”
Silence.
The weight shifts and he can hear Tony walking around the bed and kneeling in front of him. He can’t look, Strong hands take his wrists and there is warmth there, it feels so real and he's shattering. He can’t, he can’t look and ruin the dream or hallucination. Whatever the hell this is.
“Oh yeah that’s classy.” Steve smiled up at his friend. Watching the crinkle of joy around the billionaires brown eyes. It was sinful how deep and beautiful those eyes were. He hated himself a little more feeling that.
Stark: Only if you ask nicely
Howard Stark was a man who could build anything… and yet he lacked the knowledge to save his own flesh and blood. The physicians were right, he needed a miracle.
The agent had glanced over to see Jemma speaking to a group of teens and captured her eye before leading Loki away to an adjoining lab. She tilted her head in understanding and trigger a button that frosted the glass between the labs for privacy.
Barnes let out a shaking breath and clung to his husbands slim frame. “You have no idea how happy I am to hear that. I promise I am going to do everything I can to be better for you and support you through this. If it's ever too much you let me know?”
Steve did his best to suppress a little whine in the back of his throat as Tony leaned forward and their cheeks brushed, “Take off your pants and fold your clothes.” The alpha whispered.
“…don’t you puppy face me Rogers…no...Ah, damn it. There it is, the eyes and everything.” Tony leaned up and kissed the soldiers pouting lips. /that damn face and those damn eyes. This was why Steve Rogers should never be allowed to become a super villain. He will charm his way into world domination with and army of adoring fans. Maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, because right now- All Tony could thing of was how good Steve looked all swollen with those pups – his pups.  Damn his Alpha hindbrain. “Yeah, I’m so knocking you up again.” he nearly growled against his omegas growing smile. He wasn't wasting anytime it seemed, already climbing over the solider and pressing him into the mattress.
“She is well, she misses you but Duchess has been of great company to her. Father has missed as well of course.”
Frigga watched her youngest son search for weeks for the perfect stone for the favor. It was tradition among their people - a proposal of sorts. One would take a stone recovered along the sea floor and expend hours channeling their magic. Their very soul into it. Weaving the essence of their heart into it until the gem began to glow. The brighter the light the more love was expressed. Loki had so much love to give because he had been passed over so many times.
Loki looked down at the filth sodden floor. "I do not want to make up for anything. I cannot undo anything... I want it to end." His voice was raw and broken. The truth was there in the broken edges, the window to the hear of it as those words escaped like a whisper. "I want to die"
Steve shook his head. “Welcome back, how did it go?”
The goons would yell and make their demands; Steve just continued to smile with bloodstained teeth “Captain Steven Grant Rogers. Serial number Zero four six -.” Another kick to the chest, clap in the face- he could take it. He would take it, every bit of it before he told them a damn thing.
James had been away on a mission for weeks, he was tired and hungry and all he wanted was to curl up in bed and smash on everything in the fridge. Part of his wish came true with cold pizza, ice cream, 2 bags of chips and a gallon of ice tea.
So they agreed and Howard went to work on fusing the arm to Bucky’s shoulder, it was a painful endeavor but in the end, the metal appendage moved and reacted just as a human limb would. Bucky said it felt ‘eerie’ but better than nothing did. Afterward, Howard took the group through his ‘experimental weapons’ vault. Showing them all the things, they would be equipped with for their voyage.
The girl was young, barely out of childhood herself. Wanda, he thought her name was. Her crimson tail glowed softly with her own magic where she was backed into a corner. “I… he wouldn’t stop crying so the nurse. She told me to bring him back here. However, you were not here and then. That thing came out and I thought it was going to try and eat the baby!”
The trio decided to head up to the command floor to talk, Tony pretended it was for less noise and privacy, although it was really because it was about time for Steve mid afternoon snack. Neither of the alphas batted and an eye when the blond waddled off to the kitchen and came back with a large sandwich loaded down with everything but the kitchen sink.
Tony could see now why Pepper would be reluctant to leave him alone at times, after New York, he got those same looks. After Malibu, there was a lot Tony didn’t say, and he had tried a time or two. It was too hard to open yourself up when you’ve been under the impression that only bad could come from it.
Steve and Tony sat next to each other toward the back of the jet. It was a few moments after take off and Tony hadn’t said a word; Steve took his hand and tried to gain the engineers attention. It didn’t work, Tony’s eyes looked far away and his breathing started to pick up. Steve had seen this before, quickly and quietly, he unbuckled them from their seats and pulled Tony up along side him.
Nope… can't lay here now.
Howard nodded and stooped to heft up a bag. “Supply and demand, I get it. I’m a business man darling, this isn’t my first rodeo at the negotiation table.”
“You look tired Tony, go home.” Steve’s voice interrupted his fretting.
The AI silently complied, the room lights slowly lifting from black to review its two occupants.
“It doesn't have to be, you don't have to carry this. I used to think I had to carry things alone, sometimes that's too much for anyone, even a god.”
So instead, the agent’s phone chimed with a text.
Hydra agents began to swarm out of the building running toward the main gates where Coulson and his team were drawing their fire.
“Pete will be better off,” he said to himself glancing one more at the image. “Pep will be a good mom, and Hap he’ll be a good dad. They will give him a normal life, a good life.”  A small voice in his head said no… said Peter already had too many pictures on shelves of the people he loved who died. He was just a little boy, he’d lost too much.  That voice that sounded so much like Steve, pleading with him to turn back.
Steve would never forgive himself if someone was sent out on the field and killed in his stead.
Fury cuts him off with a glare, “I'm not having you scoop up a hydra agent just for them to crack some cyanide and give us nothing. You should know that song and dance by heart now.”
Bruce knocked on the nesting door in Tony’s bedroom, he had been waiting for the all clear from Jarvis.
"I think that's fair tin man. Looked what you did to me sweetheart." Steve growled pushing up and grinding his clothed erection, The action enough to make his husband groan in response and dig his fingers into his shoulders.
Tony didn’t need an invitation any clearer than that, the Alpha was calling out for Steve’s floor to be locked down and for any calls directed to him were to be forwarded to Pepper with the understanding he would detained for the next 5 to 8 days. The next order of business was to get Steve in a more comfortable setting.  Large open rooms simply were not the best thing for an omega in heat. Especially when Tony would have to get up and bring food, the space would feel ten times greater.
"Hulk hut me like a wreaking ball!
Title: Tampax and its many uses
The alpha pouted and pawed at the lever, “No fun, you're no fun. How can you deny me like this Steeeeb!” The answering silence was enough.  “ Fine, I need to go make a call anyway. Nevertheless honey, remember to just relax ok? I know this is a big deal right now but it's nothing we haven't done before. You're healthy, I'm ...as healthy as I can be considering. We'll be fine, try to recall that the fun part is making the baby.”
“Sir’s respiration and heart rate seem erratic, he is slightly underweight and I suspect lacking proper sleep and nutrition. He dose not however, appear to have any immediately alarming injuries Captain.” The AI sounded full of regret, perhaps even Jarvis felt like he failed his creator.
“Tony stop this, you’re being reckless and it’s going to get you killed. Then what will happen to Peter? I know you’re hurting but you can’t do this.”
Tony sat in his workshop, staring coldly at the half-empty bottle of bourbon next to his wedding photo. He tilted the frame back and forth, the gleam of the overhead lights whiting out the faces behind the glass.
“Yes please, so...Speaking of Loki...how is he?”
Through some research with aid of the Towers AI, the couple began education themselves about the adoption process. As it turned out, adopting mutant children is simpler. Sad but true, most families did not want to bring a child with the X-gene into their home unless one or more members of said family was also a Mutant. In some cases it stood to reason when Loki considered that the abilities of some children – like those whom had been surrendered by their parents to the X-institute, demonstrated dangerous abilities. This was no fault of the child. It was simply that not everyone had the resources to care for them. This also stood true for non-mutant children with special needs.
Now all he had was a past with Tony...
“I'm calling Stark.”
There are moments spend out walking the highways and byways that the once man of science thinks - would I take it all back?
The ravenette looked away as he detoured around the far side of the kitchen island, “Fine, just tired.” he said, padding back to the bedroom.
“Schmitt” Rogers hissed, sliding his back up the wall as his former friend closed in. “Bucky’s not part of this! This is between me and you!”
Meanwhile Loki and James look into other options.
“I was leaving a message to express I wasn't coming into work today if you must know.”
"It is not your fault Agent." Loki said noting the look on the other mans face for using the title. "Philip." he amended. "I am not a helpless child and admit it would have been better for me to reach out to those whom I have wronged rather than knowingly allow those wounds to fester."
The redhead shrugged her shoulders, “Talk, don’t talk, I’m just here.”
Xavier valued the honesty, “Loki has a hard time recognizing his worth. He means more to many more people than he realizes.”
“So Glenda, how’s things in the emerald city?”
It was something Tony had seen before, something even he had felt before. It was that cold, dirty, self-inflicted bitterness. Yeah, Tony knew all about that.
“Do it!”
“I got better” Phil spoke offhandedly loading another magazine.
Nick Fury knew when he had underestimated an outcome; he also knew when to make the hard choices. This was something that had been instilled in him through the years. Sometimes what was right was not easy and what was needed was not right. There was always going to be a loser, always-collateral damage. You had to weight the few against the many, and sometimes realize that a deal with the devil might be your best bet. If he had to become that devil to get the scales to balance… so be it.
The agents swift reply of “perimeter guards neutralized. My team is in position for frontal assault.” Made James stand up a little straighter, each muscle tensing like one of Barton's bowstrings.
Natasha told everyone to leave him alone, “he needs to process right now, and this is his process.” She had been fairly convincing with that death stare she had.
Steve thought of an film he’d seen before shipping out, Davis and Bogart, it was called The Petrified forest. He thought about Leslie Howard’s character- Alan Squire, talking to about Bette Davis’ character, Gabby.
Loki shook his head and looked elsewhere, “Have I the right to speak your name so casually?”
“Its fine I'll take her in” Loki mumbled looking in the glove box for toilet covers and sanitizer. Norns knew what one could pick up in rest area toilets. He could use magic to make them spotless but even then,…one never could be too careful.
It's hard to get over the mental image of a man knowing he's responsible for so much death and destruction. Not to mention what Loki did to Clint and Phil.
Of course, when Tony called later that day to check in Bruce skirted anything. Thinking that if he was not directly asked he was still standing by both of his friends.
Steve deadpanned “how does that help us?”
The Avengers held a press conference stating that Steve is alive, his body had been ‘miss identified’. The cover-story, that he had suffered a traumatic injury and spent the better part of a year - missing and wandering around with no idea who he was or where he was. They used the theory that his injuries were so grievous it  took some time  before the serum had repaired all of the damage giving him back his faculties so that the Captain could find his way back. It was both believable and fantastic; the media went wild with the heartwarming story of perseverance and strength. If anything, it called up even more patriotism and meaningful folk-songs hitting the top 40.
“That’s a nice visual.” Banner comments pushing his lenses back up the bridge of his nose. “ Did they take any samples at the hospital, or at least any that you know of?”
Tony fell to his knees and stared at the untouched arm. “What have I done...?” He can't feel Steve. He hasn't even seen the kids since returning to the tower. Had he even thought about then until now, the only time he'd left the workshop was to fix Barnes arm. When was that? He hadn't eaten or even drank and yet he felt no hunger or thirst.
The Ai retorted with what could have been a smug voice, “You did program me to be Sir.”
Tony had some very…interesting nannies.
The alpha sat up and took in the seriousness of the conversation. Obviously, this little dialog had been going on in Steve's head a lot longer than it should have. At this rate, he was going to have a small sports team of kids. Not that he didn't love his kids or have the thought of more cross his mind; Tony just thought there would be more time. “You know I’m with you on going public, I would have called a press conference if you said so the day after they were born. I know how hard it is to stand up in front of the world and tell your secrets Steve, you know that. That said, you don’t have to be pregnant to do it.”
They love him... Not me. Never me because I'm a liar, I'm strange, I don't think as they do and therefore- I am wrong.
Once their food reached the table Bruce smiled and thanked their server and dug into his own dish with out issue, sipping water only occasionally while asking Loki if he had fun today.
Others knew the bitter thoughts and the pain that wasn't just in the mind but leeched out all over. Feeling like you can't breath or that you'll never sleep again. Pins and needles on your skin and cold that just won't leave you. It was real, it wasn't over dramatic and didn't just 'go away' when you cheered up. Because one good day never guaranteed another.
“Honey are you ok?”
“As you wish Sir, the children are squared away on Agent Coulson and Agent Barton’s floor.”
Maybe he shouldn’t burden them with that.
"It's fine. I'm fine. I'm....happy for Tony really I am . "
At this point the residential snarky AI chimed in, “Sir, this is the Captain you are looking for.”
The director didn't make it past the lobby this time before Stark came down to greet the man personally. “Good morning Pirate pants! How are you doing this fine Saturday morning? Out stealing ice creams from children ? Pushing little old ladies in front of trains? Maybe just ruining my weekend for shits and giggles?”
Tony looked up to see Natasha holding a box of doughnuts with two coffee cups perched atop.
Loki groaned and threw his hands out. "Why do you have to be so nonchalant. Why go on about all this decorum." spitting the words out like they tasted foul. "I've seen the footage stark...the man you used to be. That man wouldn't have thought twice about clearing this desk for me."
Four words never meant so much.
The omega levelled his eyes playfully before reaching over and cleaning the mess. “No, you know I loath public transport. I think I'll give Shield a little surprise and just pop in the lobby.”
A shiver ran down the alphas spine when he pulled down the gravel drive. Something was wrong, his skin was tingling and a sour taste rose up in the back of his throat. James didn't even turn off the car or close the door, when he ran up to the home.
Blonde brows crept up, “Ok…”
"Why!" Loki turned and shouted. "What could I possibly have that want?"
“I’m thinking about our children’s nutrition Steeeeeb.” The billions whined and proceeded to place the bra on his head.
The omega was sweating and red-faced, “Why aren’t they coming…..”
“Yeah.. Ok, I’ll talk to him.”
'. Yeah, because that's what the old man always did, hell that's what Steve did. Maybe it was just that generation's uncanny ability to just walk it off no matter the trouble. Sure, Tony liked to think he was made of tougher stuff. He'd been abducted, tortured and nearly killed dozens of times and still managed to keep on keepin on. The thing was Tony wasn't a lightweight, you could throw anything at him physically and he'd just get up and throw some dirt on the blood, coming back every time with some smart-assed remark on the tip of his tongue. Any given Sunday he would have stepped right up and took on an alien invasion, megalomaniac tyrant, terrorist organization, monsters and any combination. Hell, throw in a sharknando for funzies! (Damn Barton to hell for getting him hooked on those awful movies).
Bruce was just coming back from getting lunch  when he heard the Pa system on the roof hanger going at full blast. He assumed it was Tony up to something so he decided to see if his fellow scientist might want to come in for food. However, instead of blaring classic rock and a grease covered billionaire - Banner got something waaaaay better.
Right so I was asked for some femmy flavored Steve, I think I can do that. On your mark get set GO!
Barnes watched in horror as Mallen's head was disintegrated from his shoulders. The body – headless and spraying blood wobbling to its feet a moment before dropping to the concrete.
Would Steve have put that plane in the water all those years ago? God wasn’t that a horrible thought now that it was free to knock around in that big brain of his. What if the moment that put Captain America on a pedestal in the hearts and minds of a nation…had been the actions of a broken heart. A passive suicide. It was too much to give thought to right now with everything else.
“Oh so grouchy. I’m telling Nat on you. She’s getting much better at a disapproving face since she started hanging out with you.”  Tony spoke, always talking to diffuse any lingering embarrassment of the situation as he helped the larger man to the small ensuite bathroom.  “Your gonna have to hold the pole yourself though gramps. At least until you buy me a drink first, I‘m a classy broad ya know.”
Between other worldly research and trying to help Dr. Cho and Helen with Tony, Bruce just wanted some better answers. It felt like they were crawling in the dark. At least with Extremis there was substantial research to fall back on, experiments to run, samples to take. With Loki...they were feeling around in the dark.
Then there was Tony and Steve, in a way New York is what brought them together but there was so much about that day that had rocked them to their core. Tony had anxiety attacks and Steve struggled to stay strong for his new alpha and budding family. That all started with Loki. Could anyone blame them for feeling harshly toward him?
Barnes confessed Loki was obsessed by fried foods. Bacon and onion rings at the forefront. Apparently, meats where often seared over open fire or baked in Asgard.
“m’not…”
The universe is not a consummate place; Loki understood that more than anyone. No, he knew that the world was filled to the brim with pitfalls and thorns. A deceptive yet beautiful garden, on its surface a glowing haven for the weary. Sweet winds calling you down its paths with whispers of jasmine and promises of respite. Only when you were surrounded by its cloying liar’s canopy, did the charm turn to rust and vines crawl out like hungry snakes, wrapping around your limbs and dragging you to your death.
The gloves came off next; he needed to touch Tony, needed to feel his skin. “It wasn’t because I didn’t want to, as soon as I was awake…I thought” He swallowed the lump of fear that crawled up his throat. “I thought it happened again, I was so afraid that I would have missed 70 more years. That would come back and you would be gone or …or like Peggy was. Or that Peter would be an old man and hate me for leaving you both. I came to find you as soon as I could Tony, you have to know that.”  He said touching the inventors face.
“Logan be careful please.” Kurt said gently as he called over Loki's shoulder where James and Logan where rough housing with Wade. The little boy in question was earnestly begging to be thrown in the air higher.
His men would say he fought valiantly, that even in the midst of certain doom the Captain held fast and raised his sword to heavens. Yet valor is not armor and courage no shield.
“It’s ok, I am here and I swear to you I’m going to be here for a long time Tony. Can’t get rid of me that easy.” Steve tried one of his lopsided smiles and received a soft one from his husband in return.  They were going to be fine; it was just going to take some time.
Of course, Steve apologize, “I'm sorry hun, it's not you I promise. Tony I know how much you're trying it's just...”
Thor: BROTHER~ THE MAN OF IRON HAS HELPED ME IN WRITING A SONG IN YOUR HONOR>
The botanist shook his head. “Steve we talked about this at your last appointment. The serums reaction time for superficial things is going to be a lot slower than you’re used to. It’s working to maintain your uterus, it was underdeveloped and the bigger the twins get the more the serum will be working to keep them safe. Little aches and pains are going to affect you like they would any other omega.” Bruce said sitting down his teacup.
What followed was pandemonium. Sam took to the birds nest scanning the surface for any signs of their Captain. James wanted to climb in the sub himself and find his friend.
“Stark”
"I want you Mr.Stark."
"It wasn't and you know that. If it had been me in that building Tony would have gone in after me. If it had been any of us he would have gone in there - hell or high water he wouldn't have left anyone in there." Steve corrects his friend's dark musings. He knows why Bucky feels this way, because Bucky still does not feel apart of this team.
Entering the renovated second floor master suite, Tony sat down on the side of the bed and waited.
“Shouldn’t we stop them?” Bruce questioned watching along with the madness. He had a bad feeling about this, like most things his friends did. Though the little green-tailed mer honestly tried not to dwell on it - lest his fin spines puff up and that was just embarrassing. Try being the one pup in the school who inflated every time they felt threatened then tipped upside down. Thankfully now he had more upper body mass and it wasn't that bad.
Later when they arrived at their destination Tony grinned over his popcorn saying, “I thought you’d get the reference.”
Together - was how they worked best.
“Jesus Christ...” James muttered taking stock of Tony's condition. “Stark, say something.”
Loki smiled and greeted each one and at one point he knelt down to give a hug to one rather shy little girl with bright purple hair.
Yep, Steve was going to be late.
“Captain!” one of the men shouted as their Captain, an older man they all respected, fell at the hands of the opposition. Captain Abraham Erskine was brilliant and kind, not at all the kind of man one would think to lead a group of sailors into battle. He was fatherly in his nature and soft in his words. A learned man whom the crew would often find consulting his star charts or out on the deck enjoying the ocean air with a book of poetry. He did not deserve to be cut down so easily. Erskine was a man who should have gone home at the end of this last tour of service, to his wife and daughters, he should have have died old and comfortable in a bed surrounded by his family and grandchildren.
People could be saved; Steve had believed that for so long. Maybe it was his mother’s voice or that weekly Mass. Something in him said there had to be something left to redeem when a good man did bad things.
"Pepper..?" he questioned her already feeling cool sweat gather at the base of his neck.
Yeah that would work, just a little goodwill gesture/ fact finding mission.
What he wanted, or more accurately, who- was lying in the next room being poked and prodded by SHIELD’s medical team and there was exactly jack and squat Tony could do about it.
“He doesn’t want this, and I’m not even sure how I feel right now. My mother struggled to support me, I know I wont have that much of an issue financially with this baby but, what about the job? How can I leave knowing I might not comeback? How is that fair…do I just. Put down the shield?” Steve leaned forward running his fingers through his hair. “I never even considered this as a possibility and now its here and I don’t know what to do. I‘m supposed to be a leader and I don‘t know what to do.”
The look in Loki's eyes right now.
The end game…
“If they fight with us then they are our brothers this day!” Thor bellowed, he had yet to see theses “strange land walkers with magic weapons” but he had had far bigger problems to deal with.
“You’re not thinking clearly Howard, it’s just the drink talking right now. Why don’t we sit down have of cup of tea and talk about this?”
"No I won't, go home Stark...there's nothing left here for you. There's certainly nothing left here for me."
“Sir, that would be below your usual presets and if I may add... uncomfortable to your current state of undress.”
Loki smoothed down his tie. "Yes thank you.  Natasha, I am here as it seems my previous missives where not well received. As for my upbringing it is improper to approach a lady directly until otherwise invited."
Truth was Tony wasn’t sure about anything anymore. He felt like he was losing his mind, he could hear Steve’s voice, see his face. Like a specter in the fog - some terrible siren beckoning him to his death. Steve was everywhere and no where at the same time. A constant companion in these deadly days. It was a cold comfort when Tony thought about it.
He has to reach out to Loki, something in him that sounds suspiciously like Sarah Rogers – pushes him forward.
“captain Rogers are you alright?” Jarvis said lowering the transmission volume as Hill describe the location of the current Hydra base.
"There's something we have to tell you Tony." Happy said, not meeting his eyes.
Then again, if he had died what kind of after life was this?  Steve did not recall anything in the scriptures his mother used to read him about heaven looking like plain beige room. Nothing about lying on a small bed with simple cotton sheets. No, he was not dead and something was wrong, the radio…the game on the radio was not right.
Little by little, he was fitting in and learning to smile without pretense. Here on Midgard there was no need to hold ones self apart from the commoners. Here Loki could simply ...be, and no one would judge him.
came to mind, along with
This is Omega verse, A/B/O Dynamics. So yep, you know what to expect. This will be co-posted to my Ao3/Wattpad. Depending on where you are reading this, the Ao3 version will be more graphic. (means fuckin...just sayin)
There were two eyes that stared coldly from the darkness. A mouth that spoke nothing but curses and a heart as black as night. “You ruined it all, pitiful little false mer, you were supposed to secure me my throne and instead I am left to rot. And I shall not forget you Loki…you, you have them all fooled as well. You who are just as selfish as I or maybe that milk breathed little runt has made you soft…well I am not soft. I will have my revenge.”
“No problem sweetness!”  The billionaire returned dodging a shell fired from one of the tanks.
This couldn't be.... The serum... and... And this was Steve they were talking about here. Steven Grant Roger, Captain America. This was all some elaborate joke, Steve was going to walk in any moment and it would be over and Tony would hit him and hug him and tell him never to do this again. "Leave the practical jokes to the birdbrain," he'd say.
As the fog rolled over the sea, he chanced the danger and pushed the vessel on through the moonlit seas.
“Right away Sir,” The Ai responded as hydraulics shifted taking the lift down beneath Stark industries.
All he had to do now was bring the idea up to James.
“Right away Sir.”
“Steve come on…”
Tony counted the event as a win and was already plotting out ways he could build suitable harnesses for the creatures.
The lie smith seemed to accept this, leaning against Barnes back, “I Love the weather …don’t you dear? Sooo Wintery gets me all…”
It didn't take a rocket scientist to know what was bugging Steve. It was more less a bonus that Bruce had the smarts to build one if need be. “He’ll be fine. It's Tony after all. He might be a bit reckless, but overall there is no one else, Save for you that is- who is that good under pressure. He won't make a mistake, Tony knows how much he has to lose.” Bruce said, trying his best to be comforting. The doctor understood everything Steve was going through. He often worried about Natasha when she had to be away for days at a time and he knew how uneasy Pepper could get. Additionally, they all worried for Tony as he was basically the head alpha of their little pack. Without the outspoken engineer their family just wouldn't feel complete. Losing anyone wasn't an option, but losing Tony would be crippling for all of them.
No one was laughing.
Now, Tony didn’t have a problem with the cost, hell he spent more than that on Sunglasses… (That were now prescription, he’d never tell anyone that though.) This was a little weird though.
“Steve…” Pepper knocked again.
He couldn’t do that, even with the pain his side and the heavy feeling of dread settling into his chest, Colonel Rhodes staggered to his feet and flipped up the helmet visor. “ Please… Tony, it doesn’t have to be like this..”  His heart broke for his friend because now he could see, he could see everything he and everyone else had missed about Tony.
He wasn’t like Bruce or Tony who had been successful in their fields even before they chose this rode in life. Rather, it chose them as the case maybe. Natasha , Clint, Thor… they all had something outside of this, they all had something more to give.
“I am...deficient.” He pulls his hands from hers wrapping his arms tight around himself. “James will never know the joy you are soon to know Agent Romanov.”
Tony frowned slightly, he knew better to ask Thor. The thunderer had a bad habit of frying coms within the first few lighting strikes. “Yeah do that.”
Loki turned around with murder written all over his face. "It was Stark wasn't it! That ...that ....Bilgsnipes anus!!! I'll kill him!!!"  The man burst up out of his seat and was storming through the house, Bruce caught him around the waste.
Steve felt himself tear up looking out as the city dimmed and little lights flickered to life. The little torches burned for that solemn dark hour before everything returned to normal.
Tony and his words, always talking, always moving, always creating. Steve could see these traits already passing to the pups and he wanted to see it that much more. Placing a hand on his stomach in an absent-minded gesture he turned his mind onto better things. He had come off the special cocktail of suppressants that Bruce had come up with. Hopefully, he would have a heat in the next few months and then maybe...well only time would tell. Don’t count your chickens before they hatch, his mother would say.
