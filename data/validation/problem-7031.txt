He listened carefully; the only sounds being the crickets, and then he heard sniffles. He decided to stay there for a while.
“Yea, I’m with him, he set off – he, Nat, Tony, he- he’s not responding,” he said, and he shook him again.
The emotions were sitting in their chairs, mostly prepared. Fear had yet to calm down. There was no one emotion in control, but they worked together, a sign of a healthy-functioning control system. Most of the time.
“I know, because you’re a very decent person,” Tony said, patting Steve’s arm, “I just – I don’t how to admit that I…Oh God. I kinda…maybe…had a, er, experimental period in my life where I had a crush on you.”
He could hear them more clearly now. His chest hurt and there were throbbing pains throughout his stomach, at least he thinks it’s there anyway; his throat is uncomfortably filled with a tube, so everything’s touch and go. He tried to wiggle his toes. He thought he did, and he got excited, but he heard voices around him, and they still sounded glum, and far away, and he’d assumed he probably hadn’t moved, otherwise they would have got excited.
tell me what you think :) I know sometimes things may feel a bit rushed, that seems to just more be my style of writing now though. I welcome feedback!
“I love you,” he whispered, closing his eyes tight against the onslaught of tears, and Steve tightened his hold around him.
Through his panic he didn’t really register the pain, but saw the light beaming out of Tony’s hand as he beamed full power on Steve’s chest, sending him flying far backwards in extraordinary speed. Steve reached out to him but it was too late.
to get more obvious. Tony didn’t want this. He liked Steve, sure, but he didn't want to be tied down. Certainly not by Captain Fucking America. Why couldn’t he just be left to his own devices, his own decisions?
Tony gasped, taking in breaths, holding his neck because it felt like something was stuck, stopping him from breathing.
“Steve, listen to me,” he landed roughly in front of the captain, who seemed to be quite determined.
A few days later, after keeping a not-so-subtle eye on Tony, he noticed he wasn’t eating much. Steve made sure he usually ate with them in the evenings, or whoever was around, but if he talked much, then it was only to disguise that he wasn’t eating that much. He looked tired.
Everyone crowded into Tony’s rooms that night, not wanting to let him out of their sight, for the most part. He fell asleep crushed between Pepper and Steve, with Natasha against Pepper’s back and her hand resting on Tony’s hip. Everyone else bundled up on the floor on furs or pallets, a cacophony of snores erupting once they all lost consciousness – which everyone only slept through due to sheer exhaustion.
As the weeks slipped past leading up to the departure of the visiting royals—and a feast in their honor which, Natasha insisted slyly, would also serve as a late celebration of Steve’s nineteenth birthday—Steve began to suffer more and more each day from the bond tightening within him, demanding that he return to Tony’s side. The man was never more than a few rooms away from him for weeks on end, and yet they had not shared a single word that did not concern business. Tony’s looks were becoming both more prominent and more desperate, and Steve found—to his shame—that he was beginning to hope that Tony would break and finally approach him.
Eventually they broke apart, partly at the doctor’s insistence that Tony, at least, get inside and get warm. Steve insisted on carrying Tony back up to the castle, and would not hear another word about it. So he carried Tony bridal-style through the side entrance, and Bucky swept Natasha up into his arm (trusting her to keep a good grip because he was a little short-handed), and he carried her over the threshold too before setting her down and punching Clint in the shoulder for the ‘short-handed’ comment.
Tony fought the pervasive aches and pains pulling at him as he shifted to sit on the edge of the cot, his hands curled around its splintered and slightly damp frame for support.
“We deleted every instance of it,” Howard added. “You mustn’t tell anyone. Not Ty, not Jim, not any of your friends.”
“It’s good to see you, Obie,” Tony admitted with a half-smile. The man had never been his favorite person, but if nothing else he had always been loyal to Howard – a loyalty that had preceded Tony’s birth and outlasted his father’s death, it seemed. “Thank you for taking care of the kingdom. I know it must have been a shock.”
“I got so frustrated with you. From the first time we met in Berlin, and every mission after it seemed, I  was trying to comprehend – well, you, for starters, but also why you made me so mad. I think you reminded me of me.”
Tony groaned as his arm struggled to reach what he was trying to, and his feet left the chair as he tried to pull himself up onto the shelf.
It was only an hour later, when Tony had got the boat up and running, when he was getting in the boat by himself, about to ride off in it.
“Oh yes,” Joy said, “This is good. This is very, very, very good.” “…Joy, I think a new island is being created!”
“Ok, then, the usual,” Clint said sarcastically, shaking his head, “You know you two are both really weird, right? You’re even more weird when you’re together.”
He was feeling mixed emotions to say the least, but had finally met his soulmate! Which must mean they were in this room…full of people. He moved his way through the crowds, questioning a nice woman called Sharon who had different coloured tips, meaning she had a soulmate, but it turns out she had recently got back with her childhood best friend and they were ‘giving it another go’. Steve politely said he was glad for her, and excused himself, and looked around the room. He then bumped into Tony, catching a glimpse of one of his red wings, and realised he was not his soulmate, but he still liked him and cared for him, no matter what – soulmates are not the be-all and end-all – but when he reached him, Tony looked slightly panicked and Steve instantly wanted to erase his anxiety, whatever had caused it, but Tony left politely before he could. Steve couldn’t find his apparent soulmate anywhere, and his wings drooped a little by the end of the night, so he had retired to his room to ponder.
could control what was going to happen – no one else gets to decide for him. He scoffs. Wow. He has issues.
“Tony’s…trying to get his boat out, and, well, failing at it, and he could get himself hurt…” But Steve was already getting up, “Wanna help?”
“Well, I didn’t really do it for you, you know, Cap. You guys can tag along, sure. It was really my therapist’s idea. Now, let’s see…Happy’s coming, you two…Natasha?”
, what with it being on every news channel in the world that he probably had PTSD after Afghanistan and all. Does not mean the media was kind about it. He mostly pushed it out, but it made him feel a little bitter too. Could never really trust anyone.
can be bull-headed at times… And, honestly, out of everyone – you’re the most potent link to my past. You remind me of Howard. And, yes, I know what you’re gonna say, he made you resent me, he never won any father-of-the-year awards, I know. And I – I wanted to protect you - not because of that, but because of
This is more from Tony's point of view, is longer, as I have finally figured out this story, more or less, so it shouldn't be too long till further updates. To me, that means like a week or so, I don't know.
Tony hated seeing the look of hurt, betrayal on Steve’s face, but he had to do it. He turned his concentration onto defusing the big bomb, on neutralising its contents, as the other machines around him beeped more quickly.
“I guess we haven’t really, um, thought about it much,” Tony said, between sniffing, “But if it works out, and we have a healthy baby, then yea…something like that. Or maybe we say we had a surrogate.”
,” Steve said mournfully, and then sniffed, and Tony realised he was crying. He was trying to decipher what he was saying. He seemed to be the only person in the room.
But his grumpy demeanour, or tiredness, was still prevailing, and he couldn’t really explain it. He just felt like snapping at Steve sometimes, and it wasn’t just Steve either, almost anyone he swore was just trying to aggravate him, so he shut them down, and isolated himself more when his teammates got annoyed with
“Tony, wait,” Steve called, jogging up to him. Bruce and Natasha had gone into town. “You sure you wanna go alone?”
“Oh honey, look, you’ve got lots of other jeans, ok?” Steve said, a look of sympathy in his eyes as he continued sorting stuff out. He was having a spring clean. Tony was pouting to himself in the mirror.
“Yes, it’s imperative to patient confidentiality. He’s in his rights to fire me after this. But I hope he doesn’t.” Sandy turned to leave.
“I’m not sure yet,” Bruce explained calmly, “That’s why we’re doing tests. Now, Tony,” he turned to him on the bed, and Tony looked up, and held his shirt up to his chest.
“With the other Avengers, some of them…know of his situation anyhow, and we keep things pretty tight-knit, so I only told one other person, who I trust, to keep an eye on Tony, because I’m worried about him. I’m really worried. And – I don’t know what to do.”
Standing on a small hill overlooking the blue ocean, the jungle-like islands and the small quaint town to the side was really spectacular. Tony suddenly felt grateful to be here, to be able to appreciate these things, this beauty. This calmness. He didn’t feel calm very often. But he was in control now. It was his choice. Holding a gun in his hands didn’t feel dangerous – it was more soothing, because
And as soon as he got back to his room, his mind, thankfully, supplied him with a beautiful visual of Tony smiling up at him, the lines on his face showing his eyes light up, his lips moisturised from the kiss. Beautiful, and hopefully happy, and full of future, and healthy, and
Some part of him wasn’t really listening, her voice was kind of soothing to his ears though as he sifted through the foggy haze of his mind. It was full of maybes, and tiredness, and resignation.
Joy awoke a bit more, seeing that Steve put his hands on Tony’s face and pulled him harder against him.
“No, the baby should be quite normal, will look splendidly like both of you fine humans, and as far as I’m aware, she will not be pink. Well, I don’t think so. That might be quite cute. You know, my brother was born blue…”
“We seem to have a, uh, downstairs problem,” Anger said. Fear looked back to the control panel in fear.
Sadness pulled up a memory of Obie. Of the bad things that can happen from too much being on love island, of trusting people, of getting involved too deeply. Love island was scarce enough anyway, Joy thought.
“That right? Well, I’m sure we’ll have some jobs lined up for you in no time. Not that my suits and machines can’t do the heavy lifting…”
Steve struggles to admit the connection at first, but he knows it’s there; like he can’t help feeling tied to Tony, like a wire. He tries not to think about it too much. But reality is, nearly all his thoughts are revolved around Tony, or existential questions about his place in the world.
And they remained that way for the rest of the night, even when Tony went to bed, alone, and still on a high, fairly unable to rest.
he had accidentally bent the spoon he was holding. Dammit. Why did he have to torture himself over the image of Tony…with someone else…in that way…not him…
“Might as well,” Bruce said, sighing. Tony looked baffled, but Bruce won his way through in the end. They were alone for the moment, as Tony knew Steve would only freak if he thought something was wrong with him. Which obviously, there was. Damn aliens.
“Cap? Are you with Stark?” Natasha’s busy voice rang through, but he couldn’t see anyone when he looked around, he only saw smoke, debris, and heard distant fighting.
, which was a little awkward, but it was a lot more sensual than usual, and Tony had once again ended up tucked into Steve, their wings melding together, as if it were meant to be.
getting annoying, so she helped up Fear and pushed Sadness to the side on her wheelie chair, her heavy, laden weight going begrudgingly. She often said she held the weight of the world.
And now the tips of his natural one had changed colours. Steve hadn’t noticed it yesterday, how could he have been so stupid? The one Tony replaced must not show when, or if, he met a soulmate. He was sure they were both red. He had read Tony’s file, seen pictures of him, heard others talking about him, read all about him in the news of his Iron Man extravaganzas and playboy tendencies. And he had admired his beautifully shaped wings when he had seen him up close yesterday when they had met officially for the first time. He had basically froze to the spot, encapsulated by his beauty; the magazines not having done him justice, and eventually he was able to shake his hand and talk to him for a while. He was smiling quite a bit. Tony might have thought he was a bit mad. But he was gracious, and allowed Steve to stay at the Tower, and Steve was just liking him more every second, especially as Steve made him laugh about how it’s so different from the 40’s and Tony’s eyes had crinkled and Steve caught a shine in his brown eyes. But Tony was kind about it, telling him about helping him accustom to the new world and welcoming him to the Avengers, only teasing him a little. And yes, maybe they had debated a little tensely about what authority the Avengers had and whatnot, but he could tell Tony was, if anything, enjoying being challenged. He had slipped away not long after that, and Steve had been worried he was putting distance between them for some reason.
“Of course, man. As if you need to ask.” Tony’s eyes widened, and he looked to Steve, who was smiling, and nodded happily at him. Tony went to hug Rhodey again.
“And then after – after the whole – after you were attacked, it was like I found a new anger. An anger of not protecting you, of not being there enough like I could have been. And I know, you can protect yourself, but…I didn’t wanna lose you. I wanted to get to know you properly, but now this terrible thing happened, and suddenly you were – well, suicidal, and I, well I thought I could have done more before to be a friend to you. I realised maybe I thought of you as something more than a friend, differently to everyone else, and that I wanted you to be my partner in the way it wouldn’t be right back in my day – but I knew you wouldn’t want that. I think I resented that a bit. I've been angry at what happened, and mad at myself, and at everything, and pushing my other feelings aside. I’m sorry, I know this must be confusing for you, to say the least. But Tony, I honestly don’t know what I would do without you. And these feelings for you that I realised I had, they scared me – until I realised what they meant.”
“I – I was just worried about you – and – and – I didn’t say much but-” No, he didn’t have to defend it. He was right. “Well, I’m not sorry, actually-”
– in his face, much to his shock, before getting away again. But Thor had then finally captured the mischievous creature which was from another planet before it could do any more damage (especially to the tower). Apparently, it had magic, but didn’t cause serious harm, like a goblin or something in Earth terms – still, it did not
“I er – I don’t know whether you had an appointment with him today – I’m-” Steve didn’t really know what to say. Only that something needed to be said. “I don’t know quite what to say. Except – you know we went on that holiday recently?”
Steve didn’t really know what was wrong. Maybe Tony was just in a bad mood recently, maybe it wasn’t brought on by anything specific. That would explain it easily enough, he supposed. But Steve had to worry, that it might be something more.
happen. In that case, you would think it might be hard to tell whose your soulmate is. Maybe somebody has already met their soulmate, but is not with them, or they’ve died. But everyone is also sure that they usually feel a certain connection with their soulmate anyway – whether they like it or not – so you would ‘know’ who your soulmate is.
“Turn to the side a bit,” Bruce ordered, and Tony did. Bruce looked at the screen, around where Tony’s kidneys were outlined in the ultrasound scan. It seemed mainly normal…so what was in his abdomen was…
Bruce swallowed and looked back to the screen where you could hear a faint but fast beep-beep-beep of a heartbeat.
“Tony, you’ll be feeling the effects of the epidural any time now. It’s nearly baby time,” their obstetrician said.
Tony ignored Steve and pushed up one more time to try and get it, only to latch onto the shelf above him as his feet left the chair and were left dangling again. His eyes widened at his predicament.
He could throw this gun into the sea. Probably wanna walk to wear the sea was deeper against the cliffs, though. Actually, that could harm wildlife. And what if someone found it? Hmm.
“Hey, what’re you guys talking about?” Barton said as he strolled into the room, signalling a shot for himself as well.
.” Tony sighed, “No, you wanted the answer, ok? I don’t know how to explain why you care about people you care about – you’re my friend Tony, and that’s just what happens!”
“Because I know what to be optimistic about, Joy. Not emotions and feelings, but of things that we can actually accomplish. Like
I know it's been a while since I updated. I have put this as 2/2 chapters, as I probably will not continue it. However, I really like the concept.
“Tony?” He said, panicked. He shook his shoulders again, and bent down, but Tony suddenly flinched in his grasp. Steve manoeuvred to sit behind Tony, holding him in his lap.
“I think it would be good for you to see what other people do to cope. How other people feel. It might give you perspective. Validity. A bit of a weight off your shoulder. Did you look at any of the online forums?”
Tony smiled to himself, and put a hand on Steve’s shoulder. He didn’t bat it away, but looked at Tony nervously.
“I will – I’ll get it then-” Steve stuttered as he bumped into Dum-E, the machine whizzing about, as Tony told it off, and Steve went up on the chair and stretched above him to get the box Tony wanted. He brought it down and laid on the counter.
“Tony! Tony,” Steve could only repeat his name. He put a hand on Tony’s back and rubbed it, as small bits of rubble came out of him as he coughed it all up onto the floor.
“I’m sorry, Steve, about earlier,” Natasha said quietly, standing a small distance. Steve looked to her. He was tense; coiled up like a wire, and he could so easily snap, but it wasn’t her fault, it wasn’t anyone’s, and that wouldn’t do any help right now. He just needed Tony to be safe, to be
They say the tips of your feathers changing colour and glowing is a process. It doesn’t happen right away, but as soon as you meet your soulmate, the process begins. You may feel a tingle, maybe you won’t feel it at all. You might only notice it’s happening the next day. They might feel different. And how do you know who your soulmate is? Well, everybody said, that’s pretty obvious – it’s whoever you met recently who also has changing colour tips on their wings. And since not everyone has soulmates, it’s not likely to happen to more than one pair of soulmates in the same room, at the same time. But it’s not like that
Tony was working underneath a suit when he felt a sudden rush of sickness boil up through his oesophagus, instantly nauseating his throat as he felt the bile rise up, and he leant to the side quickly as he started vomiting unexpectedly.
“Ok, ok, here,” Steve lifted Tony carefully to his feet, supporting his weight, and helped him back onto the sofa, as he rested there, and put hands on his ever-growing stomach, rubbing it to reassure himself.
There was an array of stories and experiences by people. Scrolling down, he saw she was right. Everyone who experienced trauma of a similar kind have the same kind of feelings, but everyone behaves differently and finds different things that do or don’t help them. There are different outlooks. Several of suicidal anonymous’ which have plenty of supporting messages on the thread, but proper discussions about it as well. About how people don’t understand. The frustration. The bitter anger. The low self-worth. Feeling it’s not worth it.
Sam scrubbed his hands over his face, looking like he wished he did not have to share the deduction he made. “That would explain why Tony was gone for so long. If Loki wanted to make whatever enchantment he was working on permanent, he would have been waiting for Tony to break.”
“Nothing’s wrong!” Bucky yelled loud enough to be heard over the hubbub of the docks, and he seemed calm and happy – from a distance, at least.
“I'm afraid that's true, Your Highness,” Natasha replied grimly. “Though I intended to meet with you nonetheless after the pleasing offer you sent in suit, I have found myself in need of information the likes of which only you can give me and, if you don't mind me saying so, I can't imagine you will be eager to part with it.”
“Of course, Princess,” he inclined his head. “I am deeply sorry that I have no more information for you.”
The three boys generally watched her from a safe distance. Natasha was a lovely girl, but also very, very terrifying, and after a few weeks of it even Bucky had resorted to throwing her handwritten notes as their primary form of communication when she was in one of these moods.
She put on ordinary civilian clothes: a pair of bluejeans and a tee shirt, not bothering to dress up or look particularly nice, and tiptoed down the back service stairs and out the kitchen entrance.
“Let go!” he barked, twisting in Thor’s grip to find the swan again. It was drifting closer to them now, silent, but still flapping its wings and bobbing its long neck back and forth anxiously. “Let
Armed with this new information, the five of them were packed and ready to depart by noon the next day for Asgard. Their immediate objective was to cross more names off of Clint’s list, so in the interests of time they had split into two teams. The first, comprised of Steve, Bucky, and Sam, Clint sent after the second two names on the list: an Asgardian woman known only as Amora the Enchantress, and a man of unknown origins named Aldrich Killian, both of whom had last been seen in or heading for the southlands of Asgard, far outside of the cities.
Howard had tapped at the desk, the. Looked at her, his brow furrowed. "Do you know what you want to study?"
Steve bristled. “Too good to share a meal with us commoners, Your Highness?” he asked bitterly, feeling filled suddenly with the need to defend Bucky against the high and mighty
“You're missing your celebration,” came Tony’s voice, and Steve jolted to his feet. “Nat was looking for you for a birthday dance.”
It was Clint who slammed through the door a moment later. “Great hall,” he hissed. “Right now, right now,
Which is how Tony finds himself in his superhumanly attractive neighbor’s apartment, being shown into the little bathroom while wearing nothing more than his Velma Dinkley glasses, ratty U.S.A.F. sweatpants (technically, nobody can
Ty seemed to sense her fear, and she suspected it was because she was holding onto his hand with a steely grip.
She gave herself one last look in the mirror to steel herself. “Well, Kid,” she said, matter-of-fact, “you’re not exactly
That winter, an all-out war broke out in Asgard between two ancient, ancestral city states and agents of the neighboring realm of Jötunheim, both of which were infamous within the nine realms for wielding the magical arts in warcraft. This made the other realms highly, determinedly resistant to involving themselves in the quarrel, or allying themselves to either side for fear of future reprisal. Rather, they simply let the two kingdoms fight out their concerns between them, and them alone.
And Bucky, who had been frantic and almost vicious up until now in their search for Tony, was met with Tony’s cool reactions and uncaring looks. Tony did not ask after Bucky’s arm, which—while from anyone else would have seemed polite and accepting—ended up feeling more as though Tony barely noticed its loss, nor particularly cared. Taking it as a sign that all his fears about Tony blaming him for his parents’ deaths had been true, Bucky had retreated into the mere shell of himself he had been for months after waking up following the attack. His setback only compounded Steve’s pain and anger, not directed at Tony, and hardly even directed at Loki, but rather just bubbling inside him and desperate for release.
to,” Tony repeated, wondering why Steve didn’t seem to be getting it. He was giving him an out! Why wasn’t he taking it?
Though Tony’s fingers continued to bounce through the whirling song, Steve thought maybe he had seen the look of desperation and hopelessness on his face, because Tony’s own expression fell and he swallowed very quickly and very sharply, dropping his gaze to the keys.
From the moment of his arrival, King Howard was treated with no more than the barest minimum of courtesy due to him by the household, as he had not made the best of impressions. The first thing he said to Tony upon his arrival was a snide complaint about his son’s attire. (Though in the king’s defense, Tony had been sparring with Bucky and Natasha out by the lists, so the grass stains and liberally smudged dirt upon his person were quite eye-catching.) Nonetheless, neither Natasha nor any of her friends much appreciated the downcast look it gave Tony for the next few hours, and less still the false smiles and forced laughter and joviality Tony donned in the man’s presence – all of which was hinting at an ongoing pattern.
The airplane staff came around with coffee, fruit and croissants, and while the croissant had a slightly odd texture, more like a dinner roll than a proper croissant, Nia slathered it with butter and inhaled it before drinking three cups of coffee.
“Yeah,” she said, finally meeting his gaze. “You know how they are. It’d just be more fuel for the fire. They both desperately want me to pick
with Lord Stane, it was agreed upon. Despite his general lack of interest or apparent investment in the life they had once led together, Tony himself was also quite insistent on marrying Natasha as soon as possible. Steve would not be surprised if Tony was concerned, like Lord Fury, that he might disappear again if not safely tied to the princess in marriage, and after so many years there really was no logical reason to wait.
Pepper made a terrible noise of hurt and horror, falling back a step and taking Sam’s arm for support.
"Leadership," said a familiar voice behind them, and Ty's arms slid around her waist, wriggling her away from Jim. "They're going to make you Director someday."
Steve takes his hand and gives it a cursory look, then cups his fingers and palm around it and sets it casually on the table, all wrapped up in his own. Tony looks down to where they are now blatantly holding hands, and doesn’t bother to suppress a delighted laugh at the guy’s sheer nerve.
They broke apart only the barest space, both pulling in desperate breaths. Steve held Tony’s forehead to his own far too tightly, pressing their brows together and fighting tears he could feel in the corners of his eyes. “Tony,” he said, hardly recognizing his own voice. “I’m so sorry, Tony, I’m so sorry.”
“It’s a cute butt,” Jim informed Carol, giving the butt in question a squeeze. Carol wriggled her nose back at him and took a swig of her beer.
Even over the din of the kitchens there was an audible clattering noise from outside, and a moment later Sam came careening into the room. He ducked and wove expertly around the hustle and bustle, clearly searching for Steve amongst the frenzy preceding the midday meal. Steve hunched a little bit in his corner, but Sam spotted him anyway. Sam was a year younger than Steve, but a little tiny bit taller, which was just not fair.
Tony blinks slowly at him. Well, he supposes staring helplessly at the guy’s bright blue eyes is better than gawping at his happy trail. But seriously: nobody’s eyelashes are that gorgeous in real life. It must be the lighting in this stupid hallway.
Sam came skidding into view not long after – accompanied by Natasha’s chamberlain, Phillip Coulson, and several other members of the castle staff.
It’s not like Tony can’t get attractive people interested in him, or people far younger than he is, for that matter, but that usually has to do with enormous amounts of work on his part paired with the right context. Steve has more or less caught him with his pants down, and Tony is well-aware he isn’t all that impressive when he’s not being full-blown
Prince Thor was extremely tall, as expected, and had brilliant blue eyes like the other prince, but that might be where the likeness to Loki abruptly ended. The man was built like a siege tower, with vast shoulders, a broad chest over a waist thick with muscle, and as he strode into the room his bare arms bulged defiantly out from beneath his navy cloak. His hair was long, waved like water and the color of gleaming sand, braided intricately with stones and beads, and decoratively looped around his head in lieu of a crown.
The light came on, dim and golden, and she smiled as she saw the door only a few inches away from where her hand rested on the switch.
Obie gave her an apologetic look, and patted her on the shoulder. “Fine. They promised they’d get to graduation before you get your assignment.”
The king and queen and all gathered looked on in curious surprise, waiting to see what the young princess would do. After a long moment, ignoring Prince Anthony’s squirming, Princess Natasha held out a tiny hand for him to take.
The three of them hugged, tightly, Jim and Carol sandwiching Nia in the center, bumping their noses against the top of her much-shorter head.
However, he did not make it far from the front door. Around the other side of the castle, where a lake sprawled between the ancient building and the clearing where they had secreted their mounts, Clint was staggering sideways across the dirt path while shouting and cursing vehemently – at the large mute swan that was viciously attacking his boot.
“Holy fuck,” Nia said, as she spread out her fingers, pressed a hand to his icy skin. “I’m touching Captain America. I’m fucking touching Captain America; I’m--”
“I don’t see why not,” said Maria. “There’s not...there isn’t much to do on a day-to-day basis; it’s mostly just checking stats and observing conditions.”
Thor’s lips quirked. “The amulet itself is enchanted, so it requires an energy source. This one uses the living blood of the wearer, which means that the longer it is worn, the more energy it will drain from you as it fights the spell. Its use must be sparing.”
Steve was scrawny, and sickly-pale, and had nothing to his name that did not depend on another’s goodwill.
Bucky wasn’t so bad – Natasha spent a lot of time with Tony, but they only got to see each other once a year, so Tony thought that was only fair. But Natasha said that when Tony was gone, she spent almost all her time with Bucky and Steve. Tony figured out after one pointed conversation with Lord Fury that they had brought the two boys to the castle specifically to keep Natasha company when Tony wasn’t there, because he’d made her so happy the first time they met.
Somewhere along the way, Tony had gone from being a source of constant aggravation to becoming what felt like one of the deep roots of happiness in Steve’s life.
He shifted uncomfortably. “This is not my area of expertise, and I am afraid I cannot give you all the answers you seek. My knowledge is limited. Still… blood magic would work in this capacity, as an example. It would, however, require the willing participation of the spell’s subject.”
Pepper frowned at him, then squeezed the hand she still held. “This is not my home, these are not my people. I am not willing to risk Tony’s safety no matter what feelings I may have about his behavior.”
Sam gave him a look that said very clearly he did not believe Steve’s ridiculous excuse, but he agreed to leave after saying appropriate goodbyes to the assembled royals.
Everyone at the table stayed very still and very silent for a moment. Bucky, for his part, was turning a fetching shade of dusky pink on the apples of his cheeks, and even Natasha looked a little flushed. Sam looked more amused than anything else, clearly waiting to see how this played out.
They spent hours in the study together, or in the drawing room, and Tony tried valiantly to teach Steve the harpsichord, then the lute, then—in desperation—the little children’s glockenspiel. To their dismay (and eventual hilarity), Steve could hold neither a tune nor a beat even if Tony tapped it out for him, so they settled for Tony playing the harpsichord while Steve appreciated the happy sounds it produced, and sketched or read while listening from across the room.
Through the building emotions in his gut, Steve realized he needed to leave the room immediately, and without another word to Tony he turned and did so. He could not decide whether it was fury, fear, agony, something he could not name, or a combination of them all that was roaring through his body like it needed to come out as a punch.
else. But his rational mind knew that would never be possible, and no matter how torn he was, reason still won out most of the time. And besides, if Tony had to marry anyone else, it should be Natasha, their dearest friend. Steve did not feel so much that he had to share Tony with Natasha, but rather that they were all already sharing each other, and for Tony and Natasha to marry made little difference to that dynamic.
He tried to remember this when Tony appeared at dinner looking ruffled and flushed, and yet still staring at Steve as though he had never seen another human being before.
why I wasn’t sober enough to help with your little radiation experiment, General?” Howard asked. “Because I laid my ethics down to bed and took a weapon design from the mind of a madman who was
Peggy looked her over, then reached a hand up, brushing a thumb across Nia’s cheek. Her fingertip was soft, gentle. “You know they’ll make you choose, eventually, don’t you?” she asked.
“Yeah, I gotcha,” Jim said. He looked over at her, frowning, eyes thoughtful. “You gonna be okay?” he asked. “I mean, I don’t want to leave you--”
“Thanks,” Nia said. She ran a hand through her hair, smoothed out her uniform. She looked down at it, suddenly all too aware of the lack of a star on her placket. She had graduated; she should have a star. “I think.”
It went on this way for a little while, and Tony gamely hooted and hollered as his friends and acquaintances received their due recognition. He really perked up when Jan announced the award for best monster—
No such luck. Steve is standing there looking considerably more peppy than he had earlier (after he’d shamefacedly trekked over to ask the neighbor he’d barely exchanged three words with up until that point to rescue him from the wannabe-Aragog hanging out in his tub).
Nia shut her eyes. Jim. She didn’t have to look at him, she knew his voice, knew he was standing in his seat.
“And I knew it wasn’t going anywhere good,” Howard said, shaking his head. He picked at a gap in his teeth, as if he had a piece of food stuck between them. “I knew they didn’t want an electrical source, they wanted a weapon, they wanted a bigger, better version of the bombs we dropped to end the war, and I went through that once on my own. They--  none of them understand the toll it takes. You can’t live with yourself. You can’t wake up in the morning.”
Nia obeyed her father’s instruction, swallowing as her throat went dry. “What do you want me to do with it?” she asked.
Steve found the entire debate repugnant. He did not need to hear people argue to and fro about what heinous acts Bucky may or may not have performed and why, and he had no idea how Natasha could stand to listen to it for as long as it lasted before Lord Fury eventually ended the debate with finality. There had, after all, been a pre-existing threat against both prince and princess as the nearby realm of Asgard began to gear itself up for another terrible civil war. Political pawns were highly sought-after in these sorts of situations, and that was explanation enough for a disappearance rather than an outright assassination.
No, instead of helping Steve escape, Tony had dragged him to a stupid party filled with people he barely knew, all of them complete strangers to Steve. And Steve hadn’t even had fun; he’d just sat in his armchair, probably thinking about all the things he could be doing instead—
“Spider,” his neighbor mutters, and right. That sort-of explains the towel and the dripping hair and the water droplets trailing down over his taut, rippling—
Steve couldn’t stand it a second longer. He didn’t care that they had an audience, could not care one bit about what Prince Thor might think. He grabbed the back of Tony’s neck with both hands and pulled the other man into a kiss with a decade of love and longing in it, and half a year of frantic worry that he might never get the chance again. He was only distantly aware of Tony’s arms wrapping around his back and pressing their chests in tightly together – too focused on the feel of Tony’s mouth beneath him, the rough scrape of his beard, the silkiness of his wet hair tangled in Steve’s fingers.
“Sorry,” said Uncle Obie, as he pressed a hand to his forehead. “Sorry, sorry-- It feels like I’ve only just remembered not to call you ‘Annie,’ and it’s...Nia, now, isn’t it?”
Steve did not like to think of himself as a man who lacked objectivity. Still, he knew that sometimes his emotions clouded his judgment, and as far as he was concerned, his entire dalliance with Tony had been little more than a perfect example of this. Tony was beyond untouchable, a hopeless prospect… and yet his emotions chimed in and made everything needlessly difficult for both of them. After all, Steve was fairly certain that Tony’s infatuation with him would have died a quick and painless death years ago had Steve not encouraged it with his own poorly-concealed attraction.
“We’re not certain. Asgard is still in turmoil, and there is talk of another civil upheaval. It’s possible Fury is simply being overly cautious. I assure you though – he's taking no chances after the amount of time and effort he has put into arranging this marriage.”
“He’s beautiful,” she said, and then realized she’d said it out loud. She flushed, and stammered. “I mean. Uh--”
Steve had mixed feeling about the delay – on the one hand, to have Tony and Natasha marry would indeed give her the right to reign in her own kingdom. And though Lord Fury was an admirable regent, Steve would still infinitely prefer Natasha’s hand on the scepter, as it were.
“Did you just hear that?” Disgust asked, standing up from her seat, “His stomach just groaned, we can’t have Steve’s stomach groaning!”
Steve was waiting a bit anxiously by the time he saw Tony’s boat come around the corner and start heading back to shore, as he let out a breath of relief. Ok, he may be overreacting. He definitely didn’t want to be that type of friend – or person – who seemed like a protective parent instead of, well – a protective friend. Yea, he can’t really escape it. He just didn’t wanna seem controlling.
“Thank you so much,” Tony said to him, squeezing him as much as he could, “I – I love you, Rhodey. Please – oh, be our Godfather! Rhodey!” Tony exclaimed, leaning back to see his face.
How would he kill himself? There’s many ways that he thought would be fitting. But he bought a gun with him for a reason.
It was a few days later, and they left, boarding the private plane. It was mostly a quiet journey, Tony took the few hours mostly in a private room where he attempted to get some sleep.
“You know when we were on that mission in Ireland, and we were fighting a lot,” Steve began. Tony looked back and remembered, nodding.
“This little one will be proud of you too,” Steve looked down to her, her baby blue eyes looking between them. Their little girl.
OK, it had been a while since that revelation, but still – how did that happen? It made him more questioning than anything. He couldn’t well kill himself while there was still a mystery such as that playing over in his mind. Honestly.
Joy was in a heated argument with Anger, who was constantly hitting things like a spoilt child. Sadness was crying, watching sad memories, as usual. Fear was hiding underneath the control table, teeth chattering. Disgust had pictures of all the emotions up on the wall of the control centre, and was throwing darts at it.
?!” Steve lost it, yelling at the comms in front of him, before he scowled in disgust and threw it far away.
“I agree. It’s so sad. We need to protect him from the world. We still need to protect Steve from this world,” Sadness sighed.
“I don’t think. I’m pretty sure I know. It’s like – like I can’t escape it, now I’ve realised it, you know what I mean?”
No, it was definitely more the meaning of it. It would mean he’s fed up of feeling like this, ready to take the hard road and try and find some meaning to life. That seems pretty hard though.
She circled the house, back to the kitchen door, and found it locked. “Fuck,” she muttered. Jarvis must have gone to bed. She groaned, and walked around the house, looking for a first-floor window that was open, even a crack. She knew how to jimmy one open, or pick a lock, but Howard had installed his own impeccable security all around the house, and the only way to fool the alarms was to start with a door or window that was already open-- something she’d learned the hard way when she was fourteen.
One of the guards immediately set a knife against Stane’s throat, so close that if he swallowed too hard, its blade would likely break the skin. Stane went still, even as he glared mutinously up at Natasha.
She hadn't walked twenty paces when a light flashed in her eyes, a strange man shoved a microphone in her face.
“That would still require me to be, you know,” Tony gestured at himself. “Not feathered. Which won't happen if I'm not on the lake at sundown. And people might notice something amiss if I waddle down the aisle with a beak.”
Natasha’s heart beat thrice in a single second, and she fought not to show the reaction upon her face. “I understand, Prince Thor. Perhaps we should simply return to our ship, in the interests of continuing our investigations with the utmost haste.”
“I told them I liked too many things to narrow it down. I told them I was good at too many things. That I wasn’t ready to let go of any of the things I’m good at.”  She frowned. “I’m not a specialist, Auntie. It’s just not who I am. I can’t
Eventually they rounded a corner edging around the craggy mountainside – and saw the exact scene the villager had described. The once-packed dirt of the road was swirled with footprints, hoof-prints, and wheel marks, puddles of water already settling into the deep grooves. Most of the damage was haphazard and frenzied, but towards the edge of the road there were indeed vast scores in the mud that looked as though the carriage containing Tony, his parents, and Bucky had been pushed all the way to—and over—the edge. Where the carriage had clearly crashed through the treeline, the trunks of the little saplings at the apex of the cliff face had been snapped through or twisted right up out of the earth. There were no trees large enough to take the weight of the carriage this far up the mountainside, not at that steep, rocky edge.
Though quite abrupt and seemingly humorless at times, Coulson was nothing if not efficient. He soon had everyone present fanning out looking for survivors, for the prince – and the squire, though to him Bucky was clearly a secondary objective. Steve and Sam joined the others, trekking further down the side of the mountain, both tense and afraid and waiting in terrible anticipation for what they might find.
just outside the door to the bathroom and refusing to put even one toe over the threshold, which Tony manages to find both hilarious and obscurely charming despite himself. But no, he supposes Cherry Pie really has no room to judge him.
“Don’t you dare,” Nia whispered, feeling grateful for that one reporter, as if her reaction meant Nia wasn’t so unreasonable, after all. “Don’t you--”
She had left his office just in time to hear the squeal of the hinges on the secret door behind the bookcase in the dining room. Fearful of being caught, not wanting her father to know she knew about the secret door, she'd hid herself in the doorway to his office.
The car ride home was silent. Howard drove; Maria sat in the front. Nia sat in the back seat, crumpled up against herself, keeping her head low so she wouldn’t accidentally make eye contact with anyone in the rearview mirror.
As something of a compromise (though it was obviously benefiting Stane far less than anyone else, but Natasha and Lord Fury were clever that way), the Lady Potts was sent to live in Natasha’s castle and keep watch over Tony. His old friend was devastated with relief, and her prim and controlled façade showed deep cracks when she first laid eyes upon Tony in his guest bed. Tony was little more moved by Pepper than he had been by any of his other friends, which was at once a relief and a great disappointment. Steve had hoped that it was not simply him and their group of friends here that Tony took issue with. Perhaps—as Bucky was convinced—he really did blame them for his capture in the first place. But whatever the case, there was no real joy to be found in his blank expression upon greeting the misty-eyed Lady Pepper.
That wasn’t the only day Tony was particularly emotional. Pregnancy was somewhat a rollercoaster for him. Particularly as this seemed to be the first time a man on Earth had been impregnated by a pink alien. But then again, who knows.
Not long later, Jarvis popped up on his radar device, announcing that people were approaching from 20 metres away, and he turned round to see Steve arguing with
Thor had rounded up the magical troublesome pink-skin-coloured man-creature that had found its way to Earth and had left to take it away. He had been causing a small but increasing amount of mayhem, and had been sneaking around, causing trouble to people randomly here and there, and he even got into the tower before the avengers had been able to find him. The pink alien creature constantly evaded capture even in the tower, and Tony was, well, minorly panicking, it was minor – he even tried to grab the creature once, and it spat –
“Me too.” Steve looked to Tony’s lips and leaned in to kiss him, and Tony closed his eyes, lip-locking with Steve like he planned to never let go. Like, ever. A quick breathe in through his nose, and he leaned in deep. Their lips became stuck together, tongues moving slowly, noses bumping. And they had never been more content than being encased in each other; to just
Bruce went to get some equipment. He came back with the transducer and another wheelie machine with the screen on for the ultrasound.
“You know, there are other things we could be doing…” Tony said, looking off into the distance. Steve frowned at him, then his eyes widened, then he frowned again. What? What was that supposed to mean?!
Tony took a deep sip of his drink. He decided to go to his kitchen early, whip up a fabulous meal cooked by the finest chef in New York whom he had invited over, and then it was just…a meal. With a friend. With someone more than a friend. With Steve. He ended up just tidying things up in his private dining room, overlooking open doors to the balcony. He couldn’t really concentrate much. He was nervous.
him. His eyes shoot up to his eyebrows, as he sets a rhythm slow at first, and savours every fibre of every vein of Steve that he can feel inside of him, around him, and it fucking hurts for a few seconds, and then it’s so
“I mean, obviously this is a shock for us and, erm,” Tony sniffed, and wiped his eyes to try and control himself, as Steve tightened his arm around his waist in support, “this isn’t what I – obviously this isn’t what I – what
“Tony!” Steve cried, as he came rushing to his side, his eyes wide. Tony held onto Steve’s arm for support, and couldn’t speak just yet, as Steve patted him on the back and rubbing his neck, trying to help in any way.
“Tony!” He cried out, not able to stop the panic from blanketing his voice. He saw the door leading outside (more like a hole blown in the wall) and he saw more of the pieces and followed it out into the blinding sun.
“Yea, that’s perfectly natural, Steve, ok? You don’t have to feel like you have to fit in 100% with – well, this century. Anything you need my help with?” Tony doubted it.
“We’re a team, remember, Anger?” Joy said more softly, “We work together. But we don’t need much from you on this one. You don’t have to be in charge all the time. This isn’t a battle.”
“Now you wanna – what – control me? For my own ‘good’? I don’t get it, is this just a concept of yours-”
“Thank you for telling me, Steve, though I believe I already know of what you’re talking about. Sanctioning is something Tony is vehemently opposed to, but if it comes to it-”
“You can let go now,” Steve implied, as Tony was still holding on with his arms bent high above him, which made his black top rise even further, so Steve was mostly holding onto his skin.
He felt as if there wasn’t much, he could do – this isn’t really a burden they could share, and it would have been the same had Tony been a woman, or if Steve had ended up with a lady – it unnerved him. But still, he did what he could, which mostly involved intensely reading parenting books and getting pillows, food and vitamins for Tony to make sure he was comfortable and not doing too much work. Their life was about to change. In a good way, though, Steve had come to realise, as this meant he would truly feel like he wasn’t in a war anymore. That they could still be Avengers, save the world on occasion – and have a beautiful family to come home to and cherish, and nurture. He didn’t know how he had been this lucky.
“…So I just, um. I hope y-you get better. Even if it is just to shout at me. To reject me. I don’t care. Just wake up.
Steve got a little worried when Bruce and Natasha came back, and Bruce was saying that Tony shouldn’t be left alone right now.
“You don’t have to apologise, at least, for trying to figure yourself out. Besides, you’re still here.”
Steve frowned. “Well, duh, Churchill,” Steve scoffed a bit, smiling at the little joke. Ok, it might have gone out of fashion by now.
“You still feel the baby kicking around in there?” Steve asked, with a hand on Tony’s back, and one tentatively on his belly.
new jeans. It’s not a big deal, that’s just what happens, ok?” Steve soothed him, coming over to him by the mirror. “You’re carrying a baby. A growing baby. And I know that scares you-” Steve reached his arms around Tony’s waist, “but it’s gonna be okay. When this is all over, your favourite pair of jeans will probably still fit you. And if they don’t, that’s not a big deal either. We’ll get whatever fits, ok?” Steve pressed a kiss to Tony’s neck, “We’ll have to do some shopping, hmm. You look gorgeous anyway. Always will.”
“I have to say I agree, boss,” Happy said, appearing in the garage doorway, and Tony sighed. “Otherwise you’re gonna re-break something.”
“No, no! That’s not it!” Steve exclaimed, putting a hand on Tony’s arm to get him to stop inspecting himself and look up to him. “You – you look fine, trust me.” Tony raised an eyebrow. “I mean- better than fine! You look…nice. Good, um, y-yea, there is nothing wrong with-” He gestured Tony’s body in whole, “-any of that.”
They got into conversation easily enough. It seemed to flow between them, they didn’t talk over each other too much, but were polite, well, more on Steve’s side, and they could understand each other, funnily enough, and... it was
“I am! I just – I didn’t wanna hurt you, I never want to do that, I knew you probably felt differently but I wouldn’t have said anything and...”
... He heard some shuffling about behind him and peeked a look behind him to see Steve coming up to him, and he planted his feet down on the chair.
“I know,” Steve said uncomfortably, and he moved to sit down on a bar stool around the side of the counter. “Tony, I’ve genuinely always considered you a good friend, as well as the other Avengers and people I’ve worked alongside, even if it may not seem it. I know
It wasn’t until a few months later, when they first noticed their daughter’s eyes had turned brown. And, well, if she was slightly stronger than other babies at her age, that was for them to know.
She sighed, “Guess that’s what nearly every woman since the dawn of time has had to go through. Now you know how they feel,” Natasha says, flicking through her magazine.
“Look, Steve, we can probably ignore this, OK? I’m sorry, but I don’t think I’m the guy for you. You have the whole world. Go have fun.” Tony patted Steve’s shoulder, and began walking away.
“Ok, well you’re actually touching on ethical egoism there.” Steve looked confused. “I read a bit about, erm, ethics and philosophy,” Tony said casually, or trying to sound casual, “You know, just light reading, really…But yes, I. Understand. Your point.”
“I doubt he would be able to carry you out if this one,” Steve said, his voice muffled as he bent down and let Tony go, his feet landing on the ground safely, though more reluctantly letting go of Tony’s butt, and Steve stood up again.
Tony had become a bit antsy of late. When Steve would try and coax him out of his work, or even woo him, Tony just got annoyed or snappy at him and said he wanted to be left alone in peace. He grumpily accepted the food Steve had brought him and nearly always got munching on it right away. Steve was either reading or doing training when he wasn’t at Headquarters, and sometimes Sam came round to the tower to stop for a few days, so they could do that together as well, talking about training new initiates, and what else was new, so he kept busy.
“Captain Rogers, are you able to perform CPR rescue breathing?” Friday’s cool voice filtered through a fractured bit of Tony’s suit somewhere.
it, most of the time, and it really puts things into perspective, you know?” Tony was saying, getting it out of his system, apparently. Natasha was the chosen victim.
“Tony-” Steve managed to say, “What is it? Are you alright? God, I did-didn’t mean to, it-it was too much.” He raked a hand across his face. “Tony, talk to me. Please.” He felt so bad, he wanted to
? But he couldn’t do anything. He was paralysed, like in a dream, like he was dying, even floating in a bottomless pit sometimes, and other times contrastingly rigidly still, and it was
Tony took his hand and slowly slid it down Steve’s arm to his hand, and held it closer to his body, biting his lip. “Does anything feel wrong, Rogers?”
“Yes, Steve, I do have the power to do that and it is a possibility if it means keeping my patient safe. But I have faith in his…support team.”
Steve whispered to Tony, “Is a caesarean one of those things that is now much safer and has a much less chance of you dying horrifically during childbirth?” He asked worriedly. Tony smiled affectionately.
“He’s worried,” she explained, and Tony turned away, “And, the other day he told me he wants to be a feminist but doesn’t wanna be turned into a woman, and then spent approximately three minutes apologising and trying to tell me how great it was to be a woman.”
“No, Steve, it’s fine… I appreciate the gesture. You really sure there’s nothing wrong?” He asked, smiling slightly slyly.
“Gee, calm down cowboy,” Tony said back, “I thought that it’d be good to, you know, get away for a while. Beach, boating, little quaint towns, you know? I have a really nice villa, a call-in maid and chef, it’s in a really nice area, there’s a beach…”
“I’m ok, Steve,” he told him, managing to smile at him to alleviate his concern. “Feeling a little faint and breathless is not uncommon, ok? I’d tell you if I thought something was wrong. I’ll tell Bruce later when he gets back.”
“We’re still not calling her Margaret,” Tony said with finality, and turned away from Steve’s inevitable goldfish-face look.
. So, naturally, to calm himself down, or do the exact opposite, he found a willing person to have sex with. Because. No.
“Of course, oh – please, call me Steve.” Sandy smiled at him, and sat down, and he sat down next to her.
“I knew I liked you as soon as we met, before I knew I had met my soulmate. I was really disappointed when I realised it wasn’t going to be you, but then I saw your other wing – I forgot only one of yours is natural…and – y'know, I could paint it for you.”
“Yea, that’s fine,” Bruce said, squeezing some of the gel on Tony’s stomach. He took a deep breath, looking nowhere in familiar, and as Steve looked at him he took Tony’s hand in his own, grasping it tightly. Tony smiled thinly at him, trying not to show his worry.
“Tones,” Rhodey said, and Tony looked up, his eyes puffy and expression vulnerable, “You’re gonna be alright,” he said in his soothing voice, “Nothing bad’s gonna happen to you, ok? We got the best people here, Thor’s gonna make good on his word to find out what he can, and we’re all going to be here for you. I swear, man.”
“So you’re going ahead with it as planned? Nine months, giving birth, the whole deal?” Natasha asked.
“Look, guys this is still pretty new, ok? We’re learning about this as much as we can, and what we do know, stays between everyone in this room.”
you make a good point,” Tony nodded absentmindedly, leaning on the counter as he took as sip of his coffee.
, we’re by the lake.” Tony was looking worse, and Steve rested his hand on his back, as Tony suddenly coughed again, and he spit blood out. Steve heard the quinjet coming, and looked around wildly.
“What? I know the drill! Smile, a lot, laugh at his jokes, compliment him, talk about happy things, relish in his joyful smile-”
Tony found a nice secluded bay – not big beaches, but just nice hills around him, quiet, and the water was just the nice side of lukewarm when he tested his fingers in it. There was a light breeze, and he felt so much freer in this place. Like he had no responsibilities. Not that he wouldn’t want that. But he’d been feeling less of it lately. He sat back down on the seat on his boat, and pulled at his light t-shirt. He probably wouldn’t be stripping down to his shorts on the beach anytime soon, but that was okay.
“My therapist says I need to step out of my comfort zone a bit. Doing this step-by-step therapy that involves, uh, you know, physical touch bla-bla-bla. Whaddya think, wanna – hug it out?” Tony asked uncertainly, and stepped round the counter to open his hands out for a hug. Steve smiled, and went straight into Tony’s arms, squeezing his arms around his waist gently.
“Friday, send Steve up,” Tony ordered, “And I want some of those nice strawberries and cream things…Pretty please?”
“Yes, you 13-year-old dork,” Tony said. It was in a jokey way though, so Steve decided not to be too offended.
Steve cleared his throat, trying to hide his insecurities, and moved onto a new topic of conversation.
He crashed onto the floor and coughed out the sick, some of it getting stuck in this throat, and he started to choke.
“No. Now, Pepper’s meeting me there for a day to catch up on business stuff. But apart from that, I have a free schedule.”
It wasn’t until about a week later, and around three months after the alien creature had been on Earth, when Friday detected something resembling foreign, potentially
“Er…” Tony stuttered, then Rhodey came from behind him and said they needed to go, “No, I er – Rhodey’s taking me, it’s fine, Cap.”
Steve reaffirmed his grip on Tony’s thighs and butt to thrust in and out effortlessly, but still with enough vigour for Tony to cry out in pleasure when he hit the right spot every time, speeding up his pace but not with too much strength-
As she circled the house, coming back to the front and fast running out of window options, she stumbled, and realized how tired she was-- suddenly, feeling heavy and slow and clumsy, she rubbed at her head, felt a languid ache in her legs and back.
Satisfied, Clint nodded and swung his bow up onto his back with a playful spin. He pointed an accusatory finger at the bird. “And don’t you try anything once my back is turned.”
Steve squinted in the dim moonlight in the direction Sam was pointing, and could just make out the unmistakable blackness of charred wood on the trees whose trunks were remaining. The villager had not been exaggerating: each of them did indeed appear as though torched by a great bolt of lightning.
They’ve reached the main doors out of the building and Steve steps forward to effortlessly pull the right one open, as though it doesn’t weigh as much as Tony does—only to hold out a hand and indicate that Tony go ahead of him.
She pored through the rack with growing delight-- the clothing was far nicer, far more sophisticated than anything she’d worn at home, and all, as Maria promised, in beautiful, bright colors.
Across the table, Steve is still smiling crookedly at him; he’s so obviously pleased with himself and with Tony, with the success of his hilarious plan to get Tony hooked in. Steve and his eyelashes—which are, he notes, as beautiful here as they had been in the hallway outside his apartment. Tony has no idea why Steve had picked him, of all people, to try to impress.
Thor eyed her reluctantly, but came to his decision quickly and nodded in the direction of the door. “Perhaps a more private setting then, Princess. Your man is welcome to join us.”
“Sure,” Nia said, rolling her eyes. “Let’s not tell our daughter about the element named after her or the war hero in the walk-in freezer in the basement.”
Jim and Carol were trading kisses on each other’s noses. Nia looked away, flushing, feeling like she was invading their privacy, even if they were the ones doing it right in front of her.
and not even doing that right.” He shook his head softly, like he hadn’t just dealt Steve a mortal blow to the heart. “No wonder nothing ever happened, here.”
By the following year, the war in Asgard had died down after what everyone hoped was a lasting resolution was reached. The notoriously haughty kingdom did not care to lower itself to communicate with the lesser mortals of the surrounding kingdoms, nor did Jötunheim bother with such pleasantries, but after months passed with no signs of recurring aggression, all the lands of Midgard breathed a great sigh of relief.
The next summer was their last before Tony finally married Natasha, and he was fully prepared for a rather less than cheerful greeting from Bucky when he arrived at the castle. Instead, Bucky was waiting for Tony at the marina when his ship docked, and Tony froze in place on the gangplank when he saw him.
“Nia, this is Doctor Yinsen,” Howard said, as Nia shook the man’s hand. “He’s one of our top researchers in the local facility.”
He was not too proud to admit that he had led a charmed life as a prince, sole heir to the throne of a small but very wealthy kingdom, and it was no exaggeration to say that never before in his life had he felt a pain even marginally approaching that of shifting between the two bodies.
is. Never mind what’s actually going on,” Tony admitted, considering turning on the lights but not sure it would help the situation.
She frowned, and reached out for it-- it was a cable or a tube, painted white like the edifice of the house, but glossier, coated in rubber, and flexible. She crawled further into the bushes, until she was flush up against the side of the wall, and traced her finger down the length of the cable, until it abruptly changed directions ninety degrees, running downward and entering the house through a small opening in a partially-recessed window.
Behind her, Nancy had drawn her service pistol, pointing it at the assailant with trembling hands. "St--stop!"  She stammered. "Stop or I'll shoot!"
“That’s it!” Clint yelled, reaching behind him for his bow and then nocking an arrow. “Back off, you stupid bird.”
He chased those thoughts back, because they were selfish and useless, and there were more important things to worry about than his heartbreak.
“No,” Howard said. “His heart’s fine. Everything’s fine. His vitals are perfect. We just haven’t been able to revive him.”
“Janet!” he yelled back, miming a high-five across the room. She returned it sloppily, and he laughed at the look on her face when she accidentally slapped her ride on the bat-ear and knocked the mask askew.
Thor shook his head somewhat despairingly. “Loki’s mind is far afield. I cannot guess at his plans. But he is now imprisoned in Asgard once more, without the considerations provided to him before as a prince. He shall not escape again.”
As soon as he saw it, Tony hissed royally at him, rearing back in mock-betrayal – and Steve started laughing.
Jim caught her looking at him, or looking in his direction, to be precise, her vision moving in and out of focus as she played back memories in her head.
standing there, stern-faced and unreadable. Howard was in his full dress uniform; Maria was in a grey suit with pearls-- both looking very much like they’d dressed to attend a formal event.
“Steve’s in stasis,” Howard answered. “He’s been left alone for weeks before. Jarvis checks on him if necessary.”
She leaned back against Ty's chest for a moment before she remembered herself and pulled back, standing beside him more properly, though she offered him a hand. "I'd make a terrible leader, Captain," she retorted, sticking her tongue out.
She stared at the coats and let out a choked laugh. Her skin tingled, came alive at the sudden rush of warm air against it, and she sagged against one wall of the hallway.
“Well, that was…” Bruce fidgeted with the strap of his bag. “Nice. But I meant confessions of love, not kisses. Folktales don’t get everything right.”
He looked younger than she’d ever imagined him-- though she supposed he’d only been a few years older than she was when he’d died.
To his grief, Steve had been right about Bucky’s arm. The town doctor, Bruce, had been forced to remove it once they had cut off the remainder of Bucky’s jerkin and shirt and seen the terrible extent of the damage. His friend’s left arm now ended in a bundled stump a bare finger’s length from his armpit. Steve could not bring himself to sit on that side, but Natasha had no such compunctions. She was there at Bucky’s hip almost as much as Steve was, though she had numerous duties around the castle that could not be delegated indefinitely.
“Fuck you, Ty,” Nia spat into the phone. She was hot; her face was red. She could feel her breath getting heavy. She looked at her mother, who was watching impassively, and her stomach turned at the thought that Maria might have any clue what Ty was saying. She knew Maria couldn’t hear, but she wondered if her own reaction, if her body language was giving it away.
she had always been. She saw a collection of her parents’ traits, jumbled together awkwardly, in a way she’d never grown into. She had her mother's hair-- dark and fine and wavy, falling into loose curls around her shoulders, her mother’s golden-brown skin and fine bone structure, and her father's sharp nose, too large for her face, and his greyish-blue eyes.
He worked himself up further and further as the dark hours went on, until it was a little before sunrise and sleep had abandoned him all night, and he could not stand it any longer. He felt fury radiating through his bones, pulsing in his chest, and he finally gave in and swung out of bed.
It was nighttime, the drawing room lit only with sconces and the great big fireplace beside them, glowing amber and warm and cozy, and the pair of them danced wildly over the floorboards. Their hair and clothes were flashing in the firelight, and their mouths were smiling with joy as they clapped and spun about each other’s elbows. They looked like carefree townspeople. Bucky and Steve really were townspeople, Tony realized then, and had to have taught Natasha how to dance like that.
“As for Prince Anthony,” Natasha said pointedly, when Thor drooped. “We believe your brother to be responsible for his disappearance.”
And then Ty was there, standing next to her, his smile warm and reassuring, and he clasped her hand in his.
“Steve,” she murmured, seeing his face. She pressed a hand to his cheek, tried to wipe out his ears and-- with a bit of hesitation-- his nostrils. “Come on, Steve. Why won’t you wake up? We’re all waiting for you to wake up,” she said.
She checked her watch: it was nine; which meant they’d been in the air for eleven hours. She set the watch ahead nine hours, to the local time at their destination. It was six in the morning; she was wide awake, and she smiled at how conveniently she’d managed to wake up at the proper time, after more than enough sleep.
Nia followed her mother in. Howard waited in the doorway, in the hall where it wasn't quite so freezing cold. It wasn't so bad with the coat on-- she was still cold, but not uncomfortable.
But he didn’t have an envelope in his hand; she must be walking too quickly. She bit her lip and slowed her gait, waiting for him to pick up her envelope.
Ty wiped the damp mark off his cheek and grinned down at her. “Will you accept my humble apology?” he asked, dropping a kiss on her nose as he tugged at the hem of her tee shirt.
Natasha was there as usual when his carriage drew near, waiting for him just inside the castle wall. She broke into a smile when she saw him get out of the carriage, and Tony had just enough time to notice that Lord Fury was nowhere to be seen before she struck his front and wrapped her arms tightly around him.
Bucky dutifully accompanied them to the docks, but not before sending Steve a few dirty glares. Though nobody knew exactly what had taken place between Steve and Tony the night before, they all seemed to have some idea. Natasha, in particular, kept sending Steve very narrow looks; but she was too preoccupied with sending Tony and the other visitors off to follow through on the threat. Sam seemed oddly… disappointed with the coldness that had sprung up between Steve and Tony, while Clint just looked tired of the whole affair.
Nia opened the folder, but barely had time to glance at the schematics before she stopped, looked up at her father, and tried to speak.
Maria's face appeared at the door, and she raised an eyebrow, crossing her arms over her chest. "Well, it's definitely been an eventful day," she observed. "Is that what the screaming was about? You met Steve?"
He wanted to run from the room, but he was deeply rooted and simply frozen on the chaise, with the heraldry book open on his lap. It surely would hurt nobody but him if he were to simply enjoy Tony as he was now. Tony shone like the rising sun, red and gold and bright, and though it was painful, Steve could hardly tear his eyes away.
Sam was muttering something Steve could not make out, but he could guess none of it was terribly flattering. “We decided to let you handle this, Steve,” he finally blurted. “Let you take this at your own pace. But this has gone far enough. You
“How can I be happy that you have to marry that—that—” His words abandoned him, and he just made an infuriated gesture with his arms. “You should be upset! You should demand that you be allowed to marry Bucky! You're going to be the queen! You—”
Tony’s eyes were open, a little dazed, but they were open – and they were sparkling at Steve, dancing with joy. He was obviously still feeling weak, probably in still in great pain. He was filthy, and covered in blood, and soaking wet – and Steve should get him out of the water, and the wind, just as soon as he heard what Tony had said.
Queen Maria was a sharp woman who went as soft as ermine when faced with her only child. Despite her distant demeanor, Tony was clearly fond of her. Though the queen was generally expected to keep her own company with her ladies-in-waiting, she did not want for invitations to join Tony, Natasha, and even Sam sometimes on gentle rides around the fields. They whiled away many days on these outings, and many more saw them eating lunches from carefully prepared picnic baskets, lazing down by the creek in the afternoon breeze.
A few weeks later the bubble of Thor and the troublemaker alien had died down, and now it was just Steve and Tony again, enjoying their alone time together in the tower.
“No, I mean, this is quality work, seriously, Rogers, it’s – it’s amazing. Honestly. I don’t know what else to say – I just didn’t expect it...”
“Well, you should show me some of yours too. It would only be fair,” Tony said, looking up to Steve’s eyes. Steve kissed him again.
Steve nodded, and grimaced goodbye as she left the room and he was left alone, looking out the window on the other side of the room, and shuffling his hands on the bed next to Tony’s limp hands, hoping, waiting, not knowing what to do or what to say.
“Sandy!” Steve finally matched to catch her, Tony’s therapist, as she turned around as she was on her way out of the lobby.
“It – it was just – I’m sorry, I think it was a nightmare and I must have acted out-” Steve was trying to explain while Tony was staring at said bed, in the room of his villa that Steve had been occupying.
“Steve,” Bruce called, trotting in the sand towards them, and they looked up, arms shielding them in the sunlight.
“Dammit, Rogers!” Tony huffed angrily, pacing and stopping to stand in the middle of the living room while Rogers stood just the other side of the nice white sofa. Safest bet in an argument between them to have something between them.
“Yes, yes, come on…” She rooted them on. Tony breathed for air, looked into his eyes, then they came together again, melting into one.
His tanned, golden skin shone, his low-waist trousers hanging on tightly to his hips, highlighting his curves and accentuating his butt perfectly, of which Tony may or may not be aware of. Steve wanted to tell him either way.
“What?” Steve asked. Just then, Rhodey knocked on the window and they turned to look at him. Turns out he’d been listening a bit in on their conversation, with the door being a little open.
Tony took in a deep breath, filling up his lungs, only a slight ache in his healing ribs, before slowly letting it out again, tapping his finger against his thigh.
Steve sighed and rubbed Tony’s thumb where he was squeezing his hand. Tony’s defence mechanisms in a stressful and painful situation seemed to be just endless sarcasm.
“I gotta say, it feels a bit redundant saying goodnight and going to different rooms, when we’re only one floor away from each other,” Steve smiled.
“Ah,” Tony said, looking content as he came over to it, looking quickly inside the box, made sure it was securely shut and put it in Dum-E’s hands.
“Tony? Oh my god. Nurse! Please…” He called out, and pressed the button on his bed to get their attention.
The next morning, after pondering through the night with not much sleep and an energised jog, Steve was relaxing in the kitchen area when an unknown man, looking tired in sleepy clothes came to get some coffee.
“I mean…y-you look gorgeous,” Steve said, without really thinking, but he didn’t regret it, because it was true. Tony’s surprised face only highlighted that he was right to say it.
“He’s not breathing!” He exclaimed, but he could only hear buzzing through the other side, meaning the others were in combat, “Guys?”
“Uh…why… why?!” Fear pleaded with no one in particular. Disgust rolled her eyes, but Sadness’ crying
“Finally, he decides to speak,” Clint’s dry voice came through. Steve looked over to Tony, who looked up at him. He looked rough.
“Maybe we work too much, you and I. Doing all the hard work and labour, I mean… We should do something fun, just the two of us,” Tony suggested. Steve was absently nodding, sifting through. Tony wanted to do something fun. As friends. That sounded great.
He was pretty sure ‘grouchiness’ wasn’t a side effect of some medication he was taking, as it hadn’t been before, and generally he’s not that grumpy, so maybe he really did just need more sleep, like Steve said – not that he would tell him that. From then on he
– soundproof. Steve couldn’t sleep even the first night, where he went downstairs and out to their small beach in the moonlight for a while. It was beautiful. And when he came back in, and walked to his room, he heard Tony cry out, presumably from a nightmare. Steve hesitated outside his door. He wanted to help, he hated the thought of Tony suffering alone, and his heart ached in empathy. He knocked lightly on the door.
to convince him it was okay, and their lesser embarrassed obstetrician to reassure him as well. Honestly.
Yep. They had sex. Tony and this man had sex. Maybe they even did it more than once. Maybe they do it a lot.
He bites his lip and walks around a bit, his sandals scraping across the grass. It’s really warm and Tony decides his heart hurts a little too much. It’s got physical scars, sure – his heart, being intact, is in itself a miracle – but it’s the ones you can’t see that hurt the most, for some reason.
The emotions wore old clothes, like Steve did back in the day. Their control room was somewhat military-like with a radio in the back, war-bunker style tables and chairs, but it was also relaxed, with American flags in random places and helpful arrow signs for the emotions to navigate.
But this was the first time he had ever touched Tony’s lips with his own, and he never would have expected it to be like this.
Bruce came over to them. “I need to run a few more tests. Everything looks good so far,” he said, pleased. Tony nodded, and Bruce leaned over as Tony carefully handed his new-born over into Bruce’s gentle arms, as he smiled down at her, and cooed at her while taking her away to a temporary cot to do a cheek swab and the like.
“I don’t know, but I don’t care,” Tony smiled, and looked around, then back to his best friend, “So? Will you?”
Just then, the door to the elevator opened and Steve came in, Dum-e whizzing ahead of him with a wobbly plate of strawberries and cream.
“Steve, I’m not gonna let yourself get killed!” Tony said angrily through his suit, stepping in front as he turned around and put a hand on Steve’s chest to stop him going further, Steve flaring his nostrils stubbornly.
He leant down again, now hearing calls through the comms, but he didn’t care. He shot a powerful breath through Tony’s lips, and the breath went straight down his throat, getting past what was stuck in his windpipe, and sending oxygen to his lungs.
They were trying their hardest, but so many thoughts and ideas and possibilities and outcomes went through Tony’s head at any given time took a toll on the emotions. Sometimes the emotions tried to take charge, to get things in order, but it was hard and all the emotions were tired at this point – but dammit, they tried, and sometimes that was enough to get Tony by. Just about.
Steve said, quietly but so it could clearly be heard in the small hospital room, with light pouring in the window, showing the countryside outside.
“No, Steve, what’s the point?” Tony cried, lifting his head up. “Yea, I’m up the duff. Happy, are we?” Everyone sobered quite quickly, seeing the look on Tony’s face. “And I haven’t…grown any women’s parts if that’s what you’re all thinking.” Tony wiped his nose with his hand and looked down, resting his elbows on his knees. Bruce swallowed and cleared his throat.
“No, Steve, I told you already!” Tony said agitatedly. “God, can’t you leave me alone for a second?” Tony was aware he was getting angry, but he was just fed
The next day, some of the emotions were talking about what they think could be going through Steve’s mind. Obviously, it was a mystery why he seemed to like Tony. Very strange. Joy, unfortunately, was not allowed to participate much in the discussion.
Tony, however, he feared wasn’t taking it as well. Naturally, the pregnancy had of course taken its toll on him, which was expected, and he did assure Steve he wanted this child, and Steve knew they were going to be great parents if they worked together. He only hoped they could.
Tony nods, oddly reassured by the promise that was easily made, the realisation that Steve’s not going to leave, nor ask for anything in return. He’s pretty sure of that, for some reason.
to get some more sleep; one night he drifted off nearly as soon as he hit the pillows, throwing Steve’s arm off once or twice because he was too hot. Steve was annoying in bed sometimes. Tony suspected that Steve was conscious of this, but again, his mood
No, he’s not backing out of it anymore, he just wants to be sure before he commits to the decision. Cause, you know. It’s you know, a big decision to make, really, he tells himself. But then he thinks, looking over the waves of the water and the beautiful way the sun beams on it, that he just doesn’t want to live. Anymore. So, the alternative is death.
“O…kay,” Clint looked at him with wide eyes as he slowly slid around in his seat, setting the route.
Anyway, Tony’s mood and spirits seemed to get slightly better in the next few weeks. Steve was glad, and pleased that Tony had been sleeping better and was less annoyed by him. They still argued sometimes – just not as heatedly, and Steve really felt quite good about it.
Steve nods, showing he understands, or at least mostly, and continues eating his cheesecake. It was really good. And shop-bought. Oh well. Everything’s so easy just to buy these days, without need for preparation.
“If I – could – only – press the – optimism-” Joy struggled, but Anger was holding her back. All the emotions had been against her being in control for a
“Ok, Steve,” Sandy levelled with him, and looked him firmly in the eye, “I can’t discuss much of this with you, I’m afraid. You are of course, in your rights to tell me, in fact it’s encouraged to tell me of the dangers posed to my patients, especially since you are one of the contacts Tony has down.”
“No,” He whispered back, winding his hand around Tony’s waist to pull him closer, as Tony gasped slightly. “This doesn’t feel bad at all… And I think I know what we can do,” he said, brushing his nose against Tony’s, as those brown eyes slide shut, the only sound his breathing, as Steve rubbed his hand across Tony’s skin, and licked his lips as he brushed them by Tony’s nose, and Tony lifted his chin slightly so he finally captured Steve’s lower lip, pulling it gently down to him, his hands coming up to Steve’s neck.
“Sadness!” She looked up in attention, “Do not ruin this for us, ok? You will stay quiet, unless in the rare possibility we need to pull you out.”
“While you sit down and work on your therapist’s notes that you said she had for you?” Steve compromised.
Once Tony was sure he was breathing properly and wouldn’t be sick again or choke any time soon, he breathed a sigh of relief and leaned heavily on Steve, who still looked alarmed and just put his arms around him firmly.
to find out.” Tony got off the medical chair and came over to the screens next to Bruce, “Friday, whaddya got?”
“No, don’t worry about it,” Tony said, getting back up with Steve’s support, and sitting back down heavily again, “Probably just something I ate, maybe a stomach bug.”
, and reassuring. And it was something he could get used to. Right now, the knot inside his chest was beginning to loosen, knowing that Tony was gonna be alright, as they took him somewhere he could get better, safe, and Steve would finally be able to breathe again.
“Hospital,” he said simply. Steve’s face blanched and turned to concern, but before he could ask, Tony explained, “Just a check-up, don’t worry.”
“Okay,” Tony replied happily, and his lips curved into a small, pleased smile. Joy smiled as well, glad that it finally seemed to be going in the right direction. Love island was glowing, and it was about time.
“Focus in, that’s it, FOCUS!” Joy shouted at the screen, where Tony was looking at Steve with a fond expression, a hint of fear and wonder as well, “Somebody sketch him, quickly, I need this face etched into my mind.”
“Right, well - look, it’s a difficult topic to discuss, Miss – Sandy, but if Tony has not told you already, he is not in a good place right now. And not just that, but he’s a danger to himself, and though I don’t wanna break his trust, he didn’t tell me
“That concealer really isn’t doing much for those bags under his eyes, you know what I mean?” Disgust said. Joy rolled her eyes.
One time, Tony called out to Steve, and Steve had smiled brightly and come over to him, but then it went blurry and fuzzy and he realised it was probably a dream. His mind was getting achy. And when he was awake, he also realised he was in pain in several parts of his body, and he damn hoped they had him on pain meds.
“Um…” Steve sat down, and dragged the chair closer to Tony, looking into his eyes, as he smiled back, his hair ruffled, with a thin tube attached through his nose. He was doing better.
“How is it…possible?” Maria asked, scrunching up her face. Maybe it was an uncomfortable question. But she was just so curious. They all were.
Tony had seen Captain America’s great blue wings turn white at the congregation he was holding. In a room full of people, and his presence just
have much to lose at this point. Steve’s dark blonde hair flutters in the wind and his tank top looks ridiculously tight on him. But he’s here. And neither of them is perfect and they were both wrong to make judgements of each other so quick.
, to keep beating and breathing as he stayed with him, and preferably keep clenching his hand back too. Cause it felt warm, and
“Yes, I’m aware Tony invited you all to come along,” Sandy said, and thought about what to say next, about what Tony had told the others about their meetings, “And yes, I visit Tony weekly, but I occasionally have other business in the Tower, so that may be why you see me about.”
Instead, Tony gave him a brief frown and then a weak smile, and a splinter of uncertainty lodged in Steve’s chest.
Tony looked hurt for a moment, and Steve had time in that one moment of Tony’s soft, pained expression to feel years’ worth of regret and horror at himself, and he wished he could take it back.
An older, balding man Steve assumed to be Lord Stane was the first out of the carriage, followed by Tony himself. And despite the fact that Tony was his crown prince, Lord Stane walked boldly in front of him to greet Lord Fury formally, then Natasha. When he bent to lasciviously kiss Natasha’s knuckles, Steve was certain he was not the only one who shuddered in near-revulsion. That business done with, the man ignored Steve, Bucky, and Sam entirely, and Steve’s quick exchange of looks with the others indicated a similar relief across the board. Lord Fury and Lord Stane soon departed together, which left them all to greet Tony in peace.
Suppressing his sudden desire to act even brattier than usual to incite further use of That Voice, Tony flapped his hand dismissively at Steve. “Science doesn’t sleep, Cookie Monster.”
She turned toward the wall of dials and sensors. His breathing was shockingly slow; his heart rate just as minimal.  All of the readings, on all of the dials, seemed impossibly low-- low, but present. His brainwaves--
“—Unless we would have found him if there had there not been a double chained up in the cells,” Natasha finished, her green eyes widening.
Steve and Bucky returned a little later than they had been due, just over five weeks after Tony arrived at the castle. And Tony knew immediately that something was wrong with Steve. They all maintained their composure when the two young men rode into the castle courtyard, a large audience there simply because it was a highly public place. Natasha formally welcomed them both back to her home and invited them in for the afternoon meal. Tony grasped both of their arms in turn – but while Bucky gave Tony a pleased smile, Steve noticeably did not look him in the eye.
Steve drew Tony from every possible angle but never let him see the drawings, and he got to know Tony’s face better than any other person he had ever met. The straightness of his narrow nose, apart from the slight curve up at its tip, his thin but pouting lips, his aggressively strong chin, disordered eyebrows and glowing brown eyes. Steve could draw Tony’s face from memory now, imagine his smiles, picture his scowls: keeping it all stored inside himself this time, for when Tony was gone.
“Well, at first you were too young,” Howard answered. “And then I was a shitty father. I didn’t want to saddle you with my ghosts.”
If anything, that seemed to make Steve sink even lower. Tony narrowed his eyes at him, curious and a little hurt, and maybe even a little unaccountably guilty. He certainly hadn’t heard any complaints from Steve about their apparent domestic bliss. Not until now. Was he having some sort of gay monster midlife crisis?
Thor looked at her placidly, as they walked astride. “I would imagine Clint is not the only one here who is proficient in the act of espionage, Princess. Think not that I cannot see you manufacturing emotions for me to read on your face.”
“As for why he may have targeted the Starks, I fear there may be little more at work than the fact that Prince…
That if Tony had been there before, he would still be there now, as the traitor and whoever else was in on his disappearance believed they were safe, with their impostor firmly in place.
“I’ll send you horrible care packages full of stickers and stale cookies,” Nia warned, and she kissed Carol, and then Jim, on the cheek, hugged them both again, and let them get back into the car.
Her touch dragged it down...and then she saw hair, limbs, the blue of a uniform, a glassy-eyed expressionless stare, and threads of crimson flowing from the hole in the center of the forehead.
Tony was rumpled as well, but Steve had been far too overwhelmed to make anything of his clothing except wrinkle it. His hair was a shock around his head, lit by the fireplace behind him into a glowing gold disk. Steve was ashamed of how much he wanted to return to kissing Tony, how much he desired to ruck up Tony’s expensive tunic and feel the skin of his stomach, perhaps set his mouth to it…
Steve remembered that feeling of a weak heart from his frail youth, and made certain that Tony was not made to feel defective for it.
The amphitheater was slowly emptying of people. Jim and Carol would have marched out with the rest of the graduates, whether or not they had wanted to. Unlike Ty, they had the good sense not to make a scene.
Instead he found that he had exited the building in which he had been kept, with no locked doors or iron gates to impede him. His boots were soon thudding across grass, soggy and muddy, the early evening air cool against his skin but not enough, not nearly enough to counteract the burning
-Stark,” she muttered. “I'd say the same, but I can't see you at all," Nia finished, immediately regretting the attempt to be clever when her throat burned.
Had Steve had his way, Tony would not have left his sight for weeks after his return. Since Steve was not, unfortunately, even remotely the highest-ranking person interested in Tony’s rescue, he had very little say in the following events.
The previous night, Pepper had spoken with the most longstanding member of Tony’s household, and without telling him too much about the actual magic and treachery involved, Pepper convinced Lord Stane to keep his prince occupied until after the wedding had started. They did not want to risk the impostor causing a fuss, and Lord Stane’s authority should help enforce the delay without them needing to resort to violence. And Pepper disguised the odd request with concerns about another attack on the prince at the wedding, saying that someone would be there to escort ‘Tony’ to the hall as soon as they were certain it was safe. Lord Stane agreed wholeheartedly, clearly concerned but willing to do what was necessary.
