The ‘Steve box’ was pretty full by now, bursting with postal cards and long handed letters, key chains and random funny gadgets that Steve had gifted him for the past year since they parted ways in New York. The Captain had taken to sending him these things, by traditional postal service no less, after Tony had started to randomly check in on him. He wasn’t stalking the man, but he was still from the forties and running around by himself in the twenty-first century, someone had to keep an eye on him. So after the third time he had called the land line of the most recent dingy, roadside dinner the Captain had stopped to eat at, Steve had decided to make matters more simple and just send him a memento of every place he visited.
Thor bit his cheek, lips pursed as he set his inner turmoil to rights enough to whisper: “Odin has staked my hand in marriage as a prank on Earth”
Steven nodded sagely; his face carefully blank before Odin’s flattering remarks.
The Queen startled “Director”
And then the sounds began.
Thor laughed heartily at the fumbling quip and laid a steadying hand on the Captains shoulder. “If you succeed to lift it. I will happily wear the gown”
Steven.
And he promptly punched Thor in the throat.
As Thor’s steps faded in the long corridors of the dungeons, Loki crawled to a sitting, bruised ribs aching as he reclined on the cold slab of stone. He gave a sigh and closed his eyes, willing his magic to sooth his hurts now that his mind was free of the fog of rage that so often overtook him. Scaring even himself at the intensity of it.
“I think we can listen to this one later”
Steve found Pepper Potts standing a few paces outside the common room doors, face pale and stony as she pierced her wide blue eyes with his, completely aware of the wet gleam of his kiss swollen lips, a bit of beard burn stinging his mouth, and wasn’t that a strange feeling?
“I’ll miss you there, but I understand”
The Captain sighed deeply, his eyes rising to meet his teammates in a painstakingly honest gaze “Thank you for coming”
The Captain clenched his jaw as the bells rang up high, announcing invasion, each ring increasing the threat of the attack and Thor swallowed thickly, calling through their bond once more.
“Talk to me Steven” Thor prompted the blond man, his eyes gripping the man’s blue gaze in a firm hold “Please”
“You are not wearing a dress to your wedding, Thor”
“You be quiet, Loki!” Thor thundered, his mind racing now, his traitorous body heating with the implications of Loki’s words. If that were true, then his dear Steven was…
Steven smiled his trademark smile, the smile that had won million of hearts over the decades and made thousands of men march to war at his command. All honest and earnest American charm as he voiced: “I’m really happy for the two of you… I mean that Tony”
The dam had broken, and soon… Odin would drown in his deceit.
Steven groaned as Clint grinned with truly evil intentions.
Steve felt his throat began to close and tighten, almost like when he had his asthma attacks near a century ago. He clenched his fists to the sides, working his jaw as he looked on at the drop degree invasion that was happening on the other side of earth. All on his name.
Gamora crossed Asgards dungeons with her head held high, ignoring the whistles and catcalling from the prisoners around her, specially ignoring the one prisoner behind the gleaming wall of powerful spells.
The surrounding warriors shared a look and promptly burst in loud roars of laughter, even the Barmaid jostling in Frandal’s lap joining the outcries.
“You mean Captain Steve Rogers” One man spoke, his icy blue eyes shifting in a valiant attempt to hold his gaze, however unadvisable it was “Captain America”
“But did he say
“It wasn’t a compliment” Lady Sif rose an imperious eyebrow at the Soldier, whose smile turned ferocious as he regarded her, daggers ready and eyes shining.
“You planning on signing on that?”
Tony had always been good a lying to himself.
“There is no Siren!”
-----
“Can we go play outside now?” The boy, Cooper, Steve had learnt that morning, who had yet to learn how to control his vocal range, hung to the Doctor’s neck, little face resting on the man’s shoulder, willfully unaware of the frozen state of the Doctor, as if he feared his very breath would hurt the boy. Steve felt a tinge of sympathy for the good man and said to the children:
Pepper shrieked and clamped her thighs around his ears, near muffling her high-pitched noises as Tony worshipped her with everything he had. He pushed another finger in, his thumb coming up to press firmly against her abused clit and his pinky grazed the tiny furrowed hole just below. Pepper came with a blood curling scream.
“Thank you, Father” Thor tittered happily, all smiles and sunshine.
Thor choked on a harsh breath, cold horror dowsing him as he gripped on to the Soldier tighter “You—Yes, Steven. I promise.”
Thor glared at those present, those who most likely had been present when Steven had suffered this disgraceful inspection and he snarled to all. “Regardless, there will be no need for further examinations, for I will do our childbearing in this marriage.”
Steve made a point of engaging the girls in his conversation with the Queen, keeping them in the room at all moment for as long as he could. The Queen grew restless and silent, blue eyes shifting uncertainly as the morning passed and soon their time together had died out. Steve held back his sigh of relieve as the Queen called their meeting to an end.
She then sends a subtle but pointed look at the increasingly uncomfortable Captain. A majestic, disapproving frown adorning his fair features as he observed the proceedings. Though Thor thought he could see perhaps, just a twinkle of amusement in his sky-like eyes.
Steven nodded seriously. “Anyways, thank you for that, it was quite the sight”
Prison break, blasphemy and heated confessions.
So, with no particular remorse for interrupting his siblings sleep, Thor proceeded to call in a booming voice: “Loki!”
Thor’s grin widened impossibly “Oh, I rather think I’d love to climb up your-“
Loki’s mouth flapped for a moment and then both God’s fell into an incontrollable fit of cackles.
Hydra was up for a fearsome reckoning.
Odin reached to her and held her face tenderly in his calloused hands, bringing her head up to meet his gaze.
Thor frowned but smiled at the queer questions the Captain had, it was quite charming if he really thought of it. “Quite different I would say”
“Thank you, Father” Thor murmured, smiling half heartedly at the All Father as his eyes skipped from the other witnesses in the room, and wondered if they all thought the same.
It was a frankly admirable feat to speak as many words while being as inebriated as he was.
“We have 3 hours before the whole world knows about the Captain” Fury stated, voice firm and commanding though his one eyed gaze was as near to torn as Tony thought it would ever be. “So do try to keep your meltdown to the minimum, we’re on a tight schedule”
Loki squealed another round of higher pitched laughter. Until someone shouted: “The fuck you laughing for? You fucked a horse!”
“Ok, come on in, the kids are waiting to say hi”
“You have given me much to think about. I thank you for your cooperation, Lady Gamora.”
“Me too” Steven agreed, combing his hand through the God’s long, wavy hair and gently pulling out the knots of the day, earning approving groans of pleasure from his tender ministrations that he would admonish wordlessly by clenching his strong, thick thighs around the God’s ribs, as if
The night was pleasantly growing late when Volstagg decided to open some of the barrels of ale. After emptying about three of them just the four, Frandal snoring away in his tent; it was no surprise that they found themselves in this situation.
“Convincing you” Steven spoke, one long finger playing on his bottom lip, his pink tongue darting out and pulling it in, moist lips closing on it tight.
, he had explained.
went unsaid, but both could feel it glaring blaringly between them.
Steve sniggered “Is that so?”
Steven gasped a lungful of air as he came to an abrupt halt in his confessions “I feel helpless”
Tony shook his head sternly “No, no: Oh Tony. I’m fine! I’m happy even, they deserve each other” The engineer worked to keep his smile as the assassins eyed each other knowingly “That’s what this whole thing rounds up to, isn’t it, soulmates and all that? They are happy. I’m happy”
Thor roared in laughter, tapping his tankard with the red headed giant in gleeful bursts. Frandal sighed ever more enamored “It would be worth the pain if the pain was caused by his divine hands!”
Thor pulled away from the Captain before he could feel uncomfortable under his attentions. Smirking fiercely as he held his arm out for the Soldier to pass. “After you, Captain”
“Handsomely” The Queen snapped, her patience beginning to run thin “His family is well accommodated in the Palace halls, his son is a fine scribe of the court; his Father was Head of Arts as well, before him, and his Sister is Head Mistress of Healing. They all do so willingly, Director, we are not
Thor smiled like a besotted fool, catching himself rasping poems like Frandal. How low must he fall for this man?
“Captain nice, he not treats Hulk like Hulk stupid” The Jolly Green chewed and nodded “Steve is Hulk friend”
my best friend Bucky, he was helping me pay it, before it all happened.” Steven released a humorless laugh “I was going to give him a luxurious life as my kept boy when I became a big shot, he used to say. He always thought I’d turn out to be some da Vinci kind ‘a fella…”
“Up, Thor” Steven snickered, giving up on freeing his shirt from the God’s stubborn hands and simply slipping out of it with a winning grin. Much to the God’s delight and misery. The Captain stood shakily and sent his husband a strange, pointed look; a flush rising on his cheeks as he rubbed at the back of his neck. “You should put that one on before you come out…”
here. Now hush, Steven. Try to sleep. I will stay with you” Thor calmed, tucking himself in the small bed besides the soldier and curling his arms around the man, more perhaps for his own comfort than the Captains.
“See you blew it!” Barton whispered in the near screaming voice he had ordered him to quiet down. Glaring as Stark marched back toward them with an eager step.
Steve woke up the morning after the beating to a naked Thor pressed up tight over his own half nude body, snoring softly to the crook of his neck and a heavy leg, and something else, weighting on his hip.
The shield struck the hand that held his sword with a punishing force. the precision of the stroke an act of skill fit for a warrior many a centuries worth of mastery. A sculptors chiseling flicks. Heimdall’s’ hand cramped; his shout of pain cut short by the cold kiss of Mjolnir meeting his cheekbone; his stumble stopped by the edge of the shield knocked straight into his sternum, keeping him in reach and on his feet for another and then yet another swing of Mjolnir’s mighty touch.
“Yeah, no slut shaming Captain America!” Quill shouted in rage, cuffing the larger man over the head and scooting over to the irate Director “Shoot him, brother!”
“Brace arms” Odin commanded the pair, smiling proudly as the betrothed pair clasped one another by the forearms in an unshakable hold. Warriors meeting in equal ground.
Pepper moaned in pained, embarrassed want; pushing her breasts up in an absolutely obscene arch of her slender back.  “How did he do that?”
Jane curled her tiny fingers in his still throbbing flesh, drawing a chuckle from deep in his chest as he took her dainty hand in his own and brought it to rest on his shacking chest. This woman would be the end of him. Thor felt a grin split his face. He could barely wait.
After a while it became clear that any drop of blood would set the God off, so Steve gently pulled at the man’s stained clothes until he stood in his underthings, the skies having quietened after a few minutes of Steve’s gentle cares and the sea now lapping softly at their waists. Steve pulled Thor out of the water and noticed a sac left by the neighboring trees, as someone; probably Volstagg, had ambled out there to help.
The God of Lies sat up quietly, his face devoid now of anger as he followed Thor’s steps, frowning only with the parting kiss the married pair shared and drawing blank again as the other God left the rooms.
Gamora hid her twitching lips behind her cup but her skin slowly flushing emerald belied her interest in the scandalous affairs of the Newlyweds.
Steve chuckled but took the proffered marker and started to write on it: “Sure thing, for whom should I write it for? Cooper or Lila?”
“Steven, come join us.” Thor laid a possessive hand to his betrothed’s shoulder as he guided him to the Warrior Three and Lady Sif, standing quietly at the side and eyes filled with excitement.
The man burned his eyes on Tony, intense and humbling as he spoke “You are one of the Prince’s shield brothers”
Steve felt a shit eating grin part his lips before he even set his eyes on the astonished red head. He thought he could even see a bit of a pleased glint to her blue eyes.
It felt good to laugh again.
“I know that Thor can get a bit carried away sometimes, I can tell him to stop if it makes you uncomfortable.”
“You may, child.”
He did so with purpose, straight backed and head tall; he had some decisions to make.
Thor scowled harder, irritation drowning out his heartbreak as he gripped the pillow tighter under him in silent menace.
Loki rolled his eyes skywards and waved a graceful hand in the air, a green fog rising from his fingertips and soon his crooning voice filled the room.
“Yes, dear?” The Captain quipped, snickering softly, breathless and shaking despite his teasing, as the God took his mouth again and plundered it with his eager tongue, their hips thrusting in sync, both working the other to a high, their pleasure building with every stroke; both drowning each other’s sounds and gasps with yearning, passionate kisses.
He paused to enjoy the horrified looks in the men’s faces, delighting in this small retribution in Steve’s name. “Sure, I might feel bad at first, but one eyefull of that beautiful ass in a G string and I’ll get over it soon enough. And rest assured, I will never let you have a say on him ever again.”
“God!” Thor thundered, rising to his feet in excitement.
“98 Mississippi, 99 Mississippi.” The Captain chanted, holding a struggling, butt naked Prince’s head underwater by the twist of his arms and a handful of golden locks. The Asgardian warriors eyed the human with astonished expressions, catching the man’s attention as he smiled brightly “It’s ok, I’m just testing something”
The Colonel waved at Steve, like one shows their price produce in the city market. Steve sat still under the heavy gaze of the God.
“Loud and clear, Captain” The curtains hissed quietly. Steve snickered under his breath and stood from the couch to amble onto the bed.
“Ok” She gave in, pulling him up and down onto her chest, letting him be lulled by her heartbeat once more. “Ok, Tony”
Steven then countered by backhanding him, hard, across the face.
“Hello, Jormungandr.” Steve said, nodding slightly to the great serpent, who stared at him for another long moment before flicking his eyes to Thor.
Thor had just crossed the threshold of Steven’s private rooms when the God was tackled out of the way by a smaller, thoroughly agitated God of Arts, mousy features flushed crimson and desperate.
And so it began, easy strokes of their swords meeting in steady attacks. Lady Sif was unusually gentle in her teachings, stopping plenty of times to correct instead of taking advantage and punishing the Captain for his missteps with a tap of her sword, as she is wont to do in any other occasion.
Loki arched Thor’s brow inquisitively at Steve, who gave him a wide grin “He ate it just as fast as you did”
, no less) to leave- and Steve quotes- Earth well and motherfuckin’ alone.
“Captain America, I know.” The Director interrupted, taking out a small communicating devise and tapping at it with his thumb, eye still on the group of aliens as he texted blindly “And if you are right about this Ronan guy, we will need much more than this little firecracker right here.”
“Ten bucks on Steve” Natasha declared, sitting cross-legged next to Banner, who snorted inelegantly: “Deal”
“Hey there alien Hodor” His voice resounded, mechanical and monotone trough the speakers of his faceplate. “Why don’t you but the sword down and stop spawning before I blast your head off?”
Squaring up his shoulders, back ramrod straight. Captain America strode out of the room, Avengers at his back.
Let them see how magnificent his Steven is.
Steve smiled at the doctor, grateful though faithless in the man’s words.
What in the 9 realms had Steven been doing out here?
“What are you doing here?” The Captain asked in a low voice, sending small, halted looks to the door connecting his rooms to the Directors. Thor lowered his own voice accordingly.
day.”
“Oh, Dragons” Steven echoed, his tone faint as he too leaned on the window next to Thor “Right, because of course you have Dragons.” Thor smiled at the barely concealed dismay, he could imagine the Captains face, but what really thrilled him now was to perceive the man’s warmth through the thin layers of curtains and glass. Norn’s above Thor ached to rip the doors open. The Captain cut his steamy thoughts with another inquiry “But maybe tell me about the less mythical ones…”
Heimdall smiled. The man had wit as well. “So I will.” And he clasped the hand of the Captain in a firm grip, surprised again by the man and the strength behind the act.
Thanks to all of you for your kind words and unconditional support, it has been so nice to read your sweet comments and I really hope I can give back your kindness in the form of good chapters and quick updates. You guys are the best and I am so grateful.
Thor had just dragged his childhood rooms into this one, minus the bed, and now these chambers sported all manner of trophies and weapons, as well as pictures and books that he had shared and cherished with his brother in their boyhoods. Things he could never bare to part with no matter his age. The Captain clenched the God’s hand in silent gratitude for the gesture and the trust this offer extended. To have another in a place so private, so full of secrets and treasures. Thor felt more naked now than he had ever been without a stitch of cloth on. But if he had to choose anyone to share his most private self with, he could not choose one more worthy than his husband.
“Then why don’t you release him from your vow?”  Frigga probed. Laying her head on his armored shoulder, like she had that very morning in their wedding bed and had done so for millennia. Like she would hopefully do for many more to come.
Fury rolled out of the chair in just the brink of time, avoiding the worst of the blast though his ear looked a little fried. The man stood, serious and blank.
His body moved like in a dream, kneeling before the minute cross, laid bare of all ostentatious things, just him and his faith. And still, he struggled to form the words.
“Does he speak for you?”
Thor lowered his gaze in apology, though his mind still battled to conform the thought. Steven had fought the Guardian and had emerged not only with his life, but victorious.
“Much better” Thor grunted.
The Soldier managed to salvage his manhood by a hair’s width, receiving a crippling blow to his inner thigh that brought him to level with Thor.
Some of the bravest tried to speak up only to be silenced by a sharp glance of the All Father.
“You would never abuse your husband.” Thor declared confidently, returning to his work with greedy, bold hands.
“It that possible?” Steven asked, his voice very small and utterly confused “Us, having babies?”
“So, I suppose Thor is snoring it out in the Dungeon, am I right?”
And really, only Steven would smile so proudly with a sword pressed to his neck. Or Loki, but that was another sac of cats entirely.
“Can you?”
Thor felt his heart sink in his chest, his breath ripped from him as the Captain held his eyes and pointedly bit into the sacred fruit, chewing and swallowing in silence. A statement made. The God stood still as Steven came closer, eyes unblinking and severe, taking Thor’s limp hand’s an placing the bitten apple in his waiting palms.
“Hasn’t been around that long” Clint said, strolling to plop next to the deadly woman with a grin “she’s got more confirmed kills than the black plague.”
Steve pressed his lips to a tight line of chagrin and watched silently as the All Father gathered his wife in his arms with a deep sigh of relief. He turned his eyes away to give them privacy, though he was the only one it seemed, as the guards looked on expressionlessly, waiting like statues for their next command to bring them to life.
Steven smiled a shy, uncertain thing, his eyes dipping and eyelashes batting as he considered the God for a second, standing close together in the main halls of the palace the Soldier dipped his head and nodded seriously, as if asserting something to himself before giving the most chaste, softest peck of a kiss on the corner of Thor’s frozen lips. Thor was stone still in the wide halls as the Soldier backed away with a quiet, peaceful smile.
Loud sobs and mumbling mingled with hurt grunts and soft cooing.
“If you need courting advice from Frandal, I’d say you are practically brain dead” Hogun supplied, taking the fallen sword and joining Lady Sif in the ring.
“No! I’m from Missouri!” The Starlord corrected, his blue gaze dancing from one enemy to the other in a frantic sweep of the closed hall. No exit to be seen.
was a punishment. Thor could only smirk and continue his tale “Aye, there was one time when we were children, he transformed into a snake, and he knows that I love snakes. So, I went to pick up the snake to admire it and he transformed back into himself and he was like: ‘Blegh, it’s me!’ and he stabbed me.” Thor sighed in sweet reminiscing “We were more or less eight at the time”
“Ain’t that a crying shame” Natasha joined the loud groans of disappointment from the children, her eyes twinkling with unconcealed glee and breaking into surprisingly loud bells of laughter as Steve only crossed his arms more tightly over his chest in retaliation, failing to conceal the blush that began to spread lower.
“His prowess was obvious from the tight fitting of his wedding attire” Drax agreed, taking a sip of his tea as he added in a deadpanned tone “He is as well endowed as he is handsome”
Peter winced and grinned “ehhh, probably.”
“They said something…” Steven voiced, his eyes piercing Thor’s in near desperation “About a year”
Thor’s stomach fell as the seconds stretched, barely avoiding to stop fidgeting but by a sharp glance from his brother. Odin grinned at his son’s anxious state, as he purposely prolonged the third call until his wife sent him a subtle scolding look. The All Father tapped his staff thrice.
Tony felt his soul quiver, his arousal all but erased from his body and he gave in “Yeah, yeah. I know, come here, Steve”
“Make it 50” Barton joined, eyeing the irritated billionaire to his side. Stark barked a laugh: “The man is a literal God; Brooklyn won’t last a round” And the men silently shook hands.
Thor blinked and eyed his mother with confused eyes until her pointed head tilt let him know of her intentions. The God of Thunder nodded abashedly and released his grumbling husband to his mother’s expert care “Yes, mother. I shall see you soon, husband”
Steven sighed loudly, setting his hands on his slim hips and letting his head hang “Thor, our friends can’t stay here for a whole week. You know that.”
It was well over the hour when the old master emerged from Steven’s chambers. A carefully blank look in his thin face as he approached the awaiting Gods in the antechambers.
“No, Tony” Steve hissed into his neck, rising goosebumps all over “It’s everything, you’ve always been there for me and when it was my turn to do it, I wasn’t…”
“Steven” He called; his voice icy as his gaze.
The science men fidgeted in place, casting embarrassed glazes between one another. “Well no, bu-“
He rolled them both gently, laying his husband on his back on the golden sand with barely a mumble of protest from the slumbering God. Steve held himself in place over Thor for a moment, taking a second to look at the man and consider.
“It is the least I can do for you, Captain” Heimdall acquainted, shaking the Soldier’s hand firmly “You will have your privacy and they will have their peace of mind, all is well”
“Hey! I’m not dying over no human hussy!” Rocket snapped, waving his little paws around worriedly “We tried, we failed. Like I told you!”
“Where is he?”
Steve smiled at the giant and passed him a whole baguette. “Hulk is my friend too”
And just as Thor raised his head to the commotion, he saw a man tumble backwards into a table of drunk warriors with a tremendous crash.
Steven bit his lips tightly for a second before he whispered “Thor?”
Odin blinked.
“Look at me. Thor, look at me.” Steve called, cupping the God’s tear stained face in his hands, catching his wet gaze with his own and holding it firmly “He is alive, and he will stay that way, because of you.”
“Wow.” Steven breathed, staring out to the silent forest with an empty gaze.
“Laura is gonna
limp, they will expect a child by the end of the year.” Steven shuffled from one foot to the other in dismal dawning “I am of Odin’s line, we are fertile beyond believe. Why did you think no one questioned Odin appearing out of the blue with Loki in his arms?”
Steven sighed patiently at the Billionaire “No one asked you to look Tony.”
“I will not” Thor declared, resolute “it is a mistake”
The Captain straddled his back, his arms twisted in an unbreakable grip, unimaginable for a Human. Thor twitched and huffed short, troubled breaths. He felt the Captain’s hot, minty breath hit his sweaty face as the man whispered playfully in his ear: “Do you yield?”
“You know where the worthy one hides”
Thor nodded.
“Aye, and she has been rewarded handsomely for it.”
And Steven promptly slammed Volstagg’s hand down with a resounding thud.
“Why, my dearest?”
Could this be that Thor wanted to pursue a more… husbandly interaction? Is this how you initiated intimacy, or do you have to ask directly?
Everyone in the table but Steven had startled at his demand. The Captain merely nodding and pressing forward to the next issue in hand, no questions asked and no doubts over his qualifications to take the project. Unwavering trust, Thor was surprised to name it so, when was the last time someone had gifted him with such unshakable faith?
“Puny God, sore loser!” Banner roared, still in his human form though tendrils of green covered his face and neck, eyes a brilliant emerald that shinned with excitement. A moment of realization stunned the Avengers as the Doctor laughed up roaringly. Steve barely kept the smile in place as he advanced to the doctor with steady paces, even as the other Avenger’s shied away with slow motions and Thor silently summoned Mjolnir to his side.
Steve frowned suspiciously. “Yes, I spent the afternoon together in her gardens, remember?”
Thor bit his lip as his thoughts continued to circle around his doubts, his heart heavy and troubled with his insecurities.
-----
“Rock, paper, scissors?” Bruce tried once more, face scrunched up and grinning winningly.
, Fury noticed.
Odin pursed his lips, almost a pout if not set in his wise features, so alike the one on her grown son’s face that it may have been hilarious if the implications hadn’t been so daunting “And that is my son and I say he can have as many Masters of Art as he pleases”
Thor sighed and released the Soldiers hand with an apologetic smile. Steven did not return it, and Thor was just about to begin to grovel when Barton gasped dramatically.
Thor glowered at the ill concealed lust in both the whore and Frandals gaze, taking Steven’s hand after both the blasted
“I, Frandal the Handsome” He sent a very pointed look to his awestruck companions as he went on “Would repay you with a view as splendid as yourself, but it is for naught; I see that now, for the Norn’s have depleted their treasures in your making”
Thor roared, rising to his feet in a spring of rage. The Director stared at the agitated God in a deadpanned gaze.
He could barely wait to show
“Odin sends you off to Earth in a fool’s errand, it would seem, but, he has, with just one jest, secured Asgard’s sovereignty on Midgard”
That night he burst into Steven’s room, startling a peacefully reading Captain to nearly tumbling out of his lounge on the couch. Thor did not respond to the Captains surprised greetings as he hurried to his side and promptly sprawled over him, hiding his face in the man’s taunt stomach and breathing his clean, fresh scent. Heimdall be damned…
Steven’s gaze grew soft as he laid a comforting hand on Thor’s bare shoulder. “It’s only a 3 hour drive, we’ll stay in touch, I promise”
Steve sighed and allowed himself to be surrounded by the Avengers. The loud clunk of the Iron Man suit to his side, his metallic gauntlet curling in Steve’s bicep and shaking him.
“I think he became their Mascot when he joined a Lesbian riot in Europe and proceeded to officiate religious weddings in front of the city halls” Natasha drawled, taking another sip of her beer, her smile conveying her silent approval.
The men in silly hats around him laughed loudly and cheered. One of the men had tied thick ropes to Mjolnir, connecting it to the wide girth of a price Bull held in a small cage, huffing and scuffing its hooves on the dirt floor impatiently.
“We are staying here then.”
“New York receives thousands of tourists a day” Black Widow agreed “You might cover more space staying here than jumping from city to city”
speech. If you use Mjolnir on this wall you will
“So, what say you Captain?” Thor finally asked “Will you take it?”
“Hello, Steven” Thor moaned, catching the Captains alarmed gaze just as Frandal cried: “Now!”
“Thor?”
“No” Clint said stiffly, quickly marching forward and disentangling his children from the men, resolutely ignoring the quiet snickering of Laura and Natasha and the loud protests of the kids as he dragged them upstairs.
So it was one of those moods…
“Forgive the misunderstanding, Director. We are not gifting Steven with the man, we are reallocating his Masterpiece to the Captain’s teachings” Frigga explained kindly “In Asgard, to become a Master you must dedicate your life to your craft, and the perpetuation of it through your students, it is not slavery, it is devotion. Much like Midgardian Religion. He is free to do of his life as he pleases; he has merely chosen to live it through his Art”
Thor watched as the man pulled his clothes off, folding them neatly over his boots and left in his underthings as he ambled into the calm waters and went about washing himself. It was a marvelous view, never had Thor seen a more perfect creature in his millennia of life. Wet and glistering in the early rays of Asgards dawn, Steven was beautiful and his smile as he noticed Thor walk into the sea after him. So bright and honest and sweet. Thor’s lips trembled as he dared to smile back.
“Tony, please” She shook, trying to regain her senses enough to pull away from this. From him.
“Steven, we will meet again tomorrow.” The man said in ways of goodbye, turning his full attentions to his task now as Steven finished gathering his utensils.
“Thor”
Steven’s eyes widened further “How is that better?”
“Thor!”
Steve nodded, in a loss on how to respond to that amount of honesty from the God of Lies and eventually stood from his seat. “I’m late for class, see you later, Loki”
“Are you even here to negotiate?”
“Funny that the man in question isn’t here for it” Tony mused purposely, sending pointed looks to the politicians all around “You know, laying his life down for his people is one thing, he might have some objections about his country asking him to bend over for the greater good.”
“There is nothing to be embarrassed, Captain” The alien assured kindly “You are as ferocious in bed as you are in battle, it is a gift”
They had made it in record time, and took a Jet off to the skies, flying for near 4 hours in near silence until they arrived in a Farm, South West of the country, in the middle of a starless night.
Steve released a breath he had not known he was holding and let his head hang.
And like a signal being sent, Steven’s voice called from inside the room “Thor?”
He rubbed his tired eyes as he sat on the long sofa where he had left Thor, not even caring anymore that the God wasn’t there, honestly he couldn’t stomach seeing his face right now.
Thor rose a haughty brow at the Captain “You did not call me a
Thor had to clasp his hands behind his back to avoid coming forth and slapping those bony fingers away from his betrothed. Luckily Director Fury had no such qualms as he strode forward and smacked Master Bragi’s hands with a smart flick of his wrist. “Enough of that. State your purpose or get the fuck out. I want my portrait done before diner.”
“Believe me, I am not thrilled by it either.” Loki cut in, his prim voice silencing Thor’s arguments and Steve’s tired replies as he settled into the lush bed with a stoic and faintly put out expression towards the married pair “And if you could refrain from having sexual relations in my presence, I would be most grateful.”
“I heard that” Thor panted, leaning heavily on Mjolnir and grinning like a loon.
Frigga smiled thinly and patted the mans back proudly: “Thank you, silly husband of mine”
The Avengers flew the jet to Geneva, suits on and weapons at the ready, watching the news and the drip drop arrival and invasion of Asgard to Earth. Steve watched how the General tapped his sword in a steady pace, his unblinking eyes burning even through the camera lens and screen. This was his price wooden horse.
Steve chuckled as his blush receded. “Thanks Hulk, it’s nice to finally be appreciated” And stared pointedly at the snickering assassins to the side.
So much so that one night the boys had risen from their sleep in the middle of the night, silently scurrying to cause mischief someplace in the dark. Heimdall had appeared under their beds and pulled at their skinny ankles.
“You need a minute” Thor shot back, quite childishly.
The Avengers grinned at their leader and just for a moment, all was good and well in the universe. Until…
“Just sleep.”
If you haven't heard it I very much recommend you do and read this chapter with all the feels I wrote it with. The next chapters will take a bit, maybe even a week. Drama is building and plot is coming.
“Take care, Steven!” Thor barked a laugh as Jormungandr dipped him in the water and resurged some paces away “I shall see you for dinner!”
“Oh please! that was all they could talk about in Kyln!” Rocket scoffed, sitting on Groot’s shoulder in resignation “How the prince managed to fetch himself some Midgardian minx. You’re lucky Ronan got to the Collector first ‘cause he was offering a nice little planet off the side of Ego for ‘im.”
“Getting ready” Steve said, keeping his hand in the air expectantly, eyes closed in concentration and a leg jiggling slightly with growing impatience.
This was all on him. For being blind and selfish.
Frigga pursed her lips and turned to her son.
Thor grinned at the thought of the time to come, where Steven would rule by his side, the idea enough to cheer the sulking God. The once daunting weight of the crown somehow lighter now with the prospect of the Captain sharing the throne. “He will be a perfect consort to the crown”
“Mother?” Thor managed around the knot of newborn dreed at his usually sweet and composed Mother pleading so “What is the matter?”
“Thor, you’re here” Jane said in bewilderment, taking a hesitant step forward as if she was unsure that he was truly there or if it was a mere play of her senses. Her small hands clasped tight to her chest as if they were physically holding her heart in place.
“The Captain isn’t a common reference to begin with.”
“How is she?” The Captain dared to ask after a second, ignoring Thor’s looming as he cleared his throat “Is she still…?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“We came for the Siren!”
Thor’s face sobered with a more familiar pout as he shot a glare back to the dark God currently magicking the mess of feathers away. “I have a couple of ideas.”
The next couple of days Steven was nowhere to be found, he attended his classes Master Bragi assured him, but would not stay around to chat any longer, as he was used to do; even the elderly God began to worry over the good Captain’s state of mind.
No, they did not wish for riches. But they did ask for rain.
Loki hummed “Not singing like that he won’t”
“If I were a pettier man…” The Captain muttered, relaxing back into his settee and eyes darting from his work to his husband in quick shifts of his intense, sapphire orbs. “I’d say you’re compensating for something…”
“And heroes, you are.” Odin spoke, startling the two groups out of their cheerful reverie.
“Why you lookin’ at me like that?” The Captain finally asked, his hand now cupping the God’s smiling face and thumb caressing absently at his high cheekbone.
Let me know what you think of this, the next chapter should be up friday night or saturday morning the latest.
“It matters not” Thor boomed, chest puffed up and valiant in his besotted ways “He shall have all of it. He is my betrothed and I will it so.”
Thor had been shaken to the core after his meeting with the Director, not even spending the afternoon with Steven and watching him spring life with his brushes could settle the feeling of dreed in his heart. As the night grew old, he found himself descending to Asgards dungeons.
Thor’s smile widened to a delighted grin as he pranced into the rooms with purpose. Steve smiled back and set his pencil and sketch book aside when Thor reached for him with a searching hand, his calloused palm kneading tenderly at his shoulder. Steve relaxed under his touch and sighed.
Steven saw the deliberation of the Goddess and pounced “If it is not an obligation, I would prefer to spend my time in privacy” The Captain stated firmly “Thor and I have been friends for a long time and I doubt we would be pushed to do anything untoward when left to our own, we are adults after all”
To her side Tony observed the newlyweds with a keen eye. Noticing too the important detail that the rest of the table seemed to have missed, and slowly regained the color to his olive skin that had drained at the entrance of the pair and the Captain’s exaggerated limp. Tony breathed an air of relieve as he cheerfully chatted away to the new commers.
“Hey” One of the scientists with a coffee stained white coat cried “You can’t take it!”
Odin sat back in his Throne, hand curled tightly around his staff. Eyeing the sole person in the great halls with quiet consideration.
“You win; I go with you right now, no questions asked.”
“He laid his hand upon me” He explained, courteously “That is not advisable, to anyone”
Ronan leapt to his feet, a vicious smirk on his blue face as he eyed the newcomers and stopping appreciatively on the Captain. “I won’t only take; I will make you
“Thor” Steve greeted in surprise, freshly bathed in the pool like baths of his room, pink skinned and wearing flimsy trousers and shirt that stuck on him like a second skin. Thor rove his hungry eyes over the Captain and smiled at the blush that graced the man’s cheeks.
The Avengers, housed but a few rooms away, heard the commotion and snickered.
New Yorkers, or New York tourists, were silly creatures; Thor decided, as he was asked more often than not to pose for a picture- he had become a master with a Selfie stick- and nearly none showed more than the perfunctory interest in Mjolnir.
“When I fought the General, you were there.”
“Pretty impressive actually” Sam corrected “Not an easy feat, to hold a magic hammer of the Gods”
I hope this chapter is up to par. Enjoy!
“He’s not going to stop crying. You can keep me in the chair just let me feed him,” Tony pleaded.
Bucky sat in the spot Tony vacated when he left the room. “I can try to let her sleep on me til the bassinet gets here?” he said motioning for Steve to pass her over. They carefully transferred her without waking her again and Bucky settled back with one hand cupping his daughter around her bottom to keep her in place and the other picked up her little fingers and watched as they Instinctually grasped his. He smiled.
“I know, darling. It cost me like ten bucks, believe me I have no illusions that its anything more than a cheap kids party store setup.”
“He looked so amazed by the table you set with some cheap paper Avengers tableware,” Steve laughed humorlessly. “I want to kill them, Tony.”
“Boy,” Indy replied after some consideration. Bucky put the other one back on the shelf and then stood up. “Okay, let’s go pay and then you can have your baby.”
“I’m going to check in with Happy and have him bring Poppy here for a little bit,” Bucky said before he left the room.
Tony could visibly see Steve relax when they made it into their living room. Bucky looked to Tony. “Switch again?” He asked, gesturing to Indy. “I can get him settled in bed if you wanna take Stevie into the bathroom.” Tony agreed and passed his son over. Indy had only briefly woken up in the car and passed out again once Tony told him they were all going home together. His little body seems to have given in to the the exhaustion finally now that everyone was home and safe.
“How’re you doin’ Buck?” Steve asked as he came to sit beside his friend who was sitting at the kitchen island staring into space. The other Avengers and the kids had retreated to the living area to watch a movie. Bucky flinched slightly, unsettled that he was out of it enough that he hadn’t heard Steve come up behind him.
“No safe?” He explained, but in a questioning tone, because he was less sure now.
“Pete. Thank you,” Tony said to the teen. “Come here.” Tony stood and held his arms out and Peter jumped up to return the hug. “I’m glad you stopped by and I think Luca loves his bear.”
Just a short interlude where Bucky gives Indy a gift. The next chapter will be longer!
Steve passed by the toy aisles seeing toy cars and action figures and tons of things that he thought might be fun for Indy but he knew he wouldn’t be receptive to them yet. He continued on to the section aimed toward the even younger toddlers and infants. He turned into that area and found some shelves with soft looking stuffed animals, mostly pastels and muted colors.
“Okay I think I know what you want,” Tony said. “Papa and I got you a Valentines gift. You wanna see it?”
“Da,” he mumbled with his thumb in his mouth.
“Who’s DNA? Bucky’s?” Bruce guessed. Steve looked over to Bucky but he was already shaking his head no.
“So, who’s the kid?” Tony started when no one else seemed to know what to say. “Or better yet, why aren’t you trying to kill us?” Bucky winced, staring down at the table. The young boy in his lap, chest to chest.
“I know. I’m sorry.” Steve shook his head because Tony definitely didn’t need to apologize. “I’m okay now. Just have to heal up. I’ve had worse.” Steve rolled his eyes at that. “You don’t think I’d leave my fiancé this soon do you?”
“Safe?” he whispered, turning to look at Tony.
Music started playing a moment later and Indy, gently prodded by Pepper, started walking up the aisle. He meticulously and painstakingly dropped individual flower petals slowly and evenly. Their friends looked on, smiling and laughing quietly to themselves. Steve shook his head fondly and he and Bucky rolled their eyes when they made eye contact. When Indy started picking up already dropped petals in order to put them in a better location Bucky figured it was time to step in but before he could walk over Tony appeared at the end of the aisle laughing and quickly caught up to his son.
“Buppy,” Indy said, pointing to a little girl nearby. Indy toddled toward her and Bucky followed awkwardly hoping he wouldn’t have to interact with any parents. The girl looked to be a little older than Indy and had a couple toys spread around her in the grass. “Baby,” Indy said, pointing to the girls doll once he was next to her. The girl looked up at him and smiled.
“I’m gonna hang up so I can get Indy ready and head to Shield. If he wakes up, and you need to, just call me back, okay? Otherwise just tell him I’ll see him really soon.”
“There’s one for all the basics,” Bruce added. “One for numbers, colors, animals, food and stuff. I figured he could catch up on all the basic things while also doing the puzzles.”
“He loves puzzles,” Bucky said and Steve laughed.
“How about you finish the juice then take a nap and we can have dinner after?”
“Da,” Indy greeted in a mumble, sounding extremely sleepy. Tony smiled and took the spot Steve vacated, sitting on the edge of the bed. He leaned over and kissed Indy’s forehead, staying close and whispering, “Goodnight, baby boy. I love you.” Indy reached up and wrapped his arms around Tony’s neck, keeping him close.
“Thank you for this. You’re a lifesaver.”
“Don’t worry, you can hold him a little while longer,” and even though that’s what he wanted to hear, her tone was ominous. “We’re going to record a little video for your hubby.” The man had a small video recorder in his hands that he was turning on and focusing on Tony. “What you don’t know is that you have been filmed this whole time, so we can keep an eye on you of course, but also so we could send the Avengers a livestream. So, if they even care, they’ll already know what’s happened to you.” Tonys eyes narrowed and he glanced around but couldn’t see another camera. She ignored the fact that he was looking. “I’m going to make my demands and you’re going to sit there and be good or I will take that baby out of this room and you won’t get to see him again.” Tony gave a small nod but couldn’t help the shiver that ran through him at her words.
"What is it, Tony?"
“You’re a good boy, Tony,” Steve assured him.  Tony looked down, playing with the hem of Steve’s t-shirt.
That blanket exists and is sold at Target. I saw it and felt like it had to be Indy’s ;)
“Come on, Tater Tot. Let’s see what you got.” He sat on the arm of the sofa, next to Steve and turned Indy around so he was facing out on his lap. Steve took the bag and held it up so Indy could reach in. There were two items inside. He tried pulling the first box out but couldn’t grip it so Tony helped. It was a Tony Stark/Iron Man unmasked Funko Pop. Indy looked up at him. “That’s me,” Tony told him with a smirk and a shake of his head at Happy.
“Yup. Go save your kid from the master assassin.” Steve turned his head to reply angrily but thought better of it. The situation was just escalating. Instead, he decided to pick upon the other portion of what Tony had said.  “Our kid, Tony.” Tony didn’t reply but he did turn to look. Steve went upstairs.
“You weren’t allowed off the bed?” Indy nodded. “Was there something holding you there? Like something tied to you?” Indy looked up at Steve and whimpered.
“Not right now, Peanut. Papa has to sleep and we’re going to go in the other room for now.” He stood up and headed to the kitchen with Bucky following. Tony sat at one of the stools on the kitchen island and Bucky got some juice out of the fridge to pour in Indy’s sippy cup.
“But he’s here now. You can help him,” Bucky insisted. “He’ll be okay because he has you. All of you.” Bucky rearranged the boy so he was facing out. “Can you say hi to Steve and Tony?” The boy waved his little hand out in front of him. Tony smirked.
“Yeah just in case,” Tony nodded. “Here, I’ll help.” He stood Indy up in the seat, keeping hold of his waist so he wouldn’t fall. Indy twisted to look at him.
“I’ve had worse,” Bucky answered with a smirk. “He tried to walk off with this little girls doll at the park, she screamed at him and I grabbed it and gave it back.”
“I’m sorry,” Bucky repeated.
“He is a baby. But your name is Indy right? What will you call your baby?” Steve explained.
“What happened?”
“I thought we were going to be a family,” he repeated, sadly.
They both dutifully reached out a hand, Steve’s to her forehead and Tony’s on her bare tummy, to see if she felt hot. Poppy squawked at the attention and Tony smiled. “You okay Poppy seed?” Tony asked. Bucky looked at him questioningly. “She’s a little warm,” Tony added. Steve nodded.
“Stevie,” Bucky answered, stepping away from where Indy was watching cartoons. “What’s wrong? Are you okay?”
Tony couldn’t hide his tears anymore as his son screamed. They kept him cuffed and brought him to the bathroom at gunpoint then brought him back, let him change Luca’s diaper, and strapped him in again. He was told it was Luca’s last feeding time for the day so Tony assumed it was night. Luca was given to him and again he awkwardly handled him til he got into a decent position. He stopped sobbing enough to eat but his face was streaked with tears, nose stuffy, he was sweaty and breathing heavy. Tony felt so awful for him that it felt like physical pain. And it had only been one day.
Tony stared him down for a minute but then did step aside. Bucky was off the jet before anyone could say anything else. Tony flew off to give them some air cover and Steve, Natasha and Clint followed after Bucky. They took down the guards at the door fairly easily and made their way inside, splitting up to cover more ground. Tony circled once overhead but didn’t see any more guards on the outside so he headed inside to join the rest of the team.
“Tony,” Steve gasped. “Did he just,” he trailed off, he knew Tony heard it too because Tony was staring at their son with a look of awe. “Were you trying to say Dada? You’re going to take a bath with Daddy,” Steve said excitedly to keep Luca interested. “Can you say Dada?”
"Thanks, Tony," he replied softly, sitting at one end of the worn sofa.
“I’m here, baby. Not going anywhere. Let’s go upstairs together, okay?” Steve helped him up and they went to their floor. Steve guided Tony to the kitchen and sat him on one of the stools at the kitchen island. “I’m going to make us some tea we can have while I finish up making dinner for us.” He filled the teapot with water and put it on a burner. “I need you to cut these up for the salad. Can you do that?” He held out two bell peppers.
“If, for whatever reason, you want this mess back,” she gestured to Tony, “then you need to make the right decision. Tomorrow we’ll send you a link that you can reply to.”  The stream went dead and the TV resumed the full screen original stream. Steve watched as the man left and the woman grabbed Luca out of Tony’s arms, managing to wake the boy abruptly, and carelessly dropped him on to the table. Luca was crying and Tony was yelling at her, pleading really.
Tony led them to the rack he left his stuff on. “So, first and, I think, most importantly, I found Avengers sweatshirts so he needs all of those. No arguments.” He spread his hands as if to say that’s just how it is. “There’s only 3 in his size anyway. We’ll get the others online.” He put the Captain America, Iron Man, and Hawkeye hoodies in to the cart. Indy watched with interest.
“Yay!” Indy exclaimed, excitedly clapping when he sensed the serious part was over. Everyone laughed and joined in to clap.
-Brooklyn.
"But why him and not me, you know him. I'm a stranger and you know what I've done and yet you're alone with me down here."
“Not so hard was it?” Tony asked flippantly. “Hey there, baby girl. You’re gonna be okay.” He bounced her slightly but she just continued looking at him, one of her hands finding its way to the material of his t-shirt and gripping it tightly.
Steve sighed. “Okay, Indy. I’m going to get Bucky so he can help with your puzzle okay? I’ll be right outside the door with Daddy if you need anything.” Steve squeezed him in a gentle hug from behind and then stood up and put Indy back on the chair. He stepped out of the conference room and Tony stepped forward right away.
“I think she’s found her favorite,” Steve said, smiling at his boyfriend. Tony was about to respond until he felt a warmth spreading from beneath the blanket.
“Yeah,” Tony said looking over to Bucky.
“So,” Tony said. “B-A-T-H?” He spelled. Steve nodded.
“It absolutely does matter, Tony. And anyway, I like it. Let’s do it,” he picked up the pen and dragged the paper in front of him. “Do we just write it in? Or,” he trailed off. Tony took the pen gently from his hand.
Steve shook his head. “No, thank you though.  I need to talk to Tony alone, I’ll get to it after.”
“No, please,” Indy insisted, reaching out to Steve. Steve took his little hand in his own.
“Book?”
"How's it going?"
Steve smirked then leaned down and kissed the top of his head. “You’re gonna be okay,” he told him. “Indy has a gift for you. You wanna say hi to daddy and give him his present?”
“It’s your room, Tony,” Steve answered without looking up from his book.
“Okay,” Steve replied.
“Still, there’s no rush here and I’m sorry I tried to make you do something you weren’t comfortable with.”
“I wanna see Indy first,” Steve told him, looking nervous.
“This is going to be the best Christmas ever,” Tony continued softly. “Because you’re here.” Tony’s words were for Indy but he didn’t doubt the two super soldiers in the room could also hear his quiet words, but that was okay. He pressed a quick kiss to Indy’s cheek this time and then sat up.
“We wouldn’t miss the wedding of the year” The Widow smirked, winking at the gleeful Captain.
“Maybe” Tony agreed “A little, it’s still early, he’s still mine though.” He pulled a holographic copy of the contract from his watch piece for the whole room to read, as the President remained frozen with the original in his shaking hands “The US signed off the right to the Captain’s body in the early 80’s to Howard Stark in exchange for the formula of the Erskine’s Serum... And guess who inherited all things Stark?”
Steve clenched his trembling hands into fists. His eyes glued to the black splotch that not a minute ago, had a steady breath and pulse.
“What ya lookin’ at?” Steven murmured sleepily. Eyes closed still as he stretched his lovely body with a sensual arch of his spine.
Sif and Steven readied their bows and arrows in a flash, drawing the string in time as they aimed at the animal now charging them with angry strides.
I hope I don't push anyone out of this, I swear this is going somewhere! lots of Aghast to come!
“I knew you would enjoy it brother” Thor sighed contentedly, a small smile sitting on his lips as he thought of his oblivious husband, his handsome face smeared with flour and fluttery eyelashes batting as his blue eyes narrowed and crinkled with a charming smile, just for Thor.
Thor stood face to face with the man, eyeing him with glee as the Soldier wrapped his long, strong fingers around Mjolnir’s handle. The soldier smiled uncertainly as his resplendent blue orbs connected with Thor’s own. “I’m not wearing a dress”
“Save it” Stark bit out, though all the heat had left his voice, and now looked at the Captain with ill-concealed yearning “I’m just glad you’re here”
“It is the ancient dance of overwhelming debt and desperation.” He explained as he came to kneel in front of the intended pair, eyeing Thor with a wicked glint to his eye “Give me a coffer of Gold and I’ll teach the Captain a move or two.”
“Can it?” The Director threw it in the air and caught it sharply, enjoying the startled yelps from the intruders as he finally slipped the devise back into his coat “Then I’d best hold on to it… I can think of a friend who would enjoy this very much.”
Steven gazed down at his suddenly forlorn husband, curling his arms around the God’s neck and chest and resting his chin over his now neatly finger combed hair. Giving comfort unquestioning, because he needed it, even if he would not ask for it.
“Hey Thor, are you up?”
“Oh, gee. Thanks Thor. I was starving.” And the Captain took a large bite of the holy fruit, he chewed away merrily as he polished the stump of marble he was working on with one careful, graceful hand.
“Not if Odin gets to him first.”
“Don’t!” Tony barked “Don’t be fucking sorry, I don’t
“You thrice damned goat!” A deep voice roared outside, answered by a high-pitched bleat followed by a harsh grunt of pain and a crash of pans and barrels.
Thus, the God was shackled to the Man.
Thor blinked and nodded, reluctantly letting go of the man in favor to going to find his friends. “Aye, see you then Captain”
Then the whole Mandarin debacle happened and as he landed in shit-fuck-nowhere, taken the payphone; he had called the first person he had thought of.
“You have a beautiful family, Ma’am”
Thor gazed up to his father, Odin stood impassive as he eyed the newcomer, the mechanical suit of armor landing in a bursts of propulsors and marching decisively onwards. Towards Steven
-----
“We’re sorry, Steve” The children chorused, eyes blown wide like cartoons and little mouths turned downwards in sad curves.
“These are my private rooms” Thor boasted with a wide wave of his arm “you are welcome here of course, if you ever feel like joining me”
Quill was just nudging a room open when the wooden door was smashed to his forehead in a vicious shove.
“Bad for digestion” Natasha agreed.
“Oh you are staying right here” Fury scoffed “I don’t trust you idiots to not turn around and give this whole kidnapping thing another try.”
“It is the apple” Mistress Eir explained as she passed her hands over the unconscious Captain’s chest, sensing with Sedir the burning of Idunn’s influence on the man’s soul “It’s power is running through his veins, he should be perfectly well by dawn.”
Odin scrutinized his frowning son with a blank expression, as they both held silence until they were the last left in the hallways.
“It’s alright Steve” The doctor appeared to his side, green tendrils already curling in his olive skin as he smiled at the Captain “We humans are stronger than we look”
Bucky would laugh his dirty pants off. Most probably.
Steve waved faintly “Good day, General”
Thor thundered his laughter as he entered Steven’s rooms with his gift.
“I said, is there anything you’d like to say? Or was your whole purpose of coming here to hassle me?”
Thor swallowed heavily but nodded, nonetheless “Aye, with Odin’s blessing, you could come to bear a child.”
Steven clapped a long fingered hand to his chest as he doubled over with laughter. Recalling their first sparring in a fit of cackles that shook his whole body. Thor joined his betrothed with thundering chuckles of his own, pulling the convulsing man into his arms as they avoided a flying body, flung over the bar with a harsh thud.
“You mean to say your man crush has become cripplingly obvious and don’t want to put your main and side piece in the same room?” Barton quipped, unapologetic in his effort to make the Man of Iron squirm.
Odin’s eye shone with a burst of power as he struck his staff, Gungnir, once to the floor. The sound resonated through the Queen’s destroyed chambers, loud and damning. Like a death sentence.
“I Odin, son of Bor, King of Asgard, All Father, Ruler and protector of the realms, have come to you now, in face of the crimes committed by my own kin as I had sent my son and heir to you before to acknowledge your hurt and make amends for the wronging’s you have suffered”
They had not touched like this since that night in the camp, where they had made love in a haze of eager bodies and liquid courage; something inside Steve making himself retreat from the physical aspect of their relationship, and as Thor had promised on their wedding night not to make any unwanted advances on Steve until he was willing, he respected his boundaries with that unassuming, pleasant way of his. Perhaps this was innocent as well, Thor always seemed to be in a good mood when he visited Loki, and he in turn had been more forward with him after the hunting trip with the Warrior Three and Lady Sif.
“But mom!”
How strange it was, just a day before that thought would have been a blessing, but now.
She giggled adorably and butted her head to his chest, gripping at him tighter, hugging him with all her might.
“He is my boy, my blood and soul. What kind of man could possibly be Worthy of my child… I can hardly imagine such a thing” He mused in quiet wonder “Thor may not understand it now, or tomorrow, or even millennia from today” Odin rested his head against Frigga’s letting his eye close and shoulders slump under the weight of his son’s pain “But when my time comes to ride to Valhalla, I wish to do so knowing that he will not be alone”
“Do not bed him, Thor” The Queen insisted heatedly, ignoring his squirming son and gripping his hands imploringly “He is-“
“Shouldn’t you be in Council with your Father this morning, my dear?”
And that was ok, Steve was no stranger to the act of men loving other men. He had been in the army, for Christ’s sake, he had seen his fair share of men, naked or fucking. It was just a fella lending a helping hand… or something.
His blue eyes, so much like the clear skies of Asgard in midsummer glory, assessed Heimdall with severity, but they also held compassion as he let Mjolnir fall to the floor with a careless thud. The final ring of the battle and extended his gloved hand to the defeated Heimdall.
Thor cleared his throat and set Mjolnir aside, trying to close the bond from Stevens still searching quests and their growing effect on his body, but he was still only Thor so he smiled a heavily suggestive smile as he laid back on his elbows and stuck a pose for the bewildered Captain “You know, if you wished to be worked to exhaustion, I can think of a far more pleasurable way than this.”
Steven jolted dramatically “Thor, I won’t ever-“ Though his reassurances died swiftly at the God’s anguished eyes and the Soldier broke “Yes, I promise you”
Even so, perhaps some of Odin’s descendants, or even Bor’s still roamed earth, however improbable this seemed.
“No, Tony.”
“Bilgesnipe.” Steven repeated, releasing a harsh breath.
“Ever since I was a little girl and I caught a glimpse of his golden hair, his charming smile and bright eyes. All I ever wanted was to be seen by him” She confessed once more the depth of her affections, her mind calling back the first time she had seen Thor in Court, sporting a training sword and waving it mightily to a forbearing Loki and so precious she, barely out of her toddler days, had been smitten “I outgrew my dolls and my dresses, knowing that it was swords and battles that he liked… I told myself it was my own wish to become a warrior instead of a Lady” Sif smiled bitterly at the admission, raising a calming hand at the astonished Soldier as she continued “I do not regret it, do not misunderstand me.”
“What is Ringerike?”
Tony startled at the unexpected revelation, his face then contorted in sorrow. The soldier sat there, a melancholic, self-depicting smile on his handsome face.
And laid the hammer down with a resounding thunder.
Loki helps, but did he?
Odin’s mouth curled in distaste but nodded nonetheless. Regardless, Frigga went on, her anger but simmering under her calm, lovely features.
(See the end of the chapter for
The Doctor scoffed as he dug out a large bag of coins and set it grumpily in the Archers waiting hands “Unbelievable”
Stark wheezed and spurted aggressively, his olive skin taking an interesting blue undertone.
Tony caught a pink nipple between his lips and sucked, hard. Pepper cried out and curled over Tony’s head, hands clenching on his hair where they twitched and clung in a silent battle to pull him closer or push him away.  Tony lathered the nipple until it was pebbled and blushed, scrapped into a bright red from his Goatee. His hand’s curled around her hips and began to pull the black pencil skirt she wore up in sharp, demanding tugs; until it was bunched thick in her tiny waist, revealing her lacy panties to his hungry eyes.
“I know”
Thor rode his stallion to the Bifrost that afternoon like a whole new man. After having been alerted of Mjolnir’s movements, he had left his Brother’s cell in search for his Mother. Finding her at the edge of her gardens, over watching the Bifrost as she used to do when he or his father had parted for battle. Just as he joined her they both caught the flashing of the rainbow lights, alerting them of the return of their forces. They had both ran to the throne room where Odin sat with a bewildered look in his bearded face.
The children squealed in delight, causing Bruce to wince as the boy’s shriek went straight to his ear, but smiled gratefully as both Cooper and Lila scrambled to his side of the table.
“Two weeks.”
“You will have time after to get the get-to-know-you’s out of your system.” The man consoled, in an uncharacteristic sign of sympathy to the troubled God “Our priority right now is to make it two weeks in without an uprising. So do yourself a favor and help us keep the Captain under the radar.”
“Jormungandr, my boy!” Thor boomed, sprinting forth with the large horn he had used to call his nephew waving in the air. Steve stayed put as he watched his husband embrace the large snout of the serpent and laugh uproariously as Jormungandr’s tongue curled around his leg and attempted to pull him into his fanged mouth.
“Master Bragi” Frigga sighed heavily.
“How did you grow up so fast, my precious little sun?” Frigga wept, gripping the larger body to her chest as if she could force it down, make it smaller, so it could fit again in her arms, snuggling to her breast as he used to when he was but a newborn babe.
“No more lies” Odin roared, as a black tread wove its way bloody on Loki’s lips, sewing them shut stitch by stitch “No more mischief!”
Later that afternoon, Thor returned from his mother’s chambers with a grand smile. His mother’s wellbeing and now Loki’s ensured safety coming together to lighten his spirits and dispel the horrible tension he had held in his heart since dawn.
“Thor, you cannot make gifts of people!” Frigga cried despairingly at her First Born’s daring request. Her hands clasping her wide hips and her blue eyes glaring disapprovingly at her pouting son, who promptly turned his sullen, pleading eyes to the other parent in the room.
“Uhh” Steve started, blushing bright red all the way down to his chest as he stood up, covering himself feebly with the bunched, stained shirt and his sticky hands.
Finally, Steven turned to face the God. His face a stony mask of careful indifference. Thor felt a thrill of unease and his steps faltered as he approached his unsteady betrothed. Just as he was working to voice the words to inquire about the state of the Captains mind, Steven blinked out of his dark mood and smiled gamely at the God, taking his shield into his hands and crouching to a fighting stance.
“I noticed you were a bit quiet during breakfast…” He said, tailing off at the end, as if uncertain of how to word his questions, though Sif knew exactly what this was about and she was unsurprised it had finally come to head.
“Leave him” Thor begged, grasping at the seams of Steven’s shirt as the Soldier scooted away in determined pulls “He will survive, Tanngnjostr and Tanngrisnir are herbivores, they only bite him because he smells of apples, I swear!”
As he munched on cold meats and rich cheese’s. His excitement grew, contemplating his route through the Midgardian countries with more enthusiasm than it probably merited. Maybe, if he hurried, his mandatory tour of the republics could be done in but a year’s time. Surely with the aid of flight and shameless publicity this could all be done quite expediently.
We are up to 300 kudos! How did that happen? I'm so gratefull and humbled by you guys, your awesome and are appretiated. I hope you enjoy this chapter, wrote it for all of you! Lots of love!
“Fight!”
The dark God frowned internally, his pace faltering for a step and chasing a swift side look on Steven’s stony face. Now that he observed the stiff posture of the Human and the hurt that shined from his clear, butterfly winged, blue eyes. The lie was too clumsy, to frail for even Thor to set his feeble intellect on.
Thor regretted his question almost instantly as the smile was wiped from Steven’s dirt stained face. The Captain’s jaw worked to release the words, ultimately, he did with a shaky sigh.
“Would you like that?” Thor asked, taking the Captains hands there were they laid frozen on the binder of all the Houses Thor had compiled for them. The Captain struggled once more, his throat working and jaw clenching over nothing as he battled the emotions rising in his chest.
Loki scowled at the Soldier. “Leave it, there is no way you will be able to overpower Odin’s command. This amount of freedom is…” The God lowered his eyes to stare at his hands, fingers dancing with green sparkles, then up and out the large windows to the sunset. Seeming for a second to struggle with some emotion before turning his empty eyes back to Steve. “Far more than I had hoped for”
“Couldn’t let Captain America tie the knot without a proper Stag party, could we?”
“So” Tony began, scratching the back of his neck where a flush kept it hot “That happened”
“Thor, I can’t…” Steven pleaded, shifting restlessly in his sick bed and eyes beseeching on the troubled God. “People
“You’ll never what?” The Soldier quipped as a red and gold blur sent the infuriated Kree backwards “You didn’t finish!”
“Great, ‘cause I don’t want to know.” The Colonel walked forward, producing a thick manila folder out of nowhere and pushing it in Tony’s face. “I do have something for you that you might need to have a look at”
“What is going on?” The pot-bellied human cried; face congested with blood Heimdall yearned to spill. “Are you invading our planet?”
“Sure was” Steven agreed; voice low in the dark of their bedroom as he caressed Thor’s arms wrapped warmly around his midriff absentmindedly “You don’t think we will get in trouble for all the… mess?”
And as the God regained his senses, gazing down to the flustered Soldier; laying still with his shirt bunched over his lovely chest, trousers tanged on his ankles and absolutely drenched in the God’s essence. Thor’s softening cock began to fill anew and only the stunned look in Steven’s innocent eyes halted his lust from simply taking the man at that moment.
“His trial can wait for a night.”
“With all due respect, General Ross.” Steve said, his eyes hard and firm on the elder man “Go fuck yourself.”
It took a second, but then it came. He felt the man’s warm hands lay gently on his head, patting his hair in soft, uncertain strokes. Thor sighed deeply.
“I came to speak to you, I require your council, brother mine” Loki’s brow twisted from one emotion to another before settling in disinterest, regardless, Thor pressed on. “I find myself restless”
“Mother” Thor cooed, blue eyes watering as well as he came up to hold her in his large arms.
Steve frowned “I don’t think I’m supposed to leave the compound, Clint”
“Will you help me break my fast, Captain?” Frandal asked plaintively, attempting to bat his lashes even with his eyes near swollen shut and purple. The man’s lust knew no bounds.
“Are you going to sign the papers?”
“You sure, you’re not my grandpa?” The Starlord probed again “‘cause I can see a little similarity in the jaw line there…”
“What?” Quill hissed in a panic “What am I supposed to say?
“Somewhere… around… Say Thor?”
And with a graceful sprint he darted to the back room with a little wave in Thor’s direction. Thor smiled after him and was in the middle of admiring that sinful behind when he heard it, barely a whisper.
“You can wear your underthings if you like”
Steve awoke with a startle, glancing frantically around himself while strong, but careful hands kept him from falling of the bed.
Well, this conversation wasn’t off to a good start.
Thor was surprised to find Steven not only listening to his Mother’s ideas, but an active participant of the conversation, from decoration to meal courses to guests and tradition. The man was attentive and soaking in all the information like a sponge, offering opinions and even adding requests as the night grew old. By the end of it most of the pressing issues of the wedding had been either agreed upon or in beginning of formation. And Thor had barely had to contribute, though when they had began to speak of their wedding chambers he had promptly jumped in.
“The collector, The sovereign, the Kree, the grand master, celestials…” The Director called, fingers up and reproachful “You name it, people are looking. And until that knot is tied the Captain, and Earth; are free game.”
“Cheer up, Captain” The dark master spy said with a wry grin “Just like a band aid”
Tony coughed out a sob, throwing his bottle into the furthest wall with a crash, ignoring how his bots scrambled to pick up the mess with agitated beeps.
Steve perked up as he caught that reference.
“Bring out the hammer”
“I know, my dearest.” Frigga wept, shedding her own tears to join her husbands “I know.”
The Captain turned his soulful eyes to his husband and suddenly something shifted in the air. It was only them again, under the shy moonlight and last nights pleasures sang loudly between them. Their shared touches, the heat of their bodies, the memory of their silent passion. Steven’s cheeks dusted with pink under Thor’s intense scrutiny, taking soft steps to finally stand before the God, a slender hand coming to cup his bearded face, eyes unwavering as the Soldier traced Thor’s features with a timidly wanton gaze. That skillful, artist hand caressing the God’s face and his slender fingers skimming over Thor’s lips, recalling the feel of them and the pleasure they were capable of.
“What are you doing here, you big, stupid oaf of a prince?”
“Iron man is tiny Avenger”
“What are you doing?” Thor barked. The other avengers screaming at the Captain in a series of excited or horrified tones.
The dark trousers hugging the stark curve of the Soldiers bottom tightly, the muscles of his thighs enmarked clear through the dark cloth, shifting with his every step. The high boots tied high onto his thick calves and accentuating the graceful arch of his ankles. His wide chest covered by a snow-white tunic that revealed the dip of his clavicles and just the mere insinuation of the shadow of the man’s pectorals. The rest of his front enveloped by a leather waistcoat that made Thor’s tongue, amongst other things, swell and flounder.
“Don’t become too familiar, Odinson.” Loki panted “Your lies are not welcome anymore”
Steve blinked hard, one stray tear slipping out before he could stop it. He nodded.
When Steve entered his room, he rushed about the place like a tornado of anxious energy, slamming shut windows and doors as if the Devil was on his heels.
“It’s ok Thor, I probably shouldn’t be slumped out, out here” The man grunted and curled up to his feet, bringing to stark relief the defined muscles of his abdomen, the tantalizing dip of his hips as the trousers slipped an inch lower only to be halted by the plump curve of his behind.
Thor blinked and drank his booze while Barton barked a sharp laugh.
, Captain” Fury corrected, his face for once an open book that read of wonder. Steve fidgeted under the weight of the clear fanatism, but nodded nonetheless, turning to the woman to his right.
Indignation began to swell among the representatives, some gasps and murmuring beginning to rise as Odin spoke on, calmly cutting and condescending.
Odin’s gaze was unreadable, finally he turned to his private guard. “Find your Queen”
Volstagg chugged down his ale when Thor only sat in shamed silence. Once again, Thor showed his true colors. He had just spent an evening in Steven’s room and instead of speaking of him, the man that had to leave the world he was just recently growing to know again, as he had confided in Thor of these painful struggles not that long ago. He had been in his presence and what had he done? He had bemoaned the ill treatment from the Director, which was nothing short of well earnt, and nearly gotten lead about by his cock.
“Mjolnir.”
“Away where?” Tony barked, his hand immediately enveloped in his glove gauntlet, propulsors at the ready and aiming straight to the remaining eye.
“Think again”
“Well Thor silly, he has the long hair”
in my bedroom…”
“Yes, I should thank you for leaving her there.” Steve continued, lowering his eyes in such an endearing show of bashfulness that Thor had to press the cushion harder to his ever-swelling cock “I never would have won that fight by myself.”
Thor grinned “Isn’t it?”
Tony took the folder reluctantly.
He… He loved this man. He would not wait to share eternity with him; and somehow, Odin had not been entirely against it. Perhaps that comment of grandchildren had more purpose than he had let on. Thor fidgeted some more, feeling uncharacteristically shy as he approached his busy husband.
“You sure that’s a good idea, Cap?” Tony asked, mechanical monotone as he was fully armored as soon as the first of the thunder had rolled in the sky.
“Oh, I know” Thor grinned, watching the shift, the sensuous clench and release of the taut muscles as the Captain advanced with animal like grace, all coiled strength and skill. The cushion on Thor’s lap jumped.
“Captain”
The night was young still. Their guests silenced for a moment, observing the newlywedded pair stand from their seats and slowly walk out of the room, soon they were drowned by the sound of cheer and lusty whistles. The Captain flushed and shot a parting look to their friends, a small wave thrown their way as they both exited the ceremony hall. Thor smiled at his husband, guiding him into the empty hallways and shutting the golden doors behind him, muffling the persistent catcalls at his back.
Outside of the Wedded rooms, in the royal training grounds by the Queen’s private gardens; The Warrior Three and Lady Sif gathered to train and enjoy the warm, summer day when the sounds of grunts and loud crashes once again filled the palace, harsh thumps of bodies against walls and what sounded like a third voice, deep and coaxing, mingling with the intelligible shouts, culminating with high shrill cry of:
ass.”
Thor flew fast and steady, his chest filled with joy. Loki was clever, but in this he was wrong, he knew; Odin would not wish him a cold future next to someone of holy blood. No, the All Father had become soft in his old age, his steely wisdom warmed by the centuries of love and peace with his family, the most recent loss only melting his resolve and relaxing his once unbreakable iron fist.
“You raised me well, Mother” Thor grinned, bestowing a loving kiss to his mother’s brow, wiping her stray tears away with tender circles of his large thumbs. “Now won’t you smile for me once more?”
And the pulsing, like a living thing in every golden wall, beckoning him, embracing him. It had confused Steve to the point he believed he might be hallucinating from a fresh bout of fever. That and Frigga, her constant glances and tight expression.
Thor jumped as the door to the bathroom opened to his side, revealing a slightly more awake and composed Captain America, dressed still in his skin tight uniform, minus leather gloves as the man combed his short, disheveled hair with wet fingers.
Thor thundered his laughter and patted a heavy hand on the archers back “Barton, Barton, Barton…”
That afternoon the God took advantage of the Soldiers disheartened mood to show him to their wedded rooms. Thor was shaking with excitement and nerves as he pulled his crestfallen husband to the Royal quarters, the east side of the palace where the sun would rise with them every day.
The man of Iron arched a haughty brow. “You do remember I blew them all up to smithereens two months ago? the pretty, billion-dollar fireworks last 4th of July in case you missed them?”
“Ten bucks says Stark goes full bridezilla”
“There is a catch to this, I know it.” Thor muttered to himself, tearing his robe off in a hurry, boots flying as he scurried onto the bed with a grin, prowling onto a stoic and utterly unimpressed Captain.
“He is a
“Good, because I don’t need him”
Steven huffed an affronted laugh and rested his forehead on Thor’s shoulder, curling into his husband for a long second before whispering keenly.
“You can’t do this!”
“What is it?” Steven eyed the God with interest as Thor pulled him to sitting, keeping the man close as he settled them up straight.
Steven swallowed and quietened, letting Thor release his emotions in the form of rabid kisses, everywhere he could reach, his hands dipping under the man’s bed clothes to caress and run his nails over the supple skin, the hard muscles.
The Captain would never smile and simply say:
Aye, it must be hellish to have it all and still ache for another. Especially one so fine as the Captain.
