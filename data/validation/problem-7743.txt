"Some do," she said, leaning against the shelving on the opposite side of the aisle. "Though not always for other people."
"Well there goes my excitement for this week," Clint huffed, finally started on the food that had been left for him, the cheese starting to go a little cold.
Steve tensed at that, "That's not what I meant and you know it."
“No,” Loki said finally.
"Sheer dumb luck is my only answer," he shrugged.
"You just alienated the entire team." Steve said, draping an arm across his eyes, "What were you
"Size does not matter," Thor said, sounding almost offended.
Steve stared at him for a long moment, "Can you possibly at least not go to drinks with megalomaniacs and those bent on world domination?"
"I," Tony started. "I'm going to get dressed," he declared finally, moving away and Clint had fallen silent, expression still. Steve disappeared quickly into the kitchen. Natasha paused for a moment before scooping the kitten out of the wrapping again and dropping it in Clint's lap, brushing a hand over his arm quietly. He shook his head slightly but accepted the kitten, pulling it against his face. The kitten mewed, batting at Clint's cheek.
"It's not a dangerous explosive, is it?" he asked, humor edging into his voice.
Steve propped himself up on one elbow, "Tony, if you're going to put yourself in dangerous situations the least you could do is call me and give me the chance to back you up."
"No," Clint said, turning on his heel and stomping down the street. "I think I am and then something like the holidays comes around."
"No compliments?" Steve murmured, his eyebrows rising slightly as he trailed a hand down Tony's side.
"Alright, keep telling yourself that," she patted his shoulder once as she slipped off the stairs into her floor.  "See you in the morning, Clint."
"Briefly.  He was surprised I was in the city."
“Well, I have no plans to die,” Steve said and leaned down, this time kissing Tony gently, like Tony was the one who was going to break. And Tony let him, holding on to Steve as tightly as he could, with everything he had.
Clint lifted up the set of Captain America trading cards. "I'd been looking for these everywhere—" he started, flipping them back and forth as if it would change anything. Fury must have stuffed them in the bottom of the box, and suddenly Clint could understand why.
"Your AIs, both created since Christmas I would guess, are in love. Or something of that sort. You might consider what that says about the state of their creator," Charles suggested.
"Thank you," Tony said, inclining his head. "Oh, we should see if there are any lights left."
Nearly banging his head on the cupboard as he pulled back, Steve waved toward the bundled coat, "It needed a home."  He found a small plate and put a little bit of tuna on it.
Natasha glanced at him, crossing her arms in a challenge, "Yes.  It is."
Her lips curved into a smile and she looked toward Samuel, "Go chaperone." The cat barely reacted but naturally moved after Clint.
"Yeah.  It, it was good to see her for a while."
“He gave me my first drink when I was seven, more or less,” Tony said, forehead pressed hard to Steve’s skin. “Uh, shoved down throat may be more appropriate. You know, the only compliment he ever gave me was that I was his greatest creation.”
"You have never been an influence in my life," Tony protested. "I just had a lot of extra room. You know, as multi-billionaires do."
Jane looked over the back of the couch, offering the new arrival a welcoming smile, "Christmas gifts.  Care to join us?"
"If it's not the future, it's Stone Age," Tony said. "You're the one who likes the moldy old mansions."
"And you were always there," Bruce said, running a hand through his curls.
, he didn't add and wished he didn't still see Yinsen in his dreams.
She nodded once, "Good.  Are you hiding here tonight?"
"I picked out the tie I thought he'd wear," Clint said, softly. "He's the one who remembered dates and holidays and to get presents and stuff. I just," he waved a hand, more honest than he had been to anyone up to that point. "I miss him. I don't know what I'm supposed to do without him, how I'm supposed to act or... I just
A-A-A-A
"Not in the least," Fury said, sweeping past him in a dramatic swirl of leather.
you, you know that, but it would be nice to have my own life too."
"Socks," she answered simply.
“Would you like one of those benefits to distract you?” Tony asked, still running his fingers through Steve’s hair.
"Alright," he agreed, pushing himself to his feet and offering her a smile, one hand resting on her waist.
“You don’t have—“ Clint shook his head. “What sort of movies do you have then? Because honestly, I could do with something with spaceships.”
"The plane flew into me," Tony said, chin back and tone prim.
Running a hand over the back of his neck for a moment, Steve finally nodded, "Well, he's been keeping his head down.  Did you think about the fact that it might have been safer to let one of us know what was going on?"
"I'm," Steve drew a deep breath and looked at a window display as they passed, "I'm actually trying really hard not to think about that."
"The Bifrost and our lifespan have always raised such issues," Thor shrugged. "I think I almost made Fandral faint though, when I started arguing the finer points of philosophy with my brother."
Eric chuckled, "You let Tony Stark name the cat?"
“Yeah?” Tony asked, brow going up. “You’re really not one to talk about fighting people, Charles.”
Bruce paused for a long moment, gaze moving to the drop from the Tower, "I suggested it, I'll admit that."
"Samuel?" Jane's eyebrows rose.
There was something Tony felt like he wanted to say, but he forgot with the heat of Steve’s hands so close. "Uh," he managed before giving up. He wrapped his arms around Steve's neck, pulling him down to kiss him. Steve's lips parted and he licked his way into Tony's mouth, yanking the smaller man flush against him.
Fury considered him. "Yeah, you're not really suited spy work anyway. But you know what not to do? You don't send a man to save the world by telling him his lover is dead. Then it becomes a vengeance gig, not a saving the world gig. You don't agree with my methods, and that's fine."
Nodding again, she drew her legs up next to her on the limo's seat and changed the subject, "The remodels are coming along well."
"So your brutal honesty and delivery makes everyone around you think you hate each other," Steve clarified.
"And in another situation I might have advice to offer," she responded, drawing in a deep breath and briefly missing the clearer air in New Mexico. "Are your, are your teammates always like that?" It was a clumsy topic change, and she knew it.
"It's feeling like a possibility. Bruce was too on edge earlier, and if I see him again I'll probably just say something stupid."
"You're not as old fashioned as the footage made you out to be," Tony said. "You're pretty alive and warm and not-vintage to me."
“Don’t even super villains take the holidays off?” Rhodey asked.
Pausing, Tony looked up. "Erm? Soon? I don't know, was that a trick question?"
Tony hummed, abruptly turning away, moving further into the floor, opening the door to the studio he’d had designed. “Here you go. Made sure it has the amenities it needed. Howard’s grave is in California anyway, it’s a bit further than Arlington.”
Steve took his advice, picking the Rubik's cube up and adding it to his other purchases.
“You could have not done it to begin with,” Steve said and Tony waved a hand.
"Past," Tony repeated. "I prefer to look to the future."
"I will throw you off the tower and send Clint to deal with Erik before he finds out," Tony informed the door of the elevator as it opened up onto the main habitable floor.
"Why would I be?" Steve replied.
"Either there is much excitement or scoffing," he shrugged, looking unconcerned.
"They have a difference in genetics that makes you just different enough that mutants might be viable.  Of course they weren't all that common until less than a hundred years ago, which isn't all that long," Loki replied, toying with his empty glass.
Steve smiled at that, "That's real thoughtful.  And you know we'll help you when you need it, like you said, teammates."
"Use your new-found powers responsibly," Tony added, tilting up to drag his teeth over Steve's bottom lip.
"Yes, well," Tony said, gathering them up to his chest. "It's been a beast of a day already so I'm just gonna take these home."
"You should go with him," Tony said, tapping Bruce on the shoulder. "Seriously, don't let him cut down a tree. I have seen what this man does to forests first hand."
"Just don't go near the fondue set," Clint said. "Steve, for some strange reason told Tony he could tinker with it."
"I don't know," Bruce answered honestly.  "I don't even know if I've loved her for a long while or if it was the idea of her, the idea of a possible normal life with someone who knew about me."
"He started talking about Howard and the Stark company building weapons," Clint said, watching Tony shift away from Steve. "And then Tony stormed off and got carried back by Thor."
Steve shrugged, "I haven't checked, I wanted to make sure it had eaten."
"I'll see what I can find," Steve said, letting his eyes move from storefront to storefront, trying to see if anything jumped out at him for their teammates.
Loki's brow arched at that, "Yes, because everyone enjoys being told they made such an attractive mare that a giant's horse couldn't resist."
Pepper blinked at the package, "You usually do.  I was expecting to go get my gift tomorrow."  She opened the package, withdrawing the sapphire earrings, her eyes widening, "Tony, these are wonderful."
When the first film ended, Thor looked around. “Surely that is not the end!”
"Well, one of you two is going to be taking it up then," Bruce murmured. "I don't think me in their space is a good idea."
"I'm actually thinking about how much I want to cause damage to someone who isn't here anymore," Steve rumbled in response.
Tony pulled a face at Steve, meanwhile. "What?"
does not want to share?” Loki asked, as if he had found the true weakness to Thor’s argument. “You wouldn’t do that to her, would you?”
Bruce shook his head, his eyes still their natural brown, "Don't be. It's not you I'm mad at."
Clint managed a faint laugh. "When Tony Stark wants something done it tends to get done. And Pepper organizes him, you know?"
"Mostly I'm still getting used to the labs here. I haven't been able to work with anything like this before, even in my old labs," Bruce said, watching Clint as he ate. "What about you? I haven't seen you around much."
"I recall there being a bus mentioned when I calmed down enough to talk to Rhodey later," Pepper supplied. "The risks you take for other people are suicidal, Tony."
Steve followed Clint, paying for the gifts and picking up the bag, "Frame or the movie store first, then?"
"Yeah, that's how Tony talks," Rhodey said. "You get used to it after a while. And it's not like you could pick an easier topic, like his dad or the time the arc reactor almost killed him."
"Can't say I blame him," Steve said, getting to his feet, "I'll write the report, and I’ll show up for that photo op you're working on setting up in central park, but after that I'm severing my connection with this agency. I'll take my belongings, the ones the government doesn't own, and I'll take myself—since unless a hell of a lot has changed slavery should still be illegal—and I'll be on my way straight from the park." Natasha's brows arched sharply at that speech, but she simply slid her knife back into its place.
"Of course," Tony said. "I mean, even you remember he was an artist right? Remember when I found that out and demanded art lessons when I was a kid? And failed at them miserably which is why no evidence of that exists anymore."
Tony frowned at him. "The last thing I have ever needed was someone's pity and I am not a goddamn puzzle."
"You're going to claim it's not?" Bruce replied, sounding a little lost.
Tony shrugged. "Not used to telling people about my safety. Besides, it just seemed easier as it was."
"Yeah, I'll be fine. Betty will go on and have a normal life, I hope, and I will continue on my research and working with you."
Steve inclined his head to one side. “It counts. You bothered to check.”
"They're doing well enough.  It's the teachers I have more difficulty with, frankly.  The students just need a place they can be themselves," Charles answered with a slight shrug.
"That would be what I meant," Natasha replied.  "You are under no circumstances to do that without someone running back-up for you, though.  Are we clear?"
Bruce accepted the plate with a murmured, "Well, I'm not," before offering Tony an almost sheepish smile and returning to the central room.
“Perhaps they should figure out how I think,” Tony said with a wounded tone.
“Nope,” Tony said, shaking his head. “There’s really nothing more I can say to that.” He hesitated, wanting to offer more, understanding that Bruce had willingly agreed to let the Hulk out if he was in danger. “But—It does mean a lot.”
Clint shifted and scooted forward to be a shade closer. "Okay. So you've wanted to kiss me for a while and I've been ignoring that because of obvious grief related reasons. I'm telling you now, I can't manage something like a fling and you're not wearing a heart monitor anymore so that's probably good but you just said you prefer to avoid situations where the other guy can show up."
"In this city?  Yes. In case you haven't noticed it's a hub of activity, on several planes," Loki replied, trying once more to twist his arm away.
“After all our centuries together, and you still understand so little,” Thor said. “Why are you jealous?”
"You have my word of honor," she vowed.
“That’s probably true. I've just always read more often. I don't really have a lot of movies I consider relaxing to watch” Bruce answered, opening one of the cupboards to his tea.
Thor stilled, something shuttering closed on his expression. "Have you been here this whole time?" he asked.
Rhodey looked between the three of them and seemed to catch on. "I assume Steve would be out of that group then?" he said and Clint shrugged.
“Well, as it appears to be a time for sentimentality, Merry Christmas I suppose.”
Natasha already had her phone out for exactly that purpose.  She placed the call on the way to the register, hanging up and looking at Tony, "Next year we start this a month ahead."
“Um,” Tony started again.
“It is. It’ll be good to get back to my art,” the blond murmured, offering Tony another smile.
"Are you drinking yet?" Tony asked, turning a long look on Steve.
instead.  Much more satisfying."
A-A-A-A
Moving over to sit down at the table, Steve nodded, "It was honestly more what Clint said than what you just implied."
That got a quiet laugh, "No, I think she's been around Tony too much to actually even consider something so daring as organizing someone's lab."
Thor nodded. "A bookstore seems an exciting place," he said, actually meaning it though the thought of books still reminded him more of his brother than anyone else.
That earned a amused glance, "Yes, it did.  But it still left me completely lost."
Charles smiled serenely, "You wouldn't actually, because that would just infuriate Erik and we all know how well titanium alloy holds up against a master of magnetism."
"I mean, if we actually talk are we going to slip out of this truce we've set up?" Natasha asked calmly.  "We need to talk, but should it wait until after Christmas?"
Steve had settled himself by the tree, watching Tony since the other man entered the room.
Folding the paper and sliding it under his arm, Loki looked around and finally up. The corners of Clint's mouth went up and the bow was in position between one breath and the other. He fired the arrow off, aiming for Loki's shoulder.
"A dress, and a sapphire necklace last year to go with it," Tony shrugged, casting his eyes around the store as if that would help him.
Steve finished cleaning the fondue set, drying it off and setting it down on the counter, watching the older one approach again, "Well, I guess we go without fondue."
“Then they should evolve already,” Tony muttered.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I still cannot believe this is happening,” Tony said, Steve sitting next to him.
"I'm allergic and I haven't been around cats since, well since.  I don't know how the other guy would respond to allergic reactions or cats in general," Bruce answered after a moment, pouring more batter into the pan.
“I don’t know,” she said. “I probably just need time. I can’t really ask you to give up any of your duties and it’s not like I’m not busy—”
Clint paused, about to say there was medication for that but wasn't sure how medication worked with the Hulk. "I'm sure Tony could come up with something," he said, holding the kitten still. "I'm sure you could at least scratch its ears—hey, is it a girl or a guy?"
"I wasn't actually supposed to be at the battle to begin with," Clint said. "So, yeah."
Natasha offered him an upward quirk of her lips at that, “Alright. Take all the time you need, Clint.”  She patted his shoulder once more before slipping back into the TV room and settling on the couch again.
"Really?" he asked, leaning forward slightly.
“Yeah-huh,” Tony said blankly, eyes still glued to Steve.
"Should ask someone who actually knows.  But not right now.  Just, don't think that Tony's description of himself is complete either," Bruce muttered, stepping back from the lights and boxing up what was still out.
“So move them,” Steve muttered, nuzzling his nose into the side of Tony’s neck and staying there.
Once their cups were acquired, Thor and Darcy exchanged stories over them, teasing jokes that Eric laughed at and Jane smiled but by the time they were returning to the tower, Thor looked over at Jane. "Is something the matter?" he asked, as the elevator slide open again in the penthouse.
"Clint's mostly avoiding the alcohol, Thor holds his like a god, Bruce doesn't drink, and Cap insists he can't get drunk," she shrugged, perching herself on the chair in front of his desk. "They decided to destroy a couple of Christmas ornaments and put the lid on the daddy issues problem there."
"Don't ask," Clint muttered, shaking his head slightly as Tony swept over to the lady he'd never met before.
For a beat there was silence. "It may be possible, sir," Jarvis said. "You should have brought food," and the door clicked open, startling Tony from where he was bent over schematics and a broken apart engine.
"Six of them.  One from a stallion, three by a Jotunn, and two by Sigyn.  None of them ended well," he took another drink of his martini, his tone idle.
“I don’t know what to say about the other stuff,” Bruce said when the silence had stretched between them too long.
"He still gave it an AI, which is pretty much evidence of a gamble," Clint pointed out, drifting closer.
," he dragged out the word he denied as applicable to them, just to see how Thor would respond.  "No need to come chasing after me only to repeat the pattern all over again."
Bruce paused for a moment, glancing around at the team, "Are we doing a gift exchange?"
Clint shrugged. "Organizing, I guess. While Tony's working on those floor remodels I just needed space to spread out."
Steve glanced between the three agents, finally turning his attention on Fury, "What are you looking for in the report?"
“Yeah, but,” Clint rolled his shoulder. “Do you like me independently of the Hulk or are you guys catching each other’s feelings?”
Sighing, Clint just shook his head.
“Been a while,” Clint remarked, casually shifting away from him.
“What if
"Everyone deserves that sometimes," Tony said with a shrug. "Any idea why they're still not talking to each other though? Because they're beating each other to a pulp every other night and not talking about it. I get everyone has therapy but..."
"Well, now you know," Tony shrugged, but his eyes were sharp.
"Altruism?"  Charles offered sardonically.
That earned a huff of laughter before Steve's expression turned serious again, "Is there anything else you think I should know?"
"I'll do my best.  I don't want to screw this up," Steve replied.
It was probably beyond time to leave the country, find a way to get out that didn't require too much magic or legal paperwork.  Europe had a nice ring to it.
"Not quite to the 'put on the suit' level," Bruce answered as he sat down in the chair nearest the couch.
"Well, if I have the time I'll read them and we can compare notes," Tony shrugged, swirling his drink around in the glass, one hand propping his chin up.
"It's not him who is in charge of my sentencing, or the commutation of said sentence, though, now is he?" Loki shook his head, "Redemption isn't something I've ever wanted, nor needed."
"I know it won't.  I've seen some of your texts, and I can tell you right now, I've never been married, nor do I have children, and I had no hand in Baldr’s death."
"Transportation out of this forsaken city," Loki replied, his eyes narrowing at the implication in Doom's words.
"Unless of course, Stark wanted to try and protest," Clint said and Tony's hands went up instantly in defeat.
"Poor soul," Tony said, even though since becoming Iron Man there had been few new videos of him on the internet with his shirt off—he was sure Pepper and Jarvis were relieved about the entire thing. "Dare I ask after you or would you hex me?"
"Yeah, flirting fondue sets," Bruce answered, amused.  "Well, shall we try to have fondue before the old one corrupts the new?"
She offered him a smile at that, "I'd like to come back out here I think.  And I'm sure Darcy would too."
Loki twisted around to look at Clint, "Well, I suppose that answers the question I asked as to how long before you picked up a tail."
“About jealousy!” Thor said, shaking his head. “You think there is something to be jealous about?”
"Well, Thor when he's here and sure Natasha can come too," Tony said, and Clint's eyes suddenly snapped cold. "I mean... a team and all," Tony said, glancing at Clint and deciding not to ask.
"No argument there.  He's about three steps short of super-villainy some days," Natasha replied.
"I still think we should have melted that ornament down," Bruce murmured, getting bread toasted and making sure the coffee pot was full.
," he managed finally, dropping the cards back in the box.
The corner of Fury's mouth quirked upward. "It's not about you, Stark. Where's Agent Barton?"
"I can consume a lot of alcohol in fifteen minutes," Tony replied and Clint actually cracked a smile.
"There are gifts," Rhodey managed and suddenly Tony was up and moving, shoving a box into his chest and taking away the coffee and doughnuts. "
"Probably wise.  I figured it's best to ask a minimum number of questions as to either of their reactions to pretty much anything."
Running a hand over the back of his neck, Bruce nodded, "It's not?"
Hopefully the others wouldn’t find out at all.
Tony slipped into his room, looking around the darkened expanse for a minute. “Jarvis?” he whispered.
Steve's jaw tensed and Bruce spoke before he could, "I'm surprised it hasn't happened sooner and with more regularity considering how well you two did on the Helicarrier."
"I'll take the kitten into my space if I have to," Clint said, picking it up gently as it did not yet seem to be going for the food.
"The only person you'd have to worry about taking your stores is Thor," Clint pointed out. "Though, he could probably drink you out of your entire tower."
“Overwhelmed?” Thor asked, sitting down across from her.
"Yeah," Tony nodded. "So every time a blog or tabloid runs a story about the famous Stark and Xavier rivalry, we call each other up and meet for drinks and laugh ourselves silly."
I guess all this to say that while grad school was terrible and we were terrible, this story is back? Gonna try and finish this thing.
Cheeks heating slightly at that, it took Steve a moment to form words at that thought, "You're sure?"
"I'll make the food made first," came the quiet response as Bruce stepped past Clint into the kitchen.
Clint paced for a few moments before stilling. "The Hulk may—I don’t know what the fuck the Hulk is thinking but he might be in love with me. Or—or something."
that night alone still just--" and she broke off shaking her head. Steve looked more and more like he wanted to turn back time and take back things he had said the longer the conversation went on.
"Good," Clint managed. "Because I never even understood the concept of rebound." It felt more like a betrayal. "And I guess—I guess we go from there, right?"
A-A-A-A
“God-Goddamnit,” Tony said, hands rising to accept Steve back against him, kissing him deeply, filthy. “Please, please don’t be one of those people who wants flowers and candle light before you fuck me.”
"Flirting fondue sets?" Tony sighed.
"The best sort," Clint murmured, shaking his head. "Bastards..."
“I actually meant the new armor upgrades but if you
Steve raked a hand through his hair, "For god's sake, Tony, that opinion's been changing and I'm beginning to see exactly how much of a sucker I got played for before we met.  I wasn't working with even a tenth of the information I should have been.  So yeah, I did make up my mind.  But you want to know something I've figured out how to do?  Change it."
Steve bit back his first question in the interests of good relations. Bruce glanced between them, sipping at his water again, "And here you told me you weren't even tipsy about fifteen minutes ago."
"Oh Clint," Natasha murmured.  "And you're not ready to move on, but you need to get away from all the memories.  What can I do?  Take a trip with you around the States, around the world?"
"That is a tree because you got lots of garlands," Steve answered, setting the boxes he was carrying down.
Bruce shook his head, "Taking on challenges when drunk probably isn't a good idea, Tony."
"You mean to tell me he almost changed during this conversation?" Natasha said, finally uncurling, "Barton, what the hell happened?"
those things?"
"You'd have to take out an heir of a realm containing people that were considered gods," Bruce reminded quietly.
No rather it was that it had been many months since he saw his brother.
"If you cannot see that," Thor said, voice dropping. "There is nothing I could say to you to change your mind because you would rather deny that I wish to love and protect you than accept it."
"I have business," Fury protested, arms crossed over his chest.
Fury laughed, but he didn't sound amused at all. It was a laugh of exhaustion. "You're probably right. Doesn't change my outlook though. I do things my way, you do it yours."
“Yeah, like in terms of movies,” Clint shook his head. “I mean, Star Wars? Or Star Trek? Or Alien? Naw, that’s too intense for relaxation right now. Space Operas, I think, would be best.”
Steve slid the collar of Tony's shirt aside just enough so he could get access to his collarbone, "True, but not exactly an argument."
"It's a skill you're supposed to practice," he said, wanting to pluck out a pair of those sunglasses to have sometimes to cover his eyes. Hesitating, he decided that he might as well, picking up a red tinted pair and putting them on without bothering to remove any of the tags. "Generally, Pepper buys her own presents."
Bruce sought for another topic, "How did you end up interested in books originally?"
"Oh she's out of my reach.  Sent her home, didn't you?" Loki replied, forming a different spell, needing to be away from Thor to execute any sort of transportation.
"Do I have a reason to be more nervous about finding something for Tony?" Steve asked, unwilling to admit to the uncertainty that was coiling in his gut.
That earned a long-suffering sigh, "Well, I suppose if you're holding it over for that I can let it go.  It's a bit early anyway."
"Still trying to get used to that," Clint muttered, curling up against Natasha where he could feel her heartbeat.
“I haven’t,” Clint started and stilled. “Look, alright. This would be complicated enough to deal with under the best of circumstances. But sometimes, for all I said earlier, I’m not sure I’m ever going to be ready. To move on. To try something new. I thought—I thought but I don’t know. And then there’s this and the world is ending every other week and it’s just,” he seemed to curl up closer into himself, resting his chin on the top of his knee and meeting Bruce’s eyes. “There’s a lot I guess we should have been talking about a while ago.”
"Oh," he said and grinned. "Yeah. They seem to have been a success so far though Clint is annoying as hell when he wants something."
“Uh-huh,” Rhodey said, patting him on the shoulder. “That’s definitely what I’m doing here.” He glanced around the room. “So how many ornaments did you break down this year?”
"I was going to take him first thing in the morning," Steve said.
Tony looked at the watch. "Um, well, it's still early," he said, even though the watch face told him most people were probably asleep.
Clint watched him before nodding slightly. "So, do I get to kiss you or should I sortta wait for your sign on that?"
Frowning at the ceiling, Tony shrugged. “Jarvis likes Star Wars.”
"Oh, fine," Tony smirked. "But it would be so funny. Actually, who knows, little Wagner might teleport you into the tropics for pissing Logan off and that would also be funny as hell."
"Uh-huh," Tony said, leaning back and folding his hands over his chest as he kicked his legs out under the table. "Or you're still just making weird ass eyes at Thor."
"I think Stark is incapable of building something without AI," Clint muttered, catching Samuel up in his arms.
"Yeah," Clint said after a beat. "And hey, if you promise this isn't just to see if you can have sex again, I'll promise it's not just because I need a rebound."
Thor smiled. "Of course," he said. "Can I aid in any way here?" he asked, looking around.
“No, but we’re feeding Steve and Thor,” Natasha said, swiping a doughnut.
"To everyone who never had that damn chance. Do you still love her?"
A-A-A-A
“Is it working?” Loki asked and Thor scowled.
"Something that won't hurt," he said. "Which cuts out half of what I'd offer."
at Samuel before scratching his chin.  Even Natasha seemed thrown by that for a moment before she came up to twine her arm through Nick’s, glancing between him and Samuel who was thrilled with the attention.
"So this is a Coulson thing," Tony said and nodded as if that made perfect sense. "Okay."
actually cares about your dating schedule.  Those that think they do are too vapid for a stray thought or concern.”
"You flew into—" Rhodey started and Thor was paying rapt attention.
"It probably was," Steve admitted.  "Still would have been nice to know something about it before now."
"Will you be alright?" Clint asked, flicking his fingers along Bruce's arm.
"They're going to keep damaging each other until they do.  Though they seem to come together well enough in a fight."
"Is that why the present is coming in late?" he asked.
Steve shook his head slightly at that, "Think he'll stick around because of it?"
"Oh for the love of—This isn't either of those things," Steve responded.  "There were things that I was told that I took at face value that I shouldn't have. And I'm sorry for doing that."
Thor blinked in surprise. "What?"
“Well that’s impressive,” Tony said and he paused a moment, one of Steve’s arms still loose around his waist. “So you know this whole dating for a year thing—”
"Perhaps opening presents would cheer you all!" Thor said, looking around at his companions and sighing before joining Jane and leaning against her side, arm slung over her shoulder.
Bruce nodded very slightly, letting his hands drop after another moment, "I'm not sure that's something to say 'you're welcome' to."
"Just because I bought it did not mean you had to hang it!" Tony said, Rhodey looking up and across the room.
"Clint, she has a chance at a normal life."  Bruce said, looking over at him, "I won't take that away from her.  I've done that to her once before and I won't do it again."
"Tony destroyed one of my planes," Rhodey said.
Steve set the second towel aside, neither advancing nor retreating. "No, I believe you didn't. But it's said now."
"Uh, hi, Thor," Tony managed. "So I hate to say that I can guess exactly what this is about—"
Natasha entered a pace behind her, arching an eyebrow at the room and the tension she could feel before she sidled over to Clint.
“Clint—”
"Doesn't it?  It sure seems pretty relevant," Steve protested.
"Your negativity is not affecting me," Tony said, shoulders tight in a way that showed it was.
"And after that?" Tony asked. "God, Steve, have you bothered to look at history since then? The world is always at war when you keep handing it weapons."
“Maybe don’t push that,” Steve said under his breath but Thor just barreled on.
Bruce shook his head, “It's about popular culture, Just go with it, that’s all we’re doing at this point.”
Bruce considered that for a long moment before nodding, "Yeah. I wouldn't know where to start to describe this," he gestured to the city as a whole though he meant the earth more than anything, "to anyone."
Rhodey gave Tony another fondly exhausted look before leaving the room as well, sitting back down next to Pepper and leveling Steve with a look across the room. Noticing it, Thor almost stepped between them but decided to allow Rhodey whatever he wanted to say. Steve looked up, catching Rhodey's look and pausing, "Yes, sir?"
Clint hopped back up, going to fetch those things and bringing whipped cream and blueberries as well. Bruce glanced in that direction, "Oh, I didn't realize we had berries."
"Well, I mean, all it takes is watching them.  And I don't mean during battle.  Because with the way the media's taken a love-hate relationship with you all everyone sees them during battle.  It's the small things, like the coffee and hot chocolate this morning, like how Natasha managed to give you all socks, but personalize even what's a really...boring gift, or like how Clint acts to diffuse tension when he can."
“Are you quite certain of that?”
Tony paused, pursing his lips as he considered. "The ball gag was pretty fucking hilarious actually."
"Except possibly Steve, though he kept blushing which is not something I want to poke with a stick."
Natasha waited until Bruce left before turning to Clint and pulling one of her legs up to her chest, the other one still hanging off the couch, "If we talk will we be able to see each other and speak tomorrow?"
"I figured I should probably eat before I lose all ability to concentrate," Bruce answered. His gaze moved to the tie, but he didn't ask. "Can I get you anything while I make my lunch?"
“I didn’t say he was cute,” Clint protested quickly. “I said his courtship was kinda cute.”
So instead he pressed a kiss to Steve’s temple, and let him hold him as long as he needed to as the rain fell.
And this, dear readers, is the chapter in which we discovered that VS's Clint muse is a complete film snob.  We have no explanation for this.  Meanwhile, Tony Stark is busy and doesn't have time for movies more than like once a year, fight me.
Tony graced Steve with a grin that lit up his entire face. "I welcome encouragement."
"We forgot it was Christmas," Tony said, handing Pepper a package.
Falling still again at that sound, Steve spoke quietly, "I asked, didn't I?"
Bruce looked over the top of his reading glasses where he was taking notes on his latest round of tests, "What?"
Loki's eyebrow arched at that, "So you and the Captain, then, hm?  Paragon of American virtue with the darling of the American tabloids."
"I'm sorry, Betty.  I wish..."
"Be prepared?" Clint said. "It means I can hunt him down."
"I think they both would like certain types of books, maybe," Bruce answered.  "Tony doesn't take the time to watch movies—and he could put them on as background noise in his lab—so my guess is he wouldn't take the time to read.  Clint, I still don't have any idea about him, but I don't think I want to get him a book at this point.  It just, doesn't seem like the thing to do this year."
"I am fine," Thor said, even though it was still raining outside.
"I'm not the only one, who will and who has."
Steve followed him over, looking into the studio before stepping past Tony into the room. He turned fully around, “This, Tony you really have thought of everything." He turned, meeting Tony's eyes. "Thank you," he said, and Tony abruptly snapped his eyes away.
“Uh-huh,” Tony managed, blankly, because he was standing there and staring.
since I have nothing better to do,” and Clint laughed, shaking his head.
“You trust me that much?” Loki asked after a beat and in the next second Mjölnir was back in Thor’s hand, causing Loki to jump.
“Alright, I’ll concede that point,” Tony said, backing out of the kitchen again. “Could someone remind me why Nick Fury is here?”
"So you're going to insist this is a big deal?" Tony asked and Clint's eyes narrowed, ready to shoot Tony for asking.
The soldier’s eyes widened, “Thirty…Do I want to know what you’re able to do with them now?”
“I…” Steve considered the other and finally nodded. “Alright. Sleep well, Tony.”
"Yeah," Clint said, voice strangled. "Wait, you even heard about that?"
Tony shrugged. "Mostly if you've been lucky in the last thousand years or so," he grinned, leaning back. "And if there's any evidence to back such a thing up."
“Excuse me?” Bruce asked in some surprise.
"Well, that's not up to me, now is it?" Loki sneered, "Should I prostrate myself and cast myself upon the mercy of Asgard?  Their mercy allows me life, but what a life."
"Can I have another hour to mope and cry before I have to answer that?" he asked, looking over and his eyes slid all the way to the door and he froze. "Or—or I suppose I could do it now."
He stopped for a long moment, considering. "I'll get them," he said, not wanting to add that he really didn't want anyone else touching them at the moment. He got out of the car quickly, not slamming the door but there was anger in the motion. Natasha closed her eyes at that, drawing a deep breath before opening her eyes again and heading back to SHIELD's base.
"I have got to find a way around that," Tony sighed.
She chuckled, trailing after him, "Maybe for an hour or two."
Bruce sighed, "Our lives went different ways a long time ago.  Probably before the last time we saw each other.  So, she's going to try to get another start on a normal life again.  We might see each other at conferences, who knows."
For a while all he could focus on was the feel of Steve’s skin and the way Steve was way too good of a kisser for his image. The feel of Steve against him blew past any left over teenage fantasy he'd ever had, because what was real was always more overpowering.
Rhodey had just rolled his eyes. "Yeah, yeah, big man finding a new element and saving our sorry asses that wouldn't have needed saving if you weren't being such an ass." He paused, glancing at Pepper. "Which was that? The being in my military zone or the bit where he went after Stane alone with the old reactor?"
Clint stared at him a long moment. "That's not funny," he managed, deadpan. "That's really not..." he turned to Fury and Natasha as if seeking confirmation that at least it was a joke.
"Well, as long as it doesn't end up in my floor," Bruce said.
Bruce frowned very slightly at that, "You should have been told."
Betty's eyes narrowed, "You won't hurt me, Bruce."
Clint just laughed again and shook his head.
"No, I couldn't imagine one," Clint drawled, looking up and down the streets. The lights were cheery, and some other desperate people were moving around, looking for last minute turkeys and gifts.
"And having Captain America living a floor or two away instead of in comic books and newsreels?" she asked, watching him closely.
"Yeah," he said. "I compared the Hulk to a whale shark, god help me."
Bruce paused for a moment and then turned and headed up the stairs.  He emerged onto the roof a few minutes later, pulling his coat closer and looking around, "Clint?"
Charles' lips curled upward as he appraised Steve, "You must be Captain Rogers."
She offered him a ghost of a smile, "We might try.  But we've never been much for communicating when we're apart.  We'll see each other at conferences, maybe get coffee if we're in the same city, but we won't keep in touch.  And, maybe that's okay."
“That may be preemptive anyway,” Clint said, walking past and an armful of presents. “The morning is young yet.”
Bruce considered disseminating and pretending that he had no idea what Tony was talking about, but knew that the other would keep asking until he figured it out, "We talked.  I kissed him."
Natasha snorted at that, sarcastic amusement lighting in her eyes, "Small things can be dangerous."
Bruce glanced at the boxes again, "Do you want company?"
Steve slid an arm around Tony's waist and pulled him close for another kiss, "Your floor or mine?"
Stepping into the kitchen, Clint paused at seeing the other two there, but a small mew from Natasha's direction brought him over instantly. "Is that a kitten?"
"Great, anything else we need?"  Steve asked.
Charles' gaze darted to Clint, the unfamiliar mind in concert with his powers still adjusting to his relatively new brain letting more of the other's emotions seep through than he expected.  He pulled away quickly and went back to rifling through the bar, "I'd be more concerned about the Norse God than anyone else.  I still can't believe you hid the bourbon."
"I know the man was frozen for decades, but he needs to think before he speaks and not assume that people agree with him," Bruce said, carefully not looking at anyone else.
"And so long as they remain that way I won't be in a position where I have to make that choice."  She rose gracefully, leaning her hands on his desk, "The fact that I'm here at all, should tell you something.  I'm here, I'm still your agent." There was the hint of a "for now" in her tone, but it was fleeting and uncertain.
Charles paused briefly at that description, "They rather are. I still have some of the oldest ones from my family hidden away somewhere, but I can't bring them out any longer. The kitsch is all you can find these days, sadly. Did you adequately dispose of the parental ones?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"That," Clint blinked wide eyed at him. "Is a while."
Tony's jaw worked before he let out a low breath. "That—that's really hot."
Bruce felt his face heat at that thought as he made his way over to settle in one of the chairs and Natasha's lips curled upward into a smirk. Clint flipped her off as Thor bustled around, happily handing out gifts to where everyone had established themselves, leaving his pile next to Jane.
“Treatises?” Clint arched his brows. “Really? Most people relax with movies you know.”
"The past makes the present what it is, whether you're looking to the future or not," Steve replied, frowning and coming a bit further into the shop.  "I'm not saying dwell there, but don't dismiss it either."
Shifting his hands to Clint's shoulders and leaning back to look him in the eyes, Bruce frowned, unconsciously using the plural again, "We did.  And you'll be found no matter how far into that trouble you get yourself."
"I'm glad," he said, wanting to bury those days and knowing they never really would.
Steve blinked and drew his attention away from the screen, “Film’s come an awfully long way.”
“Yes, well, I didn’t expect much more in the long run,” Loki said, looking away and Thor had still never bothered to turn the lights on. His brother’s face was sharp in the dim lights that seeped in the windows from the outside. The lights of a living, breathing city, full of people celebrating their holiday and Thor took a deep breath.
"Silk scarves or non-cardboard puzzles," Clint said promptly. He did not mention friendship necklaces. "Or... sharp things if you can find the quality."
Letting out a breath between them, Tony drew back and grinned. "Stubbornness is attractive, you know. Determination."
"Then you're going to have to face it.  I've got your back, Clint, no matter what.  And as best I can."
"Which I suppose means you celebrated it with those mortals you've fallen in with."
The soldier met Tony's eyes as he answered, "I have some old friends I need to see."
"Thor," Tony said. "Don't tell either of them I said that though."
The door pushed open again, Thor slumping in from where he'd been out in the city, still looking for his brother.
Natasha sheathed her knife as she rose, grabbing her coat she followed Tony.  Steve shook his head after them as Bruce got to his feet as well, "Alright, we'd better get going then, Thor, if we hope to find a decent Yule log in that time."
"I just miss him," Clint said again and pushed himself to his feet. "You know, you should talk to Nick. I think he misses... whatever weird thing you people ever did."
"Not quite how I'd describe me," Clint remarked, one hand making a lazy circle in the air.
Grinning, he lifted her off her feet, turning in a circle before setting her down and kissing her gently. "I'm glad you came. I have gifts for Darcy and Selvig as well if they would like them but I am verily glad you came."
She laughed, "Like I said last time I was here: good people."
"You think you can do far more than you can, Thor.  You overestimate your abilities," Loki replied, expression cold.
Tony tried not to giggle. "Well, in my defense the shower thing worked out
“I haven’t spoken to him since handing in my report on the Chitauri,” she answered, crossing her arms over her chest and focusing her gaze across the kitchen.
“Good,” Thor said. “Then what is the problem?”
"And yet you're one of the only people I've ever met to describe him as such," Tony said. "But no, it's good that someone apparently liked him."
"Because watching you pretend not to be jealous is much more illuminating," Tony said, tone casual.
"I can get it out if you insist," Tony said, shaking his head. "Though I was holding it in reserve for the time I convince Rogers he should try to get drunk."
Steve's face was flushed, but it could easily be attributed to the temperature of the water he'd just been under, "If you'll give me a couple of minutes I'll be out of your way.”
Bruce looked up at him, "To who?"
Bruce's eyebrows rose incredulously, "Elephants and kittens?  That's rather a variety."
“I’m saying the Other Guy sure seems to be on a courtship binge,” Clint said. “I know he recognized Betty back—before—but this is way more proactive than just recognizing me.”
Pepper settled her head against his shoulder, considering the flooring, "What's the general design on this one so far?"
Bruce couldn't help but laugh at that, "And what were the conclusions?"
“Uh, for what?” Tony managed.
"I still want a picket fence," Clint muttered, leaning his head back.
Fury snorted. "Unlikely."
"It has so far," he said, Clint eying him sideway when he brought out the toast and jam.
Thor grinned at her as the others slowly moved toward their gifts, Tony carefully avoiding the gift from Steve as he opened the pair of socks from Natasha, drinking coffee still with one hand. Steve opened the book about the Dodgers from Bruce, offering the scientist a bright smile before looking over the information on the front flap.  Bruce nodded once, opening the gift from Tony and arching an eyebrow as he read the information that promised that the fountain was soothing and relaxing, his lips curved upward ever so slightly.
"What was it—two hours ago?" Clint offered.
Christmas this year,” Steve said. “We should invite people. On purpose.”
Tony looked over at him and then moved over to the door. “Good morning, Thor.”
"Is there a reason you blush at the word fondue?" Clint asked as Tony frowned after Thor. "Or is that just a Tony thing?" he added under his breath since Tony was distracted.
Loki's lips curled upward and he tried not to think about blond hair and blue eyes, "Well, obviously it has to be someone who could keep up with our stamina."
"I can't," Clint repeated and was gone before he could be asked again.
"And how did Liam handle that?" Tony asked, scratching the kitten's ears before moving forward. "Alright, so you kissed Clint and he bolted. You realize he was sleeping with Phil Coulson right?"
Bruce paused, pulling one of his hands out of his pocket, taking one of Clint’s hands and squeezing, "Well, then we need to see if we can engineer some arrows that'll do more damage to him next time."
"I have not yet begun to whine about this to you," Charles replied, falling into step with the other man.  "I could if you would like.  I can go on for an hour alone about how my voice doesn't sound right."
"Because it usually is," Tony said, tilting his head back slightly.
A short while later, Bruce set a plate with a simple chicken quesadilla down next to Clint, lowering himself down to sit on the floor nearby. His gaze moved to the pile of ties, categorizing the colors absently as he debated whether to say anything or wait for Clint to feel like speaking.
him and there's this hole that's never been put back together."
“Don’t mess with my babies,” Tony said, tone light but his word choice showed the cracks in the joke. He shook his head. “Thank you again, Bruce,” he managed. “Good night.”
Tony paused and shrugged it off. "Do you like the fondue set?"
“That we actually remembered Christmas this year or that Nick Fury is here?” Steve asked as the door pushed open again, Rhodey strolling in with a box of doughnuts in one hand.
Clint took a deep breath, slowly letting it out as the rain lashed against the glass. “At this point New York might just have to get used to new weather patterns.”
"I see no reason to celebrate their holidays," came the icy response as he dropped the illusion he still hadn't released, so that he was no longer dividing his attention and energies.
"Here, sir, but not really your agent anymore," Clint said, coming down the stairs, the kitten with Steve down in the gym, mewing him on. "What do you want?"
Steve leaned his forehead against Tony's, "What sort of things did you talk about?"
Steve frowned at the 'Blondie' comment but simply rose and went over to the refrigerator. Pepper shook her head, "Tony, the goal is not actually to get everyone you meet drunk. You remember that right?"
Natasha smiled easily at that, "Yes, but not immediately so usually."
Tony frowned, not sure he liked the idea of an apology any more than the other things when Clint gave a sharp whistle across the room. "Hey, guys, look up."
"Sure," Tony said, bouncing lightly up on his feet and tucking the tablet away. "Come right on up. Though, I'll warn you now, you're moving into a tower of insomniacs. I can promise that Clint and Natasha are probably ignoring each other in the gym right now."
"Um, Stark might appreciate something that explodes?" Clint said. "Hey, do you think he and Bruce might appreciate the thought behind like a kids’ chemistry set or something?"
"I bought out the store," Tony shrugged.
“Because I generally love interrupting super-secret spy things,” Tony said, putting the box on the table next to too many scrambled eggs. “Who on Earth has been cooking?”
"We're getting dressed and then going for a walk," she answered, simply.
Eyes widening, Tony let out a breath of shock and relief and spread his arms out. “Yeah, yeah, I could—we could do that.”
Clint hesitated before he stood up. "Come on," he said. "There's tech to test and people to save."
“The theatrical?” Tony asked, glancing over. “Even I know he put out a new edition of these films.”
"Because it's Christmas Eve and any tree I manage to find is going to be what's left over," Steve answered.
"No that," he shook his head, digging around in the side bar of the limo before producing peanuts, eating one before handing her the rest without thinking about it. "We're best friends. That'll never change. But it feels like it hasn't. Not that I ever say no to fantastic sex, and seeing you more often than usual but Pep, are we friends or lovers? We could be both I just don't think we are."
Jane offered him a smile, "Well, we would have, but I didn't know until Darcy handed me the ticket and Eric drove us to the airport."
Bruce looked around once they were outside again and asked something that had been on his mind for a while, "What's Asgard like?"
Crossing the roof and pausing a couple of feet back he finally drew himself together enough until he was sitting next to Clint, "Bit cold up here."
"Physical violence is his love language?" Clint offered. "Screwed up, man."
Bruce rose and stretched, "I think I'm going to leave the rest of you to wrestle the sets into the cupboards."
“What do you mean?” Thor asked, his elbows braced on his knees and his hands in front of him.
“Right,” Tony said, having been thinking of something entirely differently. “There’s a reason the ground rule is Lehnsherr doesn’t get to be near my machines.”
Considering him for half a moment longer, Tony pivoted on one heel, stomping out of the room. Clint waited until he thought he was far enough away and looked over at Steve. "Oh my fucking god, Rogers, are you a moron? Is that normal for you? You weren't this defective earlier tonight."
"They should get over that," Clint said, dumping dishes into the washer.
Thor trailed after him, looking at the books as he passed, realizing he was picking books out for Loki in the back of his mind, seeing another he thought he might convince Sif to read before shaking his head and focusing on Bruce's back instead.
"Lot more complicated than that," Tony replied. "It's sortta a love and hate and generally really fucked up thing. But he's almost definitely here because Thor is."
Taking another breath, Clint glanced up at him and very carefully managed not to slide away from the touch, much as he wanted to. "Yeah?" he asked, voice hoarser then he wanted it to be.
"You changed once," Thor said softly as if he truly thought he could as well.
She pivoted to face him fully, a hand rising to the left side of his face, her thumb barely brushing his cheekbone under his eye patch, "I needed to be uncompromised when Clint needed me.  There's nothing else to work out."
Tony just shook his head, shaking as both his hands slid around to clutch at Steve’s shoulder blades, trying to drag him closer. “It—it’s not the same thing.”
Steve finally leaned in, just a little and still carefully not touching Tony at all, "Well, I've never been one to put much stock in 'supposed to'."
"I was under the impression you didn't like kittens," Natasha replied, leaning a hip against the table, only sparing Tony a brief glance.
"He—" Tony frowned, brows drawing together. "Wait. You actively went to Rhodey and asked him about me? You mentioned that at the elevator but—”
“Is he going to try anything?” Clint asked, basically ignoring Steve, voice low and Thor glanced over.
The corner of Tony’s mouth twitched and he shook his head, glancing down at the fondue sets he held in his hands. “It—it doesn’t mean anything,” he said. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I really will just go.”
"You're sure the other half of this equation doesn't?" She asked.
Because while each tie was dark and could almost pass as black, they were navy or dark green with geometric patterns and occasional flashes of color, expressing in each and every one of them how much Phil was not just your average black suit that took orders blindly.
Except only a little while later Bruce turned the corner toward the kitchen, his latest test results in hand that he was skimming until he saw Clint. He glanced over the other man and the boxes beside him, and although he didn't conceal his presence he also didn't speak.
"I can," he offered, rising and moving after Tony.
"He told a live press conference that his father never told him he loved him," Clint offered. "I suggest you start watching those. He said some crazy shit the pundits pretended wasn't true."
“You know I’m holding you to that,” Steve said, leaning back.
"Can you be more specific?" Clint asked.
“Yes, Bruce and the others mentioned it,” Thor said, his voice still calm.
Pulling very lightly on Tony's arm, Steve let go, "Come on, I was going to brew some coffee."
"That makes you sound sortta like a petulant child, cap," Clint said, finally turning back to hanging lights. About that time they heard a muffled yelp, and something like Tony swearing.
Except Tony's swearing got closer followed by a "Goddamnit put me down," right before Thor reappeared, actually carrying Tony back into the room.
"I didn't say I did."  She paused, "Hill told me what you did with the cards.  You know Clint's going to want those back."
And eventually he appeared at Thor’s doorway.
"I suppose it does," Tony said, craning his neck back and Clint's hands clenched.
"Well, it's a hard act to follow—attempting to destroy one world and attempting to conquer another," Loki replied with a shrug.
"Everything in this city just reminds me of what's gone," Clint said and rubbed a hand over his chest. "It's not better and it's getting better so slowly."
Steve glanced at her, "Alright, that's probably true."
misses you," Tony said, though Thor had returned to Asgard the day before, some rebellion flaring up at the edges of the reconstructed bifrost.
Steve just blinked at him.  Pepper shook her head, "And that still doesn't cover what he did after coming home."
“He is?” Bruce asked.
Before Loki could breathe again, Thor slammed him into the wall by his shoulders, the bricks underneath crumbling with the force of impact. "I would rather have my brother back," he said. "I would rather you use your time here for redemption but I know you will not and so we will keep chasing each other but
"Oh, fine.  I just sent Clint running because I tripped all over his current troubles," Bruce replied, still watching the city moving below.
A-A-A-A
Steve lifted his head, meeting Tony’s eyes, "I just want to be there when you step into trouble is all."
"I'm just trying to align my memories with what that implies," Steve hedged, watching Tony's posture shift.
"Still," Clint said, shifting again and moving around slightly so he could approach Bruce from one side.
"Dismissed," Tony said, waving a hand and cutting off the entire top half of the design, restarting it.
Clint looked at him for a minute and whirled on one heel, slamming the glass door on his way out and making Tony wince. Bruce glanced between Tony and Steve before following Clint.  Steve drew a deep breath before turning to Tony, "You want to tell me what happened?"
"I cannot express the extent to which I do not care," Tony said, mirroring Fury's posture for a moment and then realizing what he was doing, dropping his hands to his sides instead.
"What has she gotten herself recently?"  Natasha removed a pair of sunglasses from the display, dark enough to conceal the eyes of the person wearing them, and with frames designed to block the sunlight from the peripherals as well—minimizing distraction.
"New York is nice," Darcy said, craning her neck back to look at the ceiling. "Good to see you still are all muscular like," she added, hitting Thor on the arm and starting to poke around Tony's bar.
“Only if you can,” she said faintly and they stared at each other for a moment, sitting on opposite couches.
Steve offered a wry smile at that, "Well, it's appreciated.  I think Natasha was ready to smother me if she ended up with another cold shower.  Thank you for your time."
"She didn't tell him that Agent Coulson died," Steve answered. "In fact, from what little I picked up in the debrief she told him not to 'do that to himself.' I can only take a guess at what that might mean."
A-A-A-A
Bruce pulled back, brown eyes wide as he drew a breath, "I... That is--"
Bruce entered, pausing when he saw the kitten.  Although he never voiced it he still wasn't sure what the thought about the kitten on the counter.  Shaking his head and smiling faintly he moved over toward the fridge, "I see he's eaten.  Have you?"
"He's been in your tower for weeks and he still didn't have a name?" Charles asked, sounding offended on behalf of the kitten.
He laughed, shaking his head slightly. "God, Nat, you have never mastered the art of meaningless comfort, have you?"
"Yes and no," came the answer.  "I've been wanting to do it for a while, but the action itself, yeah, because I didn't really intend for that to happen."
A voice spoke from the door, "The papers are already dealing with the fall out, and seeing what they can do on their own for naming all of you. Just be glad the Bugle's going gentle so far." Pepper said as she entered the kitchen, "Tony you didn't tell me everyone was staying over."
“Because Natasha asked for him to come and we all agreed,” Clint said, sitting on the bar that ran around the living room.
Natasha withdrew from his space, watching as each of the Asgardians took hold of the Tesseract's container. With a turn on the end Thor held, the two of them vanished in a rush of blue light, leaving the remaining Avengers to go their own ways and sort out their footing in light of all that had happened. Natasha opened the back door of the sedan she'd arrived in, pulling out the single bag of belongings Bruce had left behind on the Helicarrier and handing it to him. The doctor took them with a softly murmured thanks before getting into Tony's convertible. Tony waved at all the others, having quickly mentioned to Natasha the offer to move in with them before shaking Steve's hand and hopping into his own car.
"Without cutting down a tree in Central Park," Bruce responded with a smile.
“No one should ever listen to you,” Tony called over his shoulder, teasing again. “You give the worst advice and the worst example to follow.”
Bruce quietly considered the archer before nodding slightly, "Are you going to make it?"
"What does the necklace look like?" Natasha asked, considering the earrings he was looking at.
"I can promise that," he replied, nodding very slightly.
"I heard them discussing fathers," Thor said. "I do not think people often tell them they are strong, only good warriors." He shifted and stopped walking, looking down at her. "But I am glad you seem to understand the difference."
Thor beamed at her, hoping that exchanging gifts would bring the group closer together. He carefully focused on leaning against Jane's warmth instead of who he missed. As no one else seemed to be moving, Natasha shook her head and pulled Thor's gift closer, carefully opening the elegant box, her eyes lighting up as she withdrew the golden knife set.  She tested one against the pad of her thumb, smiling when she nearly cut herself, "Thor, these are magnificent."
She rested her hands on his shoulders, still smiling up at him, "They're both going to be disappointed they missed the chance to come out, but Darcy went home for Christmas and Eric had plans already.  I'm so glad to hear from you, and to get to see you."
"You sure you don't want to do the honors?" Tony asked.
Starting to obviously relax, Tony started to lean back as Clint laughed. "Pepper, please tell Tony this doesn't count as a replacement," Rhodey said, shuffling the box so she could see it.
“No,” Clint said, eyes sharp again. “But that doesn’t meant there aren’t
"It's not?" Thor asked, looking over.
me,” he repeated, arms actually starting to shake a little bit. “Tasha, I…” he shook his head, finally turning his head slightly toward her.
"In the eyes," Clint said, gesturing up. "When he changes, that's what shifts first. I'm used to seeing it from a distance, not up close like that."
Loki's hand glowed again and he put force behind his shove against Thor, "You're surprised?"
"I think we both know you wouldn't poison my drink," Tony smirked. "But stabbing me in the face is still an option, huh?"
“Nngh,” Tony managed, waving a hand lazily in a circle. “You did fine.”
Squirming, Tony leaned back enough to twist the towel off, pushing Steve back so he could get a look at him and his mouth went totally dry. “Jesus fucking Christ,” he repeated, almost reverent, hands on Steve's shoulders and his arms straight out. Steve shifted under that scrutiny, the color that rose to his cheeks obvious and nothing that could be attributed to the heat around them anymore. He stepped forward again, if only to get Tony to stop looking.
"He's done neither because I've done nothing to antagonize him," Loki responded, rising smoothly.  "If you both will excuse me, I have places to be."
"You have an entire team full of people who'll catch you," Bruce said, watching Clint and not sure what to do with how quiet the rumblings in the back of his mind had gotten.
"Well, we both come from rich families, right? Have you ever been to a party hosted by those sorts?" Tony asked. "Everyone's smiling and lying and stabbing each other in the back."
Tony finally sprang back into motion, bringing the phone up to frown at the pattern. "Too busy. I don't think busy and the Hulk on the same floor is recipe for success."
"Tony, you haven't given me a straight answer about anything short of which floor I was going to live on since I got here," Steve was pretty sure that was an exaggeration, but he had been avoiding keeping track of how often Tony dodged a question when it was put to him.
Steve paused, finally shifting under Tony to turn over and face him, careful not to knock the other man off and wrapping his hands around his waist. “You say that like it could be a bad thing."
"But then, why..." Steve looked lost and disoriented.
Natasha sighed, they could be there all night.  She pulled out her phone and dialed Clint's number before she thought about it, "I'm calling to let them know we're going to be late."
Pepper's lips quirked up at the clatter of Steve dropping the second frying pan he'd been pulling out of the cupboard he'd finally found it in. Bruce smiled, amused, "Sounds like you've said that before."
"I won't let you take me back," Loki grit out in response.
Tony accepted the olive, pleased to have mooched something off a god of chaos. “So what the hell brings you here anyway? Like, without the bullshit."
