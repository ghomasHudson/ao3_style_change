Tony struggled to remain lucid as the drugs tried to lull him to sleep. He needed to be sharp in order to help Steve, whom he'd never seen in such a state before. "Anything's possible," he replied, glancing up at the other man. If Steve could be frozen solid and revived, then it wasn't out of the realms of possibility that Bucky had also been revived. "We're working on too little here," Tony decided, his brow furrowing. "What we need to do is find out for certain. I'm not doubting you, Cap. If you say it's Bucky, then it's Bucky. We just have to know what we're dealing with first." He offered Steve what he hoped was an encouraging smile, and then added, "Tracking him down should be our first priority."
"Oh, it would be very grim, indeed. The hammer twists the mind of any who are good at heart. Mjolnir would guard me from its witchery, though, so fear not."
The teasing was turning from light and fun to somewhat uncomfortable. Coulson had actually wiped more than a few videos specifically to keep from letting himself drift in that direction. When he couldn't keep a straight face any longer, he smiled and shook his head. "No. Not the way you're thinking." He didn't want Barton to think he was a complete pervert. He might have had one or two (or a few dozen) masturbatory fantasies about his coworker, but surprisingly few of them were fueled by anything grounded in reality. "I have some moral standing to uphold."
"So, you're thinking it's a spoof. Which means he's trying to draw us out. Or at least draw his brother out," Tony said, putting down his own file. He'd already skimmed through Bruce's before his date despite his assertions to Steve that he intended to ignore anything that looked like work. He glanced at Fury. "That's it, then? You just shoved Thor in a bunker with a Rubix cube and told him to stay put, didn't you?" The comment was met with an imperceptible eyebrow twitch, and Tony nodded. "Thought so."
"Sit," Phil ordered simply before grabbing one of Clint's belt loops and dragging him back to his stool.
It was on the tip of his tongue to deny it, a knee jerk reflex that he fought back with an effort. "Yeah, I was terrified, actually. You were hurt, back up wasn't where it should have been... things could have ended a lot differently." What had ended up a mild scar and a decent story for Clint could just as easily have been his last mission. It had come close enough to be terrifying, close enough to worry Coulson in a way he'd realized after the fact wasn't entirely appropriate. "As it turns out, I'm actually incapable of not worrying about you." He reached out to cup Clint's cheek. "You're too important to me."
Clint chuckled. "Or, y'know, unconscious in a pile of after action reports," he pointed out. He was pretty sure he remembered being fussed at about drooling on leather pillows and having his boots on the furniture a time or two, as well. He shrugged, self-consciously fiddling with the coffee mug again. "It's nice, though. I mean, we're cleared to the same levels, so we can talk and bitch about stupid shit that other people pulled." He grinned, stretching his foot out under the table to let his leg rest against Phil's. "You've been pretty good at keeping me sane."
“I appreciate that,” Phil agreed readily. He trusted that Barnes really did want to do what was best, but he also knew that Hydra had made it as difficult as possible. “I don’t want to treat him like he’s on death row, but we need to be careful for his sake, for Captain Rogers, for Stark. There’s a lot on the line for the team, and it will benefit all of us if we do everything in our power to make it work. For the moment, he’s sleeping. I think it would be in our best interest to get some rest too.”
Logan slowed his thrusts slightly as he relished Scott's orgasm, the way his lover's ass squeezed him tight, the ragged cry of pleasure. The feral mutant allowed himself to cum a moment later, growling his release as he spilled himself inside Scott's tight heat. As he felt his arms starting to give out, he shifted to lay beside Scott, drawing him close and pressing a kiss to his lips, "Love ya," before he reached over and dragged Nat in for one, too. "Thanks for the fun, darlin'," he murmured.
Tony nodded, looking as solemn as he ever got. "You got it," he said, giving Steve a clap on the shoulder. It was still weird, feeling affectionate toward Steve. Especially in a mission situation. He looked to the pilot as the plane bobbed and she announced they were on approach. The cargo door droned open, and Tony gave Bruce's parachute a final tug. "Not gonna join the chute-less club?"
"Are you still put out about your little friend? Honestly, water under the bridge, and the other one isn't even dead anymore. You take things far too seriously. All is fair in love and war, and that was war. This is something more... subtle. I've found a few new friends." Loki offered Logan a cold smile. "Mutants, I believe you call them. I believe that your people can help me and that I can help them. We all want something - a place to belong, a world that sees us for what we truly are. Tell me, if I were to offer you something of value, do you think you'd be willing to give me something of value in return?"
"Yeah?" Steve nodded his agreement. "Just something light. I think we've got a lot more interesting things to do than eating." He'd intended for Tony to come home to the suite put to rights. Instead he'd managed some light housekeeping and then collapsed into bed. It was annoying. At the same time, Steve realized in hindsight that he was glad he'd put the bulk of his energy toward resting up for Tony's arrival instead. "If you aren't too tired. If you are, maybe I should be getting you to bed. Uh, in a totally sweet and caring way."
Logan nodded. He wasn't about to tell someone they'd made a wrong choice. A man's decision was his own. "Guess it's easier when you can remember everything that happened beforehand," he muttered, absently rubbing at the skin between his knuckles. He sighed, then looked back at Steve. "So I guess you're almost in the same shoes as me."
"Starting to," Steve allowed with a flicker of a smile. "Fitz-Simmons and Bruce figured something out. They... we needed... with you gone..." He took a shaky breath and said, "I think I'm going to need to talk about it when I can cry a lot more and be wearing a lot less metal. I'm sure you built it out of something that doesn't rust, but I hate to take my chances." It didn't stop Steve from staying as close as humanly possible to Tony. While Thor led the way with Loki, Steve's gaze followed them. "I get that we need him to help Clint," he allowed, "but..." He wasn't even sure what to ask, but he hadn't missed the pity on Tony's face when he looked at the god. "He's a liar, Tony. It's what he does."
The words were hardly comforting, but Coulson rose stiffly and made his way out of the room. There was more to the story. There was more to the story that might very well save Steve's career and Coulson's sanity, and Fury was still sitting on it. As much as he would have liked to chalk that up to the man being a hardass or a complete psychopath, he'd known Nick Fury long enough to know better. And that was the part that really scared him.
Bruce smiled faintly, nodding. He knew that a lot of it was their sense of duty. He also knew a fair bit of the motivation was curiosity. Bruce himself almost wanted to go over the telemetry from Tony's suit, see what he could figure out about the weapon and how Fitz's nanomachines had worked. At the same time, he was exhausted, and the idea of anything reminding him of Tony nearly dying was a little too much to handle until he got some rest. "Alright, then. I'll have Jarvis get it on everybody’s calendar. You two make sure you take a minute to eat and rest. This stuff isn't as urgent as what we've all been dealing with," he warned with a shake of his finger as he stepped out of the lab.
That was putting it mildly. Natasha had to fight back a wince on Steve's behalf. The thought of not doing what she'd been trained to do actually made her ill. Being in the cell and being in constant pain had been nothing compared to the boredom brought on by those things. She could handle a lot of things: uselessness wasn't one of them. "Considering you're the only one who paid any kind of price for this long-term, I think it's fair to say official sanctions aren't necessary." She looked at Fury as if challenging him to say otherwise.
"I think half the reason Natasha looked so pissed in the infirmary is because the medical team was supposed to be allowed to look the prisoners over before she could talk to them. What they really wanted was for her to sleep. Something tells me she's probably pacing the halls like a creepy Russian tiger instead." He couldn't help smiling, though. Sexy as hell and great in bed or not, she also happened to be one of the most capable, controlled people he'd had the pleasure of going into the field with. "I get the feeling she won't get a crack at them until after the meeting with Fury. If they even let her get close. She kind of seemed like taking them in was a consolation prize at best."
For the moment Loki was rather glad that Stark could barely see. He drifted toward the bathroom, staring hard into the mirror. Even as he watched, Loki could see the haze of blue darkening and solidifying. His eyes remained their usual cool blue, but he felt a surge of panic that was all his own at the idea of the transformation being out of his hands. Perhaps the stupid gun had done more damage than he gave it credit for. Loki drew himself up to full height and stepped back into the room. "The weapon you used, Stark, it took energy from the hammer, did it not?"
Victor pressed in close to Phil once more, unzipping his jeans and grinding himself against Phil's ass. His other hand slid up the back of Phil's head, pressing his face into the wall. "You're gonna feel good. I bet you're nice and tight."
Clint had to struggle to pick from among several ideas that sprang to mind. Finally, his eyes fell on the armchair in one corner of the suite's living room, and he smiled faintly before looking back at Darien. He dragged the man to his feet and over to the chair. Settling onto it, he gave his cock a few lazy strokes, leaning back and giving Darien an imperious look. He patted one leather-clad thigh with his free hand. "Straddle me," he murmured, his voice a low, commanding purr.
Clint had possessed razor-sharp reflexes and peak human speed since his mid teens. He'd trained for years to hone every muscle and bone in his body for battle. None of that explained the bizarre strength and agility with which he leapt at the distracted god, obsidian-black hammer in hand, and swung at Loki's ribs as his bow clattered to the floor in the place he'd stood a moment before.
Tony's eyes flicked to Steve's face. The man was a sight to behold, his eyelids lowered, full lips parted and face flushed. The billionaire just wanted to fuck Steve senseless, but even Tony knew better than to think he was up to the task. Focusing on his 'work' instead, Tony let go of Steve's cock with his hand, bracing it on the man's perfect abs as he slowly dove further down his lover's shaft, stopping only when his lips were wrapped around the base. He began bobbing his head more steadily, each time bottoming out on Steve's cock before drawing back just far enough to get a breath and then diving back down.
Some mild violence in this chapter. Please avoid it if you're bothered by such things. Though why you would be reading this story in that case is somewhat beyond me.
Logan's hands settled on her narrow waist for a moment, just enjoying the feeling of her perfectly toned body moving fluidly against him in response to Scott's attentions. Slowly, he moved his hands up to the curve of her breasts, fingers tweaking her nipples. He pressed himself firmly against her back, letting her feel the swell of his arousal against her ass through his jeans as he leaned down to lick and suck at her neck. He could hear her pulse accelerate as Scott's tongue started working her. "Guess he is just as good," he rumbled in her ear, sounding more amused than surprised. One of his hands strayed down to run through Scott's hair and Logan's hazel eyes stayed fixed on his lover over Natasha's shoulder as Scott worked his magic.
Steve smiled until he reached up to touch Tony's face and felt the tears. "Hey, I'm here. I'm fine." He carefully kissed away the trails of tears and then Tony's lips. If he'd had a choice, he would have told Tony to stay there in bed with him for a week instead of working, but they both knew that wasn't an option. "We aren't losing this. It's too good, Tony. We shouldn't even both be here now in the same time and place. That has to mean something."
Loki smiled, feeling the first hint of amusement he had since things went so wrong at the SHIELD base. "I do love the way that you think, Victor. Don't worry, you won't miss a moment of the action. I may even give you a bit of play time all your own for helping me so much." The god drew himself up to full height and ignored the aching of his ribs. "We aren't done with the Avengers yet."
The move was enough to divert Steve's attention momentarily. He looked back at Logan, dazed, and found himself nodding as if the man couldn't read consent in the way he gasped at the touch. Though he wasn't about to stop moving inside of Tony, the duel stimulation was anything but unpleasant. It was wonderful. It was hard to picture anything being as sexy as Tony coming undone beneath him, but the thought of what he and Logan could do to one another without even being sore the next morning had some serious potential as well.
Scott have in to the wild, almost frantic action unreservedly. He couldn't explain the desperation as anything but a probably unhealthy response to Logan's upcoming incarceration. Not that it mattered. "I need you." Scott meant it in more than just the immediate sense. He didn't want to go forward into a strange new life alone no matter how codependent that made him.
Ducking her head, Natasha hid a smile. It was almost painfully cute, and no matter how worried she was, it was hard not to feel good about Bruce getting a date. If anyone could use stress relief from time to time, it was Banner. She looked back to Simmons. "We'll be sure to bring him back in one piece for you." Without another word, she moved forward and left the pair of them in the relative privacy of being toward the back of the pack.
Scott's hips set their own pace unbidden, riding the movement until he had to stop or risk coming in his pants like a horny teenager. "Maybe you do," he agreed, "but only because I lack any sense of subtlety." He canted his hips and used his leverage holding Logan to roll the man onto his back. Immediately Scott started tearing open his fly and jerking down Logan's jeans before doing the same with his own. "Fabric is cumbersome. And pointless. And there's too much of it."
"You too, hairball," Scott answered, leaning into the next kiss. He didn't meant to push or to try and molest the man considering the tone of the day. It wasn't the time for sex. Or it was the perfect time. He was beginning to lose sight of which was which as he slid his tongue into Logan's mouth. The man had that effect on him. "This okay? I can back down if this is... if it's a bad time, I can cool it down."
Scott leaned back against Logan with a happy sigh and snatched the last shot from the tray, downing it. "You still up to being our designated driver, baby?"
Tony didn't have to ask what it meant. He was being afforded a brief private moment. He glanced over at Steve's abandoned sketchpad, taking it gently from the desk and looking at it with genuine fascination. It was a bit of a stab in the heart as he realized that every one of the sketches was of him. He set the pad aside and looked up at Steve, tugging him close and pressing a kiss to his lips. "I'm gonna be fine," he insisted, wishing he could somehow make sure the words were a guarantee.
"Sorry," Steve murmured with a sigh. He followed Tony's lips and couldn't resist stealing another quick kiss. It felt good, and he let some of the tension fall away from his shoulders. "I am, though. Terrified. I can't stop thinking that the things that matter the most to me are all about to change. How am I supposed to expect you to sit here waiting? This might never be okay, Tony. I know you and Bruce, you can do damn near anything, but this is..." Steve tried to stop himself from speaking. There were worries a lot more basic than that on his mind. He shifted uneasily and then shrugged one slim shoulder. "Plus I was thinking that maybe yesterday with the bad light and the mask and... that maybe you didn't see just how bad this is. So maybe you'd freak out a little today. And that makes me feel like I'm going to freak out a little."
"Don't worry about it," Clint said, stroking Natasha's hair. He wanted to kiss her, to pull her out of the bed and hold her until she felt better, no matter how long that took. Instead Clint placed himself as close to the bed as he could. "We'll get Loki. Right now, you just need to get better." Clint hated that she was in pain and wanted to take it away from her however he could. He was quiet for a moment. "I'm sorry that I didn't stop him from taking you."
"Giving ourselves explosive gas is also a viable approach," Clint deadpanned, though he couldn't bite back his smirk for too long as he led them over to the rows and rows of picnic tables. Finding one that didn't look like it was covered in West Nile virus, he settled in, making sure to pat the bench next to him. He tucked into the funnel cake and potatoes, grinning at the first few bites. "God, I'd forgotten how good this stuff is. Phil, I hope you realize this is going straight to my thighs. Right now. As we speak." It wasn't, of course. Clint still had the metabolism of a teenager.
Scott swallowed and nodded. "I could use it, yeah," he agreed. The man looking at him was Logan, was the Logan he was slowly coming to know on a far more intimate level than he'd ever expected. The idea that he could lose that man as fast as he'd found him was terrifying. Scott found himself hoping that Agent Barton was wrong and worrying even more that he was right.
Bruce raised an eyebrow, surprised to see the god looking so forlorn. Even when he'd been crumpled on the floor of Stark tower, Loki hadn't looked so hurt and miserable. "You're, uh... you're fine," he assured, wondering if the fact that he felt sorry for Loki was normal. He was suddenly feeling guilty for wanting to scare the Asgardian.
Logan narrowed his eyes, though he stilled a little at the mention of other mutants. //Magneto? Couldn't be... It sure as hell wouldn't've been Xavier, unless Loki had pulled some weird god-tricks.// "If you think I'm givin' up anything just to get outta here, you can stick that staff o' yours where the sun don't shine. You don't have anything I want," he growled, though he couldn't help but wonder in the back of his mind what a god could offer him. He shook his head as he tried to shake away his doubt. "I ain't makin' any deals with you. I could'a thrown Stryker's fat, bureaucratic ass further than I trust you."
Bruce, looking more like a scared college professor than one of Earth's mightiest heroes, eyed Mystique nervously, one arm wrapped around his abdomen as if holding something in. Which he was. He could feel more sweat rolling down his face, and he swallowed hard. "Then I'm sure he told you that this is my good side," he said with a nervous, humorless smile. "And that you don't want to meet the other side. He mentioned that part, right? How he and I had a little talk? Well, him and the other guy."
Not sure of what he was doing or why he was doing it, Loki stalked down the hall to Creed's room and knocked firmly on the mutant's door. It was a small sign of respect, but one he knew he needed considering what he was about to ask.
Steve took a breath and agreed, "Agent Romanov, if you would stay with him?" He didn't like the idea of any Brotherhood members coming in behind them and freeing Creed. "Agent Barton, keep an eye on Loki, but no taking his head off for the moment, please." He glared at the god from behind the visor and cautioned, "Now would be a really stupid time to try anything cute."
"Yours," Natasha answered with a smile. "Then you boys can get some rest when we're done. You'll need it." Despite the words, Natasha still led the way. She knew where everyone’s room was. Strategically, it was just good sense to know where all of her teammates were. At the door, Natasha leaned against the wall and grabbed Scott by the shirt, tugging him into a demanding kiss while she waited for Logan to open the door.
“It’s perfect,” Steve answered with a smile. He’d been scared to make a similar overture himself, worried about pushing too fast or making Tony feel awkward. The last thing he wanted was to make Tony run for the hills when they were having such a nice time. True to Tony’s assurances, the movie was a lot of fun. He’d sat through a few movies with the rest of the team that were violent or sexual enough to make him more than slightly uncomfortable on a variety of different levels. Some things didn’t need to be shared in a group. Their feature for the evening, on the other hand, recalled something more classic in tone. “This is really good - the movie, I mean.” Steve had to admit that the warmth of Tony’s body against his side and the man’s arm around his shoulder were both high points in favor of the night as well.
"If there is anything that we of Asgard can do to help him have a warrior's rites, you have only to say the word." Sif knew it was a bit beyond her station to make the offer, but Thor nodded along eagerly.
Tony gave Steve's hand a reciprocating squeeze and grinned a little. "I'm mostly in one piece. At least eighty percent. I mean, all of my organs are here and on the inside where they belong," Tony pointed out obstinately. When Steve gave him another of his patented "looks," though, Tony sighed and rolled his eyes, sagging back against the gurney. "Fine. I guess since I won't be talking you into a handjob in the hospital, I'll go to sleep."
Logan sat up immediately as if he hadn't even been asleep, the faint glint of adamantium visible for a split second before he registered who was in the room with him. "Scott..." He rubbed a hand over his face and slouched a little, letting out a breath as he relaxed. "Scared the shit outta me. You alright?" He already knew the answer was no. Nobody who halfway knew him would want to risk waking him up without a good reason.
Clint took a few more bites of the funnel cake, then belched quietly. "Damn. That thing was huge. More like a deep-fried hubcap than a cake," he decided, though he still looked pretty pleased as he finished the last bite of potatoes. He grinned, still working his way through the beer, though he was obviously done with the food. "So, now what? More necking under a tree, or is this where I talk you into getting a little red, white and blue shield tattooed on your ass?"
It was Natasha who got herself together first and headed to Clint and Coulson’s last position. “They’re gone.” She hissed out a curse and braced a hand against the wall. After a few deep breaths, she grated out in an even, hollow tone, “Loki took Stark’s body. Coulson and Barton are unaccounted for. Logan is down. The Brotherhood is scattering.” Natasha gritted her teeth. “We lost.”
Steve forced himself to relax. Tony was always snarky, but there was a difference between worried Tony and confident Tony. He really did seem sure. "Just speak up if anything does happen to go wrong." He saw Bruce open his mouth again, but the man subsided. Steve suspected that was more for his benefit than Tony's, but he still appreciated the restraint. "We don't have any idea what things are going to look like when we find Loki." The god might want nothing more than to taunt them, to try and verbally prove his superiority. He might also be looking for a fight. "We need to be ready for anything and keep an eye out for each other." Quietly, he added, "Especially Hawkeye and Agent Coulson. I trust them both, but this isn't something anybody should have to go through more than once."
"I'm just going to keep not picturing it. Not picturing it is... that's my thing," Steve decided with a shudder. It wasn't just that they'd been raised together, that they were brothers, it was Loki, for heaven's sake. He decided to dedicate as much brain power as needed to seeing that he didn't think too much about the god naked. "From here on in, it's just you naked. That's it. I don't need any other nudity in my life." Steve couldn't help smirking at the look Tony gave him. "Unless we both agree on something else at some point, though I admit that I don't see myself being okay with sharing you anytime soon."
“It’s nothing. I’ve had significantly worse.” The words were the honest truth, and he certainly didn’t want to make Bucky feel worse than he already did. “He wasn’t in control, and I’m not taking it personally.”
"Please, come in," Coulson answered, stepping aside to let Logan enter. He had a feeling talking had very little to do with it, but there was no reason not to be polite.
Steve had stopped drawing while Tony fit the piece into its socket. He'd nearly stopped breathing. From the look on Tony's face, he wasn't the only one. He didn't let himself say again the he didn't have to do it or point out that the idea was crazy. He bit his tongue and prayed that it wouldn't matter what he said or thought, prayed that Tony would just be safe and that they'd laugh later over how terrified they'd been. "I'll wait here," Steve finally decided. "Pretty sure I'm not gonna be a lot of help explaining the specs."
Logan ignored him. "I like the 'no hidin'' part. Though I ain't lookin' for a spotlight on me, either. I don't like reporters."
"When I'm sweaty and disgusting?" Steve arched an eyebrow. "Y'know, I should probably be more surprised than I am." Just talking about sex with Tony was enough to make the idea of waiting - and possibly waiting quite awhile - painful on a lot of levels. "Not surprised. Kinda intrigued, though. Good to know I can go spend a few hours at the gym and not have to worry about showering before I throw you up against the wall. Convenient."
In the end Steve spent the better part of three hours sitting alone on a bench in the hallway hating every second of the wait and not knowing what to do. Tony was "being treated" for the drugs and otherwise examined according to Natasha. Visitors, she had said, wouldn't be a good idea. Steve understood that she meant him visiting wouldn't be a good idea. He'd clenched his fists but nodded. Finally Bruce emerged looking exhausted but invigorated. In moments like that Steve could see clearly the parallels between Bruce and Tony, the way they fed off of mysteries and problems and the solutions therein.
Clint nodded his agreement. He'd almost forgotten for a second that the world was circling the bowl in the midst of their banter. He'd even almost managed to put his teammates' troubles out of his mind. Selfish, perhaps, but Clint worried enough for four people most of the time. Still, the idea of checking on Nat actually served to brighten his mood a bit. "Yeah, let's do that," he decided, then remembered he wasn't exactly dressed for it. "Right after I put some real clothes on. Meet you at the cell block in ten."
It was several seconds before the feral mutant relaxed, his claws disappearing as he noticed that Stark wasn't half bad at this whole kissing thing, a low rumble echoing in his chest. Logan drew away, his normally bright blue eyes a few shades darker as he stared at the other man.
Nat let out a sigh. She heard a sound from the room and finally looked up. Her eyes locked with Darien's, and she smiled slowly. "He's very, very good, isn't he?" It wasn't worth asking about what Clint had done for Darien. She knew. She knew precisely how the man was with his other lovers, how he treated them and the walls he built around himself. Though she and Clint were lovers in a less than romantic sense of the word, Natasha felt pride in how deeply he let her in. Whatever else she thought about Clint, he was without question her own closest friend and confidante. She slid her fingers into Clint's hair. "Enjoy the show. We don't give out many tickets."
Tony felt himself go cold with fear when the doctor said Steve was on life support. Then came the news that the serum wasn't working, and Tony felt certain his heart stopped. He barely heard Coulson prompt the doctor for more information or the reply. If the serum was neutralized, it meant that Steve wasn't going to be healing as fast. If at all. Tony's stomach clenched, and he had to swallow hard to keep bile from coming up.
"Oh, good, he's... breathing? Excellent." Simmons tried to smile but received no warmth in kind from Romanov and cleared her throat. "We brought-"
Steve didn't even have time to choke out Jarvis' name before the visor slid back. Apparently his need for haste had been obvious without words. He didn't believe it even seeing the sight with his own eyes, couldn't understand. "Tony?" he finally choked, fingers rising and then falling away when he realized they were still covered in metal. Even through the burning need to clutch at Tony and kiss him senseless, Steve managed, "Where were we going on vacation?" It had to be something no one but Tony would know, something that no imposter could simply conjure up. Something not in the files. Steve did his best to remain stoic, not to cry as he fought the urge to tear away the armor and hold his lover and let himself believe before he had real proof.
Natasha made a sound of protest and kicked at the floor to get Logan's attention, her head shaking emphatically. No deal made with Loki could be trusted no matter how easy the price seemed. She had no idea what he could do to a mutant's mind, but she knew what Loki could do to a human, and the aftermath wasn't pretty.
Phil grunted at the pain of the bruising bite. He felt the man's teeth tear into flesh enough to draw blood and winced. He honestly hoped it didn't scar because he had no great desire to spend the rest of his life with reminders from both Loki and Creed. Assuming the rest of his life involved living long enough to get a scar from an injury. At the sound of Clint's groan, he tried to turn only to find himself too harshly pinned to manage it. "Clint, stay down." The man was hurt, and the last thing Phil wanted was for him to hurt himself more for no real gain. "I'm... I'm fine. Sit."
Clint could see the worry in Phil's face and he nuzzled his lover's throat. "Hey. We'll get better. Maybe later over sooner, but either way..." He looped his arms around Phil's neck and pressed a light kiss to the man's lips. "Look at it this way: if we do get benched, we can spend lots of time going on awesome dates." He reluctantly made himself slide off the couch and away from Phil, in spite of the fact that even that small separation hurt. He held out a hand and pulled Coulson up off the couch. "C'mon. Let's go cuddle and sleep for a few days." He tugged Phil into the bedroom, separating just long enough for them to strip down to their underwear. It was harder to ignore all the bumps and bruises and bandages with their clothes mostly off, but Clint didn't care. It felt too good to press himself against Phil with barely anything between them. In spite of sleep tugging insistently at him, the archer ran his fingers gently over the bandages, lightly brushing the digits over bruises as if to soothe the hurt away.
Logan wasn't sure he could have stopped if he'd tried. Leaning forward and settling his weight on hands planted to either side of Scott's torso, he began slowly thrusting, shivering as the pleasure thrummed through him. Leaning down, he brushed his lips against Scott's before nipping roughly at his throat. It was hard to keep perfect control, to keep from simply pounding Scott into the mattress. The man awakened every instinct, every desire within Logan.
It was Logan's turn to fight to stay calm enough to keep from cumming like a teenager. Hearing someone who'd always seemed so straight-laced utter those words was enough to make him lose his mind. Instead, he focused on Scott's earlier warning and slowed his strokes before withdrawing his hand completely. Instead, he tugged Scott down so he could lean up and suck at one of his lover's nipples. He paused to look up at Scott and run his hands over his back. "You know how good you look like this? Turned on and dyin' for me to fuck you?"
Sif shook her head. "Nay, it is worthy armor," she said with obvious approval. "I have come to aid you in your quest."
"I am your queen and your mother," the woman replied, bringing every inch of her gravitas to bear on the words. Many of the guards flinched openly, and Natasha made a note not to piss Frigga off. Thor's mother definitely knew how to make herself intimidating. It was impressive. Frigga raised a hand, focusing on Thor, tendrils of glittering yellow spiraling out from her hands. Only the tight set of Frigga's jaw showed precisely how much effort the spell took. "Your brother has taken enough from all of us. Come back to me."
"Mr. Stark?" Simmons honestly didn't want to bring the man's full energy and annoying oversight to their corner. She caught Fitz giving her a look that said clearly he thought she'd lost her mind. She'd read the lines of tension in Bruce's shoulders. After the man had been so kind to them, she couldn't bring herself to leave him at Tony's mercy when he was already in rare form. "Would you mind checking these equations? I think that this should speed the whole thing up a bit. Then coupling it all with this," she pulled up another screen on Fitz' computer that gave a good overview of the nanotechnology she was hoping to use.
Logan caught the back of Stark's shirt and hauled him to the floor, then proceeded to drag him to the foldout couch. Tony didn't protest much, crossing his arms over his chest. "Tell ya what. You manage to find you way over there on your own, and you can have all ya want."
There was a hiss of breath from the bed, then a pained whimper. The world hurt. The faint light through the open door hurt. Natasha shuddered and buried her face in the pillow. She wasn't sure how long she'd been lying there waiting for the pain to recede. She wasn't sure where she was. The voice... it sounded like Clint, but she couldn't trust that. Spots swam against her eyelids, and Natasha welcomed the coming darkness. Next time she woke up, maybe it wouldn't hurt anymore.
Loki raised a hand and threw a barrier up, letting Logan throw himself against it and watching the man with detached curiosity. "Careful. You might hurt yourself." His gaze swept imperiously over to the others assembled. "I could swear I killed you already."
Steve hadn't felt so pained and proud at the same time since the first glimpse he got of Bucky in uniform. The moment carried the same bittersweet notes, and Steve sighed, resigned. "Okay. Yeah, I... You sure you can't just be the rich, egotistical jerk everybody thinks you are? Because that would be good sometimes. I've got a bad heart, y'know." Steve didn't mean a word of it, and he knew Tony was well aware. Instead he kissed the man soundly, morning breath be damned. "Okay. I'm behind you. I'm also going to be praying like hell that we don't come within a million miles of needing you to back Logan up on this."
Phil had to swallow hard before he could even speak. "It's the only file I never finished reading," he confessed quietly, his fingers closing over Clint's and holding fast. He was under control enough to keep the grip from being bruising this time around. "I read enough to know... to understand a little, but... I couldn't handle it." He couldn't quite bring himself to meet Clint's gaze although his hold on the man's hand never faltered. "I probably should have requested that you be reassigned right then and there." Phil quirked a faint smile and glanced over at Clint. "Actually, you probably should have when I was out of commission for months. Apparently we both lack a certain amount of common sense."
The waiter scuttled off to deliver the news, and "Rick" was soon hustling out of the restaurant as he screamed into his phone while Tony casually ate his dinner and looked entirely too satisfied with himself.
Scott was pretty sure that if he hadn't been used to hearing Xavier in his head, that would have made him jump out of his skin. Instead he answered with a sigh, "Thanks, Jarvis. We'll be there in ten."
"He's not a prisoner," Coulson assured. "Things have just been a little complicated. Fury's hedging his bets. He didn't ask for a second opinion."
"We'll live," Phil promised as the other man pulled back. "And we'll do the dishes when we're done. It'll be a reminder that even the less fun parts of life go on." He managed to speak the words with a straight face but couldn't help smiling as he stole another kiss. "Go on. Let's get it done." He pulled on his suit jacket on the way out and let his own makeshift armor comfort him as they headed down the hallway.
Badly as Coulson wanted to protest, he didn't, just took the bottle and slipped it into an inner pocket on his suit coat. "Thank you. Is it okay if we head out? No offense to the lab, but it isn't what I'd call restful."
"I need to get the hammer to research, then I'll check in with medical." Coulson reached out to brush some glass from Clint's shoulder. You should too. Just to be sure."
Tony’s flippant demeanor disappeared, and his eyes narrowed as his expression darkened. "Practical? You could've disarmed him. Or just disappeared. You did it for fun. Because you could," Tony growled. "I saw the video. You enjoyed it. If you really think you're going to be part of the Avengers, you need to get it through your head that we're more than just insects for you to step on when it suits you. Especially considering that we 'insects' have managed to upend not just one but several of your plans."
Clint relished the stabbing pain of Darien's nails digging into his shoulders, the primal cries of the other man's climax. He hadn't given Darien permission to cum, but Clint couldn't bring himself to care. He gave a few last, shallow thrusts before unceremoniously drawing away. He sagged back against the nearby armchair, still panting softly. He watched Darien silently for several moments, taking in the other man's debauched state, and he smiled. "You were good," he rumbled, standing. He took off his archer's glove and arm guard, then stripped off his armored vest and pants. He'd get the blood off of them later. "I'm gonna shower. You?"
Clint made a sound of pleasant surprise when Phil's lips fell upon his once again. He'd honestly expected Phil to respond by telling him to get up so they could eat. Instead, the archer found himself parting his lips and whimpering softly as the other man's tongue slid perfectly into his mouth. His hand found one of Phil's, slid upward to rest on the man's forearm and tangle lightly in the man's shirt sleeve. Clint couldn't help the soft whimpers that escaped him as Phil plundered his mouth, and he felt goosebumps rising on his skin.
"Thank you, Mr. Summers. I think it's fair to say you can skip the rest of the preliminary courses. Xavier's had systems like a lot of ours. Just brush up on the specifics. If nothing else, it would be nice to have another pilot to sub in as needed."
Phil laughed at that idea. He wasn't sure he'd ever know everything about Clint, let alone learn it in a single afternoon. "I know one," he allowed. "I guess that means the next step is you figuring out all my secrets. You and Natasha probably already know than anybody else alive." Not even Fury knew him quite as well as they did. So many long missions away with the tight knit team meant that they'd learned things about each other that didn't get seen by the people in charge. It didn't mean, however, that they knew a lot of the deeper things. Phil tried to search his memory, wondering what Clint really knew about him even after so many years. "I'm guessing maybe not so much, though, really."
Clint stared, dumbfounded for a few moments before he cracked a grin that slowly turned into a solid belly laugh. He wasn't sure if it was relief or true amusement, but he had tears in his eyes and was clinging to the edge of the counter to hold himself up before he finally got a grip. Sniffling and wiping the tears from his eyes, he finished mopping up the coffee and tossed the paper towels before moving to refill his cup. "Gotta say, that... you had me going there," he said, pouring out the last of the pot into his cup. "Damn you and your poker face, Coulson. You had me convinced for a minute there that you had me in your spank bank." Not that it wouldn't have been flattering, just a bit awkward. Especially after having caught a few glimpses of the outline of Phil's package in his PJs. //Yeah, that'd make this whole handler-asset relationship a little awkward,// Clint reflected with a smirk as he started pulling together another pot of coffee.
Coulson couldn't believe he'd actually invited Clint to come to bed with him if he had anymore bad dreams. He wanted to go hide back in his room again, but Clint seemed willing to let it slide. "Thank you... and no. I'm fine. Mostly. The pills assured me a good night's sleep, interruption aside, and waking up to coffee always helps. I don't usually get to do that." By "usually" didn't get to, he meant that he never got to do it unless he programmed the pot. There was never anyone else there to do it. Small as the gesture was, it actually meant the world. "What about you? The dream? And you don't get to tell me that it was nothing. You woke me up in the middle of the night. Something's got you rattled, Clint. Talk to me."
The wry smile that accompanied the words left Phil smiling back despite the seriousness of the situation. "I'll keep that in mind. I might even stop you. Right now, we're hoping Stark and Banner can put their heads together and make the hammer do something for you and Logan and Summers."
Clint settled calmly back down next to Darien and rested a hand on the man's knee, giving it a possessive squeeze as he picked up his beer again, looking oddly content and pleased with himself.
"Beer 'n' hotwings, huh?" Logan knew that wasn't what Scott meant, but he couldn't help ribbing him for it. "Well, at least I won't haveta try hard to outdo myself," he said, giving Scott a casual wink as he finished off the last of said food. Wiping his fingers off, he reached across the table again until Scott took his hand. "It's pretty damn nice, if I say so myself. Maybe I'll find us somewhere next time that isn't full o' assholes that wanna give us the stinkeye for holdin' hands."
Even entering Fury's office wasn't that bad, although the man gave them a warning look when he caught sight of their joined hands. Coulson didn't even blink in response, and the man slumped back in his chair, apparently resigned. "We all know this one's gonna suck, which is why it's just us. We don't have to put the whole report out there for everybody, but the team needs to know the big parts. Coulson, you redact what you need to redact once I get the full picture."
Tony pushed himself up off the ground, trying to draw a deep breath. "Jarvis... are my organs all still where they're supposed to be?"
Hips pinned, Tony's elbows pressed hard into the mattress as he arched desperately, crying out in pure pleasure. After all the anticipation, the orgasm was so intense and lasted so long that Tony saw spots. As he finally collapsed in a quivering pile, he groaned softly. "Good thing... I have this," he panted, touching the arc reactor. "Think I might have had a... heart attack otherwise."
Clint was quiet for a long moment as he moved about the kitchen, getting out the aforementioned food and prepping a pot of coffee while he was at it. He felt he should have been trying to sleep in his own bed, stand on his own. But the idea hurt. Still fiddling with the coffee maker, Clint nodded slowly. "Okay," he finally agreed, the word quiet but firm. While part of him wanted to drag Phil back into the bedroom and make the man forget that anyone else had ever touched him and promise him that they'd never be apart, Clint knew it was way too soon on a few different time scales. Even without the abduction, though, it would have been too much. The frantic urgency to seal their relationship for good was hard to quell, though. Gently, Clint edged closer and tugged Phil close, brushing a gentle kiss to the man's lips before he rested his head against the other man's shoulder. "Thank you. Don't think I could sleep anywhere else."
"I am resting. See? Laying down," Tony pointed out, grabbing his coffee cup from the nightstand and taking a sip. "Jarvis has been keeping me briefed on everything." He shook his head. "You need to keep an eye on Barton. Guy acts like he's going off the deep end," he noted, switching his tablet over to a feed of the security camera on the hammer and flashing it at Steve. "That's interesting. I'm assuming I get to play with evil!Mjolnir, right?" Waiting for an answer, his eyes drifted over Steve's face. The man looked tired, grubby, had a cut on his lower lip and a few shreds and burn marks on his uniform... and was absolutely sexy. "I'd tell you that you look amazing right now, but I'm starting to feel like a broken record. Anything I can kiss and make better?"
Tony whirled, hands fiddling with a random gadget he'd snatched from a nearby workbench. "You think we could get it to run off an arc reactor?"
"J, I ain't here for the usual crap. You know I got money... Show me somethin' special or I'm takin' my business elsewhere."
"That's it," Logan rasped, his hands moving over Scott's sides, mauling the man's ass as his lover moved over him. "God, you feel good... So tight..." After a few moments, Logan reasserted his grip and stilled him once again. He nipped the man's neck, then murmured, "I think we need to change this up a little." He gently guided Scott off his lap, moaning as his cock slipped free. Standing, Logan pressed a hard kiss to the man's full lips, then wordlessly pushed him forward over the bed. Grabbing Scott's hips once more, Logan let his cock come to rest between the man's ass cheeks. "Beg me for it," he rumbled.
Loki stalked his way down the hall. He wasn't going to tell Stark. There was no point. The man likely wouldn't believe him anyway. It didn't matter. He just wanted to spend one night not feeling the weight of something he couldn't put a name to pressing in on the back of his mind. Stark was in the room waiting, as was the safest course of action for him. "Forgive the interruption. I needed to see that Creed wasn't being too hard on his toys. Restraint isn't exactly one of his sharpest skills."
Logan stilled at the reminder. He knew what he'd done to Scott himself. He didn't know what Barton had done, though he could guess that, in Scott's state at the time, it hadn't been gentle. Slowing his movements, he pressed his lips gently to Scott's neck. "Then maybe slow ain't such a bad idea after all," he murmured, gently sliding his hands down Scott's sides. His hands stopped at the man's hips and then moved back upwards, gently pushing Scott's shirt up a bit. Logan almost didn't want to see the bruises, to see what he and Clint had done to his lover.
"I wanted to check on you." She clicked on the light and Steve could see that Pepper's face was free of make-up, her own eyes red and swollen. She and Rhodey were probably the only other people on the planet who felt the grief as keenly as he did. "I still... it's..."
"Actually..." The AI countered, but obliged Tony's order all the same, leaving him in his black jumpsuit, which was torn and shone with drying blood.
"Well, it won't be the first time I've had to show them on the doll," Clint remarked, smiling grimly. He remained nestled against Phil a moment longer before reluctantly drawing away and locating pants and a shirt. "Y'know, if I'm gonna keep staying here, I'll eventually need to bring some clean clothes up that didn't come from medical." The thought of talking about what had happened without Phil sounded almost as painful as the idea of having the man with him. He really just wanted to curl back up with his handler and stay in the bed another day or two. "Want some eggs and bacon? I'm decent at cooking those."
"You're a real ray of sunshine in the morning, Logan, but I didn't come for the company." Steve set a printed version of Tony's files on the counter. Despite Tony offering the tablet, Steve suspected Logan fell more on his side of the lines and still appreciated a little tactile sensation with his information.  "I need you to look at these and let me know if anything rings a bell. It's all we've got right now, and there aren't many people around who actually remember it." It left the two of them in a very strange boat, but Steve had been busy with problems of his own while Logan played errand boy for SHIELD's earliest incarnation.
Clint bit his tongue, hoping the pain would distract him from the touches. Phil's voice filtered through a moment later, and he latched onto that mentally. When it was over, Phil would be there for him. That was all that mattered. The feel of Creed's tongue dragging across one of his nipples made him arch and tense and claw at the hand holding him down. The archer bared his teeth and made a strangled sound of protest. Reflexively, he started to beg Creed to stop, but bit the words back, knowing they'd just encourage the mutant. Bright blue eyes fixed on the ceiling as he felt his pants tugged away, and Clint did his best to breathe and think of anything but what was happening.
Because if you aren't closing on angst? The right way to close is on smut.  I'll be away on vacation for a few days, but I should be able to get the first chapter of Part 4 posted tomorrow :)
"I think you deserve extra effort, Mr. Stark." Loki's voice was scratchy as well, and the man who stepped into Tony's line of sight looked only slightly healthier than Tony himself. Loki looked drawn, and he felt as if he'd been raked over the coals. He'd shed much of his usual armor in favor of a light shirt and pants. The weight of anything more was oppressive, and given that Tony was suspended in his private chambers, there was little reason to worry about appearances. He certainly didn't need Stark's approval. "You'll be very lucky if the worst I do to you is tear apart your mind."
"No one is." Coulson moved to the next shelf in line and began scanning the contents. "Some of it's here because it's potentially too dangerous to even test out. The rest has been tested and deemed... inadvisable for use."
Tony sighed. "I guess that means no sexy time for me. I gotta remember to teach these nanobots to stitch me back together." He looked to Steve with his best puppy eyes. "Seriously, you're gonna sneak me outta here, right? This sucks." He felt certain that the nurses were making too much of a fuss. It hadn't been that long since he'd spent weeks in the hospital over the Chitauri invasion, in spite of the fact he'd been able to get shwarma with the team right after. //Of course, the crazies from it might've had something to do with that one…//
The mutant just chuckled, looking over at Clint and watching the man twist worthlessly against his bindings. "Mmm... he's flexible," Victor whispered conspiratorially in Phil's ear. "I see why you like him." Shifting, he let his cock press against Phil's ass, giving his prisoner just enough time to think about it before he pushed forward.
Clint's jaw tightened and he nodded, his gaze still cast out over the lake, forearms propped on his knees and hands clasped together. The ducks had moved on, lured by someone else with food to offer. He glanced back at Phil. "Wish you had been around then. After, at least. It... it was pretty rough," he admitted. He remembered sitting in the shawarma cafe after everyone but Nat had left. He'd had his meltdown then, curling up in a whimpering, pathetic ball against a pile of rubble just inside the door. He hadn't really cried, but he hadn't not cried, either. Just dry, strange sobs as Nat tried to get him to say something, tell her how she could help. He'd thought he'd lost one of his closest friends, knew he'd killed an untold number of agents. His mind snapping back to the moment he was in, Clint realized his hands were shaking a little bit, and he squeezed them together more tightly, hoping Coulson hadn't noticed.
"You're an angel. A goddess, maybe. Well, you would be if those things were real." Fitz snatched up a cup of coffee and one of the blueberry muffins before scurrying back to his station.
Tony actually jumped at the sudden sound. Feeling oddly nervous at the certainty of who would be with Loki, he took a deep breath and walked across the room. Slowly, hesitantly, he wrapped his hand around the knob and pulled the door open. There was Loki, surrounded by his friends, and... Tony felt his heart skip at the sight of the suit he'd made for his lover. "Steve!" He threw himself at the other man, relieved and frustrated all at once when his hands met with unforgiving armor.
"You speak the truth," the woman agreed, her own posture relaxing somewhat at the words. "I am Lady Sif of Asgard. I had hoped to find Phillip, Son of Coul amongst you. He is a friend of Thor's."
"Three's a crowd, Phil," the archer replied, standing to let Nat out of the booth. He nudged Phil and gave him a grin. "Just leave me some for later, huh?" he said with a smirk. For his part, Clint planned to get a lot less sober before he thought about getting out on the floor, and then he sure as hell wasn't going to dance alone. Or in an awkward three-way circle. Once Nat had gotten out of the booth, Clint got back into it and finished off his first beer, gladly grabbing the second round and holding his bottle up to Scott before he started on it. Yes, he definitely needed this.
Scott was glad to relax and glad that Logan hadn't put the brakes on. He leaned into the embrace and let himself enjoy the reprieve. There had been a desperation to what they'd done together before that hadn't let them really explore. Passion was great, but they couldn't treat every sexual encounter like they'd never see each other again. It wasn't healthy or sustainable in the long term, which was something Scott definitely wanted them to have. As his lips parted beneath Logan's, Scott's hand raised to the man's hair and trailed down the back of his neck.
Clint only had to threaten a junior agent a little to get the cuffs off. Mostly the threats involved asking the kid if he thought the handcuffs would really slow Clint down. After making sure everything in the cell block was as sorted out as it was going to get, Clint found Natasha's location through Jarvis and headed her way as quickly as he could. She was a few feet from Scott's door when he caught up with her. He had it in his head that he was going to ask her how she felt, tell her he missed her, or make some kind of half hearted joke about the whole ordeal. Instead, he all but tackled her and pulled her tight against him, hanging onto her like she'd disappear if he loosened his grip at all. His breathing roughened as he bit back tears, his whole body trembling.
When he finally opened his eyes again, the illumination behind the curtains told him that it was morning. Scott shifted, panicked for only a moment before he spotted Logan sitting not far away. His whole body sagged. "Hey. How long was I out?"
As the rest of them went back to their stations, Steve pulled out his sketchbook. He curled up in one of the chairs and started working. He wouldn't let himself admit even internally why he was so focused. He was trying to preserve every last bit of Tony that he could. Nothing cemented memories for him like putting them on paper. His gaze almost never left Tony except when it fell briefly to the page, smudging lines or trying to get a curve just right. He needed to preserve everything while he still had a chance.
