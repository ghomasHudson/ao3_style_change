"How do you know that?" Sam asked his brother, mouth hanging open.
“So you know that hunters don’t ‘talk’ about their ‘shit’. Hell, the only therapy I saw my dad do was called whiskey. Tequila if it was a bad night. We don’t do good feelings and fuzzy warm hugs.”
Dean nodded slowly, skeptical. Tony finally spoke up then, still looking a little green.
"Tony and I don't get to spend a whole lot of time together just the two of us, so sometimes when Tony is tinkering with his cars I come down and box. Just to be near him." Steve wrapped an arm around the shorter man, kissing the top of his head as Dean rolled his eyes at the display.
Dean blinked in confusion. "That was years ago, right?"
"No," Steve sniffed and wiped his face, smiling at the camera. "He's alive. I just saw him, I—" The man couldn't continue because he was sobbing too hard to let the words out.
"Relax, Steve, nothing is going on with Clint," the engineer assured the panicking man. "I was….struggling to keep up with everything while you were gone and Dean picked up the slack and decided to 'take on' responsibilities for his younger brothers. Not ideal, but it's nothing new for him."
"Fyrirgefðu, allt í lagi? Fyrirgefðu að ég er svo mikill skítabróðir og að ég meðhöndli þig svo miklu verr en þú átt skilið því þó að þú sért stundum sárþjáður, þá ertu mjög góð manneskja og lætur mig líða örugglega. Og, og takk fyrir að koma með mig hingað og leyfa mér að taka þátt í þessari heimskulegu fullkomnu fjölskyldu og reyna svo mikið að gera mig hamingjusöm og, og-" {
"I-no. I mean yes, but no." Dean shook his head slightly, still looking at the ground. "I understand what you're saying, but I don't understand how, or why. Why would you take us if you don't want anything from us?" He looked up, his eyes pleading with the older men for answers.
"You're right in that we don't really know you yet, but we don't need to know you to love you. We just need the opportunity, because, Loki, I'm not lying when I say I would die for you in a heartbeat."
Dean didn’t say anything, leaving the boy to his thoughts for a moment.
"Good. Everyone here is so nice it would suck to have to kill them. And this house! It must be so nice to be rich! Do you think they're gonna have to move us again? I hope not. Bruce is really smart! He started telling me that our entire body is made up of something called atoms that-"
“I told you they were in here!”
The girl was pulled from her musings by her stupid little brother, Clint. The three-year-old didn't understand why mommy left them alone.
“Steve, slow down! God dammit!” Tony could be heard from down the hall.
Steve snapped his head to stare at his husband with wide eyes. '
Sensing that the man was coming closer, Dean instinctively struggled to get away from his foster father as his eyes snapped open to better fend off the impending attack. There was a frenzy of blankets and pillows, and then he was falling. Heart seizing, Dean tried to grasp anything to stay upright, but moving his arm up caused a white-hot pain to shoot down his side. The agony only intensified as he felt himself hit the floor. Hard.
Steve stared at the letter with a smile of pure adoration as he traced the handwritten letters with his fingertips.
“Look at your arms, Dean!” the man raised his voice, gesturing to the clear handprint bruises visible on the teen.
The room was filled with stunned silence.
"Alright Dean," a man opened the door, looking intently at a file as he made his way to a cluttered desk Dean was currently resting his feet on. "My name is Sam Wilson and I'll be your caseworker!" The man looked up from the papers as he sat down, extending his hand towards the teenager.
"Is that what you want?" Tony asked, crawling his way up the bed to look up at the captain, still in his army suit. "You wanna throw me around? Hold me down? Have your way with me, 'Captain'?" he practically purred.
"Loki, I know exactly what these marks are. Before coming here I had them every damn day for over a year. I know what you're going through, and I know how to help you," the blond continued. "Is it Tony? Thor?"
Another big thank you for my beta morrismsteph!
I love you. I miss you.
"Right. Now that could mean that Clint was going to get in trouble later, but, from his dramatic ass eye roll you could probably tell he wasn't scared in any way, meaning he was in no way expecting to get hurt. Agreed?"
"We don't know. He didn't say a single thing on the matter, just completely shut down whenever anyone brings it up."
Sam shrugged. "Okay."
The girl quickly shook her head.
"Then why?" Sam demanded, walking up to look Dean in the eye.
“The truth. That you don’t want me to tell them, and that they don’t need to worry about you being hurt like this again,” he replied coolly. “It’ll drive Tony crazy, but they’ll accept it.”
Bucky smiled softly. "I knew you'd come for me," he said, before promptly passing out.
"Alright, that's okay," the man responded, just as fast. "Whoever made you feel like you weren't
"Then we'll make our own home."
"Sammy? You still awake?" he whispered into the darkness.
Sam knew something was wrong. Usually when Dean got hurt, he was a nightmare. He still joked around, of course, but he used the injury as an excuse to get Sam to do everything. Brushing off his injuries like this was troubling, to say the least.
Dean tried to think of another option, but only one came to mind. Leaving the bathroom, Dean grabbed his laptop from his desk and settled in to do some research.
"Thank you for letting me help you, sweetheart. My car is just down the street, where we just came from. Can you guys walk that far?" she asked, standing up.
Two other men clad in hoodies rushed in and gathered the sheet, struggling only slightly with the weight of it, then passed the three on their way out without even a glance.
“Really?” he asked, looking back at his behaviour over the past couple of months. “Huh. I guess you're right.”
"Okay, awesome. This is what we're gonna do, I'm going to state things you saw today and the logical explanation for them. You then tell me if it makes sense or if you have any questions and we'll go from there. Okay?" He waited for a nod. "Good. Now. When you came in, Thor was wearing a sleeveless shirt. Did you see any bruises?"
“Any news on Thor, Nat or Loki?”
"Nuh-uh, Tony," Steve smirked, gyrating his hips and pinching the other nipple, earning another whimper. "This is what you asked for, this is what you're getting."
“You think I don’t know when one of you leaves the city? I knew the second you were in the cab.” Dean supposed this was Phil’s way of explaining, though it revealed nothing.
Tony laughed as he took off his coat and hung it in the hall closet. "It sure does, bud! Hey, do us a favour and get your brothers and sister in Papa's office for us, okay?"
leave. Every time she tried to force out a sentence it felt like the world was suffocating her. So she didn't try anymore.
is the basis for every other good relationship in his life, so if he doesn't know why you react to certain things, or why you do things a certain way, how do you expect him to have healthy relationships in the future?"
"I can tell you right now we're not taking that deal-" Steve started.
"If I hate him, I promise to tell you."
“I should not have reacted the way I did when I picked you up from school. If I made you feel like I didn’t love and appreciate you in every way, then I was wrong.”
Dean squeezed his eyes shut as he felt a few tears slip free. He nodded slowly, before remembering that Bobby couldn't see him. Dean cleared his throat, then whispered, "Yeah, Uncle Bobby. I got it."
“We don’t hate you, Dean!” Clint pressed. “I was scared you were gonna leave again! Please don’t leave again!”
“Um,” the teen looked down to work at an oil stain in his jeans. “You remember our Uncle Bobby from the funeral? He owns an auto salvage yard and taught me how to fix up old cars and stuff.”
"We have much work to do if the team is to reach regionals, however I am confident we shall do our best!" The man puffed out his chest with pride. "Although," he paused. "Something odd happened today that I feel I need to seek council for."
Not only did Dean stop fidgeting, he smiled more, snarked less and was overall just a more pleasant fourteen year old.
Sam studied the man intently, then dropped his head, lost in thought once more. “Yeah...I think so. But what if he’s mad at me?” The boy looked younger than his ten years as he stared up at his oldest foster brother for guidance, big brown eyes completely trusting.
” Dean emphasized each word, glaring at the man, and yanked his hand back in betrayal.
“Well then, thank you again, Dean,” Tony began rubbing the boy’s shoulder lightly. “You really saved my butt last night.”
As he did every morning, he shook his head.
"Um–yes hello, Mr. Singer," Steve stumbled.
“Dude, you were supposed to meet me downstairs like ten minutes ago!” Dean whispered back. “What gives?”
Tony simply smiled and gave the man another soft kiss, before sliding down the bed to position himself between Steve's legs.
Thank you so much for joining me in this adventure! I've loved each and every comment and follow it's gotten and I can not thank you all enough! This isn't the last time you'll see the brothers in this universe, there's already a one-shot written and a sequel in the works, so stay tuned for future stories!!
“Dean! I thought you were sick?” Bruce questioned when the teen entered. The 18-year-old was passing pancakes to Clint, who was already covered in syrup.
Apologies for the long wait but hopefully now that I'm back to reality (ugh) updates will continue to be consistent!
"You go, I'll stay here and keep Dean company. That alright sport?" Tony asked the boy. Dean nodded and smiled at the man.
The teen's voice definitely did not break as he whispered: "Ef þú segir einhverjum frá þessu mun ég setja kláða duft í öll jockstraps þín." {
Pausing, Dean steeled himself.
This chapter is not edited.
"No, Tony," Steve sat up, pulling away from the man's touch. "We're calling him now."
"Did you give him the codeine?"Tony asked, finally getting to ask the question he'd been waiting for.
Nodding, Jody went along with it whether it was in sarcasm or not. “Alright, let’s start with the hunt you went on. That was the werewolves in Jersey right?”
“I’m fine, Steve.” Dean ducked, trying to avoid the hand headed for his forehead. Steve got him anyway, briefly touching Dean’s heated skin with the back of his hand.
"No, you're not!"
"Stranger things have happened," Loki responded nonchalantly, turning a page in his book.
Instead, he found a very sleepy teenage boy, who swatted off the man’s attempts to throw his blanket off.
Was flowing in between her legs as she forced herself up. It was getting light out, which meant there wouldn't be any more men tonight. Hopefully.
Only one chapter left until this part is done!!!
“My father found the ring after my mother’s death, along with the note that went with it,” Loki continued. “He changed the emeralds out for rubies. My favourite colour has always been green, he couldn’t stand the reminder that it was supposed to be mine.”
The professor gave a fond–though tired–smile at Dean’s unknowing display of trust and took comfort in the knowledge that he could soothe his son’s suffering in such a way.
Steve could've cried right then. He pulled his youngest in for a tight hug and kissed the boy's hair. "I think that's a wonderful idea, sweetheart. I know he would absolutely love it if you did that for him."
The family laughed, well used to the man’s antics.
Steve was stunned into silence. The two of them sat there while Steve struggled to speak. The man pulled out his phone, typed something, then set the phone on the table between them. He then covered his mouth with his hand, and the two sat in silence once more.
"Hey," the blond interrupted. "You can still do everything you wanted to do before."
A shrug. "I don't hear any sirens," Sam started. "You didn't murder Loki after all?"
This particular morning, however, held slight changes. Tony, already alert and holding a cup of coffee, was standing in the doorway of the kitchen when Dean came down. Meanwhile, Thor stood in Dean’s usual spot–eating half the pancakes before they even reached the table, it would seem.
A huge thank you to my new beta morrismsteph!!
"Yeah! Then I warned him he'd get bathroom duty for a month and he asked if I could spank him instead! What the hell right?!" Steve ran his hands through his hair so many times it looked like a disaster. The man was pacing in Tony's workshop, trying to calm down.
"Bobby, I–"
“Look at all the stuff dad kept!” Sam exclaimed, head deep in a box. “Look! My cement handprints from kindergarten!”
"It's okay to have boundaries, Dean. If he brings something up that you genuinely don't want to talk about, just tell him that subject is off the table for the time being," she suggested.
"Hey!" the man screamed, startling the kids, "Get this outta here."
"That's not what I meant, and you-"
Anyways, enjoy some Christmas angst/fluff in September!
Sam, somewhat more satisfied with the situation, rested his head once again on Steve’s chest. He smiled when he felt the man return his arms to wrap around his son and start swaying slightly, comforting the boy.
“But they didn’t! Why aren’t you listening to me!”
"Nothing you imbecile, now give me back my computer!" the other teen snapped, trying to pull his arm back, but he was no match for Dean's grip.
"I don't drink anymore." Tony assured Sam. "I got sober a year after I met Steve."
He didn't have to lie about injuries anymore.
"Are you sleeping well since you moved?" Dr Miranda asked him one day.
“Which, coincidently was a year and a day after his first proposal.” Steve smiled lovingly at his husband while Tony in return took hold of one Steve’s hands and kissed his knuckles softly.
He didn't have to lie about where he got that night's dinner, or how they afforded another night at the motel when they were out of cash.
"Well, if it's the least I could do," Steve said, closing in to nibble on his husband's ear. "Then your wish is my command," he whispered, feeling Tony shiver.
"Woah! Carefully there, bud! Hot element here!" he chastised the blond. He couldn't be too upset though, when Clint looked up at him with sparkling blue eyes.
"A bookworm, eh? Have you read The Hobbit yet?"
I can't wait to read your thoughts!!!
"No buts, mister. You stink!" Natasha joked, rising out the dirty cloth in the sink.
"Yeah, I see her too, Dean. I guess you forgot." the boy shrugged.
"You know I'd listen a lot better if you would unbutton your blouse there sweetheart. Or should I say sweet melons?"
"There. We've met. Can I go back to my game now?"
"Again, if that's the only thing you have of his, almost certainly!"
"But putting our children in that situation?"
Voices came from behind them. The two sprung to cover themselves with strewn clothing.
“How did you–” Sam paused, thinking a moment. “How did you stop thinking about it? How did you…stop being sad?”
Dean stuffed a piece of waffle in his mouth to avoid answering right away. The men waited patiently. “Um. I guess what we’re doing is working? I–I’ll let you know when it’s not?” Dean answered hesitantly, judging the men’s reaction to his thoughts.
"No one's seen my dad?"
} Thor continued into the hug. "Kanskje vondt i rumpa, men aldri en drittbror." {
Dean stilled as he heard the stairs creak behind him. He watched as the men sat on the couch beside the armchair he chose to perch in. Tony glanced at Deans hands, the boys nails digging into the fabric of his sleep pants and into his leg.
After observing Dean pull on his hair for the third time, the man nudged the teen's knee and gestured inconspicuously for the two to leave the room. He was met with a confused sneer and eye roll before Dean returned his gaze to the screen.
The door swung open violently, the hinges screaming.
"Yeah, sure!" Sam replied, opening another one of the boxes. "Dean!" he gasped, pulling out an object. "My soccer trophy!"
At least, that’s what he tried to do. In reality, he groaned and lifted his hand about an inch or two off the bed, before feeling his side burn and dropping his hand back down.
"Bring someone back to life? Dean, is this about your dad?"
Dean shrugged. "Your house."
"Holy shit. Steve, we need to get Dr. Mills a fucking fruit basket," Tony commented, noting how open the teen had been in knowing how he was feeling and conveying that effectively to his foster parents. Whether or not Dean knew it, the therapy sessions were working wonderfully for the boy.
Dean sighed in relief, the tension left his shoulders instantly. "Thank god," he whispered under his breath. "So, you really suspected this whole time?"
"Well, he's not in any danger of dying, but truthfully, I don't know," the captain revealed, and put down his cutlery to give the table his full attention. "I'm not going to tell you guys exactly what happened, that's his to tell, but know that the people who had Uncle Bucky were not very nice to him. I expect all of you to be on your best behaviour every single time you see him, understood?"
"Well, yeah!" Dean shouted. "It's my fault! If I were a better hunter, dad would've brought me with him and he would've had back up! If I wasn't so useless he wouldn't have left for so long in the first place! He wouldn't have felt the need to get away from us all the time! He– It's all my fault!"
Sorry for the brief hiatus, last week was jam-packed!! Warning for a short chapter ahead, it's more of a build-up to the final chapter than anything.
"But I don't want to!" Tony whined again. "I wanna have sweaty, athletic sex with my hunk of a husband and not invite a potential lunatic into our lives!"
"What do you mean?" Steve asked.
Steve bit his lip as he thought. "Tony," he started. "We can't just turn them away."
She lifted her foot and watched as blood dripped back onto the floor in a detached fascination.
It also prompted a lecture from Steve and Tony.
Natasha loved the dress her mother picked for her today. It was red with white flowers and it twirled beautifully. She only wished she could be like the girls in the pictures with a red bow to match. It would be perfect with her dress and red hair! Red was Natasha's favourite colour, she was so lucky her mom got her so many red things, she would be the Red Girl!
what you think—"
"Ste—" Tony began to complain before the other man chose that moment to push in, getting almost the entire digit in before feeling resistance.
"One and the same. And let me tell you, with as many fights as this punk got into, I should get a damn medal."
“Exactly. With our own eyes. That's hard proof, okay?” Dean shouted back, then stepped closer to his little brother. “Okay, all right. You know what? I get it. You've got faith. That's– hey, good for you. I'm sure it makes things easier. I'll tell you who else had faith like that: Mom. She used to tell me when she tucked me in that angels were watching over us. In fact, that was the last thing she ever said to me.”
"This isn't like the other times, right, Dean?" the boy asked.
Dean paused.
“So everything is just…okay now?” Dean asked hesitantly.
Steve's eyes were far away as he recalled the memory.
Steve smiled and rubbed the teen’s knee before returning to his seat. “You need another breathing session, just let me know, sweetheart.”
"Oh shoot, I have to go pick up the kids from school!" Steve looked at his phone and shut off the reminder.
"John Winchester knew what he was going into when he decided to join the hunting community and he was well aware of the risks he took. He was coming back from a hunt when he heard the possibility of a supernatural being in Jersey City. He was woefully unprepared and didn't tell anyone where he was going. You couldn't have helped him kill those werewolves, Dean. You were miles away and looking after Sam with no means of transportation." The man stopped when he saw Dean drop his gaze to his lap. Placing a finger under the teen's chin, Mr. Coulson lifted Dean's head until he was once more looking at the man.
Clint had done his job and he, as well as Thor, Bruce and Natasha were milling in their father's office when they arrived.
Natasha eyed Dean warily. "No," she replied, "but I'll talk to Becky before school tomorrow. And I have an appointment with Dr. Hill tomorrow night, so I'll see what she thinks."
"Why? Wanna see what you're competing with? Don't worry baby cakes, you're plenty hot enough to go down on me." Was the reply. She recommended seeing a different therapist.
"Fair enough," Steve calmly replied, not rising to the boy's bait. "Anyone else you'd like to invite?"
“Ugh, please, please!”
The teen stepped back quietly, and exited the room.
Dean laughed. "Yeah. Guess that wraps it up."
The teen nodded, eyebrows pinched together, heavy with thought. "I– I have to think about it," he finally responded.
"No offence, but I don't really want to take that chance," Dean laughed right back. "Breakfast. Downstairs."
"Yes. Next question," Bobby evaded.
“And? We’re gonna be bored for an hour while some old guy tells us we’re going to hell,” Dean scoffed halfheartedly.
“You have to stop lying to me Dean,” Jody tisked at the boy.
“Is he okay?” Steve asked as he resumed his position beside Dean’s bed.
Have to earn the E rating some way ;)
"It's Percy Jackson." Dean interrupted, staring at his lasagna. "His favourite is the one about the labyrinth."
Deans face shut down. Any expression it once held fled. After a moment, he smiled, the lines a bit too sharp to be natural as he responded "If you think a little blood is bad, boy you don't wanna know how the rest of my life has gone. If you weren't bleeding by dinner you weren't working hard enough." Dean stopped. His eyes widened. "Wait, no. That came out wrong. Our dad wasn't abusive, I swear! It's just, he was in the marines and we did drills and runs and shit! You know how it is, right? Steve?" Dean looked to the soldier for help.
"Dean we know you're in there. Come on, open the door." Tony? Why was he here?
"Bróðir-" {
“Not important?” the genius interrupted, then sighed running a hand down his face, smearing grease across his forehead in the process. “Steve, you need to take care of yourself before you try taking care of everyone else. This has been a traumatic and stressful time for you, and-”
"Dean wants you there," Tony explained. "But there's no way in hell you're stepping foot on the property if you're a danger to the kids."
"I–I don't have any friends," Dean shook his head.
"Hey. Hey Clint. I want you to look at me. Can you do that?" Dean was speaking low and grazed his fingertips at Clint's wrists. "Clint please I want to say something to you and I need you to look at me when I say it."
“Sounds like a plan. Do they know?” Steve asked.
They left that foster home the next week after she bit the man a second time.
Once he saw Steve drive off to NYU with Bruce and Thor, Dean pulled out his phone and called a cab. Thank god for the allowance money Steve and Tony gave him every week. With the amount he'd saved up, Dean had more than enough to get to New Jersey and back.
Dean quickly blocked him, forcing the door open and grabbing the other boy’s arm. “Hey,” he warned, “don’t do this. Don’t shut me out again.”
"I don’t think we could fit more festivity in this room if we tried!” Tony announced as he carried a tray of hot chocolate from the kitchen.
"Yeah," Sam pulled one of his papers forward, "which one is Ireland and which one is Scotland?"
The man finished and, after cleaning himself up, slammed the door as he left.
Another deep breath.
The teen snapped his eyes up to the girl and held his hands up in a ‘what do you want’ gesture.
"And Dean. Are you interested in anything? Any sports or hobbies?" Steve pushed.
That got Loki's attention. He made sure to keep his head down as he tied his laces a little slower.
“Fair enough. He gave me the number for an old friend,” Dean answered, thinking was highly unlikely that the man wouldn’t find out eventually.
Dean studied the man for a moment. “You’re not actually CPS, are you?”
A single tear traced itself down Dean's face, revealing how much the teen needed to hear the affirmation. Quickly wiping it off, he smiled at Sam. "I know. Now go back to bed, bitch. I don't want to hear you complain about you not getting enough beauty sleep tomorrow morning."
“Well he’s different! He’s just a kid! I’m not!” Dean argued.
“So no. There is no
"Dean?"
Another deep sigh, paired with the sound of a bottle meeting glass once more. "Okay, Dean. You–you live the best life you can." The phone disconnected, and Dean dropped it to the bed, not caring to stop the flow of tears anymore.
The teen thought about it. "That could work," he muttered. "But I still don't want him in my head."
"First," Steve leaned his elbows on the desk, "explain abuse."
Once upon a time he would’ve said the words in anger, but he was tired. Tired of the world kicking him down and expecting him to get back up again.
Loki sat, just staring at the ring for another minute or two, then took a big breath and nodded, but made no move to put the ring on the logs.
"It's gone, isn't it?" Bucky interrupted. The other man floundered for an answer. "I knew that it was a possibility, Steve." He comforted his friend with another hand squeeze. "Hell, before you got me, I thought it was gonna kill me. I know what blood poisoning looks like."
, he thought. No fear, no pain, and no expectations to hide who he was.
Falsworth waved the man off. "Go. Your crazy ass has, what, like a dozen kids to get back to?"
Tony waited for his husband to continue, but all he heard was silence.
“Why do you think that?” Tony asked the teen.
"In case I was curled up on the floor or attacking innocent nurses, you mean," Bucky smiled softly and held out his hand for Steve to grab.
“Let me out of here! I need to see my brother!”
"Right," Steve huffed. "And ugh, you had a pretty bad infection in your arm, Buck."
“What’s so special about this ring anyway?” he asked softly. “I thought you hated Odin, so why does this ring mean so much to you?”
The rare moment of gratitude was met with a smile and nod, along with a look of uncertainty upon the man's face as he studied the teen.
"Natasha, please," Steve hushed the girl. "What else?"
The girl froze as she noticed a white sheen to her brother's skin.
The three sat there. Tension hanging thick in the air. Dean with his legs still spread, and Tony gripping Steve's hand so hard both of their knuckles were turning white.
Getting on his hands and knees, Steve began to crawl up his husband's body. "You know you love it," he whispered, kissing Tony once more. Coming back up, Steve reached for the forgotten lube. "You ready?" he asked as he warmed the lube in his hands.
"Alright Dean, take a deep breath for me." Steve had his hands on either side of Dean's ribcage, assessing his breathing. "Any pain?" Dean shook his head. "Okay, well I don't think anything's broken, you'll have to thank Thor for reacting so quickly or that might not have been the case."
“How did you get hurt, anyway?” Tony inquired.
The boy, seeming much older than his years, stood from his bed and in front of his protector. "Dad would be proud of you, Dean. Steve and Tony are proud of you. Hell, you're my fricken hero, Dean. I know you hate chick-flick moments, but you're my big brother. And I love you."
Looking at the boxes of mementos, Dean realized that his father cared much more than he thought he did, keeping such insignificant treasures from the boys’ childhood showing how sentimental the hardened man truly was.
"Hey, come on big guy," he pulled away slightly and began undoing Steve's tie. "I can't make love to you all covered up, I wanna see the most gorgeous man alive."
The man did not look as happy to see Dean as Dean was to see him. The engineer was wearing a tank top, jeans, and sneakers and had goggles pushed up into his hair. His arms and face were covered in a black substance. Clearly, he had been experimenting in the workshop before he came.
"Uh," the teen sputtered. "Yeah, I mean, I can't remember ever having one before, so I guess?"
"'Tasha said the mean man was dead, so we need to find a new one!"
Steve watched as Sam shuffled out of the room, the boy looking back at his brother once more before closing the door on his way out.
"We really wish we could help you unload all of this, but something came up while we were out and we need to take care of it," Steve lied. Tony barely restrained himself from laughing at the Captain and his awful poker face, it was a good thing the boys weren't paying attention as they called out their "okays" and went to retrieve more boxes.
The man was stunned for a moment, just looking at the back of the boy’s head in awe, before shaking his head and noticing the lump under the covers of Dean’s bed. “Dean? You okay?”
Tony shook with the power of Steve's laugh.
"I am your math teacher, Dean, that's right. Now, why don't we go for a walk?" She offered him her arm, and Dean gave her a huge smile and wrapped his arm around it.
Dean jumped up, fighting with himself on whether to open the door or not.
"Papa?" Thor called out when Steve shut Bruce's door. The man was standing in the middle of the hallway, shuffling from side to side.
Sam stared at his brother, silent.
"You good? Need a minute?" Tony whispered as he brushed past the teen.
"Don't ask questions you don't want to know the answers to," was the quick response. "I wouldn't worry about that though. They've got good heads on their shoulders and wouldn't do anything stupid."
“Look, it’s just–” the teen looked back down at his hands. “I called him a while ago and he basically cut all ties with us.”
“It’s for your health, Dean–”
"What do you think it means?!"
“If–if you thought someone might be hurt, but they also might not be hurt, and they told you not to worry, what would you do?” the boy asked, unaware that both siblings knew exactly who he was talking about.
Sam edged towards the door, but glanced back in concern. Seeing Dean’s stern gaze, he sighed and exited the room.
“Someone thinks they’re getting some.” Dean teased, his finger now rubbing right over Becky’s hole.
This chapter has not been edited.
Dean rolled his eyes. "Of course you would have that rule. Alright. What else?"
"Don't you dare hang up, Clint," Steve's voice filled the kitchen.
The numbers 12:08 blared up at him in the dark.
Steve threw his head back and laughed, then leaned over to whisper in his husband's ear. "If you manage to get some sleep before I come back, I might just wake you up in your favourite way."
"Goodbye, my love," Tony blew a kiss of his own.
“He and dad fought about that thing in Missouri a couple years back, remember?” Dean shook his head. “They haven’t spoken since.”
Despite Tony's jest, (and multiple offers of road head,) the couple made their way directly home from the landing strip.
“Hey Dean,” Tony whispered. “Is there anything we need to know about everyone here right now?” There was an edge to his voice that Dean couldn’t figure out.
"This." Tony made a vague gesture to Dean. "All of this...stupidity. You're a smart kid Dean, why are you being a dumbass?"
This chapter is unedited (because who has the time anymore, anyway LOL)
Steve sighed and pulled the phone away, pushing the button to change the call to a video chat. Once the call was accepted, and Clint's face appeared, Steve quickly scanned the boy's face. "Can you give me an honest answer about why throwing something at Loki was an appropriate reaction, honey? Did he hurt you or did you feel threatened at all?"
The Impala.
Steve threw his head back and laughed.
"How dare you!" Loki shouted, reaching across the table to get to the computer.
The teen nodded in relief, comforted by the knowledge that his foster father was still sober, which relaxed him just enough to fall into a fitful sleep.
"Nat-" Dean started, but Natasha raised a hand to stop him.
"I didn't," Sam interrupted. "But you just confirmed it. I figured it out a while ago, but never had any proof. I'm pretty smart, Dean."
Clint shrugged and shoved as much of the food into his mouth as possible before answering. "All bulls eyes all the time." Or, at least that's what everyone assumed he said around the food.
"Dude, why are you-" the blond sighed and ran his hand through his hair. "You know what? Yeah. Yeah, I would, because even though you can still be a jerk sometimes, you're my brother. End of story."
"Happy birthday, Dean!" Sam smiled and batted the pillow away easily.
"You aren't going anywhere any time soon, Dean. Not if I have anything to do with it. I will make sure that you feel nothing less than who you are, and that is an incredible and wonderful teenager," Mr. Coulson whispered, only making Dean sob even harder against the embrace of the older man.
Loki raised a sharp eyebrow at his adopted brother. "I have no idea what you're talking about."
"Well, what happened right around two weeks ago?"
The two sat in the quiet for a moment.
Unfortunately, the one second he turned to look for his brother was the one second Nat needed and she caught him with a blow to his chest, bringing him to the ground. Nat jumped on top of him and was about to cause him further pain before her weight was lifted from him rather suddenly.
Dean furled his eyebrows in confusion, looking between the two men to try and understand what they were talking about. Steve and Tony waited patiently while the boy worked it out, smiling even wider when Dean's eyes widened comically.
Only, every window sill had salt in its casing. Every door had a mat in front of it that had a protection warding burnt into the bottom. The whole house was already protected.
"We could do a couple at a time or-"
"No, Sam," the teen stood up abruptly. "I don't care if you get into that stupid Freudian 'everyone wants to fuck their mom' crap, but keep it away from me."
The reprieve only lasted so long though, and Loki was once again causing everyone's frustrations to rise once more.
Returning his gaze to the ceiling, Sam blushed and remained silent.
Dean opened his eyes then, looking at the man offering to help, the man that had such expressive eyes that conveyed nothing but compassion. Dean sighed. And, pushing the voice of his dad aside, accepted.
"Thanks." Dean panted out. "A little out of practice though." He admitted and gulped down the water.
The rest of the visit went smoothly and Sam and Clint even gave delicate hugs to their new uncle before they left, and Steve could tell that, although his best friend was exhausted, this was the happiest the POW had been since waking up.
"Underwear, Tony."
Tony was frozen. His arms were extended, as if to try and help Dean stay on the bed. The man’s mouth was open in shock, his eyes wide, his breath ragged and hard as he stared at the young boy who, delusional with fever and coming down off a high, mustered up the strength to avoid his touch.
Dean inspected the man, trying to figure out what was going on.
"Sore." The teen smiled and leaned his elbows on his knees. Steve inspected Dean's hands again to find them calmly holding the bottle. Normally he would've been picking at the label as soon as Steve tossed it to him.
Dean shook his head adamantly and resumed his breakfast. “No, he knows I get into a lot of fights. He’s seen me scratched and bruised before.”
Steve and Tony shared a wary smile, before telling 'Uncle Bobby' the date and time.
Thank you for being so patient while I've been galavanting around the world, lol.
The boy dragged his brother through the sea of boxes as the teen looked at the conflicting holiday decorations in confusion.
“Dude, that’s creepy.”
"Minors. You believe he could pose a threat to us, Thor or Bruce?" Steve's eyes shot up his forehead.
There was a resounding affirmation from said kids.
Tony lifted his hand, interrupting the panicking boy. “I think it’s time to tell you something.”
"Why? Your ball and chain outside?" Bucky asked, not so subtly trying to see through the small crack in the door.
"Tha's my line, ya punk," Bucky slurred, surprising Steve.
"Clint eat your food, stop bothering Nat." Steve called out, though he was smiling as he said it.
The other teen shook his head and finally put down his book. "It was just talk. I think they're too scared of her to actually do anything."
"But 'Tasha—"
An alarm suddenly broke the quiet and all three jumped at the sound.
The boy was lost in thought as he descended the stairs and returned the bowl to the kitchen, where he saw Thor and Clint washing the dishes.
"And that relates to him getting therapy, how?" the teen spat.
The officers didn’t stay long.
Her head was being pushed further into the mattress, blurring her vision with her bright red hair.
“Yeah. Yeah, I’ll just–uh–I’ll just go and get them.” The social worker stood up, turned back, as if to say more, but shook his head and exited the room.
"Thor was ready to fight everything, Bruce was scared of his own shadow, Clint was terrified of doing anything around us in case it was wrong and Nat would sleep against their door to make sure it couldn't open. Not to mention she never said a single word to us for the first six months." The soldier rested his chin on Tony's head as he spoke. "And technically we still haven't met Loki, but his and Thor's father really did a number on him."
This is it. The last chapter.
Clint whined on the other end. "But Papa! He was being so mean to me!"
"I thought all the shrinks said you were normal," Dean pointed out. "That you had no idea what was going on."
"But—"
"That he is," Bucky agreed.
Mr. Coulson managed to surprise the family by delivering the pizzas himself and asking to join them. When he asked Sam and Dean how the day went, Sam hid his face into Steve's shoulder and shrugged. Dean managed to look the man in the eye and thank him for all he did for their dad, arranging the proper funeral and gathering the man's acquaintances for the send-off.
"Now that," Steve panted, "was mind-blowing sex."
"Can you nod to let me know you understand?" Dean slowly nodded his head. "Okay, then." Tony quickly left the room and shut the door, already dialing.
"My apologies if I frightened you young friend," the younger of the two huge blond men bowed his head to Dean. The teen relaxed his stance, but was still ready to fight at a moments notice.
Steve pulled away from the kiss and rested his forehead against Tony's chest, breathing hard while his husband ran his hands up and down his back and arms.
Abandoning her ass for the moment, Dean worked on lifting the girls incredibly tight shirt. The moment her flesh was in view Dean started kissing and biting her stomach, even going far enough to tongue the inside of her belly button as he gazed at her through his eyelashes.
The man sighed. "Do you remember how we said that Bruce sometimes gets meltdowns?"
Dean nodded and passed over the matchbook. He stepped back to give Loki the space he needed and watched as the other boy held the match to the wood, waiting until it caught flame to throw the entire match into the quickly lighting fire.
from useless," Mr. Coulson repeated.
"Relax, darling," Steve called out, elbowing his husband playfully and making sure the sheet covered the both of them. "You can uncover your eyes, you're not going to see anything you shouldn't."
“Ah, yeah the rich foster dads,” Bobby grunted, taking Steve’s hand. “Bobby Singer.”
"She was- excuse me? That's your defense? 'She was hot?'"
"You don't want to be in our family?"
As always, please let me know if you find any spelling or grammatical errors so I can correct them.
“Papa?” Sam’s voice was quiet.
Dean thought for a second, making sure to breathe evenly. "Yeah. Yeah, it's just a lot, ya know?"
“It hurts to see you like this, Steve, I’m not gonna lie,” Tony responded, starting to wipe his open face with the back of a dirty sleeve. “You know what this reminds me of?”
“Hey, just be happy Papa convinced Dad to wait until winter break to start decorating,” Bruce warned the teen, smiling. “As much as Dad says he hates Christmas, it’s his favourite time of the year.”
"I acted out in front of them. Did stupid stuff," Sam shrugged, obviously oblivious to the implications he gave his brother. "I thought if they wanted to hit me, I'd have my proof and we'd get out of there."
Fucking hell.
“I–I’m so sorry, sir! S–sorry about the mess! So sorry! I’ll clean it up! I will, sir–I promise! You shouldn’t have to clean up after me! It was my fault!” Dean was desperately trying to sit up further, intent on appeasing the man, cheeks burning red with embarrassment on a face gone white with terror.
The Stark family were gathered in the kitchen for their regular morning chaos, (read: breakfast) when Sam raised his hand hesitantly in an awkward attempt to get their attention.
Dean rolled his eyes at his brother. “Always have to know the plan, don’t you?”
"I fucking–I fucking knew this would happen! I told Steve that seven is too many! That we needed to think about the other kids, how you would affect them, but no! No, he just had to get attached to the stupid fucking pictures," Tony was muttering to himself now, completely unaware that he was speaking aloud for Dean to overhear.
Loki nodded again and pulled his arm away. "What book are you writing about?" he muttered.
"Yeah, not like you were keeping any kind of tabs on them, but those boys have been through things no child would even dream of," he raised a hand to cut off whatever placating words Steve was going to use to reassure the man.
"Yeah I'll take a look at what they have. I wouldn't mind reading more books!" Sam looked excited at the prospect.
“Okay, then. Steve, can you stay a few more hours? I’ll bring up dinner when I take over.” Tony stomped out of the room, barely restraining himself from slamming the door behind him.
"What?" Steve was thrown by the boys question.
"How do you want this, love," Tony whispered softly. "I can slowly tease you over the edge, I can worship you until you can do nothing but give into the pleasure, I can treat you like my perfect little babydoll that I simply adore….what do you want my darling?"
"It's okay to be upset, though, if you are," Steve assured him.
"That's why you have a couple weeks to think, darling, to get everything straightened out in that head of yours." Steve gave the boy a small smile.
Hello all! I hope everyone is staying safe!!
"Yup. Poor kid's never had a childhood."
She once again watched the colour rise to the surface and trail down her skin. Mesmerized by the look and feel of the blood and the numbness that overtook her, Natasha was startled when Tony knocked on the door.
Sam smiled, and replied, "I know."
"Dean. I've figured out what's going on with Dean. Well, maybe not all of it, a small part anyways-"
"Thank you, but I will be fine. I have my brother and your partner, not to mention I'm not one of the children losing their father to a foreign conflict," the teen smiled politely.
"How about you spank me instead?"
“Is that everything?” Dean asked, wiping the sweat from his forehead.
"That's what I'm doing, Dean."
Dean whipped around to face his little brother. “Hey, it’s okay, Sammy, we’ll get through it,” he assured the boy, wrapping an arm around his shoulders.
Steve stopped the car.
“I know you do your best, Dean.” Sam gave the teen a look that Dean couldn’t quite decipher. “And I really appreciate it.”
He finally found a hunt half an hour away in Jersey City. It was obviously a werewolf case; there were reports of wild animal attacks in which the victims' hearts were missing. The killings had gone on long enough for hunters to catch wind of the situation, and nothing indicated that the carnage had stopped, so it was the perfect time and place to stake out some hunters!
“The way you’re just pushing your wellbeing aside. Sam sees that, Dean, and he looks up to you. If you go about not telling us when you’re injured or in pain, he’s not going to, either,” Steve explained.
Dean's breath began to even out, though Steve's hand nor words ever slowed.
"Okay." He nodded. "I'll figure it out."
The man looked curiously at the arm still grasping Steve's.
"Are you gonna miss me, Papa?"
“One day at a time, eh, stud muffin?” Tony replied with his own smirk.
“Stop saying that and
Dean’s mind raced as he attempted to come up with a lie the genius and captain would accept, before he decided the truth was his best alibi.
"Oh, shit, Steve, is everything okay?" Tony began panicking. "It's Bucky, isn't it? He didn't make it?"
The young boy hid his face as he replied "I'm not really a fighter. I do more of the research. Dean is the really strong one."
Sam handed his bag to the man, still openly staring. Dean clutched his backpack closer to himself, then handed his over as well. He had a knife strapped to his calf that would give him enough protection for the moment and there was nothing in there worth fighting Hercules over if it went missing.
"Woah, calm down, nothing. It doesn't mean anything, just trying to end the chick flick moment, Sammy," the teen raised his hands in a placating manner.
"Trust me, boy. Keep my number, but only call if you think someone's gonna die, or worse. You got that?"
Sam shook his head. "No, that's exactly it. Today he—Dean, he smiled at me."
"Hey, hey," Tony started at the hitch of the captain's breathing. "Hey, I've got you. You're home now, you're home safe and sound with me and our wonderful kids."
Steve held up a hand and shushed his son’s chaotic rambling. “Yeah, he is pretty warm. I’m not too happy about that, either, but it’s nothing to worry about, Sam. I promise, the fever isn’t high enough for him to be in trouble.” Carefully, the man released Dean’s hand and grasped the younger boy’s shoulders.
“Do you really want to do that to Steve and Tony?” Dean asked quietly. “These guys have waited four years to bring you over to be their son, and you’re gonna risk all that for a memory that you’re gonna have anyways?”
“Got into a fight at school.”
So he just sat there. And stared.
“Okay. Thanks, Thor.” Sam surged forward and gave Thor the biggest hug he could before running off.
"Hello?"
Tony pulled the car into the garage. After closing his eyes and taking a deep breath, he turned to look at Dean...who apparently hadn't noticed their arrival.
happened, I want to know why you did it."
Dr Mills sighed. “I recall reading that you have a foster brother named Clint that’s twelve. Is that right?” She asked.
"Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit," Tony chanted, thrusting slightly, pulling on Steve's hair.
With a squeal, the doctor pushed the door open and let Steve walk through.
face,’ Thor,” he corrected.
“Long,” Dean replied, removing his coat.
Mr Wilson smiled, then stuck out his hand. "Sounds like a deal."
"Oh I bet Steve's rim jobs are heavenly. Or should I say naughty. He ever open you up with his tongue and use only his spit as thrust into you? Bet you call him daddy."
"Nothing Sammy don't worry about it." The older boy ruffled Sam's hair, laughing at the pout he got in return.
"...Bobby?"
"St—St—" Bucky forced out.
"It's nothing bad," Tony assured the kids, sitting on the edge of the massive desk beside Steve. "We just want to check-in."
"Take? I took an adventure! I didn't like it, though."
"NO!" They both screamed, startling Dean and themselves.
“Dean, I would like to apologize,” Tony offered, which caused Dean’s head to snap up suddenly in surprise.
“No promises, but I’ll do my best,” Dean replied, which was not the answer his parents were looking for, but they knew it was the best they were going to get from the teen.
Steve and Tony looked at each other and collectively took a bracing breath. Tony stood and moved to sit on the couch on the other side of Dean.
"Well?" The soldier took a breath to steel himself. "What are we waiting for? Let me meet the guy you're pounding into the mattress every night."
“Didn’t want you?” Steve squeezed his knee once more. “How could we not want you?”
"Open the fucking door."
Way to go, Dean, you ruined Christmas.
“Okay, enough of the sappy.” Tony clapped his hands, startling the teen. “Let’s close the lid and look at this thing of beauty!”
“Where are you taking Dean?” Sam appeared seemingly out of nowhere as the two men made it to the landing of the stairs.
"Tony!" Steve exclaimed, shocked.
The two boys looked at each other and smiled, then graciously accepted Natasha's expertise for the future.
"So we'll talk to them." Steve turned to Phil. "Can you stay? I'm sure the kids are gonna have questions. If they're okay with it, what do you say my love?" The soldier pleaded with his eyes to his husband. Tony rolled his eyes and threw up his hands.
"Bucky! Tony, I gotta go, Bucky just woke up. I love you too, I'll be home after visiting hours tonight."
"Food for the brats," the door swung open to reveal a grime-covered man carrying a loaf of bread and a small plate of cheese.
Dean rolled his eyes dramatically. "That kid doesn't leave a bear unpoked."
“You haven’t met Tony yet, the papers used to call him ‘scandalous’ every few days,” Steve laughed back.
When they were both 'acceptably dressed', Tony reached to pull the door open, when Steve stopped him and pulled the other man into a tight hug.
Quiet.
"Then maybe I need a punishment," Tony wiggled his eyebrows in innuendo.
"They fit perfectly into the family dynamic. Any attempt to remove them wouldn't be advised and would result in major problems," the man said from his position leaning against a bookcase. "They're my little brothers. I want them to stay."
“No. I’m not getting tested.”
There came an overwhelming cry of:"Papa!" Sam and Clint were currently trying to climb the man in attempt to hug the man, and the others were in various places in the kitchen getting dinner ready.
"Mine? Oh, honey, you were always mine," the engineer replied as he leant down to tease his husband's chest with the tip of his tongue. "This right here?" he flicked his tongue in the hollow of Steve's throat. "Mine. This?" He nipped lightly at the man's Adam's apple, "Mine."
"That can be a project for after school," Tony interjected, looking at his watch. "You guys need to get going if you're gonna make it on time."
(See the end of the chapter for
. And what did he get for it? Thrown across an old barn and through a wall.
"Sam finished off the rest of the cereal yesterday and was complaining he was hungry. Can't let the poor kid starve." Dean ran a hand down his face, exhausted. He hadn't properly slept since dad left, always watching and protecting Sammy, even when he slept.
"Please, Tony, please!" Steve cried, a single tear making its way down the captain's already tear-stained face.
The man sighed and, setting it aside for later simply nodded and said thank you. "And that leaves you, Dean!" Steve called to where the teen was gathering things from the fridge.
Cling paused, then shook his head. "No, Papa, I just...he said I was 'simple' cuz I didn't read the books he did, then kept using these big words so I didn't know what he was saying."
the one that didn't want dad to even come back in the first place!"
A shrug. "You love Thor."
Dean nodded. “Unfortunately, when ghosts haunt things, the objects have to be completely destroyed or else they’re not going to leave. So yeah, you’re not getting that ring back in one piece.”
“That was not the point and you know it. Anyways,” Steve directed the conversation back towards the teenager. “To ease our minds, Dean. Have you ever done recreational drugs?”
"Yeah. Tony, they are our sons. I know they want to go back with their dad but with what they've told us about him-" Steve paused and shook his head. "I don't want them leaving. We can keep them safe. We can give them a future! We will love them far more than that absent drunk ever could!"
“I wasn’t aware that Sam and Dean had an uncle?” Tony studied the man while too, shaking his hand.
SHORT CHAPTER ALERT
"Loki," Steve called, seeing the boy taking his seat beside Bruce.
Dean was floating. He couldn't feel his head anymore, and that was weird. He understood Tony perfectly, though.
"You mean, you mean you want to adopt me?" the boy whispered, in awe.
My Dearest,
"She didn't think it was disgusting when I had my fingers up her-"
Grinning, Steve leaned back down and kissed Tony deeply, leaving the brunet panting when he pulled away again. "Then we have sweaty, athletic sex," he confirmed.
The men watched as Sam's face fell, his eyes going big as the words sunk in. "You?"
"Tony, take a breath. Calm down." Steve reached for Tony's arm but it was quickly pulled away.
"Why do you think I'm the one that opened the door every time you 'couldn't find your other shoe'?" Sam asked, rhetorically. "I have an idea about what you went through, but I don't know what it feels like. And that, to me, is a win, Dean. You're the reason my nightmares are not being able to save you, instead of being the one lying in my own blood.
“Dean! Look over there, it’s Pastor Jim!” Sam pointed across the field. Low and behold, there the man stood, talking to another man clad in plaid.
The man dropped the bags to the floor, no notice or care where they landed and scooped his youngests in the tightest hug he could muster.
“Answer the question, Dean.”
"Yes, Tony, we're doing this for Dean," Steve interrupted, answering the question for the fifth fuckin' time. Steve held both the receipt with Bobby Singer's number on it and his cell phone in the other hand, his husband draped across his back blowing in his ear. "Stop it, love. Later, I promise."
Steve started placing all his things on the unused side table for tomorrow and leaned forward to kiss his best friend's forehead in farewell. "Not this late, Clint, you know you get nightmares."
Steve shook his head while cutting into his pancakes. "I'm still going to drive you kids to school, but I'm staying on leave for a while to take care of Bucky. He doesn't really have anyone left since his sister was in a car crash a few years back, so I'm all he has right now."
“Hey,” Steve reached across the table to lightly grasp the boy’s hand. “Don’t you dare apologize for being hurt. Tony has more than enough money, and we wouldn’t dream of asking you to pay any bill. The only thing we’re upset about is the fact that you needed to go to the hospital in the first place!”
“He’s not gonna do drugs with Sam there. And he’s eating, which means he can’t distract Sam long enough to get out his stash...If he even has one,” Steve whispered back.
"Yeah, where's Sam and Dean?" Clint sat straighter in the chair he was occupying, swinging his legs from around the armrest.
'You need to treat women with respect, how would you like it-, blah blah blah.'
Doesn’t feel like it.
"Because the clock isn't gonna come back if we scare it off."
"Because you're our daughter, Natasha. And we love you with all of our hearts."
Clint sniffed and wiped his nose on his sweater sleeve. "Get daddy?"
The five-year-old dropped his head and started to cry. Natasha abandoned the bath and wrapped the boy in her arms.
Steve stood back up immediately. "I'm sorry, I shouldn't have sprung that on you! I promise I'm not trying to punish you and I'll do my very best to not hurt you in any way. Would it be okay if the two of us sparred?" He asked and held out a hand to Dean to help him up.
"Yes, sir," the man blushed, saluted quickly and promptly left the room.
“Dad wasn’t always around to pass on traditions,” Dean delivered coldly.
"Fuck yeah. Esther Mathews in the broom closet in Kentucky. Tits were fucking amazing. And Felicia Sanders in Pennsylvania. Her cunt was absolutely delicious. Gave great head too. Want me to go on?" Dean fires back.
Tony nodded in response.
“Nice try, mister. Good luck on your math quiz today,” Tony chuckled as he ruffled Clint’s hair. “I’ll stay home with him this morning. I’ve got some meetings this afternoon, but I don’t want to go to them anyway…”
Steve sighed and waved the boy back to the screen. "We're talking about this later Clint."
Son of a bitch that guy is good.
Tony was silent for a moment. "Left or right?"
“Excuse me?!” the husbands asked in shock.
Tony was openly crying on the other end.
Steve squeezed the teen’s hand and kneeled in front of him. “Breathe with me, Dean. In. Out. There we go, good job. Again. In. Out.” The captain coached his son until the boy’s breathing evened out once more, watching as the panic faded.
“Hi, dad!” he called out before racing to the stairs.
“I will fight for those kids, Steve. I swear to you: I will fight for them until my dying breath.”
"They said they'd hurt you more," the boy whispered.
"But not me?"
"Well of course! He's our foster kid!" Steve blushed as he defended himself.
"I am Thor, I recently turned twenty-two. I adore the sport of football."
“They won’t! I have the best lawyers in the world, Steve. They aren’t touching our kids!” Tony pulled out his phone and started typing furiously.
"Why don't you ask
Dean slowly shook head, watching Nat glare at him with murderous eyes.
"Only if I don't get to commend you for that," Colonel Rhodes responded, leaning back in his chair. "Tony's gonna love this."
"That's fine, love," Tony smiled. "Although I think we should plan out some talks with the kids this week."
"I would highly suggest doing the exact opposite, babe. Forcing those two together?"
Dean hung his head and whispered, “Just like adults are never supposed to hurt you? How they’re never supposed to wake you up in the middle of the night to ‘play’ with you when your little brother is sleeping three feet away?”
With one final brush against his prostate and the friction of their stomachs against his cock, Steve buried his face and bit Tony's neck to stifle the scream of his orgasm. Tony threw his head back in a mixture of pain and pleasure and continued pounding into the man, following his husband in completion not long after.
"How about this: we call him and ask him questions, then if we feel it's safe enough for him to be near the kids, we invite him on a trial basis to Dean's party," Steve offered.
"Honey. Love. Studmuffin. Have you seen the size of your dick? It's gonna be a hell of a time getting it in little old me, the least you can do is let me ogle you like an expensive stripper," Tony teased.
"If you'd like," was her response. Dean thought hard for a moment.
A nod.
"Oh yeah? What does he say?" Tony responded, pulling his pyjama shirt over his head and watching his husband lean against the doorway of their ensuite.
"Oh, sweetheart," the genius leaned back down and began to devour his husband's mouth. "I'll always give you what you need," he whispered, before moving further down and sucking a nipple into his mouth.
Tony's whole body seemed to sag as he relaxed. "Of course, studmuffin. As long as you spend some time with me as soon as you get back," he replied with a wink and a playful grab of the other man's ass.
“But...I didn’t...I gave them all to you?” Dean’s words were slurred, though from intoxication, fever, or drowsiness was unclear.
Sticking out his tongue at his brother, Sam still cradled the piece of plastic and metal. "It wasn't about the sport. It was the fact that we stuck around long enough for me to finish the season with the team," the boy explained. Dean stopped laughing.
"Show off," the genius muttered.
“What are you gonna tell Mr. Wilson?”
Dean blinked, surprised. “Um, I think everything? I mean, I wouldn’t really know if I forgot something, but nothing is really too blurry–”
"Although," she continued, walking up and joining them at the table. "We need to talk about your execution. It only took them, what, half an hour to find their clothes? You can do better than that."
Dean scoffed. “Talk? What, you want us to have a little gossip session?”
He tossed a blue folder across his desk to the girl. Cautiously, she opened it.
"Hey, how do you know that I haven't adopted five more while you were gone?" Tony teased, causing the team to laugh at Steve's suddenly pale face. The others didn't know how likely that could be with a bleeding heart like Tony's.
Steve returned the smile and just replied: "Good."
"Understand what?" Dean finally locked eyes with the boy. "What do you possibly think that there is to
“Yeah, but Steve.” Tony turned to face the man. “He’s so much happier.”
Dean blinked in surprise. “What?”
The man inched closer, reading Natasha's face as to how close was too close, before reaching for her hand and holding it lightly. She stared at the hand in wonder, squeezing it tightly after a moment. Tony was a man. Tony was supposed to come with fear, but she felt...safe?
"Hmm, I don't know, Tony. I'm pretty tired," Steve teased, moving to pull away.
Steve glanced around at the other men and women. "Anyone else got a problem?"
"Yes, sweetheart?" Steve smiled, giving Sam the floor to speak.
“Mr. Coulson told us before you came,” Tony explained.
"And we'll kill you and replace you with him," he mused, throwing her down on the floor. "He's old enough now that a dick wouldn't kill him if we prepped him enough. Plus we'd get more money from the closeted governors that like little boys. You don't got no dick, bitch."
"But Deeeeean," the ten-year-old whined and poked the burrito blanket. "Papa said they're making crepes! They won't let us have any until you're awake!"
It was getting harder to breathe as Dean realized he was fighting off tears. He wanted to push the man away, but he couldn't remember the last time he'd just been held like this. It felt really damn good. Steve never pushed him away or said anything, he just kept rubbing Dean's back and held him tight, ready to hold him for as long as the boy needed.
"He said he wants to meet you first before the kids."
"Do you have a preference as to who stays with you, Nat?" Tony asked. Do you want Steve to stay, or me?"
The two stood in silence, both breathing a little heavier in the charged atmosphere. Loki dropped his eyes and nodded once.
“I mean,” Sam looked at his shoes, hiding the blush creeping over his cheeks. “Dean always made sure I had at least one present, but-”
Steve rolled his eyes and agreed. The engineer confidently walked into the room, but only made it so far as leaning on the wall beside the door.
"You're not thinking of sending them away are you?" Clint asked, eyes wide in disbelief.
Dean nodded slowly, then looked away from the man. “I thought you didn’t want me anymore,” he admitted.
"Dean I really like it here so far. Did you test them at dinner?" Sam asked as he flopped on his new bed. Every first night at a house Dean would throw the family with every supernatural test he knew of just in case they were living with monsters.
"We figured you would want to share a room for now. If at any time you want your own rooms just let us know and we'll fix something up, we have more than enough rooms." Steve told Dean. "Sam can you look at me please?" he called out to the boy. He made sure both boys were paying attention before speaking. "This is your room. No one else in allowed in your room at any time except for you. The only exception to this rule is when you're sick and need to be taken care of, or if we feel someone is in danger. Other than that, everyone in this house will get express permission before walking through this doorway. Understand?" Sam nodded and returned his attention to the computer. Dean eyed Steve, scanning him for something, before nodding slowly.
Tony did take his hand then.
“You said painkillers. You were hunting again, weren’t you?” Sam accused. “What was it this time? Ghost? Poltergeist?”
So, she decided not to fight it anymore. Sitting alone in a locked bathroom, the girl watched as the colour oozed upon her wrist and dripped onto the linoleum floor. Seeing the fresh, bright colour brought her back to that room, but that's where she was supposed to be, wasn't it? All the fear and helplessness left and she was in the blissful numb that overtook her after she killed the man. Everything and nothing mattered as she watched the colour drip-drip into a puddle.
A loud bang as the door swung inwards. Natasha sprang up to defend herself, but the attacker already had his hands up. Steve stood in the doorway of the bathroom with his hands held clearly in front of him.
Steve, I don't know about this." Tony admitted to his husband. "Are we really the best people to care for these boys? Dean is as amped up as a feral cat, and god Steve. He looks so scared!"
"I say we do it," Nat whispered, earning her a huge smile and a hand on her knee from Tony.
Congratulations to Ebbys91 who figures out the woman in the last chapter with the crying 2-year-old was in fact: Kate and Adam Milligan, and to Beakers47 who noticed the reference to 1.04 Phantom Traveller with Dean on the plane!!
“Sharing is a relative term,” Tony explained. “Christmas Eve we do all do our own things, then Christmas Day we spend as a family.”
"Look at this one, Sam!" Dean laughed, finding a picture of a young Sam, presumably having his first bath.
Drawing on his training, he fought the instinct to tense, staying perfectly still and relaxed as he took stock of his surroundings. Slowly opening one eye, the teen just about jumped out of his skin.
Hello all! The real Dean didn't get therapy, but THIS Dean sure is :D
} Thor started, but Loki interrupted.
Steve gave his family a huge smile. "Thank you, guys. You have no idea what that's going to mean to him."
“Oh yeah? How do you know? You’ve never been,” the teen pointed out.
Dean figured that if he couldn't phone a hunter to get Bobby's new number, he'd find one instead.
"See? Bitch. Just because Stark took her in, she thinks she's better than the rest of us."
Dean sighed loudly as he resigned himself to the fact that he was not going to be able to sleep in today and mumbled, “Breakfast.”
"No, I–"
"Yeah," the genius sighed and ran a hand through his hair. "Dean has been taking on more of a caregiver role while you were gone, I think Sam was extra worried you weren't coming back because of what happened to John, we need to talk to Loki soon about how he's doing because I think Dean might actually hurt him soon, and the others have missed you so much, it might be nice to just spend a couple of hours each with them just hanging out."
"And everyone goes to therapy. That one is non-negotiable."
“Great taste in music,” Tony commented, sitting in the passenger seat beside the teen.
"What do they do when they hurt you?"
Sam brought his eyebrows together in thought. "Yeah, I never thought about it but I guess it is."
Sam looked to the door, aware that their foster parents were none the wiser, and whispered, “
"We stay together. No matter what. I know how you guys like to split up siblings and Imma tell you right now that ain't gonna fly." Dean poked the man's chest, accentuating his point. "You even mention us going separate places and we'll be gone before you know it, and I promise you you'll never find us again."
"One knife?" Dean tried again.
"Dude, I heard she doesn't talk to anybody."
"There's nothing that-" Loki stopped and stood up and walked away from the man. "I don't want to do this. Just give me my punishment so I can go."
“Natasha, what’s going on?” Clint asked his sister, bright-eyed and scared. “It sounded like–”
"Therapy. Everyone goes. Depending on how much they need to go. For example Tony goes once every two weeks and I go once a week. Some of the kids go more often than that." Steve explained.
"Alright, names, ages, and a fun fact about you," Bucky commanded, smiling.
There were none.
be shy about drinking it; nausea's a bitch, and it's better to have something in there.
With a frustrated look, Steve sighed. "I'm really sorry I can't talk long, but I really miss each and every one of you and I love you all so much!" Steve blew a kiss into the camera, smiling when Clint and Sam returned the gesture.
He knew that
Hello hello! I hope everybody is staying safe and sane out there!!
"I taunted Clint. What's my punishment?"
"Natasha, honey. Did you hear me?" he asked. "Do you want popcorn?"
, so we're gonna be the first to extend the olive branch."
“You don’t have to tell me, but I don’t think that’s the truth, bud,” the man pushed.
She sneered and pushed past him, heading to hers and Clint's room to hide and push her feelings aside as much as she could. Tony blocked her.
You'll notice that I finally put a rating to this fic....this chapter is why lol
"These guys are the best. I had to pull a lot of strings to get you guys a place here." Mr Wilson started leading them to the house as he talked. "Their names are Steve and Tony, they're married and have adopted four kids already with their hearts set on another one as soon as paperwork goes through."
When Becky’s jeans were thrown across the room, Dean returned to lick the inside of her mouth, rubbing one finger down her wet thong. Damn. A fucking thong!
“Well then, I’m sorry I triggered it,” Dean stated slowly.
"Okay. Nat. She, admittedly, doesn't talk much. We're working on that, but we let her do what she's comfortable with. When she refused to speak to you did we get mad in any way?"
"In the kitchen!" Tony called back.
“We know what you’re father’s job was,” Steve revealed.
“Of course we are,” Steve reassured the boys, “I’m so sorry for phrasing it like that and worrying you. We actually want to move the court date up so we get to sign those papers sooner.”
"Do you know what an alcoholic is Sam?" Tony asked. Sam shook his head. "An alcoholic is someone who is addicted to drinking. Someone who feels they need to drink for whatever reason and has a hard time stopping. Does that sound familiar?"
Blushing slightly, Dean dropped his gaze again. "Why—"
Natasha stopped walking and glared at her brother, preparing to pick him up and start running from the police officer. She was going to take her in. Lock her up. She couldn't be locked up anymore.
"Steve," Tony responded, the same amount of adoration lacing his voice. "Steve, I love you, and it's wonderful to see you again, but honey," Tony paused. "You look like shit."
