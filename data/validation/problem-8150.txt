“That makes me feel better,” Barton says. “I thought I was losing my touch. Usually when I shoot someone they go down. When I shoot them twice, they don’t get back up.”
The sound of his butler - Steve still cannot get over the fact he has a butler - at the door comes almost as a blessing.
,” Bucky’s memory says. “
Steve looks at him, trying to find a catch or some malicious intent behind this, but all he sees in Sir Anthony’s expression is honest concern.
He goes to conceal himself before he remembers that he is doing nothing wrong at the present moment. Instead, he stands his ground, turning a page on his sketchbook to begin sketching a small songbird not far away.
All his research showed that Camp Lehigh was shut down years ago and Dr Arnim Zola
“I shall try,” Steve says with a slight bow. “As my host wishes.”
The voice catches Steve unaware and he startles. He opens his mouth to call out when the content of the words and the hushed tone register. He freezes.
The red and gold suit hangs in midair, hands and feet glowing as it hovers.
Colonel Danvers seizes the change in subject with enthusiasm as Colonel Rhodes protests Tony’s accusations. The cheer is a little forced, but it does the trick. The conversation becomes lively again as Colonel Danvers leaps into a tale. Steve is called upon several times to defend the army’s honour, but he is sorely outnumbered, even when Tony declares that he will take his side, to even the odds just a little.
“Schmidt is dead,” Steve says. He witnessed that moment with his own two eyes.
Sir Anthony pulls out his pocket watch and looks at it, his eyebrows rising. “Not soon at all. I have in fact taken up all of your afternoon, for it is quite certainly evening now. I have an appointment with Obie regarding some new designs.” He looks to the sky outside.
“You don’t know when the shadows have ears. I’ve heard Lord Fury has spies who can turn themselves invisible.”
“No need to move. I would not have you ruin the romantic image you make silhouetted in the window there. The picture of a dashing hero from a fanciful novel.” Tony’s words elicit a small laugh from Sam, which he smothers with his hand. Steve can’t control the pursing of his lips.
Something holds him for a moment, perhaps it is just the stillness of the night, or the way the moonlight shines off the buttons of one of the people approaching, but for some reason, he does not step forwards immediately. Which turns out to be the luckiest thing he could do, because the riders are talking and as they come closer, he recognises those voices. He has heard them enough times repeated in his head.
He collides with the man’s shoulder and pushes him clear out of his seat, and both of them go over.
And then the pair are gone, out into the night, leaving Steve’s mind swimming with more questions than he had had before.
It is as if he is descending into another world. Hephaestus’s smithy, he thinks idly as he goes down again. Upstairs the house is everything one would expect from the house of a man of consequence - elegant and formal, suited for royalty, should they choose to visit. But as Steve takes the stairs down, it is darker, more cramped. The pictures and ornaments are gone, replaced by rough-plastered walls and scraps of paper - notes and diagrams - and even in some places words written directly onto the walls. Steve feels as though he has stepped directly into Sir Anthony’s mind.
He turned to check the carriage, but any second where he was looking in there was a second when he didn’t have his eye on the people he was robbing.
“Returning bags in the middle of the night,” Steve says, shaking the hand with the bags in it. “Nothing taken, just wanted to have a look. I was going to leave them on the steps, but since you’re here… catch.”
“It’s not. I’m not. Fuck the lot of ‘em. Hydra can have ‘em for all I care. I’d just rather not end up with a rope around my neck.”
“Captain Rogers!” Ms Van Dyne’s voice comes from his right and he turns to her with a genuine smile. “As I perceive the rubber has finished, might I steal you away, for there is some business I wish to discuss with you.”
“I must forewarn you that I am terrible with art. And far too blunt about these things. Miss Po - Mrs Hogan, now, I must remember that - has always said I am too blunt about these things. I will speak my mind.”
Another flash of blue pulses from the gun of one of the Hydra guards. Steve can’t see the other one. Iron Man swings out of the way of it easily and Steve follows the energy blast with his eyes to a crackling crater in the wall. He makes a note to avoid getting shot.
. There is nothing wrong with
Sam sits next to him, stretching his legs out as he gives a weary sigh.
Ruin and destitution, Steve does not say, but he risks a look at where Tony is talking to Sam, his hands, still holding Steve’s sketches, moving animatedly.
His mind is still reeling at the implications. If the caller had been telling the truth the whole time. If Hydra is back - and it seems like it is - this is bigger than anything he’s ever looked into before. He’s helped people, sure. But he’s never - this is huge. He’s going to need-
“It doesn’t matter one way or the other,” Steve says. “We have more important matters to discuss.”
“Well, the person you wrote to,” Sam says.
“Sometimes,” Steve says.
“I am well, thank you,” Steve responds, amused.
The two men push him towards what seems to be a plain expanse of wall and Steve wonders if they’re going to stand him up against it and shoot him. It seems like an odd decision, though. If they wanted him dead, it would have been easier to spin if they’d just shot him on sight. No one would bat an eyelid at someone being shot for breaking into a secure military facility. Few people, anyway. Bringing him inside just to execute him would be… strange.
“You’re not scaring my guests with ghost stories again, are you, Jan?” Sir Anthony asks. He has a fond smile on his face and a drink in his hand.
“You’re being absurd,” Steve says. “And clearly we have heard different rumours if you believe Sir Anthony is the kind of man to fall in love.”
The approach with the most cover is round the back of the stables and he knows he is well hidden as he creeps up towards the door. There are no lights on in the house that he can see, although that doesn’t mean everyone is asleep, it makes him feel more at ease. But from the second he starts towards the house, leaving the shadow of the stable, he feels as though someone is watching him. Steve looks over his shoulder, but sees no one there. Just in case, he checks the mask on his face, patting it slightly.
“I have enough images of Sir Howard’s face looking down disapprovingly from the walls of my own house,” Sir Anthony says. Steve knows there is no reason to be disappointed, but there is disappointment mixed with his irritation at how disrespectfully Sir Anthony speaks of his dead father, Steve’s friend. It must show in his face again because Sir Anthony’s eyes go wide. “That is not to say that I do not wish to see your work. I would be delighted - just perhaps a different subject. Sir Howard and I were not close. We were both difficult men - I still am, and I somewhat doubt the grave has made him less severe - our relationship was likewise difficult.”
Mr Stane does not slam the door in Steve’s face, but he does end the conversation a little more abruptly than would usually be considered polite.
He had known that it might happen in an abstract sort of way, though Tony had not left his house since Steve had moved in - not overnight anyway, as far as Steve knew. It wasn’t as if he was keeping a watch on Tony’s comings and goings.
she paints, Captain Wilson,” Steve says. “And she speaks three languages.”
“There’s no one around.”
Being a meme has its ups and downs. On the one hand, he can reach more people. His followers had quadrupled. More people are reading the stuff he really cares about. More people are sharing the things he uncovers. More people are donating to the charities he supports.
“I hear things,” Captain Wilson says, and Steve jerks to look at him.
“Quality stands the test of time, sir. Now, if you wouldn’t mind handing all your bags and valuables out of the carriage for me. I’d hate to shoot such a beautiful face.”
“Then the whole system’s rotten?” Barton suggests. Steve grimaces.
“Captain Rogers,” she says. “Do you dance?”
“That Stark is selling secrets,” Steve says.
Steve tries not to react, but Sir Anthony was right that his face betrays him. He glances over to where Sir Anthony is talking to Mr Pym, Ms Van Dyne’s husband, and catches his gaze. Tony smiles, but Steve has to look away.
“People to rob?”
Every step feels heavier, like he’s dragging himself up a hill, but the hallway is as level and straight as it has always been, even if it feels more constricting. His shoulders seem to be almost colliding with the walls every time he takes a step.
“Okay. I need you to concentrate on breathing right now, Steve. Can you do that for me?”
Maybe this time.
He moves.
Sir Anthony scoffs.
“We?”
“Sorry to have made you doubt yourself,” Steve says. “If it helps to assuage your ego, it did hurt a great deal.” Barton makes a face, wrinkling his nose.
“I regret to say that it is, ma’am, and congratulations on your marriage.”
“Who else has access to his designs?” Steve says, he feels almost too ready to jump on any possibility that Sir Anthony is not the traitor. He hopes that his regard for the baronet is not clouding his mind. He must resolve to be objective in this matter.
Finally they return to Lakefield and Steve is honestly surprised when they are greeted at the door. He keeps forgetting that he has servants now. It feels like too much of an indulgence, but he would never be able to manage the house without them.
“Sir Anthony will see you, but he asks that you please be brief as he is in the process of performing a rather delicate task,” Mr Jarvis says.
“In amongst the times he spoke not so highly, I expect.” Steve cannot dispute the statement. Howard had always worried about his son’s profligate lifestyle and lack of propriety. “Your silence tells the truth of it, Captain Rogers, though you're too kind to speak ill of a man to his face.”
“The honest captain lies,” Sir Anthony says. “You're not fine. You're not recovered. Your face is as white as a sheet. Your hands are in fists again, now you are not thinking about them. You look as if you have seen a ghost, but you will not let me help you. You are as stubborn as a mule. You see - I am discovering your flaws, Captain.”
Steve opens his mouth, but finds he has no answer.
“The man is a traitor, to everything he claims to-” Steve cuts himself off as his voice begins to rise. The house is full of servants that Sir Anthony had hired. He cannot be overheard. He folds up the designs again and begins to change from his Nomad clothing as Sam turns his back.
“Any person who engages in treason and would lead us back into war is my enemy,” Steve tells her firmly.
“Lord Fury said you might prove incalcitrant. So he told me to tell you that he said the second tunnel would be better.” Steve feels his teeth grit together. Fury never will let that go. Though the first tunnel had proved sufficient in the end.
But Steve hadn’t thought he would
But it’s so
“To what do I owe the pleasure of your company?” Steve prompts. Sir Anthony’s eyebrows furrow.
“And you do? Know something about it?” Steve asks in spite of himself. Ms Van Dyne frowns.
“May I join you?”
“As I said, the rest of your funds are yours to do with as you see fit,” Mr Murdock says.
“They did say it was steady work,” Steve reminds him, taking the stepping stones in the river, probably not as carefully as he should.
Steve knows that sound. You can’t live in New York and not know that sound, usually swooping overhead, often battling monsters down the street as you decide to stay in the coffee shop a little longer than you had originally planned.
Steve hesitates. This is part of his idea that he has not yet had a chance to plan out - how he will actually approach the travellers. The forest will be his best bet of coming upon them unseen and making a clean getaway. He would like to know the lay of the land before he embarks on his mission.
“I agree,” Mrs Romanoff says. “And in that case, we need to approach the whole thing more cautiously.”
With Tony in front of him, though, it appears his mouth has taken on a life of its own.
Perhaps it was Sir Anthony’s ancestor who had sat here, making a decision that she knew could destroy her, but making it anyway, again and again, because she knew that she couldn’t live with herself if she didn’t make it.
“You’re back late,” Sam says, looking up from the newspaper he’s reading. He takes in Steve’s expression and his appearance. “Are you alright? You seem a little off.”
. This is big. This is earth-shatteringly big. He has stumbled into something huge.
He’s got no chance against the Hydra guys with their glowing blue guns, but if he can cut them off from the rest, then there’s a chance that Iron Man can get them out of here. He’s got to take it. But he needs a key.
“Captain Rogers,” Tony calls. “You’ve been too modest about your talents.” He beams as he holds up a sketch. “This study of the manor is beautifully depicted. I must have it.”
“Is this… are you a highwayman?” the driver asks, sounding incredulous. “I thought you guys were extinct.”
“You’re not going to sleep?” Sam asks as Steve goes to open the library door.
“It seems we have much to discuss,” she tells them. “We can talk in the parlour.”
“Mrs Barnes,” he replies.
“How-” he starts, but then bites his tongue. He does not know the man well enough for such a personal question.
“I meant nothing by it,” he says. “Just that the scene was very picturesque and gothic.” He shrugs. “Uh, how much for the landscape?”
“Captain Rogers,” Sir Anthony says, swinging round, back in motion again, his face broad and smiling, although there is an element of unease there that Steve would prefer to eliminate. “You have been out all morning. And here was I thinking that you kept to your rooms in quiet contemplation, and yet you are gadding about the countryside.”
“Yes, but the story’s more fun my way,” Ms Van Dyne says.
Stark Manor is as grandiose and imposing as ever, dwarfing everything that comes within its shadow.
“Right, but if you asked, I think he would say yes.”
“Flying won’t… you’ll be able to breathe?” Stark asks.
He waits another moment, until they have a fair distance to run before they could reach the curve in the road, and steps out into the road.
He should go to see them. They deserve that much. With his newfound fortune he could see them well cared for. And they should… they deserve his apologies. They deserve at least that much. They have already heard the worst, of course they have, but it is his duty to offer them what comfort he can.
“What? You weren’t planning on inviting me?” Steve honestly hadn’t thought that far ahead.
And Bucky might suspect, but he does leave, which is practically permission. Not that Steve needs permission. He’s an adult. He can make his own decisions. And his decision tonight, is that he’s going to look into those creepy emails.
He has never been good at waiting, despite it being a major part of army life, and he finds himself no better at it now.
“Not if he has any choice in the matter,” Mrs Romanoff says, before returning to the more pressing matter. “Your report was hardly the first inkling we had that something was not right,” Mrs Romanoff says. “It merely confirmed our suspicions. ”
“That seems like it might prove more dangerous than it seems,” Steve says, although he is vibrating with recognition of the feeling.
“I’m not your boss anymore, Happy, I thought we’d sorted that out. And no. I’m sure your new wife would be very unhappy if you returned from your honeymoon with an extra bullethole.”
Steve angles the lamp down to see the contents of the chest more clearly. There is a box, some cloth, and what appears to be a diary.
“Bad news?” he asks, his eyes flickering over Steve’s face. Steve wonders what he sees there. Does he see the grief that Steve can barely feel, or does he see the strange blankness that seems to be all that Steve can summon up?
“There is something about you.” Tony lifts his hand to wag a finger. There is dirt under his nail, Steve notes, almost absently. “Something I just can’t put my finger on.”
That sound means Iron Man.
“You’re probably right about that,” he agrees, then he steps forwards and Steve puts all his attention into his breathing, because if he starts thinking about how Iron Man is
“If he shoots, the militia will hear it,” he tells her. He turns to Steve with a wicked grin. “They’ll be on you faster than a pack of dogs.”
Iron Man makes a sound of triumph and holds out Steve’s inhaler, which Steve grabs and pulls towards his mouth.
Their investigations find little purchase. Sir Anthony did meet a man at the inn, but the meeting was brief and Sir Anthony left soon after. He would have had more than enough time to reach Lakefield and depart before Steve and Sam had returned from their outing. Delilah, the maid, did see someone from a window that afternoon, but could give no clearer description than 'a dark haired man', which could indeed, describe Sir Anthony, but could also describe any number of other men within walking distance. Steve would rather believe some enterprising person took advantage of their absence, rather than the alternative.
“That often seems to be the case,” he says. Sam must sense that he has strayed too close to the edge of the cliff and he pulls back.
“Then you owe the new baronet the courtesy of saying no to his face, don’t you think?”
The room is mostly bare apart from a small desk and a heavy wooden chest. Steve looks behind him as there is another scraping sound and he sees the hidden door shut behind him, leaving him bereft of the moonlight that had been coming through the library window. He is alone with only the flickering flame of the oil lamp.
“Then have fun,” Sam says, patting Steve on the shoulder. “I shall see you later.”
“Mr Rogers,” the face says. The voice is digital, almost static, but with a recognisable accent. Steve blinks and stares.
“I took a bit of a tumble,” Steve tells him. “Falling from a horse hurts, did you know?”
“You wouldn’t be imposing,” Captain Wilson assures him. “My family gets sick of my face all too quickly. A fresh face and some fresh conversation will be welcome.” The captain looks at him and Steve cannot see a lie in his face. He is not sure what Steve Rogers, who has been nothing but awkward and lost since he stepped aboard, has done to deserve this offer of friendship, but he knows he cannot refuse it.
Steve hopes against hope that what he’s carrying is the proof he needs. This has perhaps become a little closer to danger than he would have preferred.
“I’ll have to go through page by page, and by the time I’ve done that, they could have-”
The man spits at him and looks to the side. Steve doesn’t follow his gaze, doesn’t need to. He can hear the Militia well enough as they charge through the undergrowth. They are not trying to be subtle. It is clear the man will not say anything and Steve has no time to convince him further. It is possible he holds the proof of his own good intentions in his hands. It is also possible that he holds nothing more than some man’s worldly goods. Either way, he is not willing to discover which at the end of a militia rifle. He may have Sir Anthony’s ring burning a hole in his pocket, but that does not mean he wishes to use it. Nor that he would necessarily have the chance. In Steve’s experience, the militia tend to shoot first and ask questions later.
He goes through the steps as best he can, one by one, all the while he knows he is stiff and wooden, like a tailor’s dummy, but Mrs Romanoff keeps up the conversation, asking him how he is enjoying the area, how he is settling in.
“I know Tony. We grew up together,” she says. “I cannot believe him capable of all the things they accuse him of. I will confess that I did believe he and Miss Potts - Mrs Hogan, now - to be engaged, but then she married Mr Hogan and they are now on their honeymoon, so I must have been mistaken.”
“I’m afraid I do not understand,” Steve says. Tony turns to survey the room and Steve takes the opportunity to check that nothing incriminating is peeking out. He quickly drops a pile of other books on top of the first. Just in time as Tony swings back around.
“Lord-” Steve looks between them. “And why should I believe that? Anyone can say a name and the two of you had clearly been here long before I told him what I had overheard.”
Yeah, he might be in over his head, just a little bit.
But this is no time for recriminations, his hands full of borrowed - stolen - goods, halfway up the baronet’s front path.
. The words resonate in his mind. It was that thought that had sent him to the army and to Erskine. It was that thought that had taken him across the sea to fight Hydra. And it is those words that remind him of those people in the inn, weeks ago, plotting something that could lead to more war and more good people dying, something that could lead to Hydra rising from its shallow grave.
It’s a good few metres to the panel on the wall, and his breathing is still uneven, his legs shaky. The dust in the air is settling, but it’s not helping matters. And then there’s the small issue of the men with guns shooting at them.
But he had known that this might happen.
“I thought you were meant to be smart,” Barton says. “Nat, I told you coming here was a stupid idea.”
Steve stuffs the diagrams and the note back into the book, carrying it with him.
He hands the letter over to the footman for the post, with the assurance that it will be dispatched this evening.
There are four generations under the same roof. Sam’s grandmother sits in state, surrounded by the scraped knees and tearaway hair of her great grandchildren, who she deals with according to some secret inner hierarchy that only she knows.
It is not merely clothes, that Sir Anthony seems concerned with. He declares one day that Steve needs a phaeton.
“You’ll be looking for something more along the lines of the bay rather than the chestnut over there,” Sir Anthony says, and Steve hums for a second.
“I had thought I would be guiding you in this,” Sir Anthony says with a delighted laugh. “But I’m not surprised that you should want a more difficult horse.”
Steve wants to push it back.
“We are talking here of men’s reputation, their honour,” he says. “We must be utterly certain of our own proof before we bring it to anyone’s attention. It would not do to ruin a good man by speaking in error.”
“My condolences,” Sam says after a moment. “Were you and the baronet close?”
As the rubble settles, Steve sticks his head out cautiously, and through the clouds of dust that start to tickle and choke at his throat.
“I would not presume to profess to care for someone I did not,” Steve says carefully. “And if I cared for someone, I would not wish to see them suffer.” Penelope and Mr Moore both beam at him. “Though the situation has not yet arisen.” Their smiles fall.
Steve listens avidly to the sound of Sam’s footfalls on the hallway carpet as they gradually move away and he draws in a deep breath to calm his heart rate.
And on top of that, there is the matter of the bequest. He had never thought. Never considered- He and Sir Howard had occasional conversations, but nothing to indicate this level of generosity.
“Oh shit.” Iron Man says, landing on the floor. They can still hear the thud of footsteps and the shout of voices, but Steve needs his phone. And he needs to breathe. “You’re asthmatic. Where’s your inhaler?” How does Iron Man know he’s asthmatic? Steve wonders with the little bit of his brain that is just sort of… detached from the situation. His hands still scrabble at the guard’s uniform.
“I thought we talked about this, Tony. You need to be more discreet with these sorts of things. After what happened with Miss Potts-”
As they had been speaking, Steve had tried to get closer, but the walls of the courtyard and the echo had made it impossible to get a fix on where the pair were. Their voices seemed to come from a different direction depending on where he stood.
Sir Anthony himself stands in shirt sleeves, coat, waistcoat and cravat discarded onto a chair nearby. His sleeves are rolled up, displaying strong forearms, sheened with sweat that glistens golden in the oil lamplight that fills the space. He is doing what appears to be smithing work, beating a piece of metal into compliance.
He lifts it up gently and opens the cover, wondering what Howard may have left here.
“And you are a traitor,” he says. “Who are you working for?”
“It is not a fault to see the best in people.”
There is a hiss of static.
“I invited him to see my sketches,” Steve says. That surely should not be taken the wrong way. Sam blinks.
“Are there many bandits on this road?” Steve asks. Sam shrugs.
That sound means help.
“Steve,” Sam says.
“Call me Nomad,” he calls back and reaches up to tip his hat, but as he does so, he sees a flash of metal out of the corner of his eyes.
“My wardrobe is perfectly fine,” Steve says, turning to the tailor. “I am sorry for any inconvenience this has-”
“You just want to avoid the honourable Miss Throckmorton a little longer,” Steve says with a laugh that only sounds half broken.
“Who else could you be working for?” Steve asks. “And rest assured, I will not go easy on you because you are a woman.”
“So people keep telling me,” Steve says. “My friendship with Sir Anthony is none of your business, but I will inform you that I have no aspirations to romance at the moment.”
“You are welcome at any time,” Steve tells him quickly. “I only meant that I am sorry I could not be here to welcome you, or to hear more of your music. It was very beautiful.”
He has been there for two weeks, and feels as though he has spent most of those in the library, when the letter catches up with him, redirected in the neat hand of his landlady.
“I’m a simple man,” he says with a shrug. "There’s really not that much to know.” Tony laughs, abrupt and a little bitter, pulling his head around to look out of the window instead. The loss of the pressure of his gaze is like a physical sensation.
“I should kill you where you stand for your betrayal,” Steve says. “You’re killing good men, you and Stark both.”
There’s something on the wall. A metal panel with what looks like a button and a keyhole. He cranes his neck to see what’s written underneath it.
“The hold up is… a hold up,” the driver replies. He raises his hands slowly, dropping the reins. “Please. Don’t shoot.” His words fall a bit flat, as though he doesn’t really mean them.
“Maybe we can talk about that
His hands grip into the stone, so hard that he almost feels like it’s grinding against the bone. He has no business being here at all. This was never his place. He lets out the breath he is holding in his lungs, sees it fill the spring night with mist before dissipating into nothing.
Steve freezes, thinking of that empty door. Sir Anthony cannot know - can he? He left the shooting party early after all. He might.
“What exactly are you doing?” Sam asks, as Steve checks the bag to see if anything is missing. All seems to be in place.
Everything is indeed in order, laid out in black ink on heavy cream paper. It is a history of his whole career, every attack, skirmish and offensive he had been part of, cut down to a name and a financial measure of how valuable it was, and alongside them, his wages, and subtracted neatly, the monthly rent and lawyer’s fees.
Sam looks at him curiously, but doesn’t say anything and Steve wonders what it is he sees in Steve’s face when he looks. It cannot be anything good.
A title catches his eye. Buried between the treatises of an ancient general, whom Steve has read half a dozen times, and a book of erotic love poetry that he’s only read once, is a thin title. He probably wouldn’t have noticed it if it hadn’t been for talking to Ms Van Dyne earlier. The title is
That’s definitely not a good sign. But
“Certainly,” Philip says, darting in to lead Steve away to be measured before he can change his mind.
“Well, if you ever decide that you are doing that, then no one would say it was a bad match.”
“You don’t have to come with me,” Steve says as the clip-clop of their horses’ hooves dulls in the mud of the road. “Your family will miss you.”
The truth is that he hasn’t been able to sleep properly since he returned. His sleep is fitful, shattered by nightmares. He does not need much, these days, which is fortunate. But he would appreciate one night where he wasn’t awoken in the dark by the echoes of screams and the scent of death in his nostrils, choking him.
From a distance, he doesn’t recognise the driver or the carriage, but as it approaches, he is hit by the sudden familiarity and a cold wave of horror washes over him.
“Your opinion of him?” Sam asks, his eyebrows going up.
He crosses to where his sketches sit on the table and turns to hand them to Tony, but Tony is looking at the piano.
Tony glances over at him and smiles and Steve feels his heart hammer against his chest.
“No, Mr Rogers. I am Dr Arnim Zola.”
The man provides some small cushion for Steve’s fall, but he himself is not so lucky and Steve hears the cry of pain and the crack of something breaking. Steve does not think it is a branch.
Steve grits his teeth in an effort not to respond.
“I thought I had cured you of this delusion. We have established that I am not perfect.” Steve sighs. “You insist on teasing me with this. As for any future partner, should I have one, I would not wish to hold anyone to such impossible standards. I fear that would not be a recipe for a happy connection. I should only wish, in the event that I marry, that I find someone who challenges me and whose flaws complement my own. Someone perfect for me.” Steve flushes deeply, realising he has strayed across the line into conversational waters that may be too personal. “Though I confess I am fond of music, although I lack the skill to play myself.”
“But not all his followers are,” Sam says. “Maybe we’ll be lucky, but it doesn’t hurt to be prepared. There are rumours of Hydra forces still at large. If Sir Anthony has something up his sleeve, I’d like to have it ready and waiting, in case we aren’t lucky.”
“That’s the spirit!” Sir Anthony tells him with a grin.
“Hush your mouth, you idiot. You don’t go shouting words like that out just anywhere. And where’s this newfound patriotism coming from?”
For anyone else, the noise and hubbub of the gathering would drown out the fainter sounds from the balcony, but Steve’s hearing is acute and he can still make out Mr Stane’s voice.
“I believe they have all been too busy telling me the local gossip,” Steve replies. “Which is a shame, as I do enjoy a good tale.”
“Steve!” It's the first time he’s heard that shorter form of his name spoken since Sam on board
“A...pparently?” Steve agrees. He would very much like to bury his head in his hands. Tony narrows his eyes and purses his lips.
He heads towards the door and Steve finds a question bursting from his lips.
“Perhaps the same thing,” Sam suggests, spreading butter liberally onto his toast. “As you said, it is unlikely that the two are unconnected, but perhaps the connection is not what you think.”
His hands are steady and he has no doubt in his mind that he is doing the right thing. If he is caught - but he does not intend to be caught. He has thought this through and planned it out thoroughly. As thoroughly as he would any other battle, though the field may be a little different and the combatants fewer in number.
“The glamorous life of a national hero,” Sam teases.
Steve pushes Sir Anthony from his mind again and by the evening he is all but forgotten, or so Steve tells himself. He will ride over to see the man tomorrow and address the misunderstanding. For now he has more pressing concerns.
Once he has set his mind to a path, it has often been observed that Steve is not easily swayed. But he is not so foolish as to set out with no plan. The mask and the secret passage are a start, but there are other plans that need to be put into place before he can put his plan into action. He will need to disguise Liberty, his horse, but some soot from the fire should take care of that, blacking out her mane and the white star mark on her forehead.
“Just me,” Steve replies. He’s aware he’s dragging the mood down. The captain is trying to be friendly. Steve would swear he used to be better at this. Maybe he never was. Most of his conversations ended with the other person walking away, or with them punching him. That’s probably not a good track record. “What about you?
The words slip out of Steve’s mouth, a part of the persona he pulls on with his highwayman’s outfit. The Nomad, as he decided to style himself, is an amalgam of every adventure tale he has read. The kind of stories he and Bucky would read when they were kids - most emphatically without their parents’ permission. He is a rake, a flirt, but Steve hasn’t really fallen all that well into that aspect of the character.
He pulls himself together and opens the door, stepping in as quietly as he can and nodding to Rick, who takes his hat and coat. It is not very far to the door to the morning room and it is ajar, the music louder here, but just as… ethereal.
He wheels Liberty around and urges her on. The two traitors are used to riding, but their mounts are nowhere near as well trained or as fast as Liberty, and she quickly outpaces them as Steve draws her up between the pair of them, her hooves eating up the ground. He levels his pace, so the three of them ride abreast. The woman looks at him and aims her pistol, but as she does so, Steve throws himself bodily from his saddle towards the man.
“You know we’re not currently at war,” Steve replies.
Before he knocks on the door, he checks his appearance.
Steve’s not sure he knows how to be anything else anymore, but he nods and bids her farewell before stepping out the door and into the hard daylight on the street.
“I daresay you are right about that,” Steve says. “Is there a problem with banditry in the area, then?” he enquires.
“That wasn’t drama, it was misdirection.”
“I’m not going to get arrested,” Steve says.
“I do not need more-”
“Is it a love letter?” another of the children asks. “Is it from your sweetheart?” There is a ripple of giggling, and Sam’s determined cousin is poked from multiple sides, which Steve studiously ignores.
Steve has to read it three times, to make sure he is seeing what he thinks he is seeing.
“I’ll wait downstairs, then. Don’t be too long. I did tell him I would see him in the morning, not the evening, after all.”
“Steve,” Sam repeats, reaching out to touch his shoulder, but Steve steps away before he can make contact. He is in no mood to be soothed. His entire chest is squirming.
“My point, my boy, is that society will be missing you, as you are missing society.” He pats Tony on the shoulder with a good deal too much familiarity in Steve’s opinion.
She smiles at him, amused, but the music draws to a close and all the couples separate.
The wind whips his face, surely turning his cheeks a brilliant red, but he ignores it, still staring downwards. The clouds look soft and inviting below them, almost solid. But he knows if he touched them they would disappear like an illusion.
The pair of them shoot each other another look.
“Sir Anthony,” Sam says. “It is good to see you.”
The offices of Nelson and Murdock are clean and almost disturbingly tidy – the reason for which becomes clear when he meets Mr Murdock and discovers him to be completely blind. They also contain an inordinate number of empty chairs, as if they had prepared to meet with an entire regiment, rather than just one man.
And this was what it all amounted to. So much blood and fear for a list of numbers in a book on a man’s desk. It was as if those place names were nothing but names, like the roaring in Steve’s ears - the screams, the thunder of the guns - was never even there.
“Yes, please. I mean if you would be so kind,” he says quickly, reaching up a hand to run it through his hair.
He stands in front of the mirror and does not recognise himself.
Getting shot always hurts. It forces the air out of your lungs. But there are always a few seconds before the pain really sets in and Steve makes the most of them, urging Liberty into a canter, then a gallop, hearing the shouting voices behind him.
“Ah…” Sir Anthony coughs. “That was the intention. At least it was when I set out. I thought that as you had been so good as to show me your sketches, I could do this… for you. You had mentioned previously that you would like to hear me play.”
“We’re heading into Brooklyn skyport,” Captain Wilson says, snapping the silence between them. “You been there before?”
“We have avoided any major problems so far.”
“I… thank you,” Steve says, for lack of anything better to say. Sam just smiles.
But he forges ahead, not knowing where he is going in the slightest, but Liberty seems to know something, or she at least has a firm idea of where she would like to be. She picks her way around trees and through the undergrowth, sure and quick.
“Excuse me, sir. If you wouldn’t mind pulling up for a second,” he drawls, fumbling the first few words and having to repeat them. What if it’s Tony inside? It probably is. What if Tony recognises him? Not that Tony will be paying that much attention, probably.
It is at that moment, as Mr Stane offers him a drink, that Mr Jarvis reappears in the doorway. There is no one accompanying him and Steve doesn’t need to glance at Mr Stane to know there will be triumph in his eyes.
“Are you going to dance?” Sam asks, nudging Steve’s shoulder. “There are many people hoping you will.” Steve tries not to look around, though he can feel the eyes on him.
He shuts the book, the
“You say that, but-” Steve begins to gesture over to the clockwork machines on the other side of the room. They have a curious charm about them, not like the sleek lines of the airships, but charismatic nonetheless. Before he can explain his point, though, there are steps on the stairs.
“Based in truth,” Sir Anthony says, waving a finger at her. “There was a highwayman who operated in the area during the worst of the magic purges. The Dark Avenger, they called him, I've seen the warrant written for his arrest, signed by the king, but the part about him rescuing his lover and dying in the attempt is a fanciful embellishment, I’m afraid. As far as I know, he evaded capture until The Purge was ended and then probably lived out a long and unremarkable life. I sincerely doubt his ghost haunts the road.”
He wants to do this again and again.
“I hear things,” Captain Wilson repeats. Steve doesn’t say
“Death is only an end for those who lack vision,” Zola’s voice says. It seems to be coming from everywhere. There must be speakers built into the walls. “Those of us who have the intelligence to see past it can conquer death as we conquer everything else. When my mortal body started to fail me, I looked to the future. I uploaded my consciousness into a more resilient form. I am no longer bound by flesh.”
“We are all looking for something.”
“I would ask you not to spread such scurrilous rumours,” Steve says firmly. “The baronet’s reputation-”
“Pho- pHone,” Steve repeats. His inhaler can wait.
No legal way.
None of the names he thinks of fits. They are all too dark sounding, or too deadly. He doesn't intend to hurt a soul, not unless he happens upon the traitors themselves, and even then it is information he needs.
Tony gives his goodbyes and Steve watches from the window as he mounts his horse and rides off. At the gate, Tony pauses and turns in his saddle to look back, raising a hand in farewell. Though he knows the chances of Tony seeing him are slim, Steve returns the gesture.
“Of course,” Mr Murdock says, reaching for another folder on the corner of the desk. He runs his fingertips over the embossed leather briefly, then holds it out. “I believe you’ll find everything is in order, Captain.”
” Bucky’s shade suggests. “
He does not hear a gun being cocked, but he does hear one, distinct footstep behind him. It must be meant to be heard, for it is too close to be the first such step, and too distinct to be any attempt at stealth.
He should tell Sir Anthony and show him the room. Steve thinks that Sir Anthony would be interested, especially if it was a member of his family who wrote this diary, who saved those people.
“I’ll be sure to check with Sir Anthony,” Steve says.
He had had the piano tuned out of obligation more than anything. Steve cannot play a note and Sam has confessed that his fingers, while more than agile enough to tie the strongest knots required on skyship, have never managed to translate that to piano playing. But the piano had been there and Steve assumes at some point he will have to invite people round and there is never any shortage of young people wanting to show off their accomplishments.
“I’m not trying to court him, we’re just friends.”
They can’t talk to each other up here. Stark’s faceplate is gone and the wind snatches away any words Steve tries to say before they can be heard. But flying like this, without a plan between him and the world…
And Steve would be in no position to accept such overtures even if they were made. He is lost since the war ended and his newest exploits would be unthinkable if he were connected to anyone, let alone Sir Anthony. He will risk no one else to his mission.
“What happened?” Sam asks, coming to help him to a seat. Steve hisses.
“My apologies, Mr Stane. This is my fault,” he says. “I was feeling a little out of sorts and I needed to catch a breath of fresh air. Sir Anthony was merely enquiring after my health, as a considerate host. I assure you that he has been nothing but the picture of hospitality.”
Next to him, Colonel Danvers has a half smile curling her lips as she stares Stane down.
and also Tony Stark, then he’s going to do something really stupid - like forget how to breathe.
“I would not dream of taking an item of such sentimental value,” he says. She looks surprised, but slightly mollified. “I do have a bag here for any other valuables, however.” He tosses it to the ground in front of Tony. “And as I said, all other valises, cases and baggage would be appreciated.”
“What would we inform them of?” Steve asks, and although he knows that Sam is right, it feels wrong somehow to pass this on to someone else. “That a man and a woman - we don’t know who - are transporting something - we don’t know what - on behalf of a gentleman - whom we also do not know - that will in some way harm the country… but we don’t know how. And Hydra, whom everyone knows is gone, since I- Since Red Skull fell, is possibly involved.”
“Don’t. Get. Arrested,” Bucky commands. Punctuating each word with a jab of his finger. Steve makes the boy scout sign with his hand. Bucky shakes his head. He knows Steve was never a boy scout.
Beyond the wall is what looks like an elevator. And on the far wall is a symbol he only recognises from his research. A skull with tentacles, inside a circle.
He begins the evening with an observance that the late baronet, Sir Howard, had a marvellous magnetic charisma about him.
“If he were part of this treason, don’t you think he would be more likely to kill you than to ask for an alliance?” Sam says. “He knows you're looking for something after all, and though he doesn’t know what that something is, he must know there is a chance it is related to his dealings.”
“It seems a shame for it to stand silent,” Steve says, sighing. “I have no intentions of marrying in the near future.”
“Sam,” Steve says.
“Then I suppose that Nomad is not yet retired,” Steve says with a weary sigh.
Steve leans forwards and carefully tugs at the creamy corner that has been revealed with his fingernails.
“I have no lord - or lady,” Steve points out.
“Thank you,” Sir Anthony says, without even looking at him. “I’ll see if I am free, but I would not wish to inconvenience you.”
Then he leaps off into the darkness of the woods, hoping the dark colours of his outfit will camouflage him well enough.
“Yes sir,” Barton says. “So it’s a good thing I weren’t stealing anything.”
“It keeps me busy,” Steve replies. “It was nice meeting you again. Thank you for not shooting me.”
“I’ve been patient,” Steve points out, drawing a deep breath. He knows that Sam is right, and that he has waited all this time - months even - to get this far, and he should not be put off by more difficulties. But the frustration rising in him as he feels so close, and yet again has little to show for his efforts, is clawing its way through his chest. He turns to the book again and tears it open, a little too vigorously, and he hears the rip of paper.
“Your mind is struggling to comprehend the situation,” Zola says, sounding pleased with himself.
“If Fury had actually shared his reasoning behind tha-,” Steve cuts himself off. This is no time to go over old arguments. He turns to stare at the painting above the fireplace, though that hardly helps his mood. The battlefield it shows is merely another reminder of what may be on the horizon. He glares at it. He will take it down tomorrow, he does not know why he has let it stay up so long. He tears his gaze away from it and back to the conversation. “That will serve as proof enough, I suppose it must.” He sighs. “Though one day he may need to let that go.” He turns to Sam, who is looking amused with the whole situation, glancing between Mrs Romanoff and Steve with the air of an avid spectator.
It throws him off his guard, though.
“Ah! I should have sent word, yes,” Sir Anthony says. “My manners are appalling, my mother…” he breaks off, as though the words have come out of his mouth quite without his permission. “She would be appalled,” he says, more slowly.
“No mistake, Captain Rogers,” Mr Murdock says. His lips curl in amusement. “We have a full accounting of all your finances, if you would like to see it.” Steve nods, then remembers the man won’t be able to see him.
On one day he even brings his tailor.
“Wouldn’t be the first time,” Steve says.
The uniform wins him a nod or a brief curtsey from the people he sees on the street, people he doesn’t know, people he barely recognises, people who no longer recognise him. He is no longer Little Stevie Rogers who grew up round the corner, his lip split and his shirt untucked; he is an army captain.
He stands, the mask still in place and in the flickering shadows it is easy to imagine that Bucky and Peggy are standing with him.
“I honestly couldn’t care less,” Steve tells him, but he does rebutton his coat before they set out.
“I’m telling you, if someone finds out what we’re carrying, we’ll be hanging from the gallows before the sun’s even risen.”
“The-” Steve starts, but she’s already turning, her dress a swirl of deep red.
The ride to Melward is pleasant, and Steve is surprised to find the baronet a good conversationalist. Or perhaps it is that he is surprised to find that they can hold a good conversation together. Steve has met plenty of rich and titled men over the years, and seldom have their areas of interest overlapped in such a way as to make conversations enjoyable, but Sir Anthony is not what Steve had expected. He has a way of looking at and describing the world which makes Steve see things differently, and, on occasion, Steve is even startled to find himself chuckling at some observation or other Sir Anthony has had about Brooklyn, or the military.
“I… not directly,” Steve says, flustered. “I wanted to let him know that they did not damage my good opinion of him.”
“You are beginning to sound like you have designs upon me yourself, Mrs Romanoff.”
Steve manages to sit through two dances before someone comes up to him, a striking young woman with bright red hair set in perfect curls.
“Tonight is bound to give us both grey hairs, it seems,” Sam says, rubbing a hand over his face. “Did you know she was there?”
Steve thinks of the others. The men who had fallen just because they followed him.
“You seem to have made a robust recovery in your adulthood, I'm glad to see,” Sir Anthony replies. “I don't believe there is anyone who would look at you now and call you anything other than a fine specimen of manhood.”
“Sir Anthony, this is-”
Steve is not sure how to answer that, but it seems he does not need to, Sir Anthony continues.
’s going in to dock, right?” he says, searching for a topic of conversation he won’t kill.
Sam gives him a look as though to say he is not fooling anyone, but Steve ignores it and Sam allows himself to be moved back to talk of other matters. If Steve’s mind is still half on the baronet, then he tries to hide it as best he can.
No. The man is doing exactly as he said: looking out for Tony’s best interests. To question his motives would be overstepping the boundaries of friendship in a terrible manner.
“Sam,” he says, cutting through the birdsong and the rustle of leaves on the breeze. His friend turns to him. “I'm struck by the peace and solitude here. If you don’t mind, I’ll leave you to complete your errand alone and explore a little more. It has been a while since I’ve done any sketching.”
“How-” Steve hesitates, but Sir Anthony’s face is so open, he continues in spite of his misgivings. ‘How do you do it? How do you smile and dance and entertain when they died and they aren’t here?’ Is what he wants to ask, but the words will not come. “How long can they cope without you?” he asks instead. They have been out here alone together too long. People will talk. This evening has proved that people do little else. The thought is uncharitable and he chastises himself for it. These are good people and they take an interest in each other’s lives. He has seen nothing truly malicious in it.
“I am not being clear,” Steve says, sighing in frustration. “I meant to say that I do not find it unpleasant to be here, talking to you, but that I do find the business I must discuss unpleasant by its nature in that I wish it were not necessary.”
“You’ve been shot?” Sam asks.
“What do you think she wants?” Sam asks.
“Of my grandmother when she’s got her heart fixed on something? Definitely.”
Steve knows he should invite the Barnes family to visit. It is abominable manners that he has not yet done so, but he can never bring himself to finish the invitation whenever he begins it. He has wasted reams of paper in such fashion.
He sets off and Steve watches him walk across the field towards the village a little longer, then turns to the road and the forest with ambush in mind. He pulls out the pocketbook he always carries, although he hasn’t put pen to paper in months, and sets about finding the place with the greatest strategic advantage.
The pleasant atmosphere continues until they leave, earlier than Steve would like, but he cannot allow his resolve to falter merely because he wants to bask in the baronet’s laughter for another hour or more.
“You are mistaken,” Steve says.
“Bucky.”
“No need for apologies,” Sam says, waving his hand. “It is your own business, and I suppose you must have your reasons. I just thought that it was time you were aware that your secret identity was not so secret as you may have assumed.”
“He has a way with animals,” Mrs Romanoff says. “It’s why he makes such a good groom.”
“If you’re sure.” Sam lingers, then his expression of concern is marred by the yawn that splits his face.
anything.
It’s beautiful. If he had the breath he would let out a whoop of exhilaration, but all he can really do is beam in amazement at Stark, who smiles back, clearly amused by Steve’s reaction.
” He knows Bucky would be laughing at him right now, running scared from a number written on a piece of paper. Some brave captain he is.
“You’d better not be getting cold feet on me,” a female voice responds. “You knew the risks when we started this. It's steady work and the gentleman’s paying us handsomely for our troubles.”
“Then why would he not have introduced himself to me at once?” Steve says. “Fury and I have known each other for years. He knows that I am aware of the situation. It would make sense for us to pool our resources.”
“To hell and back, if necessary,” Steve tells him with a nod.
“Perfectly fine, he says, do you hear him, Philip? When his coats do not fit right.”
“That too, but that isn’t what I meant,” Penelope says. “I meant that he is the most incorrigible flirt.” Steve clears his throat.
“Theft is a serious crime,” Steve points out.
“I hope that’s true,” she replies, then she takes another step forwards, looking up into his face with eyes that are too like her brother’s. “Don’t be a stranger.”
The library has become a friend in his insomnia. It is filled with books of all sorts.
Hydra is back.
“It’s still treason,”
Steve looks at Sir Anthony, but he seems to have no protestations.
“Captain Rogers,” Sir Anthony repeats, more sharply. “Mr Jarvis said you had a business matter to discuss. As you can see, I am rather busy at present, so it might be best for both of us if you stated your case. There is no need to prolong what must be an unpleasant errand.”
The man looks between the pair of them, his eyes quick and scared.
“Would you like to check our small clothes?” Tony asks. “The lady’s petticoats? Just to check if we are hiding any gold in there? Doesn’t sound very comfortable to me.”
It creaks open a crack and he sees a dimly lit face, barely visible in the darkness. He opens his mouth to speak as a wave of dizziness comes over him and the darkness seems to expand. The world tilts and he feels himself falling forwards, then nothing.
“Someone is, but I’m not convinced it’s Stark,” she says.
“I am more than willing to speak ill of a man to his face if I believe he deserves it,” Steve says. “Believe me, it has got me into many scrapes, but you have been nothing but polite to me since my arrival. You have done far more for me than your father’s bequest could possibly have entailed. Whatever my opinions of your private life might be, it is your private life and as long as you do not harm anyone by it, it should remain private. It is not my business to pry into it.”
The man starts turning to him with a growl.
“Yes,” he says after a moment’s hesitation. “I shall go after lunch.”
Returning the items he has stolen is perhaps the most difficult part of the entire endeavour. Steve has almost been caught more times when returning goods than when stealing them, and that is no different at Stark Manor.
“I, Captain, am independently wealthy and have no interest in finding a second husband or wife. Love is not something I need, but you and I are cut from different cloth. If you change your mind, I know several young people who I believe would be good matches for you.”
The message is clear, but Steve forces himself to smile even as he bristles. For all he has heard of Sir Anthony, he cannot believe he turns his back on his friends so easily.
“It is a good story.”
organised them. All the people that were hurt, all the people who were robbed - of money, of life, of loved ones - that was Hydra.
The ceiling crumbles down, crashing in chunks and lumps of rubble, but the desk, built to hold a dozen or more heavy computers, holds steady. The whining noise grows louder and then there is a bright blue light as one of the Hydra guards fires his weapon, followed by an almost familiar sound as white light flashes back.
He had thought there would be relief at having uncovered the truth, but all there is is grief.
“Them?” Sam stops and blinks, looking over to the bag and then back at Steve.
Bridge is not really Steve’s game, at least when you are not in the sort of company that accepts cheating. Card games with the Howlies had usually degenerated into unscrupulous battles of sleight of hand. But there is strategy involved and Steve manages to acquit himself adequately. It helps that his partner is an accomplished player. Of course, the cards aren’t the real star of the evening. As Steve is learning, these activities are all just window dressing for the gossip that goes on.
“Then of course, you must go,” Steve agrees. “I am sorry to have kept you playing. But time seems to have flown past.”
“You know,” Sam says finally. “You are a great advantage to my ego.”
“Not in my experience,” he says. “That is, I haven't up to this point,” he corrects. Bucky and Sam’s words are echoing in his head. He knows what it is to be rejected and Sam is right, it is just a dance. “I do not believe I have had the pleasure of making your acquaintance.”
“Clint,” Mrs Romanoff says.
“You should go to see it, and to pass on your condolences to his widow and the new baronet,” Sam says.
“Steve,” Sam says, leaning back in his chair, his eyebrows raised as he gives a slight smile. “Please don’t take this the wrong way, but I suspect your… flair for the dramatic, may not be what a spy master looks for in his spies.”
“You still do not seem to understand that you are not that same captain who lived in a boarding house in Brooklyn. Captain Wilson, will you tell him that every fine gentleman must have a carriage. What are you intending to do should you find some lady or gentleman you wish to take on a drive? Will you hoist them up and fling them over the saddle? You cannot possibly have a lord or lady riding around everywhere on a horse.”
Steve sighs because Sam has outplayed him and he knows it.
“How much?” he says, his mind blank. The number he is quoted has far too many zeroes. The ticking of the grandfather clock counts out the hollow silence as the figure sits in his mind – and then sits on paper before him as well when Mr Murdock pushes a piece of paper over to him.
“Doesn’t really help,” he says.
“I’ll think about it,” Steve says. “But I should really be going now. You know how it is.”
Perhaps the answers will be more forthcoming in the morning. Tonight, Steve cannot make heads nor tails of it.
Steve tarries on his way to the door, holding out to hear a few more bars.
“Is he unwell?”
“You seem to delight in mocking me, Sir Anthony,” Steve says, striding quickly away from the window. Tony’s face falls.
“That hardly narrows it down,” Sam points out. Steve slams his fist down on the table in frustration and it cracks under the force, their tankards and the candlestick all jumping.
“I know you guys have a whole motto about ‘cut off one head’ and all that,” Iron Man is saying, “but seriously, do you just clone yourselves? Where are you all
” Bucky’s voice insists from his memory. It's a conversation they'd had a thousand times. “
“How so?”
of paper meeting paper overly loud in the grave stillness of the room. The clock still ticks behind him, marching on unstoppably. Steve’s heart is pounding in his chest, his shoulders tight, he is poised -
“You have done all you can,” Sam says. “We will send this to the relevant authorities and they will do what is necessary. You need have no further part in this.”
Steve takes a step forwards and the floorboard creaks beneath him.
“Mother always says that whoever he does marry in the end will want for nothing but a husband,” Penelope says before making her bid. The comment earns her a daring giggle from Mr Moore on her left.
“Fine, thank you,” Steve assures him. “I… really should be going. Thank you for your time and… for looking after things for me.”
“I…” Steve says. He heaves in a breath and starts again, forcing his fingers to relax as he does so. The paper crackles as the pressure is relaxed and he offers it to Sam, who steps forwards to read it, his brow wrinkling.
“Going home to see the family?” Captain Wilson asks.
He loops back around, behind where the militia are searching. If they were his men, he’d have a thing or two to say about their lack of attention to detail, but from this side of the law, he can only find himself grateful for their incompetence. If any of his own men had been hunting for him, he would have long since been shot.
Sir Anthony’s voice is not unexpected - although Steve couldn’t say why he was anticipating it - but he does not welcome the intrusion.
It is not signed. There is no person in this country, he is sure, who would be foolish enough to sign their name to treason. But the handwriting is unmistakable. He has seen it dozens of times.
“I know their voices, and it's possible I should know the treason if I should see it. You cannot wish to do nothing.”
“Like what?”
“No, nothing. Just that it sounded like a man and a woman and that they work for a gentleman. They mentioned Hydra - but... ” He shakes his head.
“There must have been a mistake,” he says. His voice sounds far away over the rushing in his ears.
“My pleasure, Captain,” Stane says, returning the nod. “You are, of course, welcome at any time, but it may help to send word ahead next time - to make sure Tony is in a proper state to receive you.”
“You would never do something so reckless,” Sir Anthony concludes. It is not the words he wanted to say, Steve can tell. It feels like there is more meaning there, though, something that Steve cannot parse.
He finds Sam and allows the conversation to surround him in a mass of words and murmurs that fade into each other. Luckily, he is not expected to provide much conversation, just agree or laugh at the appropriate moments.
He does not go directly home. He leads any pursuers - Barton or otherwise - on a merry chase all around the woods, taking the paths he has found while playing at being Nomad, until he feels satisfied that any chasers will be thoroughly confused and even more thoroughly lost, then he turns Liberty back towards Lakefield and rides home.
If Steve ever was a friend, and not just a passing fancy.
“So now, as far as he’s concerned, you think him a libertine and you do not care about him at all,” Sam says.
“I thought you were going to shoot me,” Steve says from behind the ornamental urn.
“Instead you’re stuck in there,” Steve says. If this is Zola, then what he’s talking about is straight out of science fiction. But… he’s seen impossible things before. There’s an actual Norse god who lives in New York. If it isn’t Zola, then… well, they’re definitely not the good guy.
“Then I suppose you’d better call me Sam,” Captain Wilson tells him, standing up straight again and giving Steve a grin.
He and SIr Anthony both turn and Mr Stane’s voice comes booming down to them.
“Thank you for the offer, but no. I feel this is best done in private.” He draws a steadying breath.
It is neither Sir Anthony, not Mr Jarvis, but Mr Stane instead and Steve has to smother the irritation he feels at the man’s presence.
“Don’t look at me,” Sam says, holding up a hand. “I’m with him.” He gestures at Steve.
“So you do not believe he is part of this conspiracy,” Steve says, frowning. “It seems unlikely that the two are not connected.”
“Sam-”
“Diamonds have their place,” Tony says, “But I’ve never found as much inspiration in a diamond as I get from looking at the raw untamed majesty of a mountain, and that’s mostly granite.” He sneaks Colonel Rhodes a grin. “A good landscape is hard to beat.” His eyes slide over to Steve, then quickly away.
In spite of Steve, they manage to get the house up and running and Steve finds himself the master of a comfortable home and in unexpected possession of several acres of land.
“It was straight out of a romantic novel,” Sam says. “Don’t worry. Your taste in literature is nothing to be ashamed of, my friend. Nor is your taste in men. I cannot say you do not set your sights high.”
It is not only the housekeeper, but also Rick, the valet, Delilah the maid, and a handful of other servants, who all seem to have separate, but very important jobs that Steve has never really considered before.
“Go to bed, Sam,” Steve says. “I’ll just read a book, that’s all.”
“I know you like your fun,” Stane says, “but remember your guests. We wouldn’t want anyone to… well, it’s important that your behaviour be above reproach, now. You are no longer the prodigal son, you’re a baronet and it’s important that you act like it. Think of what your parents would want.”
They refuse his money. Bucky had won his own small fortune, it seems, which goes to the family as he had neither wife nor child. The conversation passes in fits and starts, awkward pauses and stuttering words that seem to trip over themselves.
For the purposes of subterfuge, Steve has been using his home-grown accent for his highway robbery. They had trained it out of him in the army, when they dragged him in front of dukes and fine ladies, but it rolls back over his tongue in the familiar fashion of an affectionate cat.
“You think Stane is trying to frame Sir Anthony,” Sam says.
After a few seconds of holding still, nothing happens, so he starts to move again, but the feeling still lingers. Someone is watching him. He looks up to the windows of the house, but there is no sign of a face looking back at him. He can’t decide if he’s being foolish, this could just be because it is the baronet’s house he is approaching and this has already gone awry for him once, or whether his instincts are correct.
“No,” Mrs Romanoff says. “It would not.”
“Only you could make nobility from my selfish wishes,” Sir Anthony says. “I am not struggling with what is right, but with my own wants. You would give me noble purpose.”
.” Steve pulls back and frowns, because Bucky is not real. He knows Bucky is dead and this is his imagination, his own mind punishing him. But if this is his imagination, then why is Bucky implying that-
Steve looks up at the two guys next to him, who seem to be waiting for something.
“So far he’s developed a metal light enough for an airship to move at speed without losing protection and a propulsion system that makes our airships the envy of the world - I have no idea what he’s working on now, but I want to find out, sooner rather than later. He’s saved the lives of half the sky forces one way or another.”
“We have the proof,” Steve tells him, standing up. “We shall send it to Fury in the morning.”
He also, six years ago, posted a reasoned and completely comprehensive explanation of his theory that Iron Man - Avenger and superhero, is in fact Tony Stark. Somehow, that’s always the thing people remember. And now he’s a meme.
. How long have these people been here?
“You,” he says. “You meant that literally. Of course you did. I would be honoured.”
Steve is not sure when Howard had Stark Manor built. Had Tony grown up there, was this very house where he had spent his childhood years? What must it feel like to walk through your childhood home as a guest to a near stranger, passing through memories only you were aware of.
“Yes,” Steve agrees. “That would be easier.” He draws a deep breath. “I wish to apologise for any offence I may have given you yesterday. I did not intend any-” Sir Anthony holds up a hand to interrupt him. “Please allow me to finish. I have been given to understand that my phrasing may have conveyed unintended meaning when what I wished to say was quite the opposite of what you may have understood.”
Steve has heard the story. Howard was always fond of talking about himself, and the story of how he’d heard his wife playing and been puzzled as to how he could ask her to dance and also listen to her play had been one of his favourites. Steve does not know how to address it now, though. At the time, he had laughed along with the others as Howard had described his dilemma, but now his throat seems a bit too dry to talk.
“Thank the higher powers, or you’d be lying bleeding somewhere in the woods,” Sam says. “But you’re sure it was them.”
“If you were, then I would not be here,” Sir Anthony replies, then he pauses with a sigh. “Captain Rogers, you are a good man, but you are now a man of consequence and it is no great secret that all of this-” Sir Anthony spreads his hands wide - “is new to you. Allow me to make it easier, please. Clothes that fit you properly will make the world of difference, both in how the world sees you and how you see yourself.”
The crash as whatever it is hits the ceiling is almighty, ringing in his ears. The whole room shakes with it, and Steve curls up as tight as he can, waiting for the impact.
“What’s that- ?” he starts, then his eyes widen and he looks at Steve, who shifts a little uncomfortably under his gaze. The salute Barton gives then is almost smart, and Steve thinks the man definitely served in the army for some time, although it's too slapdash for him to have been a dedicated soldier. Steve tries to smile at him.
“In society, the right clothes are as important as the right uniform is in the army,” Sir Anthony says. “Not to mention I am holding a dinner in a few weeks, and I insist that you be properly attired for it.”
“Mr Stane,” he says, convincing his mouth to form the words against its preference.
“I believe we have established that.”
And to disguise himself?
“Don't feel that you must keep me company,” Steve says, giving Sam a tight smile. “I’ll be fine by myself. There are just as many people looking at you.”
It is not his place to interfere in Tony’s business. Although, as a friend he feels his concern is allowable. But Tony is an intelligent man, clearly gifted with social graces, and he has known Mr Stane for many years, there can be no cause for concern there.
“Good, good. You’ll be wanting to get back to it, I daresay. I know what you’re like. I didn’t mean to interrupt. Captain Rogers, shall we leave the genius to his work changing the world?”
“But they did give it up,” Barton points out.
“Perhaps I could have your honesty then, as you will not take mine,” and he turns to the picture he was painting. “I feel like the perspective is all wrong, and I have not done any justice to the gardens. What is your opinion on the matter?”
Steve sits with his back to the wall, unable to get comfortable with himself exposed to the other patrons, but he doesn’t pay much attention to them on the whole, which he comes to regret.
The night is almost over. He can see the first signs of sunrise on the horizon and the last of the stars shining softly in the lingering dark of the night. The world is spread out below them and the wind is in his face.
“Here you go, Tony,” Mr Stane says, and Sir Anthony takes the drink unthinkingly. Obadiah leans in a bit closer, a heavy hand coming up to rest on Sir Anthony’s shoulder as his voice lowers to an unctuous whisper. “You cannot monopolise the good captain’s time; he is much in demand and you have other guests to greet.” Sir Anthony nods and grimaces slightly, though the expression is gone in a moment and replaced by the bright, fake smile he often puts on in public. “Captain, we have a bridge party in the other room desperately in need of a fourth. Do you play?” His hand slips to Steve’s elbow and Steve pulls away instinctively.
“I do not believe you could be a more severe critic of my work than I am myself,” Steve says. “My sketches are in the music room, shall we?” He gestures to the door.
“But how?” Sam asks, looking back up from the crack. “You didn’t overhear what they’re transporting, or how. It could be anything.”
Brooklyn is not as Steve remembers it, and yet it is. Everything is where he left it, from the shoe shine on the corner to the razor he left by his wash basin. Of course, there is a thick layer of dust over it all. He should have thought to put down dust sheets.
“Then I suppose I could continue,” Sir Anthony says, spinning back round to the keyboard, with little decorum. He seems to be made of movement, and his fingers reach out to touch the keys again. “I used to play this with my mother,” he says. Sir Anthony’s fingers begin to dance up and down the keys, making the instrument sing in earnest. He is not as caught up in it as he had been, his back is stiffer, clearly aware of the audience, but the music does not seem to suffer in the least.
Zola’s face switches to another screen. The guards don’t even flinch. Steve feels like he’s a kid again, shouting down bullies in back alleys. They had just laughed at him. He feels that impotence all over again. The anger bubbling inside him with nowhere to go. He can’t
No, that thought is uncharitable. Sir Anthony is a generous host, and it is not as if he is lacking in space. Of course he would invite everyone.
The wound is serious. In an ordinary person, it would have been debilitating. Steve can only thank God for the process that led to his current condition. Without the serum, he would definitely have lost his life tonight. As it is, that is only a possibility. He can feel the warmth of blood dripping down his back, sticking fabric to him, and the searing pain of the hole. He can even, in a strange way, feel the ball inside him. He needs to get it out. If he heals with it still inside him, he doubts it will lead to anything good.
He feels like the world is removed from him, like a window stands between him and it. The letter sits in his hand and the words are still there, but the knowledge of it is far away from him.
“It doesn’t matter,” Steve says, pushing himself upright. “The question would be impertinent.”
Steve pulls some more energy from his body and forces his hand into the pocket he’d seen the man slip his phone into earlier, right after Steve had hit record. His fingers close around hard glass and he pulls it out, hoping desperately that-
“Yes,” Steve says.
Right. Yes. He has the mission. Sir Anthony is something he can worry about later. Steve forces the encounter to the back of his mind and returns to examining the lay of the land.
And then there’s a noise. A strange almost hiss almost click that takes him back to when he was a kid and the TV used to come on. Steve turns to look and one of the screens has lit up. The graphics are terrible, scratchy and pixellated, but it’s clear what he’s seeing. A face. A face he’d seen in one of those Hydra files.
“I would hope that there are some honest men out there,” Steve says. “If there are not, then…”
“Fury.”
Once on the road, he does not hold back. Liberty’s hooves echo his heartbeat, which seems to be leaping out of his chest at the sheer joy of it all. The howl of the wind past his ears drowns out his brain as he thunders on.
” Steve closes his eyes and rests his head against the nearby tree. “
The groom takes his horse with an easy grin and a slightly impudent tip of his cap, then Steve mounts the steps to the main door where he is greeted, as always, by Mr Jarvis, the butler.
There has to be something. There is always a way. If he’s the only person in the world who knows about this, he has to find the way.
“Or conveying a message,” Steve agrees. “They said it was steady work, so it sounds more long-term than immediate.”
“I don’t see why not,” Sam smiles at him. “You're a gentleman of standing now. An eligible gentleman at that. You can’t return to your boarding rooms and hide away from the world. My grandmother wouldn't hear of it, and she is a very determined woman when she gets a thought into her head.”
The knock at the door startles him and Sam’s voice can be heard through the wood.
As Ms Van Dyne had said, there is a certain romantic adventure to the highwayman. They are a figure of mystery and Steve could make it work. He would not really steal anything, it could be returned or left where the relevant people would find it, and he can search for the traitors and discover what it is they are transporting… and even who they are working on behalf of.
“The man wrote messages in his own hand,” Sam adds.
Steve crawls over to the guard’s body and starts to rifle through it, concentrating on keeping his breathing as even as possible. He needs to relax, forget the guys with vaporising guns shooting at him. Forget the Nazi conspiracy he’s just found. Forget that Iron Man is standing less than a metre away. Just breathe - and find the key.
“You’re not getting my wedding ring,” she says. “Or my husband’s.”
“What was the business you wished to discuss?” Steve asks and she looks at him with a sly smile.
“You are probably right,” she allows. “Although I maintain it would have made the trip a good deal less dull.”
