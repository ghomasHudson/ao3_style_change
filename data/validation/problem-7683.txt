Future Steve entered the elevator and told them he was taking point on the scepter. Rumlow and Sitwell, who were clearly in charge of the group, both declined until Steve leaned over to Sitwell and whispered, “Hail Hydra.” Shock and pleasure crossed the faces of Rumlow and Sitwell as they handed the scepter over. Steve, on the other hand, remained straight-faced until he left the elevator with the scepter, at which point he smiled.
“I can count on one hand the number of people who really saw me.” Steve paused to look her up and down. “I suspect maybe you know a little of what that’s like. My mother worked herself to death trying to keep me alive after my father died. She took the jobs and shifts no one else wanted to keep food on the table and enough medicine to try and fix what was wrong with me. She did her best, but she wouldn’t’ve managed it without Bucky. While she was killing herself on the job, Bucky was pulling me outta fights I couldn’t win. Everybody loved Bucky. Clint wasn’t wrong when he said Bucky was pretty, though Buck might’ve objected to the word. He was tough and smart and handsome and charming. The dames loved him and the guys wanted to be him, hoping some of that magic might wear off, just a little. And he dragged me right along with him. Every date he went on, he got her to bring a friend so we could double. Every bully I picked a fight with, Bucky fought with, too. Right up to and including the Red Skull. The day I really became Captain America is the day I decided to go behind enemy lines, against orders, to rescue him when he was probably already dead. Howard Stark flew me over, and I jumped out of a plane that was being shot at and went up to a Hydra base armed with nothing but a prop shield to save him. It was crazy. I figured I might die. But for Bucky, I was willing to leave it all on the field, because I knew he woulda for me. I found him laying on a table where Zola had been experimenting on him or torturing him, I don't know which, mumbling his name, rank, and serial number over and over again. When we got back to camp, he followed me, same as always, hauling me outta trouble. He fell off a train in the mountains on a mission. After the serum, I thought that wouldn't happen anymore. Being too slow or too weak. But it did. All the times he saved me, and when I could finally keep up, I couldn't save him."
Tony, who seemed much more relaxed than yesterday, blew a raspberry at him. "Fine. Keep your secrets. So, the upshot is that we need to be a team, trust each other, so what, we have slumber parties? Paint each others' toenails?"
“Well I actually had an idea about that,” Tony responded. “I know I don’t generally play all that well with other people,” his eyes flickered over to Natasha almost too quickly to see, “but I think we have to commit to the team. It seems like things in the future get pretty shitty, considering my future self was willing to pull the pin on my arc reactor to get the tesseract. Maybe Cap’s right and we didn’t become a team fast enough. Bruce, I think you should skip globetrotting for a while and stay here in the tower. Come play in R & D, big guy. It’ll be the best time you ever had with your clothes on.” Bruce blushed and looked at the ceiling. “Thor, you can obviously stay here, since you don’t really have a home base on this planet. Jane, too, if you want. We’ll set her up with her own lab. Least I can do after you jolted me back to life. Then we have all our meetings here. Cap can go to Fury and tell him that I’d rather not meet at SHIELD headquarters. He’d buy that I’m petty enough not to want to go and diva enough to make Cap ask. I’ll take a little break from Malibu; Pepper can hold down the fort there – she goes back in a week or so. I can even get a gym and training center set up here. And Cap wants to have movie nights.” He turned to Steve with a smirk.
Before he could respond, Tony interjected, "You know, the new suit wasn't just a gimmick to get you guys over here. I actually do build things. Cap, wanna check it out, or do you have to get back before curfew?"
“Better you than me.”
This starts immediately after Steve’s fight with future!Steve in Endgame.
A couple of weeks after his chat with Rumlow, Steve was drawing in Tony’s lab (and if he was drawing Tony again, well no one needed to know) when he got a text from Natasha.
As soon as Steve walked in, Clint and Natasha behind him, Tony started to talk. “Look, I know what you’re thinking, but – ”
Tony scoffed, and under his breath said “No, she wears a veil and tiara every Sunday. Do you think we could get him out of here?”
“I’d like to be involved in your illustrious organization. Learn a little more about your plans. Who your assets are. That sort of thing. I’ve gotta tell you, I’ve found that a lot about the future is… let’s say in need of reorganization.” Pierce didn’t have to know that Steve really meant the government who let people be homeless and go without healthcare or decent working conditions or basic human rights. He heard Natasha’s voice in his head.
Eventually, his solitude was disrupted when Natasha came and knocked on his door. “Fury would like to speak with you,” she said with no preamble.
Clint cut off his thoughts anyway. "More importantly, who's the soldier?" He gestured at the only other personal item in the apartment: Bucky's photograph.
"Think you and I can break into a quinjet without Nat and Clint's help?"
“My question is where we do we go from here?” Natasha asked. “Clint, Steve, and I are going to be running missions for SHIELD,” Steve’s head popped up at that; it was news to him. Natasha continued without pause, though he doubted his response went unnoticed, “Tony spends half his time in Malibu, Bruce travels all over the world, and Thor doesn’t even live on this planet. How are we even supposed to spend enough time together to become a team?”
Steve chuckled and Tony looked up from where he was working. He didn’t speak, but raised one eyebrow at Steve, who relayed the text messages. “Well, it’s nice that the spy twins are having fun. When will you leave for DC?”
To anyone who has trouble keeping track, this chapter covers from a few weeks after The Avengers (May 2012) to a couple of months after Iron Man 3 (December 2012).
“I do not have a record of Loki leaving with the scepter. The scepter was removed by a man who matches the existing data on Captain Steven Grant Rogers. He then returned a short time later and replaced the scepter.”
“Well, you just solved the mystery of what’s happening off the coast. That must be where they’ll have Pepper. We also have to deal with the President. He’s on Air Force One, which should be in the airspace just above us, with somebody else dressed in my War Machine armor,” Rhodey sounded very disgruntled. “The Vice President said that he’d talk to security, but baseline human agents aren’t going to be any match for a guy with Extremis inside my armor.”
"I could probably make some time for you in my extremely busy schedule. Let's go. See you tomorrow, Nat."
” Tony suggested with a smirk, “but it might be too much for your ‘40s sensibilities.”
each other. From here on out, this team comes first. And Bruce, at some later point in time, I’d appreciate it if you could fill me in on these companies who try to cheat honest workers out of benefits.” Clint snickered, but Steve ignored him. “Now, Tony, what did Fury want you to make?”
“‘If you're afraid of getting a rotten apple, don't go to the barrel. Get it off the tree.’ I need people I can trust, Sam.”
“Here’s a little holiday greeting I’ve been wanting to send to the Mandarin. I just didn’t know how to phrase it until now. My name is Tony Stark and I’m not afraid of you. I know you’re a coward. So I’ve decided that you just died, pal. I’m gonna come get the body. There’s no politics here, just good old-fashioned revenge. There’s no Pentagon, it’s just you and me. On the off chance that you’re a man, you can find me in the tallest tower in New York. It’s got a great big A on it. Pretty easy to spot. I’ll leave the door unlocked.”
He shook his head. “The point is, a baseline human couldn’t’ve made it. Someone with the serum, though, they would’ve had a chance. The only place he coulda gotten it was Zola. And that’s also reason enough for SHIELD to want to work with him. Although I can’t believe Peggy would’ve been on board.”
"Ahh, they've decided to have Captain America try to wrangle Iron Man since they couldn't manage it?"
Phil is alive. Woo! He did die during the Battle of New York but was brought back to life by some crazy alien shit that Fury did (which he doesn't find out until later; he thinks he was dead for like 9 seconds). He now heads a team of people who make up the “Welcome Wagon” – they seek out new powered people, introduce them to SHIELD, help them adjust. His team is made up of Melinda May (played by Ming-Na Wen, she’s the most amazing bad-ass woman ever), Grant Ward, Jemma Simmons, Leopold Fitz, and Skye, at least in the beginning. May and Ward are the field agents, Simmons is the biochemist/biologist/other life sciences, Fitz is the engineer/weapons specialist, and Skye is a hacker that Phil recruited from outside SHIELD. May and Coulson have worked together for a long time and are really close. She was actually asked to watch Phil by Fury because all the other people who received the crazy alien treatment lost their minds, but she only did it because she and Phil are so close. Fitz and Simmons (collectively referred to as Fitz-Simmons) are extremely tight – they’ve been best friends since the academy, he’s in love with her, and eventually, they end up together. Skye adores Phil. When they meet, she doesn’t know who her parents are, she was bounced around the foster system and has no real family, and she definitely ends up seeing Phil as a father-figure. Ward is Hydra. He was initially recruited as a teenager (after suffering abuse from his parents and older brother for his whole childhood and then trying to kill his brother by lighting their house on fire) by John Garrett, who is also Hydra. Unlike a lot of Hydra members, Ward is not loyal to Hydra; he’s loyal to Garrett. It’s extremely traumatic for the whole team – he tries to kill Fitz and Simmons and ends up giving Fitz brain damage. He falls in love with Skye and tries to convince her to join him in Hydra. She tries to kill him. He continues to love her, and eventually, after Garrett dies during the war between SHIELD and Hydra, he ends up a prisoner of SHIELD; he agrees to give Skye information on Hydra to regain her trust. He doesn’t care about SHIELD or Hydra – just her. After the team loses Ward to Hydra, they gain Antoine “Trip” Triplett, grandson of Gabe Jones. When Trip was first introduced on the show, his commanding officer was John Garrett, but he wasn’t recruited by Garrett, and he’s not Hydra. Eventually, they get some new team members, including Bobbi Morse. In the show/MCU, her relationship to Clint is never mentioned, but they’re married in the comics (616), so I kept that. In AoS, she’s got another ex-husband, Lance Hunter, who also ends up joining the team. He’s a former mercenary but joins SHIELD after the other members of his team die on an op with SHIELD. They also gain Alphonso “Mac” Mackensie, an engineer who takes over/helps after Fitz is injured in the fight with Ward. Phew. I think that’s most of the background, but hopefully, the story stands on its own.
“I didn’t think you’d send out a distress call to watch a movie,” Clint commented, collapsing into an armchair.
Trip led the way out to the back porch. “Gotta say, I’m a little nervous about what kind of shop Captain America wants to talk with me. Is this the real reason you came?”
Pierce glanced at his watch. “This has been lovely, Captain, but I’m afraid I have other engagements to attend to. I have time for a quick toast to our new partnership, but then I really must run.” When Pierce turned to pour drinks, Steve seized the opportunity to plant one of Tony’s bugs under the desk and slip Tony’s (what seemed like magical) transmitter into a slot in the computer under the desk. He was thankful for all the times Tony had drilled him on the move, because he was able to finish it despite the fact that he couldn’t hear much beyond the pounding in his ears. When Pierce turned back, Steve was standing and ready to accept the whiskey. “What shall we drink to, Captain?”
Tony gave a little half-smile, but it didn’t hold. Tony seemed to hesitate. “Recruiting me wouldn’t be the smart move. At least not overtly. Look, we haven’t talked about my life before Iron Man – and this isn’t an invitation to start – but I’ve been thinking about what Romanoff said about Hydra recruiting vulnerable baby agents. It’s possible that I might’ve been what could appear to be vulnerable to the casual observer.” Steve was confused by the new avenue of conversation, but he just waited for him to continue. He knew he could outlast Tony. He wasn’t always patient, but sometimes stubborn substituted for patient pretty well. “Howard was, let’s just say not father of the year. I was a little kid who desperately wanted daddy to love him, and when Howard didn’t fill the void, Stane stepped in. Until he literally tried to kill me, I pretty much did whatever he asked me to. I designed lots of weapons because I bought into Stane’s lie that I was keeping US soldiers safe, but what they actually did was kill US soldiers. I was too busy drinking and fucking to pay that much attention. If Stane had been Hydra and hadn’t gotten tired of living in the shadows, he could’ve gotten a lot of mileage out of me.”
He heard the man mutter "Yeah, on my left, I got it." He chuckled at the man's frustration and, when he passed him again, let himself call out, "On your left," a third time. This time the man's frustration hit boiling point and he started to sprint instead of jogging. He was no match for Steve's speed, and fell back to his usual pace a few seconds later.
He could feel his skills improving as they worked, but he didn’t feel like he was making as much progress cracking the outer shell Natasha always kept in place. They rarely talked much during their actual sparring, and she usually declined to join him for any one-on-one activities.
With Steve’s lying capabilities solidifying, they changed their priority to fleshing out his backstory. Red Skull had indeed convinced him of the need for Hydra, but he wanted a more ordered Hydra. Red Skull was greedy; you could rule without demanding it – Steve had found leadership natural since the serum, and people followed him willingly. He didn’t like how Fury had lied to him when he was defrosted. He wasn’t sure if Fury was Hydra or not, but he wasn’t about to dance to Fury’s tune without more information – he wanted to be the one pulling all the strings. Still, he recognized that he wasn’t as familiar with the current political landscape. He wanted to work with the true leaders of Hydra. Natasha told him that he should confide in Pierce that his senses were more enhanced than people thought. “Make him feel that you trust him with something you haven’t even mentioned to Fury.”
“We will, Tony, I promise. Good news is that it looks like Thor and Jim saved the President. Must be something else happening there, though, or they would’ve checked in already. Now, where are your suits? I was promised backup.”
“Look, Steve, air clearing. You didn’t do anything wrong. I was hurt and took it out on you.”
Tony grinned. “That a serious question, Cap? No problem at all.”
Steve didn’t hesitate. “I’ll meet you at the Tower with Clint and Natasha in ten minutes. We’ll figure it out.”
“I think it’ll depend on whether or not Fury is dirty. If he’s clean, they probably won’t want Natasha or Clint. I’m guessing they think Bruce and Thor are too anti-government for Hydra. You… I’m not sure. I think they’ll probably think that recruiting you would be too big a risk, given how publicly you’ve gone after terrorists.” He shot Tony a wry grin as he recalled Tony calling out a terrorist on live television.
“How far back does JARVIS store recordings of what’s happening in the tower? I’d like to review everything our future selves did when they were here. It has audio, right?” Steve said.
?! The guy from the car accident is Tony Stark? What the hell, Nat?”
Steve was relieved. He’d had about enough of aliens for a while. “I’ll just watch both. It’s fine. Hey, Jim,” he said with a nod, receiving one in return. “Ma’am,” he said to Pepper, the palest of pink tinging his cheeks as he avoided eye contact with her. Tony narrowed his eyes and opened his mouth, probably to comment on the blush, but Steve cut him off. “Do either of you have any book or TV recommendations? I’m trying to catch up.”
“– Buchanan Barnes. I know who Bucky is, Captain.”
“That’s true. I didn’t need an extra reason to get decked. Do you think I should tell her?”
"Okay. I'll send you what we've got. Tony, do you think you could help me arrange transport of all my stuff? It would actually be great if you guys could keep an eye on it – and Darcy – while I'm dealing with… whatever this is."
Boy did Tony call it. “With all due respect, sir, I think that would be a huge mistake.” He watched as Pierce’s brows shot to the top of his forehead. Even though the whole bit had been Tony’s idea, Steve felt nauseous being the one to lay it all out for Pierce. “I’m not sure how much you know about Stark’s past, but he has a deep-seated need to think he’s a hero, and he wouldn’t recognize that Hydra makes the cut. He’s all about doing whatever he wants, consequences be damned. Order isn’t exactly his style. But that doesn’t mean we can’t get what we need from him. Do you know what Obadiah Stane’s biggest mistake was? He tried to kill Stark. Before that, Stark did pretty much whatever Stane asked him to. He designed weapons and led the company to huge profits, because Stane convinced him he was helping American soldiers. Saving them. As soon as Stane decided that he wanted Stark out of the picture, Stane ended up dead. You can’t back Tony Stark into a corner. I heard that he got a request from Fury for some arc-reactor-powered helicarriers. He turned it down, mostly because he likes to annoy Fury. I’m going to take a wild guess that that was really for Hydra? Give me, say 24 hours to work on Stark. Convince him to build the helicarriers.”
Bruce cleared his throat. "Jane, would it be alright if I looked over your data? I think it would be great if we could develop a way to track this kind of phenomenon. Especially if Loki is going to be on the other side of it."
"I don't know. All I can come up with is that Fury used this to motivate us, to make us a team. He must've known we wouldn't trust him if we found out he lied about this."
After a pause, Rhodey chimed in. “I don’t read a lot of fiction. I’m a big
After they’d both cleaned up (and Steve had put on his watch and applied the camera to his shirt), Steve and Rumlow headed out to a dingy bar (“I know a place, Cap. You’ll love it.”). Steve was mildly surprised when Rumlow knocked and said, “Hail Hydra,” to get them in. Steve thanked his lucky stars for Tony. Everywhere he turned was being recorded – they would be able to identify a lot of Hydra agents this way. Steve noticed that more than one of them paled as they realized who was walking through. He grinned, attempting to infuse some of how menacing Natasha always seemed when she smiled. He couldn’t tell if it worked or if they were just afraid of Captain America.
Steve caught on quickly. “You can’t mean Schmidt.”
“Ugh, never mind. Go back to staring blankly at Cap.”
Tony shot him a wide-eyed look but said nothing as he pulled up some holograms of what appeared to be a new suit for Steve. They talked through suit upgrades, fabrics, designs, what gear might be best for the rest of the team, and the time just slipped away. Eventually, Steve’s phone made a dinging sound, and he pulled it out of his pocket.
“Thanks, Tony. I don’t know how I would get through this without your help.”
The build up to this question took a lot longer than 24 hours, but as Steve looked across the table at Tony in the restaurant where they'd had their first date, Steve knew that asking Tony to marry him would take that first date's place as the best thing he ever asked for.
“JARVIS, do you happen to have any surveillance footage from when they were taken?” Immediately, video footage displayed on the wall. Steve, Bruce, and Thor watched as Pepper saw Killian, told Maya to run, and was grabbed. They also watched as Maya stepped up to Pepper and took her cell phone and threw it away.
It was Tony’s turn to frown. “You sure you can’t stay, Platypus? I’m sure we could convince Cap to let you join the superfriends team. Once we take all the Hammer trash off your suit, you’d be a good addition.”
Tony, on the other hand, grinned. “You ready for a tech tutorial without the training wheels, old man?” Steve nodded, still frowning at the phone. “You good for me to see the message you just got?” Steve nodded again, and Tony instantly made grabby hands at him. “Give it here, then. I’ll show you. Wait. Clint made you a
Steve frowned, confused. “They do that? Pay people part-time so they don’t have to give them benefits? And that’s what SHIELD is doing to Tony?”
Hydra Preparatory Academy is a real thing! At least according to the Agents of SHIELD show. And Sitwell actually went there.
"Yes. He’s the only one who calls her Pepper, of course.”
Tony took advantage of the silence and turned to Steve. “This happened last time you met Pepper, too. You get all stammery and blushy and weird. Why aren’t you scared of Natasha? She’s the one who could kill someone with a bobby pin. Don’t get me wrong, Pepper can be scary, but mostly only in the boardroom, which you can easily avoid. What’s the deal? Come on, cough it up.”
He signed her out at the desk pushed her in a wheelchair to a car out front paid for by Tony. When they got to the hotel, she raised one eyebrow at him. "So a secret adventure then, eh?"
As he walked back to his apartment, he spotted an art store and decided to take a look. He hadn’t really been driven to draw since he woke up, with the brief exception of his time in Tony’s lab, but the shop intrigued him. He couldn’t believe all the new kinds of equipment and techniques. Paints, chalk, charcoal, pencils. It was all a little overwhelming, and the staff here weren’t nearly as helpful as the librarians had been. In the end, he decided to stick with just a sketchbook and some drawing pencils, then come back after he’d done more research.
"Actually I was thinking movie nights." Tony and Natasha stared at him for a moment. "Look, we've done the whole forged in fire thing. More finely honed fighting skills will come with time. We need to get to know each other as people. I'd like us to start by bringing the rest of the team on this, but then, yeah. Movie nights. You guys pick your favorites to show Thor and me. We get dinner. Talk. Aside from Thor, none of you guys have really been on this kind of team. The bond that matters is formed off the battlefield. Then the battlefield reflects that. I know it's a lot to ask, but I'd also like help from both of you to find Bucky. I don't have any idea where to start. And if what Natasha says is true and he's been brainwashed into killing people, I don't know who I'll find at the end of my search."
There was pain there. “Yes. I’m sorry, but we’re sure. He’s Hydra, and he’s recruited several members.”
Jane seemed to hesitate. "Are you with SHIELD? They're fond of stealing my work."
He told her everything about his future self coming back, tricking SHIELD agents into thinking he was Hydra, the team wanting him to go undercover. " I don't know what I'm going to do. Okay, so say they buy that Red Skull turned me and that I magically figured out that Hydra was in SHIELD from one picture of Zola. How am I supposed to explain how I knew the STRIKE team was Hydra?"
“Steven. My boss is the CEO of SI. Who did you think her best friend named Tony was?” she rolled her eyes and hopped off the counter. “James, deal with him. I’m going to go take a bubble bath.”
"58th pararescue. Now I'm working down at the VA. Sam Wilson."
Steve followed him in, remembering everything Natasha had taught him about body language undercover. In the SHIELD halls, he maintained his usual posture, but when Pierce told him to take a seat, he let his body relax, slouching a little into the chair and crossing one leg up over the other knee. “I’ve been hoping to get to speak with you,” Steve said.
Steve wondered how many more times he could stand to be shocked like this before he really started to crack. “Boy, it’s been a hell of a day. Helicarriers, aliens, portals to outer space, me from the future, and now this. Alright. JARVIS, do you think you could tell me where Tony is? I think I’d like to start by talking to him.” There was a long enough pause that Steve opened his mouth to rescind his request, but then JARVIS responded.
“Yes, she’s on our list as well. You’re currently cleared to tell her and no one else.”
Clint laughed. “Nah, man. That’s just her way of bonding. As far as she knows, the great love of your life is Peggy Carter. That’s how all the stories go. The published ones, anyway. The conspiracy theory stories say that the great love of your life is Bucky Barnes.” He glanced at Steve out of the corner of his eye. “Anyway, it takes a lot to overcome that much prior information about a subject. Plus you’re used to hiding that you’re gay. I wouldn’t have picked it up. You never check anyone out.”
Steve dropped entered the tower kitchen to find the other Avengers (minus Thor) already there. Tony stopped his pacing, and Clint and Natasha looked up from where their legs were tangled together on the couch. Bruce, making himself some tea, was the only one who didn’t freeze immediately.
Natasha, wasn’t looking at them, but at the screen. “Future you is a much better fighter. You’re lucky he didn’t want to kill you. I believe now that we’re friends. There are some moves I don’t show just any trainee,” she smirked at him.
Steve realized what Tony was asking. "I had no idea. None. Even if I haven't proved that I'll tell you anything you want to know, you have to believe I wouldn't jeopardize our mission to get Hydra out of SHIELD. Coulson would be a huge asset."
“Come on Nat, what possible truth could I tell about being Hydra?”
Clint laughed outright at that. “Well I sure as hell can’t help you with the science side of Stark, but I can get you started on the rest of it. It’ll give me something to do when I’m not sleeping tonight.” Though he said it as if it were a joke, Steve could tell it wasn’t. Clint had to be reeling after being the puppet of a madman bent on total destruction. “The music part’ll be easy. You work out a lot, right? We can put some stuff on your phone for you to listen to at the gym. If you’re okay losing your phone for the night, I’ll load’er up for you.” Clint reached out a hand, and Steve handed over his phone. Clint blinked rapidly. “Um… no offense, Cap, but what the hell is this?” Steve immediately remembered Tony calling his phone a brick.
Steve blushed and groaned. “Come on, Tony. It wasn’t my idea. I talked to the hospital administrator and she had the kids vote. They thought it was funny.”
“Of course, JARVIS. Thank you.”
Tony smiled wider than he had since Steve had been home. “Well I’m glad you won’t be pining away. Let’s watch something fun.
Several hours later, Steve breathed a sigh of relief as he rode up the elevator of the tower. “JARVIS, could you please tell the team I’m back? Ask if they’ll meet me in the common room?”
“None of that’s your fault, Steve,” said Natasha, sounding softer than he’d ever heard her.
After they made it back to his apartment with their purchases, Natasha took charge. Clint seemed content to let her lead. Just before they left, she instructed him to set up Steve’s TV and told Steve to come help her rearrange the furniture in the bedroom. He didn’t see the point – they’d arranged it all already, but followed willingly enough. She surprised him by pushing him down into a chair  – which she wouldn’t have been able to do if he hadn’t already trained himself to regard her as a friend – and leaning so that she spoke directly into his ear. “Meet me for coffee at the cafe four blocks west of here tomorrow at 11 am. I need to talk to you.”
Steve frowned. “I don’t like the idea of lying to them. Clint might be used to the spy training methods, but Tony is sensitive to liars and Bruce is sensitive to spying.”
“I had to do a lot of rescheduling and rearranging last minute. Very last minute. As in a couple of hours before the wedding. And do you know why?” Steve and Bucky just looked at each other. “I got a call from her fiancee. Apparently she was in a car accident. And when I met her at the hospital, she and her idiot best friend told this fantastical story about a truck full of mysterious and beautiful firefighters who just happened to save them. ‘The most perfect blue-eyed adonis saved me, and I didn’t even get his last name.’ And when I asked if the adonis happened to be named Steve, her idiot best friend fell trying to leap out of the bed at me. ”
“You take that back!”
“Too busy. And she’s not really my type, Nat. Besides, we have no idea if she’s secretly Hydra.”
“He killed my parents.” Tony could feel himself crumbling.
Fury’s face betrayed no emotion. “And what exactly happened yesterday that makes me suddenly trustworthy?”
So the actual lyrics for this song aren’t really representative of this chapter, but I love the idea of Pierce being the Great King Rat. Since we’re meeting a new garbage character in this chapter, we’re also going to meet a new awesome character! Thank you so much to everyone who has commented. I appreciate the love more than I can tell you <3 I hope everyone is staying safe inside during this difficult time and that you’re all doing okay.
"According to JARVIS, DNA matches, and he's got Agent Melinda May on his team. He said that would mean something to you, but I also remember she's one of the people you said you were sure wasn't Hydra," said Steve.
All Tony said was, “J?”
but he wanted to read the books first. He’d also gotten
“... oh. Wow. Okay. Captain America is… gay? Bi? Wow. I wish 12-year-old me could hear this.”
“Can you think of a better name?”
“Alexander Pierce, in addition to being the Secretary of the World Security Council, is also the highest-ranking member of Hydra. Based on a visit from Steve and Tony from the future, we got a heads up. Steve is now undercover as Hydra. Pierce confirmed that you are not Hydra. That puts you squarely on our side.”
Hey all, this took a little longer than I wanted - I had a not so great mental health week last week, so writing took a back seat. But we’re back now! Also, I’m not so much a “plan things out in a detailed manner” kind of writer, so I don’t really know how long this is going to be. It’s only been like two days in-story, and we’re at the end of chapter 3. I think things are going to move a little faster after this, once we’ve gotten everyone sort of introduced and settled. I hope you enjoy it! Thanks to everyone who has commented/kudos’d – I really appreciate the encouragement!
Tony suited up and blasted off, leaving Steve alone with Thor and Bruce. He called SHIELD, talked to a few different people who were no help at all, then settled in with Thor to wait for Natasha and Clint’s report while Bruce worked with JARVIS to analyze some of the data from the Mandarin’s explosions.
Tony frowned. "Spy 1 and 2, don't you have things to do?"
Over the next few months, Steve and Tony talked a lot about everything that happened, and Steve extracted Tony’s promise to always call him when things went sideways (“You have a team now, Tony. That’s what we’re here for.” “Yeah, yeah. Give it a rest, Rogers.”). They continued to spend time together, and Steve convinced Tony to spar with him in the gym in the tower. He still went to the SHIELD gym with Natasha, and he definitely learned more with her, but he much preferred the time spent with Tony.
Steve slept solidly that night, his body working overtime to heal the minor damage done to him during the fight. From the look of Clint, he hadn’t fared nearly so well. The store with the phones was a little overwhelming, but Steve picked things up pretty quickly. The more he saw, the more he realized SHIELD had been sheltering him and guiding what he could and couldn’t see. Before the battle, he’d hardly left his room except to go to the gym. He wondered if he would’ve done all this if he hadn’t had a visit from future him, then decided it wasn’t worth trying to figure out. He didn’t know much of anything about his future, and it would drive him to madness if he examined every move wondering whether or not it was the same. He bought a phone and a laptop, deciding he didn't need a tablet. He would see if Natasha would come out with him for other things he needed – it would be a good opportunity to try and feel her out one-on-one.
When they arrived, they heard Killian yelling at a man in the War Machine armor, his whole body starting to glow. “What do you MEAN you lost him? The President dying in a very public execution is crucial to the plan.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Phil smiled sadly. “It wasn’t my call. Fury said that you weren’t to know, even though your clearance is high enough. I wanted to tell you. Really, I did.”
“Yeah, we’ve ID’d everyone at the bar. We’re going to look into Rumlow’s SO, see who else they recruited, as well as that Hydra Prep school. And then we were trying to figure out what living Hydra members are older than you.” Tony leaned over to pat Steve’s shoulder as he spoke.
“Ah, I see you replaced the brick. With a StarkPhone! Good choice.” Tony seemed genuinely pleased that Steve had picked a StarkPhone.
The slightest hint of annoyance ran across Natasha’s face. "I thought you said trust went both ways, Rogers."
“Wow, that’s really good,” she said one afternoon, appearing over his shoulder to look at his drawing of Tony in the Iron Man suit.
They spent the next hour planning both the Hydra takedown and their infiltration of the Hydra base where Bucky was being kept. Eventually, Thor left to check on Jane, Rhodey went to pack, since he was leaving the next day, and Bruce went to check on an experiment he’d left running.
“Guys, we’re going to be there in 15 minutes. Any music at all is better than listening to the two of you,” Clint said wearily.
“He blew up Happy. In Malibu. Pepper just called and told me. He’s in the hospital. She’s with him now. I told them to put on
“Actually, Captain, I wanted your thoughts on the team. I hear you guys had a little get-to-know-you gathering. I’m curious how that went for you.” Fury leaned back in his chair with his hands folded in his lap.
“Honestly, not that great. Neither of us are recruiters for SHIELD, and we both tend to work mostly solo,” said Clint with a huff.
“Hail Hydra.”
Steve woke up the next morning with energy to burn, so he went for a run. He’d liked the Washington Monument when he was last in DC, so he decided to head back. The sun was just coming up when he saw another runner.
Clint walked out, leaving Tony to ponder what he’d said.
"I'll take you back now. Thanks for everything. You're the best, Peggy."
“Actually, you’re not. As a show of good faith, I’m going to introduce you to the Asset. Not in person of course. Via video feed.”
Steve dreamed of Bucky again, but this time, it was of the two of them at Coney Island. It was a nice change. When Clint arrived, he seemed a little uncomfortable, and Steve wondered if there was some kind of problem. He didn’t have long to wait.
Both Steve and Rhodey gradually relaxed as they ate pizza and chatted. Tony seemed happier than Steve had ever seen him. As Steve watched Tony do his best to shove Rhodey off the couch and onto the floor after Rhodey told one too many stories of Tony getting into scrapes at MIT, he wondered if this was what he and Bucky had looked like from the outside. As he left, he turned to Tony. “So I think maybe you and I have more in common than I thought.” Tony didn’t say anything; he just raised one eyebrow in question. “We’ve both spent most of our lives with a best friend named James who is constantly pulling us out of one scrape after another.” His lips quirked up in a half-smile, and he realized that he’d smiled more in the last two days than he had in the months since he’d woken from the ice, and that was including an alien invasion. “I’ll see you tomorrow with the rest of the team. I’ll bring Clint and Natasha. Do you know how to get in touch with Dr. Banner and Thor?”
“Indeed, Sir.”
"I wonder what he gets up to on his own. I hope he's not lonely," Steve mused out loud.
“Well, it just so happens that I might have some rooms ready that would be appropriate for you and the spy twins. You know. If you wanted.”
“But we could find out,” Natasha returned. “Pierce would know. You have to push forward.”
“You seem awfully put together for someone who just got into a high-speed crash on her wedding day,” Steve commented, unable to prevent a smile.
"Nice choice, Robin Hood. The quintessential ‘80s action flick. Load ‘er up. J, put in an order for food. Everyone make requests.”
“Hey, man, I never said pilot. You assumed.”
Steve blinked. Matched him. Not Loki. “Might as well, I suppose. Please, go ahead JARVIS.” A voice that sounded just like his rang out in the room.
Natasha continued to stare at him as though she were analyzing everything in him. "Call the rest of the team. We'll debrief tomorrow before Indian food and movie night. Let Clint pick the movie to make up for telling me first. Stark, I'll see you then." She paused. "Are you ready to go… Steve?"
“Nah, Nat can handle herself. Besides, if anyone’s licensed to give talks on her behalf, it’s not me. It’s Clint. You might have a slight disadvantage, though, seeing as how we’ll all be back in New York this time tomorrow.”
“Have you seen
They kissed for several more minutes until the door banged open. They sprang apart and looked over to see Rhodey staring at them. “Okay, seriously man? I did not need to see that. I just came back down to make sure you were okay, and this is the thanks I get. Also, I told you so.”
“You manned the EXO-7 Falcon. The Khalid Khandil mission.”
“See, now that I know it was a lie, I want to know what you dressed up as for Halloween.”
“You’d think spies would be more subtle,” Tony commented dryly.
Steve laughed out loud. "Neither. I noticed when we stole that jet to go to the battle that most junior SHIELD agents pretty much do what I tell them to. I just explained that I'm more comfortable with paper copies and asked them to let me into the file room. I figured I should do at least a little prep work for our coffee today."
“Stark is right,” Natasha chimed in.
Steve could tell Tony was getting agitated, so instead of arguing, he just said “Okay, Tony. I trust your judgment. Tell me what you’re working on.”
Tony cleared his throat, seeming mildly surprised by Steve’s enthusiasm and easy praise. “You can’t have come down here just to ogle my toys,” Tony prompted again.
“Wait, so if he’s really from the future, shouldn’t him telling you shit mess everything up?” Clint asked. “Wouldn’t he change things enough so that he never comes back? But then he wouldn’t tell you and things would go back. Now I’m confused.”
“Maybe you should call his mother,” Bruce suggested. “You can get a feel for the family, see how close she was to her father and how close this Agent Triplett was to his grandfather. Maybe pay a visit that coincidentally overlaps with his.”
Tony and Steve figure out what to do next.
He sighed. “I’ll think about dating.”
They entered the Tower; no one was around, but the elevator was waiting, and JARVIS greeted them. "Welcome, Captain. It is good to see you again. Please enter the elevator. It will take you to meet Mr. Stark." If Steve thought it was possible, he would've said that JARVIS's tone cooled. "Hello, Miss Romanoff. You may accompany Captain Rogers." Steve managed to keep a straight face, but he chuckled internally. It would seem that Tony's AI was awfully loyal.
Steve starts working with Natasha, but she's a tough nut to crack. This chapter also deals with the Mandarin, and Steve learns something interesting.
“Well, that’s a fair point. What about Sharon? We know she’s not Hydra.” He wrinkled his nose instinctively. “No, she’s related to Peggy. That’s a little creepy. But I know lots of women who aren’t SHIELD.”
“No one,” Natasha said.
Thor gave an indulgent smile. "Of course I will take it with me. They will be most entertained by your Midgardian technology." Clint barely controlled a snicker at the look on Tony's face.
Tony just blinked at him for a moment, his face as unguarded as Steve had ever seen it. "You knew Jarvis? Really? He pretty much raised me. Didn't mention you. Guess he figured Howard talked enough for both of them."
“Barton and Romanoff are loyal to him. They won’t switch sides, even for me. If Fury were in, they would almost certainly follow. I told you about Stark already. Banner is even less likely. He has less than zero trust in government authority. He’s only willing to stay with Stark because he believes that Stark can and will protect him from the government. Thor is off-world and probably won’t care much for the politics of earth. I’m afraid I’ll be your only powered person for a while.”
“So it should be both super soldier and old man proof, but let me know if you have any trouble figuring out how to put it on or anything.” Tony was a whirl of movement now, picking up and putting down various tools and projects. Steve decided that maybe both he and Tony could use a break from the intensity.
“Captain. It’s about time. It would be nice if I could reach you directly.”
“Nah. I mean probably, he’s a spy, so he’s suspicious of everything. But no more than anything else. He’ll either assume that you got fed up trying to learn the tech or that I SHIELD-proofed it because I didn’t want him spying on me.” Steve nodded. He was interested to learn how many people underestimated his brain. He’d thought that when he got the serum, people would stop underestimating him, but they just shifted their focus. Turns out, you couldn’t get rid of people’s preconceived notions about you.
“You are most welcome, Captain.”
“I don’t. I mean, I didn’t read your files. Or at least not the full thing. They gave me files on everyone, but mostly it was just skills and evaluations, no real history or detail. They, ah. They also showed me some… footage. Of you and Dr. Banner, mostly. They seemed to think it was important. I’m not sure why. The stuff they showed of you doesn’t really seem like you. Anyway, you don’t have to tell me anything you don’t want to. I can wait. Besides, he said I’m supposed to trust you and earn your trust in me. That’s where I’ll start. I’ll keep you posted on what I get from Romanoff. Should we set up a time to meet? Do we need an excuse? Damn, I’m terrible at subterfuge.”
“Of course we are, Tony. But for this to work, we –
The team tries to figure out what to do about Hydra and brings in outside help.
At that, Rhodey stopped staring at Steve and narrowed his eyes at Tony. “You want me to snap out of it? Fine. Did you go to the hospital? How much sleep did you get last night? Have you eaten anything today?”
“Not much.”
Bruce looked between Steve and Natasha. "Well, I'm certainly not going to tell Fury. And considering the fact that you already told Natasha, it seems that you trust her not to. To be honest, I'd rather stay as far away from SHIELD as I can.”
Tony told them that Pepper was back in California, but she’d asked him to pass on how pleased she was with the good PR that came from the team visiting hospitals, especially since Tony hadn’t let her publicize the money he’d poured into the relief efforts. Steve had spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to spend more time with Tony so they could maybe be closer friends. He finally found a winning tactic when he asked Tony if he could come to his lab and draw the suits; Tony agreed with the stipulation that he got to pick the music. Over the next several months, Steve ended up spending a lot of time there, and he watched as Tony went from a handful of working suits to dozens. He knew that Tony had a lot of time commitments, and he saw how long it took him to work on projects; there was no way Tony was sleeping through the night. But then, it wasn't like Steve always slept through the night, either.
Steve managed to snag Thor, Clint, and Natasha and talk them into eating with him in the SHIELD mess. Steve watched carefully as he ate, trying to see what he could learn about his new teammates. Thor was clearly disappointed that Loki had escaped, but he put on a good face, smiling warmly at them all. Clint and Natasha were both obviously exhausted, and even Steve was starting to feel the adrenaline wear off. He was interested to watch how casually the two of them shared space – her leg up on his chair, his head on her shoulder, no hesitation in touching each other. He missed that camaraderie and felt a sudden deep ache for Bucky.
Tony considered him for a moment. “You know, that’s not a bad idea, actually.”
Clint and Natasha exchanged a look. “There are some people in SHIELD that I’m absolutely sure of,” said Clint slowly, “but it’s hard to be absolutely sure of Fury. I do trust him. I do, but he keeps so many secrets. But then, some of the people I’m sure of are – or were – his most trusted people.”
“No, no, I’m fine, help Pepper first,” the man protested. Just then, her door opened.
They were all settled in on the various furniture when JARVIS informed them that Phil was requesting entrance.
“Who said that?”
As he got closer, they could hear him saying “I didn’t mean to. Is it really her wedding day?”
"Let me look into him, first, okay? We don't know how involved Jones was in his life. DNA doesn't necessarily determine who you are."
The whole team met in the common room a couple of days later when Tony asked for them. He didn’t wait for them to get settled before he started talking. “So Fury called. He’d like to call in the consultant. And by that I mean me. He wants me to build him stuff.”
Steve smiled in return and stepped back to wave her into the room. “I appreciate you making an exception.”
“Yeah, Tony Stark, and he doesn’t exactly observe personal boundaries, so they looked into a bunch of your sealed military records, and I thought you said you were a pilot.”
The team was silent just long enough to hear future Steve say, “That
Steve could hear Tony pause and parse his words as he watched Natasha silently raise one eyebrow at him. “Wow, you got to her this fast? Color me impressed, Cap. Guess batting those big blue eyes is more effective than I would’ve thought. Can’t wait for the story on that. Over and out, Rogers.”
“He’s going to make a move on Natasha?” Tony seemed a lot more confused than the situation warranted.
Tony looked around at everyone; they were all staring at him, except for Rhodey, who was staring at Steve. Tony rolled his eyes. “Oh my god. Stop with the dramatics. We’re fine. It’s fine. The Manchurian Candidate didn’t know what he was doing and Capsicle didn’t do anything wrong. I needed to process. I’ve processed and we’re all good here.”
“I am afraid not, Captain. JARVIS stands for ‘Just a Rather Very Intelligent System,’ although I believe this name was chosen to honor Edwin Jarvis after his death. I am an artificial intelligence created by Mr. Stark. I monitor Stark Tower at all times and assist Mr. Stark in any way I can.”
Fury nodded as though he’d expected as much. “We’ll be happy to set up some scheduled training for you and set aside time in the conference – ”
“We don’t need anything from Fury,” Tony corrected. “I’ve tapped into all of SHIELD’s records. Figured it would be faster. JARVIS, put together a list of teams that are not currently at a major SHIELD facility and are also led by Hydra.”
“Yes, I’d imagine he does. So what exactly are you looking for?”
“Yes, Dr. Banner. I have a recording from Aldrich Killian’s meeting with Miss Potts.”
"Well he may be an ass, but he's not an idiot," Tony piped in. "My trust in him was shaky at best, and this certainly didn't help. We deserved to know."
Over the next couple of weeks, Steve kept mostly to himself, although he did spend plenty of time at the SHIELD gym. He watched both versions of
Steve thought through Tony’s suggestions. He noticed that he, Clint, and Natasha were not invited to live in the tower and wondered whether that was because they already had living quarters or because Tony didn’t really want them there. He certainly had reason to distrust Natasha, and it was pretty obvious that she and Clint were a set. Steve knew he’d have his work cut out for him turning this group of six independent, stubborn, mistrustful people into a team. All this flitted through his head so quickly that there was no noticeable pause before he replied, “So Natasha suggested Indian food for dinner if that's okay with you all, and Clint was charged with picking a movie."
“Everyone sit back down. We need details before we can do anything about this. Tony, tell us what you know.”
She chuckled lightly and held out her hand. "I'm so glad you're here. We have so much to catch up on. It's been so long."
Steve could feel his throat tighten. “You know, they haven’t. And you’re the first person to ask.”
Steve cleared his throat. "Before I tell you any of this, I'd like your word that you won't tell SHIELD – not even Fury – and you won't discuss it anywhere other than this building. The reason why is part of the story, but I need your word first."
“I’m gonna need a couple more vowels, Vanna. I still have no idea what you’re talking about.”
There are a couple of lines here from Winter Soldier, but keep in mind that this is actually about a year before the events of Winter Soldier take place (actually during the time period of Thor: the Dark World).
“Look,” Clint interjected before Rhodey could answer, “I get it. I even like
“Shar-Bear is SHIELD? Why didn’t I know that?”
“Well, Nat, what’s the verdict? How did I do? And can I please never do it again?”
“Keep it simple, Cap. I’ll give you a call in a day or two and tell you I’ve been working on some outfit upgrades. The one you’re wearing is clearly tapped out. I’ll come up with something for some of the others, too. Wouldn’t want them to be jealous. Now – ”
Tony hugged her and told her he’d take care of Extremis. “You’re going to be fine,” he promised. Then he turned to Steve, noticing the burns for the first time. “You saved her. Thank you.”
“Tony, do you have another suit somewhere?” Steve asked as they approached Killian’s location.
“The message from the future, the thing about myself that no one else knew was who my first crush was. My first crush that I never told anyone about, not even Bucky. I never told anyone because I couldn’t.” Steve could see the tiny changes in Tony’s expression as he started to connect the dots. “I couldn’t tell anyone that the first person I liked as more than a friend was named Matthew.”
The next morning, Steve received a message from JARVIS telling him that he believed that the Mandarin was at a base in Miami. Steve and Thor headed out immediately. When they arrived at the mansion, they were surprised to find Tony, walking in a banged-up Iron Man suit, and Rhodey, also banged up, but without a suit. Steve smiled, relieved that they were both alright.
Steve looked at her and made a snap decision. "I’m as ready as I’m likely to get. I’ve had a helluva few months, Natasha. I keep saying nothing else will surprise me, and things keep happening just to prove me wrong. Go ahead and say it, and I’ll pick up the pieces like I always do.”
“First, I’m fine for you to tell Agent May. If Clint and Natasha sign off, that’s good enough for me. We’ve asked Clint, Natasha, and Sharon Carter – Peggy’s niece – to put together lists of people they trust without question and people they suspect as Hydra. Tony’ll plug the information into whatever fancy model he comes up with and we’ll go from there. Natasha is also going to try to teach me to go undercover.” Steve made a face. “Thanks to future-me, they all think I’m Hydra, so I’m apparently a built-in spy. Right now we’re just at fact-finding, but if my lack of hailing is discovered, we could shift to fight mode pretty quickly. We’d like you to be ready.”
As they walked down to the lab, Tony squinted at Steve and gave an odd little half-smile. "So the indomitable Natasha fell in love with your best buddy. That weird for you?"
As soon as she left, Sam took a pull of his third beer and said “So. What’s the deal with Natasha?”
There was a short pause and then, “Compiled, Sir.”
“No promises. There’s an awful lot of traffic for a Sunday morning. But don’t worry, our exit is coming up next, we’ll get you to the church on time.”
“Lots of things. You and Red Skull were alone on that plane. He told you about the promise of Hydra. You didn’t kill him, the tesseract did. You saw something incredible when it killed him. You weren’t sure about joining SHIELD when you first woke up, so you wanted to look into it more. As soon as you saw Zola in the photograph of the early SHIELD, you knew he must have brought Hydra with him. You have enhanced hearing that allows you to listen in on conversations in the next room. The future is overwhelming and you need order. The brass never used to listen to you, and you don’t think Fury is listening to you now. You want more control over your destiny. Hydra is all about control. Any of those statements false?”
“You really loved her, huh?”
The two of them also stealthily joined the relief efforts throughout New York. Knowing that their appearance would cause the press to flock and slow down any work, they went in civilian clothes – Clint made Steve go shopping first so he wouldn’t give himself away with what he referred to as Steve’s old-man-clothes – and tried not to draw any extra attention to themselves. Rebuilding New York took most of the summer, and when fall rolled in, Steve found himself missing the feeling that came with helping in a non-fighting capacity, so he started volunteering other places when he found himself at loose ends: homeless shelters, soup kitchens, and the only place he wore his Captain America uniform – children’s hospitals. Sometimes he dragged the other Avengers with him to the hospital. Iron Man and Thor were always exceptionally popular, and he found himself surprised at how Natasha softened when faced with little girls who wanted to be superheroes just like her.
“That’s a you decision. I mean it’s safe, obviously. She knows I’m bi. And she’s a vault. At least if you tell her, she’ll be trying to set you up with people you might actually be attracted to.”
“But how can you be sure?”
“On your left,” he said as he approached, so as not to startle the man. He loved the freedom of running in his new body. Despite the years he’d lived in it, he could remember what it was like to struggle for nearly every breath, and it never seemed to get old.
“So I guess Maya wasn’t exactly innocent. Do we think they wanted Tony?” Bruce asked.
"JARVIS told me. I checked with him before I called. Also, how could you even keep a straight face when you said that?"
“Look, Honeybear, I know it’s hard to get leave, but I’ve got some stuff I need to talk to you about. Tell the stupid airforce I have armor upgrades.” Steve’s stomach had tightened at the pet name, but he relaxed a little when he figured out it was directed at Rhodey.
Steve made the leap. "It was never about worthy, Nat. It was about loyalty. Yours to Fury runs deep, deeper than the rest of us. I knew I needed to be able to give you a good reason for loyalty to us to come first. Your story today happened to fit that requirement. I don't know if you've noticed," he couldn't help the smile; Natasha noticed everything, "but I'm not exactly the warrior stoic type. It probably seemed a little odd to you that I could tell you exactly what Bucky meant to me one minute, and then have virtually no reaction to your big reveal. I knew Bucky was still alive. I found out yesterday, from future me." He went through the whole story – minus the details of his future self's big reveal – and waited for her reaction.
She couldn’t complete the thought, but Tony had already seen what was making her babble. A car was backing up in the breakdown lane. It took only seconds, but each one was frozen in his brain. It was so close, cars were everywhere, around him, and suddenly it swerved out of the breakdown lane and right into his. He slammed on the brakes as hard as he could, bracing himself for impact. It came faster than he thought, but still somehow took forever.
A few minutes later, the elevator door opened and Tony stepped out. “How goes it?”
Tony just laughed. “Fair point. Well fine, even without the dress yet, you look amazing. You picked the perfect hair and makeup team. Even if you wouldn’t let me pay for it.”
Clint was a totally different story. Bonding with Clint was easy – definitely the easiest thing Steve had done in this century. He still missed Bucky fiercely, but over the next several months, Clint filled in some of the holes of emptiness he’d been living with since waking up. Steve wasn’t quite ready for everyone to know he was gay, but it was nice having someone he could talk to, and Clint made it so easy. He brought Steve to the roof of an apartment building to watch the Pride parade that June. Steve couldn’t believe how amazing everything was and promised himself he would be brave enough to go next year.
“Growth is good. Is that how we get most people?”
Tony cocked his head. “Come on, you’ve never kept a secret? Told half-truths to avoid giving it away? I know Captain America is all virtue, but I’m willing to bet young Steve Rogers had a few things he didn’t want anyone to know. Tap into that guy.” Clint’s eyes flicked back and forth between Tony, who looked all too knowing, and Steve, who had just the faintest blush. He hid a smirk behind his hand. “Besides, you now have access to the queen spy. I bet she’d be happy to teach you, right?” He finally broke eye-contact with Steve to look over to Natasha, but Steve was still thinking about what he’d said. Maybe he could do this.
“I hate to complicate things,” said Rhodey, “but do we know if they have any other prisoners?”
Steve squeezed his shoulder gently, then moved back to sit on the couch next to Tony. “Have a seat, Phil. Just after the Battle of New York, I fought someone who looked like me. I thought he was Loki, but as it turned out, he was me from the future. He told me that Bucky – James –”
"Yeah, Bucky was the one always reading those science fiction novels. He thought Howard's stuff was the best. Your lab would make him lose his mind." Steve cleared his throat. "I've been meaning to tell you, I'm sorry about your parents. I never met your mother, but I've seen pictures – you look like her. And Edwin. JARVIS said he died as well. He was a good man."
"Um, hi everyone. I have some… interesting news. I've been doing a lot of work scanning for events like the wormhole." At that, Steve noticed as Tony tightened just the tiniest amount, but he said nothing as Jane continued. "I thought, maybe, anything that showed the same energy signatures might be Loki. Thor said he escaped with the tesseract, which is how the original portal formed, right? So anyway, I've been looking for him."
“Yes?”
When Steve tapped it experimentally, a tiny keyboard appeared. “What does he mean add his number to my phone? And damnit, how did SHIELD think I was going to catch up using the stupid old phone they gave me? Gradual isn’t useful when it comes to tech. I just have to keep unlearning and relearning everything. The other phone didn’t have a keyboard. It had letters on each of the number keys. And I never needed to type anything. Plus the screen was tiny. And black and white. Do they think I’m afraid of color?” he groused.
“Now Tony,” Steve protested, blushing, “don’t exaggerate. Besides, Fitz seemed like he would do just about anything
Dozens of emotions passed over Trip’s face, too quickly for Steve to decipher. “Garrett? Are you sure?”
“Holy shit. It was crazy enough to hear that you’d come back from the dead, but Bucky Barnes too? Grandpa talked a lot about the two of you. He said Sarge saved his ass in Azzano. He could hold his own, but five on one odds aren’t great. I guess some of the guys weren’t too thrilled sharing the cell with a black man. Speaking of which, how exactly did you manage an integrated unit?”
Steve breathed an internal sigh of relief. He’d taken the first step.
“Put her through, J. Hey Pep, you’re on speaker with the Avengers. Don’t tell any embarrassing stories. How’s Happy?”
Natasha wasted no time. “SHIELD is compromised. We’ve known for a while now. We weren’t sure if we could trust you until yesterday.”
“Okay, so he’s one of the best and he’s on Coulson’s team. Clint, I’d like you to pay Coulson a little visit. Tell him what we know. Tell him we’re sure. Ward is Hydra. He can tell May but no one else. He could’ve spent his time on Coulson’s team recruiting. I want you there in case something goes down when I visit Pierce. Tony, if you could keep going through people that Garrett has recruited, keep building your web, that would be great. Nat, I’d like you to head down to DC now, settle in at SHIELD, keep an eye on things.”
“Umm… there’s a hammer on your suit?” Steve was getting more confused by the second.
You know, Steve and I have actually talked a lot about alternate timeline him. He said that without the push, he wouldn’t have been able to reach out to any of us. He lost his whole world, man. Everything he ever knew, poof, gone. Then he wakes up, has no one and nothing, and gets shoved right back into a fight. He said that without the hope of Bucky being alive to light a fire in him, he would’ve gone right back to that depressing pit of an apartment that SHIELD set him up with. If you ask me, he would’ve stayed there until some other terrible thing happened, running missions for SHIELD, probably with fucking Rumlow and STRIKE team, becoming less and less Steve and more and more Captain America. Hell, considering the fact that alternate Steve’s ‘evidence’ was that he was gay, I doubt he ever came out to his team. Steve told us really soon. I don’t think it’s fair to compare what alternate Steve might or might not have done. This Steve,
a lot, too. Too bad there are no sequels to that,” he chuckled.
. It’s an excellent idea. Stark will refuse, Pierce will be frustrated, and you can use that as your entry. We’d better move up your chat with Rumlow. You need to practice with him before we unleash you on Pierce, and if they want this as badly as I suspect, he’ll want it solved quickly. You sure you can build that backdoor, Stark?”
"Okay, so I'm going to tell you some things I found, and I want your honest reaction."
“Wait,
“Well there’s not that many unions, to be honest. And I’m not an Avenger. Iron Man yes. Tony Stark no.” Tony didn’t glance at Natasha as he said it, but Steve rounded on her anyway.
Steve thought he and Natasha were actually making headway as friends. She seemed to like teaching him to lie better than teaching him to fight. “You’re actually better than I thought you’d be,” she admitted after the lying exercises. “As long as you’re telling pieces of the truth, you’re doing well. I think if we come up with enough details for your background and cover, you can fool anyone you come up against.”
“It may be of interest to you to know that the individual you previously inquired about, Agent Triplett, grandson of Private Gabriel Jones, is currently serving with Agent Garrett.”
Steve shoved him gently. “Shut up. This is all your fault. Look, that,” he waved vaguely at the projection, “is not the point. The point is, I was right. SHIELD was omitted from my who-to-trust list on purpose. Because at least some of them are actually Hydra.”
“I’d like to talk to you about your treatment of Stark.”
"Oh it does, and when you're done talking, we have plenty that we'd like to share. But you're at something of a trust deficit in this room, Natalie, so you get to start." Despite her excellent and almost immediate recovery, Steve could tell he'd scored a point. He may not be a spy or a good liar, but he had plenty of experience reading people, and in his day, reading things wrong usually got him beaten to a pulp.
“I’ll do what I can. Hydra is everything Aunt Peggy fought against. I won’t let it take over SHIELD if I can help it. It sounds like future-you gave us a leg up. We just have to use it.”
It seemed that today was a good day. He was glad that this first meeting could be easier. Even though he'd been awake in the new century for nearly a year, seeing Peggy was hard. She was a tangible representation of exactly how much time had passed. He walked over and grabbed her hand. "Actually, Peg, I was hoping to execute a jailbreak. Wanna go on an adventure with me?"
She eyed the two of them speculatively. "Sure. Sounds like fun." Her tone was dry and her face held little expression. Steve realized all at once that, while he didn't know the mistakes his future self had referred to, he was already doing things differently. He had spent the time since thawing almost exclusively alone, finding no enjoyment in anything and no connection to anyone. He also knew himself well enough to know that without the fire lit by Bucky's potential survival, he would not have put much effort into getting to know Natasha or Tony. Clint, maybe. He had the makings of a soldier, not a spy, and he seemed the type to reach out first, especially given his gratitude towards Steve. With their closeness, Natasha may have followed, but it would've taken time, and Steve would've been a mostly passive participant. He hoped it would make whatever difference he apparently needed.
“It would be my pleasure. I would really love to be absolutely anywhere else.”
"Let me rephrase. How much do you know about how the serum affected me?"
Steve continued hitting the heavy bag. “Little one, yeah. What about you? Got time for a beer after your workout?” He and Natasha had discussed this. Keep working out. Make it casual. Use the exertion to hide any tells there might be. Steve could see Rumlow smirk out of the corner of his eye.
Steve looked around. "Look, you've got no reason to follow my lead here, but it seems to me that if that's the only advice future me gives, it's awfully important. He seemed like he trusted you all, both on and off the field, but something about how he said it made me think that the trust took a little too long and something slipped through the cracks in the meantime. I know this doesn't automatically make us a team, but I'd like us to be." He cleared his throat. "Anyway, that's where we are."
"Maybe she wouldn't have been involved, but a lot of people would've given almost anything for the chance at the serum, Steve." Bruce looked ashamed. Thor, sensing his discomfort, clapped him on the shoulder, but said nothing.
“Aldrich Killian?” Steve cut in with a raised eyebrow. “Yeah, we know. Get on the quinjet. We’re not just here because you suddenly and without explanation fell off the grid. Tony,” he said seriously, wishing he was certain enough of Tony’s reaction to put his hand on Tony’s shoulder, “Maya Hansen was not a victim. She was there to help Killian kidnap Pepper. We think he’s trying to get you to help them fix Extremis.”
The day after meeting with Peggy, Steve went for a run. It was early, before dawn. He pulled out his phone and the fancy Bluetooth headphones Tony had talked him into and headed for the monuments. As he settled into the run, he called Tony.
"Why, I'm fine, Tony, thanks for asking. How are you doing?" Steve smiled wryly as Tony flapped his hands as if to wave off Steve's questions.
Steve spent the next few weeks working with Natasha. She gave him scenarios to describe and they talked through how to tell the lie using pieces of truth. Eventually, he started to see it as a sort of strategizing. He practiced several of them with her, and then she set him loose on the rest of the team. “Start with Bruce. Training wheels. Then Tony, and wrap up with Clint.”
“No, no, that part was true. It’s true that I didn’t love her. It’s a lie that we could’ve made each other happy. I would never have been happy with her. I wanted to be. Really wanted to be.”
“It wasn’t that. Or not just that. Look, Barton came and talked to me. Asked me when I wanted him to leave, because clearly I have issues with people who were brainwashed into murder.”
“And when he was killed, what did you do?”
"Yeah, that's Bucky for ya. Always there for just exactly what I need." Steve sighed. The one time Bucky had needed him, he'd let him down. He had to make it up to him. Whatever it took, he'd find Bucky now and save him.
“Careful there, stud, or she’ll think you’re trying to get in her pants.”
“Excuse me, Captain, if I may?”
Steve looked back and forth between the two of them. “Clint, do you disagree?”
"Your bed is too soft. When I was over there, I was sleeping on the ground. Using rocks for pillows like a caveman. Then I come back, I'm home, lying in my bed and it's like…"
He’d discovered at the library that they had made movies of the
“I have no idea how it’s possible. I did defeat Schmidt, and from my understanding, the rest of Hydra followed soon after. But Brock Rumlow, head of SHIELD’s STRIKE team, said, ‘Hail Hydra,’ to me in the locker room today. Long story short, our future selves,” he gestured between Tony and himself, “apparently knew that the whole STRIKE team and Agent Sitwell – plus, from how the conversation went, Secretary Alexander Pierce – were Hydra. They were in the elevator with the scepter, future me needed the scepter, and he convinced them to give it to him by hailing Hydra. So now, they all think that
Steve’s eyes shot to Tony’s. “Shit. Where are they stationed?”
. It’s his favorite.”
“Ah, of course. I can see why you wouldn’t want to share that with Fury. He’s hard enough to get information out of as it is. So why does the Avengers’ susceptibility depend on Fury?”
Steve felt a huge wave of relief wash over him when he stepped back into the tower. Since Nat was staying in DC for a couple of weeks and Sam had to clear up his life in DC before moving, he was coming back alone. He asked JARVIS to take him to the common floor. When he arrived, Tony was on the phone.
angry. Everything here is too much, too loud, too big. You are certainly no exception to that. The men I served with were heroes, too, but no one remembers them but me. And everyone will remember you. I was too busy being struck by the unfairness of that that I was unfair to you. Truce?” He extended his hand with half a smile. “I think we’re going to need it for the second thing on my list.”
After a moment, the car had finally stopped. Tony’s ears were ringing and he was a little bit dazed, but he thought that he was pretty much okay. The airbags had gone off, so it was another moment before they deflated enough for him to see out the windshield. When he could, he saw that the impact had launched the stupid backing-up-on-the-highway car back into the breakdown lane and a man with dirty blond hair waving him forward. Oh. Right. He was still in the right lane of the highway. Amazingly, the car seemed to still be running for the moment, so he eased his foot off the brake and let it stumble it’s last few feet until he was out of the way of any traffic.
"Yeah, I kinda put that together." Sam eyed him up and down a little suspiciously, Steve thought.
Phil Coulson trudged up the stairs to his office after what had been a frustrating day for him. He opened the door and walked in, struck by the immediate sense that something was off. He tensed, his hand going to the weapon at his hip. Laying on his desk was a complete set of Captain America training cards, mint condition, all signed. His desk chair spun around.
Steve came abruptly to consciousness, his face pressed against the cool tile floor. He pushed himself up to his knees and looked around but saw no sign of Loki. The scepter, however, was on the floor next to him. “Damn. How long was I out?” he wondered aloud. Since he hadn’t seen anyone, he started when he received a response.
It took him a solid 24 hours, but Steve finally worked up the nerve to call Tony. “Um, hey, this is Steve. The firefighter. From the accident you were in the other day. Um, Natasha - she’s Miss Potts’ assistant - she gave me your phone number.” He took a deep breath. “I was wondering if maybe you wanted to get dinner with me this Saturday.”
? “Make yourself useful and get us a couple’a beers.” Kaminsky nervously darted off to do as he was told. Rumlow settled them at a table with the other members of the STRIKE team. “So Cap, we’re curious. How’d you end up as Hydra?”
though he hadn’t started it yet. He knew Tony had been making fun of him in some way and figured the only way to understand what he’d meant was to read the book.
Tony snorted. “Yeah, good luck with that. Anyway, you want to hear about my day, or are you all about you?”
“There will be no discussions of emotions, Rogers.” He softened his words with a hand on Steve’s shoulder. “We have a lot of work to do. I know that you want to rescue Rapunzel, but we have to have a coordinated strike.”
“Right. So I’ve seen you strategize in real-time. You analyzed everyone’s capabilities and made split-second decisions that allowed six people to fight an entire army of aliens, plus one demi-god with daddy issues. You have the capability to think on your feet. What you lack is confidence. We’re going to practice.”
"Aunt Peggy is in a nursing home in DC. She has dementia. Sometimes her mind is all there and sometimes it's not. I want you to be prepared. She has good days and bad days. And… to be honest, I wouldn't be shocked if her room is under surveillance. She founded SHIELD. Even if they weren't interested in her secrets – which they are – she would probably be under protection."
During his time in the SHIELD gym with Natasha and occasionally Clint, Steve ran into SHIELD agents all the time. They all knew Natasha and Clint, and they at least knew
They settled into the couches and armchairs and, in the case of Clint, sprawled across the floor, leaning up against Natasha's legs where she sat on the loveseat next to Bruce. They went through the whole story, with only a couple of clarifying questions.
Steve just said, “Sam.”
In contrast to Tony’s quiet agreement, Natasha looked delighted. “Well, well, well. You surprise me, солнце
“I told you, Cap, it’s Avengers Tower now. Got a big A on it and everything.”
“I’m not – ”
“Why would you think he did?” asked Bruce.
." Steve looked up at Tony from under his lashes in time to see his eyebrows shoot up to his hairline.
“I’ve been listening to you talk tech for over a year and I still have no idea what that means,” Clint complained.
"Two tours. Some things you leave there, some things you bring home with you." He shrugged. "How's it going in the modern world?"
“That seems reasonable. Why did you offer to let Bruce and Thor move in but not the rest of us?”
One afternoon, after Steve had been coming by to sketch for a few months, Tony seemed more jittery than usual. He wouldn’t make eye contact and he turned the music up so they wouldn’t be able to talk. Steve knew he could wait Tony out, so he settled in on the couch where he usually set himself up. After a couple of hours, Tony cracked. “J, music off. So, um, I wanted to tell you something. I mean I don’t want to, but I think I should. I mean you should know, I just wish someone else would tell you. But I can’t think of anyone who would. Or could. Anyway, it’s about Aunt Peggy.” That was maybe the last thing that Steve had expected. “I don’t know how much you know about her life after you went into the ice. But, um, she got married.” Tony said all this very fast, and it occurred to Steve that he thought it would hurt Steve to hear about Peggy loving someone else.
After the tire squealing and crashing ended, Steve heard, “Sonuvabitch!” before Bucky dropped the wrench he was holding and took off after Clint, Sam and Steve getting up and running just a moment behind him. Steve watched as Clint waved the poor driver forward and the formerly beautiful car limped onto the side of the road. Steve ran faster, overtaking Bucky and Sam.
Both men stared at him for the briefest of moments; then Tony’s look transformed to dramatically betrayed, while Rhodey’s morphed to a smug sort of approval. “What do you think, Tony? Should we introduce him to the wonders of modern New York pizza?”
“So what, she loved you more than you loved her? You really did dig the blond secretary but you felt guilty?” This was the most flustered that Steve had ever seen Tony, and they’d fought aliens together. Steve wanted to fix it – he could see that confusion was a hard thing for someone as smart as Tony – but he was having a hard time actually saying the words.
“Grant Ward?” Natasha looked about as upset as she ever did. “He’s a talented agent. Also an ass.”
“I refuse to accept Jim as a substitute for Rhodey. But yeah, sure. If he hadn’t already figured it out, sure, I told him. What does that have to do with Aunt Peggy?”
"What?"
“Excellent, JARVIS! If you will excuse me, I’ll speak with her privately.”
“That depends. Is Fury Hydra?”
“That doesn’t mean you don’t deserve some happiness, Cap. I know you lost a lot, and moving on from that has to be a monumental task. But there are good things about you being here, now, not the least of which is the fact that you could actually make a real life with a man you love. Just think about it.
“Tony Stark?”
“Sure, great movie.”
As he listened to Tony talk, Steve couldn’t help the grin that came over his face. “Tony,” he said very seriously. “Are you telling me that you’re creating a stealth AI that you have named SNEAK?”
“There’s always
“God, isn’t that just like dear old Dad. So desperate for science that he completely ignored all the possible consequences. He got in bed with Red Skull’s best friend, and for what? What could he possibly have had that was worth it?”
Tony looked confused by Steve’s abrupt statement. “So you
“You always did process faster than I did, buddy. Thanks. Send him a text from me. ‘Come home. We found Rapunzel’s hidden tower.’ It’s a good thing Clint made us watch Tangled last week. He’ll get that reference.”
"Steve Rogers."
“Eugh, you accused her of
? Okay, let’s just get this straightened out before the poor guy moves in. I am not interested in Sam. He seems like a really good guy and I like being able to talk to another soldier. He doesn’t even know I like men. And he definitely likes Natasha.” Steve frowned. “I’m going to matchmake her right back. Damnit. I don’t need her to find me someone.” He was grumbling now, he knew, but he couldn’t seem to help it. Inexplicably, the thing that bothered him the most was that Tony thought he wanted to date Sam. He looked up. “Seriously. Not wounded. Now. What do you want to watch with our Chinese food?”
“And?”
“Sure thing, Cap. Grant Ward was recruited to SHIELD by Garrett. He excelled at the operations branch of SHIELD academy, proved himself on several missions, and was a specialist at SHIELD before he got put on Coulson’s team. That’s all in his personnel record. What isn’t in his record is that he broke out of military school, stole a car, drove home, and lit his house on fire with his older brother inside. Garrett broke him out of prison. In several of his early psych evaluations, he stated that all he really wanted was to be worthy of the faith Garrett had shown in him. He’s definitely Hydra.”
Tony nudged Steve with his elbow where they stood behind a shipping container. “Look there she is. She’s glowing – they must’ve injected her with Extremis. We have to save her, Steve. It’s my fault she’s in this mess, and she’s my best friend.”
“Thanks, Tony. It’s amazing.” Tony started to wave his hand, clearly dismissing all he had done. Steve wasn’t about to stand for that. He touched Tony’s wrist gently, stilling his hand. “Tony,” he said, softer than before. “Really. Thank you. You’re a good man.”
Steve continued to run around the monument, and shortly found himself approaching the same man. Again he said, "On your left."
Tony didn’t have an answer. “We’ll find him, Steve.”
Steve sighed again and decided that since he usually couldn’t walk away from a fight, it was about time he started this one. “Being a man.”
Steve laughed. “They don’t come much more dangerous than Nat. You could be good for her.”
“No, nothing like that. I mean… okay. When you were at MIT, when you had a crush on someone, did you tell Jim?”
Steve was smiling as he drove, listening to Bucky, Sam, and Clint bicker around him.
Tony slumped. “I hate logic. This is why I wouldn’t take Pepper’s calls. Fine. Tell him he can come back.”
He sagged into the passenger seat of the car where Natasha was waiting for him. “I texted Fury a meetup time from my burner phone along with a code so he knows it’s me. And I talked to Tony. He said you did well and not to feel guilty about what you said about him.”
Natasha blinked at him. “Well now I have a whole new pool of possibilities. I’ll come up with some good ones, I promise. Unless you’re not ready to be out yet?”
