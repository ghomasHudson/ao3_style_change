“Yeah, that place.” Gwen giggled. She took out a piece of paper and started scribbling something on it and then handing it to Peter. “Here is my number. Give me a call after school around seven and we’ll meet up.”
The place was hot compared to the outside freezing air so the two took off their coats and scarves. Peter gave Gwen a quick up and down look. She wore her usual knee high boots and tight dark blue jeans with a gorgeous emerald green blouse. His voice caught in his throat and he held his breath for a moment. Finally catching himself, he cleared his throat and smiled when Gwen looked up at him. “You look amazing.” He said in a half whisper. Peter cursed himself in his mind, he wanted to say that clear and loud to really let her know. Not to let her know that he was too breath-taken away. He chewed on his bottom lip and looked down, feeling like a wimp.
Steve signed on the other line. "Yeah, he's pretty mad at me. I'll give him a call. Have a good day son. I'll be home for New Years."
“Head up in my class, Peter!” The teacher yelled.
She was quiet on the other end for a while. Peter could hear her trying to calm herself before speaking. "Are you busy?" She asked and when he responded with no, she continued. "Can we meet up? Union Square maybe?"
Steve was quiet for a second on the other line before chuckling. "That man will do everything I say not to do when he's mad at me. But I'm glad you like the dog, Peter. What else did you do?" He asked calmly.
“Can’t hear you. Speak up.” Steve said in his more military tone.
“Night dad.” Peter said, looking up and smiling at his father, then setting back to his task.

“So, which university are you hoping most will reply?” Peter asked as he scooped another helping into his bowl.
Harry looked down to the floor nervously. “I saw that your dad was being rushed to the hospital on the news. I...I wanted to come and support you.”
Good head start, and he wasn't going to slow down for a minute. Peter ran through the hallways and down the stairs to his next class. Today he wanted to go to all his classes. Especially since he had his next one with Gwen. Peter arrived to the classroom safe and sound, though he realized he'd have to try and avoid the big idiot for the rest of the day. But all that didn't seem to matter as Gwen entered the room and smiled at him. She walked over to his table and sat next to him. "Hi." He said and cleared his throat.
Peter couldn’t help but wince at the curtness of his father’s tone. “Just…stuff, sir.”
“Okay, I’ll head out now.” She responded and Peter could hear some shuffling and a door close.
Nodding, Gwen turned his face from side to side, checking for bruising and cuts. “Yes, and your name is?”
"Bit of both." Peter said as he took off his jacket and draped it over the back of a chair. "I mean I did have to buy it from the store. But after buying it all, I cooked it. Even peeled and mashed the potatoes myself!" He laughed and laughed even harder from the look Bucky was giving him.
Staying there for a moment longer, Steve straightened up and ruffled Peter’s hair. “Just press the call button.” With that he walked down the hall and descended the stairs.
Before heading over to his seat, Peter searched the S section for Gwen. She was easy to spot, with her valedictorian sash on. She spotted him and smiled, waving just as the principle took the podium.
Peter shook his head before noticing Tony had left his coffee cup. Finishing up his breakfast, he poured some food into Jarvis’s bowl before grabbing the coffee cup and heading upstairs. He stopped just short of the last step, catching a hint of an odd smell. Bringing the cup up to his nose, the scent of whisky hit his senses. With an agitated sigh, Peter angrily walked the rest of the way and knocked hard on the door.
Peter giggled to himself. The day he could take on Flash would be the day he could fly through the streets of New York City. But it was fun to mess with the big dumbass. Maybe when it gets warmer, he’ll lead Flash and his coon pack on a wild chase around the city on his skateboard. Finding the memory card, he shoved it into its slot and turned the camera on. An empty card. Perfect. Everything was set and ready for tomorrow and Peter decided to call it a night, shutting off the light and crawling into bed.
Tony ignored the question and handed Peter a small wrapped gift box. “Merry Christmas, Peter.” Tony smiled.
Flash tossed his notebook at Peter and sat back in his seat. “Do the problems for me.” He looked to his little goon friend sitting next to him and smiled.
Peter was shaking his head already. “No one. I mean, she is someone--but no one that I--we’ve never even-- until today but.” He took a breath, hating himself for answering that first question in the worst possible way. His face felt as hot as it was probably red and he looked down at his knees.
Peter’s heart sank immediately. Did something happen to Steve? Was Tony okay? Who was hurt? What was wrong? All the questions flooded his mind, one right after the other. “Is everything okay? Where’s dad?” He asked, really asking about both his father’s.
Eyeing the plate, Peter now feared for his life. But he picked up the fork anyways and twirled some strings onto it. Bringing the fork up to his lips, he looked around the table and realized his fathers were at the same position. They all gave a small nod and shoved the forks into their mouths. Peter first tasted the sauce which must have been home made. It was bursting with way too much tomato paste and what he thought to be pepper. The pasta was a bit stale and probably not cooked all the way through. But it was the first meal they’ve all had together in a long time and Peter was determined to make the best out of it. He swallowed and looked to Tony with a smile. “It’s good.” He said in the most delighted tone he could muster up.
Now Peter had done a lot of internal therapy to not take anything Flash says seriously. But at this moment with his head pounding, ribs burning, stomach on the verge of sending his morning cereal to his throat, those words hurt. He loved his fathers, and didn’t care if he had friends or not. And in the end, it was he, Peter Rogers-Stark, that would have an outstanding life, not Eugene ‘Flash’ Thompson. Blood seemed to rush back into his head and Peter began to rise to his feet. It wasn’t for long though as Peter received another punch to his stomach and was once more down on the floor.
“Well, I am happy you were able to ease them into it.” Harry said before pulling Peter into another kiss.
Tony nodded and stood from the table. "Well I'll be in my room. Self loathing." He walked away and headed up the stairs.
(See the end of the chapter for
What would they do if Tony didn’t come out of this?
Pushing his shirt back down, he scooped up his backpack and walked with his head down out of the bathroom. He didn’t want to go back to class. Not after everyone had seen what happened. Not after no teacher came out into the hallway to help him. Not after Gwen had been so kind and he felt just so stupid. Running to his locker, he grabbed his coat and scarf, shoved his books into his locker, and left the building. He knew he could go home right now and not get into any trouble. His father’s worked long hours. It was rare if he got to see them come home at all. Most nights he spent eating dinner by himself.
Peter rolled his eyes but laughed as well. "You need to call dad. He's self loathing in the room. And...just being stubborn." Peter decided not to tell Steve about the spiked coffee.
“I’ve got a turtleneck on.” Gwen pointed to her neck.
Peter felt his heart fall into the pit of his stomach and frowned. “Wait...you guys never said anything about being grounded. You said to do the dishes.” He quickly tried to come to his own defense, but anything against Steve was futile.
The sound of the lenses capturing the picture made Peter smile. It had been such a long time since he snapped a picture and it delighted him. But this was just the day time, Peter longed for the sun to set so the holiday lights would come on and he could snap pictures of that. It was warming and he loved the way the lights from the decorations danced in the final outcome of the pictures. Some he kept original, when they were brighter than the sun. He let his camera hang on its strap around his neck as he continued walking the rest of the way to school. This morning he had been up bright and early, eager to get out and catch a few morning pictures before the morning buzz filled and blocked the sights.
(See the end of the chapter for
Crossing his arms and leaning back in his chair, Steve looked over at Tony. “Now that is a classic Ringbrothers 1958 Ford F-100.”
But Peter had frozen on the spot. Heart medicine? When and why was Tony taking a heart medicine? Did Steve know? Was Tony going to be alright?
Gwen looked shocked at the fact he had gotten her something. With a warm smile, she took the bag from him and waved away his worried words. Taking out the scarf, Gwen let out a small gasp and smiled brightly. “Peter, it’s beautiful. Thank you!” She reached across the table and pulled him into a hug.
"Yeah, we did. The soldiers were happy. It's better than the normal DFac food. And they had pie so I was happy. Had my good ol' American apple pie!" Steve boasted with a laugh.
Peter nodded enthusiastically. “Yeah of course. You like photography?” He asked. He noticed one of his hands made its way out of his pocket and moved as he spoke. Quickly he shoved it back into his pocket.
Whether it was to be kind to his throbbing head or because she was just sweet, Peter didn’t know, but he took his bag from her and nodded, smiling a bit wider. “Right.”
“Oscorp? Why wouldn’t you go to Stark Industries? I mean, after what happened, is that the best place to go?” Bucky asked, turning a little to Peter.
"Alright smartass. Set the table." Bucky said and Peter happily complied.
Finally the teacher gave them a page number in their textbooks and told them to work on the problems at the end of the chapter. Only the odd numbers. As if on cue, Flash was shoving his book into Peter’s hands. “Better do it right this time, Rogers.” He said through gritted teeth, cracking his knuckles.
Peter quickly chimed in to agree. “Yeah Pop, it’s like, a million degrees outside.”
There was a split second where Peter fights on the impulse to pretend he didn’t hear his father call him and just run down the block. But if interrogated about it later, he knew he would crumble. So he opened the door and took a step in, smiling at his father. “Morning, sir.” He said with his usual sheepish smile.
Together they bit into their Zeppole, each getting the white powdered sugar all over their fingers and lips. They laughed as they wiped their mouths with napkins. “It really is delicious.” Gwen commented, taking another bite.
Peter paced in his room, his cell phone in one hand, the paper with Gwen’s number in the other. He dialed the number already but had yet to press the call button. It wasn’t seven yet. It was five minutes till and he counted down the seconds. His heart pounded, his face hot with nerves. He couldn’t help thinking the negatives of what this phone call could bring. Perhaps she’d cancel and then he’ll go out to take the pictures alone. He didn’t mind going alone, but the thought that Gwen was supposed to be there as well would give him an unsettling feeling in his stomach and he wouldn’t enjoy the night.
Bucky had gone to get them something to eat as it seemed they would be there for a while. So Peter sat alone, people in the waiting area looking at him every now and again as the TV showed the news and his father’s story being broadcasted. He hated this. Why was everyone in Tony’s business? It wasn’t as though they actually cared. It wasn’t as though they would cry if it came to the worse.
There’s some quiet conversation happening between Steve and whoever before the door closes. Tony lifts himself up on his elbows, about to ask who was it when he notices what’s in Steve’s hand - it’s a large slice of cheesecake with a candle on top. Tony stares at the confectionery for a second before he glances up at Steve, bewildered. Steve’s smiling back at him, charmingly boyish and delighted at the same time. Tony finds himself sitting up in bed as Steve walks back to the bed, mindful of the flickering flame.
It’s like nothing he’s felt before. Tony’s had a fair amount of sex, some of it mind-blowing. He understands the intimacy the contact can bring. And yet, never has it felt so intense. Tony’s dizzy and breathless, struggling to meet his desire to catalogue and remember every detail of this moment. Like lightning flashing through a dark sky, there are bursts of clarity.
, a quiet voice reminds Steve. And it’s humbling as much as it’s upsetting. Steve presses his mouth against Tony’s shoulder and finds himself tightening his hold on the man. Tony makes a half-hearted grumble that the eggs are going to burn if Steve keeps this up but Steve doesn’t hear the complaint. He’s deep in the memory of an old conversation with Carol, shortly after his return.
It feels a little egotistical to admit that aloud but Kamala pushes that feeling aside as soon as she remembers how broken Tony had looked during that first conversation with Kamala.
Shame quickly follows the thought. Though it is quick to burn away because this level of distrust is not uncalled for. Begrudgingly however, Steve needs to consider all possibilities and give Tony the benefit of the doubt.
Misery drips off Tony’s frame. And Steve cannot stand it. Carefully, with his heart thudding painfully against his ribs, Steve presses himself against Tony’s side. With his lips pressed against Tony’s hair, Steve whispers, “I’m gonna remind you every day that it wasn’t your fault.”
he sternly tells himself. He’s got a job to do.
Nausea forgotten, Kamala cautiously cracks an eye open. The first thing she notices is the thin blue curtains pulled closed. The second thing she notices is Tony’s armored form sitting just out of her reach, looking up at Steve, who is sitting extremely close to Tony. Jesus. They might as well just sit in each other’s laps honestly.
But this isn’t a day like any other. Instead of paying attention to the show, Tony’s mind is busy scrolling through his mental rolodex of contacts, wondering if he knows an alpha who is available to be his date for an upcoming gala. And by upcoming gala he means a $2,500 a plate, black-tie dinner that’s going to be held in
“Was it worth it?” Steve asks after a beat. “Hurting me to save me?”
“But this isn’t just
she decides. She’s going to risk the consequences and roll over on the bed. Hopefully the movement will be enough to make them change the subject.
Steve’s eyes light up like Tony just saved Christmas instead of solving a problem he’s had to solve at least once a month since he made DUM-E. It makes the back of his neck heat up uncomfortably, especially when Steve nudges the coffee towards him. As Tony picks the mug up, Steve heads to the oven and pulls out a plate piled high with delicious smelling cookies. Drool immediately begins to pool under Tony's tongue.
, okay? If he has to choose between medical inaccuracies versus forensic-science inaccuracies? Tony’ll pick medicine.
“Oh my God,” Tony laughs weakly. “When you’re in, you’re
“That’s what I said!” Sam exclaims with an emphatic gesture of his own. “Most people go out on a date straight away!”
“I know,” Steve murmurs back, hand coming to rest on top of Tony’s. Guiding it higher so that Steve’s lips can brush a kiss on Tony’s wrist. “But I want to.”
At his suggestion, Kamala’s shoulders slump. “I tried that and she got really snippy with me. It’s like she was trying to pick a fight again. Only this time, it felt like she was trying to pull our friends into the fight as well.”
instead of
Tony’s hand begins to stroke her hair. It feels kinda nice. Mostly because it distracts her from thinking about how she feels one wrong thought away from throwing up. She focuses on how gentle Tony is being. He’s taken his gauntlet off probably. If he was stroking her head with his gauntlet, her hair would be getting stuck in it. Hmm. They must be somewhere safe then. Which probably means that the fight is done.
Tony ponders for a moment.
“Momentarily.” The android tells her. “There are a few more pending tasks that have to be taken care of. After that, we may leave.”
raises an incredulous eyebrow because really? He’s supposed to believe that?
. He’d much rather lose brain cells watching Grey’s Anatomy than this shoddy excuse for a crime procedural. The science in this show
The pressure on his chest intensifies a touch as Tony leans in to rub his face against the underside of Steve’s jaw with a heavy purring meow. Tony repeats the gesture against the other side of Steve's jaw. Steve tentatively presses one hand against Tony’s back to feel the purring sensation and starts to feel calm sinking into him.
. And he immediately feels guilty because Tony’s been good (for now). Tony’s the best of them. It’s not fair for him to assume the worst of him.
An old insecurity rears its ugly head up. “You could have picked me,” Steve finds himself saying, voice little-boy small. “I wanted you to pick me.”
Remembering Tony’s reaction brings a fresh wave of cold anger. Steve would never admit this aloud but Tony’s reaction had hurt. He’d thought that Tony would have been pleasantly surprised that Steve had come to help but instead, Tony had just been upset. Why though? Fuck if Steve knows.
“Any idea of how long it’ll take?” Miles asks, hopping down next to her.
“You broke DUM-E?” Tony asks in surprise because … well. Steve’s usually always so careful with the bots. He treats them like they’re little people instead of, you know. Giant sturdy metal AI arm robots. Fuck, that was a mouthful.
“Everything okay? You’ve been pretty distracted for a couple of days now.”
! That’s not the kind of tone she’d
known himself. He hadn’t realized his anger and hurt were a mere smokescreen. And all it took for them to be blown away was to be perceived by Tony and be accepted with joy. The fact of the matter is that Steve’s
It’s an unexpected line of inquiry but Tony turns to give the girl his full attention. He waits a beat for Kamala to finish her sentence. But when she trails off, he helpfully offers, “Reconnect?”
Tony blinks and looks away, brow furrowed. There’s a darkness in Tony’s eyes that makes her shiver. What memories is Tony reliving?
Lucky for him, Steve breaks all on his own. He places both coffee mugs onto the counter and sags, shoulders drooping with dejection as he asks, “How could you tell?”
Well. Now that he mentions it... “Yes please,” Kamala grins sheepishly at the older hero. “And Math.”
A small part of her wants to clear her throat and say, ‘Um, hello? Remember me? The reason why you’re here in this hospital(?). Please don’t forget that I’m here.’ But the larger part of her is enthralled by what’s happening in front of her.
“You twisted my arm for all it’s worth,” Tony grumbles, no heat in his words as he flatten’s the wrinkles out of Steve’s tie. Under his palm, Steve’s chest rises and falls slowly. Tony finds himself matching the next inhale and all he can smell is Steve. The clean, woodsy scent sparks heat deep in Tony’s stomach.
“Say it.”
It’s just... really damn close to zero.
There’s no soft give to Steve’s body. There’s just miles and miles of firm muscles and sure strength. It dries his mouth, much like how he’d felt the first time he’d seen a naked girl; nervous and brimming with anticipation. And with the same amount of greedy curiosity, Tony’s eyes and fingers feast.
“Dammit! I’m out of lives,” Sam complains mournfully.
Carol nods and points emphatically at the man. “Yes! But it might create problems for the team. Don’t you think so?”
As Steve drops mindless little kisses into Tony’s hair, Tony
While looking at Rhodey and Carol, Sam asks, “Do you guys know what’s going on with him? He’s been extra nervous this past week. And he won’t tell me why.”
Is Tony even aware of the power he holds over Steve? Probably to some extent. That’s how he’s been able to manipulate Steve in the past. But right now, there’s nothing but beguiling concern, demonstrated through Tony’s gaze and the way he’s squeezing Steve’s shoulder. It’s a gentle touch. Nothing they haven’t done before. But it feels different. Butterflies flit around his chest as Tony drags his hand away, fingertips almost caressing. The shiver the gentle touch causes is enough to jar loose the proverbial bone stuck in his throat.
Tony sniffs hard but it doesn’t stop the tears from falling down his cheeks. A wounded noise clogs up his throat when Steve makes a gentle sound of his own before wiping the tears away. Tony leans into the touch when Steve cups his cheek.
Perfect. He can’t ask for a better opportunity than this. “You haven’t told Tony I’m here, right?”
Feeling slightly cornered, Tony looks to Rhodey for help. Rhodey smirks and answers for him, “Not yet. But he’s got someone that he’s crushing on.”
“Tony,” Steve moans, one hand tightening in Tony’s hair. The other hand is resting on Tony’s ass, holding Tony in place as he comes.This is the third time Steve’s come in him and Tony’s a fucking mess of sweat, slick, and come. And he’s never felt better.
Tony’s brain feels like it’s made of sticky caramel or molasses. Everything is thick, sweet, and cloying. He breathes in deep, greedily relishing the calming scent pouring off Steve. Tony wants to soak in the woodsy scent, let it penetrate deep in him until his scent morphs and-
Hissing because
Miles sighs and crouches down next to Sam, watching him play. “You can make a chocolate ball over there,” he points out.
Thinking about that... God. It hurts more than Steve can bear. He can’t even begin to imagine how Tony must have felt. And knowing him, he must have blamed himself for what had happened as well. All the things that they’ve talked about, neither of them have dared to broach this topic. Until now.
Steve mumbles something again. Tony catches one word in the sentence and its “DUM-E.”
Tony huffs out a sorry excuse of a laugh. “Yeah. Sorry about that.”
“What’s this?” Tony finally asks as Steve transfers the plate into Tony’s hands.
Forcing himself to grin, Tony says, “So you admit they’re bad jokes!”
Steve stares and stares and stares. At first, he see-saws between annoyance and resignation. But the more he thinks about it, the more his pendulum sways towards annoyance, increasing the height of its arc until it lands on pissed-off.
“Hmm. Okay. I’ll see what I can find and send Hill an email.”
? It’d totally looked like Steve was upset that he’d lost his temper and wanted... Na. She’s probably reading too much into it.
“Like...” How would she describe it... “Like he was sad to watch Tony go. Like he was mad at himself but also mad at Tony?”
, Steve wonders as he watches Tony stack the dirty dishes together. They’ve just finished a large team meal and everyone’s gone off to relax and do whatever, leaving Steve and Tony, who’s turn it is to clean up and do the dishes, alone in the dining room.
have alerted someone. But several minutes pass by and Steve’s still rocking on his heels in the doorway. Alone.
It’s a pretty crappy thought to ponder actually, that Iron Man and Steve Rogers aren’t friends anymore. They’re two of her three favorite superheroes. It just
Steve’s yanked out of his thoughts when Tony teasingly asks, “What’re you looking at?”
Has Steve ever mentioned how much he loves Tony’s smile? Because he does. Smiling back in return, Steve continues, rattling off increasingly silly comparisons until Tony’s shaking with laughter rather than guilt. He waits until Tony’s done laughing. Then he pulls back, smile widening when he sees the happy flush on Tony’s cheeks.
“I kinda got into a fight with a friend of mine. A real bad fight. There was a whole lot of yelling and mean things were said. And long story short, we’re not talking anymore. Do you have any advice on what I could do to... you know.” Kamal gestures helplessly.
formal...
He can’t stop thinking about her eyes; big, doe-like, and brimming with betrayed hope. Remembering her expression has him groaning into his hands. Tony had never thought he’d break such a cardinal rule of being a hero: don’t break any of your fan’s hearts, don’t let them lose hope.
Fond amusement laces Steve’s reply. “You don’t need to try and impress me, Tony.”
Feeling slightly exasperated, Tony retorts. “It’s nothing like that! Rhodey, tell ‘em!”
... Steve muses.
Steve wants to mock Tony and his noble intentions because he’s failed miserably at that. But he can’t find any of his usual anger. The ice has cracked, revealing the deep sadness underneath. Steve’s voice shakes when he says, “I never asked for that. I never wanted it.”
Sighing, Miles leans forward, resting his elbows against the table. “So, what’s the plan?”
they’ve been through, how could Tony be such a fucking coward? Wasn’t he the one who said that he’d do it all again if given a choice? That he doesn’t regret his actions? So, why then, does he act so regretful?
“Do you want me to lie down?” Tony immediately nods, long, long, tail swooshing in clear delight.
!” Steve insists, a tiny bit of his usual fire creeping into his voice because he needs Tony to understand. When he opens his eyes, he finds his gaze filled with the sight of Tony’s pleading expression. For a split second, Steve finds himself stumbling but he’s quick to regain his footing and continue. “I know what kind of person you are. You’re a stubborn asshole who’ll sell his soul if it meant keeping his people safe. You’re the best of us, Tony.”
“But they need someone to help! If we leave them on their own, they’ll probably
,” Steve rumbles, pressing his mouth to Tony’s hair. “Just perfect, Tony.”
Tony’s yellow eyes shine like topaz in the soft glow of the lamp. Despite being a cat, the man hasn’t lost any of his gracefulness or his expressive expressions. He looks huffy and sleepy at the same time. He shifts out of his curled position, flexing his claws before rising up on all fours, back arching sharply. Assuming that Tony’s going to face away from the light and go back to sleep, Steve looks around the bed. He reaches for the quilt and grabs it right as the bell on Tony’s collar chimes sweetly.
Tony’ll have to schmooze up to, or vice versa, if he lets the committee give the seat away to someone else.
“I just don’t get why it should be us. I mean,” Sam says as he grips his drink with both hands. “What’s the point of it, you know?”
The teasing glint fades from Tony’s eyes, replaced with a curiosity that has Steve swallowing and turning his attention down to the forks he should be cleaning up. There’s also the empty bowls and place mats, and someone should wipe the table down too. And Steve’s pretty sure they’ll have to sweep the floor clean too because at one point Clint’d thrown some peas at Tony and Steve’s dead certain a couple of those green balls must have rolled off into a corner of the room.
Steve opens his mouth to say that he’s here to make sure Tony’s okay but before he can say it, Tony’s saying, “Steve!”
For the quickest of moments, Tony mourns the fact that Amara’s broken up with him. Everything turns dark and dull as he recalls her gentle words. “I’m sorry but I don’t see this working out in the long-term,” she’d told him, fingers clasped on top of the table, sending clear signals that she wouldn’t appreciate it if Tony tried to take her hand again. “I have my own work and you’ve got your own. What we had was amazing and I wouldn’t change it for the world. However...”
A tiny amused huff precedes the tremor that runs through Tony. He turns in Steve’s arms so that they’re face to face. Tony’s smile is tiny but it’s there and Steve’s the one responsible for it. “I could make a sausage joke but I’m gonna be the bigger man.”
But. If Tony’s being mind controlled, there’s no way Steve can show his hand. Whoever’s using Tony can’t know that Steve’s already onto them. He can’t let the other party know that he’s onto them.
“That’s true. Holy shit, Steve.” Tony shakes his head, smile growing and growing until it’s a broad happy grin. “Okay.”
In fact, that’s not something they’ve properly discussed as of yet. Is it okay for Tony to tell their friends that they plan on going out? Does Steve want to be fully out or will he prefer to keep their relationship private? For his part, Tony wants their friends to know and doesn’t want to keep Steve a secret. At the same time, it feels a bit like jumping the gun. They have to go out on a date first.
Tony thinks as he faceplants into the luxurious sheets, glad he decided to take a shower before going vertical.
Steve’s on the verge of sleep when Tony whispers, “Was it okay?”
“This spell strips away every inhibition placed around a person’s heart. There’s no reason not to share their feelings. I know what’s right and what’s wrong. I haven’t lost that. My feelings? They’re the thing that's front and center. No barriers, no excuses. Just the truth.”
would eat Steve alive.
Ducking his head so that Steve can meet his lover's gaze, Steve tells him, voice insistent. “It wasn’t. You didn’t know what was going to happen. And I’ve
He has to put his fingertips on Steve’s mouth to make him stop. And as he does so, Steve jumps in surprise. Tony grins faintly up at the man. When he’s sure that Steve’s not going to start rambling again, Tony asks, “Was his arm hanging like this?” Tony holds his arm up at a 90 degree angle and lets his forearm dangle. Steve nods immediately. “Yeah. That’s a design flaw I never fixed. He just knocked the joint out of place. He’ll be right as rain in two minutes when I get down to the lab. You wanna help me with that?”
Tony’s been in love with him. He leans forward, wanting to kiss Steve and whisper love confessions against Steve’s tongue but Steve stops him with a gentle hand to Tony’s neck.
A small part of Steve’s mind points out. Another part of him is just as quick to wonder if Tony’s fallen off the wagon again. That would certainly explain this sudden show of sentimentality
Tony hurriedly shakes his head. He needs to nip this awful idea in the bud. “Oh God, please don’t give him the shovel talk.”
!” she interrupts, staring up into his surprised eyes. “If you had the choice to be his best friend again. Would you take it?”
Tony looks away but not before Steve sees the guilt creeping in. With a gentle touch, Steve guides Tony to meet his gaze again. Tony follows but his eyes remain downcase, shameful. Jeez. Okay. This is a hurt Tony’s still holding close to his heart.
“Just a sec,” she says, bouncing up to the fence when she sees Vision floating up to them. “Are we leaving?”
It feels a bit like moving through molasses when Tony slides his hands under Steve’s shoulders to push the heavy coat off. One layer down, too many more to go. Steve’s hands come to land on his waist and reel him back in.
Steve shakes his head hard, stepping forward to touch Tony’s elbow. “I wanted you to pick
“What about my beard?” Tony asks as he carries
“Steve’s been pretty clear on where he stands,” Tony points out, voice tightly controlled to keep from letting his hurt show.
Another swallow from Steve, harsher this time around. The steering wheel creaks again, dangerously loud. Somewhere deep in his brain, Tony realizes that
But it’s too late. Steve’s up in a flash, grabbing a robe from the closet before he cracks the door open. Tony throws his head back with an annoyed groan and loudly,
“I’m going to wine and dine you, Rogers,” Tony says firmly. Kamala stuffs her nose against the pillow and exhales noisily. She sends out a mental cry for help, hoping that there’s at least one telepath in her vicinity. “I plan on wooing the fuck out of you.”
Message delivered, the android floats away, resuming the search for the magical ring. Kamala and Miles share a look before she shrugs helplessly. They’ve waited this long, what’s another ten minutes on top of that.
It’s the care with which Tony touches him that breaks the spell.
that. It’s like... I guess regret?”
It’s a short ride up to the penthouse and Tony grins the entryway through. Steve’s fingers slip out of his grip once the elevator comes to a stop. It occurs to Tony that this is the first time Steve’s been here. Tony hangs back and watches Steve look around the penthouse. It feels good to have Steve in his space. In fact, now that Steve’s here, carefully running his fingers over the back of the sofa, Tony wants to invite him to move in. But that
“There’s no fucking turkey for you.” Bucky matched the serious tone.
Suddenly Peter was looking up at Flash. He must have fallen to the floor from that last hit. Boot made contact with his rib. So much for trying to make it to class with his ribs not hurting. “Trying to make me look like an idiot, huh?!” Flash yelled.
Before he could protest, Bucky waved to him and pointed to his motorcycle. “I’ll meet you there!”
Peter quickly came over and smiled, taking in Harry’s outfit. “I still think we are all overdressed.” He chuckled. “But you look great.”
He cleared his throat quickly and smiled. “Hey Gwen. It’s Peter.”
The sound of Tony grunting into the receiver made Peter roll his eyes. "If you say so. It's not like you to get up early. Just so long as it's not drugs...is it drugs?"
Smiling, Gwen took the folder from him and took out the pictures. “Wow, these are really beautiful.” She gasped as she flipped through them.
“Good, so am I. I’ll pick you up. Stay by the Cyclone.” With that he hung up.
Once more Peter went to say something but nothing came out, his eyebrows raised. He took a deep breath and smiled, shaking his head a bit but not enough to say no. “I didn’t--I mean if you want…or there, so--it’s up to you really--that place is really nice.” He leaned off the lockers and swayed on his heels.
Peter still wasn’t ready to say he was going somewhere with anyone. He knew it was just Tony being protective of him because of what happened. But he didn’t want them to put their two sense in. For some reason, it boiled Peter’s blood. That’s what made shit hit the fan last time. “By myself, dad. I’m going out by myself. Can I go now?”
Gwen nodded her head and took a few steps back. “Yep. Okay, see you later.” She turned on her heels and walked away, taking a glance back and smiling at him once more.
"I love you too." Peter said even though the lines were disconnected. Putting his cellphone down, Peter sighed and pushed his keyboard away. "Don't you dare cry. You're too old for that." Peter half yelled at himself as his hands rubbed his face vigorously.
She giggled on the other end. “Of course. Where are we meeting up?”
Peter felt his face heat up for the millionth time that night as he walked over to Gwen. They stood close together as he held the camera out in front of them and snapped a picture. They shared a laugh and took a few more on Gwen’s command. A funny face picture, a cheesy smile one, a serious one. After that, Peter began leading Gwen to the pizzeria. “Thanks for coming with me. It was really fun.” Peter said as he shut off his camera.

It was like a dream come true. Her number in his phone and his in hers. It just all seemed so cereal. “Um, are we still on?” He found it easier to talk to her on the phone rather than in person where he had to keep himself from blushing.
It only ever seemed he had no clothes when he actually wanted to dress nicely. Meeting with Gwen shouldn't be this nerve wrecking. But for Peter it was proving to be so. Even though they've gone out before, something about the holidays made it seem a bit more romantic to him. Figuring they'd have coats on, it didn't really matter what he wore underneath. He grabbed a white t-shirt and black sweater, closing his closet door with a bit of disapproval at it. It didn't do him much justice this time.
“You’re right. This is your battle. Just...do the right thing.” Steve fixed his cap and took his keys out of his pocket. “I’ve got to get back. But this conversation isn’t over young man. Room, now.”
Peter felt his stomach sink. There goes another L on his attendance mark and his loving military father was going to have a fit. He opened his textbook to the assigned page and laid his head down, suddenly not caring about the lesson. This teacher had it out for him. Ever since that time Peter corrected him on a math problem which the teacher was positive was his way or no way. But Peter was smart and knew the teacher was wrong. So in front of everyone, he proved the teacher wrong. Ever since then, the teacher has grabbed any little excuse to get Peter into trouble.
Slowly, the fireworks became less until they stopped and the cart door opened for them to exit. The train rides home were peaceful for the time of night. First they took Gwen home. Then Peter insisted on getting Harry back to his place safely. Now on the train alone, Peter felt at peace.
Taking his seat, Peter watched as Flash got up from his seat with only a minute left of class to get his work checked off. Grabbing his bag and shoving his books into it, Peter watched as the teacher looked over the work and shook his head. He’ll have to run to his next class if he didn’t want to go home with a black eye. Flash turned to glare at him, and Peter couldn’t help the smirk that came onto his face. Now Peter watched the clock as Flash returned to his seat. Ten seconds to go. He was already halfway off his seat. The sound of books being shoved quickly into a bag behind him. Five seconds.
At this Peter looked up at the man who now had his back turned to him. “What?! But I made it in the classroom before the bell rang!” He watched as the teacher, along with the rest of the class turned to look at him.
With a smile, Peter put his phone on the charger and headed off to bed. He was excited to spend the summer with his girlfriend and boyfriend, with both of his dad’s home and safe, it was going to be an exciting summer vacation.
Tony gagged behind them. “Alright, move it along, before Steve starts cadencing us out the front door.”
“Peter!” She responded and he was certain she was smiling into the receiver. “Gotta save your number into my phone.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m sure he was.” Bucky said, never taking his eyes off of Harry.
"Kinda the same old stuff." Gwen said as she dunked the small spoon into her cup of ice cream. Despite the cold weather, she and Peter had stopped at one of the many stands out on Union Square and got ice cream. Every year around the holidays, the place by the park would fill up with lights and booths selling holiday gifts. And some treats for the shoppers. She ate the chocolate ice cream as she spoke. "Ever since I was a kid I worried if my dad would come home or not." Gwen said before looking up at Peter; searching for understanding.
Gwen said her goodbye, Peter waved, and she left the bathroom. Peter hung back for a bit, relishing in the kindness of this girl whom he never thought would give him the time of day in any situation. Also in hopes that by standing here the swelling in his face would go down. Placing his backpack on the floor, Peter lifted his shirt to see his ribs and parts of his stomach were bandaged. His face grew hot and he felt embarrassed all over again. Gwen had patched him up while he was unconscious. Or maybe he was awake, he just couldn’t remember. The point is she had seen him practically shirtless. Peter felt a large amount of hate for himself at that moment.
The future is and should be bright, but, like our brief four years in high school, what makes life valuable is that it doesn’t last forever, what makes it precious is that it ends. I know that now more than ever. And I say it today of all days to remind us that time is luck. So don’t waste it living someone else’s life, make yours count for something. Fight for what matters to you, no matter what. Because even if you fall short, what better way is there to live?
Steve cleared his throat. “I thought we agreed on him continuing his education at a good school?”
Looking up, Peter held back his most inner thought. She said the last few weeks. That means she noticed him. Watched him. Probably not as much as he watched her, but she noticed and that was enough to make Peter smile a mile wide at her. “I got my camera back.” He felt sheepish as the words came out his mouth. He gave a small laugh and fingered the camera a bit. “Uh, I mean I didn’t lose it or anything. I just hadn’t really had the muse to take photos lately.” He bit his bottom lip.
Laughing, Peter wrapped his arms around the slightly taller guy. "I missed you too, Uncle Bucky. Merry Christmas." He said before letting go and pointed to the food he had brought. "Mashed potatoes, gravy, and stuffing. Couldn't get my hands on any cranberry sauce."
Raising an eyebrow, Gwen held up her hand. “How many fingers am I holding up?” She asked.
Gwen smiled and then continued to flip through the pictures, laughing at the ones with both of them making funny faces. She stood a bit too long on the one of him and her smiling. “It looks so natural.” She stated. “Our smiles, you know. Not staged in front of a camera. But natural.” She looked up at him.
Walking downstairs, Peter entered the kitchen where he found Tony over the stove, an apron over his suit minus the jacket, and Steve at the counter dicing up tomatoes in his own uniform minus the jacket. He didn’t speak as he watched them for a moment. There was no memory of these two ever cooking at the same time and as of late years, either of them cooking at all. Especially not dinner. Crossing his arms, Peter leaned against the wall and cleared his throat, grabbing both of the male’s attention. Tony smiled and motioned to the cabinets. “Care to set the table.” It wasn’t a question but more of a do-this-now demand.
“Are you going to be okay?” He asked, now thinking about how far they were from her home. There was no time to drop her off first. Bucky sounded too serious; Peter needed to get home now.
Goosebumps traveled up Peter’s arms and he nodded his head with a crooked smile, taking his camera from around his neck and handing it to Gwen. He faced her toward the house and stood behind her, guiding her hands on the camera and glad she couldn’t see the blush on his face, because he knew he was redder than a beet. “You twist this here to zoom in. Twist the second one to get it into focus.” He spoke right next to her ear lowly. Peter doesn’t know what was coming over him, but he felt this boost of confidence to be this comfortable with Gwen.
Tony laughed a bit on the other line. “You saved me some food right?” He asked.
It was a sure fact that Steve was shocked to see his son up before himself, but he felt proud and delighted and they made breakfast together. Tony had walked down the stairs into the smell of eggs, toast, and bacon. Though he nagged about not smelling coffee, he thanked his family for the meal before heading off to work. Steve had done the same and Peter was last to leave the house. Still, it was a hell of a lot earlier than he was used to. So here he stood now in front of the school to a practically empty parking lot.
After a shower, Peter lay in his bed Jarvis taking up most of the leg space, and grabbed his phone. He texted both Gwen and Harry that he had made it home in their group message.
Peter sat between Gwen and Harry, currently speaking to Gwen while Harry had a heated debate with Tony about something scientific; though Peter was glad to see them getting along. Steve was speaking with Captain Stacy and his wife, one officer to another it seemed.
Laughing, Peter took another bite from his own pizza. “Oven baked really gets the flavor in it.” He felt accomplished that Gwen liked the pizza. This was a good thing. She had fun taking pictures and now she was enjoying dinner. Yes, this was really good. They spoke as they ate their pizzas and once they finished Peter pulled over the bag of Zeppole. “These treats are simple but awesome. They are messy though.” He handed one to Gwen and took one for himself.
“Well, I’m sure they all will.” He smiled at her.
Peter blinked a few times, not realizing his eyes were closed in the first place. He looked around to the empty hallways and then up at the person sitting beside him. “Gwen…Stacy?” He asked, attempting to sit up but feeling his head spin like crazy and lay back down.
He was amazed that she understood his world of photographic meaning. He tried to say something, but it ended with just his mouth opening and closing a few times before he smiled and nodded his head a few times. When Gwen nodded her head as well, they both broke out into small laughter. Peter seemed to relax a bit and let his shoulders drop. “Yeah, that’s the exact concept I was aiming for.” He finally said, all of it coming out smooth and not in a fit of broken words and stutters.
Steve followed quickly behind, grabbing his keys from the bowl. “Hey that’s not a bad idea.”
By the time class finished, Peter knew more about Gwen then the topic the whole class just discussed. Gathering up his books, Peter stood up and made to leave the room. Gwen caught up to him quickly, walking along beside him with a smile. "But you showed me how." She said to him without looking directly at him.
Peter took his time as he finished up his own work and then Flash's. The longer he took to hand in the work, the larger his head start will be. With only a minute left, Peter turned in his seat and handed Flash the paper before rushing to the front desk to hand his in to the very unamused teacher. Once his paper was marked off, Peter returned to his seat and scooped all his belongings into the bag just as his bully went to the front desk. The bell rang and Peter was out the door the moment the teacher looked down at the paper.
Peter took the paper and shoved it in his pocket. “Right, cool.” The bell rang loudly over their heads and Peter realized just then that the hallways were filled with many students now all scrambling to get to class on time. “So, seven. Phone. I’ll call you.”
"That's alright, I've got a can in the cabinet." Bucky said as he grabbed the container and led the way into the kitchen. "Is all of this store bought or did you actually manage to cook some of it?"
"Merry Christmas, pop." Peter smiled into the receiver as he leaned to pull on his pants. "Dad got me a puppy! A husky! His name is Jarvis." At the mention of his name, Jarvis jumped off the bed and rushed over to Peter's legs.
No matter how buried it gets, or lost you feel, you must promise me, that you will hold on to hope and keep it alive. We have to be greater than what we suffer. My wish for you, is to become hope. People need that. I know that we all think we’re immortal, we’re supposed to feel that way, we’re graduating.
“No, Uncle Bucky, it’s ok.” Peter grabbed onto his uncle's arm and pulled him back. “He was just here to send his good wishes. He was leaving.” Peter looked at Harry with pleading eyes. His uncle would not stand for Harry staying there to support him. Uncle Bucky was there for him through his depression after the incident. He knew how hurt he was.
Before the sun set completely, the trio made their way to the Wonder Wheel. Harry got them to the express line, so they were on quickly. They had reached a little after the very top when the fireworks started. The scene was beautiful, the lights sparkling in the skies, the ocean dark behind it. Peter held onto their hands tightly, feeling that if he let go the moment would pass too quickly. So long as he held their hands, this moment would last forever.
Of course, Bucky wasn't Peter's real uncle. But he was close enough to the real deal. Steve and Bucky, real name James, had grown up together in Brooklyn and both had joined the army once they were of age. The two had remained close friends even though their respected MOS were different. Tony knew Peter's real parents well and so when Peter was adopted by Steve and Tony after his real parents put him up for adoption, Bucky had helped the then newly married couple settle and would often babysit Peter. Everything had gone smoothly with the adoption, though Tony never likes to talk about it. When Peter started school, it was often Bucky who picked him up and helped him with his homework. His job in the military didn't demand his immediate attention. But when it did, Uncle Bucky would be gone for months at a time without a single word. Not even Steve knew where James would go or for how long. His orders came from farther up. As a kid, Peter swore his uncle was a super-secret spy. He still stands by that to this day.
Peter gave himself another prop in his mind. Picture fun, good dinner, and delicious snacks. This night was turning out better than he could have ever hoped for. Once they were done, they thanked the chefs and left, arm in arm, back into the cold. They walked back to the train, talking about school and what they had planned for the holidays. They rode the six train together, taking a few more pictures. “What stop do you get off on?” Peter asked her as he placed his camera back around his neck.
"Yeah. Of course." He said. The two hung up and Peter grabbed his coat, keys, and the scarf Gwen had lend him before leaving the house.
Peter rang the doorbell with his free hand, quickly retreating to the warmth of the underside of the plastic container he was holding. The door opened a few moments later and Peter smiled a mile wide. "Letting your hair grow out? At this age? Really?" He questioned the man who opened the door.
He knew who Tony was referring to. Looking down, Peter shook his head slightly. He hadn’t thought about him in a long time. In the last year, Peter chose to focus on school and not pay attention to what had happened. “N-no, dad. He’s gone.” His words were just loud enough to be heard.
Peter is unsure of anything. If Tony will be okay, why Harry is back, if Steve knows. What will happen if worst comes to worst?
Steve on the other hand, dropped his fork onto the plate and sat back in his chair. “This sucks.” Closing his eyes for a moment, Peter looked over at Steve and raised his eyebrows. Sighing, Steve picked his fork back up and smiled at Tony. “I’m just messing with you. It’s…good.” He twirled some more strings around his fork and took his time in bringing it back up to his lips.
Nodding, Steve took a step back and sighed. “I see. Well, we’ll just have to give this Flash kid a little scare now, won’t we?”
Peter stopped her to point out certain things on the pictures. He pointed out the ones that she took, saying how amazing they were for her first time. She paused on one of her, the house behind her was dimmed so that the lights shined around her as if she was glowing. Peter cleared his throat when she looked up at him, he didn’t meet her eyes. “That…that one was, uh, very nice.” He spoke slow and low.
“Yes, he is.” Gwen said, as she surprise hugged Harry from behind. “He doesn’t have a choice. We are all going.”
“Hey, we are all gonna hang out, I’ll see you at home?” Peter said, handing his blazer and tie to Steve who put them neatly in the bag.
Putting his phone frantically in his pocket, Peter rushed over to Gwen. “I’m so sorry, I have to go. Something is wrong at home. I’ve gotta get a cab.” He gave her a hug and apologized over and over again.
Peter opened the front door and ushered the reluctant dog inside. Kicking off his boots, Peter made his way into the kitchen. "Morning dad." Peter said when Tony was spotted at the stove.
A bit of silence before Tony cleared his throat. "I have to work Christmas Day as well. But, I'll come in early and we'll have Christmas dinner together! Or we can go to your dad's base and eat there." Tony offered.
He stretched and pulled the blanket off of himself, revealing Jarvis to the sunlight. “Sorry there buddy. But come on, rise and shine! Gotta take you for a walk.” He told the puppy and then headed off to get ready.
Peter rushed over to his seat as the ceremony began. It was long, and he began dozing off every now and again. First they did awards, the classmate next to him nudging him awake when he was awarded the science award; as well as the photography award. Eventually it became time for the valedictorian's speech and Peter sat upright, his phone out to record.
Nodding, Bucky seemed to accept that as an answer and turned his attention back to the game. “Well, if anything happens just let me know. I have no problem putting that punk in his place.” They had played for quite some hours when Bucky’s phone went off. Ignoring Peter’s quick questions of who was it and if it was his next mission, Bucky answered the phone. “Hey Stark. Shut up Peter, it’s your dad.”
Bucky stuttered into the speaker for a moment. “Listen, take a taxi. I’ll pay for it when you get here.” The sound of sirens sounded through the receiver. “Hurry up.” With that the call was dropped.
Gwen seemed to not have noticed, or maybe she did but kept her thoughts about it to herself. "Good then. I'm holding you to that. So! Where are you going for Christmas dinner?" She asked just as they were freed from the festive area.
For a moment, Peter swore his heart was going to burst out his chest. Though that didn’t happen, he knew his face was embarrassingly red. “I’m happy you like it.” He said in relief, leaning back in his seat and taking a sip of his hot chocolate. Things seemed so perfect, so relaxed. Gwen was every bit amazing and beautiful as he had always imagined. A good way to spend the day.
Smiling brightly, Gwen swayed on her feet. "Okay. Okay good. I'll text you on Christmas and let you know what time. I mean, I was going to text you on Christmas anyways. But...I'm rambling." She laughed just as the bell rang. "We're late. I'll see you later Peter!" Gwen waved as she rushed off down the hall.
“Peter.” He replied, closing his eyes once more, but the snaps woke him up quickly.
Peter looked to her hand. “One of those punches must have messed up my glasses.” He said sheepishly. In truth, the room was spinning and all he wanted to do was go to sleep. It was a nanosecond later that cold water was being splashed on his face. Peter woke with a start and stood up abruptly. He looked around to see he was in a school bathroom. The worst part was it was the girl’s bathroom. “What?” He asked, suddenly feeling wide awake as the cold water dripped down to his shirt, making his chest feel cold.
“Thank you, sir.” Peter looked over to Tony, his sunglasses hiding his eyes. “Are we gonna go eat now? I’m starving.”
No one else actually cared.
"Never really good at writing. English class isn't my best subject." Peter playfully retorted. They had stopped walking and now looked at each other in comfortable silence.
Peter quickly got out and rushed over to the back of the truck. A tall man tried to stop him, but Peter shoved past him and climbed into the back. “That’s my father! Dad?!” Peter quickly grabbed onto Tony’s hand. His eyes were shut and he had an oxygen mask attached. “What’s going on? What happened?!” Peter looked to the emergency response team as they climbed into the truck and started closing the back doors.
Holding up his free hand in mock surrender, Peter chuckled. "After Christmas and before New Year’s I'm all yours." He laughed before blushing at his choice of words. "I-I mean, I'm coming...I'll be there! For dinner, that is. After Christmas but--and it'll be fun." Peter decided to stop speaking before he dug himself any deeper.
“I need you to get home. Now. I’m here with your dad. Just...come home.” Bucky spoke into the receiver, obviously trying to stay calm.
Peter could hardly hear the words coming out his mouth, but he understood them. Even the cheers from the crowd seemed distant. “You…are an idiot…Flash.” Peter managed to choke out.
Peter’s phone buzzed in his pocket and he dug for it. His uncle’s picture popped up on the screen and he automatically answered it. “Excuse me a moment.” He said to Gwen as he stood up and walked a few paces away. “Hey Uncle Bucky. What’s up?”
DFac is military short word for Dining Facility!
Bucky nodded his head and paused the game. “Your dad is outside.” He hung up the phone and stood up. The two got the food and Peter’s jacket. “Come by anytime, you little nerd.”
Bucky seemed unhappy with the short replies to his questions, but decided not to get into it. Peter was always open to him so if there was something, Bucky would let Peter decide when and how he wants to tell him. After all, the last time something happened, Peter came straight to him even before going to his parents. So he turned the subject a bit back to school topics. “Any science fairs coming up?” He asked as he pressed the buttons on the controller a bit harder as the game intensified.
Peter looked up to the ceiling, the smile never leaving his face. It wouldn’t even if he tried. “I was thinking around east midtown. They have a bunch of houses there that decorate every year.” He looked back down at her, holding his books in one arm and keeping his other firmly in his pocket.
Gwen slid her arm into his and giggled. “It was fun for me too. I can’t wait to taste this pizza you spoke of.”
The smile that spewed across his features was immaculate. Peter let out a small laugh as he took the picture from her hands and looked at it carefully. "Except for one thing." He said, looking up to see her waiting expectantly. Turning the picture over, he held it out to Gwen so she could take it back. "You took this picture, Gwen. Not me."
The teacher gave them a set of problems to do and then sat at his desk. Peter set to doing the work in his notebook quickly, wanting to complete them so he could nap the rest of the track. Another nudge on his back told him this was going to be anything but a smooth class today. Peter turned around once more. “What, Flash?” He asked just above a whisper.
Sighing, Peter slowly rose up into a sitting position. He rested his chin in his palm and stared at the board. All this was easy. Peter had his father, Tony, to thank for teaching him a bunch of complicated stuff early on. He grew a love of science thanks to Tony. So math seemed to come naturally to him since it shared a link with science so often. Peter felt a rough nudge on his back and he sighed, turning around slightly to see his school bully smirking at him. Peter rolled his eyes and turned back around.
“It’s a piece of shit.” Tony said as he descended the stairs. He made his way into the kitchen and started making coffee. “I keep telling you to buy a new one.”
"Wonder if they'll even show up to my graduation." Peter mumbled to himself.
I know it feels like we’re saying goodbye, but we will carry a piece of each other into everything that we do next,  to remind us of who we are, and of who we’re meant to be. I’ve had a great four years with you, and I’ll miss you all very much.”
“Good, at least one of us does.” Peter said, furious that Tony seemed to not think that his health was at risk. “You know what, dad? I can’t anymore. You do this to yourself! You pour this out. I’m going out, and if something happens, don’t call me.” With that, Peter left the room and rushed out of the house.
Peter arrived to school on time thanks to his father’s crazy fast driving. He shoved his winter coat and scarf into his locker and pulled out all the books he’ll be needing for his morning classes. Slamming his locker shut, he ran down the halls, sliding a few times on the melted snow filled floors. He barged into the classroom just as the bell rang, getting the attention from the teacher and all of his classmates. Quickly feeling his face go red, he looked down and made his way to his seat. Sitting down, he didn’t bother to look up at the teacher who he knew was still watching him.
The meal was filled with chatter and idle conversation. Harry and Tony ignored everyone else as they began speaking mechanics and Peter know Harry had finally won Tony over. Soon the food was gone, the bill was paid, and they all left the restaurant.
Peter nodded quickly, guiding her hands to new spots on the camera. “This is to set the mode. This is to shut on and off the flash. And this is to take the picture.” He let her go and took a few steps back. “Angle however you want and take the picture when you feel it’s right.”
“Oh gosh pops, please don’t.” Peter knew that Steve wasn’t afraid to teach a person a lesson or two. He’s done it before.
His phone started buzzing on the desk as his inexpensive ringtone played. The little Spider-Man jingle always made him smile, but right now he was reluctant to get up and answer. When the culprit on the other line seemed to hold strong that he would answer or would leave a message, Peter rolled off the bed and hopped over to his phone.
Peter shook his head quickly. “No thanks. I don’t need to be showing up to school in your truck.”
“I will.” Peter said as he hugged his uncle and then rushed out into the cold. Getting into the car, he buckled his seat belt and waved goodbye as Tony pulled the car away. “How was work?” Peter asked as he sat back in his seat.
With the ceremony finally over, Peter found his dads and Harry, giving them all a hug as well. “Here, this is for you. Hang it up, put it in a bin in the attic, I don’t care.” Peter joked as he handed his diploma and awards to Steve.
“Sure.” Peter skipped over to the kitchen to grab the bag. Taking in the moment, Peter watched as his dad’s helped each other look their best. Brushing off lint on blazers, putting stray hairs back in their place. It all seemed so normal. With a content sigh, Peter decided that what he was looking at is normal. That maybe one day, society would understand their family is just as strong as any other.
"Hey." Gwen responded on the other end. The first thing Peter noticed was that she didn't sound like her chipper self. Her voice cracked a bit and was horsed deeply.
Scooping up his phone, Peter pulled the sweater over his head and placed the phone against his ear. "Hello?" He answered.
Peter took the money and thanked his father before leaving the house and speed walking to the train. He didn’t want Gwen to get there before him and have to wait in the cold and the dark, plus he needed to cool off before getting there. He was lucky to catch the F train just as he swiped his metrocard and took a seat. Fiddling with his camera, Peter made sure all the settings were correct and snapped a few pictures of the practically empty train. He’ll edit the people’s faces later.
The two adult males were quiet for a moment, watching Peter with interest. Giving each other another glance, Steve cleared his throat and got up from his seat. “Well good for her. But you left school grounds during school hours. Punishment, finish eating and then clean the dishes.”
She nodded her head and pursed her lips in approval. “Sounds like a plan.”
He hesitated a moment before he send another message.
Peter snickered and looked over to Tony in the kitchen. “Hey dad, remember when we had to fix the engine three times in one hour?” He asked then shoved another spoonful of cereal into his mouth.
“Out. But I have my phone, so I’ll call if anything.” With that, he waved off his dads and met back up with Gwen and Harry.
Together they walked to the road and said their goodbyes as they got into separate taxis. Peter took out his cellphone again but there were no text or any missed calls. It seemed whatever was going on, it was staying between him and Bucky. With a sigh, he could do nothing but wait until he got back home. When he got there, an ambulance was parked outside and the EMT’s were loading the stretcher into the truck. Bucky stood next to it, his arms crossed as he spoke to one of the EMT’s. The cab pulled up behind the truck and Bucky excused himself to pay it.
Sighing, Peter lay back in the snow covered sand. He stared up at the cloudy sky and wondered just how long he would be grounded for this time. After a good five minutes, Peter gathered his bag and began walking toward the roller coaster. He stood there at the corner for another three minutes before his father’s ‘classic’ truck pulled up. Peter got in, keeping his hood on and looking out the window as Steve drove.
Peter looked at the name and smiled. “Jarvis, huh? I like it.”
Pouting, Tony crossed his arms. “It was just one. Your less cool father said you were going out to take pictures?” When Peter nodded his head, Tony moved into the living room and motioned for Peter to follow. Taking a seat, Tony crossed his arms and eyed his son. “I know it’s not by yourself. It’s not with him, is it?”
Giggling, Gwen finished her ice cream and tossed the cup into the trash. "No, no. It was very inspiring. Practically poetic. Ever thought about writing, Mr. I-Don't-Want-To-Be-A-Photographer?" She told him with a smile.
Taking up his camera again, Peter stood in the middle of the parking lot and snapped a picture of the school building. It looked eerie this empty so early in the morning. The sun was up, but the clouds covering it gave it a gloom depressed look. Perfect for a high school. Peter smiled at the thought and took a few more shots. There were some soft footsteps behind him but he paid no mind, simply checking his camera, trying not to be caught taking pictures of the school. Others didn’t understand photography like him.
The two spoke in idle conversation. Talking about how much they ate for dinner last night and what they got from their parents. Gwen laughed when she heard the dog's name and nodded in approval. Peter was happy to hear that she had a good Christmas despite how upset she was the other day that her father wasn’t going to be able to join the family. Peter took a moment to wonder about Tony and hoped Steve called him. Lately there was such a strain on their little family. Maybe he should talk to his parents. Make sure everything was okay between them.
Steve acted as though he were seriously considering the argument before shrugging and looked around the room. “What’s all the noise up here anyway?” Steve finally asked, leaning against the doorframe.
“Where are you?” Steve replied roughly. Anger was clear in his voice, but Peter could hear the worry and panic in his voice as well.
Chapter 11
Gwen nodded and smiled up at him before linking their arms together and pulling them further into the depths of the dealer’s booths. "Alright Mr. Non-Writer. But you've already agreed to dinner after Christmas. Better not bail out on me. Got that?" She questioned and pointed a stern finger in his direction.
“Yeah, I’d like that.” She answered. “Thanks for tonight, and for walking me home.”
Nodding, Peter spoke of the first time his father’s took him there when he was smaller. Afterwards they would go to the movie theater across the street and Tony would always insist on bringing a pack of Zeppole from the pizzeria in as a snack. Gwen listened and laughed. Peter felt more comfortable than he did earlier with all of his negative thoughts. She was really cool. Way cooler than he had thought. And he was really liking her. Once they made it to the place, Peter ordered two oven baked slices and four Zeppole before he and Gwen took a seat. He felt happy that he could pay for the meal. It showed Gwen, he hoped, that he was a gentlemen and would never let a woman pay for a meal.
“Good night, Peter.” She gave him a hug before walking down the hall to her apartment.
“Yeah, okay, so I’ll see you in a bit.” When she agreed, they said their goodbyes and hung up. Peter shoved his phone into his pocket and grabbed his camera and wallet. He ran down the stairs and quickly got his sneakers on, grabbing his coat and keys.
The smile that spread across Gwen’s face was the brightest he’d had ever seen. “Peter Rogers-Stark, are you asking me out on a date?” She dropped her head a bit and looked up at him from under her eyelashes.
Thank you for the support!!!
Gwen shook her head. “No sleeping. Come on, we have to get you to the nurse.”
There was a knock on his door and Peter came to a halt. He hadn’t realized anyone else was home. Rushing over to the door, he opened it quickly. “What?” He asked once the door was fully open, regretting it the instant he saw Steve standing there, his eyebrows furrowed and his arms coming up to his chest, crossing over. Peter cleared his throat and swallowed a few times. “I mean, uh…yes, sir?” He asked in a rush of words.
Until the day wasn’t so good.
Smiling, Steve looked to Jarvis and patted his head. “You’re on duty. Guard your post.” He then locked the door and made his way to the car.
He entered the subway once more and took the long ride down to Coney Island. The amusement park wasn’t opened and normally you weren’t allowed on the beach this time of year, but Peter went anyways and sat on the snow filled sand. It soaked his pants, but he didn’t care. He tossed a few snowballs lazily and watched as the waves crashed onto the shore, melting the snow and revealing the dark brown sand underneath. As he stared out at the water, his phone began to vibrate.
Thanks for reading! Okay, now the story is being moved to Updates every 2 weeks. Happy Holidays!
Peter immediately recognized the voice as Gwen’s and he turned around quickly to see her standing just a few steps away from him. He smiled at her and waved a shy hand, letting his camera go so it hung once more. “Morning.” He said just above a whisper. He hated his shyness.
That lovely sound of her laughter touched Peter’s heart and he just stood there with a smile on his face. An idea hit him and his hands flew out of his pockets. “Hey, I’m going out snapping pictures of the holiday decorations tonight. Do you--” He stopped, his voice suddenly catching in his throat. Was he really just about to ask Gwen Stacy out? What if she rejected him? His face would turn beet red and then he’ll be way too embarrassed to even meet her eye to eye.
Steve was shocked to see Peter already walking out the door while he was just waking up. Something was wrong. Something was very wrong. In Steve’s mind, there was no way today was right. It wasn’t going to be an easy swell day. “Peter?!” He called just as the teen was about to close the door behind himself.
The footsteps continued and there was a soft laugh. “Those will have a lot of meaning behind them.” A soft voice said.
Glaring a bit at the other man and crossing his arms, Steve continued to bicker. “My sauce is awesome. You love my sauce.”
This could only mean one thing. The school called his parents and now one of them was calling to see where he was. If it’s Steve, it’s a loud phone call. If it’s Tony, it’s a calm but serious phone call. Pulling out his cell, he looked at the screen and cursed himself as a picture of Steve showed on the screen. He had to pick it up but he didn’t want to. In truth he was a bit scared. Sliding the green bar over, he placed the phone to his ear. “Hey dad.” He said, trying to keep the fear out of his voice.
Maybe he was being bold. Or maybe it was the initial shock that made him hit the answer button. Whatever the case, Peter rose the phone to his ear and stood quiet for a moment. "Hello." He said into the receiver rather than questioned. Caller ID was a beautiful thing.
Peter thought for a moment. As a kid he used to cry. Only an hour ago he had wanted to do the exact same thing. Then he got angry at himself for wanting to cry, and then Gwen had called. Yet that wasn't the case when he was younger. He and Gwen had only recently started speaking and hanging out. He thought for a moment more before finally giving her the best answer he could come up with. "The anger. Like I said before, you have every right to be angry. And you should be angry. Because it's something you should never have to accept. Your father putting himself in the line of danger is a risk. Never give in to the fact that it's 'just his job' cause then if something bad happens... 'just his job' won't deem him the hero he is. So be angry and never stop. In the end he knows it's because you're scared. And you're scared because you love him." Peter took a deep breath and laughed sheepishly. "Sorry, I didn't mean to preach." He scratched the back of his head as he spoke.
Nodding and shrugging his shoulders at the same time, Peter took another gulp of his water. “In his mind, it is. Anyways, I got my behind beat. But Gwen helped me patch up so everything is cool.” Wait, did he really just say her name? To his father's? Peter could feel his face fall as he slowly looked up at the two men whom exchanged a glance and then looked to Peter. He could already hear the millions of questions coming at him, but if he answered the first one right, he could change it from millions to just a few.
He got home and took Jarvis out for a quick walk. The house was quiet, when he arrived. Checking in on his dads, they were both asleep, the TV still on. Peter quietly searched for the remote and turned off the television, smiling as they didn’t flinch or wake at the lack of sound.
Rolling his eyes, Peter started eating his cereal. "It's Christmas vacation dad. Anyways, I'm going out tonight." Peter looked down at Jarvis who was waiting for something to fall from the table.
Story will soon move to being updated biweekly!
“Well, I’d love to see them when they are developed.” Gwen said, kicking at some snow.
“I’m not hungry.” Peter said as he sat down.
"Dad!" Peter flushed as he got the milk out and refused to look at his father. He didn't say anything else though. After all, Tony was right. Steve not being home was taking a toll on the poor guy. Even Peter wasn't as distraught. But for a married couple, military life is hard. Sitting down at the table, Peter placed a comforting hand on his dad's shoulder and smiled. "Don't take it personal dad. You know he would have been here if he could have been."
But he could feel the lump in his throat and no longer felt the grand desire to finish his homework early on. Getting up from his desk, Peter made his way over to his twin sized bed and dropped flat onto it. He wished he had grabbed his iPod from the table but didn't feel like getting up to grab it. Instead he pulled his pillow close to his chest and tried hard to breath evenly. There was no doubt Peter was going to cry. And why shouldn't he? He'd thought his fathers had learned from the many missed Christmas mornings and birthdays and school plays. But the older he got the less those things seemed to matter.
"What's wrong?" Peter asked immediately. A sense of protectiveness overcoming him and he was already putting on his winter boots.
With a light shove to his shoulder, Gwen smiled and held her ice cream cup with both hands as if warming them despite the cold. "You always seem to know the right thing to say, Peter. And I'm sorry. That was selfish of me." She said as she looked down into the cup. "Here I am saying how angry I am that my father calls and says he won't be home Christmas night for dinner. But he is going to be there in the morning. Your dad though...he won't be home until way past Christmas. And..." Her words had begun to trail off as Peter gave off a chuckle.
They transferred trains and then rode the second one for a while. Peter stood awake while Gwen fell asleep on his shoulder. He thought the day through and just kept feeling like the luckiest guy in the world. Here he was with the girl he’s been crushing on for four years trusting him. Spending a night out with him and sleeping on his shoulder as he took her home. Never in a million years did Peter think this would happen to him. But it is happening. Right here, right now, and he figured he literally was the luckiest guy in the world. If not luckiest, then damn sure he was the happiest. They were rounding her stop and Peter lightly shook her, calling her name softly.
The doors shut and locked, the sirens blazed on, and off they raced toward the hospital.
Peter quickly shook his head and pulled together all the energy he could muster and stood up. He hated school nurses. Not only did they never know what they were doing, but they would call someone to come and pick him up or inform them of what happened and the last thing he needed was either one of his father’s coming down here. Especially Steve. Peter had been humiliated enough for one day. “No, I’m okay really. Just late to class. And I made you late. I’m so sorry.” The words came out in a rush, stumbling over one another that he’s not sure if Gwen even heard them all.
“Will you have dinner at home or out?” Steve asked.
0o0o0o
The way the question was asked, Bucky sounded a bit concerned. It made Peter a bit unsure of how to answer the question. Was Oscorp not a good place to intern? “Well, it’s more for science whereas pops is all about machinery science. I really don’t want to know how to make weapons for the military. I have enough of that life at home. And I’m not going to let what happened stop me from getting possible scholarships into the programs and field I want to be in.” He sounded more honest than he thought he had been. Whatever worked.
"Don't you have school?" Tony spoke fast and low as he narrowed his eyes at the boy.
Unable to help it, Gwen laughed and took a few steps closer. “It’s no problem. But I wasn’t talking about the bruises. You look better. Happier than I’ve seen you in the last few weeks.” She came to a stop just in front of him now.
Thank you to everyone who has stuck with this story despite my long waited updates. The story has come to an end, and I am grateful for everyone who has given kudos, commented, bookmarked, or even just clicked on this story and read it.
Rolling his eyes, Bucky made an attempt to turn the focus of the conversation back onto Peter. "Come on! Details! Are you passing all your classes? Any friends? Girlfriend or maybe boyfriend? Whichever you prefer...maybe both if that’s still the case?" His line of questions came pouring out, forcing Peter to stay off the topic of his military job.
Harry sighed and leaned into her embrace a bit, relieved to be out of the spotlight from Tony. He soon turned to give her a proper hug and congratulate her. “So, how about that position at Oscorp? Felicia could use some help.”
Smirking a mile wide, Tony set his fork down and leaned back in his chair, water bottle in hand. “So, who’s this…Gwen?” He rolled the name out in a soft purr and giggled before taking a sip of water.
But he had to tell them something. And if he worked around this right, seeing how they already knew some of his history with Flash that he’s told them, he might get out of this with no punishment for leaving school grounds. He shoved some food into his mouth and chewed on it quickly, then took a large gulp of water. “Um, that Flash guy I told you about before, he uh, thought I called him an idiot.” He shoved another forkful of food into his mouth, letting this sink into his parent’s heads.
Shorter than the other 2 chapters, but it will pick up again in the next one!
Both boys turned quickly to the source of the yell. Bucky quickly came to stand in front of Peter, the bag of food tossed onto the seat. “What the hell are you doing here, huh? Get away from my nephew.”
The restaurant was packed but luckily the Stacy’s had made a reservation early on. It was still pretty early in the day, so it became more of a lunch gathering. They were seated at a round table and a different assortment of food was ordered so they could all share. Dishes were placed in the centerpiece which turned so it was easy to pass plates across the table. The environment was loud, but joyful and conversations around the table varied.
Sitting next to him, Bucky handed Peter a burger anyways. “Eat.” There was a silence for a while as they are. “Don’t you dare contact that kid. His number is blocked, leave it that way.”
“Me too.” He cursed himself under his breath for answering too fast. Looking around, he noticed the student body beginning to build up. “Well, I’ll see you later.” He waved quickly and rushed into the school. Peter gathered what he needed from his locker, his camera still around his neck as he rushed to class.
Either way, Peter chose not to go home. Instead he ventured to the subway and made his way to Times Square. He listened to a few street performers play their homemade instruments and tossed a few bucks into the hat that was on the floor in front of them. Then he walked around the crowded streets and sat on the TKTS red stairs.
When Peter shook his head and looked back out the window, the light turned green in his favor and Steve was forced to pay attention to the road. They were quiet the rest of the ride. The truck pulled up in front of their house and Peter grabbed his bag, opening the door quickly. “I’ll see you later.” He got out of the truck and shut the door, hurrying up the small steps to the door.
It took him a bit of time to get to South Street Seaport, but he seemed to arrive before Gwen. Taking the time to walk around the mall, Peter realized he hadn’t gotten Gwen a Christmas gift. Slightly cursing under his breath, he started going from store to store. Finally he came across a small shop with vintage looking accessories. Walking in, Peter browsed through the items in search of something she might like. Coming across a blue scarf with a white line design, Peter smiled and picked it up. “Perfect.” He said in a hushed breath.
"I may have taken those pictures. But it's because you showed me how. So it's your good eye that caught the image." Gwen was satisfied with her side of the argument and turned to face Peter, a whole new topic on her mind. "We go on Christmas vacation tomorrow. Do you want to maybe come over to my house for dinner? Not Christmas dinner. You have that with your family of course. But um, the day after. If you want that is." Her words were a bit rushed, but Gwen was overall happy.
That comes out a lot more muddled than he’d meant to, which is seriously counter productive to what he’s trying to say. But fuck! If Steve doubts his choice one more time, Tony’s going to do something stupid and reckless. Like sit on Steve’s dick.
Tony thinks, thoughts spirally wildly.
We.... not me. It’s such a small thing but even that stings. Steve clears his throat.
When they’d landed, Cap had quickly divided the team into two groups. The adults were going to take care of the magic-users and the teens were going to herd the animals as best as possible. They’d done their part, quickly herding the animals together in several clusters and stopping the teens responsible. But the magic ring that the perpetrators had used was lost somewhere in the building. Apparently the kids had ditched it before making their escape attempt.
“It might be,” Rhodey answers for Tony.
Dread steadily gathers in the pit of his stomach the closer he gets to the tower. It coalesces into a crackling storm, making it hard to breathe, when Sam warns him, as they ride the elevator up to the medbay, “He’s not himself. Just... don’t lose your temper, okay? Thor’s going to drag Enchantress back and she’ll make her undo this spell. In the meanwhile, we need to make sure that we don’t aggravate Tony. We need to keep him calm. Let him do what he wants."
Steve). Tony’s oldest friend and Steve loses at least 40% of his rationality when it comes to Tony.
Instead, he captures Steve’s lips in another kiss. Pleasant tingles race up and down Tony’s back at the contact. When he pulls away, Tony teases, “Takes one to know one.”
locked in a date. Given that it’s four days before Christmas, trying to get a reservation at any of his usual haunts had been challenging.
He doesn’t doubt a lot of his decision. That’s not the kind of person Steve is. But this feels wrong. Being on the outside instead of being part of the Avengers. The feeling intensifies to the point of nausea when FRIDAY greeting him with a smooth, “Welcome Commander Steve Rogers.”
Does he drag his metaphorical feet while filling the reports out because he hates the paperwork or because he knows what’s waiting at the bottom? Steve’s not sure. But eventually, there’s nothing left for him to do but glower at Tony’s letter.
“I’m not all the way in my heat yet. And just because I’m in heat doesn’t mean I lose
it is. It’s the coffee Tony makes when he’s having a bad day and he desperately needs a pick-me-up. It’s also kept hidden in a sealed jar deep in the coffee cabinet (mislabeled for increased security) because he doesn’t want the others getting their hands on it. How did Steve know where that coffee tin was is outside of Tony’s knowledge but what Tony
planned to be more suave but the reality of the date is sharper than expected. He’s incapable of maintaining an unaffected mask in front of Steve because the fact is, Tony is very much affected. Steve’s hand is warm and dry. His fingers are broad. The brush of his body against Tony’s makes heat gather in Tony’s center.
!” Kamala explains with barely controlled exasperation, “The Avengers aren’t the Avengers without Captain America and Iron Man there!”
to be suave when all he can think about, all he can focus on, is Steve. All the anticipation that he’s built up for tonight has transformed into awe. Suddenly, the night is too short. Dinner wasn’t enough. This show isn’t long enough. Tony wants to spend more time with Steve.
, the man falls asleep. Steve takes a nap of his own but it doesn’t take long for him to wake up again. He’s the type of person who needs a quick nap after sex and after that, he’s raring to go. But Tony has fallen well and truly asleep.
could this have happened? He should have known! He should have anticipated this because he knows his heat history and he should have planned accordingly! This is-
Kamala can’t stop herself from taking a quick peek at Tony. His jaw is tight with tension. He looks pissed. She quickly looks back down, stomach twisting uncomfortably for some reason.
Steve closes his eyes, overwhelmed by the scale of the confession. He gives in, raising his arms to hug and hold Tony against him. But as soon as his fingers touch Tony’s arms, the man twitches half a step away from him. Steve manages to grab onto Tony’s wrist, fearing that if he lets Tony walk away then they’ll be back in limbo, the way they were for the seven years before this mission.
The thought comes back to him when he sees Steve waiting for him outside the restaurant. Tony’s heart swells with love even as his stomach twists with nerves. Steve’s wearing crisp gray pants and a long coat. He’s shifting from foot to foot, eyes shifting restlessly over the sidewalk.
Damn the fact that they’re both incredibly busy people. It’s been hellishly annoying trying to find a date that works for them both. It’s been twelve days since Steve’s asked him out, yes Tony’s counting, shut up, and they’ve
“Kamala?” Tony’s voice interrupts her thoughts.
Steve waits for someone to come greet him or pass him. FRIDAY
“Control freak,” Steve says, fingers fiddling with the buttons on Tony’s shirt. There’s so much fondness coloring those two words that Tony feels the urge to click his heels in happiness.
Miles observes the trio for a few seconds before saying, “Can’t be anything good.”
They’re adults. They probably know better than to say anything too risque in front of her, even if she is ‘passed out.’ And if either of them
. Which is something Tony is only too happy to comply with.
“I might.”
“You fight, you knit, you bake,” Tony teases as gently as he can, picking up a cookie from the top of the pile. He takes a big sniff of em and sighs happily; they smell fucking fantastic. “Is there anything you can’t do Cap?”
“Captain America,” Kim greets, diamond earrings sparkling under the bright lights as she delicately tilts her head to meet Tony’s gaze. “Last I heard you were dating a scientist Tony. Is there anything you’d like to tell the rest of us?”
That yanks Steve out of his thoughts. He stares at Tony’s back in surprise and is about to ask why would Tony email
“Tonight,” Tony clarifies.
Because here’s the thing. It’s not that Steve’s doesn’t do nice things for him. It’s just that the whole
thought Tony was capable of. But holy shit, here he is! Sounding so adorably shy!
Wearily, Steve runs his hand through his hair and sighs. Silence descends on the med-bay. It occurs to Steve, far too late, that Sam’s left them alone. He briefly wonders when Sam had quietly exited the room and tries not to flush as he wonders if Sam left before or after Tony’s confession.
. That feels
That’s definitely a complication.
Carol gasps and shakes Rhodey’s shoulder, “Who? Do you know who it is?”
Tony remembers, feeling too big for his body. And steps forward.
. Steve’s floating up in the clouds. He’d forgotten that.
Tony opens his mouth to thank Steve and tell him no, it’s not something Steve can help with. But thankfully, his brain works faster and reminds him that
“It’s not something he seems interested in. After everything that happened... everything I did to him... I can’t blame him.”
“Done.”
His heart breaks in the face of Steve’s insecurity even as it swells with love. “I could never,” Tony answers, swearing, immediately and firmly. He seals his promise with a kiss.
that’s happened.”
He can help Steve into his jacket and accept the cheek kiss he gets in return with stunned disbelief. He can let himself be dragged out of the restaurant by a flushed Steve who asks how they’re getting to the Lincoln Center. He doesn’t have to hide the fact that he stumbles over his own feet when Steve links their hands together as he pulls Tony into a cab. He can stare in goofy wonder at Steve when he keeps holding his hand during the length of their journey to the show. He doesn’t have to pretend that he’s not affected when Steve laughs and kisses the back of his hand on their way into the Lincoln Center.
Steve takes a couple more steps back, walking backwards, feeling fit to explode with happiness as he sees Tony’s surprise melt away into wondering delight. Steve’s aware of the fact that he’s grinning like a goof but he can’t do much to stop it, especially when Tony’s lips turn up into a crooked happy smile of their own.
to where Tony is wettest, has Tony rolling his hips in return. “I’ve wanted you for years.”
, you know? Steve’s had this epiphany more than a couple of times now, but it does him in every time. Tony used to be his best friend. There was so much love between them and now there’s nothing left between them except anger, distrust, and fear.
Laughing, Steve pulls Tony back for another kiss, firmer this time but with just as tender and sweet. But they both break down smiling, a laugh bubbling out of Steve, when Tony rubs their noses together. Tony’s hands are warm against his back. His body firm and thrumming with energy underneath Steve’s palms.
feel comfortable going? He’d been worried that those questions, and more, would be a stumbling block. Thankfully, they hadn’t been. There had just been a bone-deep surety when Tony had pulled him into the bedroom with a smile and a promise that he was going to make it good for Steve.
“While we’re here, there’s something I wanted to ask you.”
Kamala thinks as she studies Steve. The cold front quickly turns thunderous the longer Tony speaks.
“I’ve got you,” Tony promises, stars flashing in front of his eyes when Steve thrusts once again and rubs Tony’s dick in the process. Fuck. His dick and front hole are going to be
“Hmm?” Steve asks, just a little love drunk and kiss stupid.
As Sharon explains that the letter is safe to open, Steve stares at the envelope face and wonders who the sender was. A second before he flips the letter over, Sharon tells him, “Don’t give into the temptation to throw the letter into the trash can.”
As Steve shakes Kim’s hand, Tony viciously stomps down on the green crawling up his throat. But that jealousy gets stuck, like a bone in his throat that won’t budget no matter how hard he swallows. He even presses a delicate fingertip against his Adam’s apple, wondering if maybe there’s a genuine physical obstruction in his throat but there’s nothing there. It’s all in his mind.
It’s so easy to give into his instincts: to kiss Steve, push him down, line them up, and sink down on Steve’s dick. It feels as easy as breathing. Easier maybe, to open his body completely to Steve,
. He just... needs to find the right person, that’s all.
It’s friction, sweet, tantalizing friction that makes them both moan. It’s perfectly frustrating, the way it’s good but not good enough. Steve kisses him, swallowing his moans down as he lowers his hips and drags their dick together again, this time with intent and that makes all the difference. Tony whines, hands desperately seeking an anchor even as his hips roll up, unwilling to let the sweet electricity of sexual pleasure fizzle away. His feet scrambling for purchase on the sheets. His hands slip against Steve’s skin, clutching at his back and then at his arms.
Steve gestures at Tony with one hand. “I’m not sure if there’s any other alpha’s in the crowd but I can smell it. Plus, you’re burning up. And you keep...” Soft pink blooms across Steve’s cheekbones. “You keep sticking close to me. It’s like you’re looking for someone to be with. And every time I pull away, your scent goes all unhappy and sour.”
“You won’t...” Steve hesitates, eyes flashing up to meet Tony’s gaze before they slip away again. “You won’t... think less of me... after... Right?”
“It adds up,” Tony explains with such gentleness that it pierces her heart. Kamala swallows and is amazed that she doesn’t taste blood. “All that poison builds up until there’s nothing left.”
“Steve…” Tony starts and stops, not sure how he wants to continue.
the embarrassing situations he’s found himself in around Steve, this one takes the cake.
“My love life is
spot on his neck that always makes his insides melt.
? And you still haven’t gone out on a date?” She holds her hand out in askance. “What the hell?”
Tony glances at her. Kamala quickly lowers her head and focuses on her homework. Mostly. She keeps one ear on Tony and his conversation.
“You mean Commander Rogers.”
, Kamala realizes.
“I guess you can always send them an email explaining that you’re sorry and you’d like to talk? There’s no guarantee they’ll see it but at least you’ll be extending an olive branch. If that doesn’t work out, there’s always writing her an actual letter and putting it in her locker. Can’t imagine it’ll be easy to ignore something like that.”
The suddenness of the inquiry, even though it’s not directed at him, makes Tony sputter. His best friends meanwhile, turn to give him identical curious looks.
And she relaxes, smiling at him like he’s offered her a gift. So Tony relaxes. He’s pleased to note that Kamala doesn’t seem distracted anymore. In fact, she seems more focused than ever before, throwing herself into training with vigor. She seems back to her usual cheerful self.
the forgiveness.
In answer, Cap had pulled his phone out and called SHIELD. Several black vans had pulled up outside the gates within minutes and black-clad agents quickly secured the perimeter. And just like that, they were on the side lines. And by they, Kamala meant Sam, Miles and herself. Vision, Cap, and Tony were helping SHIELD, and Thor had flown off to answer another call.
