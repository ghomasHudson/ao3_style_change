That fucking bloody footprint.
Tony’s eyes fell shut, and he let out a low, shuddering moan.  His heart thudded against his ribs, and his cock seemed to pulse in time with the rhythm.  Fuck.  He wanted Steve.   Needed him. Now.
“Thanks, Tony,” Steve finally said.  There was a crease forming between his eyes, and he kept bouncing his leg, making the plate on his lap move, in what Tony knew from experience was a nervous habit, something Steve did when he got himself wound in knots, like that night when Steve had bought them those terrible frozen crabcakes because he thought they were fancy, and put a white sheet over their table with a few red carnations in a glass, and spent the entire dinner trying to sit still, because—because--
of the dream-walking happening to other people.  When he was twelve or thirteen, old man Jones ended up in his neighbor’s pig pen three fields over once and swore it was just a bit of a waking dream, though the Reverend said it was because he had been weak with sin and let the spirits in and said he had to sit in that awful iron cage for a week to repent. Though, before that could happen, someone tore it down, bent it all up and put it on the Reverend’s doorstep one morning with a sign on it painted in red that Bucky swore was blood (though, Steve thought that was likely nonsense) that said it was “For Sinners”.
“No.  I just want to be clear that you are not, under any circumstances, to buy that man a hot tub just because he may have made a suggestion one day.  I mean it, Tony.  No hot tub,” Steve said firmly.
“Ah, a lost soul,” the man said.  “How...interesting.” Something about the way he spoke, the timbre of his voice, perhaps, set the hairs on the back of Steve’s neck on end and a spike of cold lanced through his gut.
to do with it, Steve. What I want very much.”
It didn’t make sense.  He knew it didn’t.   They weren’t doing anything to him.  Just looking.  It wasn’t anything.  He was being weird.  He hated being weird.  It was a compliment, really.  Wasn’t it?
“You did not fail me,” Steve replied.  “You did not, Tony.  This was not your doing.  You cannot blame yourself for what you did not know.”
“I’m a romantic,” Tony replied, then wagged his head side to side. “I’m a billionaire, who is a romantic. Look, take a goodie bag, open bar, all that, have fun, okay? I’ll just be—"
to reassure the garrisons inside that relief is in sight.  How many times does your scholar here relate some version of the phrase, ‘Seeing no hope of relief, they treated for surrender’?”
“You know, I think I was less wet when I was
“Rogers joins the seventh fresh out of high school, gets shipped off to sit and wait in bumfuck desert locale.  Doesn’t like that much. Goes to RASP.  Gets his Ranger tab.  Goes back.  In the middle of all that, gets a degree, picks up a few languages…Then, he gets tapped by SFAS—Special Forces Assessement and Selection Course--apparently on the urging of one Colonel Phillips,” Rhodey continued.  “Who I tracked down on a fishing boat down in Clearwater.”
“Truth be told, his parents have put out feelers. That’s why his file ended up on my desk, in fact,” Fury added, picking up the folder again and opening it to the page where Anthony’s photograph was clipped to a medical information sheet.
“May I see?” Tony asked, making Steve’s head snap up in surprise.  He nodded, stood, and walked over to where Tony sat at Lord Elllis’ desk, sliding the sketch on top of a small stack of letters.
He sounded strangely regretful about it, Tony thought, though it wasn’t like those efforts were public knowledge.  Tony much preferred to keep his arguments with the Secretary of State out of the papers for as long as possible.  Ross was going to pull the trigger one of these days, and then…then who knew what would happen, but at least whatever did happen, the fallout would be on Tony.  Not Iron Man. Not the team.  The team had to stick together, or Ross would pick them off, one by one, and this way…this way, it could be Tony who Cap got pissed at, because, yeah, no way was he going to go for what Ross was hinting at, but maybe, just maybe, he’d listen to Iron Man. They could figure it out, Tony told himself in his more optimistic moments.  They always did, him and Cap.  Even when they fought about something, they fought to make the other better, and they both knew it. Hell, they both all but looked forward to it, and he was never more certain than when they got to some point of agreement they could each live with.
“I’m not adopting your building.  I mean, I might be, but I’m resentful about it?  Maybe.  I don’t know,” Tony said, brushing past Steve into the warmth of the small apartment where the radiator hissed against a corner.  “Bad Grandpa’s not too bad.  Kids are okay, I guess. Wouldn’t want to run into them while riding my bike down the hall of a pseudo-Victorian hotel, but, they seem decent,” Tony said with a shrug.  “Dinner’s coming, by the way.  Should be here shortly.”
When he finally reached the Tower, he was no closer to deciding how to handle the situation with Tony than he had been the night before, other than the certainty that he needed to do something, even if that something was to do nothing and finally let this whole thing go for good. That was probably the safest course.  Teammates.  Friends.  He could do that.  Hell, he needed that. Desperately.  The thought of driving some rift between him and Tony over this…well, he wasn’t sure he could risk that.  But…what if?  What if Sam was right?  Lord knew, Steve was probably the last person to be judging whether someone was interested or not.  He knew a part of him, probably a larger part than he wanted to admit, still inhabited a ninety-pound, wheezing body that gazes slid over without really seeing on their way to Bucky.
“Some veterans’ group fundraiser, ostensibly,” Steve told him.  “Mostly, it’s a chance for the California brass to get together and see who can avoid pulling a muscle patting themselves on the back.  SHIELD works with a lot of the military branches in attendance, though, and Fury wants us to have a presence there.”
“Uh-huh,” Tony nodded.  He reached over and took the top chip off the stack Stane had gifted to Steve, and held it up.  “Better than a gravy boat,” he quipped, looking between the two of them once more, then wandering off towards the blackjack table.
“You have class tomorrow night, right?  I’m not going,” Tony said, holding up a placating hand at Steve’s look.  “How’s the new computer working out?”
“He went to Germany, you know?  After Steve was hurt.  He sat in his car in the parking lot of the hospital while Steve was in surgery.  He thinks I didn’t know about it, but I just could never bring myself to give him grief over it,” Rhodey said to Barnes, whose mouth flattened into a thin line, but he looked away and huffed out a shaky breath.
“I don’t know,” Steve said slowly, staring at the seat in front of him.  He didn’t know.  That was as true as it had been since they first met.  It was just, the gaping, dark blankness where that thought usually lived wasn’t there anymore.
They needed people. But, Steve didn’t want to risk it, Tony knew. Not after what happened before. Violence was abhorred for good reason when you had to live virtually on top of each other in small caves and encampments and depended on each other in such intricate ways. Each person was vital to the camp, just like with the Clan, and what had happened after the man said those things to Tony was just not something the camp would allow. What if something like that happened again and they were forced out during the worst part of winter? Tony assured Steve he could keep quiet this time, even if people said things. Steve had just looked at him and said that it wasn’t Tony he worried about keeping quiet, and so that had been that.
“This is all classified at the highest levels.  You have to understand—“ Coulson started.
Steve stared at him, trying to see if his mind could come up with something, but while the guy looked somewhat vaguely familiar, like something he’d glimpsed out of the corner of his eye, but never really seen, he was drawing a blank.  “No, sorry.  Sorry, I just don’t really have time to…pay attention to…” and he really didn’t know how to finish.
, or—or what I’m supposed…how I’m supposed to do this,” Tony said.  “I hate it.  I hate all of this.  I don’t want to be like this.  I don’t want you to—to think I’m—I’m weak or—”
“Just your run-of-the-mill blind date, Officer,” Tony called out, then grinned up at Steve and drew him in for another kiss.
Tony snorted out a huff of a laugh.  “You should be in Gucci or Prada or nothing at all,” Tony declared, then went still, catching himself.  “Sorry,” he said quickly, mouth twisting into an apologetic grimace.  “That was--I didn’t mean---I don’t know what I meant.  You know what? Ignore me.”
Steve gave a low chuckle, then on impulse, leaned down and kissed Tony full on the mouth, deep and wet, full of heat and promise, nothing like the kiss Tony had given him.
It was late afternoon before a knock sounded at the door, drawing Steve’s attention from where he had been reading one of the many books that were strewn about the room, this one a treatise on various painting techniques that he was sure Tony had supplied just for him.  To Steve’s surprise, it was General Rhodes who strode into the room.  By sending for him, Tony apparently meant that he would send his highest ranking military leader, Steve thought, stifling the urge to grin at Rhodes’ dour expression.
“Wouldn’t want to be late to take our leave,” Steve said agreeably.
“I was thinking,” Steve began, glancing quickly over at Shellhead, who seemed to be staring off at nothing, preoccupied with his own thoughts.  “I was thinking that tomorrow, we head back.”
“Aye, Your Majesty,” Josiah replied, and nodded to Peran, who stopped and took up a sentry post. Josiah followed them further down, stopping by a jagged rock that had flecks of paint clinging to it where it seemed to have been marked by visitors who long since moved on. Roots and vines crawled over the rocks here, and a few low ferns clung to the haphazard rocks above, almost as if in defiance of their surroundings. There was a low noise, like wind, though the air moved very little here. It grew louder as they followed the winding path.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes. Please,” Steve said, but then reached up for Tony and pulled him down into a sloppy, wet kiss that ended with Tony grinning against Steve’s mouth as he slowly pulled himself out, then pushed back in again with a gasp.  Steve closed his eyes and bit his lip as Tony got his knees under himself and began thrusting in earnest, pounding into Steve with deep, hard thrusts.  His body rocked with the motion, finding the rhythm Tony was setting.
Steve made his way to the spot Tony had indicated and knelt down onto the plush carpet. He put his hands behind his back, as Tony had instructed him to do. His cock strained painfully between his legs, red and leaking from the head. A momentary feeling of ridiculousness at his position came over him, but he glanced at Tony’s back and remembered Tony’s impassive face after his outburst, and the need to be good enough to put pride and pleasure on Tony’s face worked on him like an aphrodisiac.
The shine of headlights drew his attention to the window, making his stomach do a somersault then decide to fold itself into an origami swan while working its way up his throat, apparently. He stood up and smoothed down his suit, running a hand over his hair in what was probably a useless attempt to get it to look less Bride of Frankenstein meets Fonzie.
“You broke the countertop,” Tony told him.  He traced one of the cracks with a finger.
“Thought you were going to get some sleep,” Steve reminded him, which gave Tony and out, and damn if he wasn't certain that was the point.
“Tony.  Can we talk? Please?” Steve asked.
“What’s he doing now?” the King shouted.
“I’ve got some reports to finish,” Steve said after a long beat of silence, though he held Rumlow’s gaze until the other man looked away, shifting his feet and bouncing slightly on his heels.
The guards gripped Steve’s arms and pushed him forward, almost propelling his shackled feet over the ground in their haste to obey, leaving Zola and Sitwell behind.  Through the red doors, the small courtyard was empty, though Steve could see cushioned benches with small, tufted pillows on the ground next to them.  He was led down a maze of halls, down a series of stairs, then through arched doors and past flower-crested guards, robed overseers and domestic slaves cleaning or carrying trays overflowing with food and pitchers of fragrant wines towards the rooms with lamps lit outside of them.  His stomach rumbled.
“So, when you said you did not wish to be with me tonight, that was a lie,” Tony pointed out.
Very vague spoilerish stuff for Age of Ultron.
On the screen, Steve could barely make out Tony’s knees and head between Peggy and Jarvis on the sofa, but he could see one of Tony’s legs bouncing nervously, like the pent-up energy was slowly working its way up.  For just a moment, his hand ached to reach out and cap itself over Tony’s knee, stilling him, and Tony would look over at him in surprise, then grin, not really apologetically, not exactly.  He’d make the bed move with the motion, just enough to mess up Steve’s sketches, and it drove Steve nuts, but he missed it now.  He missed having something that drove him nuts that he didn’t mind one bit, contradictory as that seemed.
Coulson studied him across the table, then leaned back in his seat and looked down at his hands, where they were joined in front of him.
.  It had to be.  It felt like it could be almost the same thing, if you squinted.
“I’m just saying, this is exactly how you got yourself in trouble in the first place,” Tony protested.
Lies and love, so intertwined as to be almost indistinguishable.  Steve let his eyes fall shut for a moment, then opened them again and watched Peggy cross over to where Tony sat on the floor by his mother’s feet. She knelt down, hair swinging in front of her face a bit and reached out to peel the action figure away from Tony’s chest just a bit.
“Is this all some publicity stunt, Stark?” David, the reporter from earlier, asked, standing up.  Others were on their feet, too, shouting questions, sensing blood in the water.
to Bucky?
“Look, you want out?  Fine!” Brock shouted at him, jabbing his hand sharply at the air. “Whatever, man.  When the check clears, you give me my million, and we go our separate ways.  Fine.  Whatever.  Your loss.”
Tonight, he was absurdly grateful that the mountains were quiet and dark.  Hopefully, that meant no dreams and no getting out of bed, but just in case, he wrapped a length of rope he had taken from the barn around his wrist and tied it to the bedpost.  There.  No roaming about tonight.  Perhaps it would help with the other problem, too, though tying his hands at night seemed just as much of a problem as the Reverend’s suggestion, especially if he ever made it off to the war.  How would he explain
“So, I thought, I should make it up to you.  I owe you, right?” Ty continued.  “Shouldn’t be all about me.  You should get to have some fun tonight, too, right?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Tony, what happened in Afghanistan wasn’t your fault.  How can you blame yourself for what that Stane guy did?  He was the one who sold weapons under the table, not you,” Steve protested so vehemently he was practically vibrating with it.  “And we’re going to make sure that every single person responsible for that happening pays for what they did,” he announced in a voice that Tony was sure probably had his fellow soldiers scrambling to see who could agree first.
“No,” Steve acknowledged.  “Not yet.  I’ll still go with you, though.”
A rush of wetness leaked down the backs of his thighs.  Alpha, Anto thought, feeling his breath coming in quick, sharp pants.  It occurred to him that he wasn’t distressed by the idea of the man giving him his signal, not the way he always felt when Tyber signaled him, when his mind thrummed with fear and pain and cold, dark anger coiled deep inside him.  Other Omegas seemed to like it well enough, after all. And the man was like him. One of the Others. Maybe it wouldn’t hurt as much with his own kind.
Steve ducked his head under the water, hung there and opened his eyes to the hazy, blue blur where his hands reached out as white as bone against the water, then rose up out of the water and shook his head, sending a spray of droplets across the waves.
I could kill him, Steve thought as he bent low and put his hands to the ground.   Hammer was Stane’s guest, according to Zola. Which meant Cam would be here, somewhere.  I could kill Hammer, find Cam and then somehow get us both past the hundreds of royal guards between murdering a peer of the Realm and any shot at freedom.
Tony bit his lip and grinned down at the phone screen for probably the tenth time since he’d gotten the message, then flopped over on his back on the bed and stared up at the ceiling. His fingers splayed over his stomach, smoothing over the soft silk where the nightgown had bunched up.
“Forgive me,” Steve implored bleakly. “Forgive me.”
Two other men rushed forward at Steve, spears raised in front of them.  Somehow, they ended up in the dirt, too, their spears flung aside. It all happened so fast.   Durk, who had once spent an afternoon watching Anto build a tower out of sticks and rocks, raised his club, which Steve caught easily, twisted it out of Durk’s hand and then proceeded to smash it against the side of Durk’s head.  Durk fell to the ground with an almost comical expression of surprise. Crum tried to jab his spear at Steve’s side, only to have it broken in half and the pieces used to batter him until he fled into the forest. The whole thing seemed to be over before it started.
Heat, a real Heat, was nothing like that, as he’d learned last month when his body finally decided it was ready to kill him slowly and painfully for a few days because of one tiny little, utterly useless quirk of genetics.  Fucking fuck, that had been awful.  Hell, he’d have taken Obie and his creepy old man dick by the second day if he could’ve gotten it, but, instead, he’d been given a case of Powerade, some protein bars, a bathtub filled with cool water and a few anatomically questionable toys.  Most of the worst of it was a hazy cycle of pain and need that, thankfully, he could barely remember, except nothing had been enough, no matter what he did, and fuck, he’d tried everything he could to find whatever it was his body demanded, but nothing worked.  Everything he’d tried left him in a frustrated state of over-simulation, chasing a release that he couldn’t quite find no matter how many times he came, until he was empty and open and sore as fuck.  It was never enough.
He hadn’t even noticed the photos being taken, truth be told.  He’d been far too engrossed in Steve to pay attention to anything else, though he supposed that pretty well sold the whole twitterpated newlyweds thing.
“The Raj’Inama’s favors are for the King alone,” Tony said, leaning back in his chair and resting a hand on the back of Steve’s neck again.  Only Steve could feel the slight tremor there. He wondered if Stone knew Tony well enough to know when he had taken this too far, because Tony was seething with rage under a veneer of calm. Rhodes could see it, too, Steve noticed, catching the other man’s eye.  “As you well know. Enough. Take your reward.”
Steve would call it making love, and Tony supposed that was just as true, if not as descriptive.  He loved Steve with every fiber of his being.  He loved Steve’s mind, agile and brilliant in ways that Tony often found himself grasping only later, after everything had fallen into place in some life-sized chess game that only Steve could see sometimes.  He loved Steve’s body, all carefully controlled power and violence that Steve used as some kind of shield against a world he didn’t quite trust with Tony.  He loved Steve’s heart, which insisted on seeing the best in people, on believing in what could be rather than what was, and miraculously, which he gave to Tony for safekeeping.  He loved Steve’s soul, this glowing, warm, soft place that cradled all of Tony’s hopes and dreams, his pain and failures, all of it, all of Tony, and reflected it all back at him with nothing less than some kind of Goddamned miracle of absolute acceptance.
Steve watched Stark—Tony, he mentally corrected, trying the name around in his head like he would a new word—walk over to the suite’s private elevator and press the button.  The pseudo-art deco styled doors pulled open with a soft whoosh, and Tony stepped inside, extending a hand out to the empty space next to him.  It was an affected, orchestrated gesture that was probably intended to seem casual, but Steve could see the rigid way Tony was standing, shoulders back, eyes flicking over the people in the room with something Steve would have called nervousness if he’d had to name it, though that didn’t seem quite right.
A groan escaped him, rumbling its way from his chest up his throat and into Tony’s mouth like an echo.  Tony broke his mouth away for a moment, muttering a curse, then took Steve’s lips again, hard and forceful this time, all delicacy and technique abandoned, just some amalgam of need, passion and possession.  It was Tony taking and Steve giving, wild, feral hunger and desperate longing.  He could feel it in the grasp of Tony’s hands clutching at him, fingers skating over his back, then lower, to cup his ass and knead the abused flesh until Steve let out a soft cry that Tony captured in his mouth.  His eyelashes were wet. He wasn’t sure if it was from him or Tony, or if it even mattered. He let Tony take what he needed and gloried in giving it to him. This. God, this was what he wanted so very much, to make Tony feel this way, to let Tony make him feel this way, it was beautiful and perfect. A gift, he thought, the word humming through his mind with a pleasant rush of warmth.
“He had it coming,” Tony said with a shrug that he hoped signal nonchalance and gave nothing away of the warmth that filled his belly at Steve’s words.  “Not going to lie, it felt pretty damn good after what he pulled.”
It should have been me.  Steve shoved the thought aside.  It would have been wrong, then, certainly.  Tony had been far too gone with drink to know what he was doing, beyond managing to somehow stumble into Steve’s quarters instead of those of a stranger.
Tony let out a sharp hiss at the movement, only to have the expression replaced with wide-eyed horror as he stared up at Steve.
“Why the hell not?” Tony demanded.
“Of course,” Steve replied.  “You should have—you deserved that.  To be courted.”
“That's a low bar for gratitude you got there, Tony,” Steve observed mildly, but the tension had leaked out of his shoulders a bit. “But, of course, I'm not gonna be...” he cleared his throat and looked down at his heavy, black workboots. “Just figured we'd make this as easy as possible. On both of us. No reason for hard feelings.”
“Yep.  Took a bit of doing.  Barnes, mostly.  There was, the, ah.  The money thing,” Tony said, pulling out the chair next to Rhodey.
“Good,” Tony replied, sounding more relieved than he should. He shook himself, tilting his head to the side, mouth flattening for a moment. “I thought, perhaps, with the boy…”
Steve permeated everything.  He had somehow become such a part of Tony’s life that Tony couldn’t figure out how to excise Steve without losing huge chunks of himself, the parts he liked the best, truth be told, in the process.
“Look—“ Tony started, then broke off as he watched Steve nod along politely with whatever it was the young man next to him was saying.  That wasn’t the thing that bothered Tony, though.  It was the way Steve had his arm up, slightly outstretched in front of him, hand fisted tightly across his chest.  Tony had seen the movement enough to know it from memory.  It was just that usually there was an actual shield there.  Fuck.  Seriously, just fuck my life, Tony thought, turning and slamming the glass down on the bar hard enough for some of the golden liquid to slosh onto the tips of his fingers where they gripped the glass.
“Okay, okay…you already put the toilet paper roll on with the paper coming over the top, which, you know, good, because that’d be a deal-breaker,” Tony said, pretending to mull it over as he chewed.
“Nothin’, nothin’.  Looks good on you, is all,” Brock said.  “All that fancy, rich-guy stuff.”
“Sometimes, I...when it’s me,” Steve began, then broke off, swallowing past the lump in his throat and looking away, hot shame flooding him.
“I would. For you, yes, I would,” Tony replied. “I think there is very little I wouldn’t do for you, truth be told.”
“Bet sugar daddy could get you out with a phone call,” Brock muttered, stretching back in his seat so his knees bumped the seat in front of him.  “Hear he’s pretty tight with the Mayor.  And the Governor.  And the President, come to think of it.” Steve swallowed uncomfortably, and frowned over at Brock, who gave him a sharp look.  “What?  Just sayin’, man.”
“I know,” Steve grinned, “And he—Bucky’d always be there, like he had the Sight or something, pulling me out of trouble whenever I managed to get into it.  Which was often,” Steve admitted with a low chuckle.
“Of course, Your Highness,” Josiah replied.
“What says he?” Steve asked Yinsen. Yinsen looked somewhat abashed, swallowed nervously, and gave the Omega an almost pleading look, which earned little more than the Omega’s chin jutting out obstinately.
“Good call.  Repulsor burn the worst of it?”  Bruce asked, eyebrows raised in question.
Lord Hammer stood up with a sudden flourish and side-stepped his way on odd, mincing little steps over to where Steve knelt.  He grasped Steve’s chin and lifted it up, holding it there.
Tony just looked at the man, then turned his gaze out the wall of windows, thumb on his lip.  Why was he doing this?  Sure, it was just money, and for him, not even that much, but it was still insane and crazy and…incredibly satisfying.
“I know.  I saw it,” Steve said with a grimace.
Honestly, he sometimes wondered why people made such a huge issue out of it.  Not that he minded or anything, but it wasn’t like real life was some porno where everyone always has an amazing time, though he thought he was getting better at it.  He grimaced and squeezed his eyes shut.  Probably Stark would want a discount, he thought, huffing out a low, groaning chuckle that he quickly smothered so as not to wake Brock.  God, that would be embarrassing. Way worse than those first few times with Brock, which, yeah, he could look back and say that he had been pretty much an unmitigated failure at first.
“No, no, it was,” Steve began, then hesitated.  What was it?  His night with Tony was a lot of things--amazing, fantastic, wonderful.  He just wasn’t sure that he wanted to say any of those to Brock right now, though he didn’t want Brock to think it had been bad, by any means.  He wasn’t sure why he cared so much about that.  Tony’s reputation certainly shouldn’t matter to him, but he couldn’t shake his need to correct Brock.  “Actually, it was good.  Really good.  He definitely, ah.  Lives up to his reputation.”
“Unresponsive, Sir,” JARVIS told him.  “You need to reboot the emergency systems, but every sequence I’ve run appears to overload the remaining power and short circuit the entire system.  I am still calculating options, Sir.”
Tony heard a low, rumbling noise and realized it was coming from him. He placed a hand lightly, but firmly on Steve’s hip where it rutted against him, and Steve immediately stilled, looking up at Tony once more, briefly, before dropping his eyes again, but it was enough. This, Tony thought. This is what the other thing is, why he felt so centered this morning, so sure. The way Steve looked at him---he couldn’t put it into words what it was, not exactly. Trust and love and devotion and all those things, but like they had been strained and distilled to their purest form where nothing else could touch them.
“We’re not going steady. We’re…” Steve trailed off with a slight frown.  He honestly wasn’t sure what they were.  Tony was interested, that much was certain, though what, exactly, that meant, Steve couldn’t be sure.  Still, it was something, Steve thought, warmth seeping through his stomach and chest.  Tony Stark.  Yeah, it was something.

“So deeply personal, we shouldn’t even ask, I’m guessing?” Tony said, raising his eyebrows.
Anto suspected that if that was truly how a child was created, then he would never have anything to worry about, since Tyber was never pleased with him.  He took Maara’s special medicine anyway, just to be certain. It would make his spirit hard to conquer, she said. Not impossible. Some spirits were strong enough to overcome even the medicine and mix with the Omega’s spirit to form a child.  So far, though, Tyber’s spirit was apparently not that strong, and for that, Anto was deeply relieved. The last thing he wanted was a child of Tyber’s spirit, though it seemed to frustrate Tyber to the point of rage that Anto never conceived.   It was an embarrassment that his spirit wasn’t strong enough to conquer an Omega’s, and Tyber hated him for that above almost anything else, Anto thought, knowing that he would face Tyber’s wrath each time his Heat came and went without a quickening, and that it would be worse while Tyber tried to prove his spirit was strong enough, at least until he got frustrated enough to give up for a time, blame Anto and his misshapen body and foul, unnatural spirit that was too strong for an Omega.  Anto liked the peace of that time, short though it sometimes was.
“You took college classes?” Steve asked again, looking down at Tony.  “You said it was an online school.  I didn’t realize it was college classes.”
“I’ll take him to Medical first,” Coulson replied.  “Tony?”
“Go,” Steve urged with a small, knowing smile.  “I’ll be here, ready to celebrate when you get back.”
“So soon?” Tony asked in false dismay, clutching a hand to his chest. “But this has been so much fun and not at all awkward.”
Tony watched the two Alphas trade uncomfortable looks with a surge of satisfaction.  When the elevator doors finally opened, they scurried out and down the hall, shoving at each other and anyone else who got in the way of their escape.  Ah, the brave men of SHIELD. It truly warmed the heart.
“James R. Rhodes,” Steve said with a frown.  “Air Force Academy.  Aerospace Engineering major.  Top 3% of his class…Looks good, but why him?”
Jarvis called.  Three times.  And texted.  Tony ignored the messages, then felt terrible about ignoring them, but couldn’t quite bring himself to respond.  He wasn’t even mildly surprised when Jarvis showed up the next morning with donuts, a French press and bag of freshly ground coffee.
There was a stranger staring back at him in the mirror.  He hadn’t realized how different he looked.  No wonder Hammer hadn’t recognized him.  Or Rhodes, for that matter, though one soldier in desert fatigues looked much the same as any other, and it wasn’t like Rhodes has been exactly focused on Steve at the time. Hell, he barely recognized the man looking back at him in the mirror, standing in one of the most expensive suites in town, wearing a suit that cost God only knew how much.  His face was flushed, eyes bright and hair mussed, sticking up in the back—from Tony’s hand, his mind supplied helpfully.  Two nights ago, he’d been shoving a cock ring on under what he was certain was violation of the Flag Code, and now he was here, swept up in the middle of something that was halfway between insane and wonderful.  He was going to get the rest of the money they needed, all within a few days’ time, and apparently, all he had to do to get it was pretend to be in love with Tony while getting to live the high life for a bit.  Not exactly a trial, he’d be the first to admit.
“Tony, no.  No, no, Tony, I don’t—Jesus. No,” Steve ground out, jerking his hand from Tony’s knee.  He ran it through his hair instead.
“That was fast,” Tony observed mildly, glancing up from where the hamburger patties sizzled—well, gave serious consideration to sizzling, anyway---on top of the small, round grill that was plugged into the wall of Tony’s apartment via a long, orange extension cord that screamed safety hazard.  He was considering putting one of those fireplace videos on the TV and waving the patties in front of it, which he thought might have the same effect as Barnes’ precious grill, which had arrived with Barnes, Nat, a container of marinated hamburger meat and a sticky note on top of the grill that just said, ‘Tony, no,’ in Barnes’ familiar scrawl.
“Seven years! That’s such bullshit,” Brock spat out.  “It just frustrates me, you know,” he continued, voice softening, “‘cause I wanna take care of my guy, see?  This great guy, who should have all these amazing things and be able to go to school and do whatever he wants.  That’s what getting the company going is all about, Steve. You know that, right?”
can be good,” he looked away, biting at his lip. “I can’t give you what you want. What
“Joshua?” Coulson parroted, quirking his eyebrow up in question.
“Good.  You should.  Pick out whatever you want,” Steve encouraged, then headed back to the dressing room to change.  “You said you had something for the gala, right?”
“It’s not guilt.  I know what you’re thinking,” Tony cut in at Steve’s look.  “It isn’t.  It’s…I used to think about it.  All the time.  The things we’d do when I got out of school, made our fortune.  Could give you what you deserved,” Tony said with a deprecating shrug.  “Trips.  Cars.  Fancy dinners.  Show you off a bit.  Show off
“--in town for the Department of Defense’s annual Defense Innovation Show, Stark was spotted enjoying the craps table at Wynn’s casino, alongside the Vegas mogul himself.  Kelsey, I’m told Stark won a Picasso off Wynn in a side-bet,” the woman on TV announced with a smile in her voice before it went silent.
been going well, damn it all to hell.  It was like he couldn’t just have enough with Steve.  He always had to try for more, push at whatever boundary there was between them just to see if he could get that line in the sand to move a bit further.  Tony could only imagine the thoughts that must be running through Steve’s head.  This was all so very, very fucked up.  Granted, a large part of why was Tony’s fault, but if there was ever any proof needed of why he’d made the right call not just outing their past relationship from the get go, here it was.  This Steve, the one just out of the ice, wasn’t ready to deal with this, not even close, though it was, admittedly, hard to convince himself he’d done any of it for Steve.
“We’re not seriously going to the Grand Canyon,” Steve protested as he watched the otherwise seemingly inexplicable helicopter approach.
"Had other priorities," Steve responded evenly, remembering Tony's blood, eerily bright against the white snow once he got the suit off.  Tony looked like he was on the verge of saying something else, then gave Steve a measuring, confused look and clamped his mouth shut hard enough to rattle teeth instead.
Steve’s eyes flew open as a burst pleasure slammed into him on the heels of the pain, and for a moment, his mind couldn’t work out which sensation to feel as they both cascaded together, intertwined and overwhelming. He wanted to close his legs and buck into Tony’s hand at the same time.  He did groan, then, long and low and tremulous.  Just when his head cleared, the pressure was gone, and he felt Tony’s hand stroking softly at the inside of his thigh and murmuring soft, reassuring words.
“You get one company-altering decision per day, Tony,” Pepper gritted out.  “Go catch your bus to your Brooklyn hovel with your almost-ex.  Wow.  The sentences you end up saying with this job.”
“What makes you think I’m Cath—oh.  Emmanuel,” Steve nodded with a slight grimace, glancing down at Kirk’s hands.  Emmanuel.  Where I go to school.  So I can help the sick kids.  Sick kids, Rogers.  Get it together.  “What about you? College or…other…job?” Steve asked with a wince that was thankfully hidden by the canvas in front of him.
“Get to your room,” Howard ordered, pulling himself up and straightening his suit jacket.  “We’ll go meet Captain Rogers day after tomorrow.  Your mom’s got people coming to get you ready starting tomorrow morning.  Try to think before you do anything stupid.  And then, word of advice?  Don’t even try it.”
“You went to a lot of trouble to get a few home movies to me,” Steve pointed out, raising an eyebrow in question.
“Hey,” Tony replied, striving for nonchalance and probably missing by a mile. He cleared his throat and sat down behind the desk, flatting one palm on top and holding out the other hand in the direction of one of the chairs directly opposite for Steve to use.
Yes. Everything was perfect.
“He was not just trying to help, any more than he was just trying to help the young Murphy boy with his understanding of scripture, or did you truly believe good Thomas’ parents sent him away so quickly to help a sick grandmother, not to return until the good Reverend was...removed from his position?” Tony questioned, his voice a low growl against Steve’s skin. “As for the men that night in Gulleytown, be glad that you were oblivious to them.  Men like that, they prey on the weak, or who they think of as weak.  A slip of a boy, barely a man, too drunk and blind with grief to notice the danger.  Or….perhaps a weary traveller, appearing out of place in the dark of a crossway, surely lost...”
“I said ‘relatively small,’ calm down.  Size isn’t everything,” Tony replied with a sagely smug nod.
“Spellcasters, thieves, archers, falconers, I am amazed Hydra didn’t simply surrender,” Tony said. “Perhaps one day you will meet them, if they agree to come here, what say you to that?”
“Actually, it’s the note the venture capital firm holds, and you’re paying way too much,” Pepper interjected.  “But, it is securitized with the company and all its assets, including the individual shares.”
“Thanks,” Steve said with a slight grimace before shaking his head and looking over at Tony again.  “Hey,” Steve said, drawing Tony’s gaze.  “Thanks, Tony.  Really,” he repeated, though this time, there was a warm, open gratefulness in the tone.
, and if it was, he would be better than the type of person who pulled someone into whatever this life was only in the hopes of pulling himself out of it.  That wasn’t fair or right or anything other than self-serving, Steve told himself firmly, failing, again, to quite make the admonition stick.
“Fairly met,” Stark said, clicking and snapping his fingers together in a sudden burst of energy as he strode forward, then pivoted and looked over at Steve for a long moment, then back at Brock. “Love, then, you would say, that can’t be bought. It means something deeper, something that can’t be sullied by putting an amount on it, right? It’s beyond money, let’s say.”
“I mean—” Steve started.
“Don’t you turn away from me when I’m talking to you, boy,” Howard ground out, sending flecks of spittle into his moustache.  There was a hand on Tony’s arm, jerking him around, a finger pointing in his face, and it was all so fast.  He’d forgotten how fast it happened.  How you could never quite be quick enough.  Almost, but not quite. Close, but no cigar, he thought with a strange sort of detached hysteria that seemed to make his limbs go soft and rubbery.
“Okay, we’re all professionals here. I think we can multitask,” Tony argued.
He wanted to touch himself.  Ached to touch himself.  Just a few strokes, just some friction, that’s all he needed.  He glanced down at the bed.  Imagined rutting against it.  Pulling up the gown, feeling the cotton sheet rough against the sensitive skin of his cock and balls, how
Tony’s hands worked the zippers and buckles on Steve’s training uniform probably faster than even he could have.  Perks of designing it, he assumed, then felt an odd mix of want and a strange, chagrined sort of pleasure at the idea of Tony making this for him and thinking about safety and utility and how to get it off him in the most efficient way possible.  A moment later, he felt cool air wisp over his heated skin, and he dipped his shoulders enough for Tony to shrug the uniform off him and push it down, past his waist, letting his fingers follow the rough material over Steve’s body until they gripped Steve’s hips where the bone carved out against the taut skin there.  He could feel Tony tracing the line of it, from the curve of his waist, slanting down towards where Steve’s cock jutted out between them.
Steve and Tony both watched the elevator doors slide closed, then looked at each other with what Steve imagined were twin expressions of bemusement.
“So, if someone wanted to get one for their—can we all say it together?” Tony asked.
“I don’t—I don’t know what—” Steve stammered, trying to find words, any words, just something to chase the images in his head away for a moment.  “What you’re asking.”
“No,” Rhodey admonished lightly as they took the steps.
“Thanks.  I think,” Steve replied.
“Yeah, but…usually that means…leaving,” Tony replied dully, waving his hand in the general direction of the elevator doors.
Steve’s hands roamed over his chest, down his stomach, over his arms and thighs, up his knees where they were parted, so Tony could see him, except he
. The thought flashed, bright and clear, across Steve’s mind.  Tony, dressed not in his usual fine attire, but in the plain wear of a servant, curled up in the cot that passed for a bed in Steve’s quarters, sun-bronzed skin glowing in the light of the small fire that burned in the hearth.  All angles and limbs under watery eyes, face flushed red and stinking of drink.  Don’t send me away.  God, how those words had haunted him over the years. Don’t send me away.
“Tell me about them,” Tony asked when he managed to suck in enough air to calm down.  “Not just the French stuff.  I heard stories, of course, but…I suspect the history books lacked a bit of, dare I say, flavor?”  Steve smiled and ducked his head, but he did talk, one story after another at Tony’s encouragement, and like the art before, something warm and pleasant settled in Tony’s stomach just listening to Steve talk, getting to share something this personal with him.  He found himself occasionally adding his own story from MIT, and the feeling he got when Steve laughed, eyes bright and face completely open, enthralled by Tony’s tales of the various hacks and pranks they pulled, including mounting a police cruiser on the Great Dome and hacking the Harvard stadium scoreboard to change their ‘Veritas’ slogan to ‘Huge Ego,’ doing their part to uphold the MIT tradition.
“In fact…okay, new plan,” Tony cut him off. “You, Fugitive reject, come back with us. Now. To the hotel, I mean.  Be easier than picking you up tomorrow.  We’ve got plenty of room, and you can keep Steve company.”
He thought maybe you needed to know you had a chance to find one though.  That maybe just the certainty that you could be loved, maybe that would be enough.
“You don’t like the car?” Steve asked, canting his head back with a frown of surprised confusion.
(See the end of the chapter for
Well, hell, that stung, Tony thought, thoroughly disgruntled. Not like it was the first time he’d been essentially called a whore to his face, whether for his sexual proclivities or military dealings, but an actual turn-down was still pretty damn rare. Not particularly fond of it, come to think, Tony admitted silently. What the fuck was his life? He sucked in a deep, completely un-calming breath, and stared at the man, biting his cheek to keep twenty different angry retorts from escaping. He’d often wondered how much of his charm was predicated on who he was. Well, now he was getting an answer, even if it was one he didn’t want to hear.
“I do,” Tony said.  “Want to.  Wait. That sounded—wow, okay, did not mean it to come out quite so Going to the Chapel, but all things considered,” he laughed with a nervous jolt of energy, but Steve was smiling and doing that adorable blushy thing he did.  “I’ll buy extra milk.  I’ll…have whoever buys the milk buy extra milk,” he corrected, blinking hard and shaking his head in deprecation.  “I don’t roll up my toothpaste tube.”
“I’m just saying…if after everything, if this—if this is where you end up, if you get
“It’s alright, Tony.  You don’t have to apologize,” Steve said quickly.  “Used to do a lot of drawing when me an’ Tony---when we knew each other.  Just little sketches and stuff.  Nothing big.  Not so much anymore.  But, thanks,”   Steve said to Jane.  He was back to pushing the rice around on his plate, the tines of his fork tracing thin lines through the grains and making a scraping sound in the quiet.
“What?” Steve asked, giving Tony a confused look.
and looked at Steve with an expression of hopeful anticipation.
“Thought you were going to be in there all night,” Steve said.
“They could,” Tony insisted.  “They could, Steve. Then what? Then you get in trouble, and have to bail me out of jail, and—“
Steve looked down at Tony, opened his mouth to say no, they couldn’t do this, it wasn’t fair to either of them, but no words came out.  Tony was watching him with a bleak, knowing look, like he expected Steve’s retreat, and Steve just couldn’t do that to him. It will hurt us both more later, Steve told himself, and that was likely true, but he couldn’t say no. I promised to make him happy for now, Steve reminded himself.  He wondered if that was really what he was doing. He looked up at the stone again.
He’d woken up on the fourth day feeling like he had the worst hangover of his life, his dick red and chafed and so damn sensitive it hurt to touch, his hole loose and raw around one of the dildos that was still shoved up inside him, being utterly useless.  Someone helped him into the bath and cleaned him up, but the cold water stung at the abraded skin, and left him shivering and curled into a ball on the mess of a bed, just barely able to muster the energy to hate life.
“Steve,” Rhodey called out as he stood up.
“Please,” Steve gasped.  “Please, I—I need—please!”  He moaned and squeezed his eyes shut, breathing out through his nose in a long, slow exhale.  Steve heard the scrape of the King’s chair across the stone floor and a moment later, the King’s boots filled his line of vision.  Steve looked up.  “Please,” he begged, the word punched out of him in a long, high keen.
“They’re not--seriously, that’s not what I’m...” Bruce sighed.
, the sterile, lawyerly word for under arrest that had kept filtering through the numb, burned out edges of Steve’s mind on that tense, quiet plane ride to London when Tony wouldn’t look at him, just sat there, tight-jawed, staring out the jet’s window, but somehow made all the other arrangements down to the black suit waiting in Steve’s hotel room and the spray of white gardenias that Sharon thanked Steve for while he stared blankly at her and let his mind skip across stories of blackouts and luminous pins and the rich sound of Peggy’s deep, caustic laughter at the idea of relying on a fashion accessory to keep from getting run over on the dark London streets.
Steve just blushed and ducked his head a bit as the other Avengers filed into the conference room.
“Captain?” Deirdre queried.  “Is something wrong with the poster?”
“Josh Davis.  He gave me one of his Batman band-aids when Kenny Blackwell shoved my face in the ground after I pushed him off the swing when he made Laura Peters cry because she had to wear her older sister’s clothes, and they were all about three sizes too big for her. True love,” Steve chuckled.
good thing…it slipped into Tony’s mind and coiled there, settled in and made itself at home.  Like it belonged.  It was the strangest feeling to receive praise without the concurrent need to figure out why.
“They aren’t staying,” Barnes told the countertop, where he was arranging the chopsticks and sauces in what could only be described as an aggressive manner.
“Jaymes,” Steve replied firmly. “With a ‘Y,’” he grinned. “Jaymes Maria.”
It seemed the entire village was out to meet them, Steve noticed as their carriage approached, though that wasn’t exactly a surprise. It was hardly every day that the King came through. Many of the crowd would probably only see this once in their lifetime, and in a world without much in the way of entertainment, this was something not to be missed.   Most were simple folk, farmers, shopkeepers, and the like, but as he peered out the window, Steve could see some of who he assumed were landed gentry of some kind.  Not high ranking enough to appear at Court, but they were surely not going to miss an opportunity to greet the King.
“You said you weren’t going to say anything,” Tony pointed out.
“Maybe we change it up a bit in the bedroom.  I mean, everyone needs to do that sometimes, right?”
There were only two apartments on Steve’s floor, with the staircase in the middle of the landing separating them, and Steve’s boring, blue mat marking his door.  Rhodey raised his eyebrows, then swept out his hands for Tony to pass, which left him no choice but to knock on Steve’s door.  And wait.
“I--” Steve stopped, swallowing hard.  “Yeah.  Of course.”  He turned back towards the kitchen counter, staring down at the half-full recycle bin.
The whining, thumping sounds from above slowly started to fade.  Not enough for Tony to hear the scrape of the key in the lock, so he started a bit when the door opened and Steve stepped inside, eyes finding Tony almost immediately.
“So, it’s not dial-up, I take it,” Tony deadpanned, then shook his head at Steve’s blank look.  “Forget it. Okay, so that...that could work. The whole point was to explore, to push boundaries, see how far I could go, die heroically and too far from Pepper or Rhodey to have to deal with them, but let’s put that aside. That is, if you’ll have me, of course.”
“Guess who’s coming to dinner,” Natasha said in a low voice, rolling her lip between her teeth as he eyes darted back and forth.  Tony barked out an aborted laugh, half because of her joke, half just because he remembered her habit of throwing random movie references around at completely the wrong time, like it was that one skill that eluded her, and she was determined to master it no matter how many times it failed her.
“Tell me what happened—no, not that night, I don’t need to know,” Jarvis said with a quick wave of his hand.  “Tell me about MIT.”
Not that it had changed anything, except his subsequent attempts at defiance in the form of not immediately capitulating to Howard’s plans appeared to have cemented Howard’s idea that he needed an Alpha who would, in his father’s words, “appreciate that he needed a firm hand.”  So.  That didn’t sound particularly promising.
“I can’t believe I didn’t do it sooner,” Tony retorted, grinning and curling his hand around Steve’s neck, fingers lightly trailing through the hairs there, sending tingling shivers down Steve’s spine. “I missed you.”
“I should’ve come,” Steve said stubbornly.  “Forget that paper thing.  They were your parents. If you needed to yell at someone, least I could do was let it be me.  Maybe we coulda sorted this out back then.  Then I could’ve been there. When you needed me.”
“Yeah?” Stark said.  “Good, then.  It’s settled.  Eat your fish.”
Steve’s finger stopped where the bodice dipped lowest, tugging a little, so the lace scraped lightly over Tony’s nipples.  Tony’s mouth dropped open in a pant, and he was breathing deep, chest expanding on each intake, because it was conscious, something he had to remind himself to do or he might forget entirely. The way Steve was looking at him…it whited out the world, whisked away everything that wasn’t Steve.
Steve was halfway there as it was, and Tony’s words ushered him the rest of the way over the precipice. He thought he heard Tony say something else, but the words were too quiet, barely a breath, and his mind had already slipped into the dark cradle of sleep.  He dreamed something too good to remember, and woke grasping for the wispy remains of the dream as the first rays of dawn broke through the curtains.
Here, he had Tony and Cam, and they were making changes.  Slowly, yes, but Steve could see the betterment. It was there, incremental as it may be.  And were he not here, those changes, however small, may never have happened.  It wasn’t what Steve wanted, but it was something.  It mattered.
the time.  Obie and Pepper…hell, the company practically runs itself. Ignore me.  I’ll stop.  Or, well. Not stop, but be better.  I can be better. I’ll—“
Again, he turned towards the mountains, this time putting his hands over his ears.  “Stop,” Steve called out, nearly a sob.  “Please.  Stop.  I can’t, I can’t, this--please, I…this can’t be happening.”
“I just have one more question…” Tony said, taking a long swallow from his water bottle.  “Why does that Clint guy keep sending me an eVite for a ‘Hot Tub Time Machine Party’?”
“As you say,” Bucky responded after a beat, disbelief lacing each word. Steve watched as Bucky laid back on his pallet and pillowed his hands behind his head, letting out a long puff of air through his nose, then reached over and snuffed out the torch with the metal cone, leaving just a single candle burning on top of one of the trunks that were stacked in one corner of the tent. Steve pulled his shirt over his head and kicked off his boots, placing them on the end of his own pallet next to the shield. His sword rested next to his right hand, as usual, a comforting gleam of brightness as it caught the light of the small flame. A small waft of air, barely enough to be called a breeze, managed to slip in through the open tent flap, but it did little more than send the flame to flicker.
“Barnes needs some kind of medical treatment, the VA is stonewalling, so Steve…” Tony trailed off.
“Okay, I’m gonna stop you right there,” Tony cut in.
“Mr. Estes,” Pepper said.
“Hey Tony,” Steve said and took a swing at the bag, making it rock back a few feet and catching it on the downswing. This time, he did turn to look at Tony.
Steve let go of the tags and brought his hand up and cupped Tony’s chin, tilting his face upwards, his thumb rubbing lightly over Tony’s bottom lip.
“You’ll tell me when you’re ready.  Or not,” Steve shrugged.  Tony could recognize the invitation by now.  He also knew it was impossible for him to ignore it.  He suspected Steve knew that, too.  Tony’s self-resolve was being slowly chipped away at by Steve’s barrage of interesting topics, and damn if Tony wasn’t coming to firmly believe that Steve sat around and thought this out beforehand.
He didn’t do any of that, just turned off the light and sat down on the edge of his bed.  Anthony’s file was on his desk, but he’d put Anthony’s picture on the bedside table, next to a clock with bright, chunky numbers glowing blue and telling him it was barely twenty-two hundred hours, though he didn’t really need the clock for that.  Side effect of the serum. He always knew exactly how much more of the day was left to get through.
Tony stretched his neck up and checked the time again.  Soon, he thought, scrubbing his face with his hands.  Anticipation heated his skin, lighting up his nerves and making him want to squirm with the effort of waiting.  He could feel himself loosening. Liquid heat pooled behind his balls, making his hole go all soft and pliant, readying him to be filled.  The feeling of emptiness, of being open and empty, coupled with the throbbing pressure in his cock, all deep red and dripping pre-come on his stomach and the hem of the gown, it was almost overwhelming.  Like his mind couldn’t settle on which one to feel and kept jumping between the two sensations, skipping across one, then, unsatisfied, trying the other again.
the basics.  It wasn’t really Steve’s favorite thing to do, but it wasn’t like he couldn’t get through it. Usually, Steve preferred to go down on Brock.  It wasn’t that he didn’t like sex, it was just..easier and faster that way, and he didn’t have to worry about relaxing enough to make it good for both of them. Brock got to the same place, so it worked out.  Brock said he was getting better at it, but Tony probably had all kinds of amazing experiences, and it wasn’t like Steve could really compare to any of that.
Steve didn’t respond, just leaned his forehead against the window and sucked in a breath as he watched the passing cars.
Steve looked up and caught Tony’s eye on him while Strucker went on about the need for more sentries on the guard towers, which wasn’t wrong, but what he really needed was scouts and a network of informants and beacons to send their flame-filled warnings.  Sentries, however many he had of them, were too little, too late, but they were under the man’s purview and so that was the need he saw.  Steve mouthed the word ‘scouts’ at Tony, then covered it by taking a sip from the cup he cradled in his hand.
.  Not…not for a long time, I hope.”
The man, Rhodes, paused and dropped his arms to his sides, brow drawing together into a frown before he shook his head.
He swiped a hand over his face, clearing his expression, then looked back down at Steve. The hand that had been in Steve’s hair dropped down to cup his jaw, and Steve leaned into it, as he always did, seeking Tony’s touch.  Tony’s thumb stroked over Steve’s bottom lip, his eyes following the motion for a moment before he lifted his gaze back to Steve.
“You—you knew it was me?” Steve asked.
It was familiar, but the odd, unsettling kind of familiar where it was unexpectedly exactly the same as he pictured it in his mind, but smaller somehow.  Less.
“So, what happened to the ones before me?” Steve asked.
It was over quickly.  Steve had a moment to appreciate Brock’s comically-surprised expression as his training kicked in and he caught Brock’s fist, twisted his arm around and got Brock in a sleeper hold.  He hooked one leg around Brock’s and brought him down, capturing both of Brock’s arms behind his back and shoving him to the floor.
