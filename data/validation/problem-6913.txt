Steve shrugged. He didn’t want to hurt Bucky again by making him think that Steve hadn’t been satisfied with their relationship. Bucky rarely fucked Steve, not since the beginning of their relationship, before Bucky had asked to switch roles and started explaining what he wanted, had it been a regular thing.
He leaned forward to press their lips together, and Bucky relaxed into the kiss. His partner's lips moved sweetly over his as his tongue softly stroked against Bucky’s. He barely heard the water now filling the tub in the other room as he lost himself in the gentle kisses. It had been so long, but Bucky rejoiced at the knowledge that someone else was going to lead, and all he had to do was follow. He let all of his worries and responsibility melt away as they kissed.
And Tony did, he wanted all of him. As Steve continued his unhurried thrusts into him, he lifted his hands to grab at Bucky’s ass behind his head and gently squeezed, encouraging him to use Tony as he needed. Tony’s body jerked when Steve’s next thrust was hard and deep.
Monty looked thoughtful as he said, “With a proper room, I may be able to ring my family for a quick visit and short stay while I’m here. They’re only a few hours away.”
Tony nodded as he bent to grab Bucky’s duffle. “Yep, we’ll tell you on the way. If we don’t get moving, we’re going to be late, and you know how Francesco gets if we’re late.”
“I don’t want to lose him, Buck.” Steve admitted quietly, meaning so many things with just that one sentence.
Tony gently ran the back of his fingers against Steve’s cheek as he looked into confused blue eyes. “I wanted you to know, with no amount of uncertainty that I am hopelessly, absolutely crazy about you, both of you.”
He lifted to his hands and knees, making himself relax as he felt Tony shift closer behind him. He shuddered when he felt the thick head of Tony’s cock rub against his opening, teasing as it spread the lubricant around the muscled ring.
“Love,” he said to Bucky. “ Why don’t you be good for me and help your daddy out of his clothes so I can use him properly.” Steve had agreed to address Tony as that on Bucky’s behalf during a scene, but he wouldn’t call Tony daddy in regards to himself. “Tonight, you’re gonna help me take care of him. You want to make him feel good?”
Bucky could understand, at least in part. Steve took a deep breath and continued. “Now, I have you back. I really have you back, but Tony’s in trouble. Tony, who would also understand what it feels like to be trapped in a world that’s so foreign from what you know. Tony, who I now love as much as I love you. Tony, who I am failing because I can’t help him.”
“It really is.” Steve agreed. “Tony, I…I don’t think I can do this. I know I agreed, and you said it wouldn’t be forever, but I feel like an idiot. I know it will be worse when I put on that outfit they want me wear and have to do this in front of an audience.”
Howard went on, “He died almost two years ago. Heart failure is what the doctors said. It’s a shame because he’ll never get to see the way the company has grown, is still growing. It’s going to bigger than he ever dreamed. He named me after his father, you know? I get my sense of legacy from him.”
Bucky just kept going. “When Steve decided he was going to go on his unsanctioned mission, Tony came along for the ride.”
Tony shrugged, willing his mask to stay in place and regretting his curiosity to meet the famous scientist. “Dark hair and dark eyes, you could say the same for a lot of people.”
It sounded like Bucky’s date wasn’t over yet. Tony awkwardly looked at Steve. Who looked just as awkward but shrugged, like this was something of a usual occurrence. Steve just sighed quietly and went over to the couch where Tony was still standing. He grabbed his sketchpad and started doodling, obviously trying to ignore the sounds still coming from the other room.
“You like that, don’t you? The thought of suckin’ me off in front of those assholes and lettin’ them know you’re mine. That you do these things for me, only me. Show them all the things I let you do to me. Or the things I do to
He didn’t want to blame Tony, not really. Steve knew it wasn’t his fault, and after what Thor had told them, he was really worried for his friend. Well, after this last hour’s-worth of memories, he supposed Tony was more than just his friend. Hadn’t that been something else when he remembered Tony pulling him into a kiss before taking Bucky and him to their bedroom.
There had been an awkward moment during the evening when Peggy Carter had shown up to give Steve his orders on the time to report in the morning. Bucky wasn’t sure why that had been necessary since Steve had planned to go in anyway, but judging from the dress she had been wearing, he supposed the real reason was to make an impression. The impression was certainly made to every other man in the place, but unfortunately for her, the attempt at getting Steve’s attention wasn’t successful.
Erskine’s eyes finally landed on Tony, who was still partially hidden from the main room. When their eyes met, it seemed as if an eternity passed while Tony waited for the doctor’s reaction. Erskine began walking towards him. His steps slowed but didn’t stop as he reached Tony.
He was really beginning to understand what Tony had been telling him about his body and senses. So many of the things Steve had done he’d been able to do without thinking. His body, his everything had been made for this, but Tony had also stressed to trust his instincts, and they told him that the three of them needed to get out soon or be buried under this factory. They finally made it to the walkway.
It wasn’t even because Bucky was angry at the deception. They had figured out early on that Tony couldn’t or wouldn’t do a certain amount of emotional vulnerability. Just as he wouldn’t bring up his past unless he was directly asked by one of them. Even then Bucky and Steve knew it was carefully spoken, each word deliberately chosen. When Tony had given his heart to them, the emotional walls had come down, and he was open with them. His thoughts, however, were sometimes still a mystery.
“It’s going to be our third Christmas with him soon. I mean in our latest memories,” Bucky added. “It was Tony that made our Christmases something special in the first place. Every year he’d cook a special lunch with all of our favorite foods growing up.”
His eyes finally snapped opened and slowly focused on a face that was blurred. Was he crying? “Yinsen?”
“It’s OK, Tony.” Steve said as he scooped him up in a hug. He seemed to enjoy doing that now. “I understand. If it makes it easier for you, build as many as you want.”
Yeah, he may have spent fifty cents on two pounds of coffee, but he didn’t really give a shit. He had money. He was getting coffee, even if it had been one of the most expensive things in the store.
“Being around me hurt you.” Bucky said sadly. “I knew it did, but I didn’t know the reason behind that hurt. I was too empty to understand what it was doing to you.”
He looked down at his almost empty plate before looking back at Steve. “It was really good.” It was soft and almost mumbled in a pathetic kind of way that Bucky hated himself for. He was like an abused dog who was now afraid to bark for fear of getting beaten. Forcing himself to do better, he raised his voice and volunteered, “It tasted just like I remembered, thank you.”
It looked at Stark’s eyes. The brown reminded it of something warm, which was…different. Was it ready to begin?
Tony’s hands stopped briefly, then resumed before saying. “We don’t want you to be uncomfortable with anything. If you just want to wash, and for us to hold you after that, then that’s what we’ll do. We just want to make sure you’re ready before anything more happens.”
“You’re not alone,” Steve told him as he rubbed soothing circles on Bucky’s back. “I’ll always be here for you.” Steve kissed his temple once more before continuing, “Come on. We’ll go sit on the couch, and I’ll hold you all night if you want.”
you. Oh god, I hurt you so bad, Stevie!” His heart clenched at the nickname he never thought he’d hear again. “I almost killed you! I’m sorry, I’m so sorry! I’m sorry…”
Howard’s eyes met Tony’s, and yeah, Tony had seen that look before. Howard felt cheated and resented the hell out of Tony for stealing his moment. Of course Howard had probably already planned to use faraday cages inside the chamber to contain the energy. He had just wanted to point out a problem to make sure he got full credit when he solved it. You didn’t become a famous genius by quietly hiding your brilliance, after all, but for Howard it was a step by step process of “look at me, I’m so smart”.
“Are you kidding? I practically live here,” Bucky said, not missing a beat. “The service ain’t what it used to be, though.”
“I know,” Bucky sighed. “It’s just still a little hard to wrap my head around.” He eventually chuckled, “At least his body’s as big as his attitude now. I won’t have to save him from his mouth anymore.”
It was cold. It was always so cold here at night. The smell of dirt, blood and burnt earth, burnt flesh filled every breath he took. The coughing and moaning of the men around him were already becoming easy to ignore, background noise like the sounds of the city used to be. He tried to will himself to sleep, but it wasn’t coming soon. It was hard to sleep when he knew the enemy was out there looking for them.
“You some Abercrombie?” Joe spat the last word. “Some sissy swell who puts his nose where it don’t belong? I might end up breakin' it for ya.”
The metal canteen in Steve’s hand screeched as it twisted in his grip, and Steve fought to control his anger.
Mortar exploded in front of them as gunfire began to ring out in the distance. As one, Bucky and the men closest to him began running for cover. Fires were already beginning to catch and burn, lighting up the ground they ran across. He could see some of the other men falling as enemy bullets found their mark. As he ran, Bucky saw the man beside him hit with mortar fire as his limp body flew to the ground.
“And I won’t betray that trust.” He reached over to move Steve’s shirt up. The other man sat up to help him pull it over his head before laying back down. Tony then grasped the hem of his pajama pants and pulled them down his slim legs. He grabbed for the boxers but stopped, looking up for permission. Steve lifted his hips, eyes never leaving Tony’s as the last bit of clothing was removed, and he was fully bared to him.
“Well,” Tony added, “if I ever have to be away for a night, you could invite Ruth to dinner. I’m sure she’d love that.”
Bucky’s eyes held nothing but acceptance and understanding as he smiled softly. ”But you love him too.” It wasn’t a question. Hell, he didn’t even sound upset!
His hand continued its soft touches as he continued, “I can’t begin to understand what you went through, Buck, and I won’t insult you by saying everything is going to be alright. I promise you, though, it can get better. It will be hard, and some days are going to be worse than others, but it can get better a little at a time. I’m not giving up on you, Buck. Even if we can never have what we had before, I will still be here with you. We can both get better.”
Bucky groaned softly in frustration as Tony moved away from his neck to give him one more kiss. “As much as I would love to stay here in bed and show you everything my dream entailed, it would make me very late. I still have a lot of work to catch up on.”
The man was well dressed. At least, his clothes looked nicer than most of the pedestrians around them, some of which looked very worn, he should have a watch.
Steve looked panicked as he got up and hovered over Tony. “What’s wrong? Are you in pain? Do I need to get the nurse for more medicine?”
That pulled a reaction out of them. Steve frowned as he looked back down at Tony’s bloody shirt as if remembering the wound. Bucky almost tripped over his feet as he hurried the bandages to Tony. “Sorry! I forgot. Let’s get your shirt off, and I’ll help you clean and wrap the cut.”
Bucky tried to think of where to begin to describe his partner. “Well, the man is literally a genius. He speaks eight languages, I believe? So, watch what you say, Dernier, because he’ll know what your saying.” The Frenchman laughed at that.
“They sound like remarkable men,” Bruce said over his empty plate. The other’s around the table had also finished their meals.
“It’s meat from the butcher and ice for the icebox. I figured you could have some bacon with your eggs and beef with your potatoes.”
Next, he went to the butcher and spent another two dollars. The butcher shop also delivered ice, so Tony paid for them to deliver the meat he’d purchased along with the ice block to the apartment. He couldn’t let the meat spoil due to poor refrigeration.
“So how much is taboo art selling for these days?” Tony asked, looking through the sketches. They were pretty racy, but Steve’s talent was undeniable, the perfect balance of sensual and sexual.
It wasn’t until they got back to their own empty apartment that they really began to worry. Steve wasn’t the type to go off by himself at this time of night. It was a rough neighborhood, and there would be a lot of drunk idiots on the streets tonight.
As he sat across the table from Bucky, Steve’s mind replayed the last twenty-four hours. It had begun with Bucky teasing him all morning about Steve’s first successful date, and while he had enjoyed doing that with Lucille, he’d also known that it wouldn’t be enough to change him and how he felt about his best friend and sometimes lover.
Steve laughed. “Yeah, you certainly have a reputation as someone not to get in the way of. I didn’t even know what a personal assistant was until you explained it to me. Are all of them as scary as you?”
“Enough to help the medics, but it’s not my field of study.” Tony said honestly. He had several doctorates, but he was not a physician.
Now he was trapped in the past. A hopeless situation lay before him, but he refused to be helpless. He couldn’t allow himself that, not if he was going to keep what was his. It would be hard, wasn’t everything worth having? He’d fight. He’d push back. He’d use every tool at his disposal and remove anyone who stood in his way. He could do this. After all,
“Well, I’m off.” James sighed as he rose to his feet. “I hope Old Man Talbot’s in a better mood today. I think his wife must be makin’ him sleep on the couch. He was always a prick, but these past few days…” He ran a hand back through his hair. “…it’s just a whole new level.”
“Right, “Tony said, but internally wondering if Bucky could really teach him all of that in one evening.
Steve felt his own tears falling as he choked out his words, finally telling him everything he’d wanted to for over six months. “Don’t. Don’t do that, love.” The relief he felt at being able to say these words was nearly overwhelming. “It wasn’t your fault. It wasn’t your fault. God, I…”
“I needed to rest.” Tony soothed him. “I’m not denying that I was injured and needed rest, but they kept pumping me full of morphine and God knows what else to keep me asleep.”
country that was in danger. It illustrated that this was completely unprovoked and reminded citizens that as their fellow countrymen were dying and fighting for their lives, their government had been trying to continue diplomatic negotiations. And all in seven minutes. It was an unmitigated success.
“Oh, well, sorry about that. I lost track of time.” They didn’t look relieved by his answer, so he continued, “I was just walking, lost in my own head. I get like that. My brain never shuts up, you know. It’s worse than my mouth.”
They ate their meal, talking and laughing as they enjoyed each other’s company. None of them mentioned that Bucky would be leaving soon and would be gone for a few months. They spoke about what they would do until then. Tony had promised to put off work these next few days so they could all spend the time together. They planned what meals they wanted to share, and how they would go and get photos taken of them together. Tony only wished they would be allowed to look like they were
“That’s enough!” Tony said firmly, and both of their heads whipped around to him. “I’m stopping this right now before one of you says something you’ll really regret.”
my submission.” Then he flippantly added, “It’s difficult for someone to convince me that they know better than I would.”
Bucky hadn’t gotten that far in his new memories so that must have been the original timeline. He didn’t really care at the moment because he was in heaven. The bacon on the waffle wasn’t good. It was amazing. It was salty and sweet and soft and crunchy all at the same time. He was so happy he’d asked for this.
Tony shook his head. “No, I really can’t.” Tony turned to him. “Would you believe that was my best behavior?”
Steve gave him a shaky smile. “I guess I’m not surprised. You know how to fix everything else, why not my breathing?”
“Yes and no,” Bucky answered. “It’s probably not important, but I thought you might want to know. Because science and stuff… What Thor said is happening. I don’t think Tony can die, not from an accident anyway.”
For me, this is where Tony really begins his journey. The caterpillar is in his cocoon! Without his celebrity, money and stigma that still comes with his name, what kind of person would Tony be? If he's not surrounded by people who constantly try to use him, how would he now treat people? Sometimes a Great Man should be brought low, so that he can become (to quote Dr, Erskine) "A Good Man".
Philips stared him down for a full ten seconds before he turned to Erskine. “Well, it looks like you didn’t waste my time after all, Doctor.” He huffed as he walked away and called back, “I may even let him keep the beard.”
Bucky rolled his eyes. “Not if I can help it. Hey, Jim, mind if I call you Jim? You look like a Jim.”
As Tony looked at the group of men before him, he saw it on every one of their faces. Fury, to the point that most were fighting back tears.
at his bruises and split lip, telling him he was too nice a boy to go fighting those hooligans. They gave him advice to keep the swelling down.
Tony was still going to tell the butcher in the morning, just in case Byrne decided to do something stupid like try and cross Tony. He had to cover his bases, after all.
, Tony thought. He was really pleased with himself. The girl was very sweet and shy, but when he’d seen her sketching on a piece of paper at the nurses’ station and asked her about it, she’d come alive. She’d talked passionately about art and seemed so pleased at his sincere compliments and interest. Most men, apparently, had deemed her drawings a “cute hobby”. Assholes. Like a woman couldn’t be an artist?
“I believe he was going to offer me aid, or information or whatever. He mentioned something about a threat.” Tony tried to pacify her through his indignation of being thought of as useless.
“Yeah, so anyways, I was walking, not paying attention to the time or where I was, when I walked straight into Collins and his group of boy scouts. They said some things, then I said some things and before I knew it, I was teaching those misguided young men some manners.”
They walked in silence as they made their way back to the apartment. It was good because Tony’s head was throbbing and his jaw ached. The cut on his lip was a shadow compared to the burning pull of his stomach with every step he took.
“I think they noticed the prison break,” Tony said as guards burst through the doorway ahead of them.
“Captain America! How exciting!” A German accented voice called out over the chaos, and Steve saw a man in Nazi uniform emerge across the walkway from them. The small man with the briefcase from the basement was at his side. “So, I see Erskine managed it after all.”
When he opened his eyes, he half expected to see Jarvis looking at him across the table with the same fond, indulgent smile he wore just for Tony; however it was Steve and Bucky who returned his gaze.
, he prayed. They’d lose even more men with the complications that would bring. As he felt the first drop fall, he mentally swore that was the last prayer he’d ever waste his time on. Then, he saw them.
“A good color for a soldier,” Tony praised as his fingers started a fast and hard rhythm in and out of Steve’s ass. The hand on his dick moving just as quickly, pushing Steve towards the edge that was already so close. “Do I get to train you?” Tony asked. His voice was thick with lust. “I’d love to ruin this tight ass, but it might be too much for you. You might not be able to handle it.”
Lastly, Bucky was in trouble. He knew this. His sweet boy needed him, and there was nothing he could do about it. His frustration and fear had been steadily growing, and he knew Steve was worried about him. Tony had debated with himself at length over telling the blonde, but how would he do that?
Tony had learned as a child that his best was never good enough. His own parents had never wanted him around so what could he hope to give someone else? He had learned what was expected of him, and what would be accepted from him. People wanted money, fame by association, expensive gifts, orgasms…but they never wanted Tony. So he’d learned to act like he gave no fucks.
Steve rubbed at his temples and said, “I don’t understand that reference. What the hell do butterflies have to do with this?”
“Now we start searching through the data,” Natasha said. “There wasn’t a record of Anthony Sutton, yesterday.”
Silence followed Bucky’s words. They all knew what would happen, Tony more than the others. Bucky was about to leave, and there was nothing he could do to stop it. He’d go to a base somewhere and train, then he’d be shipped off.
Maggie, Buck. You shoulda heard the disgusting things he was saying. It’s not right to let him spread that shit around about her. She’s too nice a gal for that.”
“So, all that talk about him adopting and taking care of you and the Captain all these years was true.” Gabe said. “I mean, I thought it was mostly joking, but the guy can’t seem to help looking after people, can he? Not that it’s a bad thing.”
“I’ve listened to the reports of the Captain, Agent Carter, Howard Stark and several of the rescued officers. They each told their observations and detailed the assistance you provided to Captain Rogers and the prisoners that were freed. So, after hearing all of that, I’ve just got one thing to ask. Who the hell are you, Stark?”
He could hear them talking softly as he approached, but when he entered the room, the conversation died. If Tony was prone to paranoia, he would think they’d been talking about him. Okay, maybe he was a little bit paranoid.
That broken thing inside Steve broke just a little more at the blank stare on Bucky’s face. “Do you even care at all?” He asked hopelessly. “You know Tony. He’s helped you a lot. He’s one of the only people you allow to touch you when he works on your arm. He’s gone out of his way to keep you out of prison, introduced you to music he thought you’d like. I thought you…I thought you’d learned to care at least a little about him.”
Finally, they saw the gate that marked the entrance to the camp and allied territory, and Steve knew he wasn’t the only one who breathed a sigh of relief. The soldiers at the gate and beyond were shouting about their return as the way was opened for them. Soldiers were running towards them as they marched into camp, and before long Steve could see Agent Carter quickly moving to them.
Phillips nodded. “He told me you were important to the project and the war. Honestly, I just thought he was trying to make sure you kept your job.”
“I’m sorry for just coming in here,” Bucky murmured, “I should have asked, but I just…I wanted…” He closed his eyes, looking pained as he forced the words out. “Can I please stay here?”
He looked up from the bronzed bird he’d set at the center. Steve and Bucky were gaping at the spread on the table. “Is it right? I tried to go traditional Irish, but honestly some of the recipes I got from the neighbors were well beyond my level of expertise…”
Bucky rushed to grab Dugan’s arm and hold him back. The last thing they needed was for Dum-Dum to beat the guy senseless, no matter how satisfying it would be.
the wet sounds of Bucky sucking Steve off. The word Deepthroating ran through his mind at the sound.
Steve grinned, “I had to give you the chance.” Bucky just looked unimpressed, so Steve continued, “Alright, but what about the others?”
Steve huffed and rolled to the side, but Tony just rolled with him so that they lay snuggled together. Steve sighed as Tony lay an arm over his chest and gently rubbed his beard on Steve’s shoulder. “That was very different but in a very good way,” Steve quietly agreed with him before he looked down see Tony’s body and his breath caught.
Tony watched as Steve’s head fell forward and bounced limply with every thrust Tony made, unable to finish his sentences.
Steve chuckled, probably at both Tony’s dramatics and the memory of all the times Bucky had whined the same way about someone he’d wanted to hit. “Is this man in danger? Do I have to worry about you going after him?” He teased.
Bucky nodded quickly, “We are. Yeah, it was a little much to take in at first, and I don’t think I’d be as comfortable if you weren’t here to help with the menu, but this is incredible.”
“He told me ‘Hi’ first,” Steve said because of course the little shit would say something like that.
Steve had the strangest feeling that whatever he was about to be told would change everything for him.
Yes, the last six months had been a mine field of new experiences for him, as he tried to navigate around each new situation and not trigger an explosion. Everything was so foreign. He knew that Steve was disappointed with him. He could see it in the blonde’s eyes, but Bucky didn’t understand what the man wanted from him. He didn’t know how to make that hurt and worry go away. He also didn’t know why that hurt and worry bothered him. He just knew that it did. Another instinct, he supposed.
September brought another cold reality that hit Tony like a slap in the face. The government instituted the first peacetime draft in the history of the country. The Selective Training and Service Act required all men between the ages of 21 and 45 to register for the draft. Tony, who technically fit the requirements and had long ago acquired forged identification documents, went with Steve and Bucky.
Tony’s hips sped up as his hand squeezed just a bit tighter around his throat in a final effort to push Steve past the edge. “My beautiful boy. My perfect soldier. So strong. So worthy. Come for me,” Tony panted as he felt his balls tighten under Steve’s trembling body. “Come now!”
It’s harder to plan something when their empty stomachs only added to the tiredness of their bodies, harder but not impossible. Bucky remembered the week they’d been forced to go without rations because they’d been suspected of sabotage in the factory that had killed an officer. It had been a long week. Now, even with their rations returned to them, it was little better. Just sitting here talking felt like work, but it was a way to keep their spirits from breaking completely.
Bucky’s head spun at the amount of things Tony juggled every day. It was a testament to how good Tony was that he could get even half of that done in one day, but Bucky knew he would finish it all by the time he got home tonight.
She giggled, a soft feminine sound, though she looked a little nervous after a moment. “Shameless, perhaps, but still charming. I'm surprised you don't find yourself with more friends. You came here from California?”
Steve blushed but looked relieved. Bucky was looking at him with a mix of approval, admiration and…something Tony couldn’t quite place.
Steve began to lightly stroke himself with the hand that wasn’t soothing Bucky as he watched Tony eat the younger man out. Tony would urgently tongue at him before slowing down his movements to almost a tease, keeping Bucky in a constant state of new forms of stimulation. The man was practically begging at this point so Tony decided it was time to move on.
Bucky’s mind continued to replay the thoughts and memories of that week, his last few days of training before finally going home. He remembered Dum-Dum and the guys, and he remembered that asshole Williams giving him shit throughout all of it. Even the bus ride home had been filled with the guy talkin’ crap because he’d heard Bucky tell Dugan, who’d wanted to see the gals Bucky had been getting letters from, that his sweethearts wouldn’t be meeting him at the station. They didn’t know about each other, and he didn’t want them meeting. Williams had just gone on about how it was really because they didn’t exist. Bucky had been ready to hit the guy by the time the bus had arrived where their families were waiting.
“I know most of the soldiers don’t like me, Tony, and when I see myself in this get-up, I can’t really blame them, but it might not be so bad.” Steve said as he looked to the stage entrance. “At least, I hope so, but no matter what we’ll still ask for news about Bucky after, alright?”
“Fuck you, Barton, I don’t have cooties, and if you can stick your tongue in Wilson’s ass, you can drink out of a recently used novelty mug.”
“Yes, fuck yes, Steve, use me. I wanna feel it. I want to, need to…feel,” was all Tony got out before he went completely pliant in Steve’s lap.
“It’s not free, it’s mostly a trade.” He corrected. “I'll still get paid, just a lower amount with the implied healthcare benefits, and I’ll still be working odd jobs around the neighborhood, but I’ll be on call for when the hospital needs me. I might even get more jobs with the hospital staff if any of their appliances break down. It’s a win-win for everybody.”
Bucky moaned thickly with his mouth full, and Tony opened his eyes to watch the two as he kept up his teasing.
Tony smirked. “From the Vulcans, actually. An intelligent and enlightened race I’ve studied for years with the help of Gene Roddenberry.”
So here it is. The summary kinda says it all. Thank you to all of you who have stayed with this. For new readers, welcome!
“Are you serious?” Steve seemed upset. “We’re not gonna let you go to one of those places!” He looked at James who nodded once. “You’re welcome to stay with us. If you don’t mind the couch, that is.”
“He is,” Bucky agreed as he watched Steve resume his cooking. They fell into a thoughtful silence for a while as Steve worked on cooking the bacon and starting the waffles, and Bucky thought about what they could have once Tony returned to them. He wanted it so bad, but part of him wondered if it was even possible. The memories of his torture and sexual aversion still haunted him. He knew he’d need a lot of help to get past it, but maybe he could with Steve and Tony.
Tony shrugged off his jacket and handed it to the doctor before he walked over to the left of the training area. There were several long ropes hanging from a wooden frame about twenty feet from the ground. He rolled up his sleeves and grabbed the outer rope.
The men on watch quickly pointed their guns as they sensed the approach of people, but as a few of them recognized him, they lowered their weapons and shouted, “It’s the Captain!”
“Ah fuck, yeah,” Steve groaned, “you gonna swallow it all when I spill down your throat, Bucky? Suck down every drop?” The muffled hum from Bucky suggested he really liked that idea. “Of course you will. You never let it go to waste do you? Even when you hold me down and lick my stomach clean. What would the other fellas think if they could see you so hungry for it?”
“I am still functional.” It said truthfully. Its shoulder damage was irrelevant. The arm needed maintenance. It was its strongest weapon.
“Bullshit,” Bucky said tiredly as he sat against the bars of their cell. “That is bullshit. I’ve known you for almost a year now, Dugan. There’s no way you were in the circus.”
Tony shrugged, hating the fact that he was already having to lie to Bucky. “Well, they didn’t give me much choice. They wanted to keep me there covered in plaster when none of my bones were even broken.”
Bucky exhaled in relief as most of the others around him did the same, nodding that it was more than fine by them. Bucky would climb every stair in the building if it meant he didn’t have to get in that thing. When they reached the stairs and were further away from the people in the lobby, they finally began to speak.
“I’m so glad you’re home, Tony.” Steve told him quietly. “I don’t know what we would have done if we’d lost you.”
“You should.” Bucky breathed quietly. He had leaned in over the course of the conversation, Tony realized, his face just inches away. His lidded eyes focused on Tony’s.
Steve and Bucky returned to the kitchen and started cleaning up the mess from breakfast. Steve was still sometimes amazed at how fast Tony had picked up cooking because the man was now flourishing at it. Those pancakes were as good as any Steve had ever had, not to mention the meals Tony helped with or the Christmas dinner he’d done by himself. If Tony put his mind to something, he succeeded. Period.
As the men began to file out of the cages, Steve handed the keys to one of the prisoners to help free the others.
No, he would just be a man that shares a resemblance and had most likely been dead for years. Tony could live with that as long as he got to live with Steve and Bucky after this was over. Because there was no after without Steve and Bucky. Tony knew this. If history repeated itself like it was hell bent on doing, and he lost them… Well, Tony didn’t need to be a genius to know how he would handle that.
What was wrong with him? Sure, Steve had been aroused too, but he was young and inexperienced and had been listening to a woman in the throes of her passion. Tony had to give it to Marie; she had made some damn sexy sounds and seemed very responsive. It was only natural for Steve to have gotten off on it.
Steve's plan to show Tony that they care about him is underway, even as Tony is trying to distance himself from his feelings and fight the depression they caused. It was decided that their friendship is too important for any of them to admit their attraction, but then someone slips, and a new kind of bravery is shown through desperation and paying attention to the right things.
“It’s melted cheese and bread that you eat with sticks, not whatever you’re thinking,” Tony told him quietly as he absently rubbed his hand.
Howard pasted on a smile that nearly looked genuine. “Yeah, that should work. Good thinking, Anthony.”
In the end it wasn’t so bad. He’d nicked himself a couple times but not too bad. He’d gone slowly and the result was more than satisfactory. Pretty good for a first attempt. He used the small scissors to trim his moustache and tip if his chin. He didn’t want to look like Don Quixote, after all.
Bucky leaned against the steel edge of the table he was clutching as warmth filled his chest and a sense of awe swept through him. He pushed away at the memories and feelings even harder.
Bucky whined at the feeling, trying to let himself go. His fingers and toes were tingling as they curled in the sheets. Every inch of him had been rubbed and kissed and petted over the course of the evening, and he let himself fall into it. The tremors in his body continued, but he gave into them. It had been months since he’d trembled with anything but fear and hunger, and the pleasure he felt was washing all of it away.
Everyone had always expected the same of Tony, and it was bullshit. He was perfectly capable of respecting the genius of other people because he knew how it felt to be treated otherwise.
Steve watched the skepticism on the faces of Sam and Clint. Natasha’s face, as usual, betrayed nothing. Of course, she was never one to believe in things like hopeful wishes. She was the kind of person who created their own hope through action.
“I know that I would love either of those things, but I also need to know what you like. What do you not like? Is there something I should know never to do?” He looked from Bucky to Steve and back again. “For instance, I’m good with being on top or bottom, though it’s been a while since I bottomed, and usually I take control then, too. It’s a thing with me.”
And that was that. Colonel Philips turned and walked away, leaving Steve alone and confused. He sighed heavily and opened the door to find an almost empty barrack.
Tony had to remind himself to breathe as his mind raced with possibilities as to where Erskine was going with this.
Two hours later Bucky was laying on one of the large couches in the common area with his head resting on Steve’s lap. The blonde was gently running his fingers through Bucky’s hair, and he was fine with just resting and enjoying the feel of it. He found the contact soothing, something that was both foreign and familiar at the same time.
“We really don’t want to think about that anymore. We worried about it all day.” Steve said. “We’d rather move forward and talk about something that makes us happy.”
The soldier jolted and faced the other way as the rest of the men followed suit. It dawned on Steve that none of them had probably considered what Tony had said before now. They didn’t realize their treatment of him was insubordination.
From beside him Steve dimly heard Bucky say, “This really was the Devil’s basement. What the hell did that to him?” But Steve didn’t have time to think on that because the men were now walking to a door, intent to escape now that Steve and the others were trapped. Cowards.
“And we heard yours for days, Sarge,” Dugan said with anger and guilt in his voice. “You lasted longer than any of the others.”
“You know, ‘it puts the lotion on its skin’. You have to take care of your skin, it’s your biggest organ. Well, it is for most people anyway,
They heard voices outside the tent getting louder, so Tony removed his hand and sat back on his cot. The future Commandos all came in at that moment. Dugan and Gabe each held a tray of food in their hands. As the others maneuvered the cramped space to their cots, they handed the food to Tony and Bucky before finding a way to their own.
The door opened and there stood Mr. Byrne. Tony would never be friendly enough with him to use his first name. “What…oh, it’s you.” The man looked disgusted.
Howard turned as if to reach for a tool on the table next to him, but Tony caught the eye roll he was trying to cover. “That’s why I needed those figures. If there’s a power surge during Rebirth, it could branch out to everyone on the test floor. The guy inside the chamber should be fine if the serum does its job, but everyone else could be in for one hell of an energy blast.”
“I was technically in the army until a few months ago as a consultant,” Tony reminded him. “I proved myself useful then, and I’ll do it again now.” At least, Tony hoped he would.
“He’s been helping me since the project,” Steve cut him off. They didn’t have time for this. Tony wasn’t the issue here. “Sir, I need the casualty list from Azzano.”
“Stevie’s always been good at cards.” Bucky chimed as he dealt their new hands. “Twerp doesn’t like to lose.”
Rhodey would not have let last night slide. He’d be hounding Tony to talk more about it and offering unasked for advice. He’d be doing it out of love, yeah, but it would just end up in an argument with Tony feeling caged and frustrated, ready to lash out.
He had known this was coming, but he’d fallen in love anyway. He’d fallen in love knowing he would lose them all too soon. That didn’t mean he wasn’t going to fight it. Tony was the smartest person he knew.
followed by Collins and his guys. We hurried over to help, but when we saw you fighting…we just froze in shock.”
“No!” Steve said firmly. “I know you, Bucky. You never wanted to kill anyone. You even hated fighting when we were kids, but you did it to protect me. You always looked out for me.”
“Oh God, which ones?” Barton asked as he and Sam entered the kitchen. “You’re not using my coffee mug, are you?”
And wasn’t that just Steve Rogers in a nut shell? He’d known Tony less than twenty-four hours and was willing to house and feed him even though he and James had precious little to spare. He called him his friend. Not teammate, friend. Tony’s chest warmed someplace where his heart should be.
As he walked in to their apartment, however, the song he was whistling died on his lips. His first thought was surprise that Bucky was already home. He’d normally be at the docks for several more hours, but then he finally took in the full scene.
“Your key,” Tony held out his hand and waited as it was fished out of a pocket and placed into his palm. “I’ll just turn this in to the landlord in the morning as part of my new duties as superintendent.”
his words. “So strong. And good. And smart. Such a good soldier. The best soldier. You’re gonna prove everyone wrong.” He could feel Steve tightening around him, which was good because Tony was struggling to keep himself together. “I
He cupped a handful of the other side of Bucky’s ass, kneading it gently before bringing his hand back for another, firmer hit. The brunet let out a strangled sound.
He could still see the doubt Steve had as he asked, “And you’re sure this is alright? I don’t want you risking yourself over not wanting to be here.”
Bucky moaned, “Tony, please. Wanna come.” His usually velvet smooth voice was completely fucked out, and Tony felt a surge of pride that he was partly responsible for that.
Steve just added more lube to Tony’s open hole before he plunged his fingers back inside. Tony jerked, the movement made his throat convulse around Bucky who groaned again. Steve set a punishing pace with his hand, and all the while never touching Tony’s prostate.
Bruce asked quietly, “Are you sure there is no way to break the curse? To spare him from that? There has to be something we can do; we need him back, Thor.”
dame I go with sweet thing. You know why?” Steve just continued to gasp softly until Bucky continued. “Because they’re all interchangeable. They don’t mean anythin’ to me except for the cover they give me. People need to think I want those gals, but I could never want any of them more than I want you. You’re my baby doll, always, the most precious thing in my life. You always give me what I need. I love you, Steve.”
The pain was becoming a distant memory. It felt so good. Everything felt good, and Bucky’s body was starting to lightly tremble from the combination of their words and their hands. All of his nerves were singing, and he could feel his need building even as he wanted to just let this last forever. The choice between desire and comfort was beginning to circle in his mind, but the decision was made for him when he finally felt a finger at his opening. With his eyes closed, he didn’t know who it belonged to, but it didn’t matter, he just wanted to be filled. He wanted to willingly surrender his body to someone who loved him.
“Besides boy scout, you think I didn’t come prepared?” Tony said as he lowered himself to rub along the head of Steve’s dick.
So Tony held out his hand in offering, and Howard reached out to clasp it, sealing their new truce. “I can live with those terms.”
They’d made it back. With the enemy’s map and supplies they’d found; Bucky had been able to get them to safety two days later without losing any more men. Bucky had been told he’d receive a commendation and most likely a medal for it. A captain and a colonel had shaken his hand and told him they were proud of his achievement and heroism.
Bucky was already up and getting the leftover bandages he’d placed on the dresser. He brought them to the bed before turning back to grab the empty glass Tony had used last night and left the room. He heard the tap run from somewhere in the apartment and figured Bucky was refilling the glass while Steve was still hovering over him waiting for Tony’s permission to lift his shirt.
Screw this, Bucky thought, he’d had enough. If the man wanted to be an ass and talk about his personal business, Bucky would give him a reason to keep some of his thoughts to himself. “I didn’t fuck him, Barton.” Bucky said pointedly. “He fucked me, and it was fantastic. Do you wanna know what I liked to call him?”
“Maybe, but I also bring out the worst,” Bucky said to him. “Not that your worst is all that terrible. You’re selfless to a fault, Stevie, but I know that I’m the one person who could get you to turn your back on everything if you thought it was best for me. It’s not just anyone who could get you to do that.”
“Touché,” Tony conceded, “but you are the most honest of the three of us, so I don’t know what that says about me.”
“No, that’s fine.” Bucky found his voice. “I just didn’t expect you to be alright with it.” He coughed, uncomfortable.
Tony just nodded. “I’m calling it the Mark 1.” He smiled at his private joke. “I’ll install it later today after we eat. There should be just enough room in the corner of the kitchen.”
“I want you know,” Tony told her, “that as a neighbor and friend, I’m here to help if ever you need it. I know this must have been a shock for you.”
“Why would they do this?” Steve asked angrily at no one in particular. “They had families living there. Women and children and they attacked them too!”
Tony nodded as he sat in the chair that would put him between his boys at the square table. He wanted them on both his sides.  “James got himself a dream job today. We’re celebrating.”
“But I don’t need councilmen, or policemen, or businessmen, or a landlord who would happily throw your ass out on the street once your wife left you. I am a genius with an IQ higher than you could probably count to.” Tony quietly raged, “And I want you gone. Now, out of our lives, out of our building, out of this city or I promise you will not live to regret it.  It would be only too easy for me to get rid of you.
As the last one passed them, Tony said, “Now,” and Steve moved swiftly. Before Tony could register the sensation of his flight, he was passing through the back flap of the truck and landing roughly on his hands and knees. Steve entered more gracefully a second later.
He works, rebuilding and repairing tech all over the neighborhood as his reputation spreads. People exclaiming that he doesn’t just fix their things, he improves them. After Tony Stark gets his hands on something, it works better than it had when they’d bought it.
After another minute or so, Tony obliged and ran the flat of his tongue right down his middle, starting below the balls and finishing at his tailbone. He returned to gently suck on the rim, adding tiny licks to loosen Bucky as he grew accustomed to this new sensation.
His hand was almost on the doorknob when he heard the moan again, but this time it was followed by Bucky’s voice.
“Of course,” he replied easily, “you can’t eat a suit. Well, maybe you could, but that can’t be good for you.”
If, god forbid, his plan failed and he couldn’t get back, he might be with them for a while until he could find work or somewhere to go. If they let him stay, that is. He didn’t want to think about not getting back to his time, but Tony was a realist, and he always had backup plans. If he had to stay…It would explain away his nightmares and his scars and the fact that he could confidently go up against four street thugs and subdue their leader without breaking a sweat.
The colonel abruptly turned, ending the conversation before either man could respond, and all the while grumbling about “civilian jackasses” and “rather shoot my foot than deal with this” and “should have hired that roll of toilet paper to handle this shit”.
All of them were in very high spirits as they finally piled into two taxis, which Tony ended up paying for, and left for the bank. Everyone waited outside with their duffels for Tony to finish his business in the building.
“Which was never explained to me,” Howard interjected, looking frustrated. “I’m the best engineer in the country, and that nearly wasn’t enough to get me here. What the hell is it that makes you so special that you can literally walk in here off the street and into my lab? Where do you get the nerve to tell me that my math could be wrong and my work is incomplete without more testing?”
This continued for several more minutes, and Tony actually began to slowly lose himself. The need to focus on what Bucky’s mouth was doing made him feel every sensation more intensely. The task of replicating it on Steve drove all other thought from his mind.
Steve’s head was thrown back as he released in Tony’s stroking hand, painting his thin chest with ropes of come. Bucky moaned beneath them, and Tony could feel his sweetheart clenching down on him as he rode his orgasm.
Tony feigned ignorance. “It’s a rough neighborhood, Steve. People get hurt all the time. Especially people who go looking for trouble.”
God, he missed Tony. The memories he now had of him were some of the best of Steve’s life, and he knew Bucky felt the same way. Looking at those memories, Steve could appreciate how hard it must have been for the man, knowing so much but never getting to explain. Steve smiled a little as he caught all the subtle hints Tony had given. Suggestions, insights and advice that were carefully worded to prepare them for a future they hadn’t known was coming.
Speaking of the big, blonde and beautiful soldier, Tony silently swore that he would at least get Steve to smile. He arrived at the steps of the stage as Steve was making his way down.
Tony lifted his arms and did as instructed. He could feel the muscles of Bucky’s back through the shirt beneath his palm. The warm heat of his skin radiated through the fabric. The hand on his own shoulder was a light caress. Tony swallowed but focused on Bucky’s face.
“I’m always up for a movie.” He answered as he finished his shuffling. “Same game? Or are we playing somethin’ new?”
“I think I’ll volunteer the Nazis for that one, sir.” Tony said seriously because he kind of believed the man’s threat. Tony wasn’t that anxious to test his healing factor, and he certainly didn’t want a bullet hole to worry about. Steve would freak the fuck out.
It was Steve. God, he was small. Tony had seen pictures. They all had. They’d even been to that exhibit at the Smithsonian, but it was just too surreal seeing it with his own eyes. He felt like he towered over the smaller man. Steve’s shoulders were hunched in, not like the broad confident soldier he lived and fought with, and his breath was coming out with a little wheezing noise.
Bucky let out a shaky exhale as he melted a little more against the hand on his neck, taking the comfort Tony offered. It was done less out of dejection and more out of relief and acceptance. He was showing his faith in Tony, his belief that Tony really would take care of this. Of Steve. Of Bucky. Tony’s chest warmed. This was something he knew he could do, was good at. He’d provided for his teammates back home. Allowed them to live without the worry of paying bills. Buying them things that he knew they’d enjoy so they could destress and just live for a moment like normal people who deserved to be happy.
He ran a soothing hand down Bucky’s flank. His other softly ran over Steve’s thigh. “So good, sweetheart.” He panted as he continued to push forward, never stopping. “Always so perfect for me. Both of you.”
“You look so perfect beneath us,” Steve told him. “Your skin is flushed and gorgeous, love. Is your Daddy holding that cock of yours nice and tight? Does he feel good inside you?”
The coffee machine beeped, and Tony blinked out of his internal musings. Mentally cursing that he allowed himself to angst all over the kitchen counter, he poured the rich, black liquid into his Power Puff Girls coffee mug (Thor’s a huge fan). He hums with the first sip. Delicious. Like an addict getting his fix, he relaxes. A small smile quirks on his lips.
The group was now at the middle of the clearing, and he saw when they spotted the gift that he’d left for them. A blood-stained pack of a soldier they’d lost two days ago was laid out next to the now smoldering remains of a “campfire” he’d had the men build. It was meant to look recently used as if the soldier it belonged to must have hidden when he’d sensed them coming. He watched it all through the scope of his rifle.
Steve wondered how long it had been since Bucky had a decent meal, or any meal for that matter. “How long’s it been since you’ve eaten, Buck?”
Tony chuckled at that. “Well, no offense, Buck, but that makes me feel a tiny bit better. It would make this whole thing even more awkward, and it’s plenty awkward enough.”
Steve’s eyes widened as he twisted and frantically began pulling at the bottom of Tony’s shirt. “Shit! I’m so sorry Tony,” he apologized as he smoothed a hand over Tony’s scabbed abdomen. “Is it bad? Are you bleeding again?”
“That part actually sounds really nice.” Bucky admitted quietly. No thinking, no worrying, just feeling. “Could I really do that?”
Tony was not lost to the irony that this was James Barnes saying this to him. Because in seventy years, Tony would very well be able to say those same words to him with a much more profound meaning. Life was going to be very cruel to this young man all too soon. And he
The blonde huffed out a breath as he slowly rose from the ground. His small fists were clenched in front of him even as he swayed a little. He spit some of the blood from his lip.
Steve shrugged. “It’s not our business. Yeah, it’s illegal, but we don’t think it’s right to tell someone what to do with their body. It’s just another form of bullying, going after someone cuz they’re different.” Then his eyes narrowed. “What about you? Is it a problem?”
“Lovely name,” he returned the smile. “Louise, would you grant me the privilege of accompanying me to the dance tonight?” God, he felt like he was in a cheesy black and white movie, which he realized he kind of was.
He was so out of it, even after Bucky had arrived, and they’d left to find Steve. He knew he was distracted. Then, as if to top everything off about today, they’d found Steve in an alley getting his face adjusted. Tony had let Bucky handle it. He wasn’t in the right mind at the moment to hold back, and it was daytime with too many witnesses for Tony to deal with the guy, but he knew he would if he found the guy again. He’d memorized the guys face and silently started planning every punch the asshole would be receiving. It was probably wrong of him, but he didn’t care.
Partly out of desperation, he’d agreed to go with Steve, and they had eventually ended up here at the tower. It had been very overwhelming. The number of people living here had set him on edge, but it was the way they treated him that was the hardest to adjust to. They acted like he was a person. They talked to him and asked him questions, but none of it was related to a mission or training. None of them had ever tried hurt him.
“I think it’s the human in you.” Tony chuckled. Then he thought of another way of giving the man a clue. “What you’re working on, it will physically change someone, right?”
Holy fuck, Steve had a way words, but Tony definately agreed that he wanted Bucky inside him. In any capacity.
Of course he and Tony had had sex without Bucky before. They’d all been together over two years, and everyone wasn’t always home at the same time. However, a relationship without Bucky being present just felt so alien to Steve, and he couldn’t fully explain why. He loved Tony so much. Different than Bucky, sure, but he knew it was the same way for all of them, different reasons behind their love.
Steve huffed a laugh, but he appreciated Tony trying to make this more comfortable for him. “I think I liked you being in charge as much as I did because it let me watch, more than I would have if I’d been the one deciding things.”
and write a note for his future self to not go to the Sanctum that morning. He could at least do that, right?
“Don’t mention it, man.” Sam told him. “Just promise to find one of us if Steve’s not around, and you need to talk.”
Steve looked back at the much happier soldiers and was filled with pride for his partner. Even when Tony was struggling with his own worries, he still managed to remember the people around him.
Tony stared back at the wide-eyed expressions of Steve and Bucky as he staggered to his feet. This was bad. So bad.
That made Tony feel guilty. Steve had always talked about growing up poor and struggling. He had not been exaggerating. Their belongings were sparse and worn with age. The little food that they had was very basic, cheap and filling. And there was nothing wrong with that, they just deserved better, especially after having taken Tony in.
He’d returned to their empty apartment and begun packing what was important, the truly priceless things that would most likely be thrown away by someone else. Steve’s art and sketches, their photos, letters and keepsakes from Steve and Bucky’s mothers were all packed away with loving care. Tony then went to visit Ruth. He’d handed her a notarized letter that stated the remaining contents of the apartment belonged to her. All of Tony’s appliances were for her. She was free to sell or donate whatever she chose.
The last week of October brought with it a deep chill from the north. People on the streets breathed out little puffs of clouds, and Tony was repairing a lot of radiators and furnaces.
“Yes, sir,” Tony breathed as he settled into the frame of mind he needed to be in. This was the part of submission he enjoyed, being used like an object. He’d told Steve as much, and so far, he was delivering.
Hours later Tony was walking back to Brooklyn Heights, wondering at how his life had brought him here and thinking about how screwed he was.
Her eyes sharpened a little as she looked at him. “Though I have to say that the biggest surprise wasn’t that he left, though that was certainly a surprise. No, it was when I went to the landlord this morning to tell him about my husband leaving. He explained he already knew because
Their dates were pretty little things, both dressed nice with their hair done up. Bucky’s date was curvy with pale blonde hair. Steve’s was a  brunet who stood several inches taller than him. She also didn’t seem to be paying him any notice as Bucky and Marie? Marian? Went out to the dance floor.
“Oh.” Steve, now uncomfortable, looked past him to the repaired water heater. “I can’t believe you did all that in a couple hours. It’s just,” he shook his head, “you’ve fought in battles, and clearly you were an important guy. That suit you were wearing had to be expensive, like something a swell wears. You know how to repair appliances and lighting. You use a lot of big words when you talk so you must have had a good education. Is there anything you can’t do?”
“Tony, move faster,” Steve gritted out as he panted and opened his eyes. Tony looked like he was in…well the word bliss came to mind until Steve saw the small smirk.
“Tony,” Bucky said softly as he waited for him to meet his eyes, “that still doesn’t make it any less impressive, or appreciated.” He looked thoughtfully at him across the table. “What else do you know how to fix?”
Steve groaned as Tony pushed the digit into him, and he pushed back against it. Tony pulled the finger back then moved in again. “Time to use your fingers, baby boy.” Tony told him as his own continued its thrusting, slowly gaining momentum. “Get him nice and open for me, and I’ll let you sit on his dick.”
And just like that, the spell was broken, and Tony instantly looked relieved as the other men nodded quickly. Dernier was speaking happily in French as he nodded his head, and Bucky really wished he’d had Tony teach him the language so he could understand the man.
Tony breathed deeply as emotions flooded him. He hadn’t had sex without a shirt since Afghanistan. “I, I can if you want. It’s just usually not…”
Steve choked around a sob, his tears began falling freely now as the words poured out of him. “What good is being a hero if I can’t save the people I love? Tony is trapped there, and I’m going to leave him behind. Anything that happens to him after that is on me, and I can’t…I can’t…”
Steve and Bucky were, of course, in the more tolerant group of people. It also explains why Mr. Martinelli would have been so touched at Tony helping his daughter and valued his prolonged friendship with the boys.
Bucky finally stopped fighting his memories! My poor baby, at least things are a little better for him. Now he just needs Tony and he can be home again.
Bucky shuddered and closed his eyes as if in pain, and Tony’s worry increased. He squatted down in front of the younger man and hesitantly put his hand on the side of his neck trying to soothe him. Bucky leaned into the touch and let out a shuddered breath before he opened his eyes. They were red rimmed and wet.
The blast of another explosion was so close that Bucky felt his skin burn with the heat of it, and Dugan’s hat was blasted from his head. Bucky continued to fire as Dugan took a brief moment to pick up his beloved hat. Bucky yelled out “Here they come!”
He watched as Steve bit on his bottom lip. Tony knew he was trying to organize what he wanted to say. It was hard for Steve to admit when he was struggling with something.
Tony had heard this speech before when he’d studied history. It was cleverly written to appeal not to the idealism of building a better world through war, which had been heavily opposed by most Americans throughout the 1930s who simply wanted to stay out of foreign affairs, but to appeal to the patriotism of the people. It was
Steve looked terrified at the thought of them being taken as he wrapped an arm around Bucky and pulled him closer, trying to comfort them both.
“You’re right about one thing, Tony.” Steve said. “Your father really was an asshole.” He took a deep breath. “But you’re wrong about everything else. I can’t imagine what it was like to go through any of that, but whoever you were when you were younger, you’re not that person anymore. And I think that what you had to suffer through is payment enough for the mistakes you’ve made, especially when you’re still suffering from it.”
When their dates were over, the evening would always end with the three of them in bed, bringing each other off in spectacular fashion. They’d all come so far, and it was the happiest Tony had ever been.
“Of course I do.” Steve took the small risk and kissed him, letting every ounce of affection he could pass through it. “And I love you. And I love us. I wouldn’t change it or you.”
Tony shivered, and he knows they both saw it. If Tony could submit to someone, it would be Steve, especially when he used that voice. His voice was husky as he replied, “Like I told you before, beautiful, I’d love to follow your orders.”
Steve diplomatically answered, “Just get us as close as you can. We’ll find our way from there.” He looked to Howard at the front, then to Agent Carter. “You two are going to be in a lot of trouble when you land.”
“You’re so strong.” Tony told him as his hips bucked up faster. Steve was going to come on Tony’s dick
“I’m grateful. I really am,” Tony assured him, “but you already have a brain for your lab. Howard’s got that in hand, and you don’t need two of us there.”
He was numb to their echoing cries in the onslaught. Each time his bullet found its mark, he would empty the chamber and fire again. The men he hit did not get up. Breath steady, even as his pulse raced, he continued until the last few men had retreated into the trees, going back the way they’d came.
Dugan lifted a hand to his jaw and winced, “If you do end up hitting me in the morning, Jones, avoid the mouth. I think that damned Frenchman already loosened some teeth.”
“Same goes for me, man.” Sam said at her side. “I’m always here if you need to talk, or if you just want some company while you run or workout. This shit ain’t easy, but it can get easier.”
He handed one to Tony, who murmured his thanks, before he went to a cabinet a got out a bottle of pills. The label said Anacin. Tony watched Steve pop two of the pills in his mouth and chased them down with his water before returning the bottle to its cupboard.
Tony just smiled. “Thanks, Howard,” he said happily, verbally making them equals before turning to Erskine. “Say doc, you want to show me where I could get a decent cup of coffee. My roommate kept me up all night.”
“Don’t talk about yourself like that,” Tony snapped, “like there’s something wrong with you. So what if you
“I want to help.” Tony said. “And I know Captain Rogers is going to need it. I believe in him. I’ve followed at his side for months now, and honestly, I’m just crazy enough to follow him into whatever he’s going up against. I can fight, and I know how to survive. I’ll take the lab position if that’s all I get, but I have to believe that I can do more than that. You said it yourself, I'm more than just a brain.”
Looking handsome (at least, he thought so) in his favorite 3-piece suit, he impatiently drummed his fingers on the marble counter as he thumbed through his Starkpad. His eyes flickering to the agonizingly slow trickle of coffee every few seconds.
His date, Lucille, hadn’t so much as batted an eye when the two groups had met outside the hotel. They’d struck up a conversation and hadn’t stopped talking since. They’d discussed their favorite artists, the styles that influenced their own work and their favorite subjects to sketch.
“Yes,” Steve admitted as he narrowed his eyes on Tony, “and somehow, every person who gave me shit and beat on me has ended up in the hospital.”
The moment the water made contact with his tongue was pure bliss, and Tony struggled to pace himself as he began to take harder pulls on the straw. It was so good until his empty stomach started to become too full with nothing but water. He’d already felt queasy from the pain medication they’d apparently been giving him, and this was just adding to it. At least his mouth felt better.
“Come on, Tony,” Steve said as he softly tugged the hand he held, “Let’s get inside. The temperature is dropping, and your hand feels like ice.”
It didn’t make sense to Steve because Tony had always been the most practical of all of them. Tony loved science and technology, not folklore, and Steve hated watching the man’s anxiety eat at him the way it was doing.
It didn’t know why it needed two designations. It was both Bucky and Barnes. It seemed unnecessary. It sat on the metal stool and removed its shirt, ready to comply. The one named Steve had asked that a Bucky not say those words, but it didn’t know why. It still thought them.
Bucky huffed and rubbed his nose against Tony’s. “And you still haven’t pushed me away,” he said almost awestruck.
It didn’t know what was alright. The one named Steve would sometimes ask, but it didn’t know what alright was in correlation to itself. It answered the best it could. “I am functioning, but the arm requires maintenance.”
James entered the kitchen still looking worried. “I’m sorry it didn’t work out, Tony. I know you gotta wanna go home. I wish we could help, but…Where’s your suit?” He asked, just noticing Tony’s new wardrobe. “And what is all that?” He pointed to the box.
Tony shrugged. “He didn’t say much at all, really. You know him. It was mostly ‘Blah, blah, powerful threat, blah, blah, may concern you, I’m too busy to stop so you need to come to me, blah.’ As if I’m not busy?” He asked, affronted.
Even with the shirt only half-way up, Bucky could see a lot of scars. Some were older than others, especially the fine jagged ones that were scattered below his ribs. One was very thick and deep red, peeking out from the middle of his shirt. Bucky had made himself focus only on the cut he was tending to.
“When I found you and brought you here, you had every reason not to care about anyone but yourself, but you still cared about me without knowing why. That’s how good a person you are, love. With all the pain and damage you were dealing with, you still cared about my pain and tried in the only ways you knew how to make it better. Just because I was still hurting doesn’t mean that you failed.”
Steve was looking at him, stunned by the outburst. James was just smiling like Christmas came early, clearly enjoying someone sticking up for Steve.
Smooth olive skin, dark hair and familiar intelligent brown eyes stared out from a young Howard Stark’s face. “Hey doc,” he called as he removed the welder’s mask from his head and moved to set it and the torch in his other hand on the closest worktable. “It’s good you’re here. I’ve almost got the outer frame finished, and I wanted to talk with you again about the amount of energy this thing is going to be channeling.”
“So install separate layers of faraday cages inside the shell of the transformation chamber.” Tony said as if this was obvious. “Aluminum mesh on the outer layer with a finer copper mesh on the inner one. Then you can do the wiring for the inner chamber and all the energy should be contained inside the shell.”
Bucky had then said something very similar to what Steve had. Making Tony sound like some amazing renaissance man, like he was larger than life, and maybe he was. Back in his time. Now, in 1939 he was next to nothing.
Steve and Bucky both laughed softly at the artificial member of their team’s words as the rest of the Avengers, minus Thor, came into the kitchen.
