But he was also secretive. Tony himself was a very reserved person because sure, his life was a favourite for the tabloids to follow, to write about, to photograph, to smear his name and spread rumours of what Tony likes stuck up his butt by strange men, but he himself could be very reserved. Tony didn't trust people. Tony didn't like a lot of people and the people he did, could be counted on his right hand alone.
"-Don't touch
"I'm going to die, I'm going to die! Fuck!"Both Steve and Bucky are turning their attention towards the family room window, just in time to see Clints body fall from the roof and onto the thick pile of snow that lay infront of the large window, scream and all. There's a short second of silence before he's popping up from the pile of snow, covered in white from head to snow and his right ear hearing aid dangling from his ear."Steve! Buck! Get the fuck out here, man."
Tony finishes with the heart monitor, turning it over so that the front is now facing up and Toby can fiddle for it to turn back on again. The screen lights up with green, and inside of that damn blasted beeping sound, a soft chime echos through the room with every beat of Tony's heart.
"How do you even know that's his real name?"
"Okay, Love you Honey Bear. Give my love to Momma Rhodes."Tony kisses down the phone even after Rhodey has said his own goodbyes and has hung up. With a heavy sigh, Tony looks down at his phone, a weight off of his shoulders now that he knows that he won't be alone during this dinner.
"Shut up."The blonde rolls his blue eyes at Tony in fondness."Get some sleep, you look like you need it. And a Happy New Years, Tony."
"I'm sorry, I didn't realise that I changed names? When did I stop being Steve?"Steve now stands up straight, the basket of laundry balancing between his hip and his arm in the most
"I'm not going. Have the dinner without me."
"What the fuck are you doing?"Steve asks in panic, his eyes widening as he watches Tony pull at wires and fiddle with screwdrivers. The heart monitor is there for a reason, still connected to Tony but deemed useless now as it lays on the bed in front of Tony, dismantled into pieces. He's taking off his hat and scarf, shaking it from snow.
"The old cunt wouldn't even come to pick me up but he can arrange fucking press conferences and interviews before I've even left Afghanistan. Fucking typical."Pinching the bridge of his nose with his working hand, sliding deeper into the cool leather seats of the car. He's not even been on American soil for half an hour before the demands have started rolling in.
and the
"Are you okay?"Rhodey is quick to asking whenever Tony's parents are out of earshot of their conversation. Tony shakes off his dreading fear of the evening, looking at Rhodey with a tight fitting smile on his face.
"It actually quoted 'breakfast' but I've never seen you eat anything but cheeseburgers before."There's a cup of coffee passed towards him as he rounds the desk so that they are no standing either side, a small smile etched onto his lips as he takes a sip. Black, two sugars. With the coffee cradled to his chest, Tony is picking up the sheet nearest to him on the desk, eyes skipping that of names and ages and landing on what his interest lies on. He's reading it, scanning his eyes over a couple more times before he looks up with threaded eyebrows of curiosity.
"I regret to inform you, sir, that Doctor Strange is
Anyway, he doesn't want to scare Steve away, in that sense. Tony thinks the teen can stand in front of God himself and not bat an eyelash. But in a way that maybe he's not comfortable with those as open, as easy going when it comes to sexuality and touch that Tony is. Tony doesn't know what Steve is like when it comes to that type of stuff, he's positive that he's straight though, which as much as Tony wouldn't like to admit, is pretty disappointing.
Because as much as Tony loves this city, so magnificent and beautiful and busy as it is, it's hard to get his head showered when you're in such a place that keeps him on his toes for so long, where his head is always constantly wrapped around a problem or situated in someone's lap or buzzed and numbed by various substances. A holiday, if this is what he can call a
get into any sort of trouble before Christmas but here we are, in the same place with you injured and another Christmas photo ruined."Sarah Rogers fumes, trying her best not to flip out and break her sons nose any further as she secures a piece of medical tape over his nose.
The door of his workshop had opened, tucked a number of floors below ground level of Stark Industries New York building with easy access to a private car park through a garage door at the far end of the workshop. Tony had noticed, not really, and it was only when the music had stopped that he lifted his head from the cars engine to look at the assistant who'd entered the workshop, poised and confident but carrying a worrying edge that unnerved Tony because Virginia Potts, the only Stark Industries assistant Tony
, but this is who he is, Tony Stark. I'm not the one that lied to you."
And that's the last thing he remembers.
When Tony reawakens, he's being talked to by an army doctor. He's tall and broad and stony faced but he seems to talk to Tony with at least a sliver of empathy because Tony may have been shaped for war but it wasn't a physical war. It was a war of ability, of business and manipulation and spiralling mental health. A mental, realistic war. He wasn't built for combat, he was only human, after all. A broken, human blessed with a brain that makes him useful to keep around but cursed with a bountiful of bad luck.
"Now you're starting to sound like Bruce."He rolls his eyes, moving his hand so that he's pointing at the clock with his bottle of beer."It's past noon, it means I can drink. Small hand is at 12 and the big hand is at-"
"That's it, get out."Before Tony can even blink there's a hand on his shoulder pulling him out of his seat."You need food, and don't you dare look at me like that because protein shakes are not food, Tony! And a shower, jeez, shower and then a food. Can you even remember what outside looks like? Or what a proper meal is?"
happy when he phoned which meant he had to wait lunge to be picked up, not that he minded.
"Of course. What type of friend would I be if I didn't help you out?"
"Fierce, I like it."
"How many times do I have to tell you to call me Bruce, Tony."It's not even a question because Bruce knows just how excited Tony was when Bruce got his doctorate, leaping and jumping around his workshop like an excited puppy dog and he has made sure to use his title excessively ever since.
Which is never a good thing, to be so caught up in your own thoughts that you get lost within them, a tourist in your own mind where your thoughts are so jumbled up and scrambled that it all but seems to be in a different language. Tony was always one for being alone, he adored the thought of being left to his own devices, but he loathed the idea of being alone with his own thoughts, a dark territory which when revealed, stained him as if ink that could not be removed.
Steve looks on in amazement, holding the backpack in his hands as he stares between the heart monitor that continues to lay on the bed in front of Tony and Tony, the teenager who isn't even aware of Steves amazed eye and continues to eat his Burger. He wasn't even aware that a heart monitors sound could be alerted, or maybe it can't and that's the amazement that Tony is able to form.
"Hey Mom,"Tony says with as much enthusiasm as he can muster at the moment, giving his Mother his best smile whenever she takes quick steps towards her son, heels clicking against the marbled flooring of the hallway.
"What? Chill, Capsicle, I'm not going to die from a little grease and caffeine."Tony smirks, taking a sip from the dark coffee before Steve can protest anymore. He's melting into the pillows in relief, a blissful smile taking over the smirk as he feels the warmth slide down his throat and settle into his system. He's missed coffee so
"Because you'll think differently of me, Steve, and that's the last-
Sarah reaches for the backpack, coming back over to sit in the vacant seat next to Tony's bed, setting the backpack on Tony's lap as the teenager munches on a piece of celery. As much as he hates vegetables, Tony knows that Sarah won't leave until he's ate food. Unzipping the bag, Tony pulls out a couple of photo frames.
Today, however, is a prime example how good natured her son is.
"Good evening, Steve."A doctor nods Steves way whenever he spots the teen walking the halls in boredom as he waits to be picked up. He had disturbed Natasha with a phone call obviously at the wrong time, seeing as she was
"Who cares for my eating habits, really? I think the problem is why are you here on Christmas Day?"Tony changes the subject, picking at a seam on his fluffy pyjama bottoms that were thick and comfy, keeping him warm.
"That's better,"
"Look, I don't know
It wasn't the first time that Tony had been kidnapped, oh no, of course not. It had happened once when Tony was 8 and then again when he was 10. He was young and scrappy and barely hitting puberty, barely knowing what it was like to survive on your own in the outside world, especially when you've lived most of your life inside of bricked buildings and sky scrapping walls. They didn't hurt him, or not intentionally at least, but they did hold onto him for ransom and by the time it took Maria to beg Howard to pay it, Tony was often trapped for weeks.
"Being killed by Natasha's Thighs? Sweet."Bucky smirks, watching the way that Steve rolls his eyes and takes another drink of the alcoholic drink. It was no secret of the on going sex that the two have been sharing for the past year, and it was nothing more than that despite everyone's poking and prodding. Steve thinks otherwise, but whatever.
There was just something within Steve that made him unable not to get up and approach Tony, making him quiver like a frightened deer in headlights when he was trying to be professional and do his job. It was stupid. Steve was being stupid. What else did he expect? For Tony to be all grins and wide arms, welcoming Steve with the same kiss under the chin as he had all those years ago when they were teenagers and Tony had been seeking affection and Steve was seeking someone to give affection to.
. He should be happy that he's going home, that she going to see his Mom, to sleep in his own bed, his own room, his own home. He should be happy that he's going to eat food cooked by highly paid chefs and be catered by housekeeping that are hired to wipe his ass for him if need be. But he isn't.
Not like he cares what Howard thinks of him. He's been hearing the words that he's useless, scum of the earth, a slur just waiting to be bent over since the moment he came out. He doesn't care. What his Mother thinks of him, is a different matter. Tony loves his Mom, because she might not be Mother of the Year but she loves him, and that's all Tony ever wants.
or an explanation to spill out of his mouth, but
Because Maria hadn't been perfect, and yet nobody really is, but there was a love there that had been shown through touches and glances, of involvement and defensive actions, of times where she had ushered Tony out of the room before a breaking of a glass on the wall, or hinted a warning of a presence coming down for dinner, or the ghostly brush to a warm cheek that Tony felt he had dreamt in the middle of the night when he was still just a babe.
"Until I get sick of hearing the title
"Hey,"Steve offers a smile, glad to see that Tony is up and about unlike last time. He had been complaining nonstop about the dreadful bedrest that his doctor had put him on after news had spread of his fixing up the hospital room."You're looking a lot healthier."
It could've been worse
"I don't have a lawyer."
"Tony, it was my job."
Steve hates it when Bucky is right
"Take it, please. You bought me a cheeseburger, and holy fucking shit that was a great cheeseburger and I thank you gratefully for it, so it's my turn to buy you coffee, or tea, or anything you want. Actually Y'know what? Take my wallet, buy a car."Tony panics, motioning for Steve to take the entire leather wallet out of his hands.
"You don't. You and I both know that."Rhodey sighs, shaking his head whenever Tony huffs and moves to turn away, but he's being grabbed around the shoulders and yanked against a chest instead. He tenses, if only for a second or two, before his arms are around Rhodey and his hands are gripping the back of his t-shirt, pressed to his shoulder, eyes closed tight.
"I use to take you here,"Her voice hasn't changed, it's still soft and British and holds a higher regard of authority but gentleness that Tony has never been able to get his head around. It never has changed because she always spoke to Tony in the same way that she spoke to Jarvis, or Anna, or Maria, but never the same way with Howard. No, because with Howard, Peggy always spoke as if she had the higher ground, in such a way, over him, as if she knew things about Howard that no other did, and maybe, she had and maybe she still does, but that information would be useless now, Tony thinks.
DUMM-E was lucky enough still back at MIT when the explosion happened, seeing as Tony was more or less at MIT for most of the year the 'bot stayed there unless it was the summer holidays. As much as the 'bot wrecks everything and makes Tony's life hell at times, he wouldn't know what to do without his favourite 'bot.
"Tony, if you want this friendship to continue he's going to know sometime or another, whether that be by seeing your face popped up on some tabloid after tonight's event or from you yourself."He can practically hear the tiredness in Rhodeys voice.
His memory does not stretch further than pulling up to Stark House in Malibu, California with Rhodey in the passenger seat and cases of beer and spirits in the back seat of the luxurious sports car. They had planned to spend the weekend confined to the Malibu house and Tony suspects that he played by that rule, just not in the way that Rhodey approved because as much as Tony promised the weekend to just be the two of them, he has a big mouth and word gets around rather fast.
"What's wrong?"Tony says over a mouthful of food, looking over at Steve with wide eyes. He has his cheeseburger in one hand and a screw driver in the other, starting to close up the heart monitor.
"I used your shampoo, I hope you don't mind."Tony decides to tell Steve, maybe hoping to get a reaction that Tony can deem good enough out of him, only to receive a snort from James instead.
"You want a drink? Let me buy you one, I think I owe you one from, what, a couple of years back, I'm sure. It hasn't been
"I wasn't sure what coffee you liked, so I got a normal coffee and a black coffee? I wasn't sure, there were no other options or I would've gotten you a latte or a capatino or a mocha. I have sugar and milk pods as well,"Steve informs whenever he enters the room again, shutting the door with the heel of his foot with his hands full.
"Doctor Banner, long time no see."Tony salutes to the screen as soon as a friendly face has greeted him, fingers dancing across various projections that float around his workshop. He's an expert at multitasking even if Pepper says that once he gets sucked into something, it's as if he develops tunnel vision. He needs an extra set of eyes on these blueprints, however, and Doctor Banner seems like a good place to start.
mean that he is good with people. There's a reason why Tony has shaved down the number of people that he interacts with on a daily basis to 3 people ( and even at that, apparently Butterfingers doesn't even count as people because
?"Steve wants an answer and it's not exactly like he's mad, or maybe he is a little, because he's barely heard a word from Tony for an entire week since he left his home in Brooklyn, and now all of sudden he calls him up in the middle of the night, looking like - in the words of Tony - shit and wanting
There's a sigh that leaves his lips as he straightens his spine, rolls back his shoulders and braces himself for turning to look at Steve. He's gotten bigger. Bigger in the shoulders, in the chest, in height, in mass. He's bigger and taller and stronger. His features have hardened in certain ways t do with age but also to do with war, and his brow has creased. But his eyes, his lips, his baby fine blonde hair, the underside of his jaw where Tony use to lay sweet kisses of Hellos and Goodbyes; they remain the same.
"Oh come off it, Stevie, I know you're smarter than to be sweet on
"Fuck off, buck."Steve nudges harshly at the dark brunette, watching as Bruce and Tony get fully into their conversation, almost pushing Phil off of the sofa as Tony slides into a seat and Bruce sits on the arm rest.
"Make me."Clint childishly sticks out his tongue at the red head who gives the blonde in the back seat
'Tony, Tony, Tony. M'boy, Howard is not going to be pleased."
"Always negative, Tony, why so always negative?"
"If you can't make it to your doctors appointments, I don't think you'd be committed to a gym."He nearly sings, sounding smug and looking it as he types out some notes on his StarkTab before turning his attention back to James.
"Manhattan, wasn't it? Banquet Dinner to help starving children, if I do recall."He goes on, taking a closer step to Tony who continues to stand tall, shoulders rolled back and chest puffed out in a way that makes the glow of his reactor stand further out, the metal rim sticking out through the expensive material of his shirt. Tiberius glances at it, for not even a second, but Tony has gotten so use to people dipping a look at his abnormality that he caught the millisecond glance. "Scotch on the rocks, yeah?"
"Have you seen this? Of course you haven't because while you've been
"What does it matter, I'm working on it."Which he is, or will be, it depends on how you look at this progress track record on how long it takes for him to actually get into action. What blueprints that he does have to create his new arc reactor are far from being finished, and until he does finish those blue prints at least, as well as research and scavenging for equipment and material, all projects will be put on hold.
"Bruce."Natasha adds, honking the horn whenever a driver over takes her and sweating out the window at the driver.
"Bucky doesn't hate you! He's just..."
Tony's head pulses harshly against his temples, an ache that Tony has grown accustom to over the last year or so of being involved in the party scene, fairly new to the party scene but very knowledgeable about the alcohol. His body aches, a dull type of ache that settles into his bones, down the muscle of his legs, a swirling nausea at the top of his stomach and sharp pain in his neck from where his body is angled in an awkward position on the hard, fine wooden floors of Stark House, Malibu, California.
It's a long drive, and Tony makes sure that he's pilled the back seats with food and drink because if there's one thing that his parents have taught him, it's that he can't show up to somebodies house empty handed - and he takes that to his grave, whether the gift to the house is a candle, food or cocaine.
"A peck, nothing more, I just- I just want to test out a theory."And as the words tumble out of Tony's mouth, their lips meet in a kiss that Steve has initiated but one that Tony has met him half way for. There's no movie moment of sparks and fireworks, but there's a warm, bubbling feeling of anxiety, of fear or of some other adjoining emotion that comes with feelings and crushes and sweet on's of the like.
"Well I'd love to see your drawings some time."
Tony is never more glad to have Rhodey along side of him during their mingling, mostly because the attention was often moved off of the Arc Reactor whenever brought up, thanks to Rhodey being able to stir the conversation a different direction. And of course, not all of their interactions were overly bad or boring which also helped the entire situation.
"MIT? How old is the kid again?"
There's a hoodie laying on his bedroom floor, a pale blue and softened with age and laundry detergent, one that Tony recognises only for its odd appearance in his bedroom of oil greased tanks and dirty work boots. It sticks out like a sore thumb, from his colour, it's touch, it's smell as he brings it up to his nose; of how laundry smells on a windy day, of freshly cut grass and cheap, old cologne that makes Tony want to bury his nose in the scent that rests at the base of Steve's neck.
to me."He scolds, watching how Clint glares at him from where he fell backwards onto the sofa, his legs draped over the arm and a hand cradling his left hearing aid, ready to pull it out and prove a ridiculous point. He stops in his actions, watching Steve with a scowl."We are not 'conspiring' against you or being discriminatory and for the record, blind people need dogs so that they can do things that they cannot because of their lack of vision, they are not pets. I'm honestly not even sure how you ended up to that point, to be honest."
"No."Jarvis answers and it's hesitant as if unsure if he should be testing the limits of Tony today before he continues unashamed."However, I do urge that you contact Doctor Strange as he is requesting your assistance, quote 'When you are available to chat' unquote, something in which you are."
"Exactly,"Tony chimes, falling into the singular bucket chair with his legs draped over the arm rest, glasses pushed up onto his forehead and hair."You gotta have the balls to ask me out on a date, not just assume."
, as you so call it, existed until I told you both about it. Being a doctor and a prosthetist is not my only profession, it's a side gig and it's one that I take extremely seriously, but I also run a company which I have to promote and maintain. I am being extremely generous with what I am doing for Mr Barnes and if I were you, I would be careful of what you demand and ask from me, Steve."
to change whenever he takes over.
"It's complicated."Tony comments, eyes still following as Steve walls down the hallway, watching the way that his shoulders are tensed and slumped and it seems so unlike the Steve that Tony knew.
"Which in your term means impossible because you're such a negative nelly."
"Wait, why?"Steve sits up straighter, a frown on his face.
me. You have something to tell me, or something to yell at me, and it's eating you up inside but instead you're trying to butter me up with
"Way to sound force, Stark."Tony grumbles bitterly, scowling at his Mobile phone in anger, hoping that somehow a mobile tower will fall over and his message is unable to be sent.
But Tony can't do that, drop this case and take off because he has been working and dreaming and hoping for this for so long. Barnes is the perfect candidate, from location to tissue to nerve to blood type. He's perfect. And Tony and Stephen have been eating and wishing and working on this for too long for Tony's overly complicated personal life to get in the way.
The diner, in which Tony only realises that Peggy had picked for its nostalgia feels that come haunting back at Tony, is more than busy for a Wednesday afternoon, the wind howling through the busted door, snow melting on the pavement and being kicked as slush by passing kids. Tony hates it here, not only because Peggy picked it, but because it's in New York, a city that Tony is growing to hate the more he spends time in.
This wasn't how Steve intended on spending the start of his Christmas break, he has planned on going home after the bus dropped him off near the supermarket close to his home and get changed into a fresh pair of clothes and then head out with his group, but of course that didn't happen.
his father which she was glad of.
"Okay lets not compare Clint to
"Hey,"Tiberius' hand is suddenly around Tony's wrist the moment that he turns away for the bar, half a step away from the body that had purposely banged into him to gain his undivided attention."Don't you want to talk to me?"
Which, Tony has also figured out means months with Strange, months of late nights and early mornings, months of spilled coffees and shaking hands, months of hunched over paperwork, specs, designs, planning. And Tony isn't exactly sure how he feels about that and the bad thing is, Tony isn't sure if it's the idea of months spent on the same project or spending all of those months with Strange.
"Thank you,"Tony smiles finally, a smile that is so little and Steve would have missed it if it wasn't for the fact that he was
?"Tony has turned, eyebrow raised and a slight smirk gracing his lips as he had looked at Stephen. Things between them were still new, Doctor Strange was still new and Tony was just still exploring this new and dangerous territory. Doctor Strange goes to open his mouth, to make a comment but Tony beats him to it. "I'll bring the brains, you bring the coffee. 8 a.m."
"What? Oh fuck, I forgot all about that."There's a momentarily moment of panic that flashes through Tony as he sorts through the mental notes and dates in his head, trying to figure out when he's next free. JARVIS will know, of course, but he doesn't want to look too reliant on his technology. "Right, uh, I'll only be gone for 3 days. It's a flying visit, really, so I can bring you back in in 27 days time."
"People just love to talk."
It's a weird conversion starter but he guesses he can go with the flow. Tony has been stuck in worse and weirder conversations before and this is by far the best on that list.
"Get in the car, Tony."The soft demeanour as seemed to faded momentarily from Rhodeys tone of voice and isn't Tony so happy for that? Because he'd rather be barked at and chastised than sweet talked and whispered to like a broken doll. Tony shrugs off the help that Rhodey and Pepper reach out to do and gets into the car with only a few hisses of pain. Pepper slides into the seat beside him and Rhodey climbs up front with Happy.
"I'm cautious."Is how he had replied, meeting her stare with one of his smiles, the sort of smile he resells for when he knows that he's being annoying and showing off. His eyes masked with the shaded glass of his sunglasses, nursing a hangover from the night before and still on the road to recovery from awaking early to gather the mountain of files. He knew Pepper preferred her notes on paper, old fashioned like Obie, who would still prefer to be told directly the information rather than a sticky note stuck to the door of his office.
But they do, the changes matter a lot because even if it's just mer objects, articles of clothing in new wardrobes or ornaments in a garden that was once cobbled with stone but was now layered with green grass, it meant that he people around you had changed too. And more so, it was Steve that had changed the most from his experiences in Afghanistan, even if he didn't know it truly himself.
"This is sounding a lot like a date, Rogers."Tony giggles, waggling his eyebrows at the teenager that stands before him. A date with Steve isn't something that Tony would deny upon, mostly because Steve is a gentleman of a guy, handsome in all his might and willing to go to lengths to make Tony smile-
On his own, James had looked far more smaller than Tony had ever remembered him to be and maybe it's in the face, how his cheeks have sunken and his eyes have darkened or how his shoulders have slumped under a jacket that looks far too heavy and large for his frame to hold. Or how his skin has gotten that waxy sort of texture that only ill or victims of trauma seem to develop, after a war or a car accident or a mistake.
. There are so many times that Tony wishes she had been there, situations she should've been there for, ones where Peggy would've kicked down a door when he was 5 and crying, screaming in pain from a broken arm by a drunken Howard. Times when it happened when he was 11, the summer after the vacation with Peggy, where Howard has broken his shoulder. Or when he was 15 and kicked in the ribs.
"Steve, Calm down."Tony near enough hisses, cheeks pink in embarrassment as heads start to turn and voices start to whisper about the commotion that Steve is starting.
. Heir to Stark Industries. Criminal Record. Photos. Videos. Men. Woman. Partying. Alcohol. Drugs. Genius. Pentagon. Criminal Record. World records. Smartest mind of the century.
"Holy shit, I think Bruce found his soulmate."Bucky whispers from the otherside of the room, watching how Tony snatches up a pen and napkin that had been sitting on the coffee table and starts to doodle on the napkin as he talks to Bruce."Tough shit on you getting in his pants, Stevie."
"Don't play this game because honestly, you're not very good at it Steve."Steve flushes at her tone of voice, suddenly feeling very embarrassed that he even tried to take on Natasha and her knowledge, knowing very well that he is the one in the wrong."You can't stand in the way between Bucky and his future, Steve, no matter what history you have with Tony. It's being selfish."
Everyone on campus has probably been given the talk by now, or at least know not to mess with Tony Stark unless they want the wrath of James Rhodes on their ass. But, it doesn't stop Tony from doing his thing because Tony is selfish, he's foolish and he really doesn't deserve somebody as magnificent as Rhodey.
Steve heard of Tony, but he never spoke of him because he had bigger problems to deal with, and that bigger problem just so happened to be Bucky and his accident, so much more vital and important than Steve and his own.
? Tony is begging in his head, just wanting to roll over and pull the covers over his head and catch a couple of more hours of sleep. Unlike a majority of teenagers - other than those that suffered from insomnia or other sleeping problems like that - Tony didn't waste his weekends away from sleeping, and he often found sleeping as a luxury, something he had to earn the right to do."Tony, Can you hear me?"
Hey sorry it’s been awhile! I love the love and support that everyone gives me so thank you very much!
"Even better!"Clint is taking a last swing of the beer left in the bottle before setting it on the marble counter, shoving Steve playfully in the shoulder as he passes to get to the front door. "C'mon, man, we need to find a baker who will bake a severed arm cake in under 6 hours!"
( Which more or less means that he'll give the 'bot a wrench or a screwdriver and make him feel useful for an hour or two around the workshop. )
"You told Tony to leave all those years ago and leave he did, but since then you have made it noticeable to everyone that you enjoy the act of wallowing in your own self pity and I, for one, have had enough of it, Steve."Steve's eyes widen, watching how she doesn't move her eyes off of Steve as she speaks,"It's been 10 years, Steve."
And it's tempting because every fibre of Tony's body is just vibrating to go out on the town, to drink until he's numb and can't even remember his name but can remember his credit card number. He wants to embrace the flashing lights, absorb the shitty music and just let the night take him, to be pulled onto Tiberius Stones lap and let him pet at his thigh as he gets drugged up, gets fucked up all for the amusement of everyone else.
"No, shit, I didn't mean to stare, I'm sorry. Did I make you uncomfortable? I-I've just never seen anything like that before and it's really fascinating a-and different, but in a good way, I hope because maybe it's not a good thing for it to be glowing-"
"You just get busy swimming in all those circles."To Tony's surprise, Barnes let's out a surprised chortle and it seems to surprise Barnes too by the look on his face, eyes wide in shock and seeming to jerk to one side to cover his laugh, almost forgetting about the missing limb that stops him from doing so.
"What?"
because god knows he doesn't need anymore attention.
——————
"Stark."
So Tony invited Bruce to a Charity Fundraiser, one that he wouldn't be able to refuse.
It's not that Steve fears of regretting his decision, it's more that Steve fears of what he'll miss out, which is a lot worse in his head, anyway. Steve, as much as it sounds shallow and self-important, has always been the centre of their group. He's always been the one to make decisions, sway them out of trouble or take the brunt of the trouble instead. They always hang out at his house, in his garden, around his schedule of school, extracurricular activities, volunteering, visiting Tony in the times that he did.
"You had a cancellation so we brought him forward. As well that, it means you have a free evening, or that's what Ms Potts has told me."Dr Strange tucks the device away, watching as Tony narrows his eyes suspiciously at the doctor before shrugging a shoulder, humming in amusement.
, because he had been keeping a close eye on Bruce for awhile, and maybe it's because Tony had become infatuated with Bruce and his beautiful mind, or maybe because he was overly concerned about the man, but he was never far out of Tony's mind. While Bruce had become star-struck to have been talking to the Tony Stark in Steve's living room that night, talking about mechanics, of science, of unanswered questions, new alloys and metals and inventions that they were both working on; Tony was equally as struck with awe.
"The whole Tony
do something like that! You know that!"
Somewhere, deep down inside of Tony believes that this will be a good morning, and maybe it's because he has seemed to wake up on his own accord, without finding himself tangled in damp, sweated bedsheets and with his heart in his mouth, words choked in his mouth and eyes glossy and wide. It's also a good start to know, that for once, he's woken up without a hangover, maybe a tinge in the back of his head, a day to wear his yellow specs and not the blackouts, and he has somehow made it into his own bed. That's always a good start too.
I’m so sorry for not updating! I’ve had a busy 2019 but I come with a DOUBLE UPDATE. I’m so sorry but have fun, enjoy and remember to comment (:
But Rhodey was always easily manipulated when it comes to Tony Stark, and there it began their calendar countdown to Spring Break. Tony hadn't forgotten, checking his calendar as often as he could remember to do so until the weekend came and soon enough, Tony was throwing a suitcase or two into the trunk of the same car and set out for Malibu with his best friend in the passenger seat and Metallica blasting, desperate to enjoy the weekend.
"I never knew I signed up to have a baby, now get in the shower before I force you into the shower. We need to talk."And that short sentence of
"Because it was on his goddamn medical bracelet, you idiot!"And his medical sheets, and at the foot of his bed in block letters on a clip board that had read
"I hope you don't mind me asking, but your arc reactor..."
"300 is a little downgrading, 400 at the least."
that Rhodey would never hurt him, but it's the shock of the tension, the anger, the frustration, the way that Rhodey looks at him with clouded eyes and with a tensed body.
"Tony?"Rhodey's voice calls loudly, causing Obi to flinch away and for Tony to say against the wall in relief that he had been stopped before anything further could happen. There's a curl of fear inside of Tony's stomach at the thought of being
"Steve, he-"
Maybe it was because he was the youngest on campus, that he just wanted to fit with the first crowd of people that seemed to take an interest in him, but whatever it was Tony's trouble - as Rhodey continued to call it - had landed him him in a ditch; face first, ass up. It was a whirlwind of Alcohol that made his body all numb, Drugs that helped ease the pain in his head and sex; fuck was the sex amazing.
He could've been dead
"The coffee is fucking terrible."He breaks the silence very suddenly, removing his hands from his face, tears dried onto cheeks, eyes puffy and red, but at the moment he doesn't care as Peggy looks up, a little shocked at the transition but slowly melts.
"I know that,"She treads carefully, sparing a glance at Steve who sorts of slouches in the passenger seat, not really looking at her but not exactly looking at anything outside either. "But you can see where I'm coming from, yeah? Stark Industries have been around the rumour mill countless times, Steve, and not for good reason."
And each and every kid has drawn him a picture. And they all live on Tony's office door.
It was the slightest of things, the smallest of things, the
"That's not a good experience for Phil."Bruce smirks, following into the Barnes household with a missing hat and a nursing bruising cheek from the mistake of Thor throwing a ball of ice instead of a ball of snow. His rectangular Glasses were cracked and broken, laying in his pocket."Poor Phils dick."
"This wasn't my fault."He whispers, lips barely moving, tongue heavy and numb. His eyes keep flickering to the photographs attached to the tabloid article, with Tony draped over a lap of a man that he doesn't recognise, his hands curled in a blondes hair, his back pressed against a chest of one Tiberius Stone with an outward look of pure bliss on his face but his eye so far away and empty.
But maybe that’s Steve overthinking things, analysing it too much.
"What day is it?"
"I mean, it is 3am. Maybe he's lucky enough to be fucking
And it made Tony's skin itch, as if there were thousands of little ants crawling under his skin that he just couldn't get at, that his skin was getting tighter, constricting him from moving, from being himself, because he didn't feel like himself with all of this generosity. It just wasn't
"If you don't want to talk, that's fine. We can just sit here until the sun rises, or until the sun sets, and remain here, with you, for you if that's what you need. We don't need to talk."His voice is so soft, just like his skin, just like his hands, and his lips move so perfectly around each word and syllable that Tony's eyes are drawn to them.
Sighing, Tony is unbuttoning the buttons of shirt and pulling up the blackout vest that he created below it, exposing the Arc Reactor in all its glory to James who seems to gawk on the seat in front of him, hardened, ugly scars and all. Rolling his eyes, Tony is fixing himself up.
There's a silence that passes between the two friends, one that Steve knows is due to Bucky falling asleep beside him, evident from the soft snores that leaves his friend and the way the teen as shuffled closer so they can share body heat. It gives Steve to think, mostly about Christmas which is normally a big affair between the group of friends and one that Steve normally finds himself spending with the Barnes due to his mum taking the Christmas shift.
It could be worst, it could be a lot worse and there could be a figure sitting beside the bed, haven been seated in an uncomfortable plastic chair for hours and hours, more nervous than the one in the bed with a missing arm up to the shoulder, more worried and feared, with baby fine blonde hair and sparkling blue eyes that always look up in such earnest and honesty and loveliness that Tony sees when he closes his eyes, when he's wrapped up in warm duvets on cold winter nights and wants them to be the arms that had held him that early morning in a diner booth.
"4 Dollars for a carton of milk?!"Steve shouts, even making Tony flinch and jump."Why don't I just a buy a whole cow and milk it myself!"What kind of planet charges a carton of milk 4 dollars? A planet that Steve really doesn't want to be a part of right now because that's just outrageous.
"Not today."Bucky shakes his head, resting his head back onto the pillow with a sigh. Steve closes his eyes, just wanting to sleep away the headache that is slowly starting to form and the pain in his rids and around his face. He doesn't regret being a good guy, but it doesn't alway have its perks when you're lying on your bed in pain.
"Uh, yeah. I'll ask him."Dipping the bread into the whisked eggs, Steve places them into the headed up pan.
?"Steve is asking, still sweeping dirty clothes into the washing basket. Now that he looks, Steve is pretty sure that not all of the clothes in the washing basket is his because last time Steve checked, he didn't own black leggings or red cycling shorts.
"How's your folks taking this?"
"Hey, you alr-"Tony pauses, following Steves wondering eye and realising that he is looking at the covered up Arc Reactor."
. Rhodey is a friend by default, my best friend, he got stuck with me for a roommate and let me tell you, it's no walk in the park."
"No, you're not wrong, because you never fucking are, but don't use that as an excuse."He turns away, pacing again. Tony stands by the window, fogged with condensation, and it's dramatic of him to act this way, and he knows it, and he knows that he has no right to because Rhodey had decided to join the Air Force long before he had met Tony.
"You settled this agreement, Tony, not I. You came to me and
"Well I hope it is,"She sighs, shaking her head at the teenager that stands before him, looking a lot healthier than what he was just weeks ago. It's always been a hard position as a nurse, to see children and teenagers alike be rushed into emergency, especially with having a teenager herself sitting at home.
Collins Carbonell). Suggested keywords; Criminal Record.
"You're making the right decision, Mr. Barnes."Tony's smile is still tight, despite the fact  that his body has seemed to relax without the heavy stare of Steve's boring eyes on his shoulders. His cheeks have numbed with that familiar stretch of a smile far too large, a smile he usually reserves for nosey journalists and talk show hosts that put their hand too far up his thigh. He catches himself on, wiping the smile off of his face with a cough into a closed fist."I'll have a colleague of mine, Dr. Stephen Strange, come and outline what is about happen next. Of course, we won't be jumping into things straight away, we will have to run a couple of assessments and hold some very lengthy discussions with your lawyer and our legal team-"
"Then give it to charity, put it away to help your son through college."Tony shrugs, turning his head whenever a car begins to emerge into the private underground carpark. He looks back at Sarah, looking at the cash she continues to hold out, desperately wanting Tony to take before he looks back at her and smiles."That's my ride."
, but he doesn't because the thought of stepping into the bathtub and not coming back out is all too tempting, so instead he grabs for a cloth and some soap and makes work with a post-sex wash that is usually followed by dragging soiled jeans up wobbly legs and stumbling to his 8am at 11am instead.
But she has changed in other ways because the last time Tony had seen her was a decade ago and a decade is a lot of room for changes even if you try and hide them with hats and concealer and a different ring on her ring finger than the one Tony knows that was there before. She's still beautiful, however, because always has been in such a way that reminds Tony of Maria, of how both women were so effortlessly beautiful, so effortlessly pretty in their own ways.

"I know intelligence when I see it, Tony."And it's then that Tony's stomach sinks at the realisation that Bruce
"Clint, you're not even completely deaf- stop taking out your hearing aids and
"Tony,"Tony smiles just a little, not looking bothered or alerted about the blue light in his chest. If he is being honest, Tony sometimes forgets about his new addition and carries on as if it wasn't there to start off with. It wasn't as if Tony was on bed rest, he was actually encouraged to get out of bed and take walks down the corridor and back, but of course, standing on a chair to fix a television was a little too extreme for his condition.
And he does.

"Tony,"Steve approaches the table with care, face tinted pink from the run and nose numb from the sharp, icy wind. His hair and swept in all sorts of directions, blue eyes open and caring and
"The milkshakes spilt all over my bag."Steve grimaces, pulling out his hand and shamelessly wiping his hand over the front of his backpack.
"I might've,"Tony gives him a coy smile as he follows after Steve towards the kitchen to set the bags on the counter for later."People tell me that I have a tendency of going a little overboard when it comes to buying people gifts. And I couldn't come to your house without a gift, so there's that too."
Steve nods, turning and eyeing the chilled shelves of milk. He didn't know that there was so many types of milk to choose front, low in fat, full fat, goats milk, almond milk, coconut milk and the lost went on. Steve just takes a lucky dip and reaches for one, checking the price and nearly having a god damn heart attack in the middle of the dairy section.

"The Back-Up Plan."
"16. He's a fucking genius, Buck. You have no idea how incredibly intelligent he is."Steve swoons, cracking eggs into the mixing bowl and throwing the shells into the bin."The last time I was up, I was helping him pack, and he was showing me these blueprints for this new Arc Reactor that he was designing and of course I have no idea what he was talking about when he went into detail but it's so

Starvation. Dehydration. Broken shoulder. Broken wrist. Bruised hip. Internal bleeding. Strongly recommends to take a vacation from work, no operating heavy machinery, no drinking, no drugs, accept for these drugs; these will make you sleepy, the other will keep you up, this one will dull the pain, this one will take you to far off places. Tony's heard it before, he knows the drill, it doesn't mean he'll do as he's told.
Tony is pulling into the empty slot in Steve's driveway, up beside a beat up silver hyundai that's missing it's left side wing mirror. Suddenly, Tony feels incredibly out of place with driving Howard's beautiful red sports car in a neighbourhood like this. He's basically screaming that he's not more money than enough.
"There are also better ways."Thor says from his place on the ground, trying to connect the PlayStation to Steve's television which always seems like a difficult situation even though it's something that happens at least three times a month.
"I-"Tony can't breathe, a restriction on his airways, a heavy weight upon his chest tats keeping him weighed down to the floor of the ocean, keeping him there, drowning him in the thick mass of dark sea as his heart hammers harder in his chest, louder in his ears."I'm Tony."
"A friend? Is everyone okay? James? Clint?"She asks worriedly, stopping for a second just to show her worry for her sons friends. Both James and Clint were already getting into somesort of trouble, ending up just as bashed and bruised as her son who looks a bit better than what he did two days ago. The bruising around his face was fading and the stitches slowly but surely healing, the only thing was his broken nose that would heal soon enough.
are the one that came interfering in my life, Steve.
But he's a friend, his best friend, and so Rhodey holds him just as tight and stands with him until their legs are numb and the tears have dried and Tony pulls away with dried tear stains on his cheeks and his eyes are red, but neither of them say anything of it. And Tony clears his throat, turns away slightly but not really moving away.
Rhodey.
It's not like Tony doesn't like people - because yes, he's a teenager and no, lets not refer to the common belief that all teenagers hate
“Damn Thor, way to make a guy blush.”Tony is scarlet at the comment, brown eyes wide but there’s an adorable grin on his face that makes Steve’s heart do a double beat and his stomach do these sort of flips and flops in adoration at the sight.”You’re not too bad yourself. Gonna make someone very happy one day.”
"Anyone with a recorder and the desire to get a promotion, Stark."
"I-No, y'know what, I'm not starting this again."Steve shakes his head, getting up from the seat at his desk so that he can dump the remains of his herbal tea down the sink and rinse its cup, eyeing Clint and the bottle of beer as he does so. "Isn't it sort of early to be celebrating."
For the years that Tony and Rhodey have been friends it wasn't usual for Tony to be the one inviting Rhodey over to his home in Rhode Island, because yeah they stayed in the London apartment when they visited London over the summer and one of the Winter cabins in Canada last winter, but it was always just them too, in a house that defiantly didn't feel like a home. Rhodey hadn't questioned it, he knew of how bad of a relationship Tony had with his parents - or at least knew
He takes a gulp, liking his lips in an action that Steve shouldn't find attractive but he does. Tony is already whirling around to where his stuff lay out on top of the drawers and of his hospital bed, setting his cup onto the bedside table as he goes to attempt to take the suitcase out from under the bed, something Steve puts a stop to immediately.
"Jarvis will know of you, I'll introduce you to him. I've told him all about you."Tony smiles to himself in a fond way, remembering the way he had excitedly rang Jarvis and his Aunt Peggy about the news or actually gaining is first friend. He has sounded so much like a child, and to think, he was only 15 so that was being a child.
?"Tony laughs darkly, shaking off Maria's touch and taking steps away from her. The house has obviously been fixed as best as it can despite the short time, but it has been fixed up and you wouldn't even know that there was a problem to begin with."I'm the one with the fucking hole in my chest and
"I said enough, Buck. Drop it."It's anger that seeps through Steve's voice now, tearing his eyes from the screen to look at Buck, blue eyes swirling with anger, frustration, hurt, betrayal. It's dull, the ache that forms in his chest, numbing his limbs, his body, his head as he replays the photos and videos and articles in his mind of Tony.
"Sir, I regret to inform you that Code Name
"Someone come and fix the television?"Tony's favourite nurse asks, raising her eyebrow at a chilled back Tony who wasn't even paying attention to whatever movie that was playing on the hospital television, and instead looking through some type of blueprints. Tony fixes the glasses on his nose that were gradually falling, looking over at the nurse.
Tony doesn't look up because he can't bare to look at her face, to look her in the eyes that seem to have stayed young as the rest of her has grown older, wiser, self aware. He shifts the spilt grains of sugar on the table into a line, scoffing at its symbolism, of how familiar it looks to the bender he has just crawled himself out of, wiping away the sugar, looking up from the table to out the window instead.
And it had felt so good to be talking to someone who thought the same way as you did. It had felt even better to be able to talk about inventions, ideas, plans, dreams that you never thought you'd be able to do and for Bruce to tell you how you could do it. He made everything that Tony thought was impossible,
"As you say, Sir."And this time, Tony does glare at the ceiling because the point of having technology that he built is to make sure they continue to inflate his ego,
"I don't want anything to do with you."Tony forcefully yanks his wrist out of the strong grasp, it coming to rest back at his side while the other twirls the crystal tumblr that had once held whiskey and what Tony wishes still did. Too many familiar faces have made themselves known to Tony today, out of all days, and Tony would rather not have Tiberius Stone trying to slide his way into his pants as well.
"You will not believe the day I've just had!"His apartment door is shoved open and closed with a bang, causing Steve to jump in his seat, breaking out in a cold sweat at the unexpected noise and the person who makes it. Clint Barton is sauntering in with a face of thunder, looking around momentarily to see who else is in the apartment before continuing."So first- listen to this, Steve, it's actually
"Your ma' is texting mine and she's texting me, you've ruined the Christmas photo that she was gonna send to your gran."He informs. He finally locks his phone, prompting himself up on one elbow to look at the damage to Steve."Well, you do look like shit."
"You know exactly where I went, Mr.Barnes. Away."His body is angled to the curtain as he forces himself to look at Bucky, whose heavy jacket remains draped over his shoulders in an attempt to hide the deformity and Tony's fingers seem to have wondered to the Arc Reactor in his chest in that moment, a reminder of his own deformity. "'Just like what everyone wanted."
"No, you did Steve."It's the first time he's said his name in an awfully long time and it almost had Tony freezing all over, in an icy chill so suffocating and numbing that it has Tony struggling to breathe because his name,
Flopping onto the sofa, Steve pants for air, his face tinted red from sweat and the icy wind that had blown into his face for the good part of an hour, nose button red and ears numb. Bucky doesn't say anything and neither does Steve, for a while, and so he sits and pants for air while Bucky sits and munches on chips that he had defiantly stolen out of Steve's cupboard until the blond finally speaks.
And if he's being honest, Steve loves it. He loves how close that their tight-knitted group of rejects are, he loves that everything just seems to natural and normal and unquestionable since the years that they've joined in the group, one by one. Steve is just as bad, he's not so much touch-attention-seeker but when you've grown up surrounded by family and friends that constant have the need to touch, you suddenly get use to it in a way that it's weird when you don't get it.
Tony's nerves immediately calm down with that statement that Steve is obviously not homophobic if two of his best friends are dating.
"We'll talk about this tomorrow, I'll sign you out."She still has the remainder of her shift to complete, unlucky for her, she has the graveyard shift but it was overtime pay which means double the money than a regular shift."Do you need money for a bus or can one of your friends pick you up?"
"Alright, we're coming."Bucky and Steve say in unison, already heading out the front door, ready to fight until frostbite takes over their body.
, especially when Steve remembers how adamant Tony was to peruse his degree in Electrical Engineering.
"Yeah, I know, but teenagers are so ill-mannered and basic. You find one person that likes punk rock and then there's like a thousand more and they all claim to be a certains bands number one fan."
"I mean, technically yes, that isn't my dilemma, that was a ploy actually."Tony waves the screen off, pushing another one to Bruce's view. It's virtually the same profile that Tony had been given the previous morning but Tony had gratefully updated the details, added in the
Bucky' face lights up in shock as he finds the most recent saved photograph of Tony, sent by Tony himself with a cocky caption. It a photograph still taken in hospital with Tony pulling what Bucky can only describe as a bored face, lips pouted out and glasses balanced on the bridge of his nose. His hair is a messy nest of curls, uncaring of his presentation, soft brown eyes hidden behind the glass of his glasses.
"You're really doing this, yeah?"Under all of her stature and strong facade, holding herself up high and strong and independent, Steve can hear that slight tremble of fear in her voice as the words deep through her lips. He doesn't need to turn from where he is at the doorway, already in half a mind to turn back around and forget his intentions, to know there's a look of anguish and a motherly fear breaking through the mask she usually wears on her face.
Tony Stark,
Even at a young age Obadiah had managed to make Tony chill to the bone with every side eye glance or smirk that had tugged on his lips, or the way he didn't hesitate to get into Tony's personal space whenever the two of them had been alone. They were memories that Tony often blocked our, but in a twisted type of way often
And surely everybody has their weak spots, something that just gives everything away. Whether that's the way you stand, the way you look, how your eyes move or your finger twitches, whether you're revealing a hidden emotion, telling a lie, hiding a secret. Everybody has a weak spot and Peppers just so happen to be her eyes. She may be a very strong, independent woman but she's easy to tears and it's the unshed tears in her eyes that give her away, that with one blink from her or one wince of pain from Tony will send her over the edge; a flood of tears. And Tony honestly doesn't think he could take that.
"Well Bruce is a nerd."Clint snorts, cocking his head to the side.
"Everything happens for a reason, Tony."His voice is so soft and laced with an emotion that Tony just can't put his finger on. Steve knows, deep in his heart, that he would've stumbled across Tony sometime or another. Tony was the son of Howard Stark, a man that Steve respected and honoured to give him the chance to fight for the good things in life whether it be back in the 1920' of now. Of course Steve would want to meet Howard's son.
"What about it?"Tony asks because he's heard more than enough questions about it. He'd been dragged around his parents party like a rag doll, poked and prodded by wondering fingers and pushy old bastards.
"You actually
"You should eat more."And Tony can practically
"Enough about Rhodey! Your friends! What do I need to know about your friends?"Tony is changing the subject swiftly as he looks over at Steve, leaning further back into the counter as if it will make the moment any less awkward, instead it just makes his chest seem to stick out further and show off the arc factor under his hoodie more prominently in the kitchen lighting.
me, the person who takes their coffee black with two sugars and is OCD with his music taste and would choose Burger King Cheeseburgers over a gourmet meal any day, and that- that other stuff, that's not me.
"He has a name, Buck! It's Tony, Tony Stark, say it!"
"I am, Sir. He's a pleasure to be friends with, I can't imagine being friends with anyone else but him."Rhodey replies with honesty in his voice because he can't imagine his life without Tony now that he managed to wiggle himself into his life. It was endearing, and he loves Tony with all of his heart In a way he didn't think he'd be able to.
"I-no, of course not! I'm not, I-"Bruce had stuttered and became flustered in just a manner of seconds and Tony would have felt bad if it wasn't for the fact that it was a tell tale sign that Tony was in fact correct.
. The name seems to roll off his tongue like the way that the ocean waves roll onto a beach, a slip of the tongue so naturally as if meant to belong there and it feels so right. It seems to make everything, whether better or not, good.
"Tony..."
Tony can feel a feeling of unsettle in the pit of his stomach as he comes to the realisation that he's technically 'gate crashing' a friend get together night. He knows that Steve invited him, but he wonders if his friends were comfortable with the idea, and if they weren't, how would they react with having Tony hanging around on a night that's only for best friends, not no good strangers from Long Island.
Tony had taken it upon himself to snatch the keys to Stark House the evening that he had left for MIT, with his suitcases in the trunk of one of Howard's magnificent cars that he's sure not to miss and AC/DC blasting at a high volume as he drove the distance from Rhode Island to Massachusetts. He had swung the keys around his index finger, a smirk playing on his lips as he leaned against the doorway into his best friend who sighed and groaned and grumbled about spending their Spring Break in Malibu.
main reason why people wanted to get close to Tony Stark, his good looks and boy could only get him so far when it came to the older generation or the newer, Money is what they want, and Money is what Tony has.
"You're a Neurosurgeon, what are you doing getting yourself preoccupied with a case that clearly belongs to me."It's more of a demand than a question because if there's one thing that Tony Stark dislikes is before getting involved in his work.
Steve doesn't waste any time getting into the car, Natasha already driving off the moment the car door is shut so that she doesn't get fined nor does the car decide to die on her. Lucky enough, the car does indeed have seat belts which makes the car that 1% safe to be legally driven on the road.
"You're going,"Tony's face is frozen, his voice is laced with dread and realisation that has every fibre of his being to tense and flinch simultaneously. His chest stills, there's a sharp intake of breath that follows his jagged, pointed words because as much as Tony knew this was happening, he didn't think it would be this quick.
"Oh chill, Steve. It's not as if you're the only fan of Bon Jovi."
, as if feared that it's not Steve at all who answered the phone for Tony's aid."Tony, what's wrong, it's-"Steve casts a look at his alarm clock,"-3 in the morning."
him and it makes his cheeks warm.
"Honey Bear!"Is the greeting that James Rhodes is met with the Second that he steps into Stark Mansion - and okay, sometimes he thought that Tony was over exaggerating on the size but now as he stands in the grand front hall, it's fucking massive - with his suitcase trailed behind him on the marble floor and a backpack slung over his shoulder.
"Okay, Okay, give me a second."Tony laughs, throwing his backpack and coat onto a nearby chair before grabbing the Fuzzy yellow tennis ball out of Dumm-E's claw. The robot spins on the spot in excitement."I swear, though, if you break something-"It's an empty threat and he throws the ball across the workshop and watches in utter amusement as the 'bot chases after it.
"Tony."It's just his name, it's so simple, just 4 letters, but it's coming from his mouth. The words are still shaped in that soft way that Steve has always managed to say his name, as if it was some sort of blessing or miracle, as if his name holds so many precious wonders. Nobody has ever said his name so softly before and Tony wishes he didn't, not now, not ever.
"Rumours? Oh, no. The truth."Tiberius Stone casts his eyes down to the glowing blue of the Arc Reactor in Tony's chest, body so casually leaning in the door frame of the lecture hall that Tony is about to enter but his face so dark, so set and calm all rolled into once. Tony has to look up, stretch his neck a little, in that way that he has to do when talking to Steve but very different.
irresponsible to get us arrested!"Tony sound offended more at the fact of being arrested rather than being called a brat, which in most cases, he is and he isn't exactly in the right place to try and deny that he is. Being arrested, however, was a low blow because Tony not only has the brains to not get arrested but the money to
"You don't even know him!"Bucky finally bursts with a shout, frustrated with not only Hameln but with Steve of how dumb that he is acting, of how dumb that he's being, how dumb that he truly is for Tony.
"It is? Oh fuck, shit, how long was I- never mind, I'm sorry, go back to sleep I didn't mean to wake you up, go back to sleep, goodnight Steve, or is it good morning-"
"Well your opinion is invalid."Steve scoffs, throwing his mobile onto the bedside table as he stretches himself, a groan escaping his lips."I'm going to the kitchen, you want anything?"
He didn't expect her to answer anyway, she rarely does nowadays and that's okay, Tony knows that he's busy with her job since her promotion, but it does still hurt that Tony seems to be the only person that reaches out and never receives a reply in return.
"Steve, if I don't buy you something I'm going to be in our debt."
"I have nothing to apologise for."Steve is suddenly offended, taking a step back as if he's been physically blown.
"Complain."He groans, wanting so desperately to be handed painkillers ( which he will profoundly refuse to take but he offer is great ) and a blanket and left to die for the next 24 hours.
The weather outside this morning, and the weather that has continued to drip down throughout the last week, is wet, dreary, dull. It's autumn weather in the middle of spring, with gusty forces of wind that knocks loose pages out from between heavy pages of books and pellets of raindrops that leave you soaked to the bone in a matter if seconds that one time that you forget your umbrella. It's terrible, dreary, sorrowful weather that, without a doubt, matches the state of mind that Tony happens to be stuck in.
Shamelessly, Tony had made himself right at home the first time he had visited the Rhodes household, bundled up with blankets and ushered in front of the fire the Second he came in front the snow blizzard outside. He was a people pleaser and a damn charmer, and Rhodey would've been jealous of affection his mother was giving to Tony but really, it made him happy that Tony was getting the motherly affection and attention he knew he deserved.
"I'll do that."Steve insists, setting his own cup onto the table and throwing his backpack onto the bed as he assists Tony on pulling the suitcase out from under the bed.
The uncomfortable blue chair is empty
"Watch it, Steve, Thor looks like he's closing in on your guy."Phil comments from across the room, a hand carding through Clints sandy blonde hair.
"I don't care about anyone else. I care about you. You've been looking after me since I woke up, and I think that you deserve to go home and spend it with your family."He huffs stubbornly.
"You don't have to get me a cheeseburger, but I need a screwdriver. If I'm not allowed to have my bots in my hospital room, at least I can do is fix this television."He grumbles, his annoyance making his heart monitor beep a little faster."You look like shit, what happened?"
Sarah sends him off with a cautious kiss on his cheek, patting his forearm to send him off, telling him that she'll sign him out and that he's free to go.
"I'm allowed it eventually,"He rolls his eyes again, scratching at one of his healing scars on his face, mid down his left cheek. It was stitched up and healing, just one of many that was covering his body both from the incident and from past accidents."Don't worry, I'm not going to die."Giving Steve his best smile, he watches as Steve finally sags into the chair.
In some way, Tony should be happy that he's heading home, that's he being discharged with a clap on the back, a complete food and work out schedule to get him back on track and a stern talking to about looking after himself. He should be happy, it means that he gets to sleep in a bed that doesn't have a mattress made of rocks and a room that gives off the comforting smell of motor oil and aftershave that still lingers despite the many times the housekeeping staff clean his room.
And that's that.
"Stupid, Fucking stupid!"Tony swears loudly, the message already send before he can delete what he had just typed. He was on autopilot, as if he was texting Rhodey, because as much as Rhodey was as straight as a ruler and has told Tony on numerous occasions, it didn't stop Tony from flirting or being the first person that Tony latches onto when he's drunk and being as slutty as always.
He'd gone to the bathroom, James had told Tony when the Doctor had reentered the hospital cubical that was currently housing James Barnes, neither of them acknowledging the massive elephant in the room, that 'gone to the bathroom' was code for too many words and a much bigger situation. Barnes was not exactly looking at the familiar young doctor but not ignoring him either as he shifted every moment or so on the bed, it's paper crinkly with every shift of his body and without words, it remained an awkward reminder of words neither shared with one another all those years ago but has outrightly said aloud to other people.
. Wanting Steve.
tell."
The Warehouse ( a nickname that Pepper had once quoted without a slight bit of fondness and therefore became the name for Tony's house ) had been a work in project for many years until Tony finally kicked himself in the ass to completing the project, sick of sleeping in Stark Industries workshop with a crooked neck. The Warehouse was equip with JARVIS throughout as  trusty surveillance and included three main floors, the main floor, Tony's floor and the underground Workshop which lead to Tony's private garage.
As much as Howard sees his son as a failure - and really, it can't be seen as Tony's fault because the only reason he has the campus label of a manwhore is because he wants to rub it into Howard's face - he can't disagree with the fact that Tony is a genius. It would be said to be the only good thing about Tony from the eyes of Howard, that he has a brain in his head and ideas in his mind that blow Howard Starks ideas out of the ocean.
It makes him feel alive, with the way that the icy wind would nip at his bare skin, cause the goosebumps to rise across his skin, or the way that it blows in his face and wakens a usually exhausted Tony into a conscious state. It's freshening, it wakens him up and makes him feel.
Unlucky enough, he didn't sleep as long as he hoped he would last night, waking up sometime between 1 in the morning and 2 and started to fiddle with every bit of equipment in his hospital room, including touching up the television so that it broadcasted British television and to the heart monitor so that it would just shut the fuck up.
"I stick by what I said. You'd drop everything for this guy, which you barely know, who could be a serial killer by the way, because you just love to feel charitable to poor souls that you find scarred and bruised in hospital rooms."And Steve swears, there's an undertone of jealous in Bucky's snarl.
"I'm your friend,"And damn that super solider hearing that Steve Rogers was blessed with. Steve turns, a hand still on the trolley but now looking back at Tony with eyes that Tony was sure we're bluer than any ocean he has ever came across. Tony would never admit it, but Steve was handsome and it wasn't in that sort of fanboy way - because he will refuse until his grave that he was ever a fan of Captain America as a child because he wasn't - it was a more in a;
The nerves never settle and only seem to get worse as the dinner approaches and he hears news of who will be attending from the bustling staff who pass him and Rhodey in the hallway. He knows that he shouldn't care of who will be here, but in a way that he does, these are the people that will be handling the company alongside Tony whenever Howard bites the dust and as much as Tony is an alcoholic to be, he doesn't want to be known as an asshole alcoholic like Howard.
"Holy shit! Who owns that bitching car outside!"A shrill voice is screaming throughout the house, followed by a chorus of 'shut up's and harsher profanities which the voice obviously doesn't give a crap about as he continues on."It's a v12 Aston Martin, don't shush me!"
"I'm not sweet on him!"
But back to it being cold, it's a type of cold that Tony can feel all the way to his bones, staring at his finger tips, at his toes and causing a deep shiver to run up his spine, but he doesn't mind. In a way, he likes the cold, the type of bitter coldness that you only get during a winter night in New York, it's one of the few things that he likes about being back in New York.
"Yes, how bad of me for getting blown up just before Christmas, I should've thought about Howard's Company first! How would the media handle such news that Stark Industries are selling dodgy missiles!"Tony throws his arms up into the air, moving past his Mom so he can make his way up the stairs."Nothing ever fucking changes, does it?"
"Says the guy with a
"You don't have to leave so soon, we can go out somewhere if you'd like, see Brooklyn."Steve suggests, looking coy at the doorframe of the bathroom where Tony had last left all of his belongings.
Rachel frowns up at her big brother, obviously not taking what he has said to heart. She may not be as old as Rebecca, as wise to her Brothers grumpy antics, but she's not stupid and knows that what her brother says shouldn't be taken to heart. Rachel was a split image of her older brother, with dark hair tugged into two pig tails with blue doe eyes, pasty skin.
In hospital, he's been sheltered from storming Paparazzi that have been following him since the announcement of Howard and Maria Starks pregnancy, he's been out of the way of his Fathers mood swings and back lashes, he's been through a rough patch of detox and damn, despite the fact he has a hole in his chest, he feels pretty damn good.
This state of mind is not alone, however, because when Tony Stark is sad, or sorrowful or stuck in self-loathing pathetic rut, it's often accompanied by awfully stupid decisions and the need to act as if he hadn't two brain cells to rub together. Which, Tony has learned, is how men like him to be, is how women like him to be, because men and women alike love to have someone who is usually so strung up, well presented and dominant, under their thumb so much so that they can't even string a sentence together. And so, that's how Tony acts.
"He's a solider."
"When you met him."Bucky answers sullenly, sulking by the door frame with his arms crossed over his chest and hair hanging by his eyes, freshly out of the shower.
"It's so good to see you,"Maria whispers, pulling away from the hug but moving her hands to place on either side of Tony's slowly healing face. The scars were healed over and the bruises fading but he was still tender."I was so worried, Anthony."
"Good to see you boss. I brought that cheeseburger you asked for."Happy lowers his sunglasses as he looks at Tony through the rear view mirror, holding up a paper Burger King bag. Happy looks equally as distressed as what Rhodey and Pepper do but he's smart enough not to be as over baring as the latter.
Tony is sure he's going to die, I mean, he would be sure of it if he was conscious but he's not. The blast was strong enough to send him flying across the workshop, crashing into the liquor Cabinet that Howard kept in there for nights that he got frustrated and needed a numbing burn to slide down his throat. The impact knocked him out, the cabinet falling on top of him.
"Impressive,"Sarah smiles, looking at the Bot beside a younger looking Tony.
It's Tony, there's no mistaking those brown eyes, that glorious smile, the way he seems to move with a grace as if the world owes him something in return for his existence, the one-in-a-billion Arc Reactor that's nestled in his chest. It's Tony who's pictured laying half naked on a bar top, Tequila shots off of his stomach and thighs, it's Tony who's videoed grinding on the crotch of a man at least 5 years his senior, it's Tony who's-
"As if your Gordon Ramsay."Rhodey snorts.
Tony blinks, his eyes trained on the spot where Steve was once standing. His right hand curls around the top of his tank top, knuckles brushing against his arc reactor which causes him to cringe, the reason why Steve had left. Tony shakes his head, blinking again before turning back to the television that he was fiddling with, almost as if the last 10 minutes didn't happen.
"I want to do this."
Bucky takes the card hesitantly and Tony is reminded about that time he had offered a once longing haired teenager a cigarette, shaking the packet until they had complied and taken one, sitting down beside them on the damp wood of Steve's front porch that cold January night in Brooklyn. He flicks the card over, stares at the Two-named law firm inked in black before putting it in his own pocket.
Don't get Tony wrong, he loves his Mom an awful lot because c'mon, Maria Stark was his Mom no matter if she was absent from his life from a young age and had a strong relationship with gin and painkillers. Maria Stark might not have been the best mother, but She loved her son.
That heavy pressure has been present for days now, tipping towards a week now, and there's only one explanation for its being there. As much as Tony doesn't believe that you can solve your problems with alcohol, it sure doesn't harm him in trying, because when you're drunk you don't care, and when you don't care you don't think, and when you don't think you don't feel and that's exactly what Tony was aiming for.
"Would you believe that I was saving some kittens from a burning tree?"A kiss to the other cheek. Tony swears he hears her take a whiff of his own aroma.
"Yes, but do you know the names of all of the James Bonds?"
Dropping the phone onto his lap, he's making a grab for the speaker and turning it off, surprised with the ringing in his own ears of how loud the music actually was. He has turned it up even further to block out the Christmas songs that was playing in the hallway. With the music now turned off, Tony can hear the soft chime of a bell of his heart monitor ring throughout the room.
Like the way that Tony has an undying love for coffee, black with two sugars, or how he constantly has the need to fix up things that are either broken or not up to his standards ( Steve learned that not only from Tony giving maintenance to the heart monitor but also because Steve had woke up from his nap that afternoon to find an old portable radio not only working but also picking up stations from different states, the hands of Tony Stark of course ).
"Yes but you can help me, I'm sure, because I've a dilemma."
Bruce takes a moment and Tony knows it isn't because he doesn't recognise the patient, because he had just had drinks with him that previous night, but because he isn't quite sure what to say. Tony rocks back on his heels, tries to make himself look busy as Bruce remains quiet, rereading the profile, taking a good hard look at Tony, sighing loudly as he sits back in his chair and recollects himself.
"So that's it?"
"Guys."Tony bluntly replies, taking out a bag of crisps from one of the many food bags that has been set on the counter. He watches the way that Steve's ears go extremely pink with a blush and Tony worries that maybe this is the hypothetical problem that Tony has been trying to suss out from the start because Steve is too much of a good guy and maybe his flaw is that he's homophobic.
"And how long to fit a normal prosthetic?"He asks, looking skeptical at the offer that Tony is giving to him, almost as if lies from years ago is delaying his judgement and Tony wishes it doesn't.
"I do!"
"What do you mean
"I didn't ask to be picked up, I could've walked."Steve voices when he turns to see her expression, lips pursed as she drives, eyes shielded behind her expensive sunglasses.
"Why me?!"
"I'm fine, lets just get this over and done with. Yeah?"
"Why can't you just knock?"Steve can still feel the cold sweat gathering on his forehead but his heart race has began to slow down as he looks at Clint who has just seemed to have grown stronger in the biceps with age, still remaining with that boyish charm about him.
"Making your own meal replacement shakes does not count, Tony."Rhodey speaks firmly, hands tight on his shoulders and pushing him out of the workshop, Dumm-E following behind him, waving a screwdriver in his claw for Rhodey to take.
"All good things I hope."Rhodey smirks, causing Tony to flash him a signature Tony Stark grin.
or not."Tony brings the flickering cigarette up to his lips, fingers posed correctly, large glasses sliding down his nose which he corrects with a little push of his index finger."What are you going to do, squeal on me?"
"Of course not, that's why takeaway was invented babe."Tony is pushing the menu into Rhodeys hands as he passes, heading towards his bedroom for the phone that he has stuffed down the side of his mattress to keep himself from constantly looking at his phone."Pick something and then tell them I'll have my usual."
"I should've been there."Peggy eventually speaks after what has to be minutes, hours, days, or so it feels, quiet and soft but not understanding because she
You could say, that's how Steve wounded up in hospital 3 days before Christmas, with a busted lip, nose and eyebrow and a few broken ribs. I mean, it could've been worse, he could've ended up like the guy he was fighting. It wasn't as if he fought for the sake of fighting, he did it for the little guy that couldn't fight for himself or the asshole at a party that tried to ruin it for everyone else.
He had been passing the supermarket when he heard a cry for help, and Steve with his damn good hearing and always sensing trouble, had of course lurked to find out where the cry of help was coming from and what was happening. He stumbled across a bunch of ill-mannered teens beating up a defenceless homeless man, and Steve being Steve, he wasn't going to allow them to continue.
It wasn't a lie, Tony is Intelligent, a Prodigy at that, and there were many people out for his intelligence, to kidnap and use the brains inside of his pretty little head for weapons, for machines and technology ahead of their time. But it wasn't
mean that I'm fragile."Tony huffs, stepping back to allow Steve to pull out the suitcase because he hates to admit it but he's lazy and he's rather watch Steve flex those muscles than do it himself. Steve pulls it out and sets it on the bed, stepping out of the way whenever Tony rushes to unzip it.
. And those words are stuck in Rhodeys mind as well, an accusation not a demand.
"Now this is a man that truly loves me! I could kiss you Happy but I don't think you swing that way."
"Yeah, um, I don't know Steve-"Because it's one thing being friends with someone outside of his comfort zone - and Steve is so far out of his comfort zone that he might as well be on Mars - but it's even worse meeting new people. Tony might be the worlds biggest social butterfly but that doesn't mean he enjoys the company of others because he
Rhodey follows because he knows very well that there are plenty of bedrooms that were not damaged during the explosion but he says bothering more of the matter. It was evident that Tony had a thing about sleeping with someone else in the room, it claimed to make him feel safer, protected and less vulnerable, it explained why he always looked more exhausted coming back from break than going away.
of it.
"I'm not that kind of doctor."
"My parents said that a lot about me. But they're dead now. I brought coffee!"He holds a cup in each hand, one for James and the other his own. His consult had been cancelled and Tony had made just with the free time to grab another coffee to awaken him some more and while he was at it, grab a beverage for his patient. And hopefully build some bridges in the process.
Natasha's car is a beat down, dark green Ford Focus, missing it's original passenger side door after a quick get away ended with the door being broken off by a lamppost - totally Clints fault - and now replaced with a black door from a similar Ford Focus. It's car that takes half an hour to start up and 2 hours to heat up during the coldness of Brooklyn weather, but a car that holds way too many memories and one that no one could bear let go.
"I know."He casts his eyes downwards as if a puppy being scowled before looking at Natasha whose eyes fail to meet sympathy that Steve is looking for. Natasha is strong, she's smart and she's been friends with Steve long enough to know not to give in to these types of traps.
"Tony."It's Rhodey's stop it voice, the voice he use to use back at MIT when Tony was being a bit too much of a show-off or a bit over the top. Tony looks at him offended, a squawk of a protest building in his throat because hey, you'd think people would be happy that Tony is still cracking jokes after such a traumatic experience but Pepper beats him to it.
?"Tony is no longer listening to what Strange is telling him as he gawks over the taller mans shoulder at the blond behind him, peering into rooms. Stephen turns just in time for Steve to perk up, finding the room that he was looking for just as Tony speaks up.
"I'm glad my obsessive James Bond knowledge
"A cheeseburger, as a peace offering or whatever. You wanted one two days ago, and I know that was two days ago and maybe I should've came back sooner, but I still brought you one."Steve smiles, pulling the Burger King wrapped burger out of his backpack, along with the other and some fries.
It makes Tony feel so out of place, the way he had felt the night before when he was bombarded with all of this unknowing kindness, thrusted into a friendship group that was so touchy-feely, barely knowing him but not hesitating to make him feel included.
"Hmph."
"Tell him I'm not home, I'm in the office or something."He huffs, lips chapped and dry and God, he's dying of thirst. He's not even sure what time it is.
Bruce had graduated 2 years after Tony had. While Tony was developing his first marketed StarkTab at 18, Bruce was graduating with honours at Harvard University at 19, a stones throw away from where 2 years earlier, Tony had been graduating with honours at MIT. It had taken Tony two years to graduate, it had taken Bruce less than that, not that Tony was keeping a competitive tally, it was just something he had noticed.
"I'm done, I'm done with this conversation. Get out."There's fingers pinching the bridge of his nose, a headache building at his temples, a heavy pressure behind his eyes because this is not what he expected to be dealing with, not today, this week, this month or
"Breakfast never exactly seems to be on your itinerary, Sir."
it from happening.
"They could've seen your dick."He laughs, followed by a chorus of others as they catch onto what he meant.
"It's good to see you too, J."Tony echoes, suitcase in the trunk as he slides into the backseat. Jarvis is situated in the passenger, A driver situated where he should be. Tony allows himself to relax into the expensive leather of the seats, head lolling back with familiarisation surrounding him."Y'know what I could really go with right now?"
"I know, I-"
Steve is taking the bags off of Tony and Tony can't help but to stare just a little at the way that Steve's muscles flex at the new weight and god, why is he only noticing now of how much muscle that Steve has?
I’m in a critically stressed year of my life right now and updates are scarce, I know that, but I’m trying my hardest to bring out updates and I’m trying to make them the best of my ability, even of the endings are a little quick and shady.
"Tony?"Steve immediately sits up, baby fine blond hair sticking up at the side of his head, eyes half lidded but mind fully alert at the sound of the urgency, the ear that seems to slick the questioned words of
"I thought that was later this afternoon."Tony pauses, looking up at the Doctor through glasses he seemed to have produced from thin air and frame his face perfectly. The glasses make him look so much more natural and normal. Tony isn't ready to see James Barnes yet, or later, he was actually guilty hoping that the man would bail, roll the dice and take the chance to run because if it was up to Tony, he would split.
in massive red block letters, his body bent over the workshop bench, a dirty blanket from his dirty couch in front of his make shift coffee table of bricks and wooden crates, draped over his shoulders by DUMM-E before making his way to his charger deck. He'd wake up with a crooked neck, dead arms and a dented line across his midsection, just under the rim of the Arc Reactor, JARVIS alerting him that he needs to get up and DUMM-E eagerly trying to shove foul tasting coffee at him.
"Get out of my house."Steve breaks the silence, body leaning over the kitchen counter, hands gripping the marble, his head tipped down as he breathes heavily through his nose. There's a thickness to his voice and Tony can't trust his own not to break if he does argue back. So he leaves in silence, his back to the house, not looking back, only looking forward as he sits in the drivers seat, fingers gripping the steering wheel, knuckles white, tears streaming down his cheeks.
Tony falls asleep with his leg draped around Rhodey and a protective arm around his waist, and wakes to the duvets piled up at the left side of the bed in the space that Rhodey once was, a late afternoon sunlight shining through open French doors that lead out onto a balcony that overlooks the magnificent ocean. His body shivers, his shoulders hunch, he huffs into the mattress as a breeze gusts into the room, ticking his skin and disturbing the flimsy curtains that remain.
"He usually texts back really quick."Steve frowns, creases in his forehead that Bucky forever teases him about that gives him an older look than he actually is. Steves phone usually lays dormant in his bedside drawer, but since befriending Tony it seems to be attached to him and as much as it's good to see him socialising, it was starting to get increasingly weird to see Steve
"Cool."
"Is my coffee that amazing?"Bruce's hair is just as unruly looking as Tony's, looser curls and rectangular glasses that he hadn't been wearing the night before now perched on his nose. It reminds Tony to have a look for his own, haven lost them sometime last night.
"No, Howard and Maria don't spend a lot of time at home, nor do they like photographs taken of them unless it's for publicity purposes."Tony grumbles, glaring at the wall in front of him. His hand finds it way to the hem of his t-shirt in a sort of comfort, his fingers accidentally gracing against the metal rim of the arc reactor that makes him cringe and extract his hand quickly.
"Come in,"He calls, giving Steve a motion to come in before going back to what he's fiddling in. Steve opens the door with a smile, shutting the door with the heel of his foot as he looks over at Tony. The teenager is sitting crosslegged on his hospital bed, a  - universal - screwdriver in his hand and tongue darted between his lips as he fiddles with what Steve can identify as Tony's heart monitor.
"How- how are you even
Tony had turned, offended, frustrated, disgruntled,
Tony was never sure what was worst in the caves, if it was the unbearable heat or the chilling cold, or maybe the torture and water boarding. But whatever it was, he survived it all. He was strong and resilient and sober for the first time in an awful long time and despite his aching lungs and bruised, pulsing flesh, Tony didn't crack under the pressure, under the beatings or water boarding or starvation.
But he'll tell him. Just not yet, but soon.
"I share a dorm with you, I know how you are. As long as I've got a place to sleep, I don't care."He laughs, throwing his backpack onto the bed and having a look around the bedroom. It's a big bedroom, not overly big that there wasn't enough room but big for only one occupant and sometimes none for most of the time."So what's the plan for tonight?"
"We'll decide on the night. Maybe even let Tony pick?"Steve plates the finished French toast, already putting on another round for himself. He slides the plate across the counter, hitting Bucky's thigh."Enjoy, Jerk."
"When?"
, Tasha, and it was like this facade of his professionalism just collapsed when he saw me. So I left."
"Yes, I know that, thanks."Tony rolls back his shoulders, feeling the need to square up and make himself feel and look bigger than he actually was."It's extremely complicated and consent is a massive big thing because this will be the first attempt and oh my god, what about
"Looks like Bruce is too, especially with how close-y close the two were earlier."Clint is smirking from his place where his head is resting on Phil's lap, a mouthful of potato chips."I swear, I thought they were both going to come a science orgasm with how excited they were talking about things like
of things that Steve was able to notice the changes in and for some staggering reason, it had bothered him more than it should've, and it bothered him more than he was allowed to be bothered. Steve had been the one that had decided to join the army, he had been the one that had decided to get up and leave his hometown, his home, his friends, his mom, his
"The problem is, you see, is that I have to fix this. For the sake of the company, of course, but you
Steve wasn't exactly the person that Tony thought would be digging him out of the mountain of bits and bobs he buried himself in, especially seeing as Tony was probably One hundred and Ten percent that Steven Grant Rogers hated Tony just like a good percent of the world did. Seeing as neither man could see eye to eye on things, and seeing as Tony isn't one on making good first impressions he was pretty surprised when Steve actually asked him to accompany him.
Fed to the wolves of the media
"Save it, Cap. I'm only messing."Tony's smile is enough to reassure Steve that he's only teasing."Yinsen says if I can manage not to have a heart attack or die within the next 48 hours then I'm free to- oh! You bought me coffee!"Tony is snatching the coffee cup from Steves hands, letting out a blissful sigh as he takes a whiff of the coffee with a smile on his face.
It's a familiar position for Tony to find himself in, with heavy hands gripping his shoulders, body pressed against a wall, a counter, the door of a lecture hall or the velvet sofa of a V.I.P lounge area, but this time, he's not scared, just
"I forgot to phone Steve!"He says louder, more urgently before, turning swiftly on the spot."I'll be five minutes."
"I said that it wasn't doable."He corrects because he knows exactly what he said during a shared 15 minute break on a dreadful Thursday morning when Tony's idea had sprung the idea and continued to latch onto it as he was caught in one of his garbled, excited rambles that Strange surely couldn't understand. But he remembers, and he remembers what he has said.
'. He winces at the shooting pain that seems to soar through him and it's too late to stiffen his wince of pain before Pepper is gasping, the tears brimming her eyes. "Pepper, don't, I'm
for his work to be the best of the best and yes okay, Tony lives up to that role but it doesn't mean he doesn't like to hear a 'Well Done' or 'That's impressive' every once in a while.
Without tooting his own horn, Tony had not only succeeded his own doctorate in Mechanical Engineering but had picked up a few extra during his free time, when he hadn't been jetting off for foreign meetings in war wrecked lands or stuck with his head down the toilet. And medicine was one that he gained extremely fond with the closer he worked with the hospital and the more he began his work on artificial limb replacement, the more he wanted to know. And Tony, of course, couldn't stand being the only one without the medical title
"This is me and DUMM-E, my 'bot who I keep talking about."Tony looks proud as he smiles down at the next photo, already handing off the previous photo frame to Sarah so she can put it by his bedside."I built him a couple of years ago, he's a menace but I love him. The fucking board won't allow me to have him in my room."He curses."Saying that he'll wreck everything, but he won't."
Turns out, Steve's friends aren't as bad as Tony had feared, mostly because Steve barely lets any of them utter a word as he introduces Tony to them individually like Tony is some sort of prized poodle that has to be shown off.
"Is that what you think?"Steve's own self is leaning against a stack of hallway lockers, haven caught up on his loss of breath from running urgently out of maths class with an excuse of an emergency phone call, a panic that had settled in when he had got an unexpected phone call from Tony.
"Well I didn't promise you it,"Steve smiles, snorting a laugh just as Tony rolls out from under the covers of Steve's bed and nearly falls onto the floor, swiftly up onto his feet. His outfit hasn't changed, a hoodie and a pair of joggers but his hair is a messy of tight, corkscrew curls that remind Steve of that day he first saw Tony in the hospital, in joggers and a tank top, fully exposed in all his skin, muscled arms and scars.
Tony's hair is still a little damp, dark hair a curled nest on his head and his glasses folded over the collar of his overly thick hoodie with the MIT crest printed onto the front of it. Despite the smile on his face, Tony is looking a little uneasy for a reason that Steve wants to know but not enough to ask him.
"You do know you're a teenager yourself, right? No need to talk as if you're 70."Natasha laughs halfheartedly, giving her friend a side glance as she drives. Steve always had a habit of acting older than what he was, and it wasn't in that bad way where a 13 year old girl acts as if she's 21 simply by putting on make up and dressing like a skank, but in a way that Steve refers to things as if he was older.
"What if I've managed to mess up your heart even more so? Or put off your medication or recovery? Fuck, Tony, you're not allowed this stuff!"His face is pained in shock and guilt, watching how Tony could be so calm about all of this as he drinks his Coffee.
"I can't promise anything,"Tony gives the nurse a lopsided smile, offering her his hand to Shake and letting out a sound of surprise whenever he's pulled into a gentle hug instead, Sarah weary of the Arc Reactor as she hugs the teenager. Tony allows himself to relax into the hug for a moment, closing his eyes as he sighs in content of just being held.
"Thanks,"Rhodey can't help but to roll his eyes a little, because no more than 10 minutes ago was he studying for January exams and now he's on his way to New York to attend an Event to celebrate his best friend getting out of his hospital."I'll ring you before I get on the plane."
"Okay you."Bucky rolls his eyes in annoyance because there was no use in telling Steve any advice on how to text the babe that he's so obviously sweet on. Sitting up, Bucky holds his hand out for Steves phone."Gimme the phone. I want to see the babe you're sweet on."
As much as Tony wants to escape back inside, back into the warmth of Steve's lovely, homely home, his head is still aching from the socialising, the loudness of everyone talking, laughing, joking and it's just something that Tony isn't use to. So instead, he settles on hunching over in an attempt to keep some heat, shivering like some scared shitless Chihuahua.
"Look, I really don't see why you dragged me alone to go Grocery shopping with you, Rogers, but it's honestly a waste of time because I've never set foot in a supermarket before in my life."Tony confesses, kicking his foot against the tiled flooring of the Supersized supermarket that he stood in with Steve smiling like some sort of goof behind a trolley that was half his size.
" I don't kno-"
"This isn't just a fight that you start on the corner of the street, Steve, this is a war."She tries to empathise, wanting to get it into Steve's head, make him know that this isn't something small or little, it's not a petty fight or one that can easily be brushed under the carpet, it's a war, a grown-up fight, so be it."You could come away with a lot more than a few scrapes and a busted nose, you could lose your life."
"I said get out, Buck."
was invited too and of course; The Starks were the main attraction.
Rhodey hadn't stayed long, and Tony didn't expect him to either, and in a way he didn't want him to stay long either. He knows that Mama Rhodes wants him home before he's back off to MIT and Tony may miss his company, crave him attention and touch - because it's moments like these, where he's alone in the cold that he needs that familiar touch and attention - he's not going to get in the way of Rhodey and his Family.
"Oh don't bore me with your attempts of acting like your group is so angelic. You're not as subtle as you think you are. The entire bathroom stinks of stale cigarettes, it's a miracle Steve hasn't figured out the fact that you're all smoking in his bathroom because you're all too chickenshit to tell him."
"I don't believe that he would."
"You're speaking in 5 minutes, top left pocket."Her hand comes to pat gently at the pocket of Tony's crisp charcoal suit, a designer label stitched into its lining, a piece that has yet to be released for the public. Her eyes cast a glance at the glow of the Arc Reactor, so vividly noticeable through his white shirt before she looks back at him again."Please, for the love of god, don't go off script. Not tonight, or any night if that, but especially not tonight."
"Um, I'm looking for someone."Steve admits, watching how his mom walks by him with a raised eyebrow, almost walking backwards so that she can still speak to her son."I'm visiting someone."
With great pride, Steve can say that he not only now owns a laptop that has all of its original keys, but a phone that he no longer needs to flip in order to answer a phone call. He doesn't the phone often enough to know the ins and outs of his incredibly expensive IPhone but he is thankful to be upgraded to a phone of this decade and a laptop that doesn't shut down if it's away from its power source for more than 5 minutes.
"Am I not allowed to check my phone like a normal teenager?"Steve raises his eyebrow at Bucky because he's one to talk. Bucky is on his phone more than anyone he knows, other than Clint when he's playing colour switch or some stupid game like that.
"They should be grateful that they're even getting the opportunity to glance at my work."Tony mutters halfheartedly, picking up one of the prototype tablets that had been left abandoned on his clustered desk. He wouldn't go as far as saying that his bedroom is a mess, I mean yes it could go with a tidying up and maybe once in a while the maid could be allowed in to clean up, but Tony knows where everything is and it isn't
"Tony, don't you dare hang up on me. Where are you, are you hurt?"Steve is up and out of bed, hopping round the small bedroom in search for his clothes, for joggers and a hoodie and shoes preferably too.
"When, tell me
"So he's a Doctor now, huh?"Natasha states because it's more a statement than an actual question, told by the briefness of Bucky's text that somehow he was involved. No name was given but Natasha is far from stupid.
, has always been one to struggle to come off the edge of his tongue, caught somewhere in his mouth and bounced at the teeth. It's one that he once use to speak of with adoration.
"Shirt. Off. I couldn't have made myself anymore clear."
"Of course as a member of the Military, and further more under Stark Insurance, your medical bills will be covered, this also includes that of travel and accommodation expenses when you are not staying here in the hospital. There is-"
"Just take me to bed, Rhodey."
"8 a.m sharp, Tony. They're not as patient as I am."
"I swear to god, Anthony Stark!"And it should've been expected because Tony can never live up to his promises or does what he's told and Rhodey can do nothing else more but shake his head and plonk himself down in the hallway, ready to wait for Tony to emerge from the workshop or storm in himself.
He touches the curtain with the tips of his fingers, feels it's paper fabric that's so close to his grasp, his back turned to the acquaintance, the stranger, the
"Only for 10 minutes because I need to head out."He's already complying, toeing off his shoes and getting onto the bed.
"Maybe that's because you are?"Steve smirks, bringing the glass up to his lips and taking a sip. He can feel the familiar burn slide down his throat and settle in his stomach, his face twisted up in a sort of disgust from being caught off guard by the alcoholic drink."Seriously? Vodka and coke?"
"Of course you're not!"Tony squawks, defensive, standing high on his top toes, his shoulders rolled back, his chin held up high."I would
And God did Tony miss the coldness of New York, he missed the way New York seemed to smell; of street vendors and sewers; and when did he ever think he would admit that? That he missed such a city that only ever brought him tragedy and pain? Of a city so full of dull, grainy weather and loud traffic? But he did. Tony missed how New York shone at night, he missed how loud the city that Tony grew up in was, he missed dreary dark clouds that he use to watch roll into the city through his Warehouse window. He missed New York
And at 28, it's a good year. He features in Times Magazine. He earns his third PHD in Medicine to add to the growing collection. Stark Industries has crushed Stone Inc into the ground. He had improved the Arc Reactors abilities, with great difficulty. Obadiah is out of his hair. Tiberius has fallen off the edge of the world. Rhodey is safe and alive and striving well. Justin Hammer won't leave him alone, which is bad. Stephen Strange also won't leave him alone, which is good. Peggy is still in contact. DUMM-E is annoying. JARVIS is brilliantly sarcastic.
"Then why are you going to the hospital?"
, or at least that's what Tony keeps telling himself.
"Look, this isn't about whether I'm passing high school or not, this is about who Stevie is sweet on."Clint huffs, not up for another round of A Clint Barton Roast, because as much as he hates to admit it, Phil is right when he says that Clint can give but can't take.
much of a big deal ) but then again, his Father may pay a pretty penny to keep mouths shut but there's always someone fishing for more.
"Hey Aunt Peggy. I know you're unable to answer the phone right now, you're probably busy, but I just wanted to Wish you a Happy New Years, like I do every New Years, because I guess that's the normal thing to do. And yeah, I don't know, that's it I guess. And I miss you, don't be a stranger. It's Tony by the way, but I guess you knew that already, so um, bye and Happy New Years, again."
"Don't lie to me, I
"Howard."Tony finds himself automatically replying, looking at Howard with the same monotone expression that suggests he wants to be anywhere but here.
"Why do you have to be so nice to them?"The fellow teenager scrunches up his face, flopping down onto the opposite recliner chair, pulling the lever and elevating the leg rest. He has his own class of similar liquid nursed in his hands."You're making me out as a bad influence, punk."
Steve can't help but to notice the fact that Tony wasn't wearing a tank top like he was last time that he saw him, but now instead wore what looked like an extra thick hoodie which unfortunately so, still made it possible for the blue light to seek through. Tony catches onto Steves lingering stare, suddenly feeling self-conscious to the Arc reactor as he curls over himself and angles himself away from Steve.
"Jealous was more the word I was looking for but..."Steve pulls a face, leaning against the fridge and making it shift in its place, something that makes Tony's eyes widen. Standing in the small kitchen makes Steve look even larger than what Tony thought he was and okay, Tony might have a thing for blondes with muscles, sue him.
Hi! Sorry I’ve been so absent, if you haven’t been watching the news or have no touch with social media, 2020 has been a very crazy year! However I come with 2 (2!) updates, one small, one very large. Enjoy!
"I don't want to."It's almost like a kick to the chest, straight to the Arc Reactor and Tony had thought he'd prefer that more. Tony didn't like to share his things and for him to openly and willingly want to share something important with Bruce, just to be turned out, hurt so much.
He gets up from the chair, Tony takes a step back, feeling the papered curtain brush against his back, tickle the back of his neck as he makes it sway with his touch, knuckles white around the transparent glass of the tablet in his hands that illuminate all the information that Tony needs to see, that Tony needs to read out and nothing more.
"I'm in intruding."
"Maybe I've been busy."
One thing that Tony can admit is that his Mom sure knows how to present herself, beautifully made up in sophisticated clothing that costs a pretty dime and a smile that Tony would call fake if it wasn't for the occasion of which it's on her face for.
"Lucky guess,"Bucky grumbles, flicking a piece of eraser across the classroom and successfully hitting Clint in the face with it, watching how Clint whips his head around in confusion, trying to figure out what had hit him and who it was. Clint, despite the fact that his hobby and possibly future career is in dire need of being constantly socially away, is very much an oblivious, slow mess. He is the only person that Steve knows who could sense that you were coming his way 2 miles away but would jump out of his skin if you tapped him on the shoulder from behind.
When Tony is involved, nothing ever goes to plan and honestly, he thought that his Mother would know by now not to bring him along because it's going to end up in with an argument between Tony and Howard or something worse. It always does because Tony and Howard can never see eye to eye and both provoke the argument.
Waking up to find somebody in his bed isn't exactly a surprise for Steve anymore, mostly for the fact that, no, he doesn't sleep around and have a bunch of girls in and out of his bed like a Yo-yo, but because he's acquainted the most clingiest group of people that you could befriend. There's no doubt that Steve has gotten use to Bucky's snoring in his ear or Clints leg thrown over his hip or even Natasha curled in the corner of his bed. It's just something that happens, Steve doesn't question it.
Taking one of Howard's cars - the most basic and less expensive car that Tony can find in the underground garage that was not destroyed by the explosion - was an easy task, and Tony trusts Jarvis enough not to squeal on the young stark of the house on Howard as he takes the drive from Long Island to Brooklyn.
"Goodnight, Sarah."Tony turns onto his side so that his back is facing the nurse as he pulls the hospital sheets up his body and squeezes his eyes close, body tensing. Tony waits until he can hear Sarah get up and leave, shutting off the hospital room lights until he allows himself to breath again, opening his eyes to see the glow of the arc reactor light up the room.
"He doesn't seem too bad."Strange comments, looking down at Tony who hums and shrugs a shoulder, distracted and unwilling to talk about the situation.
A lot had changed when Steve returned and for a long time, Steve was unsure if it was the world around him that had began to change or if it was himself, and for an even longer time, he was scared to know the answer. Because change was not something that he was use to, especially when it came to his home, to his friends, to the routine that he had so regularly gotten himself wrapped up around for those years up until he met Tony, and the months after he had left.
"How is he-"
"Tony, stop being so melodramatic."
"Guys! They fucking found me! Get out here and save my glorious ass!"Clint shouts dramatically, yelling whenever balls of snow is being pelted his way from a nearby tree that surely can't hold Thors weight yet manages.
me over!"Steve has gotten defensive, squaring his shoulders, jutting his chin, standing taller than Bucky who is no stranger to Steve's stubbornness nor his short temper.
And he leaves, to finish his job.
unthreatening way as possible.
"Howard, this is James, A friend of Anthony's from school."Maria introduces almost proudly, smiling at her husband and then to Rhodey who offers his own polite smile in return, keeping his elbow locked with Tony's as he offers his hand for Howard to shake.
"If you came with affection and adoration yourself then maybe I would."Strange stands up from where he had been sitting at the desk, looming at opened folders that are spilling with pages, sprawled across the fine oak wood desk, somehow in a fashion that's so neat and organised to Tony's usual clutter.
"No you don't."Because there's no way that Rhodey would know, or maybe there is, because Tony isn't as discreet as he wishes that he could be, and Tony is also very oblivious to tabloids and gossip for someone who spends so much of their time fiddling with ways of how to improve technology and creating shortcuts to life.
Steve didn't want his money, he actually argued with Tony
, Steve."
His heart hammers in his chest, palms sweating, a pulse in his neck, lips trembling in anger or sadness or disbelief or maybe in betrayal as his fingers dance across a beaten up computer in the corner of his room. Steve's finger hovers over enter, trembling, hesitant, uncertain because does he want to have himself fall down this rabbit hole? Of every thought that he has, sight he has cherished, opinion he has kept, of Tony to be tainted by the truth of what he truly is?
As Steve walks away from the hospital, there's a car cruising along the side of the road and all of Steve's anxious, army fuelled skittishness seems to flare up in those moments that with every step and every turn that Steve seems to make, the car follows. He's about to break into a jog, loose the car as he dodges into an ally way and jumps a couple of fences when the car speeds up, as if almost sensing Steve's intentions, and the window is rolled down, revealing a familiar face with just as vivid, red familiar hair.
"Tony, as much as you think my professors are dimwitted, they know the difference between our work."He rolls his eyes, the tip of his pencil caught between his teeth.
"Don't smile at me like in that way."
"You purposely dug the information out, you've never liked him-"
"I have connections. And older friends which helps."And that's a bit of a stretch, because they aren't his friends, their his fuckbuddies of the night, the laps that his ass will make home for for the rest of the night but that's as friendly as people get when they're in college.
"Yes."Tony answers truthfully, keeping their stare."You'd do a lot of things to me just because you just could, and that's the truth."Tony's voice holds so much more, something that only Howard understands because neither might not be good with people but their good with one another, Tony can get inside of Howard's head and the same for the other with just words.
, perhaps, if he wants.
It was somewhat of a Christmas tradition between the group of friends, from the age they first got together as a group, having an extreme snowball fight was a tradition which seemed to get more violent each year as the teens grew up. It was always a fun experience, one that may end with bruises and pain but in the end, worth it to settle in the Barnes household for Hot Chocolate and desert.
"Yes, yes, I know that."He cuts him off just like he had moments before, sounding a bit irritated."But as much as you boast about how
for him to stay.
"There's tissue, here,"He points with the tip of his pen at the photograph, suddenly closely behind Tony, using it as a pointer as he speaks to Tony."That you surely can't manage on your own."
When Steve struggles for a reply, they finally turn from their place of standing on the chair, mouth falling into an O shape and coffee coloured eyes going wide in realisation that he wasn't talking to hospital staff, but to a patient that equally looks as battered and bruised.
"Tony!"Steve's always soft, always conceding voice is greeting through the phone. He's in a party type atmosphere, just like any Teenager would usually be on a New Years with his possible friends hanging off of his arms as he tries to move through the crowd to talk better.
"How do you know?"Steve asks, already climbing into the double bed and scooting closer to his best friends warmth with a yawn. He doesn't question what Bucky is doing here this time, he has learned long ago to not question what Bucky does and to just go with the flow.
. You want to know what this is?"
, Rhodey."Tony looks up at the man, his face fallen is shock and disgust of what he had to endure. Of course it didn't happen every day, because not every day did he eat, and sometimes Steve came up with cheeseburgers which was excellent but still.
"It's like 6am."His voice sounds so foreign to his own ears as he falls back into the bare mattress and Tony suspects it because he can hardly remember himself speaking over the course of the last week, muffled behind a curtain of his alcohol induced mindset.
"I wasn't the one that had a thing for picking up strays but kicking them away as soon as there's a fucking problem, Rogers."Tony snaps, feeling himself shake, trying to control his anger as much as he possibly can, unable to help it seep through. If it hadn't been for the fact he was in a place of work, one of which a job he actually liked being apart of, Tony would have tore the entire place to shreds on his rampage to scream in Steve Rogers face.
"And I don't think you should be interfering with what I'm doing."He grumbles back, his back to Steve as he fiddles with a couple of wires that were hanging out the back of the tv."You can either help me fix this fucking television or go away."
"Jesus Christ, Steve!"Tony flinches, the hand that's not cradling his coffee coming up to his chest and he swears, if it wasn't already for his unsteady rhythm of a heartbeat, he'd think he'd be dying. Tony turns, face meeting chest and he has to take a step back to look Steve in the face, heart racing, eyes wide and lips slack."You scared the crap out of me."
"I won't tell anyone if you come out tonight."
There's a sort of roughness to Tony's appearance that makes hospitalised Tony look like a God, in comparison to how he looks. Tired, worn out, broken, scared. His hair is matted down, a bruise that hadn't been there a week ago now formed down the right side of his face, dusted by his cheek bone and curved at his jaw.
It's worse still when Tony realises how clingy he has gotten over the last couple of days, especially after the night of the Dinner Party, where the memories of what happened after still linger in his foggy mind, the touches ghost like against his skin. And he can still remember the way that he has smirked at him, spoke to him in that way that he has so many times before, contrasted against the way that Rhodey had looked at him in concern and held him tight that night whenever Tony wouldn't stop shaking and refused to talk.
, I mean, I'm going to be checked up on constantly but it'll be worth it."
"Do I look like I've been living under a rock?"Tony physically and audibly gasps, a hand on his chest as he spins to have a look at Thor who's leaning in the doorway. Sauntering closer to him, Tony calls off in order, counting on his upraised hand.
"Hey! I am not
, he calls himself as Pepper left in the latest memo that he should take into consideration about a gadget he doesn't really care for but makes for on it anyhow.
Exploring his sexuality was never something that Tony thought about before going to MIT, he didn't care if he liked a cock up his ass or have his face between some girls breast and hey, the guys on campus didn't seem to care either. Tony was handsome, a right baby face on campus that the guys seemed to love and really, Tony didn't care what they did to him as he was too numb to even know what was happening.
It wouldn't be the first time that they've tried to take his ideas and it won't be the last either.
"I'm coming to you, I'll get a taxi, I'll be-"
"You're sick, I don't think you should be up and about. That is what I was pointing out."Steve soothes, his hands out as he walks further into the room."But I mean, you should leave it to the hospital technician to fix the television."
