Sieger’s gaze flickered back over Fräulein Regenbogen. He nodded and asked her for what must have been the fourth time in the last half hour, if she was all right. Did she need anything? It was almost funny how he went back in forth between pretending not to know her and mother fussing like a worried mother.
Ian shook his head and didn't offer up anything more; but his eyes betrayed him flickering to one of the other beds before he swallowed.
~*~*~*~
Except Stefen’s hands were on his shoulders and then there was pressure on his chest and he was being pushed away. And then it was Stefen standing between him and Bucky, staring the other man down with an expression made of stone.
Karlina had gone still and was looking at him now too, like a cat might consider the shadows where a mouse was hiding.
She turned her head away, and Tony thought he might have heard her sniff. He knew better than to comment or even look too hard, looking up instead pretending to be riveted by watching the snow fall. She didn’t look back at him for half a block or so, but when she did her eyes were clear.
It was an insane thing to dare, but what was fear in the face of what they’d taken from him already? What was torture if Stefen were killed and the children lost? It was a bold-faced lie. Tony wasn’t strong. It was just that he wouldn’t have a single thing worth living for if he lost the children as well as Stefen. There would be nothing left of him. Certainly nothing so heroic as bravery. Just the need for vengeance. God help them if they were stupid enough to put a tool in his hands.
And then they’re on the couch. Tony reads with his head in Steve’s lap, his hand tapping out a beat on the cover of his book.
And the screaming. The screaming was a dull roar in his ears.
“He’s too far gone for a tonic to do any good.” The doctor informed, continuing to pack up his trunk with agitated motions. “His best hope is to sweat it out. Draw the curtains, keep a fire built. The entire household must vacate elsewhere while the disease takes its course. Everyone who remains here will be at risk.”
"That I know. Thank you for the drink."
There was a moment of quiet while Steve processed her words, unable to come up with anything to say against them. She was right.
“I bet that was enjoyable.” Steve replied, dry as toast – but there was this damn sparkle in his eye, like he and Stark were sharing a private joke.
“Stefen. Someone tipped them off. Someone in this house.”
They both had their secrets to take to their graves. But Tony couldn’t shake the bad feeling that the grave was only rushing toward them.
Artur was sitting on his bed with Mon Amie’s cage, hair still sticking up on one side as he ogled his older brother like he was a fascinating species of fish that had flopped its way out of the lake.
Tony turned and situated Sara in her basket, tucking the braid Pepper had done up that morning back into her head scarf.
“Thank you, Frau Hogan. I'll...I think I'll join them. Herr Wiess.”
This is the Knight. Wendy is on her way to Aunty, with flowers from Berlin.
“Need something, Cap?”
“But if I do, what is the use in pretending I don’t?” Tony arrogantly waved away Steve’s words like smoke, and Steve gritted his teeth. The sound of their grinding was reverberating in his skull, so it took him a moment to realize that Tony was still talking calmly. Infuriatingly so.
He hoped their mission succeeded, but there was no guarantee that even if it did that Steve and those who had participated wouldn’t be dubbed traitors by the public. He could as easily be condemned for his actions as awarded for them. He knew that. He’d made his peace and judged it the right thing to do.
They worked quietly for a time after that, and eventually the stone sitting in Tony’s chest disappeared. And then, without looking up from his work, Bruce broke the hum drum sounds of the refectory with a sigh and a softly spoken observation.
"Don’t be mean to me Pep. I think I drank too fast." Tony moaned. At least it was a good enough excuse as any for the sick feeling churning in his gut.
That, he might have been able to stomach on its own truth be told (Germany was hardly the first country to fabricate some far nobler history for itself than had actually occurred) but he just couldn’t bring himself to read all that tripe about the inferior blood of Jews (and anyone else who just happened to not be blond haired and blue eyed) and the inherent degeneration of character that was sure to be the death of good moral Germans everywhere as a result of their mixing. It was enough to make his blood boil; and seeing as how setting himself aflame seemed rather counterproductive to the goal of surviving these mad times he found himself in he’d settled for burning the documents.
His engine was likely never to be finished. There would be little chance for engineering in the Captain’s home and all the more suspicion about his origins if he were to display such a remarkable talent for it. It would sit here a thing interrupted like so many lives since Anschluss. For the time being it appeared this was one more thing the Nazi’s would take from him as their due.
Stefen’s voice was subdued as he replied, the look in his eyes grim.
He’d expected Stefen's office to mirror what little he'd seen of the bedroom: richly furnished but sparsely decorated, bare of the typical assortments and clutter that marked personal spaces.
Steve sat quietly listening as Sam unwrapped his childhood. Most of the time he seemed aware that Steve was listening, other times Steve might as well have been part of the scenery.
“I need your help, Tony.”
“Master Ian,” She greeted him fondly already turning toward the cupboard as she said, “I bet I know what you want. I put the cider away this morning, but it won’t take long to warm up. I’ll even add a dollop of my spiced rum if you’d be kind enough to fetch more wood from the pile. I don’t know where Hortense has gotten off to. Probably off somewhere gossiping with Julia.”
They finally headed ashore what felt to Steve like hours later, dragging the boats up onto a small grassy stretch of bank and tying them to a pair of thick nails that Bucky helped him drive into the ground. Steve was glad to hand Sara off to Natacha in favor of unloading boxes of supplies and shouldering sacks and back packs on his back, as Tony led them into the trees in search of a proper place to make camp, lecturing the entire way about the local wildlife and what kinds of plants could be found in these mountains.
“Look the SS are no friends of mine either, but they wouldn’t dare do those sorts of things to citizens!” Zimmerman countered angrily.
“When the men come back, you’ll have to report for duty again won’t you?” she asked quietly, continuing to watch him fretfully, worrying her lip between her teeth.
He sighed.
Tony scowled, wondering what type of idiot this Hank fellow had been and Janneke laughed again, clearly delighted with the expression on his face.
Steve left Grig standing there in the street. It took him roughly thirty minutes on foot to make it to his destination. The little stone house was dark, the shutters on the windows letting out only cracks of light from inside. The lamp on the front door was left unlit, leaving the garden shrouded in darkness.
“Xavier is willing to finance the extraction.” He began and Susann nodded, attentively, her eyes narrowed slightly as she focused on him. “If Ret is willing to provide the Intel and help us recover Dr. Leshner it would help the mission to go a lot smoother.”
“Oh, but it really is time don't you think dear?” She insisted with fixed cheer. "You'll have to report to your new posting soon, and we'll want to have the deed done and the children moved before - "
He'd dreamed it many times through the years but never quite like that. He’d never put Bucky in his place like that.
"Child. Move aside." The officer snapped in a way that made Tony sure that he wouldn't hesitate to use force if the boy did not comply. Tony ran to grab him and pull him back, but Artur resisted, his face screwed up tight with fury, terrified tears brimming in his eyes. He struggled until Stefen took ahold of his shoulders and helped Tony pull him back. The moment he realized the new hands belonged to his father he turned into them, throwing himself into Stefen's waiting arms with a muffled sob and clinging tight.
“He is an organizer in the rebel movement and a very dangerous man.” Neuman warned in a low dangerous tone as he straightened up. “If anyone is to try and help the major subvert justice it is him, and he is not above killing statesmen like you and I. You are still a son of the Reich are you not? I would hate to think you and I weren’t on the same side.”

“This is sadly lacking that, not to mention foam, spice, and the milk has long since cooled. So it really isn’t anything but delicious and comforting. Just as mother used to make it.” Tony extended the plate with the small portion of cake toward Stefen who stared at it and then back at him as if neither of them made any sense until Tony quietly murmured, “She was very fond of the combination with chocolate and sweet cake.”
“He was a scholar not a spy! You never should have let him!”
“You can’t keep turning them away.” Charlotte said, but Father sneered over her, disgust dripping from every word.
"I'm not making friends much anymore." That was an understatement
His nonna had tried to warn him, hadn’t she? His poor nonna. She hadn’t seen him in two decades and Tony was all that was left of his mother. He'd promised her he'd come to her soon, but he'd prioritized the Captain and his children - thinking of them as family too, when he knew better.  His family was gone. All that was left for him was waiting in Pola.
“I climbed,” the boy answered in his accented German, as if that explained everything. At Tony’s dubious expression he grinned up towards the old hayloft and said, “There’s a window up there. You sleep up there so I know you know it.”
Maria nodded, pressing her cheek into her ball, suddenly shy again.
But Bucky, still chaffing from the conversation of the night before, froze, his face thunderous for a moment as he narrowed his eyes in warning, but Steve carried on.
“You stand to gain a great deal,” Stevens reminded him and Hammer puffed up like a bullfrog. Steven’s curled his lip in distaste, barely resisting a snarl as the man continued to rant.
~*~*~*~
He didn't learn it until after the children had finished their meal and Bucky had emerged from Stefen's office a few hours after, but Tony had been right. Bucky had not found Péter.
"You worry, Herr Stark?" Stefen asked with a hard edge.
“It’s Tony they want.” Steve shot back, turning to glare at the other man until his steps slowed. “Go back. Tell my children not to worry.”
He was going to be as tall as his father Tony thought, observing with a fond smile as Péter assisted Artur with the buttons on his blouse, telling his younger brothers excitedly about an album full of pictures his friend Ned had given him for his birthday.
“Nonsense,” Pepper scoffed, though Tony thought she didn’t look entirely certain. “I’m sure he was just trying to scare you.”
“That’s the spirit! We’ll be far too busy to miss anybody because the captain is giving us a special mission while he is away.”
“Stark, what are you doing up here?” the butler demanded to know. He was clearly surprised to find Tony there on the stairwell. His eyes flickered past Tony to the door, and Tony saw the moment when suspicion dawned in his eyes.
“Perhaps you’re right. On second look, he looks more like a Russian dog.”
All he could think of was the sound of skin on pavement, the look in Tony’s eyes, and that hard look in Natacha’s.
“I told the children. They know to keep to the room and not be a bother. Stefen and I have plans to go to the post today.” Tony said.  Going to the post was code for meeting with Maria. Grig and the others knew that he and Steve were trying to connect with their allies through the post but not who was helping them. Grig’s brow furrowed even deeper.
The man’s eyes lit up as he looked at Steve with interest. “Ah, what are you celebrating Captain?
Steve knew the truth. There wasn’t any choice here for either of them.
They went walking under the shady trees after lunch to let their stomachs settle and he and Tony talked while the children skipped ahead on the paths. Tony told funny stories about his first years at the abbey and Steve couldn’t help but laugh at some of his youthful antics, even if they largely disagreed on how inappropriate some of his behavior had been (particularly where a certain Brother Tiberius was concerned). Tony spoke fondly of the monk who’d run the infirmary, so much so that Steve felt a twinge of jealousy at how often the man’s name came up.
All of these excessive gifts were apology Tony realized, his chest clenching as he read Stefen’s words. Buying forgiveness had once been Tony’s style and he was very familiar with what it looked like. It wasn’t like Stefen, but then again his options were few all the way in Germany and he was a man of action. This had probably seemed like the best one available.
“I can’t imagine what you’ve got in your head Tony, but I believe with his assistance transferring your estate should be manageable.”
Tony swallowed thickly.
The children jumped back, as if the bucket had contained a nest of snakes, and Tony froze, anticipating what was to come.
Liar, Natacha thought but kept silent.
It was little hardship to assure her that they were doing everything they could for Major Rogers. How capable and sure they were and that she didn’t need to worry her pretty head about anything. He would never grow tired of the way his uniform, and he in it, inspired belief in the people. The awe never grew old and it was better than any high, better than any cocktail of downers and uppers. Better than -
Susann’s eyes danced with quiet amusement at his reaction and next to him Tony coughed suspiciously into his hand.
For three long, wet, hours they all worked together to keep the little vessel limping toward the shoreline. Luzzato guided Ester and stuck to the radio, alerting nearby aircraft and sea vessels to their position and giving the captain’s clearance codes. It was necessary to keep the French from blowing them out of the water, but just as likely to draw fire from German aircrafts. Tony pumped faster and prayed that luck was on their side.
“Well we’ll just have to fix that.”
There wasn't much, at least of a political nature. There hadn’t been anything suspicious or noteworthy in any of the rooms he'd been in thus far. He was certain anything of value or importance would be kept in the captain's office, locked, or in his bedroom, also locked, and since Tony had no reason to be in either of those spaces if he were seen he’d have to wait for a more opportune time to pick the locks.
There was something wrong with the captain. It was as if the man he had written too in the past months had sent a pod person home instead. There had been little glimmers of the Stefen Rogers Tony thought he'd been getting to know, but the Captain had been mostly withdrawn all day and into the evening.
“Wars are not won on battlefields, Stefen, they’re won in boardrooms. Your enemy only retreats when the cost of waging it is too high.” Tony replied, sharp enough to get past Stefen’s defenses. Drawing blood drew the heat of his stare, but there was no mistaking that they were both present, seeing each other in their entirety. “Soldiers die meaningless deaths. You need to learn to look higher, Captain.”
"Can I take my zoology book on our adventure?" Artur asked, tugging on the sleeve of Tony's shirt to gain his attention. Tony pried himself away from thoughts of the night before and blinked down at the boy, who was clutching the heavy textbook to his chest like a lifeline. Tony glanced around the boy's room, which was a mess of open drawers and discarded items that had not made it past Pepper's inspection.
“I’m sure you don’t,” he replied stiffly through his clenched teeth. “But I’ve a private matter I need to attend to. If you don’t mind running along and telling whomever you need to, that they whistled, and their dog is coming. I’d appreciate it.”
“Whatever he promised you, we’ll pay double if you can get us to the station in half the time.” he offered, and that was the end of the fellows wavering.
Tony narrowed his eyes at him and shot back with a deceptive air of flippancy.
it, Bucky continued, a shudder running down his spine.
Tony’s heart leaped into his throat, his first thought being ‘My God it’s happened.’ They’d assassinated the Führer! But wouldn’t Artur have said if something like that had happened? His frantic thoughts raced through his head as he and Ian scrambled to follow after Artur.
Steve let the words sit between them or a moment. It felt good to say it plainly for once.
“How can they do this? How do they expect us to live?” Antonia bemoaned, sitting down heavily in her chair. No one answered because the answer was obvious. They didn’t care how the Jews would live after it was done. Overnight every Jew in the nation would become entirely dependent on the charity of the delegation and under that much more pressure to emigrate. The DELASEM, already understaffed and underfunded, would be overrun. They wouldn’t be able to help them all or get them all out before the worst happened. And the worst was coming.
It was about a sailor with a dead bird tied around his neck as punishment. No matter what he did he couldn’t get away from the bird. And it was a big, big bird. Tony said it was a metaphor.
“Shut up.” Steve snapped, his neck heating, but there was no real fire behind it. Kroger leaned forward with a wide grin, the smell of potential entertainment at Steve’s expense caught in his nose now.
They’d procured a long table from somewhere and there were boxes of tools and lumber stacked haphazardly around them. The children were back in those hideous jumpers Stark had insisted were play clothes (god only knew where he’d bought them) and his own breaches were rolled up exposing his calfs. His shirt was untucked and was also baring several questionable stains. Harold, who was sat on a chair nearby happily watching the whole production, jumped up anxiously as the car rolled up the drive.
Outwardly Steve looked fine standing in a corner with Charlotte, playing host to her parents and the usual gaggle of hangers on, adversaries and admirers alike. But a closer inspection was all it took to notice the pallor to his skin and the dark bruise on his chin that even Pepper’s best powder was struggling to hide. There was a terrible tension in the way that he held himself, like a tree being cut away at the base seconds from toppling.
His Nonna’s letter lay opened and well read on the side table. Tony had read it and reread it till it burned the back of his retinas.
November 21
Floating in Steve’s arms Ian closed his eyes. The next step was to push his head away until Ian was in front of him and was floating on his own. But Steve found himself lingering.
~*~*~*~*~
“You take a breath, find your note and it’s just yodel-lay-ee-oo. See? There’s even a song I know. We’ll sing it together. We’ll be so loud no one will even remember the thunder.”
And wasn't that a sad thing, Steve thought with a wince.
Tony took the warning for what it was and reached for the offensive little thing. He made a show of pocketing it. There was that unreadable flicker again in the captain's eyes and Tony wondered if he might not have blown his chances here before he’d even really begun. Rogers clicked his tongue dismissively and to Tony’s complete surprise he let the matter drop. Rogers did not strike him as the type to back down however so he did not count on it being a regular occurrence but he appeared content not to press the issue. Indeed the man turned and without any real acknowledgment to his children headed for the hall, murmuring as he departed for them to carry on.
“I got one of the fuckers.” He growled, wresting the wheel away from Tony. “We need cover kid!”
He finally turned his head and looked at his godfather once more. Looked at him in his pressed slacks and matching jacket, the salt and pepper beard he always sported trimmed neatly upon his face, his blue eyes staring back at Tony hiding so much scrutiny.
Which turned out to be a good instinct, because he found Péter out on the terrace just outside the ballroom doors, neither one seeming to mind the chill that had kept everyone else indoors.
He'd known it! Her French was near flawless.
When Tony called out for a solo from Natacha, teasing her for ducking out on practice for their concert tomorrow evening Steve was glad. The house had been full of singing for days, but he'd missed the sound of her voice.
~*~*~
“James!” Natacha snapped over her shoulder, and the boy snapped out of his horrified daze to grab Artur who was standing beside Péter, clutching his brother’s shirt with one hand as he watched the violence unfolding, driven to solemn silence.
The words got under Péter’s skin like the prick of a needle. It wasn’t even that it could very well be his family one day. It was the realization that this was happening to his family right now, and to pretend otherwise, would mean pretending that he agreed with Harry when he said he shouldn’t be too friendly with the people who mopped his floors. Worst of all it would mean pretending that he agreed with the Nazis, who had taken the Klein’s lives apart on the grounds that they were worthless outsiders.
“Come with me.” He grabbed Tony’s hand and lead him through the crowd in the square, his eyes fixed on those arches. Though most of the celebrations were back in the square, the lights in the windows lit their way, and the sound of music followed their steps in the snow as they approached the ruins. Some had come to the old Roman theater to gather, sheltered some from the wind under its great stone columns. The little pockets of light from the candles they held bathed their faces in light. It made the shadows dance long upon the stone arches, and that was perfect for what Steve had in mind.
“You really do think you’re lord of the house. Don’t you Stark?”
Even now he was latched on to his father’s shoulders and drifting along behind him like a king’s robe, smile wide as anything.
He closed the folder in his lap and effectively the door on all that hope burgeoning in their eyes, and slid it back toward the admiral.
Sure, he looked enough like Hughard that no one was going to spot him immediately as a Jew; but Tony had never even tried to deny his Italian heritage. Who wanted to be Aryan anyway?
"Oh yes, I am terrible amusing aren't I.”
Stefen was still ill, easily knocked over by the damn wind, but of course none of that mattered. Stefen stood up and put himself in between Bucky and Stark like a human shield and Bucky saw red.
“I know it can get a bit dark, but so can the world, and better that they work through these things in a safe environment. The glass box always shatters Captain, and in my defense Sara naps during literature anyway and the rest of your children are uncommonly bright. They’ve already read everything available to them in the house twice over. Maria was picking her way through your copy before I ever got involved.” he rambled. “It’s in French did you know? She doesn’t even speak it. Well she does now, we’ve been learning, but my point –”
"Frau Hogan?" the baroness called to her, a hint of scold in her tone and the housekeeper shifted closer to the bed, as if she half expected the other woman to try and snatch at her.
Virginia nodded and got back to her work. Stefen exited the dining room through the service door and walked down the long narrow hall to the kitchen.  He was not surprised to find the kitchen busy, but he raised his eyebrows in question when he saw that Natacha and Ian were both up, sitting at the table with cups of warm coco.
Good, Bucky thought. The rescue was done. Lucas and his companions on Kirk’s ship and probably half way to London by now. It was over, and now maybe Steve could think about getting the hell out of Austria and leaving the damn Germans far behind them.
“Governess,”
“It would be a shame, you know, to miss out on such a great meeting of minds. Maybe teach em’ a few things.”
“Oh Captain, my Captain.” He departed with a cheeky wink and a smart salute, gratified at the annoyed huff of breath he heard Stefen release as he shut the door behind him.
"Don't put your children through that,” the lieutenant said meaningfully, meeting Stefen's eye and trading something briefly without words that Tony had no hope of grasping. And then Stefen broke the spell with a slow nod, prying Artur's arms from around his waist and shushing the boy's cry of distress with an aggressive wipe of the tears that stained his red cheeks. It was as if he thought he could destroy the boy’s devastation with his bare hands.
The tower standing in the middle of a city of gleaming metal was tall, impenetrable, possibly even imposing, but made elegant by sleek glass. It was a place where light could penetrate every corner, but nothing you didn’t want could get in. In such a place was all the hope in the world: the bitter, poisonous, dregs of the past cast away where they belonged for a brighter future.
Humiliated, she dropped to her knees and began to frantically scoop up the spilled almond powder. Her heart was pounding painfully hard in her chest and she didn’t know why. Didn’t like it, or the fact that her hands were clumsy and wouldn’t stop shaking.
“I like taking care of you,” he heard himself admit, dragging his hand down that inviting flesh. It was warm beneath his palm.
Clinton cursed in French, and Tony winced because Natacha was past her pronouns and had done very well with her adjectives. Oblivious to the girls murderous gaze Clinton went on in his thickly accented German, “She threw a rock at my skull, that’s what’s going on!”
Tony waited, curious as Artur murmured something, his hand still mostly obscuring his mouth but Maria seemed to understand. She nodded hesitantly gaze fixed down at her lap.
He’d expected to always be an outsider looking in on the happiness of others – while Bucky would go on to build a home and have a gaggle of babies.
“I heard you Emil, only it’s awfully close to curfew and my Father does worry,” she demurred, looking past the young man’s broad shoulders for any sight of Harold with the car or Péter emerging with his group from the cinema.
“Alright, alright. Artur partner with James, Natacha with Ian. Péter why don’t you and I-” Steve began but Péter interjected.
, his eyes seemed to say, and Tony smiled.
A moment later Hedwig came with a menu and a frothing mug of beer. Bucky smiled at her because he appreciated a woman who knew how to greet a fellow and it had been too long since he’d had the pleasure of a beautiful woman in his bed. His nights were full now, chasing rabbit trails. It was enough to drive a man to drink.
He ran directly into Vreni as he left the boys room and had barely finished apologizing for that when Cameron came darting out of nowhere with arms full of linens and nearly crashed right into him.
Tony thought that he could be happy with the quiet life of a retired clergyman, with his good friend Captain Rogers. In fact, at this point he was sure that having such a life denied him once and for all was going to break his heart. Did that stop him from pressing forward?
“Corporal. Stop by the barracks. I need a change of uniform,” He commanded, leaning forward to ease the pressure on his legs. Riding in side car was like trying to cram himself in a suitcase.
"I told you I'm not any good!" Da reached out and pushed his shoulder, teasing him gently. "Tell her you like her dress today or something. Tell Gisella, she's good at running.”
"If I wanted my son making all my mistakes, I'd be a fool Bucky." Stefen grumbled, reaching for the abandoned paper at the edge of his plate. He looked back at Péter who was staring back mulishly, lips clamped together tightly. "Where were you all day?"
Tony glanced up and caught Ian's eye.
James faulted and looked at his father expectantly.
She looked to Stefen for help, but he gave no impression at all that he'd even heard the words going on around him; though she knew it was a pretense. She could tell by his very stillness that he'd heard every word and simply chose not to be of any assistance.
The pair was moving now, heading towards Tony and Ian and Tony couldn't help the feeling that he was being prowled upon as Stefen’s gaze fixed upon him.
The Forum was a good place to get lost in. It was the heartbeat of the city and the center of its commerce, drawing folks from all ends, both land and sea. There was beauty in the old stones bathed in the golden light of autumn, the dancing colors of the leaves on the rustling trees, and the aquamarine strokes of waves just visible between the arches on the sea facing ends of the square. There was something here that poets would have written prose about, but it was soured by the stench of death.
“What about Dachau?” Steve jerked toward the man instinctively, pulse elevating. Was he talking about the rescue effort? The rescue should have been implemented weeks ago, Bucky well on his way to meet Kirk’s ship and Tony on his way back to the house in Salzburg if all went well. He kept telling himself it was too soon to worry. Travel could be slow in winter and Tony would surely send word through Virginia as soon as he reached the house.
"Why not?" Artur pouted sticking out his bottom lip. "Doesn't the mayor like to dance?"
For half a second Tony’s heart sprang up hopefully into his throat, thinking that the captain must have returned; but no, he discounted the errant hope almost as quickly as it had arrived. Hogan would have rung the bell to signal Hammer and Pepper if that were the case.
It wasn't Father's fault. He hadn't meant to hurt anyone. It was just that Tony never listened!
The fortuitous arrival of the deliveryman and an afternoon to themselves had seemed like an opportune time for Tony to make good on his promise of lessons in chemistry, and truth be told it gave Tony a reason to keep himself locked away out of sight while Werner carried out the rest of her visit.
Péter had papers for travel and money. They could come up with a story for Cameron and Daniel, or simply claim theirs to be lost. People were more likely to accept a bribe from a good German boy with the right kind of papers than not.
He was still shirtless he realized almost too late. If he had any luck left at all they were too focused on Stefen to have noticed him.
“Péter is giving him another steam bath. What’s wrong with your side?”
Either Dr. Erskine was a complete quack or Rogers did not want his children leaving home and was willing to diagnose them with every feasible ailment possible in order to achieve that purpose.
“No.” Tony instantly denied, heart still slamming away in his chest. “I’m not leaving you alone with –”
Steve carefully pulled his hands away and gave in.
I was going to say this was a treat for all those recovering after Infinity War, but I'm not sure it will be all that emotionally soothing. Nevertheless we hope you continue to enjoy this story and that you will R&R, even though we're terrible and don't always get to responses right away.
"That radio could be useful." Bucky retorted in a sly sort of way and Steve's shoulders tensed. Even though he'd thought the same thing, he didn't see a way to use it without raising Tony's suspicions. When he said as much Bucky rolled his eyes at him.
“Fine, Chavo,” he grunted in reply, praying that was the end of the boy’s insistent questions as his brain throbbed inside his skull like a heartbeat.
“None,” Tony sighed, allowing himself to be guided. His flesh warmed Steve’s palm. It would never get as cold as the mountains, but the sea air still carried bite. “But it’s not unusual for the larger trade vessels to only come to port a few times a year. And what with a war on, they may not be able to cross into these waters at all.”
"That is why my men must question his household!" the agent insisted not for the first time, jabbing a finger angrily against the closed report. "Our hands are being tied until an official arrest is made! The German people deserve -"
“I have a staff to carry my things.” Steve reminded him, trying not to be so damn amused by his antics and failing (he’d missed them too much).
Madness. Their life at the villa had been too public to ever accommodate such a risky gesture. But alone at the cabin, he thought he might have tried. A fire. A little help from Natacha and Péter to keep the younger children occupied elsewhere, and Steve would have danced with him. Two left feet or no.
“The Rogers live in the country, miles out in the middle of nowhere.” Ingrid shared with a vindictive gleam in her eyes, as if not living within the city proper was something dirty. Natacha supposed it was, but she quite enjoyed their quiet little villa.
Steve twitched, trying to cover his surprise and then feeling irritated that he’d been caught off guard. Of course, Kroger had been talking about Charlotte.
God, Stefen looked like shit, but he was the most beautiful thing Bucky had ever seen and he was alive. Maybe not for long though, because Bucky heard the roar of engines not far off and ducked low again. A line of vehicles made their way along the bottom of the ridge toward the two men. Bucky’s trigger finger itched but he stayed still, biding his time. If Schmidt and the others were here then Bucky’s men were either dead or forced to retreat. There wouldn’t be any backup coming.
The little boy slunk back into his seat.
“Well we’ve already got a varnish; paint is just a colored coating. Show me your tongue,” Tony instructed, and James opened his mouth wide perfunctorily before closing it just as quick to ask, “How do we get it to turn red? How do you make dye?”
“I asked but Julia's busy,” and before he could stop himself he added hastily to the lie. "So are Greta and the other maids"
"Not anymore he doesn’t. He could barely write two words together on paper, had to ask for help to transcribe almost all of the work. It was embarrassing to watch.” Dvořák laughed.
Bucky glared at him, waiting, as Kurt Dobas appeared again and placed a plate of Bucky’s favorite strudel on the table and backed away, before he continued.
Brother Filip was actually Agent Coulson, an army intelligence operative. He’d been placed at the abbey by the former chancellor, before Hitler’s rise to power in Germany. Something to do with the former chancellor’s belief that the key to restoring the German economy and overthrowing the yoke of the western powers after the loss of the great war lay in the wealth of the exiled Hapsburgs and restoring the Venetian monarchy. A pipe dream if Tony had ever heard one, and it shouldn’t have surprised him at all to learn that the abbots right hand man was just as much shadow and smoke as he was, but it still threw him for a loop.
Stefen had let him.
“Truthfully?” Grig paused with a sympathetic grimace. “I don’t know that he does. He needs someone to blame and they are an easy target.”
“Your uncle Bucky is just lucky the universe is so big else he’d run out of flattery.” Tony couldn’t help but laugh, hastily aborting a swallow of his spritzer. Even Bakhuizen threw back his head and laughed like this was the funniest thing he’d heard in a long time but Tony noticed that Natacha’s expression remained quite thoughtful.
“Ma’am. Aren’t you forgetting something?” Stefen asked with a raised brow and she stared for a moment longer before something seemed to click.
The attendant led them up to the Prince’s private suite, which was as opulent as Steve might have guessed, but he could barely appreciate any of the fine décor with his nerves strung so tightly.
Steve might have done it anyway, if not for the children. He couldn’t die that way when their futures were still not settled.
The words seemed like they hurt father on the way out, but that was odd. Because that's what they did, he and Da, look after everyone. That’s just what you were supposed to do.
“Don’t be dull. It’s not about your prowess.”
“Uh well…”
“Father, may we?” Natacha stepped up to her father’s side with a respectful dip for the General. “It would be such an honor.”
Except for yesterday, a little voice niggled at the back of her mind and she furrowed her brow in thought. He’d been happy yesterday with them in the mountains. Happier than she’d seen him in forever.
Tony cackled and biting back a smile Steve nodded politely, thanking the prince for his invitation and gently pulling the child away, wondering how on earth his children had ended up so dramatic.
“I think James lost his temper again, and that they should have sent him to cool down instead of leaving you to deal with his bad mood. It’s hardly fair to you.”
“I’ll help Tony pull you up,” he decided firmly before Steve could finish reassuring him.  Steve doubted they would be able to, had known it was a possibility the moment he’d spotted the window, but he simply nodded and hoisted Ian up by the waist until he could reach the sill and Tony could get a grip on him. Ian squeezed through the opening in one fluid motion of pale limbs and disappeared from view. Tony repapered a moment later.
"Only until other arrangements can be made Herr Hammer, I'm sure Bucky will have it sorted by the afternoon." Steve was trying to salvage what was left of the situation but Stark had other ideas.
“And don’t say shit children.”
The streets were smeared with rubble. Merchandise, furniture, clothes, and everything in-between strewn about by the mob as they shattered windows to trash shops. Shattered windows to destroy homes and drag their occupants into the seething body of the mob. Glass was everywhere, falling like snow from above, glinting wickedly as it reflected the fire light.
Hammer closed his mouth with a snap, grimacing with distaste at the mention of the gardener and Tony scowled, bracing himself for the usual drivel people spouted about the supposed inferiority of people like Sam (people like him).
“General Schmidt threatened me.” He heard himself say suddenly into the small group of men he was huddled with against the nights chill as they took their turn at patrol
Stefen turning out to be not much of a Nazi was all well and good, but deviant was still deviant. You didn’t have to agree with the Reich to despise that sort of thing. There were others in the world out there who shared his perversions but to hope that a man like Captain Rogers was one of them was laughable. <I>Captain Rogers</i>, lion of Austria, a pillow biter? Tony didn't know when he'd gotten so pathetically desperate.
“They boy took the money and journeyed to the fair where one could buy sheep, but as he was walking he encountered a crossroads. At this crossroad was a group of children, some just like him, some a bit older. They had caught a baby snake and they were torturing it with a stick.
Two days later an unmarked car was waiting for Steve and Bucky at the end of the block at the time designated on the slip of paper Siv had given him. The driver didn’t speak to them as they slid into their seats, Steve taking front, but Steve appreciated the silence. He didn’t think he had it in him for small talk that evening.
They were gone.
Tony made a sweep of the room, checking in on the children before he went in search of Stefen, snagging another glass of wine from a server on the way. He found Steve not far from where he’d last seen him holding court with Charlotte. He looked terrible, to Tony’s eye, his jaw clenched so tightly it looked like it might shatter at a touch, and he and the Count were giving each other frankly murderous looks. Tony was sure they’d exchanged words of some sort, and it didn’t bode well for completing the evening without incident.
“Tony, let me in.” He called out again, voice steadier but not feeling like his own.
“Yes, I did hear.” Tony answered with a fond smile, laying a hand atop Artur’s head.
“Ah, now you were always an intelligent child. So curious. They are treating you well? What family is this? Good family I hope!”
But Tony was surprised by the man who showed up with Cameron the following morning. He had Cameron’s dark hair and eyes, and a long thin torso that seemed to go on for miles until his head was in danger of knocking on the doorframe. It forced him to duck just to enter the kitchen. Joshua Klein was skinner than a wild carrot, and at first sight of him Tony worried he wouldn’t have the strength for the work.
For most the great hubbub of Christmas was a thrill to be looked forward to; but Charlotte had always found the deluge of parties and gatherings that inevitably filled her social calendar each year exhausting. When she was a girl, it had been tradition for the family to spend the remainder of the winter at her grandparent's estate in Switzerland. Charlotte had traveled and seen a great many places since then, but there was nothing like waking up in the little turret room at the chatue de nauge with its tiny windows looking out over the hills and down into the valley below.
“The Gestapo don’t ever need to know that he was here. We’ll be safe. He’ll be safe. It’ll be alright.”
“It’s too salty,” James whined petulantly.  Tony suggested that he think of it as a stepping stone toward all the sweet things he would eat when they got to London. James did not look entirely convinced, but he did pick up a very small section and begin to nibble on it.
No, god, not again.
"Ah." Steve pretended to contemplate it for a long moment and as the silence between them dragged, Natacha cast furtive glances at him out of the corner of her eye.
“I was not being theatric!” James immediately insisted in indignant outrage, voice climbing toward shrill. Here they went again. When Cameron made a hasty retreat, Tony stared longingly after him, wishing he had the same option.
The easy way he said it was no comfort. Steve knew orders when he heard them.
“I brought some of your supplies.” When Stefen’s eyes narrowed on him with confusion Tony licked suddenly dry lips and babbled on in a rush. “Just some sketchbooks and some of the pencils and things, I confess I’m no artist myself so I wasn’t sure what you’d need, but I’ve noticed the paintings, and when I saw you sketching the other day I realized they were yours, and Pepper thought it was a good idea and helped me get what would be useful. Because I just thought you might like – ”
“I didn’t think I’d ever love someone like that again. You know how it is I’m sure.” Kroger nodded at him in commissary. “You’re quite the lucky man. Baroness Schrader is a very competent woman.”
“I’m alright.” She repeated until slowly his hands stopped roving. His eyes pulled up to meet hers finding her gaze was steady on him. A stranger stared back at him from a familiar face.
“What did you say?”
. Somebody should have them, and that somebody was Péter. He knew it.
“Of course they are! They were to be released today.” Tony snapped, gesturing for the case which the man Lucas now held. Clint must have given it to him when he came back for Tony. Lucas quickly shuffled the case into his hands and Tony quickly rifled through it for the papers the warden had signed.
"I always eat with you. When I can." Steve amended when Artur frowned at him. "Go get ready, Artur."
Steve paused, unsure how to answer this one, but decided to keep things simple. It was still a dangerous gamble to tell them too much, something they might repeat in their innocence and bring the wrath of the Nazis down on them before they could make their escape.
Right up until the first war, Hill House had been a gem in the crown of high society; but since the Stark’s deaths and the dissolution of the Austrian state in Pola, the villa had fallen into neglect.
And it
"Pay them and get them out." Stefen cut her off, frustration chorded tight through every word. “I told you I did not want strangers in my home.”
“Ah, there we are.” She murmured a moment later, withdrawing with a clean sheath of paper and envelope in hand. Turning she flashed triumphant smile. “A house this large you’d think it would be easier to find good paper.”
His breathing came harsh and scraped through his chest. He squeezed his eyes shut, gasping hard for breath through sore lungs.
“If I didn't know any better I’d say you had a secret agenda, Cap.”
~*~*~*~
Clang after clang reverberated up his arms until they were sore and his head pounded with headache but he kept going, until something about the pounding caught his attention. It was different somehow, he paused, lowering his hammer as he realized the difference was that it was not in his head. Someone was knocking on the workshop door.
“A lesson in what? How to lie?” James retorted. Péter seemed surprised by the younger boy’s defense, saying nothing as he stared between him and their tutor with apprehension.
“Bullshit.” Bucky finally broke the stillness with a bark of disbelief. Tony was in full agreement. It was mad to even suggest that Hitler’s War Book would be sitting there in the room with them, all of his secret plans and strategies mapped out in one location. That book, wherever it was, was probably more heavily guarded than the Führer’s person!
That was the biggest problem, Ian worried, remembering back to all the times he'd woken to find his father watching him sleep. Da was in the dark place again.
He didn’t know what had made him remember the bible shoved at the bottom of his trunks. He’d known only that he was tired, a tired so deep in his breast that it ached like a wound, and something about holding that little book in his hands and flipping through it had managed what the liquor had not, his mind quieting as it focused on the familiar verses and the scent of old pages and worn leather.
!” Tony called for their attention urgently with a fixed smile on his face. Natacha looked up and the spell was broken. The others trailed to a stop as Pepper yanked the needle off the record and brought the music to an abrupt halt.
It had started to rain that evening, one of those late summer productions full of grumbling thunder that promised a sleepless night. But when it appeared that the children would keep to their beds and would not be showing up to provide distraction, eventually Tony decided to do as he always did when sleep avoided him which was to make his way to his work station.
No, at best Tony would be pointed back the way he'd come. There were other options of course, but they too almost did not bare thinking about, at least not at the moment. Right now there was nowhere else to go, nowhere truly safe, and no better chance than this. Tony squared his shoulders, clenched his bags tighter and recommitted himself to prying open the stubborn gate.
go hungry. He'd have fed Steve from his own plate, but it wouldn’t have been enough. Not for either of them.
“After all this is done, we should vacation to the Swiss villa.” She reached across the table and to his hand folding her delicate fingers with his. He grasped back, careful not to hold on to tight. “I feel like I never see you Stefen, and the children would love the countryside. It’ll be good for us. Once the Reich are done with us.”
- but now, now all he wanted…
But the Nazis weren’t really asking for his opinion, so Steve just did as his commanding officers expected him to do. He showed up in uniform and meandered around the room with Tony at his side, and tried to ignore that he was being presented like another piece in Göring’s collection as he was introduced to guest after guest as ‘the lion of Austria’ and exclaimed over.
Ian shook his head franticly, shoulders beginning to shake.
Thinking of Natacha and the other children led to thoughts of Tony as it so often did. The little family Steve had begun to dream of was just within reach. After the Führer was gone, things were going to be different he promised himself.
“Follow me, Captain.” Signora Santiago interrupted with a short nod, already beginning to walk toward the back of the house.  She was on the taller side for a woman, but Steve still had to fight not to tread on her heels in his urgency. She led him through her parlor room and back into the kitchen, where a pantry was tucked at the rear of the house.
The snap of command was back in Stefen’s tone and Tony couldn’t help the stir of arousal deep in his belly but he did his best to quell the feeling, because honestly. As if Tony was ever going to be displeased to find himself in bed with Captain Rogers.
And coincidently, it might even be supposed that with some careful investment it was even enough for a young couple and all seven of their children to make a new start.
Tony mouthed for him to relax and smiled to himself, turning to look out his window.
"I do not. But I've been instructed to guard the Major's children as if they were my own and it is a task I take very seriously."
He shouldn’t make Maria do it, she thought with a sudden swell of anger. She knew Maria wanted to, that she believed Tony when he said they had to sing so that people remembered; but Natacha knew that people would only remember what they wanted to. Worse, when they did remember her sister it would be with shallow regret and wistful sighs.
From here, things certainly looked that way; but Tony couldn’t accept the inevitability of losing the children and laying down their lives in Hitler’s war. Certainly not lying down. Inevitable?
"We got to Vienna alright, hitched a few rides and took a bus into the city when we got close enough. It wasn't much trouble getting tickets at the station. I told the teller we were on our service year, and that the other two had lost their papers on the bus. Don't know if he believed me but he seemed happy enough to let us go with a few extra coins in his pocket." Péter recounted for Tony later as the bus rattled along, his voice barely discernible over the noise of the engine.
Tony nodded. He’d take care of them. Never mind the necessity for his own survival he’d never intended anything else.
Their plan was in motion. As soon as Steve could draw up the first draft, the first issue of AVENGERS would publish and their network of resistance would go from the subversion of individual citizens to organized sabotage.
The days that followed were miserable things. They didn’t eat. Food that could little afford to be wasted went cold, Tony and the children to a man losing their appetite for it. They didn’t sleep. Every night Tony would sit in the chair, the bed crammed tight again with as many children as it could hold, staring out the window while the children sniffled and stared at the ceiling, static from the radio buzzing in their ears. Every minute of every day the thing was on now, filling the silence, filling their ears, failing to provide distraction from their desperation as the days ticked down and no sudden news arrived of Stefen’s escape.
“If you repeat that to anyone else it will be staunchly denied,” Coulson answered crisply. “You will be considered a threat to our operation. I don’t need to warn you what happens then.”
Dr. Fischer was already opening his briefcase, taking out instruments.
"The barracks are in Bayrischzell where we left em and Phillips is retired," Bucky reminded him as he worked with Harold to turn Steve's heavy body so that he wouldn't fall face forward onto the bed. "And you're burning up. Christ."
"Damn." Bucky cursed, running his hand through his hair. "We've got to get them out of there Stevie."
~*~*~*~
“Thank you. I’m sorry I made you worry.”
“Charlotte thinks it would be a good idea to announce our engagement soon.” Steve revealed, looking sad of all things. “I’ve put it off. I made excuses because I’m afraid. I’ve never been good at telling someone how I feel. I need some way to show it.”
Dvorak frowned at the sound of Rogers voice, the sound pulled deep from his chest like a gutted animal. It was a shock to hear him sound so...fragile.  Maybe there was something to the wild claim of his physician committing malpractice after all. The man looked to be quickly headed for his death bed.
Tony placed Maria carefully back into the water, even in the shallows the water reached to her waist (there was one Rogers who had not inherited Caps height) and watched the interaction.
He’d been clear! The room wasn’t to be touched! Everyone on the staff knew, so how was it that this one man had turned the entire house on its head in the space of a month! Had Virginia just let the man run amok? It wasn’t like her but damn it all if there just wasn’t something about Stark that got under the skin. Even Steve had begun to soften towards him of late. Well no more. It would end here. Antony Stark was going to learn his place if it was the last thing Steve did. If he could bring an entire company of unruly soldiers into line he could certainly cow a monk!
"All charming things I'm sure," Tony replied with a cocky grin.
“Te merav, te prakhon man pasho o dei.”
“I’ll bet you are. But not Magda right? That’s why they took her.”
“Well then, would you mind keeping us company until she is done?” The child looked wary, but her eyes sparked with interest as Tony pulled several coins from his purse. “I’m sure I don’t have enough to do an artist such as yourself justice, but would this be enough for a concert?”
“It’s not break time, pick it up!” one of the boys was ordering gruffly and the old man bent his crooked back slowly to comply, bones creaking.
The sudden sound of pounding footsteps interrupted the quiet and Tony jerked out of his memories as Artur came bursting through the doorway, cheeks red with exertion as he loudly exclaimed, “Tony! The Führer! It’s on the television, everybody’s watching! Frau Hogan says to come quick!”
Dvořák turned as the door creaked open again and one of their new Staff Sergeants entered, clutching two trays. His stomach instantly rumbled at the smell of nickel bread and fish. Ah, it was far past time for a meal.
“You must forgive us for making you go searching.” Tony drawled, not buying it for an instant. “Surely one of the maids could have fetched it for you?”
’ and ‘
“There is no discord between them and your father I hope? They were so very disappointed after Margrit married, but one must carry on and put a good face on things.”
“Péter a kitchen knife can either be used to feed the village or slaughter it. You and I, we make the choice daily what to do with it. I want to build a city Péter, not decimate one.”
might not have been said but they’d all heard it. What was more, Natacha seemed to know it despite what Rogers actually said with a hasty clearing of his throat.
The Academy was "offering" Péter a place there contingent on his exam scores, but Steve knew very well it was not truly an offer. It was a demand, undoubtedly set in motion by General Schmidt, who was determined to hold Stefen's children hostage in order to guarantee his obedience.  Interfering with the children, forcing him to attend that damn dinner in Berlin. It was all about reminding Steve of the power they held over him.
. One day his mother had left him with Bucky’s mother when it was her turn to sell at market. Rachel had sat Steve down with Bucky and told Bucky to look out for him because Steve was small and sick and Bucky would not be happy if a 'little brother' were to die.
Bucky was the one with a storm in his head now as they left the shop, feeling jumpy as a spooked cat as he tried to make sense of what he’d seen and what it meant.
“When Antony returns I will get to the bottom of it Tiberius,” Nik ended the man's protest before it could begin, but before he could dismiss the younger monk there was a great clatter as something heavy and metallic fell against the cobble stones and a voice that sounded a lot like Antony's hissed  a violent curse.
He thought viciously.
The heaviness that had been sitting in his chest finally lifted.
Péter sniffed wetly and buried his face against his arms, glad for a moment that he was alone and nobody could see him. They were all wrong. In a minute he was going to get up and go back down the hall to his father's room, because if his father was going to die then he was going to be there. He was going to get to say goodbye this time.
Steve should have known to expect something. When a man like Tony was quiet it could only mean that he was about to unleash some sort of chaos.
Hands squeezed Steve’s face. A beast tried to claw its way out of his stomach, and he lurched to the side of his cot, spewing burning stomach acid onto the floor. The hands grabbed him, wrenched at his bones, turning him over. Something round and blunt was forced between his lips and he flailed, desperately fighting at the tube worming its way down his throat, choking him. The object was suddenly wrenched away flopping out of his mouth after one long tortuous pull. Steve gagged, dry heaving, nothing left in his stomach to come up.
Stefen gave him a look of complete disbelief.
His wife Peggy. The mother of his children.
But Steve was shaking now in his arms, and not purely from the desire that was behind his white knuckled grip. Tony eased back, groaning as Steve chased his lips with a petulant sound of protest worthy of a stroppy toddler.
“Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, assist me in my last agony,” Tony finished for him, voice shaking as the man’s eyes slipped closed.
“Bambina. Your dress has to come off!”
A/N: This chapter ends the three part saga chapter six turned into. :) It will be a touch longer to get chapter nine to you but as some pretty major things happen in this bit we're hoping it will tide you over.
Thank god. The thought repeated itself over and over in his head. The shock of actually holding Péter in his arms might have kept him glued there babbling thanks to a god he didn't believe in for far longer, if not for the sharp blast of a whistle near his left ear and an aggravated bark from an officer to move along. Tony might still not have pulled himself together if not for Bruce, who carefully inserted himself between Tony, Péter, and the advancing security, guiding them both gently but insistently forward.
Robert spotted him first and gave Tony a polite nod of recognition. Harry bid him good evening. Johan twisted to see who had caught the other’s attention and quickly gave up interest with a bored sneer when he recognized who it was.
“He’s a dog!” Hammer sneered and Tony balled his fists. “If it were up to his sort this country would go to the devil. We’d still be at the mercy of the jews!”
He knew what Tony would say if the monk were there to see Steve pacing up and down the halls of his home, seeing things that weren’t there, staying up for days to keep the watch; but keeping the watch was what Steve had to do, to keep them all safe. He had lost more than he could bear already.
Steve had asked it offhandedly, just to keep the stilted conversation alive, but he instantly regretted it. Any openness in Péter’s expression shuttered away at the question.
“But he’s their best soldier!” he insisted, and Natacha looked like she wanted to roll her eyes at him. She settled for pinching him where no one would see and he squirmed in her grasp.
No, they don't exist anymore
“I couldn’t save my mother or Yinsen.” he finished, resolute. “I couldn’t save any of those poor people last night, but I can do this. I will do this.”
“Why don't you all go? I’m sure your friends will be more exciting than your father and I.”
“-it wouldn’t be at all the done thing,” Steve finished with a pointed glare and Bucky laughed.
Costumes were stripped and stored away, faces scrubbed and teeth brushed. Good night songs followed goodnight kisses and finally Tony closed the door of the children’s room behind him. They were so exhausted from the excitement of their two days at festival that they didn’t even protest his decision to take Bucky’s empty room for the night, halfway to dreamland by the time he closed the door.
“You had me, until you started looking just as pouty as your seven-year-old.” Chuckling, Tony forward once more and smacked a fleeting kiss against his lips. “And I’ll be damned if I swing from the gallows because I couldn’t resist

"It's a marriage of convenience. You understand? I can't offer you more than that. I wish I could," he heard himself say, gruff and not at all as gentle as she deserved but he could not find the words here either it seemed. She squeezed his hand, understanding in her eyes and for a moment Steve could believe that at least this one thing was going to be alright.
"Go home Major Rogers."
“Water!”
Steve shook his head to clear it. The monk had to go. He needed a proper tutor and Antony Stark was a laughable liability he couldn't afford.
“They don’t hang people from gallows anymore Tony,” Tony heard Stefen grumbling as he got up from the bed and stooped to begin collecting his discarded clothing. “And to my memory, you’ve not resisted Artur’s pouty face once. I don’t see why you have to start now.”
As they past shops, practices, parks, and places Steve had known since he was a very young soldier (places Sam had known since he was a boy) Sam pointed them out. He told Steve about the underground music clubs (a motley crew of musicians and other passionate fools playing with the jazz sound coming out of America to hear him tell it), the first shop he’d ever delivered to after he’d followed his father from the farm his family worked, the first place he'd ever taken a girl (Der Nachtfalter nightclub) and the alley behind a shop where he and his friends used to go for a haircut (a clerk named Einar would cut their hair for a krone each, one after the other after his shift).
Steve glanced down with a blink. Charlotte was watching him intently, her bright brown eyes roaming over his face. Steve gave her a tiny smile and straightened his back.
with Rabbi Benaiello, who has been put in charge of organizing the branch here in Pola. They want papa and I to help. They’ll be here tonight at the party to discuss it.”
“He’s gone Stefen. To look for Péter.” She said when he continued to struggle and Steve froze. Bucky had started the search without him? Well good, he decided a moment later. They’d already lost so many hours, he was glad Bucky hadn’t wasted more because Steve had lost control of himself.
“Don’t tell me it’s not rational Tony.”
And when Captain Altera had his officers drag the pleading man into custody until his story could be verified, privately Steve hoped that one day it would catch up with him too.
~*~*~*~
They nodded, almost one after the other, their ‘
“That took you ages! What happened?” Harry gripped, finally letting him go and Péter shrugged. Harry glanced over him with something like worry, gripping his shoulders as he asked after his heart. Irritated, Péter shrugged him off.
Lips brushed his ear and Steve's skin tried to crawl off his bones.
She said nothing more, turning with a swish of her pale skirts to follow after her siblings and leave Tony to his own thoughts.
but there was no fixing to be done. Only escape. Tony followed her lead and went back to his work helping Ian.
He was stroking in earnest now, sweat prickling at his temples, one hand rubbing without conscious direction at his stomach. Up and over scars and patches of skin that alternated between deadened and electric with nerves.
"Con te partirò" (I will leave with you) is an Italian song written by Francesco Sartori and Lucio Quarantotto. It was first performed by Andrea Bocelli, and though it topped the charts in France and Belgium it actually wasn't that successful (at first) in Italy. But a second release of the song with a portion sung in English by Sarah Brightman helped pushed the song to achieve record breaking sales throughout Europe and the US. To this day, it remains one of the best selling singles of all time and Con te Partiro is still considered Bocelli's signature work.
He’d walked that line himself not long ago. He was still walking it in truth, but he could not say he found acceptance as easy as he once had. How could he, when the want of something was opening up inside him begging for fulfillment?
“If what you’re saying is true, we won’t just lose the war. This will be the war to end all wars.” Holmes mused darkly. “The Germans will blow us all to smithereens before we can develop an effective counter offense.”
The thought of being miles in the air and at the mercy of the skill of Captain D’Anvers and her crew made Steve’s chest tight but he got on with it. They didn’t have time to waste and the children would benefit from a strong show of courage.
"Péter?!” He called out, unceremoniously shoving at the woman in front of him who let out an alarmed shout, but Tony didn’t even spare her a thought, that one barely heard word echoing in his head over and over again in the voice of a phantom.
“That is an issue for you to take up with command, Major Dvorak. This man is gravely ill. Please clear the room so I can see to my patient.” Dr. Fischer didn't so much as look at them as he finished preparing a needle and bent over Rogers prone form on the bed. The man's eye lids were drooping, fluttering weakly with the attempt to stay open. He clearly didn't even have enough energy left to turn his head away from the doctor as he drew closer.
“Péter’s old enough to know how to handle himself Stefen,” Bucky said, clapping Steve on the back as he moved to join James and Ian. “And quit being so bossy James. We need Ian ‘cause I need one of you to tell me what we’re doing here and the other to show me.”
Richly decorated in muted gold trimmings and rich brown wood, the room belonged in a painting, a sentiment only encouraged by the enticing rays of light filtering through the large windows.
Good enough for now. He knew Tony, and not even a fight for their lives was going to keep him at bay forever. Sooner or later, he was going to want to touch Steve again, and whether his nerves were on fire again or dead as they were now, it would be a kind of agony. But Steve would handle that when the moment came.
He wasn't cattle. He was human.
They’d loaded the car as quickly as possible and Harold had rushed them back to the villa, where Tony and Péter set up shop in his workshop. Pepper met them in the hall and Tony sent her off to begin heating water after inquiring after the captain’s health. He was still breathing. But Tony could tell by the look in the woman’s eyes she didn’t hold out hope that it would be for much longer.
(German) a type of cookie made with almonds and jam.
"I'm getting there Stevie, Jesus, give a fellow a minute to get a word in will ya!"
The men seemed eager to leave, and Tony couldn’t blame them in the face of Stefen’s dangerous glower. Tony saw them to the door and shut it firmly in their wake, but he could only really breathe again when he walked back through the doors of the sitting room and Stefen, who was kneeling next to the lounge that Natacha had been set in, looked up at him, the threat of violence still a ghost in his eyes, balanced on a precarious edge.
Stefen had said he’d never doubted that, and why would he? Ian was his best little soldier and soldiers didn’t get scared. The captain certainly never got scared where Ian could see.
Tony had no time to properly feel the rush of relief that swept through him, realizing that the police were not there for him but for Wanda and Pietro, because his thoughts too quickly moved on to what would happen if they were discovered. They’d go back to Dachau, back to being experimented on and whatever other horrors they’d witnessed there. Stefen would be arrested and the children… it didn’t bear thinking about. There was no time!
"Oi. Can you believe this about the Major?" The gentlemen in the cap grunted drawing Deiter's attention with a snap of the paper he held in his hands. Lt. Steven's shifted, uncomfortable with discussing the majors arrest with a virtual stranger. The whole thing was a tragedy as far as he was concerned.
Sara immediately ran to Tony throwing herself into his arms and he held her tight, beginning to shake. And it might have been considered odd, that Tony began to shake now, the threat of tears pricking at his eyes now that the danger had passed. But that was just the thing wasn’t it? The danger hadn’t passed at all.
“No woman would put up with you Bakhuizen.” Turning to Steve with a short nod of respect Harold went on to say, “We weren’t expecting you Captain. Ginny didn’t say you’d telephoned.”
Stefen let the others pass him, taking rear guard. His eyes flicked away from scanning the grounds briefly when the sound of a shudder breath drew his attention to James, who had managed to make it over the doorstep where he’d frozen, staring into the house as if he didn’t recognize it.  Big tears were rolling down his rounded cheeks and not the theatrical sort they’d all become used to. His shoulders began to shake when Steve laid a hand against his back. He turned and buried his face against Steve's jacket, shaking like a leaf, but managed to keep moving as Steve guided him the rest of the way inside.  He struggled to be gentle with James and hoped he managed it; but Stefen couldn’t breathe an easy breath until they were all inside and Harold closed the door firmly behind them and bolted it. Even then, he could not let his guard down. That door wouldn’t hold back a mob.
And if by chance, the Führer proved to be as mad as some feared, then one was left with no choice but to retreat.
“I remember.” Steve interrupted, mindful of watching eyes and ears too close to them.
Tony set Maria down on her feet, unprying her clutching hands and shushing her silently when she opened her mouth to protest. “They came up on the road. A man was driving and there was someone else with him. I think it’s a woman, but I didn’t get a good enough look.” Natacha murmured, keeping her voice low and Tony nodded, reaching for his pistol.
“He’s not well Natacha. He sees things that aren’t there and he doesn’t sleep! He- Ah!” Natacha dug her nails into his arm so tight he hissed in pain. She relented when he aborted talking to glare at her.
“I need you.” Stefen admitted baldly, the words soft as a whisper, but holding so much weight Tony’s knees felt like they might buckle in that moment. “Don’t go away.”
Pietro, who had already finished the process himself, was sitting perched upon a stool nearby, silently watching as his sister’s dark locks of hair were transformed into dark stringy blond. Neither child had spoken since Tony had gone to fetch them from the attic, still horribly shaken by the afternoons events.
“Morning Cap,” Tony greeted softly with a wave of his pen.
Right. Tony’s family was celebrating at home, and they needed to speak with the Rabbi. But before then... Steve looked around, his eyes catching on the stone arches of the arena rising up over the rooftops and an idea sparked in his mind. His heart kicked in his chest, beginning a furious beat.
“And help your brothers. They need you.”
Tense, Steve watched and waited as Tony’s relatives digested the revelation. An entire unspoken conversation seemed to pass between them all before Isiah smiled somewhat ruefully and quipped, “You teach them to talk, and they teach you silence.”
He landed with a jarring thud, a strange muted burn rushing up through his arms and into his neck. Dvorak’s boots landed beside his head and Steve flinched away from them, finding it possible now that the pain was dulled to roll over onto his stomach. Not easy but possible.
"I'm sure he's on his way home. Traveling must be -" Tony's throat constricted, making it hard to continue what sounded like meaningless platitudes even to him.  Péter had been outside in all of that. On the wind with no one to help or guide him during one of the bloodiest nights since war time. They’d given it a name for god’s sake.
The friendship between him and your father has become such a beloved story. I think it mystifies some people. They came from such different worlds, and yet they became so devoted to one another. Did you ever wonder what it was that drew them so strongly together?
She was standing straight, her expression stiller than water as Frau Zemo passed them in the hall, bidding them both a good evening, the curiosity in her gaze unbanked as her eyes lingered on them far longer than was polite.
Steve narrowed his eyes.
Péter was just finishing opening the last of his presents, the gift table littered with boxes, ribbons and paper.  Though Péter was very grown up with his thank yous and his handshakes, Tony was having a great time watching his face for the boyish delight he couldn’t quite hide as he opened each one. He’d saved his father’s gift for the very last, and Tony had a front row seat for the shock on Péter ’s face when he opened the box to find an old Kodak inside.
“Dvorak-” Rogers shocked him even further with the note of pleading strangling his voice as he turned toward him with earnest eyes and weekly reaching hands.  But he aborted the motion halfway through with a wet cough that rattled his whole body. He tried to bend double as he dry heaved but clearly didn’t have the strength.
“Where did you go?” a soft feminine voice sliced through his thoughts.
Eventually the cans were shot through and stomachs started to rumble, prompting Stefen and Bakhuizen to pick through Wilhelmina's basket and set to work setting out the cheeses, bread, and fruit she’d packed.  The boys darted back and forth between the little creek and their picnic. Their heads bent together as they stood on the bank of the creek, Péter explaining matter of factly to his younger siblings the concept of erosion. Tony smiled.
The old man… Péter could still see his eyes, hear the sound of boots thudding against his flesh… he’d never seen anything like that before. It had scared the little ones… and rightly so. But he couldn’t be scared. There was a reason behind what Johann and Bobby had done, even if it had been a frightening thing to witness. That was part of being an adult. You had to protect yourself, protect the people you loved, because there were bigger and scarier things out there.
Bucky laughed and squeezed his shoulder.
“Engineering is somewhat outside our purview I’m afraid but education is a worthy service for any monk, Herr General.” Stark answered tightly, and then he turned to the captain and said, “Captain, it’s getting late. Perhaps we should see about getting the children home?”
He had to stop thinking about them. Had to accept that they were gone – many dead – and that his hands weren’t any cleaner than those boys with their batons. Not when he’d
“You found him! He came back!” the little boy shouted excitedly, rushing up to Tony with hands extended eagerly. Tony held the habitat out of reach and made a shushing sound.
"I’d say till you were sick of me, but honestly not even then.”
Not unless she feared what Captain Rogers would think of it, and Tony knew that was the real reason for her protest. He scowled darkly. The man couldn’t be allowed to
Steve cocked his head at the files, frowning down at the colorful lines drawn upon the large map of the city and the surrounding county. It was more than ambitious, it was preposterous. Triple the amount of patrols, double the size of the intelligence office, and all of it was to be achieved by granting school boys the same function as SS officers. It was mad. But Steve doubted he’d be able to dissuade the Mayor from this plan. Olasz wasn’t wrong. Many boys were sure to join the Patrol once they heard what status it would give them.
Well, unless you were him but thankfully Tony Stark was one of a kind.
Your father will come back. There’s nothing to be afraid of. It would be true for her, up until the very last moment. Hope was the only merciful thing he had left to give her.
just made that dark pit inside of him open up all the wider. Bucky surged forward, snarling, swinging, trying to pound the pain in his heart into his Steve’s ribs. Steve fell back, grunting in pain and clutching at his side and Bucky was on him in an instant, swinging at him again with a ragged cry.
It was harder to say goodbye to the beard than he’d thought it would be. Shaving one’s face shouldn’t feel like cutting off a finger.
"I didn't know."
Angel of God, my Guardian.
“We all know exactly what you meant.” Natacha cut him off, raising her chin haughtily and not bothering to hide how angry she was. The others would be on her side now anyway. Poor Emil had turned pale and then very red in the face, embarrassed to have landed in such an awkward situation with her friends and his friends standing by hanging on every word.
Impassioned, Tony fervently turned the pages of the journal, looking for the old familiar diagrams.
“I keep telling Father I should like us to get a house in Vienna. Have you been Ingrid? It’s wonderful. Father’s friend the Baroness, the woman I told you about, she knows the most wonderful people.” Natacha knew very well that Ingrid had never been to Vienna but that was not the point. “Oh, well… never mind. I suppose you haven’t since your father is so busy at the railroad.”
There were five families of note staying at the berghof that weekend including her own: Funk, Göring, Zemo, Fennhoff, Rogers. There were also the families of the SS. Officers stationed at the headquarters next door as well as those who occupied The Kehlsteinhaus, but they were just wrapping paper.  They came to fill the hall for the speeches and the dinners, to dazzle the eye with the might and the size of the Führer’s growing mountain fortress; but it was these five families who had been personally invited to sleep within the sanctum of his home. To eat at his table, smoke in his parlor and take in the view from the terrace with his partner Eva.
“No, I'd not heard that.” Steve peered at the rest of his staff. “Had you?” he turned the question on to his chauffeur.
“Captain! We weren’t expecting you home.” Stark greeted them cheerfully as they exited the car. Stefen deposited the keys in Harold’s outstretched palm wordlessly and nodded at the chauffer when he apologized quietly and explained he’d park the car in the front, seeing as Stark and the children were currently in the way of its usual place.
“Major Dvorak, I trust you were made aware of our time schedule?”
It also might have been why Frau Hogan had started joining them for dinner. Tony didn't think it was a coincidence that she was sat in the captain’s usual seat.
choose to give a damn!” Tony snapped back.
“Major Rogers!” he heard the Assistant Chief call out behind him.
Tony did not get the opportunity to question Steve over dinner like he'd hoped, nor to find out anything further about their visitors because the whole night just seemed to be proceeding strangely. Pepper served them an uninspired if filling dinner of cold cuts and informed Bakhuizen - much to the children's disappointment - that his guests had chosen to eat in their room due to exhaustion from their long travels.
But Tony couldn't help but think as he’d stood observing his pink freshly shaven jaw for the first time in years, that the man staring back at him in the borrowed mirror resembled Hughard Stark too much for his liking.
’ expectedly subdued given the shadow of dread that hung over the conversation. But Natacha was in his arms, and Péter was teaching his younger brother how to play the board game with patience, and James was sleeping off the biscuits and jam that he’d gorged himself on that morning made by his sister's hands. It was far from perfect, Steve thought with a pang – he didn’t dare look over the boy’s heads and see Bucky standing there – too many missing faces... It was all that it could be.
“Tony?” Clint prompted nervously from the door, a second before Wolfe hissed again for him to hurry.
. It all had to stop – it was the only thought in his head as he pulled Tony in, hand cupped behind his neck to hold him still as he took his mouth. Tony was stiff against him at first, jerking violently with shock, and wrenching his head in a halfhearted attempt at getting free even as his hands balled in Steve’s shirt and clutched tighter, his mouth opening under Steve’s with a moan pulled from deep in his chest.
"Tony will continue to teach you, and I'm sure James will visit when he can just as he does now. I think you’ll love it, children. It’s very metropolitan.” Charlotte said quickly, wary of Natacha's silence and remembering the way the girl’s eyes had lit up in Vienna. “You'll have the best of everything.”
“You know, when you said rescue mission Bakhuizen, I was imagining less goats.” Scott’s grumbling was mostly lost under the bleating of goats that filled the back of the truck. Lang was sat in the bed of the truck along with Jons, their bodies as well as their guns and ammunition mostly hidden underneath blankets and the crates that held the loudly protesting live stock.
Tony wanted real partnership. A real relationship more like. It wasn’t unheard of between two men. That sort of thing wasn’t something one had ever discussed in public even before Hitler had come to power but Tony was familiar with the practice and the subculture surrounding sodomy. His sexual education had started tamely enough on his oldest friend, but had been spurred by reckless rebellion when it had become clear that Hughard expected Tony to settle with someone of his choosing. A good catholic girl preferably from good German family with appropriate business ties, feelings not required.
Steve scowled, raising his eyebrows. He wasn’t the only one who was watching the exchange either. He saw Bucky look up from where he was tying his leg to James, a spark of recognition and a dark expression passing over his face when he saw the boy. Steve wondered at it. Did Bucky know this boy?
"No time-" Bucky interjected, pushing Richter away with his good arm. "They're gonna be after us."
“These, Herr Stark, are my children. This, children, is your new tutor, Antony Stark.” He gestured gingerly at Tony. Tony’s eyes tracked the movement. “The children have a signal to call for them, as do the servants.”
When Ian cycled back to them asking loudly about all the different shops and Tony realized that a month ago he would have been blessed to hear a full paragraph from the child, he had the thought that however it had begun, and however the trip ended, he would count it as a success.
“Then I will hide in the cellar just as I did today, and he will be no closer to finding you.” Tony immediately cut in. A vicious sound of protest rumbled its way out of Steve’s chest, but Tony pressed on. “You need to go back to the children Steve. You know you must.”
He didn't consider himself a soft man, but she was a sweet child and even an old soldier like him knew she didn't deserve what the nation was going to hand her as she grew.
“Yep.” Tony said with a smack of lips. “Very soon, Stark ships are going to be armored with a metal plating that will make these mines of yours look like fun and games.”
Not for the first time Tony worried about Bucky’s strange behavior but the prickly way he was smiling warned him the other man was in no mood to be questioned about it. Instead Tony arched his eyebrows and gestured with his head toward the sitting room and Bakhuizen nodded, slipping out of the kitchen unnoticed. Within minutes the hall filled with the sound of clanging bells.
"Let go, Tacha!" he demanded and her lips curled in a snarl of disgust, not at him, but at the sudden stinging of tears in her eyes. "I have to get to-"
“They’ve their Sunday clothes. If that doesn’t work, well, I did promise Natacha there would be shopping.”
With a cheeky nod of his cap Clinton disappeared out the door again, leaving Steve and the men alone with the Boehringers. Steve opened up the small folded paper Clinton had left with him, eyes widening at the information written in small codded script.
“Yes, I know.” Tony interjected with a tired smile. “The better not to have it tortured out of me if the police come back.”
After a moment more with no return of the strange sound he thought he must have imagined it, until a particularly vigorous burst of thunder and a gust of wind caused the thin windows at the end of the hall to rattle and groan. The whimper wasn’t loud over the noise of the elements, but it was distinct and it was followed by more creaking. One of the children, realized, recognizing the sound of a child in distress. The storm must have wakened them, but what on earth had driven them to go up to the attic he had no idea.
“So she doesn’t have to follow the law? So much for all men of the Reich being equal.”
Which meant that Frauline Werner had lost every available reason to be where she was.
Baroness Schrader tilted her head, the amusement gone from her expression as she softly replied, “I’m afraid I don’t know what you mean Herr Stark. Stefen did ask me to handle putting the party together.”
He nearly jumped out of his skin when Bucky slammed his hand against the wheel, cursing, “Damn it, Stark!”
“Indeed that’s likely.” Vonkov sneered in reply and Göring’s wife who was sitting on Steve’s left, quickly took a sip of her wine to cover her grin. Though Steve couldn’t have been more uncomfortable Tony seemed unfazed either by the looks or the spectacle he and Vonkov were providing for Göring and his guests. He sipped the wine in his cup delicately with a deeply thoughtful expression, like he was weighing something heavy in his mind.
“It’s good to see you Sir.” Péter sounded unsure, and Steve could only hope it was because of the way they’d parted. He squeezed Péter’s shoulders.
2. Steve has never received any sort of treatment for his PTSD because that's not a real thing yet but OMG does he need it. Also PTSD is a thing in children as well. Which Tony is no way trained to handle, regardless of his own personal issues with it. Hold onto your butts.
To the end.
He stubbornly gave James the food off his plate and tried desperately hard to be a good big brother to him despite the little boy’s bitter resentment of his efforts. He took the fall for James’ tantrums and protected Péter even when the last thing Péter wanted was to be reminded of his own limitations.
"But you still doubt that I would take care of you," he stated as a matter of fact and Tony huffed a self-depreciating little laugh.
“As a matter of fact, Natacha. I’m not meeting the baroness. I’m taking Wiess to the Vienna station in the morning. I'll be back by-”
Tony thought about it the entire journey back to the motel, and by thought, he meant stewed. His good mood had soured. Stefen had promised not to keep him in the dark and to allow Tony to help when he could but it was obvious he had not meant it. Had those just been lies, lover’s words to placate him? Was Stefen under the impression that Tony was his
He hung back by the stairwell and watched his daughter through the open archway. He cataloged her every feature, noting the way that her hair had darkened, closer now to auburn than the fiery strands he remembered from summers that felt like centuries ago. Her face had become angular in unfamiliar places, and her body softer in others. Her shoulders and hips were wider too.
“Father has so many important matters to worry about as an officer. I don’t want him to have to worry about me, or my brothers and sisters so much.” Natacha said. “I am the woman of the house and now that I am better, he needs my support more than ever, so that he can be free to serve the Reichland.”
"I know this is hard for you to understand. " Father finally spoke again, after the woman's footsteps had faded. His voice sounded hoarse and he wouldn't meet her eyes. "But your uncle is in trouble, and I have to go."
None of it made sense. Stefen Rogers, a homosexual? No. Surely not! Stark she’d had pegged for that sort right away. The man didn’t do much to hide his eccentricities and Charlotte was a patron of the arts. She wasn’t naive. Some men were that way. In a strange way, perhaps it even helped them to be better artists – art after all, was an expression of pain and what more painful existence than the life of a homosexual?
A bolt of fear jolted through Steve as Tony’s words sank in. Péter couldn’t be tangled up with the X-Men. Steve would know. Wouldn’t he? But even as he thought it Steve’s mind was racing. He’d always presumed the people behind the X-Men to be young. University students. Kids whose hearts were in the right place but had no idea what they were getting into. Péter could easily meet someone and feel moved to get involved. He was a good boy. Always had been.
Tony's heart was pounding as Stefen closed the door of the music room behind them. He'd been mildly surprised that Stefen had chosen the room until he remembered that he'd seen Bakhuizen heading for Stefen's study after he’d dropped the bombshell on them.
“Good evening,” a friendly sounding voice chirped in English with a slight crackle of interference at the end. “This is Freddie at the Castle, reaching out to our kin at the inn.”
But until then, ladies from the German Labor Force were meant to visit today for Kaffee und Kuchen. If Stefen did not have the kindness to pull himself together, it was up to Charlotte to prop up the family image.
“Well perhaps that business won’t keep us too long.” Stefen returned after a beat. “Artur might be driven to murder if he missed Nockerl.”
He wondered what his father and Uncle Bucky were supposed to be helping them with.
And then a hand snuck into his blurred line of vision and Steve started. He looked up and right into Starks soft brown eyes.
ingenuity and design. There were simply no ships like Stark ships, and thanks to them and their specialized weaponry Germany had become a military giant. One could even say, as Hughard often had, that Starks had given Germany
The fear tightening in his stomach eased when Péter, flushing slightly in embarrassment but soldiering on with conviction confessed, “My father gets that way sometimes. He doesn’t like us around when he’s like that. He’d rather be alone I guess, but I don’t know if you like to be and I thought someone should ask.”
Patroche seemed to share the same affinity for food offerings. He’d gotten up from his nest and gobbled up the bread before ambling over to Steve in search of more. A few more days of similar offerings and the stroppy goat had taken to resting in a lumpy ball by Steve’s side for warmth. The first time it happened Steve had cried, silent tears of shame that he was glad no one was there to witness, stroking his hands through the goat’s springy hair.
He opened his eyes.
“Okay… but it’s for you. Just for you,” he pried and Ian looked back and forth between Tony and James, uncertain and fidgety as if he were searching for the right answer.
As the fantasy played out it in his mind, as he imagined the way that Tony would pant and moan as Steve took him apart it was all Steve could do to keep rhythm without losing his mind, pleasure building. So close. He was so…
It was silent in the room for a long horribly tense moment as he stared at it, and then finally he lifted his eyes to look at Tony once more.
Bucky looked quite put on the spot but he rallied quickly. "Yes. Anya, Péter. What on earth are you doing here?"
But they weren’t outsiders, and they certainly weren’t worthless. Not to Péter.
face.”
“Since when do you drink espresso?” Steve murmured, only half listening.
“It’s not just the children either,” Pepper replied with a small smile stepping over Maria who was helping Natacha sort through what looked like a mountain of delicate bright satin sashes. “He’s sent something for all of us.”
“It will be very dangerous… but I think you are right Captain Rogers, if Austria is too free itself from this madness then it is up to the people. We must cry out for liberty.” Franz stated with a level of conviction that seemed to suck the air from the room.
“Out of curiosity, what are your conditions?” he finally asked, scathing and bored in his tone, but Tony knew he’d won this part of the battle.
Stefen continued to stare at him for a long drawn out moment. Then he nodded, catching Ian’s eyes and jerking his head toward the door in silent command. Ian took a shuddered breath for courage and reluctantly moved back. He stopped just before he crossed the threshold, glancing over his shoulder uncertainly and biting his lip.
“Sure, Cap. It’s not a bother.”
“We can’t give into the fear. This storm will drown us if we do.” Tony pleaded lowly. His eyes were what Steve was drowning in. He felt like that sailor from that Italian opera he’d taken Peggy to. Like he’d lost his grip and slipped into a turbulent sea, only to spot the light that would lead him to safety as the waves crashed above his head.
nor of anything he was about to say.
“What are you snickering about now?” Stefen asked, eyeing him suspiciously in the mirror and Tony’s grin broadened.
Project X-Gemina, or simply Project X as his contact had called it.
Tony turned to head into the garden but Nonna grabbed his sleeve.
"It’s clear to me that you should stay." Steve invited, lips stretching into a hopeful smile.
"Oh excuse me - Captain! Merry Christmas!" Hogan called out brightly and he was quickly echoed by a chorus of voices wishing him a merry Christmas and offering him a seat at the table in turn.
James shrugged and wrapped his arms tightly around Bucky's midsection as if to make up for the words even as he said them, “No, she just likes Tony more!”
“I wanted six, but your father insisted they’d ruin the garden and since the party is for Sam, he thought that was in poor taste.”
Steve had seen livelier eyes on corpses. The blue of Schmidt’s eyes was like ice, void and frozen. When he did move there was not an ounce of gentlemanly pretense to his posture.
Kurt grinned.
"You seem fine with that?" he remarked, curious, but if he had any doubts about her feelings towards pushy Emil, they were settled when she crossed her eyes and murmured lowly in a voice that wouldn't carry beyond them, "Oh dear. I hope he still comes around."
A small smirk tilted the corner of his mouth upward as he added, “Far less, I imagine, since I expect I’ll enjoy getting on my knees more now than I ever did before. There are certain holies I could see my way towards becoming devout for… but even so, it would be just another box for me to hide away in and that is where the line between living with yourself and living with your sensibilities ends.”
And Steve did suppose that after what he’d done to the man, what stark was willing to forgive him, he was well and truly
He did not love her. If that had not been clear before, it was clear now in the way he had handled their engagement. By rights she should have been furious and turned him down. Imagine, seeing a man for as long as she’d been seeing Stefen only for him to simply disappear, calls unreturned, and not so much as a letter for weeks. She’d had to learn through a mutual friend that his promotion had finally gone through, ceremony passed without so much as an invite, and that he’d already reported to his post.
He would stay here in the goat pen until he was strong enough for the journey back to prison, she told him like a stern schoolteacher. But as she continued her futile effort to wipe at the grime that covered him with a portion of her scarf she continued to talk. Nervously Steve slowly realized, breathing shallowly and sinking deeper and deeper into an exhausted stupor as her voice washed over him.
“Cameron had a very difficult night patatino” Tony answered. Péter thought he sounded tired.
A flash of movement in the corner of his eye and he tensed as hands clutched at Natacha. Emile’s aunt. She smiled emptily at him, nodding kindly as she asked for Tacha’s and Ian’s company. Steve’s unwillingness to for the children to leave his side had not gone unnoticed by any of the party guests, eager as they were to meet the Rogers children.  Before he could react, Charlotte's hand gripped his arm in a death grip.
If looks could kill Tony would be saying the Lord's Prayer for Péter.
~*~*~
But no sounds came from within the cabin, and Bucky reappeared a moment later making a quick motion with one hand that Tony only just managed to make out in the dark. It was safe.
Why indeed. Tony kicked himself. Why was he resisting this so hard when it was what he knew he wanted?
And to fulfill the needs of this "visual" post (not to mention pimp one of my favorite Youtube Vidders:
They’d all laughed at that, and though the other men seemed to take it as a good joke at Steve's expense, Steve could feel the ice forming in his gut at what he’d known to be a thinly veiled threat. Schmidt was far from deterred.
“How about I play for you instead?” Bucky suggested to Sara after a few deep breaths had calmed his stomach.
He must remember (he must) that Tony was not their family. He had no family. He was on his own in very dangerous waters, and these were the very people who had everything to gain by disassociating with him. He’d been alone since he was seventeen-years-old, chased into a monastery by events outside of his control. Alone since the murders of his parents and Jacob Yinsen. He must take action and save himself. Nothing had changed.
Bucky put his hands up in and shrugged his surrender and Steve backed off, though he fixed him with a gaze as steely as ice, with no room for argument. Bucky fought back the urge to smile at the big idiot and sighed. Because Steve really had stuffed his brain in his cock and somebody had to make him see sense.
Tony opened his mouth, probably to say something crazily suicidal like
Steve contemplated this mystery woman, weighing the variables of trusting a stranger he only knew through the vague impressions of an orphaned child and Tony’s trusted father-figure.
He wanted to trust Tony, but he couldn’t be sure of where he stood on the Jewish problem. Sympathizing with an eccentric old soldier like Steve was one thing, Jews were entirely another.
“Long ago, there was a young woman whose name was Sara. She was born into a roma tribe called the Lăutari
He smirked and Steve raised his glass. “Fuck you, Buck”
“That’s exactly why it should be me,” Péter insisted, narrowing his eyes at Tony. “You know more about medicine and if I don’t make it back, Tony they need you more than they need me.”
“I don’t know Tony, you are – “
Who she wanted to fight was harder to distinguish as the threats multiplied and the faces of her enemies melded together with friends and her own reflection. She wanted to fight them all. Everyone and anything that threatened her and her family.
"And why would I do that?" Steve grinned, snatching Tony's hand back and placing it back on his chest, right over the spot where his heart beat so strongly. Tony's fingers splayed out over his heated skin and Steve felt his lashes lower, the ache in his body giving way to a sleepy contentment.
Fascinated Tony turned to the pictures. Most of them where formal photos, depicting the different divisions Captain Rogers had served in. Tony peered closer looking for Rogers among them. He’d heard so many stories about the man since the Great War - about how he’d joined the army a sickly youth and grown into the exploits and stature of a modern Hercules - that he was halfway expecting his younger self to be all of three feet tall. While it was true that the young soldier near the far right of the lineup was indeed small he was not as small as legend would have you believe.
He never should have left. He realized that now. Saw the selfishness of his actions. The pointlessness of trading family for a taste of vengeance. For an ideal.
"I sent them to use the toilets before we go. I should have known to remind them not to dawdle," the baroness replied with an easy laugh, but he could see the worry she was trying to hide in her eyes.
“Franz, please.” she repeated, and her brother whirled on her, one finger jabbing viciously in Steve’s direction as he shouted. “You know who that is! You’ll kill the entire family!”
“Oh yes, they’re swell Frau Hogan.” Péter hurried to agree with a brave smile and Pepper shook her head at them, a small smile tugging at her mouth as she straightened her back and banished the cloud that had settled over them.
"That's just how Stefen is.” Bucky vehemently snarled, fingers digging into Tony's arm. “Now, where the hell did you get that key?!”
He was holding Tony too tightly, though Tony didn’t protest. He did jerk back with a hiss of pain when Steve shifted, inadvertently rolling his forehead against the swollen tissue around his cut.
"You left half your plate at breakfast too." Natacha added dryly and Stefen pinned her with a hard look (because she certainly knew what she was doing) before twisting his face into a smile that felt plastic.
His heart fractured, Tony gestured sadly with his free hands for the group to come to him and the children circled around him, pressing close.
"Péter, your face!" Artur gasped, halting the game of skipping rocks he'd been playing with James when he caught sight of his older brother.
(German) Long live Austria.
The words to the old love song drifted up from his memory as If Peggy were right there beside Tony at the piano, their voices blending together in his head, singing the song of parting lovers.
“Need their sleep.” Tony interjected, squeezing his hand encouragingly. “Take a breath Stefen. There’s no reason to charge in there like bulls. We’ll go slow and steady and you’ll be glad you didn’t wake them unnecessarily when you see that they are fine where you left them.”
Péter rolled his eyes, mouth twitching into a grin.
“The Captain should be careful who he disagrees with.” Harry warned as thunder rumbled distantly. “Austria was just the beginning, Pete. The Führer has promised to unite all German peoples and he won’t be stopped. They are going to train us. They’ve promised the best of us positions in the SS.”
“-Tony!”
“s’ too Loud!” she berated before sticking her hand in her mouth to suck, fierce scowl still in place.
Tony whipped his head up just in time to catch the faint smile on Stefen’s face. Something eased in his gut at the sight and he smirked back, feigning mock dismay.
There followed a hissed hushing from the right again and several heads looked their way, fearful attention drawn. Steve’s sharp eyes roved down the row of bunks, but no one owned up to the sound, most preferring to ignore anything but their own misery now that it was silent again.
"I'll have you sacked for this Stark!" Hammer was thundering as the doors burst open and Tony bustled inside the dining room. Whatever smile had been on Steve's face at that point bled away at the sight of the two teenagers that Tony was practically dragging along behind him, Hammer hot on their heels and red faced with fury.
His fingers itched for more paper. He could draw the whole thing now, the whole blue and gold kingdom under the shimmering water. He could pack up his things and walk out of here, catch a train home to Salzburg and gather the children. With the Abwehr covering his absence as part of a classified training operation he didn’t need to be anywhere or explain himself to anyone. By the time the dust settled from the coup he’d be long gone.
Tony sighed, half tempted to wait it out and force Ian to use his words. When he glanced down once more and was met with round pleading blue eyes that would have put an entire crate of puppies to shame he relented.
His throat spasmed and ached around the aborted laughter and he coughed violently. Only a crazy person would free a deranged man they were alone with. She was lying, but Steve could pretend to fall for it if it got her close enough. He shuffled to his knees with a pitiful groan, rocking back onto his toes. Come closer, one step closer he silently begged her.
“I’d burn it if I were you Pete,” he heard Harry say, and saw the way Péter’s shoulders drew up tight. “That girl was trouble.”
“Boss!” There was a crash somewhere and then Steve was staring up at Harold from the floor, his head pounding in time with his ricocheting heart. His gut twisted violently like his insides were trying to come out. Everything inside him was going to come out, he thought with growing terror as the painful twisting worsened.
“This is all so horrible. Where were the police?” the professor wondered aloud. Around. Tony thought in answer but kept his silence.
“Like a sail boat?”
Fear jolting through him, Steve wrenched his body up, dislodging poor Patroche in the process. The goat bleated in distress, but Steve couldn’t spare him a glance because the voices were getting closer. He staggered, tripping over his blanket and cursed, just barely catching himself on the side of the pen. No time to run he realized almost too late. Cover, he had to find cover. Thinking franticly, he dropped down, squeezing his body into the corner of the pen and yanked the blanket over himself like a child.
’ even listening with half an ear. Instead he watched Tony’s back, keeping his eyes and ears open for danger.
They continued to chat the night away. Tony making leisurely passes at Virginia, cheekily leaning into her side as they spoke, she and Bucky piggy backing stories about the end of the civil war and the things the family had gotten up to.
The children had already finished dinner by the time that Steve and Charlotte made it back to the villa. The pair found them all in the sitting room with Bucky, the television playing a news reel on low while the children played or read quietly around him.
He knew that. But that knowledge was his burden to bear alone.
“Take his coat. Get your things,” Magda prompted him with a firm shake of his shoulder. She waited until his glazed eyes met hers and held, before she stood and rushed to pick up the dropped torch.
“Did I not speak clearly?” Tony’s voice lilted upward in faux surprise. He was slurring only slightly despite a long night of drinking. He looked up, eyes a little too bright but still sharp, and stared directly at Steve with fire in them, repeating himself coldly.
“How dull do you think I am?”
“You’re pushing yourself too hard.”
"I didn't like deceiving you," he admitted with a sigh. “At first you were just another Nazi. Why shouldn’t I give Nik whatever he was looking for? But then I got to know you and… everything changed.”
“Sara has a perfectly good uncle.” he grumbled, wiping at his eyes.
Despite the evidence before his eyes it was a moment before Steve really got it that the children were not in danger. They were not so much screaming as yelling, shrieking yes but with childish enthusiasm. They were singing and laughing... playing.
He gestured for Natacha and the other two to stay and took a deep breath before darting across the few feet of open space between the tree line and the wall of the cabin.
“That’s a nice outfit for brunch Artur, on a boat with Captain Ahab, but it’s not really suitable for having brunch with baronesses.” Tony came to the rescue. He had a similar pair of blue shorts draped over one arm (though they were thankfully longer) and a matching suit jacket hanging off a thin wire hanger. “But I like the color scheme. Let’s try this one.”
He meant to say all of it, but all that came out was, “I’ll be seeing you, Dr. Banner.”
The truck slowed around a curve and Steve coughed viciously, wheezing into his hand. God please stop. Stop soon, it was too tight and dark, he was going to suffocate. Somewhere in the far reaches of his mind he knew he wouldn’t, that he had enough air no matter how stale and sharp it was to breathe. It didn't matter.
When the captain pressed his mouth to Tony’s collar bone, sucking at the skin gently before nipping the flesh, Tony jumped, the contact sending a pleasurable burn through his flesh. As the heat of Stefen’s mouth dragged downwards, closer and closer to where Tony was hard and aching for touch, he felt the captain’s lips curl in a smile. But then his head came back up, but before Tony could vocalize his disappointment Stefen’s tongue flicked one sensitive nipple and his teeth teased at the nub in silent threat. Tony jerked, choking on a whine as pleasure and pain mingled, curling tighter and tighter in his loins as if there were a direct line between the two appendages.
Da looked over his shoulder at him. He was in uniform already. Ian swallowed, even in the low lighting he could see the sheen of sweat on his father’s skin, as if he’d gone for a run.
~*~*~
Steve choked, sensation rushing back upon him like a wave.
“Thank you. A Crustacean in my own lake. I can find anything.” He teased.
And argue they did. Tony didn’t take orders well on a good day, and today was anything but a good day. He wouldn’t stay still, was the problem, and Steve needed to know where he was. It should be obvious why, but Tony was irritable and snappish every time Steve tried to speak with him.
When Niklas finally settled on how to answer he plucked a crisp envelope off of his desk and stood, extending it toward Tony. Tony stared at it suspiciously.
“Tony?” Maria called, fright making her voice thin. “Are we going to go in the water?”
Tony was talking again about going to work for the Germans, ostensibly to help with the resistance. He thought Steve was denying him because he didn’t believe in him, but he was completely wrong. Steve didn’t think he was a child, or only good to be shelfed somewhere. Tony was brave and brilliant and they could do far worse in terms of help. Hell, even just this much Tony had been able to recall could help turn the tides if Steve could get it into Britain’s hands. In truth, he couldn’t think of a better partner in this fight than Tony.
“Not even the friendly informant who offers to iron our clothes in exchange for execution?” Tony snipped, irritable with the anxiety of ever-present danger, and the unknown that waited for them at their destination. “However will we manage?”
Stefen’s gaze narrowed on his mouth, and Tony’s grin widened, his heart beginning to pound in his chest.
"He didn't." Tony interjected. He didn't know why, when every instinct he had told him it was better to be quiet, but he was suddenly tired and fed up with this charade. Tony was not the enemy here.  The enemy was out there and Stefen was going to get hurt if Tony didn’t help him.
Tony rubbed Stefen’s socked foot, trying to tell him without words that he wasn’t alone. Tony understood isolation. “You found a way for you and the people closest to you to survive. You’re a good man, Stefen,” Tony reminded him, moving on to his other leg. It was becoming abundantly clear to him that Stefen no longer believed that to be true. He blamed himself unduly for things outside of his control. The war that had ripped Europe apart and drove his already poor community to the brink of annihilation. And now for the mad man who had taken over the country and sown deadly animosity against so many.
They were so loud in his ears, that they nearly drowned out the frightened scream coming from the children.
After the silence had settled in once more, signaling the conversations death, he shuffled his hand into his breast pocket, where he’d tucked a letter from his wife Helene. He really only used the motion as an excuse to do something with his hands and not focus on the strange anxiety that had crept over him. He’d already answered the letter and to write another before receiving her reply would look obsessive, perhaps even paranoid.
Tony taught them an old school rhyme he’d been taught as a boy, making a game of it at first of who could be the loudest and follow him as closely as he pranced about the hill top, until there was no more thought of laws against music or their father’s disapproval.
When Stefen had trotted over to them, Tony pulled him down by the elbow to sit on the bench beside him, never mind the sweat that covered his chest and arms. The heat thrumming through Stefen’s flushed skin was welcome in the cool air, but Tony nudged the jacket he’d brought toward Stefen insistently all the same.
“It’s alright Buck.”
The girl went suddenly silent and limp as if someone had cut her strings and Tony blinked down at her in shock.
Steve frowned, rejecting all the ideas that came to mind. He had no money besides Tony’s and he couldn’t use that. Tony was already paying for their survival; he shouldn’t have to pay for his own birthday gifts.
, so let’s just toss everything-” noticing Pepper’s glower Tony quickly amended, “that isn’t required by your father that is, not those things surely, but we can toss everything else and design our days around things you’d be interested in learning. So, I’m all ears. What is it you want to learn?”
“Do you trust that Herr Stark is truly as devoted to God as his vows would suggest?”
“This?” Tony effected a deeply wounded tone and Clint’s grin widened. “This is a revolutionary piece of industrial history. Where would I get another? Ersa? I made this when I was nineteen. Sachs was still figuring out how to turn the lights on.”
Small talk.
“Are we ready to get out now?” he asked hopefully. Avoidance worked really well in most situations too. Poseidon reincarnated including. James heard him though and immediately began to protest.
Stupid. He’d been sick before. He could do it again.
The children in question looked at each other uncertainly but Tony could see the idea taking root. Péter shifted forward in his seat, giving Tony more attention than he had in the last twenty four hours alone. This was good. He could work with this.
“Would you have listened to anything else I said? We wouldn’t be here now.”
Bucky had not heard Steve crying out until he'd been about to strangle Stark to death. So how had Stark heard him before he did? It didn’t sit right.
When asked to dress for their outing she’d primly informed him that curtains were beneath a proper young woman, especially a future leader in the League of German Girls and Tony had been forced to inform her in reply that she hadn’t been accepted into the BDM yet, and he frankly he wouldn’t give a damn if she were. She could either wear them with grace or stay behind.
“Fuck off,” the man grumbled catching up to sling an arm around Steve’s shoulders. He didn’t flinch this time, laughing instead as Bucky muttered, “we can’t all be built like gods.”
Bedtime was approaching, Virginia had already come to collect Sara for a bath.
“A telegram for you, sir.”
) as quickly as possible.
“A charming bunch of schemers and manipulators.”
“Tacha do you remember when your Baka taught you to dance the Kolo?” he asked and beside her Péter’s face lit with delight. Natacha only nodded but there was no mistaking that she remembered or the wistful expression that passed through her eyes.
-Dachau-
“Come inside. Please.” He entreated around the lump in his throat and Stefen turned slowly, and Tony saw his own helplessness mirrored in the blue of the captain’s eyes, which were overly bright with unshed tears.
When they had four ramshackle tents set up and sleeping rolls at the ready James just couldn’t seem to take it anymore and demanded to know when they could race their boats.
The red coral complemented his coloring, and the flat gold coins were cool and heavy as they settled against his skin, just under his pectorals, right above where his heart was thudding so loudly.
“Good thing he has you then.” his sister muttered darkly and Ian grit his teeth mulishly but didn't rise to the bait.
There were pages and pages of plans. Endless orders for ships and weapons to arm them and detailed designs to fill those orders. Everything was here. Plans for new battleships, submarines, aircraft carriers and at least seven new types of torpedoes that Tony could spot. He could also spot the mistakes, with barely more than a glance.
“You’re the runner?”  Tony guessed with a frown of worry. Clinton was still a child, but the Nazis wouldn’t hesitate to harm him.
Natacha sent him a sharp look and Péter resisted the urge to roll his eyes, his stomach already sinking into the ground.
to bite him. It was all too much.
“Who says there’s a second thing?”
“Is it broken do you think?” The officer asked and Tony swallowed back a curse.
“Artur, I have-”
"You're actually going to let me in. I thought this place was off limits?" Tony commented as they reached the door and Farkas pinned him with his good eyes. "Not off limits, just did my best to keep it Stark free. A man needs to find his sanctuary somewhere."
"It appears that the man they were sent to stay with proved to be a black hearted lout. The children have wisely run away from him. I was in the garden when I saw them at the gate. They must have walked all the way back from Voggenberg."
The loss of Tony felt so damning, so final, like a wicked game played against his senses –
"My compassion for your children Captain is all that keeps me chained to my post," Tony replied sweetly.
Stefen was unraveling. Panted curses and gasps filled Tony’s ears as Stefen’s whole body shook beneath his hands. Those little thrusts of his quickly turning erratic as his fumbling hands came to rest in Tony’s hair, fingers grasping desperately at the dark strands until Tony’s eyes stung.
“Come on Stevie!”
Some would call the islands with their bustling industry packed to the brim with their warehouses and their shipyards a blemish on the land, but there was something wonderful about the smoke and the rust set against the blue of sky and water, that set his heart to thumping as the cab traveled down a busy dock toward a square building that sat squat like a frog at the edge of a pond.
He didn’t have to, he reminded himself.
“That takes us out of it doesn’t it?” Bucky pointed out with a sneer, crossing his arms over his chest and arching a challenging eyebrow in Coulson’s direction.
“I’m sorry,” Tony barked a laugh. “Were you missing in action when we met? A man without an opinion, your father is not.”
f German Girls’.
"That's the second time they've come asking after the Captain." Herr Hammer's voice whispered through the crack beneath the window and Natacha pressed her ear closer, ignoring the scratch of the wood against her cheek and the cold seeping through her coat.
Stefen breathed out a harsh breath and pushed his chair back abruptly and wordlessly strode from the room. Charlotte kept the smile fixed on her face and reached for her coffee, content as she could be with the way things had ended. Stefen hadn’t contradicted her and that was all that mattered.
Breathe in. Breathe out.
Natacha wasn’t. Not really.
Despite his fears Tony did not find Natacha and the others entangled in some mischief. Outside it was a gorgeous day- and had it been Tony he’d have found some way into mountains of trouble by now- but the five little bodies all drifting aimlessly through the courtyard were such a despondent sight that any irritation Tony had felt marching to find them, quickly dissipated.
"Zigeuner. Gypsy boy." Stefen huffed after a long moment, something hateful in the sound that made Tony wince. "Do you know why I joined the army Tony?"
He drifted, the hand that had been exploring Tony’s back now trickling through the sleep worn waves of his hair.
Péter grit his teeth and but kept silent.
“Ian?”
“Where were you?”
"Wanda has always seen the world differently. It's worse now since Dachau. The doctors there wanted to study us and Papa couldn't always stop them."
James opened his mouth in indignation.
Tony intervened, pulling Artur off of his older brother with a scold ready at the tip of his tongue. “Hey! Alright that’s quite –” Only for James to lunge up at him from the floor and sink his teeth into Tony’s arm like a furious cat, bruised face scrunched up in fury.
Tony arched an eyebrow waiting for Stefen to get to whatever was so urgent he’d felt the need to drag him up the stairs.
“It’s a horrible waste. Hugo was a good friend.” Luzzato mumbled mournfully under his breath as the exhausted group made their way down the beach, unapproached by the few men they encountered along the way. They were on the outer edge of the city, near the parkland, where the quarry stones were covered in lush flora and palm trees. Over the tree tops at higher elevation, he could see the rooftops of a cluster of residential buildings. The boats that were tied here looked like leisure vessels. Steve doubted they had seen use in months with the men at war. He wondered briefly who Hugo had been, whether he had a family somewhere who would have to be told. Did they know he had given his life to smuggle Jews into France? Would they be proud if they knew, or horrified?
Stefen caught his hand, gripping it tightly, startling Tony for a moment.
Ian suppressed a ping of guilt. He wasn't keeping his promise. He should have made sure James was getting ready too. James had been so stroppy, ever since father had left to be with the men before the big ceremony. His mood had gone south even more so yesterday morning when Uncle Bucky had swanned in at breakfast with his suitcase in toe.
“Oh, I bet you have. So that’s it then, you’re just going to fly the coop?”
After a time, she lifted her head and looked at him again.
It was at that moment that he heard the sound of an indignant squawk, an aborted yelp and a painful sounding thud and his eyes flew to the window which remained open to let in the early afternoon breeze.  There was some commotion outside, and fearing that Péter had been hurt by once again climbing up the side of the house Tony rushed to the window. The sight that met him was so far from what he expected that he could only stare incredulously as Clinton rubbed his skull and glared balefully up at Natacha whose feet he was inelegantly sprawled at.
Steve’s whole body went cold. There was an intense pressure on his wrist. He looked down and realized detachedly that his hands were clenched into fists, the nails biting into his palms, and that Tony was holding him with a vise like grip.
Artur looked to Tony imploringly and Tony stared back at him in bafflement.
“I should have seen that he was struggling.” He confessed, his eyes searching Tony’s for the condemnation he knew he deserved but he was met with rich warm brown orbs, so heartbreakingly gentle that Steve wanted to hide from them. But he couldn’t bring himself to look away.
Tony had made them translate this poem once, a new verse every three days. It was very long but Ian didn’t mind because he had trouble with English and needed the practice.
Try as he might to keep it at bay it was changing them all and not for the better.
“Stark,” Bucky drew in a wheezing breath and closed his eyes. “That’s- I mean...you know what I mean.” he finished softly.
Despite every effort on his part to hurry the meeting along his morning in parliament had dragged. There wasn’t much he could do to keep the meeting from dragging once Vice President Volstag broached the subject ofGauleiter Globocnik’s war against the church and the responding criticism coming from the Vatican as well as the English government.
“So that’s it huh? That’s why you’ve been so different lately.” Bucky laughed and it was an ugly sound. “You’re still just going to throw away your life and force us to watch? Jesus Christ Stefen you’re a selfish bastard.”
~*~*~
jerking forward as Tony closed his mouth around the head of his cock. The unplanned motion pushes the thick length past his lips and into the back of his throat. Tony gagged, but gripped Stefen’s thighs tight swallowing him down again with gusto – unperturbed by the discomfort when the captain’s every hitched breath and aborted thrust was sending heat pooling down into his belly. Tony was so hard he thought he might burst, but he couldn’t even think about his own cock. Not when Stefen’s was a warm weight in his mouth.
"This is the last street," Péter announced with some relief as they reached the end of their route. It was a short little avenue with a couple of restaurants and a flower shop. A car honked somewhere up the road and they both jumped, Rogue's hand clutching his arm momentarily before the return of silence on the street. Péter slumped with relief when there was no further noise and no sound of an approaching car and Rogue giggled breathlessly.
Themen was just as Steve remembered it, the green paint on the door was still peeling and the silver bell still tinkled just the same way as they entered – so much so that a chill passed down Steve’s spine and for a moment the woman standing in front of the counter talking to Susann could only have been his Margrit, in one of those fashionable suites she liked (that her mother called mannish) and any minute now she was going to turn around in her bright red hat, and her precisely painted lips were going to spread into an exasperated smile because –
Father scooped up Artur and braced himself against James’s tackle. Now that Ian was closer he could see how pale he was.
“Relax Stevie you look as twitchy as a hare.” Bucky mumbled out of the side of his mouth as he sidled up to the bar. Steve tore his eyes away from the door of the hotel bar, gritting his teeth in irritation as Bucky ordered a drink, still pretending not to know him.
They had called it a night when Steve had knocked over the bottle. There hadn’t been much left in it but Virginia and Harold, who had joined them some time after Virginia had, had finally suggested the two of them turn in.
“Gypsies parked outside the city to winter around the same time the murders started. Altera thinks they are using their women to lure the men to be robbed and killed.” Grig was answering his mother when he was interrupted by the surprisingly loud sound of Natacha’s spoon falling from her hand and bouncing off the rim of her plate. The sound jarred Steve out of his dark contemplation.
Rogers certainly looked better this morning (less green around the gills) but he still held himself stiffly as if pained. Maybe that was just the way he was, Tony mused, constantly tortured by an invisible rod up the rear.
And neither would they, Tony knew, as the silence stretched awkwardly in the face of his show of meekness.
“My father, Dr. Leshnerr is a good man. He studies genetic mutations. My mother knew he was right the moment she saw him. Many people chase the caravans away or set the police on them, but my father showed them kindness and offered them space on his land in the woods of Aue. When he and Mama fell in love it was decided that their union was clean. It helped I think, that there was no one yet who could take Mama’s place. My brother and I were born in summer and for many years everyone was very happy."
Steve had never been good at begging, forgiveness or otherwise.
"Such as?" She asked, and Deiter answered, annoyed with how flustered she made him. His brother had always been better with women. "Arming the men. The better armed they are they better off they'll be when it comes time to fight."
Steve closed his eyes with a shudder. He never should have let Tony go. He was alone to face the terrors behind his eyes and the possibility of Tony and Bucky both being dead haunted him endlessly. The awful thought kept eating at his mind that he was to blame if Tony was dead. What sort of man was he to send his lover into harm’s way? Bad enough sending his best friend to do his dirty work, but at least Bucky was a soldier. Tony wasn’t. Steve should have protected him better.
“…my letter! You didn’t answer…”
Peter was very quiet on the way to the station the morning he was to depart for Switzerland. The quiet was an unwelcome contrast to the chaos of that morning full of its goodbyes and last-minute tantrums on behalf of James – it was like James thought that Peter would hear his bad-tempered screaming and just up and decide not to go.
With a sigh he knelt down, resting his weight on his heels and considered the mess of a man before him. He’d never understood how Stefen could trust someone like Dvorak, who openly hated them, whose views were closer in line with the Nazi’s than with their own.
Stefen gave him a suspicious look and Tony grinned because he'd always liked clever people. Not that it mattered. Stefen was too polite to risk offending his memories.
name.
“I didn’t know how to attach them,” she said as she handed them over, moving to give him space and reaching inside the chest for the second pump. And Tony quickly showed her how.
“It’s not too late.” Tony assured him, slowly closing the distance that had gapped between them once more. “I wrote to an academy in Switzerland about Péter, and together I’m sure we can come up with a plan for the others.”
Bucky pushed away from the door and wordlessly stepped into Tony’s space, handing over his pistol even as he used his bulkier frame to edge Tony away from the steering wheel.
“You know what they’re saying don’t you? That the reason the execution was held off – they’re saying the Lion escaped. That is why all these police are out here looking for vagrants and runaways.”
He’d pass it off as the captain simply not wishing to ruin his super but he’d shared enough meals with the man now to know that he hardly ate then either. There were many things that could take away a man’s appetite, Tony knew, but he couldn’t help but flash back to that night in the captain’s room- see the wild white of his eyes and his shaking limbs again.
“Are you going to Berlin as well?" she asked conversationally after they’d both sipped their drinks for a moment.
he'd told Natacha, and she had wrapped her arms around all of them, forcing them to skootch together into a tight hug. They'd clung to her, even James.
my explosive. Overnight, you’ll be the strongest weapons developer in the world let alone the Third Reich. I’ll even sign over the company to you. You’ll have it all, and no one can ever take it from you.”
"Only the children? You know Cap there were a few moments there, you almost convinced me you were enjoying yourself too." Tony quipped and the captain’s mouth twitched again. He crossed his arms behind his back in a distinctly military fashion and turned to face the path ahead of them once more.
“-nicely. It's a hard world James and sometimes you bump things that are harder. With your face.”
"On my way back. All the rails have been clogged since the riot," he snapped back in reply and Natacha nodded solemnly, as if conceding the point, but her reply was still barbed.
But to his surprise the meal was pleasant and Thor’s questions, when he asked them, were non-invasive. He had a solid grasp on the military history of not just his own people but his neighbors and the major powers of the world and a keen interest in battle strategy. It made Steve hopeful for their private talk and reaffirmed the notion that he had that Thor was a warrior at heart who would always prefer battlefields to ballrooms. It was easy to like a man like that and in a different life where Steve survived the war, he could have seen them being friends.
Seven children, by all the saints, Rogers was a virile beast wasn’t he? Though it was perhaps best not to dwell on that given the man’s political affiliations and corresponding doses of extra dislike for things considered amoral (that others might have been more forgiving of in better times). Tony could not count on a man like Rogers to look the other way if he suspected there was something deviant about Tony, sexual or otherwise.
“I for one agree with you Chavo. The more bosom the better. It’s good for singing,” he teased. James looked awed, obviously taking Bucky’s words for gospel, and Steve rolled his eyes towards the ceiling.
“The minister spoke about it at dinner not an hour ago.” Striker explained, eyes narrowing on him. “What do you mean –”
Jann told him where to find the car she’d brought him and Bucky thanked her. The roads would be riskier, but time was everything now. He had to find Steve before the SS did. Before she said goodbye Jann let him know where to reach her next if he needed her again. There was always the tailor’s shop, but it took time for messages to circulate through the network and a direct line when they could secure one could be the difference between life and death.
“Please don't be sad.”
Tony shuddered.
Smiling to himself Tony flipped the dial on the radio, static fuzzing in and out until he found a new channel, still relishing the fact that he could. Radio’s had been banned at the abbey as Niklas had felt the brothers stood a better chance of staying out of German prison camps if they were left somewhat ignorant to the outside world (and of his own political activities no doubt). But of course none of them were stupid men, and news reached the abbey through the mouths of strangers and visitors passing through or the occasionally smuggled newspaper.
“You have her look; we can be thankful for that. The Von Trapps are an old, noble, family. How are your grandparents my dear?”
“You did it for me.” Steve reminded them both, his hands already settling on Tony’s hips once more as he slid further down the bed until Tony’s thighs bracketed him on either side, Tony’s knees tucked under his arms.  Tony fell forward, until he could rest his hands upon the headboard, gripping it hard as he struggled for patience. Steve’s mouth was tantalizingly close to his throbbing cock, his warm breath coasting over his most sensitive skin sending shudders up and down his body.
Knowing him, he’d probably want to call a halt to the whole trip and if Stefen thought Tony was going to let a minor incident like a child getting himself into a bit of hot water – it was
It wasn’t her fault that when he pictured his family it included a fast-talking eccentric monk and not her fair face.
“Well, according to him you’d have to have been born in Italy smelling like the giglio and blessed by the virgin to make espresso the way it
Tony's mouth tasted like ash every time he thought about the dangerous possibilities. He didn't know how Stefen had lived under this debilitating weight of fear for so long.  He cringed now thinking back to what a judgmental prick he'd been about Stefen’s protective tendencies when he first arrived at the villa.
“History proves otherwise, Stark.”
Bucky swung around, over balancing and sloshing his drink a little in the process. Damn. He looked down at the stain blossoming on his suit jacket and snarled at it. How dare it look like a wound. Fuck now he looked like one of those pictures in Steve’s poetry books. That was just not on. Damn pathetic. He threw back his head laughed before he looked back up at Charlotte, whose face was a mask as she stared at him.
“Tomorrow I – ” he began but Tony caught him mid-sentence, one hand on his back the other sliding down his chest as he pushed, until Steve had no choice but to lay on his back once more.
“Be reasonable man. If we have to establish a government in Czechoslovakia we’ll need the people’s full support. These are delicate matters.” Striker responded, his lips curling into a smile as he blew out a puff of smoke. “We cannot afford a national divide. I don’t need to explain all this to you, Göring.”
to do dirty things for you.”
"No."
“Thank you.”
"I'll make sure the children understand not to go spreading tales about them. I presume you and Bakhuizen will be working on a way to get them to safety?" Tony asked, smirking at Stefen's hesitant pause before rolling his eyes once more and saying with a low chuckle, "That was the easy part Stefen. He's better at hiding his thoughts than you but it matters little, when I can't imagine a world where he wouldn't jaunt into the mouth of hell after you, the fool."
“Where did your father tell you that you were going?” The man in the suit asked James. James shrugged, staring mulishly down at his shoes. It was easier to keep glaring if he looked at his shoes. He didn’t want to look at the man in the suit or the man with the gun who blocked the door.
Steve stared up at Tony and Tony stared back, his face coming closer as he shushed the babble that was pouring out of Steve’s mouth, his grip holding iron tight but his thumbs leaving soft, purposeful trails against Steve’s skin like someone molding clay. Steve trembled and above him Tony breathed heavily, his voice raw and thick as he rasped, “Alright. You’re alright, Stefen. I’ve got you.”
“If word of this comes to light you will cause an international incident Brother” Loki warned direly and Bucky snorted muttering beneath his breath.
“I want to tell you a story.” He began. “But this is not a story you can tell anyone else. Not yet. It isn’t safe. I’m trusting you both because I know you’re old enough to understand that. One day, when it’s safe I want you to tell the others.”
“No, I want to learn French” she repeated and, yes, there it was the clenching of the jaw, right on cue (although her version of it had her chin tilted up and lips pressed).
He was good with his hands, he could find work outside of the military. He could.
“Bucky.” Feeling their gazes Steve nodded a greeting to Bucky and then in the direction of the monk. “Stark.”
Stefen looked deep in conversation with some general so and so and a gaggle or prominent officials and hadn't so much as glanced back at the table where Tony was keeping an eye on his youngest children. Had they been at home, Tony would have done as Jarvis had always done for him and taken the children up to bed himself and have done with it, only he wouldn’t have pretended afterward like it had been the captain’s idea all along. No he would certainly not! And if that’s what Stefen thought he was, the
Pepper stilled, her brow furrowing deeply in thought. “They’ve given other children who’ve turned on their parents to new guardians. Perhaps they’ll do that this time too?”
~*~*~~*~*~
But she’s already late. How long do they expect us to wait?
“I wish it was different Stefen I really do. If it were, I’d have let you go on thinking I was dumb as a rock. I’d have never said a word about you making eyes at your monk and let you fuck him and anyone else if that’s what brought you back to us. But there’s too much at stake. You’ve got to marry Charlotte and you’re going to mess that up if you aren’t careful.”
“It’s fine. It won’t be necessary, thank you,” Tony insisted stiffly.
Stefen fell quiet with a swallow, gaze shifting away from Tony’s once more as he wrestled with the emotions telling the story behind the coins had brought up. Tony’s heart ached for him, and this time he was the one to offer his thanks, in the form of leaning close to press his lips against the soft skin at Stefen’s temple. He knew how difficult it was for the captain to talk about the people he’d loved and lost, and he couldn’t fathom what these little gold discs must mean to him. Which was honestly why the gift still boggled him. Why? Why on earth would Stefen part with something so meaningful?
Artur will be quite disappointed we’ll have to postpone our field lesson to see your highly praised hives. We are going to make our own protective clothing. Any tips you can provide on the latter is appreciated.
James struggled forward and his voice, to Tony's surprise, wavered with frustrated tears.
Would I have to find them alone,
Obadiah wasn’t quick enough to hide the genuine surprise that flashed over his features.
Get up! Even if they were dead, he had to find them. He was their father! He had to get to them and save them... They were gone. Stop it! Move. When he could move, he’d go back down the mountain, he would...he would…
, let it all go.
That got Steve’s attention.
, when a shriek of delight (in Sara’s dulcet tones) erupted in the living room and the jaunty tune that Bakhuizen was plying out of his strings kicked up a notch into something down right joyous.
Tony stumbled over the word hurt, unable to bring himself to voice the fear sitting heavy in his gut. Dead. He thought it but couldn’t say it. Péter might be dead.
“Did Father tell you that they’re making me a group leader?” She asked, after a long moment of quiet and Bucky tensed, throat going tight.
Tony hadn't been seriously drunk in a long time, but after leaving Péter and the others he’d felt a thirst the likes he hadn’t felt since his first year at the monastery.
“Are you feeling alright, dear?” She questioned his uncharacteristic lack of chatter, running her fingers over his forehead and pushing back his fringe. He wasn’t hot to the touch, but Stefen had told her about his recent bout of sickness in Vienna.  One never could be too careful.
This room like the last was in perfect order, clean and preserved. Tony's fingers itched to take it all apart and see where the pieces fell. He stepped inside, careful to keep his steps light. The room - a music room, he thought - had far less of the ornate grandness of the entry and the differences didn’t stop there. This room seemed like a home. An untouched home but a home none the less.
He had a penchant for cigar smoking that his wife couldn’t stomach but had suffered bouts of insomnia ever since he’d been young. Smoking calmed Ludy, so he was in the habit of cracking open the bedroom window when it was warm enough not to bother the wife and leaning out to have his smoke.
“Must you insist on doing that?” Tony snapped.
Without waiting, Tony began making his way toward Bruce, Clint following closely at his heels.
The call came in the morning. The children’s regular morning exercises had turned into a duel lesson in breath control and chest notes, so that by the time Tony herded them back inside to wash up for morning lessons they were red faced but bright eyed with exertion.
Ian plopped Stefens bag of “extra” materials down next to him and eye’d his father and James warily while Tony and Bakhuizen set up the cans, Bakhuizen keeping oddly quiet. They had only brought two guns and copious amounts of ammo, Tony noticed, filing the information away. He more than intent on prying the reason for all of this from Stefen at a later date; because there was something going on here.
“Ah… sorry about that. We didn’t know they could be poisonous.” The boy’s face shifted into a hard expression, his brown eyes glinting with challenge as he asked, “You aren’t going to tell Father about them are you?”
So, Stefen had not been forthcoming about his impending nuptials. Had he even told his children yet? Was Tony really so selfish that he expected the man to tell him his plans before he'd even spoken to his own children?
“Tony I –”
“I’m not a baby!” Artur immediately snapped back. It would probably have been more convincing had he not had to take his fingers out of his mouth to do it.
It's time to say goodbye
“Sing for me.”
“Bucky please,” he implored, searching his friends face for any sign of relent. He didn’t expect Bucky to understand, but he need his support just the same. He couldn’t do this without him.
"Leave by the river.” The Tony declared, the solution coming to him with sudden clarity. He could see it all now. “They won't expect it. Even if they do they'll be on foot. You'll have a head start, the best engine I can make you and you won’t be leaving a trail they can easily follow."
She nodded. Slowly withdrawing her hand from his and rubbing it against her chest. He hoped it was to warm it from the chill of exposure, but suspected it had more to do with his grip.
For a moment it was Schmidt smirking down at him as the striped clothes hit his face. But when he grasped the garments with shaking hands and blinked hard, he recognized the clothing as the same warm winter trousers he’d first seen her in.
“Let me guess, drive the fever up? Not a bad idea, where bacterial infections are involved, but that man does not have scarlet fever! And without knowing the true cause for his symptoms, the only thing we’re for sure accomplishing here is dehydrating him at a critical hour.”
“Fair point.” Tony sighed, shutting the door with a quiet click behind him. “Though I’d be remiss if I didn’t point out the fatal flaw in your logic.”
The Stark empire might be dust here in Pola, but another war machine had been born from its ashes. And when this one fell, another would come. Another and another, until something stong enough came along to break the cycle of changing powers.
And then.
Steve repeated this again and again. He whispered it into his arms at night, using it to block out the pain, as well as the moans from the other prisoners. It was the only thing keeping him sane. Tony’s brown eyes staring up at him, simultaneously begging and demanding Steve to understand. To see the end that was coming for them.
Mo phral pi - Drink brother!
There wasn't need for much talk as their eyes roved over the prints. Soren seemed most fascinated by the ones from Péter's recent adventures: his friends in their HJ uniforms, a beautiful girl with red lips and grit in her smile, pictures of farmers and their farms, railroad tracks and the trains carrying cars loaded with people to destinations unknown; but Péter and Tony were engrossed in the delightful discovery that the roll of film had not been empty when Stefen had fished the kodak out of the attic to gift it to him.
“Oh Christ, you are a marvel,” Tony panted one hand falling from the headboard to thread through Steve’s hair as he slowly inched his way down the length of Tony’s cock. Tony could feel every spasm as his throat adjusted to the slow intrusion, even the way Steve’s mouth twisted with discomfort. He pulled on Steve’s hair, an unspoken suggestion to pull back, but there was a methodical determination to the way he held on with all his strength and worked to take one inch after the other. Pulling back suddenly when he needed to breath and diving back in almost before he’d taken a full breath.
“If I collect my share of the trust fund how much is left?” Tony asked, getting down to the heart of things.
They weren't hunting for food. The women were loud enough to scare away any bird with half a brain. Not to mention his aunt had a laugh that could be heard through the mountains. Not work. Not hunting. Play. It took him back to playing with smooth beads while his mother nursed him, fat baby fingers turning over silvery coins and rolling cool beads between them, again and again.
“Come on, come on, I know you're all clever little foxes and the material is boring you to tears. It’s boring
"But you've got to." Bucky countered with a snap, waving the card with the message from their contact at Dachau. "They’re going to be executed! We promised Susann and Jessika we’d rescue them!”
Steve didn't move for two days. He slept in deep dreamless spurts, with little recollection of the in-between moments. The woman had come back with another ratty blanket to keep the draft at bay, but nothing could keep the chill from seeping into Steve’s bones. It was cold in the barn even with blankets and hay, and it seemed that as soon as the rush from immediate danger was gone, his body gave in to its wounds. He knew he had to leave, but the woman had been right. Even with two days of sleep he was in no condition to walk out of the barn on his own steam.
Zimmerman made a face, blinking rapidly behind his glasses, as if he’d been swatted in the face.
“But that’s just the point Willamina, they’re not Czechs, they are ethnically German same as you and I! Could you imagine languishing in some Czechoslovakian slum?” Hammer implored the woman’s back as she banged about making herself a cup.
The captain's study was equally sparse, but it wasn't colder for it. The lack of heavy furnishings made the small room seem open and spacious and Tony could imagine that the light when daylight spilled in from the large windows reached every corner of the room. Late at night the view of the back gardens and the lake beyond under a starlit sky was a painter’s dream.
"Uncle Bucky!" several voices cried out at once. James leaped up from his seat, toppling his chair over as he rushed to hug the weary looking man around the knees, clinging like a barnacle. Ian quietly righted the fallen chair and then joined his siblings as they gathered around their uncle.
Tony chuckled into his drink, though for the maid's sake he tried to quiet the sound. The girl flushed a vibrant red but wisely scurried to be rid of the ruined loaves and ran into the pantry to fetch the supplies to begin a new batch. Willamina, standing over the stove with hands fisted on curvaceous hips glowered in Tony's direction.
Pepper, helping Artur to cut his food, watched him, her eyes following Tony about the room. Still sensing James’ glare on his back Tony winked at her and cleared his throat.
The next day Tony and the children had been busy practicing, having only a few hours to get together the program they would perform and to calm their nerves. This was only the second time they’d performed in public and unlike at the Officer’s ball, Tony knew that there would be hundreds crowding the fairgrounds. He’d gotten them dressed in their uniforms and then they’d all piled into the back of the car they’d be using to join the parade line.
"Better you don't know that. We could still be caught."
Natacha blinked slowly, allowing the tears to sting her eyes again. If she couldn’t stop them, she may as well use them. Crying girls made men look the other way.
Ian shut his eyes hard.
“Artur didn't do anything!”
Ian and the other boys were outside now, repeating some experiment they’d performed with Tony. Something about testing for mercury in the water. Steve had already checked on them twice, stalking the grounds until he found them with their heads bent together by the garage. Tools and papers spread out over the same well-worn table they’d built racing boats on.
Don’t, Bucky had warned, and he hadn’t meant to.
He was such a baby to be scared like this. But he’d always had Peter before. When Baka died, and then Mama… when Da became a stranger and looked at them like he hardly recognized them, Peter was still there. Coming up with schemes to torture their governesses and get their father’s attention and bossing them around but never leaving them alone.
"Willamina Did you -" Hammer had turned back to the cook who'd immediately cut him off.
Susann answered the door after the first knock, wordlessly ushering him inside. Stepping into the small sitting room he stood awkwardly, his hat held between his hands until Susann insisted he take a seat and not to mind the clutter. Her brother Jonny was in town again and she said that between him and her nine-year-old son it was a wonder the place hadn’t fallen down.  Stefen didn’t mind the toys and other nick-knacks spread across the sitting room. It gave the small space a certain kind of intimacy that was missing in the grand homes.
