He stepped to the side to let Sam, who was trying to peek into the room from behind him, get a better view.
How long had Steve been there? Had he dragged himself to the rubble before Tony had opened the box, had he died waiting because Tony had been too slow, too stupid, too scared to finish his job in time?
“I know what I’m gonna do. Gonna kick Captain Asshole’s ass to Wakanda and back when I see him again. But whatever you gotta do, Tones, I have your back. You know I always do.”
But Tony was back and despite all the deaths that covered the compound like a heavy shroud and the sorrow that weighed Steve down, it felt…not like he was home but like he could finally breathe, as though maybe now that they were with each other again, now that Tony was here, they could figure out a path forward together, as lost and damned as they were.
He ripped his gaze from Steve down to the rectangular case. He had to get the Stone out quickly, but they hadn’t planned to use it; all they had wanted to do was hide and protect it, and that meant layers upon layers of safeguards. He knew how to bypass each one, how to disable every trap that they had put in—he was one of the few who did—but it required careful movements and patience.
Tony would stop in his tracks and look his fill, the way he couldn’t any other time, knowing that Steve had been there for a while and that it was because he couldn’t sleep; it took a lot of effort for him to get that drenched with sweat, and he was up before his normal morning hours. He would wonder how his life came to this—knowing all of his teammates’ schedules, even if all of them did their own thing and preferred it that way, like he was a soccer mom with a color-coded calendar in his head—and then he would walk away, leaving Steve at it.
Sam cocked his head at the others, stopping in the doorway before he left. “I’ll save you some food if I don’t see you at dinner,” he said kindly.
And because Tony was Tony until the end, he replied, with as much conviction as Han Solo had, “I know.” He sounded the way he always did when he couldn’t stop smiling. “And you know I love you too. So long, Steve. See you in a century.”
There was a time when he would have believed with all his heart that he could—or would have willed himself to do so—but not anymore.
, he thought because there was nothing else but this, his entire universe, bright and glorious and full of hope, existing just in Tony’s eyes.
To Tony, he had been something that needed to be crushed under the tires of what was necessary on the way to his better, safer future, a loss that was regrettable but unavoidable.
But he knew what Tony meant. Tony had been destined for MIT since they were kids, whereas he hadn’t even been sure if he’d be able to go to college, what with money being tight and his mom sick again. Yet here he was, freshly graduated, summa cum laude, while Tony had stayed behind in this time-frozen town.
“Yeah,” Steve said like that was even an answer, but he was trying to say something else and it was as if he didn’t know how or if it would be welcome. Tony heard it, what followed that one word.
Natasha realizes that Jim is right. Tony always comes back, and the person who saves him has always been Tony himself. This is his signal flare in the desert, an explosion they have to follow.
The compound was as empty and dark as deep space, and Tony was tempted to ask FRIDAY to turn on some lights except he didn’t want to see empty hallways either. The compound was too big for the few who had survived. Had been too big since Steve had gotten most of the kids after the split over the Accords.
“Go!” Steve shouted. He had already turned back, smashing his shield under the jaw of the alien closest to him, concentrating on giving Tony enough time to escape.
“I know. I know you are, but don’t close your eyes. Focus on me.” A ragged gasp tore his lungs open. He couldn’t catch his breath. He was suffocating. “You’re going to be fine. We’re going to…we’re going to get you help. It’ll be okay.”
, he read again. He repeated the words over and over in his head like a mantra, engulfed in happiness of an intensity he had never felt before.
Jim confirms her thoughts. “You get used to it,” he says. “I can’t even remember how many times I almost lost Tony over the past thirty years. He always pulls through no matter what. You never know how he’ll manage to until he does, but he does.”
But he had known this was a possibility. He had spent days—weeks—after Siberia turning the idea in his head like a pebble in his hand over and over, wearing it down, enough that even as part of him caved in with devastation, a bigger part was tired. Angry.
“Yeah? Got any good stories to tell?” Tony sat down on the grass, gesturing at Steve to do the same. “Big ragers, nasty hangovers...” A leaf fell gently into his lap, and his words tapered off. He moved to cradle it in his palms before he looked up at the trees, still mostly in their summer dresses although bursts of red and orange had started to bloom amongst the verdant green. His gaze sharpened as though he were seeing his surroundings for the first time. “It’s too early for you to be back. Why—”
But Steve didn’t look angry. There was no fight in him, only Tony. “Okay,” he said agreeably, and Tony didn’t know what to do with the energy pent up inside him with nowhere to go.
Now, punching the heavy bag and feeling each blow detonate inside of him, defusing every one of his tremors, he felt less like he was going to break free of his body and more like he was collapsing; he was still shivering, but he was weak, all of his bones turned watery.
He hadn’t gone back to that moment because it would have been a useless exercise. It had happened, and he could play with memory through BARF, but he couldn’t alter history. He couldn’t go back in time and prevent Steve from saying his word.
“Okay,” he relented, and despite all the worry gnawing at him, it was a relief to not do this alone like he had for so long. To be a part of something bigger than himself.
To pummel his hands to pulpy shreds, apparently, enough times that he wasn’t surprised by Tony’s injuries or explanation.
They hadn’t had much time to talk after it was over, too busy being treated in medical and then heading out to help with recovery and reconstruction plans all over the country and the world once they got the green light.
“I know.” And whatever they’re talking about, there’s no lie in what Tony says and no false appeasement in what he says next. “I was going to call you.”
Tony scrambled out of the building, tripping over the pillar in his haste. Concrete rushed to meet him and he shot his hand out to break his fall.
He could see Steve’s neat handwriting as if he had the letter in front of him, as if he were looking at his bare arm, the shape of the letters on the page exactly the same as the ones on his wrist.
He never knew the city could be like this. Peaceful despite the battle that had broken out in the early Sunday morning. Beautiful even at its most congested, most hideous heart. It felt like some other place this high up, some place that only belonged to him. His and no one else’s.
The lands shifted below him, tens of thousands of feet away, but this high up where the movement was imperceptible, he was fixed in limbo, white space stretching infinitely in every direction, his thoughts on a numbing loop.
Steve was lying. He was dressed in a plain T-shirt and worn sweatpants, home clothes or PJs, not his workout gear. Tony hated himself for knowing the difference.
He took out ointment from the kit, never once letting go of Tony even if it would have been easier or more logical to do so. He squeezed the tube and swiped the lip, getting the salve on his fingers and then shifting his hold so that he cradled Tony’s hand in both of his. Without looking up, he spread it across sore skin and massaged with care, slowing down when Tony flinched.
, he thought, watching himself in Afghanistan, shaking, sweating, delirious from cold and fear and agony, pretending his soulmate was lying with him on the cot, holding him, reassuring him.
The rush of breath that left Steve like someone had slid a knife between his ribs when they walked past a café in Porto playing it on TV. The missed step as he exhaled. The shattered misery on his face that he used to hide so well until Tony blew apart his defenses in Siberia, mangling everything impossibly out of shape so that he couldn’t weld his walls shut again.
He didn't have to but did, just like Steve didn’t have to wait but decided he would, and Steve thought Tony needed to hear that, to know that what he did wasn’t out of obligation but a love founded on choice. He thought that Tony would understand.
They could have had each other was the thing. But Steve never thought he had a chance with Tony and didn’t even walk up to the starting line, and Tony never thought Steve would want a chance and didn’t even give him one.
He wondered what the words underneath it were, if they were anything that he had said before, anything he had said in the past few days. He wondered if they were happier than his, his words that he had gotten so horribly wrong, that he couldn't bear to look at anymore. He wondered if and when Tony knew whom his words belonged to. If he even had Steve’s words on his skin.
been painful. But he didn’t care that it had been, and he didn’t know how to explain that, his emotions crowding the inside of his ribcage and piling up at the back of his throat, too big to squeeze into words. He settled for just shaking his head.
for Sarah. His mother was still with him, made eternal through the vibranium that had kept his band from rusting during all those years in the ice.
Threads ran out from every inch of him, from his fingernails, his toes, the roots of his hair, every pore on his body. They connected him to everyone and them to him, down every floor of every building, down to the pavement, down below to the subterranean city of tunnels and trains crisscrossing under Manhattan. They were invisible from where he sat, but he could feel them under his skin, thrumming with energy, could feel them move about in their homes and in the city they shared, readying themselves for a new day. They knitted themselves together, became the sinew binding muscle to bone, strengthening and shaping him.
Steve remained in the bathroom with him as he washed his hands gingerly, clamping his mouth shut so that no sound could escape as the water bit them. He could tell Steve to leave. He knew he would go if he said he had it handled. It was just a bad contusion and scraped skin.
With every new Stone in his possession, he grew more powerful, the playing field growing more uneven and unpredictable. The Time Stone had landed in Thanos’s hands despite their best attempts, with Strange barely escaping, and now he was near unstoppable with five out of the six Stones.
Ships fell from the sky, as they had in the first wave, and swarms of alien troops had them all busy. They needed as many reinforcements they could, and Strange and Wong had teleported Thor, Bruce, and what remained of the Guardians to join the fray. The Avengers at the compound were getting ready to head out, the headquarters devolving into organized chaos. Everyone—the Avengers, their allies, and an assortment of military personnel—scurried this way and that, preoccupied with their own preparations and the latest updates pouring in from around the world.
Tony’s touch felt like a mirror memory, a reverse echo of the time he had touched Tony’s chest all those years ago, searching for a sign of life after he had fallen to Earth from space.
Even when stripped of everything that everyone assumed made him Tony Stark but was, in reality, just one side of him, Tony was dazzling, larger than life.
Steve, on the other hand, stands rigidly as though any sudden move will have a butterfly effect that will ripple out and somehow kill Tony.
What came out when he shut off the faucet and dried off his hands with the towel that Steve handed him was this: “You gonna patch me up, Doc?”
To his surprise, Steve smiled warmly at him. “I didn’t fall in love with you because I found out you were my soulmate. That only made me realize what was already there.” He stared straight ahead again, contemplative. “I think…I think I was always drawn to you from the start. But I didn’t even want to think about it because I was so fixated on my soulmate that I refused to even consider anyone else, even you. Only took losing you to realize how stupid I was being.”
She stays put, something solidifying inside her chest, blocking the air from reaching her lungs, while Jim shoots forward to meet him, probably faster than he should with the way his legs are. She can’t do anything so she does what she does best: observe.
Tony wrenched himself from that memory and let himself sink into this one, taking a backseat to his past self. It was like dipping his toes into a cold bath and then fully submerging himself, all the sensations lighting up here and there along his body, his feet transforming into blocks of ice, his soggy, tight jeans clinging to his thighs, before he felt everything, all at once. He was suddenly aware of a dull ache in his arm; it radiated out from his wrist as though a blunt object had slammed down on it.
What had people said? Tony flicked through his memories, throwing boxes down from shelves, rifling through each one and flinging them away until he found something, anything that could possibly help. Steve was his soulmate, surely he could do something for him, something normal people couldn’t because what was the point of being someone’s soulmate if he couldn’t do anything? What was the point of soul marks—
He couldn’t stop the hiss that slipped through between his teeth. Steve didn’t notice, too busy opening a first-aid kit that he had had for some inexplicable reason when he approached Tony at the punching bag.
It was stupid. He knew that Steve wouldn’t hurt him, not like that. Not now, at least, and even back then, Steve had done it to stop him. Because the only clear thought in all the muddled confusion and heartache, the relentless rush of rage howling through his mind, had been to hurt Steve, to pummel him into the ground, to take Barnes away from him so that he would know what it was like to watch his family, watch someone he loved, being hurt in front of him like Tony did.
Steve breaks their gaze, something complicated that Natasha can’t decipher crossing his face but Tony can.
And soulmates or not, Tony loved him even as he had hated and then mourned him, even as he missed him, and in spite of all the anger, all the raw pain that he carried, he didn’t want that for Steve.
He knew that in all likelihood, his soulmate had passed away years ago and that even if they hadn't, he had left them behind, been absent all the years that they had needed him. He knew that some people moved on after their soulmates died, that some settled for others when they figured that they would most likely never find their soulmates.
Steve sucks in a breath, and she zeroes in on him again as she retreats to the safety of her question, on Steve’s emotions rather than her own.
Normalcy for Steve means shedding his suit. It means changing his clothes and cleaning up. Taking a razor to his face and shaving off his beard, shaving off age and guilt and depression and everything else Natasha has seen him carry since the fight over the Accords, because he’s finally home, he can finally rest, he can finally be himself once more.
But he didn’t have to. As though it yearned for nothing more than to join its siblings, the Stone shot into the air, speeding towards the Gauntlet and slotting into the last spot. The Stones glowed, splashing colorful lights against the walls, before fading again.
She doesn’t understand why she asks. Steve faced everything straight on except matters that would force him to reexamine his relationship with Tony or put it in jeopardy. But maybe that said everything.
“Losing him.” A laugh escapes from him, misshapen from the darkness it’s been lying dormant in since Siberia, forgotten, something hideous that shouldn’t have been brought into the light. “I’d go an entire lifetime without ever seeing or talking to him again if it meant that he was here and he was safe.”
He bent forward so that their foreheads touched, bringing Steve’s wrist to his heart with his left hand and putting the Gauntlet on his right, never once letting go.
Tony wasn’t sure if they could ever be friends again or whether he even wanted them to be. Too much mistrust had led to misunderstandings and mistakes, and there were too many times they had wounded each other. It wasn’t clear if this was a continuation of the path they had been on or if it was possible for them to start over. All that was definite was that if there was just one thing he could rely on Steve for without hesitation, it was saving the world, no matter the disagreements and no matter their personal problems.
He didn’t want to remember this. He dug the heels of his palms into his eyes as though that would push the memory back into the recesses of his mind, but he always had a knack for recalling things that he would rather forget. He remembered the way she had tipped his chin up as he leaned away, embarrassed by her words and his reaction to his father’s disapproval.
His uniform, the one he wears when they go out to help nowadays, is his old stealth suit. The dirty, fraying one that he constantly wore on the run even when it was wiser to change outfits as she and Sam did was barely salvageable after the fight with Thanos, not that he’d want to see it anyway. There’s blood and ash on it that won’t come out even when it’s clean.
Tony’s careworn heart skipped a beat and lurched into overdrive, each overtaxed pulse piercing his chest like leftover shrapnel. Everything was too bright, too sharp, and the light cleaved his head in half, jabbing his overly sensitive eyes. Someone said something that resembled his name from close by, but it was muffled as though he were underwater, and he couldn’t tell where it came from.
Tony’s eyes were big and bright with incredulity, as if he were struggling to believe his good fortune.
Their home had cracks. Parts of it had crumbled and caved in. But they had rebuilt it once before, and Tony knew they could do it again.
“I know how he operates,” Loki had said among other things, and Tony had no choice but to hope that despite his misgivings, with Loki and Thanos’s daughters, Gamora and Nebula, protecting one of the most dangerous of the Stones, they could have some control over the timeline of events. Thanos could destroy with ease, obliterate planets with a blasé flick of his hand, but he was still bound by the restrictions of space travel.
Tony’s throat constricted. It took a long while for the tightness to fade before he was able to speak.
The remaining Avengers are all caught in a loop, playing a reel of their friends’ last moments in their heads. They build their dead back up from the mounds only to watch them fall apart until Thor rises out of his stupor and speaks. Slowly, as though awakening from a collapsing dream, everything disintegrating but the single idea occupying his mind, he rasps out the first words after the massacre, cementing the nightmare they’re in as their new reality.
“Early start for you too?” he asked. He rolled the apple between his palms. It was waxy. He had no desire to eat it, the very thought of biting into it unappealing.
True to his word, Steve didn’t act as if he expected something from him over the next few days. They remained friendly, less tense than before but keeping their distance. There was a line drawn in the sand. Here and no farther. Steve stopped being so keyed up, so vigilant about Tony’s every move, now that they had finally talked. He gave Tony space.
Tony batted his eyelashes and adopted an overly humble tone that he knew would erase the worry lines from Rhodey’s face. “Such a flatterer. But I did have some help along the way.”
“So was I,” his soulmate would tell him one day, and what it meant was that they were always with him and always would be, permanent like nothing else in his life was.
It was a while before he spoke, but when he did, he decided to meet Steve halfway and give him what he wanted. Answering Steve’s promise, telling him he knew Steve would keep it, would be useless. Steve wouldn’t believe him, and it would be a long while before he would. But this…this he could give. His nightmares were worthless to him; he had a surfeit of them. But to Steve they would have value, would represent something else—a different form of trust.
His wrist had been too small for his father’s until now. He supposed he could tell Peggy that he already had a band he could use and keep his mother’s for his soulmate, but found himself unwilling to part with one of the last keepsakes he had of his mother. She had seen him through all his hardships; she would carry him through the war.
The warning was there and gone, a feeble flicker that barely stirred him. His worries were so insignificant now. Rejection was easy to deal with and hatred and revulsion, condescension and pity, mattered little when Tony was here, alive. Half the universe was gone, and Tony had somehow made it.
“I thought you’d be the kind of guy to warm things up before prep,” Tony shot off his mouth because never mind what he had thought before; this was too much too fast, and Steve was going to break him down treating him like this until there was nothing left if he didn’t prevent him from doing so.
“Not yet, but this isn’t all on you. Strange said this was the only way and if he saw that, then he saw that the rest of us survived too.” He covered Tony’s shaking hand with his, loosening Tony’s grip on the blanket to slip his fingers under Tony’s palm and hold his hand. “This time, you have us. You’re not doing this alone. We’ll figure it out together.”
“Sounds painful,” Bucky said, wincing, and Steve wanted to blurt out that no, it hadn’t been when it wasn't true. It
“I’ll put in an order for a new one,” Peggy said as she stood by his side, the calm eye of the storm of activity around him. “Is there anything you’d prefer?” Her eyes flicked down to his wrist and back up again as though she couldn’t help it, but her face betrayed no emotion.
“I will.” And because it was the truest thing he knew and because it would be the last time in a long while until he could say it: “I love you.”
“Tony, you have to go,” he said urgently. “Contact Strange and get the last Stone. I’ll hold them off as long as I can.”
“Don’t I know it.” Tony pinched the bridge of his nose, though it did little to alleviate his headache. “Thanks, big guy. Keep us posted and stay safe.”
“I know. It makes me want to cry too, but I guess His Royal Pantherness didn’t find him worthy of super top-secret Wakandan tech. Shame.”
“Could’ve, should’ve, would’ve if we weren’t both idiots. We were a match made in heaven,” Tony said. “Anyway, we had one really good one, right? And years of being friends before that.”
“I didn’t. He showed up and refused to leave. You might be familiar with that particular strategy, 4F.”
Steve skimmed the dark purple bruise under Tony’s eye, then his cheek, and then his neck. Tony’s pulse beat steadily under his fingers where he held him, and Steve finally caved in on himself, unable to hold himself up any longer. He rested his forehead against Tony’s and shut his eyes, falling forward, falling into him.
Up here, the sounds of the streets dropped away, the tumult not entirely muted (and Steve was glad for that, glad of the reminders that the city wasn’t frozen, that he wasn’t frozen) but removed.
The blue woman tenses, her strange eyes narrowing, but ferocity is replaced by surprise and then, as she relaxes almost imperceptibly, a flicker of sad recognition as though she’s seen this before, experienced this before, when Tony unfreezes and wraps his arms around her too, holding her as fiercely as he held Rhodey.
Here was Bryant Park, a small, green postage stamp he could collect in his pocket. Here was the Chrysler Building and its majestic crown, close enough that it was on private display just for him. A little down the way to his side was Times Square, effervescently and unapologetically neon at all hours. And even farther, avenues away, beyond the industrial plainness of the Garment District, the Hudson, the railcar yard. On the street there, or even as far from it as Penn Station, he could see the white wing of a seagull boomeranging through the sky if he looked up, could hear the seagull’s searching call. It brought Brighton Beach to him here in Manhattan when he needed it, when he missed home and the Fourth of July with his mom and the Barnes, Bucky making eyes at Betty or Ruth or the new girl from two streets down, Bucky’s sisters shrieking as they sprinted down the shore, the waves lapping the soles of their feet a shocking reminder of winter.
He took all the pieces he found of Tony scattered everywhere and put them together again, wrapping the bandages around them and around his hands, making sure that the fit was snug enough. It was soothing, the repetitiveness of it, watching the cloth go up and over again, feeling Steve’s hands around his. Tony started to feel more concrete, all his fault lines sealing up, all his nervous energy seeping out of him until he was solid again, until he was himself.
“Earth just lost her best defender,” he said to Ross, to the team, to everyone but the one person who needed to hear it most.
Several of the Chitauri had noticed their noisy arrival and had started to descend on them. Steve held out his shield and Tony blasted it with a repulsor, the beam taking out the closest lines. A few remaining soldiers skittered back, but the majority swarmed in, stepping over the fallen without hesitation.
He should get this over with. He couldn’t avoid him the entire night, but after some warm-up with the worst of the bunch, the people he missed the most and the people who missed him the least, he would have enough practice in being cordial and keeping his emotions in check. And it could well be that Steve was talking to someone else or that he would be too far away to catch his eye.
“No!” Tony held his hand up in protest before slamming it back down on the plates again, catching the knives and forks that had nearly slid off from the force of his emphatic gesture.
“This is Major Tom to Ground Control,” he drawls, and Natasha hates and loves him in equal measure for the morbid joke. She misses that. She misses him.
“Funny, I was about to say the same thing.” Tony sighed. He felt wobbly and deflated. “He’s a good kid. Better than the both of us,” he added after a beat.
Natasha hates seeing her like this. It feels wrong, and it’s unfair—Pepper’s only human, and no one knows how to react to what Thanos did because no one was prepared for it—but Pepper has always been collected even in the midst of chaos, has never been lost the way she is now.
The idea he had was a rash one, a suicide mission with a low probability of success, but it was something. And something was better than nothing.
“I would’ve been late even if you did.” The confession comes out bitter, a knife pointed inwards. “I would’ve lost—” Steve’s voice is hoarse, mangled with regret. “I’m not letting that happen again. Even if you can’t trust me, you have me at your side, Tony. No matter what.”
They weren’t out of the woods yet. They had to gain as much distance as possible from Thanos and the Order, and a few foreboding signs were already flashing on his HUD.
It was one of the things he loved most about Tony; he was the most generous and caring person Steve knew, never hesitating to offer help in any way he could.
Here was something that surprised people, that most people didn’t know unless they were from New York themselves: The city could be quiet.
But Tony wasn’t asking for forgiveness this time, refusing to give either apology or justification. He knew that he had passed the point of no return, not just in what he and the others were doing but also in what Steve would forgive. Arrogance. Self-importance. Cruelty and cowardice parading as martyrdom. No one else could do this. No one else could be allowed. There were no choices. He wouldn’t apologize because of that, Steve thought with a sneer.
The thing about soulmates was that there wasn’t any guarantee that you would meet them. Steve had known that since he was young, had had it drilled into him by his doctor and all the kids at school and in the neighborhood. He had always known that it was possible that he would die before he met his soulmate. All that had changed from then to now were the circumstances; instead of illness, it was the war that could do him in before he did.
And then when he had all three, something to fight for again and the team reunited and at the compound once more, and home still didn’t feel like a home: Tony. Tony, who was gone. Tony, whom he had hurt so deeply and realized he loved too late.
“Yeah,” Patsy repeated, dragging out the word like she did the first time. She looked as though she were stuck between thinking he was pitifully dense and being insulted that he of all people got the prize when he clearly didn’t appreciate it the way she did.
A massive bellow reached them, and Tony turned his head just in time to see Hulk flung backwards in the far distance, small as a speck, Thanos’s blow making him skid several miles once he hit the ground before coming to a stop, slumped over and unmoving.
Nothing about their conversation so far made any sense; if anything, Steve was more confused than when he had first entered his room.
“I dreamed of him tonight. The kid,” he offered carefully. Evenly. His hand felt dirty. He wanted to pull it back into his lap, under the table and out of Steve’s sight, to rub his palm against his thigh over and over again.
The video floods the screen and shows the innards of an alien ship. Natasha has no idea what she’s looking at. Tony is off-screen.
By the time he looked at Steve full on, the soft light had dimmed though it wasn’t snuffed out completely, tinged with a wistfulness that was foreign to him and that he brusquely forced himself to ignore.
Steve wondered what would happen if he pushed back. He stepped closer, placing a hand on Tony’s hip and slipping his fingers through the belt loop there, reeling him in before he could think better of it. He could hear Tony suck in a breath, surprised, and he wanted to chase it past Tony’s lips. But that would have to wait even if he did give in a little and lean over him, watching Tony intently as he spoke.
Maybe it hadn’t had time to set in—or maybe it wouldn’t, the illness stillborn after Steve had slammed his fist against Tony’s cheek and felt the bone there yield under his knuckles.
That wasn’t what he was afraid of, betrayal. He knew, just as Steve did, that there were decisions—mistakes—that he had made that he would never make again.
He knew that he had only a little while before the sun dipped entirely past the horizon; darkness came early at this time of year, thick and obscurant, and the flashlight on his phone would drain his battery rapidly if he wasn’t careful. He walked in bigger strides, opting not to soak in all the beauty around him, only thinking of the beauty that lay ahead.
He did. He had rushed to Siberia without hesitation because he fell for Zemo’s plot and because Steve needed him, and even though he pushed the possible legal ramifications of what he was doing out of his mind, it was only when he walked into the Hydra base and saw Steve smile with relief that he finally felt at ease. It was nice after butting heads for so long to have Steve’s back and know that Steve had his as they tackled a problem together, the way they were supposed to.
Theirs—because “You’re this city,” Tony once told him, and that was what Tony was to him too. That was the only way Steve could aptly describe him, someone so impossible to capture whole in an entire poem, an entire story, let alone a few short words.
Tony could imagine him sitting in the kitchen after he left him, insomnia his only company as he watched the sun rise over the city and faced the long stretch of the day ahead.
“The world’s a vast place, Captain. You’re more likely than not not to find them,” Monty had explained, unruffled by the indignant sounds of disapproval the Commandos had erupted into the minute he admitted his indifference. “And even if you do, they might not be who you wanted them to be,” he had added, too lightly this time to be speaking from anything but experience.
There was a tinge of sadness to Tony’s smile as though he could hear Steve’s thoughts, faint enough that had Steve been anyone else, he would have missed it. But he knew Tony with the intimacy of having spent years studying him, with the practiced eye of an artist and a friend, of someone who loved him before knowing anything about the world and ever since then, and he noticed it with ease.
The video cuts off, Tony visibly exhausted even just from talking as he reaches over to end the recording. He’s shaking, clumsy, bumping the helmet before he finds the switch. The screen turns dark, and the black void leaks out of the screen and into the room. It fills the hardened hollow Thanos left inside of her, tacky and deadly like poisonous sap.
His heart squeezed painfully as he wondered where his father’s was. It probably had been melted down or taken and handed down in another family. Or maybe it was on display in a museum or private collection somewhere like most of his belongings were nowadays. Nothing that used to be his was his to have anymore, it seemed.
Uncharted territory was dangerous; one wrong move and what they had built, stone upon uneven stone, a structure that was precariously cobbled together but remained intact if left alone, would come tumbling down. They would go back to where they had been at the Helicarrier, so they did their best not to do anything to rock the boat.
Natasha thinks, incongruously, of the empty compound grounds, of Avengers Tower, the mansion in Malibu, and the old Stark mansion on Long Island. She thinks of the large expanse of them all and of the darkness of space, Tony in the middle of it, alone and as small as he is now, and the spell breaks.
“You didn’t miscalculate anything, and you aren’t going to. You’re the smartest man I know, Tony,” Steve said steadily. “And you’ve been working on this for years. We’re prepared as we can be. We have a good system set in place.”
“Yes. I’ll make sure of it,” she said, and she gently closed her fingers over his band like she meant to protect it.
There was a large pillar lying on its side nearby, blocking most of a caved-in mouth to a fallen building. Tony squeezed past it, into a darkness more complete than the night outside.
“Hold me close, wherever you’re going,” Steve said, feeling the part of him that had kept Tony here for so long leave him and join Tony. “The rest of me will follow later.”
“He’s so young. He should be having fun with his friends, not—” Steve ran a hand down his face, exhaustion and worry in every line. “I’m just worried he’ll get hurt.”
“We had a good run,” Tony said quietly, and Steve wondered whether Tony knew what he had come to do and whether he would do it before he himself did. He wondered if Tony would be upset.
Tony could feel the weight of Steve’s eyes; he hadn’t looked away from Tony once since he had asked the question. He concentrated on his hand instead of returning Steve’s gaze, on keeping it flat and unmoving against the table.
Altogether it happened in less than a second, but time seemed to stretch indefinitely even as it sped by too quickly, slipping out of his grasp even as he desperately wanted it back. Between the time that he had tossed Tony’s faceplate to the side and had swung down his shield, Tony’s words from earlier came to mind, an unbidden whisper strong enough to have brought him to his knees had he not been on them already.
Numbness crept into every part of his life, a cold intravenous drip of anesthesia circulating through his veins and pulling him under, keeping his senses dulled even when he was asleep. At night he sank into nothingness and woke up hours later, washed ashore like driftwood with no idea how he got there.
Steve curled his fingers over them, stilling them. “Me too,” he said. His hand felt warm and clean, reassuringly solid over Tony’s. Protective.
“I’ll close my eyes,” he said, and even though he was okay, even though they had had years to arrive at this moment, where they both could let go at the same time, his eyes stung. Tony always tried to protect him, even now when they reached the end.
Tony snorted and Steve was distracted from his thoughts for a moment. “Nice, quiet time. Just like middle school and high school, right? I swear, half the time I thought you liked getting beaten up. Couldn’t figure out whether you had a death wish or a kink.” His mouth tilted as he tried to keep a straight face. “Maybe both?”
, he thought. It was like he had punched slabs of meat, and their color had rubbed off against his knuckles, leaving them bloody.
, he registered as its fragrance reached him. It was spring. Nature moved on, indifferent to all death and destruction, catkins hanging heavily from branches and the flowers that Wanda had left behind beginning to unfurl their buds.
Once he had walked away, Steve glanced at the note again even though he knew that there wasn’t any point; the handwriting wasn’t the same. Peggy’s letters were too neat and orderly that one glance would have sufficed in telling him as much, but he couldn’t help but hold out hope that maybe it was still Peggy somehow. That maybe it was Peggy when she was in a hurry or when she was emotional even though he couldn’t see her ever writing like this, all sharp, brisk, and angular.
There was a party raging on inside the house behind him, the deep bass thrum of music muffled by the distance but pounding the walls, in time with the throbbing in his head.
Because it was the same for him as it was for Tony—Tony had someone to come home to, and Steve…Steve had someone who chose to come home to him, who brought the whole of New York back to him every time he did, one that was theirs.
His name sounded intimate on Steve’s tongue. Private. There was a weight to it, a carefulness to the way it was spoken, as though it were a secret Steve had been protecting for these past years, holding it inside him until finally, he decided it was safe to let it go.
The movement’s magnetic—Tony’s magnetic. His gravitational pull is something Steve has never been able to resist ever since they met. It tugs Steve forward, out of the darkness.
But silence has never served the two of them well, and Natasha wants them to break it, to avoid the same pitfalls as before, leaving things unsaid, letting too much time pass. They’ve both been hurting for too long.
But Steve had looked at him, so worried, and maybe if he approached this with caution, he could strengthen what they had, make it more structurally sound. He was an engineer, after all. He couldn’t leave this alone.
He knocked on the door. Steve opened it, face wrinkling in confusion as he took Tony in. He was in a white T-shirt and loose sweatpants that hung low on his hips, his hair mussed. Tony forced himself not to look down.
But Tony stayed where he was, not disappearing as he staggered off the ramp and fell to his knees, his legs cutting out from under him as soon as he reached level ground.
“I know. I’m sorry. And I know that it wasn’t my secret to keep and that there’s no excuse, but I did it because I was afraid I’d lose you, Tony. And I didn’t want that.” He smiled thinly, his mouth crooked in a bitter, jagged line. “Like I said, I did it for me.”
There were people, he remembered, who dismissed Tony as immature, who froze him in the amber of their memories as someone whose childishness would follow him into adulthood, but they hadn’t had him entirely right. Youthful though he was, he was always rushing to the future, always light-years ahead of everyone else. If anything, there had been times when Steve thought that Tony had grown up too soon and much faster than he should have. Times when he had wondered when Tony would ever be the age he was supposed to be and no older or younger, before the accident happened a few weeks before college started.
And for the briefest of moments, as he traced the round, loopy letters printed on his skin with shaking fingers red and numb with cold, he was cradled in joy. It blossomed inside of his chest and wrapped around him, a protective cocoon against the cold, as bright as the Christmas lights running along the deck railing far behind him. It was quivery and silver-delicate before growing stronger and brighter, as though all the stars in the December sky had been switched on at once, as though the sun had come out, dazzling him and consuming his entire vision until he went blind with happiness.
But really, they’re there because they’re the only active soldiers left on the team. They’re coordinating with what remains of the world’s militaries and the UN. There’s a light blinking insistently on the phone that FRIDAY muted to deliver the message; they’re supposed to be on a call with Ross.
The compound was expansive in its silence. The others had greeted Tony and his companion—“Nebula,” Tony had said as she stood next to him, stoic but for the tightness that formed around her eyes when Rocket stopped in his tracks, frozen with grief now that his worst nightmare was a certainty with their arrival—and stayed with them until one by one, they had gone out, throughout the compound and into the city, to do everything that they could to prevent the world from dissolving into more chaos than it already was in.
“I know you might not want to hear this, but I meant what I said in the letter. You’ll always have me. Even if you want to go separate paths after all this is over, that won’t ever change.”
He opened his eyes despite his vertigo, and for a second the powdery snow became the muted concrete of the bunker.
“I kind of—” he blurted out too loudly and too quickly, getting ahead of himself in embarrassment. He rubbed the back of his neck self-consciously. “I might’ve thought you were putting yourself up for auction.”
He took a moment, taking in every inch of Tony, trying to commit to memory the exact way Tony looked, beautiful and immortal in the dying light of their last day, before holding out his hands, palms up. Tony carefully wrapped his hands around his, making sure not to go through him.
There’s no difference between those gone and those still here, Natasha realizes. This too is death, just a different kind.
Her hands. Her hands that held his when she had seen his word, that had been warm and gentle and reassuring even as she spoke with a ferocity that Tony had never heard from her before. He almost felt them on him now, a phantom imprint from years past that time had never managed to fully wash away.
What would Steve do if he loved him? What promise could Steve make to him if he loved him back? Because he knew that Steve would if he did. He had seen it personally, what it was like to have Steve swear an oath to someone he cared about. Even time, enemy to all, couldn’t stand up to him; nearly a century after they had met, after decades had ripped them apart, Steve did his damn best to be by Barnes’s side, to hell with the world.
Bucky turned, zeroing in on the arm he cradled against his chest. “I knew you hit that ball wrong,” he said. His lips twisted into a displeased pucker.
Steve seems to think the same thing because there are no right words for their reunion, but he manages to find the right one anyway.
“Then go over the battle plan with me. I want your input,” he decided on saying. He tapped his watch, flicking his fingers out so that all the information scattered across the room, bathing it in blue. It was a familiar scene, one that they had repeated countless times before on sleepless nights at the tower.
Steve looked him full in the eye, his gaze never once wavering even as he clenched his jaw, eyes wet.
His touch lingered long after he had to let go, long after Tony watched his Quinjet soar out of sight and readied to go into battle himself.
But it wasn’t about belief. It wasn’t about how much Steve meant it. What it came down to was the work that was put in and Steve hadn’t delivered.
“I remember a lot of arm-wrestling that says otherwise.” Tony grew serious again, nervously picking at the gold circle lining the edge of the plate as if he could peel it off. “You seemed kinda nervous about it after you won so I thought the least I could do was show you what it pairs well with when you got it. But I get it if it’s awkward so I can just go.”
, she thinks as she clicks on the intercom and calls the rest of the Avengers down to the room, ideas already forming in her head. They won’t let him down. Not like they have before. Not on this.
“You have me too,” Steve reminded him because Tony had won his auction too and because everything Tony was offering, he wanted to give back to Tony as well.
Relief and exhaustion set in as Steve reached him, traveling through dozens of distributaries branching out of his weary heart, a heady cocktail that left his limbs loose and weak.
“I know, but I meant it. Every word,” Steve says, straightforward like it’s the truth. Like he can make it so, whatever he says he’ll do, by willpower alone.
The past two years had taught him this: he didn’t need Steve. And the safer choice would most likely be to keep Steve at a distance.
It knocked Tony off-kilter except it shouldn’t have. Despite his misconceptions of Steve that had carried over from adolescence and their botched first meeting, Steve had turned out to be less uptight and callously judgmental than he had assumed he would be.
He smiled, and Steve wondered if he was teasing him or if he meant it because what Steve had done was mortifying, not sweet. He had misread the situation and had rushed into things, thinking Tony needed help when he had been perfectly fine.
A violation for a violation then, that’s what he wanted. It was only right. It was only fair, when he had been reduced to this, was bleeding like this.
The sky is choked with sooty flakes, Death’s winter in spring. Outside their grove, the ground undulates with mounds of ash rising from the scarred battlefield. It reminds her of the Dilmun tumuli she saw in Bahrain eighteen years ago. Almost all of the world’s largest funerary grounds have been destroyed over the past fifty years, but it’s as if those burial mounds were restored and transported to the fields in front of her. There are so many gone. From here, where she’s standing, the hills stretch to the ends of Earth.
Barnes’s hand had been around his mother’s neck. He had reached in with his real hand—why had he done that with his real hand, his metal one would have been safer, more impersonal and anonymous—and he had killed her, knowing exactly how her pulse felt under his fingers as he squeezed, how her windpipe felt as he crushed it in a vise, how her fingernails felt against his skin as she scratched him, her hands scrabbling—
He guessed it didn’t matter. They both knew she wasn’t his from the beginning even if they hoped or tried to pretend otherwise.
Jan wriggled her way between them. “It came!” she squealed as soon as she made her way to the front, clapping with glee. “I wonder who delivered it. Maybe Vision? He wouldn’t care that much about trying a bite.” She eyed the wheel as if she were sorely tempted to slice off a chunk for herself.
He ran a shaky hand down his face before dropping it in his lap, barely registering the letter crinkling even though it felt permanently seared into his thigh. It didn’t matter. One more scar was nothing when every bit of him was already branded. Steve had left burn marks all over him, leaving no skin untouched.
At first it had been because there hadn’t been a point, because it wouldn’t change anything, but then the reason had morphed into something else.
All his preparation for this exact moment flew out the window. He had spent the past years alternating between thinking Steve never cared about him and thinking that he did but not enough or not as much as he had wanted him to (“So was I.” But had he been?). He wasn’t sure what was worse.
“We don’t even have scraps. Jesus, Strange kept me alive and for what? All my plans—” Tony cut himself off, pressing his lips together, his breathing uneven. “There’s nothing. I have nothing. Not a single clue to just point us in the right direction.”
He didn’t have an answer for Steve. He didn’t know how long it would take for him to figure it out or if he would ever have an answer. And it would be cruel to give Steve hope when that was the case.
He switched on the comms, sitting on the floor with the Gauntlet to his side. “We’re ready,” he said tightly.
He brought up a bandaged hand to wrap around Steve’s arm instead. Steve leaned in, pliant under his tentative touch, and wonder and the beginning of something else bloomed inside of him as Steve let him draw him close, as all of Steve’s fatigued tension fell away under his caress.
He could do it, feel every bit of it, with none of the pain that came along with destroying himself.
He looks too young and too worn at once. He looks like the man he was two years ago, but Natasha can see that he doesn’t feel any more like himself than he did on the run. She doesn’t have to tell him it’s because that person no longer exists. He’s not who he used to be—none of them are after Thanos—but he hasn’t been the same since his fallout with Tony.
He pushed just as hard, his mind bursting into flames, breaking apart with the effort until he and the Stones pushed against each other so hard that they both slipped to the side, to a third option, to the Stones disseminating to the farthest, most inhospitable and unreachable places of the universe, away from one another and away from everyone else in time and in space.
In her mind, he’s off to the side as she and the others take in Avengers Tower for the first time, too deliberately casual to be anything but as he floats the idea of forming the Avengers again.
But Tony was an expert in many things including hiding pain. He would hide it well if it had had a chance to take root, and that was what Steve couldn’t stop thinking about, the answer that eluded him.
Steve’s the only one left, and he stands at a distance as though he wants to give Tony and the rest of them space or he isn’t sure he’s welcome. He’s pale, nearly translucent in the darkness now that the lights of the ship have shut off, like he has seen a ghost or is one himself.
And for the first time, Tony understood the depths to that truth, the profound, limitless eternity of it.
He rubbed his thumb across Tony’s knuckles before letting go. He was still smiling and now that he wasn’t about to shake out of his skin, Tony noticed for the first time the shadows crescented under Steve’s eyes.
He wondered if his lines would become something different or even disappear entirely before he remembered what Dr. Erskine had said to him half an hour ago.
“You think I haven’t tried?” For the first time in days, Tony faced Steve full on, refusing to look away. It was easier and harder than he expected. “I did that before, told him to stick to old ladies crossing the street and playground fights, and Teenage Rebellion decided not to listen.”
“Hey. Stay with me,” Tony pleaded. “You have to stay with me, okay?” He cupped Steve’s face in his hands, stroking the curve of his cheek.
What had Thor said? The wielder had to have resolve. The pure, unshakable kind. The resolve of a titan, formidable and unmovable, untainted by doubt and distractions.
A white-hot concentrated repulsor blast. Barnes slumped on concrete, his arm a serrated stump, dazed and helpless.
Tony gave a noncommittal hum, electing to observe the scene below again. Outside, Lang doubled over, his hands on his knees, refusing to go on. They were too far up to hear what Sam was shouting at him. Redwing, newly upgraded, swooped around Lang, pecking at his head every other second, deftly avoiding his sluggish swats.
he thought for a fleeting second, but Brooklyn and Sam and Natasha, Bucky and his mother, stirred in the back of his mind, beckoning him, and he knew that that wasn’t what he wanted.
She should have known better; as much as she and Steve value companionship, they don’t build their lives around it. They build their lives around purpose—and Tony gave both of them that until they lost it again.
She wants to reach into the video and adjust the angle so she can see Tony, and as though he can hear her thoughts, Tony knocks what she assumes is his helmet with his foot so that it faces him. As soon as he does, she knows. One glance tells her everything.
A sob surged through Tony, tremulous but powerful like a wave at its peak, ready to crash onto shore. Something about that wholeness when he was now incomplete and unbalanced made him want to claw the word off as much as he had wanted to back in the bunker, run ragged, deep scores through the word until it was illegible. He wanted to feel it mangle up underneath his fingernails, feel every single neat, round letter rip, the chunks of flesh sloughing right off.
The tension that had coiled in Steve’s muscles and the tightness around his eyes when he first came into the gym were gone now, but exhaustion had replaced them instead, the cruel kind that wouldn’t let him rest.
“You need your hands to work,” he had said, and there was a meaning there that Tony couldn’t interpret but wanted to study up close so he could, one day.
“Every night,” Steve added quietly as he did. He stared at their clasped hands, not doing anything except sweeping a trail across the back of Tony’s with his thumb, cleansing him.
Steve hesitated before gripping his arm reassuringly. Tony resisted the urge to pull away, but Steve must have felt the way his muscles had instantly seized up before he could stop them from doing so because he froze.
“I’m not sure how you could forget winning a wheel of one of the most expensive cheeses in the world,” Sam muttered.
who were bidding on him because some surprising bidders had come forward, and Steve…hadn’t been able to handle that.
He thought of everyone who had taunted or pitied him, assuming he would die before he got them, and it must have shown on his face, the way he wanted to burst into laughter, punch drunk on love, because Bucky knocked shoulders with him, grinning brightly enough that it almost felt like noon again.
Tony moved away, and Steve let his hand fall to his side as he watched Tony bring up his legs and fold his arms over his knees, resting his chin on them.
“Then tell me what he said. I’ll relay it to everyone here, and we’ll make calls to the others. We got this.”
It had been a while since Steve was in town. His mother had moved back to Brooklyn when he was away at college and since then, Steve had had no reason to go back. Brooklyn was home; it was where he was originally from and where he was going to next, now that he was done with college, but this was where he had spent most of his adolescent years. Maybe he was a bit sentimental, a bit stuck in the past, but it was why he decided to make the move to Brooklyn alone, getting a day’s head start of Natasha, Sam, and Bucky.
The words were carefully chosen to give him an out, but Tony knew what Rhodey meant. He should have been surprised, but mostly he was tired. There was an odd relief in being able to talk about a secret he had been concealing for over a year, one that had once been so precious to him that he was afraid of letting anyone find out about it.
“For now, no. The Guardians and I are trying to gain as much distance as we can from both Xandar and Earth. But we have to act quickly.”
“You too, Tony,” Steve said softly, and this time, when Steve reached for him, slowly, carefully, when he wrapped a hand firmly around the crook of Tony’s arm and held onto him as though he could leave some form of protection on his skin, Tony let him.
But the universe doesn’t care about fairness. If it did, she wouldn’t be standing here instead of those who were truly good, those who deserved new beginnings, though she can’t tell which fate is worse, being killed the way they were or being one of the lucky few to survive by pure chance.
Midtown, ugly and raucous, became something else when given the chance. A different side emerged when seen from a new perspective, with enough space. Like now.
Besides, he thought, looking at Peggy, sloe-eyed and breathtaking in a scarlet dress, her lips curved into a smile like a promise, maybe he had already found the right partner.
“Why are you telling me this?” He tried to keep his voice even, but the words came out coarse and tight.
And so Natasha says the only thing that comes to mind, something that isn’t empty words of comfort but the truth.
“No! I mean, yes, I do want to go out with you. I think Sam made my side of this fairly obvious, but…you looked really uncomfortable up there,” Steve said softly.
Morbidly, it struck Tony that this could and most likely would be the last time he would see some of them ever again. No one was naive enough to believe that they would all miraculously survive; they knew what was at stake when they answered the call and that there was a high possibility that they were marching straight to death’s doors. It had been there in the back of his mind too, only he had refused to dwell on it and there had been more pressing matters to attend to than to think about it. But with Thanos finally coming, there was no avoiding the thought.
“Steve,” he whispered. He placed his hand on Steve’s shoulder. It was cold and stiff under his hand; at some point, he had taken off his gauntlet, hoping against hope that he would still register warmth, still register Steve breathing under him except he was trembling too much to notice if Steve was even if he tried.
But there were no signs of thorns or leaves or petals. No sweet sickness perfuming Tony. No bloodstains on his mouth, faded like lipstick he hadn’t managed to wipe off entirely, or careful, labored breathing that made him hunch over and carry himself gingerly.
Steve walked up to him, circumventing broken bits of Chitauri ships and balancing on the uneven, ruined surface of the Park Avenue Viaduct. He surveyed the roads below and then Grand Central to his right, squinting into the sun. “This feels familiar,” he said drily.
But Tony was Midtown, was New York, was every inch of this beautiful place of theirs, from its most elegant to its most rudimentary, from the needle tips of the Freedom Tower and the Empire State Building to train tracks girded in electrified steel underground. Michelin-starred restaurants that Steve would have never dreamed of stepping into before Tony came into his life, perfumed luxury shops on the wide streets of Fifth Ave and the cobbled ones in Soho. Dive bars that had seen their best days in decades past, late-night karaoke joints up a narrow flight of stairs in K-Town, blocks away from the sold-out concert at MSG that they had skipped because Steve was hungry. New buildings and parks and ideas spun of dreams to crumbling bricks and stomped dandelions poking through cracks in the pavement.
“I know how to handle a little scrape, Rogers,” Tony replied, but he was more amused than offended by Steve’s motherhenning as he followed him to the door. He did have to tend to his hands anyway. They would be in bad shape otherwise. Already, all the pain that he had blocked while pummeling the bag rushed back now that he was no longer zoned out, and his hands were hot and throbbed long after he stopped moving.
They had been like that since the start, these two, telling everyone but each other how much they saw the soul of the other person, how much they truly respected each other.
“Romanoff. Rogers,” he said once he reached them, and he was proud of how steady his voice was. He made no move to shake their hands or touch them in any way.
He waited for what they built to crash down from his push. Steve stopped his ministrations but didn’t let go—he was only waiting to heat up the ointment some more before continuing to spread it around.
He didn’t know what he was doing. Why he had even chosen to go back to this instead of Siberia. Instead of that fateful day in the lab.
A part of Tony, the part that was still healing, warned against letting Steve in, against letting his guard down so that he could never get hurt again, because it had never been a matter of whether he loved Steve or not. He always did, and he always would. It was a matter of whether he could let Steve in.
“I should have known better than to treat a random word as gospel,” he shot back, his voice dangerously close to breaking. He took a deep breath. “I just…I wanted to buy into something like that for once, you know? To really believe that it could be the one good thing in my life. Even when I was alone. Even when I was a piece of shit. God.” He laughed humorlessly. “I know it’s stupid. But I really did believe it.”
What would their lives have been like if they had trusted each other, Tony mused, if they had been upfront about everything—about Ultron, about Barnes, about their soul marks? What would the present be like? He hadn’t wanted to spare any thought to it, too weary and hurt to wallow in “what if”s, and it was too late to do that now. There was no time to dwell on that different present when the one they had was in jeopardy.
“Then we’ll recalibrate. We’ve always been good at switching up plans on the fly, you most of all.” Steve gave him a fond lopsided smile.
They had already hurt each other. They had already realized that they needed each other—more than they might have even realized—too late and at the worst possible time. Thanos had seen to that. They had seen to that.
“Tony was up there, and he looked uncomfortable,” he said instead of answering Sam’s question, his ears on fire. At this rate, his entire body would be as red as Tony’s armor.
Jim directs FRIDAY to play Tony’s video immediately. His calm authority, so different from Steve’s fragile calmness as he asks if this is an old message, reminds her that Jim led the search for Tony a decade ago and refused to give up long after Tony’s chances of survival dwindled to almost zero and there were no signs of Tony still being alive.
So when he told Steve, “You waited for me. You didn’t have to,” his voice fragile with surprise, like Steve hadn’t done this before, like Steve wasn’t an assured thing, Steve wanted to ask how could he not, when Tony did all that for him.
“No. Listen. You might’ve drawn strength from your word, I’m not saying you didn’t, I’m not saying that it didn’t help in some way, but in the end that was all you,” he said, so firm in his resolve that he almost sounded impatient. “He wasn’t actually there. You made it this far on your own. That has nothing to do with him.”
And if that were true, if nothing went wrong, then Steve knew without a doubt that his mark would stay unchanged because it was better than good. Of all the parts that made him who he was, his soulmate’s words were the best, the one truly perfect thing.
Except…except now that he was next to Steve, it had seemed silly, that fight or flight impulse, when all he wanted to do was lean against Steve’s shoulder and close his eyes, to go to sleep with Steve solid under him, his presence a weight that would anchor him as he slept, that would remind him that Steve was alive and with him, not dead, not countries, planets, or galaxies away.
She goes by facts. Solid ground. Things she knows with certainty, things that will ground her and help drive the static out of her head.
He couldn’t bring himself to see the pity on Rhodey’s face. Shame coated his tongue, rancid and fermented like stale alcohol.
But as they looked at each other, Steve couldn’t help but think about the years lost and the years that they would never have.
How often did he do that? His injuries would be gone in less than a day; he could push himself harder than Tony could because his body would reset like he was some kind of reverse Fight Club Cinderella.
, and if Steve had never said his word, Tony thought furiously and hopelessly, if he hadn’t realized it had been his word, then he wouldn’t have let—
“You know, I always admired your ability to look stunning even when things go to shit,” he mumbles into her hair, curling a lock that’s still blond around his finger. It’s grown in the past months, turning into an untamed mess of scarlet and gold, but she hadn’t been able to bring herself to chop off her dyed hair. She still doesn’t feel like herself. She couldn’t care less about how she looks and hasn’t looked at her reflection in a long time.
His soulmate would be his confidant, his home. He would tell them things that he couldn’t tell anyone else, place all his deepest hopes and fears in the safest hands he knew.
“What’s all the—oh Cap, you’re back.” Patsy poked her head out of her room as if the cheese wheel had called to her—or maybe it was Jan’s shriek that had sounded the alarm. “Hey, could I try some? I’ve been waiting for Professor Pym to let you guys out to ask.” She pursed her lips at Sam’s snort. “Okay, the past three weeks,” she conceded as she walked over.
He settled on his wish after a moment, committing every atom of himself to the seed of that idea, believing in it, hoping for it.
The sky above them is whole; there’s no tin man falling out of the sky. Tony’s trapped beyond the wormhole he never truly came back from, and countless have been slain by an alien wielding impossible power.
He couldn’t breathe. Steve’s betrayal sat heavily on his chest, lodged there in the shield’s stead, keeping air from his lungs. He was cracked open, naked. He was shut in, trapped.
Steve swallowed, hard. “No, they’re not.” He spoke slowly as though every word brought him pain. “Even if they weren’t mine, they wouldn’t be.” Tony wanted to ask what he meant, but the question sat on his tongue, leaden and unwanted; he settled for watching Steve gather himself. “I know this is a lot,” he added softly. “But I’m not saying it because I expect something from you. I just wanted you to know.”
Tony laughed, a rusty, jarring sound that scraped his insides bloody. Darkness bled across his vision and he tumbled into it headfirst, falling and falling, in a dizzying descent with no end.
The numbness didn’t last long. Steve was everywhere in his absence. The “World’s Best Dad” mug that Natasha had gotten for him, and Tony, in the sink. The knit throw that was originally Wanda’s and then the team’s and then his, neatly folded with militaristic precision on the couch. A mission report open on the coffee table, a note stopped mid-scrawl in the margin, a pen resting on top of it and holding his place on the page as though he had simply gone out for a run and would come back to read it over lunch. That was Steve’s personal copy; there were tiny doodles all over it: Sam cooing over Redwing, Vision cooking with a chef’s hat, Tony snoozing at his lab table with a blanket draped over him.
“Uh,” he managed to say intelligently, the strong stench permeating every inch of his room and apparently his brain so that he couldn’t think of anything other than “Big cheese in room. Why?”
Natasha watches whole battalions disintegrate, both on their side and Thanos’s, and thinks that Thanos is a man of his word despite his mercilessness and cruelty. He’s an undiscerning judge and executioner, as fair as he claimed he would be.
“I can’t believe this.” Tony huffed out a laugh, changing tack, but his eyes still retained an unsettling blankness to them that Steve didn’t like. “I thought I’d be the one regaling you with tales of the wild college life, not the other way around.”
“You’re pretty good at this,” he noted. It was true. Steve knew what he was doing, and he was doing a better job of wrapping the bandages than if he had done it on his own.
They had to be because his had meant nothing in the end. Had never meant anything, to Steve. To the universe.
An awkward pause ensued where no one was quite sure where to look. Tony had to nip this in the bud before they started talking about things he would rather not deal with. At least not tonight.
Fourteen million to one, he thought as Tony intertwined their fingers, and though the chance of failure was high and they were going in blind, he couldn’t help but believe, now that they had each other.
“You believe that as much as I do. You brought us together after SHIELD fell and wanted us to be on the same page for the Accords. And you put that belief into the plan you’ve been working on for years, even after everything that happened.”
He walked away, his shadow stretching long in front of him as he made his way towards the empty hallway, doing his best to stay loose even as he wanted nothing more than to ball his hands into fists and…and…
All that mattered, he wanted to say, was that he had a soulmate. They were out there somewhere waiting for him, words that he would one day say to them tattooed on their skin. That was worth the pain, any pain, ten times over. He had finally gotten his words—and before anyone else did too.
A riotous beauty in constant motion (but still at the moment because he slowed down for Steve; he always did), someone who could go miles and leave the whole world in his dust but, miraculously, unfathomably, returned every time, no matter how far he traveled.
“You don’t deserve it,” he said because for a second he thought that Steve was going to kill him with the shield that his father had made, the one that he had chosen out of all the ones that Howard had offered him.
And it was true. He had said it then with such conviction that Tony had no choice but to relent. It should have changed things, the fact that his word did have meaning, that it was something that Steve believed in with all his heart.
The backs of his hands were chafed raw, and the skin around his knuckles was bright red where it had torn a little.
He’s brave and brilliant. He got both himself and the team out of dire straits and to the summits of their best selves, using risky, unconventional, and clever methods to survive and grow and then later, help them all thrive.
Thanos couldn’t claim that loss. He made it more certain and unassailable, but Steve had lost Tony on his own and there will be no closure for that. No absolution unless Tony comes back and maybe not even then.
. That’s what we do, Steve.” He watched as self-recrimination and regret warred on Steve’s face before summoning his courage to forge on. “You said ‘Together,’” he said shakily. He forced himself not to reach for his left wrist, to play with the band around it. “You always said that win or lose, whatever the circumstances, that we’d face it together. Did you ever mean it?”
Steve hadn’t known. Tony knew that—he had never said anything about it to Steve, after all—but put through a new experiment he hadn’t realized he had been running until it was over, the fact that he had assumed he had known every detail of, the fact that had held little significance to him until now, suddenly revealed hidden layers that upended his entire world.
Steve paused, bowing his head, and Tony knew his blow had landed, four sharp hooks gouged into Steve’s skin, ready to slice his back open the moment he took a step away from him.
Because Tony shouldn’t get away with what he did, he told himself, but pretense didn’t come naturally to him the way it did Tony. He knew, however small-minded and obsessive and pathetic it made him, that it was because Tony shouldn’t be allowed not to care about this when he cared too much.
A steaming plate piled high with chicken biryani appeared on his desk. The fragrance hit him immediately, making him realize how hungry he was.
Tears dropped, one after another, landing on their intertwined hands. Tony didn’t know whose they were, his or Steve’s.
Their belief pays off when an aircraft flies towards the compound and they all run out to meet it, squinting in the darkness at the floodlights overhead. FRIDAY didn’t say anything which means it didn’t need clearance to touch down and that means…
“I’d like to talk to Tony alone,” Steve said to all of them firmly, his expression quelling any form of protest that might have otherwise risen.
Their pinkies were a hair’s breadth apart, not quite touching. Tony wanted to loop his around Steve’s and bring Steve’s hand towards him.
A tear spilled onto the hand he had on Tony’s neck, then another, the first warning drops of a downpour. Steve opened his eyes to see Tony’s closed ones, his long eyelashes dewed. His mouth was parted as though he had something to say.
He focused on unlocking each layer with surgical precision. The fight outside had diminished to white noise as time stretched, infinite in the darkness, broken only by the light of the arc reactor; only he and the box existed in this pocket universe he had fallen into and nothing else. Three down, two to go.
She allows herself to skim the nape of his neck, near the spot where she stabbed him, even though she’s been careful about touching him since that moment in the diner nearly a decade ago. Linking arms was okay. Touching his shoulder when he knew she was there was too. Gestures that are carefully and loudly telegraphed but nothing more intimate than that.
“Told me he had the best time ever at camp and to keep in touch, xoxo,” he said as he quelled the urge to throw them into a drawer and bang it shut. “We’re going to talk over the phone for hours, gossiping about boys, I know it.”
Steve, Tony thought as he had caught the Gauntlet in the air. Steve, he thought as he assembled it. If there ever was a physical embodiment of that sort of resolve, it was Steve.
“Not going anywhere. Not leaving you,” Steve breathed out. He turned his hand over so that he was holding Tony’s and squeezed, but his gaze grew dull, his eyes losing focus. After one last heavy blink, they remained closed.
He had called this home when Sam had asked him where they were going, but maybe it hadn’t been one for a long time. What he had yearned for no longer existed. The compound had turned into a cold, unwelcoming mausoleum while he was gone, and Rhodes had looked so small when they walked in, swallowed up by the vast emptiness of the room, lonely even with the holographic figures that filled it.
He walked away from everything to be Steve Rogers; this time, he walks in the opposite direction. He’s Captain America all the time now, and he doesn’t want to be that, not when he failed the world so badly, but he wants to be Steve Rogers even less.
People always said that it did. And he had read a study done on vets after they came home from war. Something about that physical connection helped to put them at ease, to take away some of the pain.
The ship lands, and all of them stand tensely in a row, a somber welcoming party. Carol’s a comet tearing the night sky into two behind it, burning too brightly for them to see her face even if it hadn’t been covered by her helmet—but it doesn’t matter because the ramp descends and Tony appears at the entrance.
His shield is still locked away. He knows where it is. He knows the password. Tony didn’t change it. Natasha tested it. She didn’t know whether to laugh or grieve over that or that neither he nor Steve have unlocked the vault since the shield was put into storage when she asks FRIDAY when it was last accessed.
“Netflix and chill?” Sam replied a bit disapprovingly, as if he were disappointed on Steve’s behalf. “I thought you’d have better game than that.”
Tony ignored him. He managed all this without Steve. A five-minute conversation wouldn’t kill him. Less if he had any say.
He hadn’t said anything about that, just that Tony needed to clean his hands—but he had hovered awkwardly in the doorway, halfway in and halfway out, decisiveness making way for uncertainty as he realized this was something Tony could do on his own. All Tony could think about when he noticed that was the way Steve’s face fell when he examined his hands and the way Steve’s hands felt around his.
A veil he hadn’t known was there lifted, and beyond it he could see all the infinite possibilities, each one a jewel glimmering with potential. There was no way he could pick one. It was like choosing a star out of the sky except that he could see to the ends of the universe, to the ends of time, every single star that had ever existed, that existed, that would exist. He could go back. Save his parents. Save Barnes.
He wasn’t sure if Steve would be okay. He didn’t know the first thing about stomach wounds, didn’t know the extent of Steve’s, not without peeling back the uniform and hurting Steve even more. He didn’t know whether it was fatal or not, but there was a lot of blood. Too much blood. He was kneeling in it, the legs of his armor coated with it.
“You don’t deserve it,” he said because he wanted to ask what he did to deserve him instead, but he didn’t know how.
Steve might not be there when he needed him, but if the world was in danger, that was a different story. Not that he had the power to do much, on the lam halfway across the world. Tony guessed it was the thought that counted, but he couldn’t bring himself to believe it; he had learned his lesson—words didn’t mean anything unless they were backed up by action.
“No,” Steve agreed, subdued. “I still hurt you. I made that choice.” His knuckles were striated white as he clenched the railing, the bleached bone pronounced. He was stripped bare. “I can’t take it back, but I am sorry,” he whispered. “More than you’ll ever know.”
“No, see. I was supposed to live,” he said. “Strange made sure of it.” Bitterness bled through all the way, his dark eyes glittering with its heat. “Told me it was the only way as he handed Thanos the Time Stone. And then they all—the kid—” His hands shook, and he clenched them to stop the tremors, though he took care not to look at them.
He wanted Steve to understand how he felt and hurt like he did—but there was no point in yelling something that Steve already knew, no point in driving home something that had clearly already been hammered in. All of Steve’s pain was reserved for Tony; he hurt for Tony with no regard to his own suffering, and it left Tony aimless and lost in his anger and pain.
Not a family but a machine, engineered to deal with threats that were getting more frequent and more complex.
“All right, just—” And for a moment, Tony seemed unsure. “I don’t know what’s going to happen. I don’t want you to see this.”
“How much did you hear?” he asked weakly, breaking a long moment of awkward silence where no one quite knew where to look.
And that was the problem right there, he knew. It would be so easy to step back into this, to pretend that things could work out just for a little while. As Tony looked at him, those brown eyes he loved so much so wide and incredibly young, Steve thought about how very easy it would be to forget everything and stay.
There was nothing left for him here except ghosts, and not even that anymore, he thought as he swung a leg over the seat and started the bike. The engine roared to life underneath him, and as he drove away, choosing to look up and ahead at the stars silent above him rather than back, he thought he could see one shine bigger and brighter than the others. Tony would be there, exploring the whole universe like he was supposed to—like Steve wanted him to.
—and it was more beautiful than anything he had ever seen. All the doubt he had had disappeared in a flash, leaving him defenseless against a wave of awe and joy that pulled him under so quickly, he was drowning before he could think of bracing himself.
Sometimes, in moments like the one now, when things got too hard and he couldn’t see the future past the next step, it was enough just to repeat his soulmate’s words in his head like a prayer. It helped him march forward even when he saw things he could have never imagined in his worst nightmares, even when he trudged through battlefields bogged down with mud and too many bodies and towns silent and hollow with devastation.
The ship docked far off in the distance, its gusting propellers cutting off as soon as it sank into the loamy soil. The grass swayed and then straightened. A ramp began to slide down and before he knew what he was doing, he shot forward, unsure of whether the fear that pumped through him like adrenaline came from bracing for another fight or from hoping, even when he tried so valiantly not to, that not everything had been lost.
They were like bedtime stories, his nightmares. Horrible ones, ones he didn’t ask for, but ones that were old and familiar, ones that he knew every line of, like the stories Jarvis, Ana, and his mother would take turns reading to him as a kid. But instead of valiant knights saving the day, it was monsters that populated his stories now. Ghoulish, hideous creatures, swarms of them darkening the sky, Earth’s very own plague of locusts. Fathers who groomed their children for war, for their own gain; fathers who thought they knew best and wreaked irrevocable damage, who seemed truly sorry to some degree that it had to come to this but went through with their plans anyway. Monsters who stood by as their children died in front of them or in their arms.
With his eyes closed, Steve could almost feel the weight of Tony’s hands in his, their softness as he brushed them in reassurance.
The sun was high in the sky. The city glittered, steel and glass buildings rising like trees all around him. Whichever way he faced, they were there, and though only two skyscrapers nearby came close to the Avengers Tower in height, there were so many of them, a veritable forest, that they towered over him when he closed his eyes. He was small in their presence, swallowed up and anonymous—though not invisible. Not lost.
And now, whether Loki had indeed surrendered the Space Stone to save his brother or whether he had weighed his choices and concluded that it would be in his self-interest to shift loyalties, Thanos had the Stone in his possession and was heading their way.
It didn’t matter if he didn’t think he could even if Rhodey told him otherwise. When it came down to it, he had to. Because a conditional “together” wasn’t reliable. Because he couldn’t let people in the way he had before and try to make them what he wanted them to be again. Because if his worst nightmares all came true and no one was there, no one was left, if it was down to only him, he would have to be enough on his own.
He thought of the way that Steve had looked at him when he stopped him from destroying the bag, the way he held his hands in his, so crestfallen over their swollen, bloody, shredded state. He thought of the way that Steve had brushed his torn skin, the calluses and scars that he had collected over the years, with a kind of reverence before applying the ointment.
Steve’s eyebrows bunched together in confusion, but he was so used to Tony making references by now that he let it pass without comment.
“I didn’t want to hurt you. I still don’t,” Steve said. “And I won’t ever hurt you like that again.”
Steve would discover new things about Tony every day the way he would this city. Another layer of paint to coat the canvas he had known. Another to peel away and reveal history that had never fully disappeared but had just been out of sight. Never changing and changing all the time, familiar and new all at once. A patchwork of contradictions that came together to make one complicated but cohesive whole, a place where past and future rendezvoused, where his New York and Tony’s coexisted.
Tony screwed his eyes shut. He was undone, the only anchor grounding him Steve’s touch. There was something crescendoing in him, a monster of a whirlwind that beat at the walls, straining to burst out of him, at the horror of Steve’s words.
“Yeah,” Rhodey said, “you know the princess got that crazy ‘I can fix this’ look in her eyes when she told me to talk to her earlier? It reminded me of you. Except she’s younger and smarter and probably less annoying.”
He dropped into the chair by Steve’s desk, dragging in a deep breath that sounded wet to his ears. “You ever consider that you might not have? I wasn’t mad at you for what happened; it wasn’t your fault or Barnes’s. I was mad at you for keeping me in the dark. If you had just told me, I would have had the time and space to process it and helped you. Tell me you know that I wouldn’t have held that against you.”
The distance between them was vast, greater than the space that lay between them. Somewhere along the way, they had passed each other unaware, two ships skimming each other’s hulls, noticing only when their paths had already diverged.
The bridge has been swept away, but they’re on the same bank now, Tony pulling Steve to his feet onto safer ground.
“Yes,” Steve rebutted firmly. “You have everything it takes. You always did. And you got something else that Thanos doesn’t.” His face was pinched, his breathing labored; he paid a high cost for every word, and Tony wanted to scream at him to stop talking. “Your belief in a better future. Your hope. Y’never give up ’cause of that, Iron Man. S’why I love you.” His smile was crooked, sloppy as his words which came out slurred, vowels and consonants melting into one another, dribbling out of his mouth like another kind of blood.
Tony focused on that as he spoke, committing every part of himself to each word he was about to say.
The difference is that she remembers as reparation and he as preservation. He had carried his loved ones forward, clutching them to his chest, stepping inside himself and sealing the entrance behind him to keep them and himself safe. He let no one in and let nothing out.
But this, he knew, this was beyond that. The answer to their prayers rested inches away from their hands.
Peggy’s hand was warm where it was curled around his wrist. She was the only person he had ever allowed to get close to his soulmate’s words like that and the only one who had seen them aside from his mother, Bucky, Dr. Erskine, and Howard, all of whom were long gone.
They defeated the infantry, thinking foot soldiers as generals, one battle an entire war—naïveté that was drummed out of her at a young age, that Tony warned against.
“You know me so well,” Steve said dryly, but he was grinning widely. He had been worried throughout the entire ride over that too much time had passed and too much had changed between them after they had gone their separate ways, but it was easy talking to Tony, as if nothing had changed since high school.
That never let him forget Steve so that Tony would be thinking of him and only him to his death, to Steve’s death, to their world’s as he would Tony.
Steve didn’t answer even as the seconds trickled by excruciatingly slow, every second an uncomfortable weight stacked on Tony’s back, trying to bend it forward.
The ground around Steve glistened with dark red pools, and a large, wicked slash cut diagonally across his abdomen, threads of the shredded uniform sticking to it. Blood poured out of the laceration steadily and profusely.
“You always say that, and I can’t help but worry anyway,” she said, and all he could bring himself to do at that was smile back and turn his hand to hold hers.
If he just turned around slowly, if he was careful, he could pull Steve to shore like he always did.
Steve let out a short miserable laugh. There was a cruel, unfamiliar edge to it, but Tony was intimately acquainted with the sound to know that the dagger was aimed inward. “No, you don’t.” He bowed his head, his neck bent with a burden of his own making. The late afternoon sun limned him in gold but didn’t penetrate his skin; he was beautiful and cold as a statue, as immobile. “There’s something else I wanted to talk to you about,” he said after a while, so quietly it was as though he were talking to himself. “This isn’t how I wanted to tell you, but it doesn’t really matter what I want anymore.”
He hadn’t thought about his soulmate since then, too busy trying to survive basic to think of anything else. But it was the night before he would receive the serum, and in the peace and quiet of the empty room with everyone still at dinner, he found himself dwelling on his words again. He guessed that it made sense. He wasn’t sure what would happen tomorrow. Wasn’t sure if he would be a different man. Wasn’t sure if he would live to see the end of the day.
Tony’s eyes fluttered shut and he leaned in as if he could feel Steve against his skin. “You, of all people, could never hurt me. You never once wanted to.” He put his hand over Steve’s cupped one, and Steve could pretend, as they were a hair’s width apart, that he could feel the calluses of Tony’s fingers, the warmth that Tony had always radiated when he was alive. “And you can’t do anything to me even if you did. Though I can possess
He had been afraid of that, hadn’t he, with his dreams of Tony looming over him, the secret, gnawing worry that he was falling short. One day, he wouldn’t be enough for Tony, wouldn’t be able to catch up to him. But it was good that he had stumbled and Tony had outpaced him, too far down the path to reach. He didn’t want to follow Tony, not down this road, not when Tony’s idea of a future was one secured by the genocide of entire worlds.
“Yes, you did. Tony went up on the stage, and you shouted everyone down with an outrageous bid. No one wanted to fight you on it, remember? I thought Loki would, at least.” Jan held up three fingers, putting them down one by one as she rattled off her reasons. “I mean, he has the money, he loves antagonizing everyone, and he always raids Tony’s fridge. I’m surprised
Steve knew Sam was offering to check up on him after, and he was grateful for it although if his hunch was right, it would be unnecessary.
“The end of the world and here we are,” Tony said, not turning to look at him. “Still alive after it ended.” He gazed at the wall, his eyes unseeing. Thousand-yard stare. That was what they had called it after the war. It was an apt phrase; Tony was far away, somewhere isolated and unreachable. “So many people died,” he added softly. There was something in his voice, a suggestion of self-recrimination that leached through.
“Scatter,” he said, and he felt Thanos’s atoms disperse until he dissolved into nothing. He felt Thanos’s allies lose purpose and fly home. He felt the Stones shove back as he tried to destroy them.
He wanted to hold it, but there was something grimy stuck under his nails and his entire hand was coated with a layer of something thick and suffocating. He couldn’t touch Steve like that.
Tony glanced at him, startled, and Steve could tell he was ready to say no, his heart already sinking, but something on his face must have changed Tony’s mind because he frowned and then bit his lip.
“You look good,” Natasha said. “Relatively speaking.” It would almost be funny the way that she and Steve scrutinized every change, every injury in sync like an unsettling pair of overly observant blond twins, if it weren’t for how it made his skin crawl.
And underneath it all, this close to the man he had been afraid he would never see again, a scent that Steve could only describe as
The question looms between them, eclipsing everything but its present and future. Nothing is as important as Steve’s answer and nothing is as meaningless. It changes everything. It changes nothing.
fight against the impossible, and no one possessed the strategic mind and war experience that he did. And they were at their best when they pushed each other to come up with methods the other hadn’t considered. When they challenged each other by talking things through.
Tony didn’t know what to say, years’ worth of words that had gone unsaid crammed in his throat, dying before they reached his lips. All he knew was that he couldn’t let Steve go without saying anything.
Steve took his right hand and held it, saying and doing nothing for a brief moment before he replied. “Okay,” he said quietly.
Tony is, most likely, a ghost speaking from the past. Natasha tries very hard not to think of his body floating in space, an empty and abandoned corpse devoid of his spark.
He wanted to see what a future with Steve would be like. He hoped it would be a bright, happy one. He knew that they both would work towards making that happen. All that had happened to lead up to this point had taught him that.
Steve was chatting with Rhodey and Natasha at the other end of the room, but as soon as Tony entered, he broke off and glanced at the door as though he were psychically attuned to Tony’s whereabouts.
He had been going about it wrong. It was the future that always held the answers and there, he had some semblance of control. There, in the promising world that didn’t exist yet, he could figure things out on his own.
It was quiet this far out of town, the only sounds accompanying him the mournful hoot of an owl and the rustle of leaves as a brisk wind skimmed the trees. The house, when it appeared beyond the last bend of trees like an apparition, was just as subdued. It looked empty, and as he called out Tony’s name, Steve wondered if he had made a mistake. It had been a few years after all, and Tony could have left.
He didn’t have to fix everything. That was what Steve would tell him. The Avengers would figure it out somehow; they always did when they had one another.
There were people who would die for him. Tony knew that because he would do the same for them, because their hearts were the same when it came down to that. But Steve, Steve would live for him if he asked. He would do his best to do that, to stay at his side, to come back if he couldn’t.
, his father scoffed in his head, and Tony thought of how Howard had reacted when he had come home and found out that his son’s words had come in.
This was what the Greeks had gone on about. The shackles came off during those nights and uninhibited, with no reason to hold back, Steve was fearsome, a myth come to life.
Even with his eyes closed, he could still see the fear and betrayal bleeding across Tony’s face like an open wound, and he didn’t have to look at him to know that they were still there as he slid off of him, fatigued and hurt in more ways than one, as he stood up and wrenched his shield out of his chest, as he walked away from him without looking back once.
He had arrived later than he had hoped. The sun was already setting, molten gold pooling at his feet as he made his way through the trees.
His head split into two, splintering into more pieces than he could count, and darkness fell over him until he felt nothing more.
It comes out as little more than a whisper, thin and delicate enough that it should break from all that it holds but doesn’t. Everything he needs to say is contained in those two syllables alone, and Tony must hear it because he lurches forward, more out of instinct than conscious thought. He lifts his hand before catching himself as if he needs, just as much as Steve does, to know that this is real, neither an illusion nor a dream that he’d wake up from.
He couldn’t say the same for Steve’s words; whatever they were, he had meant everything he had said. But even so, Steve would be holding onto something that he wasn’t sure he could give Steve anymore.
They stayed like that, not saying anything and not letting go, sitting together in the too empty room, waiting for dawn to arrive.
Back to the basics, back to what Fury had said all those years ago except that they were bigger now, with more and more powered individuals stepping up everyday to give help where it was needed. A world of Avengers, Tony thought, and it had to be enough to save an entire universe.
In her mind, Tony faces all of the deaths he wasn’t supposed to come back from but did—Afghanistan and palladium poisoning and the wormhole.
Vision was gone, the Mind Stone plucked from his head. Wanda had died shortly after, taking out hundreds in her grief, before Thanos had crushed her. Countless others, the last line of defense, had fallen.
He faced the window, and Tony followed his gaze. The others were gone. The sun was low in the sky, the grounds tranquil and undisturbed. Years ago, when the original team had been together, he had caught Steve doing the same thing at the tower. His fingers had traced a pattern across the glass as if he were superimposing his city over the one in front of him, trying to excavate familiar lines from under the sweeping sprawl that had grown over his home. Tony wondered if he was doing that now, pulling forth a memory, sliding a transparency over the window.
Jim breaks the silence. His voice is steady even though he must be as terrified and elated and heartbroken as she and Steve are.
Bucky leaned forward, winter blue eyes wide with wonder. He opened his mouth, shut it, and then opened it again. Steve would have teased him if he hadn’t felt just as stunned.
And although this had been the reason he had come out here and he didn’t want Tony to stay, “You sure?” Steve asked.
He had spent so much time imagining Tony’s wounds that the intimate familiarity made them his own. The stab of thorns and spiked leaves as sharp as the betrayal that slid between his ribs. The blood coating Tony’s tongue as unpleasant as the bile coating his when his memories had returned. The draw of every breath as painful for Tony as it was for him, Tony’s throat as abraded by growths as his was by yelling.
Later, when he had gotten out of the shower and put on his band without glancing at his wrist once, Tony went over his conversation with Rhodey again.
He squeezed his eyes shut and sucked in a sharp breath before he turned around, taking care to appear collected.
In this new world that he woke up to, things had changed. It wasn’t like how it used to be, with people hiding their marks until they found their soulmates. The only people who tended to hide them back then were those who hadn’t found their soulmates yet or those whose words were too private or too risky to reveal. But most people proudly showed their words to the world now, and there were more bare wrists than not these days.
He should get some Advil. And coffee. There was a stained circle near the bottom of the mug, and the small amount of coffee below the dark ring had gone stale a while ago. Food would be good too. He hadn’t eaten since the morning, having nibbled on some fruit before getting thoroughly sidelined throughout the afternoon. They had been sitting out on the table for hours, and the thought of biting into a warm strawberry was unappetizing.
He folded his chestplate back, waiting as it retreated into his undersuit fast and slick like liquid metal, and grabbed his band, throwing it to the side, not caring where it landed as he pulled off Steve’s glove and then his band.
, he read under the street lights blinking on in the velvet evening. He ran his thumb reverently over his wrist, thinking about how, out of the hundreds of millions of people in the world, the two of them were somehow chosen to be destined for each other. He felt small and significant at once, set apart from the rest of the world even with rows of cramped apartment buildings sandwiching him on both sides and people milling about on the street. He was separate and singular—alone—but he had never felt less lonely than he did in that moment.
It was why they were in the situation they were in now. That, more than anything, made up Steve’s mind.
So long as what he said happened, so long as Steve survived and they won, he could deal with the rest.
The biggest block of cheese that Steve had ever seen in his entire life greeted him as soon as he got to his room after a long day of class. He stood in the doorway, nonplussed.
He’s talking and she should concentrate, but all she can focus on is the limitless darkness beyond him that she’s only seen once before. The same desperation that she felt back when she craned her neck and stared at the wormhole years ago, urging Tony to come back so she wouldn’t have to do what needed to be done, lights every single one of her nerves on fire. She feels like she condemned him to his fate again, making the call to leave him to die, leaving him no choice but to go into space alone once more.
So that it wouldn’t leave him like this, flayed open, every bit of him raw and exposed, bleeding everywhere. He felt like crying and he could if he wanted to—there was no one with him here, miles above the ocean where Steve had spent the better part of sixty years, where he bitterly wished Steve had stayed except he didn’t, not really, because he knew what that was like, dying alone in the darkness—but his chest hurt too much to even breathe and the tears didn’t come as if he had forgotten how to shed them. They welled up inside him, rising past chest level up to his throat, up past his mouth, his nose, and he wanted to tear out of his skin, to pry open his rib cage and flee his body so that he wouldn’t suffocate on them.
“Here’s your indisputable proof,” she seemed to say as she had brushed her thumb over his word, but his mother had never been a scientist. Indisputable proof meant it was tried and tested, and it never had been, until now.
Steve pulled out the chair beside him. It felt like both a command and an invitation. Tony walked over, through the too big kitchen, where Wanda and Vision used to try recreating the dishes from Wanda’s childhood once a week, Wanda and Vision who were d—
A pause in its frenetic pace. A deep sigh. Midtown stopped moving, staying put so Steve could drink it in all he wanted, as long as he wanted. It became a postcard whose fabric he was stitched into. It became an artist’s subject, a still life. Under Steve’s observant eye, all fell away so that there was no pretense, no smoke and mirrors or distracting movements to hide behind, just its naked form.
Steve’s insides churned uneasily with familiar, years-old guilt. He would never forget the way that Tony had looked at him as he left.
Their eyes locked and instantly Steve was all but seventeen again, heart pounding unevenly in his chest, painfully awkward in his skin, as he asked Tony out the day before Homecoming after years of pining. Autumn had come early that year, the streets thickly carpeted with fallen leaves and the air sharp with the hint of oncoming frost, and Tony had stood there, almost at the very spot he was standing now, a wrench in his right hand and dark grease stains smearing his cheek and shirt, more beautiful than their surroundings—more beautiful than anything Steve had ever seen.
This wasn’t a ship they had the fortune to find or steal; Rocket had recognized it. Tony’s wearing a well-worn jacket she’s never seen before, and his shirt is too big and hangs too loosely on him and not just from weight loss. Rocket and the blue woman who walked down with Tony stare at each other too long and too silently. Peter Parker’s nowhere to be seen.
Tony had always been like that. He took what was his, but he gave everything else, and sometimes—many times—what should have belonged to him away too. And when it came to the people he loved, he always gave without expecting anything in return, and never was it more true than with Steve.
—you know what, I have an excuse for not being up-to-date on ghost movies. I’m dead,” Tony huffed before he grew serious again, just as Steve knew he would if he waited the nervous chatter out.
Steve wondered how long it took for Tony to scrub the kid’s ashes from his skin. If part of him had refused to do that at first, to get every last bit of him out from underneath his fingernails, because it was all he had left of him.
Tony unlocked the first, and then minutes—hours, weeks, months—later, the second. The Soul Stone sat, cushioned in the center of the box, innocuous and unassuming in appearance. It was hard to imagine that something so tiny could hold such enormous, terrible power, but he was reminded of Quill’s warning, his account of the Power Stone and how it had nearly destroyed him, even with his father’s blood. He couldn’t touch it directly.
Steve smiled at him, soft even under the fluorescent bathroom light but not quite happy. Something ached underneath, too muted for Tony to make sense of it. They were still strangers to each other in the end.
She called him narcissistic and said he didn’t play well with others, that she recommended Iron Man but not Tony Stark, but it’s Tony who’s in that suit. Tony, who flew that bomb out into space without hesitation, not sure of what he would meet and the end he would meet. Tony whom she abandoned to the wolves twice. Three times, she corrects, as the phone lights up a belligerent red again, no doubt Ross bullheadedly refusing to leave them alone.
It made Steve think, these days, of the state of Tony’s lungs. His ravaged failure of a heart. How the hatred that had burst alive in him was hot enough to awaken dormant seeds in Tony even from a distance. He imagined roots burrowing into muscle. Ropy stems spreading parasitically, wrapping Tony’s lungs and squeezing Tony’s heart, creeping up Tony’s throat. Leaves and buds unfurling in the flower bed of Tony’s chest, the crimes, the guilt, the black decay of his thoughts the highest quality of fertilizer.
Steve kept himself from tearing off his glove, from touching his wrist at all even though he wanted to more than anything, just like he always did when he needed something to hold onto. They weren’t his to have anymore, at least not in that way. He clenched his fists at his sides, staring out the window and trying hard to stay as still as possible even if the tension that had seeped into every inch of his body was so strong that he felt as though he would break into pieces any minute, a boulder shattered by ice.
“Well, don’t mind me. I’m just gonna…” He gestured with the hand holding the apple as though he were going to eat it, not put it back the minute Steve left the room.
“What did it feel like?” Bucky finally asked. His eyes were glued to Steve’s wrist as though he couldn’t tear his gaze away.
When he has enough composure to continue, his voice trembles with shaky reproach and regret, with the loss of everything—of Tony, their friends, his home, his purpose, billions of innocents, of everything—he had to endure.
Sometimes he managed to brush a few on their way back, but they were as lifeless and dull as he felt in his waking hours. Opaque flashes of gray, murky and unsaturated.  Fleeting glimpses that slipped through his outstretched fingers, leaving him alone on a remote shore once they were gone.
Steve curled his fingers over the simple, gunmetal gray band and clasped it tightly, remembering the day that his mother had given it to him. She had stopped wearing it long ago, she and his father exchanging their words not long after they had met each other, but she had kept both bands in her jewelry box to give to Steve when the time came.
“Was I yours?” he wanted to ask, but he wasn’t sure if he really wanted to know. Peggy always had a band on every time he visited, her wrist never bare in all the time he had known her. Steve didn’t know whether that was because she wanted to keep her mark private as some people did even after finding their soulmate or because she wanted to keep it from him.
He gripped his wrist tighter, hard enough that the tips of his nails faded into bleached crescents. All he could do was stay rooted to the spot, his jackrabbiting heart forcing his breaths to come in labored and ragged.
He observed Thanos raising the Gauntlet to the sky before swinging it down to take out a fleet of massive tanks in one go.
He knew, logically, that his words could have a different meaning from the one he had ascribed to them and that some people didn’t put as much weight behind them as he did.
He could feel Steve’s heartbeat as though it were his, could understand just how hard Steve was fighting to stay with him.
She hopes that he knows she wasn’t choosing between Steve and him when she let Steve and James escape, and he must because he’s holding her like he doesn’t want to let go.
It would have been so easy even if he would have never done it—would have never wanted to do it—and Tony had known that. Steve had expected rage when he ripped off Tony’s faceplate, but fear had greeted him instead, Tony’s eyes wild and wide with it as he had brought his hands up to his face to protect himself.
“I know,” he said because he did and because he could give Steve that. Enough time had passed that most of him understood why Steve had made the mistakes he did.
He never could, now that Steve thought about it. Tony had always hidden behind masks and bravado when he felt that he needed to. It had taken a while for him to see past that. Once he did, though, he had been able to read Tony like a book, to see when he was joking and when he was putting on his public persona or was wary of showing that he cared too much.
In all the chaos that ensued after the Hydra spy had murdered Dr. Erskine and fled with him and Peggy hot on his tail, Steve had forgotten about his band. It laid there on the table, unharmed in all the wreckage and tinier than he remembered it to be. He scooped it up and cradled it in his palm.
Steve nodded at his group, hanging back as they climbed into the Quinjet. He was waiting for something.
But he could change the meaning of his word, make it hurt less. He could make it mean nothing like it did for Steve, if he even had Tony’s words on his wrist.
He was Tony’s, which meant—which had to mean—that Tony was his. His happiness was Tony’s happiness. His pain was Tony’s pain. His love was Tony’s. His body, Tony’s.
Tony grabbed an apple from the fruit basket on the counter and pretended that that was what he was there for. Pretended to be wide awake, fresh off a good night’s rest, not startled awake by nightmares. Bright-eyed, bushy-tailed, ready to face a new day—that was him.
Maybe he had to go smaller. Rearrange things and erase his and Steve’s words. Rearrange things so that he didn’t love Steve.
He really needed to stop romanticizing things. He hadn’t even been around the compound all that much back then.
Not too far from where they’re sitting, Wanda and Vision’s plants bend in the wind, still here, still growing. A few shy nubs poke out between the more mature ones, the palest green as though they’re not sure of their existence yet. They remind her of Vision phasing through the walls, the jewel tones of his skin washed out, and the tentativeness between him and Wanda at the start of their tenure with the Avengers and later, their changed relationship.
“I didn’t. I don’t know what’s wrong with it,” Steve replied. He moved his arm away from himself gingerly, careful not to jar it in any way, before freezing. Black ink peeked out from under his thumb, stark against his fair skin.
He looked at Bucky and remembered the conversation they had on the way to the place where he would gain and lose everything at once, the way he had questioned whether he deserved to be saved, calmly and without an ounce of self-pity, like it was only logical that he didn’t.
They survey catastrophe, hundreds here lost, even more elsewhere, and reduce it to digestible pieces.
There was a clarity to the brisk air. Everything was sharper and cleaner, more crisply defined, but it all smeared into a blur, smudging into the background, because there was only Tony in the sky, only Iron Man’s brilliant crimson and gold form standing out in sharp relief even in the watery daylight.
Panic made him want to refuse Steve’s offer; he was still afraid that they had overseen something or they would be caught off-guard, that if he took one moment to breathe now that everything started and was on the verge of snowballing, he would miss out on what happened and it would be too late for him to respond. FOMO on something that wasn’t even fun.
Tony stared at him impassively, as if trying to judge whether Steve was telling the truth, before he smiled, soft and a little crooked. “Okay,” he said with a finality that told Steve he had made his decision.
Steve hadn’t told him his secret because he wasn’t sure how Tony would respond, but Tony couldn’t because he wasn’t sure what his response would be to Steve’s. It would be unfair to bring it up, pointless in a different way. Steve wanted him, maybe even thought he loved him because Tony was his soulmate. All telling him would accomplish would be to give him false hope when he wasn’t sure he would be able to give Steve what he wanted.
Tony’s answer was in the gray, conflicted area between yes and no. He didn’t want to be hurt by Steve again. He wanted to give him a second chance. He didn’t want to let his walls down. He wanted to believe in Steve.
It’s so quiet out here. The grass rustles in the breeze, the only perceptible sound for miles, the air rippling through it the only change. Had it not been for how well the grounds have been maintained, the compound would feel abandoned.
There was a question hanging off of the end of Steve’s words. Even if he was careful not to probe, he stripped Tony bare.
Peggy’s face softened, inquiry dissolving into an understanding that he suspected had a story behind it.
“In case of emergencies,” Tony said, and it came out more caustic than he had assumed it would. “He said if I ever need him, he’d be there. No matter what,” he added flatly at Rhodey’s sharp expression.
He should have refused Steve’s help, but Steve had insisted that someone cover him, saying that he was going to be open to attacks while he worked on the Gauntlet.
Two years. Two years of silence. Two years during which Steve could have told him. He had the letter, the phone.
“You seem to have held together okay.” He waved a hand at them carelessly as though he hadn’t thoroughly scanned them for injuries too. “No big injuries, new looks. You know better than bleached eyebrows, Romanoff, but that beard isn’t half bad, Rogers. I guess with all that downtime between illegal missions, you had plenty of time for maintenance and buying beard oil.”
, a distant part of his mind said, and if he could feel anything at all or rather, stop from feeling too much, maybe he would be a bit hysterical, the way he was all those years ago, when they had been in the lab and he shouted about the real game up there and Steve had said, with a resoluteness that was infuriating, that they would do it together.
But Steve was convinced that that wouldn’t be him. He loved his soulmate too much. He would be happy with whoever they were and whatever his words meant because having a mark meant that he was loved, that he was enough, and that was all that mattered in the end.
He doesn’t have powers and he isn’t the strongest of them all, but Steve considered him Earth’s best defender for a reason and so does she.
Together, he thought, and maybe that word was his to make his own, to be whatever he wanted to make of it. Raw material that he had at his disposal to create something new.
Clint flew past Tony, smashing into the ruined shell of a building behind him. He remained motionless where he fell and at that speed and angle, if the initial hit hadn’t killed him, the collision would have. Tony had to stop himself from thinking about Laura and the kids, about his and Clint's clumsily patched-up relationship that no longer had a chance of being salvaged.
Tony poked at the dish listlessly, his stomach clenching. “Yeah. He just told me that Thanos is about to get his hands on the Power Stone if he hasn’t already. I need to get everyone up to speed.”
He had a moment to wonder whether he had gone too far when Tony tensed, but Tony didn’t remove his hand and, after a moment, replied.
For the first time, Steve wondered if it was because Tony was afraid of it meaning something, the way that it did now, when he couldn’t keep how he really felt from bleeding through.
Did Steve ever really care? Maybe. But not in the way he wanted him to and more out of obligation and guilt than anything. He understood that now. He just didn’t see it because he wanted to read into things that weren’t there, and that had blinded him so that he missed what was.
And he had the team. Even if something happened, there was someone who would be on shift, someone to respond. He trusted them to act and the others him because at the end of the day, they were united by a common enemy and a common goal. The Avengers had always been good at coming together when they needed to protect the world, and this time they had seen the threat ahead of time and had prepared extensively to stop it.
Hope was dangerous. It was hard to kill even in the bleakest and most dire of situations. He should know.
Around the world, around every known and unknown corner of the universe, this is all anyone will find. A death toll that rises and will continue to rise—billions and trillions and higher still—untold numbers both horrifying and meaningless in their enormity.
She’s not sure how Pepper will take this. She doesn’t know how Pepper feels about what happened with the Accords or what Tony, Jim, or Vision might have told her. She hasn’t seen Pepper at the compound since they came back from Wakanda.
“Yeah, you told me. Black eye, broken nose, blood dripping from my mouth with Schmidt towering over me, and I was the prettiest thing you’d ever seen.”
Tony didn’t even have time to react to the request. His brain caught up with him a half-step too slow as Steve grabbed his hands before he finished talking anyway; instinct overrode consciousness as he tried to pull away in surprise, but Steve’s grip was firm as he took off his gloves and tossed them to the floor.
“You’re not stupid for expecting your word to mean what it says. It’s on him for not living up to it.”
“Stop,” he said, and he felt everyone freeze on the field. He felt everyone’s wounds stitch together, the bleeding staunched. He felt everyone pulled from the brink of death.
What had he known about loss? What did the loss of his relationship with Tony matter in the face of losing Tony entirely?
“Tony,” he breathes out like an apology and a wish, like there’s nothing in the world but the name on his lips and the half-dead man in front of him.
The dull ache in his head was going to flare up into a full-blown migraine. He pressed his knuckles into his eyes, trying to focus on that pain instead of the one inside his skull.
For a minute, none of them know what to say. They don’t know if Tony gave them information about his ship to track him down and rescue him or to bring him home for burial.
Tony watched it disappear over the treetops before speaking again, his words picking up speed. “Everyone left for college, and I knew you wouldn’t want to talk about it with anyone—you never do—and well, I told you once that I’d stick around as long as I could, as long as you needed me. And no matter what people say about me, I don’t—I don’t back out on promises like that.”
