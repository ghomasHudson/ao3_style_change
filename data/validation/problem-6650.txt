“Boys, focus," Natasha scolds even though she clearly wants to laugh. Or, at least Tony thinks she does. "Tony, you’re way too high-profile for this. You're both too high-profile for this.” She's frowning as she hands the file over to Steve. “Why’d they choose you?”
“Thought you’d never ask,” Steve says, snapping Tony out of his panic. There’s a soft smile on his face when Tony turns to look up at him, a bit dumbfounded.
"Let me up, let me up," Tony demands, pushing at Steve's shoulders. Steve glances down at him in disbelief, not knowing what to say to derail whatever suicidal plan Tony is probably concocting.
“Oh he seemed to expect that. He said he was putting something in motion, and he asked how he could get in touch with me.”
“Yes. But only if it can be done quietly. Gotta keep an eye on the runner too,” Tony said his eyelids already dropping closed.
“This was the call to commence the very first series of love taps. I was gagged at the time… so I couldn’t say anything. Point is, nobody knows,” Tony said.
The beat down was neither better nor worse than the few Steve had overseen in his new life as a crime lord. And yet it felt a little off. He hadn’t even looked at the shape hunched into the chair as Bucky and Clint started off on him. The man had not made a single sound through the gag that covered the lower half of his face. Not a whimper, or even a grunt. But he had looked up at him once and Steve had gasped. Like something electric twanging near his spine. Then the chair had overbalanced and the man’s head had bounced against the floor. Steve winced. That was not right.
She raised a shapely eyebrow at him, “Why not, after all I only took a bullet for you. Not like you owe me anything.”
Steve let out a breath he didn’t know he had been holding. Tony was half-way in through the hatch, smiling at him, “Fixed it,” he said into his comm. “Lift now.” The ship lurched upwards and Tony paused to steady himself. Just then, a huge explosion in the schloss below sent a concussive blast rippling across the body of the zepplin and the Iron Man shuddered. Tony’s grip faltered.
But the snow burned his skin with its freezing fire and his mind had sent him back in time, to when he was a young boy and buried in a similar grave. That time, when he had dug himself out, he had left all his humanity behind. All his memories. His soul mark.
But the man was not done. He held himself straight and took a deep breath. “I am not asking for forgiveness. I don’t really deserve it. It was a really shitty thing to do so… beat up an innocent and defenseless man. However, I am really sorry and will do my best to… make amends? If you could… I am sorry, Mr Stark.”
“She said something about a plan… I’m not sure what your goals are here…,” Steve finished. He sounded lame, he knew that. Perhaps it had been a mistake to come alone. He didn't usually get so tongue-tied.
Pepper and Rhodey, when they came to visit later that day, looked a strange mix of angry and confused. “You look a strange mix of furious and curious… there should be a word for it. Fucurious. Or Cufurious? Yes, that’s better. That is how you look. What have you learned?”
There was a kiss and some tender lovemaking. Which became frantic and messy when control, like Time, and Space, became a fractious thing.
Steve was standing on the rooftop watching the fog moving over the city. Nat dropped silently from a passing zeppelin. Sometimes he thought she had a personal bet to make him flinch. He knew he had one not to give her the pleasure.
Tony looked around at the room. It must have been luxurious once. The room, though it wasn’t over large, would have fit well in a post-Renaissance palace. The gilded art, the ornate furniture, the decor, the air of genteel decay, even the fine china he held delicately between his fingers were all remnants of an age of rich comfort. It was old now, a little frayed around the edges, but clean and well looked after. The room was loved. And Tony always felt a sense of calm sitting here, sipping tea, and listening to Jarvis talk of some obscure but interesting piece of art or history.
“I don’t know what to say Steve,” Bucky was honest that way. Steve smiled, “Don’t worry. I’ll be fine. Clint left ok?”
Steve was brought out of his reverie with a bang. Tony had been watching a liquid boil in a test tube, frowning as the liquid turned from yellow to a shade of rust red and then ducked under the table just as the test tube exploded. Steve rushed to help Tony up, checking him for injuries while the man in question began laughing. “Well that’s not how you make coolant,” he coughed waving his hands to blow away the acrid smoke. Steve led him coughing and wheezing out of the lab and said, “Are you alright? Look at me, Tony. Are you ok?”
Rhodey, his dear friend, took pity on him. “Well, here is Mr Stark. I think he cleared his schedule to hear that apology. Go ahead Captain, he is all yours.”
Space is a fractious thing. However hard you try to grab on to things, they feel too far away. Sinking your fingernails into the feeling and pulling it closer, closer, closer and yet the space never closes up enough.
, he thought. The man was tall and looked strong and handsome and oh god he glowed.. Did he know he shone? Like there was light or magic or something beautiful inside and it leaked from his skin? Tony felt his heart beat wild. It was like he could sense the power thrumming inside the stranger. And he realized he was afraid. Of the stranger and his strange power and also the fact that the man wore no mask.
“No. No more,” he said louder than he had intended. “This is not going to work. We won’t break him this way. We’ll have to think of something else. Nat what’s the exit strategy?”
. This was not a world in which you could make a life together, but you sure as hell could die together. It had been a good dream. A nice sentiment. Then he had grown up some more and decided that it was not going to happen for him and he was alright with that. He had money, friends and a life of sorts. He had more than most and he was a version of happy. It was enough.
The truck that was coming closest to the Hydra gas station would ostensibly also carry an adamantium artifact dug up by some scavenger. Tony had been spoofing a lengthy correspondence haggling over the purchase. It worried Tony to think that though he had no proof the mole was in his correspondence, he was taking it for granted that it was so. This feeling of being watched and going about life as if everything was ok, was not ok.
He managed to look up in time to see Steve. His face fierce, hands around Obie’s throat. Obie struggling. Obie clawing at Steve’s hands. Obie going pink. Red. Purple. Still.
Tony was trying to make sense of the jumbled dream he had just woken up from. It had been a funeral for his mother. But the pinched little face in the casket was not Mom. Besides he remembered being bigger, and there had been two caskets and a lot more people. And why the fuck was he feeling happy and sad. The answer came before he finished asking the question. The Cap. Fucking lunatic. Happy at his mother’s funeral? Little psycho thug.
Tony looked up at him. His eyes were red and watering. But he was smiling. “I think I invented tear gas,” he coughed.
Tony said nothing. Steve closed his eyes. Tony watched the glint at the the corner of his eyes, trapped between long lashes, catching the light and refracting into colours.
He cut off a length of rope and slowly lowered the supplies first and then himself down the ruined castle wall to the ledge. His luck held. The snowbike was mostly undamaged but for a busted head light, a misalignment in the handlebar and few scrapes on the bodywork. It took Steve almost a half hour to get it right away up, his shoulder screaming with the agony of the effort.
And then he caught Tony’s ankle just as the tangle of rope in his hands pulled taut. The combined weight of the two men and the sudden jerk of the rope dislocated Steve’s shoulder. He gave a hiss of pain and looked up at the zepplin, still climbing away from the carnage of the schloss below. Wrapping his legs tightly around Tony’s knees, Steve freed his other hand and began the process of climbing up the rope. He remembered that the rope was not attached to anything at the other end. Only the tangle of wires kept it from unraveling all the way. He began climbing faster and suddenly there was a thump and the weight between his legs went slack.
“A lot,” sighed Rhodes, “and very little. We know what they do, how they do it and quite a lot about what they are as a group. But individual histories are sketchy at best. The leader calls himself their captain, his second is this guy called Barnes and they have another joker, I mean that literally, the clown ran away from the circus—he’s called Clint Barton. There is a Russian assassin, I kid you not, called Romanov and there are a few dishonourable discharges in the mix—a kid called Sam Wilson and another called Thor Odinson. They have a few undercovers as well—someone they call Wasp, and another they call Witch. Nobody knows anything about them. They are vigilantes Tony. They attack and destroy militia HQs. They have been operating under a year. Mostly low profile and quick hits. But they’ve been getting bolder. They took major casualties in a raid against Hydra militia last month.”
Banner frowned at the mention of magic. This was not his field. But he agreed with the specialist on one fact at least. “You are right about the overdose of the sedative, doctor. It had been injected directly into the bloodstream instead of subcutaneous which would have been more appropriate. So it was indeed fortunate that the worst of its effects were absorbed by Rogers instead,” said Banner.
“He has a proposition for us. He says, and these are his words, ‘thanks for letting me know about the rot in my operation. But it is my problem and I am dealing with it and I will appreciate if in the meanwhile and forever more our paths do not cross again.’ The man said it with a straight face. I laughed so hard I almost pulled a stitch. I told him he could run his little empire from a guarded compound as he pleased, but the world outside was not his bitch.”
“And now for the vinegar,” said Tony as he dribbled the liquid into the yellow powder, which immediately began to smoke and like magic dissolved into a brilliant earthy shade of red.
But Tony Stark did not speak. Not to Nat. Not to Bucky and not to Clint. Not after the next beating. Nor the next one. Steve watched for a while but he did not speak to the man again. Tony did not curse or scream or even grunt. Steve felt weak and powerless and by the third day he had given up. When Bucky came with word that the Stark organization was offering rewards and hunting for news of their boss, Steve knew that time had run out. When Nat suggested injecting a psychotropic drug Steve had a private panic attack. He hid it well but in his mind he was back in the prison begging Dr Erskine, yes that had been the old man’s name.
Their mouths fell open. “Are you telling me, they kept you for three days, beating the shit out of you and starving you, after they found out that you were their soulmate?” Rhodey was thrumming with anger.
“So is that how it is going to be? You are going to come rushing in and stand there glaring quietly? You want to work these people, don’t you? What exactly is the plan here?” Rhodey asked.
But it would be over soon. One way or another, the meetings would come to an end. And he would no longer get to watch Tony glare.
“Yeah, I get that now. Couldn’t understand why you were happy at your mother’s funeral,” Tony grumbled.
When Tony returned home late that night he lay down in bed to collate all the data he had failed to collect. Dr Stephen Strange was right. There was precious little data to make any conclusive statement on the whole soulmate question.
The bag on his head smelled of vomit. There was a hint of sweat, spit and blood in the bouquet, but the overpowering element was vomit. It made Tony gag. But the cloth gag in his mouth was tight, making an attempt to breathe through his mouth utterly futile. Kidnappers could be so inconsiderate. And needlessly violent. Time ticked by. He got used to the smell and the dull ache in his head where he hit it as he fell. The stuffy bag felt like it was making his hair sweat. A bead of water tracked a path down into his eyes. He blinked. How long did they plan on leaving him here?
“He will be fine. Now that you are here,” Pepper said, grabbing his arm and dragging Steve to an inner room. "How are YOU?" she asked. Steve did not reply.
There was no point rushing Nat. She’d speak when she was ready. She took Bucky’s beer from his hand and finished it for him. Then she settled down and told a story. Nat was good with stories. Very descriptive. She even brought a map to illustrate the route. How the truck went out of the precinct, how Tony Stark’s man followed at a discreet distance, but then became over confident and got spotted. How the shooting began and how Nat jumped in. Got shot, lost the truck and then got herself captured.
“I had heard rumours about Hydra Militia smuggling weapons into the country, but I had no idea they were using your organization. I am sorry to hear about your, hmm staffing problems,” Jarvis said. Tony smiled. He could hear the italics there.
“Shut up. I’ll tell you later,” Pepper said to him and then turned to Tony. “Fine let’s see how long that will work for. So he doesn’t wear a cuff then? You saw his words?”
“Look at me,” she said gently, reaching up to hold his face in her palms. “He is alright. We had to sedate him to make sure you had a chance. He was going berserk with fear and worry…”
It took him a few moments to get his bearing. He had fallen through a narrow gap in the trees into a snowdrift and was now lying a foot deep in snow. Carefully raising his head over the edge of the snow, he waited for his eyes to adjust to the dark. There were trees all around, and a ridge to his right. From beyond the trees on his left the sky glowed a dull orange. He could not tell if it was dawn in the east, or the remains of the burning castle.
The door opened again and Tony’s soulmate stepped in. He picked up the stool and placed it in front of the chair. Too close. Tony straightened up some more. The man sat down and Tony was relieved to see that at least he was not glowing any more. But he was still beautiful. Stop that. Tony glared at the man.
It would be nice if epiphanies made the course of life less prosaic. But just because you are in love, the twisted ankle is no less a bother. And mud is always mud. However rich and brown it may be. However much it may remind Steve of a certain someone’s rich brown eyes.
Tony wanted to tell him that the good cop, bad cop routine needed two people to make it work. He bit his tongue. The wound reopened. The taste of fresh blood made him want to spit. So he did. A streak of blood and spit on his soulmate’s pretty face. The man had closed his eyes but he did not flinch or even make a move to wipe it from his face. God but he was beautiful. He opened his eyes and looked at Tony.
“I had an accident and I invented something. There should be a word for it... accivention?” said Tony.
“Thanks Jarvis. You know there are only a few aches and pains… I am almost completely recovered. That Dr Banner is quite the genius you know. Where did you find the man?” Tony asked.
Steve collapsed into the chair Dr Banner had vacated and held Tony’s uninjured hand in a gentle clasp. Steve was still shivering but he could breathe again. Tony was alright.
“You thought that I would go quietly. Well, may be I would. But I’m taking you with,” he grinned and pressed a needle into Tony’s neck.
Steve got it right that night. Because, you see, brown has a bit of gold and red. That is a secret very few people know.
The rope jerked in his hands. The moment, like the rope between his fingers, began unspooling. The open deck hatch was a much larger target than the schloss arrow loop had been. Steve didn’t think. He just hoisted Tony up until he had his boyfriend on his shoulder and he began swinging his body until the arc of the pendulum brought him level with the window. The rope was no longer taut. He was out of time. With the last effort he could muster, Steve aimed and threw Tony at the target.
“You should have more faith in us kids, Obie. After all we built this empire, didn’t we?” Tony was trying to smirk but suddenly his words choked out and he couldn’t breathe. His body felt paralyzed and his legs began to give way. As fell to the floor, he heard Stane’s voice, speaking in the same jovial tone as if he hadn’t just hit Tony with the sonic tazer.
Tony could wait for the mole to choose the truck, or he could make one truck an irresistible target. Option A would have meant endless waiting and the team being spread too thin. Option B, was like hunting with bait. Steve had suggested and fine-tuned that plan.
Tony went down to the hospice wing with Pepper following him and telling him to slow down and not jar his ribs. Tony opened the door to see the Gnat trying to put on a jacket and the nurse lying on the floor.
“He opened his mouth all right. Wash your face will you? Look like a creep from a horror show,” Clint said as he turned around and went away.
Steve looked down at his breakfast. Tony had dripped honey in heart shapes and they had melted into the soft fluffy pancakes leaving just the warm brown intertwined shadow hearts. Steve smiled and putting down his knife and fork rolled the top pancake and stuffed it into his mouth in two giant bites. The woody sweetness of honey, he decided, was much preferable to having it plain, with butter, or with cloying syrup. He was grinning like a lunatic by the time he finished. Then he yawned and decided he too was wiped out by last night. He settled down in bed next to Tony, pulling the sleeping form into himself. Tony snuffled.
“I can feel you exchanging glances like I were some lost puppy or something equally pathetic. Stop it. Where are we on the menace within? Who is undermining us?” Tony asked.
“I know,” Rhodes sighed as he sat down on the bed and rested his hand on Tony’s foot, “It’s all too big and still not enough. The world is broken Tony, and we are running around with little band aids.”
Tony nodded. “We’ve met the Russian. They call her Gnat,” said Tony. “No doubt because she is tiny and yet thoroughly irritating.”
For instance Bux had let slip that they wanted to hit the shipment for weapons. He would have laughed then but the kidnappers, who called themselves Howlies? Howlers?, seemed to know a lot about some of his recent missing shipments. Tony realized something was not right in his little kingdom.
“Yes, I think it can be done. It will take no more than a day. But you must act quickly. The longer the rumour is out there, the more time Hydra will have to corroborate it,” Jarvis said.
“Something happened to me, long ago, and I think it broke me inside…That is not important. What I’m trying to say is that I am not whole. And I lost more than just my memories,” Steve looked down at his wrist and rubbed a thumb over the grey lines that Tony could barely see at this distance. He didn’t have to say,
He got out of bed and went to the communal area to get a drink of water. Nat wasn’t there. But Clint was.
Steve was not satisfied until he had washed out Tony’s eyes. Then Steve sat Tony down, peering at him as if he had any idea what he was doing. Red rimmed and watering, Tony’s eyes were still beautiful. He was still laughing. And Steve learned that there is a shade of brown that is the colour of laughter and delight. It is dark and rich like well-tempered chocolate that shines like it’s solid and yet melts on the tongue.
“Band-aids on bullet wounds,” they said at the same time. They laughed softly at the old shared memory and then silence fell again.
and Pepper reacted with a shrill cheer of oh-my-god-I-am-so-happy-for-you, hand holding and on-the-spot-jumping.
“Haven’t you been listening, you little piece of shit? You are going to help me make nice with Hydra. You are going to design enough weapons to make good what was lost today, and them some. Spare me the woe-is-me I don’t do that no more crap. You will either make my bloody weapons or,” and here he pulled out a gun for effect, “you will make one bloody corpse.”
Sitwell and Rumlow are both Hydra. Rumlow was heading back across the border to Hammer’s secret manufacturing facility. There was some talk of  some new chemical weapons that they are mass producing there. Thor decided to follow Rumlow. Sitwell was setting off for a Hydra base in the mountains, so Jan is tailing him. I stayed with the truck because of the stockpile in the city… Steve they are planning to take down Shield. Hammer’s working with Hydra. And he knows all of Shield’s weaknesses. Bastard probably made sure there were plenty weaknesses to find. Is there any more beer?”
“With regard to his capabilities, well yes, he does. But there is more to a man than his talent and intelligence. Let’s just say he is notoriously bad tempered,” Jarvis said. Tony knew there was more to that story, but he also knew he was not getting any more on the subject. Besides, that was not the reason he was here.
Steve still doesn’t know why Tony didn’t burst out laughing right then as Steve showed him his palette.
Dr Strange and Dr Banner sat down to exchange notes over a cup of tea in Jarvis’ secret chamber. Jarvis hummed over his own cup.
She looked at him curiously, “It’s a graze. Not too deep. Needed stitches. She’ll survive. She’ll keep the scar. Refused painkillers. That woman is hard. What’s the matter Tony? Are you going soft on her?”
“I told him I knew where he lived. And I would come by soon,” Nat smiled reaching for Clint’s beer. He let her have it.
Tony laughed out loud then stopped grabbing his chest and taking some deep breaths. Bugger these broken ribs. “That is off off way off mainstream, you might say. Jarvis are you sending me to a kook? Will he talk to me? Where can I find him?”
The city library was a big, dull, dead sort of place. No one knew it existed. Of course people could see it was there. But so were a lot of tombs. Bombed by the militias in the last war, it still stood with a hole in the dome and a crater in the floor. But the books were still there and so was the librarian. They had just moved underground.
Steve chanted the words in his mind. Even if the words disappeared from his skin again as he shivered so much he vibrated, he willed his mind to remember them. To remember Tony. The warmth of his touch and his smile. The warmth in his brown eyes. Brown like warm honey.
“There you go,” he had said, his mouth full of a rolled up pancake as he put a stacked plate in front of Steve. Tony swayed and bopped his head, he looked at Steve with his dancing eyes and frowned.
With one foot on the ground and the other curled under him, Tony raises himself high enough that he can press his thumb against the side of Steve’s mouth, silently asking permission to take this further with the simple touch. Every breath feels like a prayer when Steve tilts his head up and presses into Tony’s hand, the pounding of Tony’s heart a chorus of wishes never spoken out loud. Tony nips at Steve’s bottom lip to the gentle pressure of Steve touching the back of his thigh.
No, Tony decides after a moment of looking Steve up and down. Not emphasize. ‘Showcase’ would be a better word. Emphasizing is not needed here.
Steve nods, throat suddenly tight with jealousy he instantly tramps down. "I just need Mr. Stark for a few minutes and then you can have him back," he says as politely as he can.
Natasha shrugs. “You’re usually good for the first few minutes, but after that I can see where he’s coming from." She brushes some hair back behind her ear, and rests her chin on her hand. "Who’s your backup?”
Once they’ve reached the car, he can hear Steve fishing out the keys from his pocket, and Tony can’t resist spinning around to draw Steve back into a kiss. The keys clatter down onto the ground, but Tony can’t bring himself to care because they’re walking backwards until his back hits the car door and Steve has his hands on Tony’s ass again.
“Good reading?” Natasha asks when he’s about half-way through, coming into the kitchen and looking way too put-together for someone in a housecoat and ratty slippers.
"Thank you for the concern, but there is no need to fear 'breaking' me," JARVIS answers, speaking up for the first time since Steve got to the party. Despite having heard JARVIS speak freely through Tony's watch or phone in public, Steve can't help but startle when his voice emanates from the hidden speakers in the room. "You will be far enough away from my servers tonight that I will still be able to monitor the cameras."
“That's nothing special. Face it, Tony, you’re not the best for keeping your clothes on, and Cap has an entire website dedicated to his butt in jogging pants.”
Tony pats Steve’s thigh in a way he hopes is soothing, because he really can’t find it within himself to be sympathetic. Not when The Shorts are on the line. It’s also an excuse to touch a little bit more... He’s never claimed to be saint, okay. “Waste not, Cap. Keep them for around the tower.”
Tony moved stiffly to the other side of the table and sat down slowly, deliberately. He did not want to look weak, but boy had that jog done a number on his bruised body. What had he been thinking? He glared at the cuff. He hadn’t been thinking. Stupid half-formed soulbond. He glared at Steve. Stupid soulmate.
Tony gathered the weeping mess that was Steve to his chest and whispered into his hair, “What do you need?”
“I know you wont say anything. You never say anything, not even to tell me to shut up and get lost. So, I am going to take advantage of that. I am shameless like that..” Steve laughed. It was a tinkling sound. Like temple bells, or wind chimes. Tony groaned inside.
“I don’t think that is a good idea. He is a busy man and he is still recovering…” Potts began, but was interrupted by the door swinging open. Tony Stark walked in.
Steve began laughing, then he yelped. His body was stitching itself back together at an accelerated rate. Tony groaned in sympathy. He felt the pull in the lungs and cradled his hand above the phantom hole in his body.
Steve looked down at the stack of pancakes. It smelt delicious. Vanilla and cinnamon. Steve remembered his resolution to be less needy, more supportive. He had smiled.
“I still can’t believe the size of that thing. I mean, it’s so tiny and it packs such a wallop. This Stark guy is something else. Imagine if he made weapons for us?”
Steve woke up with a stifled scream. His head radiated with pain. He looked around and he looked around to get his bearings. He saw that he was lying hidden between bales of hay as the old tractor moved ponderously over the rutted landscape. His arm felt alright, so he realized the pain he had woken up to was not his own.
Rhodes let the silence settle for exactly two minutes before he asked, “And what about the kidnappers. What are we doing about that?”
She smiled. “I saw the man put a tracker into the truck. I thought if I could get into the car with them, I’d be able to get the locator beacon and we could track it.”
. Then he had grown up and looked around at the world and seen all its hard edges and realized there was no place for softness in it. There was one time he had dreamt of a soulmate who said the words while getting ready to drive a truck through a checkpoint. In his dream they had held hands and died in a hail of bullets.
Face down on the floor turned to be close enough to the recovery position for some of the dizziness to retreat. He noticed Obie’s shining boots near his face. His eyes tracked up the length of the body to look at Obie.
Falling, he watched as the limp body sailed through the gondola hatch. And Steve was swallowed by the darkness.
He had no reason to come now. It was done. The job was over. Now Hydra would hunt down the mole, whom they would assume had betrayed them and he would finally know who was the snake in his garden. He was not looking forward to finding out. These people were his family. He stood alone, lost in thought. Darkness fell around him.
And then Tony heard him say his name and he was out of the monitor room, racing towards to the interview room. The door slammed open in front of him and three faces looked up in surprise. That was the moment his jarred ribs chose to make their presence felt.
“What if it changes? What if whatever my first words are become his new words? Crap, no one knows how this bamboozle works, Pep. There is no real info out there. Trust me I checked. Fantasy clap trap, by the boat loads, but actual real info, nuh-uh. None. Can’t risk it. Avoidance is the best policy,” Tony sat down heavily on the chair and closed his eyes.
Steve extends a hand over the object—a wrought iron bracelet—and cobbles together some raw strands of his magic to poke at it. He already has his suspicions as to its purpose, and they are confirmed when the magic loops back to him. “JARVIS, can you link me in? It’s a suppression bracelet,” he says, and Brunnhilde glares down at Sunset. “It conceals magical energies. People would to use them to hide during the witch hunts.”
Opening the box doesn't ease the worry that he's about to wear something worth more than what he makes in a year. Instead of fabric, the mask is composed of thousands of silver wires that flow intricately together to give the illusion of gears.
“Any news on Bruce and Thor, JARVIS?” Tony asks, sitting down beside Clint and clutching his beer like a lifeline.
“You know what, I think I will,” he says quickly, “Shots, I mean. Make them. I’m going to go make shots that won’t give us alcohol poisoning after the first one.”
“Nah, that was earlier when Tony was talking about Steve’s dick,” Clint tells him seriously. “Now I’m just trying to convince Tony that blondes have more fun.”
With that, he walks around the bar with set determination and grabs the can of whipped cream like his sanity depends on it.
JARVIS is yelling in his ear about a sudden surge of hostile magic as Tony pulls them down to the floor. Not that it'll help, but Steve uses it as an excuse to hover over him and block as much of Tony as he can.
"If something happens tonight I have faith in both of you. Keep my guests safe, okay?" Tony sounds completely serious, and Steve realizes suddenly that he still has his hand resting on the curve of Tony's back.
Their rhythm stutters, and the way Steve freezes does all sorts of interesting things to the muscles of his stomach and chest. Tony has to let go of the belt loops in favour of running his hands all over them.
“Tell him I’ll meet him downstairs,” Tony decides, running his fingers over the edge of the arc reactor. He hates blocking it out, has become so used to the comforting glow that the absence of its light is making his breath catch in his throat. For all the teasing, shaving his beard and dyeing his hair are nothing compared to the black hole in his chest.
The air is starting to hum with anger and magic, radiating off Sunset like a brewing storm. Brunnhilde immediately lashes out before Sunset can, and knocks her out cold with a good solid blast of magic.
Steve forces himself to look up from Tony's ribbon-wrapped fingers. "I will not be held responsible for breaking JARVIS."
Tony lets him trail off while all of the puzzle pieces come together. “Steve, did you do all of this because you want to
“Dr. Banner is just leaving for some previously-arranged plans and sends his regrets. Mister Odinson sends his regards and regrets as well. He says he’s promised his evening to Jane Foster and Eric Selvig.”
“Tony’s just jealous,” Natasha says with a smirk. “He’s not allowed to grow a full beard for PR reasons. The last time he did, he wasn’t let into a fundraiser because security thought he was a hobo.”
The sharp drag of beard burn is a bit of a shock when he’s on the receiving end, but Tony can’t bring himself to care—not when Steve is kissing him like a man drowning.
Rhodey leads him through the groups of people mingling on the dancefloor and points out both the uniformed security and the people they have blending in. There are a few obvious surveillance cameras, but Rhodey points to a few spots that Steve would never have guessed had anything different about them.
Clint’s wolf-whistle distracts them, and Natasha raises a shot glass with a grin. “Looking good, Stark.”
It takes a few more seconds than Steve thought it would for Tony to adjust the mask just so, and in actuality, Tony never does step back. He puts his hands on Steve's shoulders instead and smoothes out his lapels before adjusting his collar.
"Technology is pretty incredible," Steve admits quietly. He's vowed to never say it in front of Tony, at least not when Tony would use it as an excuse to study Steve like a science project.
Rhodey groans like he's in physical pain, leans over to grab the gold mask, and tosses it at Tony. "Get out of here, man, and take your cheap humour with you."
Clint shrugs back and taps an extra beer bottle beside him. Tony beckons for it, but Clint is an asshole. A smart asshole who knows not to get in between Natasha and Pepper and whatever is in their focus.
And once again Steve is reminded that Rhodey is so much more intuitive than Steve is used to. This one cuts too close, though. He wants to scoff at the tabloids and laugh at the garbage people are speculating, but there’s something in him that is constantly wondering, ‘What if they’re right?’
“Tony,” Pepper sighs, reaching over to switch out the concealer for something that calls itself ‘juice beauty’. Tony opens it one-handed and sniffs it experimentally. “I have seen you do many things that people say can’t be done, but I have never heard anything more impossible in my life.”
Making a snap decision, he pulls back, or tries to. Tony lets Steve chase him, goes back himself for a few shorter but no less filthy kisses. He does eventually draw the torn shreds of his restraint back together, just long enough for him to turn in Steve's arms and circle his hips back. The loss of Steve’s thigh between his legs makes his breath catch, makes him want to turn back around and jump so that Steve has no other option but to hold him up with Tony’s legs wrapped around him. And he would, Steve would catch him and could even keep him there one-handed while he used the other one to unzip his pants—
“Feeling good, Ms. Romanoff.” Tony takes a shot glass from the neat row set out in front of her and throws it back. There is a sense of immediate regret it when it burns like black ice all the way down and sets him sputtering. “What is this?!”
Tony tilts his head, letting Steve look over his shoulder and out across the crowd. The rough drag of Steve's beard once again on his overheated skin sets off a shiver that races down his spine until it's lost in the beat of the music. There's a desperate moment where he wonders if Steve has noticed, and he hastily draws back.
The file is still there when Tony starts to feel a bit more alive. It’s an unspoken rule that anything left lying around is fair game for prying eyes and bored minds, meaning morning newspapers have become a scarce commodity after the appearance of the first couple of files.
That sounds like a challenge, and Tony perks up while everyone else stares at Steve in exasperation. Joke’s on them: Tony is a genius and he has
Tony actually stops to consider it, and Steve's stomach drops. If it’s making Tony Stark stop to calculate, it’s going to be way out of Steve's price range. "Am I calculating my time in here or considering that part as a gift?"
Someone had clearly taken the time to tell him about the basics of dancing in the club with a partner, just had never gone through with the execution.
"No!" slips out, more biting and harsh than Steve intends. "Brunnhilde can handle it. Tony, you need to stay down."
There’s always just a bit more colour on the back of Steve’s neck—and now Tony can confirm that it starts on his chest as well—when Tony outright flirts with him. Sometimes it will even creep further up until Steve’s normally pale complexion is flushed. Those are the moments when Tony dares to hope, just a little bit, that Steve is aware that the teasing is all a cover for how serious he is.
is the word that comes to his mind. Desperate, like a man finding everything he’s ever wanted but who knew he could never hold on to it.
“I really don’t want to know what the other backup plans were,” she tells him. “Just, don’t expect the makeup to work miracles. There’s only so much it can change, and I’m not exactly trained for espionage.”
Rhodey has come to a stop in front of a door that has a soft glow coming from underneath. He's studying him, and Steve shifts on his feet nervously. "You know he's your number one fanboy, right? There are times I would swear he's looking up wedding venues after you've left."
“Hold still,” Pepper chides after what felt like an eternity of him and Clint silently arguing while he’s poked and prodded with brushes. It can’t have been more than five minutes real time, but it feels like his hair should be grey and his skin withered with old age.
“It’s too early to be talking about Steve’s junk,” Clint cuts in, bleary-eyed and stumbling like a drunkard into the kitchen. He is twice as dangerous and three more times likely to stab someone before his morning coffee than even Tony, so the wise thing to do would be to drop it.
“Of course, Sir. I’m sure Ms. Potts will be very happy to know that you are suddenly so keen on taking steps to not get sued.”
Everything has been leading up to this night. All of the break-ins, the threats, the security breaches at Stark Tower, the murders of several of Tony's business partners. It seems crazy to Steve now that what had brought them together was a rich man who'd been murdered in a hotel room.
Brunnhilde has blood dripping from her ears and down the sides of her mask, but she's standing over Sunset’s crumpled figure with a grim expression and magic sparking from her fingertips. "Do you have those cuffs?" she asks, eyes never leaving Sunset.
His thoughts must be showing on his face, because Tony rolls his eyes and does something with his body that flips them over and: "HOLY SHIT, TONY, NO!"
It takes a moment for him to realize that he’s paused with one hand on Steve’s far hip, their chests angled towards each other and just shy of touching. Steve’s breath is hot against his neck, sparking heat that flushes through him, heady and intoxicating.
“I wouldn’t have needed to create a company from scratch if you hadn’t driven my family into bankruptcy!”
“You made me an op,” Tony cuts in, amazement and amusement warring within him. “You created an operation within an operation. This was reconnaissance to see if you could get into my pants.”
"Never ask for prices," Rhodey cuts in before Steve can panic further. "He'll say some ridiculous amount that he'll make sound like pocket change and then somehow make you look like the crazy one. Just put it on and get out of here."
“Holy shit, what are you wearing? Did you paint that on?” he asks incredulously, shaking sloshed beer from his hand. “You better not have hired someone, because I would have done it for free.”
Slight movement in the corner draws his attention over to Brunnhilde, standing in the shadows. She isn't hiding, or at least she doesn't have the posture of someone hiding. It's like she's waiting, and the way she doesn't relax until Sunset draws back from Tony is all Steve needs to know she also thinks something is off.
The symbolism of how his body is protecting Tony is important too; his shield is heavy on his back and he's reinforcing the defensive weight of his magic. Sure, he has the skills and the power to take on whoever it is, but so does Brunnhilde. He's going to have to trust her just as she's trusting him to keep Tony safe.
Rhodey starts moving down a corridor that takes them further from the party and noise. "JARVIS is giving me access to a live feed of the building, I just have to tell him what room I want."
Steve is looking more and more horrified by the second. “No! No, not to get into your pants. At least, not just to...”
"If you need me I can last longer than a few minutes, Steve. Where's your mask?" Tony is suddenly starting to look way too cheerful.
For a moment there’s a stillness that settles over them, and Tony’s breath catches in his throat. Fear washes over him—maybe he’s pushed too far or read into it too much. In just one second he’s managed to ruin one of his most important friendships. All because he couldn’t keep his mouth shut.
Tony squawks at him as he fumbles his catch. "Hey, you have an issue with my humour you take issue with yourself. You were there during my formative years."
“I’ve never done this before,” Steve says dryly against his neck. “Dancing has… changed, and I wasn’t a big dancer even before this.”
"You texting with him?" Steve asks, looking around to try and figure out where the library is in the mess of doorways.
"Put your hand on my shoulder and step back with your right foot. Step your left foot to the left, and your right comes beside, forward with the left, and sway the right foot forward. Now bring your left back to where you started."
“That is not how things will go for you,” Steve pointed out. “One does not simply hit Hydra and walk away. You know their motto—cut off one head, two more grow to replace it. They will retaliate. Whether you want it or not, the war is at your door. Your mole brought it to you. You would be wise to make sure the hit, when it comes is big enough that they don’t walk, or even crawl away from it. Because if they do, you will be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life. I am not trying to scare you… It is just what they do.” Steve became quiet with the thought of Hydra’s eye on Tony Stark.
Pepper’s expression asked the same question. Rhodey was looking amused. And Steve… What was that expression on his face? Tony decided it was not surprise or pity or sadness. Was that longing?
So he avoided the obvious tracks where he might run into people. By evening, Steve was too exhausted to think, but he had found a villager who agreed to give him a lift in an ancient tractor as far as the next town. The old man had almost collapsed when he saw Steve stumble into his barn.
The desolation that Tony felt at that moment certainly startled him enough to do the promised face plop.
“Safe. Where will be safe, Steve? Where will be safe when Shield falls and the last flimsy check on Hydra is removed?” Nat pocketed her knife and put away her tools.
“… and despair and guilt and anger… all at the same time,” Dr Banner interrupted, trying to keep his tone light. “You know, if he was himself he would have tried to come up with a name for what he was feeling.”
It did so for Steve. He felt like he fell forever, just a fingertip away from Tony. The moment stretched like his fingers as Steve strained to reach the man he loved. With an intensity that felt like it left no room for anything at all. And he wondered if Tony would ever feel like that about him.
The thing about raining fire from the skies, is that there is no controlling the fallout. Fire catches. And everything burns.
Steve turned to Bucky and gave him a bright smile. Bucky looked at him like a deer in headlights. “What?” he asked.
. The paralysis had left his body stiff and aching. Or was it the drug that Obie had injecting into his neck like a crazy person. Who did that? Who did that to their own nephew?
He was face down in the snow but by balancing on his elbow, had left enough breathing room to hold the position for a while. Tactically it was a sound decision. He was injured, and had no weapons. He was in no position to take on two armed men and a dog. He had dropped from the sky, so the dog had not scented him yet, and with all this snow on top of him, there was a good chance, the guards would move on without knowing he was there. Intellectually he knew all that.
Steve hadn’t slept well. Maybe it was the unseasonable warmth of the humid night, maybe it was a nightmare, maybe it was the fact that Tony had not come to bed at all, maybe it was just that Tony had been so distracted that he had not even touched the hot cocoa Steve had got him, or that they had argued earlier that day and Steve did not even remember what it had been about… but whatever the cause, the effect was the same. Steve had laid in bed staring at the ceiling until the sun came up. Then he stared at the empty spot next to him, the pristine pillow and untouched sheet and got up with a sigh. He went for a longer than usual run, and had a longer than usual shower. Standing under the spray of cool water he wondered if it was possible for him to be less needy, or at least pretend? So he would not drive Tony away from him, suffocating him with his clingi-ness, his relentless need for Tony’s warmth.
“Let’s start with the slightly bad, then do the good, then the really bad and garnish it with some really really good.”
But the stories were fascinating. Especially the ones about near misses. The one study in which a three hundred odd participants with pencil gray words turned up to see if they could find their soulmate. The experiment had been conducted for five years before it finally happened for one couple. Tony couldn’t help but think of all the could-be couples who had perhaps turned up a year apart. Then there were handwriting experts who pretended they could tell you where and when to find your soulmate. There was a TV show where people would send in the words on their wrist and a pretty young woman read them out on camera. That never produced a result either. Perhaps you had to be there.
Cold air sweeps around him before rushing towards the figure hidden amidst the bright light of battling magic. It hits with a thunderous crash. With all the heat in the air from the blasts of magical fire, it could have actually been thunder. Steve ignores the high pitched shrill in his head as the enemy figure goes down, hands pressing desperately against their ears.
“Sure thing, Chewbacca. You may also want to dye your hair,” Clint joins in, much to Tony’s delight and consternation. It's a fair suggestion; Tony rewards this pre-coffee forward-thinking by going to the pantry and grabbing a rice cracker to offer him. Clint takes the dismal offering with a bow of his head and immediately dunks it into his coffee.
Tony is seated in an overstuffed armchair, looking radiant in a red tux laced with gold threads that glitter in a way that should be gaudy but is just beautifully eye-catching. He’s leaning towards an absolutely stunning woman who looks both familiar to Steve and close to tears. Beside them are two masks that lay together, tangled up on a side table, and the precious stones on one sparkle in the low light.
“Mission complete,” Steve says with amusement. His hands haven’t moved, but they’re not as steady or demanding as they had been moments before. It’s almost like Steve isn’t sure of his welcome, but is loathe to leave.
Taking a deep breath, Tony steels himself and goes for broke. He reaches back until he can curl his fingers around the back of Steve’s neck and pulls him closer to purr, “Then it’s time to take me home, Cap.”
Scrambling to get himself under control, Tony shrugs, “I don’t see anyone with him. I’ll get JARVIS to run facial recognition if you want to get us more to drink.”
The walls are covered in spiderwebs with cool-toned lights pointed at them, casting mysterious shadows. Ghostly holograms run through the guests: Victorian-era lords and ladies in elaborate clothing who dance, wander through the crowd, and congregate in small clusters before vanishing with soft laughter that blends in with the music. Candles flicker in the corners, held aloft by wrought-iron posts. There are even decorative bats hanging from the ceiling.
It's Steve's turn to flip them over, but this time he gets up onto one knee, slightly in front of Tony. The position is bad, his back to where Brunnhilde is fighting, but Tony is safe in the crux of his legs and against his chest.
"This is not the time for dramatics," he grunts out, watching as Brunnhilde hurdles another spell, heading directly towards the threat.
They're close in height, with maybe an inch difference, but Steve leans down anyway, trying not to think of how good Tony smells or how gentle his fingers are threading through Steve's hair as he fiddles with the mask’s earbuds.
Tony rolls his eyes, but does it anyway. As a bonus he adds a strongly-worded message to Fury about wasting Avengers’ time for something that took him and JARVIS all of two seconds and half a brain cell to figure out. Feeling rather satisfied with himself, he locks his phone and slips it into a pocket before being dragged onto the dance floor.
Steve pulls out his mask from his jacket pocket and holds it up triumphantly. It’s black imitation velvet, wrinkled to all hell, with weird bunches around the edges—marks of him buying the first one he saw at the dollar store that wasn’t plastic.
A hand palms his ass to pull him closer to Steve as the songs bleed together, leaving his thoughts momentarily derailed. At the same time it grounds him, bringing him back into the moment and the hot drag of Steve’s tongue against his own. It’s not enough to keep the hope from sparking against his sternum, but it is enough to fray the last of his self-control.
He’s too old for this shit, Tony decides when he’s in the middle of a swarm of people who have no interest in maintaining any personal space. Too old to be pressed up against a guy straight out of his fantasies and blue-balling himself. Steve isn’t helping any: his hands are back at Tony’s hips and pulling him closer even as Tony tries to angle away.
Once they’ve settled into their booth, Steve watches people swarm into the building, the rush increasing as the time grows late. Tony sprawls beside him, delighting in the noise and the flow of drunken people on the dance floor until something in the far corner catches his eye. He tugs at the hem of Steve’s shirt and leans in to rub his cheek against Steve's, growing momentarily distracted with wondering what it would be like to feel that beard a bit further south.
Now that he’s closer to the front, he recognizes Rhodey despite the silver mask that covers the top part of his face. He’s standing there watching everything with easy amusement, but his eyes stray inside the building every so often like a wolf keeping watch over his territory.
Steve immediately misses the way dancing gave him an excuse to be closer to Tony, the way Tony's body had moved against his own and the way the world had narrowed to just the two of them. Tony's eyes are bright as they watch him, and he's smiling in a way that Steve is beginning to realize has only been directed at him.
He might actually have the harder job, because Tony is watching the battle and vibrating like he wants to make a run towards the epicentre.
“You’re telling me that the guy who can spin like a rotisserie chicken in midair can’t move to music?” Tony teases, then lets the alcohol get the better of him. “Just pretend that you’re fucking me, Cap. Move with me. C’mon, you can feel the music, can’t you? Feel my hips? Just follow them, just relax and follow my lead.”
The icy wind cuts right through Steve’s suit jacket the moment he steps off of the bus. Even with the cold, it’s a beautiful night in New York City: clear with the moon at half. Light pollution blocks out the stars, but the evening is alive in flashing colours and excited voices. Even from a few blocks away he can hear the press calling out questions at the mansion’s front door, and can see the sharp flicker of high-powered cameras.
Natasha is staring at him warily and if she were anyone else, Tony would say that she’s edging towards the door. He’s been told that his smiles can be diabolical at times, and he’d be willing to bet that right now is one of those instances, but he doesn’t care. This is too good to be distracted from. Has Steve ever been to a gay bar? Does he know they exist? There is no way Tony is going to miss seeing Steve try to blend in with guys grinding on the dance floor. It’s got to be like painting an elephant pink, pushing it into a pond, and telling it to be an octopus.
“See you tonight! And just so you know, if I have to shave you'd better show some skin,” he calls over his shoulder, then bursts out laughing when he hears Clint say loud enough to reach the elevator:
Steve hoists him up, probably noticing Tony’s wandering thoughts, and leaves him with no choice but to wrap his legs snugly around Steve’s waist.
The side eye he gets for that immediately makes Steve want to take the words back. “If you believe that, might as well throw in the rumours of you being an escort who specializes in long-term role-play.”
Natasha taps the side of her nose, eyes mischievous, while Clint laughs and holds up a beer. “That’s why Nat always goes last for picking the shots.”
But neither Steve nor Tony move throughout all of this. They stay there, wrapped up in each other, surveying the damage and taking comfort until the clocks chime the midnight hour.
Carol nods sagely as they move the last few feet through the crowd back towards the entrance. The looks Steve is getting are now ones of envy, and a few more people are starting to really recognize him. Probably from the gossip tabloids as of late: the ones that speculate over his relationship with Tony rather than his detective business.
"I—uh, oh. Mask, right. I have it right here." He digs it from his pocket and holds it up triumphantly.
JARVIS, meanwhile, just sounds resigned. “It appears that the file has been updated under Director Fury’s credentials to name a Special Agent Stark as Captain Rogers’s backup. And Sir, in what I’m certain is an unrelated development, Director Fury is on the Avengers’ line.”
“I, um—” Steve begins, his eyes a bit wild and shifty. “I wasn’t sure how you’d react to a direct approach so I—”
The cool evening air hits him first. It isn’t clean or fresh by any stretch of the imagination, but it’s bracing after the muggy atmosphere inside the club, and Tony wants to laugh because they’re
“I can think of a better way to work on my reaction time,” Tony purrs, not able to resist teasing back. God, the v-neck on Steve’s shirt should be illegal. It has to fall somewhere in the realm of publicly indecent along with the dark jeans Steve has dug up from somewhere. They aren’t just tight, they are perfectly tailored to show the raw power of Steve’s muscles and emphasize his assets.
“We’ll save them for another weekend. Tony, you’re going to have to shave the beard if you’re serious about this.”
Steve laughs and puts his hand on Tony's lower back before he can talk himself out of it. Tony immediately turns wide eyes on him and Steve takes the opportunity to steer him towards the door. "Your subjects are waiting out there and Rhodey needs to get back to non-magical security. I'm sure Carol is missing him by now."
“Tell him thanks but no thanks. Stark Industries already has their own manuals, and we don’t want to be accused of plagiarism.”
"Perfect," Tony all but purrs and glides through the doorway into the noise and chaos of the party. He's soaking it in, looking happy to be part of the crowd instead of separate like he usually is. People recognize him and everything about him draws the eye, but it's getting late and aside from glances and quick greetings he's left alone.
"Hopefully there's some punch left," he hears Sunset say as she adjusts her gold dress and tries to smooth out the wrinkles that have set in. It's a bit of a lost cause, which she must realize because she smiles sheepishly around the room. "You guys look like you have some serious things to discuss."
There's something about how she's phrasing it that has Steve glancing back at her nervously. She's frowning as her eyes dart around the hallway walls, and the frown doesn't go away when Steve brings her focus to him. She must be feeling it too: the unease that's prickling under his skin.
He’s too busy cackling to notice Steve come in until he hears “What's a Cap thing?” from behind him. It’s too good; Tony turns so that he can watch Steve’s face when he sees the file, but as soon as he sees him his laughter immediately gives way to shock.
Whatever else he tries to say is cut off by a deafening shockwave that shatters all the glass in the room and throws people like rag dolls. The force of it rolls over Steve, impacting his shield and pushing him down even harder, despite Tony making a noise like the air is being forced from his lungs.
“You sit better when you feel like you can fidget. Go look yourself over and get ready for your date night with Steve. I’m going to go get the bail money ready.”
Tony’s thoughts break off under the branding of Steve’s fingers as they brush over his fly. The fingers don’t stay there for long; they curl around his thigh possessively while Steve’s thumb presses against him with each swivel of his hips. It’s a tease of friction, just enough to keep Tony grounded while coaxing punched-out whimpers from his throat.
All he manages to do instead is to get Steve’s leg between his thighs, his fingers tangled into Steve’s belt loops, and a hand cupping the back of his head. There’s an almost physical sensation of a switch being flipped that runs through him before Tony bares his teeth and grinds his hips against Steve’s.
"I never learned how to waltz," he warns, taking Tony’s hand. Tony smiles mischievously and leads them out onto the dance floor.
They watch Gregory being escorted out by someone who looks suspiciously like Maria Hill in the flashing lights of the dance floor, still moving together, just absentmindedly.
Hell, if Natasha and Clint weren’t here he probably would ask. He’d ask while standing between Steve’s legs, his hands sliding up the bracketing thighs as he leaned in close enough to whisper the words against Steve’s ear. All it would take is one word, one tiny nod, and he’d drag Steve over to the couch and drop down to his knees—
As Steve's head thunks down on his shoulder, Tony stares off towards the club in bewilderment. It takes a few moments for him to process that his body has started to shake, and he frowns until he realizes that it’s because Steve is… Steve laughing silently against him. Which makes Tony realize—
Steve chuckles from beside him and downs the shot without a flinch, the moonshine-swigging bastard. “It’s pretty bitter, but not so bad once you’ve swallowed. Why don’t you go make the next shot?”
Steve makes a sound like he's choking and immediately starts coughing. Tony, in an act of pure altruism, uses it as an excuse to give him a few pats on the back. The patting may change to something that could be defined as rubbing or stroking, but Steve isn’t saying anything and Tony would deny it anyway.
“Is that why?” Tony asks, his voice quiet. “You killed those people because you thought I had figured out you have magic?”
Missing people? With Natasha and Clint out of the running that just leaves Cap. Which means—holy shit. Tony jolts upright. "Holy shit. It's a Cap thing."
“If you’re having a mental breakdown, can you hold off until we get home? Or maybe tomorrow after we’ve had sex? Maybe even after some morning blow jobs? You won’t even get beard burn because I’ve shaved. I shaved for this. Oh my god, Steven Grant Rogers, did I have to shave because
," Tony is screaming, and Steve only just manages to grab him before he can race forward into harm's way. Tony falls back against him, not struggling, but he's digging his nails painfully into Steve's arm. "Sunny, oh god. What are you doing?!"
“Fuck you,” Sunset snaps, her voice cracking and rough. “I wore it to keep myself safe. You think it’s easy keeping magic a secret when you’re always in the public eye? You think I want to end up in a lab somewhere having tests done on me? Men like Tony Stark find out and what do they do? They treat us like a science project!”
Knowing about magic, using magic himself, and being on a first-name basis with Fae has not been enough to negate the amazement Steve feels over knowing that gods exist. And that they have jobs or run companies in the mortal realm.
“He’s going to burn it on sight. I love it, let’s go.” Rhodey clasps him on the shoulder and steers him inside. “We’ll catch up with you later, Carol.”
From his own mask, Steve can hear JARVIS's crackling voice confirming their whereabouts and Rhodey volunteering to go grab them.
It’s too late. It was too late the moment Steve decided to leave the file out for Natasha to look over without considering the possibility that Tony would also be awake this early in the morning. Tony is already standing up and making a bee-line for his workshop even before Steve starts backpedaling.
Tony nods firmly, the familiar feeling of fondness that he has for JARVIS sitting warm in his chest, even while he keeps a straight face. “Exactly. You’re learning well, JARVIS.” Fury all sorted, he turns back to the far more important matter at hand. “Now, Steve, what are you wearing?”
“Backup plan number five, right?” Pepper asks as they get to the common room where Clint and Natasha are talking quietly at the bar.
Steve sits on Tony’s other side and leans around him to talk to Natasha. “What do you think? I’ve never been to a gay bar before—”
“Because I’m shirtless and Steve is dressed like a hooker. Who wouldn’t want photographs?” Tony wiggles his eyebrows at her with a cheesy leer on his face. It turns into a frown of outrage when Clint snickers.
“I don’t think they are nightmares. Or dreams. I think they are memories. Some of them make no sense, but they all feel so familiar. Bucky, I remember what Ma smelled like. I think it’s called jasmine. I remembered a song she used to sing. I remembered what my bed felt like and colour of her eyes. My god, Bucky I remembered what it felt like to be loved,” Steve let his head drop back to thump against the wall. “These last couple of months I feel like something has reached inside me and started something. It’s like I hadn’t lost my memories but only bricked it all up. I am standing on this side of a dam, Buck. Now there is a crack and I can hear the weight of water beating against the dam. I am afraid when it breaks….”
Steve smirked. It was the bitter ugly curve that his lips were used to. “I’ve learned it’s best not to have any expectations. All the same I’d like to know what to prepare for,” he breathed deeply. This was strategy, he could do this. “What are you planning, what kind of fall out do you expect, what kind of back up plan you have and what role did you see us playing…I have a lot of questions for…” and there it was again. Every time he came to Stark, the hesitation was back. Along with the damned itch. Could you feel an itch on your diaphragm?
“Hydra will not let Stark walk away from it. They will not simply watch a lucrative supply chain break without retaliating. Is that what Stark thinks? He can get rid of the mole, break the chain and that will be all?” Steve was getting irritated now.
Maybe if he told himself this five times everyday—once with every meal, and on getting up and on going to bed—he might even come to believe it.
“The captain,” Tony sighed with his eyes closed, “And stop wagging your eyebrows at each other. I can sense it. It is all very disrespectful to your Boss and Keeper.”
He had been watching the Captain, Rogers… Steve… on the monitor. The man was staring into Tony’s soul right through the camera and Tony was finding it difficult to breathe. Something heavy began pooling in his gut and filling him up with an uncomfortable, alien feeling. He couldn’t breathe quite right.
Tony snorted, “I’m calling it tear gas. And that was just the bonus. The moral of today’s accivention was that sometimes a straight line is not the shortest distance between two points.”
Bucky and Clint stepped back from the mess of the man unconscious at their feet. They were breathing heavy and Steve knew it was anger not exertion that was pouring off his men in hot puffs. He leaned in front of the fallen man and reached out to check his head. His fingers came back bloody and his wrist began to itch. Steve pulled his hand back and straightened up. “Move him to the next room. I will do the questioning. Clean him up a bit, no bandages,” Steve said to Bucky. “And there is no need to hit an unconscious man. We are not savages. Do I make myself clear, Clint?” Steve spoke slowly and through gritted teeth to his men. The men nodded assent and picked the unconscious man up. Steve left the room. The itch was crawling up his arm.
“I can do this all day. But may be you have something better to do than get beaten up over nothing,” the man said. There was anger in his voice. Then he took a deep breath and tried again. This time he tried to be conciliatory, “It’s just data. You give me your route and you get to go home.”
Steve felt like a badly made machine, and Tony would look at all the rusted nuts and broken gears and take them all apart, and lay them out and study them. Would he figure out what made him work? What made him broken? Would he fix that mess and put him back together? Would he be able to? Would he even want to?
Steve realized with a start that Tony’s eyes were not just brown that turned gold in sunlight. They glowed with hints of amber. And Steve? He felt like a prehistoric insect captured and encased for all eternity. And Steve realized it was alright to be a little selfish and ask for a little bit of Tony that he could envelop himself in.
There was still a lot of activity around the severely damaged Hydra schloss. Steve couldn’t help marvel at the destruction a few well aimed charges had done to the entire edifice. Then, he was glad that it was him and not Tony, who was standing here admiring the Avengers’ handiwork. Tony would not have liked to see the human cost, in blood and death and mutilated limbs. The dead militia men were laid out on the snow and the badly injured were being assisted by the less badly injured. Steve limped to one of the dead men lying farthest from the still smouldering courtyard. In the dark, he managed to get enough of the man’s gear off that he could pass for a militia man himself.
When Tony came to, he was seated again. The chair had been set upright, there was no bag over his head and he was alone. The gag had been removed, though he was still tied to a chair. But this was a new chair, one that was bolted firmly into the floor. There was a stool in the corner, but he couldn’t see any neatly laid out torture instruments, but then he had a very limited view of the room around him. He began to take stock of his wounds. His face was throbbing. His shoulder was wrenched. One eyelid felt heavy and swollen shut. His head hurt. Breathing was difficult, perhaps a few cracked ribs. His jaw hurt. He had bitten his tongue. His arm still throbbed.
For two days the tracker’s beacon had sat there blinking in the spot marked ‘precinct.’ Then it had moved, a nice zig zag convoluted route until it had finally stopped at an abandoned warehouse in the outskirts of the city. As soon as the truck had left the precinct, Jarvis had activated his rumour mill and spread word that someone from Stark organization was looking for buyers for Hydra weapons. Tony watched as the blinking light suddenly died out. He let go of a breath he had not realized he was holding. The bomb had gone off then.
Steve remembered the fire and he knew he and the boy in the cage, Lucas, he'd said, had escaped. He didn’t remember how. He knew it had been a bitter winter that one. They had run and run. He remembered the snow drifts and their huffing breaths like mist hanging in front of their faces. He remembered the shock as he fell through a hole in the ground and snow had cascaded in after him, burying him in winter.
“Only the last one. But you knew that before you disappeared. We found the driver. He managed to run before the pigs showed up. He is safe.”
And he went to watch Tony fidget. Holding his tongue, for whatever reason, was probably not the easiest thing for him. As Nat, Potts, Rhodes, Clint and Bucky spoke, Tony’s fingers twitched. Steve had learned the difference between the twitches that accompanied agreement, to the ones that came when Tony had a better idea. He had watched the time when Tony jumped to his feet and ran out of the room, returning with a sheet of paper he handed to Potts. Potts shook her head at the man and then made a neat tweak to the plan. After that incident, Tony had kept paper close at hand. And regularly passed notes in class.
“That was not how I wanted you to find out,” Tony said to Steve’s shoulder as they both lay in hospital beds next to each other.
“We’ve never seen a good man before. They are this rare breed Steve. We’ve all heard about them, we just never expect to meet them,” Bucky had answered without a smile. Clint later told him that Tony Stark had been seen out and about and seemed to be recovering well. Oh God that did not make him feel any better. He remembered the bruised face, angry and spitting blood. He closed his eyes and groaned.
“When I was a teenager, I woke up in the snow and... well, my wrist was blank and I had lost all my memories,” Steve said.
Tony hummed and then smiled shyly, looking at Steve with lowered lids. He was going for the coquettish look, it worked. “So you won’t get lost,” he said.
Tony was smart. He could play the long game. And he was not going to bet without knowing exactly who held what cards. So he said nothing and took his medicine. By the end he felt their heart was not in it. Something about beating on a man who can’t fight back and won’t even give his captors the satisfaction of crying out in pain makes people feel like toads. Bullies like hearing the screams, don’t they? So he didn’t scream even when he thought he heard his rib crack. They heard it too. Tony thought they had begun to respect him then. The last few hours before they bundled him into the car he had heard them arguing outside his door. Neither of them wanted to watch him spitting up blood in answer to their questions. That was a pity. Their questions had begun revealing a lot about them.
The long dark coat and the helmet were a great disguise. From the air, Steve had spotted what had looked like a garage. Steve stumbled to where he had seen smaller vehicles parked just a few hours ago. He hoped that enough snow vehicles had escaped the carnage that he could steal one. As he limped on, hugging shadows and slipping between pillars and doorways, he felt himself cheer up. This area was completely undamaged, perhaps all the vehicles would have escaped the inferno. He thought his chances were rather good.
Jarvis frowned, “While I am glad it worked out this time, might I suggest that you go carefully with the good doctor. He is not all he seems. In fact, better to keep a distance and avoid him if at all possible.”
“I was watching for a while and I thought it was strange that they didn’t take the truck. It’s still sitting there. Then I thought about haulage and found someone to do the math. The truck is bigger on the outside that it is on the inside.”
There had been no opportunity to retrieve the beacon and by the time they were in the compound Nat had lost a lot of blood and decided it was best to get the medical attention they were offering. “I saw Tony Stark again.”
But there was never a case of someone knowing their soulmate, hearing their own words, and not speaking the words that completed the bond. The deaf boy had lipread the words, and signed back. Voila bond complete irrespective of said soulmate’s lack of ASL fluency. That was some solid bull crap. Dr Strange had put three questionmarks next to that anecdote. Tony put three more.
Dr Strange had been so dismissive that he had handed Tony three books and told him they contained all the lies and truths ever told about the subject, adding that if he could tell one from the other, good on him. Two of those had been written by Dr Strange himself. Tony could understand the man going into magic. Somehow it felt more real.
“He looked better. Arm is in a sling, walks a little stiff. But getting prettier each time I look. You guys really went for the face didn’t you?” This last she said to Bucky and Clint. They didn’t say anything.
In a minute they were in Tony’s lab as he heated a small batch of ochre. The blue light from the bunsen burner reflected on Tony’s goggles and while Steve was all for safety, he wished he could see Tony’s eyes. It was like he could look at then for all eternity and never get the catalogue of colours right. His experiments in his “studio” were proof of all his failures.
He kept repeating the words like a lunatic. The pain in his chest growing strong and unbearable. The world went dizzy again and then he collapsed on top of Steve, just as the door burst open. Again.
Steve stumbled in the dark but managed not to wrench his arm again. He looked around him. He had managed to clear the ravine edge and had got almost 500 metres away, on to the west side of the schloss. Far enough to be out of sound range as he started up the snowbike. Who knew Tony could take his mind of the pain? Painkiller Stark, Steve giggled.
“I’m sorry. I was worried sick. I wish you’d stopped doing that Tony,” she sighed and dabbed at the corner of her eye. When she had gathered herself she turned to Tony again.
“Just regular grocery stuff. The medicine and the machine tools got in safely. Most of the food and clothing has already been shifted. We stopped when we realized you were missing. Since then everything has been sitting in warehouses 3, 7, 10, 15 and 17.”
Then Tony read about all the sudden deaths. The heart failures that coincided with the death of a soulmate and he felt cold inside. Perhaps some threads should stay un-yanked.
In fact he was leaning a bit too far. Somebody stop him leaning. He tried to hold out his arm to steady himself but his coordination was gone. He fell on the floor face first and pain bloomed across his cheek. His teeth cut into his cheek and his mouth filled up with blood.
“Hey don’t knock my soulmark. My soulmate is a vigilante and he likes to think he is a tough guy,” Tony said.
Steve’s Howler monkeys were doing most the surveillance work. That was the only way to keep it a secret from his own organization. It did not sit well with Tony. He felt disloyal, suspecting his men. It was a strange reaction—this sense of failure, rather than fury over the betrayal. He found himself wondering if he should have seen it coming? Done something to prevent it? Been a better employer, the kind who nobody wants to betray? He rubbed a hand across his face. He was tired.
"No," Steve grinds out, his teeth clenching against a burst of pain as more magic slams against him.
“Glad you made it, Steve," Rhodey says with genuine warmth. "I have it on good authority that Tony has a mask ready for you just in case you forgot yours.”
“Glad you made it,” she says in greeting. “And fashionably late, too. Tony won’t know whether to be disappointed or impressed.” She grins at him and he can't help but grin back, though he's sure his is more strained.
“I didn’t know it was an option,” Tony blurts out, while Steve gently turns him aaaand... okay, they’re walking. They’re walking, and Steve’s hand is pressed against his lower back in a way that’s more distracting than it should be.
Steve makes a strangled noise that Tony ignores to sit up straight and reach for his phone. “Don’t be lying to me now, Barton. Oh, look! They have a picture of those running shorts from when we were having a heat wave. Good times.” Tony stares at the picture before saving it.
“I’ve spent way too much time planning this for you to wind up spending the night in your workshop,” Steve mouths against Tony’s neck.
Food is everywhere, piled on tables against the walls, and there is even an option for hot food in a room off to the side. There are two separate bars with multiple staff handing out drinks...
Tony suspects a conspiracy between Fury and Pepper when he finds out that that he really does have meetings scheduled all day. It isn’t until early evening that he’s closing down his StarkTab after his last conference call and is finally able to focus on his ‘Plans’.
“Yes, JARVIS, dear, who is Steve’s backup?” Tony asks, sitting back with a smug yet satisfied smile once he’s erased his tracks. A few seconds off his best time, even after SHIELD
Steve held Tony’s hand like it was a lifeline. Tony had a few books pressed to his side with his elbow and was holding an ice cream cone with his free hand. Steve knew it was inconvenient for him not to be able to use both hands and Steve was already holding a bag full of groceries so his offer to hold the books had been ignored.
Jarvis was thinking about Tony’s proposal. It wouldn’t do rush him. Tony sipped from his own cup and looked at the painting over the mantle piece. An angel with a sword pointed at the head of a vanquished demon. Dressed in blue armour and swirling red cape, rust blonde hair lifted gently by the wind. Reni had made the figure glow. Tony’s breath hitched at the sadness in the angel’s expression. He marveled at the kindness in the face even as the blade was poised for the fatal blow.
Once he was fairly well-sheltered between trees he stopped. He had reached a little mountain stream, panting and doubled over with the effort. He sank to his haunches and took stock of the situation. His arm was numb with pain, handing limply down his side. He needed to set his shoulder, before he did permanent damage jogging it around. His face was scratched on one side, and his ankle hurt. Courtesy the fall, he suspected. The snow drift had cushioned his fall but it still had been a long way down. He gritted his teeth and stifled and cry as he shoved his arm back into its socket. Then removed his boot and frowned at his swollen ankle.
Steve waited for the dark narrow shape of the arrow loop window in the tower to align in the cross hairs of the launcher. Then, he let out a deep breath and launched the missile. The weapon left the launcher with a whoosh and arced gracefully to the black slit in the tower. The recoil from the launcher spun Steve into a much less graceful swing but he used the momentum to point the heavy weapon down at one of the trucks and let it go. Along with a few well-aimed grenades. The explosions and the concussive blasts seemed to happen all at once and Steve began climbing up the swaying harness rope.
The research about healthy bonds was all rainbows and butterflies kind of perfection that made Tony want to barf. Emotions that traveled via the bond. Experiences and feelings that echoed between soulmates. It sounded like a fun experiment. Since his bond was partial would it mean that he could feel what The Cap felt? Sense him somehow? Use it to catch him? He remembered the flood of pain that come when the bond had formed and felt a twinge of regret. The bloke had had a tough life. Even with his perfect recall Tony could not make out individual memories just the sensation of loss and pain. Tony bit his lip and wondered if he really wanted to open himself to more of that.
And the man was strange. He was a study in contrasts. Someone who looked inhumanly strong and confident, and yet so lost and sad. Someone who looked older than his years and yet young and soft. Beautiful and broken.
Steve wandered up to the rooftop. Nat was already there, sharpening a small knife. She looked up at him.
Holding the torch between his teeth, Steve got down on his knees and hot wired the bike. The bike roared alive and Steve threw himself on it and headed down slope. In the still of the mountain night, the bike had been louder than he had anticipated. He hoped there was no one around, in any condition to be suspicious or give chase.
“The others are all out hunting for you. Let me go make a quick call,” Pepper said as she left the room.
Bucky had never heard Steve talk so much. He didn’t know what to do with it. Steve’s voice was steady and resigned. Like he knew something was wrong, but he was ok with it. And that was not the Captain of the Howling Commandos that he knew. Steve thrummed with a quiet rage against the world. A controlled explosion. Steve’s quiet acceptance worried him more than the idea of the coming battle.
“Have to fix a break in the girder. Back in a mo,” Tony’s voice was cheerful and carefree, like he wasn’t climbing out of the rear engine gondola with a wrench in one hand. He disappeared out of view and Steve began running to the open hatch. The harness ropes tightened around him and he looked down to see the enormous tangle of wire and ropes. It would take too long to disentangle himself from this mess. He began to disengage the clasps of the harness instead and impatiently stepped out of the belts around his waist and thighs. He still had the tangle of ropes in a loose grip when Tony reappeared.
“Yes and no, Jarvis. Yes and no. He gave me everything he had and yet it was all highly unsatisfactory. What I was looking for… I think I know where to find it. Now if only I could make up my mind on whether what I want is what I need,” Tony laughed.
And then he had come to the kitchen where Tony was singing something so off key it was unrecognizable.
Tony winced. “Read the room, Pep. I got it during the kidnapping. The heartless bastard who took me did this.”
Steve was not listening. His eyes were fixed on Tony. Lying in bed, a bandage around his head, and another around his wrist. And Steve began to shiver uncontrollably to see Tony so still. His eyes closed, his hand not waving around, he almost did not look like his Tony. Tony was always so alive, so vibrant.
Steve wondered why the soulbond didn’t show him Tony’s mind like Tony, apparently, could see his. He wondered if it was because Tony saw in more colours than the seven that mere mortals were limited to. Maybe his mind was too brilliant to see... like sunlight that glints off fresh fallen snow, so brilliant it is blinding.
The world was bright with sunlight and pain when the car dumped Tony Stark in the middle of a field and drove off. Some local thugs found him. He had stayed conscious long enough to give them his name. When he next woke it was in his own room, with Rhodey’s fingers stroking his hair. He recognized the familiar buzz of morphine and swallowed greedily at the ice chips that were held to his lips.
He made a face and continued, “Device is in place. She had a rummage around and got a list of the inventory,” he paused to pull out a sheet of paper from his pocket and handed it to Steve. “She’d got that far when that Rumlow chap showed up. Then she hid in the rafters waiting for things to settle down enough to get away. Steve, shit is worse than we thought.”
So he watched Tony and once he had caught the man stealing a glance and looking away quickly frowning at the table. He had been a little surprised but in that moment he saw Tony think as clearly as if he were saying his thoughts aloud. He saw Tony embarrassed at having been caught looking—a touch of pink near the cheekbones and ears. He saw Tony get angry at his own reactions—a deepening of the frown and clenching of fists. He saw a decision being made—the straightening of the shoulders and a little nod. And then he saw the anger being put on like a face plate clicking into place—the scowl and the glare. It was turned on Steve like a noon day sun. Where others would have wilted, Steve basked. Since that day Tony would spend their planning meetings staring him down. Steve went to watch Tony glare.
Luckily for Steve the man was none too steady with his hand. His aim was all over the place and Steve was moving quick. Steve grunted as he slid across the floor towards the shooter who had panicked and was now out of bullets. He kicked the man in the knee and when he fell grabbed his gun and butted him hard over the skull. There was a satisfying crunch as the man collapsed on the floor. There were sounds of voices shouting somewhere in the building. Steve pressed a finger to his ear and began scanning the feeds for any signs of his team.
But he couldn’t look away either. So he scowled and tried to hold on to his anger and push down on the memories that had flooded into him when his soulmark had realized. There was a reason the man looked so… haunted. Tony shuddered and felt the anger against Steve slipping away. So he did the next best thing. He became furious with himself.
Tony put away his gizmo and screwdriver and rested his elbows on the table, chin delicately poised on his knuckles and batted his eyelashes at Steve.
“It is done,” he said to Tony. There was a smudge of soot across a cheek and his shirt was dotted with small burns where embers had landed. There were scratches on his hands and his knuckles were skinned. He looked messy, but unhurt. Then he smiled.
“Sorry, I’m late. Hope you kept the bed warm for me,” Steve said as he climbed in next to Tony, careful not to jostle him.
I will always find my way to you, Steve thought. And he thought of brown eyes like burnished brass, and clever fingers that made him thoughtful gifts. That kept him safe, from the cold, the exhaustion and the disorientation. And he got back on the snowbike, then got off when it wouldn’t start, refueled it and got back on. Fiddled with the controls and was finally on his way, correcting his course and speeding downhill for a few minutes until the snowline disappeared and the forest floor became visible. Then, he had to walk. Make that limp.
Pepper knew his ‘don’t argue with me’ voice. He didn’t often employ it, but when he did there was no response necessary. She marched out. She was back in 15 minutes, Rhodey in tow.
Steve watched the mountain stream flow down and thought of the maps he had pored over in mission prep. The water was gurgling away to the valley below… a long way below. The shortest distance was straight down. Or was it? He smiled and shook his head. “I understand, Tony,” he said and began limping upstream, back towards the Hydra fort.
Pepper shook her head. “That’s where I can’t see any pattern. The goods are different, the routes are different, the source is different, destination is different… I’ll let you know as soon as I find anything,” she promised.
“I am not going to say the words. In fact just to be on the safe side. I am not going to say any words near them. You will have to be my voice to the gang. Say I have been traumatized by the incident and am not likely to get over my paranoia. Too hysterical for a face-to-face or something,” Tony said.
He used to think it was wonderful that there was someone out there just for him. He used to imagine someone who would say the words and hand him a wrench as they began work on a project together.
Tony nodded. “Check stops made on route. Specially unscheduled ones. I have a plan, but I think we might need help from these Howler Monkeys. What do we know about them?”
It was still dark when Steve woke up. A wolf howled in the distance. A dog barked closer by. Steve tensed. He knew he must have fallen some distance from the Hydra fort but there was no telling what kind of perimeter security there was in place. He began to push himself off the carpet of snow and stifled a grunt of pain. Then, careful to keep his weight off his injured shoulder, he raised his head.
Maybe he could just close his eyes and rest for a while. Maybe it was alright to sleep. Tony would not grudge him a little rest, would he? A small delay. It was so cold, but he could sleep. Just for a while.
“Tony!” he screamed. They were on top of a forest now and the treetops were too close. Hanging upside down, as he was, Tony had been unable to avoid one of the large firs and had hit his head. Steve couldn’t see if he was bleeding, but he was unconscious.
“I saw Steve’s wrist today,” Pepper sighed, “I mean, I paid attention to it. Tony, his wrist was bare. He has no mark.”
“Do you think, we don’t know that? Tony knows… we have all lost something or other to the Militias—AIM, Doom, Ten Rings, and Hydra is the biggest monster out there. We have to pick our battles carefully. We will cut off Hydra’s arms supply, but I don’t think we can go any further than that,” Potts broke in.
Steve looked at him with a strangely blank expression. His mouth twisted into a shape that might have been a smile, or a grimace. Tony could not decide. A
“I remember what Ma smelled like. This memory feels like a gift. I am happy right now. I remember what that felt like,” Steve said with a small smile playing at the edge of his mouth. He absent-mindedly rubbed his wrist.
Bucky set a bowl of stew and a chunk of bread in front of Steve. “Nightmares again?” he asked lifting a hand to Steve’s face but thinking better of it and pulling away to sit on the floor next to him.
“I don’t think it is a weapon they got there Cap,” said Nat. “Couldn’t see clearly but they seemed to be dragging a body.”
Not good. He packed some snow into his sock to bring down the swelling and began to think. He needed to get off the mountain but he had no supplies. He was dressed warm thanks to his part in the mission, but he had no food or water. Well, water was not too much of a problem, he decided looking at the unending pristine snow drifts as far as the eye could see. But he was injured and even the suit Tony had designed with fancy exothermic lining was not going to keep him warm forever in this bitter cold.
Steve reached out to comfort his boyfriend. I am coming, my love. It will be alright, he tried to send. As suddenly as it had started, the pain disappeared. There was silence again.
As so often happened these days, Tony found himself pondering the problem called Steve. If he was not thinking about him, he was dreaming about the man. Sifting through a weird mish-mash of memories. Tony found he could skip the screaming ones and dwell in the rare pleasant ones. It gave him a strange sort of connection to his soulmate.
Glowing just before the words are spoken turned out to be a thing. There were at least 83 comments on the subject. But given that it was an unobservable occurrence—it was not captured on film or even noticed by any witnesses present—the scientific community had disregarded it as fairytale, preconceived notions or retroactive memories, depending on who was conducting the research.
Myrime's Leave the Gun at the Table was my inspiration. I hope the end result is far enough from the original not to give offence.
“No guns. Precinct chief had first pick then the rest was shared between them like some sort of rank-based system. One poor rookie walked away with a can of beans.”
Tony Stark did not speak. Not to Steve. Not with words. The Commandos had met up in secret with the three members of the Stark Company as many as five times in the past few months. And Steve had yet to hear a peep out of the man. Steve wondered why he still went to those planning sessions. Bucky could easily stand in for him. But he couldn’t stay away. Tony’s glares had become a rare beam of sunshine in the bleakness he called his life.
But the team was not important. What was important was the information they let slip during the many many, oh too many, interrogations. When The Cap had first asked about shipping routes Tony had assumed it was because he wanted to use the routes himself. Then it dawned on him that they wanted to hit it, at which point he thought to reveal some of the old routes he no longer used but he remembered that even if he couldn’t see The Cap in the room, the man might be listening. Even if didn’t say “
