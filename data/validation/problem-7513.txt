“The collapse of the ancient caverns and the relocation of the clan treasures to your location proves beyond any shadow of a doubt that you are the proper heir to the title and that their acceptance of the interruption of your trial by combat was a dishonor on every clan leader who accepted it. A murder sits in a clan seat that should be yours, and no dragon can deny that the ancient laws have been violated.” Phil explained. Tony whistled a soft surprised sound, and Phil looked at him in startlement. “Did he never tell you how he came to leave?”
“You said it was one of your favorites.”
“No.” Tony replied firmly, muzzle wrinkled in disgust.
“So more than five?” Tony asked.
Tony was rarely not thinking, and so as he walked he contemplated the floor plan of Steve’s lair. With what he had learned yesterday it was clear that it had been designed with finding the artifacts in mind. Tony had thought Steve’s flashes of guilt when his past came up were because he had given up on whatever quest had brought him so far from other dragons. Despite that, it was clear that the three main suites had been designed for three artifact holders to share with three half human consorts while the pods along the wide outer hallway were for younger, unmated dragons to sleep comfortably alone. Three hallways lead down, one for the Library, one for the work shop, one for the big sandy room Tony suspected was meant to be a nursery. What colors would he see down there now that he had dragon eyes?
“I’m here looking for Anthony Stark. I heard he frequently keeps company with you.”
“If you are going to get all maudlin and ridiculous I’m cutting you off. Come on. Let’s get you into a bed.”
“He got what he had coming to him.” Pietro snarled.
Steve contemplated Tony for a moment. “Yeah,” he agreed. “Let’s do it that way.”
“There are only the six rooms, so it won’t take long to search the place.” Wanda offered quietly.
“You put it back?” Tony asked.

“Good point, but I still don’t think it counts as scientifically verified.”
“Rumiko has someone else. Maybe she met him today? Maybe she wasn’t lying when she said she was waiting for me, worrying about me?”
“No problem. I’m just lucky you decided to head out there in the snow. When we went to get the car I was pretty sure you were the only one who had been out there for days.”
Steve studied the three blank faced humans and then settled back on his haunches in his lecturing pose. “Right… so… most creatures resemble other creatures to some extent, like deer, which are similar to horses, which are similar to cows.” Tony nodded encouragingly, he had studied taxonomy. “But dragons don’t resemble anything else, not really, and that’s because everything like us died a long time ago. There was a great disaster, and whole continents worth of beings were exterminated all at once. A group of dragons saw the inevitable death that was approaching and hid themselves away deep in the earth to wait out the disaster. When they woke the world was completely different, but capable of supporting them again. They built themselves a new home on the surface and went about their lives until they realized the problem with not inviting their non-wizard brethren into their seclusion with them. After only a handful of generations the eggs stopped hatching. Their population was too small, and to closely related in the beginning, to be a viable foundation for re-establishing their species. They needed new dragons who weren’t related to them if they were to survive as a species, and all such candidates had been dead for millennia. They turned to magic to solve this problem, as they had turned to magic to solve all of their problems, and they discovered a solution. The three greatest among them gave their lives to combine all of the dragon’s magic into one artifact that exists in three parts. The artifact allows unrelated creatures to become dragon hybrids, capable of switching between their two forms at will. Eggs produced between a hybrid and a dragon hatch healthy young dragons.”
“How many ranks are there in dragon clans?” Nat asked.
“I thought about her a lot you know? While I was being held prisoner in that cave? I thought about all the time I had wasted, all the things I wanted to change when I got back. I was going to propose, have a real family again… like I haven’t had since before my parents died.”
“The dimensions of the limo?” Tony read hesitantly, not sure how those could be a problem Steve was working on.
“It went. Ann was kinda unpleasant to work for, real picky and kept changing her mind about where things went. I was beginning to think I might need to let Clint and Pietro come home without me so that everyone’s evening plans didn’t get ruined.”
“It’s annoying that they don’t mention Mary Cassat.” Natalie pitched in. “Amanda Root is the only major female character.”
“Oh. Is that why she needed help with them?” Tony asked.
“You say that like it’s a super power.”
“Tony’s car broke down.” Steve told the rest of the room firmly. “I told him he could stay here tonight. In the morning we’ll go over to Joey’s to get his car towed and fixed.”
"Yeah. Valentine is all about Valentine's Day. People come out here to renew their vows, lounge around in martini glass shaped hot tubs and hang their engraved tokens on the Tree of Hearts near the gazebo in the Garden of Lovers."
"I don't need to go to the hospital. A hotel will be fine."
“I figured. I’m marrying you, not your company.” Steve said.
“What does it matter?” asked the blond.
“Annie seemed quite sure of her information.” Steve kept Tony talking about paint colors all through breakfast and the drive back to the house. Once he had accepted the keys from Tony, and insisted that Tony keep one of the keys and one of the garage door openers for himself, he headed upstairs to flip through the paperwork that had been left in the desk. Tony had set up the electricity, the water, the gas and garbage pick up would happen on Wednesdays. Steve was now the proud owner of a six bedroom two and a half bath home with attached four car garage and a very run down looking fenced in yard. There was a computer set up on one of the two desks, so Steve logged into his school account and emailed Wanda and Natasha with his current address. He figured out that there was a phone in the desk as well when it rang to let him know his new appliances were on their way. He called Natasha on it while he waited for them, wandering the house, making lists of repairs he should likely see to.
“But we could not have all gone together, and after speaking with Phil about his clan we knew they would be no more open to Tony’s ideas than our own was.” Clint continued.
“This way Steve and Phil can stick with what they actually know, and the three of us can come up with a background other than ‘grew up human’ together.” Clint agreed.
“There should have been something…”
“Yeah. I’m older, by significant margin, and I’m big for my age.”
“Tony is not the one who is going to be opening the door.” Steve argued. “He can barely stand.”
“The star was one of the first clans, and their medallion has stayed the same for millennia. I vote against changing it.” Phil announced.
“You aren’t dragging us anywhere Stevie. None of us is unaware of just how bad this could be. The circus kidnapped people while I was with them. It never went well for the kidnappees. I’m sure it was just as bad if not worse when Wanda and Pietro’s dad kidnapped people. We are probably WAY more aware of the various ways this could go bad than you are, so if you insist on being stupid and brave and going after your boyfriend without any idea of who took him or why then we are coming too.”
“Why don’t I take you over to the store instead? They have a bigger variety, and usually their stuff is cheaper.”
“We, huh?” Steve asked with an odd, bright smile before hefting Tony into the air. “How tall are we together?”
“He did.”
“I somehow doubt that will take you very long to figure out,” Clint said dryly.
“Clint, Huh? Did he find himself a girl for Valentine’s day?”
“He’s not going to give up on the frostbite thing until he’s sure you’re OK.”
In Conclusion...
“I… there is nothing wrong with the room I started in, I’m just used to being able to see around our camp at night. It’s been a long time since I slept in a building, and the few I do sleep in are wood, and have windows.”
“What?”
“I’m surprised I didn’t wake Clint.”
“As high as we can get it.”
Tony slid into what he hoped was his seat, (There was a salad on the placemat and it was harder to get to the kitchen from there) while Steve stripped off his apron and brought the rest of the food over. “New car?” he asked.
“I got that right, when I came here.”
“I think it would likely be better if I go hunting alone. I can bring back something big while you and our guests stretch your wings over the lake.”
Sorry this is a bit late. I had some technical difficulties over the weekend, so you get this on Thursday instead.
Rumiko had not arrived, and Tony wandered over to Revolution Brewing with the rest of the displaced hotel guests, phone glued to his ear, struggling to locate the woman he may have lured into danger. That was where he was when she finally answered his call, told him she was busy with her date of the evening, and that she could not stay shackled to someone whose stock was taking the sort of downward dive that Stark Industries was experiencing. That was also where Steve found him, later that evening, long after the rest of the hotel guests had found themselves new lodging.
“I was a knight in my own clan, but I abandoned my shield when I left them. I refused to carry their colors any longer.”
“Oh… Well I don’t want a divorce, ever. That’s the point of getting married isn’t it? But I shouldn’t ever be the one running Stark industries either. So, whatever paperwork you need I’m fine with.” Steve replied.
“Uh, Hi. I’m Tony.” Tony freed one hand to wave absently into the new wall of silence. Three pairs of eyes blinked at him quietly while a rather large blond dog climbed into his lap and pinned him to the couch. “Uh, Hi….umm…Lucky? I think you are too big to be a lap dog. Really, really too big.” Tony pushed ineffectually at the dog who licked one of his hands gently, then settled in for a nap.
“Mmm. Yeah. I watched some of your more recent press conferences after we met. I think what you are doing with your company is very brave.”
“I don’t know… uh… the hotel really had everything we would have needed. It’s just that Rumi isn’t going to get here until evening and I needed something to do with myself. I wanted a distraction, not just sitting around my hotel room working and drinking. That’s the old me, you know? I’m trying to… be different? I do need to get my suit back from the dry cleaner before they close. If you come with I could give you your clothes back?”
“Crystal? What’s wrong?”
“I… well, hmm. May I ask what sort of need makes you willing to set up camp in front of my home?”
“Sure. Back in 1980, the then-new mayor of Valentine, a guy named Pierre Rousseau, wanted to boost the economy and attract more visitors to the small town, all year round, not just during Valentines week. He came up with the idea to create a garden which would eventually be named Lovers Garden and designed an annual festival around St. Valentine’s day. Slowly but surely, lovers from all over started coming to the lovers garden and partaking in the Saint Valentine’s day festival. Not millions of people but enough to keep the tiny town busy. Today Valentine’s festival attracts thousands of people from all over the world. There are fewer than nine hundred full time residents, but six hotels, 3 chocolatiers, and an engraver whose entire shop is dedicated to the heart shaped leaves you noticed in the garden. Valentine has sister cities in France and Japan. So we get a lot of tourists from outside the country as well. Finished with your milk?”
“Imbolc?”
“Clint and I tried to protect you from judgement, but it was obvious the clan had no future. We wanted to leave, and we wanted to stay together. Clint could have gone with Phil to his clan…” Nat started.
Their next stop proved to be the garage of an old brick home. Concrete steps carved their way through a hill to reach the front door, but Tony turned the corner to get to the garage nestled against the back of the house. The garage door took them into what may have been a living room if it had been furnished, and Steve could see the granite expanse of a kitchen counter dividing the room he was in from a kitchen before Tony tugged him along up another set of stairs.
“Nah. He says I always pick up the same type of girl like that and that I deserve better. I ask him where I’m supposed to find better in Valentine and he suggests I try being single for a while, but I’m not like him, I’m not happy going to the festivals by myself or just with friends.”
“And then you go home to Clint and Pietro?”
“I think the star will make a nice focal point among the more complex carvings on the headstone.” Tony answered. “Plus, leaving it as is shows that you refuse to be changed by the actions of the corrupt, and I like that message. Hey! Does this mean the rest of us get shields too? Are we squires right now, or knights?”
“So dragons look to meet others at the gatherings and festivals. Most of the dragons any given clan sends anywhere else are unmated. When two dragons decide they want to try things out they head off on a… Honeymoon? I think is the human term? They make a nest for themselves, stock up on food, and try to lay their eggs at the beginning of winter. The eggs need to be brooded constantly, but that is no hardship in winter and early spring if the dragons have properly prepared. If they timed things right the eggs will hatch in the summer when fresh food is plentiful. Hatchlings don’t have to be tended constantly the same way eggs do. They mostly sleep and eat. That gives the parents more time to hunt for them so they can grow properly. Once the offspring fledge the parents present them to a clan elder, usually of one of their clans, but presenting offspring is one of the ways dragons can change clans without negative repercussions. If the clan elder accepts the fledgling he gives it an adult name and it becomes a squire in that clan. Any future eggs the couple produces can be laid in the clan nursery and raised by the clan as a whole.”
“We should discuss whether we want to change the medallion or not first.”
Steve waited until everyone had pulled themselves back together before heading out to confront the humans. The three newcomers watched as he spun the wheel that lifted the inner gate, then stepped into the vestibule to maneuver the bars that operated the outer gate. He padded out alone and initially ignored Obie again to approach Dum Dum Dugan. “I hope that rush yesterday wasn’t a sign of something wrong?” The bulky red head said with clear concern, fiddling slightly with his bushy mustache.
The two chatted through Tony’s shopping, and the picking up of the dry cleaning. Tony obviously getting steadily more nervous as the evening wore on. Steve tried to keep up a cheerful chatter as Tony checked his phone neurotically waiting for some sign the Rumiko was on her way. It was not that desire for cheerful chatter that led Steve to ask Tony if he smelled smoke.
“I’m not sure I’ve ever even visited a place as small as Valentine before. How did you end up here?”
“I’ll… Keep that in mind?”
In 616 Alexi refers to Natasha as his ‘Krasivaya Paook’ (spelling from comic), his beautiful spider. I don’t speak any Russian, so if I messed up his line that’s all on me.
“You want me to pick you up anything special to drink while I’m out?”
The apartment smelled amazing, tomatoes and garlic, spices and seafood. He couldn’t help but stop and admire Steve for a moment. Steve’s broad shoulders were really filling out that lovely blue crewneck sweater. Steve’s casual but nice sweater and black slacks combo made Tony relax about his own choice of clothing. He’d spent the morning tossing clothes around before deciding on a fairly normal (for him) combination of a classic T and a blazer. Steve must have heard the door closing, or maybe Tony’s sigh of relief, because he chose that moment to turn and gesture Tony over to the little table set up between the couch and the kitchen bar. Last time Tony had seen that table Wanda and Natasha had been painting their nails there. Now it was covered with a white table cloth and candles, with little heart napkin holders set up on heart shaped place mats.
“OK. How do we do that?” Nat asked.
“Whatever,” Wanda rolled her eyes at her brother. “I’m talking here. Anyway, Clint thinks Steve looks just like the guy and started calling him Cap ages ago. The nickname kinda stuck. Everyone uses it. They call the lot of us Cap’s kooky quartet.”
“Nope.” Wanda replied. “Even in 2006 historical women aren’t getting credit for their work. They exist to be love interests.”
“I don’t know if I can arrange that, he is a good friend but…”
“I was being sarcastic.”
“I’ve dated lots of people Steve. It can’t be simple incompatibility with all of them.”
“Were you happy with Rachel?”
“Memorials,” Phil added. “When dragons die they are buried with their shields and a shield shaped mound is built over them.”
“Bright yellow has its place… but I don’t know if that place is on walls. Clint and I helped Annie and George… the couple down the hall from us? Set up their second bedroom as a nursery. Annie said that she wanted to do a soft yellow unisex nursery, but she read in one of her baby books that yellow is a bad color for nurseries because it makes babies restless.”
“I’ve seen pacemakers. This thing is the size of my fist, and most of his sternum has to have been carved out to make room for it.”
“I make bad life choices? That doesn’t mean that letting the guys in suits in to see that Tony is fine is a bad idea.”
“I suspect that might be my father. The carriage is marked with our Stark heraldry.” They were silent for a moment. Steve had never asked Tony why he came to the lair, anymore than Tony had asked Steve what had driven him from the dragon lands to cross an ocean and settle among humans. Neither was willing to alienate the other by asking too many questions.
“I know that… but sometimes I don’t think you realize how much I enjoy just having you around. If we’d spent the night at my apartment watching movies from the 90s the only things I would have regretted are the size of my bed and the lack of privacy.”
“I’m uninterested in her,” Josh said easily.
Tony felt insecure with his mother now. How did she know about his first relationship? Did His mother really read his mind? Or probably Jarvis told her about everything? He needed to confirm it after this.
“Wanda is right. Fifty dollars for 3 weeks.”
As they started the walk to Peter's group, Jarvis mouthed something to Tony.
“It is being repaired, since yesterday, probably tomorrow I can go back using the car again.” And his gaze moved from Steve to Peter. “So, what are you talking about before, kiddo?”
“Make me.” Steve challenged.
Tony was sure that he felt overwhelmed by joy in his gut now. He knew that Jarvis like Peter too, but he didn’t know this much.
“You can keep being like that, Tony. I just want to do some little business with you,” The mysterious man spoke towards him. As Tony recognized the sound, he groaned and moved his back towards the man.
He blew out his breath in a strong roar and a large golden flame shot towards the soldiers. Those who were hit by bursts instantly melted to the bone, their bodies falling into the snow mixed with the melt of the armor they were wearing. Some of the soldiers who managed to escape, but were still hit by the blast immediately fell to the ground with some of their bodies melting. Not stopping them, the warrior who managed to evade immediately ran towards him. Also came other soldiers surrounded from the other side.
“Yeah I know, I already see what the reason you came here and that’s making me think you are a bother.” He kept replying as his face was on the couch.
“Really!!”
“It’s nice to see you again Peter,” Jarvis said fondly.
“When the trip is over?” Tony asked back.
“Alright, let’s do it,” Tony said as he took another sip on his drink.
As they parted to take their breath, Tony blurted out between his breaths. “That’s not fair, Steve.” Steve just chuckled and gave another quick kiss. Tony accepted it with defeat. Tony liked seeing Steve blushing, he looked really cute and he never got enough with it. While Steve thought the same about Tony.
“Think about it if you work with us. The profit will be boosted up, and your name will be known more.” The bald man kept begging and the brunette stopped walking, turned to the bald-headed while he fixed his left sleeve. The bald man couldn’t see his eyes because it was being hidden by his dark glasses. The brunette wore raven long sleeve shirt leave 2 untied buttons from the neck, black leather jacket, and grey dark jeans.
“You know Steve, Bucky.” The woman smiled at the man.
“Your mother knows her son best.” She was amused by the look on Tony’s face.
“I ... We are on field t'ip. And I lose everyone. I thought I was lost until I found you, Tony” Peter now looked directly to Tony with glassy eyes.
“You’re not mad?” that came from his mouth automatically, and he was shocked by himself. His mother who saw it was just smiling warmly. “Why should I? I remember you admit publicly that you’re Bi and some of the news about your affair.” His Mother said lightly without any worried. She looked back at Tony with full of care and love.
“Aww come on Jarvis, you already see that guy’s contract? There’s nothing good in it. Besides I still remember when we first gave him our proposals.” The brunette spoke up.
“Just, only one.”
“Are we already in front of them, Mr. Jarvis?” Peter asked.
“Oh really then, I think we can manage that, I know where they went.”
Steve already used with that look. He couldn’t blame anyone or anything. He didn't look attractive to gain someone attention. He already accepted every day would receive that look. Because why not, he was skinny and short. Steve used to have many sicknesses when he was a kid. Sometimes he felt, needed to thank that he was still alive until today. Because when he was a kid, the Doctor who was handling him repeatedly said to his mother that his chance to survive is incredibly small. How did Steve know that? He accidentally overheard it and found his mother cried at that night. He promised to be strong every time and each day since then. This day, he was healthy and walks proudly to his university that accepted him. He still remembered when he gave the acceptance envelope to his mother, said he got accepted. He never saw his mother cried happily and hug him tight. Her face looked 10 years younger than her age. Of course Bucky too. He informed his mother about his acceptance.
Chapter 01
~×○×~
Not what Steve did predict, his first cover video about him and his guitar acoustic singing “it happens to be me” by Nat King Cole, reached two and a half million viewers without help from his friends, his celebrity friends’ help. After that Bucky and Natasha knew and (of course) shared his video on their media social. And then Clint, Thor, followed by Wanda, Pietro, Vision and the other. They even encouraged him to make another cover video. Sam who knew this, of course, joined them and shared his video too.
Tony looked at Steve who has shocked face either, who still stood and freeze beside him. His brain really in short circuit, no! In damage, because he who always being called genius couldn’t process what he had heard that time, even Steve.
“What do you like about him?”
“N-No, I’m fine Sam” Steve replied as he cleared his throat.
” Steve answered as his lips were only a millimeter with Tony’s.
Tony tilted his head and saw Josh near him. His handsome and cold appearance, and black glasses on his face, firm jaw, dark slick hair, and nice cross metal neckless hanging on his neck. Sometimes Tony wondered why this guy was still single.
Tony finished his breakfast quickly and went outside the dining room silently. The old lady gave a disapproving look to the old man and then went back to finishing her breakfast while the old man just rolled his eyes carelessly. Tony spun back to his room, he wore his AC/DC shirt and long, tight jeans. He jumped into his bed and found himself sinking in it. He was really in a bad mood caused by his father and now, he would be in no mood at all for today except for meeting with his boyfriend. There was a light knock on his door, and he yelled: “Come In.”
“I still can hear that music from here.” A deep man’s voice came as the person entered the Kitchen.
On his way, he saw a sword stuck in the snow. The sword was not very deep and maybe he could pull it out because the sword was not stuck in hard objects. However, what caught his attention was not a sword, but a body that lay rigid next to it. The Brunette man thought he might be a criminal or runaway slave. The location may be now in a wild area, not a public route that people often take. Many monsters or wild animals that could attack at any time.
She looked back to Tony and sat on the edge of his bed. “So, has he already replied to your message?”
“Yeah, it’s a beautiful song. It’s not my song; I just translate it into English.”
“Like your mother said, Anthony. Mother knows his son best.”
“Come on Nat, not you too.”
“Oh-oh, we go to fil’d tip today as I said this mo’ning, but I got lost and Tony found me with Mr. Jarvis.” Peter kept describing his experience as Steve move a glace from Peter to Tony to Peter. He could see a smile from Tony face watching Peter explaining to Steve. Tony didn’t do differently. He watched Peter and gave a glance towards Steve either and found Steve was smiling either.
He knew it would help his finance and he would have a lot of time with Peter, but to think about the consequence. He didn’t want to risk their privacy and other things. He wanted Peter to have a normal life, and he was fine with what he has now. Bucky and Natasha always teamed up to encourage him to do it. In the end, he opened his first channel on YouTube and started to cover some of the songs he liked, posted it just to shut their mouth.
“Wow Steve, does your head hit something?” Clint smiled as he teased Steve and being hit at the back of his head by Natasha. “Ouch!” Clint gave a dirty expression to Natasha, but she looked at him with the LOOK ‘if you said another word, I’m confident...’
“And what? You go home and not knowing your own fans?”
Suddenly he heard a scream not far from where he was standing. A woman fell down in the snow while hugging a girl, protecting her from the soldiers who walked toward them. It was seen that the soldier chased and swung his sword and the woman spread her wings, separating herself and the girl from the soldier. Without wasting time, he ran and swung his fist towards the soldier's helmet. The soldier flew away due to his fist and fell to the ground. He went back to the soldier, just in time to catch him swinging his sword towards him. He dodged and slammed his fist into the soldier's chest, making him fly a few meters from him with broken chest plates.
“W…well actually...” He tried answering but being cut by Bucky.
The moment the situation seemed to be on his side, a black-robed man approached. He wore jet-black silver armor. A symbol like an octopus in red was painted on the blazing black robe. The man looked at him with great admiration and greed. Only with that view did he feel an unbearable fear, as if only with that view he knew he would not be safe.
“And who is the little kid?” his mother showed the photo to him, the Photo of him, Steve, and Peter at Steve's apartment. They were eating ice-cream cake bought by Tony for Peter because of Peter's 2nd place in the science competition for kids. On that photo, they were covered by cream and ice-cream cake. Tony and Peter were starting their food war. Tony smeared an ice-cream on Peter's cheek and Peter did the same to Tony's chin, and that how their food war began. Steve had tried to stop them, but both of them had teamed up against him and attacked Steve on his forehead and his cheek. Steve, of course, joined them and had his revenge. In the end, Steve ordered them to clean their mess. Before they did it, Tony told them to take a photo for that day. That day was the happiest day Tony ever had.
They would directly attack every person with wings, horns, and tail without mercy. Many had fallen and were lying lifelessly in the snow. Their wings broke and lay rigidly full of pricks in their bodies. Not knowing what to do, he ran to drive the residents to safety. The Children, women and old people ran to save themselves while the male population ran to attack and detain the soldier. Their wings spread wide, their hands turned into large scale arms with very sharp iron claws, and some who fought seemed to have magic circles on their arms.
“I wonder what the title of that song.” Tony's breath was no different with Steve as he closed his eyes again and moved his face, while his lips got closer with Steve’s lips.
Playlist
“I was thinking the same thing,” Sarah replied and placed a plate with scrambled egg and fried bacon in front of Bucky. The long messy hair brunette man with piercing silver-blue eye looked confused with the plate in front of him. When he wanted to say something, Sarah cut his word.
“I am exactly wondering if you already used to be treated like that, is it convinces me enough for not do something to her,” she said with a low voice.
“No, it’s fine. Besides I don’t have anything to do this time, right Jarvis?” Tony asked Jarvis.
"WHAT ARE YOU CRAZY, PUNK?!" He shouted back.
“He became his fans because Tony Stark is his idol,” Bucky said. He was entertained by a blush that spread on Steve’s face.
“You really are an ungrateful shit, aren’t ya,” he said as throwing the couch pillow directly to Tony’s head. “What I was trying to say is even the Director didn’t like your relationship with pepper because it was risking your fame. I’m still fighting for it.” Josh said as he fixed his leather jacket.
“O-Oh -it's nothing, nothing important, Sam.” Steve blurted out without even realized it. Sam noticed that his face was getting red. Sam did not ask more about it and started to ask about work. Steve replied and until their bus arrived, they kept talking about market, supply, and demand, and marketing strategy. However, Sam knew that there something wrong and he knew what it was. He has just ignored it until he has a chance to ask him again.
Today was only Bucky, Natasha, Clint, and him at the park. The others had an afternoon session while they had a morning class. They talked relating to class, job, work, and other things. Bucky suddenly talked about Steve’s interest for Tony Stark. He told the rest about him was being a fan of Tony Stark.
“Steve, come down already, or you’re gonna be late.” The lady with blond shoulder-length hair shouted from the kitchen counter, placed the breakfast and finished the Bacon that she was cooking. She wore a baby blue aprons and a nurse uniform under it, the lady still could hear the music from the stairs.
“Yeah whatever, besides the offering he gave is not offering a considerable potential at all. I completely waste my time on that.” Anthony pouted.
“I was planning to pick you up, but I guess Tony already did it,” Steve interjected as he stood from his chair. “I think I’m going ahead, Sam. See you tomorrow,” Steve said as he took Peter’s hand and started to walk.
“As I can hear you clearly! Told you that I was just checking my thing and then come down after done.” Steve replied as he took the sketchbook from Bucky’s hand. He put the sketchbook into the bag and walk towards the radio to turn it off.
Tony who was confused now moved his face from looking at his mother to Jarvis. As Jarvis knew his mind either, he just shook his head silently. Tony knew his butler would never lie to him, even a slightest and now his secret boyfriend known by his Mother. He felt really numb for the first time because he really didn’t know how to answer his mother.
‘It’s a good morning, Tony. We eat breakfast and Peter told me what he’s doing today at school.’
He glanced back at the sword. Full of rust, many cuts, and even the sword had been serrated. Could be seen the sword looks shabby because of age. Snow areas like this would easily make sword rust or even crack.
------------------------------
"WHA-! HOW ABOUT YOU?"
‘I will, so what place is he gonna visit then?’ Before Steve could reply, he realized that Peter was looking at him with a knowing smirk.
There was a lot thing happened in a year, even another year before they started their relationship. They started it in a rough way. They even hated each other at the first time they met, but after what happened between them, between everything. They knew that they were more than that, and they were really grateful about it. Because Tony as an heir of Stark industry and Steve need to take care of Peter, they needed to keep their relationship low profile and kept it as a secret. Both of them were not happy with this, but they have to if they want to fight their love, they have to because they didn't want to lose each other
The Brunette man approached the sword and held the handle. He knew the possibility of the sword being pulled out was very small considering there was magic surrounding him, but he still tried it. He pulled the sword but didn't move at all. He kept pulling the sword until he suddenly felt something strange coming from the sword. The sword began to glow orange and golden yellow. He also realized that the air around him began to feel warm.
“Wait, WHAT?” Bucky just stood up from the bed and ran towards Steve who already started eating his breakfast.
Josh, who looked stuck by Tony statement, sat straight. “Alright, what’s the condition?”
Steve looked fully at her. Realized that Natasha had a good talent as modeling, but he never knew she would get that offering from that famous magazine. Remembered that Natasha only worked as modeling for a part-time job. But that was… wow.
‘Just like yours.’ Steve typed the reply with a grin.
As he started to stand, Bucky was offering his hand to him. Steve accepted it and stood by his best friend’s help.
“I didn’t see the profit on your contract. In fact, you are so desperate to put me into the contract while sold my name to some company for marketing and advertisement before we even meet,” the brunette said. “You are so confident to think I will accept your contract huh? And I remember you even didn’t give a chance to our very first contract before. Don’t remember? Shame on you then. Well now, I don’t have time to deal with you. Need going for recording to my new single.” The brunette turned and walked away. The bald man dumbfounded and suddenly realized that they were by now on the entrance and there was already a black limo waiting in front of them. The brunette ran towards the limo. When he opened the door, the brunette turned to the bald man and smiled amusingly.
“I remember you sounding like that when you were still 7.” His Mother beamed with joy, Tony could see it from her face.
“What model?” a blonde man stood in front of them as they reach the main park. They look at the group who greeted and wave them there.
“Is that Uncle Tony you texten’ with?”
“Yeah, I got. It’s already a year now.” He felt his face start overheating.  Admitting something like this to his Mother was something he never had done since his first relationship with someone, he never even told his parents about his first girlfriend.
“So Nat, how is your photo shot going?” he asked as tried to cool down the red-headed mind.
“Ah god ok, Buck. I like Tony Stark. I’m collecting his songs and albums, and sometimes following an article about him.” Steve groaned with his own confession. Why he didn’t drop it just like that?
“Why not telling Jarvis at fir-,” He asked but being interrupted by Jarvis.
“I’m just checking our singer, and that’s what I get.” he sighed and sat on the single couch near him.
“Something happens, Nat?” Steve tried cooling her down, searching a reason from Natasha’s mood.
“Why I need to do that thing?”
“Oh, Natasha and Bucky got an offering to be in the magazine for the first time,” Steve said as they approached the group. The blonde who looked at that pair just held his laugh as he knew what they were thinking.
“Good, now we-.” Before Josh could complete his word, Tony interrupted.
Anthony E. Stark or as known as Tony Stark was a famous artist singer, actor, celebrity, and an heir of Stark Industry after Howard Stark. He was quite enjoying his fame, but for over time, it was also getting really tiring. All people believed Tony Stark was becoming a singer is because he is just really like to play around. Known as playboy, billionaire, genius, was not enough, which was how people think. Tony knew all of the statement was wrong. He had the real reason to become a singer and just wanted to keep it that way.
He simultaneously looked away in the other direction as he heard a loud roar. Seen two to three dragons roaring and spitting out very hot flames. The warriors who were hit by the bursts immediately melted along with their armor. Some people who were still half-human was also raising magic circles in front of their mouths and spitting fire at the soldiers, blocking those who were advancing.
“So what was Peter asking you earlier?”
“HAHAHA Let them be, my friend. Shall the fate show us next.”
Jealousy bloomed over him and Tony felt someone almost replaced him for Peter. He needed to talk to Bruce about this. Jarvis who quietly watched Tony chuckled by himself.
The man showed no fear at all. There were no signs that he would back down or hesitate. The man remained standing there, not changing his position, but his eyes were increasingly radiating with admiration and greed. His face smiled so disgustingly while pulling his sword that still gloved.
He sighed from his imagination. It was impossible to be able to have a chance to talk to Tony Stark, the famous singer, just like a daylight dream. He heard a knock from the door and before could answer, the person opened by kicking it and shouted. “WAKEY-WAKEY STEVIE”
“What’s the problem if I become a fan of Tony Stark?” Steve snapped, his ear started to changing color to the shade of pink.
“For the person who was awarded as the sexiest man alive, your words don’t suit your title, Thor.”
The brunette smiled and the bald man did the same. Thinking the person he begged suddenly changed his mind.
Someone coughed beside them, Steve and Tony who heard it instantly separated and looked to the source of that damn sound (in Tony’s opinion). There were Jarvis and Peter who stood in front of them. Peter’s eyes were being blocked by Jarvis’s hands.
“Oh yeah, I remember that clearly,” He said and the Brunette hum winningly. “But Anthony, that’s not the way to treat someone,” Jarvis said sternly.
“Yup, I found him listening to his song in his playlist a week ago and again this morning in his room.” Bucky smiled winningly.
He felt so lucky for having a best friend who cared enough for him. But sometimes he was worried about his friend’s ‘avenged’ act and hoped they would stop doing it. Another story about ‘avenged’ is his male friends: Bucky, Vision, Thor, Sam, Clint, and Peter Quill. But yeah that was for another story.
“I’m sure Peter even know this.”
Steve was working his report about the latest product that just released on the market. After he had done some research, he tried to search the survey he did for the next upcoming product.
The Brunette man muttered while walking amidst a snowstorm. He tried to look around, hoping he found a cabin, a cave, or a suitable place to spend the night. It would be impossible to continue traveling in the middle of the night with an ongoing snowstorm. Plus, he could not see clearly what was in front of him. He quickly tried to walk to find a shelter.
“What do you want to eat?” Sam asked as he got out from his desk. Steve got out as well and brought his note and his little bag.
“Steve, that’s not a big deal.” She sighed.
"GO! I WILL DISTRACT THEM!” He shouted while protecting himself with the shield from the arrow of fire that flew towards them.
They were on their way to the university. Their house was quite close and every day, Steve and Bucky would walk together and separated when they already reached the main garden. Bucky was on the Law Major while Steve was on the Art Major. Their building was in the opposing direction from each other. So they could meet when did not have any class or would return home together or hang-out with their friends.
“A lot, Steve. A lot,” Natasha answered. “You probably know all about the news and his gossip.”
“Hahaha, that’s Stevie to you.”
He ran back to the other soldiers as he raised his wings, preparing himself in an attacking position to retrieve a shield while running. When he took a deep breath, a magic circle appeared right in front of his mouth, he felt the heat rising from his throat spread to his mouth cavity. So hot that faint steam and light were coming out of his mouth.
“Are you jealous?” he smirked in his same position, but Josh could see it.
“Wh- I- How about you getting ready now, or you gonna be late” Steve blurted out and there was a slight blush on his check. Peter spun around to look at the clock on the wall.
Thought the man. Whatever it was, he could be certain the person was a runaway slave. He saw many slaves who ran away from their masters because of improper treatment. Most of them ran into the forest to hide from their hunters.
Because of that, they like them. Steve understood their reason and respected them for it, but sometimes he also wondered about it. When Peter was three years old, Steve was paying more attention to him than anything. Sometimes he talked with other parents about parental life, and sometimes he got invited to neighbor's party. Of course, none of the single people ever paid attention to him because he was scrawny and he was not attractive at that time, also because Steve had Peter. Steve was not bothered about it because his main priority was taking care of Peter, and he used to be unnoticed like that. However, Three years from that he developed muscles, filled up, his jaw became sharper, he had a late growth spurt which led to him being taller and also had a stable work and income. Then, all girls started paying attention to him. Some of his neighbors offered their daughter to meet up, and some even convinced him to do it for Peter so he can have a chance to have a mother figure. However, he always declined politely.
"PETER! Hey dear, what are you doing here?" Tony asked, kneeling in front of Peter and holding him tight as if his life depended on him. His last meeting with Peter was three days ago and Tony could not stop missing him.
“Yeah, I'm done.” Steve saw his watch on his desk. It was 11:52 AM. He was really loss of time that easily.
“Peter, what are you gonna do at school today?” the blond asked as he folded his newspaper. He gazed at the kid.
“Maria, it's time.” His father yelled from the hall. Maria who heard it just sighed and stood. Before she walked away, she looked at Tony directly. “It's not over Anthony, I will ask about it again and make sure that you introduce me to him and his son,” she said as she walked out of the room.
“Yeah I know, that’s the reason to bring you here to reject them properly,” Jarvis confessed.
“Wow Steve, I never know,” Clint said disbelief with a fake gasp.
“Not that good and not that bad.”
“As you can hear, we’re done.”
"Yes, even when he was with your friend too, with Dr. Banner. They didn't even stop talking about biology and science."
He muttered something and a magic circle appeared at the base of his sword. Strongly, he stuck the sword into the snow and a golden chain appeared from the blade of the sword to his ankles and tied him.
“Tony, you’re not gonna become like this without them. Just consider this as a thank word.” Josh added as he put the file on the table. Tony was known the best about it, some part of him whispered that word is right but another's like to say ‘fuck you.’ Even if he had a fan, Tony still could see them were like to claim a bad thing about him. His bad rumors, false gossip and even mentioned ‘the deathly merchant.' No one knew the truth of Tony Stark. That’s why he was always rejecting the meet and greet-event.
Steve knew what Tony was meant to. But he couldn’t help it. Tony was too cute to be teased.
“BUCK” Steve yelled back. “Could you come in normally?”
"NO! YOU HAVE TO BRING THE OTHER PEOPLE REMAINED TO A SAFE AND MEET FATHER THERE! ”
“Sam. It’s nice to see you.” Steve greeted.
“Aww come on, Pep. It’s fun to see them like that.”
“I actually approved your relationship with her,” Josh said as he started playing with his phone. “You two really make a good couple.”
“Nope, na-ah. No excuse this time.” Josh replied.
“Are you gonna reply Tony’s message?”
“No of course not, he actually talked a lot about science and engineering while we take a tour.”
“That.”
“Oh really?” His mother started to smirk.
The skinny blond examined his bag and searched for other equipment for today’s class. Sat on the edge of his bed and listened to the music through the radio. He liked listening to music, but his favorite was the one who was sung by Tony Stark. He loved how his voice flowed with the lyrics as could feel what the men indeed felt.
“Whatever, Rogers,” she said as rolled her eyes, gave a knowing look to Steve. Bucky, who kept silent, cleared his throat to gain their attention.
“Oh interesting, I wonder what song is that” Tony chuckled.
“WHAT THE ....” Steve almost swore by the sudden appearance of his kid.
“What?” Steve asked playfully.
“I already made a song for my next video cover,” Steve confessed.
Tony unlocked his phone, opened the gallery and sought the photo of his boyfriend. After he found one, one of his favorite photos where his boyfriend was smile straight to his face (his phone) and showed it to his mother. His mother looked at it and looked back at Tony.
Anthony can visibly see the slight of amusement on the corner of his butler’s mouth. Oh, he absolutely a manipulative bastard!!
“Yeah Peter, I guess I’m gonna join you guys tonight. Huh...” Tony realized something, something that Peter said. He called Tony what?
It was sunny day morning in Queens, warm air spread everywhere, and the light of the morning sun beaming through the window.
, Mary is a genius. Even her husband, Richard and she graduated faster than other college students and were accepted into the famous company. Of course, Steve realized that their intelligence was passed on to Peter's too. However, he realized that his (now) son had been so observant on his surrounding, he wondered that since when Peter concluded Tony and Him were a thing.
“Because you are the famous singer, Tony Stark.”
They started walking to the main park.
At the long dining table, there was a brunette guy who just poked his breakfast blankly and kept staring at his phone near his plate. He wondered why his boyfriend was not replying his message. He snapped back from his mind as he heard someone cleared his throat. He looked up and found another old man with white hair and grumpy face in his left side and an old lady with concerned face in front of him.
“You need to stop that,” Tony said as he was fighting his embarrassment.
“I love you too, Peter. And I will always protect you. You are my treasure, my precious one.” Steve murmured to his son’s ear. After a moment, Steve released Peter from his embraced, Peter smile brightly and Steve returned to smile happily at him too.
“PAPA!! DADDY!! COME ON.” yelled Peter from distance.
“He is really handsome. I can see why you really like him.” his mother teased.
“I’m a lone wolf. It’s none of your business.” He settled himself.
----------------------0o0--------------------
“I hope you stop staring at your phone while eating, Tony,” the old man grumbled and went back to eat his breakfast. Tony tried to hold himself from rolling his eyes and went back eating his. He really didn't want to have a ‘yelling session' with his old man, after he already got a photo of the most adorable kids from his boyfriend. He swept his phone, unlocked it and opened the latest photo he got and reread the message again. He wished that he was in there at that time, imagined the little kid jumped and squealed joyfully while told them his story with his boyfriend by his side. However, for now, he just ate his breakfast and held an urge to yell at someone.

--------------------=========++++++++0++++++++=========------------------
Steve and Peter walked on a sidewalk towards the nearby bus stop, they walked together to Peter's school bus stop and after that Steve would go to work by bus that came 10 minutes after Peter's school bus. While they walked there, Peter walked beside Steve, holding his hand, and told his entire plan for the field trip. Sometimes his neighbors would come out and greet them. All people who live in the locality liked both of them, especially Peter. Steve could guess their reason for adoring his son, after all, who would not fall in love with adorable, cheerful, energetic 7 years old child.
Sometimes their neighbor would give Peter some cookies, or have a little bit chat with both of them, or just greet them. And Peter would always reply with his one-gigawatt smile. Because of that smile, Steve always got the impression that Peter was actually his biological son. For those who already knew Steve long enough would understand that Peter is actually his cousin's son who died by car crash five years ago, and Steve took full custody to raise Peter even he was still a college student at that time. His entire neighbor knew how much he struggled to take care of Peter while still in his early twenties. When everyone who was the same age as him were still willing to have fun, partying, or hanging out with their friends, but Steve never did any of it. His one and only priority was to take care of Peter
“Really? I heard you got an offering to be one of the models for the Fashion magazine.”
Suddenly they found the group of elementary school students and a teacher who talked with one of security. The teacher saw Peter and two adults with him. She felt relieved, but stunned by the appeared of one and only Tony Stark with him.
Tony took his phone instantly from his mother’s hand and saw the message. He sighed in relief knowing that his boyfriend was on his way to work. He typed the reply and looked back to his mother who was grinning, at him.
“Of course Stevie, while listening to your idol’s song again and again. If that radio can speak, it’s probably already yelled at you to come down because your mom has called more than once.” He grinned as jumped into Steve’s bed. Reached the sketchbook that near him.
~×○×~
Their faces began to show fear; even some soldiers began to step back. He can feel their fear clearly, hear their rapid heartbeat, and their heavy sweat flowing or their heavy breathing and their body trembling. However, the man did not.
Suddenly Steve moved his hand to Tony's jaw and wiped the ice-cream on his chin with his thumb, and lick it. Tony didn’t know if his brain is still functional or not.
Peter looked at his dad and asked literally the same question. “When am I gonna call Tony Daddy?” Steve just stared at Peter long enough, he could feel the blush starting to rise from his cheeks and wondered how his son could be thinking of something like that.
Natasha knew Steve’s feeling. His face filled with a genuinely happy and grateful feeling. One of the reasons Natasha wanted to be friend with him is that Steve is full of honesty. He didn’t lie or faking with himself. Steve was always a straight type of people, so when he wanted to help someone, he would do it entirely.
. Now, he was going to have some revenge for taking Peter’s interest from him.
That night, the Rogers and Barnes family did a Dinner together for celebrating their son’s acceptance. He already accepted for being skinny and short and didn’t care what everyone said to him.
“How is she-” Tony was confused and wanted to ask more, but being interrupted by Jarvis.
“But in one condition.”
“I really wondered how long are they gonna think they keep this?”
“Aww man, can you at least forget to bring your lunch one day and buy food outside?
-------------------==---====+++++O0o0O+++++====---==------------------
“So why you are here Peter?” Jarvis asked as he looked at Peter but not released their hug.
His mother showed him his phone again, not only the photo but also the message this morning. “He is really indeed beautiful, Tony.” She said with sincerity. Tony's face started becoming the shade of red. “And he is replying to your message.”
“He-.” Tony found hard to answer. There was a lot of the reason why he really fell for his boyfriend. Kind, nice, gentle, care, and other good thing was not the only reason he like him, but there was also something- something different about him that make he like his boyfriend. Why he tried really hard to keep this relationship. Why this relationship lasted a year, this was the longest relationship Tony ever had. There was something his boyfriend had that he really wanted to have. Different from other people he knew. “He is different.” He blurted out without thinking.
“Yeah, we are now,” Jarvis replied as he released Peter from his hand. Peter ran towards Tony who was blushing furiously, Steve’s face was no different from Tony’s.
While Tony continued explaining, his mother looked at other photos, saw another photo of him, Peter, and Steve, and she smiled at the photo. Tony noticed his mother’s face has changed. “Something wrong, ma?”
“What?! Really?!” Clint asked, and his face showed he was diffident with Bucky’s confession.
“Coming ma!”
“Yeah, let’s go,” Jarvis said cheerfully tone as he stood and held Peter’s hand to direct him. Peter suddenly took action to take Tony’s hand too. He knew that Peter is adorable, but this was too much for him.
"You will be my best collection." The man muttered. Although it sounds very subtle, he could hear it very clearly along with the feeling of fear and danger that began to envelop every bone in his body.
Before he could answer, an arrow with black magic flew towards them. They jump in the opposite direction. He saw a group of warriors and magicians who cast black spells and archers who positioned to shoot. He chanted something along with the appearance of a strange symbol enveloping his sword. The sword glowed and instantly blazed with blue flames and lightning sparks. He immediately swung the sword, the blue flame immediately spread towards them, enveloping the entire area as if slashing and enveloping the soldiers, and the lightning spark struck the people who were there.
-------------------==---====+++++O0o0O+++++====---==------------------
“WAIT PAPAA!” Steve started laughing louder.
“Oh really.” Steve felt challenged and did the same, he poked his ice-cream directly on Tony's lip. Before Tony could lick it, Steve instantly licked it. Steve kissed Tony deeply. Slowly back from surprised thought, Tony start kissed Steve back. Tony even released an accident moan while Steve hungrily entered his tongue inside Tony's mouth.
As he kept resting. Put his hand on his eyes. He heard the door was being opened.
“I can’t even imagine Steve is being that kind of person.” Clint snickered and Bucky tried to hold his laugh that failed he did.
Tony started to blush, he really didn’t know how to handle his mother. He knew his mother was supportive of him, but he had never thought about this. He tried to collect his mind, all about what was his activity on the recording studio and Stark industry. He was upset knowing his last activity most was in SI, but for now, he let it aside.
“YEAH, Daddy Tony will go too right?” Peter asked toward Tony.
¬----------------------0o0----------------------
“You were always smiling while textin’ with him,” Peter said with pride.
“Are you serious? Really?” Bucky asked disbelief.
“Only for one,” Tony said. If he was going to make this, it was going to end as well.
"ALRIGHT! I AM BEHIND YOU!"
Tony poked his ice-cream near Steve's mouth, Steve surprised by it, but even more surprised by Tony who moved his head toward Steve's and licked the ice-cream directly from his chin. Now Steve turned to blush While Tony looked like winning.
“Shit.”
Sometimes she didn’t get his son’s mind to like that music so much. Suddenly the lady heard a knock from the front door, and somebody got inside.
“If it’s about the meet and greets again, my answer is still same,” Tony said as he lied his back on the couch.
“MR. JARVIS,” Peter squeal and hugged Jarvis tightly. “It’s really nice to see you again Mr. Jarvis.”
"What am I thinking?! It's none of my business." He said as he turned away. "He might be dead now."
“Oh yeah!! I can see you enjoying this Jarvis!” Anthony started playing with his phone, uncovering his upset face.
“Actually I am.” Peter looked concern about it, but suddenly his face is replaced with faith, strength, and determination. “But ’m not worried because he is Tony and I know he loves you, Papa. I love Tony and I love you too. I will protect you so don’t worry.”
Tony stared at Jarvis who smiled innocently. “Whatever you said Anthony, I’m not the one who told her about Steve. However, if you are curious about it, she is the one who asked me about you in the first place.” Jarvis confessed.
“Papa.” Steve snapped from his thoughts and looked at his son. They had almost arrived at the bus stop. “Yes, Peter?”
Steve felt the cold air as Peter has a smile stuck in his face. “I was just asking Papa-.” Before Peter could finish his sentence, Steve interrupted them as Peter’s bus arrived and Peter ran towards Steve, said his goodbye and went into the bus. He waved his hands towards them as saying goodbye. The school bus started to move to leave them. Steve watched the bus go away with the blank expression.
"IF WE STAY LIKE THIS, THEY WILL CATCH US ALL!"
“I love you too Steve, So much,” Tony replied, his nose was bumped with Steve’s.
“It’s a love song. But when I translated it, I suddenly remembered you.” Steve confessed, his breath started getting rough because of his face, his nose touched with Tony’s.
"Healthy, I know," Sam interrupted when they entered the rest area. The rest area is like a cafeteria in high school but more in the cafe design. Steve and Sam look for an empty table after they find one near the window. They both sit and put their things (cell phones, tablets, notes). Sam went to order the food and Steve looked out of the window, he could see the whole of New York City from there. He wondered what Peter was doing now and what Tony was doing now. Peter might have been on the R & D floor and Tony did his job. Steve returned to his notes when Sam brought his food. They eat together and talk about things they do or other things they can talk about.
"GO!" He shouted back to the brown-haired man.
“I need to watch Peter, I worried if he wandered too far.”
“I agree with him, sir,” Jarvis added.
Sam is the only friend Steve had that not a celebrity or some rich people. Steve was so grateful that Sam not making a big deal about his friends is a famous people. Sam was not friended with him because of that, but because he really wanted to be Steve’s friend. All of Steve’s friends accepted Sam too.
“Come on Peter, we need to go if you still want to watch spider-man later at home,” Jarvis said as he took Peter’s hand and left Tony who still sat on the chair confusedly. Peter called him what? He called Tony what??
“Steve.” He looked at his mother again, confusion showed in his mother’s face.
“Yeah, me too Steve. I never know that you took this bus stop here to go to work. I know you have a car, but you are always using the bus every time you go to work” Sam greeted back as he started the conversation with Steve.
The Brunette man tried to lift his leg, which was buried too deep while trying to walk on the snow. The snow in that place was so thick that his feet sank into the snow as high as his thighs. As a result, he always moistened every time he tried to walk. Not only was it difficult to walk, but cold temperatures also began to spread throughout his body. He repositioned his backpack and continued his steps.
Bucky just stunned there and his face went blank and stared at the gaping door, where his friend was left. Steve was not the kind of person who admits openly about what he admired. Hence, it was hard to guess what he was actually like and even didn’t give a hint. The similar thing happened when Steve saw the paint from the museum and didn’t say anything but the adoration looked clearly from his face. Bucky finally figured out after they examine two other paintings from a similar creator. One thing Bucky really grateful was that his friend couldn't school his face. So when his friend’s birthday that accident as same on America independence’s day came. Bucky gave him an autograph from Steve's favorite’s artist and he couldn’t stop saying his thanks. So, knew that Steve admitting something close to 'liked Tony Stark' was an unfamiliar thing to Bucky.
“We don’t know what he was dosed with. We have no idea how long he’s going to be unconscious.”
“The police wouldn’t come when Crystal had pictures, why would some government agency come based on a phone call?”
“Anthony can often be found here, that is true, but I have recently been too occupied to work on projects with him. I can give him a message when he returns if you would like.” Steve replied.
“Too busy with art school, and anyway, everything I can cook I got from recipes on the internet. Neither Clint nor I could do more than boil water for Ramen when we started trying to be independent.”
“Phil will be running patrols with me once I introduce him to everyone. The others may join in sometimes, depending on their moods. We will be able to increase the frequency we check the borders as well. More dragons means more eyes and wings doing more work.”
“No… I mean, I’m fine… I mean…” Tony’s stuttering did not help Steve much at all.
“You guys only have one cell phone between the three of you?”
“You’ll get better if we make it here. Ask Steve about it when he’s done with your clothes and checking your toes.”
“Maybe more kidnappers,” Steve snapped with annoyance. “What the hell is S.H.I.E.L.D. anyway?”
“I don’t know Rhodey,” Steve replied seriously “but I bet I’d like him. He sounds sensible.”
“Well, you aren’t in Scranton tonight. Do you need, like, a tooth brush? Tooth paste?”
Natalie paused for a long moment before answering, “Nah, Clint is the only guy I’ve met in ages that I thought might be worth spending time with.”
“I… well…”
“That sounds more like poor materials than poor workmanship to me. If a relationship works then both people are trying hard, putting effort in. From what you’ve told me you were the only one working to keep things working”
“Where do you want us for this?” The blond added.
“That sounds fantastic, really.”
“I don’t remember much. I have nightmares about icy water and being trapped. I don’t swim for fun.”
“We have rather gotten off the subject of our imaginary childhood.” Nat commented.
“The first person I ever dated seemed perfect for me. Everyone we both knew kept talking about how perfect we were for each other. I didn’t have the experience with happiness to recognize how empty our relationship was, I just kept throwing my all into making it work. I’m lucky she broke it off with me, though it really didn’t feel that way at the time. I just felt like a failure, kept wondering what I’d done wrong that it was over, what I could have done differently to make it work. You sound like me after Bernie broke up with me. But neither of us had done anything wrong, we just didn’t fit together.”
“I take that this conversational diversion means you don’t want to go back to sleep?”
“She wants to keep dating,” Clint told his very interested family as wandered back in afterwards. “She said she really likes me, and she was sorry Tony almost got hurt, and to Thank everyone for helping catch Alexi since that means S.H.I.E.L.D. is taking her seriously now.”
“I thought the attic above this room would make a nice studio. It has lots of windows. The attic above the main house has lots of windows too, and its bigger, but bright yellow? I don’t know how I feel about that. I thought about changing it before you saw it, but I’ve never asked how You feel about bright yellow.”
“The authorities never do appreciate someone pointing out that they might be wrong, do they.” The red-head said with a thoughtful blink. “I didn’t know any of that about their history… I just always loved Summertime by Mary Cassat. That was the painting that first got me interested in art.”
“Uh, yeah, I guess. I usually have an assistant to pick stuff up for me, but she’s back in New York.”
“The population recovered and dragons stopped valuing them. Born dragons started disdaining humans and hybrids and insisted on breeding only with other born dragons. The term Purebred came into use and the leader of the ‘purebred’ tried to take the artifact from its bearers by force and use it to exterminate any dragon with human ancestry. The artifact broke in his hands, each piece shooting off in its own direction and he was left scarred and unsatisfied in a world where he had to hunt down mixed heritage dragons and kill them himself. Then the eggs started to not hatch, and the eggs that did hatch produced young that were weak, and sickly. My teacher went looking for the artifact, and started campaigning against purebred ideology. It didn’t go well for him, and he started thinking that the best thing to do would be to establish some new city of dragons founded on the ideals of diversity and freedom…”Steve trailed off. “Anyway I’m pretty sure the piece Phil has is the piece that was traditionally held by a hybrid. He isn’t one, which is why he can’t manage it. It is usually granted to a human during the course of making them a hybrid, which is why normal humans touching it was so bad for them.”
“I don’t want to set one bedroom aside for you. I want to share this bedroom with you. I know you work a lot, and once you get this factory set-up the way you want, you will be traveling a lot. But when you have free time I want to spend as much of it as possible with you, and wake up beside you.”
“It is… I just…” Tony struggled to find a way to explain to Steve how rare it was for anyone in his life to care about making Tony happy if they weren’t being paid to do so.
“You are NOT going out there alone.” Clint and Wanda announced in chorus, then paused to glare at each other.
“Consent is important.”
“I don’t get it either. It has to be because he won’t inherit. If my father and Gregory really are gone the estate either comes to me, or goes to some distant cousin… Morgan maybe? If Morgan is still around. Obadiah wants someone he can control, not some unknown… Probably. I won’t know what sort of a mess it is until I get there, or probably am there for some time. Everyone will just repeat Obadiah’s story at first, most of them because it’s the only story they know.” Tony said.
“I fell down in the snow, and couldn’t get the car or my phone to turn on.”
“I don’t really count Lucky.” Tony replied, shifting awkwardly in Steve’s arms as Steve juggled things around to get the front door open. It didn’t seem to lock.
Steve maneuvered the three humans around, then took a position near Phil where he could coax the glow out of the other dragon. Brilliant threads of light wove around his claws for a moment before lashing out into the room, soaking into flesh that bloomed with feathers for the moment before the light winked out of existence. Dragon fire lit the sconces around the room and a black and white dragon woke shortly after. He and the blue were deep in conversation by the time a red and gold dragon, a purple and white dragon and a red, white and black dragon joined them. Exhausted the five soon separated for slumber, one bedroom a mix of black, white and purple feathers, a second full of blue, white, red and gold. Black, white and red should have been curled up in the third, but restless and paranoid their owner had slipped back out into the main room to keep an eye on the door.
Tony just blinked at him. Then blinked around as the town, bedecked in hearts and flowers, started to come into view. The ugly blanket with its giant pink hearts suddenly made a lot more sense. It fit right in with the town’s aesthetic.
“Uh…” Tony hesitated for a moment. “The carriage horses looked great, though they are probably a bit worse for the wear after meeting a dragon. Two days if he pushes them, three if he lets Happy set their pace.”
“I think it is a super power. The X-men should recruit him to help find an effective method of combating whoever it is they are fighting now.”
“He turns his hearing aid off at night. You could have wrestled an elephant in there without waking him. I’ve only woken him on accident twice, and I’ve been assured my nightmares are rather noisy.”
Tony had to move Lucky in order to get situated, and the dog hopped right back up on the couch as Steve settled in with one arm wrapped around Tony and a bowl of popcorn settled in their laps. Tony jolted so hard he nearly spilled it when the movie came on. “Galaxy Quest? You got me Galaxy Quest for our holiday movie?”
“Looks like some party you’re preparing for.”
“I wasn’t expecting…”Steve paused, glancing around at his new family “… this. I traded with one of the local farms for some delicacies.”
“He listened when I talked… he never dismissed my opinions or talked over me, at least not at first.”
I shook his hand, and tore my heart in sunder,
“Yeah, I think my birth family must have celebrated it… umm... before? Sometimes I find things that my hands seem to know how to do, even though I don’t remember learning. Making Brigid’s crosses is one of those things. Fun. Soothing. That’s how I found you on the road, actually. I decided to hang some of the crosses out at the pavilion where Clint’s students gather. It’s closed for the winter, of course… uh, don’t tell anyone I was sneaking out there in February, Please?”
“Government agency, one of the many who wanted to interview me when I got back from Afghanistan… I’ve been putting them off.” Tony said.
“These are fantastic! I’ve had worse noodles at five star restaurants.”
“Umm, anything but anchovies?” Tony responded uncertainly, feeling massively out of his depth. He wondered when the last time he’d felt any sort of control over his life was. When his car rattled to a stop in the middle of nowhere?  At his last press conference? Before Afghanistan? Before his parent’s death? The domesticity flowing around him reminded him oddly of sharing the kitchen with Jarvis and Anna when he’d been a boy, noisier, but familiar in a way he didn’t really know how to interact with. “I have my wallet with me I think… I’m not exactly sure where my pants wandered off to, but I can pay for the pizzas.”
“Is he in his Workshop?” Tony had finished his basement work shop a bit over a month ago, and was usually to be found there when he wasn’t in their bedroom. He could often be found sleeping there, but Jarvis had a different coded phrase for when Tony needed to be moved to slightly more comfortable sleeping arrangement than his work table.
For the first time ever Steve’s apartment was quiet as Tony opened the door. Steve had given him his own key shortly after the kidnapping incident. The second kidnapping incident. The second kidnapping incident this year? The Ronin incident. Yeah. Let’s think about that one as the Ronin incident.
“The other two people in the carriage were a dark skinned man and a red-headed woman.”
“Smoke?”
“Of course.” Steve replied.
“What do you usually do at night?”
“If we are welcome…”Phil started, then hesitated.

Tony Perched at the top of the look-out, a device of his own making delicately crafted of dragon forged brass and glass held to one eye. The three groups heading towards the cliff maintained their distinctness, even as the winding road through the trees spilled out into the low grassy area at the base of the cliff that Steve so carefully maintained as a grassland. They were definitely coming here, to Steve’s lair. They almost never had guests, but there was literally no other possible destination. The road ended at Steve’s cave entrance. Behind the cave was water, north was a marshy no man’s land, south a shifting trackless sand dune too treacherous to cross on foot. It had a tendency to swallow living things, trap them in its gullet until they rotted away, then open new trenches into those empty spaces. Nature abhors a vacuum as Steve would say.
Danny’s served a thing they called a chocolate piñata. A giant hollow chocolate heart hung neatly from the display that was wheeled over to their table. When they broke it open it proved to be full of a selection of Danny’s chocolates, from chocolate covered strawberries to white chocolate truffles. Even with the way Steve ate, they took a good amount of chocolate with them for later.
“You really put a lot of thought into this.” Tony said.
“Well, once I was fledged, and allowed out onto the flight platforms, I started by stretching and exercising my wings.” Phil said.
“By whose standards?”
“Hey Pepper, pick up, pick up, look I know you don’t recognize this number, I’m using the phone at the repair shop. I’m not in Scranton. Someone sabotaged my car, and my phone… if I had a normal pace-maker I’d be dead. ANYWAY… Jesus, call me back or something. I’m stuck here at the moment, and maybe should stay put until I figure out if this was an attempted kidnapping, or assassination or… whatever… shit. Yeah, I’m fine. Happy to hear your melodious tones. Listen, I need a new phone, can you ship me one of our prototypes?”
“I guess…?”
“I was in a boating accident with my parents years ago. They died, but I was fished out of the water unconscious. I was in a coma for a while and I woke up with a photographic memory. I know they aren’t really supposed to exist, members of the medical community made my life hell until I got emancipated and could tell them to go fuck themselves… so I read the history plaque at the gazebo and can repeat it verbatim whenever it comes up. I thought you might find it more interesting than any of the pages from my GED class.”
“Well, I don’t imagine Steve has either, and you are the only two here with any idea how this is supposed to go, so how were you taught?” Tony replied.
“I suspect so. I guess I won’t know for sure until I can read them. Why don’t you sit down? You really don’t look well. Do you want some aspirin? Something to drink?” Steve glanced at the folder in his boyfriend’s hands, and tried to figure out what from it Tony might have misconstrued to work himself up into this state.
“This is Tony.” Steve tucked his wing firmly around the smaller dragon and nuzzled the side of his face. “He came here to be my mate. That is Nat,” Steve gestured towards the gate with his tail. “Tony’s eldest sibling. Clint is Tony’s other sibling, and Clint’s mate is Phil.” Steve gestured towards the pair by the door. “I have a family now.”
“That’s, uh, prenups are in case of divorce, not accidents.” Tony tried to explain and not cry at the same time.
“He’s as close as you’ve gotten to dating in years.” Clint pointed out at the same time.
Fred Astaire? Tony thought confused, as he floated slowly to consciousness. He blinked absently at his surroundings, feeling more disoriented by the moment. He was dressed in an over large t-shirt and sweat pants, wrapped in an incredibly soft, and equally ugly heart printed blanket, curled up in the front passenger seat of some sort of van. All the vents were pointed at him, blasting a soporific wall of heat into his face, leaving him toasty warm despite the snow being pushed around the wind shield by the windshield wipers in front of him. Turning his head reveled his gorgeous blond driver, and must have made some sort of noise. The man glanced over at Tony out of the bluest eyes Tony had ever seen and smiled softly.
“This is perfect Tony. Thank You.” His bright smile made it obvious that he meant it, and Tony found himself relaxing again, full of a bubbly, anticipatory sort of happiness. That happiness grew warmer and frothier as Steve stripped down for a massage and then insisted on returning the favor for Tony. They slid into the heat of the bath together after Steve lit the candles and Tony left his phone on the counter to play soft jazz for them. They rinsed off in the shower and washed each other’s hair mostly as an excuse to keep touching, then dried off and curled around each other in bed.
"I don't like hospitals." Tony responded firmly, trying desperately to remember how he might have ended up unconscious and in need of rescue... He'd been driving... He remembered that much, he didn't much like being driven any more, not after... No... Think about something different.
“Are you sure you don’t want to go to the hospital? It’s just down the block?”
“No.” Tony repeated.
“Err…He would not stay for me, and who can wonder? He would not stay for me to stand and gaze. I shook his hand, and tore my heart in sunder, And went with half my life about my ways.”
“So you don’t tell him I’m a body guard. You say ‘I was recently married’ then hand me down out of Steve’s shield and introduce me. He’ll assume I’m your new spouse. That’ll also block any attempt on his part to marry you off to some relative of his to manipulate himself into your inheritance.” Nat replied.
“Not yet. Why?”
“Don’t we need all three for that to work?” The red-head asked.
“You keep saying that. But you were unconscious with frozen clothing when I found you.”
“Maybe S.H.I.E.L.D.,” Clint answered at the same time.
“It is usually ten years from hatchling to squire, then another ten from squire to knight. You are all fully fledged, if I were to have first seen you at a gathering I would think you young knights of around the same age as Phil,” said Steve.
“I see the carriage is gone,” he said. “Do we have anything we have to do because of it?”
“No hospital.” Tony repeated firmly.
Steve was still politely greeting the farm cart couple when Happy pulled the carriage to a stop. He had a bit of a time with it, as the high strung beauties pulling the carriage had no desire to stand that close to a dragon. There was a reason the Commandos left their horses in the paddock at the base of Steve’s Rock, and a reason Steve had built said paddock. The big strong farm horse pulling the cart had no reaction to Steve, and as far as Tony was concerned that was the most interesting thing that had happened in the court yard ever. What horse does not fear dragons?
“Yes, position all of us so the thing has a choice,” the red-head mused.
“We’ll be seen going into the hotel.”
“I’ve never been certain how to talk about it.” Steve admitted, clearly unsettled and a bit ashamed.
“I emailed you before I realized there was a phone here. Do you remember when you told me I should be prepared for some giant extravagant gift and I should be careful not to make him think it was unwanted?”
“Yeah.”
“Well thanks,” Clint smiled tiredly. “I think that’s it for me for today. I’m off to bed.”
“Sounds much easier.” Clint commented.
“We can talk about it after you’ve slept some.” Steve said, pushing Lucky out of Tony’s lap and coaxing him into the bedroom. Tony came quietly and the two sat cuddled together in Steve's twin bed until they both drifted off to sleep.
“There are too many options there. If I’m lucky its Rhodey and Pepper.”
“Coffee?”
“We’ll be careful o’ hatchlings next time we come by.” Dum Dum chortled, clearly pleased by something. “S’ this mean you’ll have help on th’ patrols?”
“I’d love to cook dinner for you every night, Tony.”
“Oh. It would have taken an ambulance just as long to get to us as it would take me to get you to the hospital… And Clint has our cell phone today.”
“It is the plainest of medallions because of that.” Steve pointed out. “Even Tony noticed when he was reading through some of the histories.”
“We can watch something else if you like?” Steve offered. He was studying Tony’s face in way that made Tony wish for his sunglasses. It made him feel vulnerable. He kissed Steve deeply, trying to distract both of them from the awkward moment, then leaned over to rest his forehead on Steve’s shoulder.
“So five shields then, I suspect all of us are around twenty,” said Tony.
“There is.”
“I am definitely too drunk to remember it in the morning.”
“Of course! And when I asked they said they wanted to. I thought Butterfingers and U could throw flower petals, and Dum-E can hold up Jarvis’ tablet.” Steve explained.
“I’m the only one they might recognize.” Tony pointed out. “And I’m standing just fine.” He lifted his hands from the table he was braced against as a demonstration, and almost tipped over. He only stayed upright because Steve caught him around the waist.
“One of my parents abandoned our nest as soon as my sibling and I had hatched. He returned to his clan claiming that there was no dishonor in his actions as the hatchlings were not viable- too sickly and weak to survive to adulthood. His clan accepted that without any investigation. When my other parent sought assistance from the two clans in question he was denied. The clans both said they would not aid in the delusions of a parent unwilling to admit his… or is it hers once there is offspring? Offspring were too defective to be allowed to live. That parent refused to abandon us to return to his? Her? Parent clan and instead devoted themself to hunting and tending us alone. I hate to admit that things got better after my sibling died, but I doubt any single dragon could bring home enough food to bring two growing hatchlings to fledge. My parent decided early on that we would not return to either of the clans that abandoned us, and we had settled on Star clan before my sibling died. When my parent died the winter before I fledged I remembered those discussion, and the route my parent described to us so often. I launched myself from the nest hoping that my wings would be strong enough to carry me there, and at least didn’t get myself killed on the way there. I’m really not sure why the clan elder accepted and named me. I was tiny, starving and more than half dead when I crashed into the lair doors having no idea of how to sound the bell. If he’d left me out there for the night I would have been dead by morning. Instead he named me on the spot and sent a team out to give my parent a proper burial with a star clan shield when I admitted I hadn’t managed to do anything like that.”
“I don’t want you searching for Obadiah’s secrets without someone to guard your back.” Steve said.
