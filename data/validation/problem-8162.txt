“I know, right? The one time I couldn’t use protection,” Tony blurted, trying to fill the awkwardness that had descended in the room.
“Can I have a hug?” Steve asked, “I’m kind of cold.”
The next moment he could remember was a horrified gasp and Bruce’s eerily calm voice, then he was dragged off the horse into someone’s arms. Surely Bruce could not carry his weight, but he did not open his eyes to check since the light had become too much to bear. Loud voices threatened to explode his head and he groaned pitifully, wanting all the noise and pain to just
“We should probably get up soon anyway. You hungry, fella?” Steve murmured, putting a hand on PJ’s back.
“Shh, love, go ahead, you can eat without us,” He soothed, moving Peter up so he could latch on, “Poor thing, you must be—ah—so hungry.”
A small noise from the other room drew his attention away from his reflection. He quickly cleaned up the bathroom then rushed back to Peter’s side, hushing the baby as he lifted him back up to cradle in his arms.
Tony could only nod, as he was afraid to speak or he might burst into tears. Instead, he turned to kiss at Peter’s cheeks and rock the baby back and forth, holding him as tight as he could.
Tony shook his head and stripped out of his hoodie, pointedly walking forward to avoid the mess on the floor. He headed over to the emergency laundry chute and threw the hoodie and his shirt down it, turning around with a sigh. Steve was gone, presumably to take PJ upstairs to get checked out. Taking a few minutes, Tony quickly cleaned up the mess, noting that it was oddly orange in color. He thoroughly washed his hands and headed up to his floor, wishing he could take a shower first.
“M’Clint,” he introduced himself, pushing the box toward Tony, “Dat’s Tasha. I’m buildin’ a tower for her dollies.”
They all complained, but Tony glared, jaw setting in place. Even Bucky put his hands up to placate him, quickly getting up to head off to the jet. Thankfully, it didn’t take long before they were alone, with Steve staring at the thermos in his hands and Tony looking at him nervously. He crept over to sit next to Steve, hesitating before wrapping an arm around him.
“I did not realize that teasing me was resting,” Steve groaned as he rocked their hips together.
“Yeah—Look, I’m just trying to—Steve, you really don’t have to. You’re not obligated at
“Good news first,” Steve decided.
“Papa will be here soon, I promise. Just a little longer. First, we are going to go see your Aunt Pepper, who I am sure will spoil you to no end with all kinds of sweets and toys,” he promised.
“Becoming feral is a biological response to a bondmate being threatened…. or, at least, perceiving a threat,” she continued, “He needs to feel that his bondmate is safe. The problem is, he already
“Didn’t want to see your face when you realized how fucked up I was,” Tony murmured back, not looking up from his work.
Tony watched with an open mouth as PJ settled in Steve’s arms, letting the blond take him into the bathroom without a fuss.
“You are right. It is not fair of me,” he mumbled, “I am sure my mother, the gods rest her soul, would hit me upside the head for having double standards, especially for my mate.”
“He goes by Rhodey. He is one of my closest friends in the whole world. He helped me escape,” Tony explained, elbowing Rhodey when he started to make comments under his breath, “The problem is, he is
weapons. I—I have to stop it, Rhodes,” he said softly.
Tony nodded and relaxed back into his chair, concentrating on making sure Peter drank at least half of the wineskin before handing it back over to Steve. He shushed the babe and hefted him up onto his shoulder, carefully patting his back to prevent bubbles from sticking in his stomach. Steve looked at him quizzically, but he did not say anything; instead, he stood and left with the wineskin, only to return with a plate brimming with food. He set it in front of Tony, who could not help but stare at the feast. Sure, he might have been used to larger portions, but this was an
“You alright?” he eventually asked, propping his elbow on his thigh and his hand on his cheek, “You seem a little less like you want to toss him off of you and scrub your skin raw.”
“So, what’re we being sad about?” Tony’s voice drifted over, “I mean, I usually don’t need an excuse to eat ice cream, but this is my second helping today and Bruce’ll kill me if I go through all my lactose pills before new ones come in again.”
“Then change the tradition. Your body is
shoulder, allowing himself to fall asleep while breathing in Steve’s cologne.
PJ gave Bruce a side eye, only to snuggle more into Tony’s side and clutch at his shirt. Tony couldn’t help but laugh, immediately wincing at the pain that shot up his side. With a sympathetic look, Bruce patted Tony’s arm and stood, making his way out of the room.
“So. After that, we talked about it, and we thought we wanted kids,” Tony continued, gauging Steve’s reaction, “Y’know, she’d be the hardworking mom, I’d step down and just do R&D and by then I was
“Do not fret. Peter needs to be changed,” Bruce explained, noticing his discomfort, “Is it okay if I show the Prime how to?”
“Me?” Rhodey raised an eyebrow, “My father was the Captain of the Guard for Howard for many years before his death in the field. Tony and I grew up together because of that.”
Scott and Clint hurriedly moved to shush him, but it was too late. The noise startled PJ, causing him to snap his eyes wide open. One brown and one blue eye quickly surveyed the scene, pure terror showing on his small face. Shaking like a leaf, he turned his face up toward Tony, tears already starting to fall down his cheeks.
“I’m guessing you’re Steve?” He said, “You need to leave without speaking any more than you already have, or I will remove you myself.”
“He likes you, he just likes Natasha better,” Tony teased back, wrapping his arms around PJ, “Still. I think we should tell the team this. Then, if the others need to watch him because one of us is unavailable, they should have two people keeping watch.”
He leaned back to be able to meet Steve’s eyes and raised an eyebrow at the Prime’s embarrassed expression.
He let it go for the moment and proceeded with washing Steve, careful of his still-battered body. Of course, his hands were batted at when he tried to go below Steve’s waist, at which he slapped the soap into the man’s hand and clumsily got up out of the bath.
“Once again, not surprised that you’re the favorite,” Tony snorted, leading the three to the powder room just down the hall, “Okay, kiddo. Here’s the bathroom.”
. You know you can always talk to me, man. I might not be the best at advice, but I’m down for blowing shit up with you to help you feel better, and you know Mom would let you stay over if you needed it.”
at PJ wrong, “He has the serum.”
“Ready for what?” He asked lightly, plopping down on his seat in the jet and taking off his helmet to shake the sand from his hair, “Going home?”
Steve had to lunge forward to keep Tony down on the bed, pressing lightly on his shoulders. Tony merely waggled his eyebrows and winked up at him, grinning when Steve flushed.
“Idiot,” he cursed in the Southern language, madder at himself for not realizing sooner that Steve was a bit beyond not okay.
“It is beautiful,” Steve agreed as he stripped, unbeknownst to Tony, “Care to swim?”
“What?”
“I will die if you make me wait much longer,” he gasped between kisses, “I can feel how hard you are, I want you inside me, Steve,
After a minute or two of painfully watching the boy cry quietly, PJ eventually settled into sniffles again, rubbing his red eyes with his tiny fists. He gulped down air before scooting a little closer to Tony to settle his tiny palm against Tony’s once more.
“But you
DNA together and it will work, but not male!” Tony sputtered, waving his hand at the boy, “And look! He—”
“If you come now, we will have to start all over again later when you recuperate,” he said in faux-sympathy, enjoying Tony’s whines as he pulled his fingers out, “Easy there, Omega. Time for the bed, no?”
. I’m not talking about it.”
“I hate you,” he grumbled, pouting at Rhodey’s laughter.
“Yeah, you really do,” he answered softly, “Tony—you gave me a home. Literally. You invited me in and asked after me and did everything you could to try and help me adjust.”
“What?” he prompted again.
“Really? How could you tell?” Rhodey drawled, putting his arm back around Tony and tugging him back in, “And since when have I been afraid of another Alpha vying for your attention?”
“The more you hold him, the easier it will be,” he said, “Really, I did not endure a fortnight of having him wail if he did not have something close that scented of you for you to tell me that he does not like you.”
“Okay, okay, it’s okay, Steve. See? His vitals are good, everything is okay,” Bucky said quickly, putting his hands on Steve’s chest and shoulder, “Just a minute, then we—”
Slowly, he lowered them both into the water, unable to help a small moan as the warm water engulfed his sore muscles. Peter seemed to agree and stretched out his arms, curling up to Tony’s chest and lightly grasping at his chest hair. Unbothered, Tony carefully cupped up water and started to wash the baby, pleased that he was not making a fuss. After a moment, the Prime cleared his throat and startled him, making Tony swear and sigh, fluttering his eyes over to the man.
?” Tony whispered, eyeing the Warlords as they dismounted and led their horses to be taken by stableboys, “Is that it? No great toasts? No glory in victory?”
He turned to look at Tony, and seeing the engineer’s distraught, confused, and somehow amused expression, Steve felt a weight lift off of his shoulders.
“He does have a way with words.”
“Believe me, I know,” she replied, raising an eyebrow, “Come on, then. Let’s get the team caught up.”
“Are you really upset that you were mischaracterized in a fictional porno I wrote when I was a teenager?” he asked.
“Hey! Hey now, shh,” Tony tried to soothe, gently deflecting the little hands, “It is all done, no more bath. I promise. We are getting dry now, okay? Then we will put you in some nice new clothes and I will let you wake Papa up.”
“How are you so good with him? I have never seen you around children,” Natasha said.
“That’s it, little one. Drink as much as you like, they can wait for you to finish,” Tony mumbled, turning more to try and hide the feeding between Steve’s and his bodies.
“…You feel the same way?” Tony finally said.
Just as he got Peter settled, the hairs on the back of his neck rose and a shudder swept down his spine. He turned around and gulped, seeing the man who had stood next to Steve in the throne room. Seeing him up close, Tony paled, realizing that he still had Tony’s family crest clutched in his hand. The man spoke in a deep, raspy voice, motioning toward them with the crest. Steve laughed and answered him, idly patting Tony’s back.
“And that didn’t happen.”
Tony sighed, nibbling his bottom lip as he started again.
It was quiet again after that, and with Tony’s hand still on his thigh, Steve’s mind was racing to decipher the pieces of the conversation like he was cracking a cryptogram.
Bucky bit his lip and nodded, patting Tony’s hand.
“Rogers,” Tony acknowledged, moving into the room before closing the door with a soft
Looking back, the pain of Jarvis wrapping his broken rib still felt better than the dagger Steve had thrust into his back. He began to seek out the pain, no longer caring about keeping a low profile around Howard and staying out of his way. It was easy to jimmy the liquor cabinet open, and by the time he had drunk through a bottle of Howard’s favorite bourbon, his skin was too hot and clammy to really feel the fists and feet beating against it.
Standing on creaky knees, Tony grunted a few choice words about his age before looking down at PJ, who merely continued to stare at the two on the couch, occasionally flicking his gaze up to Tony. Surprisingly patient, Tony held his palm out, waiting for PJ to hoist himself up onto his feet to carefully lay his palm on Tony’s hand. Once he was steady on his feet, he took his palm away, slowly inching toward the couch. Natasha and Bruce sat still, pretending to stay in conversation as to not accidentally scare the boy; close enough to touch the arm of the couch, PJ looked at the two of them, curiosity overtaking his natural flinch when they looked his way.
Thankfully, the play went off without a hitch, save for the costume blunder when Thor exchanged out Natasha’s halo for horns. Steve even came right up to Tony’s side for the curtain call and bow, holding tight to his hand as the auditorium’s applause rang around them.
“Sure, babe. Just hold him tight. And buckle,” Tony snorted, moving the seat back and shutting the door before going around to the driver’s side.
“Why not?”
Especially during their joint therapy sessions.
Tony rolled his eyes and stepped away from the table, letting Thor take and answer questions from the others. As the ruckus began to pick up in the room, Peter whined and fussed, unlatching in his fit. Tony quickly shouldered the baby and kissed his cheek, slipping out to the hallway where there was less noise. He bounced the baby in circles and attempted to keep him calm, rubbing and patting his back in case air bubbles were causing him discomfort.
“Great,” Tony groused, staring at the tiled ceiling.
Steve stared back at Tony, narrowing his eyes at the other’s shrug.
“How about that walk then? There might be people in the gardens, but the fresh air would do you well.”
“I really do not know if you will be able to take me, let alone my knot,” he finally admitted, “I want to do as much as I can to open you up so we can try, okay?”
“If you say genitalia again, I’m going to jump out of the window,” Sam grunted, at which Bucky nodded.
“Gods,” he managed, licking his lips to help the dryness in his mouth.
He pulled back and wiped at his face, coughing and sniffling as he tried to compose himself.
He looked up at Steve for reassurance, smiling softly at the devotion in his eyes. He leaned up for a kiss and then settled down into the warm bed, quickly succumbing to sleep for the second time that night.
“Tony, what matters right now is getting you cleaned up and back into bed,” Steve said patiently, stripping down as part of his plan to get Tony into the shower, “Alright? I just want you to be comfortable as much as possible, sweetheart. You just went through a traumatic experience. There is
“Stay still,” Tony ordered, knowing the words were useless.
He did not look up to see her go; only the sound of the door opening and closing let him know that he was alone with Peter once more.
The confession startled them both, but Steve quickly recovered and nodded, kissing Tony’s forehead as he took his hand to lead him outside. They found a secluded park bench and sat, Tony immediately choosing to sit in Steve’s lap.
on me? So this whole time, all the not sitting with me anymore, the avoided conversations, the stilted voice—it was all because you have a crush and didn’t, what, want to make me uncomfortable? Is that it?”
He felt the tears on his cheeks as he explained, years of pent-up pining breaking him wide open. His crying was loud enough to drown out the others’ hushed voices but couldn’t cover up the loud footsteps that ran down the hall, followed by the tell-tale running of someone in heels. Tony felt arms wrap around him and he leaned into the body, breathing in Rhodey’ comforting cologne as he cried into his chest.
“I know, sweet thing. We have to,” Tony sighed, “Believe me, I do not like it any more than you do, but clean means
“Tony,” Steve said warningly, but Bucky waved him off.
Steve turned and pointed at the boy playing with the dinosaurs in the dollhouse, beaming when Bucky looked up and waved enthusiastically at him. Once he saw the smile light up Steve’s face, Tony decided he would do everything in his power to keep that smile only for himself.
“Sorry. You’re the smart one, so you answer the questions first,” was all he said before joining Bruce and Clint to nearly sprint out of the room.
Tony felt heat rise in his cheeks and he made an affirmative noise, craning his neck down so he could kiss Peter’s head.
“I take my pills, Brucey bear. Don’t you worry.”
Tony looked at PJ, and at the boy’s nod, helped him up onto his back to fiercely hold onto him. Despite both vehicles still going way over 80 miles an hour, Tony reached out his hand toward Steve’s gloved one, shaky as he felt blood trickle down his spine from the gash in his neck. He’d barely scraped his fingertips along Steve’s fingers when shots rang out, forcing Tony back into the car and Steve to slam on the brakes. The last thing he saw was Clint yelling as HYDRA agents swarmed the duo before Tony fell back into darkness.
“It’s called a lullaby. We do this for my friend Bruce over there when he’s this big green man,” Tony explained, keeping his palm raised as he watched the wary boy, “It helps him get grounded so he can
Tony blushed and hid his face back in Steve’s neck, only pulling away when he was set down in a chair. He whined, leaning up for a kiss before Steve scurried off to the kitchen to get their supper. He kept his eyes glued to Steve’s ass, only to yelp when he was startled by someone sitting down heavily on his right.
Pausing in his thought, Tony sat up with a grunt, adjusting his pillows so he could at least stay sitting up. He felt like whining loudly to get Steve to bring him some sort of painkiller, but he’d rather slice off his own toes before admitting to the Captain that he was needy.
“Mmm, felt like 80,” Tony murmured, taking a look around the room as he tried to not think about Steve’s hands on him, “Is—is this a cabin? Seriously, I don’t remember ever buying a cabin.”
It was silent for a moment as Tony took it in, eyes slowly widening at the information.
“I take that as a compliment.”
“Tony, you’re still injured,” Steve said, sitting up with a grunt, “We should
Tony did as he was told, pulling over a lab stool and moving the finished phlebotomy equipment. Carefully, he picked up PJ’s small hand, lightly holding it in his own. Somewhere along the way, he got lost in his own thoughts, looking down at the child with an expression caught between worry and adoration. Shaking himself out of the haze, Tony picked up Bruce’s clipboard, looking down at the measurements.
Steve took a breath and handed Vis the knife, then motioned to his back.
“You take him, then make sure he eats,” Tony said, moving his arm so PJ could climb off the bed, “You be good for Ste—for Papa, okay?”
Carefully smoothing the photo back into the album, Tony flipped to the next page, finding another picture of him and Steve, holding their mouths open to show the camera where they had simultaneously lost the same tooth. Each picture after that was the same; except for the one picture of him holding up his acceptance letter to MIT with a smirk, they were all of him and Steve, him with a drawing Steve made him, him waiting at the bus stop for Steve even though they had a chauffeur…
“You believe in a god, Mister Stark? How…naïve,” Arnim Zola crooned from the other side of the door, the pixels of his smile stuttering as the picture shifted, “The subject is alive, as long as you…behave. It seems to fair better knowing that you are alive, so for now, your life is as good as its cooperation.”
The picture jumped around the room until it landed at the monitor on the focal desk, displaying Zola’s face in annoyingly HD quality.
“Oh, are we good now? Okay,” He chuckled, “I’m gonna put my hand on your back, okay? Just so you don’t roll or anything.”
“No.”
I had feelings and didn’t reciprocate them.”
“No, you don’t—you don’t understand,” Tony wailed, “He’s worth
that already.”
“Why?” He finally asked, “Why are you doing this?”
“I—uh—no, I just, y’know, the kid likes him,” Tony stammered, ignoring Clint’s shit-eating grin, “Fine. Take Steve. I can hold down the fort with Bruce and Wanda.”
The longer he stayed to shape and sharpen the new sword, the more drained and woozy Tony felt. He knew it was due to the lack of food and sleep he had had recently, yet a small voice in the back of his head pushed him to think about the blade in his hands. Truthfully, he hated making weaponry. Though he was a smith by trade, he wanted his ironwork to go into building machines. It was Howard that had guided his talents toward weapons, and because of that, he was damn good at making them. If he thought about it for too long, it made him ill. Technically, none of the Warlords were
Steve winced as he shuffled into the bathroom and attempted to strip off his shield and dirty garments. He groaned quietly and leaned against the sink, looking more pitiful by the second.
“I think I’d say the same about Tony,” he joked before becoming serious, gently nudging Bucky’s ankle, “Hey. You and Sam are like that too, y’know. Maybe not as ridiculously sappy, but the affection is genuine. Given that you’re both military, it’s obvious in how relaxed you both are once you’re around each other. If you ask Sam to be a goopy romantic, he’ll probably do it better than Steve until they’re both fighting over who’s a sappier partner.”
Tony was sure Steve was going to launch himself into the fire, and by the look on Clint’s face, he wasn’t far behind.
get drunk off of your scent, Tones. He acts like he has spent the day doing nothing but drinking wine after being in your presence for only a few minutes.”
“Good. He’s doing well. Breathe, Tony,” he said softly, closing the eyelids.
“Shit,” he mumbled under his breath, looking sadly down at PJ, who was decidedly awake and seemed confused himself, “Don’t repeat that. They’ll kill me if you start saying bad words.”
Rhodey pursed his lips and regarded him with a singular raised eyebrow. He opened his mouth to speak, then wisely closed it. Without saying anything more, he stood and left them to join the others’ huddle across the room.
The whole room, including Tony, turned to look at Natasha.
And like that, he went back to talking about the circus to no one in particular.
He maneuvered himself to curl over the boy’s body, shielding him from the blast that rocked the car and blew open the truck doors. Noticing that they didn’t slow down, he turned to look over his shoulder, and there he was: sweet Steve,
has the serum—the white blood cells are acting and moving the same way Steve’s does. However, there are white blood cells that seem to be normal, like yours and my own. It’s almost as if a watered-down version of the serum was transferred.”
that he and Peter remained unbonded while out in the forest on their own.
Steve waved him off again. Thankful, Tony stood, bowed his head, and quietly exited the bathroom, making sure to close the door quietly behind him. He tiptoed over to Peter’s bassinet and peeked in, letting out a relieved sigh once he saw that the baby was still asleep.
“Hey, hey—
“Uh. We talked a bit. I’m going to take him to see Aunt Peg,” he said sheepishly, shrugging at Bruce’s stare, “What? It’s the least I could do. He’s been having trouble lately. I think it could be good for him. Some closure.”
“I was so scared you would hate it and me,” he admitted, “I thought you would think it was weird--”
touch me like that,” Tony snapped, swatting at Steve’s hand and moving Peter up to his shoulder in a protective maneuver, “I still have my autonomy,
,” Tony hissed, “Now is
“If you wish, Rhodey could help you keep watch. I am sure you could wheedle many stories of our friendship from him,” he continued, “Perhaps you could convince him that the Warlords are not as bad as Howard made them out to seem. If he spent time with you and Thor, I know he would come around.”
“Ooooh,
,” PJ answered earnestly, his voice a tiny whine.
“Oh my god,” Steve mumbled, covering up his face with his free hand in embarrassment, “Of course he’s known, he’s Tony, he’s so smart and perceptive about
“Bogey! One o’clock!” Steve yelled into the radio, watching something large shoot up out of the smoke and sail toward them.
“Howard, really, you are nine sheets to the wind, and he has his friends over for once. You need to go lie down—”
Tony shifted again, this time slamming his fist down on top of the stick shift. The car roared louder as reactor-powered engines sped them over 200 miles an hour toward a hill. Tony weaved to dodge the rain of bullets coming down, accelerating as much as he could as they flew up the hill. Once they got air, the tires retracted and flattened, whirring to life as they doubled as large rotary turbines, allowing for takeoff.
He bid the group farewell and left the others standing in silence, staring at Steve still struggling in his binds. Bucky shook his head and followed Thor, then was quickly joined by Clint and Sam.
“Never got past firstbase,” Steve repeated firmly, looking down at the ground, “She—uh, she wanted to, but—all I could think of is that you really loved to share your blueberries with the robins that used to nest in that tree. Not exactly mood-worthy.”
“Sit with me,” Tony murmured, tugging on his hand, “Keep me warm.”
“What could SHIELD want with us?” Pepper asked, standing from her seat.
thought any of the Warlords would hurt him, especially with Rhodey around. It was the principle of the thing, that he and Steve would go back to square one, awkwardly dancing around each other.
“Not to mention the sex,” Steve muttered under his breath.
“That’s it, darling. You’re okay. We’ve got you,” he murmured, stroking the back of his hand down the babe’s cheek, “We’re right here. You’re safe and warm, we got you.”
“M’close, fucking--get
Steve’s shoulders slumped and he let out a quiet sigh, tipping his head forward to allow Tony to wash his hair.
He nodded to the discarded notebook.
“He respects me,” Tony repeated flatly.
“Don’t hate me ‘cause I’m right!” he called over his shoulder, digging through a cabinet for a protein bar.
“You are beyond wonderful,” he said, to which Tony started to panic, only to be held in place by Steve’s hands, “Hey, don’t. I mean it. You
It hurt to let Peter feed on his sore nipples, but he did not have much of a choice; they went to bed early the night before, so the poor thing must have been starving. At least, given the force of the suction on his breast, that is what he assumed.
“I…am not shacking up with Steve,” Tony said slowly, peeking out around Steve’s oddly still body, “Why do you think I’m shacking up with Steve?”
. It was like every nerve in his body lit up at once; Tony inhaled sharply and his eyes went wide. He sat very still as Steve proceeded to sniff him over, growling anytime he so much as twitched. Usually, it was a bit attractive to have his Alpha be so possessive over him, but given the sea of blank faces staring at them, Tony could only feel cold fear.
PJ sniffled from where he was tucked into bed, looking paler than usual against the blue sheets.
He lead the group down the hall and into the sitting room, relaxing once he saw Mother in her favorite chair, knitting needles working in her hands. A fire was stoked in the fireplace, giving the room a cozy aura that further unknotted the tension he was carrying on his shoulders.
“All of them?” Tony said, hesitating for a second before smirking, “Really?”
“Basically, yes,” Natasha answered, pushing Tony forward to join Bruce while she sat on the couch, “And that one is the only survivor.”
They did not have to wait long for Steve to return, still sulking in his trousers and silky shirt. Tony whistled long and low at the sight, hopping up from the throne to meet his bondmate halfway.
to…then we can all lay together in the big bed for rest.”
Natasha squinted at him, then nodded, finishing her cheese and moving onto a sleeve of crackers. That’s what he loved about her; she never got angry at Howard or him, just passively took in the information and helped where he let her. Sure, he knew she got frustrated with him, but he also knew that she was just glad to be helping where Tony wouldn’t even let
Rhodey gave him a look, but hugged him back anyway; Tony tried to melt into the warm hug, but knowing that Steve was out there and that he hadn’t even been able to see the look on his face…
Looking back at his friend, Bruce nodded at him, giving Tony a small sliver of relief. With an inward sigh, he followed Natasha to the next room over, setting PJ down on a small chaise lounge. He carefully unwrapped the boy from the blanket, tossing it into a nearby trashcan before taking the shirt from Natasha.
“Okay. I like mochi,” he said, pushing his glasses up his nose, “Red bean or green tea.”
“That doesn’t make it a bad thing, necessarily,” Tony continued, reaching back over to rest a hand on Steve’s knee, “Sometimes, maybe. But it means you give a damn. I’d rather someone have a stance than have no stance at all. Anyway, what I’m getting at is that you’ve really—you’ve always been a hero. Even when you barely scraped by at ninety pounds soaking wet. And for someone who kind of—who had to become something even bigger than myself to be that—you’re intimidating. Not that I’d admit that to anyone else.”
“Well, yeah. He’s at the pre-boarding school age. I was quiet and fairly reserved then. Steve was a monster until the army,” he said, sitting down carefully as to not spill the rest of his cocoa, “He always got into fights and ran around like a madman despite being a shrimp with enough disabilities to be the poster child for ADA pamphlets.”
“I’m trying to not get us killed, now be quiet,” Tony answered.
“Yeah, bug. I know. Life is unfair sometimes.”
“I’ll take it back for a few months so it smells like me again, and by that time, it’ll be completely vomit-free, and you’ll be fine,” he said, smiling at Tony’s sheepish grin, “Don’t worry, buddy. I’ll get it back into tip-top Rhodey shape.”
He sat up and stretched, turning to check on Steve. The Alpha was still asleep, so he scooped Peter up and tip-toed into the bathroom with the hope that they would be quiet enough to let the man sleep in a little. First, he had to strip them both--he was still covered in soot and their cuddling had gotten it on Peter. Tony hated to have the boy change out of his clothes, as he had taken on his father’s tendency to prefer nudity and fussed every time he had to be redressed. For now, though, Peter was happy to be rid of his clothes and hop into a warm bath.
“And you?”
“It was well. I think we had a good time,” Bruce said, accepting a hug from the giant, “I am sad to see you all so dreary and hurt--I want to look all of you over and get a full report of what happened out there.”
The door creaked open and a familiar mop of brown hair appeared, instantly relaxing both Tony and Steve.
“Oh, no, honey, you drink that,” Tony laughed softly, unable to help his fond smile, “They’ll bring me stuff later. You need to eat, too. I’m hoping Papa didn’t bring you just juice.”
Rhodey snorted and made grabby hands at him. “Okay, Mama. Hand him over. I want my daily allotment.”
Tony huffed at that, frustration evident on his face. With a sigh, he stepped out of his armor, setting it to sentry mode before circling the tube.
“I know.”
“Now, I have to ask,” Bruce said one day over a cup of herbal tea, “How do you feel about the Prime? In one moment, you fear him, and then the next you look like you were debauched by him. Which is it?”
“Ah…. Eating for two?” He finally said in a quiet tone.
No one argued with that.
Tony gestured with the ladle before filling the thermos up and capping it, passing it to Steve with a knowing smile. Then, he filled his own mug, blowing on the top of it to try and cool it down.
Tony looked up at that, mouth set into a firm line in annoyance.
“Daddy?” PJ whimpered, wiggling a little in his arms.
of all places. Of course, he was thrown by the information, but we talked it out and agreed that it was better to let you tell him on your own terms,” Rhodey explained, having finally settled from his laughter, “Man, that was
Tony flushed at that; sure, he liked to buy his friends nice things, but he hated to flaunt his money, especially in front of Steve. He glanced over at him, smiling in relief when Steve grinned at him.
Tony laughed and Steve immediately pulled away, but he linked their hands together, keeping some contact between them.
Thankfully, the nurse had placed one of the room’s trashcans by the bed, close enough for Tony to lean over and retch into. He spit out the foul taste in his mouth with a groan, plucking off the sensors on his chest and the IV in his arm before heaving himself up out of the hospital bed to shuffle to the sink to wash out his mouth. Looking up into the mirror, he glazed over the bags under his eyes and the scratches on his face, reaching up to gently touch the butterfly bandages on one of the deeper wounds.
“Can I ask you something?” Tony interrupted, changing the subject.
“Rhodey has the War Machine suit and Clint has ridden bi—on the suit’s back for long periods of time!” Tony complained, “Plus, they’ll get a lift back home from SHIELD once they take care of the base. C’mon, Steve, we had to g—”
It seemed like the hours slogged on as Tony tried to sleep, but it was elusive, and he woke up every few minutes plagued with nightmares of the smell of piss and burnt flesh. Of course, he was used to keeping his body still whenever he woke up abnormally, but the rigidity didn’t go unnoticed by his new cuddle bug.
Tony highly doubted that, but he nodded anyway, leaning up to kiss her on the cheek before leading the group through the house and to the kitchen. Unsurprisingly, Jarvis was already there, slicing the cake up into children-appropriate portions.
Tony nodded, uncapping his sports drink and swigging down half of it. He realized he’d already eaten through his lunch, so he scooted to sit in front of the tall mirror, watching as Natasha rifled through her makeup kit and got to work. She made him take off his shirt, so he looked away and tugged it off, not wanting to see her emotionless face staring at the gross mottling on his body. Instead, he felt her fingertips press against his belly, where he knew scrapes were still crusty with dried blood.
“We are not telling Steve,” Tony snapped, “Not until—Not until we’re sure. Got it?”
“Hey! Dum-E and J count,” Tony argued, watching Bruce pick up a seamstress’ measuring tape as he began to take down PJ’s measurements, “And, besides—I
“Does it run in the family?”
He could not help his soft whimper when Steve pulled away to listen to Bruce, hand lingering in the air for a moment. Later, he would wonder how he had become so attached to the man already, but for now, he was just thankful he had some sort of help. He wanted to watch Bruce to make sure he was careful, but Thor stepped into his line of vision and bent down to smile at him.
about exploring. No thanks.”
“What’s his name?”
The room was silent as they all looked at the child perched on Natasha’s hip. PJ yawned and stretched before tucking himself back into her neck, a peaceful look on his little face.
If only it lasted.
“Bucky and Tasha wanna play house t’day, so you should join us,” he said around a mouthful of pretzels, “We can make our own house if y’want. Bucky’s usually the Mom, but he’s been complaining about takin’ care of the kids by himselfs.”
“Change the subject,” Bruce interrupted from his desk, “Talk about something that will not raise the tension in the room. I do not want Peter to be set off and stress out the Prime. The last thing we need is to have to drag him back down to the dungeons.”
Tony stopped him with a wave of his hand and untied his sash while he turned around, removing his shirt one-handed and letting both articles drop to the ground. Startled gasps ricocheted around the room, sinking into the stones like rainwater. Ugly scars interwove all up his back, an unforgiving patchwork of uncommitted sins punished in the heat of a drunken stupor. He had often joked that he was a blind man’s map, but when surrounded by the stench of disgusted Alphas, all Tony could do was hold Peter as close as he could. Spotting the bundle, one of the Alphas began to yell and all the lesser Alphas unsheathed their swords, but Thor was quick to intervene, barking back at them and shielding Tony with his body.
“None of that, now. If I was in your position, I would have made the same choice, especially if it meant keeping you away from your bastard of a father. Er,
Well, less guilty than just outright breaking a promise to Tony.
“You said you would tell me if he did this again,” Steve whispered softly, sounding broken, “Tony, I thought—I could have
“We have a call. Director says to saddle up,” he said, holding the tent flap open for Steve.
“You know that I dislike it when you do that.”
“King T’Challa is with Sergeant Barnes and Mr. Barton in the communal lounge.”
“I love you,” Steve murmured, bumping their noses together affectionately, “A lot.”
All eyes turned to Tony, but before he could say anything, Steve answered for him.
“Nah, man. Steve’s favorite is strawberry,” Bucky snorted, “He couldn’t have it until after the serum because of his allergies.”
He froze when he felt the Captain’s lips on his neck and shoulder, suddenly very aware that they were both nearly undressed and alone by the ebbing fire. Deciding to go for it, he reached forward to press a hand to Steve’s groin, sucking in a breath when he felt his hardness, even through his suit.
“Get over
, I never thought--”
As Steve put his boots back on, PJ sat up, clearly annoyed at being awake. Still, he crawled over to Tony, who picked the child up and set him on his hip.
“Leave him alone, he is just fond of his son,” Rhodey said to settle the room, “Go back to your conversations.”
“We need to wash up, then we can go collect Peter for dinner,” he said, propelled onward solely by his need to have his baby back in his arms, “Would you like that? We can all eat together in bed if you wish. Then you do not have to sit on the hard chairs with your sore ass all evening.”
“Which one?” Clint asked.
, Steve,” Tony wheezed, nearly writhing on Steve’s lap as he attempted to fuck himself on Steve’s fingers, “More, I can do more, I know you can feel how slick I am, I can take it--”
“Tell him eventually, I know,” Tony finished, slumping down on a chair nearby, “I will. But let’s get the kid into some sort of healthy place, first. Yeah? Please, Brucie bear?”
“I’ll have to practice then, just for you,” Tony said, licking his lips as he realized that his mouth was very, very dry, “Any requests?”
“I will be right outside. Try to rest,” she said, “Perhaps feed the little one again. Distract yourself and let us take care of this.”
The growl that erupted from Steve’s throat sent tingles down Tony’s spine. He shifted on the bed to bring his legs together, forcing himself to remain calm.
He snuggled down into the bed and sighed softly, feeling warm and fuzzy as Steve tucked in the furs around him. After a moment, his lids went dark, signaling that Steve had blown out the last candle. Just as he was about to fall asleep, his face tingled, and he realized that Steve was in front him and that the tingling was from his gentle breaths. He dared not open his eyes and scare the other man, hoping that the Alpha was only checking on him. A few silent moments ticked by, then Steve spoke in low tones with words completely foreign to his ears, yet with a tone that suggested he was saying something that he would be too afraid to tell Tony in the light. He tucked away the words for later, hoping that he could speak them well enough for Thor to translate.
“Fury,” Steve said coldly, stepping in front of Tony protectively, “What the
“Steve? You okay?” He asked slowly, catching movement out of the corner of his eye, “Hey, should I get a nurse? Are you—”
He took his hand and squeezed it, stopping Tony so he could lean in to kiss him. Tony eagerly moaned into it, letting go of Steve’s hand so he could run his hand up under Steve’s shirt to cup his pec. He grinned and thumbed his nipple, noting the hitch in Steve’s breath.
“Friend, do not be afraid. The Prime—he will take good care of you,” Thor said, moving into his blurry vision and smiling when Tony finally looked back at him, “You are quite safe here. I will not let him harm you, if that is what bothers you so.”
Tony sighed and nodded, knowing Steve was right. If Peter began to fuss, they may be stuck here all night, and he did want to spend time with the others, and
“I wish you would leave,” he said shortly, “I know you are trying to help in the way
“I really am sorry,” Steve said sadly, finding the strength to lean back up and look down at where they were joined together, “It was not always like this. I was… much smaller as a child. It was not until my early adulthood that I filled out. It… it really is not as glamorous as one would think. I would guess that at your brothels, none of your partners have run from the room at the sight of your prick, no?”
Steve, way beyond what Clint and Sam relentlessly teased them about. With that, Tony leaned over to press a kiss to Steve’s cheek and heaved himself up off the bench, jogging out to the field to start practicing for the game. He always liked to practice against Thor and Bucky, since they were much bigger than him; it allowed him to work on his footwork, weaving in and out of their legs to score goals. By the end of the practice, Tony was heaving something fierce, forcing himself to not wipe away his sweat for fear of taking off the makeup.
He gently brushed back Peter’s soft hairs and smiled weakly at the happy baby, letting him nibble on his fingers for a good while. The baby was so very small, even compared to his own small hands, and he feared that one wrong move would hurt the poor thing. He had absolutely no idea how to care for a child; all he had had was a few short months to ask questions that would not arouse suspicion. Even then, the only person he could ask was his mother, and whenever he would get one piece of information, his father would walk in and demand he return to his studies. He was flying almost completely blind, and if it were not for his friends’ counsel and advice, he was sure he would have hurt Peter by now. The thought scared him to death; sure, the babe was far from planned, but Peter was
“Yeah, but Pepper will wheedle at me to talk to him,” he whined, flopping down onto the bed again, “Can’t he just, y’know, hate me like a normal person?”
, he thought
“Room,” PJ said, his voice small but his tone demanding.
“What? So soon? But--no, you do not really mean it--really?” He whispered, “I thought… We can wait,
“That’s good. Also terrifying, considered he was trained by HYDRA,” Steve murmured, keeping his voice low, “Have you talked to him any about—”
“I am not pissy,” Steve grumbled.
“Of course? How could I not be?” Tony said, the words tumbling out before he could stop himself, “He is an
“Sounds good, Tinman.”
Tony looked down at Peter and frowned, bouncing the tot on his knee as he thought. Consequently, he missed the knowing looks the others were sharing. Bucky stood and clapped a hand on his back, then began to corral the others away.
“Is he still on my floor?” Tony asked, jogging to the elevator again.
As they walked, Steve tried to point out more stalls to investigate, but Tony was drawn to a small group of older women sitting in a circle with baskets overflowing with flowers around them. He ignored Steve’s chatter and carefully approached the women, unsure if he was welcome. Once he was close enough, they stopped talking and turned to look at him, only to burst into excited chatter and gather around, peering and cooing at the baby. Peter peeked up over Tony’s shoulder at the women, seemingly unbothered by the commotion.
The boy blinked, a cloud of confusion passing over his face for a moment before he shook his head slowly. He went back to nervously chewing on his thumb, eyes darting to Bruce and Natasha before resting on Tony once more. Breathing slowly to control his own heart rate, Tony smiled at PJ, attempting to be as comforting as possible, despite the anxiety attack that lurked under his raw anger toward HYDRA.
At Steve’s voice, Tony looked up, surprised to see the tamped anguish on the Captain’s face.
“Yeah. Go pick a book,” he said, jerking his head toward the small bookshelf in the room.
Clint shrugged his approval, followed by a hum from Bruce and a knowing look from Natasha. Turning to Steve, Tony swore the Captain looked a little red, but he chalked it up to the heat in the Avengejet’s cabin.
“I got it,” Steve’s voice drifted in as he walked away.
It was hard to talk while moving with such a ferocious ache between his legs, but he managed, even if it stole every ounce of energy from his body. By the time he reached the dining hall and had settled in his chair, he was exhausted and in more pain than he cared to admit. With a grunt, Tony shoved down the feeling and lowered Peter into his arms, tucking him up under his shirt to position him for breakfast.
“It’ll be gone in a few hours. Don’t worry about me. We need to set Clint’s leg before it gets too bad,” Steve answered, rolling his shoulders back before making to stand.
Surprised, Pepper nodded, standing to run over to Bruce first, then to Natasha, sending them both over to Tony. Once they sat next to him, Tony put a finger to his lips, pointing at PJ. The boy made another noise, soft enough to nearly be inaudible.
He forced himself to keep his head tilted up to make eye contact, surprised to find Steve’s worry melt into a shy smile that made his eyes crinkle in the corners. Then, he started to laugh, soft at first, turning into shoulder-shaking cackling as he ducked his head into the crook of Tony’s neck.
“He did
He offered a hand to Steve to help him up off the floor, stepping into his space to hug him with one arm. Steve’s arms came up and wrapped around them both, warm and comforting as they chased away the lingering feelings of fear.
looking forward to.”
“You got that right,” Tony laughed, glad for the respite from uncomfortable memories, “Mom would have taken to you. She always had a thing for blonds. And so did Howard, I mean, he
“We can only have one dramatic one in the kingdom,” Clint said, patting Steve’s shoulder, “Do not tell him I said that.”
Steve looked up at him with hopeful, wide eyes. Gods, he was precious, like a puppy begging for scraps. Somewhere, deep in the recess of his subconscious, Tony noted that he most likely would not be able to say no to Steve if he pulled that face more often. He reached up to smooth out the crease between Steve’s brows, then smiled as he leaned in for a languid kiss. Steve groaned into his mouth and practically melted under his lips; Tony could feel the heat start to pool in his gut at the Alpha’s noises. Reluctantly, he pulled away.
“As long as you rest and stay away from your trigger for a day or so, you should be fine,” he said to Steve, “I will let Barnes know that he is going to be taking over your duties until you are better.”
thought. That… that was not until later.”
Begrudgingly, he turned to look at Rhodey, letting his friend hold onto his upper arms.
“Shh, m’here, shh,” Tony mumbled, coughing heavily with the exertion, “S’okay, shh…”
The elevator doors opened to the common room, showing most of the Avengers already gathered with go bags piled by the entrance. They all turned when the elevator dinged, so PJ turned his head into Tony’s chest, clearly overwhelmed by the situation.
“Just one more thing before morning,” Tony decided spontaneously.
“Yeah?”
“Yeah, didn't have a chance to take a look at it yet.”
His chest warm with satisfaction, Tony patted his thigh, and stretched. Steve’s constant whimpers and tiny moans were music to Tony’s ears but pretending not to notice, he walked to the chest of drawers and checked Steve’s and his own phones for any messages. It was very late, so he wasn’t surprised that there weren’t any. Then whistling, Tony went to the bathroom and quickly got ready for bed.
(Happy BD, Ven! Lob u!) :D
They kissed for a while, Tony drinking Steve’s fervor and soothing him into acceptance. Steve succumbed. Tony held Steve for a little longer until he was again taking deep breaths, his body not exactly relaxed, but not any more trembling. His tears were dried up at least. Steve looked serene, but now with a distinct air of embarrassment as if ashamed of seeking comfort from his captor but unable or unwilling to deny himself.
“Don't need to be married to know how I feel.”
“Well,” Tony said quietly. “I suppose if you want to, you can just give the money to charity?”
Tony grinned. “Whatever you decide, I will enjoy it either way. After all, I do enjoy caning.”
The official’s wide eyes snapped from the badge to ID, to Steve’s face, to the papers and then finally to Tony where they stayed longer than strictly necessary. It was very clear that it was the most interesting thing that had happened to the woman in a very long time, but all her excitement turned into an abashed flush as soon as she laid her eyes on the omega. Inwardly, Steve scoffed, imagining the arrogantly rakish grin that Tony was undoubtedly wearing on his face. And apparently, it was working. Even betas seemed to fall under the O’s charms.
Steve glared challengingly.
Tony chuckled quietly to himself: his pretty toy now.
“I love watching your reactions,” Tony said. “I know you will want to object to everything, but you are mine now and you are going to do as told, yes?”
“It’s okay, everything is going to be okay, yeah?”
"Tony, stop."
“You can marry me,” he blurted, blushed, and squashing all his anxiousness continued recklessly, “We could marry — you and me. I would sign whatever you want, so that you can have your money and your company. You can...” He paused to breathe. “Work. I don't care about convention or any of that.”
“That’s okay, Steve, don’t worry. I can give you a sedative if you feel frightened?” he offered but almost desperately, Steve shook his head. “It’s, okay, it’s okay, I won’t.”
Throughout the whole process, Steve held his eyes closed, breathed calmly in and out, and let Tony do what he willed. Tony knew the compliance wouldn’t last but that felt so good.
Okay. He took a deep breath. Okay. He should be out for a bit yet, Tony had time.
“Secure him.” He turned to Steve. “He got any bags with him?”
“A strike means that I’ll remember how many times you behaved poorly and when there’s quite a bit tallied up…” Tony smirked evilly. “You won’t like the consequences.” He paused. “So what will it be then? You let me do what needs to be done or are you going to fight me?”
“Yes, two bags,” Steve said at the same time as Tony sing-songed ‘right he-ere!’.
“No,” Steve mumbled but there was no real heat in it.
He paused to see if Steve would pose any more protests and when none came, Tony fixed the thing around his head. It was tight but fairly comfortable (Tony had tried it himself), and looked absolutely wonderful. Tony grinned and leaned down to kiss Steve straight on the spot where the black fabric was covering his lips.
They were sitting in the last row near the toilets, and the nearest passengers were seated a row away. Tony at the window, still cuffed, not talking to him. Steve sighed. It was going to be some long four hours. He was proven wrong three minutes in.
"Shuddup—"
TO: thor.odinsson@aveng.si.com
Steve groaned, shifted as if trying to get stimulation for his cock or get rid of the chains or something, but then dejectedly, slumped back as far as his restraints allowed, which wasn’t very far at all.
Tony rolled his eyes and Steve raised his eyebrows in response.
Stark didn’t look very reassured. “Yeah? Prove it!” he challenged.
“But you mean a real marriage, not just for show? I didn’t misunderstand that part, right? You mean we would actually get married and consummate the union and…”
After watching for Steve enjoying the plug for a moment more, he adjusted his pants, and walked around the bed, and stilled. The view from the foot of the bed was even better and for a little bit, Tony stood there and just looked his fill.
"Maybe you misunderstood?" Steve asked, and wanted immediately to take it back. As if he hadn’t sounded naive enough already.
Steve yelled.
There was no answer, and half a minute later, Steve heard Tony moving around: putting the chair upright and clearing the cartons off the table.
“Thank you? For…?”
So, at that point, I knew I had to do
“You the local miracle mechanic? You sure, you out of high school yet?” Steve said, trying to keep himself together.
He looked into Tony’s astonished eyes imploringly.
So you see, despite what had been insinuated, Steve running around your gilded halls buck naked (although what a sight, right?) being chased by the mighty hog until it collapsed, the poor thing, was not at all my idea.
Tony nodded. “Okay, moving on. My phone?”
This startled Steve into action: he twisted and bucked and yelled and squealed. Jerked on his cuffs and the bar his legs were fixed to, but everything was reinforced and nothing gave. Still, Tony, ducking behind Steve, grabbed his testicles into an iron grip and squeezed.
Steve moaned a ‘no’ and Tony grunted with an effort to move carefully for now. Holding onto Steve’s hips, Tony did a couple of moderately slow thrusts, before picking up his pace.
“No,” Steve refuted behind his gag. “No, please.”
“Is there any chance you won’t catch me a second later?”
“I’m the best damn mechanic in the country. And probably several others. Possibly on this planet. Or this dimension even.”
God, he must’ve felt so betrayed, Steve thought, gritting his teeth.
Tony’s lips quivered in something like unhappiness but before Steve could ask about it, he grinned winningly and raised his face to touch his lips to Steve’s nose.
“Okay. Good,” Steve said quietly. “Now, if I let you up, will you promise not to run?”
“Don’t you dare
Steve didn't reply.
“We weren't in love or anything. We never saw each other that way just… He thought it would be easier for me, and after my parents died I actually considered asking him myself, but…”
“Sorry,” he said, adding, "Five million.” He waited a minute and continued, “Steve. Be reasonable!"
“You think I’ll escape from a plane somehow?” Tony asked with a sigh. “Take a pilot hostage?” He raised his cuffed hands and an eyebrow.
Like a jack-in-the-box, Tony got up from the bed. His eyes were alert and alarmed as if he had no idea what he was doing to Steve’s alpha biology. Steve felt his stupid heart squeezing in his chest, and he went to the only window in the room to open it, only to suddenly realize that it had honest-to-god bars on it.
“No.”
“Call me Steve. Steve Rogers.”
“Comfy now, Pretty?” Tony winked and the foggy eyes blinking back at him. “It’s okay, don’t worry, I’m gonna take care of you, yeah?” He trailed his finger gently along Steve’s eyebrow and down his cheek. “So, so beautiful.”
Tony was silent while he let Steve process the information. Sitting quietly, his elbow on the edge of the window, looking out of it as if the whole situation wasn’t one impossibly huge clusterfuck.
“Do I have to cuff you?”
“Fate? You know how it sometimes is - a powerful A and a pretty B, sparks fly...” Nat shrugged, quite naturally in Steve’s opinion, but Stark huffed.
it was like a red rag to a bull!
Tony wanted to kiss him.
“Yeah, peachy.” Stark looked around the shop behind him. “I can get it up and running in a couple of hours, in fact. Just... need this thing from out there.” He nodded past Nat and him, straight out the door as if that way lay salvation.
Tony moaned and opened wider, and Steve's brain shut off.
Tony threw him a look.
“You’re eating a sandwich,” he said gruffly. “The cuffs will stay on.”
“Like it?”
"Steve?"
Watching the omega raising his hands challengingly, Steve suddenly remembered—
"Don't worry, I'll teach you, okay? It’s gonna be alright, sh…"
“Copy.”
FROM: tony.stark@aveng.si.com
“Huh,” he huffed. “You really would, wouldn’t you?” Tony shook his head. “Steve—”
Tony leaped out, took the man into a chokehold and plunged the needle into his strong neck muscles. The man gasped, grabbed after Tony’s forearm and struggled, but slumped only after two seconds.
His jeans getting tighter, Tony’s breathing picked up and he widened the area of his attention. Shoulders arms, inside of the elbow, sides, his chiseled six-pack, nipples again.
“Hey, can I see some ID here?” Tony inserted, refusing to be ignored. “How do I know you’re certified to escort someone as desperately charismatic as me?”
To give him time to get used to the new sensation, Tony stepped away for a moment and standing so that Steve wouldn't see, he checked the boy’s phone. There was one message from Sam inviting Steve to meet up the next day for a game. Tony looked through some recent message history between the two, and sent him ‘Sorry, I’ve got a busy week coming up. Raincheck?’ It was only three seconds later that he got a reply in the form of ‘NP. Njoy.’ He put the phone back into the drawer and turned around.
“See this?” he showed him the beautiful crop only to see Steve’s eyes widening in alarm. “I got it made especially for today. It matches your lighter blue gag and the plug I’ll use later.” He smiled at how Steve was squirming at Tony’s words, desperately trying to hide his arousal.
“If you make it worth my while,” Nat replied.
“Fuck me.”
Steve grinned. Tony was actually thinking about it. Steve couldn’t believe it - Tony was
Which they did. When they arrived at the garage, the doors were open and the sound of a radio could be heard from the back.
Shaving two years off, huh? Smart. Well, he could definitely carry it off without facial hair like he was.
Steven Grant Rogers, year of fabrication 1992. Made in New York.
Steve moved fast — he leaped through the front room only to see the O with one leg out the back window and a backpack in his hand. The next moment, Stark was face down on the floor with Steve’s knee between his shoulder blades.
Steve pulled Tony to closer himself and slid his palm over the O's shirt front. Tony shivered.
Steve stared into his omega’s eyes, then sighed happily and nodded. Everything was going to be okay. Happiness made Steve feel powerful. He would protect Tony. Everything was going to be alright.
“Wire five mil into an offshore account and text you how to access it,” Tony replied, his eyes trained on his food.
“Or another thought... I’ll just fix your hips via a metal rod in your bum,” Tony said, smirking viciously.
“Want a drink?”
Natasha glared at Steve.
I’d like you to top something off, sure, Steve thought nonsensically. He shook his head.
He slid the tip of the crop down over Steve’s shaved balls and to his delight, Steve visibly shivered.
“So, tell me, Steve,” Nat said conversationally. “You from around here?”
That seemed to sober Tony up immediately.
Natasha had come inside too, but remained near the door, silently cataloging everything she saw.
“No.”
“You’re lucky that I like you,” he said, laughter still in his voice.
“How’re you doing, sweetheart?”
It was only twenty minutes later that he saw a tall blond hunk coming out of a bar. Tony’s breath hitched, his palms started sweating in his gloves. Quickly, he pulled a black knit cap low over his hair, so that only people who saw his face directly, could have a chance of recognizing him.
Their arms around each other, their bodies pressed together as their lips were battling for whatever they could get and more. Steve groaned. His insides were trembling, his knees were weak, and there was a bright light behind his eyelids.
For a fraction of a moment, Stark stared at them in disbelief, but then nodded. “Deal.”
Fuck!
“I came for my bike,” Steve said, stepping in further. “I walked it here last night?”
“Oh? That’s good!”
“Probably. Did you let Obie know that we are coming?”
“The new forehead of security?” Tony said feigning delight. “Nice! And the Dave Bautista here? He the butt?”
“Copy.”
didn’t say anything bad about him! Steve was the one to goad the others, and I will tell you how in a minute.
“The words are seared into my brain,” Tony said, his lips twisting in distaste.
“And then the same with your left ankle, okay?”
Grinning happily he sauntered back to the bed, upended the small box of thin chains on Steve’s chest, and stood there, looking down at his boy.
“He’s not handcuffed?” Kwazoffsky asked Steve, pointedly ignoring all Tony’s antics, but Steve would see that the man was annoyed.
Tony scoffed. “And you are actually willing to do that? To become a criminal?”
Tony exited his vehicle quietly, and trying not to actually sneak, walked quietly around his van and stopped behind it, waiting.
He turned towards the dresser and took a hold of a small dark blue remote that matched the rest of his equipment, and turned the vibrator plug on. He started on the lowest setting but Steve still jolted with his whole body and Tony could clearly see him reflexively clench around the base of the plug.
Smiling, Tony leaned down to kiss the little pucker and unbuckled his jeans. Steve tried jerking away but the pain in his nipples and testicles held him in place more than anything else.
(See the end of the chapter for
The O grunted, swore, and stopped struggling.
“Aw, it’s okay,” Tony said soothingly but not sympathetically. “I’ll be quick, I promise.”
Without waiting for an answer, Tony picked up the water bottle from the nightstand and opened it.
Pushing the table away from himself, Steve stood, his chair clattering behind him.
“Okay, third,” he continued intently, “your pleasure is mine. I’m going to lock up your cock for the foreseeable future. Of course, I’m always happy to see it trying to get enthusiastic, but being erect is a privilege that will need to be earned.” Now, Steve’s pupils were definitely blown, and Tony leaned into the boy’s ear and whispered, “See? I knew you could be good. So perfect for me, my little toy.”
He petted Steve's face and made soothing noises until his boy settled and Tony smiled at him.
Steve looked back.
Sighing, Tony rolled his eyes. “What are you even talking about? You were the one who confiscated my pills!”
Zip ties. Duck tape. Remove personal items: phone (put on silent for now), a pack of tissues, car-, no, bike keys, a pocket knife, and a wallet.
Involuntarily, Steve snorted. “Tony.” He sighed with a smile. “I told you, I’ve never really talked to an omega before.”
“I’ll ungag you for a bit, but don’t scream or I’ll shove it back in, understand?” he asked with a steely note in his voice.
“Just leave your bike here, my guy’s gonna fix it in no time,” Gary, the owner, said. “Got golden hands, he has.”
“Give me a second,” came the same voice. “I need to…”
A shake.
It took Steve several long seconds, but finally, finally he nodded.
He looked desperate, his face red, body tense and trembling, but whether it was to escape the fucking or succumb to it he might not even know himself. There was no real panic in his eyes though and smirking, Tony pushed in.
“Shush, shush, baby, it’s okay. I’m sorry, I didn’t mean for you to experience this just yet, I’m so sorry,” he whispered urgently, soothingly, in sympathy and pleasure. “But it’s okay, you did nothing wrong baby, I’m glad you came like this. It was gorgeous and I loved it.”
“Good,” he whispered, stepped back, and reached for the dark blue the crop on his dresser.
I enjoyed writing this very much and I hope you enjoyed reading! :)
Stark stilled.
Glaring, Steve rubbed his red mark against his shoulder.
“Yeah,” Tony acknowledged. “Yeah, okay, but… we’ve only known each other for two days. It's not…”
Steve made a small discontent noise, squirming a little as if trying to get free, so Tony put his palms on the man's shoulders and prepared for the worst.
Now looking more confident, Steve nodded.
“Well, maybe,” Tony drawled, “if the Pretty Face’s butt is cute… comparatively...” He leaned back to check out Steve’s ass, then as if to compare, also Payne’s and Kwazoffsky’s.
“I’ve done a number on you, haven’t I?” Tony muttered.
“Think a minute about what you really want here, yeah? Do you want to be sedated for this or do you want to be aware? Because I can work with either. I will beat you and will give you pleasure however and whenever I want, and you will thank me for both. So tell me — do I tranq you or can you behave?”
Steve glared, but he was also blushing, so Tony counted that as a win. Smiling, he went on to get the cleaning rag.
badly?
Steve glared, but when Tony slowly slid the tip of the riding crop from the meat of Steve’s ass up his side, over his chest and a nipple, his eyes fluttered. Yes. Tony had him.
omega. An omega who was watching him, smiling. A decision ready and firm on his face.
Steve huffed a muffled laugh, and Tony’s heart soared.
“God…” Tony moaned is final euphoria of release and slumped between Steve’s legs, who was still tense, swallowing convulsively, shaking with the strain of an uncomfortable position, his poor caged cock weeping precum and his hole leaking of Tony’s semen.
He nodded. “Yes, Tony,” he said and went.
‘I love you,’ Tony thought.
“I’ll put you in a different position in the morning after I’ve fucked you,” he added and rubbed himself against Steve’s body.
“You would really do that for me?”
Steve seemed to be suppressing a shiver as he let his head fall back on the bed, probably to internalize the sensation.
“No family. My friends will cope.”
Despite all the precautions, the walk to the car was short and uneventful.
“We probably won’t be able to get away at the airport, but I have other ideas,” Steve said.
"Sh, don't pull away, darling it’s okay. I know this is your first time as a live-in pleasure toy."
“Leave,” Stark declared. “Right now. Come back tomorrow morning for your bike and leave me be.”
Tony pursed his lips. “I remember.” His face becoming somber, Tony shifted to relax more comfortably into his seat. Or maybe to hide into it. “Well, the long and short of it is that I believe in the universally abhorred idea of having the right to choose when and even
“I’m gonna fuck you now,” Tony said, his voice hoarse.
Tony’s eyes searched for the truth in Steve’s and for a long minute they just stared at each other. Then blinking, Tony pulled back.
“Would you marry him now?” Steve asked, his throat tight.
“I don’t think so. Obie’s personal security and SI general security are separate entities. And if the guy in duty is new, I’ll simply charm my way in.”
Tony simply nodded and went on.
"Just my word."
“You sure it’s him?” he asked Nat a couple of hours later, after making a show of their staged meet-and-flirt at the inn's bar.
“Ha!” he exclaimed as he found what he was looking for.
“Good boy.”
More protests but thankfully, Steve still didn't manage to muster up any actual anger or other strong emotion.
Your faithful friend,
Steve grunted. He’d fucked up. Besides Obie’s people, the airport would have its own security, and Stane had probably already secured their cooperation.
Tony sat on the bed, cupping his captive’s cheek and to his satisfaction, Steve didn't pull away. Instead, his anxious eyes were full of questions and a need for reassurance. That was fantastic — the drugs seemed to be still working.
“I’m so proud of you, Steve,” Tony continued. “Okay, so just because you did so good on your first test, I’m going to tell you what is going on now, okay?”
“I think it’s relatively safe. I used to be in and out of the SI labs at all hours before, so I doubt security would call Obie the middle of the night to ask if I have a right to be there. It’s not public knowledge that I’ve escaped, so why would he?”
Steve nodded, swallowing. He averted his gaze and thought.
“Lift your head a little, will you?” Tony said, put his palm under Steve’s head and helped to get it just high enough to fasten the carabinier to the one side of the ball gag. “Very good,” he praised, fastening the other nipple clamp to the other side of the gag the same way.
Steve mulled this over. There was a stupid, really stupid idea nagging at his brain, but he clamped his mouth firmly shut and let the O continue. With a sigh, Tony did.
“Good boy,” Tony praised, and Steve’s eyes fluttered close, making Tony's chest also lighter.
"Romance for the ages?" Steve smiled, watching Tony’s fingers flexing around the strap of his backpack in silent anxiousness. “But, Tony, you’ve smelt like beta for the most of it, and I’ve liked you since the moment we met. You can’t argue with that.”
“You sure?”
For all their strategizing on the plane, their plans were still mostly up in the air. The good thing was that getting to the servers was relatively easy, but the downside was that getting to them without alerting the security team guarding Tony would be problematic. Compromising himself wasn’t something Steve was keen on doing. He understood that Tony’s options were mostly to take the money and run or remain a captive for the rest of his life, but for Steve, it was becoming a criminal, and that, despite how righteous it felt, didn’t seem like an ideal choice.
"What?” Having forgotten to look cool for once, Tony raised both brows, his eyes large and unblinking — a picture of incredulity. “Have you never seen coke before?" He was also starting to sound a little hysterical.
“Steve,” Steve heard himself say.
Clicking the plug off, Tony rushed down to Steve, hugged him, kissed his face.
“I like this new normal,” he said, and lying down next to Steve, pulled the covers up over them both.
Steve’s head was now held up at a deliciously awkward angle. He tried to pull his head away but with a soft yelp, stopped.
Tony startled and stopped, his face guilty as hell.
Now, Steve’s reply came even more quickly in the form of a shake.
He took a sip of his beer and leaning back, glanced around the room before bringing his gaze back next to Nat’s head. Her fingers were still on his. She shrugged, still looking into the mirror behind Steve.
Steve decided to not roll his eyes.
Even as he shivered, Steve turned away his gaze. Tony chuckled and retied Steve’s wrist.
“Oh come on, Steve! I’m not an idiot!” Tony pursed his lips while drumming his fingers on the kitchen table. “You’ll be charged with kidnapping. It’s a serious crime!”
Bolder now, Tony put both palms on Steve’s shoulders and caressing his silky skin, trailed his palms up to his elbows, then down on his chest and the nice pink nubs on his beautiful wide, strong tits. He played with Steve’s nipples and by the way the boy’s breath stuttered, he surmised that maybe he wouldn’t need another dose of aphrodisiac after all. Maybe Steve was actually into it.
“Can’t risk you trying to cause an accident,” Steve explained, but Stark just stared mutinously out of the window. “Look. This is for your own good. You know that your guardian and Mr. Stone just want what’s best for you.”
His body was warm and pliant against Steve’s and for a second, Steve just breathed in the neutral scent that more than anything, resembled a beta’s, but it still made his gut tighten in a distinctly pleasurable way.
His blue eyes almost panicky, Steve shook his head.
“What?”
“You remember what I told you about punishment?” he asked Steve very, very quietly. “Or I can drug you again and make you like it that way?” He paused, giving Steve time to process his words, and added, “Or you can keep still?”
Natasha smirked. “I'm a novelist. I'm writing about the accident that took place at the mines around here two centuries back.”
Steve huffed. “So yeah, maybe I got a little… elated in there, but I do like you, Tony, okay?” He looked up, eyes searching for the horizon, but it was filled with rows and rows of similar dark roofs. Damn it. He shouldn’t have told Tony that he loved him. Clearly, it was too soon. Hell, Steve would be the first to admit, now that he was thoroughly detoxicated, that having a big crush on the first omega he’d ever interacted with looked a little stupid. "I
“Ha-fucking-ha.”
“That’s okay, Steve,” Tony soothed the boy while patting his thigh. “Not too uncomfortable, is it? Don’t worry, you’ll get used to it.”
Steve nodded and they left. A little way down the street, Nat slipped away into an alley and Steve dialed Clint.
“Damn it, Tony! Can you just… not?”
“Fuck,” Tony grunted, “Such a good boy, Steve, so good...”
Taking a calming breath, Tony went on, “And this bad boy here…” Tony let the flat tip of his riding crop trail the length of Steve’s cock cage and then tapped it lightly, startling Steve into a jolt and a whimper. “This bad boy here... will remain sheathed until I say otherwise.”
“Good enough,” Steve replied, thinking of how and when it would be easiest to make their move.
“I think I love you,” Steve said breathlessly when Tony pulled away.
“No, seriously.” Steve was trying to talk quietly so that the rest of the cabin wouldn’t hear them. “Imagine I’m an idiot.”
Slowly, the O — Stark turned around and looked at Steve, disbelievingly.
“I… what?” Steve muttered, feeling confused. “But they were…” Sharply, all the blocks of information slotted into place and bile rose into his mouth. “Mr. Stane thought they were narcotics.” But even as he was saying the words, he knew that it wasn’t the truth.
“Dumbass,” Tony retaliated in a tone that implied agreement.
Steve’s face split into a wide smile, and he tilted his head to look at the beautiful person standing in front of him. An omega.
Ignoring his boy’s further pleas, he fixed the spreader bar to the foot of the bed and not wanting to distract Steve much from his building pleasure, removed the nipple and ball clamps at the same time with raising the vibration lever a level.
Smiling, he went to put out the lights and, sitting back down on the bed, patted Steve’s hip.
Then, as suddenly as Tony started, he stopped.
“No.”
Steve’s breathing was becoming labored and so was Tony's.
“Beautiful.”
“You want to kiss me, don’t you?” Tony smirked.
Steve let out a tiny sound of indignation, but his eyes were sparkling with humor, and the sigh he let out from behind his muzzle was only a little frustrated.
Steve’s chin was on his chest, trying to see what the pile of chains actually was, but despite seeing it perfectly well, he seemed confused.
Once inside the airport, Steve guided Tony to walk in front of him toward the commercial flight area and went straight to the ticketing clerk.
"Gag," Steve just threatened, but then he felt fingers on his belt buckle and suddenly clear-headed, Steve pushed Tony away.
Tony pursed his lips thoughtfully. “If we marry, Obie will never be able to do anything about it unless he sues you in civil court for kidnapping, but without my testimony, he’s got bupkis.”
“And upend your whole life? What about your family? Friends?”
He landed another blow on Steve’s asshole and this time, his boy kept still.
“See these? These… are going on your balls,” he said, pulled them taut, and carefully fastened them on the tender skin of each testicle.
Now it was Steve’s turn to laugh. “Sure you have. Since the very first time I saw you grab that heavy screwdriver in the garage.”
“What's wrong?” Stark’s smile was wry. “How about the fact that two total strangers appear the same day in a place where you can go several weeks without meeting an unfamiliar face and suddenly they're doing everything together. How's that for wrong?”
“Stark!” Steve hissed, pressing down on his back harder.
Shit.
Tony gasped mockingly. “The forehead and a butt leaving me with a pretty face here? Uncle Obie is getting cheap in his old age…”
“There,” he said, and stopped to admire his handiwork.
“So obviously," he went on in a calming tone when Steve started looking at him with a modicum of trust again, "we’ll need to work out some ground rules. First, your place, for now, is this very same bed. You are going to remain here, comfy and safe until I can see that I can trust you. After that happens, you’ll get the privilege to move around this room, and maybe even outside, but let's not get ahead of ourselves, right?"
Steve nodded his acknowledgment.
“I…” Shit. “I might’ve flushed them down the toilet at the airport," Steve finished relatively calmly, all things considered.
Faint, louder, louder, here—
Steve rubbed his face with both hands, unable to believe what a goddamned fool he’d been. And he’d signed a contract with such a man. Gave him his word to bring Tony in—
Another blow, and another, and more. With each hit, Tony got more and more worked up as Steve jerked and hissed, his eyes tightly closed, pressing a lone tear out here and there.
He rubbed his wrists as if they had actually been too tight and Steve had to struggle not to roll his eyes in relief. Seemed that they weren’t doomed to spend the flight in silence after all.
“I’m there.” Tony nodded sagely.
“Fantastic! You’re such a good boy, aren’t you, Stevie?” Tony caressed his face again and Steve’s needy face seemed to be soaking up every little drop of affection Tony offered.
“Nipple clamps,” Tony explained.
"No, listen," Stark said, shifting in his seat. Steve could feel his stare on the side of his head. "I can get the money. I have a plan."
He patted Steve’s cock, which earned him another delicious whimper and a look that was too aroused to accomplish an actual glare it was attempting. Flashing Steve a victorious grin, Tony unhooked the spreader bar from the contraption that was holding it upwards and carefully lowered Steve’s legs back on the bed.
He lay down on the bed, half on top of Steve, and embraced him. Still crying, Steve turned to hide his face into the crook of Tony’s neck and Tony took a deep, deep breath of satisfaction. Steve’s sweat, tears, and arousal smelled so good.
said—
Rogers?” Tony returned, his words precise and cutting. “I’m getting out tonight, so that makes me
Tony blinked, startled. “Right.”
A short while later, he heard the front door creak and leaped up in alarm. He ran around the house and what he saw made his blood boil in betrayal — Tony, his backpack over his shoulder, was creeping as quietly as he could down the porch stairs.
"Sh! It's okay," he said soothingly, "it's okay, let me take care of you, yeah?" He watched the foggy blue eyes blink. "Feeling a bit weak, yeah? It's alright, well be at the hospital soon," he lied.
He couldn’t even say it.
Steve stared. “What?”
“Empty.” Steve felt like growling. “Figures.”
Thank you to the many people that helped me, but especially my dear BuckyAboveEverything who went over my text, again and again. You are a treasure!! <3
“Sh! Sh... It’s okay, Steve.”
He opened the cupboard and brought all the necessary equipment. It wasn't much — thankfully, the boy was already shaved so Tony simply needed to slick him up, slip the tight ring around the whole equipment and squeeze his balls tightly.
“God,” Tony whispered in awe as Steve’s upper body tried jack-knifing up and his poor bound cock started spurting the watery precum liquid.
He pulled his lips over his teeth into a rictus of a smile and Steve’s fists tightened. He wasn’t sure if he wanted to punch the omega or put his arms around him. To squeeze and press his face near the biting gland; or maybe just wipe that painful expression off Tony’s face with his own version of a smile, his lips on the O’s.
He tried to look casual, but his tone had already given him away, and Tony glanced sharply at him.
And a huge thank you to Bae, who's been a wonderful, WONDERFUL beta!! Love you!! <3
“Steve, Steve, Steve,” Tony chanted as he was pistoning in and out, in and out, and—
Steve stifled his own moan and tried shaking his head before realizing again that it was impossible. Another hard thrust and Steve seemed to be succumbing to the necessity. He was clenching, pushing back, inviting Tony’s cock in.
Despite the itch, Steve kept smiling. “Gonna ditch me once we have him?”
Purchasing the tickets and the paperwork didn’t take much time. Steve only had to place a phone call to Mr. Stane’s office about their arrival, and soon, Steve was ushering Tony into the food court. Despite the previous devil-may-care attitude, all through getting their food and carrying it to the table, Tony was strangely subdued and Steve started feeling bad for him.
“You're… you’re serious.” Tony sighed. “Of course you are.” He closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose. “And you just destroyed my anonymity, you dumbass.” Raising his angry eyes to Steve’s, he continued in a low, dangerous voice, “You do realize that by tomorrow morning, every dumbass is going to know that I’m an omega?”
It would be risky. No way Stark wouldn’t run if they just turned around here and left, but the alternative was decking him over his head or carrying him out kicking and screaming in broad daylight. Both options were unfortunately out of the question.
Steve whimpered.
After a little while, Stark cleared his throat.
Panting, he turned around and walked to the window to pull some fresh oxygen into his lungs.
"Okay.” Tony finally gave an impatient half-shrug. “Okay, you win," he repeated. "We’ll try it your way. Make it a real marriage.”
“Move,” Steve told Stark, nodding towards the front door.
“Stark’s running, take position.”
“Any chance you’ll uncuff me for the meal?” Tony interrupted him.
“It’s not about the money,” Steve lied. “Well, it shouldn’t be at least,” he corrected himself. “It’s so that you could get better, okay? There are people who care about you and they want you to get better, but they can’t help you if you—”
"Hypocrite."
“A bit in a hurry, yeah."
“What exactly,” he started off slowly, “makes you think that Mr. Stane would not allow you suppressants? This is not the dark ages. Of course, he's going to allow you the suppressants. It’s your right! And especially now that you are breaking up with your fiance. I mean, only the pious folk in the south…” He trailed off at Tony’s face getting progressively incredulous. “He didn’t come across as…” he halted. Had he really misread the situation
Tony knew the calm wouldn’t last. Tomorrow was going to be a fight, a struggle and he’d have to use all cunning and some brute force to make Steve submit.
He went on. Changed the sides, his hands. Worked over the boy's legs, calves, the tender flesh of the inside of his thighs. Steve bore it all with clenched teeth and burning eyes, but otherwise was silent and deliberately unresponsive. Tony wasn’t worried, Steve would let go eventually. Even now, still so defiant, Steve was obviously very much engaged with what Tony was doing, looking at him with that bullheaded determination.
“I don’t care.” Steve glared at the omega. “You’ll give me money, I’ll disappear.”
“Yeah, don’t I know it.” His eyes were roaming the shelf to his left while keeping Steve and Nat in his view. “And that other buff alpha lurking in a shiny dark vintage at the edge of the town? Also a coincidence?”
“Richard Payne,” the other man said to Steve, not at all rattled. “We are here to escort you and your charge to your temporary safe house.”
—the feel of those hands on his thigh. Steve’s cock twitched, and he looked away, feeling that thrice-damned blush creeping up his stupid cheeks again.
“I don’t know, I think he…” Tony trailed off for a moment. “I think Rhody is seeing someone already. Seems serious.”
Tony threw the crop on the bed, grabbed the lotion from the nightstand, and squirted a bit on the puffy red pucker. He knelt down, petted and soothed the poor hole, and to his delight, Steve sighed as if content. Tony raised his head to look at his boy and their eyes locked.
Stark flinched.
“I did exactly as you told me to!” he exclaimed defensively.
"It's okay, don't worry about it," Tony said soothingly. "I'll take care of you. I just need you to wait a little longer at the back here, yeah?"
“Fine,” he said, taking the key out. “But they go back on once we start landing.” He uncuffed the omega. “After all, I do love our public games.”
Tony rolled his eyes. “But then, Obie will know that you breached the contract and you’ll be in trouble.”
He tried to protest to the undressing, but his limbs had still been weak and tongue soft, so feeling already half-hard from anticipation, Tony stripped him, tied him spread eagle on the bed, and gagged him with a pretty light blue ball-gag that complimented his eyes perfectly.
Tony petted Steve’s hair, putting the other hand lightly on his shoulder. It was important to start introducing intimate touch with gentleness at this stage.
Just as the kid started faux casually moving towards the door, out of some unnamed instinct, Steve stepped directly into his path.
I know, he’ll try and pin this on me, but believe me when I say this: nothing that happened was at all my intention.
“Any deadlines coming up?”
Steve waited for him to elaborate.
“You got high on pheromones,” Tony said, not looking at him.
“Fuck.”
Steve’s hair was plastered to his head with sweat, his skin was flushed and his breath was still short. Despite the intent look that was cautiously trailing after Tony’s every movement, Steve was still clearly aroused.
“I would,” Steve confirmed.
"So maybe," he mumbled, "I’m a little in love with you too.”
Tony waited for the silent confirmation, then continued, “Alright then,” he paused, “Not yet, at least.”
He stepped back, so Steve put his hands into pockets and looked down at the gravel.
Steve took another deep breath. “I suppose, I can.”
“I’m gonna tell you what you are not gonna do, Mr. Stark,” Payne said. “You’re not gonna bite my arse.”
He trailed his index finger down to one nipple, flicked it, and at Steve’s whimper, repeated it with the other.
“The backstreets are empty,” Nat called to tell him a minute later. “I’ll go to the bridge, you get to the motel.”
“Fine,” Steve decided. “We’re going. Just keep your thoughts about us to yourself so we can get the bastard we are after, deal?”
“Good,” Tony praised, “that’s good.” He smiled at Steve proudly. “And how about your work? Do you need to go in during the next week or so?”
“Alright,” Tony said huskily between kisses, “Steve… Rogers… God..."
He'd made his voice deeper as if imitating someone and Steve had to suppress a disgusted shiver.
Suddenly feeling confident, he snapped his gaze up.
Steve’s face morphed through expressions of indignation, pleasure, and embarrassment. Smiling goofily, Tony came around the bed, unclasped Steve’s gag from the nipple clamps, and helped him lower his head gently to the pillow.
**Just a warning:**
“Any idea what this is?”
The threat worked: Steve grit his teeth, then, just like a doll with its strings cut, he closed his eyes, and relaxed.
“Next step,” he said, making Steve’s eyes pop open. “Don’t tense up,” he said cheerfully, “it won’t play well. Besides, you were just starting to enjoy it — no, don’t deny it. It was obvious.”
“Okay, boy,” Tony said, keeping his voice firm. “This is how it’s going to be: for discipline, you get this crop or a flog or I might choose to spank you. In thanks, you do as you are told, nothing more, nothing less. If you are good, you get my care and admiration, if not there is going to be a punishment.” He paused for effect. “And believe me, you don’t want to get punished.”
“Good boy,” Tony told Steve who was now lying on his side.
“Okay," Tony replied. "Okay, so when does your buddy expect us? Are you sure we don’t have time for a quickie?”
“Such a wonderful toy,” he whispered, smiling.
"Tony."
Ok, so what is important here is that he
For a moment, the O’s eyes jumped between the door and the back window behind Steve’s shoulder.
“At the front,” Nat replied, having obviously already arrived.
"You're going to take the money then?" Tony asked with barely concealed eagerness.
Steve nodded.
“Yes.” Steve sighed. “What other option is there? I mean, can we prove abuse? I can testify if I see something but…”
And Steve… howled.
Steve had to concede the point, and stood up.
“Hold your horses, Mr. Rogers,” he said with an adorable smile. “We’re not even married yet.”
“And college,” the kid exclaimed in mock hurt. “I'm twenty-two, I'll have you know. Having a gap year. Say ‘thank you’.”
Steve sighed. He didn’t deign to answer, but felt infinitely better seeing life in the young man’s eyes again, even if he was snickering at his expense. It didn’t matter. Two minutes later, Stark was in the car, handcuffed to the door and then they were off.
“The bike okay?” he asked.
Tony Stark, 24, the heir to Stark Industries, seemed determined to disappear off the face of the planet and have nothing to do with his legacy. Or possibly his fiance Tiberius Stone, another filthy rich industrialist. It was a nasty job, but someone had to do it and Steve needed the money desperately. Stane was offering a
him?!” He yelled, “You took advantage of him when he needed
Tired and spent, he wanted to collapse on top of Steve, but he was sure the man was over-sensitized and needed some space. Gingerly, he pulled out his softening cock and helped Steve ease his legs down, then splashed up some of the lake water to clean up what he could.
“Yes, you idiot. Every time I walk in the room, you immediately leave or find some excuse so you
“She forgot to throw away the empty bottles before he called for me,” Tony explained quietly.
He pulled his best friend into a hug, scraping his blunt nails against his scalp to get Steve to relax in his arms. Though they’d known Steve had had asthma and various other ailments for a long time and had to be careful because of them, his latest diagnosis of mild scoliosis had really kicked him down since he’d had to buy a new backpack and quit the soccer team.
“Steve. Even
“Sleep?” Steve asked hopefully, lifting the furs.
“It’s certainly possible,” Bruce said upon returning, one of Tony’s smoothie thermoses in hand to give to Steve, “We’ll find out. I’m guessing that the stress of the crash plus Steve’s natural tendency to care for the team added to it. And if he prefers to bottom for Tony, that may have caused his body to decide that perhaps he needs to lactate.”
“You just did, but sure,” Steve teased, grunting when the other pinched his side.
He pressed a kiss to the top of Peter’s head and shushed him as guilt wound its way around his heart and squeezed. Steve must have felt it, as he gathered them both into his arms to draw them closer to his scent. He seemed to work his Alpha magic and Peter’s tears dried up to quiet sniffles.
“Oh, gods, Tony, no! No, no, darling, never,” Steve interrupted, his light skin quickly heating into a rosy pink, “You are
“I doubt it. Have you
“Hello, little one. Got away from Papa, did you?” He asked, kissing Peter’s forehead.
“What!” Steve nearly yelled, only to be hushed by Bucky.
He backed up until he hit the wall and slid down to his haunches, curling up around Peter to soothe him. The sound of running feet had him looking up to see Natasha approaching with a broom, which she used to whack against the cell so Steve would scurry back. He hissed at her, so she smacked the cell again for good measure, baring her teeth until he settled down.
He could hear them.
There was no argument. With that, Natasha waved her hand, at which they all scrambled to their feet. Together, they rearranged the furniture and dragged out the dining room chairs, setting up three sets of pairs with a chair in the front for Natasha. Once they were settled, Nat held out the hat, to which Thor plucked a name first.
social. I just happen to now have a small charge that I’d rather devote my time and energy to.”
Tony rolled his eyes, but nodded, content with the knowledge that he was, for the moment, safe. He nearly was about to drift off when a sudden thought caused him to sit up straight, almost vomiting from the rush of blood.
As per his first investigation, the mattress was certainly chained to the bed frame, but the bed frame wasn’t chained down. Snorting a laugh, Tony slowly dragged over the second bed, fitting it up against the first bed to make a larger area to lay down. With a wince, he laid down and sprawled on the beds, smiling as PJ then settled down next to him, careful to be on his side that wasn’t being iced.
“Shut your whore mouth, Barton.”
With the Hulk standing guard, the other Avengers made their way into the small building, with Thor bringing up the rear. Tony cast his repulsors brighter, illuminating the wreckage that lay before them.
“I am tired too, love,” Tony agreed, yawning when Peter’s little eyes blinked sleepily, “A quick doze will be good for us, and when you wake up your Papa should be right as rain and ready to give you attention, I
At Steve’s nod, he turned to lead them back to their bed but paused on the first step. Embarrassed, Tony slowly turned back around and wrung his hands.
Sam rolled his eyes, shaking his head slowly.
The child blinked up at Tony before sticking his thumb in his mouth, seemingly chewing on it before nodding slowly. Still wary, he glanced around at the others, then ducked his head, silently staring at the floor.
Steve stood with a slouch, keeping his head down as he shuffled out the door. Tony followed behind him, only to pause in the doorway once he saw the three men that had left them hanging around in the hallway.
The Captain blushed slightly, shrugging at the nickname. He merely hummed in response, continuing to trace lines and shapes over Tony’s back as they watched PJ start to slow down and settle in Tony’s arms. It didn’t take long for the child to nearly drift off, at which Tony stood, pressing a kiss to the boy’s head and setting him on his feet.
“Cap, I got a shot—”
“See if there’s an aerated cast in the kit,” he called, forcing his eyes open to prevent himself from falling asleep, “That’ll hold it until we can get to medical.”
anything, but I know I should anyway. You deserve so much better, my love. Can you forgive me?”
With that, he stood, squeezing Tony’s shoulder and placing a kiss on his temple.
“Tony, love,
Steve raised an eyebrow at Tony as he stood from the bed, holding his hand out to the boy.
“Stay,” Tony said before turning to go investigate the other bed.
“I am sorry, Tony. Forgive me. Again, in my haste, I--”
“Is that a mocha?” Rhodey asked, nose crinkling as he sniffed the air, “I didn’t know you were a mocha person. I thought you only drank black.”
“Hey you. I was bringing you an express delivery, but I kinda got held up in Brooklyn,” he explained, his voice muffled by Natasha’s shoulder.
“Tony, let’s clean up and go watch that movie,” he said, going over to take Tony’s hand with a smile.
. You remember Rhodey, right baby? Hm? Think you can look up for me?”
Tony grinned at Steve’s eye roll and laughed. He bounced back and forth on the balls of his feet to ready himself for his partner’s first strike.
“Do that again,” Steve said flatly, pulling back slightly to look Tony in the eyes.
He choked on his words when Peter latched onto his already sore nipple, hissing at the aching pain that shot through his chest. First, he settled into the bath, then he gently pulled Peter away, cradling the babe in his other arm and moving him back up to his chest. On instinct, Pete found his other nipple and began to feed, eyes slipping shut and small hands holding tight to his chest hair.
“Buck,” Steve pleaded softly, not taking his eyes off Tony as he threaded his gloved fingers through his husband’s sandy hair. “Please.”
The routine speech died on his lips once he worked off the helmet.
One more chapter left. Thank you if you've stuck around this long.
“So, it goes like this—”
Rhodey made a face of disgust, to which Tony shrugged.
“It’s Italian. It means young child or babe,” he explained, looking away, “My mom used to call me that when I was younger.”
Tony rolled his eyes and handed his cup to him, waiting for PJ to make his loop before grabbing him under his armpits and lifting him into his arms with a grunt. PJ squealed happily, wriggling as he tried to push Tony away.
Understand?”
Natasha fixed him with a stare, but she ultimately relented and opened the cell door for Tony to enter.
“I’m fine. Just—just my bruising from the captivity,” he explained, wheezing a bit, “Broke some ribs, that’s all.”
“I, uh, everyone is. I mean, to some degree, you’re
“Sniffles,” he repeated.
He worked slowly as to not jostle the babe too much, methodically working down his arms and legs with the soap until he felt decently clean. He made sure to have a good hold on Peter before he got up and stepped out of the bath, letting the water drain and putting the bar of soap back where he had found it. There were no drying cloths in sight, so Tony headed out into the bedroom, figuring they could air dry for a bit while he scrounged through the closet for more clothes. Just as he crossed halfway through the room, the door swung open and he stopped, eyes widening when he realized Steve was standing frozen in the doorway. Acutely aware of his nudity and Pete’s attachment, he tried to say something, but Steve was faster; the Alpha squeaked and clapped a hand over his eyes, ducking his head down. He tried to back out of the room, but he instead smacked into the wall, groaning and clutching at his back.
“Steven, if you do not apologize right now, you will be sleeping outside tonight,” he threatened, immediately regretting his words when Steve’s eyes turned sad.
“Ah, ah. Let me finish. It’s a six-year term, but I’ll have holidays off and a month here and there to come home. It’s—It’s a really good opportunity, Tones. What they want me to do requires a high clearance, the pay is good and I can go
Clint hummed in agreement. “I think you gave him a reason to get up in the morning, Stark.”
“I’ll miss you, Tony. Gonna get here early t’morrow so we can play b’fore math,” Steve declared, not pulling away, “An’ we gonna play house again, okay?”
Bruce hesitated, pursing his lips as he looked Tony over.
“Hey, now there’s a good sound,” He said softly, clearly laying on his boyish charm, “You have a cute laugh, kiddo.”
She snorted in reply, making Steve grin and close his eyes, thunking his head back against the jet. The banter came easily as the adrenaline was draining from his body, but his smile quickly turned to a grimace at Clint’s loud cry at having his leg re-set and strapped in place to prevent it from moving.
. Would you like that?”
“Go? Go where?” Tony asked, understandably confused.
“So either I let him suckle or I die?” he said flatly.
“Quiet, you,” Tony hissed back, “That is
“Steve, honey, breathe,” Tony said calmly, reaching out with both hands to take Steve’s shoulders, “Stay with me, okay? You’re starting to hyperventilate, you’ll set off your asthma if you’re not careful.”
“Tony?”
PJ reached out toward Tony, patting his small hand on his face against his beard. Tony snorted, taking him from Steve’s arms to hold close to his chest.
ya he could draw.”
, he reminded himself for the billionth time, closing the album.
“Thank you,” he said, thankful that the familiar phrase seemed to put Steve at ease.
“Oh my god, you two are perfect, I
He could feel Steve’s eyes on him, but he dared not look up, knowing that he would start to cry if he did. The chair creaked and an arm wrapped around his shoulders to draw him in close.
“It never stopped,” Tony answered truthfully, shame and guilt making his bottom lip quiver, “I didn’t—I didn’t want you to worry. You worry so much, and I can handle it—”
The finger inside him stilled and Tony nearly cried. He tried to move his hips again but Steve growled and slipped his finger out, much to Tony’s chagrin.
“Get nerd books too, J. Simple stuff about computers, math, robots—y’know, since we’re going whole hog here, might as well get some about art and history, too,” Tony added.
cute.”
it, I need you, it
“Are you hurt?” She asked Tony, going over to crouch next to him to look at Peter, “What about you? Did the big mean Alpha scare you?”
“But could he not change the laws? Or have another child?” Bruce pressed.
; Mother only kissed his cheek sometimes and held his hand, and Father never showed him any sorts of physical affection, so to have Steve hug him made Tony want to cry at how warm and safe he felt. Instead, he tucked himself up against Steve, and after tentatively wrapping his own arm around him, fell asleep for their nap time.
Sharp pain woke him up with a gasp. Tony held his breath to keep from screaming as he shifted his legs apart, only breathing out once the pain lessened. He groaned and forced himself to sit up, blinking tiredly in the light of the early dawn. It was no wonder Steve had wanted to take his time last night; if Tony had let him, he probably would have avoided the situation he found himself in, but the sex had distracted him like he wanted.
The worst, though, was Tony.
Steve hushed him and held him tight, allowing Tony to relax slightly.
“Wh--no! No deal. I want to stay in bed,” Tony complained with a giggle.
Tony took the elephant from Steve and put it between his belly and PJ’s face, grinning as the boy grumbled again.
In the past year, Steve had used up all his leave time to be with Tony in the wake of his parents’ deaths, being more of a comfort over one parent than the other. Tony had been a wreck, but in front of the public he was blank, the latter of which concerned him more. He’d stayed as long as he could before he was called back to the field, where he was willingly putting himself in harm's way because he and Bucky had allowed the government to experiment on them when they needed the money and Steve had been at his lowest.
“The Lieutenant says he is aware of the fault. We are a small, but mighty, group. There are only so many of us to give to the cause,” Thor explained, “We do not have the men for defense. He wants to know your solution.”
“Thank you,” Tony murmured, turning off the stove and taking the finished chicken off of the heat, “For everything. Being here. Avoiding your job just to—”
“I… do not know. I have not thought to ask,” Tony admitted, looking back up at Bucky, “Perhaps we can--”
wonderful. To me, to him…to the team. The world, even. I know—I know its difficult in terms of believing me when I say that, but you really are, Tony. You’re absolutely wonderful, caring, kind…in your own way, of course, but nevertheless, you are.”
“You can pick coffee or hot sauce. Only one acidic item this early in the morning.”
“Sweetheart?” Tony’s concerned voice cut through his thoughts, “Darling, you are shaking--come, let us retire for a while. I think the day has worn you out more than you are letting on.”
“Aye, squirt, you listenin’ in?” He called.
“It’s still disgusting and if you keep doing it, Natasha will skin you,” he said, still grinning despite the other’s pout.
“Thank you,” he whispered, reaching out a shaky hand.
Feeling heat climb up into his cheeks, Steve sat back, grinning sheepishly at the other’s positively predatory gaze.
Tony grunted in frustration and decided to take it out on the food Steve had brought for them. He quickly devoured his share, occasionally giving Peter a piece of strawberry to snack on. With food in his belly, he felt marginally better, but Peter had perked up considerably. The baby made grabby hands toward the tray, whining until he was giving another piece of fruit.
PJ hummed, but didn’t answer, choosing instead to lean out of Tony’s arms toward Steve. He made a soft noise, to which the Captain finally opened an eye, glancing up at the pouting child.
“So what will happen now? Will he get better?” He whispered.
“You do. It's perfect, I love it, I love
There was a small cheer—since most of the soccer team was in Tony’s class—but Tony himself was oddly silent. He gathered up his books and slunk out of the room, quickly stuffing everything into his locker before grabbing his lunchbox. Sneaking around Steve, he quickly dashed over to Natasha’s side, following her like a lost puppy down to the most unused bathrooms in the school. As soon as they were inside and Natasha had checked the stalls, Tony locked them in, going to plop himself down in front of her on the floor.
“Yeah. I know.”
,” He barked, keeping his fingers on PJ’s pulse, “And keep SHIELD medics on standby.”
“Because the other option is to kill us? You won’t do that. He’s too important to you, and you know that the instant you kill me, he’ll stop cooperating, not to mention you’ll have to deal with the other Avengers’ wrath.”
They all looked at Tony, who shook his head rapidly.
“Holy shit,” he breathed, tongue darting out to wet his bottom lip as he let his eyes drag over Steve’s body, “You look—oh God, you look so good, you’re not allowed to wear anything else ever again, I
It was quiet for a bit, the only sound being PJ’s occasional hum as he started to poke around Tony’s reactor through his shirt. Unfortunately, the silence gave Tony time to really think, which is why he tried to avoid silence at all times. After a bit, he shifted to face Steve, pretending to not notice PJ’s curious hand stroking over his goatee. Glancing over the blond’s mostly relaxed form, Tony let his mind wander.
he’s going to have nightmares.”
“She has a mansion all to herself, so I hope so,” Rhodey continued wryly.
“Octoberfest.”
“I didn’t say anything.”
“Could you take me down to see them?” He asked quietly.
“Okay. See you soon.”
“What should we do today, hm? Maybe once Bruce has rested we can go look at the lab, or we could go out and see the flowers, get you some nice air, yeah?” He whispered.
. I’m not going to hurt you, or touch you. Can you look up?”
His voice cracked and he bit his lip to hold back the swell of emotion that tightened his throat. Gods, what was
They both cracked up and high-fived, wheezing their giggles as the plane touched down and slowed in front of Tony’s private terminal.
“But?” Tony prompted, sensing a second half to the statement.
He cut off the sentence by pressing his lips to PJ’s temple, closing his eyes as he felt a tear slip down his cheek; one way or another, HYDRA was going to pay, and he as going to make sure it was with blood for hurting his little boy.
“Is he trying to steal you again?” Steve mumbled, “Tell him to talk like us. I want to know what he says.”
There in the middle of the next page was a colored polaroid, of two toddlers smushed together on the same small cot with familiar rabbit ears poking up between them.
“PJ? Where’s the kid?” he rasped, trying to push past Rhodey, “Where is he?”
bed. Bed, Steve.”
“I got mom’s powder, but it’s hot today, so you need to not go tackling people again,” She said, opening her makeup kit and setting it aside, “Ask Coach Richards to let you practice defense.”
woman. I don’t own her,” Bucky snorted, crouching down to PJ’s level, “Hi, squirt. I’m James. But you can call me Bucky.”
PJ perked up at that, tilting his head up from Tony’s shoulder. He flicked his gaze between Tony and Pepper, eventually settling his eyes on the ginger.
“Hey. Why not let Bucky take you back to bed, hm? You are supposed to be resting, not running around with the baby,” Tony tried, patting Steve’s knee, “Maybe a nap will help you feel better?”
; after just a few minutes, Tony found himself relaxing against Steve’s chest, humming softly when a hand carded itself through his hair.
Steve’s brow furrowed; the shame was easy to see in his clear eyes and he dropped his head, turning his gaze to the side. Tony sighed and made a decision, slipping his hand under Steve’s chin so he could gently turn his face back toward his own. He offered up a small smile, brushing his thumb over Steve’s jaw.
“Aren’t I supposed to say that?” Steve Rogers called, trudging over from the edge of the woods with the Hulk in tow.
“What is it?” Steve asked, squinting in the darkness.
Tony blinked.
“Hey, it’s done. He’s not taking any more,” He murmured quietly, rubbing PJ’s arm, “You can take your arm back, sweetheart.”
Tony rolled his eyes and nodded, ignoring the continuing bickering in favor of paying attention to Peter. The babe had quieted some, but he was still fussing and smacking a tiny hand against Tony’s chest, clearly upset at having his meal interrupted. He squeaked until Tony shifted him and moved him up, petting his soft downy hair as he latched on again.
“Yeah. Sorry. Just…thinking,” he murmured, “I’m gonna put this away and get my backpack. Meet you out front?”
“Thank you, darling. Now I’ll go kick their asses for you.”
Alpha, “Thank
Steve made that awkward I-really-don’t-want-to-do-this face, leaning down to gently pick PJ up by his armpits. Seeing that Steve legitimately
And yet, if all Tony was willing to give him right now was this, he was going to take it, treasure it, hold it in his memory as he waited out the days until he earned Tony’s trust and consent.
Tony sighed, but he knew Coulson was serious, so he nodded and let his eyes glaze over. He’d nearly mastered sleeping with his eyes open, but as he was drifting in and out, the class erupted into giggles, pulling Tony from his thoughts. He looked over at Steve, lips twitching into a smile to see how red his best friend’s face and ears were.
“I love you,” he said simply, immediately making Tony go into high alert.
have known. I was going to have an elaborate proposal and a big honeymoon, but instead, I fucking
“You say that like it’s an everyday occurrence.”
Tony blinked, then threw his arms around Steve’s neck, hugging him tightly. He ducked his head and nosed at Steve’s scent glands as he pushed all thoughts from his head. The pain was too much to bear.
The hologram wavered for a second before Bruce cut the connection, leaving Tony alone in the dark room. Unaware he’d been hyperventilating for most of the conversation, he backed up to a wall and slid down, resting on his haunches as he grounded himself. He took careful, slow breaths, counting the seconds like he was taught until his heart rate was somewhat near normal. Once he felt like he could stand without passing out, Tony slowly picked himself up and dusted off his clothes, straightening himself out with a grunt. He exited the room only to stop in his tracks, seeing Steve sitting in a waiting chair across the hall with PJ sitting in a chair next to him. The boy had the elephant clutched tightly to his chest, thumb in his mouth as he leaned his head on Steve’s arm. Quickly, he noticed Tony, eyes going wide before he slid out of the chair, awkwardly running over to look up at him.
“He keeps to himself?” Tony asked.
He knew that it was falling on deaf ears, but it felt good to get it off of his chest. He realized he had begun to cry while he was talking and reached up with his free hand to wipe the tears away, immediately growling again when he saw Steve try to reach for his face. The Alpha flinched and looked quite upset, pulling his hand away to cradle against his chest. Slowly, he slid out of the bed and went over to his own, picking up the tray to place down on Tony’s bed where he had previously laid. With a nod, Steve turned on his heel and walked out the bedroom door, gently shutting it behind himself.
Steve tilted his head and looked confused, but Tony knew better than to try and play the man’s games; he settled back down on the bed and readjusted Peter, determined to not slip up again and give the other the benefit of his noises. Peter nestled up into the crook of his neck and huffed, a sure sign that the babe was tired after his meal and was close to falling asleep. He was starting to feel the effects of the meal himself, and he let his eyes drift shut, but that made him concentrate on the warmth spreading over the sole of his foot, gently loosening up the tense muscle.
of you.”
The thought of Rhodey getting hurt because of him, because he had to run away to this man, broke Tony’s heart. He leaned into Steve and cried into his shirt, but a knock on the doorframe made him jump and gasp.
Gritting his teeth, Tony felt a growl rise in his throat, but he tamped it down in favor of holding PJ just a bit tighter.
“No can do,” Bucky said, shaking his head, “Natasha bullied the staff into telling us why they knew your blood type without asking and not so legally got a hold of your records. It’s just a safety precaution, Tony. Especially after last week.”
Rhodey laughed at that, smacking his hand on his knee.
“Ew, guys, not in front of the kid,” Sam called, grinning at Tony’s laugh.
He stood and leaned over the table to kiss Steve’s forehead and cheek, squeezing his shoulder before hurrying out of the room like a bat out of hell. Steve watched him go, worry making him nibble his lip as he turned back to the box in front of him. Curiosity won out and he lifted the lid, immediately comforted by the familiar musk of old books. He reached in and pulled out composition books, some yellowed with age and others slightly tattered with use, each labeled and dated. Confused, he chose the oldest of the books to pick up first.
“Sleep, Tony,” he said, pulling the covers up around them, “I’ll be here when you wake up. I promise.”
go to boot camp. Sure, the paperwork says we did, but—”
“I got this. You sit and figure out how the hell you’re going to tell Tony that you got shot but that you pulled the bullets out of yourself with dirty gloves in the middle of the battle,” he said, moving over to help Clint into the jet with Bucky, laying the archer down on the opposite bench.
Tony raised an eyebrow at him and headed off to their room, thinking it over. Time alone would be nice, but it was nearly midday and Peter needed to be fed. However, if Steve wanted him alone…
“Are you sure? You do not sound sure,” Tony grumbled.
Tony managed a brittle smile and leaned in to kiss him, hoping to distract the Alpha long enough for him to swallow his nerves. He knew there had to be some truth to all those Warlord rumors, even if Steve admitted that he did not like his role. Senseless violence made him feel sick, and even knowing that someone was sitting in a cell downstairs, possibly afraid for their life, made his stomach churn.
“We have him now. We’re not preventers, we’re Avengers. And I’m going to make sure Zola personally pays for everything he’s done to my son—
“My mama--my mother, the queen--she tried to stand up to Howard and got hurt, all because of
“Do you think—Bruce,” he tried, fumbling for the right words, “Should we—y’know, ask him? About what happened?”
“Nat’s idea.”
He glared at Steve’s beaming smile, gently laying Peter down on the Alpha’s bed so he could don the clothing. To be fair, the bra was not uncomfortable, but the band was tight enough that he could feel it whenever he moved. His cheeks had gone from warm to burning hot with embarrassment and he swallowed the urge to thank Steve for the clothing. Instead, he silently scooped Peter back up into his arms, smiling when the baby attempted to grab at his chest hair but had to settle for his shirt collar.
“Write it on the cardstock, Tony. And give me your phone.”
“Other people in the room,” Rhodey interrupted, smiling tiredly when Tony turned to gape at him, “Yeah. Hey, kid. Gave me quite a scare there, yeah?”
“If you do not fuck me right now, I will
“Fine, but he stays right here with me,” he said, having to bite back a smile as PJ’s hand slipped into his own, “Nothing funny. I’m more than my devilish good looks, ma’am.”
“Breathe, darling. I have you,” he whispered into Tony’s skin, “You feel so good, sweetheart, we can stop here--”
Bruce nodded, standing from his chair with a tiny grunt.
“Out of wedlock?” Thor asked, clearly confused.
“Sorry, peaches. Some of us don’t exactly heal as quickly as you do,” he said, sighing softly at the fresh aches that kept up that reminder.
“Tony! We are in
“It is.”
“Hey!” Steve complained, pouting at Tony’s giggles, “It’s not my fault. I just kind of had a growth spurt, and all that training went right to my upper body. Sam keeps calling me ‘Captain Small Ass’ because of it.”
“It’s okay, PJ,” he said quietly, trying to hide the concern on his face, “It’s okay. I’m here. It’s okay to cry.”

“Anyway. Before I was

and probably in a hell of a lot of pain.
! Look at your tits, dude, you are bimbo-level busty—”
Once his blurry vision settled, Tony smiled, relief washing over his body at the familiar man sitting next to his bed.
“It’s very possible, and despite HYDRA’s evil intentions, they do have good resources to accomplish the impossible. I’m afraid it’s accurate, Tony,” Natasha answered, looking at the young boy in the tube, “He’s a genetically modified child, built from splicing your DNA with Rogers’.”
, he told himself, distracted as they pulled out from the complex to await SHIELD’s arrival,
Thor’s voice died as he and Bruce led Clint away and into the castle, leaving Tony alone with the others. Steve looked at Natasha and nodded toward the prisoner, to which she happily took off of the horse and led them away by the rope. Barnes and the falconer--
Steve let out a soft giggle after reading that line, biting his tongue to keep from outright laughing. Even back then did Tony know that he was going to be more of an ‘ask for forgiveness, not permission’ person? Plus, he couldn’t help but agree with fictional Bucky—he did care a lot about Tony and wanted him to be safe, especially in battle.
Natasha nodded and strode over, plucking the bag off the man’s head. Immediately, Tony shrieked in delight and ran over, plopping himself side-saddle into the man’s lap and hugging him close one-armed.
Steve nodded once Thor translated, then suddenly looked over at him and waved his hand. Immediately, all of the people in the room dispersed, leaving him alone with Tony and Peter. Confused, Tony looked around, not understanding what Steve wanted, especially since he sent away the few people that allowed them to communicate effectively.
“Alright. I’ll stay put. But that means you should go join them, Colonel,” he decided, “Take Clint with you. He could use some exercise.”
“Hear, hear,” Tony said, pretending to raise a glass.
“Are you okay? Did he hurt you?” Rhodey asked seriously, eyeing up Steve.
“Yessir,” Tony replied, shifting on his feet, “Did you have to bring the limo?”
“…Yeah.”
start to freak, “He had a big day, yeah? Why don’t you sit—”
He turned to press a kiss into Peter’s wet hair and allowed himself another minute of soaking up the cuddles before moving onto the dreaded phase of putting Peter into clothing. However, when he stepped back out into the bedroom, he was surprised to find Steve awake with their bed made and two sets of clothing set out for them.
