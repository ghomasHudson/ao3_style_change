,” Tony said, investigating the cooling mechanisms. “We’ve sent robots out to Mars, the third planet in our solar system, and there are satellites that were sent out to explore the further planets. Maybe one day but…” He blinked, looking up at K’salk’adi. “Short answer is no.”
.” His breath hitched. “So what did I have to lose by trying?”
“Oh, I understand.” Tony nodded, glancing at the fabricators that were finishing up with his suit. “There’s just this one, tiny thing that I
, but Tony put his body through enough punishment that he wasn’t going to be any happier than Rhodey would be if he slept in that position.
“That’s good,” Tony said, pressing lips into Steve’s hair. He mouthed three words into his hair because it was probably too soon to actually say that, right?
Tony slowly slid the straw out of the mouth slit of his faceplate, relieved when it didn’t get stuck. It had happened a few times before when he did it too quickly. “Jarvis’s special recipe,” he answered warmly, giving Steve a smile that he couldn’t see. “I should probably ask you that. Eggnog any different from your time?”
“You were giving me everything.” Steve squeezed Tony’s hands reassuringly. “
Exhaling lowly, Tony had the lights turn off, using the light of his arc reactor to guide him. He didn’t hesitate to head over to the bed and slip under the blanket. He was promptly surprised at how warm the blanket was, belying its flimsy appearance.
He beat a hasty retreat before Steve could respond, cursing his newfound feelings to hell and back. He was not going to let them get in the way of his friendship with Steve. He was
“Doesn’t seem your style,” Steve agreed. “Not flashy enough for you.”
Not that Rhodey could…fit into Tony’s suits. He was just a bit bulkier than Tony in the shoulder area. (It was the thought that counted.)
“Fine.” Tony twirled on the chair, the holograph popping up in front of him with Fury’s face. “What can I do for you, Director?”
And yet here Tony had seen Steve nearly go sprawling over a shoe.
“You don’t bring me food,” Bruce pointed out.
Steve huffed, arms folded across his chest and eyes narrowed at Tony. “Now you’re just being ridiculous.”
The tower was quiet when he returned, the only lights that of the stylized A on the outside and the few offices where people were working late. Given it was Stark Industries, there were always overzealous people working late in hopes of squeezing out that last bit of brainpower.
As if Tony’s silent panicking was some kind of cue, Steve started stirring, breathing picking up and his eyes fluttering.
Normally Steve would love to see Tony tinker away at his suit, but now was not a good time. Not with the nerves still swimming through his stomach and making him decidedly queasy. “Tony.”
“You should buy a boy dinner before you take him to bed,” Tony managed, giving Steve a slow grin as he gently scratched the back of Steve’s head. It earned him a delightful shiver.
“That face doesn’t look happy.”
to explain what had just happened.
Rubbing a hand over his hair and patting it down, Tony sat up, eyes dropping to Steve’s side of the bed. He reached a hand up to where Steve had been breathing into his neck, eyes stinging.
Tony could already feel his joints complaining.
“Tony and Rogers,” Rhodey repeated. “Is there something going on between those two?”
Rhodey smirked. “So long as you’re aware of it.” He reached out for another piece of bacon, only to be thwarted when Tony jerked the plate away.
“Mm, Tony?”
less peeved than I am.”
“I have a lot of points; what point are you not getting?”
“You already are.” Tony was smiling helplessly, eyes wide and shining. “I…you’ll probably have to tell me again, you know.”
Namely, the definitely
His only response was a shrug. “I dunno. You hang around long enough you become one with the wallpaper?”
“False advertising,” Steve replied easily. “And a catchy song that if someone starts singing will lead to dish duty.”
anything!”
“I didn’t always,” Tony said, remembering one awful year when he’d been unable to attend because of being framed for murder.
“I don’t.”
“Yeeaahhh…” Rhodey sighed, setting his cup down. “Look, Tones…is there something you want to tell me?”
“One time too many! And how do you know it hasn’t happened before?”
. He had Tony’s pizza order down pat. Not only pizza, but Thai, Chinese, burgers,
Even if he used his abilities to pin Tony to the floor and kiss him senseless.
“I don’t know.” Barton set his cereal down on the table with a soft clunk. “Must have had a reason. Even if it’s one as stupid as ‘Rhodey wouldn’t want to know because he doesn’t like Steve since he can’t trust blond-haired blue-eyed sweet boys.’”
Steve pressed the eggnog into Tony’s hand, eyes scanning him. “Don’t distract me.”
Steve’s face remained blank despite the reddish tinge to his cheeks. “I see.”
Tony stared back, keeping his breathing carefully even. “We’re friends,” he answered honestly. “Not sure what else you’re expecting, Clint.”
Yet here they were, and Rhodey was hearing from Pepper that Tony got along well with his teammates. Although as Pepper was now on the west coast and away from Tony’s particular brand of chaos…and hadn’t
“You weren’t exactly quiet, sweetheart,” Tony said, smiling widely. “I especially liked the part where you were telling yourself to ‘buck up, buckaroo’ and swearing in Italian.”
“I get that reference and wish I didn’t,” Rogers muttered.
Tony tried to relax, but he was keenly aware of Steve’s breathing and the warmth of his body only inches away (the mattress was perhaps queen size if one felt generous). He could reach out and touch if he slid back only a little or moved his arm to the empty space between them. He could turn over right now and slide up against Steve’s body—
mean?
He also had something in his mouth and something warm breathing on his neck.
Rhodey leaned his hip against, watching the interchange with something like déjà vu. It was almost like seeing a mirror of the interactions he had with Tony but not quite. Their friendship had long since gotten into that stage where they could throw snide jabs at each other and not worry about hurting the other’s feelings.
“Oh, a joke. Didn’t know you had it in you.” Tony tapped his fingers on the desk, calling up another hologram with information JARVIS was still sneaking from S.H.I.E.L.D.’s servers. “You say ‘possible.’ Have you talked with them yet?”
Jarvis had made nonalcoholic eggnog this time. It tasted just as good as it always did, but with a slight difference that only he noticed (because he was an
Tony didn’t have to ask what Natasha meant. If they were able to fool their teammates, if they were able to fool
“Okay.” Steve sighed, rubbing his forehead. “We’ll let Fury know what’s going on, that we’ll have to be the first line of communication here. Let’s hope they don’t find out that we’re…” He shook his head.
Tony caught sight of the mistletoe above their heads and leaned in to press a kiss to the side of Steve’s jaw, smiling when he felt the heat of Steve’s flush against his mouth. “Did you ever get to try the eggnog?” he murmured, lips moving against Steve’s skin.
Seeing no help from him, Tony turned back to Thor. “Can you go back and tell them it was a mistake?”
A muscle tensed under Tony’s grip, but Steve didn’t otherwise react, looking forward as he walked down the sidewalk to Tony’s car. “Yes.” The word was clipped.
“I should be asking you that,” Steve said, eyes seeming to cover every inch of Tony’s frame (which was a ludicrous thought). “You’ve always been in the suit before.”
“I would have thrown it out the window but at that height it would have killed someone and I’d have been blamed instead of Meyer for writing that.”
A few hours and some more negotiating later, it was with a great deal of trepidation that Tony walked back to their shared bedroom, unable to resist shooting glances at Steve as if he could read the other’s mind. (But even Steve’s face was blank, and that didn’t reassure him at all.)
Steve was upset about something, but it was okay. He’d come around and talk to Tony. Hopefully.
“They are amiable,” Thor answered, which answered part of Steve’s question, “and their culture is different from Earth’s. I was only able to speak with them long enough to establish who they would prefer as their primary point of contact.”
wasn’t Iron Man, was he?
Steve stared at Tony for a few moments, clearly thinking of several arguments. But he didn’t use any of them, leaning in to rub his nose against Tony’s. “If that’s so…do you want to spend the night with me on our…” He glanced back at the “bed.” “Squishy blob that looks like a mattress?”
But then again…he was also Steve Rogers. And Steve Rogers was rather terrified.
It should be a joke.
Iron Man. It has always only been as his bodyguard before. Now everyone here knew who he was, if only because Molecule Man had gotten one up on them.
Tony nodded, fingers clenched too tightly around his ice cold coffee.
“Steve.” Tony smiled brightly at him, raising his glass in greeting. “Having fun?”
Tony’s brow furrowed. “Yes.” He looked at Rhodey as if he was the one being slow today. “I
The last stop on the tour was the engine room, which was more Tony’s element than the squishy sciences. He’d geeked out over the area of the control room K’salk’adi had shown him but
Tony snorted, then pulled Steve in for a kiss because it was about his turn to finally take the initiative and kiss him.
“Oh, sweetheart, you just want me under the mistletoe, don’t you?”
“We’re definitely friends,” Tony reassured him. “I just…” Rhodey had been reading too much into it, hadn’t he? “…wanted to make sure we were on the same page.”
time.”
“He’s not lying,” Natasha said after a moment. She raised her eyebrows in Tony’s direction before dropping them, face returning to its usual impassive expression. “But Clint’s right, Steve. You do tend to favor Tony.” A sly smirk started to dance at her lips. “It’s not like you bring lunch to any of
“Truly?” K’salk’adi seemed perturbed as best as Tony could read their body language. “I would not have thought so.”
“Are you a coffee thief now?” Tony asked, shooting Rhodey a look of utter betrayal. “Is that how far we’ve come? I take you into my home, feed you, clothe you, give you free upgrades, and this is how you repay me? By stealing my coffee?”
Steve hesitated a moment too long before responding, shaking his head. “No, it’s…” He was looking at Tony as if he’d never seen him before. “Can we…can we talk once we’re alone?”
? Didn’t he think that was something Rhodey would like to know? Would like the details of?
Steve snorted. “Is that all?”
Tony rubbed a hand over Steve’s back. “I can’t believe it was for that long.”
“I have something to tell you,” Steve said an hour and several private pep talks later, sitting down next to Tony in his workshop.
“Mal-whatever.” Fury gestured to the door. “If you’re not going to redeem me my twenty bucks you’re gone.”
Steve had listened and agreed that they needed to handle alien situations carefully and together.
Who…was in his arms? Snuggling up to Tony like he was five feet instead of over six?
On second thought, he probably shouldn’t have texted Pepper.
Tony and Rogers… They bantered, but there was a fond undercurrent to their words that Rhodey had really only heard Tony have with Pepper before.
“You sell yourself short, Anthony. I have seen you converse with other leaders here and with your first responders. You have a sly tongue and a quick mind, much like my brother.”
Tony’s disbelieving snort came out before he could stop it. “That’s hysterical, Thor. Pull the other one.”
“I don’t live here,” Rhodey pointed out.
– how could he
“Hey, honey…” Tony tightened his grip reassuringly. “Where’re you at?”
They eventually had to break apart for air. Tony felt flushed, heart racing in his chest and his breathing just as fast. His lips tingled, and he couldn’t help but look at Steve’s to see that they were flushed and slightly swollen.
Tony’s heart skipped a beat at the mention, and he wasn’t sure what expression his face was wearing.
“I think you lost the metaphor there.” Rhodey patted Tony on the shoulder. “Good talk, hm?” He finished his coffee in one big gulp, really needing to leave. “By the way, Pepper knows. She’s probably only a
“It has
.” Clint waved his hand dismissively. “So you say.” He turned to Tony. “What do
He dropped his eyes to Steve, who still looked rather nervous. He managed a smile, one that felt far too wobbly for his taste. “Merry Christmas, Steve.”
on the balcony, opening up a second later to let Rhodey out. It closed up behind him and powered off except for the soft blue glow of the arc reactor.
Thor had been the only person capable of speaking to the giant squid and he’d said something to piss it off. Maybe he’d brought up calamari?
Rhodey shook his head fondly, heading outside where Tony had parked the suit after doing the upgrades.
Clenching his fingers into the squishy pillow, Tony squeezed his eyes shut, forcing himself to focus only on his breathing and the feeling of the mattress. It worked for a few minutes until Steve shifted and the mattress shifted with him, keenly reminding Tony who he was lying with.
Tony set his glass down on the nearest flat surface, turning blindly into Steve to wrap his arms around him. “I’m glad you did.”
It wasn’t like Steve could have heard them talking about their relationship, right?
If he did that, there was no guarantee that Tony could keep his friendship with Steve. Absolutely none at all, and Tony wasn’t going to risk it for the slight chance that Steve felt the same way about Tony.
Rhodey would have lost any bet he laid down because Rogers was in
“Indeed!” A’gel’fush agreed. They seemed excited even if the translator kept their voice a dull monotone. “We have heard tales of your Earth. Is it true that you vanquished the Chitauri army with a single blow?”
. His brain told his heart to shut up and that it wasn’t possible.
fudge the math with?” He pointed the end of the screwdriver at Rhodey’s chest. “My suit. Cough it up.”
“Did you need something?”
Clint threw his hands up. “Aaaand I’m out of here! Bye, Mom; bye, Dad. Don’t go throwing any dishes around. Call me when the aliens invade.”
(“To be fair, Pepper, food cooked in flight is never very good.”
Steve showed no pity. “Then maybe you shouldn’t bet on us?”
Tony shrugged. “Hope you didn’t eat a lot of carbs?”
“What if things don’t stay the same?” Steve whispered.
But why would Steve go for him anyway?
Exhaling slowly, Rhodey noted with relief that the floor was free of any incriminating and embarrassing debris. There did appear to be a knife or two stuck in the ceiling, but that could be excused.
“Steve.” Tony was glad that his voice didn’t shake, and he gave his old friend a smile that was hopefully not too bright.
Glancing to the side, Rhodey saw the TV and that it had been switched off. They’d probably fallen asleep watching something – God knows what. Rhodey didn’t even
When Steve drew back, his eyes were bright and his cheeks flushed. “I…” He bit his lip, looking uncharacteristically shy. “The mistletoe was just an excuse before. Jan helped.”
They’d made up during their impromptu dimensional trip where Tony had been stark naked and Hela had a bone to pick with Thor, but that didn’t mean things were back to normal. If they were, then Tony wouldn’t be feeling so goddamn awkward around Steve. If they were, then Steve wouldn’t be looking at Tony with this unreadable expression that honestly scared the shit out of Tony.
“Don’t remind me.” Rhodey hated remembering Tony in that kind of state. It never got any easier no matter how many times he’d seen it happen. Granted, it had significantly decreased since Tony became Iron Man, but that just made the occasions when it did happen so much worse.
His suit landed with a rather loud
But each Malnussian only did the antenna touching with a very specific Malnussian and it was always in pairs.
“March of two-thousand eight, sir,” JARVIS answered when Rhodey didn’t have an immediate response.
“So what were you saying that I can’t just nod my way through this shit?” Barton took a soggy bite of cereal and made a face. “Ugh, soggy.”
Barton’s brow furrowed slightly and he shifted to face Rhodey, eyes intent. “Okay.”
Tony leaned back into his touch. “Better the circuits than you, Cap.”
Ugh, damn Rhodey. Couldn’t he have just kept quiet?
“I’m not leaving, all right?” Steve was still hugging him, his breath warm against Tony’s skin and setting his nerves afire. “If you need anything…I’ll be here.”
,” Tony had blurted out. He immediately tried to calm down. “Er, I mean, absolutely. I am definitely interested in learning more about your technology. But aren’t we needed elsewhere?” He’d gestured in the direction of K’salk’adi’s partner.
“It was,” K’salk’adi agreed, their antennas glowing softly. “How did you and Steve meet, Tony?”
“You’re the only one who does dishes by hand here, Steve,” Tony said. “Everyone else uses the dishwasher for what it’s there for.”
There must have been something in his tone that alerted Tony, since he stopped what he was doing to look up at him in concern. After a moment, Tony pulled his hands out and dropped the fine tools he had been working with, turning to face Steve fully. “What is it?”
time, Rogers!”
It would be easier if they just went to sleep and tackled the problem again in the morning but what did Rhodey know. Apparently nothing according to Tony. Sure, he’d graduated MIT and gotten an awesome degree and job out of it, but he wasn’t anywhere near as neurotic as some
The bed.
And from how Steve curled in close, it was a good bet that was all Steve wanted as well.
The team hadn’t always been so big. Once it had just been Jan, Hank, Thor, Steve, and him. The five founding Avengers.
“I tried to move on.” Steve rested his chin on Tony’s shoulder. “Didn’t really work as well as it should have since I was still hung up on you. It wasn’t fair to Sharon.”

He stares at the iron bars that go across his cell horizontally past the glass door locking him inside. The cuffs specially designed for him encasing his hands midway up his forearms that cut off his powers so that he couldn't break free, and the electric collar around his neck that hummed so softly, waiting to be activated. Blood trickled down his head from the countless hits he took from the back end of guns, coupled with the bullet holes that haven't healed due to the loss of his powers, his lips cracking and dry, parched from lack of water, and the insatiable gurgling of his stomach from being so hungry. They didn't feed him properly, they didn't give him the water he needed, they just kept hurting him, over and over again, hoping he'd crack. But he never did. He did not shout, nor scream, nor cry, as they kept beating him with their weapons when they shot him in his shoulders, his legs, and even when they kept shocking him with the collar around his neck just for fun to hear him scream out in agony.
"Perfect." He heads on over towards the center of the raft where the main entrance to the top is closed, as he already knew, and from there he heads right just as instructed by his AI and barely just sees the small hatch Friday was talking about. He smirks under his helmet and grabs onto the little underside opening, popping the hatch up and moving his foot onto the first step of the ladder. "Any guards?" He asks before he even begins to descend.
Tony, the man I love."
"Alright, so fill us in and then we'll fill you in on what you missed in the past two hours," Clint spoke, sitting next to him, getting comfortable.
"So, this is what these bastards really look like?" Fury said. It took some willpower from Tony to cast his eyes at the man standing in the doorway, agents coming over to look at the commotion in the room. "Alright, don't act like you haven't seen a dead extraterrestrial body before. Pick it up and bring it to the science lab." He watched as the agents carried the dead creature out of the room, the sound of Fury's boots loud in his ear as he, too, walked away.
"Don't say that."
"I love you, t-too, T-Tony." He said back, just as quietly. Once more he leans in, brushing their noses together and slowly attaching his lips to his lovers. He walked up the stairs slowly, careful not to jostle the brunette around or to lose his footing.
To the genius, he will still love Steve through all of this, because he was still the same blonde, muscular, down-to-earth, generous and just overall great guy that he's come to love. It doesn't matter if he can't talk, it doesn't matter if he can't see, and it will
"D-do y-you h-hate m-me?" He asked, sadly.
Loneliness in itself is a weird word, or rather, it is a weird term, in a different sense. Loneliness means sadness because one has no friends or company, but that can't be, right? He did have friends, and he had company, hell, he practically lived in a tower nestling a bunch of superheroes. They ate breakfast together on occasions, the same with dinner, and all while stopping crime whenever it reared its ugly head. So why did he feel so alone?
"He just told us it was a reconnaissance mission," Steve said, "said there were signs of Hydra activity here and to go explore. He didn't tell us it was classified or anything."
"I'm sorry."
"I swear to God, these things are going to pay for what they did to him. He didn't deserve this." Steve really didn't deserve this. Despite what Bruce has told him, Tony still thinks that he is the one who deserves to be where Steve is. Steve has always been a kind-hearted soul who would never turn his back from anyone. The guy who would gladly risk his life for someone else, the guy who Tony would do anything for to see him happy, didn't deserve to be reduced to this.
"What was that for?" Steve asked, quietly.
"B-Baby," he whispered, making Tony look at him through his tear-filled eyes. "What did he d-do?" With an intense shudder of breath, the genius slowly removed his hands from under his armpits, and not only was he filled with rage at the sight he saw, but he was a little nauseous as well.
"Hey, Dr. Banner." He said softly.
"I'm just kidding. I'm always free for you, what did you have in mind? Do I need to get dressed?" The soldier shook his head and dipped his head once more, stealing another sweet, chaste kiss from the brunette.
"Please be alive." He whispered to himself. He rushed over to the left side of the jet, grabbing onto the tear and pulling it apart, making it big enough for him to fit through. The inside didn't look any better than the outside. Seats were thrown discarded, unhinged from where they were bolted down, wires hanging from the roof, crackling and sparking with electricity currents, and glass practically covered the floor. He took a gander at the cockpit, and he nearly jumped out of his skin.
"Huh!? What?" He answered.
"You can go now, Tony."
"I think you should tell Steve," Wanda suggested. He raised his eyebrows at her in confusion.
Warnings: This chapter contains smut. That's just basically it, smut. As for why I put smut in this chapter, well there's just a deeper meaning to it than most people would think, especially in this chapter. No idea why I'm continuing this, lol. Anyways, smut.
"Don't," Tony said softly, a sad smile on his face, "don't ever apologize for that. What happened to you was unfair, and I completely understand how you feel. I will and would
To him, it was a big surprise, really. It's been a few months since the Loki incident, and in those few months of staying up all night in the lab, there was always this soft spot he had for the blonde. Whether he chose to act on them, or ignore them, was entirely up to him. He didn't wanna jeopardize whatever he and Steve were, considering that he most likely wasn't ready to act on whatever he was feeling after the whole Pepper fiasco, but at the very least he could keep this warmth to himself for the time being. Just being friends with Steve was enough.
"Mr. Stark, we need you to come down to S.H.I.E.L.D. HQ right away." Fury's voice boomed. He looked behind him and saw Steve stir slightly.
"I lost control of my powers, and I ended up killing everyone inside. It was in the lowest part of the bunker you were in, and from there I escaped. I ran away back to Sokovia and wanted to start a new life."
He smiled at the AI's courtesy, Steve always appreciated how courteous Tony's AI was despite his creator being the complete opposite. He sighed and got up from his bed, his legs wobbly putting him off-balanced just a bit.
He had a hopeful look in his eyes, slight fear showing at the mere thought that he would be rejected due to his situation. But he felt better when the soldier stood up and started to enter the hospital bed, the genius moving over slightly to give him enough room. He wrapped an arm around the smaller male and looked at him lovingly.
"Once we get inside that building, turn every disgusting alien creature you see into ash. Got it, Thor?" Tony spoke, looking at the Asgardian flying next to him.
"Oh, of course. Why wouldn't I be? It's not like the asshole behind the door kidnapped my boyfriend or anything." Tony sassed. Fury raised an eyebrow at him, causing the genius to roll his eyes. "Long story, can you just let me in?" Fury looked at him for a few more minutes before he turned around, leading them down the hallway, past the other occupied cell doors until they turned a corner and came face to face with the cell door that held the captive alien. Fury inputted the pin on the lock pad, let the scanner scan his eye, and opened the door, holding it open for Tony.
And during those three weeks, Tony was Steve's eyes. Always looking out for him when they walked down the stairs together, making sure the soldier didn't trip, helping him with his drawings by looking at the paper while he was sketching, and helping to correct the placement of his hands when they veered off and threatened to ruin his drawing. They were a well-oiled machine, perfect together in all the right ways and where it mattered most.
"He went alone to keep you safe, Captain. He did not want to risk you getting captured again, and he felt that your recovery was more important than what he wanted to do."
Even if Tony betrayed him by calling him under false presumptions; which most would say he probably deserved since he, in a
"I love you, too, Tony," Steve whispered back, kissing the side of Tony's head. And he, too, smiled at the fact that Steve had chosen him, loved him for who he was and not what he possessed; didn't care how wealthy he was, or how intelligent he was, because to Steve he was just a human who deserved to be loved like everybody else.
that this would put a damper, or at least, make things awkward between them.
Maybe there was something different he could have done, he didn't stop to think about that possibility for a second, but he was running out of time. Actually, there was no time to simply put a pause to everything and hit rewind, because that only happens in movies, and while his life certainly seemed to play out that way, that's not what it felt like to him.
"Well you'd think with all my money and my smarts people would want to be my friend. Actually, it's pretty funny, because even today people only like me for my superior intellect and my money, but getting back to the topic at hand," he cleared his throat and placed his now empty plate on the nightstand next to the mug before continuing, "I was the smallest kid in my class, and people took advantage of that. I spent a lot of my days being pushed around, shoved into lockers, people really despised me for being smart. Hell, even the teachers did because I would always correct them when they said something stupid."
"Yes." He felt a prickling sensation behind his eyeballs, the faint feeling of tears staining his cheeks as they spilled forth from his tear ducts. He rubbed them away with the back of his hand, but more little water droplets took their place. He tried to control his emotions, he hated crying because it always made him feel weak. He hated the feeling of being weak, he was supposed to be strong in situations like this, he was supposed to be made of iron, he wasn't supposed to break down this easily. "If I had just gone on that mission, if I had just followed them then I could have done something. It's all my fault."
let what happened to me control my love for you." He could see a small fire of determination come to life in Steve's eyes as he spoke. "I want you to touch me, I want you to hold my hand, I want you to run your hand up and down my thigh and make me shiver, I want you to kiss my neck and whisper sweet things in my ear, I want all of that Tony. I know it sounds crazy, and I'm traumatized, but all I see is you. All I see is
"Fury, open the fucking door, now!" He yelled.
"Just, give me a quick run down and tell me what happened."
"It-its ok-kay," Steve responded, rubbing his thumb along the backside of Tony's hand. The genius shook his head, willing himself to look into the tearful blue eyes of the man he loved once more.
It was a long shot and Tony knew that, but it was a shot he was willing to take. He was willing to do whatever it took to get Steve back to normal, even if that meant locking himself in his lab and feeling this overwhelming pain in his heart every time Steve flinched from him. If they could somehow help Steve, then the pain would be worth it in the end. It was the only thing Tony could think of to try to make Steve happy again.
"Hey, it's gonna be ok. She's just gonna have a look, see what's in your head, no big deal." He moved closer to me, like a predator stalking its prey before it finally seized the perfect opportunity and pounced. I shrunk a little as he got close to me, his hot breath against my ear as he spoke. "I wanna see all the little things that you keep locked away in that pretty head of yours. I wanna see what you're so scared of."
There was a slightly defensive note in Steve’s voice and Tony hastily tried to assure him.
“Nightmare?” Tony asked carefully.
“Call Bruce.”
Tony parked the car in front of the hall and they both walked the few steps to the main entrance, every step accompanied by the soft clicks of the Iron Man armor assembling around him. As soon as the gauntlets were on his hands he raised them defensively, and Steve adjusted his shield from protecting them both to his standard ‘prepare for combat’ position. He could see Steve checking the perimeters but apparently found nothing.
“That’s a coincidence.”
"Yes, of course."
“Unless you want Mr. Stark to look over these codes, I would suggest you accept Mr. Krats explanation.”
By now they were pressed flush against each other. Steve’s hand had found a way under Tony’s shirt, delighted at meeting skin and imitating the movements Tony’s hand initiated under his shirt. When Tony started kneading his ass his moan was swallowed eagerly by Tony’s hungry mouth and without thinking about it, Steve grabbed the other man to place him on his workbench. Tony immediately opened his legs and Steve moved into the space grinding his crotch against Tony’s. He was happy to find his own erection mirrored, the first contact of their clothed cocks sending sparks of heat and pleasure through him.
“Yes, I’d like that.”
Again warning for the grief of a death child.
“Don’t panic,” Natasha Romanov advised. It didn’t help.
Steve risked a glance and saw the armor in the middle of the hall, dodging several tentacles and trying to fight back with his repulsor blasts. They didn’t seem to have much of an effect, but luckily the same could be said about the bullets.
“No, wait, give her time.”
Again this chapter deals with the death of child, this time grieving it.
“Where is Papa?”
“I do.” In an instant Steve was at her side and took her hand. “I do.” Gently he pulled her towards him, moving his hand soothingly over her back.
Steve stared at the body, at the lifeless form and it took him a while to realize that he was not frozen in place, that he was in fact staring at a video clip that was frozen until he wasn’t. Until brown eyes moved in his line of sight, worried and so deep that he felt drowning in them. Slowly he registered Tony’s hands on his face; then his words, calling out for him.
She nodded again.
Finally the lift was up. She opened the door and for a moment it felt like a déjà vu. In front of her, Tony Stark and Captain Rogers apparently very enthusiastically confirmed that they were still alive. And they hadn’t noticed her yet. A passionate sound threw her out of her reverie and she hastily took the blocks away that held the door open, watching them closing. Zola leant on the panel next to them and began sliding down the wall until she sat on the floor.
“What does it look like?” She asked and made absolutely no effort to hide the rolling of her eyes.
Tony acknowledged this point with a slight nod, before he explained. “It also means that we have another point of investigation. If someone is framing Natasha by leaking secrets to the internet, there has to be a digital trail we can follow.”
“Steve Rogers said he would tell them. I mean it’s his news.”
“Yes, that’s the plan. Do you have a better idea?”
“Just knock on his door and give them to him,” Zola advised with a hint of impatience.
"Yeah, I know I've met her."
“Am I?”
“Okay, let’s go.”
Steve looked at the screens in this workshop, looked at the projects on the desks, he could even identify some of those things, looked back to Tony.
“Take your time,” Jamie answered dreamily, “I’m admiring the view.”
“Sir, Captain Rogers, this might interest you,” the AI stated before the radio was turned on.
“It’s not your fault,” Tony immediately said.
“Yeees.” If Steve was any judge, Peter was not convinced.
“Want to talk about it?”
“So how do you like my surprise?,” Tacle asked and started firing.
“So maybe both? Personal revenge and planning something big. Might have the additional effect that I would feel even more guilty and useless when I were not there to help.”
“Or the adoring gazes.” He added.
“Getting a second opinion?” Steve lifted his gaze to Tony who stood behind Peter, basically hovering.
"Who is in it?" He still sounded amused, but there was a hint of steel in his voice that made it clear why he was leader of the Avengers.
“What about you?” Steve murmured.
“Sir, Ms. Potts for Mr. Edward Krats.”
"There is a bet?" Rogers asked. He sounded amused.
Tony watched fascinated as Steve’s blushed.
A few weeks later she saw Stark and Rogers leaving Stark's office. Rogers had one arm around Stark's  waist and she could see them smile happily at each other. She looked after them until they disappeared behind the closing lift doors. She was about to turn back to her office, when a hand pushed between the closing doors and Tony Stark looked out again.
Zola resisted the temptation to bang her head against her desk.
Steve was balancing on the edge of roof having grabbed the hook of one of the cranes. A shot to his feet stopped him and he turned. Tacle stood in front of him, heavily breathing but the weapon in his hand was pointed steadily at Steve.
“I still let it run through Friday, maybe she can find something. But I do think that Marisa’s Facebook page could prove useful. Although I still wonder …?”
“Yes, you have to come, Daddy. How is Papa going to be healthy again?” Peter had lifted his head and looked at Tony.
“Whom should I tell?”
“So you caught up on pop culture. I like you priorities, Cap,” Tony grinned.
“Do you want to wait?” He asked hoarsely and could feel the moment disappearing. Relief and disappointment battled for a moment, but in the end he managed to shove every idea about the man in front of him back where they belonged.
“Yes … No … I don’t know.”
And stopped petrified in the door, unable to stare at anything than the scene on the couch.
“Like a relationship?”, he nevertheless clarified.
“Now we try to find this guy. I have not much hope for the portrait – no offense – …” – “None taken.” – “… but he looks so average that even I have the feeling I’ve met him before.”
“What did I do to you?”
“Then those monsters attacked. And I watched the TV because what else could I do. But when I saw it, when I saw the baby and I knew it was Cullen, I knew it. How could I not recognize my baby? I didn’t know what to do, I wanted to hide but what about my Cullen?”
“Okay, I call Ori.”
Tony stared at him with big eyes.
He was now by the most difficult part where he could be seen from the other battle, but decided to risk it since Tony had until now managed to keep the battle down. The first few feet were easy, but then he sensed that Tacle had noticed him. He had his shield in his hand, but before Tacle could reach him Iron Man swept in, colliding with the tentacles grabbing for Steve and Steve practically started to sprint up the stairs, trying to get out of reach as far as possible.
“What has happened?” Steve asked.
Steve was not surprised when the video footage appeared. On the screen he could clearly identify Tacle as the one approaching Clint.
Steve smiled. “I’m feeling much better.” And he did. No headache, no freezing. And his voice was almost back to normal. Tony touched his forehead.
There was a small chance that Jamie would accept this.
“Let’s see. Friday can you find me anything about my friend Mr. Tacle here. Social media, public appearances, especially anything to do with the Avengers.”
“The touching.”
“If two medical authorities recommend snuggles …” Steve got himself upright and let Tony slip behind him so that he could lean on him. It was their standard sitting arrangement when they took one lazy afternoon.
“Yes, that’s correct,” Tony answered with a sense of unease.
"I should have waited a moment longer," she offered.
“I see you found out my secret. So the question remains, what can I do for you?”
“I get my shield.” Steve was already walking out of the door.
It wasn't her first aftermath after the Avengers had to fight some weird-ass baddie in New York, but it was still strange to return to her office in Avengers Tower. The building obviously had taken some hits, but it still was structurally sound. And on her floor there were just little signs that something had happened - one shattered window, some paper lying around. Of course the view outside was another story. Zola could see destruction and burn marks, but since there had been no casualties she tended to consider them just cosmetic damage.
“You are a genius and I’m an idiot,” he declared when he almost ran out of the bedroom grabbing his trousers on the way out, leaving Steve lying in the bed wondering what the hell had happened. Steve was pretty sure that this declaration had nothing to do with their previous discussion which was confirmed by Tony’s next words.
Jamie looked at her inquiringly then sat down in her visitor chair.
“I don’t want to know, do I?” Steve asked warily.
“We can go something fancy the next round,” Tony growled and Steve liked the sound of it, the promise that this was something more than a fling in the workshop. He slid his fingers in Tony’s pants and pushed them down. For a moment he let his fingertips run along the veins, before he curled his hand around Tony’s cock.
“Still interesting timing.”
“Also yes to the whole relationship thing.”
“So, I wanna hear all the details.”
When he was stable, they both looked down where Tacle’s body lay. The body a strange arrangement of limbs, the remaining tentacle lying a few feet apart. There was practically no chance that Tacle was alive, but when Tony lowered them to the ground, he still checked the pulse.
“Just a cold. What do you say: We will prepare him some tea and chicken soup, and he will be all better very, very soon.”
“It’s worth a shot,” Tony tried to convince her. “He was an artist before the whole fighting Hitler stunt.”
“Can you distract him, Iron Man? I try to get to the hostages.”
Steve took a deep breath. “Letters that claimed if I wouldn’t step down from the Avengers I would regret it. I didn’t took them seriously at first, but after …,” he faltered, “well, after this incident,” he gestured to the screen, “I received another letter, saying ‘I told you so’ that it wasn’t over.”
"Just a moment," she shouted down before she started working on the panel to override the electronic control system. It didn't take her very long - Stark loved clean codes and panels - to get the lift working again. Since she couldn't see what was wrong with it, she opted to get it up in slow motion, making sure that none of the sensors showed any indication of trouble.
“Neither do I,” Steve admitted, “but I’m sure that we have to stop him. The sooner the better.”
“How did you find me?,” Steve asked as soon as they were on their way.
“Yes, yes, I did. He promised me the best funeral money could buy, everything for Cullen I could wish for.”
“He is on a lunch date, then I can’t interrupt them.” Miller stared at her with a shocked expression.
Tony started to protest but Bruce just threw him a look and Tony disappeared.
“Do you know where Mr. Stark’s assistant is?”
“You could have written a letter,” Steve only half joked.
“Edward Krats speaking. How are you, Ms. Potts?”
“Oh, I’m sorry, Ms. Potts. I was just collecting my thoughts,” Tony returned to conversation smoothly, “so, gentlemen, what are your questions?”
“That’s the plan, really?” Tony threw an incredulous look in Steve’s direction.
"Natasha told me that they are your favorites."
“You really are a hero, aren’t you?”
Disbelief colored Jamie’s face.
“And afterwards they broke up. Maybe she was even more of a casual fan.”
“Well, if this wasn’t Steve Rogers, then somebody should introduce me to his Doppelganger.”
Rhys slumped down on the sofa, grabbing a blue stuffed animal, and Tony took the chair in front of her. Steve took the pile of clothes from the remaining chair and also sat down, not wanting to look threatening. At the cemetery Rhys had given an air of confidence but here, in her own home she just looked devastated and kind of empty.
“I don’t want to talk about it.”
"Barton?"
“At first I refused to listen to him, blocked him, but he was persistent. And then Cullen was gone,” she looked at Steve with tearful eyes, pain clearly written in the lines around her mouth, “and the mortician was so cold and he barely looked at Cullen and he would offer me nothing more than a glorified shoe box. And I couldn’t do this. I couldn’t let my baby be buried in something like that.” Her tone was pleading now.
“I know, I know. Believe me I know. For some reason she can’t see the sexual tension between the two.”
“Because he asked me not to since he knew you were working on a time-critical experiment, and I was monitoring his vital signs. It is basically just a cold, Sir.”
She looked at it as if she had never seen it before and then back to her boss.
“I take 50 on the 25
“It’s not that bad, you should try it sometimes.”
Steve found himself curious what Tony would and could do with a house like this, but this was not a social call and their relationship never developed far beyond a comradeship between fellow Avengers. A fact that he had regretted several times since Tony had left the Avengers. He had been right though, he had missed him and on more levels that he expected.
“What do you want?”
“Nothing. What could I do? He had already lied, I … I was afraid what he would do. So I waited.”
“Why isn’t the serum working? Why didn’t you call me?” Tony demanded.
“Can’t be that renowned if they resort to telediagnosis,” Tony murmured as he swung his hammer enthusiastically on the piece of metal in front of him, drowning out the reporter with steady blows. For some reason watching the news lately made him aggressive and he wasn’t even watching FOX. His self-therapy was interrupted by Friday.
“I always knew where you were. Just hadn’t any means of contacting you in a cabin in the woods.”
“Because in my experience those who scream the loudest about something usually have something to hide. Until now I’m not exactly wrong,” he smiled wryly, “but unfortunately nothing what helps us.”
Steve was merely thankful for Tammy’s help in this regard that he hadn’t minded her endless chatter. He had it minded even less when he had seen how much she had cared for Marisa Rhys who was now working as her assistant. Being wronged by the same guy apparently was enough of a bond. Even Natasha had been nice to Tammy.
“How do you know that they are not a couple?”
“Afraid you’d lose?”
“So what do we do now?”
Steve smiled as his son started his careful examination. Dutifully he opened his mouth and took deep breaths when told so. His heart swelled when he watched Peter scrunching his nose in concentration while he listened to Steve’s heartbeat with his tiny stethoscope.
“Certainly, Sir,” the AI replied before one of the larger screens was filled with pictures and articles. They both stepped closer, looking through the material. Some of them were dismissed immediately; some of the articles received at least some screening. But it was Steve who found something. A picture of him and this guy with a woman on the other side. He enlarged it to show it to Tony. Tony moved the rest of the material to the side.
“Go back to sleep.”
“Why?”
Her outburst seemed to surprise him.
Steve looked at him searchingly. “You mean it?”
Tony had been right, it only took a few strokes for him to spill but Steve continued until Tony stopped him. Wondering what to do with his hand and the remains of Tony’s orgasm he lifted it looking for some piece of cloth or even his shirt to wipe his hand clean, but then he remembered the taste of Tony’s skin and some part of him needed to know if every part of Tony tasted this good.
Epilogue
But the worst part were the three figures hanging above Tacle from the ceiling. Tony’s heart clenched as he recognized Pepper and it took him a moment to identify the other two women: Marisa Rhys and Tammy Lynn Richardson.
“And the newspapers said you were kinky,” Steve could almost hear Clint applauding him for this statement.
“Well, I’m not sure we should sell this. It’s based on the Ultron routines and killing StarkPhones and StarkPads is the last what the world needs.”
“Why are you awake anyway?”
Zola looked up when there was a knock on her door. Kevin Miller stood in front of her, waving some documents at her.
Green eyes met his and he could see tears simmering, barely held back.
“You want me to hack into the personal data of the members of the press, the congress or the military. You wouldn’t believe how disappointed I’m right now,” Tony laughed.
“Oh yes, I do!” Tony’s optimism was confirmed a moment later when Friday announced an address in an industrial sector just outside the city.
“I’m not sure if I even own a pen. Besides letters can be opened.”
“How’s that working for you?”
The first connection of their lips was tentative as if they were both trying to decide whether or not this was the right angle, but Steve used the hand on Tony’s face to direct him in the right direction but maybe his hand just followed Tony’s movement anyway. Their next kiss was much more secure, just the right pressure, a not so careful nibbling until Tony involved a little tongue and Steve opened his mouth and the kiss turned heated.
“Maybe. It’s worth a shot.” Tony looked unconvinced.
“You know that you’re not looking out of the window?” She asked, starting to grab her things and put on her coat.
“Cap, Cap, come on, Steve, Cap, it wasn’t your fault. Cap, look at me, Steve, Steve, please, Steve.”
“I don’t understand why you are so surprised. You are the one that insisted that they were in love with each other.”
“It’s still my fault.”
The line went dead and they both looked at each other. Under other circumstances this might have been comical, but at the moment they didn’t feel like laughter.
"Would you be interested in this desk?" He pointed to the empty one in front of his office.
He flicked his hand and the picture turned, he rewound the footage, followed the path of the pram until they got a glimpse in it and Steve had to close his eyes for a moment, while Tony pointed to the child, “no discernable breath pattern and I doubt a baby could sleep through the noise of a battle,” he moved the footage forward, “it doesn’t wake up when you hit the pram with the shield”, he moved it even further until the child was floating in the air and then maximized it and pointed to some dark spots on the baby’s body, “I’m not a medical man but I wonder of those dark spots came from the body lying somewhere for some time. Also look how there is no movement in the body itself. It’s almost like a doll. Rigor mortis.”
“You have thought a lot about this.”
“So, what do you say, Dr. Peter? Am I going to be alright?”
“Very well, Sir.”
“He said the only thing left for me to do was giving Cullen a lovely farewell with flowers and a marble angel on his tombstone. But …,” she pointed helplessly at the rest of her flat, “I couldn’t afford that. I can barely pay for this hole.” She bit in her lip.
“I just wanted to bring you these.“ She awkwardly raised the papers. “From Kevin Miller,” she added as an explanation.
The swell of noise indicated that some of SI’s directors tried to contradict her, but Pepper pulled another ace out her sleeve.
“Hey, Petey-pie. Did you sleep well?”
The sudden blast of repulsors was the most beautiful sound he had ever heard and the only warning he got before the weight dragging him down disappeared. A moment later a metal clad hand wrapped itself around his middle and steadied him while he tried to step on Iron Man’s shoes.
“Really, you are surprised?” Mr. Tacle feigned surprise. “If you are that slow maybe I’ve been invested in the wrong firm for the whole time, Mr. Krats.” He paused meaningfully. “Or should I better say, Mr. Stark.”
“Come on, tell me while we are still young and beautiful.”
“Fast?”
“As you can see Clint is not for subtlety,” Romanov stated. “But more important, there is a betting pool. If you want to join?”
Steve let his head drop back on the bed for a moment, allowing himself a small happy smile, before he decided to follow Tony and get a more thorough explanation. On the relationship thing or on Tony’s apparent flash of inspiration. And maybe he could get a few kisses. He would like that. He made a stop in the bathroom and in his guestroom to get clean clothes before he went down to the workshop where Tony was already rapidly typing and muttering to Friday.
“You are lucky you are sick,” Tony grumbled but continued to caress Steve.
“Stop thinking,” came the complaint from the otherwise unmoving man.
It took only a few seconds before another flood of pictures and information was spread out on the screen.
“Already trying here. But there is not much cover for you up there, Cap.”
She suppressed her sigh. He wasn’t the first to ask for him and at the moment it looked as if a sign ‘Morgan is gone, there is no replacement’ might actually be a good idea.
Tony smiled lazily at Steve, glad the other man was smiling back, glad the tension in his body had disappeared somewhat. Their smiles faded but their gazes lingered, and something almost forgotten came out from the hidden corner of his mind. A longing that he had never voiced, never acknowledged, but knew was there. Tony licked his lips and swallowed as he saw Steve breaking eye contact to watch the movement. Tension grew, tension that Tony was desperate to break. And he managed to swallow the sudden dryness in his throat.
"Well, you are capable of opening up a lift, discretion, and quick thinking." He smirked, ignoring Rogers' embarrassed sound. "I think you might survive me a little longer than most of the other candidates."
Steve sighed and rubbed his hand over his face.
Steve risked stepping up close to Tony and kissing him between his shoulders. He was delighted when Tony awarded him with a pat on his head and kissed Tony’s hair before he leant against the desk Tony was working on, close but not touching him.
“There is nothing wrong with Brooklyn.”
“Sorry,” Steve lifted his head up and pressed a kiss in the mess of dark curls he could reach.
“And me,” Steve conceded.
“No, you didn’t. It wasn’t your fault,” Steve tried to calm her down, but the sobs just grew stronger.
“I have thought about what you said, some of it, okay. And it seems that you are right. Our friend Mr. Tentacle has some influence. A FBI investigation and the media is there to report live? Another lazy coincidence.”
“No, I’m … I’m not playing.”
And so Steve stood up and took the two and a half steps until he was right into Tony’s space. He put one hand on Tony’s hip, the other hand caressing Tony’s jaw, tracing the lines of Tony’s beard. Tony’s reaction consisted of putting his arm on Steve’s chest and raising an eyebrow as if asking ‘really?’. But he only stopped talking when their mouths were just inches apart.
Upon his first lick Tony groaned: “God, you are a menace.”
,” Jamie stated. Wilson smiled and tapped away.
“It’s just … it’s you following the trail and I’m … I’m useless. I’d prefer to do something. Not just sit and wait.”
One year later
“Better,” Steve told him.
“Jarvis, turn up the heat please,” he croaked and was grateful for Tony’s efficiency in all of his tech. Almost immediately he could feel a stream of warm air ghosting over his skin. God, he hated being sick. Since the serum him being sick usually meant some battle wound, but he hadn’t felt so weak in years. More than seven decades actually. He wanted to be angry at Thor for infecting him with his Asgardian flu but couldn’t bring up the energy. Instead, he just curled himself up and tried to go back to sleep.
Tacle’s mention of Obie put a few more puzzle pieces into place and he shot a look at Steve. It was met with a slight worry and so much warmth, that he couldn’t help but smile. Steve’s answering smile was something he would always cherish.
"That's really not necessary."
“Yes, and there was nothing suggesting that they are a couple.”
“I received letters,” he started.
“No!” Jamie almost shouted and jumped out of the chair.
“Well, as far as I know, Ultron developed his murderous tendencies quite soon after he was created. Since we are still alive, I’d say those phones are safe. And since the phones for the public will have a downgraded version of this technology I assume humanity must find other ways to kill itself.”
“Why?”
“I need to examine you,” Peter declared seriously.
He settled on a nearby bench, keeping his gaze on Steve and their surroundings, but it was still early and not many people were at the graveyard. Also their corner was pretty secluded. It left him with more time to watch and worry about Steve. Tony knew guilt intimately, knew that Pepper and Rhodey tried to talk him out of it, argued with him until they all were hoarse from the screaming match those discussions usually evolved into. But they couldn’t really understand that guilt didn’t work that way. Guilt walked straight through all the arguments and settled into the lower pit of his stomach. He would always feel responsible for the deaths that had been caused by his weapons, his inventions, regardless how justified his actions had been, regardless how much Obie had orchestrated behind his back. There was always this burden on his shoulders and he had stopped a long time ago trying to explain this feeling to somebody else.
“Mr. Krats?”
Steve had given up all attempts at silence and concentrated only on his progress, but in the back of his mind he registered the noises of repulsors and metal beating against metal. It didn’t sound good and when he felt he was safely out of reach he risked a glance at Tony.
“What happened then?”
He had no idea how long he slept, but when he woke up again, it was to Tony entering their suite. Steve tried to greet him, but every muscle in his body protested, so he just stayed where he was and hoped for the best.
“Son of a senator, you say?”
“Is noted. Anybody else?”
“And she was Tacle’s girlfriend until about one year ago,” Steve showed Tony a newspaper article.
“Or just Mr. Tacle. Theodore Edward Norton Tacle, to be precise.”
“Probably yes, now that I know what I’m looking at. But this is a very limited edition of the StarkPhone and only a few selected people received this advanced version of it – you know like the president or my board of directors for example. And each phone had a slight variation, like a serial number in his code, so I can trace every phone back to its owner.”
"Those are for you," Rogers said, almost shoving the flowers to her. She could see him blush and thought about the curse of a fair skin before she remembered her manners.
Although he categorized every one of Steve’s movements subconsciously, he didn’t know how much time really had passed when Steve suddenly tensed. Tony looked up. A small woman was approaching the grave, flowers and something that looked like a small toy in her hand. For a long time she just stood right in front of it, unaware of her surroundings, the wind playing in her dark curls. Only when she made the sign of the cross, Tony understood that she had been praying.
The bed was so cold. Steve shivered and reached for the other blanket on the bed. He couldn’t hold back the wince when the slight movement resulted in a peak of pain in his throbbing head.
Zola looked back at her.
Steve tried to shrug, the little exchange had already exhausted him. He closed his eyes and felt Tony’s hands on him. Cold against his skin, and he barely suppressed a shiver, but still welcome and familiar with their callouses and smell of grease.
He heard Steve sigh again and when he sent him a questioning look the other man shrugged.
“Fine.”
The apartment wasn’t large, from the small hallway Steve could see one other door beside the one they were led through. The room they entered was clearly multifunctional. The sofa a convertible version, still unmade with crumpled sheets and pillows, a corner with a baby bed and baby clothes stacked on the sideboard next to it. Another corner was clearly set up as kitchen, the camping oven and a microwave the only tools for cooking meals. The old TV under the window was on, but muted.
“I didn’t,” Steve answered honestly. “So what does this mean? Can you crack it?”
“We are on a graveyard,” Tony protested.
He watched her silently as she collected the last of her possessions. To an outsider it probably would have been an obvious sign of the state of their relationship that she only had a few things in the apartment despite several months of practically living together. Hell, she usually managed to distribute her belongings more effectively in any hotel room she stayed. But right now, she was just glad that she didn’t need much time to gather everything. A last look around, a last walk through his apartment but there was nothing. He followed her silently, glaring daggers at her.
“You were a pain in the ass.” Bruce said down on the bed. “Why don’t you make yourself useful? I bet Steve would love to have fresh bed linens. And maybe also prepare the sofa, I think a change of scenery might do him good.”
Ori’s frown cleared up. “Oh yeah, I’d enjoy that view as well. Too bad he is taken.”
“But …” He looked helplessly out of her door.
"Thank you, they are lovely," she stammered.
“Ms. Robinson.”
“He is dead,” he confirmed and Tony nodded.
It was strange for Steve hearing Tony being relatively formal to his new AI. With Jarvis he had always been playful, but there was still something missing in Tony’s relationship to Friday. But then Jarvis had been around Tony for years, it was hard to forget something like that. Maybe it was some kind of grieving mechanism.
“I’ve been expecting you,” Marisa Rhys said before she waved them tiredly into the apartment.
“By the way, the baby was already dead.”
Zola rolled her eyes.
“It’s daytime,” Steve offered.
“He is just human,” she tried to explain, but from the look on his face it didn’t work. He still had the star struck look on him that all new engineers had until they had to work close to Mr. Stark. Then they were still in awe of his genius, but much braver in their personal contact. She had seen it enough times not to recognize the pattern. But right now, she didn’t have the time to work through this pattern.
A wistful smile appeared on his face.
“Yes.” Both Ori and Jamie stated with conviction.
Steve turned around, away from the warmth. He was not sure how to explain the other aspect of his guilt, but sure that he had to do it.
“That would be all, Ms. Robinson.”
Tony leant very close to Steve and whispered. “But I would have been tempted.” Steve’s slight exhale was something he saved to review later.
That was unexpected.
“What’s happening now?”
“So, we can guess why you are working against Tony. But why are you fighting the Avengers, Mr. Tacle?,” Steve asked and Tony raised his eyebrows at him questioningly. He interpreted Steve’s answering shrug and tilt of his head as ‘why not’. With the universal sign ‘your turn’ he left the conversation to Steve who thanked him with another small smile and squeeze of his shoulder.
“You are not working for R&D anymore. Let them bring their stuff directly to me.” Stark said with a soft voice.
“’The view’?” Ori gave them a dubious look. Originally from Hawaii, he continually complained about hideous buildings as well as the lack of palms, beach, and surf.
“Hah, got you.”
Rogers carefully sat up, pulling Stark also in a vertical position.
“No more fever, I’d say.” He caressed Steve’s face. “Jarvis, call the doctor.”
“It’s fine,” she insisted.
They stayed in their respective spots for a long time, Steve in front of the grave and Tony on his bench. At some point he had taken his phone out, checking Friday’s progress on their investigations and seeing that there was no progress, working on some of his projects that had been neglected since his investigations. He was immersed in one of the technical specifications of a modified helicopter when Steve sat down next to him.
“I was worried,” he admitted. “And in a few minutes Peter will be awake.”
“Why them?” Steve frowned.
She let herself drop in her seat and stared at the card. It wasn't saying sorry. She turned it around. Nothing.
He turned to look at Tony and their eyes met and something hard in his stomach loosened.
“Indeed.”
“What are you doing?”
“He is sick?” Peter asked worriedly.
“You look better. Maybe the serum does work at last.” Bruce pointedly glared at Tony.
For a moment she was tempted just to ignore the lift that was somewhere between her floor and the one below and take the stairs. But a strange sound from the elevator convinced her otherwise. Apparently someone was caught in there. She hastily returned to her office to get her emergency tools and started working. The door was easily opened and the painful moans were now louder. She couldn’t make out anything distinctive, but it definitely didn’t sound good.
“That explains why he doesn’t like you, but what has he got against the Avengers?”
“You think the mother knows what happened to their child.”
“30 on the 23
Waking up with another man in his arms was nothing new for Steve. European winters tended to be very cold and army supply regarding warm blankets was always low, so sharing body heat was the way to sleep. Waking up with another man with whom you had sex with on the other hand, was somewhat new. He wondered what the protocol for this was, and if there was a protocol, whether he should do just the opposite because the person lying on top of him was Tony Stark. And he felt himself smile because Tony Stark was on top of him and how could he not have known that he needed this in his life.
“Yeah, sure.“ She stumbled through the room and laid the papers on the desk.
“Must be something big, they are lovely.”
“Hey, you were enjoying ‘the view’,” Zola retorted.
“Yes, I am. Why are you so surprised? I told you I would.”
Tony looked at him again for a minute.
Steve looked back at Tony, but the other man’s face was unreadable.
“She lost her child, Tony.”
Jamie bent forward to smell them, before she inquired “So, who is the guy?”
“You are too noble for your own good,” Jamie grumbled before she plopped down on the chair again.
Drifting off, he could hear Jarvis announcing Bruce’s arrival and felt soft hands carefully prodding him. The sound of soft voices washed over him, when he fell asleep again.
For some reason Steve had missed him the most, even though Tony had been the one to leave even before everything had started to fall apart. Or maybe he was the reason why everything was now a big mess. Maybe Tony had been the one to tie them all together. Steve had thought of contacting Tony, but didn’t know how, didn’t know if he was still allowed to. And now he was standing in front of him and it was such a shock in the best of ways.
“Well, any traces that can’t be explained by Captain Roger’s behavior.”
“I’m not betting on other people’s love life.” Zola explained.
“But everybody could use the phone’s code to create murder phones.”
Steve didn’t need to see Tony to know that this reassurance wouldn’t help. And he was proven right.
“Especially since he is expecting us,” Tony added to the bad news. “So, what’s the plan?”
“Sure, lunch,” Jamie acquiesced with an undertone.
“It’s the code I installed in the StarkPhones last year and I really don’t know how many lines of code I’ve written since then. Besides it’s a self-learning code. The original code was made by me, but the system adapts to the needs and wishes of his owner. And don’t worry I didn’t make murder phones.”
“What about the graveyard? We could wait there.”
“Okay, you know what to do,” he accepted the call.
“I’m good,” was Tony’s answer and then he pulled him flush against the armor until there was no more space between them. The smooth surface felt strange against his body, but the feeling of the kiss he remembered.
“No, I can’t … I mean … He is Tony Stark …”
Steve seemed to think about it for a moment
He really did. Their bad guy was the definition of non-descript features, nothing remarkable to remember him by. It was certainly perfect for going by unnoticed, but at the moment Tony wished for some great scar or eye-catching birthmark. It made programming search algorithms that much easier. But a vague sense of having met him before was something he probably needed to invent a new code.
“So what now?”
“She doesn’t believe that he is dating Mr. Stark,” Jamie explained in a conspirative whisper.
“Did you just quote ‘Sherlock’ on me?”, he asked incredulously.
Steve could almost feel the razor sharp intellect turn onto him.
Steve’s answer was just a squeeze of his hand.
“Daddy!” Steve smiled at excited greeting.
“Ms. Robinson, anything I can do for you?“
“Yes,” Steve sighed. “So now we are down to two Avengers to protect New York and they are the most unexperienced ones.”
Tony put up his faceplate. “You alright.”
“Yes, somewhere,” she gestured vaguely in the room. “Why?”
“How is Peter?”
Steve hadn’t finished his coffee, but he was pretty sure that wherever Tony would lead him, coffee wouldn’t be far away. He just nodded and picked up his bag and jacket while following Tony out of the shop to his car. It was one of the non-descript cars nobody knew Tony owned, looking like a family van on the outside but having every gadget Tony could imagine on the inside.
“Dr. Banner is on his way.”
“I’ve got you,” was Tony’s equally whispered answer and he felt a tender kiss into his hear.
“If I tell you tonight, will I get those rights back?”
“Marisa Rhys, 23, worked at a diner until some months ago, currently unemployed, member of several Facebook support groups for families losing their children to cancer,” Tony rattled through the information. “And I have an address.”
“Okay,” Zola agreed, but still hesitated a moment. Jamie was glaring at her. “I walked in on him and Mr. Stark kissing.”
“It’s just …,” she hesitated. “You really think they are a couple?”
Tony looked up, apparently startled by their closeness and withdrawing slightly. Steve’s reaction was similarly instinctive, he just pulled him closer again until he could see himself clearly in those brown eyes. For a moment there was reluctance and Steve was about to give him some freedom, but then Tony relaxed.
“Well, my dear Mr. Stark, that depends on if you found out my secret. Or were you too busy staring adoringly in the dear Captain’s eyes. Oh yes, I know all about you. Obie was one of my best friends and even best man at my wedding. He told me all about you. You think you can hide, but not from me.”
As far as aliases go Edward Krats was certainly not the most elaborate, but it had the advantage that it had been in use since his childhood, when his father and Obie wouldn’t want the world to know that a mere child was responsible for some of SI’s inventions. Instead Edward Krats had been created and now when the board and the public both had requested rather loudly Tony Stark’s withdrawal from Stark Industries it came in handy to have another genius in the backhand, especially one who had already worked for Howard Stark. A little voice modulation and rerouting phone calls on his part, a little story telling on Pepper’s and everybody was eager to believe in the existence of another genius who preferred no personal contact whatsoever to his employer.
“Son of a bitch,” Steve cursed.
And it was. Marisa’s description hadn’t been that great, but in front of them was a photograph of the man he had drawn.
Tony Stark dropped the hammer and grabbed a cloth to clean his hands somewhat, before he muted the television with a wipe of his hand.
“So what took you so long?“ Ori asked. They were sitting in their favorite deli, just around the corner from SI and were enjoying their meal.
“Yes, that’s exactly what I’m doing.”
There was not a sound to be heard from Marisa Rhys’ apartment, the sound of the doorbell almost shrill in contrast. It took their second attempt at ringing and some careful knocks at the door before Steve could hear moving behind it. The door was opened as far as the security chain would allow and Steve only got a short glimpse on green eyes before the door was closed again and then opened without the chain.
“There you go, Cap. Time to show your true colors.”
So he understood what Steve was feeling. He also knew that Cap didn’t deal particularly well with guilt. He could hide it, but from the few things he gathered regarding the Bucky/Winter-Soldier debacle Steve still felt responsible what had been done to the other man. Otherwise Sam wouldn’t be on a manhunt for months. Or this baby – Steve had dropped his shield, almost literally, and went into hiding.
crying.
"If you are worried about Captain Rogers, I assure you he can take care of himself."
"What if I hurt you? What if you get uncomfortable?" Tony spoke softly.
"Oh great, what is he gonna do? Scold me and tell me I should go back and apologize to those two assholes?" He scoffed and crossed his arms, making his way over to the couch he had in his lab, planting himself firmly down onto the furniture as the door to his lab opened.
He tapped his chest, making the nanites retract back into the nanoreactor, giving both him and Steve some skin-to-skin contact. He leaned down and placed a careful, calculated kiss on his cheek, missing the blood on his face and the glass etched into it, making the soldier smile just a little. And it might be morbid in a way, but God Tony cannot help but think that he's just so beautiful; and he's not saying it in regards to his physical appearance, because then it truly is morbid, but it's just the way Steve lets his personality out. His eyes, while glossy and somewhat distant, still hold this powerful look over him as they look at each other. He can see the green pooling around his pupil, complimenting the deep ocean blue of his iris as he sees the familiar wave of an emotion he's seen so many times before in Steve's eyes. At this moment, it's only ten times more strong because he can feel how scared Steve is for his life, but yet he's calm and relaxed because he's accepted it, and it makes his own brown iris convey the terror he has nestled deep down, which in return makes Steve reach up and run his thumb over his cheek. And he leans into the gesture because it's the soft touch of a loved one he's craved for so long, denied of it from a child and missing it from Pepper, he receives it from a man he's admired as a child, and loved as an adult, even if there was a moment where he hated this soldier, love was always more powerful for him.
"Alright, I'll be right there." Fuck, Tony was so close to seeing all of Steve, but now he had to watch as the soldier pulled up his pants, pulled down his shirt, and clipped his belt back into place, a sour expression splayed on his face that didn't go unnoticed either. "I'm sorry."
"And you'll let me undress you?" He asked hopefully.
"I wish you good luck and a great night, sir." He smiled at his AI's courtesy before removing himself from his lab.
Tony pulled himself out of Steve, the soldier whimpering at the loss as Tony stood up and went to the bathroom. Steve listened to the sound of running water from a faucet before Tony came back with a damp washcloth. He sat down at the edge of the bed, pressing the cloth to Steve's stomach, cleaning him up first before attending to himself. He walked back into the bathroom and washed the cloth once more, letting it sit on the edge of the counter once he was done. He made his way back to his lover, Steve snuggling up close to his side, his head rested close to his arc reactor.
"Steve." His name was called, followed by a knock on the door, halting the soldier in his process, and getting a curse out of Tony.
"Be careful, Stark," T'Challa warned him.
"I love this, a-and I love you, b-but we need to talk."
"Hey." A familiar voice calls out to him. He smiles to himself and stops what he's doing, turning around, and leaning against his workbench while he looks at the figure of his blonde boyfriend coming over to him.
He absolutely
Once he felt like he enjoyed the look of the world upside down, he righted himself and activated his thrusters, accelerating himself towards his destination.
"Y-You're hurting me, Tony," I said softly, unshed tears blurring my vision just a bit. He licked his lips and it made me shudder, this wasn't the Tony I was used to; Tony was always kind and gentle to me, he showed me affection and always took care of me. He would always run his fingers through my hair to ease the stress away, his kisses were always soft and careful like he wanted to savor each moment we were together. This Tony, he was rough, not so delicate, his kisses felt like needles against my skin, making me shiver and whimper. He seemed to be enjoying it, the way he smiled at me and licked his lips again.
Friday wasn't lying when she said that there was a mass quantity of vehicles approaching the perimeter. He could see the choppers high in the sky, circling the compound, multiple black vans within his sight as well, stopping on the lawn.
When his tongue protrudes from his mouth and licks the hot sensation on his neck where his teeth just were, does his body shiver again, but this time it's much more violent. The hot sensation of his teeth against his neck, mixed in with his breath that soon is replaced by the cold, wet sensation of his tongue sets his body into overload and he all but moans out the soldier's name in response.
"Hey, Tin Can!" A voice yelled, causing the two males to separate. Tony groaned in response, already knowing who the voice belonged to. "Come on Tony, where you at!? We gotta celebrate, we're all back together!"
Would Ross come looking for him? Would he be able to find him, is also the question, since Steve still had zero ideas where the hell he was, and it actually was in a way testing his patience. If he's going to be Tony's makeshift prisoner, he could at least tell him where he is so he could have some sense of direction.
He degrades himself, saying he fucked everything up and wishes he could take it all back. Wishes that he didn't betray Steve, to begin with, wishes he didn't harbour all the hatred imaginable when he made that call to him and got him captured, wishes that the roles were swapped and it was him who was in this bed. But the consequences have already been set in stone, and all he could do was be there.
"How do you do that?" Tony's face scrunched up in confusion, eyebrows lowered, a crease forming between his eyebrows as he looked at the super-soldier.
Before I could respond to what he was saying, I felt his mouth on my neck. I whimpered as I felt his teeth rake my neck, tearing the skin a little, drawing some blood in the process. I shied away from him, making him growl in response.
"Well, that would be a pretty decent plan, if it wasn't for the fact we have a mind manipulating witch, who, by the way, is on our side and would tell us if you shit bags are still messing around with us." He could see the creature's expression sour, and he knew he was getting somewhere. "You planned to have Wanda take us out one by one, wasn't it?"
"Ok, so hear me out," Tony said, slightly out of breath and holding up his phone with all the data present, "you issued the first mission right, officially?"
"Who taught you how to do that, hmm? Who taught you how to give someone blue balls?"
"No kidding, huh?" He chuckled softly to himself, nodding his head and taking up her offer to get some liquid in his system. The walk itself was quiet, besides the sounds of their footsteps against the marble flooring and the voices of the other agents, but the silence between them was welcoming.
"I wanna help you..." He gripped the soldier's shirt tight within his fist, knuckles turning white, face pressed against his chest. It was hard for Tony not to worry about him, considering how close they are. It was annoying how S.H.I.E.L.D. just decides when it's a good time to send their agents out on the field, but that's the thing, really, Steve isn't an agent, and just because S.H.I.E.L.D. was the one who thawed him out of the ice,
"So you're saying aliens might be at work?" Tony inquired, turning around to look at Fury who still had his back to him.
"Don't feel like watching." He replied, turning his attention back to the ceiling. There was this weird hollow feeling in the pit of his stomach, the sort of feeling you get when you knew you had something, but felt like something was missing behind it. He felt his jaw clench, his hands forming into fists, a deep sigh in anger exhaled through his nose. Just what was this feeling that left a bitter taste in his mouth, spoiled his attitude, and turned it rotten. Was it the feeling of loneliness again? No, that can't be right. Natasha is sitting right next to him, although they may not be taking, at least he has company, right? Ugh, it was too confusing for him to figure out, and the more he thought about it, the angrier he got.
"Stop!" I yelled. Everything faded and I found myself back in the chair, Wanda standing off to the side, a smile on her face, and Tony, sitting in my lap with a huge grin on his face. I was panting, my head snapping in every direction, eyes trembling, wide and filled with panic. I felt my hair being pulled, my head snapping back and looking up, Tony's eyes staring back at me as he towered over me.
He sat in the communal area and bit his lip, wondering just where the love of his life could be? And normally it would be ok to let his mind wander and let himself succumb to his thoughts, but that was before he had someone he to worry about. Back then all he had to worry about was how to work modern technology; how the TV worked, how pretty much every invention in Avengers tower, and hell he even still looked up at the ceiling every time Jarvis- or rather now it was Friday- talked and he still wondered how they worked.
And Tony was willing to roll with the punches on how normal his life seemed right now, because while the life of a superhero courts chaos, and is completely random at times, for now, he'll just stay in this moment. This moment is perfect, and right now everything is normal and feels domestic. And when he's kissing Steve's lip once again for the third time, he feels as if there's nothing that could really ruin what he has with the man of his dreams.
"There were many times where Jarvis asked if he should alert you. I always told him no because I didn't want to bother him or you, for that matter. You were always in your lab, mix that in with the fact that you gave me a home and didn't ask for anything in return, which if I'm being honest, I always thought was weird because I thought you hated me."
"I'm afraid so," Thor said softly.
Well, at least for now, that is.
"What did you do to Steve?"
"Steve, I..."
“Tony?”
The underground tunnel branched off to the right after a while, and then they followed an intricate array of twists and turns into progressively narrower corridors. The stench was now suffocating.
He stopped.
do you
“Get away from me.”
They would finish their plunder soon. And then they would pack everything up and drag him away with them. Drag him away to some underground layer where who knew what kind of new horrorshow was in store for him.
He kept perfectly still, since the noise was too close to risk any movement. He kept his breathing steady as well. He had learned long ago that the sharp sound of an erratic breathing could give him away.
The door opened.
He briefly considered running, but the scent would give him away as well. Here there was a chance that the pungent smell of the sewer and wet puddles would hide him. That was what he was betting his life on, he thought almost hysterically. Sewer and trash.
He was alone.
A feverishly warm body covered him, and Tony felt himself slipping further away.
Thank you so much everyone for all your kind comments and support! I had no idea this story would interest so many people, and I am beyond overwhelmed!
He saw a hand reach towards him and flinched back violently.
Tony carefully opened his eyes. Steve was sitting on the bottom steps of the wooden staircase, shoulders heaving.
Steve’s voice was choked by tears.
Another deep breath, and the Alpha’s eyes fell shut on a sigh.
The voice was soothing, but Tony’s mind refused to associate it with the calm it was trying to evoke.
“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. Please - I’m so sorry.”
“Sometimes I feel like I never woke up. Like I’m still sleeping underneath and this is what my mind conjured up to punish me for my mistakes. Or maybe I never survived, and a consciousness above my own is, in fact, meeting out the punishment.”
He could stay here. Maybe crawl his way to a shelter for the night. And hope to God he won’t be found. But the smell will most certainly give him away, and he learned by now not to rely on his luck.
Something like a smile touched Steve’s lips.
“Let’s get this over with then.”
“Yeah. You too?”
The light from Steve’s flashlight abruptly went off.
“Bucky. Bucky, please.”
“He’s easily provoked. I mean, he’s usually more...unresponsive. But he has those… episodes I guess you could call them. And I fear one day he will just overpower me and disappear into the night.”
He looked around. Boxes, books, blankets, clothes, their food supplies, all spread out on the wooden floor. He will have to go through them, tidy everything back into place. Build everything back up.
Steve stopped walking. He turned around to face him. His face was impassive, but his gaze seemed to hold a desolate sadness.
He had to savagely strangle the urge to scream. He could feel the scream perched beneath his chin, but he couldn’t afford the noise.
Steve mumbled a thanks, looking almost embarrassed.
THUMP.
Several voices carried down from upstairs.
He felt the panic rising like a distant wave, miles away from the shore. He was oddly calm, a sense of safety enveloping him like a blanket. And he could smell something warm and soothing, like cinnamon and embers.
Thank you again from the bottom of my heart for all your kind comments. I can't believe people actually read this story, let alone care about it enough to leave a comment. Thank you, and please keep letting me know what you think! <3
His head lowered in a tight nod.
“Just like you did last time?”
But then a flash of light tore through the darkness like a knife, and Tony registered the pain in his eyes together with an abrupt shift in atmosphere. It soured like poison.
When a shadow moved past him, he didn’t dare breathe a sigh of relief. It was never just one. They usually hunted in packs, like wolves or hyenas.
The turned his back to Tony and started rummaging through one of the boxes.
Steve lifted a hand a pressed his fingers roughly against his eyes.
He started laughing.
“You’ll stay with me.”
“What kind of...of
Tony barely had the time to process the implications of that before he collided with something solid. Warm and breathing.
He took a step towards it, then hesitated. Steve had told him to stay upstairs.
Steve turned towards it and his large unyielding body seemed to fracture as if something was crushing him from within.
----------
here? Do you seriously think that will work? ARE YOU THAT FUCKING NAIVE? You stupid fucking idiot. Hundreds - thousands of people have been trying to find some way of curing it and they haven’t succeeded. Ever. IN CENTURIES.”
“Tony?” Apparently Steve wasn’t asleep either.
“It was a team effort,” Steve replied easily, voice calm. “But Tony was the one who took out the last of them. We don’t normally aim to kill people, but we weren’t given much choice.”
“Well…” Tony swallowed, putting the panel back in place and turning. “It wasn’t anything like you and A’gel’fush, that’s for sure.” He grinned weakly. “We fought at first, couldn’t seem to get along…”
Tony glanced askance at him, the corner of his mouth tilting up. “You like me, anyway.”
“So let me…” Tony managed a breath, unwinding enough to be able to gesture, release some of the manic energy under his skin. “Let me get this straight. Because, uh…I might be misunderstanding some things. You said –
“Of course he does,” Tony said, although it seemed to be said on autopilot. “I’m likeable. Why wouldn’t he like me? That’s like da Vinci not liking painting.”
He’d carefully decided
date Steve if given the opportunity didn’t mean Steve would have that realization, too.
“Ah, well…” Steve’s cheeks flushed lightly, so much like the pink hue they’d taken on after he’d kissed Tony on the faceplate during that party. “I didn’t know if you did. It was…it was a long time ago.”
Tony looked rather like someone had hit him over the head with a wrecking ball, eyes wide and mouth slightly open. “You—”
Not that he cared that much about his joints. Was he going to get any sleep tonight by sleeping next to Steve? He’d shared beds before, but that was with one-night stands or Pepper. (And Rhodey, but Rhodey had sworn off sleeping in the same bed with Tony after the third time they’d done so and Tony had sprawled on top of him.) This was…totally different because he would so like to date Steve but they weren’t actually dating yet everyone thought they were dating and so they had to keep up the pretense and to do so they had to share this alien bed or Earth would be blacklisted.
As negotiations still weren’t done and Thor was “loathe to call on Heimdall repeatedly for such minor trips,” that meant they had to sleep on the ship.
Tony found him several minutes later playing Mario Kart with Clint, Natasha polishing her knives on the armchair in the corner as she watched. Bruce was snoozing on the other couch, glasses askew on his face. Steve seemed to be winning while Clint was in last place behind even the AIs.
How many pillows did the Malnussians think they needed?
“Yes.”
“Sounds romantic,” Tony said, smiling despite himself.
Steve didn’t notice, shaking his head. “I told you, Clint, we’re not—”
want to date Steve. They were just factors be considered because Steve wasn’t perfect. America liked to paint their golden (red, white, and blue) boy to be without flaws, but Tony had seen Steve squinty-eyed and annoyed in the early morning hours and chewing on his thumbnail when in the middle of a good book and biting his lower lip when sketching and—
Their movie night wasn’t interrupted by any villains making an appearance. What happened after the movie was also uninterrupted and Steve found himself in a rather bright mood as he went through his routine the next day.
straight! Yet that didn’t change anything, did it?) He forced himself to let go before he could do something as foolish as hold Steve’s hand. Even back in Steve’s time, holding hands had been a romantic gesture. “So are you okay with it?”
Rhodey knew Tony was bi. Or pan. They hadn’t ever really specified on which it was, only that Tony liked everyone regardless of genitalia.
Narrowing his eyes at Rogers, Rhodey slowly backed away, making sure not to wake either of them. It was rather surprising that he hadn’t woken a so-called super soldier up, but he supposed that Rogers was sleeping too deeply to hear anything.
“Will they take it as an act of war?” Natasha asked.
“I’m just glad you’re here,” Steve said quietly. His words would have gotten lost in the din of the festivities if Tony’s ears weren’t so finely tuned to the sound of Steve’s voice (he was aware that he was pathetic). “Last year…” He exhaled. “You scared me.”
“We’re both lucky,” Steve insisted, although he wasn’t sure how much of that Tony understood given he’d said it into Tony’s mouth.
“I always enjoy them,” Steve said, voice softening. “Especially when you’re here.”
“Say that an hour from now when all the eggnog’s gone.”
“You know it was my turn to pick the movie.”
Tony stopped tapping his fingers against his mug, giving Rhodey a perturbed look. He looked like he was seriously thinking about the question. “Nooo? Is there something I was supposed to tell you? Did I forget about something? I have your birthday in my calendar—”
“It’s nine in the morning,” Barton muttered, leaning forward to put his almost empty bowl of cereal on the table and getting up. “Sue me for not wanting to put the damn things in this early.”
Steve hadn’t been able to look him in the eyes without a faint blush for days after that.
“No, because it’s going to be
The difficult thing with everyone believing you were in a relationship even though you honestly weren’t was that there was no one to talk to.
“Oh?” Tony sounded distracted, hands deep in the circuitry of his chest plate.
“I’m waiting,” Steve said, giving Tony a shit-eating grin. “How long should I wait for?”
“I’m so fucked, JARVIS,” Tony said, voice muffled by his hands. “
Not that Tony had any idea what he would have said if he’d tried.
Tony had been just fine with complete obliviousness. Damn Rhodey.
Now…there were so many, and it was like the large extended family Tony had never known he wanted until he had it.
“I want this!” Tony reassured him, reaching up to brush a hand through Steve’s hair. “I just meant…we don’t have to change anything about we were doing before, right? Because historically speaking…I haven’t been the best at relationships. And what we were doing before seemed to work pretty well?”
“I want this,” Steve said, face mere inches from Tony’s. He looked startlingly vulnerable. “I want you.”
"Remind me never to listen to anything the government says," Natasha said as he walked past her, making him chuckle. "Anyways, better get back to Wakanda. Gotta upload some files onto the internet." She smiled at him and looked down at Tony, casting a warm, gentle smile his way before bounding past him and up the stairs.
"Tony?" He said, weakly.
killed my parents!?" And there was that assumption again of Bucky being his boyfriend, which obviously he wasn't. He didn't harbor any romantic feelings towards the person who was more or less like a brother to him, rather than a romantic interest.
"If you would like to see Mr. Stark, we're all finished now." He got up from his seat as soon as the doctor finished his sentence, not wanting to waste any more time away from his lover. The doctor led him down the hallway, turning right and walking past all the other double doors that held patients, turning left and heading straight until the doctor stopped in front of two wooden doors.
While this story has already been finished on my Wattpad, I am still posting this chapter on Tony Stark's birthday! So, happy birthday to Tony Stark, a wonderful character that many people can either relate to, learn from and hold a special place in their heart.
"Is there anything you don't know?" He asked, slightly amused.
"I love you, Steve." He whispered, wrapping his arms around the soldier's neck and pulling him into a hug.
be doing this with, he chose Tony.
"Oh god," Tony groaned, rolling his eyes, "my AI and the super-soldier are teaming up against me. Careful, Rogers, soon he'll start to like you more than me."
They talk for a few hours, laughing and telling jokes to one another, and then just shortly after it changes to a more serious tone. He soon finds himself talking about what happened back at the Avengers compound when T'Challa asks, retelling every little detail he dares not to leave out. He tells him about how he got Steve to come back to New York, how he was the one who helped him escape when he saw that Ross was going to kill him, explained how he kept him at the Compound and fed him, and even about all the tension they had. Eventually, retells the entire story leading up to where he and Steve are now. And while it's a lot to take in, T'Challa simply just nods his head in response and says he's been doing some research on the whole Ross situation.
Tony’s hand slid down to gently grasp his hand.
When it leaned forward, its hot breath a brand on Tony’s pulse and its hand starting to slip down towards his chest, Tony felt himself slip under.
“Tony. Please, wait. Listen to me.”
He waited until it was close enough, then he swiftly faked a punch at its head, while his knee rose sharply for its groin. He put all his body weight into the hit, and felt tissue contract and give way under the bone of his leg.
He looked towards the basement. The flashlight Steve had used yesterday was still by the door. He obviously didn’t need it when pushing around dead bodies in pitch darkness.
“Some people said Jesus came back. I bet it was just some rumour someone started because they needed some fucking hope when all that hell broke loose.” He chuckled. “Why? Did you believe them?”
----------
--------------------------------------
His fingers moved lower, tracing the back of a hand and then sliding underneath, their palms now pressed together. Tony curled his fingers around his larger palm, keeping his own hand underneath, a point of both support and supplication.
He needed information now.
He knew he wasn’t an innocent in this. He had chosen to follow this stranger in the hope he would end up in a safer place. If Steve or his pet didn’t end up killing him, the irony might.
“Can you stand? Can I - Would you let me help you upstairs?”
--------------------------------------
He began to trash desperately. He aimed a punch at what he guessed to be Steve’s head, but his fist was grabbed easily in midair.
And then the smell hit him. He felt the hair at the nape of his neck stand on end, and a violent shiver racked his body.
-----------
Steve turned the flashlight back on again.
Steve’s smile turned into a grimace.
The hand released his neck and grabbed both of his wrists in one swift movement, while something hit the back his knee with enough force to send him sprawling. He lost his balance, and another jerk of his captured wrists brought him down on the cold cement.
“I just hope I’ll be able to follow him.”
A harsh laugh escaped him.
“Tony.”
The soft tissue felt thin and vulnerable, a jarring contrast to the barely contained aggression that seemed to leak out of the rest of his body. Tony’s thumb traced the exposed sliver of skin and felt one of his calluses catch at the fragile vein.
Tony spared an idle thought to how incredibly clean Steve managed to keep those tiles even in the middle of a war zone.
Steve jerked slightly at the sound and looked towards the door again. His eyes turned cold once more, the light in them dying. And taking Tony’s hope with it.
He registered the movement of a body in his periphery. The room seemed to brighten, and he vaguely registered the single light bulb hanging overhead, now unobscured by the shape leaning over him.
“And I can’t let that happen.”
“I don’t know yet. We’ve been here for - a long time. I’ll have to - I’ll have to check one of the other safe houses. There is one five kilometres to the northeast and - “
His choice wasn’t really much of a choice in the first place.
-----------
Steve would fight back. Steve would know how to overpower him. Steve
His attention was caught by a glint of metal on Steve’s chest. Hanging from around his neck, the silvery shine betraying care and attachment, were dog tags. Two sets.
Tony scanned his surroundings once more. Nothing but damp concrete and an old staircase. Nothing he could use. Nowhere he could hide.
A heavy set man was blocking the doorway, his eyes settling on Tony with an air of triumph
So he just froze. Immobile and petrified in the cold.
Not taking his eyes away from the man now sitting calmly in the pool of grey water, he took a step backwards. He needed the space, he needed to breathe. Just for a minute. Just a few seconds.
“I can help you find a cure for your friend. All the people who ran all those studies before… most of the time their only goal was to understand how ferals … behaved, how they worked, how to stop them, to - to
“Yeah, I bet you’re glad to have run into me. Not that many Omegas around these days, are there?”
There was no change in Steve’s expression. He didn’t budge.
He couldn’t remember the last time he had brushed his teeth.
“I can stand.” The words were faint and painful to get out, but he was relieved to hear his own voice outside his head. As if he had a hope of filling the void around him, even by a drop.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony had barely managed to slip into the bathroom when a dark-clad figure began descending the stairs.
He couldn’t see anything in the dark, the light from Steve’s blowtorch blinding him to the surroundings. Tony felt panic rise in his chest. And Steve…
“You should get some sleep.”
“Are you calm?”
Tony realized he was shouting. He took a ragged breath and let it out on a whisper:
The fabric pooled around his feet, and he was completely naked. Tony didn’t allow himself to register anything beyond the sight of a wounded and trembling body.
“Hey, Bucky. It’s Bucky, right?”. The name felt strange in his mouth.
“Okay. Ok. He’s not an animal.” He swallowed. “ But Steve, listen to me, I don’t want to go that way. I do not want to come with you anymore. You said you’d let me choose and now I’m telling you to let me go because I am NOT going that way.”
Steve had loved someone once.
When he saw the signature at the bottom his heart lurched, but his hands remained steady. That feeling of being perched on the edge of a cliff returned as he contemplated putting it back where he found it. But, as he knew from the beginning he would, he read it instead.
"I miss you so much. You can't imagine - I wish there had been another way. I'm so sorry."
“These will be large, but they’re clean. There’s a shower in the bathroom. The water should run hot for a bit.”
Wow, guys thank you so much!! I can't believe this story has so many kudos. I'm beyond overwhelmed. Thank you again for reading and I hope you'll stick with me through the ride. I know this might be a bit of a dark take on those characters but I promise there's a light at the end of the tunnel.
“I’m sorry. About last time.”
Tony bolted. He ran blindly, guided only by the smell which screamed at him DANGER.
Puffs of breath warmed the side of his neck, moist skin pressed against his. It was
“I only ever had Pepper, you know. Other people came and went, but they never stuck around for long. But she was really mine. Or I guess she let me be hers. I could never quite believe she chose to love someone like me.”
literally in his grasp.
He shook his head. There was still a feral Alpha standing five feet away from him, gazing vacantly at the bathroom tiles.
leave him like this. If there’s any chance to save him - to help him...”
“Had the pyjamas and action figures and everything. I was the coolest kid on the block.”
Blood was dripping off of its fingers, and Tony realised numbly that it must have been its own, matching the ravaged bloody mess of its left shoulder.
Jake nodded, still transfixed, and picked it up awkwardly. He seemed surprised by its weight.
But moving was dangerous. Moving meant breaking the fragile barrier of silence that enfolded him and risking unknown dangers. His only weapon was to listen, and his only warning was sound.
The click of the light being turned on made him startle.
He hesitated again. Undressing him now, while he was docile and quietly pliant, made Tony’s stomach turn. He couldn’t comprehend how an Alpha of his size, his feral scent saturating the small room, could look so helpless. So vulnerable.
“HE’S NOT AN ANIMAL.”
“It’s fucking dark outside, Steve! You need to what? Go out there and get yourself killed? Is this your answer to all this fuckery that
The question was if he was stupid enough to use it.
Tony allowed himself a moment to enjoy the warmth filling the room, the subtle smell of steaming water. Even after weeks of being able to bathe again, he didn’t think he would ever be able to erase the previous months of living in filth. He sometimes felt like the grime had soaked into his body, and he could feel it slither beneath his skin. In those moments he had to wash himself again and again, scrubbing until the trickles of blood wiped him clean again.
Tony closed his eyes and leaned back against a wall. A harsh laugh escaped him.
Steve looked away.
Steve turned around, his outstretched hand offering a bundle of cloth and a toothbrush. It was such an outrageously domestic image, Tony had to restrain a hysterical giggle.
That was what his thought kept circling back to. The sheer blank panic of it, the water choking him and the sand coming back beneath his palms. He had thought he would be able to keep his head, that if he knew it was coming he could survive it again. He hated how wrong he had been.
There were never any sounds coming through. He kept coming back regardless.
“Does - does it hurt?”
-------
The sounds of a violent scuffle. Growls and thunder in the dark. The heavy thud of the door slamming and the screech of metal being bent.
Steve’s gaze dropped back to the floor.
Thank you so much to everyone who has given this story a chance! I'm beyond flattered that you seem interested, I can't even believe I got over 100 kudos. It's so great to receive feedback, especially since I'm just a baby writer.
THUMP.
THUMP
“He won’t - he would never…”
He concentrated on the part of his mind that was never clouded by fear and cold. The thoughts that ran tireless and bright like clockwork, a solid path he could hide on when everything else cracked.
He lost the awareness of time and escape and the angle at which you must hit cartilage in order to break joint, all of him consumed by the instinctive need to
Tony scoffed, scrubbing a sleeve roughly against his cheek.
In the end, he walked, Steve walking beside him. He couldn’t entertain the thought of running after the inexplicable display of earlier, so he just kept moving forward into a growing sense of dread.
Steve frowned, questions almost brimming out of him.
Once the light faded, he was as good as cornered. Once they came out to play…
“Very well, Stevie, I’ll come with you.”
“Just. Please, just tell me.”
“No. Just sort of - collapsed on top of me. I think. I must have passed out for a while there.”
when he felt a cold hand close around his throat.
The flashlight was illuminating a misshapen pile of fabric, stained red and dripping slowly on the stone floor.
“Tony?” he shouted suddenly. “Tony, where - “
Tony just kept on laughing, tears now leaking from his eyes.
But he couldn’t afford to spare another thought for Steve’s broken body, because its head moved back towards him.
“What are you doing around here?”
He didn’t look like something that could rip three men to pieces. He was closer to the shape that had rested its head on Tony and fell asleep around him in the dark.
The night had passed.
He had no idea where he could possibly go. His limbs felt heavy, and his mind was too numb to properly contemplate any consequences. If he could just sit here quietly and wait for the night, maybe they wouldn’t find him, maybe he could just sleep. He wanted to sleep for a very long time.
moment?”
Tony stopped dead.
He told himself he had a lot of rest to catch up on.
“You know, it’s sort of funny. It feels just like last time. Like he’s just out of my grasp, and if I would reach just a bit further my fingers could touch his. Those five seconds stretched into years. Maybe this is what purgatory feels like.”
It was all one room, a tiny door which must have led to a bathroom and another staircase up to another floor. The furnishings were sparse, only a mattress neatly covered with precisely folded blankets and several boxes leaning against walls. There were stacks of books near the mattress, the spines cracked and yellowed, with what looked like a sketchbook placed on top. A piece of charcoal rested on it, perfectly aligned to the book’s edge.
He jerked the shirt off in a swift motion, the fabric clearing his head in just a few seconds.
Tony took another breath, then gently rested his right hand on the arm holding him captive.
Steve turned back abruptly. Tony flinched back.
“What the fuck are you? Let go of me! Get your hands
The quiet was deafening. Steve’s hand had begun trembling where it was holding Tony’s shirt, and his nostrils flared. His eyes were too bright and didn’t look entirely sane.
Steve threw him a quick smile. He took a deep breath.
There was a snort.
“As off your rocker as you are, Stevie, and as much it pains me to admit it, you’re still my best bet right now. So now I think I’ll take my chances with you.”
He found a piece of cloth and dunked it in the greying water, then rubbed it on the yellowish bar of soap Steve had given him. He couldn’t bring himself to properly scrub across the skin, irrationally afraid he would somehow hurt him, so he gently swiped it across his shoulder blades and torso.
He opened his eyes and shook himself.
When morning came, Steve left to bury the bodies.
“Are you completely
Afterward, he quickly put on the clothes Steve had given him, unwilling to face the sight of his naked body or the feeling of vulnerability that consumed him.
“How the fuck - what the
“Someone broke in. Three someones broke in. I tried to run out the window but it was locked.” He shot Steve a look. “I guess someone didn’t want me to leave. Anyway. Tried to hide, got found, punched around a bit. Took them downstairs so they’d pick on someone their one size. Well. Someone several times their size as it turned out. The end.”
He wondered what became of it, but he knew its ultimate end. The madness was incurable, their rage too violent to be contained.
“Fucking hell! Who the fuck is this?” A lanky kid, barely done being a teenager, was hanging back near the staircase they had come down from.
Steve huffed a laugh and lifted his eyes to look at him, smiling softly.
He stopped moving.
Steve didn’t answer for a long time.
A creature he was now trapped with.
“Hey, it’s me. Remember me?”
Tony briefly entertained the thought of braining him with one of the heavy hardcovers lying on the floor.
The intricate wiring at the end screamed of neural circuitry and made Tony’s fingers twitch. To think he had been in this room for this long with
He concentrated on breathing.
A hungry inhale rasped over Tony’s fingers.
He wondered if Steve had opened the metal door, checked if it was hungry or wounded. Wounded after Tony had set it loose on those men.
weak and powerless. Life had already taught him that.
A corner of the Alphas mouth curled into a self-deprecating smile.
Steve stopped by his side and watched him quietly, a hand grasping his arm.
Steve moved with it, a careful distance away.
“He’s not a monster.” His voice was still soft. “He’s - he’s my friend. And he’s a good man. I won’t - I can’t stand by and leave him like this. I will
He turned abruptly and left, the steps clouded by his tears.
“That’s fair, I suppose.” He looked up at the sky. “I wouldn’t trust me either.”
“Hey. Hey, are you with me?”
“Take this. I’ll take advantage of the light and go make sure there’s no one nearby for now. Won’t be long.”
Tony opened his eyes blearily and took in the broad frame of his unexpected companion. The scent registered strongly even among the sickly sweet smell of garbage. An Alpha.
He remembered reading once that insanity was contagious. He was now convinced it must be true. Whatever tormented Steve, whatever poison floated around in this Godforsaken world, whatever was wrapped around the mind of the tortured soul following him up the stairs, it was now soaking into Tony himself.
