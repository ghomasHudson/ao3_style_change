On somewhat unsteady feet, Steve slowly walked towards the doors.  He took the heavy handle between his hands and pulled, pushing his head inside.  From that vantage, he could see the light more clearly.  There was a fire set in a large hall, just behind a long, wooden banquet table and high-backed chairs carved with scrolling woodwork that Steve couldn’t make out from this far away.
“I’m sure baby Steve likes your bright, pretty lights just as much as Thor’s,” Natasha said, giving him a side-eyed look as she walked towards the elevator.  “I’ll go check in with Bruce.  See if he’s come up with anything that we should be doing that could help.”
“Huh?  Ah, no, you—we—should—inside,” Steve stuttered, tongue suddenly too big for his mouth, like the words were thought bubbles he had to force out.  He moved back to hold open the door and watched the man peek his head inside, scowl, wrinkle his nose and give Steve a measuring look.
“Caring for you doesn’t make me blind, Tony,” Jarvis replied.  “I am well aware of your faults, not the least of which being a rather nasty penchant for self-sabotage.  No, I see you quite clearly, I assure you. Understanding you, watching you grow up.  Knowing what you have faced. I think it’s a bit like our shoebox viewers, isn’t it?  It is the perspective that let’s me see something extraordinary that I would have missed without the right way to look at it.  Perhaps your Captain simply needs to be shown the right way to look at things.”
“I am not judging him.  I want to…help,” Steve finished, feeling the air go out of his chest at their looks.
Tony stopped trying to jerk his arm away and went still.  He closed his eyes, let out a slow breath, then opened them and lifted his eyes to Steve.  Wide, dark eyes, the first things Steve had seen of him, all those years ago.
“Yeah, here.  Ah, just…just squeeze the sides. See?  Like this,” Tony said, applying pressure to the sides.  “And then…ta-da?” The catch on the top opened, and the tiny robot, barely a millimeter in length, crawled out.  “It’s got a micro solar cell for power.  Very rudimentary behavioral processing capabilities, using electronic impulses to direct choice logarithms, but I’m working on an app.  I mean, I don’t know what it will do, exactly.  It’s just..it’s…”  Stupid.  Stupid, why had he made a robot into Steve’s ring?  Who wanted that?  What, diamonds were just so last year?  Trying to be clever, trying to impress, trying, trying, trying.  He should have just—
. Who lives with him. Who he left a great career for,” Tony continued.  “And I’m…what?  The guy who let his weapons get in the hands of terrorists, Rhodey.  The same weapons that probably killed half Steve’s squad and caused whatever happened with Barnes.  You don’t think that’s going to put a pin in whatever this—this
, it’s just a little dirty talk,” Brock sniffed derisively.  “Guess we’re just going to pretend it didn’t happen. Whatever.  I’m fucking hard as a rock here.  You gonna get the lube or what?”
“Howard—my father—he did some work on the Manhattan Project.  Probably went to those parties at some point. If there were women and booze there, it’s probably a given,” Tony said lightly, though there was a stiffness to the way he said it.
“We are,” Steve said quietly, pressing a quick kiss to the top of Tony’s head as they wound their way through the fruit maze, sending a pleasant heat spreading through Tony’s belly, a slight buzz filling his head.
“I wouldn’t go that far,” Natasha demurred.  “He’s hot, though,” she shrugged.  Steve huffed out a laugh and shook his head, leaning a bit over the table to crowd his beer between his hands.
Well, it would probably say a lot, he thought viciously, scrubbing his face with his hand and turning away from the image in the mirror doing the same.
“No.  I promised Jarvis. And mom.  It-it’ll be fine.  I know it will, I’m just…” Tony trailed off, watching his former home approach through the windshield of the car where Happy’s reflection loomed over it like a Macy’s parade balloon.  “It’s fine.  Be good to see them,” he lied, giving Steve a quick nod.  “Really.”
“Ha! I knew you were into me,” Tony said, snapping his fingers at Steve in triumph.  “You, with your disapproving face that I may or may not have found also sort of insanely hot.  You thought I was an entitled ass. Admittedly, not totally off the mark on that one, I think we can all agree.  But, you were totally into me.  I knew it.  Rhodey owes me a dollar. Can I call him?  I want to call him.  He said not to interrupt him while he was meeting with the base CO, but I feel like this should fall under some kind of emergency exception.”
“You don’t want the plans now?  The super-important plans that you and my Godmother needed so badly that you were ready to Macgyver my dad’s safe and bust out of here? Those plans.  You do remember those plans, right? From like two minutes ago,” Tony prodded.
“Ah, Mr. Stark!  We are so honored that you decided to dine with us tonight,” the Chef beamed.  Probably thinking about all the free press, Tony thought with an inward sigh.
“Good.  You should.  Pick out whatever you want,” Steve encouraged, then headed back to the dressing room to change.  “You said you had something for the gala, right?”
“Yeah.  Yeah, we figured that was it,” Tony said.  “Well, Thor did, after his little Vision quest thing.  And then there was this Strange guy. Not strange guy. His name is Strange.  Not odd. Actually Stra—you know, forget it. Anyhoo, big bad is coming, wants his stones, bad things for all, yadda, yadda.”
“You could. You are stronger than you think,” Tony told him.  “Which makes it mean all the more that you did not.”  Steve leaned down and pressed a lingering kiss to the top of Tony’s head.  Tony sighed, then tilted his head up, brushing his lips across Steve’s with just the barest touch.  It was all the invitation Steve needed to deepen the kiss, nipping lightly at Tony’s bottom lip until Tony opened underneath his mouth.  Steve swiped his tongue inside, sliding it against Tony’s.  He caught Tony’s low moan against his mouth, feeling Tony press his body closer.  Steve gripped the curls at the back of Tony’s head, leaning into Tony’s heat.  He could hear his own heart echoing through his ears and felt his body start to tighten in response.
Tony was looking down between them, watching his hand work at Steve’s cock, so Steve let his gaze crawl over the familiar lines of Tony’s face.  He wanted this.  This whatever it was with Tony.  No, he corrected.  He wanted Tony.  So, open a door, old man, he chided himself listlessly.
Some time later, he felt the knot start to subside. He shivered, already feeling empty.  Steve seemed in no hurry to leave him, but finally, he pressed his lips to the top of Tony’s head, sighed, and pulled out.  He moved Tony to one side, wiped himself off and fixed his breeches, then adjusted the furs around him. Tony thought of the wraps the Omegas used to swaddle their babies while they traveled and smiled.  Steve came back with the water bag and held it to Tony’s lips until he drank his fill, then pressed a wad of wool between Tony’s legs to absorb the rest of the wetness. Seemingly satisfied, Steve lay down beside him and curled around him, pulling Tony’s back to his chest.  Tony toyed with his amulet, tracing the shape on it again and again.
Tony stared at him for a few seconds, mouth hanging open in disbelief, then a spluttering laugh spilled out.  It spilled out and over everything, and suddenly, Tony wasn’t sure if he was laughing or sobbing, it was all wrapped up together. Joy, terror, amusement, regret, relief, shame, happiness, anger, all of it bubbled up to the surface like a spicket had been opened.  He was falling forward without realizing it, but it didn’t matter. Steve would catch him.  And he did, wrapping Tony up in his arms and pulling him down onto the tile floor of the bathroom, cradled on his lap, just rocking him there and murmuring soothing nothings in Tony’s ear while he trembled and shook.
Someone moaned, and Steve realized the sound came from him.  His other self looked up from his place between the cheeks of Tony’s ass and grinned, then blew lightly across Tony’s hole, cooling the skin. He bent his head again and took the rim between his teeth and suckled at it until Tony cried out, high and needy.
He felt something hard and bluntly rounded at his entrance and sighed, spreading his legs wide with a rough, needy moan.  He was ready. So ready. Slick and open and ready for Steve. He felt Steve breach him, fill him. It didn’t even hurt at all. He could barely feel it, in fact, it wasn’t at all like before, but, that was good, that was fine, that was—he stopped and looked down, watching Steve’s hand disappear between Tony’s legs.
The Reverend even offered to come over and pray with him at night and said he could perform a ritual to help ward off the visitations. Steve probably would have tried the horrible-looking belt and taken the Reverend up on his offer, as uneasy as it made him at the time, except that very night, the Reverend up and vanished. No one had heard from him since. It turned out, the Reverend had been spending the church’s coin over at the brothel in Gulleytown, Steve recalled with a flat grimace, and the town was rife with speculation that perhaps he ran off with some illicit tryst or found himself afoul on a debt.  His replacement, a kindly, round-faced man with the somewhat amusing name of Butters, wasn’t someone Steve thought he best to ask about the dreams. So, Steve had tucked the somewhat sinister-looking belt away in a drawer, hung another cross above his bed and put a bag of herbs on the door like his mother used to, and hoped the dreams would go away on their own.
—to deal with when we Bonded,” Tony shrugged, his eyes dropping down to his lap and mouth twisting into a flat grimace.
Tony knew Steve did those things and other good works, most of it without any kind of recognition, which was how Steve wanted it.  He had never considered the why of it, beyond that Steve was a good person and good people did good things.  Now…Catholics, veterans, the hungry, the old and forgotten…he wondered how much of that was Steve trying to find some kind of connection that was missing here, that none of them could give him.  Hell, Steve probably had far more in common with the folks he visited at those places than he did with the rest of them.  Hard to find someone with shared life experiences. Wasn’t that what Natasha said Steve had answered when she asked him about finding someone?  No wonder he clung to Barnes so damn hard, Tony thought glumly.
“He has a lot of books,” Cam observed, nodding at the desk.  He didn’t touch them, just tilted his head and looked at the spines.
A vicious sort of possessiveness surged through him at the thought of the garage. It was his, from the concrete floor he'd spent days sweating over as he mixed and poured and raked it as the new layer dried, to the workstation built to his specifications, to the stupid 'bot with a foot fetish. It was his, dammit. Everything else—him, everything—belonged to Steve.
Pepper closed her eyes and took a deep breath.  “Gee, it’s almost like James took the words right out of my mouth,” Pepper ground out through clenched teeth.  “Tony,” she started again after a deep breath.  “You know Steve pretty well at this point.  You said he’s been asking you to spend time with him for months.  So, here is what you do, and I know this is going to sound crazy, but bear with me.”
“For what’s left of my dignity’s sake—which, yes, I know we’re talking needing an electron microscope to see at this point--I’d like to hang my hat on like for the moment,” Tony replied.
Still, he’d used his fingernail to crease each square on the calendar as he counted down the days, watching as horses racing across deserts became horses trundling through the snow then running through a green, flower-filled meadow.  Somewhere along the line, he’d gone from finding them nearly offensively ridiculous to having some sort of odd affection for them.  He’d never spent much time around animals, having gone right from high school into the Army, but he sometimes found himself thinking that maybe, after he got out of here and finished his probation, well.  Maybe he’d see about working on a ranch.  Stupid.  So fucking stupid, Rogers, he thought grimly, then realized he wasn’t sure if he was talking about the horses or what had happened.
A large, cushioned chair sat on a slightly raised dais in the middle of a semi-circle of smaller chairs, and next to it, a flat silk pillow atop an ottoman, festooned with fringe at each corner.  A long table filled with foods, casks of wine and pitchers of water stood to one side, where collared slaves in simple, tan robes waited to serve Tony and his entourage.  Two of them were pushing a hand crank around and around, apparently causing the long arms of the fan that hung in the center of the pavilion’s ceiling to slowly turn, sending small trails of blessed air through the pavilion.
“That’s it?  You’re just, what, sorry?  For a misunderstanding?  Whoops?” Barnes ground out.  “Sorry I ruined your life and made you feel like shit for ten years?”
Steve was staring at him.  He was sure his mouth was hanging open.  You’ll catch flies that way, Stevie, he thought to himself in his mother’s voice.  He closed it, cleared his throat and looked out at the audience of cameras and tape recorders and people who wanted an angle, no matter the cost.
Natasha and Captain Rhodes had returned at some point during the night, he noted, and Clint’s bedding was empty now. Thor was snoring lightly, and Bruce was buried under his blanket, only the top of his head visible.  Steve looked around, but couldn’t see past the first row of trees before the night swallowed the waning light of the fire.  It seemed a silly thing, now, a bad dream and nothing more, but he couldn’t quite shake the disquieted feeling.  Giving up on sleep for the moment, he pushed himself up, wincing as his back protested the action, though it wasn’t as bad as it could have been, all things considered.  Between stopping early and Bruce’s concoction, he felt better than he had the past few mornings.
“Look, forget it. Just—just forget I asked, okay? I’ve got—my lab. Things to do,” Tony rushed out, turning to go, forcing himself to modulate his steps to the elevator. Not too fast, not too slow, God it was fucking hard to find the right rhythm when he wanted to run.
“Yeah,” Steve said after a beat, squinting off into the sun, then dropping his gaze down to Tony.  His eyes were bright, but soft, and the way he was looking at Tony made Tony’s stomach do that stop, drop and roll thing.  “Yeah, I got it.”  He reached out and covered Tony’s hand where it clutched the railing, and for a flash, Tony’s eyes fell on the ring where it gleamed from Steve’s finger.  “Thank you.  I mean it, Tony.  Thank you.  You’re—you’re something else, Tony Stark, you know that, right?”
“I like it,” Tony said, looking at Steve strangely for a moment.  It made something seize up in Steve’s chest, like if he breathed, the moment would slip away.  “I like it a lot.”  He walked over and put the piece of paper down on the dresser, though, Steve noticed, he did it with care, holding it by the edges as he leaned it against the mirror, one finger tracing over the blue flowers that burst from the center.  Tony picked up his phone and watch, slung the latter onto his wrist, and then typed something on his phone before pocketing it.  Steve felt his own phone vibrate in his jacket pocket and pulled it out.  There was a message from Tony.  He shot Tony a confused look.
“So,” Rogers repeated, sucking in a deep breath and squaring his shoulders.  “Um.  Right.  So, like I said, thank you for coming here today,” Rogers began, which had the ring of a practiced speech to it.  “I wanted to meet you and—and give you the chance to meet me before we…settled on anything permanent.  I know we don’t exactly have a lot of shared life experiences, but I thought it would be a good idea to see—to see if we’re…compatible.”
He remembered always knowing not to talk about it.  Keep it hidden.  He could still see the circus wallpaper border in the doctor’s office.  There had been a blue train with a smiling face pulling grinning, brightly colored animals in puffy-barred cages behind it.   Sometimes, he could feel the sticky thin sheet of paper covering the faux leather exam table rubbing against the backs of his thighs while the doctor talked in low tones to his mother, patting her gently on the shoulder.  Consoling, he knew now.
Anto didn’t know how to explain it, so he walked over and opened the bag for Steve.  Inside was the basket Steve had made, with its grass-bear inside, a bone splinter shaped into a hook that Anto thought he would string on a small rope and hang from a pole to catch fish, if he baited it, a small corner of one of Maara’s sleeping furs, and his spear-thrower, which was what had gotten him banished all those summers ago, even though it worked, and worked far better than Clan spears, but he was Omega and Omegas didn’t use weapons, much less create them.  He watched Steve carefully, wondering what Steve would think. He didn’t know if he could give up these things, even for Steve. If Steve told him he had to leave it behind, that he couldn’t make these things, that it was wrong, that he was wrong, he thought he might just sit down and sob.
“That’s…obviously, completely ridiculous.  I know, it’s confusing, this whole evening, but, clearly, I am not the hero type,” Tony started.
“There is no correct way to feel, Tony,” Jarvis told him, leaning back and taking a sip of his coffee.  “You can’t control that.  Only what you do with those feelings.”
A pang of understanding hit Steve.  This was what Rhodes meant.  Tony was a good man, and capable of great things, but he was driven by his burdens, his fears, his guilt at what he counted as his failures, to make things better, to fix the world because he could, so he had to, and somewhere, somehow, he had lost the faith that his heart could lead them to a far better place than his hands could build.  It was a dangerous thing, though, a man such as this to be led by his heart, and how many times had Tony told him that it was a path he could not follow?
“Okay.  Okay, so…that’s settled, then.  We’re dating.  We’re exchanging keys.  We talked about kids.  That’s great.  That’s all great.  I’m just going to go back to my apartment, put all that aside and look at Pepper’s graphs for the incredibly important presentation I have tomorrow.  That should work.  No problem with that plan,” Tony said with a frustrated snort.
“You just told me that you watched the video where Steve seemed to decide that you were never going to reciprocate his feelings, or ‘like-like him’ to use your words,” Pepper stated, making air quotes with her fingers.  That one wasn’t going away any time soon.  He was fairly certain that at some future Board meeting, he was going to agree to a contract and Pepper was going to ask if he “like-liked” the contract.
Panic, snow-bright and blinding, raced down Steve’s spine and churned a whirlpool, sickeningly sweet, in his stomach.  Later, he could perhaps convince himself it was the potential disruption to his plans, but here, now, there was no thought in his mind other than a blaring, silent scream of refusal lodged in his throat like a stone.  Why had he not really considered this except in the most general way?  Was it not strange that he was just now, when presented with it, aware of the possibility that Tony would eventually want someone else, even if he continued to call for Steve?  Someone with coal-dark hair and cat-eyes like Kadina or delicate and thin-boned like Danen, someone different, someone not Steve. His stomach clenched in rebellion and a hand squeezed his heart so tightly, he thought it would burst from his chest.  Pain lanced through him.  Hurt and betrayal that he had no right to feel.  Tony wasn’t his.  There was no promise between them.  That wasn’t what this was.  A flower and a show for a malleable crowd, that was all today had been.  So, where was the relief at Tony’s suggestion?  Where was the urgency, where were the encouraging words, the sly hints or outright begging that Tony send for someone else, if only for a little while?
“If—and I mean if—something like that existed, which it doesn’t because we are nowhere near that advanced, but, I mean, if it did exist, then…then I’d be really interested in what else it could do.  That kind of power, the power to punch a hole through space and time like that--we could—it would be almost limitless, what we could do with it.  I—I’m—I mean the possibilities…” Tony trailed off shaking his head.  “I’d need to think on it for a few days.”
He looks…happy, Tony realized, the thought settling in Tony’s mind with no small amount of satisfaction.  Happy, and practically radiating a carefree brightness the sloughed all the hard edges away, and God, there were so many of those, weren’t there?  Made all the more apparent when they were temporarily brushed away.  All prickly and hard-wired and don’t-touch-me, and then underneath, this big, goofy kid who loved the dubiously named Blue Raspberry slushie and went to no small amount of effort to get Tony to talk about himself.
“Someone once told me, if you found the right star,” Steve said carefully, eyes dark, watching Tony with a strange intensity.  “If you found the right one, it would lead you home.”
The maître’d led them to their table, off to one side and against the far wall.  Heads turned as Steve passed, Tony noted.  Some of them glanced over Tony, probably wondering how the hell that happened, but most went back to their own meal and conversation.  It was strange, Tony thought, looking around.  This was the first time he’d been out with Steve, he realized. One of the first times he’d been out since they Bonded, period.
“Obviously. We still don’t know all of what Erskine’s formula can do.  As you know, he was the only success.  Many people think that was because Erskine insisted on using an Omega for his trial, but with the formula lost, we’ll probably never know for sure.  Anyway, he’s here, and he is, by rights, an Avenger, so that makes him your business, Stark,” Fury explained.
He walked over and gently cupped the perfect, supple bottom in his hand, kneading the flesh a bit. Whoever the man was, he must work out, Steve thought, then pulled a face because that sounded like some cheesy pick-up line. But, the ass was nicely rounded, yet firm, no one could deny that, he sniggered a bit, biting his lip. Must do some lifting, Steve guessed, then realized he was trying to put some kind of personality onto the man, when this was supposed to just be about anonymous pleasure. It was hard not to wonder, though. What kind of person understood this, let alone wanted it, too? There had to be only a handful. Well, Tony obviously enjoyed doing this occasionally. He’d said as much. It wasn’t hard to imagine him coming to a place like this to work out whatever went on in his head, but he—he wasn’t thinking about Tony. Not in here.
“I mean, there’s no hurry.  I could…make coffee or…some sandwiches, if you’re hungry,” Steve offered, his chest tightening in something that he would’ve called panic in any other situation.
When Steve woke, he had no memory of actually having fallen asleep, but he was curled half on Tony’s chest, and quickly realized he must have fallen asleep. He gingerly pushed himself up and blinked down at Tony, who grinned up at him, a pleased sort of half-wicked, half-dopey smile that made the corners of Steve’s mouth twitch. Tony was feeling good, he knew. This was the time to ask him to go slay a mammoth or something, Steve thought with a small chuckle.
“I’m just here for the lapel pin,” Steve said. Next to him, Tony huffed out a low laugh, but when Steve chanced a look at him, he was chewing on his lower lip, his eyes soft and warm where he was looking up at Steve in surprised amusement.
“Steve likes red,” Tony cut in.  He actually had no idea what Steve liked, but it shut her up.  “Says it looks good with my skin or something.”
“That honestly might be the best thing I’ve ever felt in my whole life,” Tony said in a breathy voice as Steve finally dropped his hands away and rinsed the soap off of them.
Steve let out a harsh, guttural cry, his own cock bobbing at Tony’s thrust leaving a smattering of white drops across Steve’s belly. “Toooonnnnyyyy…” Steve moaned. “Please.
The photos scattered on the mismatched bookshelves, images and pieces of Steve’s life, sans Tony, of course. The neat stacks of clothes, plaids and solids, nothing flashy. Piles of dog-eared books everywhere, next to the bed and lining the walls, some with the covers torn off, some with plastic over them and their Dewey decimal sticker still visible, rejects from some library. Tony got up and walked over to one of the bookshelves and ran a finger along the spines, using it to pry out a copy of The Hobbit. He flipped it open, and sure enough, his scrawled inscription was still there.
The investigators swiveled in their chairs to stare at the man. “Is this true?” What Not to Wear One asked in disbelief.
“It’s so fucking unfair,” the younger man said with an affected pout as he slid a folded twenty over to the other man.
“That’s what’s important,” Steve agreed, nodding at the man, who had already gone back to scrolling through his tablet. He spared one more look at the door to Room Six, then left, without looking back.
“My…loss,” Tony panted around sharp intakes of breath and a pained smile that was more a grimace than anything. There were flecks of blood on his lips and teeth that Steve hoped was from where he’d bitten his tongue or something equally innocuous and not internal damage about which Steve could do nothing at this point.
“Oh.  It pleases me,” Tony said harshly, then flattened his mouth and seemed to force it into a half-smile.  He shed his clothes with efficiency.  Boots first.  Shiny, soft leather ones that came up to his knees.  Then the wide leather belt and tight fitting breeches he wore.  Steve caught site of the dark swirl of hair there, cradling Tony’s stiff cock where it jutted out.  Finally, he pulled his tunic off and dropped it to the floor without a care.  He sat still for a moment, then looked down at Steve.
“Wow, this is—wow,” Steve said loudly, grinding to a halt and pulling himself up to his full height, arms spread wide and chest out.  Taking up space, or taking back space, whatever it was.  One thing dancing had taught him was how to use his body to effect.   “You’ll all have to forgive me.  I’m not used to having this much attention with my clothes on,” Steve said with a slight smile to a round of surprised laughter.  “Tony said you’d want pictures, though I think he’s a bit shy in front of the camera,” Steve continued with a knowing grin to another chorus of startled guffaws.  “You’ll have to help me out if you want a good picture of him.  Look, guys, I know you are all just trying to make a living.  Maybe you don’t exactly love the way you have to do that, but its honest work.  Not like you’re the ones creating the market for it, right?  I kind of get that,” Steve continued pointedly, earning a couple of knowing looks.  “How about we take a few pictures—heck, it is our honeymoon.  I wouldn’t mind a few things to remember it by.  We, uh, didn’t exactly plan this, you might have heard.”  That got another smattering of grudging chuckles, but they had moved back and the clicking and flashes had almost ceased once the competition part of it got taken away.  Everyone is willing to be the guy doing it until they are the only guy doing it, Steve thought.  He’d seen enough of that in his time.  “Then maybe you let these nice hotel people have their lobby back before they call the cops.  Really like to try something on my honeymoon that doesn’t involve the police.  Just for a change of pace.”
Still.  It was a yes, even if it was the most unenthusiastic ‘sounds great’ that Steve had ever heard. His heart was hammering in his chest.  He wondered if Tony could hear it.  Probably not, but it felt like he could, and suddenly, Steve was conscious of his arms, hanging at his sides with nothing to do now that Tony was holding the groceries, his body, always too big now, when he thought about it, and he was staring again, trying to drink Tony in as much as he could before the door was shut again. He sometimes felt he took up too much space in this body.  On instinct, he stepped back, putting space between them. Tony seemed to relax a bit at that, Steve noticed. Steve couldn’t really blame him.
Thank you to everyone for your support of this story!  I really, really appreciate each and every kudos and comment.  Thank you.
“The connection will linger for a short while after the Gift,” the alien told him after a considering pause.  “Then, it will fade. By the time you are back to your home, you will not feel it anymore.”
He ate a bit more, his appetite waning as his thoughts wandered.  Finally giving up, Steve dug his sketchbook and charcoals out and settled into one of the overstuffed chairs by the fireplace.  Slowly, Bucky’s face in that moment when he was staring at Nat across a snow-covered glen while seemingly indifferent to being pelted with snowballs started to take shape.
“He had a lab in New York City,” Steve gritted out.  It was an offer, Tony knew.  He could see the effort it took to just get those words out, but Steve did it, maybe because it
On the screen, Peggy was staring hard at Howard, breathing deep breaths that seemed to be doing nothing to calm her.  The room was quiet, waiting, as if the whole house had sucked in a bated breath.
“Tony’s idea of fine art involves a lot more vintage concert posters than I would like,” she said, though her voice was light and clearly affectionate. She tipped her head to the side and regarded him for a moment before continuing. “I hope you have a good evening, Mr. Rogers.”
“The Mr. Softee shirt was not because of your love of ice cream,” Steve reminded him, earning a slight shake of Tony’s head in return.  “What’s for dinner?”
“Don’t suppose you can tell me more about what you’ve got planned?”  Tony asked hopefully. The alien frowned at him, seemed to think for a moment on it, and then pointed at the helmet and back to the panel on the side of the table, giving Tony a somewhat helpless look.  “Too hard to translate, huh?” Tony guessed, nodding. The interface with JARVIS the alien had concocted had to be fairly rudimentary, considering, and mostly seemed capable of repeating things Tony had already said, even if it could seem to contextualize them. Probably not capable of detailed, abstract explanations.
Tony was quiet then, and Steve could almost feel the other man’s muscles going liquid as the morphine took effect.  Tony slumped a bit against Steve’s chest, like he’d been trying to hold himself up a bit and finally gave up.  “Anything,” Tony said, and it took Steve a minute to catch the thread of conversation.  “You could say anything, and it would be fine.  If you just, you know.  Wanted to talk.  Or something.”
He waited. Paced for a bit, then sat down with a slight wince. It seemed to take a long time, but when he saw the time counting by on his phone, it was really only about ten minutes before the woman’s voice came back onto the line.
He could practically hear Bucky’s laughter in the background.  He wasn’t good at this stuff under normal conditions.  In this situation?  He was hopeless.
“No know word.  Feels right,” Tony agreed, cocking his head to one side.  Steve burst out laughing. Tony couldn’t help but join him.  He wasn’t sure what was funny, but he liked the rumble of Steve’s chest as he laughed and the way his eyes crinkled at the edges and he seemed to make the sound with his whole body all at once.
Tony sighed heavily, hands flexing into fists where they hung at his sides.  There was wrong and then there was completely fucked-up and pulling the stripper with a hero-complex into this mess of a plan was definitely tilting firmly towards the latter, Tony had to admit to himself.  He glanced over at Pepper, who caught his look and started to open her mouth, then snapped it closed again, teeth worrying at her bottom lip instead.
Shaking himself, Steve turned back to look down the road with a frown. The wind moved through the sparse line of trees, making their branches rustle, and somewhere, a nighthawk called out, announcing its kill, but otherwise, the road was silent behind him.  No pounding footsteps.  No warning slap of leather against a palm. No shouts for him to go back there or it would be worse.  Just silence.
Slowly, he reached out and wrapped his fingers around the hard shell, drawing it to his chest.  He opened his fist and stared down at it for a moment.  Such a tiny, innocuous-looking thing to hold so much.  Possibility.  Potential.  Hope.  God, so much hope.
.  Jesus, wow, that is---that is seriously...please bend over and pick up the water bottle, please bend over and pick up--thank you, yes, bless, there is a God, and She is going to give the gays everything they want.  Rhodey, you’re amazing, you found quarantine porn,” Tony grinned, peeling his face back from the binoculars long enough to catch Rhodey shaking his head and rubbing at his forehead.
Maybe that was all Tony meant by liking him.  Maybe Tony just wanted a little fun before he saved the world and got back to his real life where he wasn’t tied to a stripper and babysitting said stripper’s slightly-less-than-charming best friend.  Maybe he was just humoring Steve, or being nice or letting the poor schlub who needed to cooperate in order for Tony’s whole world-saving plan to work down gently.  All of those seemed a lot more likely than Tony Stark developing feelings for someone like Steve over the few days they’d known each other, Steve had to admit.
“Fine,” Steve said after a long moment where he seemed caught between wanting to argue and begrudgingly agreeing with the logic.  “Thank you, Tony,” he added with a slight sigh.  He rubbed at his forehead with one hand, then gave Tony a lopsided smile.  “Do you always get your way?”
“Well. That should be fun for everyone,” Steve deadpanned, then shook his head and looked to the ceiling as if in silent plea.
Tony was jealous?  Of Bucky?  That made no sense.  Why?  Where in the world would he even get such an idea about Bucky?  Because of the stories Steve told?
“I—I’m sorry.  I wasn’t expecting…you just caught me off-guard, that’s all,” Tony said, looking down at the black box in his lap.  “I’m not—I told you, I’m not good with gifts.  It’s really…it’s…this is…”  he stopped, opening up the box, really looking at what he was holding, seeing something other than a not-Rolex for the first time.
“So…do we have a deal, then?” Obie asked from Tony’s side.  There was a tremor in his voice.  Only slight, but a rare enough sound that Tony welcomed it.  The man looked over at Obie, lip curling into a sneer and said something low in a foreign tongue that Tony couldn’t understand.
They made their way into the house, the front doors opening with a key somehow.  It was just as impressive from the inside.  But what caught Steve’s attention was the art.  All over the place.  Paintings, sculptures, photographs, many he recognized or at least knew the style well enough to come close and these…these weren’t prints.  These were the real thing.  Tony walked over to the bar and poured himself another drink.  He held up the decanter in silent question to Steve, but Steve shook his head, barely turning away from the Jackson Pollack in front of him.  He’d never thought to see one of these outside a museum.  And here it was.  In a hallway of the house owned by the guy who was paying him for sex.  Well, that thought brought some much needed clarity.
Steve, and his box of memories, and his terrible life that he managed to be happy with, and didn't that fucking hurt like a sonofabitch? If Steve had wanted the money more than Tony, why so God-damned fine with how everything worked out? Why the gushing...pride—and God, did that not make sense, but there it was—pride over the Tower? None of it made sense. From the first moment he encountered Steve on the street, the whole thing had been wildly off-script, and no one, not Nat or Barnes or even Thor, seemed to be playing their parts.
“Thanks,” Steve replied, mouth ticking up at the corners, clearly somewhat thrown by Tony’s momentary lapse into good manners.  “Ready to go?”
“Fine,” Tony said, glancing quickly at Rhodes before looking back at Steve.  “We’re fine. Just not used to being up this high.”
Steve hummed his surrender and slid the suspenders off one arm, giving Tony what he meant to be a suggestive glance and which turned into something more like a genuine laugh than anything sexy, not that Tony seemed to mind.  Tony was leaning back on the too-big bed with his hands splayed behind him, his shoeless foot tapping out the rhythm as Steve mimicked the move with the other arm. His hair was a mess, his shirt halfway untucked and the collar open, and he was bouncing a little, like he just couldn’t quite manage both quiet
“I wasn’t sure you were going to come,” Stark said, drawing Steve’s attention.  Stark grimaced, squelching up his face. “I’m lying. That’s a lie. Made you an offer you couldn’t refuse, all that,” he added, waving a hand in the air and taking another drink.  “Thought we’d just get all this out of the way up front,” he explained with a shrug.  “I get it. No judgment, by the way. It’s a rational call. Definitely the one most people would make. Rational for me, too, when you think about it.”
“Well, isn’t that a coincidence?  I’m sort of finding myself looking for where Tony got off to these days, as well,” Stane replied, walking around the bar and placing himself between Steve and the door, standing just a little too close, a little too much in Steve’s personal space for it not to be deliberate.  When Stane smiled, it was all teeth.  Steve felt something shift in the room, something that said leave, as clearly as if JARVIS had shouted it.
He sat down in one of the big, black chairs and waited. The tabletop was polished to a high gloss, reflecting bright circles of the overhead lights like strange, glowing eyes.  Frowning, he got up and walked over to stand in front of one of the tall windows, clasping his hand behind his back. The stance always soothed him. It was still an attention position, but stand at ease could be executed from this position, and standing like this, it always made him think that could be what was next, even if it almost never was.  At ease. That could be what was next.
it.   Loved it in some visceral, grasping way he couldn’t quite understand.  Maybe because it was the first gift he’d gotten that was for him, not given to him to nudge him to try to be someone else, he thought, looking askance at the jars of face cream, lotions, and lines of colognes his mother insisted he bring with him when he moved in with Steve.
“I know you would, Tony.  Doesn’t mean I want you down here with me,” Steve husked out, dropping his gaze to where one hand clutched the stair railing.  “If I loved you...that’s the last place I’d want you to be.”
Tony’s eyes snapped open as he felt a hot burst of air chase away the cold, heating the length of his cock.  Then a brush of material and an even deeper heat as Steve mouthed at Tony’s cock through his boxers.
“We’re supposed to have a debrief with Fury in the morning about the thing with the Doombots.  And Ms. Potts told me on my way up here that I was to tell you that nothing in the world would make me happier than if you went to the, let’s see…” Steve said, grabbing his discarded and soon to be trashed Dockers and digging a small notebook out of his pocket.  “The annual R&D grant awards banquet tomorrow afternoon.”
“Want to feel you.  Please, Steve.  Please.  Need you,” Tony chanted, gasping, each word sounding like it was punched out of him on his last breath.  Steve leaned down to kiss him again, hard and brutal this time, all pretense gone.  Tony lifted his hips, grinding against Steve as best he could.  He jerked in surprise when he felt Steve’s fingers graze the rim of his hole, circling it and spreading the slick around before pushing down the line of his ass, gathering more slick and pressing into the delicate skin there. Tony’s vision whited for a moment as Steve’s fingers massaged the spot behind his balls, and his whole body went rigid before seeming to dissolve into liquid heat.
“Why aren’t we friendless and alone?” Tony asked the room, tossing up his hands in frustration as he broke apart from Steve. He craned his head around Steve’s shoulders and shot Rhodes an annoyed look.
“Show me,” Tony said again.  His voice was surprisingly steady this time, and he had a moment to feel proud of that before Steve’s other hand found the back of his neck again, pressing forward hard enough to force it into a bend.  Tony’s vision swam for a moment, the world righted, and he let his eyes flutter shut as waves of want and need and heat flooded through his body, settling with an unyielding pressure that worked its way through his belly, tightened his balls and built at the base of his cock into a pulsing drumbeat.   Another flush of slickness leaked out of his loose hole.  It should probably embarrass him,  Tony thought rather dimly, but he felt Steve’s hand spasm on his neck and shuddered at the feeling of being held, so tightly and safely and with such care, it was hard to explain, this feeling of deep, aching belonging that always came when Steve touched him like this.
“You’re a hopeless romantic with delusions of grandeur,” Tony said.  “Glass Slipper?  Really?  I’m the son of an erstwhile-billionaire, give or take a few Federal charges, who likes to fuck strangers for money and emotional avoidance, not exactly Cinder-fucking-ella, here.”
He sighed deeply when Tony’s mouth left him and his body pulled away, missing the solid warmth, but stayed as he was.  He was wholly unprepared for Tony to bend over and swallow down the length of his cock in one swift motion.  Steve’s hips bucked wildly without any conscious thought on his part, and that probably should’ve ended that right then and there, but Tony rode it out, relaxing his throat and letting the base of Steve’s cock tap against the very back of it, before Steve managed to control himself enough to stop.fucking.moving.  He looked down to see Tony’s s kiss-swollen lips wrapped around his cock, moving up and down, sucking lightly.  Tony’s eyes were closed, his face a mix of rapture and concentration.  Steve felt the flat of Tony’s tongue along the underside of his shaft and forced himself not to move his hips again, but then Tony swirled his tongue around the tip and applied even more suction and Steve found his hands were gripping Tony’s hair without any memory of putting them there.  Tony was moving faster now, up and down, loosing him out so only the head of his cock sat buried inside Tony’s mouth, then swallowing him back down again.  He felt Tony moan around him, the vibrations thrumming through his cock and he heard himself make some sound between a gasp and a sob.  Tony hollowed out his cheeks and began sucking furiously, working his tongue up and down the slit on head of Steve’s cock.  Steve was undone, coming apart at the seams.  Everything had been reduced to a single point, a single sensation, just Tony’s mouth around him, all warm, wet heat and suction.  He forced his fingers to let go of their grip on Tony’s hair and tried to push him away.  “T-T-Tony…Tony, stop, I’m going…I’m almost there, Tony…please, God, just…” he choked out, mind blanking on anything more.  But Tony didn’t release him, if anything, just took him deeper and sucked even harder.  Steve’s head tipped back, vision blacked out, whole body going taunt as a bowstring, hips jerking unevenly and felt the warm rush as he came, spilling himself down Tony’s throat.
The guards at the security desk nodded to Steve as they passed through the metal detector, which beeped when Tony went through, probably from his phone or belt, though no one made a move to do anything about it.  Tony supposed the guards either didn’t figure he was a threat or didn’t want to attempt to explain the need for a pat-down to Steve.  Tony almost grinned at that thought, and tossed a look over his shoulder at the guards. They weren’t looking at him, of course.  He could probably walk in with a rocket launcher and get nothing more than a stern look.
“No, no, not---not like that.  I mean,” Tony broke off, sucking in a shaky breath and twisting in his seat to look at Steve.  “I’m not—I’m not saying this right.  Everyone there, everyone, was part of this roadshow thing.  Me, Rhodey, the generals out there toasting our partnership.  None of it was real, until it was. Way, way too real.  Not much in my life had been particularly real up to that point.  So, I was sitting there, with my arm in a sling and Rhodey playing nurse in the non-fun way, and I thought about that.  What you said.  And I kind of hated you in that moment, a little, I think.  Looking down your nose at me, all self-righteous and sure of what you were seeing when you looked at me, because I wasn’t that person, except neither of us knew it.  None of what happened was
Steve let out a breath, put his hands on his hips and looked off towards the tiny kitchenette, where Tony could hear a small refrigerator humming and could just make out a toaster oven with two burners on top and a microwave on the counter.  Packages of ramen noodles were stacked by flavor next to a smattering of crackers in small packages that seemed to have come from a restaurant where someone foolishly put them out for patrons to help themselves.
“Plenty of better ways to raise the heartrate,” Tony retorted, then looked back over at Steve in the seat next to him. “So.  That went a little off-script back there.”
None of this, since he woke up, cold and panicked and sure that Hydra was behind this somehow, had made any sense.  Except that now his whole body was telling him that it made complete sense, and for a moment, he let himself keep that, enjoy the peace that came with it, let it whiteout everything that had been filling his head, the fear, the noise, the uncertainty, the aching maw of grief that seemed to get bigger with each new discovery, like it was a step away from something every time he learned to navigate a part of this new world.  For just a moment, he allowed himself the pleasure of giving in to this, letting those burdens slough off his shoulders, because everything was going to be okay now.  His Alpha would take care of him, would take all of this from him, and they would be happy, and--
Shellhead cocked his head at him, his face going thoughtful for a moment while he watched Steve eat and used his powerful tentacles to push the boat along.   The crab was actually pretty tasty, Steve could admit. He shoved another bite of the sweet, tender meat into his mouth, and grinned at Shellhead as he wiped the juice from his chin.  Shellhead rolled his eyes, but looked back at Steve, his face soft and pleased, like watching Steve eat was some kind of thrill. Steve told him about Scott, about how he had gotten caught breaking in to some fancy house uptown and been offered the choice of prison or the Army and decided to “volunteer” for the Army,  a choice he had lamented quite often.
Tony was talking.  Of course he was, Steve thought with a familiar fondness attached to the knowledge.  It sounded oddly distant, but it seemed to slowly get louder, as if Tony was approaching from afar, and then, suddenly, he was right there, next to Steve, all warm, sweat-slick skin and damp curls of hair pressing against his temples.
of a grip,” Stane said, withdrawing his hand and giving his limp wrist a slight shake and staring at Steve with a shrewd, narrow-eyed gaze.   “Well, I should let you two get inside,” Stane said after a moment. “Secretary Pierce will cancel our contracts if I monopolize you.”
“Yeah, but…” Steve began, then shook his head and wiped a hand over his mouth.  “Come on, you--you definitely don’t need to pay for...anything. Let alone...an, ah, evening with some random guy you just met, so why...why this? Why me?”
What if he just walked over right now and kissed Tony, leaning there against the rail, all sun-warmed, his hair a bit mussed from the winds that came down off the mountains and swept over the desert?  Would Tony melt into him, like he had before, all sweet and soft, or would it be something else this time, something a bit darker, a bit rougher, knowing they both wanted it, whatever their reasons and whatever that meant?
“A few.  Maybe.  Nothing dramatic,” Tony assured him.  “Expand some product lines, diversify, that kind of thing.”  Stop speaking. Seriously, just stop speaking.  Why is it so hard?  Dead best friend.  Dead best friend, Tony chanted.  Tony had already screwed up once today by running his mouth when he could’ve just shut up.  He wasn’t going to do it again.  He wasn’t.  He—“We have way too many resources committed to production of old lines and not nearly enough invested in R&D.”  Dammit.  So close.
“It’s where you belong, Steve,” Bucky continued, voice going low and hushed. “It’s where you’ve always belonged.”
It was innocuous-sounding enough, but Steve couldn’t quite dislodge the sense of wrongness that seemed to cling to the man.   What manner of man lived surrounded by things such as these, in this place, all alone?  Who could appear out of thin air and walk silently when his boots should announce him on the stone floor?  No manner of man that Steve knew, whatever name the man might call himself. It wasn’t as if demons simply announced themselves by use of their infernal name, did they?  Steve remembered that much from the sermons.  They named themselves friend, helper, faithful servant.
“I need to work on some of this paperwork, Tony,” Ms. Potts announced.  “For the recent transaction,” she added through her teeth, then gave Steve a bright smile.  “Press conference Saturday, so tomorrow, you two have the night off for rehearsal.  I don’t want any surprises, and Matt will be here to go over the legal phrasing we want you to use, just basic stuff, don’t worry.  Mr. Barnes, I know you have an appointment tomorrow morning, and particularly since Mr. Stark is going with you, it’s very important to remember—”
“I don’t care,” Tony said, realizing it was true.  “I don’t.  Whatever it is, it doesn’t matter.  The—the car, and France and the kitchen counter…It doesn’t—none of that needs to
Brock got out his lucky deck of cards and small wooden poker chip carousel, which he added to the table. The others gathered around, the soft snicks of beer bottles opening echoing one after the other.  Steve put one of the bowls of chips on the table and took a seat, nursing a slightly warm beer.  Griff turned on the television and signed into Brock’s pornhub account, scrolling through the choices until he found something that, from what Steve could tell, fell into the ‘there’s something here for everyone’ category.  Steve turned his back to the TV and took a sip of his beer, while the occasional moan and slap of skin faded into background noise as Brock dealt the first hand.
“Tony,” Steve said somewhat admonishingly, his mind wandering back to the stones.  Tony had been oddly quiet since then, particularly by the standards for talking that Tony usually set.  “You saw something. Didn’t you?”
But then there was this guy and he was touching Steve and she’d said, “Only what you are ok with.  Only what you agree to beforehand,” and had he agreed to this?  He couldn’t seem to remember, all rational thought having left around the time the guy he’d met twenty minutes ago started grabbing his cock and rubbing like there was a wish-granting genie on the horizon.  He gripped the door handle, not sure what his plan was there, just glad to have some means of escape in his hand as panic set in.
For that one moment, Steve let himself bask in it, that warm glow of hope and happiness, before reality crashed back down.
Steve stared at the dark shape, then looked away, towards the windows, where the circle of silver moon filled the glass.
“This way,” Ms. Potts instructed in a clipped tone, barely looking at him and instead, scanning the lobby over his shoulder.  It took Steve a moment to realize that she was probably looking for reporters, though if she spotted any, they weren’t obvious to Steve.  She handed Steve a keycard and nodded towards the elevator.  “Do you have any questions about the NDA or anything else, Mr. Rogers?”
“I hope you aren’t suggesting I’d have to be crazy to marry this guy?  I mean, look at him,” Tony pointed out, clapping his arm around Steve’s shoulder.  It sounded like a joke. Most of the room laughed. Maybe Steve was the only one who could hear the undercurrent of annoyance because Tony was sitting right next to him.  “Not to mention, and I’m sure you know this from the lovely press briefing my assistant circulated, but Steve is a highly-decorated Army Captain, has more degrees than just about anyone in this room who isn’t me or Colonel Rhodes, speaks like seven languages, and is an amazing artist.  Okay, that last part wasn’t in your briefing, but I’ve seen a sketch from his, uh, blue period, and he’s really good.”
“Judge?  Judge says bullshit,” Tony replied smoothly.  “Take your time.  I think Bachelorette Number 3 is probably going to hurl her tiara at you if we don’t hurry, but I got all night.”
keep the armor sloped enough to deflect your projectiles,” the King murmured, drawing out the word.  “So, something more like this, then,” he said, holding up a different piece of parchment with a far more conical design, which he had clearly already drawn with the issue in mind.  “Ah, good,” the King said, hopping up all of a sudden.  “Small hands.  You, here,” he said, pointing at the gear next to the large wheel base.
Cam was a fast learner, no surprise.  After Steve explained the basics, they tried a practice game to let Cam get a feel for the board, and then began in earnest with Steve offering the occasional bit of coaching advice as Cam moved his pieces.  Steve was leaning over, reaching for his Bishop when a hand closed over his.
“You’re sure?” Tony pressed, seeing assurance.  “You’ll really be okay? And you’re really okay with this?  I’m not like, intruding on your fortress of solitude schtick here, am I? You’d tell me, right?  I mean, I feel like, at a minimum--and I don’t say this to many one-night stands, believe me--but, I think we should really be able to share, you know?”
“Yeah, you sound it,” Steve said with a roll of his eyes.  It wasn’t an objection, so that was something, Tony told himself.
By the time he made his car, his hands were numb with cold, and there were flecks of barely-formed ice in his hair and melting along the shoulders of his coat.  He turned the car on and pushed the temperature up as far as it would go, then pulled his phone out of his pocket and texted Pepper with a simple ‘Done,’ trusting that she’d know what he meant.
“Good looking guy,” Stark commented, though there was something about the way he said it that made Steve frown slightly.  He remembered seeing photos of Stark with various men over the years, so he knew Stark wasn’t judging him or anything, though maybe Brock just wasn’t Stark’s type, who knew?
“Mr. Rogers…I hate to interrupt your guest with my lecture, but may I continue now?” the professor asked smartly.
“Kinda the point, soldier,” Tony shrugged. He didn’t seem particularly offended, accepting the rejection with an air of equanimity.
At some point between Steve getting his hands on Tony’s nipples and his cock, Tony had sped up the thrusts of his fingers, spreading them apart and stretching Steve’s hole.  It burned with a pleasant ache, but it wasn’t painful at all, and there was a steady build of pressure deep inside him, behind his cock, beating in time with the pulse of Tony’s fingers. He felt loose and open, more open than he had ever been, and he wanted to be filled. Needed it.
Anto looked up at Tyber, his eyes pleading.  “I’ll be good,” he signed. “I promise. Please.  Please let him go. Don’t hurt him. I’ll be good, I swear it, Tyber, please.”
Steve walked back over to the cot and sat down heavily.  He could hear the rusted metal springs creak beneath him and wondered if they weren’t both going to end up on the floor, fighting tetanus on top of everything else, but the ground was cold and the temperature was dropping, and he wasn’t going to mention the two of them breaking the bed to Tony because…because he just didn’t want it to be a joke.  Best not to think much about that, he thought dully.
Tony looked down at the papers with dawning horror.  The top of the first page blared the words Restraining Order in dark, bold letters.
wanted it, for his own reasons, even if they weren’t the reasons Steve would have liked, then…then that would…that would be okay, Steve told himself.  If Tony wanted this, even if he didn’t want Steve. If he wanted this, that would be okay.
Tony watched through the glass for a minute longer, something warm and familiar settling itself in his chest.  He typed the code into the panel and the door whooshed open.  Steve looked over his shoulder and smiled in greeting.
“Steve, if you don’t tell me what is going on right now, I swear—” Tony broke off, sucking in a shaky breath.  He hadn’t realized how scared he had been or how terrified he was now until that moment.  He wasn’t sure he wanted to hear whatever it was that Steve was going to say.  Clearly, he didn’t know everything about his husband, not the way he thought he had.  He was too confused and scared to be angry, but the anger was there, pushing at the edges.  “Just tell me. Please.  Whatever it is.  I just—I need you to tell me what’s going on.”
“Steve worries,” Tony said, turning his head to look over his shoulder. He caught Steve’s eye, of course. Smiled.
“I always want you,” Steve told him simply, watching Tony blink rapidly, then run a hand over his face.
Steve looked over at Mitchell and the rest of them sitting around the table, then back at Brock.  I don’t even like these people, Steve thought with absolute clarity.
Steve smiled behind his veil, enjoying their easy banter.  He liked Bruce. Bruce was smart and, more importantly, he was kind, Steve thought.  Tony liked him, too, Steve could readily tell. Tony was...unguarded with Bruce the way he couldn’t seem to let himself be with a lot of people.   Steve didn’t know all of their shared history, not yet, but he knew they had known each other for years, and Tony had once helped Bruce when he ran afoul of some minor Lord in some kind of disturbance that apparently arose after General Ross forbade his daughter from accepting Bruce’s proposal. It was, Steve thought to himself as he looked up through the thick boughs of trees above to the pale, blue sky that peeked through, almost like Tony became someone else when he could manage to avoid the need to be who he was, as if a mask slipped off and the real Tony could be suddenly revealed.
“I would…be delighted to have a drink with you, Steve Rogers,” Tony said with a small, enigmatic smile.
“Well, you have good taste,” Tony grinned.  He stepped forward until their chests were touching again and ran his hands over Steve’s chest, palms grazing gently over Steve’s nipples, though as sensitive as they were, Steve couldn’t help sucking in a sharp breath.  Tony gave him a look, then repeated the motion, humming lightly as he did.  “You’ve talent, too.  Raw, perhaps, but there.  Biased as I might be, I am not wrong. Pepper was quite impressed, in fact, and she is far more knowledgeable about art than I am, or so she tells me, and as I make it a point never to argue with her,” Tony said with a small shrug.  “I’ll send for a tutor.  One of the Enclaves will be delighted to spare one of its instructors for the Royal household.”
“They would have kept you from me, Steve, you must know that. Stane and the rest of them. They would have wanted you dead,” Tony said tightly. He didn’t need to define who ‘they’ were. Stane and the rest of them had once wielded enough power to do exactly that, Steve was well aware, but the possibility of death, even if he had fully understood the threat then, had never been what kept him away. “You must stop blaming yourself for a fault that was never yours.”
He quirked his mouth to the side as he chewed on the inside of his cheek. The other explanation, the other, rather obvious explanation, was...well, okay,maybe it was ego, but he hadn't really considered that Steve wouldn't actually want him like that. All Alphas wanted Omegas, right? That was...just how things worked. Alphas needed to knot, and Omegas needed to be knotted. Screwdriver was just a fucked-up, useless, hammer-wannabe without a screw, after all.
“Tony, what… what’s going on? Come on, you can tell me,” Steve said, frown deepening as he came to stand by Tony. He reached out and placed his hands on Tony’s shoulders, giving him a little shake.
“Forget it.  Forget it,” Howard said, shaking his head.  “It’s Christmas, right?  Tony, what do you say to your Uncle?” Howard prompted.
“You think!?!” Tony demanded with a grimace as the stars in front of him spun and danced and debris floated like a trail of very deadly breadcrumbs.  “See if you can reroute the power and pin down--wait--wait,” he broke off, looking out the window as his stomach heaved and rolled against the forces propelling the ship into a hard, diving spin.  “Can you lock down the stabilizers, J? Feels like I’m on the world’s least fun Gravitron.”
“So how about a smile, then, huh?  Come on, it’s gonna be a walk in the park, I’m telling you.  And then we’re set, Steve. You and me, you hear?  Easy street from here on. Hey, sweetheart,” Brock called out to the waitress, “how about another drink?  And one for my guy, here.  We’re celebrating.”
“Yes.  But, I’ll know,” Steve replied.  Coulson’s mouth twitched up at the corners, which pretty much accounted for a smile in Steve’s experience with the man.
“Well.  You.  See, you can’t just say stuff like that and expect me to walk away!  Doesn’t work that way.
He turned away from the mirror and surveyed the empty room.  His bed was made. The corners of the blanket were neatly tucked in with a pristine edge.  The dishes were put away. Nothing sat on top of his dresser or the kitchen counter, except a coffee pot that was fancier than most of the planes he’d flown in the war and toaster he didn’t use.  It was loud when the toast popped up, he’d found on his first try, but then he hadn’t wanted to ask for a different one and be forced to explain why, so it just sat there. It was almost time for his meeting.  He didn’t have to look at the clock to know, but Anthony’s picture was still there, so he walked over and picked it up by the edges.
Steve curled his hands around the cup of tea, letting the warmth seep into his hands.  His fingertips were always cold, that was the problem.  He blew on the curls of steam that wafted up, then took a sip of the bitter brew, making a face. Why did things that were supposed to help you always taste horrible?  Peggy would say it was so the kids didn’t get into it, but she used to add honey to their medicine, or sugar if they had any, so Steve wasn’t sure she really meant it.  Besides, there weren’t any kids around here now, not unless Lizzie or William brought theirs by, and they certainly weren’t sniffing around his medicines if they were.  The problem was, the tea tasted terrible, but sweeter, if you added anything to it.  The doctor thought it would help, though, and Lizzie worried, so Steve drank the damn tea.
He stared at the phone, then slowly put it in his pocket and turned around, walking on unsteady feet back to the garage.  Steve was hurt.  Badly enough for Coulson to feel obligated to call.  Tony was supposed to sit here and wait for an update.
“You are too kind, Ul-Tarn, and such beauty is certainly hard to resist, but, as you can see, I have the Raj’Inama to keep me company,” Tony replied, placing a hand on Steve’s arm where it sat on the table between them. Steve hadn’t realized that he had stopped breathing until he felt Tony’s touch and forced himself to slowly let out a long hiss of air. “I am sure they will find many to serve back in the city.”
Steve’s hand spasmed where it gripped Tony’s waist.  He sucked in a short snap of air, and jerked his hand away from its place on Tony’s hip, slipping out from between Tony and the sink and walking to their small dining table.  When Tony looked up, Steve had his hands on his hips and was looking across the room, where the mantle clocked chimed the half hour, breaking whatever spell had temporarily put Hormones at the Control Console in his brain’s headquarters.
He’d told Steve once, a long time ago in a white, too-bright hospital room at SHIELD, that maybe, sometimes, it was okay—better than okay, really, okay didn’t even begin to capture what it was—if Steve needed him like that sometimes, but he hadn’t quite known then what he meant by the offer.  Now, though…now.  Now, he knew what it was like to be consumed, utterly and completely. To belong to his Alpha. To be taken.  Held down and used, brutally and wonderfully, and fuck, dammit, he was going to come, and Steve was probably still stuck somewhere on I-93, regretting his decision not to listen to Tony about the jet pack.
It was quiet for a long stretch before he heard Bucky shift on his pallet and roll to face him across the tent. “You’ve got to stop trying to earn something that you already have, Steve. There’s nothing left to fight against. But you’ve got plenty to fight for.”
