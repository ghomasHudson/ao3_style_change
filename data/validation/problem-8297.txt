not your problem anymore. Isn’t that why you left? To not have to deal with this kind of shit anymore?”
“Steve,” Sam said, gently placing a hand on his shoulder, “that’s not what this is about. We wanted to talk to you to see if you were okay and to let you know that we’re here for you. This is a shit situation, and we aren’t here to say ‘I told you so’. We know how much Tony means to you and we’re bummed that things took such a crazy turn.”
“That home, the one with my parents? Nowhere I want to be. My real home is here, with you and Cora and my friends. I don’t want to leave any of you, but my dad’s an insistent asshole who always seems to get his way no matter what.”
Steve dramatically threw himself face first into Bucky’s couch, and began to sulk. The more he thought about this Halloween party, the more worried he became. Tony had never extended an invitation to one of his holiday parties before, so why now? Steve didn’t want to think so little of his colleague, but a big part of him was terrified that this was all a plan for Tony to embarrass him in some way.
“Yeah...I think I’d like that,” Tony answered, feeling something well up inside of him that he tried to ignore.
“Bold of you to assume I wouldn’t find a way to become superintendent of this entire district just to have the ability to dock your pay,” Tony said, taking a seat on the arm of Steve’s chair.
“Don’t you?”
not ta open da door ta strangers,” Cora huffed.
Tony quickly noticed that not only was Steve laying on his sweater, but he'd gotten cum on it as well. Seeing that in addition to feeling Steve’s hole flutter throughout his orgasm was enough to push Tony over the age.
"Wha...what's that?" Steve asked, barely above a whisper.
“Sorry,” he offered, smoothing his hands over her shoulders, “look, Steve and I are just
“Wow...well hello Captain tall, blond and sexy!”
Steve understood where Pepper was coming from. Had he been on the other end of this breakup, he was certain Natasha would be giving Tony the same speech. He got why she was doing this, but that didn’t make it any less terrifying. Pepper seemed like a very proper and polished woman, but he knew better than to underestimate a threat like that coming from her.
“Pepper, I am so over this,” Tony huffed, exasperated, as he dropped his backpack by the table before falling onto the couch. Pepper was a sophomore and a year ahead of him. She had a nice suite on campus; the exact opposite Tony’s twelve-by-twelve concrete box of a dorm room.
“I’m just not sure if I should be worried that you have Pepper’s number, or thankful,” Tony spoke, looking over Cora once more to see just how happy she was now. Bucky just swung his arm around Tony’s shoulder, pulling him closer.
Steve stood in front of the mirror adjusting his navy blue gingham button down for the hundredth time. He looked over everything: his hair, his shirt (again), his pants and his shoes. He felt ridiculous being
“Something on your mind?”
The day had finally come; it was New Years Eve and Tony was going to take Steve on the most perfect date imaginable. He’d been beside himself since finding out that Peggy would be able to watch after Cora for them. The only thing that got him through his horrible Christmas holiday was knowing that, come New Years Eve, he’d have Steve all to himself.
“Says you! You weren’t there, Tony, you didn’t see the blood lust in their eyes!”
“Well… where’s home?” Steve asked, trying to remain patient.
Steve stole a glance at Tony in that moment. Though the brunet was looking down as he talked, hands in his pockets, he had a look of pride, determination and happiness on his face. It nearly broke Steve’s heart to think of what life must have been like for Tony during his battle with alcoholism, but seeing the man he was now, the man who overcame his addiction, made his heart swell with admiration.
“I’m just going to use the restroom quickly before our waiter comes. When they do, can you order me a lemon water, please?”
Tony smiled at Pepper, as he stood to leave. He gave a small wave before walking back to his office. Once there, Tony ran a hand through his hair and sighed. This was a huge mess he was in, and Tony had absolutely no idea how he was going to get himself out of it.
“Literally, every time you screw up, you invite us over here, make carbonara and ask us for help. This is like the fifth time it’s happened!”
Steve looked down at his shake with a shy smile as Tony and Peter began talking about something relating to the physics classroom. For the following two days, Steve tried not to get too in his head about it all, but with every passing conversation between him and the brunet, where they’d sort out bits and pieces of their day, Steve grew more and more nervous. Now that the day was here, he felt like he could burst with happiness and puke all at once.
Once they pulled away, Tony found himself breathless.
“Yeah. What did you think I was going to do?” Tony asked, readjusting himself on the bed and giving Steve’s cock a few quick strokes.
“Hey, Nat...what’s up?” Tony asked, somewhat disappointed by who he found in front of him.
“But…”
“Honey, please, I really need you to eat your peas, okay?”
“I say fuck it, let’s have the best Christmas hang this town’s ever seen!”
“Listen, Pep, the right time just hasn’t come up…”
“So you’re looking for advice on how to deal with him being attracted to you?”
Steve thought as he was on his run. It seemed like every relationship he’d been in was nothing but him getting ahead of himself and ending up tripping into heartache. He wanted to think this time would be different, but every other time had been different...until they all ended up exactly the same way. It was just so hard for Steve to rein it in when it came to having someone to love, and having someone to love
“This is just a thing that Tony does. He’s got a lot of money so he just likes to tip really well when he can,” Steve rationalized. Clint gave him a disbelieving look, but shrugged.
Once Natasha left, Tony sat with his head in his hands for several minutes. He didn’t have it in him to look through the information that Nat’s friends had found, but he knew better than to just sit on this for too long.
After that, it was all Steve could do to not make himself look like a lovesick idiot around Tony. He hadn’t been able to hide his new crush from his friends, but maybe, just maybe, he’d be able to hide it from the object of his affections.
“Yeah, that’d be nice, but first...I have something to show you.,” the blond answered, standing to pull out his wallet.
Steve considered the question for a moment. He slowly placed a hand on his belly, a gesture he had started doing when nervous or unsure.
“Bruce, I just… I’ll stop, okay? Honest, I will. It’s just that he’s so happy while he’s there. No matter who comes in, no matter how stressed he seems to get, he always seems so happy when he’s serving people. I miss that happiness in my life.”
“Brucie!” Tony exclaimed, going to give his friend a hug. “Fancy meeting you here.”
Natasha asked taking a seat at her desk. Steve couldn’t help but ring his hands in his lap. He hadn’t told anybody about his feelings for Tony and as accepting as he knew people in the 21st century were he still had his doubts.
“Alright. Now, Coraline.”
Rhodey perked up at that. “Oh? I didn’t realize you were looking for an assistant coach. I’ve got a little more free time outside of the Marine Corps JROTC than I did last year; I would have stepped up if you needed the help.” He said, reaching for the glass of water the waiter had just placed on the table, and giving a nod in silent thanks.
“Um…I was just on my way to the workshop.”
The first thing he thought of was Tony. He imagined the man on top of him , moving within him and and working his cock. Steve could see the look of lustful determination on the man’s face as he worked the blond closer and closer. Steve began to thrust upward into his hand and downward onto the vibrator in time with the man in his fantasy. Suddenly, he imagined Tony leaning down to whisper in his ear.
Tony let out a growl that practically shook the room. Everyone in the club went silent, turning to look at the spectacle taking place. “You have ten seconds to back the fuck off
Steve pulled back to look Tony up and down before giving a shrug. “Ehh, you’re alright, I suppose,” he deadpanned. Tony barked out a laugh before throwing a soft punch at Steve’s chest.
omega, Steve. I’ve known since the day I met you that I’d never be able to let you go.”
"What's got you puzzled?" Tony finally asked, breaking the silence between them.
“Why don’t you ask for help? Guy like you has to have a large group of friends who wouldn’t mind lending a hand.”
“I had two sips of wine.”
“Oh Tony,” Pepper said, as she placed her hand atop his. “Why don’t you tell me how the meetup went.”
Steve and Tony sat in the back of their Uber, traveling in silence. Steve watched as Tony looked out the window, staring at nothing in particular, yet pointedly refusing to pay any bit of attention to the man beside him. Steve sighed at that and turned his attention out his own window, thinking back on the events only fifteen minutes prior.
“You do realize we’re at a bar, right? Getting you drunk enough to answer that question isn’t exactly a challenge for me here!”
“Alright well we’ll do some testing and figure out exactly what’s going on.”
She yawned, clearly exhausted from being up two hours past her bedtime. “Ya gotta
, at least in Tony’s book.
Steve readily accepted the invitation, knowing that it was something that needed to be done, but more so, knowing it wasn’t anything he wanted to do alone. He’d accepted any and all help from friends in the last few weeks, because though he had been adamant that he could do this alone, he knew that he would need all the help he could get while preparing for Mason.
Bucky seemed to visibly relax, if only a little, at Steve’s words. Natasha, however, fixed him with a suspicious look.
“Ok...well, I still just don’t trust it.”
Tony gave a confused look, only to be met with the faces of all their friends. Pepper, Happy, Rhodey, Carol, Sam and Clint piled into the small hospital room, all seeming highly pleased with their ability to surprise Tony.
“You invited me here so you could blab my ear off, I figured it’d be perfectly fine if I just barged right in.”
“First of all, I’ve been dating the guy for like five seconds, so no. Second, you’re the one throwing around the L-word, not me… but if that’s what you want to call it, I won’t stop you.”
Bruce and Peter thought over the question, when the teen snapped his fingers. “The dance that’s coming up might be a good option.”
“Mama, I miss yew. When ya’ gonna come home?”
Once he pulled up to the hospital, a large smile spread across Tony’s face, as he saw Steve standing there waiting.
“Literally the only person in this car who hasn’t met Tony is Bucky,” Sam spoke.
It had been a long time since Steve had gotten a chance to have an afternoon just him and the boys. With Sam working at the VA and Bucky splitting time between wedding planning, work at the garage, and physical therapy for his new arm it was hard to find the time to do anything other than just sitting on each other's couches. So Steve was all too happy to accept Sam’s invitation to go axe throwing, because he really did miss them. Truth be told, he also needed a distraction from a certain blue eyed brunet who was currently occupying Steve’s every waking thought.
“What do you mean?”
Steve sat in the chair close to the hostess stand, waiting.
The alpha made quick work, unwrapping the box and opening it to see a deep red scarf with gold accents. When he didn’t say anything, Steve felt the need to explain himself.
“Let me ask you this: did you love Steve?”
Tony saw the look out of the corner of his eye but purposefully kept his eyes on the road. “Well, yeah. As the robotics assistant coach, I’m sure you’ll end up meeting them at some point,” he tried.
“You drink?”
him. The imprint wouldn’t last, omegas had to be marked during a heat for a bond to take, but the act itself and the promise behind it was enough to nearly bring Steve to tears.
“Welcome to the first Robotics Team meeting of the 2018-2019 school year,” Tony began. “Now, I know that you all have been waiting all summer to get back to school specifically for this team, but I’ve got a new member to announce before we can get started.” Tony gestured towards Steve, and every single pair of eyes in the room turned. “This is our new assistant coach who also happens to be the new P.E teaching assistant, Mr. Rogers. He’ll be here to help with anything that you guys may need while working today.”
“Well, how bout I fix you a drink and if that doesn’t help then I‘ll get to working on that pillow.”
This is a fucking masterpiece, oh shit, sorry Cora. Oh goddammit!”
"And this was after he called in some mysterious favor to reserve the aquarium for just the two of you?" All Steve could do was nod at the question. Natasha just looked at him, astonished.
“Okay, then I’ll be over in fifteen.”
Steve just shook his head and rolled his eyes, as he pushed the plate closer to Tony for him to take from it.
At that, Steve put everything he had into making sure Tony knew that his words were heard and that the omega felt the same way. Steve dug deep to muster all of the energy and strength he had, fighting through the pain that was threatening to take over. But suddenly, Steve felt the slight movement as he wiggled his fingers.
“Captain, where has Man of Iron been? I have not been graced with his presence in quite some time.”
“It wasn’t that simple.”
Pepper was straddling Tony as he sat in his chair. She had come down to the lab in an attempt to take Tony’s mind off of everything with Loki and rebuilding
, school’s going well,” Steve teased.
Tony liked the fact that Steve lived so close to Rhodey and Carol, mainly because he could just walk to one place right after visiting the other. He usually used the walk to clear his head and really think about everything that he had going on in life. He was currently thinking about all that had changed over the past few months between him and Steve. They’d fallen into this routine, of acting the part of a bonded couple expecting their first child, and yet, only one of those three things applied. Tony didn’t even want to thinking about bonding, but he definitely wouldn’t mind if he and Steve became a couple. But with all that was happening, he just wasn’t sure what to do.
When their wedding day comes, less than a year later, their friends can't help but laugh as they see various turtles from Steve and Tony’s home placed as center pieces at their reception.
“Nipples! Come
As he sat in his car, Steve closed his eyes and tried making a mental list of every fear he had about his first day on the job, then he tried assessing ways to deal with each fear. After less than a minute, Steve heard a knock at his car window and jumped. His eyes went wide in shock, as he looked out to see a man with floppy brown hair and glasses that covered the bluest eyes he’d ever seen.
As Tony began talking about the ridiculous interaction he’d had at the coffee shop on his way into work, Steve couldn’t help but think just how crazy the last week of his life had been. Being thrust into a new career was one thing, becoming part of a new friend group was another. But getting to know
. Shouldn’t be surprised that everything fell apart before it ever really started with Tony.”
“Ah, well I’ve got to go. Cora’s coming over today, and I promised I’d be around to play with her while Steve got some homework done.”
Tony found himself suddenly a little distracted as Steve walked away. He came back to himself almost immediately, once he noticed Pepper standing where Steve had once been.
“You still have time to make things right,” Bruce said, now with a kinder tone, “obviously it’s going to take some time, but Steve does miss you. He wanted for things to work out between you two, and I’m sure if you explain this all to him, he’ll understand --”
“Tony, if you know what’s good for you, you’ll just let them work. We’ve got no clue how to make a costume, let alone one that looks like a chicken nugget,” Steve said, hauling their purchases up to his apartment. Once inside, everyone spread out to work on their own projects. Though Steve and Tony had found costumes, they’d decided to add some flare to them.
Tony polished off the last bit of his sandwich before grabbing a screwdriver from his desk and extending it in Steve’s direction. He was met with a look of confusion.
“Tony, I literally explained why I was here not even a full five minutes ago,” Pepper answered, already exasperated, “I’m here to make sure you actually look through those applications but I’m also here because I want to hear all about Mr. Hot Gym Teacher.”
“Alright?
“Alright, fine,” Tony said, wiping at his eyes as he made his way to the door. He stood in the doorway for a moment, before turning to look at Steve one last time. “You know, while you’re sitting here trying to figure out how to tell Cora that I won’t be around anymore, you might also want to work out how to tell her that it’s your fault I left.”
“I wish I could, but I just got news that the team I coach needs an assistant this year otherwise we won’t be able to participate in competitions. Something about there needing to be at least two teachers during away trips or some dumb shit like that. I don’t know, but now I have to figure out who has the bandwidth to take this on.”
“What are your intentions with my best friend,” Rhodey asked, point blank.
Tony wasn’t sure when it happened, but the next thing he remembered was Steve being upright. It was quite a sight, Steve bouncing on his dick, his (beyond perfect) cock bobbing along on Tony’s stomach as he slowly stroked himself, sweat drenched hair flopping in his face, eyes closed and mouth slightly open.
Once they got back to the apartment, they found Natasha and Pepper waiting for them.
“Night, Steve,” he replied, moving onto his side to turn off the light.
“I won’t be seeing you for a while, so I just want to say thank you…for everything.”
“Lemon water and a coke.” He refused to look at the waiter whose voice sounded painfully like Steve’s. Wonderful, he’d progressed to full on hallucinations.
“Love you.”
Tony made it to the door of the classroom just in time to hear what seemed like the tail end of a conversation with Steve and Peter. “...well, I’m glad that you’ll be the assistant coach. Seems like you and Mr. Stark will make a great pair.” Peter said, innocently. Tony knew damn well what Peter was trying to do, and he’d have given the kid a piece of his mind if not for the fact that Steve’s reaction took the breath right out of his lungs.
Today felt a little off to Steve though. It seemed as though Bucky had something on his mind that he wasn’t bringing up.
“So you want me to watch Cora. Alone.” Tony stated, checking to see if he’d heard right. He adored Cora more than he ever expected he could; she was a constant ray of sunshine in his life, and he absolutely loved being around her… when others with actual baby experience were also around. In the few months that Tony had been dating Steve, he’d not once looked after Cora without someone else around to help. The thought of looking after her,alone quite honestly scared the shit out of Tony.
“How would you label your sexuality?”
“Told you it go better.”
It took a second but once she put it all together, she wrapped her arms around the brunet as well. Tony started the day really just looking to clear his head and reminisce about old times with Jarvis, but the events that unfolded were far better than he ever could have hoped for.
Tony let those words sink in for a moment. He had been trying for what felt like so long to pretend to be strong, but as if a switch had been flipped, he crumbled, and fell into Pepper’s arms.
“What’s going on?” The brunet asked, pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose.
“It’s almost three.”
“He has a
“Maybe he’s not interested,” she offered, with a slight shrug. Tony looked at her, bewildered, and scoffed.
It took a few days, but by Saturday Tony felt that his plan (which Peter so lovingly named Operation Robot Hearts) had come together. To say he was nervous for the dance was an understatement, but if the nerves didn’t kill him, the slight embarrassment at his life turning into a 90s rom-com would. Tony really didn’t know how he’d ended up at this point; leaning on one of his former students and a few of his friends to help him sort out his relationship, but he was here now and despite everything, he felt hopeful.
“Am I though? Steve is being an complete idiot. I would just like to know more about his grand plan to raise this mistake with the dumbass who got him knocked up.”
“Come on, Buck. Really? That’s not what this is at all. I’m not whoring my friendship out for cash. Plus if that’s what he’d been after, I’m sure he would have made some kind of proposition, but he’s done nothing of the sort. He’s just a guy who happens to be rich who enjoys my friendship.”
“Goddamn,” Bucky muttered. “Well, Stark.... you passed.”
A few hours had gone by, and the other team members had long since come home and fallen asleep. Steve and Tony were sitting in the living room, laughing about their younger days.
Steve woke up to the now wonderfully familiar feeling of being instantly nauseous. He threw back the covers and ran to the bathroom, barely making it before the contents of his stomach made their way up. Once he felt he was finally finished, he slid over closer to the tub to rest his head on the side. As he sat there, Steve thought back to the day before.
“Tony…is it really that serious? You guys just rubbed each other the wrong way which, honestly, shouldn’t surprise anyone.”
“I didn’t realize how hungry I was until I smelled everything,” Steve offered, mouth practically watering looking at the spread. He caught Tony eyeing his spring rolls and smiled.
“Oh?” Sarah asked, clearly very interested, “Anyone in particular?”
Once they were on the road, it dawned on Steve that they’d have to find a way to fill this silence for an hour and a half. He’d never found it hard to talk to Tony, about anything really, but now it seemed like an impossible feat.
Steve didn’t let Tony finish the sentence, instead cutting him off by crashing their lips together. He loved Tony and he probably had since the moment he watched Tony hold his daughter for the first time. Now there was no Coraline. There was no teen dad and no group project and no ‘I need to pick up an extra shift, sorry for canceling date night again’. There was just Tony.
“Anything, sir.”
“Tony, honey, you have to breath slowly, ok? Rhodey, get some water…” Pepper instructed as she knelt down in front of the brunet.
to. Us holiday orphans have to stick together, I just figured it’d be something to get you out of the house. You don’t have to come if you’re busy or if you don’t want to, really it’s fine.”
“There ya go, babe,” Steve said, leaning forward to kiss Tony. “I make you feel good?”
“So much so that you completely managed to miss the fact that he was trying to tell you that he wasn’t going anywhere.”
“Yes,” Bucky scoffed at the same time Nat chuckled out a, “No.”
“All of us in the group are helping to chaperone the dance and we need you to help.”
Steve gave Natasha a weary look as he considered his answer. Truth be told, Steve hadn't planned anything for Halloween, mainly because he worked with all of his friends and they were going to Tony's party. Steve looked up at the brunet, and internally cringed at the cocky smile on the man's face. Everything within him screamed that this was a horrible idea, yet Steve found himself giving a half assed smile before saying "sure, sounds like fun."
Tony gave a small sigh, grateful for the slight change in subject. “The meetup was great, actually. It’s a lot of fun getting to see someone’s burgeoning love of robotics. Although…” Tony stopped puzzling over whether to even bring up his concern. When he saw the uneasy look on Pepper’s face, he continued. “Well, it was just something Steve said about someone else at the meetup. Something about them having a bot that wasn’t being controlled by anyone, but I’m sure he must have misheard what was said.”
“If only I was actually in any of your classes this year,” Peter sang as he strolled out of the classroom.
“Any time, Tones,” Rhodey replied, moving to get out of the car. “Oh, what was the other thing you wanted to talk about?”
“Well deal with it. Now that that’s settled, we can finally go shopping for your costume.”
After what felt like hours, Steve finally had to come up for air. When he did, he took in the site of Tony's kiss swollen lips and disheveled clothing. His hands were resting on the shorter man's ass, though he didn't remember placing them there.
“You didn’t have to say anything. How long have I known you, Anthony Edward Stark? You don’t think I would have noticed how hard you’ve been trying to make sure that everything is perfect for when Steve shows up? Clearly, you’ve got a thing for the guy.”
“You… you don’t know how to swim?”
“The great thing about being a genius is that my mind can focus on more than one thing at a time!”
“I’ll think about it and let you know after I figure out where Steve stands, how ‘bout that?”
Tony nodded, fully and truly unable to contemplate words. Orgasms were
“Bedroom,” Tony growled, almost surprising himself with the ferocity of his voice.
“Yeah?” Tony couldn’t keep the smile from his face. God, it wasn’t just sex. It was sex with
“I uh….nothing…” Tony answered, hoping his voice didn’t sound nearly as high pitched as he thought it did.
“Mind if I take the seat next to you?” A male voice asked.
lived, and that was huge.
“Because I love you.”
Pepper successfully made her way out of the workshop and through most of the house without running into anyone. When she got to the kitchen, however, she noticed Steve making a sandwich. As badly as she wanted to just run for the front door, her feet pulled her right up behind him. He turned and jumped, slightly startled, as he noticed her.
Thankfully, after a moment of staring at each other, Tony stood and led the way back to the station with the components Steve had chosen to work with.
“I guess you’re right,” Tony whispered. No, he would not cry. Stop it. Stop closing, throat. “I’m really sorry, Steve.”
“Understood,” Natasha spoke, giving Steve a look that was some mix between anger and understanding.
Cora looked up at him, utterly stunned, lip quivering. Neither of them said anything, sitting in absolute silence, before she burst into a fit of tears.
“Crazy running into you guys here,” Tony said internally cringing at the corniness of his greeting. He didn’t have much time to dwell on it, as more team members started filing into the room. In no time, Tony was calling for everyone’s attention.
After a few minutes, Steve looked at his watch and gave a somewhat sorrowful look.
“Shh, Tony. It’s alright. I’m going to love it and Cora is, too.”
. Once the carousel began to move, Steve chanced a look at Tony, who looked back at him with an earnest smile. As their horses glided up and down, the music seemed to give way to the sound of genuine laugher bubbling out of Tony. He didn’t want to be rude, he didn’t want to stare, but Steve couldn’t look away from the unbridled joy and excitement on the brunet’s face. Seeing the man like this was breathtaking in a way that Steve never knew possible, and he found himself praying that the ride would never end.
“Hey, so what is this about?” Steve asked, cutting right to the chase.
“Wait you mean Tony Stark as in...Stark Industries?”
She raised her eyebrow and smirked at him, seeing right through what Tony was doing, but took the bag anyway. “Would you guys like anything to drink?”
hard earned money. There isn’t a single part of my day to day life that I have paid for using what you’ve given me. So you can fuck right off with that bull shit.”
The museum always seemed bring Steve out of whatever he was dealing with in his day to day life. Being around so many magnificent pieces was almost therapeutic for him in a way, and this trip was no exception. Steve found himself meandering longer than usually, realizing that he really needed this, needed to be in a place that genuinely felt good for his soul.
Once the door closed, Steve let out a breath he hadn’t known he’d been holding. His “first” date with Tony had gone amazingly well, and he couldn’t wait to finally tell Cora that Tony was back, hopefully for good.
The blonde looked at Tony, unfazed by his bewilderment.
“Your phone is currently connected to my wifi plus your password isn't hard to guess. This whole back and forth between us also gave J enough time to get into all of your systems and get the information that we needed. So…”
“I don’t know! It seemed like things were going well, then he just jumped up and left!”
The room fell silent, save for the sound for the coffee maker. Tony wasn’t ready for this, seeing Steve the day after their couch make out. But Steve apparently didn’t share that sentiment.
Steve swatted at him, rolling his eyes as he smiled fondly. “None of that, mister. We’ve got to eat breakfast before we start any of our holiday festivities.”
Steve wanted to wake up desperately, then. He wanted to jump out of that bed to let the world know that he was ok, and that he wanted to see his baby. He tried, or at least he felt that he had tried, but time and time again, his efforts got him nowhere. Steve felt Tony stand to press a kiss to his forehead.
Tony couldn’t help but smile at how adorable Steve was. “Yeah, I’d like to stop by for a bit,” he answered around a small laugh.
As the two of them stood on that deck, talking the night away, Steve’s mind kept wandering back to that day, weeks ago, when he first agreed to come to Tony's party. For all the griping and worrying that he did, Steve was finally beginning to think that showing up wasn't such a bad idea after all.
“Hey there, Bug. I’m not sure if you heard but Steve and I have come up with a name for you, are you ready? You’re gunna be named Mason Alexander, if you’re a boy, and Mason Alexandra if you’re a girl. I suppose you already know that which name applies, but we’ll find out soon enough!” Tony whispered, rubbing Steve’s belly gently.
Thankfully their drive was coming to an end as Tony pulled into the Midtown High parking lot to drop Rhodey off at his car. Once he parked beside the sleek black sedan, Tony turned to face his friend. “Thanks again for coming out tonight,” he said, trying to conceal any of the feelings the previous conversation had stirred up.
?!” She asked, incredulously.
“I really want Mr. Rhodes to like me too,” Peter said, folding his hands on the seat in front of him and resting his chin atop them.
Steve reached out his hand to shake, never once letting his smile falter, even though he knew she was sizing him up.
“Hey,” Tony said, just above a whisper.
Tony sat at his desk, tinkering with one of the robots from the year before. He’d brought it out in the hopes that he could use it to help teach Steve some of the basics of engineering, and wanted to make sure that it was in decent working order.
“Who’s at the house?” He asked, now nothing but business.
Steve did as he was asked, giving his mom a hug as if he hadn't seen her in years. It felt like that was the case anyway.
As the videos came up, Steve began explaining in great detail where the team’s performance was lacking and how they could have improved. With every new observation and critique, Tony’s mind got farther and farther away from thoughts of the robotics team. As he watched Steve’s whole being light up with excitement at analyzing the teams approach to each match, he realized that he was falling for the TA and only one thought came to mind.
"Glad to see some familiar faces," Tony spoke, slowly removing himself from the bed, making an effort not to stir the sleeping omega.
“I’m really sorry, I just don’t think I can do this right now.”
“But… I’m not forgiving you right now, either.”
“I want you to pay me a monthly allowance and I want you to leave me and my family alone. You do that, and I’ll do whatever you want with the company once it’s mine.”
************
Steve won the point, Sam won the game.
“Hey there, nugget, you ready for a nap?” Steve asked, plucking Cora right off of Tony’s back. She just rubbed her eyes and nodded before resting her head on his shoulder.
James ‘Rhodey’ Rhodes had been Tony’s best friend since college. He’d been by Tony’s side through all of his ups and downs; the good, the bad, the ugly, and the down right horrendous. Tony knew that no matter what he could count on two people in life to always be there for him, and one of those people was Rhodey.
“What the hell just happened?”
“So are you guys staying or…” Tony spoke, moving to pick up Coraline from her spot on the floor. Natasha looked at Bucky and just shrugged.
“Barton, my friend, I suggest you relinquish that pastry back to its rightful owner, if you do not want to incur my wrath.”
Steve turned to take Cora to her room, but turned with a mischievous grin on his face. “As I said before, once I put her to bed, I’m gonna come back out here so we can work on your payment.”
“Why did you lie? Or tell the half truth, I guess. However you want to look at it.”
“Yeah, actually. I mean, obviously most kids our age wouldn’t think twice about running from a situation like this, but I’m a Stark, and I don’t run from anything, so, you know, this kind of thing is right up my alley.”
Bucky whined. “C’mooooon. I promise I’ll be quiet. I swear I’ll be quiet.”
“I keep trying to tell you that you can’t just fall in love with some mut off the street and expect for them to treat you as anything more than a cash cow. We are Stark men, and we do not end up with just anyone. Your mother came from a prestigious family, and your future wife will too. So I don’t want to hear any more about you dating men, especially this Steve character. When you come home this summer, we’ll introduce you to some nice girls that are of our caliber.”
"I don't see why I can't look pretty and do something useful, but I suppose I'll go do both at my own desk."
The way Steve smelled like the shampoo Tony bought him when Tony kissed behind his ear.
Tony chuckled, taking off the condom and tying it up. “Whenever you’re ready.”
“Well...yeah. You make a good point, but also you seem to really want to be our assistant coach and Lord knows I don’t feel like putting more into finding someone than I already have. So, welcome to the team.” Tony said, clapping Steve on the shoulder before continuing the walk to his car.
Tony woke up, hazy and aching. It took some amount of time for him to get his bearings, but once he did, he quickly covered his head with his sheets, in an effort to ward off the day. He had been going on three weeks now. Three weeks of wallowing in his own self pity, in his large house, alone.
“If you had been my teacher I’m sure I would have been far too distracted to actually learn anything about physics,” Steve muttered, apparently louder than he’d intended, if the laugh that Tony barked out was any indication.
Refusing to let himself fall into the trap of sleep again, Tony just changed his underwear and went right back down to the workshop, until it was time to get ready for work. Once he got to the office, he spent a good amount of time trying to drink his own weight in coffee, just to be awake enough to deal with the hot mess that had become his life. After about an hour of pointedly avoiding everyone and anyone, Tony decided he had had enough. He left his office and went on a search for Pepper. It didn’t take long to find her, as he knew she’d probably be in her office.
anything!” Tony practically yelled, frantically.
“Nat, I already have a job,” Steve answered.
Bucky gave a sigh and leaned back in his chair.
“Well, yeah...just say you’re sorry and stop purposefully making life difficult for the people around you.”
"Just text me when you're on your way," Steve spoke, before going to collect his things to be ready for the girls when they arrived.
“Good lord, Tony. What?!” Natasha asked, barely hiding her annoyance as she turned her chair towards the door.
“Love you, too.” When their breaths evened out, Steve turned Tony’s face to look at him. “We’re doing that again, right?”
Tony took in the man before him. He was short, shorter than the brunet anyway, with golden blond hair and the most striking blue eyes.
I’ve ever said about this stuff. I didn’t know, Steve. I didn’t know it could be this good!” Tony said, taking another bite and letting an almost sinful moan escape his lips. Steve felt his face warm at the reaction, and had to turn away once Tony looked up from his toast to give a small smirk.
“Hello Mr. Rogers. My name is Dr. Banner and I’ll be looking after you during this pregnancy. Let’s get started, shall we?”
The brunet stopped abruptly, moving in front of Steve and taking him by the shoulders.
Once he made it to the bathroom, Steve picked the closest stall to him, slammed the door shut and threw his head into the toilet bowl. He lurched as what little he had in his stomach forced it’s way back up. After several moments of heaving, Steve finally felt that he would be ok if he got up and went back to his desk. He quickly washed his face, noting how red his eyes were and how tired he looked, before leaving.
“Not only did Tony Stark come in here tonight and spend the entire time chatting it up with Steve, but he left the man a $500 tip!”
"Mainly because I like eavesdropping too much. Now to show them our little girl."
“Not much, just reading this thing Steve wrote about Tony,” Natasha said, handing over the notebook as Bruce extended his hands in a
“I...what’s….what’s going on?” Tony asked, feeling his breathing become more labored as he took in the site in front of him.
“Did Pepper ask you to look after me before she left?”
“Oh my gosh, Steve, I am so sorry about this,” the woman said with a British accent. “I know it’s not your weekend, but Sharon called. Nana fell and she can’t take care of her on her own.”
Tony looked Steve right in the eyes and Steve could feel his cheeks begin to burn.
“Alright. Get ready to ride in 3-2-1!” Tony took off across the floor as fast as he could, bucking up every once in a while, and neighing like a wild horse.
It didn’t take them long to get downstairs and outside. Once there, Steve began to push the wheelchair, just wandering towards the path they usually took during their visits.
Tony didn’t have much time to think about how badly he missed Steve before he fell asleep.
It took a few minutes, and more strength than he knew he even possessed, but Steve was finally able to open his eyes. The room took some time to come into focus but once it did, all Steve saw was the look of amazement and happiness on Tony’s face, as the man cried in earnest.
Sam and Bucky mumbled their apologies, as they went back to throwing axes. They tried to salvage what was left of their outing and by the end of it, they were all laughing hysterically.
Tony grabbed Steve’s hand before he could walk off.
“Anthony. I’m calling because I need you to tell me what you intend to do for the Thanksgiving holiday break. Should I have someone prepare your room?”
“Next present!” She said, full of excitement. “Daddy says I’m not suppos’a touch dis one, so you gotta go get it.”
“I um…I have to go.”
Tony’s smile faltered for a moment but he regained his composure quickly enough that the slip up went unnoticed. “Oh I forgot but it was nothing important anyway.”
Steve finally let out the breath he had been holding in the form of a laugh mixed with a sob. He continued to laugh as tears fell from his eyes, overjoyed by getting to see this, getting to see the little life that was growing inside of him was there on a screen for all the world to see. He couldn’t help but reach a hand out to touch the mass on screen that was his baby just to make sure it was all real.
“Are we going to the garage for something?” Steve questioned.
Steve didn’t know where he was or what was happening when he awoke. He tried to take inventory of everything, but he couldn’t move. All he knew was that his head and neck were killing him...actually his entire body was killing him. Though he probably had a laundry list of aches and pains at this point, nothing hurt nearly as bad as his lower stomach. It was at that realization that everything came back to him: he had been in an accident.
Tony had started this day thinking the only headache he’d have was in dealing with Tiberius’ shit, but now he had the added task of figuring out how to fix what he’d fucked up with Steve. Tony sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose as he thought. If he was going to tackle this mess, he’d need coffee first. As he stood to leave for his workshop, asking JARVIS  to get a pot of coffee brewing, Tony gave a small laugh at a passing thought.
“Is there something you wanted to talk about? You seem kind of off and I feel like there’s a lot of tension going on right now,” Steve spoke, keeping his eyes on his work.
When Steve finally reached his room, he’d let out a breath he didn’t even know he was holding. Not only had he confessed that he had feelings for Tony, but he told him that he wanted to try a relationship. This day had gone in a direction that Steve never could have predicted. He wanted someone to talk to about this but he had no idea who to go to. He ran through the list of friends he could trust with this, but only came up with Tony and Jarvis. As great as Jarvis was, Steve knew he needed to talk to a real person. There was on person who came to mind that may have been the most trustworthy person on the planet, Steve just didn’t know whether or not they would give a damn about his issues. He decided to take a chance and made his way down the hall. When he finally made it to his destination he quietly knocked on the door. He stood there for a moment, and when no one answered, he considered leaving. Just as he turned to go, he door opened.
“I did. Everything today has been perfect, Tony,” Steve said with more sincerity in his voice than he’d have liked to admit. He chanced a look at the brunet, seeing the relaxed, easy sense of contentment emanating from him. Steve just took in the beauty of this man, and smiled. “Absolutely everything.”
“Whatever you want.”
“My last class let out early, so I figured I'd get a jump start helping you out today. From the sounds of it, you need all the help you can get,” Peter teased.
“If that's the case, then why am I seeing all these stories from trash magazines saying you’ve been spending every day there for the last couple of weeks?” Rhodey asked, concern lacing his voice.
“You can’t just go around offering coaching positions to people just because you want to bang them, Tony,” Rhodey spoke in a hushed tone.
It had taken a few days to come together, but as he wrote a few more words, Steve smiled, realizing his work was finished.
They needed to move, but Tony knew there was no way they'd make it anywhere near the bedroom with how desperate he was to have the younger man. “Living room,” he stated more than asked, hoping that his intentions were understood. Steve just gave a shaky breath but nodded, letting himself be pulled along towards the couch. Tony gently urged Steve to sit down, before grabbing a pillow. “Jarvis, lights off, fire on,” he spoke without taking his eyes off of the man in front of him.
Steve considered Tony’s words, really letting it all sink in. “So what you’re telling me is if I start wearing more of your oversized sweaters, we’ll have more nights like this one?”
“I was off dealing with corporate espionage, you know how it is.”
Once dinner was completely cooked and plated, Tony heard a knock at the door, right at 8. He dried his hands on a kitchen towel as he made his way to the front door.
“No!” Tony sobbed. “No ‘but’. Please. Nothing has to change. I won’t buy you lavish gifts. I’ll do whatever you want. If you want to buy the ice cream when we go out next time, I’ll let you. Whatever you want, I will give it to you. I need you.”
Steve rolled his eyes and gave an exasperated smile. “Give me a few minutes, and I'll meet you in your classroom with real food for you.”
“Every little thing I do, never seems enough for you. You don’t wanna lose it again, but I’m not like them. Baby when you finally, get to love somebody, guess what...it’s gunna be me,” both of them sang in unison as they danced around. When the song ended, they fell to the floor, laughing uncontrollably.
Tony was
Steve wanted nothing more than to sit here and listen to his baby forever, but the thought of actually getting to see his child for the first time was too amazing to pass up. The omega wordlessly gave a nod for the doctor to start the ultrasound. Steve winced slightly at the feel of the gel as it was squirted onto his belly, and he held his breath as Dr. Banner began to move the wand around. Once he found what he was looking for, he held the wand still.
“I don’t know…” Steve answered, looking at the thin blue fabric nervously. “What’s that?”
“Listen, I don’t know what the hell happened but this morning I got word from Steve that he’s quitting. He wants to work the remainder of his two weeks from home, and he’s instructed Natasha to collect his personal effects. I don’t know
Steve took a deep breath before beginning.
“Do my eyes deceive me? Am I really being graced with a phone call from the Tony Stark?! Am I finally worthy?!” Carol answered in some sort of old English accent.
, Tony thought to himself as Steve laughed about something (Tony wasn’t paying 100% attention; he was hungry and yet again distracted by Steve’s adorableness).
“I...listen,” Tony began, visibly seeing how those two words immediately crushed the omega, “I care so much about you and Mason, you have to know that. But I just...I can’t be your bond mate, Steve.”
“Tony, thank you. I appreciate the apology, and I’d be more than happy to start things over.”
“She’s moving back to London? As in London, England?” Tony asked. Steve had kept his conversation with Peggy bottled up until Cora had her inevitable sugar crash from the birthday cake and they’d put her to bed. As soon as he’d closed the door, everything had come spilling out.
Natasha stepped out of the way to let Steve in. If he was being honest, Steve didn’t really think of Natasha as a friend. It wasn’t that he didn’t like her, he just found it hard to actually befriend women.
He pulled some crumpled bills out of his pocket and handed them to the driver before heading out of the car. He hadn’t thought much about it on the ride over, but Tony suddenly became very aware of his appearance. His hair was disheveled and his clothes were wrinkled from laying down and sulking on the couch. He tried to straighten his clothes out a bit but once he realized that was a lost cause, he ran a hand through his hair, for good measure.
Before you go judging the choice to use TSWIFT, listen to
“Have you ever stopped to think that your father just keeps putting these thoughts in your head because he wants you to be miserable?!” Bruce yelled, removing his glasses to pinch the bridge of his nose to calm himself down.
Cora nodded, sniffling. “Okay.” They walked hand in hand until they reached the front of the restaurant. “Ony, I haf’ta go potty.”
kissed
“I never expected this to last. I mean let’s be honest, no one knows better than I do that everything I love gets ripped right out of my hands. But this…I never expected this from you. If you wanted to go you could have told me. I’m fully aware that I don’t deserve you…”
Though he didn't have any close friends who were married, most everyone Tony knew had found their bond mate. In this day and age, once you found your mate, that didn't mean rushing right into marriage and starting a family. It meant you had a sense of security and stability, knowing this person was the one for you.
“Alright, well thanks for dining at Olive Garden. Hope you guys have a great day, and come back to see us soon,” Steve offered, repeating his rehearsed shpeal.
“Uh...I’m ok, really,” Steve answered, cursing himself for not containing the shiver that made it’s way through his body in that exact moment.
Steve asked himself. The brunet had become a regular part of his life over the last few weeks, so it seemed important that he tell his mom about the man. As he continued driving, Steve began to wonder, why exactly it was so important that his mother know about Tony. The only reason his brain could rationalize was that it’d be interesting to hear that her son was friends with
“Alright, I’m going to take your blood pressure, along with some routine vitals before we listen for the baby’s heartbeat and do the ultrasound.”
When it came to Tony, Steve was unsure of a lot of things. He had feelings for the alpha, that much was clear, but he would much rather continue their friendship the way it was rather than let the hope of something more ruin that.
“But...if that’s the case, why weren’t you able to control the bot from DeWitt?”
“Tony… hey Tony!” Steve yelled after them. “I need to talk to you.”
“Guys, look, either he’s coming or he isn’t. Either way, we’re all going to have a great time watching some of our favorite movies, ok?”
Tony opened his mouth but immediately closed it once he realized Steve was right.
“Why shouldn’t we, Steve? You apparently only want to talk to me within the confines of the walls of this school, so where else am I supposed to talk to you about this?”
Pepper sighed. “When we were dating we were different people. It was high school. We were in California. We’ve grown up since then.”
“Okay,” Tony started, turning to give the man in front of him his full attention, “what exactly do we need to talk about? I’m sure by now you know that I intend to stand by Steve and this baby.”
Steve sat at his desk, entering attendance for his first two classes. This was his free period and he figured it’d be best to get a head start on some of his admin work for the day. As he continued going through the list of students, there was a knock at the door.
“Well when you put it like that, I suppose the answer would be never,” Tony answered in a small voice. Deep down, he knew that he deserved everything he was getting from Pepper. “And I don’t sound like that. Never have I ever said ‘hurr hurr hurr’.”
“Is everything ok?” Dr. Banner asked preparing to take the omega’s blood pressure.
The transition from light pink to deep red happened almost instantaneously as Steve felt his face warm up. As awkward was it was for him to admit his feelings out loud, it felt good getting all of this off his chest.
Steve couldn’t bring himself to verbally confirm her statement, but he knew he didn’t have to.
DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUUUN
“You okay babe?” He asked, eyes glued to the man in front of him. Steve just picked at a loose thread in his sweater before looking up with a weak smile.
Darcy smiled, knowingly. It was no secret that Steve and Tony didn't get along. Most people attributed it to their genders; Steve being an omega, while Tony was an alpha.
“I haven’t seen him smile like that, at least not at me, in months, Bruce. Just let me have this. I’ll give the key back tomorrow, and I’ll stop coming in after today so just… let me have this,” Tony pleaded.
“TONY!”
“Steve… I just want what’ll make you happy.”
The robotics league had very strict rules about what qualified as acceptable for teams to use. Very basic machine learning was allowed, as long as it still required some input from the students controlling the bots. Running something like this, where the bot was basically fully autonomous was against the rules.
“Yeah, it kind of snuck up on me but...they are really great. I have a lot of fun when we’re together and when I found out...they had feelings for me, I was excited.”
“Would you believe me if I told you that I'm literally only going there to see someone? I’ve befriended one of the bartenders…”
“I know that you probably can’t hear this, and this isn’t really the best time to do this, but...you were right. I was scared and I was running from my fears, but I’m ready now. I’m ready to be the father that Mason deserves and the bond mate that you deserve. I love you, Steve and when all of this is over, I want to spend the rest of my life with you.”
“Hey, noodle, how are you?” Peggy asked, softly. Cora perked up immediately at the sound of her voice, and smiled wide once she looked at the computer screen.
“Simmer down now, I didn’t say anything about all that,” Bucky said around a laugh, “well, I’m gunna head out so I’ll see you tomorrow, but good luck tonight!”
“Oh...uh,” Tony stammered, slowly reaching for the nightstand to grab a small box. “I was thinking of asking you a question.” He opened the box and produced a brushed platinum ring with a single small diamond embedded in the center.
“Alright look, I’m going to let you stay, but you can’t talk. Just sit here in silence, got it?”
They sat in silence, her running her fingers through his hair, him humming along to the song he’d listened to hundreds of times since Steve broke up with him.
“Tony?”
“I feel a ‘but’ coming on,” Steve interrupted.
“Yeah, I’m just thinking,” Steve answered, trying to give as little detail as possible.
“Hmm?”
The sound of Tony’s laughter brought Steve back to the current moment. “Isn’t that insane?” the brunet asked.
Tony huffed out a laugh before giving Steve a sad smile. “When I was a kid, I ran away from home after a particularly hard day of dealing with Howard’s shit—” Tony waved off the impending apology he knew Steve was preparing to give before continuing.
“Well...yeah,” Tony answered, returning his attention to the StarkPad in his lap. “I mean he’s the new robotics team assistant coach which is great. We actually got back this morning from a meetup in New Haven. We also went to a work friend’s engagement party together. He showed me around Brooklyn Bridge Park before the party too which was nice.” Tony looked up to see the dumbfounded look on Pepper’s face. “What?”
Steve froze at that. In the three weeks since Pepper had left, Tony hadn’t mentioned her at all. He had no idea that Steve knew about what happened between the two of them, and he probably wouldn’t be too pleased if everyone else found out as well.
“Oh? You’re seeing someone?” She asked, trying not to sound as hurt as she was.
“Steve was...he uh...he unexpectedly went into heat.”
“Yeah. You play tambourine.”
“Great, well come on in. We can do introductions with everyone once we get to the sitting room.”
When Tony woke up that day, he had some sort of feeling that the day wasn’t going to go all that well. Having Bucky here was enough to confirm that that feeling was correct.
“You’re quoting the song.”
“Mr. Stark?” The boy asked, but Tony waved him off.
The way Steve’s cock felt as it slid against his prostate.
Tony recalled their last encounter: he was 21 and had stormed out of a nightclub after catching Ty hanging off of some social climber. Ty had tried to sweet talk him, but Tony knew all of the promises to change, to treat him better, to
Yep, Natasha and Pepper were practically the exact same person. It wasn’t long before Tony’s drink was brought out. Once it was placed in front of him, he took a sip, taking a moment to savor the flavor and aroma.
good, Tony,” Steve said, looking down at the man before him. Tony preened at the praise, smirking at the way it made Steve's breath hitch. He reached up to take hold of the base of Steve's cock, pulling back to run his tongue along the shaft. He gave a small kiss to the head, that being his only warning before swallowing the man into his throat.
The past three weeks had been a whirlwind. Tony stood in an auditorium in Albany, looking at all of the other robotics teams as he thought back on all that had happened over the last few weeks.
“I spent a lot of money on your Christmas present this year,” Tony warned. “I wasn’t going to but then I did.”
It took a moment for Steve to realize that he had lifted Bucky from the floor and was pinning the man’s neck to the wall behind them, with his fists. He immediately dropped the brunet to the floor, and stood as he watched Natasha and Clint move in to help him up. They all turned to look at him, bewildered.
“Tony, oh my god, are you ok?”
Steve moved to buzz Tony in. While he waited by the door, he turned to look at Bucky.
Thirteen weeks. That's how long Steve and Tony spend day in and day out waking up, spending hours on end watching as their daughter grew healthy enough and strong enough to come home. It was hard, knowing at the end of each day they would go home together, having to leave the one thing that made them feel whole, behind.
There was some part of Tony that knew better, but in this moment, all he wanted was to be locked inside of the sweet omega beneath him. Without warning, Tony came, hard, inside of Steve. He felt pulse after pulse of cum release, and sighed as he tried to drive himself deeper. Shortly after that, his knot began to form, and once it had grown to full size, he took hold of Steve’s cock. He tried his best to match the pumping of his fist with the movement of his hips and within no time, Steve came with a shout.
does still come as part of the package. You okay with that?”
“Yeah, uh I just… can you take me back to my apartment?” Steve asked, quickly getting into Tony’s car.
"So...I may have made a mistake," Steve answered, bringing the alpha into his kitchen. His eyes widened upon seeing all the fruit and fruit flavored items.
“I’ve learned a lot of things in all my years of being...me,” Tony stated, looking down at their fingers intertwined. “Unfortunately one of the biggest lessons I’ve learned is to question anything decent that comes into my life. I’ve been burned by a lot of people in the past, and I get that you weren’t any of those people, but all of them left lasting scars that manifested as me assuming anyone as funny, and smart and…
“Hey there sleepy head,” Steve offered, seeming just as tired.
“You’re a little shit!” Tony shouted, chasing after Steve.
He had had plans to catch up on some school work and just relax, maybe even spend some time with his friends on top of hanging out with Tony, but all of that went out the window the second Peggy asked for his help. As frustrating as it was that she seemed to be asking this of Steve more and more, he couldn't be too upset. At the end of the day, it just meant he got to spend more time with Coraline.
“Alright, so remember way back to our Christmas get together, you know...when Steve flaked?”
The meeting went by relatively quickly, as the students started planning the bots that they wanted to build for the season. Tony observed as Steve walked around, commenting on the work that was being done, and even giving his input on what skill sets might be more useful to have at their disposal. Watching Steve interact with students in a normal setting would have been nothing, but watching him with these kids,
“I’m Tony, nice to meet you,” he said, smiling nervously, as he shook her hand.
Steve jumped at the sudden sound of someone knocking on his window. He looked up to see Sam, dressed as the Earth planeteer, smiling down at him. Steve rolled down his window and gave a weary smile up at his friend.
The two of them sat there for a moment, in silence, as Steve considered Pepper’s words.
The way Steve felt so strong as he held Tony, when they were both shaking, coming down from their high.
to getting this right, then the song ended and he just...he left to get some air.”
"Oh...ok then," Tony responded, visibly defeated.
“You asked me for a piece of gum, that’s hardly a riveting conversation.”
Fury looked on, unamused, before turning toward Steve. “Looks like this is my stop. I’ve had enough of these fools for one morning, so have fun with…” Fury paused to look Clint up and down before turning back to Steve. “...this whole situation.”
Steve was still trying to express his wants and needs, when it came to sex, with confidence. Before going into the ice, Steve didn’t have much opportunity to ask for anything too specific. Any sexual encounters, especially with men, were quick and discreet. Steve had had just enough time to determine what he liked but not enough time to feel comfortable voicing his desires. At least, not until he met Tony. Speaking up in bed was still hard, but so worth it when Steve knew the man he loved would stop at nothing to give him what he needed.
It seemed that that was all it took for Steve and Tony to get back on track with their friendship. Tony didn’t stop by the bar for the rest of the week, but he did resume texting Steve, even more so than before. It seemed that from the moment he woke up until the moment he fell asleep, Steve was talking to Tony, and he’d be lying if he said he didn’t love it. The thought of having feelings for a man were still so terrifying to him, but Steve wouldn’t allow himself to think too hard on it. He just wanted to live in the feelings of excitement that this whole situation caused.
sweater.
“Peggy I… I fucked up” Steve spoke, dropping his head in his hands. “So badly.”
“Hi Steve, I see here that you’ve not been feeling very well lately,” Dr. Foster, looking at Steve's chart.
Steve stood, and made his way for the door to leave. Tony sat there, dumbfounded at what had just happened, when Natasha ran over.
Tears were streaming down Pepper’s face in earnest now. When Tony didn’t respond, she stood up to leave. As she made her way to the door, she turned to take one last look at him.
“Buck--”
“There’s…someone else?”
us about it? Are you fucking kidding me?!” Bucky asked, eyes wide with excitement.
“Yes. If we were alone and he wanted to know, I would tell him. It’s just not information that I need to share with the rest of the class.”
“I’m sorry to hear that you lost your grandpa after going through losing your dad too, but I really like that name. I think Mason would be a great name.”
“Why’s that?” Pepper asked.
Ever since the conversation Tony had had with Howard, he had been pulling away more and more from Steve, in an effort to make this as clean of a break as possible when he got home. It was harder than he imagined, though, what with all the picture updates the omega would send, and the good morning/goodnight texts he would send every day. Tony wished he could just shut everything off and walk away, but he loved the man who was carrying his baby too much to just cut him out of his life.
It took only a few moments for Bucky to relax, if only a little, at Tony’s words.
Tony paced around his office, nervously waiting. After he had dropped off Peter, Tony received another text from Tiberius telling him to be ready to meet at Stark Tower on Sunday afternoon. So here Tony was, waiting like an idiot.
“Fuck if I know! Seems like trying to get in my pants was the easiest way to get the info you all needed. Tell me, how much did he have to pay you just to get me to fall halfway in love with you before pulling the rug out from under my feet?” Tony asked with a sneer.
Steve found himself humming
Now, here was Tony. Tony who took Coraline in stride. Tony who got on the floor and played with his daughter. Tony who was clearly terrified and out of his league. But he’d let Steve kiss him and said he wasn’t going to bolt.
“Whatever you feel like making,” Tony replied, honestly feeling too drained to actually figure out the answer to the bartender’s question.
“We’ve really got to stop meeting like this,” Tony said, teasingly. Steve gave a slightly embarrassed smile that nearly knocked Tony to his knees. “Mind if I join you?” he asked.
“Tony, I…” Steve started at a loss for words. He stumbled a bit before taking a deep breath and trying again.
“Please tell me you didn’t answer the phone in the midst of having sex with my best friend,” Tony said, disgust evident in his voice.
Tony cleared his throat. “No, it’s fine, it’s just I don’t talk about it very often, but I’ve been teaching there for about three years now. After my...incident in Afghanistan, I came home and changed the direction of the company. Once those changes were made and the company was stable, I just felt like I didn’t have much more to offer them, plus I was bored. So I got a job as a teacher and here we are.” Tony shrugged off the entire statement, but Steve couldn’t help but stop scavenging for scraps to look at him.
Tony just plopped down on his best friend’s desk, popping open a soda can as he thought over his answer.
“Is there… is there some reason that you don’t want to have sex with me?” Steve asked, sounding somewhat hurt.
okay…” Tony practically moaned, looking his fill while waiting, Steve realized, for clear consent.
Tony knew that was as close to an invitation to come over as he was going to get from the blonde, and though he knew she couldn’t see it, he rolled his eyes anyway.
“Hmm,” Steve said, finally seeming to understand what Bucky was getting at.
and smiled. All Steve wanted to do was kick back and mindlessly watch one of his favorite movies, but a knock on the door threw a wrench in his plan. He let the intro credits continue rolling, as he moved to answer the door. Once he opened it, Steve found a very tall, beautiful redheaded woman standing there in heels and a gray dress suit.
“Oh honey, he stopped by the library as soon as they left here. It took him a solid fifteen minutes to tell the story because he couldn’t stop laughing. He actually started crying for real at one point. It was a mess.”
"Plus," Pepper added "we had some help from Bruce."
“What are these?” Tony asked, pulling the omega’s left arm towards him to get a closer look at what seemed to be bite marks.
“I was watching you only if you were lifting books as weights in your dreams again,” Tony quipped.
Natasha’s lips quirked up in the closest thin to a smile that Steve’s ever seen on her face.
He hated that he wasn’t being completely honest with Steve, more than anything. All Tony wanted was to come clean about his identity, and move past it, but a small part of him kept insisting the worst. No matter how ridiculous his thoughts were, Tony truly feared that Steve would leave him once he knew the truth.
Steve didn’t even wait for a response before storming off. Tony stood there for a solid thirty seconds, watching after Steve, before turning to walk towards his car.
Steve hadn’t slept a wink. The second Tony deserted him, oh so confused and so very very hard, he just sat there, shocked. Tony had kissed him, but surprisingly enough he pulled Tony back in for another. There was no mistaking what happened last night, and that scared the life out of Steve. He immediately sought out the gym; he had a lot of energy to get rid of thanks to the couch shenanigans and there was no way he was going to finish what Tony started. After about fifteen minutes of relentlessly attacking a punching bag, he had to stop completely. Usually, whenever Steve would have inappropriate thoughts about Tony (and when the hell did THAT become a thing?), he would just got to the gym and punch them out. But for the first time ever, it wasn’t working. He knew, for a while now, that he had strong feelings for Tony that far surpassed wanting to be friends. Half of the reason why he agreed to look after Tony was so he’d have a reasonable excuse to spend ridiculous amounts of time with him. At first Steve tried to fight it; Tony was his team member and his friend, and there was no way that having these feelings would be conducive to their line of work. But day in and day out, Steve would find more and more things about Tony that he found irresistible. Thinking about these things made his pants feel a little tighter; he groaned and decided that maybe a cold shower would be best. Unfortunately, after squirting shampoo in his hand, Steve began thinking about how hot Tony looked straddling him, and how good the brush of Tony’s goatee felt against his face. Before he knew it, Steve’s fist was furiously pumping his cock.
“You’re damn right you do,” Bucky yelled, quickly trying to regain his composure. “I’ve never said this before, at least not to you, but Tony is perfect for you--”
“Oh I’ll be around here as well. I’ve kind of got the same deal as you with my family not really being close by.”
“Mmhmm,” both Rhodey and Pepper answered in unison.
Natasha narrowed her eyes at him, and Tony felt a chill run down his spine. The last thing he ever wanted was to be on Natasha’s bad side and it seemed he was working towards getting there.
“Well
He spoke hesitantly; the smile fading from his face as he took in Pepper’s appearance. He began to chew on his lip, obviously wanting to ask a question but not wanting to overstep any boundaries. Pepper couldn’t help but give a tiny smile at how truly adorable Steve was.
“She wanted to make an ornament for you so you’d have something to decorate your tree with. She’s very concerned that Santa won’t be able to find you while you’re gone, so she thought this would help.”
Tony smiled at both his friends before seeing them out. As soon as he was alone, he took his phone out to text Natasha.
“We were...in the middle of things, and it was obvious that he was going to knot soon. He tried to pull away, I think to keep from doing it while he was still...while we were still...you know, and I told him not to.”
Steve held his breath while he waited for a response, realizing after a moment just how silly he was being.
The pair of them walked in silence to the coffee shop around the corner. Once they had ordered and found a seat, Steve ran a hand through his hair and sighed.
“Looks like she’s excited to meet you too,” Tony offered, as he rubbed Steve’s back soothingly.
“Tony, are you sure?”
. For
It was clear what Ty was doing, or trying to do anyway, and Tony was having absolutely none of it.
“I don’t want to ruin what we have, in the event that he doesn’t
As they looked over the food offerings, Steve still relishing in just how hilarious the shocked look on Bucky’s face was, Tony felt this electric buzzing feeling just under his skin. He’d been open and honest with Steve today in a way that he’d never been with anyone else, not in such a short amount of time anyway. Steve had remembered his drink of choice, and brought it to him to avoid having to explain himself to anyone else. He’d shared Tony with his best friends, and enjoyed the way they teased one another.
“And you quit because of that?”
“Steve, what are you doing here?”
“So you might not have been 100% wrong about me trying to drown my sorrows in alcohol,” Tony started, shrugging his apology at the disapproving look he was given,
"Hey," Steve spoke, slightly waddling out to kitchen, "Is everything ok? You seem like you've had something on your mind lately."
Steve stood there, hands balled into fists at his side as he took in Natasha’s words. He wanted to storm out of the store, drive home and leave his friend there to think about what she’d done, but as much as he hated to admit it, she did have a point.
Tony had been beside himself thinking about what Steve’s words meant to him, and as he sat on that jet, dreading what the next two weeks had in store for him, he came to the conclusion that Steve was it. Steve was the one he was meant to bond with, and Tony was a little more than excited and terrified about it. He decided to close his eyes and rest up before the actual nightmare he was sure that time around Howard would be, but as he faded off to sleep, Tony had the hope of bonding with Steve once he got home at the forefront of his mind.
“It did indeed,” Tony began, turning his attention back to his steak, “but in non-bisexual news, did you hear that the staff meeting got moved to Thursday?”
Steve turned to see where Tony was pointing and, sure enough, there was a clownfish repeatedly swimming into the glass in the tank across from them.
As he looked up from his phone, Tony saw Steve slowly walking over. The feeling that he felt was much like what he’d experienced the first time he’d seen the blond in class the year before. He felt the need to sit up taller, puff out his chest, and plaster on the cockiest grin he could to hide the fact that he’d never been so unsure of himself in his entire life.
“Yeah. There are days when I look at Steve doing the most mundane thing and I have this crazy need to protect him and Bug. Like I want to stand on a roof and let the world know that they’re mine. The thought of being bonded is legitimately terrifying to me, but it seems like it’s bringing out the best in both of us. Looking back on my parents, it seemed to do nothing but the opposite. They never seemed happy, it just seemed like they were stuck. And the thought that maybe the same thing could happen to me is what scares me.”
Tony crossed his arms over his chest, eyebrow cocked and grin sitting on his face. He’d finally done it, he’d finally managed to get one over on his piece of shit father. Howard had no choice but to give into what he wanted, and it was an amazing feeling.
“I uh...I figured since I always steal your scarves, it’d be nice if I gave you one for once...I can return it if you don’t--”
Natasha’s eyes lit up at that! She looked at Steve and shot him a smile that conveyed more excitement than he’d ever seen from her.
“Did it happen every time?” Natasha asked, softly.
on me?”
“What thing?” Carol asked, all too confused.
“Well hello to you too!” He laughed, as Steve frantically tried to collect his things before leaving for work. “Anything I should know before you leave me with your pride and joy?” Tony asked, trying his best to stay out of the way.
“Look, I got your message loud and clear, Tony. I won’t be bothering you anymore. You don’t have to pretend that you want to be here for me or the baby. I’ll be just fine on my own.”
It wasn’t long after that exchange that the two made their way back to Steve’s hospital room, to allow Mason to be examined by Bruce, before continuing to rest.
Steve asked, confused.
“Why are you doing this? I just want to drown my sorrows in some really awesome alcohol…preferably alone.”
“Is that it?” Rhodey asked,clearly amused.
“You didn’t have to get all dolled up for lil ol’ me,” Tony said, walking into the apartment and taking note of the Chinese take out on the living room table.
It was as if all the air got sucked out of the alpha’s lungs in that moment. He clutched at his chest, trying to ground himself, as he gasped for air.
“I don’t have any family. I lost my dad when I was a kid, and my mom just before I graduated from high school. I never thought much about how much it would mean to me to have someone that I could call family, until I found out about this baby growing inside of me. I want to keep it, Tony. I want to keep this baby.”
“Ah, so you weren’t just trying to avoid Steve?”
“Yeah. It’s about fifty-fifty.”
“What do you know about Ferragamo?” Tony asked, barely hiding his astonishment.
He asked, turning in the doorway to face her.
Steve groaned, his free hand rushing to unzip his own coat. After their coats were shed, Steve’s hands rushed to the hem of Tony’s sweater. In his haste to remove the clothing it ended up getting stuck on Tony’s head.
