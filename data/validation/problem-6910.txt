“I mean literally.” Tony says. He scowls at whatever he’s working on, pulling up another holoscreen and examining a long string of data that Steve couldn’t make heads or tails of even if pressed to at gunpoint. Naturally, Reed reaches over and points to a variable, and Tony lets out a delighted noise. He closes the data stream and opens his project back up, moving a few pieces around. “He’s a ghost, and he spends all his time following me around and touching me and telling me things in old-timey American Morse code.”
Tony places the tumbler in his hand, heart in his throat. "You know you're going to have to do more than stop a few injuries to convince the public."
"I think Stark is the best candidate for that, sir," Steve said, and Fury turned to stare at him, one eyebrow raised. He could feel the sharp stares of the rest of the team, but Steve hadn't been willing to lie to the Commandos, and he saw no reason to do it now. Less, even, than back in his day, when omegas couldn't serve. There was no reason to keep this secret.
“SHIELD has prepared a ride for you,” Thor said, and Steve took a shaky breath, another. He could smell the air now, cold and bracing. He wanted to sleep, but he wanted it with Tony. He wanted to sleep wrapped up in his alpha, safe and warm.
“Tony, stop torturing the man and put on the movie,” Natasha says briskly, returning with a large bowl of popcorn. She folds back down on the floor, graciously leaving the couch for Bruce.
“No,” Riri said finally, voice filled with so much empathy that it made Steve’s chest ache, even through the shitty speaker system. “Tony says he just knows you.”
Tony smirks at the oath, then leaves the condoms on the table. He sucks a hard kiss to Loki’s nipple as he fumbles to get the cap on the lube open, enjoying the way Loki bucks against him. He rolls the other between his fingers, flicks a nail against it, and Loki lets out a low keening noise, grabbing the bottle from Tony’s hands and pushing him up. He drizzles the gel over his fingers, eyes dark and wanting.
“My parents died in Christmastime. In a carriage crash,” Tony said, trying to explain, and Rogers sucked in a harsh breath. “I’ve been…trying. You know I’ve been trying.”
“You’re a bad man,” Tony croaks, and Steve cracks a grin at him. “Please go shower. Now.” God, he’d almost forgotten about the damn eight pack. Tony didn’t even know some of those muscles could be visible on the human body outside of anatomical models, before he met Steve. The man is honestly unreal.
When the doors open, Tony steps out quickly, turning to walk backwards so he can look at Steve and move at the same time. “Drink? Food? I know you just ate your weight in popcorn, but I mean, that’s never stopped you before.”
“What was that for?” Stein complains, scrambling after her. The deinonychus ambles after him, turning to offer Tony a strangely polite dip of the head as it passes by. Right. Delinquent superpowered teens with a sapient dinosaur and…is that a giant nose ring?
He’s almost surprised when he’s able to lean in and kiss Tony: easy, effortless, like he belongs there. Like Tony was meant to be there, sweet and trembling under Steve’s mouth. He takes Tony’s face between his hands, runs his fingers through his hair. He presses fervent kisses to his eyebrows, his cheekbones, the little patch of hair under his lower lip. He slips his fingers down, thumbs tracing the tendons of Tony’s throat, fingertips sliding over Tony’s chest, his stomach. He takes Tony’s waist in his palms and marvels at how easy it is to move him, to pull him into his lap and press their bodies together, chest to chest. It’s a miracle that Tony manages to get the tea on the table without spilling it.
“Riri Williams has been reunited with her family and seems mostly unaffected by the experience. It seems she is quite taken with Sir, and claims that he owes her lunch.” Steve grinned at that. “She offered to sign a nondisclosure agreement if it would make Sir feel more comfortable, but he told her that was unnecessary. She promised not to out him to the public. They shared an embrace. It was…touching.”
“What if I want to tell you?” Tony challenged, letting his chair fall so that he could stand. He padded to the glass, arms folded across his chest, but Steve only smiled up at him. He resolutely did not trace the exposed cords of Tony’s arms with his eyes, the way his shirt pulled taut over his shoulders. God, he couldn’t wait for tomorrow.
“I just thought I was done making things harder for you,” Pepper says, putting her face in her hands. Tony rubs at her shoulders, not really sure what he’s doing here. “After Killian, I told myself I would never be such a…such a damsel, God, that was so embarrassing, Tony, you have no idea-”
Steve sucks in a sharp breath, considering Tony’s words. He looks wild, and frightened. Dark bags hang under his eyes, purpling and heavy. Steve isn’t sure if he’s been sleeping, but clearly even if he has, it hasn’t been helping him much. He looks unaccountably fragile, and Steve wants nothing more than to wrap him up and keep him from harm. Tony’s at the end of his rope, and it’s showing.
“What does Bruce think?” Steve managed, taking another bite. The food tasted like sand in his mouth, but he pushed through it. He knew he needed the calories.
“Due to recent tensions with Latveria, satellite usage is being much more strictly monitored. I cannot access the correctly-positioned satellites swiftly without attracting attention, and I have been explicitly prohibited from doing so unless specifically ordered by Sir.” JARVIS sounded both frustrated and apologetic, and not for the first time Steve wondered how much of that was for his benefit and how much was meant to express what JARVIS was truly feeling. “He says he cannot protect me if the world thinks I am dangerous. Whether or not I feel the need to be protected is, of course, irrelevant.”
“What is happening?” Tony murmurs, and Steve perks up. He concentrates, willing his hand solid, and tries to touch Tony again. To brush a hand over his shoulder, or ruffle his hair. But as Tony goes through his nightly ablutions, Steve fails, and fails, and fails again. Every time, his hand misses its mark.
“We didn’t really,” Clint says with a shrug. Tony turns around to look at him, but he’s peeling his fourth apple with aplomb, seemingly unaware of Tony’s incredulity. “It was a chemistry thing, and then it was a holy shit we’re gonna die thing, and then it was a comfortable thing. When it ended, it was kind of easy. Expected, even. And then I got married to someone else for a little while.”
“I love you,” Steve says, leaning in to press a warm, grinning kiss to Tony’s mouth, “more than freedom, and justice, and Americ-”
“I absolutely have to clean up before I fly out,” Steve said, standing up with a wince and heading to the bathroom. “Damn.”
Tony takes a slow breath. Okay, that’s good, right? This is good. This all feels…really good. He licks his lips. “What do you want?”
Ghost puts up a good fight, Steve will give him that. He takes a chunk out of Logan’s arm, swipes ineffectively through Kitty’s vital areas. He tries for Steve’s body but is quickly turned away by Logan. Slowly, they back him into a corner. Slowly, Kitty’s hits build up until whatever it is—his suit, or his body—begins to give up on him entirely. Patches of skin, human and pale, shine through the shimmering grey mesh of static and shadow in glitching patches. When he speaks, it’s almost impossible to parse his logic. He wanted to kill Tony next, is mostly what Steve gets out of it. It would be an understatement to say that Steve is quite pleased that they never got to that point. He wants nothing more than to go home, in his own body, and curl up in bed. He wants to go for a run. Spar with someone. Read a book. Draw for a few hours. He wants some time alone to process everything that’s happened.
Tony sits on the couch sideways, turning so his body faces Steve’s. He curls an arm around his shoulders, pressing his nose to the soft line of Steve’s hair at his temple. Steve doesn’t move, just holds himself still, and Tony sighs and presses a gentle kiss to his cheekbone.
Bruce doesn’t deny it. “You need to learn to ask for what you want. Just ask. I suspect that’s most of the problem you’re having with Steve.”
Steve closed his eyes for a moment, biology warring with common sense. Time was of the essence in a situation like this, and JARVIS was right; he was still off-kilter from the morning he and Tony had together.
“I have to take care of Flower,” Tony said, looking helplessly at Steve’s wan form huddled by the fire. He couldn’t just leave the horse at the hitch, not after all she’d done for them, but he was loathe to leave Rogers here alone. “I’ll be back.”
"You want to run for two-?” Sam cuts himself off with a heavy sigh. “Jesus, Steve, I don't even know why I bother."
“Tony,” Steve says, blushing even pinker. How cute. “I didn’t- I just meant to call you, I didn’t know there, uh. I’m so sorry, I’ll go put on a shirt-”
“Come back to the couch,” he says, and Tony wavers in his arms, just the most miniscule of trembles before he once again turns to iron. Steve watches as he reassembles himself, straightens up, his chin tilting up as he takes a slow breath. When he opens his eyes again, they’re sharp, even against a backdrop of bloodshot red.
“Amora will be more of a problem than you think,” Loki says, sounding irritated. Tony turns to smile sweetly at him.
“Not like you sleep,” Steve counters. But he turns the little disc over, putting a gentle curve in it to match the shape of his shield, and making sure the bottom of it is nice and smooth. “I almost got it last time.”
“That’s how you want it,” Tony agreed, a wicked smile overtaking his mouth, and Steve licked at it, licked his mouth open until Tony was fucking his mouth with his tongue. He matched his thrusts, grinding steadily into Steve, his knot dragging hot against Steve’s rim as he shifted with intent this time. It was enough to make Steve moan, his head spinning.
“You try to set yourself up as something good for the people you love. Come to Stark Tower—it’ll be great! State of the art labs, it’s like Candyland, you’ll love it.” Bruce puts on a terrible fake smile as he impersonates Tony’s sales pitch, so plastic Tony’s almost offended. “It’s an incredibly alpha way of relating to people, which is probably part of why Steve decided to pay Obeisance to you. But Steve’s an alpha, too; he wants to give you things, and you don’t let him. This whole time he’s been fumbling around in the dark, trying to figure out how to make you happy. And he doesn’t know how to be taken care of, and he doesn’t want anything material from you, so you’re also fumbling around in the dark trying to figure out how to make
“I don’t like commands,” Tony bites out, because that-…well, frankly, is an egregious fucking lie 99% of the time. He’s no stranger to power play, and he’s more than happy to take commands in the bedroom, or give them besides. But still. He keeps himself pliant, enough that Steve can move him how he wants, and hopes that’s enough for the spell to be satisfied.
“Our mother and father are-…” Thor clears his throat. “Or, were, clever. And wise. It is what they are best lauded for, both. Your stories paint me as a powerful fool, always a step behind Loki’s tricks. Is that not the way of things, as you have seen them?”
“You’re an optimist,” Natasha interrupts him, and Tony frowns. “You trust too easily. You’ve been betrayed and bullied and manipulated all your life, and you’re desperate for love and affection. Countless others have taken advantage of this. The approval of a man who knew your father personally, of military types, of politicians and government men, is something you have been raised to desire-”
“Fuck,” Tony gaps, and Steve heaves a sigh. He kneels down in the footwell, half his body in the driver’s seat, and hovers his hands over Tony’s knees. He tries to meet Tony’s gaze. “Fuck.
Tony didn’t respond for a long time, but he didn’t tense up, either. Instead he carded his fingers through Steve’s hair, long strokes that sent waves of indolence slipping over Steve’s spine. His breath was steady, and Steve waited, knowing that Tony was gearing up to saying something important. He was weighing the words in his mouth, testing their value, their rightness. Steve was patient. He had always been more patient than Tony. He could wait while Tony gathered his thoughts.
They look good, Tony has to admit. His fingers are wound tight in Steve’s hair, grasping white-knuckled as he tips his head back and moans.
Something almost like pride crossed over Rogers’ face, but it was there and gone quick enough. He pushed off the doorframe with a laughing sigh, coming around to push Tony’s hands away from the apron’s ties. His hands were warm and steady when they brushed against the base of Tony’s spine, callouses catching on Tony’s wrists as Rogers moved his hands out of the way. When he picked the knot apart, his knuckles slid against the damp fabric that had stuck to the dip in Tony’s spine like a second skin, and Tony bit his lip at the sweet frisson of heat that skittered over him to feel it.
“I didn’t want to shoot her, but I was farther up,” Clint says, looking disgruntled. “And I don’t think she knew I was there.”
Steve blinks. He glances at the monitor, then back at Logan. Tony must have called Logan here. He must have suspected something bad might happen to Steve while he was otherwise occupied. Was Tony even in Florida? Was Steve’s killer in the room with him? How long had he been there? How
[tangential author rant] It feels (to me) like there's this weird phenomenon where everyone in fandom thinks Tony and Reed don't get along which...? Isn't canon....??? Unless you're writing Ults, of course. Is that where that comes from? Natasha is also a horrific fucking person in Ults and I don't see the same thing happening with her, although I guess we have the MCU to have balanced that out. In my MCU fics I generally leave Reed out because there's no crossover, but in comics they are like...best buds. Where does that come from? I'm not the only one seeing that, right?
Steve closes his eyes and brushes their noses together, damn the surveillance cameras and any potential civilians with working phones.
Tony snorts. “I’ll be lucky if I’m alive in ten,” he retorts, and Steve startles and looks up at him through his lashes, brows furrowing.
That’s a plea he knows he can’t fulfil. Tony knows it, too. “Sorry,” he slurs. He offers Tony an apologetic smile.
“How dare you,” Pepper sniffs. “I have always done everything Tony has needed me to do. If that means running his company while he plays martyr, then that’s what I’ll do. But I have never enjoyed it, and I will never be what this version of Tony needs.” She sighs, a self-deprecating sort of sound. It makes the skin on Steve’s arms stand on end. “I fell in love with the beautiful, damaged genius who was selfish enough to look out for himself, not the borderline-suicidal vigilante adrenaline junkie who wants to kill himself to save every crying child. I would have made that man into the king of the world.”
“You do that on your own,” Luke retorts. Tony laughs and turns to refill his mug. “Hey. You hanging in there?”
“Huh,” Tony said, tipping his head back. He scented the air, visibly, and Steve could feel himself blushing all the way down his throat, up to the tips of his ears. “Good, old fashioned soap. Like the nostalgic ideal of clean laundry, except not actually, because we put so much crap in detergent now.” Tony frowned, considering, and Steve realised he’d made a grave mistake. His pulse kicked up in his throat. “That’s what you’re using to wash though, isn’t it? That’s not you. Sunshine, maybe? No, hang on.” He turned his head, dark eyes locking on Steve, and
“You wanna come?” Tony murmurs when they pull apart. He picks up the pace a little, twisting his hectocotylus brutally into Steve, pushing more of the tentacle inside of him. Steve looses a completely broken gasp, eyes flashing open wide. “You wanna come for me, baby?”
“I love that woman,” Tony says wistfully, turning expectantly towards the elevator. He eats another oyster, saves the last one for Natasha.
“Pepper and I have had contingencies set up for this since Afghanistan,” Tony said, and his voice was flat now. “Drop it.”
"You thought Tash was out because of Clint," Steve decides. "And Bruce...he's our main defence against him. Loki's wary of him, and you didn't want him compromised if the Hulk was needed. Which implies you're compromised."
His third orgasm felt like a tidal wave: a low, thundering rush that built until he couldn’t breathe, couldn’t see, didn’t know which way was up. He couldn’t feel anything but the pleasure, waves of it breaking over him as he shook, as he could only lie there and take it. He knew he was speaking, could feel the roughness in his throat as he cried out, could feel Tony’s answer vibrating against him, but it felt like minutes before he could even tell up from down, let alone parse language.
“I want you to tie me up this time,” Steve says, and Tony’s breath stops in his throat. “Tie me down, and then use my mouth however you want.”
“Yes, omega,” he murmured, and Steve’s chest filled full with soft, fluttering swarms of joy. Even without Tony’s touch, he could feel him: warm, and close, and his. “Haven’t I told you? You always get what you want.”
“How do you think I feel?” Selvig demands, looking at Coulson with tangible fury. “Loki took my mind, my will from me, and you used my research on the tesseract and Loki’s sceptre to brainwash
“Okay,” he says. He swallows, visibly reining in his temper. “So Bucky was part of the group that attacked me, and you didn’t tell me. And now he’s
When he pulls back, Loki’s mouth is twisted into a small smile. He’s settled his hands on Tony’s chest. “Don’t think you can distract me, Stark. Who or what is Gyrich?”
“Your body needs to recover more for that.” Tony offered him another spoon of gelato, and Steve opened his mouth, swirling his tongue over the metal just to see Tony’s eyes dilate. “Probably pretty soon after, though.”
“I’ve got you,” he whispered, pressing soft kisses to Steve’s mouth, his jaw, his bondmark. “I’ve got you, baby, let go. Come on, I wanna see you.”
Tony still doesn’t know what he’d done to deserve Pepper Potts. He met her before he’d turned his life around, at a time when he was in no position to be worthy of love from anyone, let alone someone like Pepper. If the raucous bacchanalia of his nights hadn’t been enough, the shirking of his daily responsibilities should have done it. The fact that Pepper loves him doesn’t make sense. Even now, on rare days when the sun shines down on the gleaming spires of the city he’s bled to protect and he doesn’t completely hate himself, he doesn’t understand it. It feels like there’s nothing worth all the things he’s put her through within him.
“Are you serious?” he hisses, heart thundering in his chest. “Jesus fucking Christ on a pogo-stick!”
Tony releases a surprised bark of laughter at the admission. “I knew you were doing it on purpose.” Loki’s nails press a little more firmly into his skull, and he sighs and lets himself relax a little into Loki’s hold. “Henry Peter Gyrich is a U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. and he’s the fucking worst. More than Secretary Ross, who is just a bigot and thus mostly predictable, Gyrich sees the superhero question as one akin to nuclear armament. We’re all just tools for American imperialism to him. Ross wants to control the Hulk because he thinks he’s dangerous, maybe use him case of an emergency, but Gyrich wants to use all enhanced individuals as both carrot and stick for American enemies and allies alike. He’s the worst kind of politician, and the last person I want involved in developing the accords the U.N. has just voted to draft for Avengers oversight, and ostensibly future enhanced international vigilantism in general. So now I have to dig up some shit on him, to see where we can apply leverage.”
Tony huffs out a bitter laugh, then turns to the damaged gauntlet on the armour. Might as well be useful, while he’s in his self-imposed exile.
“Fine,” Tony grits out, and reaches for a spanner. This is going to end poorly; he can already tell.
“Clear the area. I’ve got some biohazard units for both Riri and Tony to put on. There’s a decontamination shower out here for Riri, along with some fresh clothes. SHIELD isn’t allowed to mess with it. Thor is enforcing that. Tony won’t have to worry about a thing.”
“Thank you for trusting me,” Natasha said, and Tony turned to look at her with a raised eyebrow. “I know you’re both feeling somewhat vulnerable right now. It means a lot, that you asked me up.”
Tony smiles a little, thin and weary. He shrugs, his excitement folding back up into himself like he’s packing his emotions away in a box.
“What is it about this that does it for you?” Tony asks, because he can never leave well enough alone.
“You smell real good,” he burrs, his accent thick. His voice is the kind of low engine purr that Tony can feel in his skull, his throat, under his hands. “Tony.”
“Tis just a scratch,” Thor agrees. His blood has traced thin red lines down to his wrist, some catching on the edge of his armour there, some dripping off to splatter on the scuffed metal of the landing pad. It’s a lot of blood, but no more than any human might bleed from a cut on the hand. Steve has seen Thor recover from being impaled. This is nothing.
Tony skated two fingers over his jaw, gentle, and Steve turned back to look down at him. “You okay?” he asked, and Steve was powerless against the soft look on his face. He leaned down and pressed adoring kisses to his eyes, his brow, his nose, and cheeks, until Tony giggled and squirmed away. The sound made him want to curl up in Tony’s lap and kiss him until he couldn’t breathe. “What’s gotten into you?”
“I bet Steve would be the one to make a move,” Beth says. “That was pretty smooth of you, though, good job. I concede with grace.”
Steve realises, with a kind of distant mortification, that he’s about to be visibly hard in his sweatpants.
“Doctor Xavier was Tony’s idea.” Hill smirks a little, although not unkindly. “He said, ‘Captain America deserves the best’ and ‘Professor X’ is uniquely qualified for the job.”
Steve's bright red, flushed and frustrated and embarrassed. It's a good look on him. Tony has so little self-control this deep into an engineering binge. "Since I'll only be working in DC short-term, SHIELD is going to set me up with a furnished apartment. I can come back to New York on the weekends, or longer when I'm not on mission. So Bruce doesn't get lonely. I…I like it here. And the studio you helped me set up is…I want to keep it, if that's okay. It's a real nice place to paint."
“Damn it,” Tony says, smoothing a hand over his mouth. “Is he making the puppy dog eyes? Please tell me he’s not making the puppy dog eyes.”
“No,” he said, and Steve whined, spreading his thighs a little more. “We’re not anywhere close to that yet.”
“I don’t understand it either,” JARVIS admits. “He exhibits all the markers of arousal. He is undeniably attracted to you, sir.”
“I know you’ve got some secret bunker stashed away just for Bruce,” Tony says sweetly, smiling at him. His smile widens when Ross looks alarmed, entirely caught out. “Figure it out, Mr. Secretary.”
“Talk to me,” Tony insisted, and Steve couldn’t resist that. Tony looked lost, and apologetic, and incredibly guilty when he hadn’t done anything wrong. It was Steve who’d fucked up, who’d done the unthinkable, who’d betrayed Tony’s trust. “No, baby, shh, don’t cry, I’m sorry-”
“It does, doesn’t it?” Minoru says flatly, and Stein holds up his hands in surrender. Minoru ignores him, and turns back to Tony with a determined expression. “I
“Congratulations!” The priest’s words are filled with unmitigated delight. “My the Lord bless your bond and grant you happiness in the years to come.”
“I thought so,” JARVIS replied. He didn’t sound at all disapproving. If anything, Steve would colour him amused. “Sir will be glad to see you.”
“Morning exercise produces endorphins that raise overall mood and health,” Steve says, like a fucking high school health class PSA.
“Tony, I’ve never been in a traditional, long-term relationship in my entire life,” he says, and that’s. Huh. “I’m not asking you to be good at dating. I already know you, Tony. We already know we get along, that we can work well together, that we can share a home, that we, uh.”
Still, the question ate away at him, even now. It settled deep into his bones, and sat there. Simmering. It hummed in his skull as he went to sleep, pounded against his temples as he showered.
Hill nods, standing. She pauses in front of the armchair for a moment. “You should talk to Stark,” she says, sternly. Then she’s gone, heels clicking off towards the elevator.
After he’d gotten to know Natasha, he’d decided that Fury must have just been bullshitting him. He’s not sure if it’s worse, that it was intentionally engineered to sting, to manipulate him into proving himself yet again.
“Are you praying to others while sharing my bed?” Loki asks, and Tony blinks his eyes open and finds Loki’s expression one of begrudging amusement. His eyes are still red, lashes clumped together, Tony’s come drying on his jaw and a little bit down his throat, and,
Tony considers this, then takes the last few steps to the sock drawer. He pulls out the first pair he sees, then slides the drawer shut and walks up to Loki. His gaze is heavy, and Tony waits patiently for him to finish speaking.
“I didn’t say anything,” Steve says, not quite managing to hide the wicked smirk threatening to overtake his very best butter wouldn’t melt expression.
“Of course,” JARVIS says smoothly. “If you would make your way down to the communal kitchen, Captain, I believe there is a jar in the pantry.”
A holoscreen filled with Steve’s sheepish, awkward countenance pops up next to Tony, who immediately raises his eyebrows at it. Steve's combed his hair. He's wearing a nice shirt. He looks like he's going to church.
“Didn’t he? He couldn’t stay under all that,” Xavier says, gesturing expansively at the collapsed building. “He couldn’t get out by himself. Doesn’t that mean he needed to be saved?”
“I told JARVIS to send you the files,” Tony grumbles. “Look, it’s bad. They have Cap, and Loki is supposed to be dead, and we’re outmatched, okay? Between Hasegawa and Barnes and fucking magic and Asgardian assholes with superhealing, we need something that can quickly take people out, without…”
, he thinks, sipping the last of his share of the whiskey. He knows exactly how this night is going to end.
“Okaaay,” Tony says, blinking. He takes a sip of his drink, fingers flying over the tablet to find what he can from SHIELD’s files on the NIA breakout. It’s not much, not yet. The NIA must have had someone call Rhodey immediately, out of professional courtesy. That was pretty nice, actually. He’d have to send them a present.
“You shouldn’t skip your run because of me,” Tony says, and Steve sighs into his ear. It’s enough to send all the blood in his body straight to his cock. His heart falters a half-step in his chest. “You like routine. I know you. It’ll just make you keyed-up and unbearable later.”
“Shall I begin the Mind Riot protocol?” JARVIS asks delicately, and Loki freezes for a split second before tumbling back across the couch, eyes wide, hands splayed out in front of him as though trying to catch the escaping threads of himself, gather himself back into his body.
Tony blinks. “What?” he demands, straightening a little. “That’s…that’s not possible. Are you sure?”
“Sorry, sweetheart. Some alpha I’m cracking up to be, huh?” He laughed, small and bitter, then jumped off the bed and padded towards the bathroom. “I’ll run you a hot bath, round up some breakfast…”
“Please don’t,” Tony says. His voice breaks on the second word. It’s the last thing he says to Steve before he leaves the room.
Steve nodded, and pulled off his cowl, ignoring Clint shouting at him to “stop being such a lovesick idiot, fight now, talk later” and decking another Hydra agent with the shield. He turned to face the camera, his expression stubborn as he could make it.
If asked later, Steve wouldn’t be able to say exactly when he knew he was in love. It was more of a slow creep than a revelation; a dazzling smile, a kind word, a casual brush against Steve’s shoulder on a bad day. Slowly, Tony wove himself into Steve’s space, a kudzu vine edging into every inch of Steve’s routine until he couldn’t even think of being without him.
Tony must have convinced Maria to set up a screen in the room where Steve’s body is being kept. He knows this because about half an hour into waiting, an Agent Katri comes in and does so, a vaguely perturbed expression on her face. She sweeps dark hair back from her eyes, a long, aquiline nose leading her face as she peers around the room like a bloodhound.
Steve swallows. “I know that,” he says. “I know, I just. I just thought I should say it, that’s all. So you know.”
“What did you see?” Tony asks, shivering when Loki drags one hand across the sensitive join of hip and thigh, fingers idling along the crease.
“Welcome home, Captain,” JARVIS tells him when he steps into the elevator. “I hate to trouble you when you’ve just arrived, but there’s a situation that requires your attention in the Avengers’ communal living room.”
“-love you, beautiful, sweet omega, so good for me-” Tony was saying, and Steve whined and opened himself up as much as he could. He was so sensitive, Tony’s fingers skating up his body, grazing over his nipples, and Steve squirmed and cried out.
"I don't have a hover board either," Steve teases, but he settles back into the seat and watches Tony fiddle with the controls, content to subject himself to his friend's whims.
Guiltily, Steve had printed off a full colour copy of the picture. He’s never needed to paint anything more in his whole life.
Tony grins. “Uh huh.” He glances over at the photo. He’s a lot younger, here. Peak twink days. He’d been feeling himself when this cover came out. He looks pretty sexy. “I should do a re-shoot. I’d rock the silver fox look. Make it more daddy. What do you think?”
Steve’s expression shifts through irritation, wry humour, and finally, into a curious kind of examination that Tony recognises well, now. It’s how Steve seems to look at him a lot these days, like he’s trying to puzzle Tony out.
“I’m pretty sure that’s why they stripped him,” Steve sighed. The smile that Bruce offered him was bitter. “The girl’s probably fine, right?”
Steve's smile is like the sun rising over the dark mountains. There might be trumpets. His eyes crinkle at the corners.
“Alpha,” Steve whimpered, and then he was coming: a slow, rolling, achingly sweet and good kind of climax that took him in waves. He could feel Tony shaking against him as his body tightened, moaning sweetness in his ear, thrusting until he could feel his alpha coming inside him again, filling him up, and oh that was so good too.
“Do you want a hug now?” Franklin asks him, and Steve nods. “Okay. And then I’ll go get daddy for you. Even if I’ll get in trouble.”
But part of Steve, the part of him that had loved reading the bodice rippers the omegas used to pass around in art school, had always dreamed of a bond. He’d dreamed of some gorgeous alpha to come and bond him and save him from the dragging monotony of living hand to mouth every day, from cradle to grave. He’d dreamed of a family, of someone he could have a child with. It was something he’d been sure he’d never have. Now, with the serum, he still wasn’t sure. When he walked into a room heads turned. People deferred to him. The serum had made him something other, caught halfway between alpha commanding officer and shy omega artist. It made sense that he hadn’t had much in the way of offers since waking up. Most people were intimidated, and that wasn’t what people were looking for in an omega. All that he’d been through, that his body had been through, and he still couldn’t find a mate.
But Thor is already moving, sitting down firmly on the couch against the wall. “As you know, I am kept apprised of what happens on Midgard while I am away, lest I am needed.” He fixes Tony with a wry look. “Heimdall sees all, and although I had renounced the throne, I am still a prince of Asgard. He must answer my questions as I pose them.”
No wonder Tony took her under his wing. “She’s smart. I mean, obviously, MIT at 15, but I mean she’s sharp, too. Wanna see something interesting?”
. The first time a quarterback had looked at him with a shy smile, a dimpled chin and bright sunshine-yellow hair, Tony had followed that boyish grin straight into a quick and dirty bleacher fuck, mud staining his tailored white trousers as white teeth were carefully tucked away behind pink, swollen lips. Stubble burn on his thighs was a new experience, but oh did Tony learn to love the feeling, the bruises on his hips, the feeling of being small and held safe in someone’s arms. At fifteen, every college boy was bigger than him, and he did love a good pair of guns. That winter, coming home for Christmas and reencountering all of the old Captain America propaganda was like seeing his first circuit board; suddenly, everything clicked into place. The world made sense, born anew again. He’d never jacked off more in his life, prior or since, than he did during that week and a half.
“Got it,” Steve said, already spinning the footage back. JARVIS had set it to a 1.5x speed, which was mostly what Steve and Tony preferred when they were poring over battle footage together. JARVIS hadn’t needed to be prompted, because Steve and Tony had a routine. They had a life that they’d built together, complete and mundane and predictable.
“Yours,” he agreed. He walked over to the door, then hesitated, hand on the knob. “You’re okay here, yeah? Is your heat coming? Should I cancel? I didn’t smell anything on you, but…”
Sam looks like he doesn’t know what to do with Steve sitting on his doorstep in the middle of the night, elbows propped on his knees, hands in his hair, but he doesn’t look surprised either. He hefts his bag, then steps around him, unlocking the door and going inside without a word. Steve follows him like a dejected puppy, aware of the picture he makes and not caring. He locks the door behind him and follows Sam into the kitchen.
Franklin wrinkles his nose. “Bloody clothes. They were probably nice before, but now they’re pretty icky.”
Immediately, Tony reaches out, smoothing his hands up Steve’s chest and over his shoulders. “You’re a cruel man, Rogers, depriving me of all this.”
Eventually, a familiar tug makes Steve’s breastbone ache something fierce. He closes his eyes, compresses himself down, and lets the data stream he’s been riding without knowing it all this time take him back to where he belongs.
“Specious accusations,” Bruce says mildly. He digs his thumbs into Tony’s spine with particular viciousness, and Tony lets out a low, laughing groan.
“And Stark?” Natasha asks carefully. She offers him a shot, tossing it back herself when he shakes his head at her.
Tony blinks at him, rearranging some assumptions. “I can maybe come twice, but usually once. If the sex is really good, I’ve been able to have a dry orgasm even after I’ve maxed out, but you’d have to work for it. Also, I do have a cock ring,” Tony offers, and Loki’s brow furrows in confusion. “It helps keep me from coming.”
It starts like this; brunches on Sundays, first, before the church crowd gets out and mobs the cafés, just to help provide some routine. They talk about the team, how the last battle went, strategy, SHIELD interference. They make a quiet kind of peace. Then it was sparring, and then late nights, movies on Thursdays, Steve sketching in the workshop when he has some rare down time and completing mission reports when he doesn’t. Slowly, Steve becomes habit. Steve brings him pizza. Steve laughs. Steve brings him fruit for smoothies, expensive coffee, a dozen cronuts.
Tony swallows, because it sounds a little like he’s going to be punished, and not necessarily in a bad way. “You seem entirely unsurprised by all this.”
“Okay,” Tony says, subdued. He lets himself burrow a little deeper into the warmth of Steve’s body, pressing his nose to the warm skin over his brachial artery. He imagines he can feel Steve’s pulse against his lips, steady and strong. “Guess you’ll just have to show me, huh, soldier.”
Tony could barely stop himself before. Now, with Steve pliant in his arms, he doesn’t even try. One tentacle slithers up between them, curling over Steve’s chest, pressing suckers all over him until one secures over a nipple. The sound Steve makes is nearly a squeak, his face burning, his eyes wide and dark with desire.
: a lot of these can get you HRT, believe it or not. They don’t just provide abortions, despite how some people wanna spin it. There’s also probably some local orgs near you, depending on where you live.
B E D, he taps onto Tony’s hipbone. It makes Tony shiver in his arms, and Steve presses his smile to the warm, dewy curve of Tony’s neck. R E S T.
He can catch glimpses of that man, some days; the way Cap stands when he barks an order, or the way he can churn out some polished, heartfelt speech at the drop of a hat, like some corny monologue he’d practised in the mirror for weeks. But other days there’s just Steve; the dork who smudges graphite all over his face when he’s caught up in a sketch, who forgets his size enough to knock into things and people when he’s tired. Steve flushes when he’s teased about women, and he flushes when he’s teased about men, and apparently he kisses like he’s drowning, like the desperation of the ice is still trapped between his teeth. Steve brings Tony coffee and he takes away Tony’s alcohol. Steve’s a card shark, but he can’t lie to save his life. Steve believes in God, and his country, and America. Steve’s learning not to trust his government. And then there’s the anger; bright red flashes of it, leaping up and burning into Tony like a brand. There’s triumph, there, knowing he’s knocked Captain America off balance. Daddy Never Loved Me means Tony never did learn to distinguish between positive attention and any attention at all. He’s self-aware enough, at least, to know that much.
So here we are! So, that just took…huh, like almost 100k words to get them to this place. Now if only they can keep going with the whole…open, honest communication thing for another few thousand words and we’ll all be set, huh?
He’s slumped over the island in the kitchen, the cold marble doing wonders for his pounding headache. He’d been starving and too exhausted to figure out what to feed himself, and had mostly been hoping that stumbling zombie-like into a place with other humans might gain him a pre-made snack. Bruce, bless him, had taken one look at Tony and cooked him a carb-loaded breakfast that kind of made Tony feel like he was a pregnant invalid. But in a good way, maybe. He feels cared for.
Steve paces the room a few more times. He pokes at the various projects Tony leaves half-finished everywhere. He peers at the old armours, feeling deeply unsettled when there’s no reflection to be seen in the highly polished metal.
“I served on the front lines of World War Two, infiltrating Hydra Camps where they were engaging in human experimentation,” Steve begins hotly, but Xavier holds up a hand.
He follows Tony up through the Triskelion, mostly for lack of anything else to do. Carol’s waiting for him outside, and she puts a silent arm around his shoulders and escorts him through. The way that Tony slumps into her shoulder is painful to watch. Steve desperately wishes he could hug him, but he supposes if he could, Tony wouldn’t be so damn sad.
“I cannot tell you yet,” Loki says, sounding weary. His fingers tighten on Tony’s wrists again, reflexive and frustrated. It’s never enough to bruise. “I must convince you to trust me. Come now, Stark, breathe. That’s it, slower now. Let me help you.”
“I- I can’t,” Steve grits out. He pulls his hand away from his face and turns around, reaching for the button to his floor. Tony’s standing just outside the elevator doors, expression somewhere between shock and bewilderment. “I’m so sorry, Tony, I’ll-later.”
“And how exactly are we supposed to become one, huh?” Tony asks, his lips moving against Steve’s mouth. Steve grins, takes Tony’s plush lower lip between his teeth.
“But some die of heartbreak,” Thor said, seriously. He did not phrase it as a question. “Sometimes, they go mad.”
“I’m just saying, it sounds like your friend is human,” Xavier says kindly. “We’ve talked about you holding yourself and others to a high standard. Most of your team seeks to rise to meet that standard. It is part of why you are good as a team leader. But Stark, as your second in command, is a realist. He’s meant to consider the angles of a situation, and try to make your dream a reality. Your team functions well because of this balance.”
. He sucks in a sharp breath, then lifts the sketchbook, turning to a new page. Tony has a visceral memory of fresh, white snow waiting for his first footprints. It sweeps cold over his skin, raising the dark hairs on his arms. “I can get in a good line every once in a while, but with words…”
“I’m much better at reading social cues than you,” JARVIS says, all charming false outrage, and Tony laughs and closes his eyes. “If I might suggest a radically different course of behaviour…”
This is a kind of therapy he is intimately familiar with; soldiers around a table, sharing drinks and horror stories. He remembers Peggy’s unsmiling face, her cool professionalism masking what he knew was genuine care. He remembers, too, his Howling Commandos. He thinks Jim Morita would have liked Clint a lot.
He can see it, now, with startling clarity, stretching back through the years; this huge empty house with no one in it but a tiny black-haired boy and servants moving through the space like ghosts, a loving butler trailing after him. In every room, the image of Captain America stared down from on high, biceps and shield and sharp jaw and blue eyes all chopped up into disparate pieces, the enormity of a hero that could not be contained in a single image. He imagines Howard, the absent and looming figure, shutting a curious boy desperate for affection out of every room he wanted to be in. Every sour interaction with Tony, every defensive and self-deprecating barb burning into Steve’s chest shifts under the shockwave, re-contextualised.
“Spoilers!” Tony shouts, waving an impassioned hand and nearly knocking over the popcorn. “Movie first, discussion after. You know the rules, woman.”
“Nothing yet,” Steve says, and Tony’s stomach turns to lead. Steve glances away, then back at Tony. “If you wanted me to come-”
Steve’s halfway through the Sunday Times Crossword on a Tuesday afternoon, but he’s finding it hard to focus. Generally, the crossword is passed from him to Bruce to Tony, in ascending order of ‘who’s the most likely to solve this.’ He’s stuck on 14 down, but putting the paper back on the kitchen table for Bruce to pick at means giving up, and well. The less said about his ability to do that, the better.
Steve sucks in a breath. His nose stings. He tilts Tony up to face him, and the look in his eyes is so fierce and lovely and lost that he barely even notices the way his own chest shudders. The way his own mouth is trembling.
“That…sounds kind of awesome, actually,” Grace Kilcommons says. She works in WebDev, and could not be gayer if she was wrapped in rainbow flags. Tony approves especially of her suspenders. He’s of the opinion that outside of Steve Rogers and butch dykes, suspenders look terrible and hipster and should be banned from the city. “What if we put together a kind of hodgepodge of Irish American contributions to the NYC landscape? The canal, the Empire State Building, the Old Croton Dam…”
“Yes, Tony, yes,” Steve babbles, half out of his mind with it. The metal of the cuffs is straining, a quiet clicking creak, and Tony reaches down and takes Steve’s dripping cock in his hand, working him once, twice. Steve arches his back, eyes fluttering shut. His mouth opens, a gasp that might be Tony’s name or a benediction spilling from his lips as he comes, warm and sticky over Tony’s fingers, his own stomach, his chest.
“I know you are,” Steve says, glancing back at him. The smile he offers Tony is genuine, even as it trembles. “I know you tried.” Tony winces. “Promise me one thing?”
“It’s just a design, Tony. You can leave off if you want,” he’d tried one night, and Tony had flipped up his welding mask and gave him a look that a lesser man would shrink from.
The man takes off his mask, and James Buchannan Barnes stares down at him, a familiar grin spread across his face. His eyes are empty, cold and clear as a fishbowl.
“You’re going to have to be hospitalised yourself if this keeps up. Once Tony’s bloodwork comes back, Bruce can tell you how long it will be before you can be with each other again. You can calculate if it’s worthwhile to take suppressants, but in the meantime, sleeping with a fellow pack omega will stabilise you a little. Enough for you to get some badly-needed rest.”
“Right,” he says, and Steve frowns. That ever-present crease in his brow reforms as he moves closer, then away, hovering awkwardly. He holds his hands up like he’s trying to calm a feral animal.
to avoid the madness of midtown, then pulls onto the FDR. All the while, Steve stares out the window, watching the city slip by. The Upper East Side is one of those neighbourhoods that still looks the same in a lot of places; the old buildings and the women in bright floppy hats, men in suits and little delis on the corner. The rich live the same as they ever has, he supposes. It’s the rest of the world that has to change.
Hope y’all are satisfied with how I’m tying up things as we move along. If you aren’t, let me know! I’m always happy to talk shop. <3
Steve pulls away, embarrassed. Tony grins at him. "Debrief later. First we help with clean-up. You know the drill."
The silence continued for a while, but Steve stopped on the stairs up to the exit, curious himself. He hadn’t even thought about it. Outside, daylight had already begun to break, thin blue light filtering in from the wide rectangle of sky. Steve could hear the faint calls of birds: chickadee, cardinal, sparrows, and titmouses. Sometimes Sam took him on birding walks, and he liked being able to identify the sounds. It felt like hearing a secret language, all its own.
Tony hums. A strange expression crosses his face. Rare, to see something in Tony that he does not recognise. It’s there and gone in an instant, but something about it niggles at Steve’s mind. When has he seen Tony look like that before?
“Depression takes many forms, Captain; excessive exercise, difficulty sleeping, lack of attention towards previous interests, irritability…” The professor shrugs expansively. “There is a misconception that functionality must be impeded, but sometimes high functionality can be symptomatic too. If one just robotically goes through the motions of their day and creates a mindless routine to follow, it’s entirely possible to be high-functioning and terrifically depressed. I think a recklessness in battle and an over-commitment to dangerous work speaks for itself.”
“This is bad,” Pepper says, breaking Tony’s train of thought, and he turns back to her with a frown.
“Mm?” Tony pulled the bottle from his lips with an obscene sound, wiping at his mouth with the back of his hand, and Steve couldn’t have looked away if he tried.
“You didn’t wear your helmet again,” Tony observes, and Steve rumbles a laugh that travels from his chest and into Tony’s.
“The securement of Sir’s happiness and wellbeing,” JARVIS said, and Steve froze, lifting his hand gently away from the page to prevent an accident. JARVIS’ voice was warm, filled with contentment, and Steve could feel his throat clog. He hadn’t cried during his engagement, but he certainly wanted to now.
“Agreed.” Collins spares Tony a speaking glance, and he nods at her. The Maria Stark Foundation had just approved a grant for five million dollars to Head Start that week. Collins was the only moderate republican on the security taskforce, and Tony desperately needed her on his side if he was going to win this thing. People respected Collins. Cochran was the whale, though, and Tony needed to find out exactly what it was he needed to do to get Cochran to see things his way.
Tony laughs, his head tipping back, baring the long line of his throat. Against his skin, old bruises from battle run into the new: mottled yellow and green mixing with the new red and purple, layers of evidence of Steve’s mouth overlapping and mixing against the olive tones of his throat.
“I’ll come back, to say goodnight,” Steve repeated. Then he turned, and headed for the door. He wouldn’t have the strength to leave, otherwise. Already he’d spent two awful, freezing cold nights down here this past week, Tony howling and pounding ineffectually against the glass to try to reach him on the other side. He’d cried so much that he wasn’t sure how there was any liquid left to spare in his body.
“I know I fucked up. I still-…” Tony sucks in a shuddering breath. “God knows I have so many regrets. But I do genuinely think that the system we have in place right now is better than no system at all. It took us a while to get here, but we were doing so good, weren’t we? We’d…it seemed like-”
Steve has a tell, when he’s thinking too hard. The very corner of his mouth purses just the tiniest bit. It makes him look irritated, but also kind of cute in a pouty way. Tony hates that he keeps noticing these things. “You really mean that,” he says, slowly. “Talking to me over video is easier for you.”
“I can tell that you’re embarrassed, about, y’know.” He gestures to the light show that is currently Tony’s lower half.
Tony swallows audibly. “You’ve always been a sap,” he allows. He pulls away, then, and Steve lets him. He waits as Tony turns to face him with his eyebrows raised, his expression deceptively amused. It does nothing to disguise his terror, but Steve knows that this is just Tony’s way of preserving his pride. He’ll fix it, anyhow. He’s going to fix all of it. “Is that it, then? Is that the end of your big Captain America speech?”
“It is good to see you looking so well, too!” Thor boomed. Natasha lifted her hand in a tiny wave, Bruce and Clint nodding, and Steve blushed and ducked his head. “Come down when you are ready, and we shall feast together!”
“That’s me,” Steve agreed, “an upstart omega with no sense of his place. I haven’t got any biological family to speak of, and I grew up as poor as they come. I haven’t even got a ring.”
“Yeah,” Tony says, as though he can hear Steve’s stupid, ineffectual nagging. He puts on a plastic smile, a pair of sunglasses. Then he opens the door, gets out of the car, and starts the long trip back to Steve’s funeral.
Maria types something into the computer, and the chamber begins to slide closed again. Steve jumps out as quick as he can. There’s nothing more unsettling than being sealed into his own coffin. After his first attempts at moving his body, he’d given up quickly. It was too much of a trip to lie in his own lifeless flesh and will it to move. It just made him feel more dead.
Tony blinks at Rhodey, a little startled by his candour. To be fair, they’ve been here an hour and it doesn’t look like things are gonna be slowing down anytime soon. He goes back to sketching out a new helmet for the Mark 51. After the scare with Moonstone, he doesn’t want to leave any of his weak spots open.
“You’re supposed to be recovering, not taking care of me,” Tony says easily, putting the soldering iron down. He wipes his hands on a dirty grease rag, which does more harm than good, and Steve holds the sandwich out of reach.
Rogers didn’t say any more, and after a moment, Tony rolled his eyes. He stripped all of his outerwear off, hanging his wet clothes on the pegs by the door, standing his boots by the door.
“How is that sound not irritating the hell out of you?” Tony said, laughing, and Steve blinked confusedly at him. “The fridge?”
He walks over and picks up the soup, takes a taste. It’s warm and hearty, even if the prevailing flavours are mostly salt and pepper.
He calls for Steve in a low voice, waits for his touch. He tips his face up like a flower when Steve leans in to kiss him gently. They haven’t talked, still, but Steve knows better than anyone how Tony squirrels away the more delicate parts of himself. And he’s selfish, in the end. He’s wanted this for so, so long. He doesn’t remember what it’s like not to want this. Most astounding of all, he can have it. He can have whatever he wants.
Steve makes a sound like he’s been shot—Tony would know, he’s heard both—and then leans in, taking Tony’s mouth like he’s sieging an AIM base. His tongue drags filthy over Tony’s upper lip, flicking over the corner of his mouth before dipping inside and curling slow against Tony’s. Steve kisses like he’s starving and Tony is blessed ambrosia, like Tony’s the best thing he’s ever tasted, a low moan rumbling through his broad barrel of a chest and into Tony’s. Tony does his best to give as good as he’s getting, but Steve just wrenches away with a wet sound that goes straight to Tony’s cock and gathers his wrists in one hand, jerking the sash off and holding it against Tony’s wrists.
Still, as he watched Tony out on the water, he found himself thinking that he didn’t regret a thing if it had led him to this strange, incredible, beautiful man. There was a lazy grace to him, as he stood up on the board. Steve had always thought that, though. The way he moved through the world––hand gestures that made Steve want to suck on his fingers, a dangerous smirk that both irritated and titillated in turns, and god, the things that came out of his mouth. Steve had never met anyone so infuriating and intoxicating, and he never wanted to have to know what it was like to be without him again. He wanted Tony, for the rest of his life.
“Miss Potts will certainly notice if you begin attending all of your meetings,” JARVIS says drolly, and Tony shrugs.
Tony gets there before he does, just in time to get his hands under Loki as he staggers forward. Thor comes after him, less tired, but certainly having come from a battle. Blood is matted in his beard, a few splashes caught in his hair. His chest plate is strangely melted, and Tony surveys the two of them for a few long, silent seconds. Then he swallows, and steps back, away from Loki, because through the portal both he and Tony can see a place that is certainly not one they recognise. There’s equipment visible, there: armour, lying on a stone shelf as dark and richly coloured as onyx, and it is all too familiar. Loki sways dangerously on his feet.
Reed nods, slowly. He reaches out and gently adjusts whatever it is that Tony’s working on, his brow furrowing ever so slightly when Tony bats his hand away. “You’re sure about this.”
“We’ve done this every year, Shellhead,” Steve reminded him. “Natasha even did it, two years ago, remember?”
“I dunno how many times I’ve gotta go over this with you Sleepy Jean, but not everybody’s got super-solider metabolism in this madhouse,” Tony says, pushing half of the fruit over onto Steve’s plate. He pops a slice into his mouth and crunches down on it to appease Steve’s frown. “What’s that mean, anyway, the opposite. I’m un-fired? Promoted? Hired? Hired for what?”
“You are perfect, alpha,” he said, firmly. “You are the best mate any omega could ask for. I have never felt so loved as I have when I’m with you.”
“I don’t feel like a very good man,” Rogers muttered, mostly under his breath, and Tony laughed in delight. He wasn’t sure if he’d been meant to hear that bit.
Rogers shook his head. He bit his lip, eyes flickering to Tony’s face then back to his arm. “Could you…?”
“You’re so good,” Steve slurs, and Tony flushes hot. “God, you’re so fucking good, Tony, don’t stop, please don’t stop-”
“Hey,” Steve says, reaching a hand out. He closes it over Tony’s wrist, a streak of grey smudging over Tony’s skin. “You’re not a screw-up. And that’s not… You have triggers. I know that better than anyone. You’ve never lashed out like that at Bruce, or Natasha-”
The priest huffs a sigh. “Recriminations do nothing but harm, my child. Forgive yourself your trespasses, as the Lord does. Give yourself permission to do what it is that you wish to do: love your soulmate.
“Unless, of course, what’s stopping you from healing isn’t magical, but technological,” he says. He’s exhibiting the kind of mania that Steve knows well: too long spent working and too many cups of caffeine. His brain is racing two hundred miles faster than his mouth, the evidence of it shown in how many screens Tony has up and running, the electrodes hooked up to his brain spitting out readings that Friday and him are interpreting and using to recalibrate scans faster than Steve can even parse what he’s looking at.
“I would!” someone shouted, to a series of loud cheers and jeers. Tony startled, as though he’d forgotten their audience, before a wry smile slipped over his face.
Hill shrugs. “For the first meeting, it would probably be best to go up to the school, yes. Doctor Xavier has custom-built facilities that are irreplicable.”
There’s no quantifiable reason for it, but Reed forcing his way onto the case dramatically changes Tony’s emotional landscape from dispossessed malaise to driven focus. A bit of colour returns to his cheeks. The light reappears in his eyes.
“It is as your Captain says,” Loki says. His eyes are flashing, all the fur on his body standing on end. He growls, almost as if he cannot help it. “Thor is unharmed.”
“Tony!” Steve hisses. Then he sucks in a breath, shaking his head like a wet dog. “Sorry. You’re…I’m sorry. Give me a minute.”
Steve must pass out, because the next thing he knows Tony’s sliding into bed next to him. The room is dark, just the glow from the midtown lights coming up from below through the plate glass windows. He can’t make out Tony’s expression in the dark, but he lifts his arm, inviting Tony closer. Tony ducks into his side, and Steve shuffles him up until his head is nestled on Steve’s chest, his arm splayed low on the smooth plane of Tony’s lower back.
“How do you wanna do this?” Tony asks, and Loki stills, glancing up at him from between his lashes. He grins wickedly, fingers still touching Tony everywhere and yet maddeningly avoiding the places Tony wishes to be touched most.
It would have been easier if Tony had said that he didn’t want to, but Steve knew Tony better than Tony wanted him to. After years of friendship and five months of loving him in any way that Tony would let him, he knew how to read Tony’s black moods just as well as his bright and brilliant ones. What had sat on Tony’s face when he’d denied Steve the first time was heartbreak and self-hatred. There was nothing in the way of rejection, or disgust, or awkwardness. He’d looked gutted, and there was little Steve wouldn’t do to stop Tony from feeling like that. Steve wasn’t the kind of omega who entrapped an alpha into a bond, but Tony wanted this, Steve thought. Tony just didn’t feel like he deserved it.
I’ve got most of the next section written already because it was originally gonna be part of this chapter before I realised that a single 20+k chapter was absolutely bonkers, so it shouldn’t be too long between updates. Thanks as always for your patience and comments, y’all! Getting feedback/being able to chat with y’all is so much of what makes writing this fic worthwhile to me, so please drop me a line. I’m always happy to talk meta. <3 <3 <3 Thanks especially to my little crew of hardcore dedicated readers, who have been my cheer squad through the rough bits. You know who you are.
“Cool.” He leaves it on the little table under the board. “I don’t have enough tchotchkes. I should have more tchotchkes, right?”
“Fair hair and brawn?” Loki says, sounding disgusted, and Tony laughs. “I will not advise you, as I am ill-suited for it. I would only ask that you maintain your clarity in the battle ahead.”
“You were created to be the first and best of your kind,” Tony tells him, shutting off the water. “You’re the best thing I’ve made in my life.”
Amora looks at him speculatively for a moment, her eyes flashing with gold light. “No, I don’t believe we do,” she says sweetly, and Tony swallows as something in Cap shifts towards her, body going loose and pliant.
Pepper frowns for a moment before handing him a tablet. “This is what we’ve got from ears on the ground. They’re talking enhanced registration and licensing. That’ll never pass through a democratically-controlled congress, let alone the U.N., so I don’t think we’ve really got to worry about that right now. But if your approval rating goes down, then…”
Steve feels the shaky, nakedly grateful smile that breaks over Tony’s face like it his own body: the ache in his cheeks, the heaviness of unshed tears in his throat. The tingle of his skin right before Reed claps a hand to Tony’s shoulder.
“Fuck,” Tony snarls, twisting out of the way as another tendril of flame arcs past him, narrowly missing his shoulder. He can feel the sear of heat even inside the suit. “I may melt after all.”
Tony swallows, rubbing his hands together under the hot water. He knows exactly what Thor is insinuating. A quick glance at Natasha’s expression reveals nothing but wariness in her pale green eyes, and she holds Tony’s gaze as she hoists herself up to sit on the worktop.
“Because I haven’t got my priorities straight,” he says, brutally honest. “Amora made me watch you die, over and over again. You wanted me to see Xavier because you knew I wasn’t okay after that, and you were right.” Tony restrains the childish urge to crow at the admission. “I can’t promise that I’ll make the right call on the field, and I can’t stay off it and not-…and not hate myself, if something happened to you.” Steve pauses, glances around the table, lets a furious blush steal over his beautiful bones and still he continues on, determined in the face of his own embarrassment. “Any of you.” His voice gains confidence as he speaks. “Xavier showed me that maybe I shouldn’t trust myself to make the right call right now, if it comes down to putting someone I care about in danger in order to save a civilian, or for the greater good, or to stop whatever it is we’re fighting next.
Eventually, he turns around and heads to the workshop. The wet sciences have never been his forte, but cold metal he understands.
“Oh, God,” Tony mutters. Distantly, some horrible part of him smugly notes that Steve does in fact seem impressed.
, Tony admits to himself, sinking deep into his self-deprecation. Still, this is worse than he’d imagined.
“The Winter Solider is an assassin,” Steve says, and Tony glances up to see Steve’s face has paled. “He’s the best assassin in the world, Tony. What else could they need him for?”
Tony stares for a moment more. Then he shakes his head and heads inside, leaving Steve to scramble after him.
Bucky huffs a laugh. There’s a faint clink of metal on glass or ceramic. A drawer opens and shuts. “I’ll see you in Florida, Tony.”
Tony turns, then, and Steve stumbles back, because he’d been so close. Tony’s face is right there, and Steve is having the kind of thoughts he thought he’d buried a long time ago. His mind is always a little dangerous around Tony. Steve has always prided himself on his self-control, but it’s hard, seeing Tony at his most vulnerable like this. He’s practically been living in Tony’s pocket, and it’s giving his traitorous brain the worst kind of thoughts. Thoughts that he knows are out of bounds, when he’s already violating Tony’s privacy so deeply like this. Thoughts he knows he doesn’t deserve to have, when he’d stood over Tony’s body and held the shield above Tony’s bloody face, and Tony had said-
“I still have JARVIS keeping an eye on me,” Steve admits, sighing. “And the nightmares-” He stops, taking a breath. Last night, with Tony cradled safe in his arms, he hadn’t dreamt anything of note at all. “It’s getting better.”
Tony was laughing now, a bitter, nasty thing that made Steve think of empty bottles of vodka and a cold bed. “You met my old man,” he said, grinning wide and cruel. “What did he think of omegas, Steve? Did he think they were powerful, on their own? Equipped to run Stark Industries? Qualified, in the eyes of the American public?”
“It was actually World War II that changed the conception of masculinity into the terrifying, strict thing it became in the 50’s. Even homosexual contact was actually more widely accepted in some ways, although of course it was a behaviour and not an identity. Men-who-have-sex-with-men, not homosexual. There’s some really great books about queer history you should check out, both in New York and in Germany.
“And none of the other suits are comparable in field tests,” Tony grumbles, rubbing a hand over his face. He glances over at Rhodey, who is already poking at the sparking elbow joint of the War Machine armour. There’s a long black Gerber sticking out of it, and Tony whistles low.
R U N Y O U R P R O G R A M, Steve taps into his ribs as he pulls Tony’s earlobe into his mouth. He bites down gently on the plush skin, and it makes Tony shudder under his hands.
“Oh,” Steve said, then, because he had known. He had violated Tony’s trust, Tony’s body, in a way that was unforgiveable. Steve didn’t understand biology or science the way that Bruce did, but he knew what this was, and it wasn’t antibodies or anything like that. This was alpha hormone, and it was absolutely none of Steve’s business why Tony needed regular shots of alpha-hormone. That had nothing to do with the arc reactor. Tony had lied, which meant he didn’t want to tell Steve about this. He hadn’t wanted anyone to know.
"So, the arc reactor," Tony muses. Loki's nostrils flare slightly. "It's a beauty, I know, I'm flattered, really."
Tony grins, and pulls up the first document: the Japanese defence contracts, which he has yet to actually read. Hasegawa.
The cherry blossoms are barely blooming when Steve goes for his run in the morning, but he can see the potential for show-stopping awe there. He thinks about staying for the festival, coming back with bright pastels and his sketchbook, but he knows that’s just a pipe dream. Sam shouts at him good-naturedly as he passes, once, twice, and he grins a little at the old game. It’s peaceful, here, compared to the constant bustle of his city. He’d missed that, a little, in New York.
“I’m late because I fucked my omega six ways from Sunday this morning?” Tony grinned, taking a wipe out of the container they kept by the bed and cleaning his softening cock with it. “Please. That’s practically my MO.” His eyes dropped to skim over Steve’s body with a proprietary smugness that made Steve want to preen. “And everyone knows exactly what it is that I’m dealing with at home. No one could blame me when I’ve got Captain America in my bed.”
“Maybe pass on the news this morning,” he said, tossing the peel in the trash. Bruce just chuckled and turned the page.
She waltzes into Tony’s workshop with the same aplomb as always: completely sure of her welcome, head held high. She waves a tablet in one hand above her head, her sea-glass eyes bright with excitement.
Tony can't, so he doesn't say anything. Later, when Tony reveals Loki’s assist and Clint expresses his shock, Tony and Thor share the strangest of looks. Thor looks fragile, nakedly grateful in a way that Tony hasn’t been in public since he was a child. He looks tired, worn to the bone. Tony wonders what it is to be a thousand years old, what it is to wait for half to become whole after such a breaking as to tear the bridges between worlds asunder. Thor smiles weakly at him, then looks away.
“Want anything?” Tony asks, and Loki glances up from beneath his eyelashes at him, a half-arsed travesty of a tease. “Mm, don’t try to distract me now.”
“You’re my team,” Steve counters hotly, impotent rage building in him. It’s not for Tony, though, he can admit that much; it’s at himself, and for the people proposing registration at all. He’s furious at everyone for reducing Tony to this state. “I’m supposed to be making the calls. How can I do that when I don’t have all the information?”
“She barely has a scent most days,” Steve said. “It’s…while you were gone, the longer time passed, the more your scent was replaced with the rest of the pack’s.”
“Je suis allergique aux fraises,” Pepper confesses, clearly a punchline, and Loki chuckles, his eyes flickering to Tony. Pepper turns in her seat in reaction, and Tony raises his eyebrows at them, heading across the room and past them towards the kitchen.
"How can you tell?" Cap asks, turning to face him. He's breathing heavily, a burn mark scraped across one purpling cheekbone. Tony pops his faceplate and touches it, lightly. Cap leans into the metal a little, and Tony smiles. "I'm alright. The cold feels nice, though."
The crowd had hushed a bit to catch Steve’s words, and he could feel heat rushing up the back of his neck, but it was too late to stop now. He’d already gotten this far.
Tony sighs. He turns back to the monitor, pulls up another data log. He pushes something back towards the monitor Reed is using, which apparently startles him so much that his head comes down to squint more closely at the screen, his neck stretching like taffy.
“The time before, I mean. At the courthouse.” Tony explains. “He thought he was being kind, or something, probably.”
“Fuck,” Tony breathed, and then he was stretching up, his mouth taking Steve’s in a deliberate, devastating kiss that sent shivers all the way to Steve’s toes. He hooked his thighs around Tony’s waist, using his heels to drag him in closer as Tony kissed him, and kissed him, and kissed him. Steve could hold his breath for ages and still he was lightheaded, and when Tony pulled away he gasped like he’d been drowning, oxygen filling his lungs in a dizzying rush.
“As much as I’d love to leave you to your fate, I’d miss that sweet little ass of yours,” Tony said, mock-mournfully. He pushed himself to sitting, and Steve cracked one eye open to watch as a few heavy droplets of his cum dripped over the lines of Tony’s abs, down towards his thighs. He couldn’t help but lick his lips, and it was only Tony’s sharp whistle that brought him back to himself. “Oy, my eyes are up here.”
“Jesus fuck, look at you,” Tony whispered, and Steve moaned his agreement. “Your mouth is pornographic, you know that?”
Twenty minutes in, Steve is up by three and overheating in his clothes. He peels his sweater off and tosses it onto the bench with Tony’s suit jacket, rolling his own sleeves up. Tony wipes the back of his hand over his mouth. Sweat beads at his temples, and Steve grins at him, spinning the ball on one finger.
“As you know, the Democratic Party does not endorse registration,” Durbin says, leaning back in his chair. “Neither do we endorse lethal force being applied to American citizens, regardless of the power they possess. I believe in due process, as per the constitution. If the Avengers can’t abide by the laws of this country, they should answer to the courts like any other citizen.”
“That doesn’t make it right,” Steve argues hotly, but Xavier just turns that same beatific smile on him.
“Shit,” Tony says, rolling to the left as the woman in white takes another shot, a laser of bright white light that shears through the air. He rolls back over as coms come back online. “Avengers, I’ve got eyes on The Winter Soldier.”
“Let’s move,” Tony says, flipping the faceplate shut. The Avengers file into the quinjet, Thor taking a moment to say something quiet to Loki, Widow squeezing Pepper’s hand before following Hawkeye out of view. Tony offers Pepper a salute, then nods at Loki. He watches as Loki raises a hand, the sigils on the ground lighting up as Clint powers up the jet, leaving it floating above the landing pad. The sturdy floor of the tower’s landing disappears, replaced by the purplish wisps of a cloud in a pre-dawn sky.
Steve follows Tony down to the communal kitchen. Peter’s there, shovelling a too-big bite of waffle into his face, and Tony spares him a wave as he beelines for the coffee pot.
The clock in the hall chimes the hour, and Steve takes a breath and lets it out. “Time’s up, I guess.”
Rogers exhaled harshly, shaking his head. “First off, I know for a fact Edwin Jarvis asked you ‘round to his for the holidays, and you rebuffed him. That man followed you all the way to the damn middle of this cesspit of a state, leaving behind all the glitz of the city, because he cares, and you still push him away.”
“Of course.” She clears her throat as well, and Tony remembers this awkwardness. Neither of them were ever particularly good at emotions. “Will that be all, Mr. Stark?”
Natasha grins at that, vicious, all teeth. “Oh, I think that’s progressing quite well,” she says, her voice a terrifying purr. “You have him whipped, Cassanova. Keep it up and we may have to add him to the roster.”
“Some of these children have scales, or fur. Their obscured epidermis is all anyone will ever see. So what is one’s definition of enhanced? We’re not better, or even necessarily advantaged. We’re just different.” Steve nods again, because he agrees with that. “However, that does not mean that I expect all of these children to become X-Men.”
“There’s no form you could take,” Steve says seriously, stepping into the elevator and crowding Tony up against the wall, “no change you could undergo, and certainly no physical difference you could possibly have that would make me want you any less than I do.” He grins at Tony, half bashful and half wicked, and oh. Tony is in so, so much trouble. “I thought you knew how much that was, but clearly I’ve got work to do.”
There’s a dry rasp: skin over skin. Steve’s lips tingle faintly with warmth, and then he can’t stop himself. His eyes snap open, and Tony’s face is there. His eyes are closed, lashes a dark sweep over his cheeks. He looks beautiful, and Steve is struck suddenly by how much he
“You heard our conversation, in the kitchen,” Peter says, because that’s the kind of man he is. Steve can’t help the fond smile that spills over his face.
“I do, sir.” Tony clears his throat and swipes at his face again. “I’ve been given ample reason, over the years.”
Sorry for disappearing. A lot of crazy shit happened, chief among them being that I lost access to the email that is attached to all my fandom stuff and then I got a new job that has been taking up all my time. But hey, thanks COVID for something, eh?
“You could sneak out the back,” Tony said, sounding reluctant even to himself, but Rogers only laughed.
He puts his hand into the cryochamber first, feeling a little silly about it. Touching his own hand doesn’t seem to have any effect, so he pushes through the side, then lies down on top of his own motionless body. His head sinks back into his own head. He lines his feet up as best he can. Then he concentrates on trying to move his hand, and have his flesh hand come with it. Again and again, he lifts his hand, but nothing happens. He flexes his toes. He takes a deep breath. He shouts, but it doesn’t do a single thing. Nothing moves. He’s lying in a coffin with his own corpse, and he can’t do a single damn thing about it. His body might as well be another piece of furniture.
“JARVIS,” Steve said, evenly enough as he set up his pastels. “You shouldn’t have. I didn’t even get you anything.”
Steve rises and pulls Peter into a hug. He freezes for a moment, two, but then he relaxes into it. He rests his head against Steve’s shoulder.
“What do you mean,” Tony says flatly. Steve doesn’t really know. He looks at his hands, fingers wrapped oh so carefully around the yellow cardboard. A little girl with riotous curls smiles back at him from the box. After a while, he hears Tony take another bite of sandwich.
Steve nodded, fingering the little box in his pocket. It had been short notice, at the height of the holiday season, but as soon as Joe knew what Steve wanted the ring for, he’d insisted. The holidays were the best time for proposals, Joe’d told him, very serious. He wanted Steve to know that he was a personal fan of the Rockefeller Center proposal, himself. Steve didn’t really have a plan, yet, but he figured he’d keep it with him. He’d know the right moment when it happened.
Tony, notably, is still staring off into the middle distance. He looks…haunted. It’s quickly becoming a familiar expression, one that Steve hates, and so he sidles up next to him, bumps him gently with his hip. To his delight, Tony rocks a little with the motion, his head whipping around. His eyes are wide, flickering wildly.
Hulk nods at that. “Hulk think Banner feel better soon. Hulk want burger. Hulk eat burger, then Banner back.”
One night, he can’t help but kiss Tony while he’s sleeping: slack and sickly pale, dark shadows laying out the shapes of his bones. Tony wakes with Steve’s name on his lips, wide eyed. He touches his mouth, sits up gasping. His eyes are wild in his face.
A few things happen in quick succession, then. First is that Tony pulls back as though he’s been scalded. His eyes are huge behind his sunglasses, painfully vulnerable. He looks terrified, his scent quickly turning sour, and Steve has just long enough to think
Steve groans. He tips his head forward and rests his cheek on the porcelain, eyes closed. “Fuck me.”
“Because this is a movie about how the marginalised people behind great and powerful men never get the recognition they deserve,” Pepper tells him, and Tony’s resulting laugh is the most genuine expression of contentment or joy Steve has seen him wear in days.
Tony’s mouth snapped shut as sure as if Steve had reached out and hit it closed. He looked equal parts horrified and bewildered. “What?” he croaked.
warnings: some intense discussion of homophobia, WWII, the AIDS crisis, internalised homophobia, statutory r*pe
“Sometimes, war is brutal by necessity,” Steve says. He keeps his body language soft, but his eyes are unflinching as he meets Tony’s gaze. “You know that, or you wouldn’t have bombed Gulmira.”
Steve is perched on the front of the float, legs hanging over the side. It looks good, Tony’s gotta say. The Empire State building is lit bright and gleaming, the Old Croton Dam and the Brooklyn Bridge framing it on either side. The Old Croton Dam spills real water down into the East River under the bridge, the water on a cycle pump that Tony’s quite proud of considering that this baby has to drive. Steve sits on the front edge in old-fashioned construction worker’s garb, looking every bit a boy of his time and unfairly handsome in his little pageboy cap and coveralls. The employees had put together a playlist of their favourite Irish and Irish American musicians, mostly filled with solid rock standards that are likely to get the crowd going. Jamie and Grace are up there with him, all of them dressed up and sharing coffee in tin cups, and Tony snaps a photo with his phone and sends it to Pepper. They look adorable, honestly, and Tony’s pretty proud of what they’ve managed to get done.
“I have to stay here, because I smell like Tony,” Riri said, slow, as though Natasha was very stupid.
Warmth curls in Tony’s stomach, aftershocks sending chills over his skin as the sweat cools. Eddys of air leave goose bumps in their wake.
It’s three in the morning. He’s spent all night working on a free consult for the MTA. Grand Central is an imperative part of New York’s infrastructure, but much of midtown’s tunnels had been damaged in the fight. The leviathans falling in the streets had weakened beams and steel tubes that had never been meant to take that much weight, let alone at terminal velocity. It was messy, expensive work to replace the metal structures the tunnels were made of, and even Manhattan Schist could only handle so much stress. He was nowhere close to being done. He just wanted a snack, and now here Steve was, bugging him about blockers of all things.
“He’s dangerous,” Bruce interrupts, “and now you’ve made his happiness contingent on you. Did you think about that? You could be all he has.”
Tony pressed two fingers inside of him, the same two he’d used inside Steve’s mouth. He pulled his mouth away, biting sharply at the soft curve of Steve’s arse. His thumb swept a firm line over Steve’s perineum, and Steve whined and rocked back into his touch.
Steve isn’t sure he’s felt like this before. What he’d felt for Peggy was so different; clearer, less jumbled up inside questions about sexuality and belonging and the
“How are you feeling?” Tony asks him, pulling out slowly, and Steve moans. He arches his back a little.
“I stopped mid-sweep when I heard you were in danger, and then I left when Clint was hit,” Natasha explains, voice surprisingly calm for someone talking such
“You’d know about madness,” Tony says, and Loki’s expression shifts sideways into unbridled fury. “You know, I’ve never asked Thor if you were this psycho before you found out daddy never loved you, or only after the whole torture in the void episode.”
“Your minx,” Steve corrected, opening his mouth, and Tony fed him another spoonful, then leaned down to lick half of it out of Steve’s mouth.
Tony laughs nervously. He stares out at the smoking rubble across the plaza: the crumpled town cars, the limping civilians. “I think the phrase you’d use here would be: ‘not as such.’”
Steve is just as gentle as promised, working so slow that Tony is most certainly hard again by the time he pulls his fingers out. He’s sure his collarbones are littered with a few marks, and he’s too old for that, surely. Steve likes marking him, though; he likes to see evidence that he’s been there, that this isn’t a dream, that Tony is still here with him. Tony made him promise to always do it in places that were easy to cover, but he kind of thinks it’s hot. He’ll never admit that to Steve, even if he’s pretty sure he knows.
“It’s barely started. And you know an orgasm cuts that right off for me half the time,” Tony says, easy. “Tell me what you need, Steven.”
Tony reels off some tentacle-filled college antics and explains the unique phenomenon that is an octopus’ distributed mind’s autonomous movement, all the while watching blatantly as Steve hops into the shower to rinse the salt water and bodily fluids off. He dries off with military proficiency, smiling softly at Tony when their eyes meet in the mirror. He’s in the middle of towelling his hair dry when a small frown breaks over his face. He pads over, naked and unabashed, and leans over to pick something up from the pile of clothes in the middle of the bathroom floor. A bright red blush steals over him, flushing him hairline to sternum, over the tips of his ears.
“I love you,” Steve says, and oh, that hurts. That hurts worse than Tony could have possibly imagined it would. “Tony-”
“You’re a grandstanding asshole and you like an audience. Bonus if that audience can actually track your crazy, see a method to the madness or call you out on your shit. Then the fun is trying to outwit them.”
With a gentle nudge from his human brain, Tony’s tentacles coil around Steve’s thighs and calves, spreading him apart with gentle, unyielding force. They’re strong, his tentacles: thick bands of muscle and nothing else, sinuous and clinging. Steve lets out a quiet sob into Tony’s mouth, jaw slack as he licks inside, and Tony sucks on his tongue as he manoeuvres to get both of Steve’s nipples attached to suckers, one curling around Steve’s cock in a tight grip to prevent him from coming.
“Remember that asshole is gonna heal and get right back up,” he warns, then winces when Rhodey stomps one foot straight into The Executioner’s skull, crushing it. Amora screeches.
“Guess so,” Steve says softly, and Tony smiles against his skin. “I’ve got time to convince you, haven’t I?”
Tony’s eyes are wild in his face. His hand is wrapped firm around Steve’s throat, trying to stem the bleeding, and he looks so frightened. Steve’s always hated to see Tony frightened, probably because it’s so rare. Tony is the futurist. He always knows what to do next, and so he’s never afraid. If he is, he knows better than to show it. He’s always been too proud for that.
"Maybe you should have thought of that before you went all supersaiyan on me. I can’t observe you from another borough."
Steve frowns. “This isn’t about sex. That’s why I’m asking. I told him that, so I hope he’s not thinking that’s-”
“Inferior materials,” Tony tells him, smug as a cat. “Not quite the calibre you’re used to, hm Captain?”
“Come on, Avenger,” he mutters, his head dipping towards his chest as a wave of nausea sweeps over him. “Come on.”
He’d gotten them from his mother. Long swathes of his childhood were filled with memories of his mother lying prone in a dark room, draped only in silk so as not to agitate her oversensitive nerves, black velvet curtains drawn over the floor-to-ceiling windows of her bedroom. Sound, light, motion, and even physical stimuli would disquiet her. She was prone to vomiting unless given strong medication, which she hated to take because of the way they’d made her feel.
“No. I’d tell you to forget about the press, go home, and take a nap,” Steve tells him crossly. “And then we’d argue about it, because you are terrible at taking care of yourself when you think there’s something that needs doing. But there’s always something that needs doing, and so you never take care of yourself.”
He thinks about going back to the Triskelion. He should do that. That would- It would be the right thing to do, is all. That’s what he should do, and he-
“I’ll sober up a bit with some food in me,” Tony offered, and Rogers smiled a small half-smile at the concession. “And then I can take all your money.”
“Your brother just saved all of our fucking asses,” Tony says, gaping at the screen. “I don’t- this is beyond even my wildest fucking best-case scenario. This changes
Loki licks the blood from his lower lip, glancing over at Thor. He takes a slow breath, and for a moment, Steve thinks maybe he’s been foolish. Maybe that’s why he grins when Loki lifts one huge paw and then places a human hand in Steve’s.
It’s near-silent, down here. The lights are relatively low, motion-activated. He wonders how Natasha will feel, all alone in the earth behind mirrored glass. He’s always hated being alone with mirrors, especially in the dark, at night. He’s sure Nat would have a lot to say about that, though: something about his own self-hatred, maybe.
“I promised I would not use this against you,” Loki says calmly, but his fingers tighten around Tony’s wrists. He presses his forehead to Tony’s breathing deep. “With me, come now.”
“I love you,” he whispered against Tony’s mouth. He repeated it against his jaw, his eyelids, his bonding gland. There, he pressed the softest kiss he could possibly imagine, no pressure, just a chaste brush of lips. He felt Tony shiver as he did it, his arms tightening around Steve’s shoulders. “I love you. I love you, I love you, I love you.”
“I basically tricked you into bonding with me,” Steve sobbed, and wow, he was a fucking mess. He curled up on the floor next to the glass, turning away and resting his head back against the cool pane because he couldn’t stand to look at Tony right now. He pressed his chin to his knees, scrubbed a hand through his hair. “I lied to you. I went through your things. I pried into your personal medical information without your consent. And then, knowing all of that, I took advantage of you. I was the one who wanted to bond. I wanted you so badly. I
you to belong to me. So if you want informed consent, here it is.” He leans close, mouth skating over Tony’s jaw, to drip utter filth into Tony’s ear like poison. “I want you to put your hands back on my ass. Spread me open. Work your big, wet cock inside of me, and fuck me like you damn well
“She is not powerful enough on her own,” JARVIS says, and Tony takes the info for what it probably is; a message from Loki. “She may have gotten help from Doom. She’ll burn out quickly, at this rate. All you have to do is outlast her.”
“What do you wanna do, tie her down? Torture her? Beat her until she talks?” Tony asks, and behind him he can hear Steve inhale, deep and bracing. Natasha raises a disapproving eyebrow at him, but otherwise says nothing. “She’s not gonna talk with you here. Those are her terms.”
“Ooh, we’re joking about that now,” Tony says, and when Cap laughs, he moves quickly, pulling the crumpled cartilage straight. Steve’s laugh is broken in half by a choked-off gasp, and Tony placates him with an apologetic kiss pressed to the end of his chin.
“Your mother, you said she came to you when she died,” Tony says, slowly. Loki freezes against his chest, and Tony lets out a small, disbelieving laugh. “You said she could see the future, that you saw things you didn’t like. You’re reading a quantum mechanics textbook. And you keep saying I don’t trust you ‘yet’, like you know it will happen, which is really out of character now that I think about it, for self-hating narcissists like us. And sometimes, you look at me, like you’re not seeing me, or maybe like you’re seeing a me that isn’t here-”
Bruce smiled softly at him. “I know it’s hard to understand, but it’s not an equal system, Steve. Consider the impact your pheromones have on a room as an alpha. Not just any alpha—an enhanced one, who has put higher-ranked officers on their knees just by growling at them. After the sexual revolution in the 60’s and 70’s, blockers were the only way omegas were able to have any kind of social mobility on their own merits. Imagine working with an omega in the field, having to send them out into battle. No matter what kind of alpha you are, you’re fighting your instincts. Imagine an alpha supervisor at a job having to criticise the work of their omega subordinate and forcing them into Obeisance without meaning to. After Title IX, that’s a potential lawsuit that provides a company incentive not to hire mixed dynamic teams. Omegas and alphas now work together because of cheap and easy access to blockers, and that right was fought for. Fiercely. Omegas’ right to work, to their bodies, to positions of power is questioned even now. The activists and theorists of the sexual revolution argued that dynamics are an evolutionary trait that’s stopped being quite so helpful, and instead gets in the way of things. Blockers are the only reason omegas have been allowed into med school, the army, any number of places. It was how the Equal Rights Amendment got passed in ’72. So not wearing them, being against the idea of them, Posturing or Obeisance in public…these things are seen as a very specific kind of political statement.”
“Thank you,” Steve says. He’s never used JARVIS to order food, but he knows Tony does. JARVIS handles all of the grocery shopping for the communal kitchen, and keeps track of all of the household stuff in the tower like toilet paper and detergent. Steve doesn’t really understand JARVIS yet, but he can certainly trust him with a food order.
Tony snorts, takes another, larger swig of his drink. “It’s really not.” He swallows. “You were right, though. I do kind of like the bastard. He’s smart, damaged, funny.” Something passes over his face, then, dark and uncomfortably vulnerable. It twists Steve up to see Tony looking like that over someone else, even as he continues to soothe Tony with placid, sweeping strokes of his hand. “He’s so fucking lonely. He’s so messed up. I don’t know-… I don’t fucking know what I’m doing. And I don’t…I don’t know if I can-” He stops, and when he inhales his chest stutters, shaking.
“The likelihood of getting the NIA to relinquish custody once they had already taken the Captain’s assailants in was nil. Our window of opportunity was before they took the assailants in to start with, and the odds are against you having affected that outcome positively, sir.”
Tony waves him off the way he always does when Steve tries to reconcile after a fight, hand fluttering as though he’s shooing a fly. “Brunch or no brunch, Spangles, because if not I’ve got work to do.” Something like regret curls around Tony’s lips, wrenching a smile out from between his teeth that looks like it pains him. Steve swallows, nodding slowly.
that he will touch Tony. Touching Tony is incidental to his desires. Nothing, not even death, is going to stop him.
Steve leans in, his nose ghosting over Tony’s wrist. He’s barely even touching him, just the faintest pressure of his fingertips. Like he wants this to be as sterile as possible. He takes a deep breath, shudders all the way from head to toe. A soft, punched out sound escapes his mouth.
“Let’s get this over with,” she says, clipping past him and into the dining hall. “I’m sure we’re both busy. I have everything laid out for you in the conference room.”
Amora’s mouth is open in a scream Tony can’t hear, hands clapped over her ears. Fire encircles her, spreads out from the edges of the bright shield. It catches electrical cords and the scientists’ papers, electricity sparking dangerously as the rubber melts and the cords fray. Smoke tinges green as it weaves through the cavernous space, and Tony hovers to avoid a tendril of fire snaking its way towards him. He hisses as one of the machines behind him begins to spark.
“I didn’t think the Intrepid was going to fit all these people,” Bruce admitted, glaring out at the crowd.
Tony’s entire face had gone slack, even the smile slipping from his face. He looked like a storm had whipped through and taken everything he knew from under him, and Steve didn’t much like that look. “Tony? Tell me if I’ve got this all wrong.”
“I need to put my brain to work or I’m going to go crazy. I can’t sit in the workshop alone like this. I’ll relapse. And I don’t know if I can look at Cap without wanting to punch his damned perfect teeth in. So just…let me do this.” He’s begging. He knows he is, and he thinks that maybe, he’s telling more of the truth than he’d been willing to admit to himself. Pepper was sneaky like that. She was good at poking at Tony’s weaknesses, exposing the soft underbelly of his armour and tearing him open.
Bruce laughs. “I thought you got really into traditional medicine when you were dealing with the palladium problem.”
anything in this film,” Tony complains. “Merlin has what, two scenes? Why not just make this a generic fantasy film?”
Natasha’s mouth kicked up, the fond little half-smile she reserved only for Tony. “Then thank you for humouring me,” she said.
And then, about half an hour later when Steve was helping SHIELD cart away a series of Hydra computer banks: “Tony says: watch the tech, Spangles. He’s planning to pick through it when he’s out of here.”
“Cut the chatter,” he said. “We’re going in at 02:45. That’s when there’s the biggest gap in the rounds. Widow, Hawkeye, and I will head in first and infiltrate. We’re moving quiet. We have two hostages inside and one is a non-combatant. We want to keep the element of surprise as long as possible. Thor, I want you taking out stragglers. Once we’re noticed, they’re gonna swarm out of the anthill. If you can box the them in with your lighting, create a bottleneck, it’ll keep everyone from escaping. Doc, you’ll be on standby until we locate Iron-Man.”
“Thor, there are civilian fishing vessels off the coast. An unexpected storm might harm locals that would have otherwise not taken to water this morning,” JARVIS says, and Thor growls a curse, bringing mjölnir down with a shattering explosion of lightning that arcs throughout the entire building.
“Yes,” Steve hisses, and Tony smiles. He presses a kiss to Steve’s chest, licks over his left nipple just to feel Steve squirm against his lips. “God, you can’t hurt me, come on.”
“Shh,” Tony whispers, leaning in for a kiss. “I thought you were gonna take care of me? Hmm, Captain? Gonna tie me up and have your way with me? Gonna make me scream in this
“Of course,” Steve said, nodding. He wanted to spend the next few days wrapped up in Tony in the safety of their room, outfitted with all of the accoutrements that Steve was used to having in one of his heats.
“It felt like you were in rut,” Steve mused, and Tony offered him a rueful smile. “No, please. I’m not complaining. At all.”
Steve bows his head over his folded hands. A fat teardrop lands on his knitted fingers, but that’s alright. For the first time since he was a child, he actually feels like he’s been washed clean through confession.
“What the fuck is wrong with me?” he’d asked JARVIS on the third day, when it seemed like it might go on for a week.
“That’s not a question, it’s an order,” Tony said, but he was taking the ring from the box and sliding it on his finger. “You’re always so bossy.”
Steve stills, then. His expression shifts through several motions, although Tony doesn’t quite know what to do with any of them. “Do you…not want me there?”
“I’ll come back and say goodnight later,” Steve said, and Tony nodded tiredly at him. “We’ll have lunch brought down for you, too, of course. I’ll send someone. But I should get the penthouse ready.”
The first thing he did was take a shower. He used Tony’s body wash, needing the scent to ground him. He rummaged in the laundry and pulled out one of Tony’s ubiquitous band T-shirts, pressing his face to the fabric to inhale the sweet scent of musk and metal, of dying leaves in water at the height of autumn, of electricity and that sharp tang of something else that Steve hadn’t been able to place but always made him think of the reactor.
“Okay, that’s enough sharing time,” Tony says, gesturing with his now empty cup. Bruce takes it away and walks over to the coffee maker for a refill. “Er, thanks.”
“That’s because he’s- he’s fucking perfect,” Tony spits. His tentacles writhe beneath him, flushing a dark, bloody red. “He tries so hard to be nice to me because he knows that I’m a fucked up mess inside, it’s not-” Tony’s voice breaks, horrifyingly, his eyes stinging. “It’s not
Steve blinks, closing his mouth and taking in a wet-sounding breath through his nose. “There’s blood, but yeah. Probably.” He sighs, scrubbing a hand over the back of his head. “God, I hope Bruce doesn’t have to re-break it. Remember that fight with Foolkiller?”
Later, Steve would find out that JARVIS had read two remaining life forms in the basement; a pair of kids who’d been necking and got trapped when the quake hit. Tony had tried to make it down into the basement, but the building had been too unstable. The whole entire four story school had toppled with Tony and the two kids inside. One of the kids, a fifteen year old boy, was crushed and killed in the rubble. The other student lost her arm, and Tony had come out with a concussion, several bruised ribs, and a metric tonne of survivor’s guilt to add to the expansive river of it he was already swimming against every day.
He rubs a hand over his mouth, then turns back to Loki. “Alright,” he says, “why don’t we get you two cleaned up?”
,” Steve gasped, and it was so good he couldn’t see even with his eyes open. They kept rolling into the back of his head, legs shaking from how bad he wanted it. “Please make me come. I want it. I want to be good for you. I want to be good for your knot, alpha, Tony, oh, oh oh
“I did tell you you,” Tony sighed, visibly tired of this argument now, “it was just the regular beatings, Steve. I’ve been through worse.”
“I’m sure,” Tony says shortly, and she nods. A grimace crosses her face, and she takes a breath, her huge black combat boots shuffling awkwardly on the glossy marble floor. Through the broken glass behind her, Tony can see people crawling out of rubble and shouting for each other across the wreckage of overturned halal carts. It’s been a long, long day in New York. Then add on: some severe internal bleeding after an outrider managed to impale Iron-Man using his own momentum while he was going 469 miles per hour; Tony crashing and nearly bleeding out; being uncovered by The Runaways with only Nico Minoru to save him from death; Minoru forgetting she’d already used “comfrey” as a healing spell and apparently, she
“Rude.” Tony clears his throat and slides his phone back into his pocket, then goes ahead and uses the bathroom because might as well. When he gets back out, Sam Wilson is vomiting into the kitchen trash can, and Tony raises an eyebrow at Natasha, whose twitching mouth conveys the vaguest air of amusement. She hooks a thumb at Loki, who shrugs.
Tony tilts his head back onto the lounger and throws an arm over his eyes. And then, with no one to see him but the early moon and a few lone seagulls, he cries himself sick. He cries like he hasn’t cried in years—since Jarvis died, and Tony had nothing but the rest of his lonely life staring at him like the barrel of a rifle: the longest, darkest tunnel, with only death at the end. He cries until he’s sick all over his lovely imported French tiles.
“Okay,” Tony said slowly, brows furrowing now. Steve kind of hated when they did that, mostly because it made him want to kiss the little wrinkle between them. “So…you’re not mad?”
“No, you can’t,” Bruce counters, shaking his head. “If he can catch the shield, he can catch your arrows. You’d need a perfect opening, and with his enhanced capabilities we don’t know how much voltage is needed to take him down without killing him. And you’ll have another job.”
There have been many times in his life that Steve Rogers has been deeply glad that Tony Stark does not have super-hearing. Listening to Beth mutter, “Cares, cared…” under her breath, Steve is not sure he’s ever been gladder. He cannot imagine what Tony’s would do with that in his current state, but it wouldn’t be anything good.
“I don’t know what to say,” he mumbled, turning his face up to face the closest security camera. He felt raw, scraped open, and he felt he owed it to JARVIS to let the AI see how much he was feeling. “You’ve been taking care of him for so long, way before I was in the picture. It’s an honour, to hear that from you.”
“Before you go,” Bruce said, opening his arms, and Steve blinked at him in incomprehension. Bruce sighed, then leaned forward to wrap his arms around Steve’s shoulders. He turned his head to speak softly in Steve’s ear. “You’ve done amazing, I just wanted you to know. You’ve been an incredible mate for Tony.”
Rhodey lets out a huff of controlled laughter that only Tony can hear, sitting next to him, and he bumps his knee against Rhodey’s under the table.
“I can’t leave you like this,” Minoru says. She gestures at Tony’s…everything. “Come on, you don’t want the paps to catch you like this. It’s busted right now anyway. What have you got to lose?”
Steve’s jumped off of a lot of tall things, and not even always with someone to catch him. Usually Tony is the one who rushes to meet him mid-air, muttering about Steve’s bull-headed recklessness. He’d thought he was used to it, that nothing could phase him. But it’s strange, falling without the wind whipping against him. He feels weightless, almost. Below him, the city is spread out in a dot matrix of glowing lights. Little cars shuttle back and forth like fireflies, quickly growing larger. The street is nearly upon him.
“Can you let me be gentle to my lover, who just mysteriously recovered his memories after a two day coma?” Steve asks pointedly, and Tony winces.
Tony has seen Natasha win against him, when Steve was pulling his punches. He isn’t sure if Steve is pulling them now, though. He’s angry, and confused. Sweat darkens his temples, his eyes narrowed as he neatly sidesteps Widow’s foot, swings a hand around to catch her ankle. She hooks it, surprising him when she places her entire body weight in his hand, hanging briefly upside down and catching Clint in the liver with a well-placed jab. He doubles over, vomit splattering out of his mouth as he falls to his knees, and Natasha turns her attention to Steve. She tries to choke him out with her thighs, but Steve knows this move. He flips his body forward, tumbling her off of his shoulders and onto her feet as his foot comes down towards her. She redirects it with her forearm, coming in to break his nose with a quick strike. The base of her palm hits Steve’s nose with a sickening crunch, and then she’s dancing out of range again while he staggers back, his right arm swinging wildly.
Loki is watching him, his mouth twisting into something wry and melancholy as he studies Tony’s face. He reaches out, takes Tony’s glass from his fingers. He takes a long sip. “I know you don’t trust me yet,” he says. There it is again, that use of the word yet. “I swore I harboured no ill will towards you and your compatriots. And I thought...”
He collapses back into Steve’s arms with a gasping breath, his lungs filling with blessed oxygen as he tries to get his bearings. “Fuck,” he gasps, and Steve lets out a low purr of agreement behind him, his arm slipping around Tony’s waist to pull him back until they’re slotted together from head to toe. Steve’s still half-hard inside of him, but Tony doesn’t mind that one bit.
“You’re such an asshole!” he shouts, but there’s no response. Fucking typical. “He’s probably not going to straight out kill him. Right?” Tony heads towards the elevator, but then pauses when there’s no response. “J?”
Steve had never scented an alpha and wanted to go to his knees, before Tony. They were so compatible it was like their pheromones had been built to complement each other in Bruce’s lab. He wanted to wrap himself up in Tony’s scent and roll around in it, but Tony was his friend. And Tony had Pepper. Even if he hadn’t, Tony had been voted Sexiest Alpha Alive two separate times. He could have the pick of any omega he wanted.
“Excuse me,” he says, pushing away from the table. He heads down the hall to the bathroom and shuts himself in.
“Harpy.” He settles back, eyes aching from the lack of proper sleep. He’s always better at staying awake when it’s a proper all-nighter, the adrenalin keeping him steady throughout the day, or even longer if necessary. His body, accustomed to sleeping when it can and getting as much as possible out of it, always responds especially poorly to a small snatch of sleep at a reasonable hour. He prefers to sleep like the dead or not at all, and to have that interrupted messes with his ability to function. Between that and the conversation he’d had with Steve yesterday, he’s in no condition to do anything.
“I, uh. I thought we could talk,” he says. Pepper eyes the bouquet, then him, tilting her head to the side in impassive consideration. “Um. These are for you.”
I know a lot about resources in my state, and my city, but I also know most of my readers are all over the place, and a lot of y’all are in Europe. I don’t know anything about trans resources for Europe, so I’m sorry about that. But NCTE is accessible anywhere?? Anyway, if any of you have questions, please feel free to ask. I’ll do my best. (;＾◇＾;)ゝ
Steve feels his face heat as he punches in the door code. JARVIS lowers the music blaring from the speakers, and Tony smiles at him. It’s weak, but it’s there, and Steve grins back in relief.
Steve sighs. He looks into his bowl, scraping the last bits of the potatoes up with his spoon. “I can’t help but feel kind of responsible for Howard being such a jerk. I know you’re gonna tell me it’s not my fault, but. I just think I should say so.”
“He left for Asgard, to help with a political matter. He won’t be back for weeks,” Steve elaborates, when the woman doesn’t seem inclined to believe them.
When he opens his eyes, the sun is bursting bright through the glass wall, and Steve squints uncomprehendingly out into the light of a cloudless blue sky. He’d never seen the sun so high from his room before.
“And you,” she says, pointing at Loki, “need to behave yourself if you’re serious about being on our side, now. The last thing we need is it getting out that we’re working with a wanted extraterrestrial terrorist. You need to do some major PR before you can be seen with any of the Avengers.”
“I know we’ve already been dating for years now,” he began, projecting loud enough that Tony’s mic picked up his voice. Gasps and delighted shouts echoed throughout the room, but Steve wasn’t finished. He reached out to brush a gentle thumb over the crinkled corner of Tony’s eye. “So maybe it’s selfish to want to take this one too, but.”
“As you say,” he says, finally, and Steve sucks in a breath of his own. He glances up to meet Loki’s eyes: green, again, bright and curious.
Afterwards, when his body has been scanned by a million and six magic spells, and the curse has been identified, and Stephen has broken the enchantment, Tony has the grace to feel a little guilty. He scrubs a hand through his hair, then bumps Stephen’s shoulder gently with his.
“Why d’you think I’m always up here?” he asked, voice rough. Tony licked his lips, and Steve stifled a small sound of want in his throat. Tony was close enough to hear it, evidenced by the way his eyes darkened, his breath catching in his throat. Steve placed Tony’s other hand on his waist.
“You know the timing was never right,” Tony sighs, which. Which, is not what Steve would have said at all. It’s not what he would have thought Tony would say. He would-
Steve blinks. “Oh,” he says, considering it. Then he shakes his head. “Tony would never go for that.”
And it’s stupid, because Steve has spent years and years fighting himself. He’d been desperate to keep the balance between them, to keep Tony not too close and yet not too far, near and dear while still professional.
There’s a long silence. Steve watches Tony move through the foggy frosted glass, blurry enough that his movements are a mystery. It still makes him feel flushed, like he’s watching something he shouldn’t. Then again, he knows that every waking moment since his death has been something he shouldn’t be watching. Tony would never have wanted Steve to see him come apart like this. He knows Tony well enough to know that this exact set of circumstances would be his worst nightmare: to be brought low where Steve could see his self-termed failure.
“Steve,” Tony rasped, turning frantic now, and Steve pulled off with a heavy gasp, eyes meeting Tony’s with determined intention. He took a few deep breaths, replenishing his oxygen, then ducked down and took Tony in again. “Steve? You- oh, my god, you can’t be serious.”
should know better, and the fact that no one believes I can be is…it’s worse, even, than if someone,
“Any luck?” Steve asked, and Bruce turned to blink at him from behind his glasses. His apologetic expression spoke volumes, and Steve sat down at the table with his hand over his mouth. “Let me have it, then.”
“Miss Williams seemed to share your sentiments. She told Sir that he should take better care of his omega, especially one so loyal as you.” Steve winced, knowing how much that had probably hurt Tony. “Yes, quite.”
“Yeah, that’s me baby. Is Amora out of your system? Can I untie you?” Tony winks at him. “I’ll understand if you’d like to stay tied up, but maybe another time, more private quarters-”
, and Tony had gone along, all the while complaining that he could have the film screened privately for Steve if he wanted. He went anyway, though, and Steve had smiled and let Tony buy the tickets and the popcorn and the little chocolates with white sprinkles on the top that made them look a little like the pasties the showgirls used to wear. He was glad, to be at a place where he and Tony could just spend time together again, easy as anything. Nobody made him feel right in his skin like Tony did. He’d missed that so much when they were fighting. He’d felt deeply, strangely unmoored, floating through the days like a ghost.
Now, Tony stares at Natasha through a wall of thick, ballistic one-way glass, and he wonders what the hell Pepper is going to say about the cells after this is over. Still bad things, probably.
“From the footage I’ve seen, I would estimate forty-six agents dead or in critical condition with low odds of survival. Thirty seven more have been seriously injured, but are in no serious danger of dying in the near future, with another twelve only having sustained minor injuries.”
“Fight smarter, not harder,” he mutters, petulant, and Pepper snickers. “We don’t have a lot to stand on here, Pep.”
Peter shifts on his chair, an uncomfortable expression overtaking his face. “Sorry. Just…I can’t help but feel like he’s not really dead, y’know? Like not forever. And I know you think so too.”
, huh?” Steve repeated, knowing exactly why the transmission had cut out. Someone had hurt his mate. “How many left? Are you secure?”
Afterwards, Steve lay on his back in bed on top of his coverlet. The duvet was cool against his skin. The cream ceiling was perfectly painted, entirely inoffensive. There were no cracks to speak of, nothing to count, just him, and his bed, and his sins. He didn’t know how long he lay there. Hours, maybe. Long enough for the sun to shift in the window, the light changing until it slanted over the bed, hitting his neck, his jaw. The warmth of the sun reminded him of the way Tony’s touch lit him up, made him feel like he was something beautiful, something worth cherishing. No one had ever made him feel like that. Not even Peggy. She had been strong, and beautiful, and made him want to be a hero so he could be worthy of her. Tony’s touch made him feel like he was already worthy: worthy of decadence, of worship, of only the deepest joy. It was the best thing Steve had ever felt in his life. Tony was the best thing he’d ever had in his life.
“I know I’m not handling being cooped up well, but what you’re going through is just how your biology works. I can’t hold that against you.” Tony smiled, just the barest quirk of his lips. “I’d be a hypocrite.”
When did Tony know? When did Tony look at Steve and know that he loved him? When did he look at Steve and see the desire that had apparently been there, bare for him to read all these years, and decide: no. Not this one. Not this man.
“Uh, I’m pretty sure I should buy you dinner after all that,” Steve counters, then flushes a little. “I mean, uh. Sorry. I’m a little out of sorts still, I think.”
“Helloooo handsome,” Tony drawls, grinning. “Well, well, well. I didn’t know you’d graduated to this level of technology 101. Have you been practicing sexting, too? Who taught you? Romanov?”
“Things were going well,” Tony says. He presses his forehead to the worktop, letting the cold seep into his skin. His chest aches. His throat feels like it’s on fire. “I thought…for a moment, I thought, earlier…”
The choked sound that breaks out of his mouth is inhuman. It does not echo in the space, instead landing flat and quiet against Steve’s folded fingers like a dead thing.
“Anything you want,” Steve says, and Tony smiles a little at the sense memory of being tied, of babbling the same thing for Steve. “Tony, I- God, if I hurt you-”
“Thank you.” He touches Loki’s cheek with his nose, breathing in the scent of leather and pine and earth. “You’re uniquely suited to understand my position, and we both know it.”
“I know, man. I know,” Rhodey says, clapping a hand on his shoulder. “Look, I’ve got your back. You know that. Whatever’s coming, we’ll figure it out.”
Tony pauses, bent over the coffee pot. His shoulders are tense, the dual whammy of his tenuous relationship with Luke and his reticence to talk to anyone about Steve mixing into whatever mortified expression Steve is sure he’s trying to hide by leaning over the counter. Steve reaches out a hand to comfort him, but the memory of Tony flinching away from him stops him. He fists his hands at his sides, glances over to where Luke is watching Tony with a narrow-eyed expression on his face. He hands Dani another piece of banana.
Steve takes a breath. He shrugs. Reaches out, as casual as he can, and takes a long draught from his coffee cup.
“Tony?” she says, stepping away from the table. Tony glances at the rest of the SI employees, who are studiously not looking at him even as they whisper amongst themselves. Beth doesn’t even spare them a glance as she draws closer. “Are you alright?”
“Pepper, no. Listen to me. There’s a whole squadron of these assholes, okay? He was just given an invite to an already existing homicidal psychopath club. If it was just him, we could have taken care of it.”
Xavier lets out a loud bark of laughter, perhaps the least refined Steve’s ever seen the man. His eyes are a bright, sparkling brown, and once again Steve is reminded strangely of Tony. “I’ll take that as a compliment,” the professor says, and Steve chuckles a little. “I cannot tell you, Captain. As long as we feel you need the appointments, one might say.”
I apologise in advance for the limited Loki in this chapter. He is off doing Very Important Plot Things, which you will find out about very soon. But hey, here's a treat for those of you who've been waiting for *checks* uh, like 100k words to find out what's the deal with Bucky in this fic!
“This alright?” Steve asks him, and Tony swallows. His fingers twitch on the controls, and he pulls them into his lap.
“I know nothing of the sort,” she says haughtily, and Tony smiles. “I’ll see you tonight. Should I order something?”
“Sometimes, I think, Tony really needs his own space,” Steve says, looking down at his hands. “He’s a…complicated man. He gets lonely, but I think he also gets overwhelmed by people. He needs time to decompress and work on his own. He’s not used to having people in his space all the time like this, the way me and Bruce have been. So I think maybe Tony just needs some time to himself for a bit. That might be the only way he can heal his inside hurts. Do you understand what I mean?”
, he thinks, and starts up the pace again. With every impact of his feet on the pavement, he feels it. I'm lucky. I’m lucky I'm alive.
“Accepted,” JARVIS said, and then the elevator began to move, and Steve wondered how the hell he was even going to face this conversation.
Tony breaks from the cloud cover, dropping down to skim along the bottom of the cloud. He can see the early morning fishing vessels heading out, dark ships on black water, even the very edges of the horizon not even hinting at the sunrise due in an hour. The city of Lagos looms before them, bright spires and glittering reflections rippling along the vast expanse of black.
Steve stills. He puts a bookmark in the book he was reading and sets it down carefully on the table. “James is here? Not with Tony?”
, Steve tries to send through the burgeoning bond that’s forming in his chest. He feels like he’s going to burn up from the inside out.
“Steve!” Tony roared, and Steve felt his whole body snap to attention. He could count the number of times Tony had used his alpha status for dominance in his presence on one hand, and it had absolutely never been directed at him. “Turn around and look at me.”
“Why isn’t this working?” Steve grumbles. He crosses his hands over his chest, watching as Tony flosses his teeth. Frustration wells up inside him, something he’s been trying desperately to keep at bay these past few months. He reaches out to touch Tony’s back, to cup the wing of one shoulder blade, and instead passes his hand right through where Tony’s heart should be.
“Stark,” Rogers said, and Tony blinked to find Rogers’ fathomless blue eyes on him. They were crinkled a little at the corners, and Tony near swallowed his tongue. “Take that coat off before you catch cold.”
Steve fixes him with a knowing look. “That’s some endorsement,” he observes, before shaking his head. “That’s not the only way to hurt someone, anyway.” He offers Tony a wry smile. “You’d know. You’re good at that.”
Pepper’s mouth flattens in a failed attempt not to smile, her brows practically jumping into her hairline. “Of course. Will that be all, Mr. Stark?”
Steve walks to the recessed living room and sits, folding his arms over his chest as he watches Tony at the bar. He’s pouring something from a huge, beautiful glass decanter, his fingers graceful as he drops a perfectly round ball of ice into the glass. He’s in a band t-shirt and tatty jeans, his usual dressed-down clothes for when he’s not up to public consumption. He looks exhausted, but also strangely keyed up.
Steve considers. He frowns, thinking of what Pepper said about how he views Tony, how wrong he is about him. “You said Tony had high standards, too.”
“Of course not,” Tony mutters, standing spread eagle so the suit can attach itself as it speeds down the hall towards him. He walks towards the windows as the last pieces continue to arrive, holding still for the faceplate.
Steve shuffles around awkwardly on his knees, then turns and winds his arms around Tony’s neck. He nudges their noses together, playful and utterly irresistible. “Put your hands on my stomach,” he tells him.
Bruce nodded, turning to Steve expectantly, and Steve took a deep breath, then fit the mask to his face. It was going to ruin his peripheral vision, which might interfere with the usual way he used the shield, but he was the one who needed the mask most. He peeled the film off, then put it on.
Steve opens his mouth, then closes it again. That was not where he thought this conversation was going. “Yes,” he says, but it sounds more like a question than an answer in his own mouth. “Tony had the suit on. I knew he’d probably be fine. It was selfish, and illogical, to try to save Tony when he didn’t need to be saved.”
“Tell me about the bond, again,” Thor said, and Steve closed his eyes and breathed out smoke, watched it curl up into the sky and vanish. The nicotine settled over him like a heavy blanket, potent for his going so long without touching the stuff.
Xavier studies him for a moment before nodding. “Alright.” His wheelchair moves so that he is positioned directly in front of Steve’s chair. He puts his hands out, hovering them on either side of Steve’s skull. “May I?”
“Thank you, alpha, thank you,” Steve gasped, taking his cues. He would be good for Tony. He would. “Alpha, you’re so good to me, please-”
He knows exactly what Tony is doing, pushing them both back into the thick of things quick, before a problem can develop. He’s trying to prevent the exact reaction Steve is having right now from becoming an issue in the future. He’s playing him, swift and deft as always, and Steve wavers for a moment on the threshold before stepping into the elevator, hands clasped tightly behind his back in parade rest. Tony smiles, all teeth, and presses the button for the garage.
“We’ll get the paperwork cleared away,” Pepper says, nodding at Jaime. “Please don’t blow anything up.”
That had been in early October, before the Halloween party where Tony dressed up as Sexy Captain America; they barely lasted an hour before Steve had to do something about the only-partially-sexual urge to drag him up to the penthouse and take the costume apart with his teeth. Steve wasn’t so good about managing his attraction to Tony, but in his defence, Tony was a terrible enabler. The point being, he’d been far too distracted by Tony’s…everything, and now it was almost time. The holiday party was next week, and Steve was just now cottoning on to the fact that his mind had played a terrible trick on him. Where before he’d been fine with the idea, used to Tony flirting with people at parties and taking beautiful friends and business associates on ambiguously intimate outings to help maintain a façade of professional camaraderie and healthy male friendship between them, now he wasn’t so sure. They’d gone to enough parties, restaurants, and shows together that the papers had dubbed them “NYC’s FAV BROTP” and “SuperBros.” Steve had seen little hug-and-fly salt and pepper shakers that magnetise in the windows of the tourist traps that line Times Square, alongside little flying-on-a-string Thor machines, and wall-climbing Spiderman toys.
“You couldn’t keep me out of here if you got every code-wrangling gopher SHIELD employs from here to Hokkaido on the job,” Tony tells her. His confidence would be obnoxious if he sounded less exhausted when he said it. As it is, he mostly just comes off as resigned and sad.
“I do not know what it is that Loki has done that has you so pleased,” Thor says, and Tony jumps about half a foot in the air at the sound of him. He’d entirely forgotten Thor was even there. “However, I will say that I have known since we were but children to never underestimate my brother’s machinations. It seems you still have yet to learn this lesson.”
An arc of lightning snakes out from Amora’s twitching left hand, lancing into Hawkeye’s side and sending him to one knee. Tony repulsors her in the face twice, then a third time, pushing her body back a good ten feet. She’s still convulsing, probably more automatic reflex than a real attack, but when he turns back Widow is running into the room, one hand on her comm as she barks a status update to the rest of the team. An Iron Legionnaire follows behind her. She’s leaning over Hawkeye in an instant, and Tony trusts her to take care of things there as he limps towards Strucker’s tech. Cap is hooked up to a dozen different machines, and he braces his hands on the edge of the cot and does another scan.
Steve blushes, but he’s grinning, too. “You like it when I take initiative in this area,” he says, like he’s providing a piece of intel for a mission.
There were a few scattered laughs at that, which was enough for Steve to count as a win. Slowly, the group began to break up, Bruce going back to trawling through data logs, Clint turning back to the holoscreen as well to track some of the contacts he and Nat had reached out to in the hopes of gaining more information about the team that had taken Tony. Natasha, predictably, rose from her seat and slid in next to Steve at the head of the table, folding her hands together over the worktop screen. Her green eyes were unflinching, assessing him for a long moment in which Steve tried to decide if he should look away or not.
Eventually, Tony reaches the black town car he’d come in. He swings the door open and gets inside, and Steve slips through the metal and glass just in time to catch Tony burying his face in his hands. His shoulders begin to shake, and then his whole body. He looks like he might shake apart.
“Because someone has to look out for you,” Stephen says, “and we both know that, when it comes to Steve, you won’t do it yourself.”
“You fly all the time,” Tony says, an old argument, and Steve looks up at him as though seeing him for the first time.
“I said we won’t know more until he wakes up,” Bruce corrects and Tony turns back to him with a quiet kind of wonder building in his chest. He touches Bruce’s temple with two fingers, where the hair has started to turn grey.
This a story that is very near and dear to my heart as someone who, let’s just say, grew up in a situation that’s superficially similar to what is described here re: Howard being a shitty parent and wanting an alpha child. Tony is a trans alpha, and his abusive dad wanted an alpha kid. Thus, Tony has nasty heapings of internalised transphobia and sexism to unpack. I like to think that Steve is going to help him with that moving forward in their relationship, since everything's on the table at this point.
,” Steve breathes, and he’s near panting, now. Tony can see his chest rise and fall with deep, heavy breaths.
“No,” Steve says. He reaches up to cup Tony’s face. He isn’t sure what his expression is doing, but whatever it is, Tony melts into him. His eyes are wide and gleaming. “I love you, Tony Stark. I think I’ve loved you since I first saw you. The first face I saw in the future: bright blue eyes behind a golden helmet, like something out of a storybook.”
“As you wish, sir,” JARVIS says, and it’s equal parts snide and worried. Tony scrubs a hand through his hair, frustrated. “Miss Van Dyne has left you another message, as has Agent Romanov.”
He’d tried Google, at first, but he’d quickly determined that Google was probably not the place for him to go looking for answers. Questions like: “How do I make my mate happy?” turned up answers that made his blood curdle for how backwards and outdated they were, even by his own standards. Either that, or the articles were all about sex, and, well. The less said about that, the better. He wanted Tony to like him. Sex was a far, far way off from where they were right now. Tony could barely stand to be in the same room with him, let alone…any of that.
Steve recognises this moment. A 7.8 magnitude earthquake had hit six major provinces in the country a few weeks ago. Hundreds were injured or dead, and over a thousand people had been unaccounted for. The Avengers had flown down to help with the clean-up and try to find survivors among the rubble. It had been a long series of days; entire buildings had been pitched sideways and become terrifying death traps. Bruce, JARVIS, and Tony had spent hours mapping the city out, finding better ways for the search and rescue teams to get to the worst buildings most likely to hold survivors. Tony hadn’t slept for much of the time; there were buildings that were easiest for Iron Man to get to, with the combined power of flight, his engineering brain, and the suit’s laser technology. At night he was running numbers, setting up drones to run through unstable buildings, and running minor repairs on his tech.
Tony isn’t looking at him. He’s standing over Steve’s body silently, his arms folded across his chest. He looks tired, but that’s nothing new. Steve would almost call his expression impassive, if he didn’t know Tony as well as he did. Instead, he watches the minute tremble of Tony’s jaw, the way his hands are shaking. Tony wants a drink, and he wants it badly.
He knows the professor might hear him, but he doesn’t particularly care. It’s nothing he hasn’t heard before, Steve’s sure.
“Mm, nope.” Tony said. “Actually…” And then he was pushing Steve flat to the bedspread, spreading his thighs in a near split, spreading his cheeks with his thumbs.
Before the serum, Steve wasn’t able to see red. It’s not something a lot of people know, or maybe they do and they aren’t aware of how much seeing the world differently changes you. He’d been an art student who was known for his black and white work, and he knew that most people thought it was a sign of the times. It had been ration time. Paint was expensive, and when it came to the war posters he’d been commissioned for, black and white was easier for mass production. But the truth was, Steve had been colourblind before the serum. Nothing could erase from his mind that moment of stepping out of the capsule and seeing Peggy’s face in full colour, bright lipstick painted over her lips a revelation, and then; blood. He’d never seen blood in colour before. He hadn’t known that the army wore a terrible shade of green.
“I’m off the meds, and so now we can drink,” Clint explains. “No excuses. You’re on fuckin’ house arrest. You literally have nowhere else to be and nothing else to do.”
If Steve hadn’t done what he’d done that day, he would have probably been blindsided by the vulnerability in Tony’s voice when he asked the question. As it was, it just made his heart hurt even more than it already was.
Steve glances at Tony, remembering their conversation about Loki’s potential premonitions. Tony no longer looks ready to take Loki apart, although his expression is still flat, only blandly curious. His eyes gleam, full of quiet fury.
Steve stares at him, surprise filtering over his face, then shock, then despair. “Oh, god,” he says. “And then I said I was glad you’d listened to my orders for once.”
“You would have done worse, just for the insult,” Pepper sniffs, which, yeah. Okay. That’s totally true.
“Okay,” he tells himself. He cracks a small smile, tremulous and bitter enough to make Steve hate it. “Up and at ‘em, Avenger. That’s what you’d say, right?”
“I spoke to Hill,” he says, and Tony stops talking. He can see his shoulders shifting as he works, cleaning between his knuckles, under his nails. “She’s gonna reach out to Xavier.” And then, “I’m sorry. I…-”
Steve blinks, then tilts his head up, looking for the security camera. He knows JARVIS isn’t human, but it still only seems polite to look him in the eye while they’re talking. “Uh. Is everything alright?”
Tony didn’t answer, instead letting Steve lay him out on the bed, covering him with his body as though he could protect Tony from all the shit in the world that wore him down. Steve wanted this so much. He wanted so badly for Tony to feel loved, to feel worthy. He didn’t know what else he could do.
“There,” Rogers said warmly, his breath ruffling the hair at the nape of Tony’s neck. “I reckon you can handle the rest?”
“Hello.” Tony glances to the side, where Widow is picking up the small black box. He swallows down the last dregs, shaking his head a little at the rush of it. “Take care of him, please.”
Pepper turns out the light and shuts the door, just to be contrary. Tony mutters unsavoury things under his breath.
“We’ll see.” She’s wearing that smug smile that says she’s never wrong. Tony loves and hates that smile in equal measure. He restrains the urge to point out that she just admitted to a mistake, mostly in the interest of keeping all his limbs. “You hardly ever give yourself enough credit when it matters, and too much when you shouldn’t. You’re a genius, Tony. You should be able to figure this out.”
There had been a moment, where Tony thought maybe Rogers was going to hit him. But then the moment had passed, and Rogers had swept his thumb slowly over the inside of Tony’s wrist, and well. Tony was capable of many things, but impulse control was often not one of them.
Steve moans softly into the kiss, his free hand sliding down over Tony’s stomach to take hold of his cock. He breaks the kiss with a soft bite, mouthing along Tony’s jaw until he’s settled back behind him, mouth slipping sweetly over the shell of his ear.
“Well,” he says, philosophically enough, “it was bound to happen sometime. What the hell set him off?”
If there was anything he had learned from those soldiers, it was that love was the ticket. The main difference between the ones who got better and the ones who ate a bullet, Sam had told him, was that the ones who got better wanted to get better, and when they looked, there were resources there for them; people who cared, a husband, a mother. True, the system was broken, and some of it was luck. There weren't enough beds for every homeless veteran on the street. It was why his share of the Avengers merchandising went to a different veterans' charity each year. But you had to want it, too, Sam had told him. You had to put in the work. Sometimes, without something to work for, it was hard to want it. Many of the Avengers knew that better than most.
“Dirty pool,” Tony growled, but Steve could hear laughter underneath it. “You are such a fucking. Little. Shit.” Each word was accompanied with a thrust that made Steve gasp, unable to speak, his fingers curling around the headboard as his other hand scrabbled at whatever piece of Tony he could reach. “You wanna act like the golden boy, the pretty little Christian omega, all-American sweetheart, but really you’re just a little knotsucker-“
He thinks, then, of Tony’s fantastical workshop, a place where the future blooms bright: blueprints and formulas gleaming a pale, iridescent blue. He’s spent the past few days doing his best to forget why he’d left the tower, but now, driving back after almost a week apart, he feels inexplicably nervous. He hasn’t gone this long without seeing Tony since they discovered they were soulmates. He feels a little like he’s crawling out of his skin. Separation anxiety, Romanov called it, although she was making fun of him then. He looks down at his hands, clenches and unclenches his fists. He wonders if Tony would scent him again, if he asks nicely.
“You need a shower,” she tells him, and Tony barely has the wherewithal to blink blearily at her before she’s stripping him.
Tony scrubs a hand over his face, then heads out into the central courtyard where they left the suits on sentry mode. Outside, a few cadets are posing for photos with the War Machine rig, but they startle when Rhodey claps his hands together.
Steve blinks at him, incredibly stymied by this question. “Uh. Sure?” He grins wryly. “You know who I live with, right?”
They don’t run into anyone in the elevators, thankfully. Tony performs his nightly ablutions without much fanfare, and Steve watches him while sitting on the bathroom counter, his knee and shin flush with Tony’s side as he brushes his teeth, washes his face, puts all sorts of products on his olive skin that make it gleam in the warm pendant lights that hang decadently overhead. He follows Tony into bed when he climbs in clad only in clinging black briefs, doesn’t even bother to try to keep his hands to himself. Instead he cuddles up and around him, pulling Tony’s face into his neck and rubbing his hands over the firm, rolling planes of Tony’s strong back. He imagines having a body again, Tony underneath him, watching the muscles flex as Tony writhes in the sheets. It’s enough to make him inhale, shuddering and slow.
Hello lovelies! Usual warnings: explicit sexual content, drinking, alcohol, ptsd, panic attacks, mentions of some unhealthy alcoholic behaviour but not outright alcoholism?? As always, stay safe/lmk if there's anything else I should add.
“You have no idea.” He is, maybe, feeling a little too emotional to hide the truth of himself from this preternaturally intelligent, extraordinarily powerful boy.
“Why, what do I smell like? Is it bad?” he asked, shrinking in on himself, and Steve jumped up before he thought better of it. He crowded close into Tony’s space, putting a hand on his shoulder and swiping his own sweaty hair out of his eyes. He needed to get a haircut, soon.
Steve is from the 1930-40's where women being slapped is 100% chill, forget about men. He still feels bad, which is pretty progressive of him, honestly. God, have you seen the era films? Sam is a military man who works as a counsellor at the VA, who has seen friends die in front of him. On the other side, Pepper is a modern feminist woman with a relatively normal pre-Tony life, and Bruce is a survivor (canonically he was brutally abused by his father as a child.) What is acceptable in the respective worlds that these characters live in is often very different. Tony’s father was a neglectful, emotionally abusive alcoholic, and Tony's also an ex-weapons manufacturer who has PTSD from torture and battle trauma. A punch from Steve isn’t trauma for Tony, by my characterisation. It’s shitty and grounds for a lack of trust, but Tony’s concept of DV is probably a little more involved. And remember, Cap and Tony are favoured sparring partners. They hit each other consensually all the time.
“Mine are triggered by stress,” she’d told him, long fingers rubbing gently at the base of his skull. “But you’re a Stark, and you cannot avoid stress, so instead we will mitigate. It will help that you’ve been doing Wing Chun for several years now. Meditation and strong physical discipline should help you learn to control your cortisol output. The former sometimes helps me.”
More accurately, Steve wasn’t even out. Tony had been outed in the papers when he was a teenager in college, and he’d never tried to hide himself since. He was unabashed. He’d even been called lurid. He was unapologetically himself, all of the time.
“Steve, I’m close,” Tony gasped, and Steve rumbled his displeasure. He wasn’t done with Tony yet. “Fuck, baby, I can’t, I
"And he should know better." Tony sneers. "If Loki is contacting you because he's interested, and you can have some guarantee of safety..." Pepper tilts her head to the side, considering. "He's less likely to attack the Avengers if he's attached to you."
So. This is obviously not the end. Everyone will kiss and make up, including Tony and Bruce. Especially Tony and Bruce! But I think also this is a good segue into a) how completely fucked up Tony is during IM3, and b) Steve being really bitter while Nat tries to set him up with anyone who has a pulse. I’ve never written IM3 fic before, tbh because I’m a PoC and I found that film offensive for various reasons. (Alas, Iron-Man can often be a problematic fave…especially the old Mandarin comics lol.) But canonically that’s what happens next, so we’re probably looking at this series’ climax culminating with the events of that film. Yay, PTSD Christmas for everyone!
“The most incredible thing is that I actually love you for your personality even when you look like this,” Tony murmurs, his eyes travelling unabashed over Steve’s body as he shimmies out of his pants, leans over to show Tony the toned curve of his ass as he works them off his ankles. Steve grins sweetly at him over one slab-cut shoulder.
“Bruce says he’s in love with me. JARVIS says he’s no good for me. Pepper was ready to call SVU on him, and Cap says I’m hard to love.” His voice is affectedly casual, and Clint folds his arms and regards him with a squinted eye. He looks uncomfortable, and Tony grins wickedly. “Ask, and ye shall receive.”
Tony shakes his head. “No such thing,” he tells him. He means it, too. There is nothing he wouldn’t give Steve. He would bisect his own body and pull his living heart out of his chest if Steve asked him to. There is no future where Steve asks him for something he isn’t willing to give.
“Nobody gives me any credit,” he grumbles. “Everybody keeps telling me you should know better, when I’m the one with experience. It’s no good for my ego.”
Steve lets out a bark of laughter, trying to squirm away, but Tony’s committed now. He half-climbs into Steve’s lap, pressing his advantage as Steve laughs, shoving at his face.
Steve laughs, shakes his head, looks up at the sun. He thinks of Icarus, and wonders who’s the sun and who’s the fool.
Steve opens his mouth, then seems to think better of it. His body relaxes, the tension streaming out of him. He looks a little smaller, this way.
Natasha fights like she’s dying. The Black Widow’s eyes are wild in her face, confusion and fear flickering over her in turns. She’d tried to get to Tony first, but Steve had stepped neatly between them, and told Tony to put on the suit. A small joke, one which might have brought levity to any other situation. Not this one. There is nothing funny about this.
When the doors open to the workshop level, Steve pauses outside of the glass. Tony is bent over one of the suit’s helmets, the faceplate separated from the main piece while Tony pokes at the internal screen with a frustrated sneer. The bright red and gold reflect the workshop lights back against his olive skin, highlighting the sweat and grease on his forehead, his cheekbones. He looks a wreck, but Steve’s chest tightens anyway.
When nothing seems forthcoming, Tony turns to Bruce’s quietly amused expression, then Natasha’s complete deadpan, before finally circling back to Steve’s skittish smile. “Hooray?” he tries.
Bruce raises his eyebrow meaningfully towards the entrance to the lab, and Tony turns just in time to catch the sight of a very familiar bright red boot disappearing up the stairs.
Later, much later—after the party made it to full swing, and Natasha graciously offered herself for another raffle date; after Thor challenged a group of techbros to a drinking contest and one of them had to be hospitalised; after Tony and Steve received so many heartfelt congratulations that Steve couldn’t imagine anything any news anchor had to say to him ruining this bright, fierce joy within; after Steve had taken Tony home and let Tony wreck him so thoroughly that he forgot his name—Steve found himself alone in his studio once more.
Tony hitches a breath, then laughs at himself. He pours two fingers of Teeling, slides in a sphere of ice. “Trouble,” he complains, a now-familiar refrain.
All the breath leaves Tony’s body in a heavy rush. “Fuck.” His eyes snap open, panic building in his chest. “Fuck, I have to talk to him.”
“Jesus H Christ,” Tony whispered, taking hold and dragging Rogers out. He was in rough shape, pale and wan, but he was able to sit up with Tony’s help. Tony thanked the forge for his strength as he hefted the man up over his shoulders, wrangling his listing body up and over the saddle before mounting behind him, one arm firm around Rogers’ trim waist.
“I don’t know,” Steve says, honest. No one’s ever accused him of anything less than that. “I should hope so, right?”
He bites his lip as he glances at the glass doors in front of him, steeling himself. Hopefully, after this, he and Pepper will be fine too. He’s going to make amends. He’s in therapy, and he and Tony talked, and they are going to figure this out together. He has to believe that. He does believe it.
Steve purses his lips in thought, then leans down and bold as brass gets his arm up and around Tony where his ass used to be, shifting his weight. He’s got Tony’s torso in his right arm with Tony’s left hooked around his neck, and the tentacles he loops loosely over or around his left arm in the strangest bridal carry Tony’s ever been in. Steve’s done this to him while he was in the armour, and as usual, he doesn’t even make a sound from exertion. He may as well have picked up a pillow, and Tony flushes a little under Steve’s grinning observation. He loves it when Steve manhandles him, and Steve knows it. He’s an irrepressible flirt, a delightful detail that Tony couldn’t have guessed at until they started dating, and he’s so damned sweet and insatiable-
“Better someone who heals you instead of hurts you,” Steve explains, voice patient and calm in equal measure. Tony can’t quite believe this is happening. “Goodnight, Tony.”
“I wanted to get him out of Nigeria. Or get to him in Nigeria. I had some contacts, but they didn’t pan out before Amora got to him.” She huffs a small laugh. “There’s a reason I was mostly a European operative. I can’t exactly infiltrate a NIA holding facility without being noticed.
Steve has seen a lot of things in his long life. Bad things, of course. Death camps. Mass graves. Personal losses, too, which were often more impactful. He knows, better than Tony probably thinks he does, how difficult it can be to just accept a win in their line of work. It can be hard to remember the good things, too: home, and shared meals, and family. Long, sweaty games of basketball. The lightness of being when he clicks together with Tony on the field, and everything moves like a well-oiled machine, and everybody lives.
Tony stares at him, his lips pressed tightly together to disguise the smile Steve knows is hiding there. He puts his hands on his waist and tilts his head back to look at the basketball tucked neatly between the highest branches.
“Sometimes love isn’t enough,” Jim persists, but he’s out of luck with that tack. Steve couldn’t agree more.
“This is all real rational of you,” Clint says, making his way through his fourth serving of whiskey, “but come on, you’re full of shit. We both know you’re fucked up about it. Come on. Bottoms up. Let’s go.”
“Should I offer to let you fuck me on the hood of my car?” Tony jokes, but the way Steve’s eyes darken is in no way jocular. “Oh. You…totally would love that, wow. Holy shit. Which car? No, don’t answer that right now, I have to go back into the garage and the mental images, wow, no. You’re a filthy fuck, this is
“An excellent idea, sir. If I may, Agent Barton is in the communal kitchen and you haven’t eaten in hours.”
Tony’s expression is dubious, but whatever he might have said in response to that is forestalled by Strange arriving back in the room with a tattered black book, marked with symbols Steve does not recognise.
“Do not let him hear you say so,” Thor warns, but his grin is wide enough to set his usually-stormy eyes sparkling. They darken as Tony watches, filling with self-doubt. Tony knows that particular look intimately. “Sometimes I feel as though I am missing something essential, something that my brother and mother and father were all gifted at birth whilst I was overlooked.”
“Shh,” Steve murmured, mouthing sweetly over the line of hair that trailed down to Tony’s waistband. He trailed over the sensitive ridge of Tony’s hips, smiling when he bucked up into him, and tucked his fingers into Tony’s waistband. “Can I?”
Beth stares at him for a moment, then shrugs. She turns, heading back towards the table saw. “You’re very transparent and a terrible liar.”
“It’s alright,” he says easily. He feels light as a feather now. Franklin dutifully repeats his words. “Good night Franklin. Thank you again.”
Steve’s expression sharpens. His nostrils flare. “What are you saying?” he asks, and his voice is rough. He’s angry. Tony is so, so glad they’re doing this over video. The scent of Steve’s fight pheromone would break him, now. It would send him to tears. It would be so easy to bend to his will.
Perhaps it is a larger number. He’s gone back over it again, and every time he counts, the number gets bigger. Tony’s hands are shaking, hands up, and only then does Steve recognise the position. It’s Iron-Man’s warning position: hands up, or I’ll shoot.
“-and we sat together and watched that really depressing animated film, about the robot detective and the AI-”
“What’d you find, Shellhead?” Steve asks him. He traces a hand over Tony’s nape, climbing out of his lap so that Tony can work. Regretfully, Tony leans down and pulls on his briefs and pants in one go. Steve watches him with open avarice. There’s no one to see him do it, and he can’t quite help himself. He feels
The first thing Steve had done when he found out Tony was amenable to what he previously had thought was an unrequited love was show him precisely how good he was at sucking cock. He doesn’t disappoint now. It takes Steve a moment to adjust to the size and shape of it, but then his tongue slips inside, rubbing along the ridges that line the underside of the ligula, and Tony moans like he’s being paid to. His spine bows with it, and Steve groans around the tentacle in his mouth. Sparks fly behind Tony’s closed eyes: a feedback loop of pleasure.
“This pretty little lady right here is named Amora, but she goes by Enchantress. She’s an Asgardian, and apparently the goddess of love.” The Connecticut senator in the corner snickers, and Tony fixes him with a look. “You wanna laugh? Two minutes of exposure to her had Captain America acting like an adolescent ball of hormones. He attacked me, one of his supposed best friends, in an elevator during a common disagreement.” Tony flicks the footage of Cap punching him up onto the big screen for effect, but turns off the sound. A little lie to convey the seriousness of the situation never hurt anybody.
“I think whoever it was got hired to do exactly this but on a bigger scale. And so far, they’ve gotten away with it.” He frowns. “I need to call Maria. And Reed. And probably some other people.”
“Oh,” Steve said, flushing. He fumbled it out of his pocket, opening the box and offering it to Tony with a bashful expression. “I…I went to your jeweller. I mean, JARVIS sent me- Uh. Joe said you’d love it-”
“I don’t think I’ve come that quickly since I was fourteen, so I mean, good job,” he continues, because Loki has done nothing good for his tendency to mouth off in the face of danger of bodily harm. “A plus, that was hot as Pompeii on a bad day, I mean, Jesus-”
“How did you not notice that?” Steve counters, incensed. “Tony! Did you really think I’d leave him in Nigeria if I knew?”
Unbidden, he remembers his meeting with Xavier: the vision of the earthquake, of Tony’s battered body crawling up out of the earth like a Grecian myth.
Tony huffs. All the fight goes out of him. “What do you want me to do about it now?” he asks. His voice is shaking. He looks completely wrung dry, and Steve reaches a hand out, and presses two shaking fingers to the jutting ankle bone beneath the hem of Tony’s pants. And there, beneath his fingertips: warm, papery thin skin.
“So?” Natasha shrugs, eyes as piercing as ever. She pins Tony in place with her stare. “Prove them wrong. Isn’t that your whole shtick?”
Tony gestures for him to put the leg down, so Steve heads back over to his perch on the couch. He picks up the newspaper again, and the room lapses into a comfortable kind of quiet. Tony’s music shifts up in volume a few clicks, and Steve glances up at him from across the workshop. He watches as Tony falls headfirst back into his working fugue.
“I am touching you,” Tony says, and Steve lets out a frustrated growl. The chains clink for a moment before he remembers himself, subsiding and lying back against the sheets.
“You want to rummage around, check for any mines Amora might have left behind,” Steve says tightly, nodding. “Have at it.”
“I’m sure,” Beth drawls, but her eyes are bright with amusement. “I guess I owe Natasha fifty bucks.”
“It will be hard,” Clint said, glancing at Natasha, “for both omega and alpha biology to try to fight a bond like that. Especially if you’re using your pheromones, Cap. On top of that, you’re family. You’re pack.”
Tony stares at him, hands braced against the bar. His elbows are locked tight, body hunched over the table top like he’s bracing to leap over it and fight Steve with his bare hands.
“You better be big spoon,” Clint said, and Steve snorted despite himself. He slipped under the covers and turned to lay on his side, facing Clint. He draped a tentative arm over Clint’s middle, and was rewarded with Clint shuffling back a little until they were sharing heat, not quite pressed up against each other, but enough for Steve to find a bit of comfort in their proximity. “Stop overthinking everything and go the fuck to sleep.”
“Why don’t we reconvene after the U.N. council meeting?” Cochran says, folding his hands together. “It seems we are at an impasse, and I know I have places to be.”
“Yeah,” Steve called warily, not really sure if anyone could hear him. He presumed this was the young and bright Miss Williams.
Steve shuts off the water, then stands there for a moment in the empty shower, dripping. He feels wrung dry.
Tony doesn’t know what to say to that, so he steps out of the quinjet and heads into the tower, ignoring Rhodey’s shout. It’s pouring rain, lightning crackling threateningly over the city in bright flashes. Thunder booms overhead, and Tony doesn’t even see the blow coming before he’s flat on his back, Thor standing over him wreathed in blind fury. A gust of wind slaps fat raindrops against the glass walls, howling all around them.
“Is it my fault?” four-year-old Tony had asked, very sensibly he thought. Howard seemed to think most things were his fault, after all.
In the upstairs apartment, Rogers was bare of all but his britches, huddled close to the stove. The jailhouse med-kit was open over his knee, and Tony paused just inside the door, dripping ice and snow all over the floor. He wasn’t sure what he was meant to do, now, if Rogers was well enough to patch himself up. He looked strangely aglow in the lamplight, miles of pale Irish skin slick with snowmelt.
When he came back to himself, his forehead was pressed against the cool glass, breath fogging the surface. Tony was kneeling before him on the other side, peering up into his face with a hunted expression. He’d always thought it was amazing, how easy Tony knelt for his omega. When he first found out, he had wondered if that was because of Tony’s biology, or if he was just the kind of alpha who wasn’t worried about the superficial appearance of strength. Based on what he knew of Tony, he’d always suspected it was the latter; Tony rarely cared what other people thought of him, and when he did, it was mostly to prove them wrong out of pique.
Natasha was watching them with narrowed eyes, but there was mirth easily readable in her body, the way her mouth moved when she reached for her cup of tea and blew across the top.
He squeezes Tony's fingers gently before letting go and taking a step back. Tony looks lost, his resolve cracking, and yet still ready to fight. It takes an elephantine amount of strength to turn away, but Steve does it. He walks towards the door in silence.
“There are moments where you’re unhappy,” Steve says, glancing back at the screen. “I can see it, now that I’m looking for it. Don’t lie to me, Tony.”
“They’ve agreed on the formation of international sanctions. King T’chaka of Wakanda was one of the primary forces behind the vote, and he will be on the committee they are amassing to determine the parameters. He seems stern but fair, sir, but I cannot say the same for all of the members of the committee. The U.S. Ambassador assigned to the committee is Henry Peter Gyrich.”
When he came back to himself Tony was shaking, eyes wide and disbelieving, and Steve hummed a question at him that made his back arch with overstimulation. He could feel Tony’s knot going down, now that he’d come again, and he waited patiently, savouring the feeling of Tony on his tongue. He didn’t like that he hadn’t really got to taste him, what with all of it going straight down his throat, but overall he was incredibly pleased with himself. He felt languorous, and probably more smug than was good.
“You smell good, okay?” he said, blushing again. “Just…I was just curious. That’s all. I know it’s a little different, for alphas and omegas. I’ve never…I just wondered.”
“I could ask someone to bring us something hot,” Tony mused. “Put it through the hatch. I think the worst of the fugue’s passed.”
“He’s laughing at you,” she said, after Steve had kicked one agent down a flight of stairs. The man had managed to nearly clip Hawkeye with a lucky shot, and Steve was absolutely not in the mood after doing this for an hour. “He says you’re going into mama-bear mode.”
“Hush,” Tony tells him, even as his stomach twists painfully, and Steve stops. He’s stiff as a board. “I just forgot to apply it this morning. Don’t get all twisted up about it.”
“Let’s try this again,” he says evenly. The smile he offers Loki is conspiratorial. Fond. “Come on. If you’re anything like me and Thor, you’ll need to eat after all that excitement. We’ll get you both cleaned up, and we'll see what Clint and Bruce have made for dinner, and we can chat about Bucky. Alright?”
He thinks about trying to touch Tony this morning, but the man barely stops long enough for Steve to try. He’s a whirlwind, getting dressed with an efficiency that betrays his desire to hide from what happened between them. He doesn’t speak to Steve again, and when Steve reaches out and brushes his fingers over the jut of bone at Tony’s shoulder, he flinches away. It’s enough to make Steve’s breath trip in his throat.
Tony always speaks so fast. It’s astounding, really. In the five minute clip, Tony manages to deliver an impassioned political diatribe, talk about the importance of clean energy, and allude to his apparently well-earned reputation of sexual prowess all in one go. Watching Tony spar verbally with this woman was like watching a particularly lively tennis match. Steve’s heart was in his throat for the whole clip, and all he kept thinking was:
